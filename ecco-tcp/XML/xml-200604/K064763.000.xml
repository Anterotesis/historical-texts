THREE DIALOGUES BETWEEN <HI>Hylas</HI> and <HI>Philonous.</HI></P>
<P>The Design of which Is plainly to demonstrate the Reality and Perfection of Humane Knowlege, the In∣corporeal Nature of the Soul, and the Im∣mediate Providence of a DEITY: In Opposition to <HI>SCEPTICS</HI> and <HI>ATHEISTS.</HI> ALSO, To open a METHOD for rendering the SCIENCES more easy, useful, and compendious.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Vertue, Learning, and good Sense, which are ac∣knowledged to distinguish Your Character, wou'd tempt me to indulge my∣self the Pleasure Men naturally take, in giving Applause to those, whom they esteem and honour: And it shou'd seem of Importance to the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that they knew, The eminent Share You en∣joy in the Favour of Your Sovereign,
<PB REF="3"/>
and the Honours She has conferred upon You, have not been owing to any Application from Your Lordship, but entirely to Her Majesty's own Thought, arising from a Sense of Your Personal Merit, and an Inclination to reward it. But as Your Name is prefixed to this Treatise, with an Intention to do Ho∣nour to myself alone, I shall only say, that I am encouraged, by the Favour You have treated me with, to address these Papers to Your Lordship. And I was the more ambitious of doing this, because a Philosophical Treatise cou'd not so properly be addressed to any one, as to a Person of Your Lordship's Cha∣racter, who, to Your other valuable Distinctions, have added the Know∣lege and Relish of Philosophy. I am, with the greatest Respect,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HO it seems the general Opi∣nion of the World, no less than the Design of Nature and Pro∣vidence, that the End of Spe∣culation be Practice, or the Im∣provement and Regulation of our Lives and Actions; Yet those, who are most addicted to speculative Studies, seem as generally of another Mind. And, indeed, if we consider the Pains that have been taken, to perplex the plainest Things, that Distrust of the Senses, those Doubts and Scruples, those Abstractions and Refinements that occurr in the very Entrance of the Sciences; it will not seem strange, that Men of Leisure and Curio∣sity
<PB REF="5"/>
shou'd lay themselves out in fruitless Dis∣quisitions, without descending to the practical Parts of Life, or informing themselves in the more necessary and important Parts of Know∣lege.</P>
<P>Upon the common Principles of Philosophers, we are not assured of the Existence of Things from their being perceived. And we are taught to distinguish their real Nature from that which falls under our Senses. Hence arise <HI>Scepticism</HI> and <HI>Paradoxes.</HI> It is not enough, that we see and feel, that we taste and smell a thing. Its true Nature, its absolute external Entity, is still concealed. For, tho it be the Fiction of our own Brain, we have made it inaccessible to all our Faculties. Sense is fallacious, Reason defe∣ctive. We spend our Lives in doubting of those things which other Men evidently know, and believing those things which they laugh at, and despise.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to divert the busy Mind of Man from vain Researches, it seemed neces∣sary to inquire into the Source of its Perplexi∣ties; and, if possible, to lay down such Prin∣ciples, as, by an easy Solution of them, together with their own native Evidence, may, at once, recommend themselves for Genuine to the Mind, and rescue it from those endless Pursuits it is engaged in. Which, with a plain Demonstra∣tion
<PB REF="6"/>
of the immediate Providence of an All∣seeing GOD, and the natural Immortality of the Soul, shou'd seem the readiest Preparation, as well as the strongest Motive, to the Study and Practice of Vertue.</P>
<P>This Design I proposed, in the First Part of a Treatise concerning the <HI>Principles of Hu∣mane Knowledge,</HI> published in the Year <HI>1710.</HI> But, before I proceed to publish the Second Part, I thought it requisite to treat more clearly and fully of certain Principles laid down in the First, and to place them in a new Light. Which is the Business of the following <HI>Dialogues.</HI></P>
<P>In this Treatise, which does not presuppose in the Reader, any Knowledge of what was contained in the former, it has been my Aim to introduce the Notions I advance, into the Mind, in the most easy and familiar manner; especial∣ly, because they carry with them a great Oppo∣sition to the Prejudices of Philosophers, which have so far prevailed against the common Sense and natural Notions of Mankind.</P>
<P>If the Principles, which I here endeavour to propagate, are admitted for true; the Conse∣quences which, I think, evidently flow from thence, are, that <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Scepticism</HI> will be utterly destroyed, many intricate Points made plain, great Difficulties solved, several useless
<PB REF="7"/>
Parts of Science retrenched, Speculation referred to Practice, and Men reduced from Paradoxes to common Sense.</P>
<P>And altho it may, perhaps, seem an uneasy Reflexion to some, that when they have taken a Circuit thorow so many refined and unvulgar Notions, they shou'd at last come to think like o∣ther Men: Yet, methinks, this Return to the simple Dictates of Nature, after having wan∣dered thorow the wild Mazes of Philosophy, is not unpleasant. It is like coming home from a long Voyage: A Man reflects with Pleasure on the many Difficulties and Perplexities he has passed thorow, sets his Heart at ease, and enjoys himself with more Satisfaction for the future.</P>
<P>As it was my Intention to convince <HI>Sceptics</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> by Reason, so it has been my Endea∣vor strictly to observe the most rigid Laws of Reasoning. And, to an impartial Reader, I hope, it will be manifest, that the sublime No∣tion of a GOD, and the comfortable Expecta∣tion of Immortality, do naturally arise from a close and methodical Application of Thought: Whatever may be the Result of that loose, ram∣bling Way, not altogether improperly termed <HI>Free-thinking,</HI> by certain Libertines in Thought, who can no more endure the Restraints of <HI>Logic,</HI> than those of <HI>Religion,</HI> or <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
It will, perhaps, be objected to my Design, that so far as it tends to ease the Mind of dif∣ficult and useless Inquiries, it can affect only a few speculative Persons; but, if by their Spe∣culations rightly placed, the Study of Morality and the Law of Nature were brought more in∣to Fashion among Men of Parts and Genius, the Discouragements that draw to <HI>Scepticism</HI> removed, the Measures of Right and Wrong accurately defined, and the Principles of Natu∣ral Religion reduced into regular Systems, as artfully disposed and clearly connected as those of some other Sciences: There are grounds to think, these Effects wou'd not only have a gra∣dual Influence in repairing the too much defa∣ced Sense of Vertue in the World; but also, by shewing, that such Parts of Revelation, as lie within the reach of Humane Inquiry, are most agreeable to Right Reason, wou'd dispose all prudent, unprejudiced Persons, to a modest and wary Treatment of those Sacred Mysteries, which are above the Comprehension of our Fa∣culties.</P>
<P>It remains, that I desire the Reader to with∣hold his Censure of these Dialogues, till he has read them thorow. Otherwise, he may lay them aside in a Mistake of their Design, or on account of Difficulties or Objections which he wou'd find answered in the Sequel. A Treatise of this Na∣ture
<PB REF="9"/>
wou'd require to be once read over cohe∣rently, in order to comprehend its Design, the Proofs, Solution of Difficulties, and the Con∣nexion and Disposition of its Parts. If it be thought to deserve a Second Reading; this, I imagine, will make the intire Scheme very plain: Especially, if Recourse be had to an Essay I wrote, some Years since, upon <HI>Vision,</HI> and the Treatise concerning the <HI>Principles of Humane Knowlege.</HI> Wherein divers Notions advan∣ced in these <HI>Dialogues,</HI> are farther pursued, or placed in different Lights, and other Points handled, which naturally tend to confirm and illustrate them.</P>

<HEAD>The First DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philonous.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>OOD Morrow, <HI>Hylas,</HI> I did not expect to find you abroad so early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hylas.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in∣deed something unusual, but my Thoughts were so taken up with a Sub∣ject I was discoursing of last Night, that finding I could not sleep, I resolved to rise and take a turn in the Garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It happened well, to let you see what innocent and agreeable Pleasures you lose every Morning. Can there be a pleasanter time of the Day, or a more delightful Sea∣son of the Year? That purple Sky, these wild but sweet Notes of Birds, the fra∣grant Bloom upon the Trees and Flowers, the gentle Influence of the rising Sun, these
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
and a thousand nameless Beauties of Nature inspire the Soul with secret Transports; its Faculties too being at this time fresh and lively, are fit for those Meditations, which the Solitude of a Garden and Tranquillity of the Morning naturally dispose us to. But I am afraid I interrupt your Thoughts: for you seemed very intent on something.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I was, and shall be obliged to you if you will permit me to go on in the same Vein; not that I would by any means deprive myself of your Company, for my Thoughts always flow more easily in Conver∣sation with a Friend, than when I am alone: But my Request is, that you would suffer me to impart my Reflexions to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, it is what I should have requested my self, if you had not pre∣vented me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was considering the odd Fate of those Men who have in all Ages, through an Affectation of being distinguished from the Vulgar, or some unaccountable Turn of Thought, pretended either to believe no∣thing at all, or to believe the most extrava∣gant Things in the World. This however might be born, if their Paradoxes and Scepti∣cism did not draw after them some Conse∣quences of general Disadvantage to Man∣kind. But the Mischief lies here; that when Men of less Leisure see them who are suppo∣sed
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
to have spent their whole time in the Pursuits of Knowlege, professing an intire Ignorance of all Things, or advancing such Notions as are repugnant to plain and com∣monly received Principles, they will be tempted to entertain Suspicions concerning the most important Truths which they had hitherto held sacred and unquestionable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intirely agree with you, as to the ill Tendency of the affected Doubts of some Philosophers, and fantastical Conceits of o∣thers. I am even so far gone of late in this way of Thinking, that I have quitted several of the sublime Notions I had got in their Schools for vulgar Opinions. And I give it you on my Word, since this Revolt from Me∣taphysical Notions to the plain Dictates of Nature and common Sense, I find my Un∣derstanding strangely enlightened, so that I can now easily comprehend a great many Things which before were all Mystery and Riddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find there was nothing in the Accounts I heard of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what were those?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were represented in last Night's Conversation, as one who maintained the most extravagant Opinion that ever entered into the Mind of Man, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is no such Thing as <HI>material Substance</HI> in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there is no such Thing as what Philosophers call <HI>Material Substance,</HI> I am se∣riously persuaded: But if I were made to see any thing Absurd or Sceptical in this, I should then have the same Reason to renounce this, that I imagine I have now to reject the con∣trary Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! can any Thing be more fan∣tastical, more repugnant to common Sense, or a more manifest Piece of Scepticism, than to believe there is no such Thing as <HI>Matter?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, good <HI>Hylas.</HI> What if it should prove, that you, who hold there is, are by Vertue of that Opinion a greater <HI>Sceptic,</HI> and maintain more Paradoxes and Repug∣nancies to common Sense, than I who be∣lieve no such Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may as soon persuade me, The Part is greater than the Whole, as that, in order to avoid Absurdity and Scepticism, I should ever be obliged to give up my Opi∣nion in this Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, are you content to admit that Opinion for true, which upon Examina∣tion shall appear most agreeable to common Sense, and remote from Scepticism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart. Since you are for raising Disputes about the plainest Things in Nature, I am content for once to hear what you have to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>Hylas,</HI> what do you mean by a <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean what all Men mean, one that doubts of every Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He then who entertains no Doubt concerning some particular Point, with re∣gard to that Point, cannot be thought a <HI>Sceptic.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether does Doubting consist in embracing the Affirmative or Negative Side of a Question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In neither; for whoever understands <HI>English,</HI> cannot but know that <HI>Doubting</HI> sig∣nifies a Suspense between both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He then that denies any Point, can no more be said to doubt of it, than he who affirms it with the same Degree of Assu∣rance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And consequently, for such his Denial is no more to be esteemed a <HI>Sceptic</HI> than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How comes it then, <HI>Hylas,</HI> that you pronounce me a <HI>Sceptic,</HI> because I deny what you affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> the Existence of Matter? Since, for ought you can tell, I am as perem∣ptory in my Denial, as you in your Affirma∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I have been a lit∣tle out in my Definition; but every false Step a Man makes in Discourse is not to be insisted on. I said, indeed, that a <HI>Sceptic</HI> was one who doubted of every Thing; but I should have added, or who denies the Reality and Truth of Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Things? Do you mean the Principles and Theoremes of Sciences? But these you know are universal intellectual No∣tions, and consequently independent of Mat∣ter; the Denial therefore of this doth not im∣ply the denying them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it. But are there no other Things? What think you of distrusting the Senses, of denying the real Existence of sen∣sible Things, or pretending to know nothing of them. Is not this sufficient to denominate a Man a <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall we therefore examine which of us it is that denies the Reality of Sensible Things, or professes the greatest Ignorance of them; since, if I take you rightly, he is to be esteemed the greatest <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is what I desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mean you by Sensible Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those Things which are perceived by the Senses. Can you imagine that I mean any thing else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> if I am desirous clearly to apprehend your Notions, since this
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
may much shorten our Inquiry. Suffer me then to ask you this farther Question. Are those Things only perceived by the Senses which are perceived immediately? Or may those Things properly be said to be <HI>Sensible,</HI> which are perceived mediately, or not with∣out the Intervention of others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not sufficiently understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In reading a Book, what I immediate∣ly perceive are the Letters, but mediately, or by means of these, are suggested to my Thoughts the Notions of God, Virtue, Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, that the Letters are truly Sensi∣ble Things, or perceived by Sense, there is no doubt: But I would know whether you take the Things suggested by them to be so too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No certainly, it were absurd to think <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Virtue</HI> Sensible Things, tho' they may be signified and suggested to the Mind by Sensible Marks, with which they have an arbitrary Connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then, that by <HI>Sensible Things</HI> you mean those only which can be perceived immediately by Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it not follow from this, that tho' I see one part of the Sky Red, and ano∣ther Blue, and that my Reason doth thence evidently conclude there must be some Cause of that Diversity of Colours, yet that Cause
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
cannot be said to be a Sensible Thing, or perceived by the Sense of Seeing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In like manner, tho' I hear Variety of Sounds, yet I cannot be said to hear the Causes of those Sounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when by my Touch I perceive a thing to be hot and heavy, I cannot say with any Truth or Propriety, that I feel the Cause of its Heat or Weight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To prevent any more Questions of this kind, I tell you once for all, that by <HI>Sensible Things</HI> I mean those only which are perceived by Sense, and that in truth the Senses perceive nothing which they do not perceive immediately: for they make no Infe∣rences. The Deducing therefore of Causes or Occasions from Effects and Appearances, which alone are perceived by Sense, intirely relates to Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Point then is agreed between us, That <HI>sensible things are those only which are immediately perceived by Sense.</HI> You will farther inform me, whether we immediately perceive by Sight, any thing beside Light, and Colours, and Figures: or by Hearing, any thing but Sounds: by the Palate, any thing beside Tastes: by the Smell, beside Odors: or by the Touch, more than tangible Quali∣ties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems, therefore, that if you take away all sensible Qualities, there remains no∣thing sensible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sensible things, therefore, are nothing else but so many sensible Qualities, or Com∣binations of sensible Qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heat then is a sensible thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does the Reality of sensible things consist in being perceived? or, is it some∣thing distinct from their being perceived, and that bears no relation to the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To <HI>exist</HI> is one thing, and to be <HI>per∣ceived</HI> is another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I speak with regard to sensible things only: And of these I ask, Whether by their real Existence you mean a Subsistence exte∣rior to the Mind, and distinct from their being perceived?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean a real, absolute Being, distinct from, and without any relation to, their be∣ing perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heat, therefore, if it be allowed a real Being, must exist without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> is this real Existence equally compatible to all Degrees of Heat, which we perceive: or, is there any Reason
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
why we should attribute it to some, and de∣ny it others? And if there be, pray let me know that Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever Degree of Heat we per∣ceive by Sense, we may be sure, the same exists in the Object that occasions it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the greatest as well as the least?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, the Reason is plainly the same in respect of both: They are both perceived by Sense; nay, the greater Degree of Heat is more sensibly perceived; and, con∣sequently, if there is any Difference, we are more certain of its real Existence than we can be of the Reality of a lesser Degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not the most vehement and intense Degree of Heat a very great Pain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No one can deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, is any unperceiving thing ca∣pable of Pain or Pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is your material Substance a sensless Being, or a Being endowed with Sense and Perception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is sensless, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot, therefore, be the Subject of Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor, consequently, of the greatest Heat perceived by Sense, since you acknow∣lege this to be no small Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall we say then of your ex∣ternal Object; is it a material Substance, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a material Substance with the sensible Qualities inhering in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then can a great Heat exist in it, since you own, it cannot in a material Substance? I desire you wou'd clear this Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I fear I was out in yielding intense Heat to be a Pain. It shou'd seem rather, that Pain is something distinct from Heat, and the Consequence or Effect of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon putting your Hand near the Fire, do you perceive one simple, uniform Sensation, or two distinct Sensations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But one simple Sensation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the Heat immediately per∣ceived?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Pain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seeing, therefore, they are both im∣mediately perceived at the same time, and the Fire affects you only with one simple, or uncompounded Idea, it follows, that this same simple Idea is both the intense Heat im∣mediately perceived, and the Pain; and, con∣sequently, that the intense Heat immediately
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
perceived, is nothing distinct from a particu∣lar sort of Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, try in your Thoughts, <HI>Hylas,</HI> if you can conceive a vehement Sensation to be without Pain, or Pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, can you frame to yourself an Idea of sensible Pain or Pleasure in general, abstracted from every particular Idea of Heat, Cold, Tastes, Smells? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>—I do not find that I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it not, therefore, follow, that sensible Pain is nothing distinct from those Sensations, or Ideas, in an intense Degree?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is undeniable; and to speak the Truth, I begin to suspect, a very great Heat cannot exist but in a Mind perceiving it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! are you then in that <HI>Sceptical</HI> State of Suspense, between Affirming and Denying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I may be positive in the Point. A very violent and painful Heat cannot exist without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has not, therefore, according to you, any real Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it, therefore, certain, that there is no body in Nature really hot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not denied there is any real Heat in Bodies. I only say, there is no such thing as an intense real Heat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, did you not say before, that all Degrees of Heat were equally real: or, if there was any difference, that the Greater were more undoubtedly real than the Lesser?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True: But it was, because I did not then consider the Ground there is for distin∣guishing between them, which I now plainly see. And it is this: Because intense Heat is nothing else but a particular kind of painful Sensation; and Pain cannot exist but in a perceiving Being; it follows, that no intense Heat can really exist in an unperceiving cor∣poreal Substance. But this is no Reason, why we should deny Heat in an inferior Degree, to exist in such a Substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, how shall we be able to discern those Degrees of Heat which exist only in the Mind, from those which exist without it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is no difficult matter. You know, the least Pain cannot exist unperceived; what∣ever, therefore, Degree of Heat is a Pain, exists only in the Mind. But, as for all other Degrees of Heat, nothing obliges us to think the same of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you granted before, that no unperceiving Being was capable of Pleasure, any more than of Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, is not Warmth, or a more gen∣tle Degree of Heat than what causes Uneasi∣ness, a Pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, it cannot exist with∣out the Mind in any unperceiving Substance, or Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since therefore, as well those Degrees of Heat that are not painful, as those that are, can exist only in a Thinking Substance, may we not conclude, that external Bodies are absolutely incapable of any Degree of Heat whatsoever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>On second Thoughts, I do not think it so evident that Warmth is a Pleasure, as that a great Degree of Heat is a Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend, that Warmth is as great a Pleasure as Heat is a Pain. But if you grant it to be even a small Pleasure, it serves to make good my Conclusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd rather call it an <HI>Indolence.</HI> It seems to be nothing more than a Priva∣tion of both Pain and Pleasure. And that such a Quality or State as this may agree to an unthinking Substance, I hope you will not deny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are resolved to maintain that Warmth, or a gentle Degree of Heat, is no Pleasure, I know not how to convince you otherwise, than by appealing to your own Sense. But what think you of Cold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same that I do of Heat. An in∣tense Degree of Cold is a Pain; for to feel
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
a very great Cold, is to perceive a great Un∣easiness: It cannot, therefore, exist without the Mind; but a lesser Degree of Cold may, as well as a lesser Degree of Heat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those Bodies, therefore, upon whose Application to our own, we perceive a mode∣rate Degreee of Heat, must be concluded to have a moderate Degree of Heat or Warmth in them: And those, upon whose Applica∣tion we feel a like Degree of Cold, must be thought to have Cold in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can any Doctrine be true that ne∣cessarily leads a Man into an Absurdity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, it cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not an Absurdity to think, that the same thing shou'd be at the same time both cold and warm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose now, one of your Hands hot, and the other cold, and that they are both at once put into the same Vessel of Water, in an intermediate State; will not the Water seem cold to one Hand, and warm to the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ought we not, therefore, by your Principles to conclude, it is really both cold and warm at the same time, that is, accor∣ding to your own Concession, to believe an Absurdity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, it seems so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, the Principles them∣selves are false, since you have granted, that no true Principle leads to an Absurdity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after all, can any thing be more absurd than to say, <HI>there is no Heat in the Fire?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To make the Point still clearer; tell me, whether in two Cases exactly alike, we ought not to make the same Judgment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>We ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When a Pin pricks your Finger, does it not rend and divide the Fibres of your Flesh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when a Coal burns your Fin∣ger, does it any more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since, therefore, you neither judge the Sensation itself occasioned by the Pin, nor any thing like it to be in the Pin; you shoul'd not, conformably to what you have now granted, judge the Sensation, occasioned by the Fire, or any thing like it, to be in the Fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since it must be so, I am con∣tent to yield this Point, and acknowlege, that Heat and Cold are only Sensations exi∣sting in our Minds: But there still remain Qualities enough to secure the Reality of external Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what will you say, <HI>Hylas,</HI> if it shall appear that the Case is the same with regard to all other sensible Qualities, and that they can no more be supposed to exist with∣out the Mind, than Heat and Cold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, indeed, you will have done something to the purpose; but that is what I despair of seeing proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us examine them in Order. What think you of Tastes, do they exist without the Mind, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can any Man in his Senses doubt whether Sugar is sweet, or Wormwood bit∣ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inform me, <HI>Hylas.</HI> Is a sweet Taste a particular kind of Pleasure or pleasant Sen∣sation, or is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not Bitterness some kind of Uneasiness or Pain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If, therefore, Sugar and Wormwood are unthinking corporeal Substances existing without the Mind, how can Sweetness and Bitterness, that is, Pleasure and Pain, agree to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I now see what it was deluded me all this time. You asked whether Heat and Cold, Sweetness and Bit∣terness, were not particular Sorts of Plea∣sure and Pain; to which I answered simply,
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
that they were. Whereas I should have thus distinguished: Those Qualities, as perceived by us, are Pleasures or Pains, but not as exist∣ing in the external Objects. We must not therefore conclude absolutely, that there is no Heat in the Fire, or Sweetness in the Sugar, but only that Heat or Sweetness, as perceived by us, are not in the Fire or Sugar. What say you to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say it is nothing to the Purpose. Our Discourse proceeded altogether concern∣ing Sensible Things, which you defined to be the Things we <HI>immediately perceive by our Senses.</HI> Whatever other Qualities, therefore, you speak of, as distinct from these, I know nothing of them, neither do they at all be∣long to the Point in Dispute. You may, in∣deed, pretend to have discovered certain Qualities which you do not perceive, and as∣sert those insensible Qualities exist in Fire and Sugar. But, what Use can be made of this to your present Purpose, I am at a Loss to conceive. Tell me then once more, do you acknowlege that Heat and Cold, Sweet∣ness and Bitterness, (meaning those Qualities which are perceived by the Senses) do not exist without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it is to no purpose to hold out, so I give up the Cause as to those mentioned Qualities: Though I profess it sounds odly, to say that Sugar is not sweet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for your farther Satisfaction, take this along with you: That which at other times seems sweet, shall, to a distempered Pa∣late, appear bitter. And nothing can be plainer, than that divers Persons perceive dif∣ferent Tastes in the same Food, since that which one Man delights in, another abhors. And how could this be, if the Taste was something really inherent in the Food?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege I know not how.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the next place, Odors are to be con∣sidered. And with regard to these, I would fain know, whether what has been said of Tastes does not exactly agree to them? Are they not so many pleasing or displeasing Sen∣sations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you then conceive it possible that they should exist in an unperceiving Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or can you imagine, that Filth and Ordure affect those brute Animals that feed on them out of Choice, with the same Smells which we perceive in them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>May we not, therefore, conclude of Smells, as of the other forementioned Quali∣ties, that they cannot exist in any but a per∣ceiving Substance or Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then as to Sounds, what must we think of them: Are they Accidents really in∣herent in external Bodies, or not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they inhere not in the sonorous Bodies, is plain from hence; because a Bell struck in the exhausted Receiver of an Air-Pump, sends forth no Sound. The Air, therefore, must be thought the Subject of Sound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Reason is there for that, <HI>Hy∣las?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because when any Motion is raised in the Air, we perceive a Sound greater or les∣ser, in Proportion to the Air's Motion; but without some Motion in the Air, we never hear any Sound at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, granting that we never hear a Sound but when some Motion is produced in the Air, yet I do not see how you can infer from thence, that the Sound itself is in the Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is this very Motion in the external Air, that produces in the Mind the Sensation of <HI>Sound.</HI> For, striking on the Drum of the Air, it causes a Vibration, which by the Au∣ditory Nerves being communicated to the Brain, the Soul is thereupon affected with the Sensation called <HI>Sound.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! is Sound then a Sensation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, as perceived by us, it is a particular Sensation in the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can any Sensation exist with∣out the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then can Sound, being a Sen∣sation, exist in the Air, if by the <HI>Air</HI> you mean a sensless Substance existing without the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must distinguish, <HI>Philonous,</HI> be∣tween Sound as it is perceived by us, and as it is in itself; or (which is the same thing) between the Sound we immediately perceive, and that which exists without us. The for∣mer, indeed, is a particular kind of Sensa∣tion, but the latter is merely a Vibrative or Undulatory Motion in the Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I had already obviated that Distinction, by the Answer I gave when you were applying it in a like Case before. But to say no more of that; Are you sure then that Sound is really nothing but Motion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever therefore agrees to real Sound, may with Truth be attributed to Mo∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is then good Sense to speak of <HI>Mo∣tion,</HI> as of a thing that is <HI>loud, sweet, acute, grave,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are resolved not to under∣stand me. Is it not evident, those Accidents or Modes belong only to sensible Sound, or
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
<HI>Sound</HI> in the Common Acceptation of the Word, but not to <HI>Sound</HI> in the Real and Phi∣losophic Sense, which, as I just now told you, is nothing but a certain Motion of the Air?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then there are two Sorts of Sound, the one Vulgar, or that which is heard, the other Philosophical and Real.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the latter consists in Motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you so before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> to which of the Senses, think you, the Idea of Motion be∣long: To the Hearing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No certainly, but to the Sight and Touch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It should follow then, that according to you, real Sounds may possibly be <HI>seen</HI> or <HI>felt,</HI> but never <HI>heard.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you may if you please make a Jest of my Opinion, but that will not alter the Truth of Things. I own, indeed, the Inferences you draw me into, sound something odly; but common Lan∣guage, you know, is framed by, and for the Use of, the Vulgar: we must not therefore wonder, if Expressions, adapted to exact Phi∣losophic Notions, seem uncouth and out of the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it come to that? I assure you I imagine myself to have gained no small
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
Point, since you make so light of departing from common Phrases and Opinions; it be∣ing a main Part of our Inquiry, to examine whose Notions are widest of the common Road, and most repugnant to the general Sense of the World. But, can you think it no more than a Philosophical Paradox, to say that <HI>real Sounds are never heard,</HI> and that the Idea of them is obtained by some other Sense. And is there nothing in this contrary to Nature, and the Truth of Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal ingenuously, I do not like it. And after the Concessions already made, I had as good grant that Sounds too have no real Being without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I hope, you will make no Dif∣ficulty to acknowlege the same of Colours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me: the Case of Colours is very different. Can any thing be plainer, than that we see them on the Objects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Objects you speak of are, I sup∣pose, corporeal Substances existing without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, have true and real Colours in∣hering in them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Each visible Object has that Colour which we see in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! Is there any thing visible but what we perceive by Sight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, do we perceive any thing by Sense, which we do not perceive imme∣diately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often must I be obliged to re∣peat the same thing? I tell you, we do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have Patience, good <HI>Hylas;</HI> and tell me once more, whether there is any thing immediately perceived by the Senses, except sensible Qualities. I know, you asserted there was not: But I wou'd now be inform∣ed, whether you still persist in the same Opi∣nion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, is your corporeal Substance either a sensible Quality, or made up of sen∣sible Qualities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a Question that is! who ever thought it was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Reason for asking was, because in saying, <HI>each visible Object has that Colour which we see in it,</HI> you make visible Objects to be corporeal Substances; which implies either that corporeal Substances are sensible Qualities, or else, that there is something be∣side sensible Qualities perceived by Sight: But, as this Point was formerly agreed be∣tween us, and is still maintained by you, it is a clear Consequence, that your corporeal Substance is nothing distinct from sensible Qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may draw as many absurd Con∣sequences as you please, and endeavor to perplex the plainest things; but you shall ne∣ver persuade me out of my Senses. I clearly understand my own Meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would make me under∣stand it too. But, since you are unwilling to have your Notion of corporeal Substance exa∣mined, I shall urge that Point no farther. Only be pleased to let me know, whether the same Colours which we see, exist in exter∣nal Bodies, or some other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! are then the beautiful Red and Purple we see on yonder Clouds, really in them? Or, do you imagine, they have in themselves any other Form, than that of a dark Mist, or Vapour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own, <HI>Philonous,</HI> those Colours are not really in the Clouds, as they seem to be at this Distance. They are only apparent Colours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Apparent</HI> call you them; how shall we distinguish these apparent Colours from real?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very easily. Those are to be thought apparent, which, appearing only at a distance, vanish upon a nearer Approach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And those, I suppose, are to be thought real, which are discovered by the most near and exact Survey.</P>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the nearest and exactest Survey, made by help of a Microscope, or by the naked Eye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a Microscope, doubtless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a Microscope often discovers Co∣lours in an Object different from those per∣ceived by the unassisted Sight. And in case we had Microscopes, magnifying to any as∣signed Degree; it is certain, that no Object whatsoever, viewed thro' them, wou'd appear in the same Colour which it exhibits to the naked Eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, what will you conclude from all this? You cannot argue, that there are really and naturally no Colours on Objects: because, by artificial Managements they may be altered, or made to vanish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it may evidently be concluded from your own Concessions, that all the Co∣lours we see with our naked Eyes, are only apparent as those on the Clouds, since they vanish upon a more close and accurate In∣spection, which is afforded us by a Micro∣scope. Then, as to what you say by way of Prevention: I ask you, whether the real and natural State of an Object is better discovered by a very sharp and piercing Sight, or by one which is less sharp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the former, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not plain from <HI>Dioptrics,</HI> that Microscopes make the Sight more penetra∣ting,
<PB N="27" REF="40"/>
and represent Objects as they wou'd appear to the Eye, in case it were naturally endowed with a most exquisite Sharpness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, the Microscopical Re∣presentation is to be thought that which best sets forth the real Nature of the Thing, or what it is in itself. The Colours, therefore, by it perceived, are more genuine and real, than those perceived otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, there is something in what you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, it is not only possible, but manifest, that there actually are Animals, whose Eyes are by Nature framed to per∣ceive those things, which, by reason of their Minuteness, escape our Sight. What think you of those inconceivably small Animals, perceived by Glasses? Must we suppose they are all stark blind? or, in case they see, can it be imagined, their Sight has not the same Use in preserving their Bodies from Injuries, which appears in That of all other Animals? and if it hath, is it not evident, they must see Particles less than their own Bodies, which will present them with a far different View in each Object, from that which strikes our Sen∣ses? Even our own Eyes do not always re∣present Objects to us after the same manner. In the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> every one knows that all things seem yellow. Is it not, therefore,
<PB N="28" REF="41"/>
highly probable, those Animals, in whose Eyes we discern a very different Texture from that of ours, and whose Bodies abound with different Humors, do not see the same Colours in every Object that we do? From all which, shou'd it not seem to follow, that all Colours are equally apparent, and that none of those which we perceive are really inherent in any outward Object?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shou'd.</P>
</SP>

<P>The Point will be past all doubt, if you consider, that in case Colours were real Properties or Affections inherent in external Bodies, they cou'd admit of no Alteration, without some Change wrought in the very Bodies themselves: But, is it not evident from what has been said, that, upon the Use of Microscopes, upon a Change happening in the Humors of the Eye, or a Variation of Distance, without any manner of real Alte∣ration in the Thing itself, the Colours of any Object are either changed, or totally disap∣pear? Nay, all other Circumstances remain∣ing the same, change but the Situation of some Objects, and they shall present different Colours to the Eye. The same thing hap∣pens upon viewing an Object in various De∣grees of Light. And what is more known, than that the same Bodies appear differently coloured by Candle-light, from what they do in the open Day? Add to these, the Ex∣periment
<PB N="29" REF="42"/>
of a Prism, which, separating the heterogeneous Rays of Light, alters the Co∣lour of any Object; and will cause the Whitest to appear of a deep Blue, or Red, to the na∣ked Eye. And now tell me, whether you are still of Opinion, that every Body has its true real Colour inhering in it; and if you think it has, I would fain know farther from you, what certain Distance and Position of the Object, what peculiar Texture and For∣mation of the Eye, what Degree or Kind of Light is necessary for ascertaining that true Colour, and distinguishing it from apparent ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own myself intirely satisfied, that they are all equally apparent; and that there is no such thing as Colour really inhering in external Bodies, but that it is altogether in the Light. And what confirms me in this Opinion is, that in proportion to the Light, Colours are still more or less vivid; and if there be no Light, then are there no Colours perceived. Besides, allowing there are Co∣lours on external Objects, yet, how is it pos∣sible for us to perceive them? For no exter∣nal Body affects the Mind, unless it act first on our Organs of Sense. But the only Action of Bodies is Motion; and Motion cannot be communicated otherwise than by Impulse. A distant Object, therefore, can∣not act on the Eye, nor, consequently, make
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
itself, or its Properties perceivable to the Soul. Whence it plainly follows, that it is immediately some contiguous Substance, which operating on the Eye, occasions a Perception of Colours: And such is Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! is Light then a Substance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> external Light is nothing but a thin, fluid Substance, whose minute Particles being agitated with a brisk Motion, and in various Manners reflected from the different Surfaces of outward Ob∣jects to the Eyes, communicate different Mo∣tions to the Optick Nerves; which being pro∣pagated to the Brain, cause therein various Impressions: And these are attended with the Sensations of Red, Blue, Yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then, the Light does no more than shake the Optick Nerves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And consequent to each particular Motion of the Nerves, the Mind is affected with a Sensation, which is some particular Colour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And these Sensations have no Exi∣stence without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then do you affirm, that Co∣lours are in the Light, since by <HI>Light</HI> you understand a corporeal Substance external to the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Light and Colours, as immediately perceived by us, I grant cannot exist without the Mind. But in themselves, they consist in∣tirely in the Motions and Configurations of certain insensible Particles of Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colours then, in the vulgar Sense, or taken for the immediate Objects of Sight, cannot agree to any but a perceiving Sub∣stance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is what I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, since you give up the Point as to those sensible Qualities, which are alone thought Colours by all Mankind beside, you may hold what you please with regard to those invisible ones of the Philoso∣phers. It is not my Business to dispute about them; only I would advise you to think, whether, considering the Inquiry we are up∣on, it be prudent for you to affirm, <HI>the Red and Blue which we see are not real Colours, but certain unknown Motions and Figures which no Man ever did or can see are truly so.</HI> Are not these shocking Notions, and are not they subject to as many ridiculous Inferences, as those you before renounced in the Case of Sounds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I frankly own, <HI>Philonous,</HI> that it is in vain to stand out any longer. Colours, Sounds, Tastes, in a word, all those term∣ed <HI>Secondary Qualities,</HI> have certainly no Existence without the Mind. But by this
<PB N="32" REF="45"/>
Acknowlegement, I must not be supposed to derogate any thing from the Reality of Mat∣ter, or external Objects, seeing it is no more than several Philosophers maintain, who ne∣vertheless are the farthest imaginable from de∣nying Matter. For the clearer Understanding of this, you must know, sensible Qualities are by Philosophers divided into <HI>Primary</HI> and <HI>Se∣condary.</HI> The former are Extension, Figure, Solidity, Gravity, Motion, and Rest; and these they hold exist really in Bodies. The latter are those above enumerated; or, briefly, all sensible Qualities beside, the Primary, which they assert are only so many Sensa∣tions or Ideas existing no where but in the Mind. But all this, I doubt not, you are al∣ready apprised of. For my part, I have been a long time sensible there was such an Opi∣nion current among Philosophers, but was never thorowly convinced of its Truth till now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are still then of Opinion, that Extension and Figures are inherent in exter∣nal unthinking Substances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what if the same Arguments which are brought against Secondary Quali∣ties, will hold good against these also?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then I shall be obliged to think, they too exist only in the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="46"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it your Opinion, the very Figure and Extension which you perceive by Sense, exist in the outward Object or material Sub∣stance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have all other Animals as good Grounds to think the same, of the Figure and Extension which they see and feel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, if they have any Thought at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Answer me, <HI>Hylas.</HI> Think you the Senses were bestowed upon all Animals for their Preservation and Well-Being in Life? or, were they given to Men alone for this End?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no question but they have the same Use in all other Animals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, is it not necessary they should be enabled by them to perceive their own Limbs, and those Bodies which are capable of harming them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Mite therefore must be supposed to see his own Foot, and Things equal, or even less than it, as Bodies of some consider∣able Dimension; tho at the same time they appear to you scarce discernible, or, at best, as so many visible Points.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to Creatures less than the Mite they will seem yet larger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insomuch that what you can hardly discern, will to another extremely minute Animal appear as some huge Mountain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this I grant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can one and the same thing be at the same time in itself of different Dimensions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That were absurd to imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But from what you have laid down it follows, that both the Extension by you perceived, and that perceived by the Mite it∣self, as likewise all those perceived by lesser Animals, are each of them the true Exten∣sion of the Mite's Foot; that is to say, by your own Principles you are led into an Ab∣surdity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There seems to be some Difficulty in the Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, have you not acknowledged that no real inherent Property of any Object can be changed, without some Change in the thing itself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as we approach to or recede from an Object, the visible Extension varies, being at one Distance ten or an hundred times greater than at another. Does it not there∣fore follow from hence likewise, that it is not really inherent in the Object?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I am at a Loss what to think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="35" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Judgment will soon be deter∣mined, if you will venture to think as freely with relation to this Quality, as you have done in respect of the rest. Was it not ad∣mitted as a good Argument, that neither Heat nor Cold was in the Water, because it seemed warm to one Hand, and cold to the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not the very same Reasoning to conclude, there is no Extension or Figure in an Object, because to one Eye it shall seem little, smooth, and round, when at the same time it appears to the other, great, uneven, and angular?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same. But does this latter Fact ever happen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may at any time make the Ex∣periment, by looking with one Eye bare, and with the other thro a Microscope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not how to maintain it, and yet I am loath to give up <HI>Extension,</HI> I see so many od Consequences following upon such a Concession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Od,</HI> say you? After the Concessions already made, I hope you will stick at no∣thing for its Odness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give up the Point for the pre∣sent, reserving still a Right to retract my Opi∣nion, in case I shall hereafter discover any false Step in my Progress to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Right you cannot be de∣nied. Figures and Extension being dispatch∣ed, we proceed next to <HI>Motion.</HI> Can a real Motion in any external Body be, at the same time, both very swift and very slow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the Motion of a Body swift in a reciprocal Proportion to the time it takes up in describing any given Space? Thus a Body that describes a Mile in an Hour, moves three times faster than it would in case it de∣scribed only a Mile in three Hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not Time measured by the Succession of Ideas in our Minds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it not possible Ideas should succeed one another twice as fast in your Mind, as they do in mine, or in that of some Spirit of another Kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently the same Body may to another seem to perform its Motion over any Space, in half the time that it does to you. And the same Reasoning will hold as to any other Proportion: That is to say, according to your Principles (since the Motions per∣ceived are both really in the Object) it is pos∣sible one and the same Body shall be really moved, the same way, at once, both very swift, and very slow. How is this consistent
<PB N="37" REF="50"/>
either with common Sense, or what you just now granted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to say to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then as for <HI>Solidity;</HI> either you do not mean any sensible Quality by that Word, and so it is beside our Inquiry: Or if you do, it must be either Hardness or Resistance. But both the one and the other are plainly relative to our Senses: It being evident, that what seems hard to one Animal, may appear soft to another, who hath greater Force and Firm∣ness of Limbs. Nor is it less plain, that the Resistance I feel is not in the Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, the very Sensation of Resi∣stance, which is all you immediately perceive, is not in the Body, but the Cause of that Sen∣sation is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, the Causes of our Sensations are not Things immediately perceived, and there∣fore not sensible. This Point I thought had been already determined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it was; but you will pardon me if I seem a little embarrassed: I know not how to quit my old Notions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To help you out, do but consider, that if Extension be once acknowleged to have no Existence without the Mind, the same must necessarily be granted of Motion, Soli∣dity, and Gravity, since they all evidently suppose Extension. It is therefore superfluous to inquire particularly concerning each of
<PB N="38" REF="51"/>
them. In denying Extension, you have de∣nied them all to have any real Existence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, <HI>Philonous,</HI> if what you say be true, why those Philosophers who de∣ny the Secondary Qualities any real Existence, should yet attribute it to the Primary. If there is no Difference between them, how can this be accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not my Business to account for every Opinion of the Philosophers. But a∣mong other Reasons which may be assigned for this, it seems probable, that Pleasure and Pain being rather annexed to the former, than the latter, may be one. Heat and Cold, Tastes, Smells, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than the Ideas of Extension, Figure, and Motion, affect us with. And, it being too visibly absurd to hold, that Pain or Pleasure can be in an un∣perceiving Substance, Men are more easily weaned from believing the external Existence of the Secondary, than the Primary Qualities. You will be satisfied there is something in this, if you recollect the Difference you made be∣tween an intense and more moderate Degree of Heat, allowing the one a real Existence, while you denied it to the other. But after all, there is no rational Ground for that Di∣stinction; for surely an indifferent Sensation is as truly <HI>a Sensation,</HI> as one more pleasing or painful; and, consequently, should not
<PB N="39" REF="52"/>
any more than they be supposed to exist in an unthinking Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is just come into my Head, <HI>Philo∣nous,</HI> that I have somewhere heard of a Di∣stinction between absolute and sensible Ex∣tension. Now, though it be acknowledged that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>small,</HI> consisting meerly in the Relation which other extended Beings have to the Parts of our own Bodies, do not re∣ally inhere in the Substances themselves, yet nothing obliges us to hold the same with re∣gard to <HI>absolute Extension,</HI> which is something abstracted from <HI>great</HI> and <HI>small,</HI> from this or that particular Magnitude or Figure. So likewise as to Motion, <HI>swift</HI> and <HI>slow</HI> are al∣together relative to the Succession of Ideas in our own Minds. But it does not follow, be∣cause those Modifications of Motion exist not without the Mind, that therefore absolute Motion abstracted from them does not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what is it that distinguishes one Motion, or Part of Extension, from another, is it not something sensible, as some Degree of Swiftness or Slowness, some certain Mag∣nitude or Figure peculiar to each?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>These Qualities, therefore, stripped of all sensible Properties, are without all spe∣cific and numerical Differences, as the Schools call them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="53"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to say, they are Extension in general, and Motion in general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is an universally received Maxim, that, <HI>Every thing which exists, is par∣ticular.</HI> How then can Motion in general, or Extension in general, exist in any corporeal Substance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will take time to solve your Diffi∣culty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I think the Point may be speedi∣ly decided. Without doubt you can tell, whether you are able to frame this or that Idea. Now, I am content to put our Dis∣pute on this Issue. If you can frame in your Thoughts a distinct abstract Idea of Motion or Extension, divested of all those sensible Modes, as swift and slow, great and small, round and square, and the like, which are acknowleged to exist only in the Mind, I will then yield the Point you contend for. But if you cannot, it will be unreasonable on your Side, to insist any longer upon what you have no Notion of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confess ingenuously, I cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you even separate the Ideas of Extension and Motion, from the Ideas of Light and Colours, hard and soft, hot and cold, with the rest of those Qualities which they who make the Distinction, term <HI>Secon∣dary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="54"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Is it not an easy Matter, to consider Extension and Motion by themselves, abstracted from all other sensible Qualities? Pray, how do the Mathematicians treat of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege, <HI>Hylas,</HI> it is not diffi∣cult to form general Propositions and Reason∣ings about those Qualities, without mention∣ing any other; and in this Sense, to consider or treat of them abstractedly. But, how does it follow, that because I can pronounce the Word <HI>Motion,</HI> by itself, I can form the Idea of it in my Mind exclusive of Body? or, be∣cause Theoremes may be made of Exten∣sion and Figures, without any mention of <HI>Great,</HI> or <HI>Small,</HI> or any other sensible Mode or Quality? That, therefore, it is possible such an abstract Idea of Extension, without any particular Size, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shou'd be di∣stinctly formed, and apprehended by the Mind? Mathematicians treat of Quantity, without regarding what other sensible Qualities it is attended with, as being altogether indifferent to their Demonstrations. But, when laying aside the Words, they contemplate the bare Ideas, I believe you will find, they are not the pure abstracted Ideas of Extension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what say you to <HI>pure Intellect?</HI> may not abstracted Ideas be framed by that Faculty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I cannot frame abstract Ideas at all, it is plain, I cannot frame them by the Help of <HI>pure Intellect,</HI> whatsoever Faculty you understand by those Words. Besides, not to inquire into the Nature of pure Intellect, and its spiritual Objects, as <HI>Vertue, Reason, God,</HI> or the like; thus much seems manifest, that sensible Things are only to be perceived by Sense, or represented by the Imagination. Figures, therefore, and Extension, being ori∣ginally perceived by Sense, do not belong to pure Intellect. But, for your farther Satisfaction, try if you can frame the Idea of any Figure, abstracted from all Particularities of Size, or even from other sensible Qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me think a little—I do not find that I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you think it possible, that shou'd really exist in Nature, which implies a Repugnancy in its Conception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since, therefore, it is impossible, even for the Mind, to disunite the Ideas of Exten∣sion and Motion from all other sensible Qua∣lities, does it not follow, that where the one exist, there, necessarily, the other exist likewise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It should seem so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, the very same Argu∣ments which you admitted, as conclusive a∣gainst the Secondary Qualities, are, without
<PB N="43" REF="56"/>
any farther Application of Force, against the Primary too. Besides, if you will trust your Sen∣ses; is it not plain, all sensible Qualities coexist, or, to them, appear as being in the same Place? Do they ever represent a Motion, or Figure, as being divested of all other visible and tangible Qualities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need say no more on this Head. I am free to own, if there be no secret Error, or Oversight, in our Proceedings hitherto, that all sensible Qualities are alike to be denied Existence without the Mind. But my Fear is, that I have been too liberal in my former Concessions, or overlooked some Fallacy or other. In short, I did not take time to think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that matter, <HI>Hylas,</HI> you may take what time you please, in reviewing the Pro∣gress of our Inquiry. You are at liberty to recover any Slips you might have made, or offer whatever you have omitted, which makes for your first Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>One great Oversight I take to be this: That I did not sufficiently distinguish the <HI>Object</HI> from the <HI>Sensation.</HI> Now, tho this lat∣ter may not exist without the Mind, yet it will not thence follow, that the former can∣not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Object do you mean? the Ob∣ject of the Senses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="57"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is then immediately perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make me to understand the Difference between what is immediately perceived, and a Sensation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Sensation I take to be an Act of the Mind perceiving; beside which, there is something perceived; and this I call the <HI>Ob∣ject.</HI> For Example, there is Red and Yellow on that Tulip. But then, the Act of percei∣ving those Colours is in me only, and not in the Tulip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Tulip do you speak of? is it that which you see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, what do you see, beside Colour, Figure, and Extension?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you would say then is, that the Red and Yellow are coexistent with the Ex∣tension; is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not all; I wou'd say, They have a real Existence without the Mind, in some unthinking Substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the Colours are really in the Tulip which I see, is manifest. Neither can it be denied, that this Tulip may exist inde∣pendent of your Mind, or mine; but that any immediate Object of the Senses, <HI>i. e.</HI> any Idea, or Combination of Ideas, should exist in an unthinking Substance, or exterior to all
<PB N="45" REF="58"/>
Minds, is in itself an evident Contradiction. Nor can I imagine how this follows, from what you said just now, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Red and Yellow were on the Tulip <HI>you saw,</HI> since you do not pretend to <HI>see</HI> that unthinking Substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have an artful way, <HI>Philonous,</HI> of diverting our Inquiry from the Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you have no mind to be pres∣sed that way. To return then to your Di∣stinction between <HI>Sensation</HI> and <HI>Object;</HI> if I take you right, you distinguish in every Per∣ception two things, the one an Action of the Mind, the other not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this Action cannot exist in, or belong to any unthinking thing; but, what∣ever beside is implied in a Perception, may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my Meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that if there was a Perception without any Act of the Mind, it were possi∣ble such a Perception should exist in an un∣thinking Substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it. But it is impossible there should be such a Perception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When is the Mind said to be active?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>When it produces, puts an end to, or changes any thing.</P>
</SP>

<P>Can the Mind produce, discontinue, or change any thing but by an Act of the Will?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Mind, therefore, is to be accoun∣ted active in its Perceptions, so far forth as Volition is included in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In plucking this Flower, I am active, because I do it by the Motion of my Hand, which was consequent upon my Volition; so likewise, in applying it to my Nose. But, is either of these Smelling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I act too, in drawing the Air thro my Nose; because my Breathing so, rather than otherwise, is the Effect of my Volition. But, neither can this be called <HI>Smelling:</HI> For if it were, I shou'd smell every time I brea∣thed in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smelling then is somewhat conse∣quent to all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I do not find my Will concer∣ned any farther. Whatever more there is, as that I perceive such a particular Smell, or any Smell at all, this is independent of my Will, and therein I am altogether passive. Do you find it otherwise with you, <HI>Hylas?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the very same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, as to Seeing, is it not in your Power to open your Eyes, or keep them shut; to turn them this, or that way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does it, in like manner, depend on your Will, that in looking on this Flower, you perceive <HI>White</HI> rather than any other Co∣lour? or, directing your open Eyes toward yonder Part of the Heaven, can you avoid seeing the Sun? or, is Light or Darkness the Effect of your Volition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are then, in these Respects, alto∣gether Passive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me now, whether <HI>Seeing</HI> con∣sists in perceiving Light and Colours, or in opening and turning the Eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, in the former.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since, therefore, you are in the very Perception of Light and Colours altogether passive, what is become of that Action you were speaking of, as an Ingredient in every Sensation? And, does it not follow from your own Concessions, that the Perception of Light and Colours, including no Action in it, may exist in an unperceiving Substance? And, is not this a plain Contradiction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, since you distinguish the <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Passive</HI> in every Perception, you must do it in that of Pain. But, how is it possible, that Pain, be it as little active as you please, should exist in an unperceiving Sub∣stance?
<PB N="48" REF="61"/>
In short, do but consider the Point, and then confess ingenuously, whether Light, and Colours, Tastes, Sounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not all equally Passions, or Sensations in the Soul. You may, indeed, call them <HI>external Objects,</HI> and give them in Words what Subsistence you please. But examine your own Thoughts, and then tell me, whether it be not as I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege, <HI>Philonous,</HI> that upon a fair Observation of what passes in my Mind, I can discover nothing else, but that I am a thinking Being, affected with Variety of Sen∣sations; neither is it possible to conceive, how a Sensation should exist in an unperceiving Sub∣stance. But then, on the other hand, when I look on sensible Things in a different View, considering them as so many Modes and Qua∣lities, I find it necessary to suppose a material <HI>Substratum,</HI> without which they cannot be conceived to exist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Material Substratum</HI> call you it? Pray, by which of your Senses came you acquain∣ted with that Being?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not itself sensible; its Modes and Qualities only being perceived by the Sen∣ses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I presume then, it was by Reflexion and Reason you obtained the Idea of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend to any proper, po∣sitive Idea of it. However, I conclude it exists, because Qualities cannot be conceived to exist without a Support.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="49" REF="62"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then you have only a rela∣tive Notion of it, or that you conceive it not otherwise than by conceiving the Relation it bears to sensible Qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be pleased therefore to let me know wherein that Relation consists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not sufficiently expressed in the Term <HI>Substratum,</HI> or <HI>Substance?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, the Word <HI>Substratum</HI> should import, that it is spread under the sensible Qualities or Accidents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And consequently under Extension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, therefore, somewhat in its own Nature intirely distinct from Extension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Extension is only a Mode, and Matter is something that supports Modes. And is it not evident the Thing supported is different from the thing supporting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that something distinct from, and exclusive of, Extension, is supposed to be the <HI>Substratum</HI> of Extension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Answer me, <HI>Hylas.</HI> Can a thing be spread without Extension: or is not the Idea of Extension necessarily included in <HI>Spread∣ing?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="50" REF="63"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatsoever, therefore, you suppose spread under any thing, must have in itself an Extension distinct from the Extension of that Thing under which it is spread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently every corporeal Sub∣stance, being the <HI>Substratum</HI> of Extension, must have in itself another Extension by which it is qualified to be a <HI>Substratum:</HI> And so on to Infinity. And I ask whether this be not absurd in itself, and repugnant to what you granted just now, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Substra∣tum</HI> was something distinct from, and exclu∣sive of, Extension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you take me wrong. I do not mean that Matter is <HI>spread</HI> in a gross literal Sense under Extension. The Word <HI>Substratum</HI> is used only to express, in general, the same thing with <HI>Substance.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let us examine the Rela∣tion implied in the Term <HI>Substance.</HI> Is it not that it stands under Accidents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that one thing may stand under, or support another, must it not be extended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not therefore this Supposition lia∣ble to the same Absurdity with the former?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You still take Things in a strict lite∣ral Sense: That is not fair, <HI>Philonous.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="51" REF="64"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not for imposing any Sense on your Words: You are at Liberty to explain them as you please. Only I beseech you, make me understand something by them. You tell me, Matter supports or stands under Accidents. How! is it as your Legs support your Body?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; that is the literal Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let me know any Sense, literal or not literal, that you understand it in.—How long must I wait for an Answer, <HI>Hy∣las?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare I know not what to say. I once thought I understood well enough what was meant by Matter's supporting Accidents. But now the more I think on it, the less can I comprehend it; in short, I find that I know nothing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then you have no Idea at all, neither relative nor positive of Matter; you know neither what it is in itself, nor what Relation it bears to Accidents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you asserted, that you could not conceive, how Qualities or Accidents should really exist, without conceiving at the same time a material Support of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to say, when you conceive the real Existence of Qualities, you do with∣al
<PB N="52" REF="65"/>
conceive something which you cannot con∣ceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was wrong I own. But still I fear there is some Fallacy or other. Pray what think you of this? It is just come into my Head, that the Ground of all our Mistake lies in your treating of each Quality by it∣self. Now, I grant that each Quality cannot singly subsist without the Mind. Colour can∣not without Extension, neither can Figure without some other sensible Quality. But, as the several Qualities united or blended toge∣ther form intire sensible Things, nothing hinders why such things may not be supposed to exist without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either, <HI>Hylas,</HI> you are jesting, or have a very bad Memory. Though, indeed, we went through all the Qualities by Name, one after another; yet my Arguments, or ra∣ther your Concessions, no where tended to prove, that the Secondary Qualities did not subsist each alone by itself, but, that they were not <HI>at all</HI> without the Mind. Indeed, in treating of Figure and Motion, we con∣cluded, they could not exist without the Mind, because it was impossible, even in Thought, to separate them from all Secon∣dary Qualities, so as to conceive them exist∣ing by themselves. But then this was not the only Argument made Use of upon that Occasion. But (to pass by all that hath been
<PB N="53" REF="66"/>
hitherto said, and reckon it for nothing, if you will have it so) I am content to put the whole upon this Issue. If you can conceive it possible for any Mixture or Combination of Qualities, or any sensible Object whatever, to exist without the Mind, then I will grant it actually to be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it comes to that, the Point will soon be decided. What more easy than to conceive a Tree or House existing by itself, independent of, and unperceived by, any Mind whatsoever? I do, at this present time, con∣ceive them existing after that Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How say you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> can you see a thing which is at the same time unseen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that were a Contradiction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not as great a Contradiction to talk of <HI>conceiving</HI> a thing which is <HI>uncon∣ceived?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Tree or House, therefore, which you think of, is conceived by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How should it be otherwise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is conceived, is surely in the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without Question, that which is con∣ceived is in the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then came you to say, you con∣ceived a House or Tree existing independent and out of all Minds whatsoever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="54" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was, I own, an Oversight; but stay, let me consider what led me into it.—It is a pleasant Mistake enough. As I was thinking of a Tree in a solitary Place, where no one was present to see it, methought that was to conceive a Tree as existing unperceived or unthought of, not considering that I my∣self conceived it all the while. But now I plainly see, that all I can do is to frame Ideas in my own Mind. I may, indeed, conceive in my own Thoughts the Idea of a Tree, or a House, or a Mountain, but that is all. And this is far from proving, that I can conceive them <HI>existing out of the Minds of all Spirits.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You acknowlege then that you cannot possibly conceive, how any one corporeal sen∣sible Thing should exist otherwise than in a Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, you will earnestly contend for the Truth of that which you cannot so much as conceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I profess I know not what to think, but still there are some Scruples remain with me. Is it not certain, I see Things at a Di∣stance; do we not perceive the Stars and Moon, for Example, to be a great way off? Is not this, I say, manifest to the Senses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not in a Dream too perceive those or the like Objects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="68"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have they not then the same Ap∣pearance of being distant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you do not thence conclude the Apparitions in a Dream to be without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You ought not, therefore, to conclude that sensible Objects are without the Mind from their Appearance, or Manner wherein they are perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it. But doth not my Sense deceive me in those Cases?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no Means. The Idea or Thing which you immediately perceive, neither Sense nor Reason informs you that it actually exists without the Mind. By Sense you only know that you are affected with such certain Sensations of Light and Colours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And these you will not say are without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. But beside all that, do you not think the Sight suggests something of <HI>Out∣ness</HI> or <HI>Distance?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon approaching a distant Object, do the visible Size and Figure change perpe∣tually, or do they appear the same at all Distances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are in a continual Change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sight therefore does not suggest, or any way inform you, that the visible Object you immediately perceive exists at a Distance,
<PB N="56" REF="69"/>
or will be perceived when you advance far∣ther onward, there being a continued Series of visible Objects succeeding each other, du∣ring the whole Time of your Approach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does not; but still I know, upon seeing an Object, what Object I shall perceive after having passed over a certain Distance: No matter whether it be exactly the same or no: There is still something of Distance sug∣gested in the Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good <HI>Hylas,</HI> do but reflect a little on the Point, and then tell me whether there be any more in it than this. From the Ideas you actually perceive by Sight, you have by Ex∣perience learned to collect what other Ideas you will (according to the standing Order of Nature) be affected with, after such a certain Succession of Time and Motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the Whole, I take it to be no∣thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, is it not plain, that if we sup∣pose a Man born blind was on a sudden made to see, he could at first have no Experience of what may be suggested by Sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would not then, according to you, have any Notion of Distance annexed to the Things he saw; but would take them for a new Sett of Sensations existing only in his Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is undeniable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to make it still more plain: is not <HI>Distance</HI> a Line turned endwise to the Eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, can a Line, so situated, be per∣ceived by Sight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does it not, therefore, follow, that Distance is not properly and immediately perceived by Sight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It should seem so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, is it your Opinion, that Co∣lours are at a Distance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be acknowleged, they are on∣ly in the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, do not Colours appear to the Eye as coexisting in the same place with Extension and Figures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you then conclude from Sight, that Figures exist without, when you acknowlege Colours do not; the sensible Appearance being the very same with regard to both?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, allowing that Distance was tru∣ly and immediately perceived by the Mind, yet it wou'd not thence follow, it existed out of the Mind. For, whatever is imme∣diately perceived, is an Idea: And, can any <HI>Idea</HI> exist out of the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To suppose that, were absurd. But inform me, <HI>Philonous,</HI> can we perceive, or know nothing beside our Ideas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for the rational deducing of Cau∣ses from Effects, that is beside our Inquiry. And by the Senses, you can best tell, whe∣ther you perceive any thing, which is not im∣mediately perceived. And I ask you, whe∣ther the Things immediately perceived, are other than your own Sensations, or Ideas? You have, indeed, more than once, in the Course of this Conversation, expressed your∣self on those Points; but you seem, by this last Question, to have departed from what you then thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To speak the truth, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I think there are two Kinds of Objects, the one per∣ceived immediately, which are likewise cal∣led <HI>Ideas;</HI> the other are real Things, or ex∣ternal Objects, perceived by the Mediation of Ideas, which are their Images and Repre∣sentations. Now I own, Ideas cannot exist without the Mind; but the latter sort of Ob∣jects do. I am sorry I did not think of this Distinction sooner; it would, probably, have cut short your Discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are those external Objects perceived by Sense, or by some other Faculty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are perceived by Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! Is there any thing perceived by Sense, which is not immediately percei∣ved?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="59" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Philonous,</HI> in some sort there is. For Example, when I look on a Picture, or Statue of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> I may be said, after a manner, to perceive him (tho' not imme∣diately) by my Senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then, you will have our Ideas, which alone are immediately percei∣ved, to be Pictures of external Things: And, that these also, are perceived by Sense, inas∣much as they have a Conformity or Resem∣blance to our Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my Meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, in the same way that <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> in himself invisible, is, nevertheless, perceived by Sight; real Things, in them∣selves imperceptible, are perceived by Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the very same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> when you behold the Picture of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> do you see with your Eyes any more than some Colours and Fi∣gures, with a certain Symmetry and Compo∣sition of the whole?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And wou'd not a Man, who had ne∣ver known any thing of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> see as much?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>He wou'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, he hath his Sight, and the Use of it, in as perfect a Degree as you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="73"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whence comes it then, that your Thoughts are directed to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, and his are not? This cannot proceed from the Sensations, or Ideas of Sense, by you then perceived; since you acknowlege, you have no Advantage over him in that respect. It should seem, therefore, to proceed from Reason and Memory: shou'd it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shou'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, it will not follow from that Instance, that any thing is perceived by Sense, which is not immediately perceived. Tho' I grant, we may, in one Acceptation, be said to perceive sensible Things mediately by Sense: That is, when from a frequently per∣ceived Connexion, the immediate Perception of Ideas by one Sense, suggests to the Mind others, perhaps belonging to another Sense, which are wont to be connected with them. For instance, when I hear a Coach drive along the Streets, immediately I perceive only the Sound; but from the Experience I have had, that such a Sound is connected with a Coach, I am said to hear the Coach. It is, neverthe∣less, evident, that, in Truth and Strictness, nothing can be <HI>heard</HI> but <HI>Sound:</HI> And the Coach is not then properly perceived by Sense, but suggested from Experience. So likewise, when we are said to see a red-hot Bar of Iron; the Solidity and Heat of the Iron are not the Objects of Sight, but suggested to the
<PB N="61" REF="74"/>
Imagination by the Colour and Figure, which are properly perceived by that Sense. In short, those things alone are actually perceived by any Sense, which would have been perceived, in case that same Sense had then been first conferred on us. As for other things, it is plain, they are only suggested to the Mind by Experience, grounded on former Percep∣tions. But, to return to your Comparison of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Picture, it is plain, if you keep to that, you must hold, the real Things, or Arche∣types of our Ideas, are not perceived by Sense, but by some internal Faculty of the Soul, as Reason, or Memory. I wou'd, therefore, fain know, what Arguments you can draw from Reason, for the Existence of what you call <HI>real Things,</HI> or <HI>material Objects.</HI> Or, whe∣ther you remember to have seen them former∣ly, as they are in themselves; or, if you have heard, or read of any one that did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you are disposed to Raillery; but that will never convince me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Aim is only to learn from you, the way to come at the Knowlege of those <HI>material Beings.</HI> Whatever we perceive, is perceived, either immediately, or mediately: By Sense, or by Reason and Reflexion. But, as you have excluded Sense, pray, shew me what Reason you have to believe their Exi∣stence; or, what <HI>medium</HI> you can possibly make use of, to prove it either to mine, or your own Understanding.</P>

<PB N="62" REF="75"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal ingenuously, <HI>Philonous,</HI> now I consider the Point, I do not find I can give you any good Reason for it. But, thus much seems pretty plain, that it is at least possible, such things may really exist. And as long as there is no Absurdity in supposing them, I am resolved to believe as I did, till you bring good Reasons to the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Is it come to this, that you only believe the Existence of material Ob∣jects, and that your Belief is founded barely on the Possibility of its being true? Then you will have me bring Reasons against it: Tho another would think it reasonable, the Proof should lie on him, who holds the Affir∣mative, And after all, this very Point which you are now resolved to maintain, without any Reason, is, in effect, what you have, more than once, during this Discourse, seen good Reason to give up. But to pass over all this; if I understand you rightly, you say, our Ideas do not exist without the Mind; but that they are Copies, Images, or Representations of certain Originals, that do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You take me right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are then like external Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have those Things a stable and per∣manent Nature independent of our Senses; or are they in a perpetual Change, upon our producing any Motions in our Bodies, sus∣pending,
<PB N="63" REF="76"/>
exerting, or altering our Faculties or Organs of Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Real Things, it is plain, have a fixed and real Nature, which remains the same, notwithstanding any Change in our Senses, or in the Posture and Motion of our Bodies; which, indeed, may affect the Ideas in our Minds, but it were absurd to think they had the same Effect on Things existing without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then is it possible, that Things perpetually fleeting and variable, as our Ideas, should be Copies or Images of any thing fixed and constant? Or, in other Words, since all sensible Qualities, as Size, Figure, Colour, <HI>&amp;c. i. e.</HI> our Ideas, are continually changing upon every Alteration in the Di∣stance, Medium, or Instruments of Sensa∣tion; how can any determinate material Ob∣ject be properly represented or painted forth by several distinct Things, each of which is so different from and unlike the rest? Or, if you say, it resembles some one only of our Ideas, how shall we be able to distinguish the true Copy from all the false ones?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I profess, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I am at a Loss. I know not what to say to this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But neither is this all. Which are material Objects in themselves, Perceptible or Imperceptible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="77"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but Ideas. All material Things, therefore, are in themselves insensi∣ble, and to be perceived only by their Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ideas then are sensible, and their Ar∣chetypes or Originals insensible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can that which is sensible be like that which is insensible? Can a real thing in itself <HI>invisible,</HI> be like a <HI>Colour;</HI> or a real thing which is not <HI>audible,</HI> be like a <HI>Sound?</HI> In a word; Can any thing be like a Sensa∣tion or Idea, but another Sensation or Idea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own, I think not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible there should be any Doubt in the Point? Do you not perfectly know your own Ideas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know them perfectly; since what I do not perceive, or know, can be no Part of my Idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, therefore, and examine them, and then tell me if there be any thing in them which can exist without the Mind: or if you can conceive any thing like them existing without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon Inquiry, I find it is impossible for me to conceive or understand how any thing but an Idea can be like an Idea. And it is most evident, that <HI>no Idea can exist with∣out the Mind.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are, therefore, by your Prin∣ciples, forced to deny the Reality of sensible Things, since you made it to consist in an ab∣solute Existence, exterior to the Mind. That is to say, you are a downright <HI>Sceptic.</HI> So I have gained my Point, which was to shew, your Principles led to Scepticism.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the present I am, if not intirely convinced, at least silenced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd fain know what more you wou'd require in order to a perfect Con∣viction. Have you not had the Liberty of ex∣plaining yourself all manner of ways? Were any little Slips in Discourse laid hold and in∣sisted on? Or were you not allowed to retract or reinforce any thing you had offered, as best served your Purpose? Has not every thing you could say been heard and examined with all the Fairness imaginable? In a word, have you not in every Point been convinced out of your own Mouth? And if you can at present discover any Flaw in any of your former Con∣cessions, or think of any remaining Subter∣fuge, any new Distinction, Colour, or Com∣ment whatsoever, why do you not produce it?</P>

<P>A little Patience, <HI>Philonous.</HI> I am at present so amazed to see myself ensnared, and as it were imprisoned, in the Labyrinths you have drawn me into, that on the suddain it cannot be expected I should find my Way

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> BEG your Pardon, <HI>Phi∣lonous,</HI> for not meeting you sooner. All this Morning my Head was so filled with our late Conversation, that I had not Leisure to think of the Time of the Day, or, indeed, of any thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philonous.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you were so intent upon it, in Hopes if there were any Mistakes in your Concessions, or Fallacies in my Rea∣sonings from them, you will now discover them to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, I have done nothing ever since I saw you, but search after Mistakes and Fallacies, and with that View have minutely examined the whole Series of Yesterday's Discourse: but all in vain, for the Notions it led me into, upon Review, appear still more
<PB N="68" REF="81"/>
clear and evident; and the more I consider them, the more irresistibly do they force my Assent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not this, think you, a Sign that they are genuine, that they proceed from Nature, and are conformable to right Rea∣son? Truth and Beauty are in this alike, that the nicest Survey sets them both off to Advan∣tage. Whilst the false Lustre of Error and Disguise cannot endure being review'd, or too nearly inspected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own there is a great deal in what you say. Nor can any one be more intirely satisfied of the Truth of those od Conse∣quences, so long as I have in View the Rea∣sonings that lead to them. But when these are out of my Thoughts, there seems, on the other hand, something so satisfactory, so na∣tural and intelligible in the modern Way of explaining things, that I profess I know not how to reject it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what Way you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean the Way of accounting for our Sensations or Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is supposed the Soul makes her Re∣sidence in some Part of the Brain, from which the Nerves take their Rise, and are thence extended to all Parts of the Body. And that outward Objects, by the different Impressions they make on the Organs of Sense, communi∣cate
<PB N="69" REF="82"/>
certain vibrative Motions to the Nerves, and these being filled with Spirits, propagate them to the Brain or Seat of the Soul, which, according to the various Impressions or Traces thereby made in the Brain, is variously affect∣ed with Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And call you this an Explication of the Manner whereby we are affected with Ideas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, <HI>Philonous,</HI> have you any thing to object against it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd first know whether I rightly understand your Hypothesis. You make cer∣tain Traces in the Brain to be the Causes or Occasions of our Ideas. Pray tell me, whe∣ther by the <HI>Brain</HI> you mean any sensible Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else think you I cou'd mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sensible Things are all immediately perceivable; and those Things which are im∣mediately perceivable, are Ideas; and these exist only in the Mind. Thus much you have, if I mistake not, long since agreed to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Brain, therefore, you speak of, being a sensible Thing, exists only in the Mind. Now, I wou'd fain know whether you think it reasonable to suppose, that one Idea or Thing existing in the Mind, occasions all other Ideas. And if you think so, pray
<PB N="70" REF="83"/>
how do you account for the Origine of that Primary Idea or Brain itself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not explain the Origine of our Ideas by that Brain which is perceivable to Sense, this being itself only a Combination of sensible Ideas, but by another which I imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, are not Things imagined as truly in the Mind as Things perceived?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It comes therefore to the same thing; and you have been all the while accounting for Ideas, by certain Motions or Impressions in the Brain, <HI>i. e.</HI> by some Alterations in an Idea, whether sensible or imaginable, it mat∣ters not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to suspect my Hypothesis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beside Spirits, all that we know or conceive, are our own Ideas. When, there∣fore, you say, all Ideas are occasioned by Impressions in the Brain, do you conceive this Brain or no? If you do, then you talk of Ideas imprinted in an Idea, causing that same Idea, which is absurd. If you do not conceive it, you talk unintelligibly, instead of forming a reasonable Hypothesis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now clearly see it was a meer Dream. There is nothing in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not be much concerned at it: for, after all, this way of explaining Things, as you called it, could never have
<PB N="71" REF="84"/>
satisfied any reasonable Man. What Con∣nexion is there between a Motion in the Nerves, and the Sensations of Sound or Co∣lour in the Mind? or how is it possible these should be the Effect of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I cou'd never think it had so little in it, as now it seems to have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, are you at length satis∣fied that no sensible Things have a real Exi∣stence; and that you are in truth an errant <HI>Sceptic?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too plain to be denied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look! are not the Fields covered with a delightful Verdure? Is there not some∣thing in the Woods and Groves, in the Ri∣vers and clear Springs, that sooths, that sof∣tens, that transports the Soul? At the Pro∣spect of the wide and deep Ocean, or some huge Mountain whose Top is lost in the Sky, or of an old gloomy Forrest, are not our Minds filled with a pleasing Horror? Even in Rocks and Deserts, is there not an agreeable Wildness? How sincere a Pleasure is it to behold the natural Beauties of the Earth! To preserve and renew our Relish for them, is not the Veil of Night alternate∣ly drawn over her Face, and does she not change her Dress with the Seasons? How aptly are the Elements disposed? What Va∣riety and Use in Stones and Minerals? What Delicacy, what Beauty, what Contrivance,
<PB N="72" REF="85"/>
in animal and vegetable Bodies? How ex∣quisitely are all things suited, as well to their particular Ends, as to constitute appo∣site Parts of the Whole! And while they mutu∣ally aid and support, do they not also set off and illustrate each other? Raise now your Thoughts from this Ball of Earth, to all those glorious Luminaries that adorn the high Arch of Heaven. The Motion and Situation of the Planets, are they not admirable for Use and Order? Were those (miscalled <HI>Erratique)</HI> Globes once known to stray, in their repeated Journeys thorow the pathless Void? Do they not measure Areas round the Sun, ever proportioned to the Times? So fixed, so im∣mutable are the Laws by which the unseen Author of Nature actuates the Universe. How vivid and radiant is the Lustre of the fixed Stars! How magnificent and rich that negli∣gent Profusion, with which they appear to be scattered thorow the whole Azure Vault! Yet, if you take the Telescope, it brings into your Sight a new Host of Stars that escape the naked Eye. Here they seem contiguous and minute, but, to a nearer View, immense Orbs of Light at various Distances far sunk in the Abyss of Space. Now, you must call Imagination to your Aid. The feeble, nar∣row Sense, cannot descry innumerable Worlds revolving round the central Fires; and, in those Worlds, the Energy of an all-perfect
<PB N="73" REF="86"/>
Mind display'd in endless Forms. But, nei∣ther Sense nor Imagination are big enough, to comprehend the boundless Extent, with all its dazzling Furniture. Tho the labor∣ing Mind exert and strain each Power to its utmost Reach, there still stands our ungrasped, a Surplusage immeasurable. Yet all the vast Bodies that compose this mighty Frame, how distant and remote soever, are by some se∣cret Mechanism, some divine Art and Force, linked in a mutual Dependence and Inter∣course with each other, even with this Earth, which almost slipt from my Thoughts, and was lost in the Croud of Worlds. Is not the whole System immense, beautiful, glorious, beyond Expression and beyond Thought! What treatment then do those Philosophers deserve, who wou'd deprive these noble and delightful Scenes of all Reality? How shou'd those Principles be entertained, that lead us to think all the visible Beauty of the Creation a false imaginary Glare? To be plain, can you expect this Scepticism of yours will not be thought extravagantly absurd by all Men of Sense?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Other Men may think as they please: But for your Part, you have nothing to re∣proach me with. My Comfort is, you are as much a <HI>Sceptic</HI> as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, <HI>Hylas,</HI> I must beg Leave to differ from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="87"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Have you all along agreed to the Premises, and do you now deny the Conclusion, and leave me to maintain those Paradoxes by myself which you led me into? This, surely, is not fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny that I agreed with you in those Notions that led to Scepticism. You, indeed, said, the Reality of sensible Things consisted in an <HI>absolute Existence</HI> out of the Minds of Spirits, or distinct from their being perceived. And pursuant to this Notion of Reality, you are obliged to deny sensible Things any real Existence: That is, accor∣ding to your own Definition, you profess yourself a <HI>Sceptic.</HI> But I neither said nor thought, the Reality of sensible Things was to be defined after that Manner. To me it is evident, for the Reasons you allow of, that sensible Things cannot exist otherwise than in a Mind or Spirit. Whence I conclude, not that they have no real Existence, but that see∣ing they depend not on my Thought, and have an Existence distinct from being percei∣ved by me, <HI>there must be some other Mind wherein they exist.</HI> As sure, therefore, as the sensible World really exists, so sure is there an infinite omnipresent Spirit who contains and supports it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! This is no more than I and all Christians hold; nay, and all others too
<PB N="75" REF="88"/>
who believe there is a God, and that he knows and comprehends all Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but here lies the Difference. Men commonly believe that all Things are known or perceived by God, because they believed the Being of a God, whereas I, on the other side, immediately and necessarily conclude the Being of a God, because all sensible Things must be perceived by Him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But so long as we all believe the same thing, what matter is it how we come by that Belief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But neither do we agree in the same Opinion. For Philosophers, tho they ac∣knowlege all corporeal Beings to be perceived by God, yet they attribute to them an abso∣lute Subsistence distinct from their being per∣ceived by any Mind whatever, which I do not. Besides, is there no Difference between say∣ing, <HI>There is a God, therefore he perceives all Things:</HI> and saying, <HI>Sensible Things do really exist: and if they really exist, they are neces∣sarily perceived by an infinite Mind: therefore there is an infinite Mind, or God.</HI> This fur∣nishes you with a direct and immediate De∣monstration, from a most evident Principle, of the <HI>Being of a God.</HI> Divines and Philoso∣phers had proved, beyond all Controversy, from the Beauty and Usefulness of the several Parts of the Creation, that it was the Work∣manship of God. But that, setting aside all
<PB N="76" REF="89"/>
Help of Astronomy and natural Philosophy, all Contemplation of the Contrivance, Order, and Adjustment of Things, an infinite Mind should be necessarily inferred from the bare Existence of the sensible World, is an Advan∣tage peculiar to them only who have made this easy Reflexion: That the sensible World is that which we perceive by our several Senses; and that nothing is perceived by the Senses beside Ideas; and that no Idea, or Ar∣chetype of an Idea, can exist otherwise than in a Mind. You may now, without any labori∣ous Search into the Sciences, without any Subtilty of Reason, or tedious Length of Dis∣course, oppose and baffle the most strenuous Advocate for Atheism. Those miserable Re∣fuges, whether in an eternal Succession of unthinking Causes and Effects, or in a for∣tuitous Concourse of Atoms; those wild Imaginations of <HI>Vanini, Hobbes,</HI> and <HI>Spino∣sa;</HI> in a word, the whole System of Atheism, is it not intirely overthrown, by this single Reflexion on the Repugnancy included in supposing the Whole, or any Part, even the most rude and shapeless of the visible World, to exist without a Mind? Let any one of those Abettors of Impiety but look into his own Thoughts, and there try if he can con∣ceive how so much as a Rock, a Desert, a Chaos, or confused Jumble of Atoms; how any thing at all, either sensible or imagina∣ble,
<PB N="77" REF="90"/>
can exist independent of a Mind, and he need go no farther to be convinced of his Folly. Can any thing be fairer than to put a Dispute on such an Issue, and leave it to a Man himself to see if he can conceive, even in Thought, what he holds to be true in Fact, and from a Notional to allow it a Real Existence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot be denied, there is some∣thing highly serviceable to Religion in what you advance. But do you not think it looks very like a Notion entertained by some emi∣nent Moderns, of <HI>seeing all things in God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd gladly know that Opinion; pray explain it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They conceive that the Soul, being im∣material, is incapable of being united with material Things, so as to perceive them in themselves, but that she perceives them by her Union with the Substance of God, which being spiritual, is therefore purely intelligible, or capable of being the immediate Object of a Spirit's Thought. Besides, the Divine Es∣sence contains in it Perfections correspondent to each created Being; and which are, for that Reason, proper to exhibit or represent them to the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand how our Ideas, which are Things altogether passive and inert, can be the Essence, or any Part (or like any Part) of the Essence or Substance of God, who is an impassive, indivisible, purely active
<PB N="78" REF="91"/>
Being. Many more Difficulties and Obje∣ctions there are, which occur at first View a∣gainst this Hypothesis; but I shall only add, that it is liable to all the Absurdities of the common Hypotheses, in making a created World exist otherwise than in the Mind of a Spirit. Beside all which it has this peculiar to itself; that it makes that material World serve to no Purpose. And if it pass for a good Argument against other Hypotheses in the Sciences, that they suppose Nature or the Divine Wisdom to make something in vain, or do that by tedious round-about Methods, which might have been performed in a much more easy and compendious way, what shall we think of that Hypothesis which supposes the whole World made in vain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what say you, are not you too of Opinion that we see all Things in God? If I mistake not, what you advance comes near it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intirely agree with what the Holy Scripture saith, <HI>That in God we live, and move, and have our Being.</HI> But that we see Things in his Essence after the manner above set forth, I am far from believing. Take here in brief my Meaning. It is evident that the Things I perceive are my own Ideas, and that no Idea can exist, unless it be in a Mind. Nor is it less plain that these Ideas or Things by me perceived, either themselves or their Archetypes exist independently of my Mind,
<PB N="79" REF="92"/>
since I know myself not to be their Author, it being out of my Power to determine at Pleasure, what particular Ideas I shall be af∣fected with upon opening my Eyes or Ears. They must therefore exist in some other Mind, whose Will it is they should be exhi∣bited to me. The Things, I say, immedi∣ately perceived, are Ideas or Sensations, call them which you will. But how can any Idea or Sensation exist in, or be produced by, any thing but a Mind or Spirit? This, indeed, is inconceivable: and to assert that which is inconceivable, is to talk Nonsense: Is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But on the other hand, it is very con∣ceivable that they should exist in, and be pro∣duced by, a Spirit; since this is no more than I daily experience in myself, inasmuch as I perceive numberless Ideas; and by an Act of my Will can form a great Variety of them, and raise them up in my Imagination: Tho' it must be confessed, these Creatures of the Fancy are not altogether so distinct, so strong, vivid, and permanent, as those perceived by my Senses, which latter are called <HI>Real Things.</HI> From all which I conclude, <HI>there is a Mind which affects me every Moment with all the sensible Impressions I perceive.</HI> And from the Variety, Order, and Manner of these, I conclude the Author of them to be <HI>wise, powerful, and good, beyond Comprehension.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="93"/>
Mark it well; I do not say, I see Things by perceiving that which represents them in the intelligible Substance of God. This I do not understand; but I say, The Things by me perceived are known by the Understanding, and produced by the Will, of an infinite Spirit. And is not all this most plain and evident? Is there any more in it, than what a little Observation of our own Minds, and that which passes in them not only enables us to conceive, but also obliges us to acknow∣lege?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I understand you very clearly; and own the Proof you give of a Deity seems no less evident, than it is surprizing. But allowing that God is the supreme and Universal Cause of all Things, yet may not there still be a Third Nature beside Spirits and Ideas? May we not admit a subordinate and limited Cause of our Ideas? In a word, may there not for all that be <HI>Matter?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often must I inculcate the same thing? You allow the Things immediately perceived by Sense to exist no where without the Mind: But there is nothing perceived by Sense, which is not perceived immediately: therefore there is nothing sensible that exists without the Mind. The Matter, therefore, which you still insist on, is something intelli∣gible, I suppose; something that may be dis∣covered by Reason, and not by Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="81" REF="94"/>

<P>Pray, let me know what Reasoning your Belief of Matter is grounded on; and what this Matter is in your present Sense of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find myself affected with various Ideas, whereof, I know, I am not the Cause; neither are they the Cause of themselves, or of one another, or capable of subsisting by themselves, as being altogether inactive, fleet∣ing, dependent Beings. They have, there∣fore, some Cause distinct from me and them: Of which I pretend to know no more, than that it is <HI>the Cause of my Ideas.</HI> And this thing, whatever it be, I call <HI>Matter.</HI></P>

<P>Tell me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> has every one a Li∣berty to change the current, proper Signifi∣cation, annexed to a common Name in any Language? For Example, suppose a Tra∣veller shou'd tell you, that, in a certain Coun∣try, Men might pass unhurt thorow the Fire; and, upon explaining himself, you found he meant by the Word <HI>Fire</HI> that which others call <HI>Water:</HI> Or, if he shou'd assert, there are Trees which walk upon two Legs, meaning Men by the Term <HI>Trees.</HI> Wou'd you think this reasonable?</P>

<P>No; I shou'd think it very absurd. Common Custom is the Standard of Pro∣priety in Language. And for any Man to affect speaking improperly, is to pervert the Use of Speech, and can never serve to a
<PB N="82" REF="95"/>
better purpose, than to protract and multi∣ply Disputes where there is no Difference in Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And does not <HI>Matter,</HI> in the com∣mon current Acceptation of the Word, signi∣fy an extended, solid, moveable, unthinking, inactive Substance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has it not been made evident, that no such Substance can possibly exist? And tho it shou'd be allowed to exist, yet how can that which is <HI>inactive</HI> be a <HI>Cause;</HI> or that which is <HI>unthinking</HI> be a <HI>Cause of Thought?</HI> You may, indeed, if you please, annex to the Word <HI>Matter,</HI> a contrary Meaning to what is vulgarly received; and tell me, you un∣derstand by it, an unextended, thinking, active Being, which is the Cause of our Ideas. But what else is this, than to play with Words, and run into that very Fault you just now condemned with so much Reason? I do by no means find fault with your Reasoning, in that you collect a Cause from the <HI>Phaenomena.</HI> But I deny, that the Cause deducible by Rea∣son, can properly be termed <HI>Matter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is, indeed, something in what you say. But I am afraid, you do not tho∣rowly comprehend my Meaning. I wou'd by no means be thought to deny, that God, or an Infinite Spirit, is the Supreme Cause of all things. All I contend for, is, that sub∣ordinate
<PB N="83" REF="96"/>
to the Supreme Agent, there is a Cause of a limited and inferior Nature, which concurs in the Production of our Ideas, not by any Act of Will, or Spiritual Efficiency, but by that Kind of Action which belongs to Matter, <HI>viz. Motion.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, you are at every Turn relap∣sing into your old exploded Conceit, of a moveable, and, consequently, an extended Substance existing without the Mind. What! Have you already forgot you were convinced, or are you willing I shou'd repeat what has been said on that Head? In truth, this is not fair Dealing in you, still to suppose the Being of that which you have so often acknowleged to have no Being. But, not to insist farther on what has been so largely handled, I ask, whether all your Ideas are not perfectly pas∣sive and inert, including nothing of Action in them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are sensible Qualities any thing else but Ideas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often have I acknowledged that they are not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not Motion a sensible Qua∣lity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, it is no Action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you. And, indeed, it is very plain, that when I stir my Finger, it re∣mains
<PB N="84" REF="97"/>
passive; but my Will, which produ∣ced the Motion, is active.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I desire to know, in the first place, whether Motion being allowed to be no Action, you can conceive any Action be∣side Volition: And in the second place, whe∣ther to say something, and conceive nothing, be not to talk Nonsense: And, lastly, whe∣ther having considered the Premises you do not perceive, that to suppose any efficient or active Cause of our Ideas, other than <HI>Spirit,</HI> is highly absurd and unreasonable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give up the Point intirely. But tho' Matter may not be a Cause, yet what hin∣ders its being an <HI>Instrument</HI> subservient to the Supreme Agent, in the Production of our Ideas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Instrument, say you; pray, what may be the Figure, Springs, Wheels, and Mo∣tions of that Instrument?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those I pretend to determine nothing of, both the Substance and its Qualities be∣ing intirely unknown to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? You are then of Opinion, it is made up of unknown Parts, that it hath unknown Motions and an unknown Shape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not believe it hath any Figure or Motion at all, being already convinced, that no sensible Qualities can exist in an un∣perceiving Substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="98"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Notion is it possible to frame of an Instrument void of all sensible Qualities, even Extension itself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend to have any Notion of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what reason have you to think, this unknown, this inconceivable Somewhat does exist? Is it that you imagine, God cannot act as well without it, or that you find by Experience, the Use of some such thing, when you form Ideas in your own Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are always teizing me for Rea∣sons of my Belief. Pray, what Reasons have you not to believe it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is to me a sufficient Reason not to believe the Existence of any thing, if I see no Reason for believing it. But not to insist on Reasons for believing, you will not so much as let me know what it is you wou'd have me believe; since you say, you have no manner of Notion of it. After all, let me intreat you to consider, whether it be like a Philosopher, or even like a Man of common Sense, to pretend to believe, you know not what, and you know not why.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, <HI>Philonous.</HI> When I tell you Matter is an <HI>Instrument,</HI> I do not mean alto∣gether Nothing. It is true, I know not the particular Kind of Instrument; but, how∣ever,
<PB N="86" REF="99"/>
I have some Notion of <HI>Instrument in ge∣neral,</HI> which I apply to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if it shou'd prove that there is something, even in the most general Notion of <HI>Instrument,</HI> as taken in a distinct Sense from <HI>Cause,</HI> which makes the Use of it incon∣sistent with the Divine Attributes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make that appear, and I shall give up the Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mean you by the general Na∣ture or Notion of <HI>Instrument?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That which is common to all parti∣cular Instruments composeth the general No∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not common to all Instruments, that they are applied to the doing those things only, which cannot be performed by the meer Act of our Wills. Thus, for instance, I ne∣ver use an Instrument to move my Finger, be∣cause it is done by a Volition. But I shou'd use one, if I were to remove part of a Rock, or tear up a Tree by the Roots. Are you of the same Mind? or, can you shew any Ex∣ample where an Instrument is made use of, in producing an Effect immediately depend∣ing on the Will of the Agent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, I cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, therefore, can you suppose, that an All-perfect Spirit, on whose Will all things have an absolute and immediate De∣pendence, shou'd need an Instrument in his
<PB N="87" REF="100"/>
Operations, or not needing it, make use of it? Thus, it seems to me, that you are ob∣liged to own the Use of a lifeless, inactive Instrument, to be incompatible with the In∣finite Perfection of God; that is, by your own Confession, to give up the Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does not readily occur what I can answer you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But methinks you shou'd be ready to own the Truth, when it has been fairly proved to you. We indeed, who are Be∣ings of Finite Powers, are forced to make use of Instruments. And the Use of an In∣strument sheweth, the Agent to be limited by Rules of another's Prescription, and that he cannot obtain his End, but in such a Way, and by such Conditions. Whence it seems a clear Consequence, that the supreme, unli∣mited Agent, useth no Tool or Instrument at all. The Will of an Omnipotent Spirit is no sooner exerted than executed, without the Application of Means, which, if they are imployed by inferior Agents, it is not upon account of any real Efficacy that is in them, or necessary Aptitude to produce any Effect, but meerly in compliance with the Laws of Nature, or those Conditions prescribed to them by the first Cause, who is Himself a∣bove all Limitation or Prescription what∣soever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will no longer maintain, that Mat∣ter is an Instrument. However, I wou'd not be understood to give up its Existence nei∣ther; since, notwithstanding what hath been said, it may still be an <HI>Occasion.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many Shapes is your Matter to take? or, how often must it be proved not to exist, before you are content to part with it? But to say no more of this (tho by all the Laws of Disputation, I may just∣ly blame you, for so frequently changing the Signification of the principal Term) I wou'd fain know what you mean by affirming, that Matter is an Occasion, having already de∣nied it to be a Cause. And when you have shewn in what Sense you understand <HI>Occa∣sion,</HI> pray, in the next place, be pleased to shew me what Reason induceth you to be∣lieve, there is such an Occasion of our Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the first Point: By <HI>Occasion,</HI> I mean an inactive, unthinking Being; at the Presence whereof, God excites Ideas in our Minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what may be the Nature of that inactive, unthinking Being?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of its Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed then to the second Point, and assign some Reason why we should allow an Existence to this inactive, unthinking, un∣known thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we see Ideas produced in our Minds after an orderly and constant Manner, it is natural to think they have some fixed and regular Occasions, at the Presence of which they are excited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You acknowlege then God alone to be the Cause of our Ideas, and that he causes them at the Presence of those Occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those Things which you say are pre∣sent to God, without doubt He perceives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; otherwise they could not be to Him an Occasion of acting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to insist now on your making Sense of this Hypothesis, or answering all the puzzling Questions and Difficulties it is liable to: I only ask whether the Order and Regularity observable in the Series of our Ideas, or the Course of Nature, be not suffi∣ciently accounted for by the Wisdom and Power of God; and whether it does not de∣rogate from those Attributes, to suppose He is influenced, directed, or put in Mind, when and what He is to act, by any unthinking Substance. And, lastly, whether, in case I gran∣ted all you contend for, it wou'd make any thing to your Purpose, it not being easy to con∣ceive, how the external or absolute Existence of an unthinking Substance, distinct from its be∣ing perceived, can be inferred from my al∣lowing that there are certain things perceived
<PB N="90" REF="103"/>
by the Mind of God, which are to Him the Occasion of producing Ideas in us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perfectly at a Loss what to think, this Notion of <HI>Occasion</HI> seeming now altoge∣ther as groundless as the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not at length perceive, that in all these different Acceptations of <HI>Matter,</HI> you have been only supposing you know not what, for no manner of Reason, and to no kind of Use?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I freely own myself less fond of my Notions, since they have been so accurately examined. But still, methinks, I have some confused Perception that there is such a thing as <HI>Matter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either you perceive the Being of Mat∣ter immediately, or mediately. If imme∣diately, pray inform me by which of the Senses you perceive it. If mediately, let me know by what Reasoning it is inferred from those Things which you perceive immediate∣ly. So much for the Perception. Then for the Matter itself, I ask whether it is Object, <HI>Substratum,</HI> Cause, Instrument, or Occasion? You have already pleaded for each of these, shifting your Notions, and making Matter to appear sometime in one Shape, then in ano∣ther. And what you have offered, has been disapproved and rejected by yourself. If you have any thing new to advance, I wou'd glad∣ly hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have already offered all I had to say on those Heads. I am at a Loss what more to urge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you are loath to part with your old Prejudice. But to make you quit it more easily, I desire that, beside what has been hitherto suggested, you will farther consider, whether upon Supposition that Mat∣ter exists, you can possibly conceive how you shou'd be affected by it? Or supposing it did not exist, whether it be not evident, you might for all that be affected with the same Ideas you now are, and consequently have the very same Reasons to believe its Existence that you now can have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it is possible we might perceive all things just as we do now, tho there was no Matter in the World; neither can I conceive, if there be Matter, how it shou'd produce any Idea in our Minds. And I do farther grant, you have intirely satisfied me, that it is impossible there shou'd be such a thing as Matter in any of the foregoing Ac∣ceptations. But still I cannot help supposing that there is <HI>Matter</HI> in some Sense or other. What that is I do not indeed pretend to de∣termine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not expect you shou'd define ex∣actly the Nature of that unknown Being. On∣ly be pleased to tell me, whether it is a Sub∣stance: And if so, whether you can suppose
<PB N="92" REF="105"/>
a Substance without Accidents; or, in case you suppose it to have Accidents or Qualities, I desire you will let me know what those Qualities are, at least, what is meant by Mat∣ter's supporting them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have already argued on those Points. I have no more to say to them. But to prevent any farther Questions, let me tell you, I at present understand by <HI>Matter</HI> nei∣ther Substance nor Accident, thinking nor ex∣tended Being, neither Cause, Instrument, nor Occasion, but something intirely unknown, distinct from all these.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then, you include in your present Notion of Matter, nothing but the ge∣neral Abstract Idea of <HI>Entity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing else, save only that I super∣add to this general Idea, the Negation of all those particular Things, Qualities, or Ideas, that I perceive, imagine, or in any wise ap∣prehend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray where do you suppose this un∣known Matter to exist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh <HI>Philonous!</HI> now you think you have entangled me, for if I say it exists in Place, then you will inferr that it exists in the Mind, since it is agreed, that Place or Ex∣tension exists only in the Mind: But I am not ashamed to own my Ignorance. I know not where it exists; only I am sure it exists not in Place. There is a negative Answer for
<PB N="93" REF="106"/>
you: And you must expect no other to all the Questions you put for the future about Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you will not tell me where it exists, be pleased to inform me after what Manner you suppose it to exist, or what you mean by its <HI>Existence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It neither thinks nor acts, neither per∣ceives, nor is perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what is there positive in your abstracted Notion of its Existence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon a nice Observation, I do not find I have any positive Notion or Meaning at all. I tell you again, I am not ashamed to own my Ignorance. I know not what is meant by its <HI>Existence,</HI> or how it exists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Continue, good <HI>Hylas,</HI> to act the same ingenuous Part, and tell me sincerely, whether you can frame a distinct Idea of En∣tity in general, prescinded from, and exclu∣sive of, all thinking and corporeal Beings, all particular things whatsoever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, let me think a little—I pro∣fess, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I do not find that I can. At first Glance methought I had some dilute and airy Notion of pure Entity in Abstract; but upon closer Attention it has quite vanished out of Sight. The more I think on it, the more am I confirmed in my prudent Resolu∣tion of giving none but negative Answers, and not pretending to the least Degree of any
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
positive Knowlege or Conception of Matter, its <HI>Where,</HI> its <HI>How,</HI> its <HI>Entity,</HI> or any thing belonging to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When, therefore, you speak of the Existence of Matter, you have not any Notion in your Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray tell me if the Case stands not thus: At first, from a Belief of Material Sub∣stance, you would have it that the immediate Objects existed without the Mind; then that their Archetypes; then Causes; next Instru∣ments; then Occasions: Lastly, <HI>something in general,</HI> which being interpreted, proves <HI>no∣thing.</HI> So Matter comes to nothing. What think you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> is not this a fair Summary of your whole Proceeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be that as it will, yet I still insist up∣on it, that our not being able to conceive a Thing, is no Argument against its Ex∣istence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That from a Cause, Effect, Opera∣tion, Sign, or other Circumstance, there may reasonably be inferred the Existence of a Thing not immediately perceived, and that it were absurd for any Man to argue against the Existence of that Thing, from his having no direct and positive Notion of it, I freely own. But where there is nothing of all this; where neither Reason nor Revelation induceth us to believe the Existence of a Thing; where
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
we have not even a relative Notion of it; where an Abstraction is made from perceiving, and being perceived, from Spirit and Idea: In fine, where there is not so much as the most inadequate or faint Idea pretended to. I will not, indeed, thence conclude against the Reality of any Notion, or Existence of any thing: But my Inference shall be, that you mean nothing at all: That you employ Words to no manner of Purpose, without any Design or Signification whatsoever. And I leave it to you to consider how meer Jargon shou'd be treated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal frankly with you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> your Arguments seem in themselves unan∣swerable, but they have not so great an Ef∣fect on me, as to produce that intire Con∣viction, that hearty Acquiescence which at∣tends Demonstration. I find myself still re∣lapsing into an obscure Surmise of, I know not what, <HI>Matter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you not sensible, <HI>Hylas,</HI> that two Things must concur to take away all Scruple, and work a plenary Assent in the Mind? Let a visible Object be set in never so clear a Light, yet if there is any Imper∣fection in the Sight, or if the Eye is not di∣rected towards it, it will not be distinctly seen. And tho a Demonstration be never so well grounded and fairly proposed, yet if there is withal a Stain of Prejudice, or a
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
wrong Biass on the Understanding, can it be expected on a suddain to perceive clearly, and adhere firmly to the Truth? No, there is need of Time and Pains: The Attention must be awakened and detained by a frequent Repeti∣tion of the same Thing placed oft in the same, oft in different Lights. I have said it already, and find I must still repeat and in∣culcate, that it is an unaccountable Licence you take, in pretending to maintain you know not what, for you know not what Rea∣son, to you know not what Purpose? Can this be paralleled in any Art or Science, any Sect or Profession of Men? Or is there any thing so barefacedly groundless and unrea∣sonable to be met with, even in the lowest of common Conversation? But perhaps you will still say Matter may exist, tho' at the same time you neither know what is meant by <HI>Matter,</HI> or by its <HI>Existence.</HI> This indeed is surprizing, and the more so, because it is altogether voluntary and of your own Head, you not being led to it by any one Reason, for I challenge you to shew me that Thing in Nature, which needs Matter to explain or account for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reality of Things cannot be maintained without supposing the Existence of Matter. And is not this, think you, a good Reason why I shou'd be earnest in its Defence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="97" REF="110"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reality of Things! What Things, sensible or intelligible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sensible Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Glove, for Example?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, or any other thing perceived by the Senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to fix on some particular thing; is it not a sufficient Evidence to me of the Existence of this <HI>Glove,</HI> that I see it, and feel it, and wear it? Or, if this will not do, how is it possible I shou'd be assured of the Reali∣ty of this Thing, which I actually see in this Place, by supposing that some unknown Thing, which I never did or can see, exists after an unknown manner, in an unknown place, or in no place at all? How can the supposed Reality of that which is intangible, be a Proof that any thing tangible really exists? or, of that which is invisible, that any visible thing, or, in general, of any thing which is imperceptible, that a Perceptible exists? Do but explain this, and I shall think nothing too hard for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the whole, I am content to own the Existence of Matter is highly improba∣ble; but the direct and absolute Impossibility of it does not appear to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But granting Matter to be possible, yet, upon that account meerly, it can have no more Claim to Existence than a Golden Mountain, or a Centaur.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it; but still you do not deny it is possible; and that which is possible, for ought you know, may actually exist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny it to be possible: And have, if I mistake not, evidently proved, from your own Concessions, that it is not. In the com∣mon Sense of the Word <HI>Matter,</HI> is there any more implied, than an extended, solid, figu∣red, moveable Substance existing without the Mind? And, have not you acknow∣leged over and over, that you have seen evi∣dent Reason for denying the Possibility of such a Substance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but that is only one Sense of the Term <HI>Matter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, is it not the only proper, ge∣nuine, received Sense? And if Matter, in such a Sense, be proved impossible, may it not be thought, with good Grounds, abso∣lutely impossible? Else, how cou'd any thing be proved impossible? Or, indeed, how cou'd there be any Proof at all, one way or other, to a Man who takes the Liberty to unsettle and change the common Signification of Words?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought Philosophers might be al∣lowed to speak more accurately than the Vul∣gar, and were not always confined to the common Acceptation of a Term.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this now mentioned, is the com∣mon received Sense among Philosophers them∣selves. But not to insist on that, have you not been allowed to take Matter in what Sense you pleased? And, have you not used this Privilege in the utmost Extent, sometimes intirely changing, at others leaving out, or putting into the Definition of it whatever, for the present, best served your Design, contra∣ry to all the known Rules of Reason and Logic? And, hath not this shifting, unfair Method of yours, spun out our Dispute to an unnecessary Length; Matter having been par∣ticularly examined, and, by your own Con∣fession, refuted, in each of those Senses? And, can any more be required, to prove the ab∣solute Impossibility of a Thing, than the pro∣ving it impossible in every particular Sense, that either you, or any one else, understands it in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am not so thorowly satisfied that you have proved the Impossibility of Matter, in the last most obscure, abstracted, and indefinite Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When is a thing shewn to be im∣possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>When a Repugnancy is demonstrated between the Ideas comprehended in its Defi∣nition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="100" REF="113"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where there are no Ideas, there no Repugnancy can be demonstrated between Ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Now, in that which you call the ob∣scure, indefinite Sense of the Word <HI>Matter,</HI> it is plain, by your own Confession, there was included no Idea at all, no Sense, ex∣cept an unknown Sense, which is the same thing as none. You are not, therefore, to ex∣pect I shou'd prove a Repugnancy between Ideas, where there are no Ideas; or the Im∣possibility of Matter taken in an <HI>unknown</HI> Sense, <HI>i. e.</HI> no Sense at all. My business was only to shew, you meant <HI>nothing;</HI> and this you were brought to own. So that in all your various Senses, you have been shew'd either to mean nothing at all, or, if any thing, an Absurdity. And if this be not suf∣fient to prove the Impossibility of a Thing, I desire you will let me know what is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge, you have proved that Matter is impossible; nor do I see what more can be said in defence of it. But at the same time that I give up this, I fuspect all my o∣ther Notions. For, surely, none cou'd be more seemingly evident than this once was: And yet it now seems as false and absurd as ever it did true before. But, I think we have discussed the Point sufficiently for the pre∣sent. The remaining Part of the Day I

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O, <HI>Hylas,</HI> What are the Fruits of Yester∣day's Meditation? Has it confirmed you in the same Mind you were in at parting? or have you since seen Cause to change your Opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hylas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly my Opinion is, that all our Opinions are alike vain and uncertain. What we approve to Day, we condemn to Morrow, We keep a Stir about Knowlege, and spend our Lives in the Pursuit of it, when, alas! we know nothing all the while: nor do I think it possible for us ever to know any thing in this Life. Our Faculties are too narrow and too few. Nature certainly never intended us for Speculation.</P>

<P>There is not that single thing in the World whereof we can know the real Na∣ture, or what it is in itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you tell me I do not really know what Fire or Water is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may indeed know that Fire ap∣pears hot, and Water fluid: But this is no more than knowing, what Sensations are produced in your own Mind, upon the Ap∣plication of Fire and Water to your Organs of Sense. Their internal Constitution, their true and real Nature, you are utterly in the dark as to <HI>that.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I not know this to be a real Stone that I stand on, and that which I see before my Eyes to be a real Tree?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Know?</HI> no, it is impossible you or any Man alive shou'd know it. All you know, is, that you have such a certain Idea or Appearance in your own Mind. But what is this to the real Tree or Stone? I tell you, that Colour, Figure, and Hardness, which you perceive, are not at all the real Natures of those Things, or in the least like them. The same may be said of all other real Things or corporeal Substances which com∣pose the World. They have none of them any thing in themselves, like those sensible Qualities by us perceived. We shou'd not therefore pretend to affirm or know any
<PB N="104" REF="117"/>
thing of them, as they are in their own Na∣ture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely, <HI>Hylas,</HI> I can distinguish Gold, for Example, from Iron: And how could this be, if I knew not what either truly was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you can only distinguish between your own Ideas. That Yellowness, that Weight, and other sensible Qualities, think you they are really in the Gold? They are only relative to the Senses, and have no absolute Existence in Nature. And in pretending to distinguish the Species of real Things, by the Appearances in your Mind, you may, perhaps, act as wisely as he that shou'd conclude two Men were of a dif∣ferent Species, because their Cloaths were not of the same Colour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then we are altogether put off with the Appearances of Things, and those false ones too. The very Meat I eat, and the Cloth I wear, have nothing in them like what I see and feel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it not strange the whole World shou'd be thus imposed on, and so foolish as to believe their Senses? And yet I know not how it is, but Men eat, and drink, and sleep, and perform all the Offices of Life, as comfortably and conveniently, as if they
<PB N="105" REF="118"/>
really knew the Things they are conversant about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do so: But, you know, ordinary Practice does not require a Nicety of specu∣lative Knowlege. Hence the Vulgar retain their Mistakes, and for all that, make a Shift to bustle thorow the Affairs of Life. But Phi∣losophers know better things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean, they know that they <HI>know nothing.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the very Top and Perfection of Humane Knowlege.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, are you all this while in earnest, <HI>Hylas;</HI> and are you seriously persuaded that you know nothing real in the World? Sup∣pose you were going to write, wou'd you not call for Pen, Ink, and Paper, like another Man; and do you not know what it is you call for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often must I tell you, that I know not the real Nature of any one thing in the Universe? I may, indeed, upon Occasion, make use of Pen, Ink, and Paper. But what any one of them is in its own true Nature, I declare positively I know not. And the same is true with regard to every other corporeal thing. And, what is more, we are not only ignorant of the true and real Nature of Things, but even of their Existence. It can∣not be denied that we perceive such certain Appearances or Ideas; but it cannot be con∣cluded
<PB N="106" REF="119"/>
from thence that Bodies really exist. Nay, now I think on it, I must, agreeably to my former Concessions, farther declare, that it is impossible any real corporeal Thing shou'd exist in Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You amaze me. Was ever any thing more wild and extravagant than the Notions you now maintain: And is it not evident you are led into all these Extravagan∣cies, by the Belief of <HI>material Substance?</HI> This makes you dream of those unknown Natures in every thing. It is this occasions your distinguishing between the Reality and sensible Appearances of Things. It is to this you are indebted, for being ignorant of what every Body else knows perfectly well. Nor is this all: You are not only ignorant of the true Nature of every Thing, but you know not whether any thing really exists, or whe∣ther there are any true Natures at all; foras∣much as you attribute to your material Be∣ings an absolute or external Existence, where∣in you suppose their Reality consists. And as you are forced in the end to acknowlege, such an Existence means either a direct Re∣pugnancy, or nothing at all, it follows, that you are obliged to pull down your own Hypothesis of material Substance, and posi∣tively to deny the real Existence of any Part of the Universe. And so you are plunged in∣to the deepest and most deplorable <HI>Scepticism</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="120"/>
that ever Man was. Tell me, <HI>Hylas,</HI> is it not as I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you. <HI>Material Substance</HI> was no more than an Hypothesis, and a false and groundless one too. I will no longer spend my Breath in Defence of it. But what∣ever Hypothesis you advance, or whatsoever Scheme of Things you introduce in its stead, I doubt not it will appear every whit as false: Let me but be allowed to question you upon it: That is, suffer me to serve you in your own Kind, and I warrant it shall conduct you thorow as many Perplexities and Contra∣dictions, to the very same State of Scepticism that I myself am in at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> I do not pre∣tend to frame any Hypothesis at all. I am of a vulgar Cast, simple enough to believe my Senses, and leave Things as I find them. To be plain, it is my Opinion, that the real Things are those very Things I see and feel, and perceive by my Senses. These I know, and finding they answer all the Necessities and Purposes of Life, have no reason to be solici∣tous about any other unknown Beings. A Piece of sensible Bread, for Instance, wou'd stay my Stomach better than ten thousand times as much of that insensible, unintelligi∣ble, real Bread you speak of. It is likewise my Opinion, that Colours and other sensible Qualities are on the Objects. I cannot for
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
my Life help thinking that Snow is white, and Fire hot. You, indeed, who by <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> mean certain external, unperceived, unperceiving Substances, are in the right to deny Whiteness or Heat to be Affections in∣herent in them. But I, who understand by those Words the Things I see and feel, am obliged to think like other Folks. And, as I am no Sceptic with regard to the Nature of Things, so neither am I as to their Existence. That a thing shou'd be really perceived by my Senses, and at the same time not really exist, is to me a plain Contradiction; since I cannot prescind or abstract, even in Thought, the Existence of a sensible Thing from its be∣ing perceived. Wood, Stones, Fire, Water, Flesh, Iron, and the like Things, which I name and discourse of, are Things that I know; otherwise I shou'd never have thought of them, or named them. And I shou'd not have known them, but that I perceived them by my Senses; and Things perceived by the Senses are immediately perceived; and Things immmediately perceived are Ideas; and Ideas cannot exist without the Mind; their Existence, therefore, consists in being per∣ceived; when, therefore, they are actually perceived, there can be no Doubt of their Existence. Away then with all that Scepti∣cism, all those ridiculous Philosophical Doubts. What a Jest is it for a Philosopher to question
<PB N="109" REF="122"/>
the Existence of sensible Things, till he has it proved to him from the Veracity of God: Or to pretend our Knowlege in this Point falls short of Intuition or Demonstration? I might as well doubt of my own Being, as of the Being of those Things I actually see and feel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so fast, <HI>Philonous:</HI> you say you cannot conceive how sensible Things shou'd exist without the Mind. Do you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Supposing you were annihilated, can∣not you conceive it possible, that Things per∣ceivable by Sense, may still exist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can; but then it must be in ano∣ther mind. When I deny sensible Things an Existence out of the Mind, I do not mean my Mind in particular, but all Minds. Now it is plain, they have an Existence exterior to my Mind, since I find them, by Expe∣rience, to be independent of it. There is, therefore, some other Mind wherein they exist, during the Intervals between the Times of my perceiving them: As, likewise, they did before my Birth, and wou'd do after my supposed Annihilation. And, as the same is true, with regard to all other finite, created Spirits; it necessarily follows, there is an <HI>Omnipresent, Eternal Mind,</HI> which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits them to our View in such a manner, and according
<PB N="110" REF="123"/>
to such Rules as He Himself has ordained, and are by us termed the <HI>Laws of Nature.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Answer me, <HI>Philonous.</HI> Are all our Ideas perfectly inert Beings? or, have they any Agency included in them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are altogether passive and inert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not God an Agent, a Being purely active?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Idea, therefore, can be like unto, or represent the Nature of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since, therefore, you have no Idea of the Mind of God, how can you conceive it possible, that things shou'd exist in His Mind? Or, if you can conceive the Mind of God with∣out having an Idea of it, why may not I be allowed to conceive the Existence of Matter, notwithstanding that I have no Idea of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to your first Question; I own I have properly no Idea, either of God or any other Spirit; for, these being active, cannot be represented by things perfectly inert, as our Ideas are. I do, nevertheless, know, that I, who am a Spirit or thinking Substance, exist as certainly, as I know my Ideas exist. Farther, I know what I mean by the Terms <HI>I</HI> and <HI>Myself;</HI> and I know this immediately, or intuitively, tho I do not perceive it as I per∣ceive a Triangle, a Colour, or a Sound. The Mind, Spirit, or Soul, is that indivisible un∣extended
<PB N="111" REF="124"/>
Thing, which thinks, acts, and per∣ceives. I say, <HI>indivisible,</HI> because unextend∣ed; and <HI>unextended,</HI> because extended, figu∣red, moveable Things, are Ideas; and that which perceives Ideas, which thinks, and wills, is plainly itself no Idea, nor like an Idea. Ideas are Things inactive, and per∣ceived. And Spirits a sort of Beings, alto∣gether different from them. I do not, there∣fore, say, my Soul is an Idea, or like an Idea. However, taking the Word <HI>Idea</HI> in a large Sense, my Soul may be said to furnish me with an Idea, that is, an Image, or Likeness of God, tho, indeed, extremely inadequate. For all the Notion I have of God, is obtained by reflecting on my own Soul, heightning its Powers, and removing its Imperfections. I have, therefore, tho not an inactive Idea, yet, in myself, some sort of an active, thinking Image of the Deity. And tho I perceive Him not by Sense, yet I have a Notion of Him, or know Him by Reflexion and Rea∣soning. My own Mind, and my own Ideas, I have an immediate Knowlege of; and by the Help of these, do mediately apprehend the Possibility of the Existence of other Spi∣rits and Ideas. Farther, from my own Be∣ing, and from the Dependency I find in my∣self, and my Ideas, I do, by an Act of Rea∣son, necessarily infer the Existence of a God, and of all created Things in the Mind of
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
God. So much for your first Question. For the second: I suppose, by this time you can answer it yourself. For you neither perceive Matter objectively, as you do an inactive Be∣ing, or Idea, nor know it, as you do your∣self, by a reflex Act: Neither do you me∣diately apprehend it by Similitude of the one or the other: Nor yet collect it by Reasoning, from that which you know imme∣diately. All which makes the Case of <HI>Mat∣ter</HI> widely different from that of the <HI>Deity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own myself satisfied in this Point. But do you in earnest think, the real Exi∣stence of sensible Things consists in their be∣ing actually perceived? If so; How comes it that all Mankind distinguish between them? Ask the first Man you meet, and he shall tell you, <HI>to be perceived</HI> is one thing, and <HI>to exist</HI> is another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am content, <HI>Hylas,</HI> to appeal to the common Sense of the World for the Truth of my Notion. Ask the Gardiner, why he thinks yonder Cherry-Tree exists in the Gar∣den, and he shall tell you, because he sees and feels it; in a word, because he perceives it by his Senses. Ask him, why he thinks an Orange-Tree not to be there, and he shall tell you, because he does not perceive it. What he perceives by Sense, that he terms a real Being, and saith it <HI>is,</HI> or <HI>exists;</HI> but that
<PB N="113" REF="126"/>
which is not perceivable, the same, he saith, has no Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I grant the Existence of a sensible Thing consists in being perceiva∣ble, but not in being actually perceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is perceivable but an Idea? And can an Idea exist without being actually perceived? These are Points long since agreed between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, be your Opinion never so true: Yet, surely, you will not deny it is shocking, and contrary to the common Sense of Men. Ask the Fellow, whether yonder Tree has an Existence out of his Mind: What An∣swer think you he wou'd make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same that I shou'd myself, <HI>viz.</HI> That it does exist out of his Mind. But then to a Christian, it cannot surely be shock∣ing to say, The real Tree existing without his Mind is truly known and comprehended by (that is, <HI>exists in)</HI> the infinite Mind of God. Probably he may not at first Glance be aware of the direct and immediate Proof there is of this, inasmuch as the very Being of a Tree, or any other sensible Thing, implies a Mind wherein it is. But the Point itself he cannot deny. The Question between the Materia∣lists and me is, not whether Things have a real Existence out of the Mind of this or that Person, but whether they have an abso∣lute Existence, distinct from being perceived
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
by God, and exterior to all Minds. This, indeed, some Heathens and Philosophers have affirmed, but whoever entertains Notions of the Deity suitable to the Holy Scriptures, will be of another Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, according to your Notions, what Difference is there between real Things, and Chimeras formed by the Imagination, or the Visions of a Dream, since they are all equally in the Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ideas formed by the Imagina∣tion, are faint and indistinct; they have, be∣sides, an intire Dependence on the Will. But the Ideas perceived by Sense, <HI>i. e.</HI> real Things, are more vivid and clear, and being imprint∣ed on the Mind by a Spirit distinct from us, have not a like Dependence on our Will. There is, therefore, no Danger of confound∣ing these with the foregoing: And there is as little of confounding them with the Visions of a Dream, which are dim, irregular, and confused. And tho they shou'd happen to be never so lively and natural, yet by their not being connected, and of a Piece, with the pre∣ceding and subsequent Transactions of our Lives, they might easily be distinguished from Realities. In short, by whatever Me∣thod you distinguish <HI>Things</HI> from <HI>Chimeras</HI> on your own Scheme, the same, it is evident, will hold also upon mine. For it must be, I presume, by some perceived Difference, and
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
I am not for depriving you of any one thing that you perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you hold, there is nothing in the World but Spirits and Ideas. And this, you must needs acknowlege, sounds very odly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own the Word <HI>Idea,</HI> not being com∣monly used for <HI>Thing,</HI> sounds something out of the way. My Reason for using it was, because a necessary Relation to the Mind is understood to be implied by that Term; and it is now commonly used by Philosophers, to denote the immediate Objects of the Under∣standing. But however odly the Proposition may sound in Words, yet it includes nothing so very strange or shocking in its Sense, which in effect amounts to no more than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are only Things perceiving, and Things perceived; or that every un∣thinking Being is necessarily, and from the very Nature of its Existence, perceived by some Mind; if not by any finite, created Mind, yet certainly by the infinite Mind of God, in whom <HI>we live, and move, and have our Being.</HI> Is this as strange as to say, The sensible Qualities are not on the Objects: Or, That we cannot be sure of the Existence of Things, or know any thing of their real Natures, tho we both see and feel them, and perceive them by all our Senses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="116" REF="129"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in Consequence of this, must we not think there are no such Things as Physi∣cal or Corporeal Causes: But that a Spirit is the immediate Cause of all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in Nature? Can there be any thing more extra∣vagant than this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is infinitely more extravagant to say, A thing which is inert, operates on the Mind, and which is unperceiving, is the Cause of our Perceptions, without any regard ei∣ther to Consistency, or the old known Axiom: <HI>Nothing can give to another that which it hath not itself.</HI> Besides, that which to you, I know not for what Reason, seems so extra∣vagant, is no more than the Holy Scriptures assert in a hundred Places. In them God is represented as the sole and immediate Author of all those Effects, which some Heathens and Philosophers are wont to ascribe to Nature, Matter, Fate, or the like unthinking Princi∣ple. This is so much the constant Language of Scripture, that it were needless to confirm it by Citations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not aware, <HI>Philonous,</HI> that in making God the immediate Author of all the Motions in Nature, you make him the Au∣thor of Murder, Sacrilege, Adultery, and the like heinous Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Answer to that, I observe first, that the Imputation of Guilt is the same, whether a Person commits an Action with or without
<PB N="117" REF="130"/>
an Instrument. In case, therefore, you sup∣pose God to act by the Mediation of an Instru∣ment, or Occasion, called <HI>Matter,</HI> you as truly make Him the Author of Sin as I, who think Him the immediate Agent in all those Operations vulgarly ascribed to Nature. I farther observe, that Sin or moral Turpitude does not consist in the outward Physical Action or Motion, but in the internal Devia∣tion of the Will from the Laws of Reason and Religion. This is plain, in that the kil∣ling an Enemy in a Battel, or putting a Cri∣minal legally to Death, is not thought sinful, tho the outward Act be the very same with that in the Case of Murder. Since, therefore, Sin does not consist in the Physical Action, the making God an immediate Cause of all such Actions, is not making Him the Author of Sin. Lastly, I have no where said, that God is the only Agent who produces all the Mo∣tions in Bodies. It is true, I have denied there are any other Agents beside Spirits: But this is very consistent with allowing to Thinking, Rational Beings, in the Production of Motions, the Use of limited Powers, ulti∣mately, indeed, derived from God, but im∣mediately under the Direction of their own Wills, which is sufficient to intitle them to all the Guilt of their Actions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the denying Matter, <HI>Philonous,</HI> or corporeal Substance; there is the Point.
<PB N="118" REF="131"/>
You can never persuade me that this is not repugnant to the universal Sense of Man∣kind. Were our Dispute to be determined by most Voices, I am confident you wou'd give up the Point, without gathering the Votes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish both our Opinions were fairly stated, and submitted to the Judgment of Men, who had plain common Sense, without the Prejudices of a learned Education. Let me be represented as one who trusts his Senses, who thinks he knows the Things he sees and feels, and entertains no Doubts of their Existence; and you fairly set forth with all your Doubts, your Paradoxes, and your Scepticism about you, and I shall willingly acquiesce in the Determination of any indiffe∣rent Person. That there is no Substance wherein Ideas can exist beside Spirit, is to me evident. And that the Objects immediately perceived, are Ideas, is on all Hands agreed. And that sensible Qualities are Objects imme∣diately perceived, no one can deny. It is therefore evident, there can be no <HI>Substratum</HI> of those Qualities, but Spirit, in which they exist, not by way of Mode or Property, but as a thing perceived in that which perceives it. I deny therefore that there is any un∣thinking <HI>Substratum</HI> of the Objects of Sense, and, in that Acceptation, that there is any material Substance. But, if by <HI>material Sub∣stance</HI> is meant only sensible Body, that which
<PB N="119" REF="132"/>
is seen and felt, (and the unphilosophical Part of the World I dare say mean no more) then I am more certain of Matter's Existence than you, or any other Philosopher, pretend to be. If there be any thing which makes the Generality of Mankind averse from the Notions I espouse: It is a Misapprehension that I deny the Reality of sensible Things: But, as it is you who are guilty of that, and not I, it follows, that in truth their Aversion is against your Notions, and not mine. I do therefore assert, that I am as certain as of my own Being, that there are Bodies or corpo∣real Substances, (meaning the Things I per∣ceive by my Senses) and that, granting this, the Bulk of Mankind will take no Thought about, nor think themselves at all concerned in the Fate of, those unknown Natures, and Philosophical Quiddities, which some Men are so fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you to this: Since, accor∣ding to you, Men must judge of the Reality of Things by their Senses, how can a Man be mistaken, in thinking the Moon a plain lucid Surface, about a Foot in Diameter; or a square Tower, seen at a distance, round; or an Oar, with one End in the Water, crooked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is not mistaken, with regard to the Ideas he actually perceives; but in the Infe∣rences he makes from his present Percep∣tions.
<PB N="120" REF="133"/>
Thus, in the Case of the Oar, what he immediately perceives by Sight, is cer∣tainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence conclude, that upon taking the Oar out of the Water, he shall perceive the same Crookedness; or, that it wou'd af∣fect his Touch, as crooked things are wont to do: In that he is mistaken. In like man∣ner, if he shall conclude from what he per∣ceives in one Station, that, in case he advan∣ced toward the Moon, or Tower, he shou'd still be affected with the like Ideas, he is mi∣staken. But his Mistake lies not in what he perceives immediately, and at present, (it be∣ing a manifest Contradiction to suppose, he shou'd err in respect of that) but, in the wrong Judgment he makes, concerning the Ideas he apprehends to be connected with those im∣mediately perceived: Or, concerning the Ideas that, from what he perceives at present, he imagines wou'd be perceived in other Cir∣cumstances. The Case is the same, with re∣gard to the <HI>Copernican</HI> System. We do not here perceive any Motion of the Earth: But it were erroneous thence to conclude, that, in case we were placed at as great a Distance from that, as we are now from the other Planets, we shou'd not then perceive its Mo∣tion.</P>

<P>I was. But here lies the Difference. Before, my Positiveness was founded without Examination upon Prejudice; but now, af∣ter Inquiry, upon Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all, it seems our Dispute is ra∣ther about Words than Things. We agree in the Thing, but differ in the Name. That we are affected with Ideas from without, is evident; and it is no less evident, that there must be (I will not say Archetypes, but) Powers without the Mind, corresponding to those Ideas. And, as these Powers cannot subsist by themselves, there is some Subject of them necessarily to be admitted, which I call <HI>Matter,</HI> and you call <HI>Spirit.</HI> There is all the Difference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>Hylas,</HI> is that powerful Being, or Subject of Powers, extended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It hath not Extension; but it has the Power to raise in you the Idea of Exten∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, therefore, itself unextended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not also active?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt: Otherwise, how cou'd we attribute Powers to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="122" REF="135"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, let me ask you Two Que∣stions: <HI>First,</HI> Whether it be agreeable to the Usage either of Philosophers or others, to give the Name <HI>Matter</HI> to an unextended, active Being? And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether it be not ridiculously absurd, to misapply Names contrary to the common Use of Language?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let it not be called Matter, since you will have it so, but some <HI>Third Nature</HI> distinct from Matter and Spirit. For, what reason is there, why you shou'd call it Spirit; does not the Notion of Spirit imply, that it is thinking, as well as active and un∣extended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Reason is this: Because I have a mind to have some Notion or Meaning in what I say, but I have no Notion of any Action distinct from Volition, neither can I conceive Volition to be any where but in a Spirit: therefore, when I speak of an active Being, I am obliged to mean a Spirit. Beside, what can be plainer, than that a thing which hath no Ideas in itself, cannot impart them to me; and if it hath Ideas, surely it must be a Spirit. To make you comprehend the Point still more clearly, if it be possible: I assert as well as you, that, since we are affected from without, we must allow Powers to be with∣out, in a Being distinct from ourselves. So far we are agreed. But then, we differ as to the Kind of this powerful Being. I will have
<PB N="123" REF="136"/>
it to be Spirit, you Matter, or I know not what (I may add too, you know not what) Third Nature. Thus, I prove it to be Spi∣rit. From the Effects I see produced, I con∣clude, there are Actions; and because Acti∣ons, Volitions; and because there are Voli∣tions, there must be a Will. Again, the Things I perceive, must have an Existence, they or their Archetypes, out of my Mind: But be∣ing Ideas, neither they, nor their Archetypes, can exist, otherwise than in an Understand∣ing: There is, therefore, an Understanding. But Will and Understanding constitute, in the strictest Sense, a Mind or Spirit. The power∣ful Cause, therefore, of my Ideas, is in strict Propriety of Speech a <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, I warrant, you think you have made the Point very clear, little su∣specting, that what you advance leads direct∣ly to a Contradiction. Is it not an Absurdi∣ty, to imagine any Imperfection in God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To suffer Pain, is an Imperfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are we not sometimes affected with Pain, and Uneasiness, by some other Be∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you not said, that Being is a Spirit, and is not that Spirit God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="124" REF="137"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have asserted, that whatever Ideas we perceive from without, are in the Mind which affects us. The Ideas, there∣fore, of Pain and Uneasiness are in God; or, in other Words, God suffers Pain: That is to say, there is an Imperfection in the Di∣vine Nature, which, you acknowleged, was absurd. So you are caught in a plain Con∣tradiction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That God knows or understands all things, and that He knows, among other things, what Pain is, even every sort of painful Sensation, and what it is for His Creatures to suffer Pain, I make no que∣stion. But that God, tho' He knows, and sometimes causes painful Sensations in us, can Himself suffer Pain, I positively deny. We, who are limited and dependent Spirits, are liable to Impressions of Sense, the Effects of an external Agent, which, being produced against our Wills, are sometimes painful and uneasy. But God, whom no external Being can affect, who perceives nothing by Sense as we do, whose Will is absolute, and inde∣pendent, causing all things, and liable to be thwarted, or resisted by nothing; it is evi∣dent, such a Being as this, can suffer nothing, nor be affected with any painful Sensation, or, indeed, any Sensation at all. We are chained to a Body, that is to say, our Per∣ceptions are connected with corporeal Mo∣tions.
<PB N="125" REF="138"/>
By the Law of our Nature, we are affected upon every Alteration in the nervous Parts of our sensible Body: Which sensible Body, rightly considered, is nothing but a Complexion of such Qualities, or Ideas, as have no Existence distinct from being percei∣ved by a Mind: So that this Connexion of Sensations with corporeal Motions, means no more, than a Correspondence in the Or∣der of Nature, between two Setts of Ideas, or Things immediately perceivable. But God is a pure Spirit, disengaged from all such Sympathy, or natural Ties. No corpo∣real Motions are attended with the Sensati∣ons of Pain, or Pleasure, in his Mind. To know every thing knowable, is certainly a Perfection; but to endure, or suffer, or feel any thing by Sense, is an Imperfection. The former, I say, agrees to God, but not the lat∣ter. God knows, or hath Ideas; but His Ideas are not convey'd to Him by Sense, as ours are. Your not Distinguishing, where there is so manifest a Difference, makes you fancy, you see an Absurdity where there is none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, all this while, you have not con∣sidered, that the Quantity of Matter has been demonstrated to be proportional to the Gra∣vity of Bodies. And, what can withstand Demonstration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see how you demonstrate that Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I lay it down for a Principle, that the Moments, or Quantities of Motion in Bo∣dies, are in a direct, compounded Reason, of the Velocities and Quantities of Matter con∣tained in them. Hence, where the Velocities are equal, it follows, the Moments are di∣rectly, as the Quantity of Matter in each. But it is found by Experience, that all Bo∣dies (bating the small Inequalities, arising from the Resistance of the Air) descend with an equal Velocity; the Motion, therefore, of descending Bodies, and, consequently, their Gravity, which is the Cause or Principle of that Motion, is proportional to the Quan∣tity of Matter, which was to be demonstra∣ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay it down as a self-evident Principle, that the Quantity of Motion in any Body, is proportional to the Velocity and <HI>Matter,</HI> taken together: And this is made use of to prove a Proposition, from whence the Existence of <HI>Matter</HI> is inferred. Pray, is not this arguing in a Circle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the Premise, I only mean, that the Motion is proportional to the Velocity, joint∣ly with the Extension and Solidity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But allowing this to be true, yet it will not thence follow, that Gravity is pro∣portional to <HI>Matter,</HI> in your Philosophic Sense
<PB N="127" REF="140"/>
of the Word; except you take it for granted, that unknown <HI>Substratum,</HI> or whatever else you call it, is proportional to those sensible Quali∣ties; which to suppose, is plainly begging the Question. That there is Magnitude and Soli∣dity, or Resistance, perceived by Sense, I readi∣ly grant; as likewise that Gravity may be pro∣portional to those Qualities, I will not dispute. But that either these Qualities, as perceived by us, or the Powers producing them, do exist in a <HI>material Substratum;</HI> this is what I deny, and you, indeed, affirm, but, not∣withstanding your Demonstration, have not yet proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall insist no longer on that Point. Do you think, however, you shall persuade me the natural Philosophers have been dream∣ing all this while; pray, what becomes of all their Hypotheses and Explications of the <HI>Phae∣nomena,</HI> which suppose the Existence of Mat∣ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mean you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> by the <HI>Phae∣nomena?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean the Appearances which I per∣ceive by my Senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Appearances perceived by Sense, are they not Ideas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you so a hundred times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, to explain the <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> is to shew how we come to be affected with Ideas, in that Manner and Series, wherein
<PB N="128" REF="141"/>
they are imprinted on our Senses. Is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now if you can prove, that any Phi∣losopher has explained the Production of any one Idea in our Minds, by the Help of <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI> I shall for ever acquiesce and look on all that has been said against it as nothing: But if you cannot, it is in vain to urge the Expli∣cation of <HI>Phaenomena.</HI> That a Being endow∣ed with Knowlege and Will, shou'd produce or exhibit Ideas, is easily understood. But that a Being which is utterly destitute of these Faculties shou'd be able to produce Ideas, or in any Sort to affect an Intelligence, this I can never understand. This, I say, tho we had some positive Conception of Matter, tho we knew its Qualities, and cou'd compre∣hend its Existence, wou'd yet be so far from explaining Things, that it is itself the most inexplicable thing in the World. And, for all this, it will not follow, that Philosophers have been doing nothing neither; for, by observing and reasoning upon the Connexion of Ideas, they discover the Laws and Methods of Na∣ture, which is a part of Knowlege both useful and entertaining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all, can it be supposed God wou'd deceive all Mankind; do you ima∣gine, He wou'd have induced the whole World to believe the Being of Matter, if there was no such thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That every epidemical Opinion arising from Prejudice, or Passion, or Thoughtlesness, may be imputed to God, as the Author of it, I believe, you will not affirm. Whatsoever Opi∣nion we father on Him, it must be, either be∣cause He has discovered it to us by superna∣tural Revelation, or, because it is so evident to our natural Faculties, which were framed and given us by God, that it is impossible we shou'd with-hold our Assent from it. But, where is the Revelation? or, where is the Evidence that extorts the Belief of Matter? Nay, How does it appear, that Matter, taken for something distinct from what we perceive by our Senses, is thought to exist by all Man∣kind, or, indeed, by any, except a few Phi∣losophers, who do not know what they wou'd be at? Your Question supposes, these Points are clear; and when you have cleared them, I shall think myself obliged to give you ano∣ther Answer. In the mean time, let it suf∣fice that I tell you, I do not suppose God has deceived Mankind at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Novelty, <HI>Philonous,</HI> the No∣velty! There lies the Danger. New No∣tions shou'd always be discountenanced; they unsettle Mens Minds, and no body knows where they will end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the Rejecting a Notion that has no Foundation, either in Sense, in Reason, or in Divine Authority, shou'd be thought to unsettle
<PB N="130" REF="143"/>
the Belief of such Opinions as are grounded on all or any of these, I cannot imagine. That Innovations in Government and Religion, are dangerous, and ought to be discountenanced, I freely own. But, is there the like Reason why they shou'd be discouraged in Philoso∣phy? The making any thing known which was unknown before, is an Innovation in Knowledge: And, if all such Innovations had been forbidden, Men wou'd have made a no∣table Progress in the Arts and Sciences. But, it is none of my business to plead for Novel∣ties and Paradoxes. That the Qualities we perceive, are not on the Objects: That we must not believe our Senses: That we know nothing of the real Nature of Things, and can never be assured even of their Existence: That real Colours and Sounds, are nothing but certain unknown Figures and Motions: That Motions are, in themselves, neither swift nor slow: That there are in Bodies, absolute Extensions, without any particular Magnitude or Figure: That a Thing stupid, thoughtless, and inactive, operates on a Spi∣rit: That the least Particle of a Body, con∣tains innumerable extended Parts. These are the Novelties, these are the strange Notions which shock the genuine, uncorrupted Judg∣ment of all Mankind; and, being once ad∣mitted, embarrass the Mind with endless Doubts and Difficulties. And, it is against
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
these, and the like Innovations, I endeavor to vindicate common Sense. It is true, in doing this, I may, perhaps, be obliged to use some <HI>Ambages,</HI> and Ways of Speech not com∣mon. But, if my Notions are once thorow∣ly understood, that which is most singular in them, will, in effect, be found to amount to no more than this: That it is absolutely im∣possible, and a plain Contradiction to suppose, any unthinking Being shou'd exist, without being perceived by a Mind. And if this No∣tion be singular, it is a shame it shou'd be so at this time of day, and in a Christian Coun∣try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for the Difficulties other Opinions may be liable to, those are out of the Que∣stion. It is your Business to defend your own Opinion. Can any thing be plainer, than that you are for changing all things into Ideas? You, I say, who are not ashamed to charge me with <HI>Scepticism.</HI> This is so plain, there is no denying it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me. I am not for chan∣ging Things into Ideas, but rather Ideas into Things; since those immediate Objects of Perception, which, according to you, are only Appearances of Things, I take to be the real Things themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things! you may pretend what you please; but it is certain, you leave us nothing
<PB N="132" REF="145"/>
but the empty Forms of Things, the Outside only, which strikes the Senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you call the empty Forms and Outside of Things, seem to me, the very Things themselves. Nor are they empty or incomplete otherwise, than upon your Sup∣position, that Matter is an essential Part of all corporeal Things. We both, therefore, a∣gree in this, that we perceive only sensible Forms: But herein we differ, you will have them to be empty Appearances, I real Be∣ings. In short, you do not trust your Sen∣ses, I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say, you believe your Senses; and seem to applaud youself, that in this you agree with the Vulgar. According to you, therefore, the true Nature of a Thing is discovered by the Senses. If so, whence comes that Disagreement? Why is not the same Figure, and other sensible Qualities, percei∣ved all manner of Ways? and, why shou'd we use a Microscope, the better to discover the true Nature of a Body, if it were disco∣verable to the naked Eye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strictly speaking, <HI>Hylas,</HI> we do not see the same Object that we feel; neither is the same Object perceived by the Micro∣scope, which was by the naked Eye. But, in case every Variation was thought sufficient to constitute a new Kind or Individual, the endless Number or Confusion of Names wou'd render Language impracticable. Therefore,
<PB N="133" REF="146"/>
to avoid this, as well as other Inconvenien∣cies, which are obvious upon a little Thought, Men combine together several Ideas, appre∣hended by divers Senses, or by the same Sense at different Times, or in different Cir∣cumstances, but observed, however, to have some Connexion in Nature, either with re∣spect to Coexistence or Succession; all which they refer to one Name, and consider as one Thing. Hence it follows, that when I exa∣mine by my other Senses a Thing I have seen, it is not, in order to understand better the same Object which I had perceived by Sight, the Object of one Sense not being per∣ceived by the other Senses. And, when I look thro a Microscope, it is not that I may per∣ceive more clearly, what I perceived already with my bare Eyes, the Object perceived by the Glass being quite different from the for∣mer. But in both cases, my Aim is only to know, what Ideas are connected together; and the more a Man knows of the Connexion of Ideas, the more he is said to know of the Nature of Things. What, therefore, if our Ideas are variable; what if our Senses are not in all Circumstances affected with the same Appearances? It will not thence fol∣low, they are not to be trusted, or, that they are inconsistent either with themselves, or any thing else, except it be with your preconceived Notion of (I know not what) one single, un∣changed, unperceivable, real Nature, marked
<PB N="134" REF="147"/>
by each Name: Which Prejudice seems to have taken its Rise, from not rightly under∣standing the common Language of Men, speak∣ing of several distinct Ideas, as united in∣to one thing by the Mind. And, indeed, there is Cause to suspect, several erroneous Conceits of the Philosophers are owing to the same Original: While they began to build their Schemes, not so much on Notions as Words, which were framed by the Vulgar, meerly for Conveniency and Dispatch in the common Actions of Life, without any regard to Speculation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks, I apprehend your Mean∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your Opinion, the Ideas we per∣ceive by our Senses, are not real Things, but Images, or Copies of them. Our Knowlege, therefore, is no farther real, than as our Ideas are the true Representations of those Origi∣nals. But, as these supposed Originals are in themselves unknown, it is impossible to know how far our Ideas resemble them; or, whether they resemble them at all. We can∣not, therefore, be sure we have any real Knowlege. Farther, as our Ideas are perpe∣tually varied, without any Change in the sup∣posed real Things, it necessarily follows, they cannot all be true Copies of them: Or, if some are, and others are not, it is impossible to distinguish the former from the latter.
<PB N="135" REF="148"/>
And, this plunges us yet deeper in Uncer∣tainty. Again, when we consider the Point, we cannot conceive how any Idea, or any thing like an Idea, shou'd have an absolute Existence out of a Mind: Nor, consequent∣ly, according to you, how there shou'd be any real Thing in Nature. The Result of all which is, that we are thrown into the most hopeless and abandoned <HI>Scepticism.</HI> Now give me leave to ask you, <HI>First,</HI> Whether your referring Ideas to certain absolutely existing, unperceived Substances, as their Originals, be not the Source of all this <HI>Scepticism? Se∣condly,</HI> Whether you are informed, either by Sense or Reason, of the Existence of those un∣known Originals? And in case you are not, Whether it be not absurd to suppose them? <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whether, upon Inquiry, you find there is any thing distinctly conceived or meant by the <HI>absolute or external Existence of unperceiving Substances? Lastly,</HI> Whether the Premises considered, it be not the wisest way to follow Nature, trust your Senses, and, laying aside all anxious Thought about unknown Natures or Substances, admit, with the Vulgar, those for real Things which are perceived by the Senses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the present, I have no Inclination to the Answering Part. I wou'd much ra∣ther see how you can get over what follows. Pray, are not the Objects perceived by the
<PB N="136" REF="149"/>
Senses of one, likewise perceivable to all o∣thers present? If there were an hundred more here, they wou'd all see the Garden, the Trees, and Flowers, as I see them. But they are not in the same manner affected with the Ideas I frame in my Imagination. Does not this make a Difference, between the for∣mer sort of Objects and the latter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant, it does. Nor have I ever denied a Difference between the Objects of Sense and those of Imagination. But, what wou'd you infer from thence? You cannot say, that sensible Objects exist unperceived, because they are perceived by many.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, I can make nothing of that Objection: But, it has led me into another. Is it not your Opinion, that by our Senses we perceive only the Ideas existing in our Minds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the same Idea which is in my Mind, cannot be in yours, or in any other Mind. Doth it not, therefore, follow from your Principles, that no Two can see the same thing? And, is not this highly ab∣surd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Term <HI>same</HI> be taken in the vulgar Acceptation, it is certain, (and not at all repugnant to the Principles I maintain) that different Persons may perceive the same Thing; or, the same Thing or Idea exist in
<PB N="137" REF="150"/>
different Minds. Words are of arbitrary Im∣position; and since Men are used to apply the Word <HI>same</HI> where no Distinct on or Va∣riety is perceived, and I do not pretend to alter their Perceptions; it follows, that as Men have said before, <HI>several saw the same thing,</HI> so they may, upon like Occasions, still continue to use the same Phrase, without any Deviation either from Propriety of Language, or the Truth of Things. But, if the Term <HI>same</HI> be used in the Acceptation of Philoso∣phers, who pretend to an abstracted Notion of Identity, then, according to their sundry Definitions of this Notion, (for it is not yet agreed, wherein that Philosophic Identity consists) it may, or may not, be possible for divers Persons to perceive the same thing. But, whether Philosophers shall think fit to call a thing the <HI>same,</HI> or no, is, I conceive, of small Importance. Let us suppose several Men together, all endued with the same Fa∣culties, and, consequently, affected, in like sort, by their Senses, and who had yet ne∣ver known the Use of Language; they wou'd, without question, agree in their Perceptions. Tho, perhaps, when they came to the Use of Speech, some, regarding the Uniformness of what was perceived, might call it the <HI>same</HI> thing: Others, especially, regarding the Di∣versity of Persons, who perceived, might choose the Denomination of <HI>different</HI> things.
<PB N="138" REF="151"/>
But, who sees not that all the Dispute is about a Word? <HI>Viz.</HI> Whether what is per∣ceived by different Persons, may, yet, have the Term <HI>same</HI> applied to it: Or, suppose a House, whose Walls or outward Shell remain∣ing unaltered, the Chambers are all pulled down, and new ones built in their place; and that you shou'd call this the <HI>same,</HI> and I shou'd say it was not the <HI>same</HI> House, Wou'd we not, for all this, perfectly agree in our Thoughts of the House, considered in itself? and, wou'd not all the Difference consist in a Sound? If you shou'd say, We differed in our Notions; for that you superadded to your Idea of the House, the simple abstracted Idea of Identity, whereas I did not; I wou'd tell you, I know not what you mean by that <HI>abstracted Idea of Identity;</HI> and shou'd desire you to look into your own Thoughts, and be sure you understood yourself.—Why so silent, <HI>Hylas?</HI> Are you not yet satisfied, Men may dispute about Identity and Diver∣sity, without any real Difference in their Thoughts and Opinions, abstracted from Names? Take this farther Reflexion with you: That, whether Matter be allowed to exist, or no, the Case is exactly the same as to the Point in hand. For the Materialists themselves acknowlege, what we immediate∣ly perceive by our Senses, to be our own Ideas. Your Difficulty, therefore, that no
<PB N="139" REF="152"/>
two see the same thing, makes equally a∣gainst the Materialists and me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>Philonous,</HI> but they suppose an external Archetype, to which, referring their several Ideas, they may truly be said to per∣ceive the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And (not to mention your having discarded those Archetypes) so may you sup∣pose, an external Archetype on my Principles, <HI>external,</HI> I mean, to your own Mind; tho, indeed, it must be supposed to exist in that Mind which comprehends all things; but then, this serves all the Ends of Identity, as well as if it existed out of a Mind. And, I am sure, you yourself will not say, It is less intelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, indeed, clearly satisfied me, either, that there is no Difficulty at Bottom in this Point; or, if there be, that it makes equally against both Opinions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that which makes equally against two contradictory Opinions, can be a Proof against neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowlege it. But after all, <HI>Phi∣lonous,</HI> when I consider the Substance of what you advance against <HI>Scepticism,</HI> it amounts to no more than this. We are sure, that we really see, hear, feel; in a Word, that we are affected with sensible Impressions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, how are we concerned any far∣ther? I see this <HI>Cherry,</HI> I feel it, I taste it:
<PB N="140" REF="153"/>
And, I am sure, <HI>nothing</HI> cannot be seen, or felt, or tasted: It is therefore <HI>real.</HI> Take away the Sensations of Softness, Moisture, Redness, Tartness, and you take away the <HI>Cherry.</HI> Since it is not a Being distinct from those Sensations; a <HI>Cherry,</HI> I say, is nothing but a Congeries of sensible Impressions, or Ideas perceived by various Senses: Which Ideas are united into one thing (or have one Name given them) by the Mind; because they are observed to attend each other. Thus, when the Palate is affected with such a parti∣cular Taste, the Sight is affected with a red Colour, the Touch with Roundness, Soft∣ness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence, when I see, and feel, and taste, in such sundry, certain Manners, I am sure, the <HI>Cherry</HI> exists, or is real; its Reality being, in my Opinion, nothing abstracted from those Sensations. But if by the Word <HI>Cherry,</HI> you mean an unknown Nature, di∣stinct from all those sensible Qualities; and, by its Existence, something distinct from its being perceived: Then, indeed, I own, nei∣ther you, nor I, nor any one else, can be sure it exists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what wou'd you say, <HI>Philo∣nous,</HI> if I shou'd bring the very same Rea∣sons against the Existence of sensible Things in a Mind, which you have offered against their Existing in a material <HI>Substratum?</HI></P>

<P>When I see your Reasons, you shall hear what I have to say to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the Mind extended, or unexten∣ded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unextended, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not say, the Things you per∣ceive are in your Mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, have I not heard you speak of sensible Impressions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain to me now, O <HI>Philonous!</HI> how it is possible, there shou'd be room for all those Trees and Houses to exist in your Mind. Can extended Things be contained in that which is unextended? Or, are we to imagine Impressions made on a Thing void of all Solidity? You cannot say, Objects are in your Mind, as Books in your Study: Or, that Things are imprinted on it, as the Figure of a Seal upon Wax. In what Sense, therefore, are we to understand those Expressions? Ex∣plain me this if you can: And I shall then be able to answer all those Queries you for∣merly put to me, about my <HI>Substratum.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, <HI>Hylas,</HI> when I speak of Objects, as existing in the Mind, or imprint∣ed on the Senses; I wou'd not be understood in the gross, literal Sense, as when Bodies are said to exist in a place, or a Seal to make an Impression upon Wax. My Meaning is
<PB N="142" REF="155"/>
only, that the Mind comprehends, or per∣ceives them; and that it is affected from without, or by some Being distinct from it∣self. This is my Explication of your Diffi∣culty; and, how it can serve to make your Tenent of an unperceiving, material <HI>Substra∣tum</HI> intelligible, I wou'd fain know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if that be all, I confess, I do not see what Use can be made of it. But, are you not guilty of some Abuse of Language in this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all: It is no more than common Custom, which, you know, is the Rule of Language, has authorized: Nothing being more usual, than for Philosophers to speak of the immediate Objects of the Un∣derstanding, as Things existing in the Mind. Nor is there any thing in this, but what is conformable to the general Analogy of Lan∣guage; most part of the mental Operations being signified by Words borrowed from sen∣sible Things; as is plain, in the Terms <HI>Com∣prehend, Reflect, Discourse, &amp;c.</HI> which, being applied to the Mind, must not be taken in their gross, original Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, I own, satisfied me in this Point: But there still remains one great Dif∣ficulty, which I know not how you will get over. And, indeed, it is of such Importance, that if you cou'd solve all others, without be∣ing able to find a Solution for this, you must
<PB N="143" REF="156"/>
never expect to make me a Proselyte to your Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me know this mighty Diffi∣culty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Scripture Account of the Crea∣tion, is, what appears to me, utterly irre∣concilable with your Notions. <HI>Moses</HI> tells us of a Creation: A Creation of what? of Ideas? No, certainly, but of Things, of real Things, solid, corporeal Substances. Bring your Principles to agree with this, and I shall the sooner agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> mentions the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Earth and Sea, Plants and Animals: That all these do really exist, and were, in the Beginning, created by God, I make no question. If by <HI>Ideas,</HI> you mean Fictions, and Fancies of the Mind, then these are no Ideas. If by <HI>Ideas,</HI> you mean immediate Objects of the Understanding, or sensible Things, which cannot exist unperceived, or out of a Mind, then these Things are Ideas. But, whether you do, or do not call them <HI>Ideas,</HI> it matters little. The Difference is on∣ly about a Name. And, whether that Name be retained or rejected, the Sense, the Truth and Reality of Things, continues the same. In common Talk, the Objects of our Senses are not termed <HI>Ideas,</HI> but <HI>Things.</HI> Call them so still: Provided you do not attribute to them any absolute, external Existence, and
<PB N="144" REF="157"/>
I shall never quarrel with you for a Word. The Creation, therefore, I allow to have been a Creation of Things, of <HI>Real</HI> Things. Nei∣ther is this, in the least, inconsistent with my Principles, as is evident from what I have now said; and wou'd have been evident to you without this, if you had not forgotten what had been so often said before. But, as for solid, corporeal Substances, I desire you to shew where <HI>Moses</HI> makes any mention of them; and, if they shou'd be mentioned by him, or any other inspired Writer, it wou'd still be incumbent on you to shew, those Words were not taken in the vulgar Accep∣tation, for Things falling under our Senses, but in the Philosophic Acceptation, for Mat∣ter, or an unknown Quiddity, with an abso∣lute Existence. When you have proved these Points, then (and not till then) may you bring the Authority of <HI>Moses</HI> into our Di∣spute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in vain to dispute about a Point so clear. I am content to refer it to your own Conscience. Are you not satisfied, there is some peculiar Repugnancy between the <HI>Mo∣saic</HI> Account of the Creation, and your No∣tions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If all possible Sense, which can be put on the First Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> may be con∣ceived as consistently with my Principles as any other, then it has no peculiar Repugnan∣cy
<PB N="145" REF="158"/>
with them. But there is no Sense you may not as well conceive, believing as I do. Since, beside Spirits, all you conceive are Ideas; and the Existence of these I do not deny. Neither do you pretend, they exist without the Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, let me see any Sense you can understand it in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I imagine, that, if I had been present at the Creation, I should have seen Things produced into Being; that is, become perceptible, in the Order described by the Sa∣cred Historian. I ever before believed the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Account of the Creation, and now find no Alteration in my Manner of believing it. When Things are said to begin or end their Existence, we do not mean this with regard to God, but His Creatures. All Ob∣jects are eternally known by God, or, which is the same thing, have an eternal Existence in his Mind: But, when Things, before un∣perceptible to Creatures, are, by a Decree of God, made perceptible to them; then are they said to begin a relative Existence, with respect to created Minds. Upon reading, therefore, the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Account of the Crea∣tion, I understand, that the several Parts of the World became gradually perceivable to finite Spirits, endowed with proper Faculties; so that, whoever such were present, they were, in truth, perceived by them. This is the li∣teral,
<PB N="146" REF="159"/>
obvious Sense suggested to me, by the Words of the Holy Scripture: In which is included, no Mention, or no Thought, either of <HI>Substratum,</HI> Instrument, Occasion, or abso∣lute Existence. And, upon Inquiry, I doubt not, it will be found, that most plain, honest Men, who believe the Creation, never think of those things any more than I. What me∣taphysical Sense you may understand it in, you only can tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you do not seem to be aware, that you allow created Things, in the Beginning, only a relative, and, consequent∣ly, hypothetical, Being: That is to say, up∣on Supposition, there were Men to perceive them, without which they have no Actuality of absolute Existence, wherein Creation might terminate. Is it not, therefore, according to you, plainly impossible, the Creation of any inanimate Creatures shou'd precede that of Man? And, is not this directly contrary to the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Answer to that, I say, <HI>First,</HI> Crea∣ted Beings might begin to exist, in the Mind of other created Intelligences, beside Men. You will not, therefore, be able to prove any Contradiction between <HI>Moses</HI> and my No∣tions, unless you first shew, there was no other Order of finite created Spirits in Being, before Man. I say farther, in case we conceive the Creation, as we shou'd at
<PB N="147" REF="160"/>
this time a Parcel of Plants or Vegetables of all sorts, produced by an invisible Power, in a Desert where no body was present: That this Way of explaining or conceiving it, is consistent with my Principles, since they deprive you of nothing, either sensible, or imaginable: That it exactly suits with the common, natu∣ral, undebauched Notions of Mankind: That it manifests the Dependence of all Things on God; and, consequently, has all the good Ef∣fect or Influence, which it is possible that im∣portant Article of our Faith shou'd have, in making Men humble, thankful, and resigned to their great Creator. I say, moreover, that in this naked Conception of Things, divested of Words, there will not be found any No∣tion of what you call the <HI>Actuality of abso∣lute Existence.</HI> You may, indeed, raise a Dust with those Terms, and so lengthen our Di∣spute to no purpose. But I intreat you calm∣ly to look into your own Thoughts, and then tell me, if they are not an useless and unintel∣ligible Jargon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, I have no very clear Notion annexed to them. But, what say you to this? Do you not make the Existence of sensible Things consist in their being in a Mind? And, were not all Things eternally in the Mind of God? Did they not, therefore, exist from all Eternity, according to you? And, how cou'd that, which was Eternal, be crea∣ted
<PB N="148" REF="161"/>
in Time? Can any thing be clearer or better connected than this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, are not you too of Opinion, that God knew all Things from Eternity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequently, they always had a Be∣ing in the Divine Intellect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I acknowlege.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your own Confession, therefore, nothing is New, or begins to be, in respect of the Mind of God. So we are agreed in that Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall we make then of the Crea∣tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>May we not understand it to have been intirely in respect of finite Spirits; so that Things, with regard to us, may proper∣ly be said to begin their Existence, or be Created, when God decreed, they shou'd be∣come perceptible to intelligent Creatures, in that Order and Manner which He then esta∣blish'd, and we now call the Laws of Na∣ture? You may call this a <HI>relative,</HI> or <HI>hypo∣thetical Existence,</HI> if you please. But, so long as it supplies us with the most natural, ob∣vious, and literal Sense of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Histo∣ry of the Creation; so long as it answers all the religious Ends of that great Article; in a Word, so long as you can assign no other Sense or Meaning in its stead; why shou'd we reject this? Is it to comply with a ri∣diculous,
<PB N="149" REF="162"/>
Sceptical Humor, of making every thing Nonsense and Unintelligible? I am sure, you cannot say, it is for the Glory of God. For, allowing it to be a thing possi∣ble, and conceivable, that the corporeal World shou'd have an absolute Subsistence, extrinsi∣cal to the Mind of God, as well as to the Minds of all created Spirits: Yet, how cou'd this set forth either the Immensity or Om∣niscience of the Deity, or the necessary and immediate Dependence of all things on Him? Nay, wou'd it not rather seem to derogate from those Attributes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but as to this Decree of God's, for making Things perceptible: What say you, <HI>Philonous,</HI> is it not plain, God did either execute that Decree from all Eternity, or, at some certain time, began to will what He had not actually willed before, but only designed to will. If the former, then there cou'd be no Creation or Beginning of Existence in finite Things. If the latter, then we must acknow∣lege something new to befall the Deity; which implies a sort of Change: and all Change argues Imperfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, consider what you are doing. Is it not evident, this Objection concludes equally against a Creation in any Sense; nay, against every other Act of the Deity, disco∣verable by the Light of Nature: None of which can we conceive, otherwise than as per∣formed
<PB N="150" REF="163"/>
in Time, and having a Beginning? God is a Being of transcendent and unlimited Perfections: His Nature, therefore, is incom∣prehensible to finite Spirits. It is not, there∣fore, to be expected, that any Man, whether <HI>Materialist</HI> or <HI>Immaterialist,</HI> shou'd have ex∣actly just Notions of the Deity, His Attri∣butes, and Ways of Operation? If then you wou'd infer any thing against me, your Diffi∣culty must not be drawn from the Inadequate∣ness of our Conceptions of the Divine Na∣ture, which is unavoidable on any Scheme; but from the Denial of Matter, of which there is not one Word, directly or indirectly, in what you have now objected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must acknowlege, the Difficulties you are concerned to clear, are such only as arise from the Non-existence of Matter, and are peculiar to that Notion. So far you are in the right. But I cannot by any means bring myself to think, there is no such peculiar Re∣pugnancy between the Creation and your Opinion; tho, indeed, where to fix it, I do not distinctly know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wou'd you have! do I not ac∣knowlege a twofold State of Things? the one Ectypal or Natural, the other Archety∣pal and Eternal. The former was created in Time; the latter existed from Everlasting, in the Mind of God. Is not this agreeable to the common Notions of Divines? or, is any more
<PB N="151" REF="164"/>
than this necessary, in order to conceive the Creation? But you suspect some peculiar Repugnancy, tho you know not where it lies. To take away all Possibility of Scruple in the case, do but consider this one Point. Either you are not able to conceive the Creation on any Hypothesis whatsoever: And if so, there is no ground for Dislike or Complaint against my particular Opinion, on that Score. Or, you are able to conceive it; and if so, why not on my Principles, since thereby nothing conceivable is taken away? You have all along been allowed the full Scope of Sense, Imagination, and Reason. Whatever, there∣fore, you cou'd before apprehend, either im∣mediately or mediately, by your Senses, or by Ratiocination from your Senses; whatever you cou'd perceive, imagine, or understand, re∣mains still with you. If, therefore, the Notion you have of the Creation, by other Principles, be intelligible, you have it still upon mine; if it be not intelligible, I conceive it to be no Notion at all; and so there is no Loss of it. And, indeed, it seems to me very plain, that the Supposition of Matter, <HI>i. e.</HI> a thing per∣fectly unknown and inconceivable, cannot serve to make us conceive any thing. And, I hope, it need not be proved to you, that, if the Existence of Matter does not make the Creation conceivable, the Creation's being
<PB N="152" REF="165"/>
without it inconceivable, can be no Objection against its Non-Existence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, <HI>Philonous,</HI> you have almost satisfied me in this Point of the Creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd fain know why you are not quite satisfied. You tell me, indeed, of a Re∣pugnancy between the <HI>Mosaic</HI> History and Immaterialism: But you know not where it lies. Is this reasonable, <HI>Hylas?</HI> Can you expect I shou'd solve a Difficulty without knowing what it is. But, to pass by all that, Wou'd not a Man think you were assured, there is no Repugnancy between the received Notions of Materialists and the inspired Wri∣tings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ought the Historical Part of Scripture to be understood in a plain, obvious Sense, or in a Sense which is metaphysical, and out of the way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the plain Sense, doubtless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When <HI>Moses</HI> speaks of Herbs, Earth, Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as having been created by God; think you not, the sensible Things, common∣ly signified by those Words, are suggested to every unphilosophical Reader?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot help thinking so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not all Ideas, or Things per∣ceived by Sense, to be denied a real Existence by the Doctrine of the Materialists?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I have already acknowleged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="153" REF="166"/>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Creation, therefore, according to them, was not the Creation of Things sen∣sible, which have only a relative Being, but of certain unknown Natures, which have an absolute Being, wherein Creation might ter∣minate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not, therefore, evident, the Asser∣ters of Matter destroy the plain, obvious Sense of <HI>Moses,</HI> with which their Notions are utter∣ly inconsistent; and, instead of it, obtrude on us I know not what; something equally unintelligible to themselves, and me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot contradict you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> tells us of a Creation. A Crea∣tion of what? of unknown Quiddities, of Occasions, or <HI>Substratums?</HI> No, certainly; but of Things obvious to the Senses. You must first reconcile this with your Notions, if you expect I shou'd be reconciled to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, you can assault me with my own Weapons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, as to <HI>absolute Existence;</HI> was there ever known a more jejune Notion than that? Something it is, so abstracted and unintelligible, that you have frankly owned, you cou'd not conceive it, much less, explain any thing by it. But allowing Matter to exist, and the Notion of absolute Existence to be as clear as Light; yet, was this ever known to make the Creation more credible? Nay, has
<PB N="154" REF="167"/>
it not furnished the <HI>Atheists</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> of all Ages, with the most plausible Argument a∣gainst a Creation? That a corporeal Sub∣stance, which hath an absolute Existence, with∣out the Minds of Spirits, shou'd be produced out of nothing, by the meer Will of a Spi∣rit, has been looked upon as a thing so con∣trary to all Reason, so impossible and absurd, that not only the most celebrated among the Ancients, but even divers Modern and Chri∣stian Philosophers have thought Matter co∣eternal with the Deity. Lay these things to∣gether, and then judge you, whether Mate∣rialism disposes Men to believe the Creation of Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, <HI>Philonous,</HI> I think it does not. This of the <HI>Creation</HI> is the last Objection I can think of; and I must needs own, it has been sufficiently answered as well as the rest. No∣thing now remains to be overcome, but a sort of unaccountable Backwardness that I find in myself toward your Notions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When a Man is swayed, he knows not why, to one Side of a Question; Can this, think you, be any thing else, but the Ef∣fect of Prejudice, which never fails to attend old and rooted Notions? And, indeed, in this respect, I cannot deny the Belief of Mat∣ter to have very much the Advantage over the contrary Opinion, with Men of a learned Education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="155" REF="168"/>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, it seems to be as you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a Balance, therefore, to this Weight of Prejudice, let us throw into the Scale the great Advantages that arise from the Belief of Immaterialism, both in regard to Religion and Humane Learning. The Being of a God, and Incorruptibility of the Soul, those great Articles of Religion, are they not pro∣ved with the clearest and most immediate Evi∣dence? When I say the Being of a <HI>God,</HI> I do not mean an obscure, general Cause of Things, whereof we have no Conception, but <HI>God,</HI> in the strict and proper Sense of the Word. A Being, whose Spirituality, Omni∣presence, Providence, Omniscience, Infinite Power and Goodness, are as conspicuous, as the Existence of sensible Things, of which (notwithstanding the fallacious Pretences and affected Scruples of <HI>Sceptics)</HI> there is no more reason to doubt, than of our own Being. Then, with relation to Humane Sciences; in Natural Philosophy, what Intricacies, what Obscurities, what Contradictions, has the Be∣lief of Matter led Men into! To say nothing of the numberless Disputes about its Extent, Continuity, Homogeneity, Gravity, Divisibi∣lity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do they not pretend to explain all things by Bodies operating on Bodies, accor∣ding to the Laws of Motion? and, yet, are they able to comprehend, how any one Body shou'd move another? Nay, admitting there
<PB N="156" REF="169"/>
was no Difficulty, in reconciling the Notion of an inert Being with a Cause; or in con∣ceiving, how an Accident might pass from one Body to another; yet, by all their strain∣ed Thoughts and extravagant Suppositions, have they been able to reach the mechanical Production of any one Animal or Vegetable Body? Can they account, by the Laws of Motion, for Sounds, Tastes, Smells, or Co∣lours, or for the regular Course of Things? In fine, have they accounted, by Physical Prin∣ciples, for the Aptitude and Contrivance, even of the most inconsiderable Parts of the Uni∣verse? But, laying aside Matter and corpo∣real Causes, and admitting only the Efficiency of an All-perfect Mind, are not all the Effects of Nature easy and intelligible? If the <HI>Phae∣nomena</HI> are nothing else but <HI>Ideas;</HI> God is a a <HI>Spirit,</HI> but Matter an unintelligent, unper∣ceiving Being. If they demonstrate an unli∣mited Power in their Cause; God is Active and Omnipotent, but Matter an inert Mass. If the Order, Regularity, and Usefulness of them, can never be sufficiently admired; God is infinitely Wise and Provident, but Matter destitute of all Contrivance and Design. These, surely, are great Advantages in <HI>Phy∣sics.</HI> Not to mention, that the Apprehension of a distant Deity, naturally disposes Men to a Negligence in their <HI>moral</HI> Actions, which they wou'd be more cautious of, in case they
<PB N="157" REF="170"/>
thought Him immediately present, and acting on their Minds without the Interposition of Matter, or unthinking Second Causes. Then in <HI>Metaphysics;</HI> what Difficulties concerning Entity in Abstract, Substantial Forms, Hylar∣chic Principles, Plastic Natures, Subjects and Adjuncts, Principles of Individuation, Possibility of Matter's thinking, Origine of Ideas, the Man∣ner how two independent Substances, so wide∣ly different as <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Matter,</HI> shou'd mu∣tually operate on each other? What Diffi∣culties, I say, and endless Disquisitions con∣cerning these, and innumerable other the like Points, do we escape, by supposing only Spi∣rits and Ideas? Even the <HI>Mathematics</HI> them∣selves, if we take away the absolute Existence of extended Things, become much more clear and easy; the most shocking Paradoxes and intricate Speculations, in those Sciences, de∣pending on the infinite Divisibility of finite Extension, which depends on that Supposi∣tion. But, what need is there to insist on the particular Sciences: Is not that Opposition to all Science whatsoever, that Frenzy of the ancient and modern <HI>Sceptics,</HI> built on the same Foundation? Or, can you produce so much as one Argument against the Reality of cor∣poreal Things, or in behalf of that avowed utter Ignorance of their Natures, which does not suppose their Reality to consist in an ex∣ternal, absolute Existence? Upon this Sup∣position,
<PB N="158" REF="171"/>
indeed, the Objections from the Change of Colours in a Pigeon's Neck, or the Appearances of a broken Oar in the Wa∣ter, must be allowed to have Weight. But those, and the like Objections, vanish, if we do not maintain the Being of absolute, exter∣ternal Originals, but place the Reality of Things in Ideas, fleeting, indeed, and change∣able; however, not changed at random, but according to the fixed Order of Nature. For, herein consists that Constancy and Truth of Things, which secures all the Concerns of Life, and distinguishes that which is <HI>real</HI> from the irregular Visions of the Fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree to all you have now said, and must own, that nothing can incline me to em∣brace your Opinion, more than the Advan∣tages I see it is attended with. I am by Na∣ture lazy; and this wou'd be a mighty A∣bridgment in Knowlege. What Doubts, what Hypotheses, what Labyrinths of Amusement, what Fields of Disputation, what an Ocean of false Learning, may be avoided by that single Notion of <HI>Immaterialism?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>After all, is there any thing farther remaining to be done? You may remember, you promised to embrace that Opinion, which, upon Examination, shou'd appear most agree∣able to common Sense, and remote from <HI>Sce∣pticism.</HI> This, by your own Confession, is that which denies Matter, or the absolute
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
Existence of corporeal Things. Nor is this all; The same Notion has been proved seve∣ral Ways, viewed in different Lights, pur∣sued in its Consequences, and all Objections against it cleared. Can there be a greater Evidence of its Truth? or, is it possible, it shou'd have all the Marks of a true Opinion, and yet be false?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own myself intirely satisfied, for the present, in all respects. But what Security can I have, that I shall still continue the same full Assent to your Opinion, and that no un∣thought-of Objection or Difficulty will occur hereafter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>Hylas,</HI> do you in other Cases, when a Point is once evidently proved, with∣hold your Assent on account of Objections or Difficulties it may be liable to? Are the Difficulties that attend the Doctrine of incom∣mensurable Quantities, of the Angle of Con∣tact, of the Asymptotes to Curves, or the like, sufficient to make you hold out against Ma∣thematical Demonstration? Or, will you dis∣believe the Providence of God, because there may be some particular things which you know not how to reconcile with it? If there are Difficulties attending Immaterialism, there are, at the same time, direct and evident Proofs for it. But, for the Existence of Mat∣ter, there is not one Proof, and far more nu∣merous and insurmountable Objections lie
<PB N="160" REF="173"/>
against it. But, where are those mighty Dif∣ficulties you insist on? Alas! you know not where, or what they are; something which may possibly occur hereafter. If this be a sufficient Pretence for withholding your full Assent, you shou'd never yield it to any Pro∣position, how free soever from Exceptions, how clearly and solidly soever demonstra∣ted.</P>

<P>But, to arm you against all future Objections, do but consider, That which bears equally hard on two contradictory Opinions, can be a Proof against neither. Whenever, therefore, any Difficulty occurs, try if you can find a Solution for it on the Hypothesis of the <HI>Materialists.</HI> Be not deceived by Words; but sound your own Thoughts. And, in case you cannot conceive it easier by the Help of <HI>Materialism,</HI> it is plain, it can be no Objection against <HI>Immaterialism.</HI> Had you proceeded all along by this Rule, you wou'd probably have spared yourself abun∣dance of trouble in objecting; since, of all your Difficulties, I challenge you to shew one that is explained by Matter, nay, which is not more unintelligible with than without that Supposition, and, consequently, makes rather <HI>against</HI> than <HI>for</HI> it. You shou'd con∣sider, in each Particular, whether the Diffi∣culty arises from the <HI>Non-existence of Matter.</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="174"/>
If it does not, you might as well argue from the infinite Divisibility of Extension against the Divine Prescience, as from such a Diffi∣culty against <HI>Immaterialism.</HI> And, yet, upon Recollection, I believe, you will find this to have been often, if not always, the Case. You shou'd, likewise, take heed not to ar∣gue on a <HI>petitio Principii.</HI> One is apt to say, The unknown Substances ought to be esteemed real Things, rather than the Ideas in our Minds: And, who can tell but the unthinking external Substance may concurr, as a Cause or Instrument in the Production of our Ideas? But is not this, proceeding on a Supposition that there are such external Substances? And to suppose this, is it not Begging the Question? But, above all things, you shou'd beware of imposing on your∣self, by that vulgar Sophism which is cal∣led <HI>Ignoratio Elenchi.</HI> You talked often, as if you thought I maintained the Non-exi∣stence of sensible Things: Whereas, in truth, no one can be more thorowly assured of their Existence than I am: And it is you who doubt; I shou'd have said, positively deny it. Every thing that is seen, felt, heard, or any way perceived by the Senses, is, on the Principles I embrace, a real Being, but not on yours. Remember, the Matter you contend for, is an unknown somewhat, (if,
<PB N="162" REF="175"/>
indeed, it may be termed <HI>somewhat)</HI> which is quite stripped of all sensible Qualities, and can neither be perceived by Sense, nor ap∣prehended by the Mind. Remember, I say, that it is not any Object which is hard or soft, hot or cold, blue or white, round or square, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For all these things, I affirm, do exist. Tho, indeed, I deny, they have an Existence distinct from being perceived; or, that they exist out of all Minds whatsoever. Think on these Points; let them be attentively consider∣ed, and still kept in view. Otherwise, you will not comprehend the State of the Question; without which, your Objections will always be wide of the Mark, and, instead of mine, may possibly be directed (as more than once they have been) against your own No∣tions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must needs own, <HI>Philonous,</HI> nothing seems to have kept me from agreeing with you, more than this same <HI>mistaking the Que∣stion.</HI> In denying Matter, at first glympse, I am tempted to imagine, you deny the Things we see and feel; but, upon Reflexion, find there is no Ground for it. What think you, therefore, of retaining the Name <HI>Matter,</HI> and applying it to sensible Things? This may be done without any Change in your Senti∣ments: And, believe me, it wou'd be a Means of reconciling them to some Persons,
<PB N="163" REF="176"/>
who may be more shocked at an Innovation in Words, than in Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart: Retain the Word <HI>Matter,</HI> and apply it to the Ob∣jects of Sense, if you please, provided you do not attribute to them any Subsi∣stence distinct from their being perceived. I shall never quarrel with you for an Expres∣sion. <HI>Matter,</HI> or <HI>material Substance,</HI> are Terms introduced by Philosophers; and, as used by them, imply a sort of Independen∣cy, or a Subsistence distinct from being per∣ceived by a Mind: But, are never used by common People; or, if ever, it is to signify the immediate Objects of Sense. One wou'd think, therefore, so long as the Names of all particular Things, with the Terms, <HI>sensible Substance, Body, Stuff,</HI> and the like, are re∣tained, the Word <HI>Matter</HI> shou'd be never missed in common Talk. And, in Philo∣sophical Discourses, it seems the best way to leave it quite out; since there is not, per∣haps, any one thing that hath more favo∣red and strengthened the depraved Bent of the Mind toward <HI>Atheism,</HI> than the Use of that general confused Term.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, <HI>Philonous,</HI> since I am con∣tent to give up the Notion of an unthink∣ing Substance exterior to the Mind, I think you ought not to deny me the Privilege of
<PB N="164" REF="177"/>
using the Word <HI>Matter</HI> as I please, and an∣nexing it to a Collection of sensible Quali∣ties subsisting only in the Mind. I freely own, there is no other Substance, in a strict Sense, than <HI>Spirit.</HI> But I have been so long accustomed to the Term <HI>Matter,</HI> that I know not how to part with it. To say, There is no <HI>Matter</HI> in the World, is still shocking to me. Whereas, to say, There is no <HI>Matter,</HI> if, by that Term be meant, an unthinking Substance existing without the Mind: But, if by <HI>Matter</HI> is meant some sensible Thing, whose Existence consists in being perceived, then there is <HI>Matter.</HI> This Distinction gives it quite another Turn: And Men will come into your Notions, with small Difficulty, when they are proposed in that manner. For, after all, the Controversy about <HI>Matter,</HI> in the strict Acceptation of it, lies altoge∣ther between you and the Philosophers; whose Principles, I acknowlege, are not near so natural, or so agreeable to the com∣mon Sense of Mankind, and Holy Scripture, as yours. There is nothing we either de∣sire or shun, but as it makes, or is appre∣hended to make, some Part of our Happi∣ness or Misery. But what has Happiness, or Misery, Joy or Grief, Pleasure or Pain, to do with absolute Existence, or with un∣known Entities, abstracted from all Relation
<PB N="165" REF="178"/>
to us? It is evident, Things regard us only as they are pleasing or displeasing: And they can please or displease, only so far forth as they are perceived. Farther, therefore, we are not concerned; and thus far, you leave things as you found them. Yet, still there is something new in this Doctrine. It is plain, I do not now think with the Philosophers, nor yet altogether with the Vulgar. I wou'd know how the Case stands in that respect: Precisely, what you have added to, or altered in my former Notions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend to be a Setter-up of <HI>New Notions.</HI> My Endeavors tend on∣ly to unite, and place in a clearer Light, that Truth which was before shared between the Vulgar and the Philosophers: The former being of Opinion, that <HI>those Things they im∣mediately perceive are the real Things;</HI> and the latter, that <HI>the Things immediately perceived, are Ideas which exist only in the Mind.</HI> Which Two Notions, put together, do, in effect, constitute the Substance of what I ad∣vance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been a long time distrusting my Senses; methought I saw things by a dim Light, and thro false Glasses. Now, the Glasses are removed, and a new Light breaks in upon my Understanding. I am clearly convinced, that I see things in their
<PB N="166" REF="179" MS="y"/>
native Forms; and am no longer in Pain a∣bout their unknown Natures, or absolute Existence. This is the State I find myself in at present: Tho, indeed, the Course that brought me to it, I do not yet thorowly com∣prehend. You set out upon the same Prin∣ciples, that <HI>Academics, Cartesians,</HI> and the like Sects, usually do; and, for a long time, it looked as if you were advancing their Philo∣sophical <HI>Scepticism;</HI> but, in the End, your Conclusions are directly opposite to theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, <HI>Hylas,</HI> the Water of yonder Fountain, how it is forced upwards, in a round Column, to a certain Height; at which it breaks, and falls back into the Bason, from whence it rose: Its Ascent, as well as De∣scent, proceeding from the same uniform Law or Principle of <HI>Gravitation.</HI> Just so, the same Principles which, at first View, lead to <HI>Scepticism,</HI> pursued to a certain Point, bring Men back to common Sense.</P>
