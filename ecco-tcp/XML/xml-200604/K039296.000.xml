<HEAD>TO Sir <HI>RICHARD STEELE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Men cast their Eyes upon Epistles of this Kind, from the Name of the Person who makes the Address, and of Him who receives it, they usu∣ally have Reason to expect Applauses improper either to be given or accepted by the Parties concern'd. I fear it will, at first Sight, be much more so in this Ad∣dress, than any other which has at any Time appear'd; but while common Dedications are stuff'd with pain∣ful Panegyricks, the plain and honest Business of this, is, only to do an Act of Justice, and to End a for∣mer Misunderstanding between the Author, and Him, whom She, here, makes Her Patron. In Considera∣tion that one knows not how far what We have said of each other, may affect our Character in the World, I take it for an Act of Honour to declare, on my Part, that I have not known a greater Mortification than when I have reflected upon the Severities which have flow'd from a Pen, which is now, You see, dispos'd as much to celebrate and commend You. On Your Part, Your sincere Endeavour to promote the Reputation
<PB REF="5"/>
and Success of this TRAGEDY, are infallible Testimonies of the Candour and Friendship you retain for Me. I rejoice in this publick Retribution, and with Pleasure acknowledge, That I find by Experi∣ence, that some useful Notices which I had the good Fortune to give You for Your Conduct in former Life, with some hazard to my Self, were not to be blotted out of Your Memory by any Hardships that follow'd them.</P>
<P>I KNOW You so well, that I am assur'd You already think I have, on this Subject, said too much; and I am confident You believe of Me, that did I not conceal much more, I should not say so much. Be then the very Memory of disagreeable Things forgot∣ten for ever, and give Me leave to Thank You for Your Kindness to this PLAY, and in return, to shew towards Your Merit the same Good-will. But when my Heart is full, and my Pen ready to express the kindest Sentiments to Your Advantage, I reflect upon what I have formerly heard You say, That the Fame of a Gentleman, like the Credit of a Merchant, must flow from his own intrinsick Value; and that all Means to enlarge it, which do not arise naturally from That real Worth, instead of promoting the Character of ei∣ther, did but lessen and render it suspicious. I leave You therefore, to the great Opportunities, which are daily in Your Power, of bestowing on Your Self, what no Body else can give You; and wishing You Health and Prosperity, I omit to dwell upon some very late
<PB REF="6"/>
Actions of Yours in Publick, which unhappy Preju∣dices made, as little expected from You, as the Zeal and Sollicitude which You shew'd for my private In∣terests in the Success of this PLAY. I shall say no more, trusting to the Gallantry of Your Temper for further Proofs of Friendship; and allowing You, like a true Woman, all the good Qualities in the World now I am Pleas'd with You, as well as I gave You all the ill One's when I was Angry with You: I remain with the greatest Truth,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Cannot suffer this <HI>PLAY</HI> to pass into the World, without expressing my Gratitude to the Ladies, who, in such a distinguishing Manner, graced and supported it. So much Beauty and good Nature, could not fail of rend'ring that Person happy, for whose Benefit they were employ'd: I think my self infinitely bless'd in their Smiles, since I can be sensible of no greater Glory, than to hear, that I have had the Honour to Please Them.</P>
<P>TO tell the World that Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Old∣field's</HI> Action was admirable, in the Parts of <HI>LUCIUS</HI> and <HI>ROSALINDA,</HI> is saying nothing New; they are so us'd to Charm the Audience, and Delight the best Judges of the Theatre: However, I beg leave to make them my publick Acknowledgments, and to please my self with what I have heard reported of their Per∣formance in this <HI>PLAY,</HI> which is, That tho' they have
<PB REF="8"/>
often shin'd in several greater Parts, yet, none ever became them better. Mr. <HI>Booth's</HI> masterly and grace∣ful Action supported <HI>LUCIUS;</HI> whilst Mrs. <HI>Old∣field's</HI> Charms, and enchanting Manner, gave Life and Beauty to the <HI>QUEEN.</HI></P>

<L>To Stage-Success He had a certain Way;</L>
<L>Something for all the People must be done,</L>

<L>This He thought easy, as to make a Treat,</L>
<L>And, for a Tragedy, gave this Receipt.</L>

<L>Take me, said He, a Princess Young and Fair,</L>
<L>Then take a Blooming Victor flush'd with War;</L>
<L>Let Him not owe, to vain Report, Renown,</L>
<L>But in the Ladies Sight cut Squadrons down;</L>
<L>Let Him, whom they themselves saw win the Field,</L>
<L>Him to whose Sword they saw whole Armies yield,</L>
<L>Approach the Heroin with dread Surprise,</L>
<L>And own no Valour Proof against bright Eyes:</L>

The Boxes are Your own—the Thing is hit,</L>
<L>And Ladies, as they near each other sit,</L>
<L>Cry, oh! <HI>How movingly that Scene is writ?</HI></L>
<L>For all the Rest, with Ease, Delights you'll sbape,</L>
<L>Write for the Heroes in the Pit, a <HI>Rape:</HI></L>
<L>Give the First Gallery a <HI>Ghost;</HI> on th' Upper,</L>
<L>Bestow, tho' at that distance, a good <HI>Supper.</HI></L>
<L>Thus all their Fancies, working their own Way,</L>
<L>They're Pleas'd, and think they owe it to the Play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the Ambitious Author of these Scenes,</L>
<L>With no low Arts, to court your Favour means;</L>
<L>With Her Success, and Disappointment, move,</L>
<L>On the just Laws of Empire, and of Love!</L>

<LG>
<L>IN ancient Days (the Time we do not know,</L>
<L>It is so very, very long ago)</L>
<L><HI>Envy</HI> was forc'd to lead an harmless Life,</L>
<L>To stay at home, a meer <HI>Italian</HI> Wife.</L>
<L>Wou'd ye believe it, Ladies? Tet, 'tis true,</L>
<L>She had not learn'd to Dress like One of Tou:</L>
<L>Nor did she then appear a thoughtless Beau,</L>
<L>Nor wore Cockades, nor into Armies go.</L>
<L>To Play-houses she ne'er presum'd to come,</L>
<L>And rarely visited the Drawing-room:</L>
<L>Ev'n Masquerades, where no One shews the Face,</L>
<L>Would not admit of <HI>Envy</HI> in the Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! happy Days, when Dulness fear'd no Lash,</L>
<L>The Author gave no Wit, yet got his Cash:</L>
<L>When an Attempt to Please, was taken well,</L>
<L>And, on weak Woman, never Critick fell.</L>
<L>But our new Taste, brings on a new Demand,</L>
<L>For Wit alone, at present, cannot stand;</L>
<L><PB REF="12"/>
You must have Scandal, Politicks, and Traps,</L>
<L>To raise the Ladies Blush, and Footmens Claps.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What can poor We expect, in such a Case?</L>
<L>Dare <HI>English</HI> Tragedy plead Hopes of Grace?</L>
<L>No Party favour'd, no Designs in view,</L>
<L>To make Old Times, club Faction with the New.</L>
<L>No <HI>double</HI> soft <HI>Entenders</HI> to excite,</L>
<L>No Politicks to please the Wise to Night,</L>
<L>Such a dull Play, could any Modern write?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! we own the Allegation just,</L>
<L>But 'tis to You, the shining Fair we trust;</L>
<L>As You are Fair, our Author hopes to find,</L>
<L>You can Forgive, and then You will be Kind.</L>
