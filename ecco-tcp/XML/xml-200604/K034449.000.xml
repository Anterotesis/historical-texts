<P>HOGARTH's MARRIAGE-A-LA-MODE has before furnished Materials to the Au∣thor of a Novel, published some Years ago, un∣der the Title of <HI>The Marriage-Act:</HI> But as that Writer persued a very different Story, and as his Work was chiefly designed for a Political Satire, very little Use could be made of it for the Service of this Comedy.</P>
<P>In Justice to the Person, who has been con∣sidered as the sole Author, the Party, who has hitherto lain concealed, thinks it incumbent on him to declare, that the Disclosure of his Name was, by his own Desire, reserved till the Publication of the Piece.</P>
<P>Both the Authors, however, who have be∣fore been separately honoured with the indul∣gence of the Publick, now beg Leave to make their joint Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception of the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. GARRICK.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>POETS and Painters, who from Nature draw</L>
<L>Their best and richest Stores, have made this Law:</L>
<L>That each should neighbourly assist his Brother,</L>
<L>And steal with Decency from one another.</L>
<L>To-night, your matchless Hogarth gives the Thought,</L>
<L>Which from his Canvas to the Stage is brought.</L>
<L>And who so fit to warm the Poet's Mind,</L>
<L>As he who pictur'd Morals and Mankind?</L>
<L>But not the same their Characters and Scenes;</L>
<L>Both labour for one End, by different Means:</L>
<L>Each, as it suits him, takes a separate Road,</L>
<L>Their one great Object, MARRIAGE-A-LA-MODE!</L>
<L>Where Titles deign with Cits to have and hold,</L>
<L>And change rich Blood for more substantial Gold!</L>
<L>And honour'd Trade from Interest turns aside,</L>
<L>To hazard Happiness for titled Pride.</L>
<L>The Painter dead, yet still he charms the Eye;</L>
<L>While England lives, his Fame can never die:</L>
<L>But he, who <HI>struts his Hour upon the Stage,</HI></L>
<L>Can scarce extend his Fame for Half an Age;</L>
<L>Nor Pen nor Pencil can the Actor save,</L>
<L>The Art, and Artist, share one common Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O let me drop one tributary Tear,</L>
<L>On poor <HI>Jack Falstaff</HI>'s Grave, and <HI>Juliet</HI>'s Bier!</L>
<L>You to their Worth must Testimony give;</L>
<L>'Tis in your Hearts alone their Fame can live.</L>
<L>Still as the Scenes of Life will shift away,</L>
<L>The strong Impressions of their Art decay.</L>
<L>Your Children cannot feel what you have known;</L>
<L>They'll boast of QUINS and CIBBERS of their own:</L>
<L>The greatest Glory of our happy few,</L>
<L>Is to be felt, and be approv'd by YOU.</L>

<P>Oh la! Ma'am! as sure as I'm alive, here is your husband—</P>

<P>Hush! my dear Betty! if any body in the house should hear you, I am ruined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me! it has frighted me to such a degree, that my heart is come up to my mouth.—But as I was a saying, Ma'am, here's that dear, sweet—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, and indeed, Ma'am, he is. I saw him crossing the court-yard in his boots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it.—But pray now, my dear Betty, be cautious. Don't mention that word
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
again, on any account. You know, we have agreed never to drop any expressions of that sort for fear of an accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Ma'am, you may depend upon me. There is not a more trustier creature on the face of the earth, than I am. Though I say it, I am as se∣cret as the grave—and if it's never told, till I tell it, it may remain untold till doom's-day for Betty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you are faithful—but in our circum∣stances we cannot be too careful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Ma'am!—and yet I vow and protest, there's more plague than pleasure with a se∣cret; especially if a body mayn't mention it to four or five of one's particular acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do but keep this secret a little while longer, and then, I hope you may mention it to any body.—Mr. Lovewell will acquaint the family with the nature of our situation as soon as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sooner, the better, I believe: for if he does not tell it, there's a little tell-tale, I know of, will come and tell it for him.</P>

<P>Fie, Betty!<STAGE>[blushing.</STAGE></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you may well blush.—But you're not so sick, and so pale, and so wan, and so many qualms—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have done! I shall be quite angry with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Angry!—Bless the dear puppet! I am sure I shall love it, as much as if it was my own.—I meant no harm, heaven knows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—say no more of this—It makes me uneasy—All I have to ask of you, is to be faithful and secret, and not to reveal this matter, till we disclose it to the family ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me reveal it!—if I say a word, I wish I may be burned. I wou'd not do you any harm for the world—And as for Mr. Lovewell, I am sure I have loved the dear gentleman ever since he got a tide∣waiter's place for my brother—But let me tell you both, you must leave off your soft looks to each
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
other, and your whispers, and your glances, and your always sitting next to one another at dinner, and your long walks together in the evening—For my part, if I had not been in the secret, I shou'd have known you were a pair of loviers at least, if not man and wife, as—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>See there now! again. Pray be careful.</P>
</SP>

<P>What!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, here comes Mr. Lovewell—Mind the caution I give you—I'll be whipped now, if you are not the first person he sees or speaks to in the family—However, if you chuse it, it's nothing at all to me—as you sow, you must reap—as you brew, so you must bake.—I'll e'en slip down the back-stairs, and leave you together. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Fanny</HI> alone.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P>I see, I see I shall never have a moment's ease till our marriage is made publick. New distresses croud in upon me every day. The sollicitude of my mind sinks my spirits, preys upon my health, and destroys every comfort of my life. It shall be revealed, let what will be the consequence.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Lovewell.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>My love!—How's this?—In tears?—Indeed this is too much. You promised me to sup∣port your spirits, and to wait the determination of our fortune with patience.—For my sake, for your own, be comforted! Why will you study to add to our uneasiness and perplexity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Lovewell! the indelicacy of a secret marriage grows every day more and more shock∣ing to me. I walk about the house like a guilty wretch: I imagine myself the object of the suspicion
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
of the whole family; and am under the perpetual terrors of a shameful detection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, indeed, you are to blame. The amiable delicacy of your temper, and your quick sensibility, only serve to make you unhappy.—To clear up this affair properly to Mr. Sterling, is the continual employment of my thoughts. Every thing now is in a fair train. It begins to grow ripe for a discovery; and I have no doubt of its concluding to the satisfaction of ourselves, of your father, and the whole family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>End how it will, I am resolved it shall end soon—very soon.—I wou'd not live another week in this agony of mind to be mistress of the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be too violent neither. Do not let us disturb the joy of your sister's marriage with the tumult this matter may occasion!—I have brought letters from Lord Ogleby and Sir John Melvil to Mr. Sterling.—They will be here this evening—and, I dare say, within this hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter—Only let us disclose our marri∣age immediately!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a few days, you may depend on it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-night—or to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I fear, will be impracticable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but you must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must! why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you must.—I have the most alarm∣ing reasons for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alarming indeed! for they alarm me, even before I am acquainted with them—What are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not tell me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at present. When all is settled, you shall be acquainted with every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sorry they are coming!—Must be dis∣covered!—What can this mean!—Is it possible you can have any reasons that need be concealed from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not disturb yourself with conjectures—but rest assured, that though you are unable to di∣vine the cause, the consequence of a discovery, be it what it will, cannot be attended with half the miseries of the present interval.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put me upon the rack.—I wou'd do any thing to make you easy.—But you know your father's temper.—Money (you will excuse my frank∣ness) is the spring of all his actions, which nothing but the idea of acquiring nobility or magnificence can ever make him forego—and these he thinks his money will purchase.—You know too your aunt's, Mrs. Heidelberg's, notions of the splendor of high life, her contempt for every thing that does not relish of what she calls Quality, and that from the vast fortune in her hands, by her late husband, she absolutely governs Mr. Sterling and the whole family: now, if they should come to the knowledge of this affair too abruptly, they might, perhaps, be incensed beyond all hopes of reconciliation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if they are made acquainted with it otherwise than by ourselves, it will be ten times worse: and a discovery grows every day more pro∣bable. The whole family have long suspected our affection. We are also in the power of a foolish maid-servant; and if we may even depend on her fidelity, we cannot answer for her discretion.—Dis∣cover it therefore immediately, lest some accident should bring it to light, and involve us in additional disgrace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—well—I meant to discover it soon, but would not do it too precipitately.—I have more than once sounded Mr. Sterling about it, and will attempt him more seriously the next opportunity. But my principal hopes are these.—My relationship
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
to Lord Ogleby, and his having placed me with your father, have been, you know, the first links in the chain of this connection between the two families; in consequence of which, I am at present in high favour with all parties: while they all remain thus well-affected to me, I propose to lay our case before the old Lord; and if I can prevail on him to me∣diate in this affair, I make no doubt but he will be able to appease your father; and, being a lord and a man of quality, I am sure he may bring Mrs. Heidelberg into good-humour at any time.—Let me beg you, therefore, to have but a little patience, as, you see, we are upon the very eve of a discovery, that must probably be to our advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Manage it your own way. I am per∣suaded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the mean time make yourself easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>As easy as I can, I will.—We had better not remain together any longer at present.—Think of this business, and let me know how you proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend on my care! But, pray, be chearful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Lovewell! What! always getting my foolish girl yonder into a corner!—Well—well—let us but once see her elder sister fast-married to Sir John Melvil, we'll soon provide a good husband for Fanny, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd to heaven, Sir, you would provide her one of my recommendation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yourself? eh, Lovewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your pleasure, Sir!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I flatter myself, that such a proposal would not be very disagreeable to Miss Fanny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better and better!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if I could but obtain your consent, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! you marry Fanny!—no—no—that will never do, Lovewell!—You're a good boy, to be sure—I have a great value for you—but can't think of you for a son-in-law.—There's no <HI>Stuff</HI> in the case, no money, Lovewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pretensions to fortune, indeed, are but moderate: but though not equal to splendor, sufficient to keep us above distress.—Add to which, that I hope by diligence to increase it—and have love, honour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But not the <HI>Stuff,</HI> Lovewell!—Add one little round o to the sum total of your fortune, and that will be the finest thing you can say to me.—You know I've a regard for you—would do any thing to serve you—any thing on the footing of friendship—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you think me worthy of your friend∣ship, Sir, be assured, that there is no instance in which I should rate your friendship so highly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! psha! that's another thing, you know.—Where money or interest is concerned, friendship is quite out of the question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where the happiness of a daughter is at stake, you wou'd not scruple, sure, to sacrifice a little to her inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inclinations! why, you wou'd not persuade me that the girl is in love with you—eh, Lovewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot absolutely answer for Miss Fanny, Sir; but am sure that the chief happiness or misery of my life depends entirely upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed now if your kinsman, Lord Ogleby, would come down handsomely for you—but that's impossible—No, no—'twill never do—I
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
must hear no more of this—Come, Lovewell, pro∣mise me that I shall hear no more of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[hesitating.]</STAGE> I am afraid, Sir, I shou'd not be able to keep my word with you, if I did promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you wou'd not offer to marry her without my consent? wou'd you, Lovewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry her, Sir!<STAGE>[confused.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, marry her, Sir!—I know very well that a warm speech or two from such a dangerous young spark, as you are, will go much farther towards per∣suading a silly girl to do what she has more than a month's mind to do, than twenty grave lectures from fathers or mothers, or uncles or aunts, to pre∣vent her.—But you wou'd not, sure, be such a base fellow, such a treacherous young rogue, as to seduce my daughter's affections, and destroy the peace of my family in that manner.—I must insist on it, that you give me your word not to marry her without my consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—I—I—as to that—I—I—I beg, Sir—Pray, Sir, excuse me on this subject at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Promise then, that you will carry this matter no further without my approbation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend on it, Sir, that it shall go no further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—well—that's enough—I'll take care of the rest, I warrant you.—Come, come, let's have done with this nonsense!—What's doing in town?—Any news upon 'Change?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing material.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you seen the currants, the soap, and Madeira, safe in the warehouses? Have you com∣pared the goods with the invoice and bills of lading, and are they all right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are, Sir!</P>

<P>Well—well—some good news from America, and they'll be up again.—But how are Lord Ogleby and Sir John Melvil? When are we to expect them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very soon, Sir! I came on purpose to bring you their commands. Here are letters from both of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see—let me see—'Slife, how his Lordship's letter is perfumed!—It takes my breath away.— <STAGE>[opening it.]</STAGE> And French paper too! with a fine border of flowers and flourishes—and a slippery gloss on it that dazzles one's eyes.—<HI>My dear Mr. Sterling.</HI>— <STAGE>[reading.]</STAGE>—Mercy on me! His Lorship writes a worse hand than a boy at his exercise—But how's this?—Eh!—<HI>with you to-night</HI>— <STAGE>[reading.]</STAGE>—<HI>Lawyers to-morrow morning</HI>—To-night!—that's sudden indeed.—Where's my sister Heidelberg? she shou'd know of this immediately.—Here John!

<P>Mind now, how I'll entertain his Lordship and Sir John—We'll shew your fellows at the other end of the town how we live in the city—They shall eat gold—and drink gold—and lie in gold—Here cook! butler! <STAGE>[calling.]</STAGE> What signifies your birth and education, and titles?

<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir?—Why then have done with your nonsense of love and matrimony. You're not rich enough to think of a wife yet.

<SP>
<P>So!—As I suspected.—Quite averse to the match, and likely to receive the news of it with great dis∣pleasure.—What's best to be done?—Let me see!—Suppose I get Sir John Melvil to interest himself in this affair. He may mention it to Lord Ogleby with a better grace than I can, and more probably prevail on him to interfere in it. I can open my mind also more freely to Sir John. He told me, when I left him in town, that he had something of conse∣quence to communicate, and that I could be of use to him. I am glad of it: for the confidence he reposes in me, and the service I may do him, will ensure me his good offices.—Poor Fanny! It hurts me to see her so uneasy, and her making a mystery of the cause adds to my anxiety.—Something must be done upon her account; for at all events, her solli∣citude shall be removed. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Fie, sister! how could you be so abomina∣bly provoking?</P>

<P>Oh, I have no patience with the pride of your city-knights' ladies.—Did you never observe the airs of Lady Lutestring drest in the richest brocade out of her husband's shop, playing crown∣whist at Haberdasher's-Hall?—While the civil smirk∣ing Sir Joseph, with a smug wig trimmed round his broad face as close as a new-cut yew-hedge, and his shoes so black that they shine again, stands all day in his shop, fastened to his counter like a bad shilling?</P>

<P>Well, my dear! Now I shall have an opportunity of convincing you of the absurdity of what you was telling me concerning Sir John Mel∣vil's behaviour to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it gives me no manner of uneasi∣ness. But, indeed, Ma'am, I cannot be persuaded but that Sir John is an extremely cold lover. Such distant civility, grave looks, and lukewarm professions of esteem for me and the whole family! I have heard of flames and darts, but Sir John's is a passion of mere ice and snow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, fie, my dear! I am perfectly ashamed of you. That's so like the notions of your poor sister! What you complain of as coldness and indiffarence, is nothing but the extreme gentilaty of his address, an exact pictur of the manners of qua∣laty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he is the very mirror of complai∣sance! full of formal bows and set speeches!—I de∣clare, if there was any violent passion on my side, I should be quite jealous of him.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my mind the old lord, his uncle, has ten times more gallantry about him than Sir John. He is full of attentions to the ladies, and

smiles, and grins, and leers, and ogles, and fills every wrinkle in his old wizen face with comical expressions of tenderness. I think he wou'd make an admirable sweetheart.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The chief pleasure of a country house is to make improvements, you know, my Lord. I spare no expence, not I.—This is quite another-guess sort of a place than it was when I first took it, my Lord. We were surrounded with trees. I cut down above fifty to make the lawn before the house, and let in the wind and the sun—smack-smooth—as you see.—Then I made a green-house out of the old laundry,
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
and turned the brew house into a pinery.—The high octagon summer-house, you see yonder, is raised on the mast of a ship, given me by an East-India cap∣tain, who has turned many a thousand of my money. It commands the whole road. All the coaches and chariots, and chaises, pass and repass under your eye. I'll mount you up there in the afternoon, my Lord. 'Tis the pleasantest place in the world to take a pipe and a bottle,—and so you shall say, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay—or a bowl of punch, or a can of flip, Mr. Sterling! for it looks like a cabin in the air.—If flying chairs were in use, the captain might make a voyage to the Indies in it still, if he had but a fair wind.</P>

<P>No match?</P>

<P>No.</P>

<SP>

<P>You amaze me. What should prevent it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You! wherefore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't like her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very plain indeed! I never supposed that you was extremely devoted to her from inclination, but thought you always considered it as a matter of convenience, rather than affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. I came into the family with∣out any impressions on my mind—with an unim∣passioned indifference ready to receive one woman as soon as another. I looked upon love, serious, sober love, as a chimaera, and marriage as a thing of course, as you know most people do. But I, who was lately so great an infidel in love, am now one of its sincerest votaries.—In short, my defection from Miss Sterling proceeds from the violence of my attachment to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another! So! so! here will be fine work. And pray who is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is she! who can she be? but Fanny, the tender, amiable, engaging Fanny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fanny! What Fanny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fanny Sterling. Her sister—Is not she an angel, Lovewell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her sister? Confusion!—You must not think of it, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not think of it? I can think of nothing else. Nay, tell me, Lovewell! was it possible for me to be indulged in a perpetual intercourse with two such objects as Fanny and her sister, and not find my heart led by insensible attraction towards Her?—You seem confounded—Why don't you answer me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir John, this event gives me infinite concern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?—Is not she an angel, Love∣well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I foresee that it must produce the worst consequences. Consider the confusion it must una∣voidably create. Let me persuade you to drop these thoughts in time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never—never, Lovewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have gone too far to recede. A negotiation, so nearly concluded, cannot be broken off with any grace. The lawyers, you know, are hourly expected; the preliminaries almost finally settled between Lord Ogleby and Mr. Sterling; and Miss Sterling herself ready to receive you as a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the banns have been published, and nobody has forbidden them, 'tis true. But you know either of the parties may change their minds even after they enter the church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think too lightly of this matter. To carry your addresses so far—and then to desert her—and for her sister too!—It will be such an affront to the family, that they can never put up with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think so: for as to my transfer∣ring my passion from her to her sister, so much the better▪—for then, you know, I don't carry my af∣fections out of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but prithee be serious, and think better of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have thought better of it already, you see. Tell me honestly, Lovewell! Can you blame me? Is there any comparison between them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that now—why that—that is just—just as it may strike different people. There are many admirers of Miss Sterling's vivacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vivacity! a medley of Cheapside pert∣ness, and Whitechapel pride.—No—no—if I do go so far into the city for a wedding-dinner, it shall be upon turtle at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I see no probability of success; for granting that Mr. Sterling wou'd have consented to it at first, he cannot listen to it now. Why did not you break this affair to the family before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under such embarrassed circumstances as I have been, can you wonder at my irresolution or perplexity? Nothing but despair, the fear of losing my dear Fanny, cou'd bring me to a declaration
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
even now: and yet, I think I know Mr. Sterling so well, that, strange as my proposal may appear, if I can make it advantageous to him as a money-trans∣action, as I am sure I can, he will certainly come into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even suppose he should, which I very much doubt, I don't think Fanny herself wou'd listen to your addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are deceived a little in that parti∣cular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll find I am in the right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have some little reason to think other∣wise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have not declared your passion to her already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—And—and—and how did she receive it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is not very easy for me to make my addresses to any woman, without receiving some little encouragement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Encouragement! did she give you any encouragement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what you call encourage∣ment—but she blushed—and cried—and desired me not to think of it any more:—upon which I prest her hand—kissed it—swore she was an angel—and I cou'd see it tickled her to the soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did she express no surprise at your declaration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, to say the truth, she was a little surprised—and she got away from me too, be∣fore I cou'd thoroughly explain myself. If I should not meet with an opportunity of speaking to her, I must get you to deliver a letter from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I!—a letter!—I had rather have nothing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you promised me your assistance—and I am sure you cannot scruple to make yourself useful on such an occasion.—You may, without sus∣picion,
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
acquaint her verbally of my determined af∣fection for her, and that I am resolved to ask her father's consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, I—your commands, you know—that is, if she—Indeed, Sir John, I think you are in the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—well—that's my concern—Ha! there she goes, by heaven! along that walk yonder, d'ye see? I'll go to her immediately.</P>

<P>'Sdeath! I can't bear this. In love with my wife! acquaint me with his passion for her! make his ad∣dresses before my face!—I shall break out before my time.—This was the meaning of Fanny's uneasiness. She could not encourage him—I am sure she could not.—Ha! they are turning into the walk, and coming this way. Shall I leave the place?—Leave him to sollicit my wife! I can't submit to it.—They come nearer and nearer—If I stay it will look sus∣picious—It may betray us, and incense him—They are here—I must go—I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave me, Sir John, I beseech you leave me!—nay, why will you persist to follow me with
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
idle sollicitations, which are an affront to my cha∣racter, and an injury to your own honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know your delicacy, and tremble to offend it: but let the urgency of the occasion be my excuse! Consider, Madam, that the future happiness of my life depends on my present application to you! consider that this day must determine my fate; and these are perhaps the only moments left me to incline you to warrant my passion, and to intreat you not to oppose the proposals I mean to open to your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, for shame, Sir John! Think of your previous engagements! Think of your own situation, and think of mine!—What have you dis∣covered in my conduct that might encourage you to so bold a declaration? I am shocked that you should venture to say so much, and blush that I should even dare to give it a hearing.—Let me be gone!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, stay, Madam! but one moment!—Your sensibility is too great.—Engagements! what engagements have even been pretended on either side than those of family-convenience? I went on in the trammels of matrimonial negotiation with a blind submission to your father and Lord Ogleby; but my heart soon claimed a right to be consulted. It has devoted itself to you, and obliges me to plead earnest∣ly for the same tender interest in your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, Sir John! do not mistake a depraved will for a virtuous inclination. By these common pretences of the heart, half of our sex are made fools, and a greater part of yours despise them for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Affection, you will allow, is involuntary. We cannot always direct it to the object on which it should fix—But when it is once inviolably attached, inviolably as mine is to you, it often creates recipro∣cal affection.—When I last urged you on this subject, you heard me with more temper, and I hoped with some compassion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deceived yourself. If I forbore to exert a proper spirit, nay if I did not even express the quickest resentment of your behaviour, it was only in consideration of that respect I wish to pay you, in honour to my sister: and be assured, Sir, woman as I am, that my vanity could reap no pleasure from a triumph, that must result from the blackest treachery to her. <STAGE>[going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>One word, and I have done. <STAGE>[stopping her.]</STAGE>—Your impatience and anxiety, and the urgency of the occasion, oblige me to be brief and explicit with you.—I appeal therefore from your delicacy to your justice.—Your sister, I verily believe, neither entertains any real affection for me, or tenderness for you.—Your father, I am inclined to think, is not much concerned by means of which of his daughters the families are united.—Now as they cannot, shall not be connected, otherwise than by my union with you, why will you, from a false delicacy, oppose a measure so conducive to my happiness, and, I hope, your own?—I love you, most passionately and sin∣cerely love you—and hope to propose terms agreeable to Mr. Sterling.—If then you don't absolutely loath, abhor, and scorn me—if there is no other happier man—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, Sir! hear my final determina∣tion.—Were my father and sister as insensible as you are pleased to represent them;—were my heart for ever to remain disengaged to any other—I could not listen to your proposals.—What! You on the very eve of a marriage with my sister; I living under the same roof with her, bound not only by the laws of friendship and hospitality, but even the ties of blood, to contribute to her happiness,—and not to conspire against her peace—the peace of a whole family—and that my own too!—Away! away, Sir John!—At such a time, and in such circumstances, your addresses only inspire me with horror.—Nay, you must detain me no longer.—I will go.</P>

<P>True, Mr. Serjeant—and the easiest thing in the world too—for those country attornies are such ignorant dogs, that in case of the devise of an estate to A. and his heirs for ever, they'll make a query, whether he takes in fee or in tail.</P>

<P>I must be at Warwick, Mr. Sterling, the day after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, I shan't part with you to-night, gentlemen, I promise you—My house is very full, but I have beds for you all, beds for your servants, and stabling for all your horses.—Will you take a turn in the garden, and view some of my improve∣ments before dinner? Or will you amuse yourselves on the green, with a game of bowls and a cool tankard?—My servants shall attend you—Do you chuse any other refreshment?—Call for what you please;—do as you please;—make yourselves quite at home, I beg of you.—Here,—Thomas, Harry, William, wait on these Gentlemen!— <STAGE>[follows the lawyers out, bawling and talking, and then returns to Sir John.]</STAGE> And now, Sir, I am entirely at your service.—What are your commands with me, Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>After having carried the negotiation between our families to so great a length, after having assented so readily to all your proposals, as well as received so many instances of your chearful compli∣ance with the demands made on our part, I am extremely concerned, Mr. Sterling, to be the invo∣luntary cause of any uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Uneasiness! what uneasiness?—Where busi∣ness is transacted as it ought to be, and the parties understand one another, there can be no uneasiness. You agree, on such and such conditions to receive my daughter for a wife; on the same conditions I agree to receive you as a son-in-law; and as to all the rest, it follows of course, you know, as regularly as the pay∣ment of a bill after acceptance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir; more uneasiness has arisen than you are aware of. I am myself, at this instant, in a state of inexpressible embarrassment; Miss Sterling, I know, is extremely disconcerted too; and unless you will oblige me with the assistance of your friendship, I foresee the speedy progress of dis∣content and animosity through the whole family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the deuce is all this? I don't under∣stand a single syllable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>In one word then—it will be absolutely impossible for me to fulfill my engagements in regard to Miss Sterling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir John? Do you mean to put an affront upon my family? What! refuse to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be assured, Sir, that I neither mean to affront, nor forsake your family.—My only fear is, that you should desert me; for the whole happiness of my life depends on my being connected with your family by the nearest and tenderest ties in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, did not you tell me, but a moment ago, that it was absolutely impossible for you to marry my daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.—But you have another daughter, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who has obtained the most absolute dominion over my heart. I have already declared my passion to her; nay, Miss Sterling herself is also apprized of it, and if you will but give a sanction to my present addresses, the uncommon merit of Miss Sterling will no doubt recommend her to a person of equal, if not superior rank to myself, and our families may still be allied by my union with Miss Fanny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty fine, truly! Why, what the plague do you make of us, Sir John? Do you come to market for my daughters, like servants at a statute-fair? Do you think that I will suffer you, or any man in the world, to come into my house, like the
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
Grand Signior, and throw the handkerchief first to one, and then to t'other, just as he pleases? Do you think I drive a kind of African slave-trade with them? and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>A moment's patience, Sir! Nothing but the excess of my passion for Miss Fanny shou'd have induced me to take any step that had the least appear∣ance of disrespect to any part of your family; and even now I am desirous to atone for my transgression, by making the most adequate compensation that lies in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compensation! what compensation can you possibly make in such a case as this, Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Mr. Sterling; I know you to be a man of sense, a man of business, a man of the world. I'll deal frankly with you; and you shall see that I do not desire a change of measures for my own gratification, without endeavouring to make it advantageous to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What advantage can your inconstancy be to me, Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, Sir.—You know that by the articles at present subsisting between us, on the day of my marriage with Miss Sterling, you agree to pay down the gross sum of eighty thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now if you will but consent to my waving that marriage—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree to your waving that marriage? Im∣possible, Sir John!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Sir; as on my part, I will agree to wave my right to thirty thousand pounds of the fortune I was to receive with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thirty thousand, d'ye say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; and accept of Miss Fanny with fifty thousand, instead of fourscore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifty thousand— <STAGE>[pausing.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Instead of fourscore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why,—why,—there may be something in that.—Let me see; Fanny with fifty thousand instead of Betsey with fourscore—But how can this be, Sir John?—For you know I am to pay this money into the hands of my Lord Ogleby; who, I believe—between you and me, Sir John,—is not overstocked with ready money at present; and threescore thou∣sand of it, you know, is to go to pay off the present incumbrances on the estate, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That objection is easily obviated.—Ten of the twenty thousand, which would remain as a surplus of the fourscore, after paying off the mort∣gage, was intended by his Lordship for my use, that we might set off with some little <HI>eclat</HI> on our marri∣age; and the other ten for his own.—Ten thousand pounds therefore I shall be able to pay you imme∣diately; and for the remaining twenty thousand you shall have a mortgage on that part of the estate which is to be made over to me, with whatever security you shall require for the regular payment of the interest, 'till the principal is duly discharged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—to do you justice, Sir John, there is something fair and open in your proposal; and since I find you do not mean to put an affront upon the family—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing was ever farther from my thoughts, Mr. Sterling.—And after all, the whole affair is nothing extraordinary—such things happen every day—and as the world has only heard generally of a treaty between the families, when this marriage takes place, nobody will be the wiser, if we have but discretion enough to keep our own counsel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true; and since you only transfer from one girl to the other, it is no more than transferring so much stock, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odso! I had quite forgot. We are reckon∣ing without our host here. There is another diffi∣culty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You alarm me. What can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't stir a step in this business without consulting my sister Heidelberg.—The family has very great expectations from her, and we must not give her any offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you come into this measure, surely she will be so kind as to consent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that—Betsey is her darling, and I can't tell how far she may resent any slight that seems to be offered to her favourite niece.—However, I'll do the best I can for you.—You shall go and break the matter to her first, and by that time that I may suppose that your rhetorick has prevailed on her to listen to reason, I will step in to reinforce your argu∣ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll fly to her immediately: you pro∣mise me your assistance?</P>
</SP>

<P>She Lady Melville? Compose your∣self, Niece! I'll ladyship her indeed:—a little cree∣pin, cantin—She shan't be the better for a farden of my money. But tell me, child, how does this in∣triguing with Sir John correspond with her partiality to Lovewell? I don't see a concatunation here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I was deceived, Madam. I took all their whisperings and stealing into corners to be the mere attraction of vulgar minds; but, behold! their private meetings were not to contrive their own insipid happiness, but to conspire against mine.—But I know whence proceeds Mr. Lovewell's resentment to me. I could not stoop to be familiar with my fa∣ther's clerk, and so I have lost his interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My spurrit to a T.—My dear child! <STAGE>[kissing her.]</STAGE>—Mr. Heidelberg lost his election for member of parliament, because I would not demean myself to be slobbered about by drunken shoemakers, beastly cheesemongers, and greasy butchers and tallow-chandlers. However, Niece, I can't help dif∣furing a little in opinion from you in this matter. My experunce and sagucity makes me still suspect, that there is something more between her and that Lovewell, notwithstanding this affair of Sir John—I had my eye upon them the whole time of break∣fast.—Sir John, I observed, looked a little confound∣ed, indeed, though I knew nothing of what had passed in the garden. You seemed to sit upon thorns too: but Fanny and Mr. Lovewell made quite ano∣ther-guess sort of a figur; and were as perfet a pictur of two distrest lovers, as if it had been drawn by Raphael Angelo.—As to Sir John and Fanny, I want a matter of fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matter of fact, Madam! Did not I come unexpectedly upon them? Was not Sir John kneeling at her feet, and kissing her hand? Did not he look all love, and she all confusion? Is not that matter of fact? And did not Sir John, the moment that Papa was called out of the room to the lawyer∣men, get up from breakfast, and follow him imme¦diately? And I warrant you that by this time he has made proposals to him to marry my sister—Oh, that some other person, an earl, or a duke, would make his addresses to me, that I might be revenged on this monster!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be cool, child! you <HI>shall</HI> be Lady Melvil, in spite of all their caballins, if it costs me ten thousand pounds to turn the scale. Sir John may apply to my brother, indeed; but I'll make them all know who governs in this fammaly.</P>

<P>I agree to his marrying Fanny? abominable! The man is absolutely out of his senses.—Can't that wise head of yours foresee the conse∣quence of all this, brother Sterling? Will Sir John take Fanny without a fortune? No.—After you have settled the largest part of your property on your youngest daughter, can there be an equal portion left for the eldest? No.—Does not this overturn the whole systum of the fammaly? Yes, yes, yes. You know I was always for my niece Betsey's marrying a person of the very first quallaty. That was my maxum. And, therefore, much the largest settle∣ment was of course to be made upon her.—As for Fanny, if she could, with a fortune of twenty or thirty thousand pounds, get a knight, or a member of parliament, or a rich common-council-man for a husband, I thought it might do very well.</P>

<P>Nay, but I am even willing to—</P>
</SP>

<P>Ay, but if I was to accept it against her will, I might lose above a hundred thousand; so, you see, the ballance is against you, Sir John.</P>

<P>But is there no way, do you think, of prevailing on Mrs. Heidelberg to grant her consent?</P>

<P>Suppose I was to prevail on Lord Ogleby to apply to her, do you think that would have any influence over her?</P>

<P>I'll apply to him this very day.—And if he should prevail on Mrs. Heidelberg, I may depend on your friendship, Mr. Sterling?</P>

It will come with more irresistible persuasion

from you than from myself; and I doubt not but you'll gain his friendship and protection at once.—His influence and authority will put an end to Sir John's sollicitations, remove your aunt's and sister's un∣kindness and suspicions, and, I hope, reconcile your father and the whole family to our marriage.</P>

<SP>

<P>Your wishes shall be fulfill'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall they, my Lord!—but how—how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll marry in your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! my sister Heidelberg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>You throw me into a cold sweat, Mr. Sterling. No, not your sister—but your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fanny!—now the murder's out!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What <HI>you,</HI> my Lord?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—I, I, Mr. Sterling!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my Lord—that's too much. <STAGE>[smiling.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too much?—I don't comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you, my Lord, marry my Fanny!—Bless me, what will the folks say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what will they say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you're a bold man, my Lord—that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Sterling, this may be city wit for ought I know—Do you court my alliance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll explain.—My nephew won't marry your eldest daughter—nor I neither—Your youngest daughter won't marry him—I will marry your youngest daughter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! with a younger daughter's fortune, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>With any fortune, or no fortune at all, Sir. Love is the idol of my heart, and the daemon interest sinks before him. So, Sir, as I said before,
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
I will marry your youngest daughter; your youngest daughter will marry me.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who told you so, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her own sweet self, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: our affection is mutual; your advantage double and treble—your daughter will be a Countess directly—I shall be the happiest of beings—and you'll be father to an Earl instead of a Baronet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what will my sister say?—and my daugh∣ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll manage that matter—nay, if they won't consent, I'll run away with your daughter in spite of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my Lord!—your spirit's good—I wish you had my constitution!—but if you'll ven∣ture, I have no objection, if my sister has none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll answer for your sister, Sir. Apropos! the lawyers are in the house—I'll have articles drawn, and the whole affair concluded to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well: and I'll dispatch Lovewell to London immediately for some fresh papers I shall want, and I shall leave you to manage matters with my sister. You must excuse me, my Lord, but I can't help laughing at the match—He! he! he! what will the folks say?<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a fellow am I going to make a fa∣ther of?—He has no more feeling than the post in his warehouse—But Fanny's virtues tune me to rap∣ture again, and I won't think of the rest of the family.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Lovewell</HI> hastily.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Lordship's pardon, my Lord; are you alone, my Lord?</P>

<P>No, my Lord, I am not alone! I am in company, the best company.</P>

<P>My Lord!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>What company have you there, my Lord?<STAGE>[smiling.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own ideas, Sir, which so croud upon my imagination, and kindle it to such a delirium of extasy, that wit, wine, musick, poetry, all combined, and each perfection, are but mere mortal shadows of my felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that your Lordship is happy, and I rejoice at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>You <HI>shall</HI> rejoice at it, Sir; my felicity shall not selfishly be confined, but shall spread its in∣fluence to the whole circle of my friends. I need not say, Lovewell, that you shall have your share of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I, my Lord?—then I understand you—you have heard—Miss Fanny has inform'd you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has—I have heard, and she shall be happy—'tis determin'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I have reached the summit of my wishes—And will your Lordship pardon the folly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, poor creature, how could she help it?—'Twas unavoidable—Fate and necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was indeed, my Lord—Your kindness distracts me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it did the poor girl, faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>She trembled to disclose the secret, and de∣clare her affections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The world, I believe, will not think her affections ill placed.</P>

</SP>

<P>From my very soul, Lovewell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your generosity overpowers me.— <STAGE>[bowing.]</STAGE>—I was afraid of her meeting with a cold reception.</P>

<P>She's a fine girl, Lovewell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her beauty, my Lord, is her least merit. She has an understanding—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her choice convinces me of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>—[bowing.]—</STAGE> That's your Lordship's good∣ness. Her choice was a disinterested one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—no—not altogether—it began with interest, and ended in passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, if you were acquainted with her goodness of heart, and generosity of mind, as well as you are with the inferior beauties of her face and person—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so perfectly convinced of their existence, and so totally of your mind touching every amiable particular of that sweet girl, that were it not for the cold unfeeling impediments of the law, I would marry her to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would, by all that's honourable in man, and amiable in woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry her!—Who do you mean, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Fanny Sterling, that is—the Coun∣tess of Ogleby that shall be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, could you expect less from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not expect this, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trade and accounts have destroyed your feeling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, my Lord. <STAGE>[sighs.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>The moment that love and pity en∣tered my breast, I was resolved to plunge into ma∣trimony, and shorten the girl's tortures—I never do any thing by halves; do I, Lovewell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, my Lord— <STAGE>[sighs.]</STAGE>—What an accident!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, Lovewell? thou seem'st to have lost thy faculties. Why don't you wish me joy, man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I do, my Lord. <STAGE>[sighs.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>She said, that you would explain what she had not power to utter—but I wanted no inter∣preter for the language of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But has your Lordship considered the consequences of your resolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; I am above consideration, when my desires are kindled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider the consequences, my Lord, to your nephew, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John has considered no conse∣quences himself, Mr. Lovewell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Sterling, my Lord, will certainly re∣fuse his daughter to Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John has already refused Mr. Ster∣ling's daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what will become of Miss Sterling, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that to you?—You may have her, if you will.—I depend upon Mr. Sterling's city∣philosophy, to be reconciled to Lord Ogleby's being his son-in-law, instead of Sir John Melvil, Baronet. Don't you think that your master may be brought to that, without having recourse to his calculations? Eh, Lovewell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Lord, that is not the ques∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever is the question, I'll tell you my answer.—I am in love with a fine girl, whom I resolve to marry.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Sir <HI>John Melvil.</HI></STAGE>
<P>What news with you, Sir John?—You look all hurry and impatience—like a messenger after a battle.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>After a battle, indeed, my Lord.—I have this day had a severe engagement, and wanting your Lordship as an auxiliary, I have at last muster∣ed
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
up resolution to declare, what my duty to you and to myself have demanded from me some time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the business then, and be as con∣cise as possible; for I am upon the wing—eh, Lovewell?<STAGE>[he smiles, and <HI>Lovewell</HI> bows.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find 'tis in vain, my Lord, to struggle against the force of inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Nephew—I am your wit∣ness, and will second the motion—shan't I, Love∣well?<STAGE>[smiles, and <HI>Lovewell</HI> bows.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship's generosity encourages me to tell you—that I cannot marry Miss Sterling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not at all surpriz'd at it—she's a bitter potion, that's the truth of it; but as you were to swallow it, and not I, it was your business, and not mine—any thing more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this, my Lord—that I may be per∣mitted to make my addresses to the other sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes—by all means—have you any hopes there, Nephew?—Do you think he'll succeed, Lovewell?<STAGE>[smiles, and winks at <HI>Lovewell.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>I think so too, but let the fool try.</P>

<P>Will your Lordship favour me with your good offices to remove the chief obstacle to the match, the repugnance of Mrs Heidelberg?</P>

<P>Mrs. Heidelberg▪—Had not you better begin with the young lady first? it will save you a great deal of trouble; won't it, Lovewell?— <STAGE>[smiles.]</STAGE>—but do what you please, it will be the same thing to me—won't it, Lovewell?— <STAGE>[conceitedly.]</STAGE>—Why don't you laugh at him?</P>

<P>I do, my Lord. <STAGE>[forces a smile.</STAGE></P>

<P>And your Lordship is not offended at this seeming inconstancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least. Miss Fanny's charms will even excuse infidelity—I look upon women as the <HI>ferae naturae,</HI>—lawfull game—and every man who is qualified, has a natural right to pursue them; Love∣well as well as you, and I as well as either of you.—Every man shall do his best, without offence to any—what say you, kinsmen?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why did not you obey him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am certain that his Lordship has open'd his heart to him about you, and those papers are wanted merely on that account—but as we shall discover all to-morrow, there will be no oc∣casion for them, and it would be idle in me to go.</P>

<P>But it shan't—I would rather tell our story this moment to all the house, and run the risque of maintaining you by the hardest labour, than suffer you to remain in this dangerous per∣plexity.—What! shall I sacrifice all my best hopes and affections, in your dear health and safety, for the mean, and in such a case, the meanest consideration—of our fortune! Were we to be abandon'd by all our relations, we have that in our hearts and minds, will weigh against the most affluent circumstances.—I should not have propos'd the secrecy of our mar∣riage, but for your sake; and with hopes that the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Niece—consider a little—don't drag me out in this figur—let me put on my fly-cap!—if any of my Lord's fammaly, or the coun∣sellors at law, should be stirring, I should be per∣digus disconcarted.</P>

<P>But, my dear Madam, a moment is an age, in my situation. I am sure my sister has been plotting my disgrace and ruin in that chamber—O she's all craft and wickedness!</P>

<P>Well, but softly, Betsey!—you are all in emotion—your mind is too much flustrated—you

<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are disgrac'd already, Madam—Sir John Melvil has forsaken me; my Lord cares for nobody but himself; or, if for any body, it is my sister; my father, for the sake of a better bargain, would marry me to a 'Change-broker; so that if you, Madam, don't continue my friend—if your for∣sake me—if I am to lose my best hopes and conso∣lation—in your tenderness—and affect—ions—I had better—at once—give up the matter—and let my sister enjoy—the fruits of her treachery—trample with scorn upon the rights of her elder sister, the will of the best of aunts, and the weakness of a too interested father. <STAGE>[she pretends to be bursting into tears all this speech.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had no desire to sleep, and would not undress myself, knowing that my Machiavel sister would not rest till she had broke my heart:—I was so uneasy that I could not stay in my room, but when I thought that all the house was quiet, I sent my maid to discover what was going forward; she immediately came back and told me that they were in high consultation; that she had heard only, for it was in the dark, my sister's maid conduct Sir John Melvil to her mistress, and then lock the door.</P>

<P>By that right that makes me the happiest of men; and by a title which I would not forego, for any the best of kings could give me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been choaked with rage and won∣der; but now I can speak.—Zounds, what have you to say to me?—Lovewell, you are a villain.—You have broke your word with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, he has not—You forbad him to think of me, when it was out of his power to obey you; we have been married these four months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he shan't stay in my house four hours. What baseness and treachery! As for you, you shall repent this step as long as you live, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it is impossible to conceive the tortures I have already endured in consequence of my disobedience. My heart has continually upbraided me for it; and though I was too weak to struggle with affection, I feel that I must be miserable for ever with∣out your forgiveness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lovewell, you shall leave my house di∣rectly;—and you shall follow him, Madam. <STAGE>[to Fanny.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if they do, I will receive them into mine. Look ye, Mr. Sterling, there have been some
<PB N="89" REF="94"/>
mistakes, which we had all better forget for our own sakes; and the best way to forget them is to forgive the cause of them; which I do from my soul.—Poor girl! I swore to support her affection with my life and fortune;—'tis a debt of honour, and must be paid—you swore as much too, Mr. Sterling; but your laws in the city will excuse <HI>you,</HI> I suppose; for you never strike a ballance without errors excepted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a father, my Lord; but for the sake of all other fathers, I think I ought not to forgive her, for fear of encouraging other silly girls like herself to throw themselves away without the consent of their parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there will be no danger of that, Sir. Young ladies with minds, like my Fanny's, would startle at the very shadow of vice; and when they know to what uneasiness only an indiscretion has exposed her, her example, instead, of encouraging, will rather serve to deter them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indiscretion, quoth a! a mighty pretty delicat word to express disobedience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I indulge my own passions too much to tyrannize over those of other people. Poor souls, I pity them. And you must forgive them too. Come, come, melt a little of your flint, Mr. Sterling!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, why—as to that, my Lord—to be sure he is a relation of yours my Lord—what say <HI>you,</HI> sister Heidelberg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Heidel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girl's ruined, and I forgive her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sterl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—so do I then.—Nay, no thanks— <STAGE>[to Lovewell and Fanny, who seem preparing to speak]</STAGE> there's an end of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ogle.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Lovewell, what makes you dumb all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your kindness, my Lord—I can scarce believe my own senses—they are all in a tumult of fear, joy, love, expectation, and gratitude; I ever was, and am now more bound in duty to your Lord∣ship;
<PB N="90" REF="95"/>
for you, Mr. Sterling, if every moment of my life, spent gratefully in your service, will in some measure compensate the want of fortune, you perhaps will not repent your goodness to me. And you, ladies, I flatter myself, will not for the future suspect me of artifice and intrigue—I shall be happy to oblige, and serve you.—As for you, Sir John—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No apologies to me, Lovewell, I do not deserve any. All I have to offer in excuse for what has happened, is my total ignorance of your situa∣tion. Had you dealt a little more openly with me, you would have saved me, and yourself, and that lady, (who I hope will pardon my behaviour) a great deal of uneasiness. Give me leave, however, to assure you, that light and capricious as I may have ap∣peared, now my infatuation is over, I have sensibility enough to be ashamed of the part I have acted, and honour enough to rejoice at your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lovew.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my dearest Fanny, though we are seemingly the happiest of beings, yet all our joys will be dampt, if his Lordship's generosity and Mr. Sterling's forgiveness should not be succeeded by the indulgence, approbation, and consent of these our best benefactors. <STAGE>[To the audience.</STAGE></P>
