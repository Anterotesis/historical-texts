<HEAD>To the Right Honourable Sir <HI>John Percivale,</HI> Bar<SUP>t.</SUP> ONE OF Her Majesty's Most Honourable <HI>PRIVY COUNCIL</HI> IN THE Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cou'd not, without do∣ing Violence to my Self, forbear upon this Occa∣sion, to give some publick Testimony of the Great and Well-grounded Esteem
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
I have conceiv'd for You, e∣ver since I had the Honour and Happiness of Your Ac∣quaintance. The outward Advantages of Fortune, and the early Honours with which You are Adorn'd, to∣gether with the Reputation You are known to have, amongst the Best and most Considerable Men, may well imprint Veneration and E∣steem, on the Minds of those who behold You from a Distance. But these are not the chief Motives, that Inspire me with the Re∣spect I bear You. A nearer Approach has given me the View of something in Your Person, infinitely beyond
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
the External Ornaments of Honour and Estate. I mean, an Intrinsic Stock of Ver∣tue and good Sense, a True Concern for Religion, and disinterested Love of Your Country. Add to these an uncommon proficiency in the best, and most useful Parts of Knowledge; toge∣ther with (what in my Mind is a Perfection of the first Rank) a surpassing Good∣ness of Nature. All which I have Collected, not from the uncertain Reports of Fame but, from my own Ex∣perience. Within these few Months, that I have the Ho∣nour to be known unto You, the many delightful Hours
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
I have pass'd in Your Agree∣able and Improving Con∣versation, have afforded me the opportunity of Disco∣vering in You many Excel∣lent Qualities, which at once fill me with Admiration and Esteem. That one at those Years, and in those Cir∣cumstances of Wealth and Greatness, shou'd continue Proof against the Charms of Luxury, and those Cri∣minal Pleasures, so fashion∣able and predominant in the Age we live in. That He shou'd preserve a sweet and modest Behaviour, free from that insolent and assu∣ming Air, so familiar to those who are placed above
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
the ordinary Rank of Men. That He shou'd manage a great Fortune with that Pru∣dence and Inspection, and at the same time, expend it with that Generosity and Nobleness of Mind, as to shew Himself equally re∣mote, from a sordid Parsi∣mony, and a lavish, incon∣siderate Profusion of the good Things He is intrusted with. This, surely, were Ad∣mirable and Praise worthy. But that He shou'd moreo∣ver by an impartial Exercise of His Reason, and constant Perusal of the Sacred Scrip∣tures, endeavour to attain a right Notion of the Princi∣ples of Natural and Reveal∣ed
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Religion. That He shou'd with the Concern of a true Pa∣triot have the Interest of the Publick at Heart, and omit no means of Informing Himself what may be Prejudicial, or Advantageous to his Country, in order to prevent the one, and promote the other. In fine, that by a constant Appli∣cation to the most severe and useful Studies, by a strict Observation of the Rules of Honour and Vertue, by fre∣quent and serious Reflections on the mistaken Measures of the World, and the true End and Happiness of Mankind, He shou'd in all respects qua∣lify Himself, bravely to run the Race that is set before Him, to
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
deserve the Character of <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> in this Life, and be ever Happy hereafter. This were amazing, and almost in∣credible. Yet all this, and more than this, SIR, might I justly say of you; did either your Modesty permit, or your Character stand in Need of it. I know it might deser∣vedly be thought a Vanity in me, to imagine that any thing coming from so obscure a Hand as mine, cou'd add a lustre to your Reputation. But I am withal sensible, How far I advance the Interest of my own, by laying hold on this Opportunity to make it known, that I am admitted into some degree of Intimacy, with a Per∣son
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
of Your Exquisite Judg∣ment. And with that View, I have ventur'd to make You an Address of this Na∣ture, which, the Goodness I have ever experienced in You inclines me to hope, will meet with a favour∣able Reception at Your Hands. Tho' I must own, I have Your Pardon to ask, for touching on what may, possibly, be Offensive to a Vertue You are possest of in a very distinguishing Degree. Excuse me, SIR, if it was out of my Pow∣er, to mention the Name of SIR JOHN PERCIVALE, without paying some Tri∣bute to that Extraordina∣ry
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
and surprising Merit, whereof I have so lively and affecting an <HI>Idea,</HI> and which, I am sure, cannot be expos'd in too full a light for the Imitation of Others. Of late, I have been agreeably imploy'd in considering the most No∣ble, Pleasant, and Com∣prehensive of all the Sen∣ses. The fruit of that (La∣bour shall I call it or) Di∣version is what I now Pre∣sent You with, in Hopes it may give some Entertain∣ment to one who, in the midst of Business and Vul∣gar Enjoyments, preserves a Relish for the more Refin'd
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
Pleasures of Thought and Reflexion. My Thoughts concerning <HI>Vision</HI> have led me into some Notions, so far out of the common Road, that it had been im∣proper to Address them to one of a narrow and con∣tracted <HI>Genius.</HI> But You, SIR, being Master of a large and free Understanding, rais'd above the Power of those Prejudices that en∣slave the far greater Part of Mankind, may deser∣vedly be thought a pro∣per Patron for an Attempt of this Kind. Add to this, that You are no less dis∣pos'd to Forgive, than qua∣lify'd
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
to discern, whatever Faults may occur in it. Nor do I think You defective in any one Point neces∣sary to form an Exact Judg∣ment on the most abstract and difficult Things, so much as in a just Con∣fidence of Your own A∣bilities. And in this one Instance, give me leave to say, You shew a mani∣fest weakness of Judgment. With Relation to the fol∣lowing <HI>Essay,</HI> I shall only add, that I beg Your Par∣don for laying a Trifle of that Nature in your Way, at a time when you are engag'd in the Impor∣tant
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
Affairs of the Na∣tion, and desire you to think, that I am with all Sincerity and Respect</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY TOWARDS <HI>A New Theory of Vision.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Design.</HEAD>
<P>MY Design is to shew the man∣ner, wherein we perceive by Sight the Distance, Magm∣tude, and Situation of <HI>Objects.</HI> Also to consider the Difference there is be∣twixt the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight and Touch, and whether there be any <HI>Idea</HI> com∣mon to both Senses. In treating of all which, it seems to me, the Writers of <HI>Optics</HI> have proceeded on wrong Principles.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="2" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>II. Distance of it self In∣visible.</HEAD>
<P>It is, I think, agreed by all that <HI>Di∣stance</HI> of it self, and immediately can∣not be seen. For <HI>Distance</HI> being a Line directed end-wise to the Eye, it projects only one Point in the Fund of the Eye. Which Point remains invaria∣bly the same, whether the Distance be longer or shorter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. Remote Di∣stance per∣ceiv'd ra∣ther by Ex∣perience, than by Sense.</HEAD>
<P>I find it also acknowledg'd, that the Estimate we make of the Distance of <HI>Objects</HI> considerably remote, is ra∣ther an Act of Judgment grounded on <HI>Experience,</HI> than of <HI>Sense.</HI> For Exam∣ple, When I perceive a great number of intermediate <HI>Objects,</HI> such as Houses, Fields, Rivers, and the like, which I have experienced to take up a consi∣derable Space; I thence form a Judg∣ment or Conclusion, that the <HI>Object</HI> I see beyond them is at a great Distance. Again, when an <HI>Object</HI> appears Faint and Small, which at a near Distance I have experienced to make a vigorous and large Appearance; I instantly con∣clude it to be far off. And this, 'tis
<PB N="3" REF="26"/>
evident, is the result of <HI>Experience</HI>; without which, from the Faintness and Littleness, I should not have in∣fer'd any thing concerning the Di∣stance of <HI>Objects.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. Near Di∣stance thought to be percei∣ved by the <HI>Angle</HI> of the <HI>Optic Axes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But when an <HI>Object</HI> is placed at so near a Distance, as that the Interval between the Eyes bears any sensible Proportion to it. It is the receiv'd Opinion that the two <HI>Optic Axes</HI> (the Fancy that we see only with one Eye at once being exploded) concurring at the <HI>Object</HI> do there make an <HI>Angle,</HI> by means of which, according as it is Greater or Lesser, the <HI>Object</HI> is per∣ceiv'd to be nearer or farther off.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>V. Difference between this and the former manner of perceiving Distance.</HEAD>
<P>Betwixt which, and the foregoing manner of Estimating Distance, there is this remarkable Difference. That whereas, there was no apparent, ne∣cessary Connexion between small Di∣stance and a large and strong Ap∣pearance, or between great Distance, and a little and faint Appearance. Yet there appears a very necessary Con∣nexion
<PB N="4" REF="27"/>
between an obtuse Angle and near Distance, and an acute Angle and farther Distance. It does not in the least depend upon Experience, but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienc'd it, that the nearer the Concurrence of the <HI>Optic Axes,</HI> the greater the <HI>Angle,</HI> and the remoter their Concurrence is, the lesser will be the <HI>Angle</HI> comprehended by them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VI. Also by Di∣verging Rays.</HEAD>
<P>There is another way, mention'd by the <HI>Optic Writers,</HI> whereby they will have us judge of those Distan∣ces, in respect of which, the breadth of the <HI>Pupil</HI> hath any sensible bigness. And that is the greater or lesser Di∣vergency of the Rays, which issuing from the visible Point, do fall on the <HI>Pupil:</HI> That Point being judged near∣est, which is seen by most diverging Rays; and that remoter, which is seen by less diverging Rays. And so on, the apparent Distance still increasing, as the Divergency of the Rays decreases, till at length it becomes infinite, when the Rays that fall on the <HI>Pupil</HI> are to
<PB N="5" REF="28"/>
Sense Parallel. And after this manner it is said we perceive Distances when we look only with one Eye.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VII. This de∣pends not on Experi∣ence.</HEAD>
<P>In this Case also, 'tis plain we are not beholding to Experience: It be∣ing a certain, necessary Truth, that the nearer the direct Rays falling on the Eye approach to a <HI>Parallelism,</HI> the farther off is the Point of their In∣tersection, or the visible Point from whence they flow.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>VIII. These the common Accounts, but not sa∣tisfactory.</HEAD>
<P>I have here set down the common, current Accounts that are given of our perceiving near Distances by Sight, which, tho' they are unquestionably receiv'd for true by <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> and accordingly made use of by them in determining the apparent Places of <HI>Objects,</HI> do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory: And that for these following Reasons.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IX. Some <HI>Ideas</HI> perceived by the me∣diation of others.</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is evident that when the Mind perceives any <HI>Idea,</HI> not imme∣diately and of it self, it must be by
<PB N="6" REF="29"/>
the means of some other <HI>Idea.</HI> Thus, for Instance, the Passions which are in the Mind of another, are of them∣selves, to me invisible. I may never∣theless perceive them by Sight, tho' not immediately yet, by means of the Colours they produce in the Counte∣nance. We do often see Shame or Fear in the Looks of a Man, by per∣ceiving the Changes of his Counte∣nance to Red or Pale.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>X. No <HI>Idea</HI> which is not it self per∣ceived, can be the means of perceiving another.</HEAD>
<P>Moreover it is evident, that no <HI>I∣dea</HI> which is not it self perceiv'd, can be to me the means of perceiving any other <HI>Idea.</HI> If I do not perceive the Redness or Paleness of a Man's Face themselves, it is impossible I shou'd perceive by them the Passions which are in his Mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XI. Distance perceived by means of some other <HI>Idea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Now from <HI>Sect.</HI> II. 'Tis plain that Di∣stance is in it's own nature impercei∣vable, and yet it is perceiv'd by Sight. It remains therefore, that it be brought into view by means of some other <HI>Idea,</HI> that is it self immediately per∣ceiv'd in the Act of <HI>Vision.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<PB N="7" REF="30"/>
<HEAD>XII. Those Lines and Angles mentioned in <HI>Optics,</HI> are not themselves perceiv'd.</HEAD>
<P>But those <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Angles,</HI> by means whereof <HI>Mathematicians</HI> pretend to explain the Perception of Distance, are themselves not at all perceiv'd, nor are they in Truth, ever thought of by those unskilful in <HI>Optics.</HI> I appeal to any ones Experience, whether up∣on Sight of an <HI>Object,</HI> he compute it's Distance by the bigness of the <HI>An∣gle,</HI> made by the meeting of the two <HI>Optic Axes?</HI> Or whether he ever think of the greater or lesser Divergency of the Rays, which arrive from any Point to his <HI>Pupil.</HI> Nay, whether it be not perfectly impossible for him to per∣ceive by Sense, the various Angles wherewith the Rays according to their greater, or lesser Divergence do fall on his Eye. Every one is himself the best Judge of what he perceives, and what not. In vain shall all the <HI>Ma∣thematicians</HI> in the World tell me, that I perceive certain <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>An∣gles</HI> which introduce into my Mind the various <HI>Ideas</HI> of <HI>Distance</HI>; so long as I my self am conscious of no such thing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<PB N="8" REF="31"/>
<HEAD>XIII, Hence the Mind doth not perceive Distance by Lines and Angles</HEAD>
<P>Since therefore those <HI>Angles</HI> and <HI>Lines</HI> are not themselves perceiv'd by Sight, it follows from <HI>Sect.</HI> X. that the Mind does not by them judge of the Distance of <HI>Objects.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XIV. Also be∣cause they have no re∣al Exi∣stence.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Truth of this Asser∣tion will be, yet, farther evident to any one that considers those <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Angles</HI> have no real Existence in Na∣ture, being only an <HI>Hypothesis</HI> fram'd by <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> and by them in∣troduc'd into <HI>Optics,</HI> that they might treat of that Science in a <HI>Geometrical</HI> way.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XV. And be∣cause they are insuffi∣cient to ex∣plain the Phaenome∣na.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> and Last Reason I shall give for my Rejecting that Doctrine, is, that tho' we should grant the real Existence of those <HI>Optic Angles,</HI> &amp;c. and that it was possible for the Mind to perceive them; yet these Princi∣ples wou'd not be found sufficient to explain the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of <HI>Distance.</HI> As shall be shewn hereafter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<PB N="9" REF="32"/>
<HEAD>XVI. The <HI>Ideas</HI> that sug∣gest Di∣stance are 1<HI>st.</HI> the Sen∣sation ari∣sing from the turn of the Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>Now, It being already shewn that Distance is suggested to the Mind, by the Mediation of some other <HI>Idea</HI> which is it self perceiv'd in the Act of Seeing. It remains that we enquire what <HI>Idea,</HI> or <HI>Sensations</HI> there be that attend <HI>Vision,</HI> unto which we may suppose the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Distance are connected, and by which they are introduced into the Mind. And <HI>First,</HI> It is certain by Experience, that when we look at a near <HI>Object</HI> with both Eyes, according as it approaches, or recedes from us, we alter the Dispo∣sition of our Eyes, by lessening or widening the Interval between the <HI>Pupils.</HI> This Disposition or Turn of the Eyes is attended with a Sen∣sation, which seems to me, to be that which in this Case brings the <HI>Idea</HI> of greater, or lesser Distance into the Mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XVII. Betwixt which and Distance there is no necessary Connexion.</HEAD>
<P>Not, that their is any natural or necessary Connexion between the
<PB N="10" REF="33"/>
Sensation we perceive by the Turn of the Eyes, and greater or lesser Distance. But because the Mind has by constant <HI>Experience,</HI> found the dif∣ferent Sensations corresponding to the different Dispositions of the Eyes, to be attended each, with a Different Degree of Distance in the <HI>Object:</HI> There has grown an Habitual or Cu∣stomary Connexion, between those two sorts of <HI>Ideas.</HI> So that the Mind no sooner perceives the Sensation a∣rising from the different Turn it gives the Eyes, in order to bring the <HI>Pu∣pils</HI> nearer, or farther asunder; but it withal perceives the different <HI>Idea</HI> of Distance which was wont to be connected with that Sensation. Just as upon hearing a certain Sound, the <HI>Idea</HI> is immediately suggested to the Understanding, which Custom had united with it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XVIII. Scarce room for Mistake in this mat∣ter.</HEAD>
<P>Nor do I see, how I can easily be mistaken in this Matter. I know evidently that Distance is not per∣ceived
<PB N="11" REF="34"/>
of it self. That by consequence, it must be perceived by means of some other <HI>Idea</HI> which is immediate∣ly perceiv'd, and varies with the dif∣ferent Degrees of Distance. I know also that the Sensation arising from the Turn of the Eyes is of it self, im∣mediately perceiv'd, and various De∣grees thereof are connected with dif∣ferent Distances; which never fail to accompany them into my Mind, when I view an <HI>Object</HI> distinctly with both Eyes, whose Distance is so small that in respect of it, the Interval between the Eyes has any considerable Mag∣nitude.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XIX. No regard had to the Angle of the <HI>Optic Axes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I know it is a receiv'd Opinion, that by altering the disposition of the Eyes, the Mind perceives whether the Angle of the <HI>Optic Axes</HI> is made greater or lesser. And that accord∣ingly by a kind of <HI>Natural Geometry,</HI> it judges the Point of their Intersecti∣on to be nearer, or farther off. But that this is not true, I am convinc'd
<PB N="12" REF="35"/>
by my own Experience. Since I am not conscious, that I make any such use of the Perception I have by the Turn of my Eyes. And for me to make those Judgments, and draw those Conclusions from it, without knowing that I do so, seems altogether incomprehen∣sible.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XX. Judgment of Distance made with both Eyes, the Result of <HI>Experi∣ence.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From all which it plainly fol∣lows, that the Judgment we make of the Distance of an <HI>Object,</HI> view'd with both Eyes, is entirely the <HI>Re∣sult of Experience.</HI> If we had not constantly found certain Sensations arising from the various Dispositi∣on of the Eyes, attended with cer∣tain degrees of Distance. We shou'd never make those sudden Judgments from them, concerning the Distance of <HI>Objects</HI>; no more than we wou'd pretend to judge of a Man's Thoughts, by his pronouncing Words we had never heard before.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="section">
<PB N="13" REF="36"/>
<HEAD>XXI. 2dly, Con∣fusedness of Appear∣ance.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> An <HI>Object</HI> placed at a certain Distance from the Eye, to which the breadth of the <HI>Pupil</HI> bears a considerable Proportion, being made to approach, is seen more con∣fusedly. And the nearer it is brought, the more confused Appearance it makes. And this being found con∣stantly to be so, there arises in the Mind an <HI>Habitual</HI> Connexion be∣tween the several Degrees of Confu∣sion and Distance. The greater Con∣fusion still implying the lesser Di∣stance, and the lesser Confusion, the greater Distance of the <HI>Object.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXII. This the occasion of those Judg∣ments at∣tributed to diverging Rays.</HEAD>
<P>This confused Appearance of the <HI>Object,</HI> doth therefore seem to me to be the <HI>Medium,</HI> whereby the Mind judges of Distance in those Cases, wherein the most approv'd Writers of <HI>Optics</HI> will have it judge, by the different Divergency, with which the Rays flowing from the Radia∣ting Point fall on the <HI>Pupil.</HI> No
<PB N="14" REF="37"/>
Man, I believe, will pretend to see or feel those imaginary Angles, that the Rays are supposed to form accor∣ding to their various Inclinations on his Eye. But he cannot choose see∣ing whether the <HI>Object</HI> appear more, or less confused. It is therefore a manifest Consequence from what has been Demonstrated, that instead of the greater, or lesser Divergency of the Rays, the Mind makes use of the greater or lesser Confusedness of the Appearance, thereby to de∣termine the apparent Place of an <HI>Object.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXIII. Objection answer'd.</HEAD>
<P>Nor doth it avail to say, there is not any necessary Connexion be∣tween confused <HI>Vision,</HI> and Distance great, or small. For I ask any Man, What necessary Connexion he Sees, between the Redness of a Blush and Shame? And yet no sooner shall he behold that Colour to arise in the Face of another. But it brings in∣to his Mind the <HI>Idea</HI> of that Passion
<PB N="15" REF="38"/>
which has been observ'd to accom∣pany it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXIV. What de∣ceives the Writers of <HI>Optics</HI> in this mat∣ter.</HEAD>
<P>What seems to have misled the Writers of <HI>Optics</HI> in this Matter is, that they imagine Men judge of Di∣stance, as they do of a Conclusion in <HI>Mathematics</HI>; betwixt which and the Premises, it is indeed absolute∣ly requisite there be an apparent, necessary Connexion. But it is far otherwise, in the sudden Judg∣ments Men make of Distance. We are not to think, that Brutes and Children, or even grown reason∣able Men, whenever they perceive an <HI>Object</HI> to approach, or depart from them, do it by vertue of <HI>Geo∣metry</HI> and <HI>Demonstration.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXV. The Cause, why one <HI>I∣dea</HI> may suggest ano∣ther.</HEAD>
<P>That one <HI>Idea</HI> may suggest ano∣ther to the Mind, it will suffice that they have been observ'd to go toge∣ther; without any demonstration of the necessity of their Coexistence, or without so much as knowing
<PB N="16" REF="39"/>
what it is that makes them so to Coexist. Of this there are innume∣rable Instances, of which no one can be Ignorant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXVI. This apply∣ed to Con∣fusion and Distance.</HEAD>
<P>Thus greater Confusion having been constantly attended with near∣er Distance, no sooner is the for∣mer <HI>Idea</HI> perceiv'd, but it suggests the latter to our Thoughts. And if it had been the ordinary Course of Nature, that the farther off an <HI>Object</HI> were placed, the more Con∣fused it shou'd appear. It is certain, the very same Perception that now makes us think an <HI>Object</HI> approaches, would then have made us to ima∣gine it went farther off. That Per∣ception, abstracting from <HI>Custom</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> being equally fit∣ted to produce the <HI>Idea</HI> of great Di∣stance, or small Distance, or no Di∣stance at all.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXVII. 3<HI>dly,</HI> The straining of the Eye.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> an <HI>Object</HI> being placed at the Distance above specified, and
<PB N="17" REF="40"/>
brought nearer to the Eye, we may nevertheless prevent, at least for some time, the Appearance's grow∣ing more confus'd, by straining the Eye. In which Case, that Sensation supplys the place of confused <HI>Vision,</HI> in aiding the Mind to judge of the Di∣stance of the <HI>Object.</HI> It being esteem∣ed so much the nearer, by how much the effort, or straining of the Eye in order to distinct <HI>Vision,</HI> is greater.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XXVIII. The Occa∣sions which suggest Di∣stance, have in their own Nature no Relation to it.</HEAD>
<P>I have here set down those Sen∣sations or <HI>Ideas,</HI> that seem to me to be the constant and general Oc∣casions of introducing into the Mind, the different <HI>Ideas</HI> of near Distance. 'Tis true in most Cases, that divers other Circumstances contribute to frame our <HI>Idea</HI> of Distance, <HI>viz.</HI> the particular Num∣ber, Size, Kind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the things seen. Concerning which as well as all other the forementioned Oc∣casions which suggest Distance, I
<PB N="18" REF="41"/>
shall only observe, they have none of them, in their own Nature, any Relation or Connexion with it. Nor is it possible, they shou'd ever sig∣nifie the various Degrees thereof, otherwise than as by <HI>Experience</HI> they have been found to be connected with them.</P>

<P><PB N="24" REF="47"/><HI>In English as follows.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">I have here delivered what my Thoughts have suggested to me, concerning that part of <HI>Optics</HI> which is more properly <HI>Mathematical.</HI> As for the other parts of that Science (which being rather <HI>Physical,</HI> do consequently abound with plausi∣ble Conjectures, instead of certain Principles) there has in them scarce any thing occur'd to my Observa∣tion, different from what has been already said by <HI>Kepler, Scheinerus, Descartes,</HI> &amp;c. And, methinks, I had better say nothing at all, than repeat that which has been so of∣ten said by others. I think it there∣fore high time to take my leave of this Subject. But before I quit it for good and all, the fair and ingenuous Dealing that I owe both to You and to Truth, obliges me to acquaint you with a certain un∣toward Difficulty, which seems di∣rectly opposite to the Doctrine I
<PB N="25" REF="48"/>
have been hitherto inculcating, at least, admits of no Solution from it. In short it is this. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Before the double Convex Glass or Concave <HI>Speculum</HI> EBF, let the Point A be placed, at such a Distance that the Rays proceeding from A, after Re∣fraction or Reflecti∣on, be brought to Unite somewhere in the Ax AB. And suppose the Point of Union (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Image of the Point A, as hath been al∣ready set forth) to be Z; between which and B, the <HI>Vertex</HI> of the Glass or <HI>Speculum,</HI> conceive the Eye to be any where placed. The Questi∣on now is, Where the Point A ought to appear. Experience shews that it doth not appear behind at the Point Z, and it were contrary
<PB N="26" REF="49"/>
to Nature that it shou'd; since all the Impression which affects the Sense comes from towards A. But from our Tenents it shou'd seem to follow, that it wou'd appear be∣fore the Eye at a vast Distance off, so great as shou'd in some Sort, sur∣pass all sensible Distance. For since if we exclude all Anticipations and Prejudices, every <HI>Object</HI> appears by so much the farther off, by how much the Rays it sends to the Eye are less Diverging. And that <HI>Object</HI> is thought to be most remote, from which Parallel Rays proceed unto the Eye. Reason wou'd make one think, that <HI>Object</HI> shou'd appear, at yet a greater Distance, which is seen by converging Rays. More∣over it may in general be asked con∣cerning this Case, what it is that determines the apparent Place of the Point A, and maketh it to ap∣pear after a constant manner, some∣times nearer, at other times farther off? To which doubt, I see no∣thing
<PB N="27" REF="50"/>
that can be answer'd agree∣able to the Principles we have laid down, except only that the Point A ought always to appear extreamly remote. But on the contrary, we are assur'd by Experience that the Point A appears variously Distant, according to the different Situations of the Eye between the Points B and Z. And that it doth almost never (if at all) seem farther off, than it wou'd if it were beheld by the na∣ked Eye, but on the contrary, it doth sometimes appear much near∣er. Nay, it is even certain, that by how much the Rays falling on the Eye do more converge, by so much the nearer does the <HI>Object</HI> seem to approach. For the Eye being placed close to the Point B, the <HI>Object</HI> A appears nearly in it's own natural Place, if the Point B is taken in the Glass, or at the same Distance, if in the <HI>Speculum.</HI> The Eye being brought back to O, the <HI>Object</HI> seems to draw near. And
<PB N="28" REF="51"/>
being come to P it beholds it still nearer. And so on by little and little, till at length the Eye being placed somewhere, suppose at Q, the <HI>Object</HI> appearing extreamly near, begins to vanish into meer Confu∣sion. All which doth seem Repug∣nant to our Principles, at least, not rightly to agree with them. Nor is our Tenent alone struck at by this Experiment, but likewise all others that ever came to my Know∣ledge are, every whit as much, en∣danger'd by it. The ancient one especially (which is most common∣ly receiv'd, and comes nearest to mine) seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby, that the most learned <HI>Tacquet</HI> has been forc'd to reject that Principle, as false and uncertain, on which alone he had built almost his whole <HI>Catoptrics,</HI> and consequently by taking away the Foundation, hath himself pul∣led down the Superstructure he had raised on it. Which nevertheless,
<PB N="29" REF="52"/>
I do not believe he wou'd have done, had he but consider'd the whole matter more throughly, and examin'd the Difficulty to the bot∣tom. But as for me, neither this, nor any other Difficulty shall have so great an Influence on me, as to make me renounce that which I know to be manifestly agreeable to Reason. Especially when, as it here falls out, the Difficulty is founded in the peculiar Nature of a certain odd and particular Case. For in the present Case something peculiar lies hid, which being involv'd in the Subtilty of Nature will, perhaps, hardly be discover'd till such Time, as the manner of <HI>Vision</HI> is more per∣fectly made known. Concerning which, I must own, I have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least shew of <HI>Probability,</HI> not to mention <HI>Certainty.</HI> I shall there∣fore, leave this Knot to be united by you, wishing you may have bet∣ter Success in it than I have had.</Q></P>

<P>The ancient and receiv'd Principle which Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> here mentions, as the main Foundation of <HI>Tacquet</HI>'s <HI>Catop∣trics,</HI> is that, <HI>every visible Point seen by Reflexion from a</HI> Speculum, <HI>shall appear placed at the Intersection of the reflected Ray, and the Perpendicular of Incidence.</HI> Which Intersection in the present Case, happening to be behind the Eye, it greatly shakes the Authori∣ty of that Principle, whereon the aforemention'd Author proceeds throughout his whole <HI>Catoptrics,</HI> in determining the apparent Place of <HI>Objects</HI> seen by Reflexion from any kind of <HI>Speculum.</HI></P>

<P>The Eye, or (to speak truly) the Mind perceiving only the Confu∣sion it self, without ever consider∣ing the Cause from which it pro∣ceeds, doth constantly annex the same Degree of Distance, to the same Degree of Confusion. Whe∣ther that Confusion be occasion'd by Converging, or by Diverging Rays, it matters not. Whence it follows, that the Eye viewing the <HI>Object</HI> Z thro' the Glass QS (which by Refraction causeth the Rays ZQ, ZS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to converge) shou'd judge it to be at such a Nearness, at which if it were placed, it wou'd radiate on the Eye with Rays di∣verging to that Degree, as wou'd produce the same Confusion, which is now produced by Converging

<HEAD>XXXVIII. Lines and Angles why useful in <HI>Optics.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Hence also it doth appear, there may be good use of computation by Lines and Angles in <HI>Optics</HI>; not, that the Mind judges of Distance im∣mediately by them, but because it judges by somewhat which is con∣nected with them, and to the deter∣mination whereof, they may be sub∣servient. Thus the Mind judging of the Distance of an <HI>Object,</HI> by the Confusedness of it's Appearance; and this Confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked Eye, accord∣ing as the <HI>Object</HI> is seen by Rays more, or less Diverging; it follows, that a Man may make use of the Diver∣gency of the Rays, in computing the apparent Distance, tho' not for it's own sake, yet on account of the Confusion with which it is connect∣ed.
<PB N="39" REF="62"/>
But, so it is, the Confusion it self is entirely neglected by <HI>Mathema∣ticians,</HI> as having no necessary rela∣tion with Distance, such as the great∣er or lesser Angles of Divergency are conceiv'd to have. And these (espe∣cially for that they fall under <HI>Ma∣thematical</HI> Computation) are alone regarded, in determining the apparent Places of <HI>Objects,</HI> as tho' they were the sole and immediate Cause of the Judgments the Mind makes of Di∣stance. Whereas, in Truth, they shou'd not at all be regarded in them∣selves, or any otherwise, than as they are supposed to be the Cause of Con∣fused Vision.</P>

<HEAD>XXXIX. The not un∣derstand∣ing this, a cause of Mistake.</HEAD>
<P>The not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing Oversight. For Proof whereof, we need go no farther than the Case before us. It having been obser∣ved, that the most Diverging Rays brought into the Mind the <HI>Idea</HI> of nearest Distance, and that still, as
<PB N="40" REF="63"/>
the Divergency decreas'd, the Dist∣ance increas'd; and it being thought, the connexion between the various Degrees of Divergency, and Distance, was immediate; this naturally leads one to conclude, from an ill ground∣ed Analogy, that Converging Rays shall make an <HI>Object</HI> appear at an immense Distance: And that, as the Convergency increases, the Distance (if it were possible,) shou'd do so likewise. That this was the Cause of Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI>'s Mistake, is evident from his own Words which we have Quoted. Whereas, had the learn∣ed Doctor observ'd, that Diverging and Converging Rays, how oppo∣site soever they may seem, do ne∣vertheless agree in producing the same effect, <HI>viz. Confusedness of Vi∣sion,</HI> greater Degrees whereof are produced indifferently, either as the Divergency, or Convergency of the Rays increaseth. And that it is by this effect, which is the same in both, that either the Divergency, or Con∣vergency
<PB N="41" REF="64"/>
is perceived by the Eye. I say, had he but consider'd this, 'tis certain he wou'd have made a quite contrary Judgment, and rightly con∣cluded, that those Rays which fall on the Eye with greater degrees of Convergency shou'd make the <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> from whence they proceed, appear by so much the nearer. But 'tis plain, it was impossible for any Man to attain to a right Notion of this Matter, so long as he had regard only to Lines and Angles; and did not apprehend the true Nature of <HI>Vision,</HI> and how far it was of <HI>Mathematical</HI> Consideration.</P>

<HEAD>XL. A Query propos'd by Mr. <HI>Moly∣neux</HI> in his <HI>Diop∣trics,</HI> con∣sider'd.</HEAD>
<P>Before we dismiss this this Sub∣ject, 'tis fit we take Notice of a Query, relating thereto, propo∣sed by the Ingenious Mr. <HI>Moly∣neux,</HI> in his Treatise of <HI>Dioptrics, Par.</HI> 1. <HI>Prop.</HI> 31. <HI>Sect.</HI> 9. where speak∣ing of the Difficulty we have been explaining, he has these Words,
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="42" REF="65"/>
And so he (<HI>i. e.</HI> Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI>) leaves this Difficulty to the Solution of Others, which I (after so great an Example) shall do likewise; but with the Resolution of the same admirable Author of not quitting the evident Doctrine which we have before laid down, for determining the <HI>Locus Objecti,</HI> on account of being Press'd by one Difficulty, which seems in∣explicable till a more intimate Knowledge of the Visive Facul∣ty be obtain'd by Mortals. In the mean time, I propose it to the Consideration of the Ingeni∣ous, Whether the <HI>Locus Apparens</HI> of an <HI>Object</HI> placed as in this 9th <HI>Section,</HI> be not as much be∣fore the Eye, as the distinct Base is behind the Eye?</Q> To which Query we may venture to answer in the Negative. For in the pre∣sent Case, the Rule for determin∣ing the Distance of the distinct Base, or respective <HI>Focus</HI> from the
<PB N="43" REF="66"/>
Glass, is this. <HI>As the difference be∣tween the Distance of the</HI> Object <HI>and</HI> Focus ∶ <HI>is to the</HI> Focus <HI>or Fo∣cal Length</HI> ∷ <HI>So the Distance of the</HI> Object <HI>from the Glass</HI> ∶ <HI>to the Di∣stance of the respective</HI> Focus <HI>or Di∣stinct Base from the Glass. Vid.</HI> Moly∣neux <HI>Dioptr. Par.</HI> 1. <HI>Prop.</HI> 5. Let us now suppose the <HI>Object</HI> to be pla∣ced at the Distance of the Focal Length, and one half of the Fo∣cal Length from the Glass, and the Eye close to the Glass. Hence it will follow by the Rule, that the Distance of the Distinct Base behind the Eye is double the true Distance of the <HI>Object</HI> before the Eye. If therefore Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI>'s Con∣jecture held good, it wou'd follow, that the Eye shou'd see the <HI>Object,</HI> twice as far off as it really is. And in other Cases, at three or four times it's due Distance or more. But this manifestly contradicts Experience; the <HI>Object</HI> never appearing, at far∣thest, beyond its due Distance. What∣ever
<PB N="44" REF="67"/>
therefore is built on this Sup∣position (<HI>vid. Corol.</HI> 1. <HI>Prop.</HI> 57. <HI>ibid.</HI>) comes to the Ground along with it.</P>

The Sun and Stars, the remotest <HI>Ob∣jects</HI> as well as the nearer wou'd all seem to be in his Eye, or rather in his Mind.

time it seems agreed on all Hands, by those who have had any thoughts of that Matter, that Colours, which are the proper and immediate <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> of Sight, are not without the Mind. But then say you, by Sight we have also the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Exten∣sion, and Figure, and Motion; all which may well be thought without, and at some Distance from the Mind, tho' Colour shou'd not. In answer to this, I appeal to any Man's Experience, whether the visible Extension of any <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> do not appear as near to him, as the Colour of that <HI>Ob∣ject</HI>; Nay, whether they do not both seem to be in the very same Place. Is not the Extension we see Colour'd, and is it possible for us, so much as in Thought, to separate and abstract Colour from Extension? Now, where the Extension is, there surely is the Figure, and there the Motion too. I speak of those which are per∣ceiv'd by Sight.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="44" TYPE="section">
<PB N="47" REF="70"/>
<HEAD>XLIV. This more fully ex∣plain'd.</HEAD>
<P>But for a fuller Explication of this Point, and to shew that the immediate <HI>Objects</HI> of Sight are not so much as the <HI>Ideas</HI> or Resem∣blances of things placed at a Di∣stance, 'tis requisite we look near∣er into the Matter, and carefully observe what is meant in com∣mon Discourse, when one says, that which he sees is at a Distance from him. Suppose, for Example, That looking at the Moon I shou'd say, it were Fifty or Sixty Semi∣diameters of the Earth distant from me. Let us see what Moon this is spoken of. 'Tis plain it can∣not be the visible Moon, or a∣ny thing like the visible Moon, or that which I see, which is on∣ly a round, luminous Plain, of a∣bout Thirty visible Points in Dia∣meter. For in case I am carry'd, from the place where I stand di∣rectly towards the Moon; 'tis ma∣nifest the <HI>Object</HI> varies, still as I
<PB N="48" REF="71"/>
go on; and by the time that I am advanced Fifty or Sixty Se∣midiameters of the Earth, I shall be so far from being near a small, round, luminous Flat, that I shall perceive nothing like it; this <HI>Ob-ject</HI> having long since disappear'd, and if I wou'd recover it, it must be by going back to the Earth from whence I set out. Again, Suppose I perceive by Sight the faint and obscure <HI>Idea</HI> of some∣thing, which I doubt whether it be a Man, or a Tree, or a Tow∣er; but judge it to be at the Di∣stance of about a Mile. 'Tis plain I cannot mean, that what I see is a Mile off, or that it is the Image or Likeness of any thing which is a Mile off. Since that every Step I take towards it, the Appearance alters, and from be∣ing Obscure, Small, and Faint grows, Clear, Large, and Vigo∣rous. And when I come to the Mile's end, that which I saw
<PB N="49" REF="72"/>
first is quite lost, neither do I find any thing in the likeness of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="45" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XLV. In what Sense we must be un∣derstood to see Distance and exter∣nal Things.</HEAD>
<P>In these, and the like Instances, the truth of the Matter, I find, stands thus. Having of a long time, expe∣rienced certain <HI>Ideas,</HI> perceivable by Touch, as Distance, Tangible Figure, and Solidity to have been con∣nected with certain <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, I do upon perceiving these <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, forthwith conclude what Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> are, by the won∣ted, ordinary course of Nature like to follow. Looking at an <HI>Object</HI> I perceive a certain Visible Figure, and Colour with some degree of Faint∣ness and other Circumstances; which, from what I have formerly observ'd, determin me to think, that if I ad∣vance forward so many Paces, Miles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I shall be affected with such, and such <HI>Ideas</HI> of Touch. So that in truth, and strictness of Speech, I neither see Distance it self, nor any
<PB N="50" REF="73"/>
thing that I take to be at a Distance. I say, neither Distance, nor things placed at a Distance are themselves, or their <HI>Ideas,</HI> truly perceiv'd by Sight. This I am perswaded of, as to what concerns my self. And I believe whoever will look narrowly into his own Thoughts, and examin what he means by saying, he sees this, or that thing at a Distance, will agree with me that, what he sees only suggests to his Under∣standing, that after having passed a certain Distance, to be measur'd by the Motion of his Body, which is perceivable by Touch, he shall come to perceive such, and such Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> which have been usually connected with such and such Visible <HI>Ideas.</HI> But that one might be deceived by these sug∣gestions of Sense, and that there is no necessary Connexion, between Visible, and Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> suggested by them, we need go no farther than the next Looking-Glass or Pi∣cture,
<PB N="51" REF="74"/>
to be convinced. Note, that when I speak of Tangible <HI>Ideas,</HI> I take the Word <HI>Idea</HI> for any the im∣mediate <HI>Object</HI> of Sense, or Under∣standing, in which large Significati∣on it is commonly used by the Mo∣derns.</P>

<HEAD>XLVI. Distance and Things placed at a Distance, not other∣wise per∣ceived by the Eye than by the Ear.</HEAD>
<P>From what we have shewn it is a manifest Consequence, that the <HI>I∣deas</HI> of Space, Outness, and things placed at a Distance are not, strictly speaking, the <HI>Object</HI> of Sight. They are no otherwise perceived by the Eye, than by the Ear. Sitting in my Study I hear a Coach drive along the Streets. I look through the Case∣ment and see it. I walk out and enter into it. Thus, common Speech wou'd incline one to think, I heard, saw, and touch'd the same Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> the Coach. It is, nevertheless, certain, the <HI>Ideas</HI> intromitted by each Sense are widely different, and distinct from each other; but ha∣ving been observed constantly to go
<PB N="52" REF="75"/>
together, they are spoken of as one and the same thing. By the varia∣tion of the Noise, I perceive the different Distances of the Coach, and know that it approaches before I look out. Thus by the Ear I per∣ceive Distance, just after the same manner, as I do by the Eye.</P>

<HEAD>XLVII. The <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight more apt to be confoun∣ded with the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Touch than those of Hearing are.</HEAD>
<P>I do not, nevertheless, say I hear Distance, in like manner as I say that I see it, the <HI>Ideas</HI> perceiv'd by Hear∣ing not being so apt to be confound∣ed with the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Touch, as those of Sight are. So likewise, a Man is easily convinced that Bodies, and external Things are not properly the <HI>Object</HI> of Hearing, but only Sounds, by the Mediation whereof the <HI>Idea</HI> of this or that Body, or Distance is suggested to his Thoughts. But then one is with more difficulty, brought to discern the difference there is, betwixt the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight and Touch: Tho' it be certain, a Man no more Sees and Feels the same
<PB N="53" REF="76"/>
Thing, than he Hears and Feels the same Thing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="48" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XLVIII. How this comes to pass.</HEAD>
<P>One Reason of which seems to be this. It is thought a great Ab∣surdity to imagine that one, and the same thing, shou'd have any more than one Extension, and one Figure. But the Extension and Figure of a Body, being let into the Mind two ways, and that indifferently, either by Sight, or Touch, it seems to fol∣low that we see the same Extensi∣on, and the same Figure which we Feel.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="49" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XLIX. Strictly speaking, we never see and feel the same thing.</HEAD>
<P>But if we take a close and ac∣curate View of the Matter, it must be acknowledg'd, that we never See and Feel one and the same thing. That which is Seen is one thing, and that which is felt is another. If the Visible Figure and Extension be not the same, with the Tangi∣ble Figure and Extension, we are not to infer, that one and the same
<PB N="54" REF="77"/>
thing has divers Extensions. The true Consequence is, that <HI>the</HI> Ob∣jects <HI>of</HI> Sight <HI>and</HI> Touch <HI>are two distinct things.</HI> It may perhaps, re∣quire some Thought, rightly to con∣ceive this Distinction. And the dif∣ficulty seems not a little increas'd, because the Combination of Visi∣ble <HI>Ideas</HI> hath constantly the same Name, as the Combination of Tan∣gible <HI>Ideas</HI> wherewith it is con∣nected. Which does of necessity arise from the use, and end of Language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="50" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>L. <HI>Objects</HI> of <HI>Sight</HI> twofold Mediate and Imme∣diate.</HEAD>
<P>In order therefore to treat ac∣curately, and unconfusedly of <HI>Vi∣sion,</HI> we must bear in Mind, that there are two sorts of <HI>Objects</HI> ap∣prehended by the Eye: The one, pri∣marily and immediately, the other, secondarily and by intervention of the former. Those of the first sort neither are, nor appear to be with∣out the Mind, or at any distance off. They may, indeed, grow Great∣er,
<PB N="55" REF="78"/>
or Smaller, more Confused, or more Clear, or more Faint. But, they do not, cannot Approach, or even seem to Approach, or Re∣cede from us. Whenever we say an <HI>Object</HI> is at a Distance, when∣ever we say, it draws near, or goes farther off; we must always mean it of the latter sort, which proper∣ly belong to the <HI>Touch,</HI> and are not so truly perceived, as suggest∣ed, by the Eye, in like manner as Thoughts by the Ear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="51" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LI. These hard to separate, in our Thoughts.</HEAD>
<P>No sooner do we hear the Words of a familiar Language pronoun∣ced in our Ears, but the <HI>Ideas</HI> corresponding thereto present them∣selves to our Minds. In the very same instant, the Sound and the Meaning enter the Understanding. So closely are they United, that 'tis not in our Power to keep out the one, except we exclude the o∣ther also. We even act in all re∣spects, as tho' we heard the very

Thoughts themselves. So likewise, the Secondary <HI>Objects,</HI> or those which are only suggested by Sight, do often more strongly affect us, and are more regarded than the pro∣per <HI>Objects</HI> of that Sense; along with which they enter into the Mind, and with which they have a far more strict and near Con∣nexion, than <HI>Ideas</HI> have with Words. Hence it is, we find it so difficult to discriminate, between the im∣mediate and mediate <HI>Objects</HI> of Sight, and are so prone to at∣tribute to the former, what be∣longs only to the latter. They are, as it were, most closely twisted, blended, and incorporated together. And the Prejudice is confirm'd, and riveted in our Thoughts, by a long tract of Time, by the use of Language, and want of Reflexi∣on. However, I doubt not, but any one that shall attentively con∣sider what we have already said, and shall say upon this Subject be∣fore

<HEAD>LII. The recei∣ved Ac∣counts of our percei∣ving Mag∣nitude by Sight false</HEAD>
<P>I have now done with Distance, and proceed to shew, how it is, that we perceive by Sight, the Magni∣tude of Objects. It is the Opinion of some, that we do it by Angles, or by Angles in Conjuction with Distance. But neither Angles, nor Distance being perceivable by Sight: And the things we see being, in truth, at no Distance from us; it follows, that as we have demonstra∣ted Lines and Angles not to be the <HI>Medium,</HI> the Mind makes use of in apprehending the Apparent Place, so neither are they, the <HI>Medium</HI> where∣by it apprehends the Apparent Mag∣nitude of Objects.</P>

<HEAD>LIII. Magnitude perceiv'd as imme∣diately, as Distance.</HEAD>
<P>It is well known that the same Extension, at a near Distance, shall subtend a greater Angle, and at a farther Distance, a lesser Angle. And by this Principle (we are told) the Mind estimates the Magnitude of an <HI>Object,</HI> comparing the Angle under which it is seen, with its Distance, and thence infering the Magnitude thereof. What inclines Men to this Mistake (beside the Humour of ma∣king one see by <HI>Geometry</HI>) is, that the same Perceptions or <HI>Ideas</HI> which sug∣gest Distance, do also suggest Mag∣nitude. But if we examine it, we shall find they suggest the latter, as immediately as the former. I say, they do not first suggest Distance, and then leave it to the Judgment to use that as a <HI>Medium,</HI> whereby to collect the Magnitude; but they have as close, and immediate a Con∣nexion with the Magnitude, as with the Distance; and suggest Magni∣tude as independently of Distance,

<HEAD>LIV. Two kinds of sensible Extension, neither of which is infinitely Divisible.</HEAD>
<P>It has been shewn, there are two sorts of <HI>Objects</HI> apprehended by Sight; each whereof hath its distinct Mag∣nitude, or Extension. The one, pro∣perly Tangible, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be perceiv'd and measur'd by Touch, and not immediately falling under the Sense of Seeing. The other, properly and immediately Visible, by Mediation of which, the former is brought in View. Each of these Magnitudes are greater or lesser, according as they contain in them more or fewer Points; they being made up of Points or <HI>Minimums.</HI> For, whatever may be said of Extension in <HI>Abstract,</HI> it is certain sensible Extension is not in∣finitely Divisible.

<P>The Magnitude of the <HI>Object</HI> which exists without the Mind, and is at a Distance, continues always invariably the same. But the Visi∣ble <HI>Object</HI> still changing as you approach to, or recede from the Tangible <HI>Object,</HI> it hath no fixed and determinate Greatness. When∣ever therefore, we speak of the Mag∣nitude of any thing, for Instance a <HI>Tree</HI> or a <HI>House,</HI> we must mean the Tangible Magnitude, otherwise there can be nothing steddy, and free from Ambiguity spoken of it. Now, tho' the Tangible and Visi∣ble Magnitude do, in truth, belong to two distinct Objects: I shall ne∣vertheless (especially since those Ob∣jects are called by the same Name, and are observ'd to coexist) to a∣void tediousness and singularity of Speech, sometimes speak of them, as belonging to one and the same thing.</P>

<HEAD>LVI. By what means, Tan∣gible Mag∣nitude is perceiv'd by Sight.</HEAD>
<P>Now in order to discover by what means, the Magnitude of Tan∣gible Objects is perceived by Sight; I need only reflect on what Passes in my own Mind. And observe what those things be, which in∣troduce the <HI>Ideas</HI> of <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>les∣ser</HI> into my Thoughts, when I look on any <HI>Object.</HI> And these I find to be, First, the Magnitude or Ex∣tension of the Visible <HI>Object,</HI> which being immediately perceived by Sight, is connected with that other which is Tangible, and placed at a Distance. Secondly, The Confu∣sion or Distinctness. And, Thirdly, The Vigorousness or Faintness of the aforesaid Visible Appearance. <HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> by how much the greater or les∣ser, do I conclude the Tangible <HI>Object</HI> to be. But, be the <HI>Idea</HI> im∣mediately perceived by Sight never so large, yet if it be withal Con∣fused,
<PB N="62" REF="85"/>
I judge the Magnitude of the thing to be but small. If it be Distinct and Clear, I judge it greater. And if it be Faint, I ap∣prehend it to be yet greater. What is here meant, by Confusion and Faintness, has been Explain'd in <HI>Sect.</HI> XXXV.</P>

<HEAD>LIX. The Tangi∣ble Magni∣tude of an <HI>Object,</HI> more heed∣ed than the Visible; and why.</HEAD>
<P>Nor will it be found, that great or small Visible Magnitude hath any necessary Relation to great or small Tangible Magnitude: So that the one may certainly, and infallibly be infer'd from the other. But, before we come to the Proof of this, 'tis fit we consider the dif∣ference
<PB N="64" REF="87"/>
there is, betwixt the Ex∣tension and Figure which is the proper Object of <HI>Touch,</HI> and that other which is termed <HI>Visible</HI>; and how the former is principally, tho' not immediately, taken notice of, when we look at any <HI>Object.</HI> This has been before mention'd, but we shall here enquire into the Cause thereof. We regard the Ob∣jects that environ us, in propor∣tion as they are adapted to be∣nefit, or injure our own Bodies, and thereby, produce in our Minds the Sensations of Pleasure, or Pain. Now Bodies operating on our Or∣gans, by an immediate Applicati∣on: And the Hurt and Advantage arising there-from, depending alto∣gether on the Tangible, ang not at all on the Visible, Qualities of any Object. This is a plain Rea∣son, why those shou'd be regard∣ed by us much more than these. And for this End, chiefly, the <HI>Vi∣sive Sense</HI> seems to have been be∣stowed
<PB N="65" REF="88"/>
on Animals, <HI>viz.</HI> that by the Perception of Visible <HI>Ideas</HI> (which in themselves are not ca∣pable of affecting, or any wise alter∣ing the Frame of their Bodies) they may be able to foresee (from the Experience they have had, what Tan∣gible <HI>Ideas</HI> are connected with such, and such Visible <HI>Ideas</HI>) the Damage or Benefit which is like to ensue, upon the Application of their own Bodies to this, or that Body which is at a Distance. Which Foresight, how necessary it is to the preser∣vation of an Animal, every ones Experience can inform him. Hence it is, that when we look at an <HI>Object,</HI> the Tangible Figure and Extension thereof are principally attended to; whilst there is small heed taken of the Visible Figure and Magnitude, which, tho' more immediately perceiv'd, do less sen∣sibly affect us, and are not fitted to produce any Alteration in our Bodies.</P>

<HEAD>LX. An Instance of this.</HEAD>
<P>That the Matter of Fact is true, will be evident to any one, who considers that a Man placed at Ten Foot Distance, is thought as great, as if he were placed at the Distance only of Five Foot; which is true, not with Relation to the Visible, but Tangible great∣ness of the <HI>Object.</HI> The Visible Magnitude being far greater, at one Station, than it is at the o∣ther.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="61" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LXI. Men do not Measure by Visible Feet or Inches.</HEAD>
<P>Inches, Feet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are settled, sta∣ted Lengths, whereby we measure Objects, and estimate their Mag∣nitude, we say, for Example, an <HI>Object</HI> appears to be Six Inches, or Six Foot long. Now, that this cannot be meant of Visible Inch∣ches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is evident, because a Vi∣sible Inch is it self no constant, de∣terminate Magnitude, and cannot, therefore, serve to mark out, and determin the Magnitude of any o∣ther

Take an Inch mark'd upon a Ruler; view it, successive∣ly, at the Distance of Half a Foot, a Foot, a Foot and a Half, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Eye; at each of which, and at all the intermediate Distances, the Inch shall have a different Vi∣sible Extension, <HI>i. e.</HI> there shall be more or fewer Points discerned in it. Now I ask which of all these various Extensions, is that Stated, determinate one, that is agreed on, for a common Measure of other Magnitudes? No reason can be as∣sign'd, why we shou'd pitch on one, more than another. And ex∣cept there be some invariable, de∣terminate Extension fixed on, to be mark'd by the Word <HI>Inch,</HI> 'tis plain, it can be used to little Pur∣pose; and to say, a Thing con∣tains this or that Number of <HI>Inch∣es,</HI> shall imply no more than that it is extended, without bringing any particular <HI>Idea</HI> of that Exten∣sion into the Mind. Farther, an
<PB N="68" REF="91"/>
Inch and a Foot, from different Distances, shall both exhibit the same Visible Magnitude, and yet at the same time, you shall say, that one seems several times great∣er than the other. From all which it is manifest, that the Judgments we make of the Magnitude of Ob∣jects by Sight, are altogether in re∣ference to their Tangible Extensi∣on. Whenever we say an <HI>Object</HI> is Great, or Small, of this or that determinate Measure, I say, it must be meant of the Tangible, and not the Visible Extension, which, tho' immediately perceiv'd, is neverthe∣less little taken Notice of.</P>

Those <HI>Ideas</HI> that now suggest unto us, the va∣rious Magnitudes of External Ob∣jects, before we touch them, might possibly have suggested no such thing: Or they might have signified them, in a direct, contrary manner, so that the very same <HI>Ideas,</HI> on the Perception whereof we judge an <HI>Object</HI> to be small, might as well have serv'd to make us conclude it great.

<P>We are nevertheless exceeding Prone to imagine, those things which are perceived only by the Mediation of others, to be them∣selves the immediate Objects of Sight: Or, at least, to have in their own Nature a Fitness to be suggest∣ed by them, before ever they had been experienced to Coexist with them.

All which seems to
<PB N="73" REF="96"/>
arise, from want of a due Appli∣cation of our Discerning Faculty, thereby to Discriminate between the <HI>Ideas</HI> that are in our Under∣standings, and consider them apart from each other; which wou'd preserve us from confounding those that are different, and make us to see what <HI>Ideas</HI> do, and what do not include, or imply this or that other <HI>Idea.</HI></P>

<P>There is a Celebrated <HI>Phaeno∣menon,</HI> the Solution whereof I shall attempt to give, by the Principles that have been laid down, in re∣ference to the manner wherein we apprehend by Sight, the Magnitude of Objects. It is as follows. The apparent Magnitude of the Moon when placed in the <HI>Horizon,</HI> is much greater than when it is in the <HI>Meridian.</HI> Tho' the Angle un∣der which the Diameter of the Moon is seen, be not observ'd greater in the former Case, than

in the latter. Moreover, the Ho∣rizontal Moon doth not constant∣ly appear of the same Bigness, but at some times seemeth far great∣er than at others.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="68" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LXVIII. The cause of this Phaenome∣non, assign∣ed.</HEAD>
<P>Now in order to explicate the reason, of the Moon's appearing greater than ordinary in the <HI>Ho∣rizon</HI>; it must be observ'd, that the Particles which compose our Atmosphaere, do intercept the Rays of Light, proceeding from any <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> to the Eye; and by how much the greater is the Portion of Atmosphaere, interjacent between the <HI>Object</HI> and the Eye, by so much the more are the Rays intercept∣ed; and by consequence, the Ap∣pearance of the <HI>Object</HI> render'd more Faint: Every <HI>Object</HI> appearing more Vigorous or more Faint, in Proportion as it sendeth more or fewer Rays unto the Eye. Now, be∣tween the Eye, and the Moon, when situated in the <HI>Horizon,</HI> there lies
<PB N="75" REF="98"/>
a far greater Quantity of Atmo∣sphaere, than there does when the Moon is in the <HI>Meridian.</HI> Whence it comes pass, that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon is fain∣ter, and therefore by <HI>Sect.</HI> LVI, it shou'd be thought bigger in that Situation, than in the <HI>Meridian,</HI> or in any other Elevation above the <HI>Horizon.</HI></P>

<P>Farther, The Air being variously impregnated, sometimes more and sometimes less, with Vapours and Exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the Rays of Light; it follows, that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon hath not always an equal Faintness; and by Conse∣quence, that Luminary, tho' in the very same Situation, is at one time judged greater than at another.</P>

<P>That we have here given the true Account of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Horizontal Moon, will, I sup∣pose,
<PB N="76" REF="99"/>
be farther Evident to any one from the following Conside∣rations. <HI>First,</HI> 'Tis plain, that which in this Case suggests the <HI>Idea</HI> of greater Magnitude, must be some∣thing which is it self perceiv'd; for, that which is unperceiv'd can∣not suggest to our Perception a∣ny other thing. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It must be something that does not con∣stantly remain the same, but is subject to some Change or Va∣riation, since the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon varies, be∣ing at one time greater than at another. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It must not lie in the External Circumjacent or Intermediate Objects but be an Affection of the very Visible Moon it self: Since by looking thro' a Tube, when all other Objects are excluded from Sight, the Appear∣ance is as great as ever. And yet, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> It cannot be the Vi∣sible Figure or Magnitude, since that remains the same, or is ra∣ther
<PB N="77" REF="100"/>
lesser, by how much the Moon is nearer to the <HI>Horizon.</HI> It re∣mains therefore, that the true Cause is that Affection or Alteration of the Visible Appearance, which pro∣ceeds from the greater Paucity of Rays arriving at the Eye, and which I term <HI>Faintness:</HI> Since this answers all the foremention'd Conditions, and I am not conscious of any other Perception that does.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="71" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LXXI. And con∣firmed, by the Moon's appearing greater in a Mist.</HEAD>
<P>Add to this, that in misty Wea∣ther it is a common Observation, that the Appearance of the Hori∣zontal Moon is far larger than u∣sual, which greatly conspires with, and strengthens our Opinion. Nei∣ther wou'd it prove, in the least, Ir∣reconcilable with what we have said: If the Horizontal Moon shou'd chance sometime to seem enlarged beyond its usual Extent, even in more Serene Weather. For we must not only have regard to the Mist, which happens to be in
<PB N="78" REF="101"/>
the place where we stand; we ought also to take into our Thoughts, the whole Sum of Vapours and Ex∣halations, which lie betwixt the Eye and the Moon: All which cooperating to render the Appear∣ance of the Moon more Faint, and thereby increase it's Magni∣tude, it may chance to appear greater than it usually does, even in the Horizontal Position, at a time when, tho' there be no ex∣traordinary Fog or Haziness, just in the place where we stand, yet, the Air between the Eye and the Moon, taken all together, may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed Vapours and Exhalati∣ons, than at other times.</P>

<HEAD>LXXII. Objection answer'd.</HEAD>
<P>It may be Objected, That in Consequence of our Principles, the Interposition of a Body in some degree Opaque, which may Inter∣cept a great Part of the Rays of Light, shou'd render the Appear∣ance
<PB N="79" REF="102"/>
of the Moon in the <HI>Meridi∣an</HI> as large, as when it is viewed in the <HI>Horizon.</HI> To which I an∣swer, 'tis not Faintness any how apply'd, that suggests greater Mag∣nitude. There being no necessary, but only an experimental Connexi∣on between those two things: It follows, that the Faintness, which enlarges the Appearance, must be applied in such Sort, and with such Circumstances, as have been ob∣served to attend the Vision of great Magnitudes. When from a Distance (I speak with the Vulgar) we be∣hold great Objects, the Particles of the intermediate Air and Va∣pours, which are themselves unper∣ceivable, do interrupt the Rays of Light, and thereby render the Ap∣pearance less Strong and Vivid; now, Faintness of Appearance cau∣sed in this Sort, hath been ex∣perienced to coexist with great Magnitude. But, when it is cau∣sed by the Interposition of an Opa∣que,
<PB N="80" REF="103"/>
sensible Body, this Circum∣stance alters the Case; so that a Faint Appearance this way caused, does not suggest greater Magni∣tude, because it hath not been ex∣perienced to coexist with it.</P>

<HEAD>LXXIII. The way wherein Faintness suggests greater Magnitude Illustrated.</HEAD>
<P>Faintness, as well as all other <HI>Ideas</HI> or Perceptions, which sug∣gest Magnitude or Distance, does it in the same way, that Words sug∣gest the Notions to which they are annexed. Now, it is known, a Word pronounced with certain Circum∣stances, or in a certain Context with other Words, hath not always the same Import and Signification, that it hath when pronounced in some other Circumstances, or dif∣ferent Context of Words.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="74" TYPE="section">
<PB N="81" REF="104"/>
<HEAD>LXXIV. Appear∣ance of the Horizontal Moon, why thought difficult to explain.</HEAD>
<P>If we attentively consider the <HI>Phae∣nomenon</HI> before us, we shall find the not discerning between the Mediate, and Immediate Objects of Sight, to be the chief Cause of the Difficulty that occurs in the Explication of it. The Magnitude of the Visible Moon, or that which is the proper and immediate <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> of Vision, is no greater when the Moon is in the <HI>Horizon,</HI> than when it is in the <HI>Meridian.</HI> How comes it, therefore, to seem great∣er in one Situation than the o∣ther? What is it can put this Cheat on the Understanding? It has no other Perception of the Moon, than what it gets by Sight: And that which is seen is of the same Extent, I say, the Visible Appearance hath the very same, or, rather, a lesser Magnitude when the Moon is view'd in the <HI>Ho∣rizontal,</HI> than when in the <HI>Meri∣dional</HI> Position: And yet it is E∣steemed
<PB N="82" REF="105"/>
greater in the former, than in the latter. Herein consists the Difficulty; which doth Vanish, and admit of a most easy Solution, if we consider that, as the Visible Moon is not greater in the <HI>Ho∣rizon,</HI> than in the <HI>Meridian,</HI> so nei∣ther is it thought to be so. It hath been already shewn, that in any act of <HI>Vision,</HI> the Visible <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> absolutely, or in it self, is lit∣tle taken notice of, the Mind still carrying its View from that to some <HI>Tangible Ideas,</HI> which have been observ'd to be Connected with it, and by that means, come to be suggested by it. So that when a thing is said to appear Great, or Small, or whatever Estimate be made of the Magnitude of any Thing; this is meant, not of the Visible, but, of the Tangible <HI>Ob∣ject.</HI> This duly consider'd, it will be no hard matter to reconcile, the seeming Contradiction there is, that the Moon shou'd appear of
<PB N="83" REF="106"/>
a different Bigness, the visible Mag∣nitude thereof remaining still the same. For by <HI>Sect.</HI> LVI. the very same visible Extension, with a dif∣ferent Faintness, shall suggest a dif∣ferent Tangible Extension. When, therefore, the Horizontal Moon is said to appear greater than the Me∣ridional Moon; this must be un∣derstood, not of a greater <HI>Visi∣ble</HI> Extension, but of a greater <HI>Tangible</HI> Extension; which, by reason of the more than ordinary <HI>Faintness</HI> of the Visible Appear∣ance, is suggested to the Mind a∣long with it.</P>

<P>Many Attempts have been made by Learned Men, to account for this Appearance. <HI>Gassendus, Des∣cartes, Hobbs,</HI> and several others, have employ'd their Thoughts on that Subject: But how fruitless and unsatisfactory their Endeavours have been, is sufficiently shewn by Mr. <HI>Molyneux, vid.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="76" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LXXVI. The Opini∣on of Dr. <HI>Wallis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>His Opinion in short is this. We judge not of the Magni∣tude of an <HI>Object</HI> by the Optic Angle alone, but by the Optic Angle in Conjunction with the
<PB N="85" REF="108"/>
Distance, Hence, tho' the An∣gle remain the same, or even becomes less; yet if withal the Distance seem to have been in∣creas'd, the <HI>Object</HI> shall appear greater. Now, one way whereby we estimate the Distance of any thing, is by the Number and Ex∣tent of the intermediate Objects: When therefore the Moon is seen in the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the Variety of Fields, Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with the large Prospect of the wide-extended Land, or Sea, that lies between the Eye and the utmost Limb of the <HI>Horizon,</HI> suggest unto the Mind the <HI>Idea</HI> of greater Di∣stance, and consequently magnify the Appearance. And this, accord∣ing to Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> is the true Ac∣count of the extraordinary Large∣ness attributed by the Mind to the Horizontal Moon, at a time when the Angle subtended by its <HI>Diameter,</HI> is not one jot greater than it us'd to be.</P>

<HEAD>LXXVII. It is shewn to be unsa∣tisfactory.</HEAD>
<P>With reference to this Opinion, not to repeat what has been al∣ready said concerning <HI>Distance,</HI> I shall only observe, <HI>First,</HI> That if the Prospect of interjacent Ob∣jects be that which suggests the <HI>Idea</HI> of farther Distance, and this <HI>Idea</HI> of farther Distance be the Cause, that brings into the Mind the <HI>Idea</HI> of greater Magnitude; it should hence follow, that if one look'd at the Horizontal Moon from behind a Wall, it would appear no bigger than or∣dinary. For in that Case, the Wall interposing, cuts off all that Prospect of Sea and Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which might otherwise increase the apparent Distance, and there∣by the apparent Magnitude of the Moon. Nor will it suffice to say, the Memory doth even then suggest all that Extent of Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lies within the Hori∣zon; which Suggestion occasions
<PB N="87" REF="110"/>
a sudden Judgment of Sense, that the Moon is farther off, and lar∣ger than usual. For ask any Man, who from such a Station behold∣ing the Horizontal Moon, shall think her greater than usual, whe∣ther he have at that time in his Mind any <HI>Idea</HI> of the intermedi∣ate Objects, or long Tract of Land that lies between his Eye and the extream Edge of the Horizon? And whether it be that <HI>Idea</HI> which is the Cause of his making the aforemention'd Judg∣ment? He will, without doubt, reply in the Negative, and de∣clare the Horizontal Moon shall appear greater than the Meridio∣nal, tho' he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it.

<HEAD>LXXVIII. How Lines and Angles may be of use in com∣puting ap∣parent Magni∣tudes.</HEAD>
<P>This <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> of the Hori∣zontal Moon is a clear Instance of the Insufficiency of Lines and Angles, for explaining the way wherein the Mind perceives, and estimates the Magnitude of out∣ward Objects. There is, never∣theless, a use of Computation by them, in order to determin the apparent Magnitude of things, so far as they have a Connexion with, and are Proportional to those other <HI>Ideas,</HI> or Perceptions which are the true and immedi∣ate

Occasions that suggest to the Mind the apparent Magnitude of Things. But this in general may, I think, be observ'd concerning Mathematical Computation in <HI>Op∣tics:</HI> That it can hardly be very Precise and Exact, since the Judgments we make of the Mag∣nitude of External Things, do often depend on several Circum∣stances, which are not Proportio∣nal to, or capable of being defin'd by <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Angles.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LXXIX. One born Blind, be∣ing made to See, what Judgment he'd make of Magni∣tude.</HEAD>
<P>From what has been said we may safely deduce this Conse∣quence, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Man born Blind, and made to See, wou'd, at first opening of his Eyes, make a very different Judgment of the Magnitude of <HI>Objects</HI> in∣tromitted by them, from what others do. He wou'd not con∣sider the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight with re∣ference to, or as having any Connexion with the <HI>Ideas</HI> of

Touch. His View of them be∣ing intirely terminated within them∣selves, he can no otherwise judge them <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>Small,</HI> than as they contain a greater or lesser Num∣ber of Visible Points. Now, it being certain, that any Visible Point can cover or exclude from View, only one other Visible Point, it follows, that whatever <HI>Object</HI> intercepts the View of another, hath an equal Number of Visible Points with it; and consequently they shall both, by him, be thought to have the same Magnitude. Hence, it's e∣vident, one in those Circumstan∣ces would judge his Thumb, with which he might hide a Tower, or hinder its being seen, e∣qual to that Tower, or his Hand, the Interposition whereof might con∣ceal the Firmament from his View, equal to the Firmament. How great an Inequality soever there may, in our Apprehensions, seem

<HI>Visibile</HI> is exactly equal in all Be∣ings whatsoever, that are endow'd with the Visive Faculty. No ex∣quisite Formation of the Eye, no peculiar Sharpness of Sight, can make it less in one Creature, than in another. For it not be∣ing distinguishable into Parts, nor in any wise consisting of them, it must necessarily be the same to all. For suppose it otherwise, and that the <HI>Minimum Visibile</HI> of a Mite, for Instance, be less than the <HI>Minimum Visibile</HI> of a Man; the latter, therefore, may by Detracti∣on of some part be made equal to the former: It doth, therefore, con∣sist of Parts: Which is inconsistent with the Notion of a <HI>Minimum Visi∣bile,</HI> or Point.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="81" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LXXXI. Objection answer'd.</HEAD>
<P>It will, perhaps, be objected, that the <HI>Minimum Visibile</HI> of a Man doth really, and in it self, contain Parts whereby it surpasses that of a Mite, tho' they are not
<PB N="93" REF="116"/>
perceivable by the Man. To which I answer, the <HI>Minimum Vi∣sibile</HI> having (in like manner as all other the Proper and Imme∣diate <HI>Objects</HI> of Sight) been shewn not to have any Existence with∣out the Mind of him who sees it, it follows, there cannot be any part of it that is not actu∣ally perceiv'd, and therefore Visi∣ble. Now, for any <HI>Object</HI> to con∣tain several distinct, visible Parts, and at the same time to be a <HI>Minimum Visibile,</HI> is a manifest Contradiction.</P>

<P>Of these Visible Points we see at all times an equal Number.

For it being impossible, that one <HI>Minimum Visibile</HI> should obscure, or keep out of Sight, more than one other; it's a plain
<PB N="94" REF="117"/>
Consequence, that when my View is on all sides bounded by the Walls of my Study, I see just as many visible Points, as I cou'd, in case that by the Removal of the Study-Walls, and all other Obstructions, I had a full Pros∣pect of the circumjacent Fields, Mountains, Sea, and open Firma∣ment. For, so long as I am shut up within the Walls, by their Interposition every Point of the External <HI>Object</HI> is cover'd from my View. But each Point that is seen, being able to cover or exclude from Sight, one only o∣ther corresponding Point: It fol∣lows, that whilst my Sight is confin'd to those narrow Walls, I see as many Points, or <HI>Minima Visibilia,</HI> as I should, were those Walls away, by looking on all the External <HI>Objects,</HI> whose Pro∣spect is intercepted by them.

than when we look with the naked Eye, at <HI>Objects</HI> placed in a due Distance. A <HI>Microscope</HI> brings us, as it were, into a new World: It presents us with a new Scene of Visible <HI>Objects,</HI> quite dif∣ferent from what we behold with the naked Eye.

<HEAD>LXXXVIII Difficulty concerning Erect Vi∣sion.</HEAD>
<P>Having finish'd what I intend∣ed to say, concerning the <HI>Distance</HI> and <HI>Magnitude</HI> of <HI>Objects,</HI> I come now to treat of the Manner, where∣in the Mind perceives by Sight their <HI>Situation.</HI> Among the Discoveries of the last Age, it is reputed none of the
<PB N="100" REF="123"/>
least, that the manner of <HI>Vision</HI> has been more clearly Explain'd, than ever it had been before. There is, at this Day, no one Ignorant, that the Pictures of External <HI>Ob∣jects</HI> are Painted on the <HI>Retina,</HI> or Fund of the Eye. That we can see no thing which is not so Paint∣ed. And that, according as the Picture is more Distinct or Con∣fused, so also is the Perception we have of the <HI>Object.</HI> But then in this Explication of <HI>Vision,</HI> there occurs one mighty Difficulty. The <HI>Objects</HI> are Painted in an inverted Order on the Bottom of the Eye: The <HI>upper</HI> part of any <HI>Object</HI> be∣ing Painted on the <HI>lower</HI> part of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and the <HI>lower</HI> part of the <HI>Object,</HI> on the <HI>upper</HI> part of the <HI>Eye.</HI> And so also as to <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Left.</HI> Since therefore the Pictures are thus in∣verted, it is demanded how it comes to pass, that we see the <HI>Ob∣jects</HI> erect and in their natural Posture?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="89" TYPE="section">
<PB N="101" REF="124"/>
<HEAD>LXXXIX The com∣mon way of explaining it.</HEAD>
<P>In answer to this Difficulty, we are told, that the Mind perceiving an impulse of a Ray of Light, on the upper part of the Eye, con∣siders this Ray as coming in a direct Line, from the lower part of the <HI>Object</HI>; and in like man∣ner tracing the Ray that strikes on the lower part of the Eye, it is directed to the upper part of the <HI>Object.</HI> Thus in the adjacent Fi∣gure, <HI>C</HI> the lower Point of the <HI>Object ABC</HI> is projected on <HI>c</HI> the upper part of the Eye. So like∣wise, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the highest Point A is pro∣jected on <HI>a</HI> the lowest part of the Eye; which makes the Repre∣sentation <HI>cba</HI> inverted. But the Mind considering the Stroak that is made on <HI>c</HI> as coming in the
<PB N="102" REF="125"/>
straight Line <HI>C c</HI> from the lower End of the <HI>Object</HI>; and the Stroak or Impulse on <HI>a,</HI> as coming in the Line <HI>Aa</HI> from the upper End of the <HI>Object,</HI> is directed to make a right Judgement of the Situa∣tion of the <HI>Object ABC,</HI> notwith∣standing the Picture of it be in∣verted. Moreover, this is illustra∣ted by conceiving a Blind Man, who holding in his Hands two Sticks that cross each other, doth with them touch the extremities of an <HI>Object,</HI> placed in a perpen∣dicular Situation. It is certain, this Man will judge that to be the upper part of the <HI>Object,</HI> which he touches with the Stick held in the undermost Hand, and that to be the lower part of the <HI>Ob∣ject,</HI> which he touches with the Stick in his uppermost Hand. This is the common Explication of the erect Appearance of <HI>Objects,</HI> which is generally receiv'd and acquiesed in, being (as Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI> tells us,
<PB N="103" REF="126"/>
<HI>Dioptr. par.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 7. <HI>p.</HI> 289.) <HI>allow∣ed by all Men as Satisfactory.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="90" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XC. The same shewn to be false.</HEAD>
<P>But how reasonable and satis∣factory soever, this account may be thought by others, to me cer∣tainly it does not seem, in any degree, True. Did I perceive those Impulses, Decussations, and Directi∣ons of the Rays of Light, in like manner as hath been set forth, then, indeed, it wou'd not at first view be altogether void of Pro∣bability. And there might be some Pretence for the Comparison of the Blind-Man and his cross Sticks. But the Case is far otherwise. I know very well that I perceive no such thing. And of Consequence, I cannot thereby make an Esti∣mate of the Situation of <HI>Objects.</HI> Moreover I appeal to any one's Experience, whether he be consci∣ous to himself, that he thinks on the Intersection made by the Ra∣dious Pencils, or pursue the Im∣pulses
<PB N="104" REF="127"/>

Add to this, that the explaining the manner of <HI>Vi∣sion</HI> by the Example of cross Sticks, and Hunting for the <HI>Object</HI> along the Axes of the Radious Pencils, doth suppose the proper <HI>Objects</HI> of Sight to be perceived at a Di∣stance from us, contrary to what hath been Demonstrated. We may therefore, venture to pronounce this Opinion concerning the way where∣in
<PB N="105" REF="128"/>
the Mind perceives the Erect Appearance of <HI>Objects,</HI> to be of a Piece with those other Tenents of Writers in <HI>Optics,</HI> which in the foregoing Parts of this Treatise, we have had occasion to Examine and Refute.</P>

<P>But in order to Disentangle our Minds, from whatever Prejudices we may entertain with relation to the Subject in hand: Nothing seems more apposite, than the ta∣king into our Thoughts the Case of one Born Blind, and afterwards, when grown up, made to see. And tho', perhaps, it may not be a Task altogether easy, and famili∣ar to us, to divest our selves in∣tirely of the Experiences receiv'd from Sight. So as to be able to put our Thoughts exactly in the Posture of such a one's. We must, nevertheless, as far as possible, en∣deavour to frame true Concepti∣ons, of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in his Mind.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="94" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XCIV. Which Modes of Situation he'd attri∣bute only to things Tangible.</HEAD>
<P>But then, whatever Judgments he makes concerning the Situati∣on of <HI>Objects,</HI> are confin'd to those only that are perceivable by <HI>Touch.</HI> All those things that are intangi∣ble, and of a spiritual Nature, his Thoughts and Desires, his Passi∣ons, and in general all the Mo∣difications of his Soul, to these he wou'd never apply the Terms <HI>Upper</HI> and <HI>Lower,</HI> except only in a Metaphorical Sense. He may, perhaps, by way of Allusion, speak of High or Low Thoughts. But those Terms in their proper Sig∣nification,
<PB N="108" REF="131"/>
wou'd never be apply∣ed to any thing, that was not conceiv'd to exist without the Mind. For a Man Born Blind, and re∣maining in the same State, cou'd mean nothing else by the Words <HI>Higher</HI> and <HI>Lower,</HI> than a great∣er or lesser Distance from the Earth: Which Distance he wou'd measure by the Motion or Appli∣cation of his Hand, or some o∣ther Part of his Body. It is, there∣fore, evident, that all those things which, in respect of each other, wou'd by him be thought Higher or Lower, must be such as were conceiv'd to exist without his Mind, in the ambient Space.</P>

he wou'd not think the Things he perceived by Sight to be at any Distance from him, or without his Mind.

But the proper Objects of <HI>Vision</HI> make a new Set of <HI>Ideas,</HI> perfectly distinct and dif∣ferent from the former, and which can in no sort make themselves perceiv'd by <HI>Touch.</HI> There is, there∣fore, nothing at all that cou'd in∣duce him to think those Terms applicable to them. Nor wou'd he ever think it, till such time as he had observ'd their Connexion with Tangible Objects, and the same Prejudice begin to insinuate it self into his Understanding, which from their Infancy had grown up in the Understandings of other Men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="96" TYPE="section">
<PB N="110" REF="133"/>
<HEAD>XCVI. This Illus∣trated by an Exam∣ple.</HEAD>
<P>To set this Matter in a clearer Light, I shall make use of an Ex∣ample. Suppose the above-men∣tioned Blind Person do, by his Touch, perceive a Man to stand Erect. Let us enquire into the manner of this. By the applica∣tion of his Hand to the several Parts of a Human Body, he had perceiv'd different Tangible <HI>Ideas,</HI> which being collected into sundry complex ones have distinct Names annexed to them. Thus one Com∣bination of a certain Tangible Fi∣gure, Bulk, and Consistency of Parts is called the <HI>Head,</HI> another the <HI>Hand,</HI> a Third the <HI>Foot,</HI> and so of the rest. All which Com∣plex <HI>Ideas</HI> cou'd, in his Understand∣ing, be made up only of <HI>Ideas</HI> perceivable by Touch. He had al∣so by his Touch obtain'd an <HI>Idea</HI> of Earth or Ground, towards which he perceives the Parts of his Bo∣dy to have a natural Tendency.
<PB N="111" REF="134"/>
Now, by <HI>Erect</HI> nothing more be∣ing meant, than that perpendicu∣lar Position of a Man, wherein his Feet are nearest to the Earth: If the Blind Person by moving his Hand, over the Parts of the Man who stands before him, do perceive the Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> that compose the Head, to be farthest from, and those that compose the Feet to be nearest to, that other Combination of Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> which he calls <HI>Earth:</HI> He will de∣nominate that Man <HI>Erect.</HI> But if we suppose him on a sudden to re∣ceive his Sight, and that he behold a Man standing before him: It's evident, in that Case, he wou'd neither judge the Man he sees, to be <HI>Erect</HI> nor <HI>Inverted</HI>; for he never having known those Terms applied to any other, save Tangible Things, or which existed in the Space without him, and what he sees neither being Tangible, nor per∣ceived as existing without, he cou'd
<PB N="112" REF="135"/>
not know that in propriety of Lan∣guage, they were applicable to it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="97" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>XCVII. By what means he'd come to de∣nominate Visible <HI>Ob∣jects</HI> high or low, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Afterwards, when upon turning his Head or Eyes, up and down, to the right and left, he shall ob∣serve the Visible Objects to change, and shall also attain to know, that they are call'd by the same Names, and Connected with the Ob∣jects perceiv'd by Touch; then, indeed, he will come to speak of them, and their Situation, in the the same Terms that he has been us'd to apply to Tangible Things.

<HEAD>XCVIII. Why he shou'd think those <HI>Objects</HI> highest, which are Painted on the lowest part of his Eye, and <HI>vice ver∣sa.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And this seems to me the true Reason, why he shou'd think those Objects uppermost that are Pain∣ted on the lower part of his Eye. For, by turning the Eye <HI>up</HI> they shall be distinctly seen; as likewise,
<PB N="113" REF="136"/>
they that are Painted on the high∣est part of the Eye shall be di∣stinctly seen, by turning the Eye <HI>down,</HI> and are for that Reason e∣steemed lowest. For we have shewn that to the immediate Objects of Sight, consider'd in themselves, he'd not attribute the Terms <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low.</HI> It must therefore be on ac∣count of some Circumstances, which are observ'd to attend them. And these, 'tis plain, are the Actions of turning the Eye up and down, which suggest a very obvious Rea∣son, why the Mind shou'd deno∣minate the Objects of Sight ac∣cordingly <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low.</HI> And with∣out this Motion of the Eye, this turning it up and down in or∣der to discern different Objects, doubtless <HI>Erect, Inverse,</HI> and other the like Terms relating to the Position of Tangible Objects, wou'd never have been transfer'd, or in any degree apprehended to belong to the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight: The meer

<P>Farther, when he has by Experi∣ence learn'd the Connexion there is, between the several <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight and Touch, he will be able, by the Perception he has of the Si∣tuation of Visible Things in re∣spect of one another, to make a sudden and true Estimate, of the Situation of Outward, Tangible things corresponding to them.

But, we are also as prone to think, that at first Sight, we shou'd in the same way apprehend the Distance and Magnitude of Objects, as we do now.

<HEAD>CI. Objection.</HEAD>
<P>It will, perhaps, be objected to our Opinion, that a Man, for in∣stance, being thought Erect, when his Feet are next the Earth, and inverted, when his Head is next the Earth, it doth hence follow, that by the meer act of Vision, without any Experience or alter∣ing the Situation of the Eye, we shou'd have determined whether he were Erect or Inverted. For
<PB N="116" REF="139"/>
both the Earth it self, and the Limbs of the Man who stands thereon, being equally perceiv'd by Sight: One cannot chuse seeing, what part of the Man is nearest the Earth, and what part farthest from it, <HI>i. e.</HI> whether he be Erect or Inverted.</P>

<HEAD>CII. Answer.</HEAD>
<P>To which I answer, the <HI>Ideas</HI> which constitute the Tangible Earth and Man, are intirely different from those which constitute the Visible Earth and Man. Nor was it pos∣sible, by virtue of the Visive Fa∣culty alone, without super-adding any Experience of <HI>Touch,</HI> or al∣tering the Position of the Eye, e∣ver to have known, or so much as suspected, there had been any Relation or Connexion between them. Hence, a Man at first view wou'd not denominate any thing he saw <HI>Earth,</HI> or <HI>Head,</HI> or <HI>Foot.</HI> And consequently, he cou'd not tell by the meer act of <HI>Vision,</HI> whe∣ther
<PB N="117" REF="140"/>
the Head or Feet were near∣est the Earth. Nor, indeed, wou'd he have thereby any thought of <HI>Earth</HI> or <HI>Man, Erect</HI> or <HI>Inverse,</HI> at all. Which will be made yet more evident, if we nicely observe, and make a particular Comparison be∣tween the <HI>Ideas</HI> of both Senses.</P>

<P>That which I see is only varie∣ty of Light and Colours. That which I feel, is Hard or Soft, Hot or Cold, Rough or Smooth. What Similitude, what Connexion have those <HI>Ideas</HI> with these? Or how is it possible, that any one shou'd see reason, to give one and the same Name, to combina∣tions of <HI>Ideas</HI> so very different, before ever he had experienced their Coexistence? We do not find there is any necessary Connexion, betwixt this or that Tangible Quality, and any Colour whatsoever. And we may sometimes perceive Colours, where there is nothing to be felt.

For <HI>Figure</HI> is the Termination of Magnitude. Whence it follows, that no Vi∣sible Magnitude having, in it's own Nature, an aptness to suggest any one particular Tangible Magnitude, so neither can any Visible Figure, be inseparably Connected with its corresponding Tangible Figure: So as of it self, and in a way <HI>prior</HI> to Experience it might suggest it to the Understanding.

<HEAD>CVII. Difficulty proposed concerning Number.</HEAD>
<P>There doth, nevertheless, remain one Difficulty, which to some per∣haps, may seem to press hard on our Opinion, and deserve not to be pass'd over. For tho' it be granted, that neither the Colour,
<PB N="121" REF="144"/>
Size, nor Figure of the Visible Feet, have any necessary Connexion with the <HI>Ideas</HI> that compose the Tangi∣ble Feet, so as to bring them at first sight, into my Mind, or make me in danger of confounding them, before I had been us'd to, and for some time experienced their Con∣nexion. Yet thus much seems un∣deniable. Namely, that the Num∣ber of the Visible Feet, being the same with that of the Tangible Feet: I may from hence, without any Ex∣perience of Sight, reasonably con∣clude that they represent, or are connected with the Feet rather than the Head. I say, it seems the <HI>I∣dea</HI> of <HI>Two</HI> Visible Feet will soon∣er suggest to the Mind, the <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Two</HI> Tangible Feet than of <HI>one</HI> Head.

<HEAD>CVIII. Number of things Vi∣sible, wou'd not, at first Sight, sug∣gest the like number of things Tan∣gible.</HEAD>
<P>In order to get clear of this seeming Difficulty, we need only observe, that Diversity of Visible Objects does not necessarily infer, Diversity of Tangible Objects, cor∣responding to them. A Picture Painted with great variety of Co∣lours, affects the Touch in one uniform manner. It is therefore evident, that I do not by any necessary Consecution, independent of Experience, judge of the num∣ber of things Tangible, from the number of things Visible. I shou'd not therefore at first open∣ing my Eyes conclude, that be∣cause I see Two, I shall feel Two. How therefore can I, before Ex∣perience teaches me, know that the Visible Legs, because <HI>Two,</HI> are connected with the Tangible Legs: Or the Visible Head, because <HI>One,</HI> connected with the Tangible Head? The Truth on't is, the things I see are so very different, and he∣terogeneous

<HEAD>CIX. Number the Crea∣ture of the Mind.</HEAD>
<P>But for a fuller Illustration of this Matter, it ought to be con∣sider'd, that <HI>Number</HI> (however some may reckon it amongst the Prima∣ry Qualities) is nothing fix'd, and settled, really existing in things them∣selves. It is intirely the Creature of the Mind, considering, either a Simple <HI>Idea</HI> by it self, or any Com∣bination of Simple <HI>Ideas</HI> to which it gives one Name, and so makes it pass for an Unite. According as the Mind variously Combines it's <HI>Ideas,</HI> the Unite varies. And as the Unite, so the Number, which is only a Collection of Unites, doth also vary. We call a Window <HI>one,</HI> a Chimney <HI>one</HI>; and yet a House
<PB N="124" REF="147"/>
in which there are many Win∣dows, and many Chimneys, has an equal right to be called <HI>one.</HI> And many Houses go to the ma∣king of <HI>one</HI> City. In these and the like Instances, it's evident the <HI>Unite</HI> constantly relates to the particu∣lar Draughts the Mind makes of it's <HI>Ideas,</HI> to which it affixes Names, and wherein it includes more or less, as best suits it's own Ends and Purposes. Whatever therefore the Mind considers as one, that is an Unite. Every Combination of <HI>Ideas</HI> is consider'd as one thing by the Mind, and in token there∣of, is mark'd by one Name. Now, this Naming and Combining to∣gether of <HI>Ideas</HI> is perfectly Arbi∣trary, and done by the Mind in such sort, as Experience shews it to be most convenient. Without which, our <HI>Ideas</HI> had never been collected into such sundry, distinct Combinations, as they now are.</P>

<P>Hence it follows, that a Man Born Blind, and afterwards, when grown up, made to see, wou'd not in the first act of Vision, par∣cel out the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, into the same distinct Collections that others do, who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up toge∣ther under one Name. He wou'd not, for Example, make into one Complex <HI>Idea,</HI> and thereby esteem an unite all those particular <HI>Ideas</HI> which constitute the Visible Head, or Foot. For there can be no Reason assign'd why he shou'd do so, barely upon his seeing a Man stand upright before him. There croud into his Mind, the <HI>Ideas</HI> which compose the Visible Man, in company with all the other <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight perceiv'd at the same time. But all these <HI>Ideas</HI> offer'd at once to his View, he'd not distribute into sundry, distinct

<HEAD>CXI. The Situa∣tion of any Object, de∣termin'd with re∣spect only to Objects of the same Sense.</HEAD>
<P>From what hath been premised, 'tis plain the Objects of Sight and Touch make, if I may so say, two Sets of <HI>Ideas,</HI> which are widely different from each other. To Ob∣jects of either Kind, we indiffe∣rently attribute the Terms <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low, Right</HI> and <HI>Left,</HI> and such like, denoting the Position or Si∣tuation of things. But then we must well observe, that the Po∣sition of any <HI>Object</HI> is determin'd, with respect only to <HI>Objects</HI> of the same Sense. We say any <HI>Object</HI> of Touch is <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low,</HI> accor∣ding as it is more or less di∣stant from the Tangible Earth. And in like manner, we denomi∣nate any <HI>Object</HI> of Sight <HI>High</HI> or
<PB N="127" REF="150"/>
<HI>Low,</HI> in proportion as it is more or less Distant, from the Visible Earth. But to define the Situa∣tion of Visible Things, with rela∣tion to the Distance they bear from any Tangible Thing, or <HI>vi∣ce versa:</HI> This were absurd and perfectly unintelligible. For all Vi∣sible Things are equally in the Mind, and take up no part of the Exter∣nal Space: And, consequently, are Equidistant from any Tangi∣ble Thing which exists without the Mind.</P>

<P>Or rather, to speak truly, the pro∣per <HI>Objects</HI> of Sight are at no Di∣stance, neither near nor far, from any Tangible Thing. For if we inquire narrowly into the Matter, we shall find, that those things only are compar'd together in re∣spect of Distance, which exist af∣ter the same manner, or apper∣tain unto the same Sense. For by the <HI>Distance</HI> between any Two
<PB N="128" REF="151"/>
Points, nothing more is meant than the Number of intermediate Points. If the given Points are Visible, the Distance between them is mark'd out, by the Number of the interjacent Visible Points: If they are Tangible, the Distance between them is a Line consisting of Tangible Points. But if they are one Tangible, and the other Visible, the Distance between them doth neither consist of Points per∣ceivable by Sight, nor by Touch, <HI>i. e.</HI> it is utterly inconceivable. This, perhaps, will not find an easy Admission into all Men's Un∣derstandings: However, I shou'd gladly be informed whether it be not True, by any one who will be at the pains to Reflect a lit∣tle, and apply it home to his Thoughts.</P>

part of the Difficulty that occurs in the Business of <HI>Erect Appear∣ances.</HI> The Head, which is Paint∣ed nearest the Earth, seems to be farthest from it; and on the o∣ther Hand, the Feet, which are Painted farthest from the Earth, are thought nearest to it. Here∣in lies the Difficulty, which va∣nishes if we express the thing more clearly, and free from Ambigui∣ty, thus. How comes it that to the Eye, the Visible Head which is nearest the Tangible Earth, seems farthest from the Earth, and the Visible Feet, which are farthest from the Tangible Earth, seem nearest the Earth? The Question being thus propos'd, who sees not, the Difficulty is founded on a Sup∣position, that the Eye or Visive Fa∣culty, or rather the Soul by means thereof, shou'd judge of the Situ∣ation of Visible Objects, with Re∣ference to their Distance from the Tangible Earth? Whereas it's e∣vident,
<PB N="130" REF="153"/>
the Tangible Earth is not perceiv'd by Sight: And it hath been shewn in the two last pre∣ceding <HI>Sections,</HI> that the Location of Visible Objects is determin'd only, by the Distance they bear from one another; and that it is Nonsense to talk of Distance, far or near, between a Visible and Tangible Thing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="114" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXIV. Which o∣therwise includes nothing un∣accounta∣ble.</HEAD>
<P>If we confine our Thoughts to the proper Objects of Sight, the whole is plain and easy. The Head is Painted farthest from, and the Feet nearest to the Visible Earth: And so they appear to be. What is there strange or unaccountable in this? Let us suppose the Pic∣tures in the Fund of the Eye, to be the immediate Objects of Sight. The Consequence is, that things shou'd appear in the same Posture they are Painted in. And is it not so? The Head which is seen, seems farthest from the Earth which
<PB N="131" REF="154"/>

<P>But, say you, the Picture of the Man is <HI>inverted,</HI> and yet the Ap∣pearance is <HI>Erect.</HI> I ask what mean you by the Picture of the Man, or, which is the same thing, the Visible Man's being inverted? You tell me 'tis inverted, because the Heels are uppermost, and the Head undermost? Explain me this. You say, that by the Head's being un∣dermost, you mean that it is near∣est to the Earth; and by the Heels being uppermost, that they are farthest from the Earth. I ask a∣gain, what Earth you mean? You cannot mean the Earth that is Painted on the Eye, or the Vi∣sible Earth. For the Picture of the Head is farthest from the Pic∣ture of the Earth; and the Pic∣ture of the Feet nearest to the Pic∣ture
<PB N="132" REF="155"/>
of the Earth; and accordingly, the Visible Head is farthest from the Visible Earth, and the Visible Feet, nearest to it. It remains, there∣fore, that you mean the Tangible Earth: And so determine the Si∣tuation of <HI>Visible</HI> Things, with re∣spect to <HI>Tangible</HI> Things; contra∣ry to what hath been demonstra∣ted in <HI>Sect.</HI> CXI. and CXII.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="116" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXVI. Cause of Mistake in this Mat∣ter.</HEAD>
<P>Farther, What greatly contributes to make us mistake in this Mat∣ter is, that when we think of the Pictures in the Fund of the Eye, we imagine our selves looking on the Fund of another's Eye, or a∣nother looking on the Fund of our own Eye, and beholding the Pictures Painted thereon. Suppose
<PB N="133" REF="156"/>
two Eyes <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B: A</HI> from some distance looking on the Pictures in <HI>B</HI> sees them inverted, and for that reason concludes they are in∣verted in <HI>B.</HI> But this is wrong. There are projected in <HI>little</HI> on the Bot∣tom of <HI>A,</HI> the Images of the Pictures of, suppose, <HI>Man, Earth,</HI> &amp;c. which are Painted on <HI>B.</HI> And besides these, the Eye <HI>B</HI> it self, and the <HI>Objects</HI> which environ it, together with another Earth are projected in a larger Size on <HI>A.</HI> Now, by the Eye <HI>A,</HI> these lar∣ger Images are deemed the <HI>true Objects,</HI> and the lesser only <HI>Pict∣ures</HI> in miniature. And it is with respect to those greater Images, that it determines the Situation of the smaller Images. So that com∣paring the little Man with the great Earth, <HI>A</HI> judges him inver∣ted, or that the Feet are farthest from, and the Head nearest to the great Earth. Whereas, if <HI>A</HI> compare the little Man with the
<PB N="134" REF="157"/>
little Earth, then he will appear Erect, <HI>i. e.</HI> his Head shall seem far∣thest from, and his Feet nearest to the little Earth. But we must consider that <HI>B</HI> does not see two Earths, as <HI>A</HI> does: It sees only what is represented by the little Pictures in <HI>A,</HI> and consequently shall judge the Man <HI>Erect.</HI> For, in truth, the Man in <HI>B</HI> is not inverted, for there the Feet are next the Earth. But it is the Re∣presentation of it in <HI>A</HI> which is inverted, for there, the Head of the Representation of the Picture of the Man in <HI>B,</HI> is next the Earth, and the Feet farthest from the Earth, meaning the Earth which is without the Representation of the Pictures in <HI>B.</HI> For if you take the little Images of the Pictures in <HI>B,</HI> and consider them by them∣selves, and with respect only to one another, they are all <HI>Erect</HI> and in their natural Posture.</P>

<DIV2 N="117" TYPE="section">

<HEAD>CXVII. Images in the Eye, not Pictures of external Objects.</HEAD>
<P>Farther, there lies a Mistake, in our imagining that the Pictures of External <HI>Objects</HI> are Painted on the Bottom of the Eye. It hath been shewn, there is no resemblance be∣tween the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, and things Tangible. It hath likewise been de∣monstrated, that the proper <HI>Objects</HI> of Sight do not exist without the Mind. Whence it clearly follows, that the Pictures Painted on the Bottom of the Eye, are not the Pictures of External <HI>Objects.</HI> Let any one consult his own Thoughts, and then tell me, what Affinity, what Likeness there is, between that certain Variety and Disposi∣tion of Colours, which constitute the Visible Man, or Picture of a Man, and that other Combinati∣on of far different <HI>Ideas,</HI> sensible by Touch, which compose the Tan∣gible Man. But if this be the Case, how come they to be ac∣counted <HI>Pictures</HI> or <HI>Images,</HI> since
<PB N="136" REF="159"/>
that supposes them to copy or represent some Originals or o∣ther?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="118" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXVIII. In what Sense they are Pictures</HEAD>
<P>To which I answer. In the foremention'd Instance, the Eye <HI>A</HI> takes the little Images, inclu∣ded within the Representation of the other Eye <HI>B,</HI> to be Pictures or Copies, whereof the <HI>Archetypes</HI> are not things existing with∣out but, the larger Pictures pro∣jected on it's own Fund: And which by <HI>A</HI> are not thought Pic∣tures, but the Originals or true Things themselves. Tho' if we suppose a third Eye <HI>C,</HI> from a due distance to behold the Fund of <HI>A:</HI> Then, indeed, the things project∣ed thereon shall, to <HI>C,</HI> seem Pic∣tures or Images, in the same Sense that those projected on <HI>B</HI> do to <HI>A.</HI></P>

From what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this Treatise, 'tis plain there's no one self-same numeri∣cal Extension, perceiv'd both by Sight and Touch. But that the particular Figures and Extensions perceiv'd by Sight, however they may be called by the same Names, and reputed the same Things, with those perceiv'd by Touch, are ne∣vertheless different, and have an Existence very distinct and Sepa∣rate from them. So that the Que∣stion is not now concerning the same numerical <HI>Ideas,</HI> but whether there be any one and the same sort or <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Ideas</HI> equally

And sure∣ly if any one were able to let that <HI>Idea</HI> into my Mind, it must be the deservedly admir'd Author of the Essay <HI>concerning Human Un∣derstanding:</HI> He, who has so far distinguish'd himself from the ge∣nerality of Writers, by the Clear∣ness and Significancy of what he Says. Let us therefore see how that great Man describes the ge∣neral, or, which is the same thing, the Abstract <HI>Idea</HI> of a Triangle. <Q REND="inline">It must be, (<HI>says he</HI>) neither Ob∣lique, nor Rectangle, neither E∣quilateral, Equicrural, nor Sca∣lenon; but <HI>all and none</HI> of these at once. In effect it is some∣what imperfect that cannot exist;

Sure I am, if this be the Case, 'tis impossible for me to attain to know even the first Elements of <HI>Geometry:</HI> Since I have not the Faculty to frame in my Mind such an <HI>Idea</HI> as is here describ'd. That Author acknowledges it doth <Q REND="inline">re∣quire some Pains and Skill to Form this general <HI>Idea</HI> of a Tri∣angle,</Q> <BIBL><HI>ibid.</HI></BIBL> But had he call'd to mind what he says in another place, <HI>viz.</HI> that <Q REND="inline"><HI>Ideas</HI> of mix'd Modes wherein any inconsistent <HI>Ideas</HI> are put together, cannot so much as exist in the Mind,</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> be con∣ceiv'd,

<BIBL><HI>vid. b.</HI> iii. <HI>c.</HI> 10. <HI>s.</HI> 33. <HI>ibid.</HI></BIBL> I say, had this occur'd to his Thoughts, 'tis not improbable he'd have own'd it above all the Pains and Skill he was Master of, to form the above-mention'd <HI>Idea</HI> of a Triangle, which is made up of ma∣nifest, staring Contradictions. That a Man of such a clear Understanding, who thought so much, and so well, and laid so great a Stress on Clear and Determinate <HI>Ideas,</HI> shou'd never∣theless talk at this rate, seems very surprising. But my Wonder is les∣sen'd when I consider, that the Source whence this Opinion of Abstract Figures and Extension flows, is the prolific Womb which has brought forth innumerable Errors and Difficulties, in all Parts of Philosophy, and in all the Scien∣ces. But this Matter, taken in its full Extent, were a Subject too vast and comprehensive to be in∣sisted on in this place. I shall on∣ly observe that your Metaphysici∣ans,
<PB N="146" REF="169"/>
and Men of Speculation, seem to have Faculties distinct from those of ordinary Men; when they talk of General or Abstracted Triangles and Circles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so perempto∣rily declare them to be the Subject, of all the Eternal, Immutable, Uni∣versal Truths, in <HI>Geometry.</HI> And so much for Extension in <HI>Abstract.</HI></P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="128" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXXVIII. First Ar∣gument in Proof here∣of.</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> When upon Perception of an <HI>Idea,</HI> I range it under this or that sort; it is because it's per∣ceiv'd after the same manner, or because it has a Likeness or Con∣formity with, or affects me in the same way as the <HI>Ideas</HI> of the sort I rank it under. In short, it must not be intirely new, but have something in it Old, and already perceiv'd by me: It must, I say, have so much, at least, in com∣mon with the <HI>Ideas</HI> I have before known and nam'd, as to make me give it the same Name with them.
<PB N="149" REF="172"/>
But it has been, if I mistake not, clearly made out, that a Man Born Blind wou'd not, at first reception of his Sight, think the things he saw were of the same Nature with the <HI>Objects</HI> of Touch, or had any thing in common with them; but that they were a new Set of <HI>Ideas,</HI> perceiv'd in a new manner, and intirely different from all he had ever perceiv'd before. So that he wou'd not call them by the same Name, nor repute them to be of the same Sort, with any thing he had hitherto known. And surely, the Judgment of such an unprejudic'd Person is more to be relied on in this Case, than the Sentiments of the generality of Men: Who in this, as in almost every thing else, suffer themselves to be guided by Custom, and the erroneous Suggestions of Prejudice, rather than Reason and sedate Re∣flexion.</P>

For my own part, I must con∣fess, I am not able to attain so great a nicety of Abstraction. I know very well that, in a strict

He who beside these, doth also perceive by Sight <HI>Ideas</HI> far different and distinct from them, hath that Faculty in a de∣gree more perfect and compre∣hensive than I can pretend to. I own indeed, that by the media∣tion of Light and Colours, other far different <HI>Ideas</HI> are suggested to my Mind. But then, upon this Score, I see no reason why the Sight shou'd be thought more Com∣prehensive than the Hearing: Which beside Sounds, which are pecu∣liar to that Sense, doth by their Mediation suggest, not only Space, Figure, and Motion, but also, all other <HI>Ideas</HI> whatsoever that can be signified by Words.</P>

<P>Now, if a Square Surface per∣ceiv'd by Touch be of the same Sort, with a Square Surface percei∣ved by Sight: It is certain the Blind Man here mention'd might know a Square Surface, as soon as he saw it. It is no more but introducing into his Mind, by a new Inlet, an <HI>Idea</HI> he has been already well acquainted with. Since therefore he is suppos'd to have known by his Touch, that a Cube is a Body terminated by Square Surfaces; and that a Sphere is not terminated by Square Surfa∣ces: Upon the Supposition that a Visible and Tangible Square dif∣fer only <HI>in Numero,</HI> it follows, that he might know, by the unerring Mark of the Square Surfaces, which was the Cube, and which not, whilst he only saw them. We must therefore allow, either that Visible Extension and Figures are Specifically distinct, from Tangi∣ble

<HEAD>CXXXV. Farther Reflexion, on the fore∣going Pro∣blem.</HEAD>
<P>I cannot let go the above-men∣tion'd Problem, without some Re∣flexion on it. It hath been made evident, that a Man Blind from his Birth wou'd not, at first Sight, denominate any thing he saw by the Names, he had been us'd to appropriate to <HI>Ideas</HI> of Touch.
<PB N="158" REF="181"/>
<HI>vid. Sect.</HI> CVI. <HI>Cube, Sphere, Table,</HI> are Words he has known applied to Things perceivable by Touch, but to Things perfectly Intangi∣ble he never knew them apply'd. Those Words, in their wonted ap∣plication, always mark'd out to his Mind Bodies, or Solid Things which were perceiv'd by the Re∣sistance they gave. But there is no Solidity, no Resistance or Pro∣trusion perceiv'd by Sight. In short, the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight are all new Perceptions, to which there be no Names annex'd in his Mind; he cannot, therefore, understand what is said to him concerning them. And to ask, of the two Bodies he saw placed on the Table, which was the Sphere, which the Cube? Were, to him, a Question down right Bantering and Unintelligible: Nothing he sees being able to sug∣gest to his Thoughts, the <HI>Idea</HI> of Body, Distance, or, in general, of any thing he had already known.</P>

<P>'Tis a Mistake, to think the same thing affects both Sight and Touch.

For tho' the manner wherein it affects the Sight, be different from that wherein it affected his Touch; yet, there be∣ing, beside this Manner or Circum∣stance, which is new and unknown, the Angle or Figure which is old and known, he cannot chuse but discern it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="137" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXXXVII Tho same Idea of Mo∣tion not common to Sight and Touch.</HEAD>
<P>Visible Figure and Extension ha∣ving been demonstrated, to be of a Nature intirely Different and He∣terogeneous, from Tangible Fi∣gure and Extension, it remains that we inquire concerning <HI>Motion.</HI> Now, that Visible Motion is not of the same Sort with Tangible Motion, seems to need no farther Proof,
<PB N="150" REF="183"/>
it being an evident Corollary from what we have shewn, concerning the Difference there is betwixt Vi∣sible and Tangible Extension. But for a more full and express Proof hereof, we need only observe, that one who had not yet experien∣ced Vision, wou'd not, at first Sight, know Motion. Whence it clear∣ly follows, that Motion perceiva∣ble by Sight is of a Sort distinct from Motion perceivable by Touch. The Antecedent I prove thus. By Touch he cou'd not perceive a∣ny Motion, but what was up or down, to the right or left, near∣er or farther from him; besides these, and their several Varieties or Complications, it's impossible he shou'd have any <HI>Idea</HI> of Motion. He wou'd not therefore think a∣ny thing to be Motion, or give the name <HI>Motion</HI> to any <HI>Idea,</HI> which he cou'd not range under some or other, of those particular Kinds thereof. But from <HI>Sect.</HI> XCV. it's
<PB N="161" REF="184"/>
plain that by the meer act of Visi∣on, he cou'd not know Motion upwards or downwards, to the right or left, or in any other pos∣sible Direction. From which I con∣clude, he'd not know Motion at all at first Sight. As for the <HI>I∣dea</HI> of Motion in <HI>Abstract,</HI> I shall not waste Paper about it, but leave it to my Reader, to make the best he can on't. To me 'tis perfect∣ly Unintelligible.</P>

<HEAD>CXL. This ac∣counted for without supposing them of the same Kind.</HEAD>
<P>To which I Answer, we can no more Argue <HI>e. g.</HI> a Visible and Tangible Square to be of the same <HI>Species,</HI> from their being call'd by the same Name; than we can, that a Tangible Square and the Monosyllable consisting of Six Let∣ters, whereby it is mark'd, are of the same Species, because they are both call'd by the same Name. It is customary to call written Words, and the Things they signify, by the same Name: For Words not be∣ing regarded in their own Nature, or otherwise than as they are marks of Things, it had been superflu∣ous, and beside the design of Lan∣guage, to have given them Names distinct from those of the Things marked by them. The same Rea∣son
<PB N="164" REF="189"/>
holds here also. Visible Fi∣gures are the marks of Tangible Figures, and from <HI>Sect.</HI> LIX, it is plain, that in themselves they are lit∣tle regarded, or upon any other Score than for their Connexion with Tan∣gible Figures, which by Nature they are ordain'd to signifie. And because this Language of Nature does not vary, in different Ages or Nations, hence it is that, in all Times and Places, Visible Figures are call'd by the same Names, as the re∣spective Tangible Figures suggest∣ed by them: And not because they are alike, or of the same sort with them.</P>

<DIV2 N="141" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXLI. <HI>Obj.</HI> That a Tangible Square is liker to a Visible Square than to a Visible Cir∣cle.</HEAD>
<P>But say you, surely a Tangible Square is liker to a Visible Square than to a Visible Circle: It has four Angles, and as many Sides; so also has the Visible Square, but the Visible Circle has no such thing, being bounded by one uniform Curve, without right Lines or An∣gles;
<PB N="165" REF="190"/>
which makes it unfit to represent the Tangible Square, but very fit to represent the Tan∣gible Circle. Whence it clearly follows, that Visible Figures are Patterns of, or of the same <HI>Spe∣cies</HI> with, the respective Tangible Figures represented by them; that they are like unto them, and of their own Nature fitted to re∣present them as being of the same sort; and that they are in no respect arbitrary Signs, as Words.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="142" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXLII. <HI>Ans.</HI> That a Visible Square is fitter than a Visible Circle, to represent a Tangible Square.</HEAD>
<P>I Answer it must be acknow∣ledg'd, the Visible Square is fit∣ter than the Visible Circle to re∣present the Tangible Square, but then it is not because it's liker, or more of a Species with it. But, because the Visible Square contains in it several distinct Parts, whereby to mark the several distinct, corresponding Parts of a Tangible Square, whereas the Visible Circle
<PB N="166" REF="191"/>
doth not. The Square perceiv'd by Touch hath four distinct, equal Sides, so also hath it four distinct, equal Angles. It is therefore ne∣cessary, that the Visible Figure which shall be most proper to mark it, contain four distinct, equal Parts corresponding to the four Sides of the Tangible Square; as like∣wise four other distinct and equal Parts, whereby to denote the four equal Angles of the Tangible Square. And accordingly we see the Vi∣sible Figures contain in them di∣stinct Visible Parts answering to the distinct Tangible Parts of the Figures signify'd, or suggested by them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="143" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXLIII. But it doth not hence follow, that a Visible Square is like a Tan∣gible Square.</HEAD>
<P>But it will not hence follow, that any Visible Figure is like un∣to, or of the same <HI>Species</HI> with, its corresponding Tangible Figure, unless it be also shewn, that not only the Number, but also the Kind of the Parts be the same in both.
<PB N="167" REF="192"/>
To Illustrate this, I observe that Visible Figures represent Tangible Figures, much after the same man∣ner that written Words do Sounds. Now, in this respect, Words are not Arbitrary, it not being indif∣ferent, what written Word stands for any Sound. But it is requi∣site, that each Word contain in it as many distinct Characters, as there are Variations in the Sound it stands for. Thus, the single Letter <HI>a</HI> is proper to mark one simple uniform Sound; and the Word <HI>Adultery</HI> is accommodated to represent the Sound annext to it, in the Formation whereof, there being Eight different Collisions, or Modifications of the Air by the Organs of Speech, each of which produces a difference of Sound, it was fit, the Word representing it shou'd consist of as many di∣stinct Characters, thereby to mark each particular Difference or Part of the whole Sound. And yet
<PB N="168" REF="193"/>
no Body, I presume, will say, the single Letter <HI>a</HI> or the Word <HI>A∣dultery</HI> are like unto, or of the same Species with, the respective Sounds by them Represented. It is indeed Arbitrary that, in ge∣neral, Letters of any Language represent Sounds at all; but when that is once agreed, it is not Ar∣bitrary what Combination of Let∣ters shall represent this or that par∣ticular Sound. I leave this with the Reader to pursue, and ap∣ply it in his own Thoughts.</P>

<HEAD>CXLIV. Why we are more apt to confound Visible with Tan∣gible <HI>I∣deas,</HI> than other Signs with the Things sig∣nify'd.</HEAD>
<P>It must be confest, that we are not so apt to confound other Signs with the Things signified, or to think them of the same Species, as we are Visible and Tangible <HI>Ideas.</HI> But a little Consideration will shew us how this may well be, without our supposing them of a like Nature. These Signs are constant and universal, this Con∣nexion with Tangible <HI>Ideas</HI> has been
<PB N="169" REF="194"/>
learnt, at our first Entrance into the World, and ever since, almost eve∣ry Moment of our Lives, it has been occurring to our Thoughts, and fastening and striking deeper on our Minds. When we observe that Signs are variable and of Hu∣man Institution, when we re∣member, there was a time they were not connected in our Minds, with those things they now so readily suggest; but, that their Signification was learned by the slow Steps of Experience. This preserves us from confounding them. But, when we find the same Signs suggest the same Things all over the World; when we know they are not of Human Institution, and cannot remember that we ever learn'd their Signifi∣cation; but think that at first Sight they would have suggested to us, the same Things they do now: All this perswades us they are of the same <HI>Species</HI> as the
<PB N="170" REF="195"/>
Things respectively represented by them, and that is by a natural Re∣semblance they suggest them to our Minds.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="145" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CXLV. Several o∣ther Rea∣sons hereof, assign'd.</HEAD>
<P>Add to this, that whenever we make a nice Survey of any <HI>Ob∣ject,</HI> successively directing the <HI>Op∣tic Axis</HI> to each Point thereof; there are certain Lines and Fi∣gures describ'd by the Motion of the Head or Eye; which, being in Truth perceiv'd by Feeling, do, nevertheless, so mix themselves, as it were, with the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight, that we can scarce think but they appertain to that Sense. Again, the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight enter into the Mind, several at once more distinct and unmingled, than is usual in the other Senses be∣side the Touch. Sounds, for Ex∣ample, perceiv'd at the same Instant, are apt to coalesce, if I may so say, into one Sound. But we can perceive at the same
<PB N="171" REF="196"/>
time great variety of Visible Ob∣jects, very separate and distinct from each other. Now Tangible Extension being made up, of se∣veral distinct coexistent parts, we may hence gather another Reason, that may dispose us to imagine a Likeness, or Analogy, between the immediate Objects of Sight and Touch. But nothing, certainly, does more contribute to blend and confound them together, than the strict and close Connexion they have with each other. We cannot open our Eyes, but the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Distance, Bodies, and Tan∣gible Figures are suggested by them.

<P>Suppose one who had always continu'd Blind, be told by his Guide, that after he has advan∣ced so many Steps, he shall come to the Brink of a Precipice, or be stopt by a Wall; must not this to him seem very admirable and surprizing? He can't con∣ceive how 'tis possible for Mor∣tals,

The wonderful Art and Contrivance wherewith it is ad∣justed, to those Ends and Purpo∣ses for which it was apparently design'd, the vast Extent, Num∣ber, and Variety of Objects that are, at once, with so much Ease, and Quickness, and Pleasure, sug∣gested by it: All these afford Subject for much and pleasing Speculation; and may, if any thing, give us some Glimmer∣ing, Analogous, Praenotion of Things, that are placed beyond the certain Discovery, and Com∣prehension of our present State.</P>

<HEAD>CXLIX. Question propos'd, concerning the Object of Geome∣try.</HEAD>
<P>I do not design to trouble my self much with drawing Corollaries, from the Doctrine I have hither∣to laid down. If it bears the Test, others may, so far as they shall think convenient, employ their Thoughts in extending it farther, and applying it to whate∣ver Purposes it may be subser∣vient to. Only, I cannot forbear making some Inquiry concerning the <HI>Object</HI> of Geometry, which the Subject we have been upon does naturally lead one to. We have shewn there's no such <HI>Idea,</HI> as that of Extension in Abstract, and that there are two kinds of sensible Extension and Figures, which are intirely Distinct and Heteroge∣neous from each other. Now, it is natural to enquire which of these is the <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Geometry.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CL. At first View, we are apt to think Visi∣ble Exten∣sion the Ob∣ject of Geo∣metry.</HEAD>
<P>Some things there are which, at first sight, incline one to think
<PB N="176" REF="201"/>
Geometry conversant about Visi∣ble Extension. The constant use of the Eyes, both in the Practi∣cal and Speculative Parts of that Science, doth very much induce us thereto. It would, without doubt, seem odd to a Mathema∣tician, to go about to convince him, the Diagrams he saw upon Paper were not the Figures, or even the Likeness of the Figures, which make the Subject of the Demonstration. The contrary be∣ing held an unquestionable Truth, not only by Mathematicians, but also by those who apply them∣selves more particularly to the Study of <HI>Logick</HI>; I mean, who consider the Nature of Science, Certainty, and Demonstration: It being by them assign'd as one Reason, of the extraordinary Clear∣ness and Evidence of Geometry, that in that Science the Reason∣ings are free from those Incon∣veniences, which attend the use of
<PB N="177" REF="202"/>
Arbitrary Signs. The very <HI>Ideas</HI> themselves being Copied out, and exposed to View upon Paper. But, by the bye, how well this agrees with what they likewise assert, of Abstract <HI>Ideas</HI> being the Object of Geometrical Demon∣stration, I leave to be consi∣der'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="151" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CLI. Visible Ex∣tension shewn not to be the Ob∣ject of Geo∣metry.</HEAD>
<P>To come to a Resolution in this Point, we need only ob∣serve what has been said in <HI>Sect.</HI> LIX, LX, LXI; where it is shewn, that Visible Extensions in themselves are little regarded, and have no settled determinate Great∣ness; and that Men measure al∣together, by the Application of Tangible Extension to Tangible Extension. All which makes it evident, that Visible Extension and Figures are not the Object of Geo∣metry.</P>

<DIV2 N="152" TYPE="section">
<PB N="178" REF="203"/>
<HEAD>CLII. Words may as well be thought the Object of Geometry, as Visible Extension.</HEAD>
<P>It is, therefore, plain that Vi∣sible Figures are of the same Use in Geometry, that Words are. And the one may as well be ac∣counted the <HI>Object</HI> of that Science, as the other; neither of them being any otherwise concern'd therein, than as they represent or suggest to the Mind the particu∣lar Tangible Figures connected with them. There is, indeed, this Difference betwixt the Significa∣tion of Tangible Figures by Vi∣sible Figures, and of <HI>Ideas</HI> by Words. That whereas the Latter is variable and uncertain, depend∣ing altogether on the Arbitrary Appointment of Men; the For∣mer is fix'd, and immutably the same, in all Times and Places. A Visible Square, for Instance, suggests to the Mind the same Tangible Figure in <HI>Europe,</HI> that it doth in <HI>America.</HI> Hence it is, that the Voice of Nature, which
<PB N="179" REF="204"/>
speaks to our Eyes, is not liable to that Misinterpretation and Am∣biguity, that Languages of Hu∣man Contrivance are unavoidably subjected to. From which may, in some measure, be derived that peculiar Evidence and Clearness of Geometrical Demonstrations.</P>

<P>Tho' what has been said may suffice to shew what ought to be determin'd, with relation to the <HI>Object</HI> of Geometry; I shall ne∣vertheless, for the fuller Illustra∣tion thereof, take into my Thoughts the Case of an Intelligence, or Unbody'd Spirit, which is sup∣pos'd to see perfectly well, <HI>i. e.</HI> to have a clear Perception of the proper and immediate Objects of Sight, but to have no Sense of <HI>Touch.</HI> Whether there be any such Being in Nature or no, is beside my Purpose to enquire. It suffices, that the Supposition con∣tains no Contradiction in it. Let
<PB N="180" REF="205"/>
us now examine, what Proficiency such a one may be able to make in <HI>Geometry.</HI> Which Speculation will lead us more clearly to see, whether the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Sight can possibly be the <HI>Object</HI> of that Sci∣ence.</P>

<DIV2 N="154" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CLIV. He cannot understand those parts which re∣late to So∣lids, and their Sur∣faces and Lines ge∣nerated by their Secti∣on.</HEAD>
<P>First, then 'tis certain, the a∣foresaid Intelligence could have no <HI>Idea</HI> of a Solid, or Quantity of three Dimensions; which follows from its not having any <HI>Idea</HI> of Distance. We indeed are prone to think, that we have by Sight the <HI>Ideas</HI> of Space and Solids, which arises from our imagining that we do, strictly speaking, see Distance, and some parts of an <HI>Object</HI> at a greater Distance than others, which has been demon∣strated to be the Effect of the Experience we have had, what <HI>I∣deas</HI> of Touch are connected with such and such <HI>Ideas</HI> attending Vi∣sion. But the Intelligence here
<PB N="181" REF="206"/>
spoken of is suppos'd to have no Experience of Touch. He wou'd not, therefore, judge as we do, nor have any <HI>Idea</HI> of Distance, Outness, or Profundity, nor con∣sequently of Space or Body, ei∣ther immediately or by Suggestion. Whence it is plain, he can have no Notion of those parts of Geo∣metry, which relate to the Men∣suration of Solids, and their Con∣vex or Concave Surfaces, and contemplate the Properties of Lines generated by the Section of a Solid. The conceiving of any part where∣of, is beyond the Reach of his Fa∣culties.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="155" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CLV. Nor even the Ele∣ments of plain Geo∣metry.</HEAD>
<P>Farther, he cannot comprehend the manner wherein Geometers de∣scribe a right Line or Circle: The Rule and Compass with their Use, being things of which it's impos∣sible he should have any Notion. Nor is it an easier matter for him, to conceive the placing of
<PB N="182" REF="207"/>
one Plain or Angle on another, in order to prove their Equality. Since that supposes some <HI>Idea</HI> of Distance, or External Space. All which makes it evident, our pure Intelligence could never attain to know, so much as the first Elements of plain Geometry. And, perhaps, upon a nice Enquiry, it will be found, he cannot even have an <HI>Idea</HI> of Plain Figures, any more than he can of Solids. Since some <HI>Idea</HI> of Distance is necessary, to form the <HI>Idea</HI> of a Geometrical Plain, as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it.</P>

<HEAD>CLVI. The proper Objects of Sight inca∣pable of be∣ing mana∣ged as Geo∣metrical Figures.</HEAD>
<P>All that is properly perceiv'd by the Visive Faculty, amounts to no more than Colours with their Va∣riations, and different Proportions of Light and Shade. But, the per∣petual Mutability, and Fleetingness of those immediate Objects of Sight, render them incapable of being managed after the manner

of Geometrical Figures; nor is it in any Degree useful that they should. It's true, there be divers of 'em perceiv'd at once; and more of some, and less of others. But accurately to compute their Magnitude, and assign precise de∣terminate Proportions, between Things so Variable and Inconstant, if we suppose it possible to be done, must yet be a very trifling and in∣significant Labour.</P>

<HEAD>CLVII. The Opini∣on of those who hold plain Fi∣gures to be the imme∣diate Ob∣jects of Sight, con∣sider'd.</HEAD>
<P>I must confess, it seems to be the Opinion of some very Ingenious Men, that flat or plain Figures are immediate Objects of Sight, tho' they acknowledge Solids are not. And this Opinion of their's is grounded on what is observ'd in Painting, wherein (say they) the <HI>I∣deas</HI> immediately imprinted in the Mind, are only of Plains variously colour'd, which by a sudden Act of the Judgment are changed into Solids. But, with a little Attention
<PB N="184" REF="209"/>
we shall find the Plains here men∣tion'd, as the immediate Objects of Sight, are not Visible, but Tangi∣ble Plains. For when we say that Pictures are Plains, we mean there∣by, that they appear to the <HI>Touch</HI> Smooth and Uniform. But then this Smoothness and Uniformity, or, in other Words, this Plainness of the Picture, is not perceiv'd im∣mediately by Vision: For it appear∣eth to the Eye Various and Multi∣form.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="158" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CLVIII. Plains, no more the immediate Objects of Sight, than Solids.</HEAD>
<P>From all which we may con∣clude, that Plains are no more the immediate <HI>Object</HI> of Sight than So∣lids. What we strictly see are not Solids, nor yet Plains variously co∣lour'd; they are only Diversity of Colours. And some of these sug∣gest to the Mind Solids, and others Plain Figures; just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one, or the other. So that we see Plains, in the same way that we
<PB N="185" REF="210"/>
see Solids: Both being equally suggested by the immediate Ob∣jects of Sight, which according∣ly are themselves Denominated <HI>Plains</HI> and <HI>Solids.</HI> But tho' they are called by the same Names, with the Things mark'd by them, they are nevertheless of a Nature intirely different, as hath been De∣monstrated.</P>

This, indeed, in a compleat De∣gree,
<PB N="186" REF="211"/>
seems scarce possible to be perform'd. Which will not seem strange to us, if we consider how hard it is, for any one to hear the Words of his Native Lan∣guage, which is familiar to him, pronounced in his Ears without understanding them. Tho' he en∣deavour to disunite the meaning from the Sound, it will neverthe∣less intrude into his Thoughts, and he shall find it extream Difficult, if not impossible, to put him∣self exactly in the Posture of a Foreigner, that never learnt the Language, so as to be affected barely with the Sounds themselves, and not perceive the Significati∣on annexed to them.</P>
