<P>ON the pleasant banks of the Garonne,
in the province of Gascony, stood, in the
year 1584, the chateau of Monsieur St.
Aubert. From its windows were seen
the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and
Gascony, stretching along the river, gay
with luxuriant woods and vines, and
plantations of olives. To the south, the
view was bounded by the majestic Pyre∣nées,
whose summits, veiled in clouds, or
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
exhibiting awful forms, seen, and lost
again, as the partial vapours rolled along,
were sometimes barren, and gleamed
through the blue tinge of air, and some∣times
frowned with forests of gloomy
pine, that swept downward to their
base. These tremendous precipices were
contrasted by the soft green of the pas∣tures
and woods that hung upon their
skirts; among whose flocks, and herds,
and simple cottages, the eye, after having
scaled the cliffs above, delighted to re∣pose.
To the north, and to the east, the
plains of Guienne and Languedoc were
lost in the mist of distance; on the west,
Gascony was bounded by the waters of
Biscay.</P>
<P>M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with
his wife and daughter, on the margin of
the Garonne, and to listen to the music
that floated on its waves. He had known
life in other forms than those of pasto∣ral
simplicity, having mingled in the gay
and in the busy scenes of the world; but
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
the flattering portrait of mankind, which
his heart had delineated in early youth,
his experience had too sorrowfully cor∣rected.
Yet, amidst the changing visions
of life, his principles remained unshaken,
his benevolence unchilled; and he retir∣ed
from the multitude "more in <HI>pity</HI>
than in anger," to scenes of simple na∣ture,
to the pure delights of literature,
and to the exercise of domestic virtues.</P>
<P>He was a descendant from the younger
branch of an illustrious family, and
it was designed, that the deficiency of
his patrimonial wealth should be supplied
either by a splendid alliance in marriage,
or by success in the intrigues of public
affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a
sense of honour to fulfil the latter hope,
and too small a portion of ambition to
sacrifice what he called happiness, to the
attainment of wealth. After the death
of his father he married a very amiable
woman, his equal in birth, and not his
superior in fortune. The late Monsieur
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance,
had so much involved his affairs, that his
son found it necessary to dispose of a part
of the family domain, and, some years
after his marriage, he sold it to Monsieur
Quesnel, the brother of his wife, and re∣tired
to a small estate in Gascony, where
conjugal felicity, and parental duties, di∣vided
his attention with the treasures of
knowledge and the illuminations of ge∣nius.</P>
<P>To this spot he had been attached from
his infancy. He had often made excur∣sions
to it when a boy, and the impres∣sions
of delight given to his mind by the
homely kindness of the grey-headed pea∣sant,
to whom it was intrusted, and
whose fruit and cream never failed, had
not been obliterated by succeeding cir∣cumstances.
The green pastures along
which he had so often bounded in the
exultation of health, and youthful free∣dom—the
woods, under whose refreshing
shade he had first indulged that pensive
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
melancholy, which afterwards made a
strong feature of his character—the wild
walks of the mountains, the river, on
whose wavés he had floated, and the dis∣tant
plains, which seemed boundless as
his early hopes—were never after re∣membered
by St. Aubert but with enthu∣siasm
and regret. At length he disen∣gaged
himself from the world, and re∣tired
hither, to realize the wishes of
many years.</P>
<P>The building, as it then stood, was
merely a summer cottage, rendered inte∣resting
to a stranger by its neat simpli∣city,
or the beauty of the surrounding
scene; and considerable additions were
necessary to make it a comfortable fami∣ly
residence. St. Aubert felt a kind of
affection for every part of the fabric,
which he remembered in his youth, and
would not suffer a stone of it to be re∣moved,
so that the new building, adapt∣ed
to the style of the old one, formed
with it only a simple and elegant resi∣dence.
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
The taste of Madame St. Aubert
was conspicuous in its internal finish∣ing,
where the same chaste simplicity
was observable in the furniture, and in
the few ornaments of the apartments,
that characterised the manners of its in∣habitants.</P>
<P>The library occupied the west side of
the chateau, and was enriched by a col∣lection
of the best books in the ancient and
modern languages. This room opened
upon a grove, which stood on the brow
of a gentle declivity, that fell towards the
river, and the tall trees gave it a melan∣choly
and pleasing shade; while from
the windows the eye caught, beneath the
spreading branches, the gay and luxu∣riant
landscape stretching to the west,
and overlooked on the left by the bold
precipices of the Pyrenées. Adjoining
the library was a green-house, stored with
scarce and beautiful plants; for one of
the amusements of St. Aubert was the
study of botany, and among the neigh∣bouring
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
mountains, which afforded a lux∣urious
feast to the mind of the naturalist,
he often passed the day in the pursuits
of his favourite science. He was some∣times
accompanied in these little excur∣sions
by Madame St. Aubert, and fre∣quently
by his daughter; when, with a
small osier basket to receive plants, and
another filled with cold refreshments,
such as the cabin of the shepherd did
not afford, they wandered away among
the most romantic and magnificent scenes,
nor suffered the charms of Nature's low∣ly
children to abstract them from the ob∣servance
of her stupendous works. When
weary of sauntering among cliffs that
seemed scarcely accessible but to the
steps of the enthusiast, and where no
track appeared on the vegetation, but
what the foot of the izard had left; they
would seek one of those green recesses,
which so beautisully adorn the bosom of
these mountains, where, under the shade
of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
their simple repast, made sweeter by the
waters of the cool stream, that crept
along the turf, and by the breath of wild
flowers and aromatic plants, that fringed
the rocks, and inlaid the grass.</P>
<P>Adjoining the eastern side of the green∣house,
looking towards the plains of Lan∣guedoc,
was a room, which Emily called
hers, and which contained her books, her
drawings, her musical instruments, with
some favourite birds and plants. Here she
usually exercised herself in elegant arts,
cultivated only because they were conge∣nial
to her taste, and in which native ge∣nius,
assisted by the instructions of Mon∣sieur
and Madame St. Aubert, made her
an early prosicient. The windows of
this room were particularly pleasant;
they descended to the floor, and, opening
upon the little lawn that surrounded the
house, the eye was led between groves of
almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and
myrtle, to the distant landscape, where
the Garonne wandered.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
The peasants of this gay climate were
often seen on an evening, when the day's
labour was done, dancing in groups on
the margin of the river. Their sprightly
melodies, <HI>debonnaire</HI> steps, the fanciful
figure of their dances, with the tasteful
and capricious manner in which the girls
adjusted their simple dress, gave a charac∣ter
to the scene entirely French.</P>
<P>The front of the chateau, which, having
a southern aspect, opened upon the gran∣deur
of the mountains, was occupied on
the ground floor by a rustic hall, and two
excellent sitting rooms. The first floor, for
the cottage had no second story, was laid
out in bed-chambers, except one apartment
that opened to a balcony, and which was
generally used for a breakfast-room.</P>
<P>In the surrounding ground, St. Au∣bert
had made very tasteful improve∣ments;
yet, such was his attachment to
objects he had remembered from his boy∣ish
days, that he had in some instances
sacrificed taste to sentiment. There were
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
two old larches that shaded the building,
and interrupted the prospect; St. Aubert
had sometimes declared that he believed
he should have been weak enough to have
wept at their fall. In addition to these
larches he planted a little grove of beech,
pine, and mountain-ash. On a lofty terrace,
formed by the swelling bank of the river,
rose a plantation of orange, lemon and
palm-trees, whose fruit, in the coolness
of evening, breathed delicious fragrance.
With these were mingled a few trees of
other species. Here, under the ample
shade of a plane-tree, that spread its ma∣jestic
canopy towards the river, St. Au∣bert
loved to sit in the fine evenings of
summer, with his wife and children,
watching, beneath its foliage, the setting∣sun,
the mild splendour of its light, fad∣ing
from the distant landscape, till the
shadows of twilight melted its various
features into one tint of sober gray. Here,
too, he loved to read, and to converse
with Madame St. Aubert; or to play
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
with his children, resigning himself to
the influence of those sweet affections,
which are ever attendant on simplicity
and nature. He has often said, while
tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes, that
these were moments infinitely more delight∣ful
than any passed amid the brilliant and
tumultuous scenes that are courted by the
world. His heart was occupied; it had,
what can be so rarely said, no wish for a
happiness beyond what it experienced.
The consciousness of acting right diffused
a serenity over his manners, which no∣thing
else could impart to a man of mo∣ral
perceptions like his, and which refin∣ed
his sense of every surrounding blessing.</P>
<P>The deepest shade of twilight did not
send him from his favourite plane-tree.
He loved the soothing hour, when the
last tints of light die away; when the
stars, one by one, tremble through aether,
and are reflected on the dark mirror of
the waters; that hour, which, of all
others, inspires the mind with pensive ten∣derness,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
and often elevates it to sublime
contemplation. When the moon shed
her soft rays among the foliage, he still
lingered, and his pastoral supper of cream
and fruits was often spread beneath it.
Then, on the stillness of night, came the
song of the nightingale, breathing sweet∣ness,
and awakening melancholy.</P>
<P>The first interruptions to the happiness
he had known since his retirement, were
occasioned by the death of his two sons.
He lost them at that age when infantine
simplicity is so fascinating; and though,
in consideration of Madame St. Aubert's
distress, he restrained the expression of
his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as
he meant, with philosophy, he had, in
truth, no philosophy that could render
him calm to such losses. One daughter was
now his only surviving child; and, while he
watched the unfolding of her infant cha∣racter,
with anxious fondness, he endeavour∣ed,
with unremitting effort, to counteract
those traits in her disposition, which might
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
hereafter lead her from happiness. She had
discovered in her early years uncommon de∣licacy
of mind, warm affections, and ready
benevolence; but with these was observ∣able
a degree of susceptibility too exqui∣site
to admit of lasting peace. As she
advanced in youth, this sensibility gave a
pensive tone to her spirits, and a softness
to her manner, which added grace to
beauty, and rendered her a very interest∣ing
object to persons of a congenial dis∣position.
But St. Aubert had too much
good sense to prefer a charm to a virtue;
and had penetration enough to see, that
this charm was too dangerous to its pos∣sessor
to be allowed the character of a
blessing. He endeavoured, therefore, to
strengthen her mind; to enure her to ha∣bits
of self-command; to teach her to
reject the first impulse of her feelings, and
to look, with cool examination, upon the
disappointments he sometimes threw in
her way. While he instructed her to re∣sist
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
first impressions, and to acquire that
steady dignity of mind, that can alone
counterbalance the passions, and bear us,
as far as is compatible with our nature,
above the reach of circumstances, he
taught himself a lesson of fortitude; for
he was often obliged to witness, with
seeming indifference, the tears and strug∣gles
which his caution occasioned her.</P>
<P>In person, Emily resembled her mo∣ther;
having the same elegant symmetry
of form, the same delicacy of features,
and the same blue eyes, full of tender
sweetness. But, lovely as was her person,
it was the varied expression of her coun∣tenance,
as conversation awakened the
nicer emotions of her mind, that threw
such a captivating grace around her:</P>
<Q><L>Those tend'rer tints, that shun the careless eye,</L>
<L>And, in the world's contagious circle, die.</L></Q>
<P>St. Aubert cultivated her understand∣ing
with the most scrupulous care. He
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
gave her a general view of the sciences,
and an exact acquaintance with every
part of elegant literature. He taught
her Latin and English, chiefly that she
might understand the sublimity of their
best poets. She discovered in her early
years a taste for works of genius; and it
was St. Aubert's principle, as well as his
inclination, to promote every innocent
means of happiness. "A well-inform∣ed
mind," he would say, "is the best se∣curity
against the contagion of folly and
of vice. The vacant mind is ever on the
watch for relief, and ready to plunge in∣to
error, to escape from the languor of
idleness. Store it with ideas, teach it the
pleasure of thinking; and the tempta∣tions
of the world without, will be coun∣teracted
by the gratifications derived
from the world within. Thought, and
cultivation, are necessary equally to the
happiness of a country and a city life;
in the first they prevent the uneasy sensa∣tions
of indolence, and afford a sublime
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
pleasure in the taste they create for the
beautiful, and the grand; in the latter,
they make dissipation less an object of
necessity, and consequently of interest.</P>
<P>It was one of Emily's earliest pleasures
to ramble among the scenes of nature;
nor was it in the soft and glowing land∣scape
that she most delighted; she loved
more the wild wood-walks, that skirted
the mountain; and still more the moun∣tain's
stupendous recesses, where the si∣lence
and grandeur of solitude impressed
a sacred awe upon her heart, and lifted
her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN
AND EARTH. In scenes like these she
would often linger alone, wrapt in a me∣lancholy
charm, till the last gleam of day
faded from the west; till the lonely sound
of a sheep-bell, or the distant bark of a
watch-dog, were all that broke on the
stillness of the evening. Then, the gloom
of the woods; the trembling of their
leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat,
flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights,
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
now seen, and now lost—were circum∣stances
that awakened her mind into ef∣fort,
and led to enthusiasm and poetry.</P>
<P>Her favourite walk was to a little fish∣ing-house,
belonging to St. Aubert, in a
woody glen, on the margin of a rivulet
that descended from the Pyrenées, and,
after foaming among their rocks, wound
its silent way beneath the shades it re∣flected.
Above the woods, that screened
this glen, rose the lofty summits of the
Pyrenées, which often burst boldly on
the eye through the glades below. Some∣times
the shattered face of a rock only was
seen, crowned with wild shrubs; or a
shepherd's cabin seated on a cliff, over∣shadowed
by dark cypress, or waving ash.
Emerging from the deep recesses of the
woods, the glade opened to the distant
landscape, where the rich pastures and
vine covered slopes of Gascony gradually
declined to the plains; and there, on the
winding shores of the Garonne, groves,
and hamlets, and villas,—their outlines
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
softened by distance, melted from the
eye into one rich harmonious tint.</P>
<P>This, too, was the favourite retreat of
St. Aubert, to which he frequently with∣drew
from the fervour of noon, with his
wife, his daughter, and his books; or
came at the sweet evening hour to wel∣come
the silent dusk, or to listen for
the music of the nightingale. Sometimes,
too, he brought music of his own, and
awakened every fairy echo with the ten∣der
accents of his oboe; and often have
the tones of Emily's voice drawn sweet∣ness
from the waves, over which they
trembled.</P>
<P>It was in one of her excursions to this
spot, that she observed the following lines
written with a pencil on a part of the
wainscot:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Go, pencil! faithful to thy master's sighs!</L>
<L>Go—tell the Goddess of this fairy scene,</L>
<L>When next her light steps wind these wood-walks
green,</L>
<L>Whence all his tears, his tender sorrows, rise:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Ah! paint her form, her soul-illumin'd eyes,</L>
<L>The sweet expression of her pensive face,</L>
<L>The light'ning smile, the animated grace—</L>
<L>The portrait well the lover's voice supplies;</L>
<L>Speaks all his heart must feel, his tongue would
say:</L>
<L>Yet ah! not all his heart must sadly feel!</L>
<L>How oft the flow'ret's silken leaves conceal</L>
<L>The drag that steals the vital spark away!</L>
<L>And who that gazes on that angel-smile,</L>
<L>Would fear its charm, or think it could be∣guile!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>These lines were not inscribed to any
person; Emily therefore could not apply
them to herself, though she was undoubt∣edly
the nymph of these shades. Having
glanced round the little circle of her ac∣quaintance
without being detained by a
suspicion as to whom they could be ad∣dressed,
she was compelled to rest in un∣certainty;
an uncertainty which would
have been more painful to an idle mind
than it was to hers. She had no leisure
to suffer this circumstance, trifling at first,
to swell into importance by frequent re∣membrance
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
The little vanity it had ex∣cited
(for the incertitude which forbade
her to presume upon having inspired the
sonnet, forbade her also to disbelieve it)
passed away, and the incident was dismissed
from her thoughts amid her books, her stu∣dies,
and the exercise of social charities.</P>
<P>Soon after this period, her anxiety was
awakened by the indisposition of her fa∣ther,
who was attacked with a fever;
which, though not thought to be of a
dangerous kind, gave a severe shock to
his constitution. Madame St. Aubert
and Emily attended him with unremitting
care; but his recovery was very slow,
and, as he advanced towards health, Ma∣dame
seemed to decline.</P>
<P>The first scene he visited, after he was
well enough to take the air, was his fa∣vourite
fishing-house. A basket of provi∣sions
was sent thither, with books, and
Emily's lute; for fishing-tackle he had
to use, for he never could find amuse∣ment
in torturing or destroying.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
After employing himself, for about an
hour, in botanizing, dinner was served.
It was a repast, to which gratitude, for
being again permitted to visit this spot,
gave sweetness; and family happiness once
more smiled beneath these shades. Mon∣sieur
St. Aubert conversed with unusual
cheerfulness; every object delighted his
senses. The refreshing pleasure from the
first view of nature, after the pain of ill∣ness,
and the confinement of a sick-cham∣ber,
is above the conceptions, as well as
the descriptions, of those in health. The
green woods and pastures; the flowery
turf; the blue concave of the heavens;
the balmy air; the murmur of the limpid
stream; and even the hum of every little
insect of the shade, seem to revivify the
soul, and make mere existence bliss.</P>
<P>Madame St. Aubert, reanimated by
the cheerfulness and recovery of her hus∣band,
was no longer sensible of the in∣disposition
which had lately oppressed
her; and, as she sauntered along the
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
wood walks of this romantic glen, and
conversed with him, and with her daugh∣ter,
she often looked at them alternately
with a degree of tenderness, that filled her
eyes with tears. St. Aubert observed
this more than once, and gently reproved
her for the emotion; but she could only
smile, clasp his hand, and that of Emi∣ly,
and weep the more. He felt the ten∣der
enthusiasm stealing upon himself in a
degree that became almost painful; his
features assumed a serious air, and he
could not forbear secretly sighing—"Perhaps
I shall some time look back to
these moments, as to the summit of my
happiness, with hopeless regret. But let
me not misuse them by useless anticipa∣tion;
let me hope I shall not live to
mourn the loss of those who are dearer
to me than life."</P>
<P>To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the
pensive temper of his mind, hebade Emily
fetch the lute she knew how to touch with
such sweet pathos. As she drew near the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
fishing-house, she was surprised to hear
the tones of the instrument, which were
awakened by the hand of taste, and ut∣tered
a plaintive air, whose exquisite me∣lody
engaged all her attention. She listen∣ed
in profound silence, afraid to move
from the spot, lest the sound of her steps
should occasion her to lose a note of the
music, or should disturb the musician.
Every thing without the building was
still, and no person appeared. She conti∣nued
to listen, till timidity succeeded to
surprise and delight; a timidity, increased
by a remembrance of the pencilled lines
she had formerly seen, and she hesitated
whether to proceed, or to return.</P>
<P>While she paused, the music ceased;
and, after a momentary hesitation, she re∣collected
courage to advance to the fish∣ing-house,
which she entered with falter∣ing
steps, and found unoccupied! Her lute
lay on the table; every thing seemed un∣disturbed,
and she began to believe it was
another instrument she had heard, till she
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
remembered, that, when she followed M.
and Madame St. Aubert from this spot,
her lute was left on a window seat. She
felt alarmed, yet knew not wherefore;
the melancholy gloom of evening, and
the profound stillness of the place, inter∣rupted
only by the light trembling of
leaves, heightened her fanciful apprehen∣sions,
and she was desirous of quitting
the building, but perceived herself grow
faint, and sat down. As she tried to re∣cover
herself, the pencilled lines on the
wainscot met her eye; she started, as if
she had seen a stranger; but, endeavour∣ing
to conquer the tremour of her spi∣rits,
rose, and went to the window. To
the lines before noticed she now perceived
that others were added, in which her name
appeared.</P>
<P>Though no longer suffered to doubt
that they were addressed to herself, she
was as ignorant, as before, by whom
they could be written. While she mused,
she thought she heard the found of a
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
step without the building, and again
alarmed, she caught up her lute, and hur∣ried
away. Monsieur and Madame St.
Aubert she found in a little path that
wound along the sides of the glen.</P>
<P>Having reached a green summit, sha∣dowed
by palm-trees, and overlooking
the vallies and plains of Gascony, they
seated themselves on the turf; and while
their eyes wandered over the glorious
scene, and they inhaled the sweet breath
of flowers and herbs that enriched the
grass, Emily played and sung several of
their favourite airs, with the delicacy of
expression in which she so much excelled.</P>
<P>Music and conversation detained them
in this enchanting spot, till the sun's last
light stept upon the plains; till the white
sails that glided beneath the mountains,
where the Garonne wandered, became
dim, and the gloom of evening stole over
the landscape. It was a melancholy but
not unpleasing gloom. St. Aubert and
his family rose, and left the place with
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
regret; alas! Madame St. Aubert knew
not that she left it for ever.</P>
<P>When they reached the fishing-house
she missed her bracelet, and recollected
that she had taken it from her arm after
dinner, and had left it on the table when
she went to walk. After a long search,
in which Emily was very active, she was
compelled to resign herself to the loss of
it. What made this bracelet valuable
to her was a miniature of her daughter
to which it was attached, esteemed a
striking resemblance, and which had been
painted only a few months before. When
Emily was convinced that the bracelet
was really gone, she blushed, and became
thoughtful. That some stranger had
been in the fishing-house, during her ab∣sence,
her lute, and the additional lines of
a pencil, had already informed her: from
the purport of these lines it was not un∣reasonable
to believe, that the poet, the
musician, and the thief were the same per∣son.
But though the music she had heard
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
the written lines she had seen, and the dis∣appearance
of the picture, formed a com∣bination
of circumstances very remarkable,
she was irresistibly restrained from men∣tioning
them; secretly determining, how∣ever,
never again to visit the fishing-house
without Monsieur or Madame St. Aubert.</P>
<P>They returned pensively to the chateau,
Emily musing on the incident which had
just occurred; St. Aubert reflecting, with
placid gratitude, on the blessings he posses∣sed;
and Madame St. Aubert somewhat
disturbed, and perplexed, by the loss of
her daughter's picture. As they drew
near the house, they observed an
unusual bustle about it; the sound of
voices was distinctly heard, servants and
horses were seen passing between the trees,
and, at length, the wheels of a carriage
rolled along. Having come within view of
the front of the chateau, a landau, with
smoking horses, appeared on the little
lawn before it. St. Aubert perceived the
liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
parlour he found Monsieur and Madame
Quesnel already entered. They had left
Paris some days before, and were on the
way to their estate, only ten leagues dis∣tant
from La Vallée, and which Mon∣sieur
Quesnel had purchased several years
before of St. Aubert. This gentleman
was the only brother of Madame St. Au∣bert;
but the ties of relationship having
never been strengthened by congeniality
of character, the intercourse between them
had not been frequent. M. Quesnel had
lived altogether in the world; his aim
had been consequence; splendour was
the object of his taste; and his address and
knowledge of character had carried him
forward to the attainment of almost all
that he had courted. By a man of such
a disposition, it is not surprising that the
virtues of St. Aubert should be overlook∣ed;
or that his pure taste, simplicity, and
moderated wishes, were considered as
marks of a weak intellect, and of con∣fined
views. The marriage of his sister
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
with St. Aubert had been mortifying to
his ambition, for he had designed that
the matrimonial connection she form∣ed
should assist him to attain the conse∣quence
which he so much desired; and
some offers were made her by persons
whose rank and fortune flattered his
warmest hope. But his sister, who was
then addressed also by St. Aubert, per∣ceived,
or thought she perceived, that
happiness and splendour were not the
same, and she did not hesitate to forego
the last for the attainment of the former.
Whether Monsieur Quesnel thought them
the same, or not, he would readily have sa∣crificed
his sister's peace to the gratifica∣tion
of his own ambition; and, on her
marriage with St. Aubert, expressed in
private his contempt of her spiritless con∣duct,
and of the connection which it per∣mitted.
Madame St. Aubert, though she
concealed this insult from her husband,
felt, perhaps, for the first time, resentment
lighted in her heart; and, though a re∣gard
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
for her own dignity, united with
considerations of prudence, restrained her
expression of this resentment, there was
ever after a mild reserve in her manner
towards M. Quesnel, which he both un∣derstood
and felt.</P>
<P>In his own marriage he did not follow
his sister's example. His lady was an
Italian, and an heiress by birth; and, by
nature and education, was a vain and fri∣volous
woman.</P>
<P>They now determined to pass the
night with St. Aubert; and as the cha∣teau
was not large enough to accommo∣date
their servants, the latter were dismiss∣ed
to the neighbouring village. When
the first compliments were over, and the
arrangements for the night made, M.
Quesnel began the display of his intelli∣gence
and his connections; while St.
Aubert, who had been long enough in
retirement to find these topics recom∣mended
by their novelty, listened, with
a degree of patience and attention, which
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
his guest mistook for the humility of
wonder. The latter, indeed, described
the few festivities which the turbulence
of that period permitted to the court of
Henry the Third, with a minuteness, that
somewhat recompensed for his ostenta∣tion;
but, when he came to speak of the
character of the Duke de Joyeuse, of a
secret treaty, which he knew to be nego∣ciating
with the Porte, and of the light
in which Henry of Navarre was received,
M. St. Aubert recollected enough of
his former experience to be assured, that
his guest could be only of an inferior
class of politicians; and that, from the
importance of the subjects upon which he
committed himself, he could not be of
the rank to which he pretended to be∣long.
The opinions delivered by M.
Quesnel, were such as St. Aubert forbore
to reply to, for he knew that his guest
had neither humanity to feel, nor discern∣ment
to perceive, what is just.</P>
<P>Madame Quesnel, meanwhile, was ex∣pressing
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
to Madame St. Aubert her astonish∣ment,
that she could bear to pass her life
in this remote corner of the world, as she
called it, and describing, from a wish, pro∣bably,
of exciting envy, the splendour of
the balls, banquets, and processions which
had just been given by the court, in ho∣nour
of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeuse
with Margaretta of Lorrain, the sister of
the Queen. She described with equal mi∣nuteness
the magnificence she had seen,
and that from which she had been ex∣cluded;
while Emily's vivid fancy, as
she listened with the ardent curiosity of
youth, heightened the scenes she heard of;
and Madame St. Aubert, looking on her
family, felt, as a tear stole to her eye,
that though splendour may grace happi∣ness,
virtue only can bestow it.</P>
<P>"It is now twelve years, St. Aubert," said
M. Quesnel, "since I purchased your fa∣mily
estate."—"Somewhere thereabout,"
replied St. Aubert, suppressing a sigh. "It
is near five years since I have been there,"
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
resumed Quesnel; "for Paris and its neigh∣bourhood
is the only place in the world
to live in, and I am so immersed in politics,
and have so many affairs of moment on
my hands, that I find it difficult to steal
away even for a month or two." St.
Aubert remaining silent, M. Quesnel pro∣ceeded:
"I have sometimes wondered
how you, who have, lived in the capital,
and have been accustomed to company,
can exist elsewhere;—especially in so re∣mote
a country as this, where you can
neither hear nor fee any thing, and can in
short be scarcely conscious of life."</P>
<P>"I live for my family and myself," said:
St. Aubert; "I am now contented to know
only happiness;—formerly I knew life."</P>
<P>"I mean to expend thirty or forty
thousand livres on improvements," said.
M. Quesnel, without seeming to notice
the words of St. Aubert; "for I design,
next summer, to bring here my friends,
the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis
Ramont, to pass a month or two with
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
me." To St. Aubert's enquiry, as to
these intended improvements, he replied,
that he should take down the old east wing
of the chateau, and raise upon the site a
set of stables. "Then I shall build," said
he, "<HI>a salle à manger,</HI> a <HI>salon,</HI> a <HI>salle au
commune,</HI> and a number of rooms for ser∣vants;
for at present there is not accom∣modation
for a third part of my own
people."</P>
<P>"It accommodated our father's house-hold,"
said St. Aubert, grieved that the
old mansion was to be thus improved,
"and that was not a small one."</P>
<P>"Our notions are somewhat enlarged
since those days," said M. Quesnel;—"what
was then thought a decent style of
living would not now be endured." Even
the calm St. Aubert blushed at these
words, but his anger soon yielded to con∣tempt.
"The ground about the chateau
is encumbered with trees; I mean to cut
some of them down."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
"Cut down the trees too!" said St.
Aubert.</P>
<P>"Certainly. Why should I not? they
interrupt my prospects. There is a
cheshut which spreads its branches be∣fore
the whole south side of the cha∣teau,
and which is so ancient that they
tell me the hollow of its trunk will
hold a dozen men. Your enthusiasm will
scarcely contend that there can be either
use, or beauty, in such a sapless old tree
as this."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed St. Aubert,
"you surely will not destroy that noble
chesnut, which has flourished for centuries,
the glory of the estate! It was in its ma∣turity
when the present mansion was
built. How often, in my youth, I have
climbed among its broad branches, and
sat embowered amidst a world of leaves,
while the heavy shower has pattered above,
and not a rain drop reached me! How
often I have sat with a book in my hand,
sometimes reading, and sometimes look∣ing
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
out between the branches upon the
wide landscape, and the setting sun, till twi∣light
came, and brought the birds home
to their little nests among the leaves!
How often—but pardon me," added St.
Aubert, recollecting that he was speaking
to a man who could neither comprehend,
nor allow for his feelings, "I am talking of
times and feelings as old-fashioned as the
taste that would spare that venerable tree."</P>
<P>"It will certainly come down," said
M. Quesnel; "I believe I shall plant
some Lombardy poplars among the
clumps of chesnut, that I shall leave of
the avenue; Madame Quesnel is partial to
the poplar, and tells me how much it
adorns a villa of her uncle, not far from
Venice."</P>
<P>"On the banks of the Brenta, indeed,"
continued St. Aubert, "where its spiry
form is intermingled with the pine, and
the cypress, and where it plays over light
and elegant porticos and colonnades, it,
unquestionably, adorns the scene; but
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
among the giants of the forest, and near
a heavy gothic mansion—"</P>
<P>"Well, my good sir," said M. Ques∣nel,
"I will not dispute with you. You
must return to Paris before our ideas can▪
at all agree. But <HI>à-propos</HI> of Venice; I
have some thoughts of going thither, next
summer; events may call me to take pos∣session
of that same villa, too, which they
tell me is the most charming that can be
imagined. In that case I shall leave the
improvements▪ I mention to another
year, and I may, perhaps, be tempted to
stay some time, in Italy."</P>
<P>Emily was somewhat surprised to hear
him talk of being tempted to remain
abroad, after he had mentioned his pre∣sence
to be so necessary at Paris, that it
was with difficulty he could steal away
for a month or two; but St. Aubert un∣derstood
the self-importance of the man
too well to wonder at this trait; and the
possibility, that these projected improve∣ments
might be deferred, gave him
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
a hope, that they might never take
place.</P>
<P>Before they separated for the night, M.
Quesnel desired to speak with St. Aubert
alone, and they retired to another room,
where they remained a considerable time.
The subject of this conversation was not
known; but, whatever it might be, St.
Aubert, when he returned to the supper∣room,
seemed much disturbed, and a
shade of sorrow sometimes fell upon his
features, that alarmed Madame St. Au∣bert.
When they were alone she was
tempted to enquire the occasion of it,
but the delicacy of mind, which had ever
appeared in his conduct, restrained her:
she considered that, if St. Aubert wished
her to be acquainted with the subject of his
concern, he would not wait for her enquiries.</P>
<P>On the following day, before M. Ques∣nel
departed, he had a second conference
with, St. Aubert.</P>
<P>The guests, after dining at she chateau,
set out in the cool of the day for Epourville,
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
whither they gave him and Madame St.
Aubert a pressing invitation, prompted
rather by the vanity of displaying their
splendour, than by a wish to make their
friends happy.</P>
<P>Emily returned, with delight, to the li∣berty
which their presence had restrain∣ed,
to her books, her walks, and the ra∣tional
conversation of M. and Madame St.
Aubert, who seemed to rejoice, no less,
that they were delivered from the shackles,
which arrogance and frivolity had im∣posed.</P>
<P>Madame St. Aubert excused herself
from sharing their usual evening walk,
complaining that she was not quite
well, and St. Aubert and Emily went
out together.</P>
<P>They chose a walk towards the moun∣tains,
intending to visit some old pensioners
of St. Aubert, which, from his very mo∣derate
income, he contrived to support,
though it is probable M. Quesnel, with
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
his very large one, could not have afforded
this.</P>
<P>After distributing to his pensioners
their weekly stipends, listening patiently
to the complaints of some, redressing the
grievances of others, and softening the
discontents of all, by the look of sympathy,
and the smile of benevolence, St. Aubert
returned home through the woods,</P>
<Q><L>—where</L>
<L>At fall of eve the fairy-people throng,</L>
<L>In various games and revelry to pass</L>
<L>The summer night, as village stories tell,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THOMPSON.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>"The evening gloom of woods was
always delightful to me," said St. Aubert,
whose mind now experienced the sweet
calm, which results from the consciousness
of having done a beneficent action, and
which disposes it to receive pleasure from
every surrounding object. "I remember
that in my youth this gloom used to call
forth to my fancy a thousand fairy visions,
and romantic images; and, I own, I am not
yet wholly insensible of that high enthu∣siasm,
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
which wakes the poet's dream. I can
linger, with solemn steps, under the deep
shades, send forward a transforming eye
into the distant obscurity, and listen with
thrilling delight to the mystic murmuring
of the woods."</P>
<P>"O my dear father," said Emily, while
a sudden tear started to her eye, "how
exactly you describe what I have felt so
often, and which I thought nobody had
ever felt but myself! But hark! here
comes the sweeping sound over the wood∣tops;—now
it dies away;—how solemn
the stillness that succeeds! Now the
breeze swells again. It is like the
voice of some supernatural being—the
voice of the spirit of the woods, that
watches over them by night. Ah! what
light is yonder? But it is gone. And
now it gleams again, near the root of that
large chesnut: look, sir!"</P>
<P>"Are you such an admirer of nature,"
said St. Aubert, "and so little acquainted
with her appearances as not to know that
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
for the glow-worm? But come," added
he gaily, "step a little further, and we
shall see fairies, perhaps; they are often
companions. The glow-worm lends his
light, and they in return charm him with
music, and the dance. Do you see no∣thing
tripping yonder?"</P>
<P>Emily laughed. "Well, my dear sir,"
said she, "since you allow of this alliance,
I may venture to own I have anticipated
you; and almost dare venture to repeat
some verses I made one evening in these
very woods."</P>
<P>"Nay," replied St. Aubert, "dismiss
the <HI>almost,</HI> and venture quite; let us hear
what vagaries fancy has been playing in
your mind. If fhe has given you one of
her spells, you need not envy those of the
fairies."</P>
<P>"If it is strong enough to enchant
your judgment, sir," said Emily, "while
I disclose her images, I need <HI>not</HI> envy
them. The lines go in a sort of trip∣ping
measure, which I thought might suit
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
the subject well enough, but I fear they
are too irregular.</P>

Whatever St. Aubert might think
of the stanzas, he would not deny his

and they walked on in silence.</P>

<P>St. Aubert continued silent till he
reached the chateau, where his wife had
retired to her chamber. The languor and
dejection, that had lately oppressed her,
and which the exertion called forth by the
arrival of her guests had suspended, now
returned with increased effect. On the fol∣lowing
day, symptoms of fever appeared,
and St. Aubert, having sent for medical
advice, learned, that her disorder was a
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
fever of the same nature as that, from
which he had lately recovered. She had,
indeed, taken the infection, during her
attendance upon him, and, her constitu∣tion
being too weak to throw out the
disease immediately, it had lurked in her
veins, and occasioned the heavy languor
of which she had complained. St. Au∣bert,
whose anxiety for his wife overcame
every other consideration, detained the
physician in his house. He remembered
the feelings and the reflections that had
called a momentary gloom upon his mind,
on the day when he had last visited the
fishing-house, in company with Madame
St. Aubert, and he now admitted a pre∣sentiment,
that this illness would be a
fatal one. But he effectually concealed
this from her, and from his daughter,
whom he endeavoured to re-animate wit
hopes that her constant assiduities woul
not be unavailing. The physician, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
asked by St. Aubert for his opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the disorder, replied, that the event of
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
depended upon circumstances which he
could not ascertain. Madame St. Aubert
seemed to have formed a more decided
one; but her eyes only gave hints of
this. She frequently fixed them upon
her anxious friends with an expression
of pity, and of tenderness, as if she an∣ticipated
the sorrow that awaited them,
and that seemed to say, it was for their
sakes only, for their sufferings, that she
regretted life. On the seventh day, the
disorder was at its crisis. The physician
assumed a graver manner, which she ob∣served,
and took occasion, when her
family had once quitted the chamber, to
tell him, that she perceived her death was
approaching. "Do not attempt to de∣ceive
me," said she, "I feel that I can∣not
long survive. I am prepared for
the event, I have long, I hope, been pre∣paring
for it. Since I have not long
to live, do not suffer a mistaken com∣passion
to induce you to flatter my
family with false hopes, If you do, their
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
affliction will only be the heavier when it
arrives: I will endeavour to teach them re∣signation
by my example."</P>
<P>The physician was affected; he pro∣mised
to obey her, and told St. Aubert, some∣what
abruptly, that there was nothing to
expect. The latter was not philosopher
enough to restrain his feelings when he re∣ceived
this information; but a consideration
of the increased affliction which the obser∣vance
of his grief would occasion his wife,
enabled him, after some time, to command
himself in her presence. Emily was at first
overwhelmed with the intelligence; then,
deluded by the strength of her wishes, a
hope sprung up in her mind that her mother
would yet recover, and to this she perti∣naciously
adhered almost to the last hour.</P>
<P>The progress of this disorder was marked,
on the side of Madame St. Aubert, by
patient suffering, and subjected wishes. The
composure, with which she awaited her
death, could be derived only from the re∣trospect
of a life governed, as far as human
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
frailty permits, by a consciousness of being
always in the presence of the Deity, and by
the hope of an higher world. But her piety
could not entirely subdue the grief of part∣ing
from those whom she so dearly loved.
During these her last hours, she conversed
much with St. Aubert and Emily, on the
prospect of futurity, and on other religious
topics. The resignation she expressed, with
the firm hope of meeting in a future world
the friends she left in this, and the effort
which sometimes appeared to conceal her sor∣row
at this temporary separation, frequent∣ly
affected St. Aubert so much as to oblige
him to leave the room. Having indulged
his tears awhile, he would dry them and
return to the chamber with a countenance
composed by an endeavour which did but
increase his grief.</P>
<P>Never had Emily felt the importance of
the lessons, which had taught her to restrain
her sensibility, so much as in these moments,
and never had she practised them with a
triumph so complete. But when the last
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
was over, she sunk at once under the pressure
of her sorrow, and then perceived that it was
hope, as well as fortitude, which had hither∣to
supported her. St. Aubert was for a time
too devoid of comfort himself to bestow any
on his daughter.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MADAME St. Aubert was interred in
the neighbouring village church; her hus∣band
and daughter attended her to the
grave, followed by a long train of the pea∣santry,
who were sincere mourners of this
excellent woman.</P>
<P>On his return from the funeral, St. Aubert
shut himself in his chamber. When he
came forth, it was with a serene countenance,
though pale in sorrow. He gave orders that
his family should attend him. Emily only
was absent; who, overcome with the scene
she had just witnessed, had retired to her
closet to weep alone. St. Aubert followed her
thither: he took her hand in silence, while she
continued to weep; and it was some moments
before he could so far command his voice as
to speak. It trembled while he said, "My
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
Emily, I am going to prayers with my fa∣mily;
you will join us. We must ask sup∣port
from above. Where else ought we to
seek it—where else can we find it?"</P>
<P>Emily checked her tears, and followed
her father to the parlour, where, the servants
being assembled, St. Aubert read, in a low
and solemn voice, the evening service, and
added a prayer for the soul of the departed.
During this, his voice often faltered, his
tears fell upon the book, and at length he
paused. But the sublime emotions of pure
devotion gradually elevated his views above
this world, and finally brought comfort to
his heart.</P>
<P>When the service was ended, and the ser∣vants
were withdrawn, he tenderly kissed
Emily, and said, "I have endeavoured to
teach you, from your earliest youth, the duty
of self-command; I have pointed out to you
the great importance of it through life,
not only as it preserves us in the various
and dangerous temptations that call us from
rectitude and virtue, but as it limits the
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
indulgences which are termed virtuous, yet
which, extended beyond a certain boundary,
are vicious, for their consequence is evil.
All excess is vicious; even that sorrow, which
is amiable in its origin, becomes a selfish and
unjust, passion, if indulged at the expence of
our duties—by our duties I mean what we
owe to ourselves, as well as to others. The
indulgence of excessive grief enervates the
mind, and almost incapacitates it for again
partaking of those various innocent enjoy∣ments
which a benevolent God designed to
be the sun-shine of our lives. My dear
Emily, recollect and practise the precepts I
have so often given you, and which your
own experience has so often shewn you to
be wise.</P>
<P>"Your sorrow is useless. Do not receive
this as merely a common-place remark, but
let reason <HI>therefore</HI> restrain sorrow. I would
not annihilate your feelings, my child, I
would only teach you to command them;
for whatever may be the evils resulting from
a too susceptible heart, nothing can be hoped
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
from an insensible one; that, on the other
hand, is all vice—vice, of which the de∣formity
is not softened, or the effect con∣soled
for, by any semblance or possibility
of good. You know my sufferings, and
are, therefore, convinced that mine are not
the light words which, on these occasions,
are so often repeated to destroy even the
sources of honest emotion, or which merely
display the selfish ostentation of a false phi∣losophy.
I will shew my Emily, that I can
practise what I advise. I have said thus
much, because I cannot bear to see you wast∣ing
in useless sorrow, for want of that resist∣ance
which is due from mind; and I have
not said, it till now, because there is a period
when all reasoning must yield to nature;
that is past: and another, when excessive in∣dulgence,
having sunk into habit, weighs
down the elasticity of the spirits so as to
render conquest nearly impossible; this is
to come. You, my Emily, will shew that
you are willing to avoid it."</P>
<P>Emily smiled through her tears upon her
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
father: "Dear Sir," said she, and her voice
trembled; she would have added, "I will
shew myself worthy of being your daugh∣ter;"
but a mingled emotion of gratitude,
affection, and grief overcame her. St.
Aubert suffered her to weep without inter∣ruption,
and then began to talk on com∣mon
topics.</P>
<P>The first person who came to condole
with St. Aubert was an M. Barreaux, an
austere and seemingly unfeeling man. A
taste for botany had introduced them to each
other, for they had frequently met in their
wanderings among the mountains. M. Bar∣reaux
had retired from the world, and almost
from society, to live in a pleasant chateau,
on the skirts of the woods, near La Vallée.
He also had been disappointed in his opi∣nion
of mankind; but he did not, like St.
Aubert, pity and mourn for them; he felt
more indignation at their vices, than com∣passion
for their weaknesses.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was somewhat surprised to see
him; for, though he had often pressed him
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
to come to the chateau, he had never till
now accepted the invitation; and now he
came without ceremony or reserve, entering
the parlour as an old friend. The claims
of misfortune appeared to have softened
down all the ruggedness and prejudices of
his heart. St. Aubert unhappy, seemed to
be the sole idea that occupied his mind. It
was in manners, more than in words, that he
appeared to sympathize with his friends: he
spoke little on the subject of their grief; but
the minute attention he gave them, and the
modulated voice, and softened look that
accompanied it, came from his heart, and
spoke to theirs.</P>
<P>At this melancholy period, St. Aubert
was likewise visited by Madame Cheron, his
only surviving sister, who had been some
years a widow, and now resided on her own
estate near Tholouse. The intercourse be∣tween
them had not been very frequent. In
her condolements, words were not wanting;
she understood not the magic of the look
that speaks at once to the soul, or the voice
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
that sinks like balm to the heart: but she
assured St. Aubert that she sincerely sym∣pathized
with him, praised the virtues of
his late wife, and then offered what she con∣sidered
to be consolation. Emily wept un∣ceasingly
while she spoke; St. Aubert was
tranquil, listened to what she said in silence,
and then turned the discourse upon another
subject.</P>
<P>At parting she pressed him and her niece
to make her an early visit. "Change of
place will amuse you," said she, "and it is
wrong to give way to grief." St. Aubert
acknowledged the truth of these words of
course; but, at the same time, felt more
reluctant than ever to quit the spot which
his past happiness had consecrated. The
presence of his wife had sanctified every sur∣rounding
scene, and, each day, as it gra∣dually
softened the acuteness of his suffer∣ing,
assisted the tender enchantment that
bound him to home.</P>
<P>But there were calls which must be com∣plied
with, and of this kind was the visit he
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
paid to his brother-in-law M. Quesnel. An
affair of an interesting nature made it neces∣sary
that he should delay this visit no longer,
and, wishing to rouse Emily from her dejec∣tion,
he took her with him to Epourville.</P>
<P>As the carriage entered upon the forest
that adjoined his paternal domain, his eyes
once more caught, between the chesnut
avenue, the turreted corners of the chateau.
He sighed to think of what had passed
since he was last there, and that it was now
the property of a man who neither revered
nor valued it. At length he entered the
avenue, whose lofty trees had so often de∣lighted
him when a boy, and whose melan∣choly
shade was now so congenial with the
tone of his spirits. Every feature of the edifice,
distinguished by an air of heavy grandeur,
appeared successively between the branches
of the trees—the broad turret, the arched
gate-way that led into the courts, the draw∣bridge,
and the dry fosse which surrounded
the whole.</P>
<P>The found of carriage wheels brought a
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
troop of servants to the great gate, where St.
Aubert alighted, and from which he led
Emily into the gothic halsl, now no longer
hung with the arms and ancient banners of
the family. These were displaced, and the
oak wainscotting, and beams that crossed the
roof, were painted white. The large table,
too, that used to stretch along the upper
end of the hall, where the master of the
mansion loved to display his hospitality, and
whence the peal of laughter, and the song of
conviviality, had so often resounded, was
now removed; even the benches that had
surrounded the hall were no longer there.
The heavy walls were hung with frivolous
ornaments, and every thing that appeared
denoted the false taste and corrupted senti∣ments
of the present owner.</P>
<P>St. Aubert followed a gay Parisian servant
to a parlour, where sat Mons. and Madame
Quesnel, who received him with a stately
politeness, and, after a few formal words of
condolement, seemed to have forgotten that
they ever had a sister.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63"/>
Emily felt tears swell into her eyes, and
then resentment checked them. St. Aubert,
calm and deliberate, preserved his dig∣nity
without assuming importance, and
Quesnel was depressed by his presence
without exactly knowing wherefore.</P>
<P>After some general conversation, St. Aubert
requested to speak with him alone; and
Emily, being left with Madame Quesnel,
soon learned that a large party was invited
to dine at the chateau, and was compelled
to hear that nothing which was past and ir∣remediable
ought to prevent the festivity of
the present hour.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, when he was told that com∣pany
were expected, felt a mixed emotion
of disgust and indignation against the insen∣sibility
of Quesnel, which prompted him to
return home immediately. But he was in∣formed,
that Madame Cheron had been ask∣ed
to meet him; and, when he looked at
Emily, and considered that a time might
come when the enmity of her uncle would
be prejudicial to her, he determined not to
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
incur it himself, by conduct which would be
resented as indecorous, by the very persons
who now shewed so little sense of decorum.</P>
<P>Among the visitors assembled at dinner
were two Italian gentlemen, of whom one
was named Montoni, a distant relation of
Madame Quesnel, a man about forty, of an
uncommonly handsome person, with fea∣tures
manly and expressive, but whose coun∣tenance
exhibited, upon the whole, more of
the haughtiness of command, and the quick∣ness
of discernment, than of any other cha∣racter.</P>
<P>Signor Cavigni, his friend, appeared to
be about thirty—his inferior indignity, but
equal to him in penetration of countenance,
and superior in insinuation of manner.</P>
<P>Emily was shocked by the salutation with
which Madame Cheron met her father—"Dear
brother," said she, "I am concerned
to see you look so very ill; do, pray, have
advice!" St. Aubert answered, with a me∣lancholy
smile, that he felt himself much as
usual; but Emily's fears made her now fancy
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
that her father looked worse than he really
did.</P>
<P>Emily would have been amused by the
new characters she saw, and the varied
conversation that passed during dinner,
which was served in a style of splen∣dour
she had seldom seen before, had her
spirits been less oppressed. Of the guests,
Signor Montoni was lately come from
Italy, and he spoke of the commotions
which at that period agitated the country;
talked of party differences with warmth, and
then lamented the probable consequences
of the tumults. His friend spoke with
equal ardour, of the politics of his country;
praised the government and prosperity of
Venice, and boasted of its decided superio∣rity
over all the other Italian states. He
then turned to the ladies, and talked with
the same eloquence, of Parisian fashions, the
French opera, and French manners; and on
the latter subject he did not fail to mingle
what is so particularly agreeable to French
taste. The flattery was not detected by
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
those to whom it was addressed, though its
effect, in producing submissive attention, did
not escape his observation. When he could
disengage himself from the assiduities of the
other ladies, he sometimes addressed Emily:
but she knew nothing of Parisian fashions,
or Parisian operas; and her modesty, simpli∣city,
and correct manners formed a decided
contrast to those of her female companions.</P>
<P>After dinner, St. Aubert stole from the
room to view once more the old chesnut
which Quesnel talked of cutting down. As
he stood under its shade, and looked up
among its branches, still luxuriant, and saw
here and there the blue sky trembling be∣tween
them; the pursuits and events of his
early days crowded fast to his mind, with
the figures and characters of friends—long
since gone from the earth; and he now felt
himself to be almost an insulated being,
with nobody but his Emily for his heart to
turn to.</P>
<P>He stood lost amid the scenes of years
which fancy called up, till the succession
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
closed with the picture of his dying wife,
and he started away, to forget it, if possible,
at the social board.</P>
<P>St. Aubert ordered his carriage at an early
hour, and Emily observed, that he was more
than unusually silent and dejected on the way
home; but she considered this to be the
effect of his visit to a place which spoke so
eloquently of former times, nor suspected
that he had a cause of grief which he con∣cealed
from her.</P>
<P>On entering the chateau she felt more
depressed than ever, for she more than ever
missed the presence of that dear parent, who,
whenever she had been from home, used to
welcome her return with smiles and fond∣ness;
now, all was silent and forsaken.</P>
<P>But what reason and effort may fail to
do, time effects. Week after week passed
away, and each, as it passed, stole something
from the harshness of her affliction, till it was
mellowed to that tenderness which the feel∣ing
heart cherishes as sacred. St. Aubert,
on the contrary, visibly declined in health;
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
though Emily, who had been so constantly
with him, was almost the last person who ob∣served
it. His constitution had never reco∣vered
from the late attack of the fever, and
the succeeding shock it had received from
Madame St. Aubert's death had produced
its present infirmity. His physician now
ordered him to travel; for it was percepti∣ble
that sorrow had seized upon his nerves,
weakened as they had been by the preced∣ing
illness; and variety of scene, it was pro∣bable,
would, by amusing his mind, restore
them to their proper tone.</P>
<P>For some days Emily was occupied in
preparations to attend him; and he, by
endeavours to diminish his expences at
home during the journey—a purpose which
determined him at length to dismiss his do∣mestics.
Emily seldom opposed her father's
wishes by questions or remonstrances, or
she would now have asked why he did not
take a servant, and have represented that his
infirm health made one almost necessary.
But when, on the eve of their departure, she
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
found that he had dismissed Jacques, Fran∣cis,
and Mary, and detained only Theresa
the old housekeeper, she was extremely sur∣prised,
and ventured to ask his reason for
having done so. "To save expences, my
dear," he replied—"we are going on an
expensive excursion."</P>
<P>The physician had prescribed the air of
Languedoc and Provence; and St. Aubert
determined, therefore, to travel leisurely
along the shores of the Mediterranean, to∣wards
Provence.</P>
<P>They retired early to their chamber on
the night before their departure; but Emily
had a few books and other things to col∣lect,
and the clock had struck twelve before
she had finished, or had remembered that
some of her drawing instruments, which she
meant to take with her, were in the par∣lour
below. As she went to fetch these,
she passed her father's room, and, perceiv∣ing
the door half open, concluded that he
was in his study—for, since the death of
Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
his custom to rise from his restless bed, and
go thither to compose his mind. When she
was below stairs she looked into this room,
but without finding him; and as she returned
to her chamber, she tapped at his door, and
receiving no answer, stepped softly in, to be
certain whether he was there.</P>
<P>The room was dark, but a light glim∣mered
through some panes of glass that
were placed in the upper part of a closet∣door.
Emily believed her father to be in
the closet, and, surprised that he was up at
so late an hour, apprehended he was unwell,
and was going to enquire; but, considering
that her sudden appearance at this hour
might alarm him, she removed her light to
the stair-cafe, and then stepped softly to the
closet. On looking through the panes of
glass, she saw him seated at a small table, with
papers before him, some of which he was
reading with deep attention and interest,
during which he often wept, and sobbed
aloud. Emily, who had come to the door
to learn whether her father was ill, was
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
now detained there by a mixture of curiosity
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd tenderness. She could not witness his
sorrow, without being anxious to know the
subject of it; and she therefore continued
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o observe him in silence, concluding that
those papers were letters of her late mo∣ther.
Presently he knelt down, and with
look so solemn as she had seldom seen him
assume, and which was mingled with a cer∣tain
wild expression, that partook more of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orror than of any other character, he pray∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
silently for a considerable time.</P>
<P>When he rose, a ghastly paleness was on
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is countenance. Emily was hastily retir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g;
but she saw him turn again to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apers, and she stopped. He took from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong them a small case, and from thence
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miniature picture. The rays of light fell
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rongly upon it, and she perceived it to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at of a lady, but not of her mother.</P>
<P>St. Aubert gazed earnestly and tenderly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon this portrait, put it to his lips, and then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his heart, and sighed with a convulsive
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rce. Emily could scarcely believe what
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
she saw to be real. She never knew till now
that he had a picture of any other lady than
her mother, much less that he had one which
he evidently valued so highly; but having
looked repeatedly, to be certain that it was
not the resemblance of Madame St. Au∣bert,
she became entirely convinced that
it was designed for that of some other
person.</P>
<P>At length St. Aubert returned the pic∣ture
into its case; and Emily, recollecting
that she was intruding upon his private sor∣rows,
softly withdrew from the chamber.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. Aubert, instead of taking the more
direct road, that ran along the feet of the
Pyrenées to Languedoc, chose one that,
winding over the heights, afforded more ex∣tensive
views and greater variety of romantic
scenery. He turned a little out of his way
to take leave of M. Barreaux, whom he
found botanizing in the wood near his cha∣teau,
and who, when he was told the purpose
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
of St. Aubert's visit, expressed a degree of
concern, such as his friend had thought it
was scarcely possible for him to feel on any
similar occasion. They parted with mutual
regret.</P>
<P>"If any thing could have tempted me
from my retirement," said M. Barreaux, "it
would have been the pleasure of accompa∣nying
you on this little tour. I do not often
offer compliments; you may, therefore, be∣lieve
me, when I say, that I shall look for
your return with impatience."</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded on their journey.
As they ascended the heights, St. Aubert
often looked back upon his chateau, in the
plain below; tender images crowded to his
mind; his melancholy imagination sug∣gested
that he should return no more; and
though he checked this wandering thought,
still he continued to look, till the haziness
of distance blended his home with the gene∣ral
landscape, and St. Aubert seemed to
"Drag at each remove a lengthening chain."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75"/>
He and Emily continued sunk in musing
silence for some leagues, from which melan∣choly
reverie Emily first awoke, and her
young fancy, struck with the grandeur of
the objects around, gradually yielded to de∣lightful
impressions. The road now de∣scended
into glens, confined by stupendous
walls of rock, grey and barren, except
where shrubs fringed their summits, or
patches of meagre vegetation tinted their
recesses, in which the wild goat was fre∣quently
browsing. And now, the way led
to the lofty cliffs, from whence the landscape
was seen extending in all its magnificence.</P>
<P>Emily could not restrain her transport as
she looked over the pine forests of the moun∣tains
upon the vast plains, that, enriched with
woods, towns, blushing vines, and planta∣tions
of almonds, palms and olives, stretched
along, till their various colours melted in
distance into one harmonious hue, that
seemed to unite earth with heaven. Through
the whole of this glorious scene the majestic
Garonne wandered; descending from its
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
source among the Pyrenées, and winding its
blue waves towards the Bay of Biscay.</P>
<P>The ruggedness of the unfrequented road
often obliged the wanderers to alight from
their little carriage, but they thought them∣selves
amply repaid for this inconvenience
by the grandeur of the scenes; and, while
the muleteer led his animals slowly over the
broken ground, the travellers had leisure to
linger and these solitudes, and to indulge
the sublime reflections, which soften, while
they elevate, the heart, and fill it with the
certainty of a present God! Still the enjoy∣ment
of St. Aubert was touched with that
pensive melancholy, which gives to every
object a mellower tint, and breathes a sacred
charm over all around.</P>
<P>They had provided against part of
the evil to be encountered from a want
of convenient inns, by carrying a stock of
provisions in the carriage, so that they
might take refreshment on any pleasant spot,
in the open air, and pass the nights where∣ever
they should happen to meet with a
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
comfortable cottage. For the mind, also,
they had provided, by a work on botany,
written by M. Barreaux, and by several of
the Latin and Italian poets; while Emily's
pencil enabled her to preserve some of
those combinations of forms, which charm∣ed
her at every step.</P>
<P>The loneliness of the road, where, only
now and then, a peasant was seen driving his
mule, or some mountaineer-children at play
among the rocks, heightened the effect of
the scenery. St. Aubert was so much struck
with it, that he determined, if he could
hear of a road, to penetrate further among
the mountains, and, bending his way rather
more to the south, to emerge into Rousillon,
and coast the Mediterranean along part of
that country to Languedoc.</P>
<P>Soon after mid-day, they reached the
summit of one of those cliffs, which, bright
with the verdure of palm trees, adorn,
like gems, the tremendous walls of the
rocks, and which overlooked the greater
part of Gascony, and part of Languedoc.
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
Here was shade, and the fresh water of a
spring, that, gliding among the turf, under
the trees, thence precipitated itself from
rock to rock, till its dashing murmurs were
lost in the abyss, though its white foam
was long seen amid the darkness of the
pines below.</P>
<P>This was a spot well suited for rest, and
the travellers alighted to dine, while the
mules were unharnessed to browse on the
savoury herbs that enriched this summit.</P>
<P>It was some time before St. Aubert or
Emily could withdraw their attention from
the surrounding objects, so as to partake of
their little repast. Seated in the shade of
the palms, St. Aubert pointed out to her
observation the course of the rivers, the situa∣tion
of great towns, and the boundaries of
provinces, which science, rather than the eye,
enabled him to describe. Notwithstanding
this occupation, when he had talked awhile
he suddenly became silent, thoughtful, and
tears often swelled to his eyes, which Emily
observed, and the sympathy of her own
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
heart told her their cause. The scene
before them bore some resemblance, though
it was on a much grander scale, to a fa∣vourite
one of the late Madame St. Aubert,
within view of the fishing-house. They
both observed this, and thought how de∣lighted
she would have been with the pre∣sent
landscape, while they knew that her eyes
must never, never more open upon this
world. St. Aubert remembered the last
time of his visiting that spot in company
with her, and also the mournfully presaging
thoughts which had then arisen in his mind,
and were now, even thus soon, realized!
The recollections subdued him, and he
abruptly rose from his seat, and walked
away to where no eye could observe his grief.</P>
<P>When he returned, his countenance had
recovered its usual serenity; he took Emi∣ly's
hand, pressed it affectionately, without
speaking, and soon after called to the mu∣leteer,
who sat at a little distance, concern∣ing
a road among the mountains towards
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
Rousillon. Michael said, there were several
that way, but he did not know how far they
extended, or even whether they were pass∣able;
and St. Aubert, who did not intend
to travel after sun set, asked what village
they could reach about that time. The mule∣teer
calculated, that they could easily reach
Mateau, which was in their present road; but
that, if they took a road that sloped more to
the south, towards Rousillon, there was a
hamlet, which he thought they could gain
before the evening shut in.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, after some hesitation, deter∣mined
to take the latter course, and Michael,
having finished his meal, and harnessed his
mules, again set forward, but soon stopped;
and St. Aubert saw him doing homage to a
cross, that stood on a rock impending over
their way. Having concluded his devo∣tions,
he smacked his whip in the air, and,
in spite of the rough road, and the pain of his
poor mules, which he had been lately lament∣ing,
rattled, in a full gallop, along the edge
of a precipice, which it made the eye dizzy
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
to look down. Emily was terrified almost
to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending
still greater danger from suddenly stopping
the driver, was compelled to sit quietly, and
trust his fate to the strength and discretion
of the mules, who seemed to possess a greater
portion of the latter quality than their mas∣ter;
for they carried the travellers safely in∣to
the valley, and there stopped upon the
brink of the rivulet that watered it.</P>
<P>Leaving the splendour of extensive pro∣spects,
they now entered this narrow valley
screened by</P>
<Q><L>Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic spell,</L>
<L>Here scorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green.</L></Q>
<P>The scene of barrenness was here and
there interrupted by the spreading branches
of the larch and cedar, which threw their
gloom over the cliff, or a hwart the torrent
that rolled in the vale. No living creature
appeared, except the izard, scrambling
among the rocks, and often hanging upon
points so dangerous, that fancy shrunk from
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
the view of them. This was such a scene
as <HI>Salvator</HI> would have chosen, had he then
existed, for his canvass; St. Aubert, im∣pressed
by the romantic character of the
place, almost expected to see banditti start
from behind some projecting rock, and be
kept his hand upon the arms with which
he always travelled.</P>
<P>As they advanced, the valley opened; its
savage features gradually softened, and, to∣wards
evening, they were among heathy
mountains, stretched in far perspective,
along which the solitary sheep-bell was
heard, and the voice of the shepherd calling
his wandering flocks to the nightly fold.
His cabin, partly shadowed by the cork-tree
and the ilex, which St. Aubert observed to
flourish in higher regions of the air than any
other trees, except the fir, was all the hu∣man
habitation that yet appeared. Along
the bottom of this valley the most vivid
verdure was spread; and, in the little hol∣low
recesses of the mountains, under the
shade of the oak and chesnut, herds of cat∣tle
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
were grazing. Groups of them, too,
were often seen reposing on the banks of
the rivulet, or laving their sides in the
cool stream, and sipping its wave.</P>
<P>The sun was now setting upon the val∣ley;
its last light gleamed upon the water,
and heightened the rich yellow and purple
tints of the heath and broom, that over∣spread
the mountains. St. Aubert enquired
of Michael the distance to the hamlet he had
mentioned, but the man could not with cer∣tainty
tell; and Emily began to fear that
he had mistaken the road. Here was no
human being to assist, or direct them; they
had left the shepherd and his cabin far be∣hind,
and the scene became so obscured in
twilight, that the eye could not follow the
distant perspective of the valley in search of a
cottage or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon
still marked the west, and this was of some
little use to the travellers. Michael seemed en∣deavouring
to keep up his courage by sing∣ing;
his music, however, was not of a kind
to disperse melancholy; he sung, in a sort of
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
chant, one of the most dismal ditties his
present auditors had ever heard, and St.
Aubert at length discovered it to be a ves∣per-hymn
to his favourite saint.</P>
<P>They travelled on, sunk in that thoughtful
melancholy, with which twilight and solitude
impress the mind. Michael had now ended
his ditty, and nothing was heard but the
drowsy murmur of the breeze among the
woods, and its light flutter, as it blew fresh∣ly
into the carriage. They were at length
roused by the sound of fire-arms. St. Au∣bert
called to the muleteer to stop, and
they listened. The noise was not repeated;
but presently they heard a rustling among
the brakes. St. Aubert drew forth a pistol,
and ordered Michael to proceed as fast as
possible; who had not long obeyed, before
a horn sounded, that made the mountains
ring. He looked again from the window,
and then saw a young man spring from the
bushes into the road, followed by a couple
of dogs. The stranger was in a hunter's
dress. His gun was slung across his shoul∣ders,
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
the hunter's horn hung from his belt,
and in his hand was a small pike, which, as
he held it, added to the manly grace of his
figure, and assisted the agility of his steps.</P>
<P>After a moment's hesitation, St. Aubert
again stopped the carriage, and waited till
he came up, that they might enquire con∣cerning
the hamlet they were in search of.
The stranger informed him, that it was on∣ly
half a league distant, that he was going
thither himself, and would readily shew the
way. St. Aubert thanked him for the of∣fer,
and, pleased with his chevalier-like air
and open countenance, asked him to take a
seat in the carriage; which the stranger, with
an acknowledgment, declined, adding that
he would keep pace with the mules. "But
I fear you will be wretchedly accommo∣dated,"
said he: "the inhabitants of these
mountains are a simple people, who are not
only without the luxuries of life, but al∣most
destitute of what in other places are
held to be its necessaries."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86"/>
"I perceive you are not one of its inha∣bitants,
sir," said St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"No, sir, I am only a wanderer here."</P>
<P>The carriage drove on, and the increasing
dusk made the travellers very thankful that
they had a guide; the frequent glens, too,
that now opened among the mountains, would
likewise have added to their perplexity. Emi∣ly,
as she looked up one of these, saw some∣thing
at a great distance like a bright cloud
in the air. "What light is yonder, sir?"
said she. St. Aubert looked, and perceived
that it was the snowy summit of a mountain,
so much higher than any around it, that it
still reflected the sun's rays, while those be∣low
lay in deep shade.</P>
<P>At length, village lights were seen to
twinkle through the dusk, and, soon after,
some cottages were discovered in the valley,
or rather were seen by reflection in the stream,
on whose margin they stood, and which still
gleamed with the evening light.</P>
<P>The stranger now came up, and St. Au∣bert,
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
on further enquiry, found not only
that there was no inn in the place, but not
any sort of house of public reception. The
stranger, however, offered to walk on, and
enquire for a cottage to accommodate them;
for which further civility St. Aubert return∣ed
his thanks, and said, that, as the village
was so near, he would alight, and walk with
him. Emily followed slowly in the car∣riage.</P>
<P>On the way, St. Aubert asked his companion
what success he had had in the chase. "Not
much, sir," he replied, "nor do I aim at it.
I am pleased with the country, and mean to
saunter away a few weeks among its scenes.
My dogs I take with me more for compa∣nionship
than for game. This dress, too,
gives me an ostensible business, and procures
me that respect from the people, which
would, perhaps, be refused to a lonely stran∣ger,
who had no visible motive for coming
among them."</P>
<P>"I admire your taste," said St. Aubert,
"and, if I was a younger man, should like to
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
pass a few weeks in your way exceedingly.
I, too, am a wanderer, but neither my plan
nor pursuits are exactly like yours—I go in
search of health, as much as of amusement."
St. Aubert sighed, and paused; and then,
seeming to recollect himself, he resumed:
"If I can hear of a tolerable road, that shall
afford decent accommodation, it is my inten∣tion
to pass into Rousillon, and along the
sea-shore to Languedoc. You, sir, seem to
be acquainted with the country, and can,
perhaps, give me information on the sub∣ject."</P>
<P>The stranger said, that what information
he could give was entirely at his service;
and then mentioned a road rather more to
the east, which led to a town, whence it
would be easy to proceed into Rousillon.</P>
<P>They now arrived at the village, and com∣menced
their search for a cottage, that would
afford a night's lodging. In several, which
they entered, ignorance, poverty, and mirth
seemed equally to prevail; and the owners
eyed St. Aubert with a mixture of curiosity
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
and timidity. Nothing like a bed could be
found, and he had ceased to enquire for one,
when Emily joined him, who observed the
languor of her father's countenance, and la∣mented,
that he had taken a road so ill pro∣vided
with the comforts necessary for an in∣valid.
Other cottages, which they examin∣ed,
seemed somewhat less savage than the
former, consisting of two rooms, if such they
could be called; the first of these occupied
by mules and pigs, the second by the fa∣mily,
which generally consisted of fix or
eight children, with their parents, who slept
on beds of skins and dried beech leaves,
spread upon a mud floor. Here, light was
admitted, and smoke discharged, through
an aperture in the roof; and here the scent
of spirits (for the travelling smugglers, who
haunted the Pyrenées, had made this rude
people familiar with the use of liquors)
was generally perceptible enough. Emi∣ly
turned from such scenes, and looked
at her father with anxious tenderness, which
the young stranger seemed to observe; for,
<PB N="88" REF="90"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="89" REF="91"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="86" REF="92"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="87" REF="93"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="88" REF="94"/>
drawing St. Aubert aside, he made him an
offer of his own bed. "It is a decent
one," said he, "when compared with what
we have just seen, yet such as in other cir∣cumstances.
I should be ashamed to offer
you." St. Aubert acknowledged how much
he felt himself obliged by this kindness, but
refused to accept it, till the young stranger
would take no denial. "Do not give me
the pain of knowing, sir," said he, "that
an invalid, like you, lies on hard skins,
while I sleep in a bed. Besides, sir, your
refusal wounds my pride; I must believe
you think my offer unworthy your accept∣ance.
Let me shew you the way. I have
no doubt my landlady can accommodate this
young lady also."</P>
<P>St. Aubert, at length, confented, that, if
this could be done, he would accept his
kindness, though he felt rather surprised,
that the stranger had proved himself so de∣ficient
in gallantry, as to administer to the
repose of an infirm man, rather than to that
of a very lovely young woman, for he had
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
not once offered the room for Emily. But
she thought nor of herself, and the animated
smile she gave him, told how much she felt
herself obliged for the preference of her
father.</P>
<P>On their way, the stranger, whose name
was Valancourt, stepped on first to speak to
his hostess, and she came out to welcome St.
Aubert into a cottage, much superior to any
he had seen. This good woman seemed
very willing to accommodate the strangers,
who were soon compelled to accept the
only two beds in the place. Eggs and milk
were the only food the cottage afforded;
but against scarcity of provisions St. Aubert
had provided and he requested Valancourt
to stay, and partake with him of less home∣ly
fare; an invitation, which was readily ac∣cepted,
and they passed an hour in intelligent
conversation. St. Aubert was much pleased
with the manly frankness, and
keen susceptibillty to the grrandeur of nature,
which his new acquaintance discovered;
and, indeed, he had often been heared to say,








<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
that, without a certain simplicity of heart,
this taste could not exist in any strong de∣gree.</P>
<P>The conversation was interrupted by a
violent uproar without, in which the voice
of the muleteer was heard above every other
sound. Valancourt started from his seat,
and went to enquire the occasion; but the
dispute continued so long afterwards, that
St. Aubert went himself, and found Michael
quarrelling with the hostess, because she had
refused to let his mules lie in a little room
where he and three of her sons were to pass
the night. The place was wretched enough,
but there was no other for these people to
sleep in; and, with somewhat more of deli∣cacy
than was usual among the inhabitants
of this wild tract of country, she persisted in
refusing to let the animals have the same
<HI>bed-chamber</HI> with her children. This was a
tender point with the muleteer; his honour
was wounded when his mules were treated
with disrespect, and he would have received
a blow, perhaps, with more meekness. He
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
declared that his beasts were as honest beasts,
and as good beasts, as any in the whole pro∣vince;
and that they had a right to be well
treated wherever they went. "They are
as harmless as lambs," said he, "if people
don't affront them. I never knew them be∣have
themselves amiss above once or twice
in my life, and then they had good reason
for doing so. Once, indeed, they kicked
at a boy's leg that lay asleep in the stable,
and broke it; but I told them they were out
there, and by Saint Anthony! I believe
they understood me, for they never did so
again."</P>
<P>He concluded this eloquent harangue
with protesting, that they should share with
him, go where he would.</P>
<P>The dispute was at length settled by Va∣lancourt,
who drew the hostess aside, and
desired she would let the muleteer and his
beasts have the place in question to them∣selves,
while her sons should have the bed
of skins designed for him, for that he would
wrap himself in his cloak, and sleep on the
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
bench by the cottage door. But this she
thought it her duty to oppose, and she felt
it to be her inclination to disappoint the
muleteer. Valancourt, however, was posi∣tive,
and the tedious affair was at length set∣tled.</P>
<P>It was late when St. Aubert and Emily
retired to their rooms, and Valancourt to his
station at the door, which, at this mild sea∣son,
he preferred to a close cabin and a bed
of skins. St. Aubert was somewhat surpris∣ed
to find in his room volumes of Homer,
Horace, and Petrarch; but the name of Va∣lancourt,
written in them, told him to whom
they belonged.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. Aubert awoke at an early hour, re∣freshed
by sleep, and desirous to set for∣ward.
He invited the stranger to break∣fast
with him; and, talking again of the
road, Valancourt said, that, some months
past, he had travelled as far as Beaujeu,
which was a town of some consequence on
the way to Rousillon. He recommended
it to St. Aubert to take that route, and the
latter determined to do so.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="100"/>
"The road from this hamlet," said Va∣lancourt,
"and that to Beaujeu, part at the
distance of about a league and an half from
hence; if you will give me leave, I will di∣rect
your muleteer so far. I must wander
somewhere, and your company would make
this a pleasanter ramble than any other I
could take."</P>
<P>St. Aubert thankfully accepted his of∣fer,
and they set out together, the young
stranger on foot, for he refused the invita∣tion
of St. Aubert to take a seat in his lit∣tle
carriage.</P>
<P>The road wound along the feet of the
mountains through a pastoral valley, bright
with verdure, and varied with groves of
dwarf oak, beech, and sycamore, under
whose branches herds of cattle reposed.
The mountain-ash too, and the weeping
birch, often threw their pendant foliage
over the steeps above, where the scanty soil
scarcely concealed their roots, and where
their light branches waved to every breeze
that fluttered from the mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101"/>
The travellers were frequently met at
this early hour, for the sun had not yet risen
upon the valley, by shepherds driving im∣mense
flocks from their folds to feed upon
the hills. St. Aubert had set out thus
early, not only that he might enjoy the first
appearance of sun-rise, but that he might
inhale the first pure breath of morning,
which above all things is refreshing to the
spirits of the invalid. In these regions it
was particularly so, where an abundance of
wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed
forth their essence on the air.</P>
<P>The dawn, which softened the scenery
with its peculiar grey tint, now dispersed,
and Emily watched the progress of the
day, first trembling on the tops of the
highest cliffs, then touching them with splen∣did
light, while their sides and the vale be∣low
were still wrapt in dewy mist. Mean∣while,
the sullen grey of the eastern clouds
began to blush, then to redden, and then to
glow with a thousand colours, till the
golden light darted over all the air, touched
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
the lower points of the mountain's brow,
and glanced in long sloping beams upon
the valley and its stream. All nature
seemed to have awakened from death into
life; the spirit of St. Aubert was reno∣vated.
His heart was full; hewept, and his
thoughts ascended to the Great Creator.</P>
<P>Emily wished to trip along the turf, so
green and bright with dew, and to taste the
full delight of that liberty, which the
izard seemed to enjoy as he bounded along
the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt
often stopped to speak with the travellers,
and with social feeling to point out to them
the peculiar objects of his admiration. St.
Aubert was pleased with him: "Here is
the real ingenuousness and ardour of
youth," said he to himself; "this young
man has never been at Paris."</P>
<P>He was sorry when they came to the spot
where the roads parted, and his heart took
a more affectionate leave of him than is
usual after so short an acquaintance. Va∣lancourt
talked long by the side of the car∣riage;
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
seemed more than once to be
going, but still lingered, and appeared to
search anxiously for topics of conversation
to account for his delay. At length he
took leave. As he went, St. Aubert ob∣served
him look with an earnest and pensive
eye at Emily, who bowed to him with a
countenance full of timid sweetness, while
the carriage drove on. St. Aubert, for what∣ever
reason, soon after looked from the
window, and saw Valancourt standing upon
the bank of the road, resting on his pike
with folded arms, and following the car∣riage
with his eyes. He waved his hand,
and Valancourt, seeming to awake from
his reverie, returned the salute, and started
away.</P>
<P>The aspect of the country now began
to change, and the travellers soon found
themselves among mountains covered from
their base nearly to their summits with
forests of gloomy pine, except where a
rock of granite shot up from the vale, and
lost its snowy top in the clouds. The ri∣vulte,
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
which had hitherto accompanied
them, now expanded into a river; and,
flowing deeply and silently along, reflected,
as in a mirror, the blackness of the im∣pending
shades. Sometimes a cliff was
seen lifting its bold head above the woods
and the vapours, that floated mid-way down
the mountains; and sometimes a face of
perpendicular marble rose from the water's
edge, over which the larch threw his gigan∣tic
arms, here scathed with lightning, and
there floating in luxuriant foliage.</P>
<P>They continued to travel over a rough
and unfrequented road, seeing now and
then at a distance the solitary shepherd,
with his dog, stalking along the valley,
and hearing only the dashing of torrents,
which the woods concealed from the eye,
the long sullen murmur of the breeze, as it
swept over the pines, or the notes of the ea∣gle
and the vulture, which were seen tow∣ering
round the beetling cliff.</P>
<P>Often, as the carriage moved slowly
over uneven ground, St. Aubert alighted,
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
and amused himself with examining the
curious plants that grew on the banks
of the road, and with which these re∣gions
abound; while Emily, wrapt in
high enthusiasm, wandered away under the
shades, listening in deep silence to the
lonely murmur of the woods.</P>
<P>Neither village nor hamlet was seen for
many leagues; the goat-herd's or the
hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of
the rocks, were the only human habitations
that appeared.</P>
<P>The travellers again took their dinner in
the open air, on a pleasant spot in the val∣ley,
under the spreading shade of cedars;
and then set forward towards Beaujeu.</P>
<P>The road now began to ascend, and,
leaving the pine forests behind, wound
among rocky precipices. The evening
twilight again fell over the scene, and
the travellers were ignorant how far they
might yet be from Beaujeu. St. Au∣bert,
however, conjectured that the distance
could not be very great, and comforted
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
himself with the prospect of travelling on a
more frequented road after reaching that
town, where he designed to pass the night.
Mingled woods, and rocks, and heathy
mountains were now seen obscurely through
the dusk; but soon even these imperfect
images faded in darkness. Michael pro∣ceeded
with caution, for he could scarcely
distinguish the road; his mules, however,
seemed to have more sagacity, and their
steps were sure.</P>
<P>On turning the angle of a mountain, a
light appeared at a distance, that illumi∣ned
the rocks, and the horizon to a great
extent. It was evidently a large fire, but
whether accidental, or otherwise, there
were no means of knowing. St. Aubert
thought it was probably kindled by some of
the numerous banditti, that infested the Py∣renées,
and he became watchful and anxious
to know whether the road passed near this
fire. He had arms with him, which, on an
emergency, might afford some protection,
though certainly a very unequal one, against
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
a band of robbers, so desperate too as those
usually were who haunted these wild re∣gions.
While many reflections rose upon
his mind, he heard a voice shouting
from the road behind, and ordering the
muleteer to stop. St. Aubert bade him
proceed as fast as possible; but either Mi∣chael,
or his mules were obstinate, for they
did not quit the old pace. Horses' feet were
now heard; a man rode up to the car∣riage,
still ordering the driver to stop; and
St. Aubert, who could no longer doubt
his purpose, was with difficulty able to
prepare a pistol for his defence, when his
hand was upon the door of the chaise.
The man staggered on his horse, the re∣port
of the pistol was followed by a groan,
and St. Aubert's horror may be imagined,
when in the next instant he thought he
heard the faint voice of Valancourt. He
now himself bade the muleteer stop; and,
pronouncing the name of Valancourt, was
answered in a voice, that no longer suffered
him to doubt. St. Aubert, who instantly
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
alighted and went to his assistance, found
him still sitting on his horse, but bleeding
profusely, and appearing to be in great
pain, though he endeavoured to soften the
terror of St. Aubert by assurances that he
was not materially hurt, the wound being
only in his arm. St. Aubert, with the
muleteer, assisted him to dismount, and he
sat down on the bank of the road, where
St. Aubert tried to bind up his arm, but his
hands trembled so excessively that he could
not accomplish it; and, Michael being now
gone in pursuit of the horse, which, on be∣ing
disengaged from his rider, had gal∣loped
off, he called Emily to his assistance.
Receiving no answer, he went to the car∣riage,
and found her sunk on the seat in a
fainting fit. Between the distress of this
circumstance and that of leaving Valan∣court
bleeding, he scarcely knew what he
did; he endeavoured, however, to raise
her, and called to Michael to fetch water
from the rivulet that flowed by the road,
but Michael was gone beyond the reach of
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
his voice. Valancourt, who heard these
calls, and also the repeated name of Emily,
instantly understood the subject of his dis∣tress
and, almost forgetting his own con∣dition,
he hastened to her relief. She was
reviving when he reached the carriage; and
then, understanding that anxiety for him had
occasioned her indisposition, he assured her,
in a voice that trembled, but not from an∣guish,
that his wound was of no conse∣quence.
While he said this St. Aubert
turned round, and perceiving that he was
still bleeding, the subject of his alarm
changed again, and he hastily formed some
handkerchiefs into a bandage. This stop∣ped
the effusion of the blood; but St. Au∣bert,
dreading the consequence of the
wound, enquired repeatedly how far they
were from Beaujeu; when, learning that it
was at two leagues distance, his distress in∣creased,
since he knew not how Valancourt,
in his present state, would bear the motion
of the carriage, and perceived that he was
already faint from loss of blood. When he
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
mentioned the subject of his anxiety, Va∣lancourt
entreated that he would not suffer
himself to be thus alarmed on his account,
for that he had no doubt he should be able
to support himself very well; and then he
talked of the accident as a slight one. The
muleteer being now returned with Valan∣court's
horse, assisted him into the chaise;
and, as Emily was now revived, they moved
slowly on towards Beaujeu.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, when he had recovered from
the terror occasioned him by this accident,
expressed surprise on seeing Valancourt,
who explained his unexpected appearance
by saying, "You, Sir, renewed my taste
for society; when you had left the hamlet,
it did indeed appear a solitude. I deter∣mined,
therefore, since my object was merely
amusement, to change the scene; and I took
this road, because I knew it led through a
more romantic tract of mountains than the
spot I have left. Besides," added he, hesi∣tating
for an instant, "I will own, and
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
why should I not? that I had some hope of
overtaking you."</P>
<P>"And I have made you a very unexpected
return for the compliment," said St. Au∣bert,
who lamented again the rashness
which had produced the accident, and ex∣plained
the cause of his late alarm. But
Valancourt seemed anxious only to remove
from the minds of his companions every un∣pleasant
feeling relative to himself; and, for
that purpose, still struggled against a sense
of pain, and tried to converse with gaiety.
Emily meanwhile was silent, except when
Valancourt particularly addressed her, and
there was at those times a tremulous tone
in his voice that spoke much.</P>
<P>They were now so near the fire, which had
long flamed at a distance on the blackness
of night, that it gleamed upon the road,
and they could distinguish figures moving
about the blaze. The way winding still
nearer, they perceived in the valley one of
those numerous bands of gipsies, which
at that period particularly haunted the
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
wilds of the Pyrenées, and lived partly by
plundering the traveller. Emily looked
with some degree of terror on the savage
countenances of these people, shewn by the
sire, which heightened the romantic effect
of the scenery, as it threw a red dusky gleam
upon the rocks and on the foliage of the
trees, leaving heavy masses of shade and
regions of obscurity, which the eye feared
to penetrate.</P>
<P>They were preparing their supper; a
large pot stood by the fire, over which se∣veral
figures were busy. The blaze disco∣vered
a rude kind of tent, round which
many children and dogs were playing, and
the whole formed a picture highly gro∣tesque.
The travellers saw plainly their
danger. Valancourt was silent, but laid
his hand on one of St. Aubert's pistols;
St. Aubert drew forth another, and Mi∣chael
was ordered to proceed as fast as pos∣sible.
They passed the place, however,
without being attacked; the rovers being
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
probably unprepared for the opportunity,
and too busy about their supper to feel
much interest, at the moment, in any thing
besides.</P>
<P>After a league and a half more, passed
in darkness, the travellers arrived at Beaujeu,
and drove up to the only inn the place af∣forded;
which, though superior to any they
had seen since they entered the mountains,
was bad enough.</P>
<P>The surgeon of the town was immedi∣ately
sent for, if a surgeon he could be
called, who prescribed for horses as well as
for men, and shaved faces at least as dexte∣rously
as he set bones. After examining
Valancourt's arm, and perceiving that the
bullet had passed through the flesh without
touching the bone, he dressed it, and left
him with a solemn prescription of quiet,
which his patient was not inclined to obey
The delight of ease had now succeeded to
pain; for ease may be allowed to assume
a positive quality when contrasted with
anguish; and, his spirits thus re-animated,
<PB N="104" REF="114"/>

<PB N="108" REF="118"/>
he wished to partake of the conversation of
St. Aubert and Emily, who, released from
so many apprehensions, were uncommonly
cheerful. Late as it was, however, St.
Aubert was obliged to go out with the
landlord to buy meat for supper; and
Emily, who, during this interval, had been
absent as long as she could, upon excuses of
looking to their accommodation, which she
found rather better than she expected, was
compelled to return, and converse with
Valancourt alone. They talked of the
character of the scenes they had passed, of
the natural history of the country, of poetry,
and of St. Aubert; a subject on which
Emily always spoke and listened to with
peculiar pleasure.</P>
<P>The travellers passed an agreeable even∣ing,
but St. Aubert was fatigued with his
journey; and, as Valancourt seemed again
sensible of pain, they separated soon after
supper.</P>
<P>In the morning St. Aubert found that
Valancourt had passed, a restless night;
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
that he was feverish, and his wound very
painful. The surgeon, when he dressed it,
advised him to remain quietly at Beaujeu;
advice which was too reasonable to be re∣jected.
St. Aubert, however, had no fa∣vourable
opinion of this practitioner, and
was anxious to commit Valancourt into
more skilful hands; but learning, upon en∣quiry,
that there was no town within several
leagues which seemed more likely to afford
better advice, he altered the plan of, his
journey, and determined to await the reco∣very
of Valancourt, who, with somewhat
more ceremony than, sincerity, made, many
objections to this delay.</P>
<P>By order of his furgeon, Valancourt did
not go out of the house that day; but St.
Aubert and Emily surveyed with delight
the environs of the town, situated at the feet
of the Pyrenean Alps, that rose, some in
abrupt precipices, and others swelling with,
woods of cedar, sir, and cypress, which
stretched nearly to their, highest summits.
The cheerful green of the beech and
<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
mountain-ash was sometimes seen, like a
gleam of light, amidst the dark verdure of
the forest; and sometimes a torrent poured
its sparkling flood, high among the woods.</P>
<P>Valancourt's indisposition detained the
travellers at Beaujeu several days, during
which interval St. Aubert had observed his
disposition and his talents with the philoso∣phic
enquiry so natural to him. He saw a
frank and generous nature, full of ardour,
highly susceptible of whatever is grand and
beautiful, but impetuous, wild, and some∣what
romantic. Valancourt had known
little of the world. His perceptions were
clear, and his feelings just; his indigna∣nation
of an unworthy, or his admiration of
a generous action, were expressed in terms
of equal vehemence. St. Aubert sometimes
smiled at his warmth, but seldom checked it,
and often repeated to himself, "This young
man has never been at Paris." A sigh some∣times
followed this silent ejaculation. He
determined not to leave Valancourt till he
should be perfectly recovered; and, as he was
<PB N="111" REF="121"/>
now well enough to travel, though not able
to manage his horse, St. Aubert invited
him to accompany him for a few days in the
carriage. This he the more readily did,
since he had discovered that Valancourt
was of a family of the same name in Gas∣cony,
with whose respectability he was well
acquainted. The latter accepted the offer
with great pleasure, and they again set
forward among these romantic wilds to∣wards
Rousillon.</P>
<P>They travelled leisurely; stopping where∣ever
a scene uncommonly grand appeared;
frequently alighting to walk to an emi∣nence,
whither the mules could not go,
from which the prospect opened in greater
magnificence; and often sauntering over
hillocks covered with lavender, wild thyme,
juniper, and tamarisc; and under the
shades of woods, between whose boles they
caught the long mountain-vista, sublime
beyond any thing that Emily had ever ima∣gined.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="122"/>
St. Aubert sometimes amused himself
with botanizing, while Valancourt and
Emily strolled on; he pointing out to her
notice the objects that particularly charmed
him, and reciting beautiful passages from
such of the Latin and Italian poets as he
had heard her admire. In the pauses of
conversation, when he thought himself not
observed, he frequently fixed his eyes pen∣sively
on her countenance, which expressed
with so much animation the taste and energy
of her mind; and when he spoke again,
there was a peculiar tenderness in the tone
of his voice, that defeated any attempt to
conceal his sentiments. By degrees these
silent pauses became more frequent; till
Emily, only, betrayed an anxiety to inter∣rupt
them; and she, who had been hitherto
reserved, would now talk again, and again,
of the woods and the vallies and the
mountains, to avoid the danger of sympa∣thy
and silence.</P>
<P>From Beaujeu the road had constantly
ascended, conducting the travellers into the
<PB N="113" REF="123"/>
higher regions of the air, where immense
glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors, and
eternal snow whitened the summits of the
mountains. They often paused to contem∣plate
these stupendous scenes, and, seated on
some wild cliff, where only the ilex or the
larch could flourish, looked over dark
forests of fir, and precipices where human
foot had never wandered, into the glen—so
deep, that the thunder of the torrent,
which was seen to foam along the bottom,
was scarcely heard to murmur. Over these
crags rose others of stupendous height,
and fantastic shape; some shooting into
cones; others impending far over their
base, in huge masses of granite, along
whose broken ridges was often lodged a
weight of snow, that, trembling even to the
vibration of a found, threatened to bear de∣struction
in its course to the vale. Around,
on every side, far as the eye could penetrate,
were seen only forms of grandeur—the
long perspective of mountain tops, tinged
with ethereal blue, or white with snow;
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
vallies of ice, and forests of gloomy fir.
The serenity and clearness of the air in
These high regions were particularly de∣lightful
to the travellers; it seemed to in∣spire
them with a finer spirit, and diffused
an indescribable complacency over their
minds. They had no words to ex∣press
the sublime emotions they felt. A so∣lemn
expression characterized the feelings of
St. Aubert; tears often came to his eyes,
and he frequently walked away from his
companions. Valancourt now and then
spoke, to point to Emily's notice some fea∣ture
of the scene. The thinness of the at∣mosphere,
through which every object
came so distinctly to the eye, surprised and
deluded her; who could scarcely believe
that objects, which appeared so near, were,
in reality, so distant. The deep silence of
these solitudes was broken only at intervals
by the scream of the vultures, seen cowering
round some cliff below, or by the cry of
the eagle sailing high in the air; except
when the travellers listened to the hollow
<PB N="115" REF="125"/>
thunder that sometimes muttered at their
feet. While, above, the deep blue of the
heavens was unobscured by the lightest
cloud, half way down the mountains, long
billows of vapour were frequently seen roll∣ing,
now wholly excluding the country be∣low,
and now opening, and partially reveal∣ing
its features. Emily delighted to observe
the grandeur of these clouds as they
changed in shape and tints, and to watch
their various effect on the lower world,
whose features, partly veiled, were continu∣ally
assuming new forms of sublimity.</P>
<P>After traversing these regions for many
leagues, they began to descend towards
Rousillon, and features of beauty then min∣gled
with the scene. Yet the travellers did
not look back without some regret to the
sublime objects they had quitted; though
the eye, fatigued with the extension of its
powers, was glad to repose on the verdure
of woods and pastures, that now hung on
the margin of the river below; to view
again the humble cottage shaded by cedars,
<PB N="116" REF="126"/>
the playful group of mountaineer-children,
and the flowery nooks that appeared among
the hills.</P>
<P>As they descended, they saw at a distance,
on the right, one of the grand passes of the
Pyreneáes into Spain, gleaming with its bat∣tlements
and towers to the splendour of the
setting rays, yellow tops of woods colouring
the steeps below, while far above aspired the
snowy points of the mountains, still reflect∣ing
a rosy hue.</P>
<P>St. Aubert began to look out for the lit∣tle
town he had been directed to by the
people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to
pass the night; but no habitation yet ap∣peared.
Of its distance Valancourt could
not assist him to judge, for he had never
been so far along this chain of Alps before.
There was, however, a road to guide them;
and there could be little doubt that it was
the right one; for, since they had left
Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks
to perplex or mislead.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="127"/>
The sun now gave his last light, and St.
Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with all
Possible dispatch. He found, indeed, the
lassitude of iliness return upon him, af∣ter
a day of uncommon fatigue, both of
body and mind, and he longed for re∣pose.
His anxiety was not soothed by
Observing a numerous train, consisting of
men, horses, and loaded mules, winding
down the steeps of an opposite mountain,
appearing and disappearing at intervals
among the woods, so that its numbers could
not be judged of. Something bright, like
arms, glanced in the setting ray, and the
military dress was distinguishable upon the
men who were in the van, and on others
scattered among the troop that followed.
As these wound into the vale, the rear of
the party emerged from the woods, and ex∣habited
a band of soldiers. St. Aubert's
apprehendsions now subsided; he had no
doubt that the train before him consisted of
smugglers, who, in conveying prohibited
<PB N="118" REF="128"/>
goods over the Pyrenées, had been encoun∣tered,
and conquered by a party of troops.</P>
<P>The travellers had lingered so long among
the sublimer scenes of these mountains,
that they found themselves entirely mista∣ken
in their calculation that they could reach
Montigny at sun-set; but, as they wound
along the valley, they saw, on a rude
Alpine bridge, that united two lofty crags
of the glen, a group of mountaineer-children,
amusing themselves with dropping
pebbles into a torrent below, and watching
the stones plunge into the water, that threw
up its white spray high in the air as it received
them, and returned a sullen found, which
the echoes of the mountains prolonged.
Under the bridge was seen a perspective of
the valley, with its cataract descending
among the rocks, and a cottage on a cliff,
overshadowed with pines. It appeared,
that they could not be far from some small
town. St. Aubert bade the muleteer stop,
and then called to the children to enquire
<PB N="119" REF="129"/>
if he was near Montigny; but the distance,
and the roaring of the waters, would not
suffer his voice to be heard; and the crags,
adjoining the bridge, were of such tremen∣dous
height and steepness, that to have
climbed either would have been scarcely
practicable to a person unacquainted with
the ascent. St. Aubert, therefore, did not
waste more moments in delay. They con∣tinued
to travel long after twilight had ob∣scured
the road, which was so broken, that,
now thinking it safer to walk than to ride,
they all alighted. The moon was rising, but
her light was yet too feeble to assist them.
While they stepped carefully on, they heard
the vesper-bell of a convent. The twilight
would not permit them to distinguish any
thing like a building, but the sounds seemed
to come from some woods, that overhung
an acclivity to the right. Valancourt pro∣posed
to go in search of this convent. "If
they will not accommodate us with a night's
lodging," said he, "they may certainly
<PB N="120" REF="130"/>
inform us how far we are from Montigny,
and direct us towards it." He was bound∣ing
forward, without waiting St. Aubert's
reply, when the latter stopped him. "I
am very weary," said St. Aubert, "and
wish for nothing so much as for immediate
rest. We will all go to the convent; your
good looks would defeat our purpose; but
when they see mine and Emily's exhausted
countenances, they will scarcely deny us
repose."</P>
<P>As he said this, he took Emily's arm
within his, and, telling Michael to wait a
while in the road with the carriage, they be∣gan
to ascend towards the woods, guided
by the bell of the convent. His steps
were feeble, and Valancourt offered him his
arm, which he accepted. The moon now
threw a faint light over their path, and,
soon after, enabled them to distinguish some
towers rising above the tops of the woods.
Still following the note of the bell, they en∣tered
the shade of those woods, lighted
only by the moon-beams, that glided down
<PB N="121" REF="131"/>
between the leaves, and threw a tremulous
uncertain gleam upon the steep track they
were winding. The gloom and the silence
that prevailed, except when the bell re∣turned
upon the air, together with the wild∣ness
of the surrounding scene, struck Emily
with a degree of fear, which, however, the
voice and conversation of Valancourt some∣what
repressed. When they had been some
time ascending, St. Aubert complained of
wearinss, and they stopped to rest upon a
little green summit, where the trees opened,
and admitted the moon-light. He fat down
upon the turf, between Emily and Valan∣court.
The bell had now ceased, and the
deep repose of the scene was undisturbed
by any found, for the low dull murmur
of some distant torrents might be said to
sooth, rather than to interrupt, the si∣lence.</P>
<P>Before them, extended the valley they
had quitted; its rocks, and woods to the
left, just silvered by the rays, formed a con∣trast
to the deep shadow, that involved the
<PB N="122" REF="132"/>
opposite cliffs, whose fringed summits only
were tipped with light; while the distant
perspective of the valley was lost in the yel∣low
mist of moon-light. The travellers sat
for some time wrapt in the complacency
which such scenes inspire.</P>
<P>"Thefe scenes," said Valancourt, at length,
"soften the heart, like the notes of sweet
music, and inspire that delicious melancholy
which no person, who had felt it once, would
resign for the gayest pleasures. They waken
our best and purest feelings, disposing us to
benevolence, pity, and friendship. Those
whom I love—I always seem to love more
in such an hour as this." His voice trem∣bled,
and he paused.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was silent; Emily perceived a
warm tear fall upon the hand he held; she
knew the object of his thoughts; hers too
had, for some time, been occupied by the
remembrance of her mother. He seemed
by an effort to rouse himfelf. "Yes," said
he, with an half-supperssed sigh, "the me∣mory
of those we love—of times for ever
<PB N="123" REF="133"/>
past! in such an hour as this steals upon
the mind, like a strain of distant music in
the stillness of night;—all tender and har∣monious
as this landscape, sleeping in the
mellow moon-light." After the pause of
a moment, St. Aubert added, "I have al∣ways
fancied, that I thought with more
clearness, and precision, at such an hour than
at any other, and that heart must be insen∣sible
in a great degree, that does not soften
to its influence. But many such there are."</P>
<P>Valancourt sighed.</P>
<P>"Are there, indeed, many such?" said
Emily.</P>
<P>"A few years hence, my Emily," re∣plied
St. Aubert, "and you may smile at
the recollection of that question—if you do
not weep to it. But come, I am somewhat
refreshed, let us proceed."</P>
<P>Having emerged from the woods, they
few, upon a turfy hillock above, the con∣vent
of which they were in search. An high
wall, that surrounded it, led them to an an∣cient
gate, at which they knocked; and the
<PB N="124" REF="134"/>
poor monk, who opened it, conduced them
into a small adjoining room, where he de∣sired
they would wait while he informed the
superior of their request. In this interval,
several friars came in separately to look at
them; and at length the first monk return∣ed,
and they followed him to a room, where
the superior was sitting in an arm chair,
with a large folio volume, printed in black
letter, open on a desk before him. He re∣ceived
them with courtesy, though he did
not rise from his feat; and, having asked
them a few questions, grafted their request.
After a short conversation, formal and so∣lemn
on the part of the superior, they with∣drew
to the apartment where they were to
sup, and Valancourt, whom one of the in∣ferior
friars civilly desired to accompany,
went to seek Michael and his mules. They
had not descended half way down the cliffs,
before they heard the voice of the muleteer
echoing far and wide. Sometimes he called
on St. Aubert, and sometimes on Valan∣court,
who having, at length, convinced him
<PB N="125" REF="135"/>
that he had nothing to fear either for him∣self,
or his master; and having disposed of
him, for the night, in a cottage on the skirt
of the woods, returned to sup with his friends,
on such sober fare as the monks thought it
prudent to set before them. While St. Au∣bert
was too much indisposed to share it,
Emily, in her anxiety for her father, forgot
herself; and Valancourt, silent and thought∣ful,
yet never inattentive to them, appear∣ed
particularly solicitous to accommodate
and relieve St. Aubert, who often observ∣ed,
while his daughter was pressing him to
eat, or adjusting the pillow she had placed
in the back of his arm-chair, that Valan∣court
fixed on her a look of pensive tender∣ness,
which he was not displeased to under∣stand.</P>
<P>They separated at an early hour, and re∣tired
to their respective apartments. Emi∣ly
was shown to hers by a nun of the con∣vent,
whom she was glad to dismiss, for
her heart was melancholy, and her attention
so much abstracted, that conversation with
<PB N="126" REF="136"/>
a stranger was painful. She thought her
father daily declining, and attributed his
present fatigue more to the feeble state of
his frame, than to the difficulty of the jour∣ney.
A train of gloomy ideas haunted her
mind, till she fell asleep.</P>
<P>In about two hours after, she was awaken∣ed
by the chiming of a bell, and then heard
quick steps pass along the gallery, into
which her chamber opened. She was so lit∣tle
accustomed to the manners of a convent,
as to be alarmed by this circumstance; her
fears, ever alive for her father, suggested
that he was very ill, and she rose in haste
to go to him. Having paused, however, to
let the persons in the gallery pass before
she opened her door, her thoughts, in the
mean time, recovered from the confusion
of sleep, and she understood that the bell
was the call of the monks to prayers. It
had now ceased, and, all being again still, she
forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Her
mind was not disposed for immediate sleep,
and the moon-light, that shone into her
<PB N="127" REF="137"/>
chamber, invited her to open the casement,
and look out upon the country.</P>
<P>It was a still and beautiful night, the sky
was unobscured by any cloud, and scarce a
leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the
air. As she listened, the mid-night hymn
of the monks rose softly from a chapel,
that stood on one of the lower cliffs, an
holy strain, that seemed to ascend through
the silence of night to heaven, and her
thoughts ascended with it. From the con∣sideration
of his works, her mind arose to
the adoration of the Deity, in his goodness
and power; wherever she turned her view,
whether on the sleeping earth, or to the vast
regions of space, glowing with worlds be∣yond
the reach of human thought, the sublimity
of God, and the majesty of his presence
appeared. Her eyes were filled with tears
of awful love and admiration; and she felt
that pure devotion, superior to all the dis∣tinctions
of human system, which lifts the
soul above this world, and seems to expand
it into a nobler nature; such devotion as
<PB N="128" REF="138"/>
can, perhaps, only be experienced, when
the mind, rescued, for a moment, from the
humbleness of earthly considerations, as∣pires
to contemplate His power in the subli∣mity
of His works, and His goodness in the
infinity of His blessings.</P>
<Q><L>—Is it not now the hour,</L>
<L>The holy hour, when to the cloudless height.</L>
<L>Of yon starred concave climbs the full-orbed moon,</L>
<L>And to this nether world in solemn stillness</L>
<L>Gives sign, that to the listning ear of Heaven</L>
<L>Religion's voice should plead? The very babe</L>
<L>Knows this, and, 'chance awak'd, his little hands</L>
<L>Lifts to the gods, and on his innocent couch</L>
<L>Calls down a blessing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CARACTACUS.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>The midnight chant of the monks soon
after dropped into silence; but Emily re∣mained
at the casement, watching the set∣ting
moon, and the valley sinking into deep
shade, and willing to prolong her present
state of mind. At length she retired to
her matterss, and sunk into tranquil slumber.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>St. AUBERT, sufficiently restored by a
night's repose to pursue his journey, set out
in the morning, with his family and Valan∣court,
for Rousillon, which he hoped to
reach before night-fall. The scenes, through
which they now passed, were as wild and
romantic, as any they had yet observed, with
this difference, that beauty, every now and
then, softened the landscape into smiles.
Little woody recesses appeared among the
mountains, covered with bright verdure
and flowers; or a pastoral valley, opened its
grassy bosom in the shade of the cliffs, with
flocks and herds loitering along the banks
<PB N="130" REF="140"/>
of a rivulet, that refreshed it with perpetual
green. St. Aubert could not repent the
having taken this fatiguing road, though
he was this day, also, frequently obliged to
alight, to walk along the rugged precipice,
and to climb the steep and flinty mountain.
The wonderful sublimity and variety of the
Prospects repaid him for all this, and the en∣thusiasm,
with which they were viewed by
his young companions, heightened his own,
and awakened a remembrance of all the de∣lightful
emotions of his early days, when
the sublime charms of nature were first un∣veiled
to him. He found great pleasure in
conversing with Valancourt, and in listening
to his ingenuous remarks. The fire and
simplicity of his manners seemed to render
him a characteristic figure in the scenes
around them; and St. Aubert discovered in
his sentiments the justness and the dignity
of an elevated mind, unbiassed by inter∣course
with the world. He perceived, that
his opinions were formed, rather than im∣bibed;
were more the result of thought,
<PB N="131" REF="141"/>
than of learning. Of the world he seemed
to know nothing; for he believed well of
all mankind, and this opinion gave him the
reflected image of his own heart.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, as he sometimes lingered
to examine the wild plants in his path, often
looked forward with pleasure to Emily and
Valancourt, as they strolled on together; he,
with a countenance of animated delight,
pointing to her attention some grand sea∣ture
of the scene; and she, listening and ob∣serving
with a look of tender seriousness,
that spoke the elevation of her mind. They
appeared like two lovers who had never
strayed beyond these their native mountains;
whose situation had secluded them from the
frivolities of common life, whose ideas were
simple and grand, like the landscapes among
which they moved, and who knew no other
happiness, than in the union of pure and af∣fectionate
hearts. St. Aubert smiled, and
sighed at the romantic picture of felicity his
fancy drew; and sighed again to think, that
nature and simplicity were so little known
<PB N="132" REF="142"/>
to the world, as that their pleasures were
thought romantic.</P>
<P>"The world," said he, pursuing this train
of thought, "ridicules a passion which it
seldom feels; its scenes, and its interests, dis∣tract
the mind, deprave the taste, corrupt
the heart, and love cannot exist in a heart
that has lost the meek dignity of innocence,
Virtue and taste are nearly the lame, for
virtue is little more than active taste, and
the most delicate affections of each com∣bine
in real love. How then are we to look
for love in great cities, where selfishness,
dissipation, and insincerity supply the place
of tenderness, simplicity and truth?"</P>
<P>It was near noon, when the travellers,
having arrived at a piece of steep and dan∣gerous
road, alighted to walk. The road
wound up an ascent, that was clothed with
wood, and, instead of following the carriage,
they entered the refreshing. shade. A dewy
coolness was diffused upon the air, which,
with the bright verdure of turf, that grew
under the trees, the mingled fragrance of
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
flowers and of balm, thyme, and lavender,
that enriched it, and the grandeur of the
pines, beech, and chesnuts, that overshadow∣ed
them, rendered this amost delicious re∣treat.
Sometimes, the thick foliage exclud∣ed
all view of the country; at others, it ad∣mitted
some partial catches of the distant
seenery, which gave hints to the imagina∣tion
to picture, landscapes more interesting,
more impressive, than any that had been
presented to the eye. The wanderers often
lingered to indulge in these reveries of fancy.</P>
<P>The pauses of silence, such as had former∣ly
interrupted the conversations of Valan∣court
and Emily, were more frequent to∣day
than ever. Valancourt often dropped
suddenly from the most animating vivacity
into fits of deep musing, and there was,
sometimes, an unaffected melancholy in his
smile, which Emily could not avoid under∣standing,
for her heart was interested in the
sentiment it spoke.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was refreshed by the shades,
and they continued to saunter under them,
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
following, as nearly as they could guess,
the direction of the road, till they perceived
that they had totally lost it. They had con∣tinue
I near the brow of the precipice, allur∣ed
by the scenery it exhibited, while the road
wound far away over the cliff above. Va∣lancourt
called loudly to Michael, but heard
no voice, except his own, echoing among
the rocks, and his various efforts to re∣gain
the road were equally unsuccessful.
While they were thus circumstanced, they
perceived a shepherd's cabin, between the
boles of the trees at some distance, and Va∣lancourt
bounded on first to ask assistance.
When he reached it, he saw only two little
children, at play, on the turf before the door.
He looked into the hut, but no person was
there, and the, eldest of the boys told him
that their father was with his slocks, and
their mother was gone down into the vale,
but would be back presently. As he stood,
considering what was further to be done, on
a sudden he heard Michael's voice roaring
forth most manfully among the cliffs above,
<PB N="135" REF="145"/>
till he made their echoes ring. Valancourt
immediately answered the call, and endea∣voured
to make his way through the thicket
that clothed the steeps, following the di∣rection
of the sound. After much struggle
over brambles and precipices, he reached
Michael, and at length prevailed with him
to be silent, and to listen to him. The road
was at a considerable distance from the spot
where St. Aubert and Emily were; the car∣riage
could not easily return to the entrance
of the wood, and, since it would be very fa∣tiguing
for St. Aubert to climb the long
and steep road to the place where it now
stood, Valancourt was anxious to find a
more easy ascent, by the way he had him∣self
passed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily ap∣proached
the cottage, and rested themselves
on a rustic bench, sastened between two
pines, which overshadowed it, till Valan∣court,
whose steps they had observed, should
return.</P>
<P>The eldest of the children desisted from
<PB N="136" REF="146"/>
his play, and stood still to observe the
strangers, while the younger continued his
little gambols, and teased his brother to join
in them. St. Aubert looked with pleasure
upon this picture of infantine simplicity,
till it brought to his remembrance his own
boys, whom he had lost about the age of
these, and their lamented, mother; and he
sunk into a thoughtfulness, which Emily
observing, she immediately began to sing
one of those simple and lively airs he was so
fond of, and which she knew how to give
with the most captivating sweetness St.
Aubert smiled on her through his tears,
took her hand and pressed it affectionately,
and then tried to dissipate the melancholy
reflections that lingered in his mind.</P>
<P>While she sung, Valancourt approached,
who was unwilling to interrupt her, and
paused at a little distance to listen. When
she had concluded, he joined the party, and
told them, that he had found Michael, as
well as a way, by which he thought they
could ascend the cliff to the carriage. He
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
pointed to the woody steeps above, which
St. Aubert surveyed with an anxious eye.
He was already wearied by his walk, and
this ascent was formidable to him. He
thought, however, it would be less toilsome
than the long and broken road, and he de∣termined
to attempt it; but Emily, ever
watchful of his ease, proposing that he should
rest, and dine before they proceeded further,
Valancourt went to the carriage for the re∣freshments
deposited there.</P>
<P>On his return, he proposed removing a
little higher up the mountain, to where the
woods opened upon a grand and extensive
prospect; and thither they were preparing to
go, when they saw a young woman join the
children, and caress and weep over them.</P>
<P>The travellers, interested by her distress,
stopped to observe her. She took the young∣est
of the children in her arms, and, perceiv∣ing
the strangers, hastily dried her tears, and
proceeded to the cottage, St. Aubert, on en∣quiring
the occasion of her sorrow, learned
that her husband, who was shepherd, and
<PB N="138" REF="148"/>
lived here in the summer months to watch
over the flocks he led to feed upon these
mountains, had lost, on the preceding
night, his little all. A gang of gipsies,
who had for some time infested the neigh∣bourhood,
had driven away several of his
matter's sheep. "Jacques," added the shep∣herd's
wife, "had saved a little money, and
had bought a few sheep with it, and now
they must go to his master for those that are
stolen; and what is worse than all, his mas∣ter,
when he comes to know how it is, will
trust him no longer with the care of his
flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what
is to become of our children!"</P>
<P>The innocent countenance of the woman,
and the simplicity of her manner in relating
her grievance, inclined St. Aubert to believe
her story; and Valancourt, convinced that
it was true, asked eagerly what was the va∣lue
of the stolen sheep, on hearing which he
turned away with a look of disappointment,
St. Aubert put some money into her hand,
Emily too gave something from her little
<PB N="139" REF="149"/>
purse, and they walked towards the cliff;
but Valancourt lingered behind, and spoke
to the shepherd's wife, who was now weep∣ing
with gratitude and surprise. He en∣quired
how much money was yet wanting
to replace the stolen sheep, and found, that
it was a sum very little short of all he had
about him. He was perplexed and distress∣ed.
"This sum then," said he to himself,
"would make this poor family completely
happy—it is in my power to give it—to
make them completely happy! But what
is to become of me?—how shall I contrive
to reach home with the little money that
will remain?" For a moment he stood,
unwilling to forego the luxury of raising a
family from ruin to happiness, yet con∣sidering
the difficulties of pursuing his
journey with so small a sum as would be
left.</P>
<P>While he was in this state of perplexity,
the shepherd himself appeared: his children
ran to meet him; he took one of them in
his arms, and, with the other clinging to
<PB N="140" REF="150"/>
his coat, came forward with a loitering step.
His forlorn and melancholy look determin∣ed
Valancourt at once; he threw down all
the money he had, except a very few louis,
and bounded away after St. Aubert and
Emily, who were proceeding slowly up the
steep. Valancourt had seldom felt his heart
so light as at this moment; his gay spirits
danced with pleasure; every object around
him appeared more interesting, or beautiful,
than before. St. Aubert observed the un∣common
vivacity of his countenance:
"What has pleased you so much?" said he.
"O what a lovely day," replied Valancourt,
"how brightly the sun shines, how pure is
this air, what enchanting scenery!" "It
is indeed enchanting," said St. Aubert,
whom early experience had taught to under∣stand
the nature of Valancourt's present
feelings. "What pity that the wealthy,
who can command such sunshine, should
ever pass their days in gloom—in the cold
shade of selfishness! For you, my young
friend, may the sun always shine as bright∣ly
<PB N="141" REF="151"/>
as at this moment; may your own con∣duct
always give you the sunshine of bene∣volence
and reason united!"</P>
<P>Valancóurt, highly flattered by this com∣pliment,
could make no reply but by a smile
of gratitude.</P>
<P>They continued to wind under the woods,
between the grassy knolls of the mountain, and,
as they reached the shady summit, which he
had pointed out, the whole party burst in∣to
an exclamation. Behind the spot where
they stood, the rock rose perpendicularly in
a massy wall to a considerable height, and
then branched out into overhanging crags.
Their grey tints were well contrasted by the
bright hues of the plants and wild flowers,
that grew in their fractured sides, and were
deepened by the gloom of the pines and cedars,
that waved above. The steeps below, over
which the eye passed abruptly to the valley,
were fringed with thickets of alpine shrubs;
and, lower still, appeared the tufted tops of
the chesnut woods, that clothed their base,
among which peeped forth the shepherd's
<PB N="142" REF="152"/>
cottage, just left by the travellers, with its
blueish smoke curling high in the air. On
every side appeared the majestic summits
of the Pyrenées, some exhibiting tremen∣dous
crags of marble, whose appearance was
changing every instant, as the varying lights
fell upon their surface; others, still high∣er,
displaying only snowy points, while
their lower steeps were covered almost in∣variably
with forests of pine, larch, and oak,
that stretched down to the vale. This was
one of the narrow vallies, that open from the
Pyrenées into the country of Rousillon, and
whose green pastures, and cultivated beauty,
form a decided and wonderful contrast to
the romantic grandeur that environs it.
Through a vista of the mountains appear∣ed
the lowlands of Rousillon, tinted with
the blue haze of distance, as they united with
the waters of the Mediterranean; where, on
a promontory, which marked the boundary
of the shore, stood a lonely beacon, over
which were seen circling flights of sea-fowl.
Beyond, appeared, now and then, a stealing
<PB N="143" REF="153"/>
sail, white with the sun-beam, and whose
progress was perceivable by its approach to
the light-house. Sometimes, too, was seen
a sail so distant, that it served only to mark
the line of separation between the sky and
the waves.</P>
<P>On the other side of the valley, imme∣diately,
opposite to the spot where the tra∣vellers
rested, a rocky pass opened toward
Gascony. Here no sign of cultivation ap∣peared.
The rocks of granite, that screen∣ed
the glen, rose abruptly from their base,
and stretched their barren points to the
clouds, unvaried with woods, and uncheered
even by a hunter's cabin. Sometimes, indeed,
a gigantic larch threw its long shade over the
precipice, and here and there a cliff rear∣ed
on its brow a monumental cross, to tell
the traveller the fate of him who had ventur∣ed
thither before. This spot seemed the very
haunt of banditti; and Emily, as she look∣ed
down upon it, almost expected to see them
stealing out from some hollow cave to look
for their prey. Soon after an object not less
<PB N="144" REF="154"/>
terrific struck her,—a gibbet standing on a
point of rock near the entrance of the pass,
and immediately over one of the crosses she
had before observed. These were hiero∣glyphics
that told a plain arid dreadful
story. She forbore to point it out to St.
Aubert, but it threw a gloom over her spi∣rits,
and made her anxious to hasten for∣ward,
that they might with certainty
reach Rousillon before night-fall. It was
necessary, however, that St. Aubert should
take some refreshment, and, seating them∣selves
on the short dry turf, they opened the
basket of provisions, while</P>
<Q><L>—by breezy murmurs cool'd,</L>
<L>Broad o'er <HI>their</HI> heads the verdant cedars wave,</L>
<L>And high palmetos lift their graceful shade.</L>
<L>—<HI>they</HI> draw</L>
<L>Ethereal soul, there drink reviving gales</L>
<L>Profusely breathing from the piney groves,</L>
<L>And vales of fragrance; there at distance hear</L>
<L>The roaring floods, and cataracts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THOMPSON.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>St. Aubert was revived by rest, and by
the serene air of this summit; and Valan∣court
<PB N="145" REF="155"/>
was so charmed with all around, and
with the conversation of his companions,
that he seemed to have forgotten he had
any further to go. Having concluded their
simple repast, they gave a long farewell look
to the scene, and again began to ascend.
St. Aubert rejoiced when he reached the
carriage, which Emily entered with him;
but Valancourt, willing to take a more ex∣tensive
view of the enchanting country, in∣to
which they were about to descend, than
he could do from a carriage, loosened his
dogs, and once more bounded with them
along the banks of the road. He often
quitted it for points that promised a wider
prospect, and the slow pace, at which the
mules travelled, allowed him to overtake
them with ease. Whenever a scene of un∣common
magnificence appeared, he hasten∣ed
to inform St. Aubert, who, though he
was too much tired to walk himself, some∣times
made the chaise wait, while Emily
went to the neighbouring cliff.</P>
<P>It was evening when they descended the
<PB N="146" REF="156"/>
lower alps, that bind Rousillon, and form a
majestic barrier round that charming coun∣try,
leaving it open only on the east to the
Mediterranean. The gay tints of cultiva∣tion
once more beautified the landscape;
for the lowlands were coloured with the
richest hues, which a luxuriant climate, and
an industrious people can awaken into life.
Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the
air, their ripe fruit glowing among the fo∣liage;
while, sloping to the plains, exten∣sive
vineyards spread their treasures. Be∣yond
these, woods and pastures, and min∣gled
towns and hamlets stretched towards
the sea, on whose bright surface gleamed
many a distant sail; while, over the whole
scene, was diffused the purple glow of even∣ing.
This landscape with the surrounding
alps did, indeed, present a perfect picture
of the lovely and the sublime, of "beauty
sleeping in the lap of horror."</P>
<P>The travellers, having reached the plains,
proceeded, between hedges of flowering
myrtle and pomegranate, to the town of
<PB N="147" REF="157"/>
Arles, where they purposed to rest for the
night. They met with simple, but neat ac∣commodation,
and would have passed an
happy evening, after the toils and the de∣lights
of this day, had not the approaching
separation thrown a gloom over their spi∣rits.
It was St. Aubert's plan to proceed,
on the morrow, to the borders of the Me∣diterranean,
and travel along its shores
into Languedoc; and Valancourt, since he
was now nearly recovered, and had no longer
a pretence for continuing with his new
friends, resolved to leave them here. St.
Aubert, who was much pleased with him,
invited him to go further, but did not re∣peat
the invitation, and Valancourt had re∣solution
enough to forego the temptation
of accepting it, that he might prove him∣self
not unworthy of the favour. On the
following morning, therefore, they were to
part, St. Aubert to pursue his way to Lan∣guedoc,
and Valancourt to explore new
scenes among the mountains, on his return
home. During this evening he was often
<PB N="148" REF="158"/>
silent and thoughtful; St. Aubert's manner
towards him was affectionate, though grave,
and Emily was serious, though she made
frequent efforts to appear cheerful. After
one of the most melancholy evenings they
had yet passed together, they separated for
the night.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the morning, Valancourt breakfasted
with St. Aubert and Emily, neither of
whom seemed much refreshed by sleep.
The languor of illness still hung over St.
Aubert, and to Emily's fears his disorder
appeared to be increasing fast upon him.
She watched his looks with anxious affect∣tion,
and their expression was always faith∣fully
reflected in her own.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="160"/>
At the commencement of their acquaint∣ance,
Valancourt had made known his
name and family. St. Aubert was not a
stranger to either, for the family estates,
which were now in the possession of an elder
brother of Valancourt, were little more than
twenty miles distant from La Vallée, and
he had sometimes met the elder Valancourt
on visits in the neighbourhood. This
knowledge had made him more willingly re∣ceive
his present companion; for, though his
countenance and manners would have won
him the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who
was very apt to trust to the intelligence of
his own eyes, with respect to countenances,
he would not have accepted these, as suffi∣cient
introductions to that of his daughter.</P>
<P>The breakfast was almost as silent as the
supper of the preceding night; but their
musing was at length interrupted by the
sound of the carriage-wheels, which were to
bear away St. Aubert and Emily. Valan∣court
started from his chair, and went to the
window; it was indeed the carriage, and
<PB N="151" REF="161"/>
he returned to, his seat without speaking.
The moment was now come when they
must part. St. Aubert told Valancourt,
that he hoped he would never pass La Val∣lée
without favouring him with a visit;
and Valancourt, eagerly thanking him, as∣sured
him that he never would; as he said
which he looked timidly at Emily, who
tried to smile away the seriousness of her
spirits. They passed a few minutes in in∣teresting
conversation, and St. Aubert then
led the way to the carriage, Emily and Va∣lancourt
following in silence. The latter
lingered at the door several minutes after
they were seated, and none of the party seemed
to have courage enough to say—Farewell. At
length, St. Aubert pronounced the melan∣choly
word, which Emily passed to Valan∣court,
who returned it, with a dejected
smile, and the carriage drove on.</P>
<P>The travellers remained, for some time,
in a state of tranquil pensiveness, which is
not unpleasing. St. Aubert interrupted it
by observing, "This is a very promising
<PB N="152" REF="162"/>
young man; it is many years since I have
been so much pleased with any person, on
so short an acquaintance. He brings back
to my memory the days of my youth, when
every scene was new and delightful!" St.
Aubert sighed, and sunk again into a reve∣rie;
and, as Emily looked back upon the
road they had passed, Valancourt was seen,
at the door of the little inn, following them
with his eyes. He perceived her, and
waved his hand; and she returned the
adieu, till the winding road shut her from,
his sight.</P>
<P>"I remember when I was about his age,"
resumed St. Aubert, "and I thought, and
felt exactly as he does. The world was
opening upon me then, now—it is closing."</P>
<P>"My dear sir, do not think so gloomily,"
said Emily in a trembling voice, "I hope
you have many, many years to live—for
your own sake—for <HI>my</HI> sake."</P>
<P>"Ah, my Emily!" replied St. Aubert,
"for thy sake! Well—I hope it is so."
He wiped away a tear, that was stealing
<PB N="153" REF="163"/>
down his cheek, threw a smile upon his
countenance, and said in a cheering voice,
"There is something in the ardour and in∣genuousness
of youth, which is particularly
pleasing to the contemplation of an old
man, if his feelings have not been entirely
corroded by the world. It is cheering and
reviving, like the view of spring to a sick
person; his mind catches somewhat of the
spirit of the season, and his eyes are lighted
up with a transient sunshine. Valancourt
is this spring to me."</P>
<P>Emily, who pressed her father's hand af∣fectionately,
had never before listened with
so much pleasure to the praises he bestow∣ed;
no, not even when he had bestowed
them on herself.</P>
<P>They travelled on, among vineyards,
woods, and pastures, delighted with the
romantic beauty of the landscape, which
was bounded, on one side, by the grandeur
of the Pyrenées, and, on the other, by the
ocean; and, soon after noon, they reached,
the town of Colioure, situated on the Me∣diterranean.
<PB N="154" REF="164"/>
Here they dined, and rested
till towards the cool of day, when they
pursued their way along the shores—those
enchanting shores! which extend to Lan∣guedoc.
Emily gazed with enthusiasm on
the vastness of the sea, its surface varying,
as the lights and shadows fell, and on its
woody banks, mellowed with autumnal
tints.</P>
<P>St. Aubert was impatient to reach Per∣pignan,
where he expected letters from M.
Quesnel; and it was the expectation of
these letters, that had induced him to leave
Colioure, for his feeble frame had required
immediate rest. After travelling a few
miles, he fell asleep; and Emily, who had
put two or three books into the carriage, on
leaving La Vallée, had now the leisure
for looking into them. She sought for one,
in which Valancourt had been reading the
day before, and hoped for the pleasure of
re-tracing a page, over which the eyes of a
beloved friend had lately passed, of dwell∣ing
on the passages, which he had admired,
<PB N="155" REF="165"/>
and of permitting them to speak to her in
the language of his own mind, and to bring
himself to her presence. On searching for
the book, she could find it no where, but in
its stead perceived a volume of Petrarch's
poems, that had belonged to Valancourt,
whose name was written in it, and from
which he had frequently read passages to
her, with all the pathetic expression, that
characterized the feelings of the author.
She hesitated in believing, what would have
been sufficiently apparent to almost any
other person, that he had purposely left,
this book, instead of the one she had lost,
and that love had prompted the exchange;
but, having opened it with impatient plea∣sure,
and observed the lines of his pencil
drawn along the various passages he had
read aloud, and under others more descrip∣tive
of delicate tenderness than he had dared
to trust his voice with, the conviction came,
at length, to her mind. For some moments
she was conscious only of being beloved;
then, a recollection of all the variations of
<PB N="156" REF="166"/>
tone and countenance, with which he had
recited these sonnets, and of the soul, which
spoke in their expreession, pressed to her me∣mory,
and she wept over the memorial of
his affection.</P>
<P>They arrived at Perpignan soon after sun∣set,
where St. Aubert found, as he had ex∣pected,
letters from M. Quesnel, the contents
of which so evidently and grievously affected
him, that Emily was alarmed, and pressed
him, as far as her delicacy would permit, to
disclose the occasion of his concern; but he
answered her only by tears, and immedi∣ately
began to talk on other topics. Emily,
though she forbore to press the one most in∣teresting
to her, was greatly affected by her
father's manner, and passed a night of sleep∣less
solicitude.</P>
<P>In the morning they pursued their jour∣ney
along the coast towards Leucate, ano∣ther
town on the Mediterranean, situated
on the borders of Languedoc and Rou∣sillon.
On the way, Emily renewed the
subject of the preceding night, and ap∣peared
<PB N="157" REF="167"/>
so deeply affected by St. Aubert's
silence and dejection, that he relaxed from
his reserve. "I was unwilling, my dear
Emily," said he, "to throw a cloud over
the pleasure you receive from these scenes,
and meant, therefore, to conceal, for the
present, some circumstances, with which,
however, you must at length have been
made acquainted. But your anxiety has
defeated my purpose; you suffer as much
from this, perhaps, as you will do from a
knowledge of the facts I have to relate.
M. Quesnel's visit proved an unhappy one
to me; he came to tell me a part of the
news he has now confirmed. You may
have heard me mention an M. Motteville,
of Paris, but you did not know that the
chief of my personal property was invested
in his hands. I had great confidence in
him, and I am yet willing to believe, that
he is not wholly unworthy of my esteem.
A variety of circumstances have concurred
to ruin him, and—I am ruined with him."</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="168"/>
St. Aubert paused, to conceal his emo∣tion.</P>
<P>"The letters I have just received from
M. Quesnel," resumed he, struggling to
speak with firmness "enclosed others
from Motteville, which confirmed all I
dreaded."</P>
<P>"Must we then quit La Vallée?" said
Emily, after a long pause of silence. "That
is yet uncertain," replied St. Aubert, "it
will depend upon the compromise Motte∣ville
is able to make with his creditors.
My income, you know, was never large,
and now it will be reduced to little indeed!
It is for you, Emily, for you, my child,
that I am most afflicted." His last words
faltered; Emily smiled tenderly upon him
through her tears, and then, endeavouring
to overcome her emotion, "My dear fa∣ther,"
said she, "do not grieve for me, or
for yourself; we may yet be happy;—if
La Vallée remains for us, we must be
happy. We will retain only one servant,
and you shall scarcely perceive the change
<PB N="159" REF="169"/>
in your income. Be comforted, my dear
sir; we shall not-feel the want of those
luxuries, which others value so highly,
since we never had a taste for them; and
poverty cannot deprive us of many conso∣lations.
It cannot rob us of the affection
we have for each other, or degrade us in
our own opinion, or in that of any person,
whose opinion we ought to value."</P>
<P>St. Aubert concealed his face with his
handkerchief, and was unable to speak;
but Emily continued to urge to her father
the truths, which himself had impressed
upon her mind.</P>
<P>"Besides, my dear sir, poverty cannot
deprive us of intellectual delights. It can∣not
deprive you of the comfort of affording
me examples of fortitude and benevolence;
nor me of the delight of consoling a beloved
parent. It cannot deaden our taste for the
grand, and the beautiful, or deny us the
means of indulging it; for the scenes of na∣ture—those
sublime spectacles, so infinitely
superior to all artificial luxuries! are open
<PB N="160" REF="170"/>
for the enjoyment of the poor, as well as of
the rich. Of what, then, have we to complain,
so long as we are not in want of necessaries?
Pleasures, such as wealth cannot buy, will
still be ours. We retain, then, the sublime
luxuries of nature, and lose only the frivo∣lous
ones of art."</P>
<P>St. Aubert could not reply: he caught
Emily to his bosom, their tears flowed to∣gether,
but—they were not tears of sorrow.
After this language of the heart, all other
would have been feeble, and they remained
silent for some time. Then, St. Aubert
conversed as before; for, if his mind had
not recovered its natural tranquillity, it at
least assumed the appearance of it.</P>
<P>They reached the romantic town of Leu∣cate
early in the day, but St. Aubert was
weary, and they determined to pass the
night there. In the evening, he exerted him∣self
so far as to walk with his daughter to
view the environs that overlook the lake of
Leucate, the Mediterranean, part of Rou∣sillon,
<PB N="161" REF="171"/>
with the Pyrenées, and a wide extent
of the luxuriant province of Languedoc,
now blushing with the ripened vintage,
which the peasants were beginning to ga∣ther.
St. Aubert and Emily saw the busy
groups, caught the joyous song, that was
wasted on the breeze, and anticipated, with
apparent pleasure, their next day's journey
over this gay region. He designed, howe∣ver,
still to wind along the sea-shore. To
return home immediately was partly his
wish, but from this he was with-held by a
desire to lengthen the pleasure, which the
journey gave his daughter, and to try the
effect of the sea air on his own disorder.</P>
<P>On the following day, therefore, they re∣commenced
their journey through Lan∣guedoc,
winding the shores of the Mediter∣ranean;
the Pyrenées still forming the mag∣nificent
back-ground of their prospects,
while on their right was the ocean, and, on
their left, wide extended plains melting
into the blue horizon. St. Aubert was
pleased, and conversed much with Emily,
<PB N="162" REF="172"/>
yet his cheerfulness was sometimes artificial,
and sometimes a shade of melancholy would
steal upon his countenance, and betray him.
This was soon chased away by Emily's
smile, who smiled, however, with an aching
heart, for she saw that his misfortunes preyed
upon his mind, and upon his enfeebled
frame.</P>
<P>It was evening when they reached a small
village of Upper Languedoc, where they
meant to pass the night, but the place could
not afford them beds; for here, too, it was
the time of the vintage, and they were
obliged to proceed to the next post. The
languor of illness and of fatigue, which re∣turned
upon St. Aubert, required imme∣diate
repose, and the evening was now far
advanced; but from necessity there was no
appeal, and he ordered Michael to pro∣ceed.</P>
<P>The rich plains of Languedoc, which ex∣hibited
all the glories of the vintage, with
the gaieties of a French festival, no longer
awakened St. Aubert to pleasure, whose
<PB N="163" REF="173"/>
condition formed a mournful contrast to the
hilarity and youthful beauty which sur∣rounded
him. As his languid eyes moved
over the scene, he considered, that they
would soon, perhaps, be closed for ever on
this world. "Those distant and sublime
mountains," said he secretly, as he gazed
on a chain of the Pyrenées that stretched
towards the west, "these luxuriant plains,
this blue vault, the cheerful light of day,
will be shut from my eyes! The song
of the peasant, the cheering voice of man—will
no longer sound for me!"</P>
<P>The intelligent eyes of Emily seemed to
read what passed in the mind of her father,
and she fixed them on his face, with an ex∣pression
of such tender pity, as recalled
his thoughts from every desultory object of
regret, and he remembered only, that he
must leave his daughter without protection.
This reflection changed regret to agony;
he sighed deeply, and remained silent, while
she seemed to understand that sigh, for she
<PB N="164" REF="174"/>
pressed his hand affectionately, and then
turned to the window to conceal her tears.
The sun now threw a last yellow gleam on the
waves of the Mediterranean, and the gloom
of twilight spread fast over the scene, till
only a melancholy ray appeared on the
western horizon, marking the point where
the sun had set amid the vapours of an au∣tumnal
evening. A cool breeze now came
from the snore, and Emily let down the
glass; but the air, which was refreshing
to health, was as chilling to sickness, and
St. Aubert desired, that the window might
be drawn up. Increasing illness made him
now more anxious than ever to finish the
day's journey, and he stopped the muleteer
to enquire how far they had yet to go to the
next post. He replied, Nine miles. "I
feel I am unable to proceed much further,"
said St. Aubert; "enquire, as you go, if
there is any house on the road that would ac∣commodate
us for the night." He sunk
back in the carriage, and Michael, crack∣ing
his whip in the air, set off, and continued
<PB N="165" REF="175"/>
on the full gallop, till St. Aubert, almost
fainting, called to him to stop. Emily looked
anxiously from the window, and saw a pea∣sant
walking at some little distance on the
road, for whom they waited, till he came
up, when he was asked, if there was any
house in the neighbourhood that accommo∣dated
travellers. He replied, that he knew
of none. "There is a chateau, indeed,
among those woods on the right," added
he, "but I believe it receives nobody, and
I cannot shew you the way, for I am almost
a stranger here." St. Aubert was going
to ask him some further question concern∣ing
the chateau, but the man abruptly passed
on. After some consideration, he ordered
Michael to proceed slowly to the woods.
Every moment now deepened the twilight,
and increased the difficulty of finding the
road. Another peasant soon after passed.
"Which is the way to the chateau in the
woods?" cried Michael.</P>
<P>"The chateau in the woods!" exclaimed
<PB N="166" REF="176"/>
the peasant, "Do you mean that, with the
turret, yonder?"</P>
<P>"I don't know as for the turret, as you
call it," said Michael, "I mean that white
piece of a building, that we see at a distance
there, among the trees."</P>
<P>"Yes, that is the turret; why, who are
you, that you are going thither?" said the
man with surprise.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, on hearing this odd question,
and observing the peculiar tone in which it
was delivered, looked out from the car∣riage.
"We are travellers," said he, "who
are in search of a house of accommodation
for the night; is there any hereabout?"</P>
<P>"None, Monsieur, unless you have a
mind to try your luck yonder," replied the
peasant, pointing to the woods, "but I
would not advise you to go there."</P>
<P>"To whom does the chateau belong?"</P>
<P>"I scarcely know myself, Monsieur."</P>
<P>"It is uninhabited, then." "No, not
uninhabited; the steward and housekeeper
are there, I believe."</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="177"/>
On hearing this, St. Aubert determined
to proceed to the chateau, and risque the re∣fusal
of being accommodated for the night;
he therefore desired the countryman would
shew Michael the way, and bade him expert
reward for his trouble. The man was for
a moment silent, and then said, that he was
going on other business, but that the road
could not be missed, if they went up an
avenue to the right, to which he pointed.
St. Aubert was going to speak, but the
peasant wished him good night, and walked
on.</P>
<P>The carriage now moved towards the
avenue, which was guarded by a gate, and
Michael having dismounted to open it,
they entered between rows of antient oak
and chesnut, whose intermingled branches
formed a lofty arch above. There was
something so gloomy and desolate in the
appearance of this avenue, and its lonely
silence, that Emily almost shuddered as she
passed along; and, recollecting the manner
in which the peasant had mentioned the
<PB N="168" REF="178"/>
chateau, she gave a mysterious meaning to
his words, such as she had not suspected
when he uttered them. These apprehen∣sions,
however, she tried to check, consi∣dering
that they were probably the effect of
a melancholy imagination, which her fa∣ther's
situation, and a consederation of her
own circumstances, had made sensible to
every impression.</P>
<P>They passed slowly on, for they were now
almost in darkness, which, together with the
unevenness of the ground, and the frequent
roots of old trees, that shot up above the
soil, made it necessary to proceed with cau∣tion.
On a sudden Michael stopped the
carriage; and, as St. Aubert looked from
the window to enquire the cause, he per∣ceived
a figure at some distance moving up
the avenue. The dusk would not permit
him to distinguish what it was, but he bade
Michael go on.</P>
<P>"This seems a strange wild place," said
Michael; "there is no house hereabout,
<PB N="169" REF="179"/>
don't your honour think we had better turn
back?"</P>
<P>"Go a little further, and if we see no
house then, we will return to the road,"
replied St. Aubert.</P>
<P>Michael proceeded with reluctance,
and the extreme slowness of his pace made
St. Aubert look again from the window to
hasten him, when again he saw the same
figure. He was somewhat startled: proba∣bly
the gloominess of the spot made him
more liable to alarm than usual; however
this might be, he now stopped Michael, and
bade him call to the person in the avenue.</P>
<P>"Please your honour, he may be a rob∣ber,"
said Michael. "It does not please
me," replied St. Aubert, who could not for∣bear
smiling at the simplicity of his phrase,
"and we will, therefore, return to the road,
for I see no probability of meeting here
with what we seek."</P>
<P>Michael turned about immediately, and
was retracing his way with alacrity, when a
voice was heard from among the trees on
<PB N="170" REF="180"/>
the left. It was not the voice of command,
or distress, but a deep hollow tone, which
seemed to be scarcely human. The man
whipped his mules till they went as fast as
possible, regardless of the darkness, the
broken ground, and the necks of the whole
party, nor once stopped till he reached the
gate, which opened from the avenue into
the high-road, where he went into a more
moderate pace.</P>
<P>"I am very ill," said St. Aubert, taking
his daughter's hand. "You are worse,
then, sir!" said Emily, extremely alarmed
by his manner, "you are worse, and here is
no assistance. Good God! what is to be
done!" He leaned his head on her
shoulder, while she endeavoured to support
him with her arm, and Michael was again
ordered to stop. When the rattling of the
wheels had ceased, music was heard on the
air; it was to Emily the voice of Hope.
"Oh! we are near some human habitation!"
said she, "help may soon be had."</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="181"/>
She listened anxiously; the sounds were
distant, and seemed to come from a remote
part of the woods that bordered the road;
and, as she looked towards the spot whence
they issued, she perceived in the faint
moon-light something like a chateau. It
was difficult, however, to reach this; St.
Aubert was now too ill to bear the mo∣tion
of the carriage; Michael could not
quit his mules; and Emily, who still sup∣ported
her father, feared to leave him, and
also feared to venture alone to such a dis∣tance,
she knew not whither, or to whom.
Something, however, it was necessary to de∣termine
upon immediately; St. Aubert,
therefore, told Michael to proceed slowly;
but they, had not gone far, when he fainted,
and the carriage was again stopped. He
lay quite senseless.—"My dear, dear fa∣ther,"
cried Emily in great agony, and who
began to fear that he was dying, "speak,
if it is only one word to let me hear the
sound of your voice!" But no voice spoke
in reply. In an agony of terror she bade
<PB N="172" REF="182"/>
Michael bring water from the rivulet, that
flowed along the road; and, having received
some in the man's hat, with trembling hands
she sprinkled it over her father's face, which,
as the moon's rays now fell upon it, seemed
to bear the impression of death. Every emo∣tion
of selfish fear now gave way to a strong∣er
influence, and, committing St. Aubert to
the care of Michael, who refused to go far
from his mules, she stepped from the car∣riage
in search of the chateau she had seen
at a distance. It was a still moon-light
night, and the music, which yet sounded on
the air, directed her steps from the high
road, up a shadowy lane, that led to the
woods. Her mind was for some time so en∣tirely
occupied by anxiety and terror for
her father, that she felt none for herself, till
the deepening gloom of the overhanging fo∣liage,
which now wholly excluded the moon∣light,
and the wildness of the place, re∣called
her to a sense of her adventurous
situation. The music had ceased, and she
had no guide but chance. For a moment
<PB N="173" REF="183"/>
she paused in terrified perplexity, till a sense
of her father's condition again overcoming
every consideration for herself, she proceed∣ed.
The lane terminated in the woods, but
she looked round in vain for a house, or a
human being, and as vainly listened for a
sound to guide her. She hurried on, how∣ever,
not knowing whither, avoiding the
recesses of the woods, and endeavouring to
keep along their margin, till a rude kind of
avenue, which opened upon a moon-light
spot, arrested her attention. The wildness
of this avenue brought to her recollection
the one leading to the turreted chateau, and
she was inclined to believe, that this was a
part of the same domain, and probably led to
the same point. While she hesitated, whether
to follow it or not, a sound of many voices in
loud merriment burst upon her ear. It seemed
not the laugh of cheerfulness, but of riot,
and she stood appalled. While she paused,
she heard a distant voice, calling from the
way she had come, and, not doubting but
it was that of Michael, her first impulse
<PB N="174" REF="184"/>
was to hasten back; but a second thought
changed her purpose; she believed that no∣thing
less than the last extremity could have
prevailed with Michael to quit his mules, and
fearing that her father was now dying, she
rushed forward, with a feeble hope of ob∣taining
assistance from the people in the
woods. Her heart beat with fearful expecta∣tion,
as she drew near the spot whence the
voices issued, and she often startled when
her steps disturbed the fallen leaves. The
sounds led her towards the moon-light glade
she had before noticed; at a little distance
from which she stopped, and saw, between
the boles of the trees, a small circular level
of green turf, surrounded by the woods,
on which appeared a group of figures.
On drawing nearer, she distinguished these,
by their dress, to be peasants, and perceived
several cottages scattered round the edge of
the woods, which waved loftily over this
spot. While she gazed, and endeavoured
to overcome the apprehensions that with∣held
her steps, several peasant girls came
<PB N="175" REF="185"/>
out of a cottage; music instantly struck up,
and the dance began. It was the joyous
music of the vintage! the same she had be∣fore
heard upon the air. Her heart, occu∣pied
with terror for her father, could not
feel the contrast, which this gay scene offer∣ed
to her own distress; she stepped hastily
forward towards a group of elder peasants,
who were seated at the door of a cottage,
and, having explained her situation, entreat∣ed
their assistance. Several of them rose
with alacrity, and, offering any service in
their power, followed Emily, who seemed
to move on the wind, as fast as they could
towards the road.</P>
<P>When she reached the carriage, she found
St. Aubert restored to animation. On the
recovery of his senses, having heard from
Michael whither his daughter was gone,
anxiety for her overcame every regard for
himself, and he had sent him in search of
her. He was, however, still languid, and,
perceiving himself unable to travel much
further, he renewed his enquiries for an
<PB N="176" REF="186"/>
inn, and concerning the chateau in the
woods. "The chateau cannot accommo∣date
you, sir," said a venerable peasant who
had followed Emily from the woods, "it is
scarcely inhabited; but, if you will do me
the honour to visit my cottage, you shall
be welcome to the best bed it affords."</P>
<P>St. Aubert was himself a Frenchman;
he, therefore, was not surprised at French
courtesy; but, ill as he was, he felt the va∣lue
of the offer enhanced by the manner
which accompanied it. He had too much
delicacy to apologize, or to appear to hesitate
about availing himself of the peasant's hos∣pitality,
but immediately accepted it with
the same frankness with which it was of∣fered.</P>
<P>The carriage again moved slowly on;
Michael following the peasants up the lane,
which Emily had just quitted, till they came
to the moon light glade. St. Aubert's spirits
were so far restored by the courtesy of his
host, and the near prospect of repose, that
he looked with a sweet complacency upon
<PB N="177" REF="187"/>
the moon-light scene, surrounded by the
shadowy woods, through which, here and
there, an opening admitted the streaming
splendour, discovering a cottage, or a spark∣ling
rivulet. He listened, with no painful
emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar
and tamborine; and, though tears came
to his eyes, when he saw the <HI>debonnaire</HI>
dance of the peasants, they were not merely
tears of mournful regret. With Emily it
was otherwise; immediate terror for her fa∣ther
had now subsided into a gentle melan∣choly,
which every note of joy, by awaken∣ing
comparison, served to heighten.</P>
<P>The dance ceased on the approach of the
carriage, which was a phenomenon in these
sequestered woods, and the peasantry flock∣ed
round it with eager curiosity. On learn∣ing
that it brought a sick stranger, several
girls ran across the turf, and returned with
wine and baskets of grapes, which they pre∣sented
to the travellers, each with kind con∣tention
pressing for a preference. At length,
the carriage stopped at a neat cottage, and
<PB N="178" REF="188"/>
his venerable conductor, having assisled St.
Aubert to alight, led him and Emily to
a small inner room, illumined only by
moon-beams, which the open casement ad∣mitted.
St. Aubert, rejoicing in rest, seat∣ed
himself in an arm-chair, and his senses
were refreshed by the cool and balmy air,
that lightly waved the embowering honey∣suckles,
and wafted their sweet breath into
the apartment. His host, who was called
La Voisin, quitted the room, but soon re∣turned
with fruits, cream, and all the pasto∣ral
luxury his cottage afforded; having set
down which, with a smile of unfeigned
welcome, he retired behind the chair of his
guest. St. Aubert insisted on his taking
a seat at the table, and, when the fruit
had allayed the fever of his palate, and he
found himself somewhat revived, he began
to converse with his host, who communica∣ted
several particulars concerning himself
and his family, which were interesting, be∣cause
they were spoken from the heart, and
delineated a picture of the sweet courtesies
<PB N="179" REF="189"/>
of family kindness. Emily sat by her father,
holding his hand, and, while she listened to
the old man, her heart swelled with the af∣fectionate
sympathy he described, and her
tears fell to the mournful consideration, that
death would probably soon deprive her of
the dearest blessing she then possessed. The
soft moon-light of an autumnal evening,
and the distant music, which now sounded
a plaintive strain, aided the melancholy of
her mind. The old man continued to talk
of his family, and St. Aubert remained
silent. "I have only one daughter living,"
said La Voisin, "but she is happily mar∣ried,
and is every thing to me. When I
lost my wife," he added with a sigh, "I
came to live with Agnes, and her fami∣ly;
she has several children, who are all
dancing on the green yonder, as merry as
grasshoppers—and long may they be so!
I hope to die among them, monsieur. I
am old now, and cannot expect to live
long, but there is some comfort in dying
surrounded by one's children."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="190"/>
"My good friend," said St. Aubert,
while his voice trembled, "I hope you will
long live surrounded by them."</P>
<P>"Ah, sir! at my age I must not expect
that!" replied the old man, and he paused:
"I can scarcely wish it," he resumed, "for
I trust that whenever I die I shall go to
heaven, where my poor wife is gone before
me. I can sometimes almost fancy I see her
of a still moon-light night, walking among
these shades she loved so well. Do you be∣lieve,
monsieur, that we shall be permitted
to revisit the earth, after we have quitted
the body?"</P>
<P>Emily could no longer stifle the anguish
of her heart; her tears fell fast upon her
father's hand, which she yet held. He
made an effort to speak, and at length said
in a low voice, "I hope we shall be per∣mitted
to look down on those we have left
on the earth, but I can only hope it. Fu∣turity
is much veiled from our eyes, and
faith and hope are our only guides concern∣ing
it. We are not enjoined to believe, that
<PB N="181" REF="191"/>
disembodied spirits watch over the friends
they have loved, but we may innocently
hope it. It is a hope which I will never
resign," continued he, while he wiped the
tears from his daughter's eyes, "it will sweet∣en
the bitter moments of death!" Tears
fell slowly on his cheeks; La Voisin wept
too, and there was a pause of silence. Then,
La Voisin, renewing the subject, said, "But
you believe, sir, that we shall meet in another
world the relations we have loved in this; I
must believe this." "Then do believe it,"
replied St. Aubert, "severe, indeed, would
be the pangs of separation, if we believed it
to be eternal. Look up, my dear Emily,
we shall meet again!" He lifted his eyes
towards heaven, and a gleam of moon-light,
which fell upon his countenance, discover∣ed
peace and resignation, stealing on the
lines of sorrow.</P>
<P>La Voisin felt that he had pursued the
subject too far, and he dropped it, saying,
"We are in darkness, I forgot to bring a
light"</P>
<P>"No," said St. Aubert, "this is a light
<PB N="182" REF="192"/>
I love. Sit down, my good friend. Emi∣ly,
my love, I find myself better than I
have been all day; this air refreshes me.
I can enjoy this tranquil hour, and that
music, which floats so sweetly at a distance.
Let me see you smile. "Who touches that
guitar so tastefully? are there two instru∣ments,
or is it an echo I hear?"</P>
<P>"It is an echo, monsieur, I fancy. That
guitar is often heard at night, when all
is still, but nobody knows who touches it,
and it is sometimes accompanied by a voice
so sweet, and so sad, one would almost
think the woods were haunted." "They
certainly are haunted," said St. Aubert with
a smile, "but I believe it is by mortals."
"I have sometimes heard it at midnight,
when I could not sleep," rejoined La
Voisin, not seeming to notice this re∣mark,
"almost under my window, and
I never heard any music like it. It has
often made me think of my poor wife till I
cried. I have sometimes got up to the win∣dow
to look if I could see any body, but
<PB N="183" REF="193"/>
as soon as I opened the casement all was
hushed, and nobody to be seen; and I have
listened, and listened till I have been so ti∣morous,
that even the trembling of the
leaves in the breeze has made me start.
They say it often comes to warn people of
their death, but I have heard it these many
years, and outlived the warning."</P>
<P>Emily, though she smiled at the mention
of this ridiculous superstition, could not, in
the present tone of her spirits, wholly resist
its contagion.</P>
<P>"Well, but, my good friend," said St.
Aubert, "has nobody had courage to follow
the sounds? If they had, they would probably
have discovered who is the musician." "Yes,
sir, they have followed them some way into
the woods, but the music has still retreated,
and seemed as distant as ever, and the peo∣ple
have at last been afraid of being led in∣to
harm, and would go no further. It is
very seldom that I have heard these sounds
so early in the evening. They usually come
about midnight, when that bright planet,
<PB N="184" REF="194"/>
which is rising above the turret yonder, sets
below the woods on the left."</P>
<P>"What turret?" asked St. Aubert with
quickness, "I see none."</P>
<P>"Your pardon, monsieur, you do see
one indeed, for the moon shines full upon
it;—up the avenue yonder, a long way off;
the chateau it belongs to is hid among the
trees."</P>
<P>"Yes, my dear sir," said Emily pointing,
"don't you see something glitter above the
dark woods? It is a fane, I fancy, which
the rays fall upon."</P>
<P>"O yes, I see what you mean; and who
does the chateau belong to?"</P>
<P>"The Marquis de Villeroi was its own∣er,"
replied La Voisin, emphatically.</P>
<P>"Ah!" said St. Aubert with a deep sigh,
"are we then so near Le-Blanc!" He ap∣peared
much agitated.</P>
<P>"It used to be the Marquis's favourite
residence," resumed La Voisin, "but he
took a dislike to the place, and has not been
there for many years. We have heard
<PB N="185" REF="195"/>
lately that he is dead, and that it is fallen
into other hands." St. Aubert, who had
sat in deep musing, was roused by the last
words. "Dead!" he exclaimed, "Good
God! when did he die?"</P>
<P>"He is reported to have died about five
weeks since," replied La Voisin. "Did you
know the Marquis, sir?"</P>
<P>"This is very extraordinary!" said St.
Aubert without attending to the question.
"Why is it so, my dear sir?" said Emily,
in a voice" of timid curiosity. He made no
reply, but sunk again into a reverie; and
in a few moments, when he seemed to have
recovered himself, asked who had succeeded
to the estates. "I have forgot his title,
monsieur," said La Voisin; "but my lord
resides at Paris chiefly; I hear no talk of
his coming hither."</P>
<P>"The chateau is shut up then, still?"</P>
<P>"Why, little better, sir; the old house∣keeper,
and her husband the steward, have
the care of it, but they live generally in a
cottage hard by."</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="196"/>
"The chateau is spacious, I suppose,"
said Emily, "and must be desolate for the
tesidence of only two persons."</P>
<P>Desolate enough, mademoiselle," re∣plied
La Voisin, "I would not pass one
night in the chateau, for the value of the
whole domain."</P>
<P>"What is that?" said St. Aubert, roused
again from thoughtfulness. As his host
repeated his last sentence, a groan escaped
from St. Aubert, and then, as if anxious
to prevent it from being noticed, he hastily
asked La Voisin how long he had lived
in this neighbourhood. "Almost from my
childhood, sir," replied his host.</P>
<P>"You remember the late marchioness,
then?" said St. Aubert in an altered voice.</P>
<P>"Ah, monsieur!—that I do well. There
are many beside me who remember her."</P>
<P>"Yes—" said St. Aubert, "and I am
one of those."</P>
<P>"Alas, sir! you remember, then, a most
beautiful and excellent lady. She deserved
a better fate."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="197"/>
Tears stood in St. Aubert's eyes;
"Enough," said he, in a voice almost stifled
by the violence of his emotions,—"it is
enough, my friend."</P>
<P>Emily, though extremely surprised by
her father's manner, forbore to express her
feelings by any question. La Voisin began
to apologize, but St. Aubert interrupted
him; "Apology is quite unnecessary,"
said he, "let us change the topic. You
was speaking of the music we just now
heard."</P>
<P>"I was, monsieur,—but hark!—it comes
again; listen to that voice!" They were
all silent;
<Q><L>At last a soft and solemn-breathing
sound</L>
<L>Rose, like a stream of rich distilled persumes,</L>
<L>And stole upon the air, that even Silence</L>
<L>Was took ere she was 'ware, and wished she might</L>
<L>Deny her nature, and be never more</L>
<L>Still, to be so displaced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MILTON.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>In a few moments the voice died into air,
and the instrument, which had been heard
<PB N="188" REF="198"/>
before, sounded in low symphony. St. Au∣bert
now observed, that it produced a tone
much more full and melodious than that of
a guitar, and still more melancholy and soft
than the lute. They continued to listen, but the
sounds returned no more. "This is strange!"
said St. Aubert, at length interrupting the
silence. "Very strange!" said Emily. "It
is so," rejoined La Voisin, and they were
again silent.</P>
<P>After a long pause, "It is now about
eighteen years since I first heard that mu∣sic,"
said La Voisin; "I remember it was
on a fine summer's night, much like this,
but later, that I was walking in the woods,
and alone. I remember, too, that my spirits
were very low, for one of my boys was ill,
and we feared we mould lose him. I had
been watching at his bed-side all the even∣ing
while his mother slept; for she had sat
up with him the night before. I had been
watching, and went out for a little fresh air,
the day had been very sultry. As I walk∣ed
under the shades and mused, I heard mu∣sic
<PB N="189" REF="199"/>
at a distance, and thought it was Claude
playing upon his flute, as he often did of a
fine evening, at the cottage door. But,
when I came to a place, where the trees
opened, (I shall never forget it!) and stood
looking up at the north-lights, which shot
up the heaven to a great height, I heard all
of a sudden such sounds!—they came so as
I cannot describe. It was like the music of
angels, and I looked up again almost ex∣pecting
to see them in the sky. When I
came home, I told what I had heard, but
they laughed at me, and said it must be some
of the shepherds playing on their pipes, and
I could not persuade them to the contrary.
A few nights after, however, my wife her∣self
heard the same sounds, and was as much
surprised as I was, and father Denis fright∣ened
her sadly by saying, that it was music
come to warn her of her child's death, and
that music often came to houses where there
was a dying person."</P>
<P>Emily, on hearing this, shrunk with a
superstitious dread entirely new to her, and
<PB N="190" REF="200"/>
could scarcely conceal her agitation from
St. Aubert.</P>
<P>"But the boy lived, monsieur, in spite
of father Denis."</P>
<P>"Father Denis!" said St. Aubert, who
had listened to "narrative old age" with
patient attention, "are we near a convent,
then?"</P>
<P>"Yes, sir, the convent of St. Clair stands
at no great distance, on the sea shore
yonder."</P>
<P>"Ah!" said St. Aubert, as if struck
with some sudden remembrance, "the con∣vent of St. Clair!" Emily observed the
clouds of grief, mingled with a faint ex∣pression
of horror, gathering on his brow;
his countenance became fixed, and, touched
as it now was by the silver whiteness of the
moon light, he resembled one of those mar∣ble
statues of a monument, which seem to
bend, in hopeless sorrow, over the ashes of
the dead, shewn</P>
<Q><L>—by the blunted light</L>
<L>That the dim moon through painted casements lends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Emigrants.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="191" REF="201"/>
"But, my dear sir," said Emily, anxious
to dissipate his thoughts, "you forget that
repose is necessary to you. If our kind
host will give me leave, I will prepare your
bed, for I know how you like it to be
made." St. Aubert, recollecting himself,
and smiling affectionately, desired she would
not add to her fatigue by that attention;
and La Voisin, whose consideration for his
guest had been suspended by the interests,
which his own narrative had recalled, now
started from his seat, and, apologizing for
not having called Agnes from the green,
hurried out of the room.</P>
<P>In a few moments he returned with his
daughter, a young woman of a pleasing
countenance, and Emily learned from her,
what she had not before suspected, that, for
their accommodation, it was necessary part
of La Voisin's family should leave their
beds; she lamented this circumstance, but
Agnes, by her reply, fully proved that she
inherited, at least, a share of her father's
courteous hospitality. It was settled, that
<PB N="192" REF="202"/>
some of her children and Michael should
sleep in the neighbouring cottage.</P>
<P>"If I am better, to-morrow, my dear,"
said St. Aubert when Emily returned to
him, "I mean to set out at an early hour,
that we may rest, during the heat of the
day, and will travel towards home. In the
present state of my health and spirits, I can∣not
look on a longer journey with pleasure,
and I am also very anxious to reach La
Vallée." Emily, though she also desired
to return, was grieved at her father's sudden
wish to do so, which she thought indicated
a greater degree of indisposition than he
would acknowledge. St. Aubert now re∣tired
to rest, and Emily to her little cham∣ber,
but not to immediate repose. Her
thoughts returned to the late conversation,
concerning the state of departed spirits; a
subject, at this time, particularly affecting
to her, when she had every reason to believe,
that her dear father would ere long be num∣bered
with them. She leaned pensively on
the little open casement, and in deep thought
<PB N="193" REF="203"/>
fixed her eyes on the heaven, whose blue
unclouded concave was studded thick with
stars, the worlds, perhaps, of spirits, un∣sphered
of mortal mould. As her eyes
wandered along the boundless aether, her
thoughts rose, as before, towards the subli∣mity
of the Deity, and to the contemplation
of futurity. No busy note of this world
interrupted the course of her mind; the
merry dance had ceased, and every cottager
had retired to his home. The still air seemed
scarcely to breathe upon the woods, and,
now and then, the distant sound of a soli∣tary
sheep-bell, or of a closing casement, was
all that broke on silence. At length, even
this hint of human being was heard no
more. Elevated and enwrapt, while her
eyes were often wet with tears of sublime
devotion and solemn awe, she continued at
the casement, till the gloom of mid-night
hung over the earth, and the planet, which
La Voisin had pointed out, sunk below the
woods. She then recollected what he had
said concerning this planet, and the myste∣rious
<PB N="194" REF="204"/>
music; and, as she lingered at the
window, half hoping and half fearing that
it would return, her mind was led to the
remembrance of the extreme emotion her
father had shewn on mention of the Marquis
La Villeroi's death, and of the fate of the
Marchioness, and she felt strongly interested
concerning the remote cause of this emotion.
Her surprise and curiosity were indeed the
greater, because she did not recollect ever
to have heard him mention the name of
Villeroi.</P>
<P>No music, however, stole on the silence of
the night, and Emily, perceiving the lateness
of the hour, returned to a scene of fatigue,
remembered that she was to rise early in the
morning, and withdrew from the window to
repose.</P>

<P>EMILY, called, as she had requested, at
an early hour, awoke, little refreshed by
sleep, for uneasy dreams had pursued her, and
marred the kindest blessing of the unhappy.
But, when she opened her casement, looked
out upon the woods, bright with the morn∣ing
sun, and inspired the pure air, her
mind was soothed. The scene was filled
with that cheering freshness, which seems to
breathe the very spirit of health, and she heard
only sweet and <HI>picturesque</HI> sounds, if such an
<PB N="196" REF="206"/>
expression may be allowed—the matin∣bell
of a distant convent, the faint murmur
of the sea-waves, the song of birds, and
the far-off low of cattle, which she saw
coming slowly on between the trunks of the
trees. Struck with the circumstances of
imagery around her, she indulged the pen∣sive
tranquillity which they inspired; and
while she leaned on her window, waiting
till St. Aubert should descend to break∣fast,
her ideas arranged themselves in the
following lines:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>THE FIRST HOUR OF MORNING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>How sweet to wind the forest's tangled shade,</L>
<L>When early twilight, from the eastern bound,</L>
<L>Dawns on the sleeping landscape in the glade,</L>
<L>And fades as morning spreads her blush around!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When ev'ry infant flower, that wept in night,</L>
<L>Lifts its chill head soft glowing with a tear,</L>
<L>Expands its tender blossom to the light,</L>
<L>And gives its incense to the genial air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How fresh the breeze that wafts the rich perfume,</L>
<L>And swells the melody of waking birds;</L>
<L>The hum of bees, beneath the verdant gloom,</L>
<L>And woodman's song, and low of distant herds!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="197" REF="207"/>
<L>Then, doubtful gleams the mountain's hoary head,</L>
<L>Seen through the parting foliage from afar;</L>
<L>And, farther still, the ocean's misty bed,</L>
<L>With flitting fails, that partial sun-beams share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, vain the sylvan shade—the breath of May,</L>
<L>The voice of music floating on the gale,</L>
<L>And forms, that beam through morning's dewy veil,</L>
<L>If health no longer bid the heart be gay!</L>
<L>O balmy hour! 'tis thine her wealth to give,</L>
<L>Here spread her blush, and bid the parent live!</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>Emily now heard persons moving below
in the cottage, and presently the voice of
Michael, who was talking to his mules, as
he led them forth from a hut adjoining.
As she left her room, St. Aubert, who was
now risen, met her at the door, apparently
as little restored by sleep as herself. She
led him down stairs to the little parlour,
in which they had supped on the preceding
night, where they found a neat breakfast
set out, while the host and his daughter
waited to bid them good morrow.</P>
<P>"I envy you this cottage, my good
friends," said St. Aubert, as he met them,
<PB N="198" REF="208"/>
"it is so pleasant, so quiet, and so neat;
and this air, that one breathes—if any thing
could restore lost health, it would surely be
this air."</P>
<P>La Voisin bowed gratefully, and replied,
with the gallantry of a Frenchman, "Our
cottage may be envied, sir, since you and
Mademoiselle have honoured it with your
presence." St. Aubert gave him a friendly
smile for his compliment, and sat down to
a table, spread with cream, fruit, new
cheese, butter, and coffee. Emily, who
had observed her father with attention, and
thought he looked very ill, endeavoured to
persuade him to defer travelling till the af∣ternoon;
but he seemed very anxious to be
at home, and his anxiety he expressed re∣peatedly,
and with an earnestness that was
unusual with him. He now said, he found
himself as well as he had been of late, and
that he could bear travelling better in the
cool hour of the morning, than at any other
time. But, while he was talking with his
venerable host, and thanking him for his
kind attentions, Emily observed his coun∣tenance
<PB N="199" REF="209"/>
change, and, before she could reach
him, he fell back in his chair. In a few
moments he recovered from the sudden
faintness that had come over him, but felt
so ill, that he perceived himself unable to
set out, and, having remained a little while,
struggling against the pressure of
indisposi∣tion,
he begged he might be helped up
stairs to bed. This request renewed all the
terror which Emily had suffered on the pre∣ceding
evening; but, though scarcely able
to support herself, under the sudden shock
it gave her, she tried to conceal her appre∣hensions
from St. Aubert, and gave her
trembling arm to assist him to the door of
his chamber.</P>
<P>When he was once more in bed, he de∣sired
that Emily, who was then weeping
in her own room, might be called; and, as
she came, he waved his hand for every
other person to quit the apartment. When
they were alone, he held out his hand to
her, and fixed his eyes upon her counte∣nance,
with an expression so full of tender∣ness
and grief, that all her fortitude forsook
<PB N="200" REF="210"/>
her, and she burst into an agony of tears.
St. Aubert seemed struggling to acquire
firmness, but was still unable to speak; he
could only press her hand, and check the tears
that stood trembling in his eyes. At length,
he commanded his voice, "My dear child,"
said he, trying to smile through his anguish,
"my dear Emily!"—and paused again.
He raised his eyes to heaven, as if in prayer,
and then, in a firmer tone, and with a look,
in which the tenderness of the father was
dignified by the pious solemnity of the saint,
he said, "My dear child, I would soften
the painful truth I have to tell you, but I
find myself quite unequal to the art. Alas!
I would, at this moment, conceal it from
you, but that it would be most cruel to de∣ceive
you. It cannot be long before we
must part; let us talk of it, that our
thoughts and our prayers may prepare us
to bear it." His voice faltered, while
Emily, still weeping, pressed his hand close
to her heart, which swelled with a convul∣sive
sigh, but she could not look up.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="211"/>
"Let me not waste these moments," said
St. Aubert, recovering himself, "I have
much to say. There is a circumstance of so∣lemn
consequence, which I have to mention,
and a solemn promise to obtain from you;
when this is done I shall be easier. You
have observed, my dear, how anxious I am
to reach home, but know not all my reasons
for this. Listen to what I am going to say.—Yet
stay—before I say more give me
this promise, a promise made to your dying
father!"—St. Aubert was interrupted;
Emily, struck by his last words, as if for
the first time, with a conviction of his im∣mediate
danger, raised her head; her tears
stopped, and, gazing at him for a moment
with an expression of unutterable anguish,
a slight convulsion seized her, and she sunk
senseless in her chair. St. Aubert's cries
brought La Voisin and his daughter to the
room, and they administered every means
in their power to restore her, but, for a
considerable time, without effect. When
she recovered, St. Aubert was so exhausted
by the scene he had witnessed, that it was
<PB N="202" REF="212"/>
many minutes before he had strength to
speak; he was, however, somewhat revived
by a cordial, which Emily gave him; and,
being again alone with her, he exerted him∣self
to tranquillize her spirits, and to offer
her all the comfort of which her situation
admitted. She threw herself into his arms,
wept on his neck, and grief made her so in∣sensible
to all he said, that he ceased to offer
the alleviations, which he himself could not,
at this moment, feel, and mingled his silent
tears with hers. Recalled, at length, to a,
sense of duty, she tried to spare her father
from farther view of her suffering; and,
quitting his embrace, dried her tears, and
said something, which she meant for con∣solation.
"My dear Emily," replied St.
Aubert, "my dear child, we must look up
with humble confidence to that Being, who
has protected and comforted us in every
danger, and in every affliction we have
known; to whose eye every moment of our
lives has been exposed; he will not, he does
not, forsake us now; I feel his consolations
in my heart. I shall leave you, my child,
<PB N="203" REF="213"/>
still in his care; and, though I depart from
this world, I shall be still in his presence.
Nay, weep not again, my Emily. In
death there is nothing new, or surprising,
since we all know, that we are born to die;
and nothing terrible to those, who can con∣side
in an all-powerful God. Had my life
been spared now, after a very few years, in
the course of nature, I must have resigned
it; old age, with all its train of infirmity,
its privations and its sorrows, would have
been mine; and then, at last, death would
have come, and called, forth the tears you
now shed. Rather, my child, rejoice, that
I am saved from such suffering, and that I
am permitted to die with a mind unim∣paired,
and sensible of the comforts of faith
and of resignation." St. Aubert paused,
fatigued, with speaking. Emily again en∣deavoured
to assume an air of composure;
and, in replying to what he had said, tried
to sooth him with a belief, that he had not
spoken in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="214"/>
When he had reposed a while, he resumed
the conversation. "Let me return," said
he, "to a subject, which is very near
my heart. I said I had a solemn promise
to receive from you; let me receive it now,
before I explain the chief circumstance
which it concerns; there are others, of
which your peace requires that you should
rest in ignorance. Promise, then, that you
will perform exactly what I shall enjoin."</P>
<P>Emily, awed by the earnest solemnity of
his manner, dried her tears, that had be∣gun
again to flow, in spite of her efforts to
suppress them; and, looking eloquently
at St. Aubert, bound herself to do what∣ever
he should require by a vow, at which
she shuddered, yet knew not why.</P>
<P>He proceeded: "I know you too well,
my Emily, to believe, that you would break
any promise, much less one thus solemnly
given; your assurance gives me peace, and
the observance of it is of the utmost im∣portance
to your tranquillity. Hear, then,
what I am going to tell you. The closet,
<PB N="205" REF="215"/>
which adjoins my chamber at La Vallée,
has a sliding board in the floor. You will
know it by a remarkable knot in the wood,
and by its being the next board, except
one, to the wainscot, which fronts the door.
At the distance of about a yard from that
end, nearer the window, you will perceive a
line across it, as if the plank had been
joined;—the way to open it is this:—Press
your foot upon the line, the end of the
board will then sink, and you may slide it
with ease beneath the other. Below, you
will see a hollow place." St. Aubert
paused for breath, and Emily sat fixed in
deep attention. "Do you understand these
directions, my dear?" said he. Emily,
though scarcely able to speak, assured him,
that she did.</P>
<P>"When you return home, then," he
added with a deep sigh—</P>
<P>At the mention of her return home, all
the melancholy circumstances, that must
attend this return, rushed upon her fancy;
she burst into convulsive grief, and St. Aubert
<PB N="206" REF="216"/>
himself, affected beyond the resistance of
the fortitude which he had, at first, sum∣moned,
wept with her. After some mo∣ments,
he composed himself. "My dear
child," said he, "be comforted. "When I
am gone, you will not be forsaken—I leave
you only in the more immediate care of
that Providence, which has never yet for∣saken
me. Do not afflict me with this ex∣cess
of grief; rather teach me by your ex∣ample
to bear my own." He stopped
again, and Emily, the more she endeavoured
to restrain her emotion, found it the less
possible to do so.</P>
<P>St. Aubert, who now spoke with pain,
resumed the subject. "That closet, my
dear,—when you return home, go to it;
and, beneath the board I have described,
you will find a packet of written papers.
Attend to me now, for the promise you
have given particularly relates, to what I
shall direct. These papers you must burn—and,
solemnly I command you, <HI>without exa∣mining
them.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="217"/>
Emily's surprise, for a moment, over∣came
her grief, and she ventured to ask,
why this must be? St. Aubert replied,
that, if it had been right for him to explain
his reasons, her late promise would have
been unnecessarily exacted. It is sufficient
for you, my love, to have a deep sense of
the importance of observing me in this in∣stance."
Sr. Aubert proceeded. "Un∣der
that board you will also find about
two hundred louis d'ors, wrapped in a silk
purse; indeed, it was to secure whatever
money might be in the chateau, that this se∣cret
place was contrived, at a time when
the province was over-run by troops of
men, who took advantage of the tumults,
and became plunderers.</P>
<P>"But I have yet another promise to re∣ceive
froms you, which is—that you will
never, whatever may be your future cir∣cumstances,
<HI>sell</HI> the chateau." St. Aubert
even enjoined her, whenever she might
marry, to make it an article in the contract,
that the chateau should always be hers.
<PB N="208" REF="218"/>
He then gave her a more minute account of
his present circumstances than he had yet
done, adding, "The two hundred louis,
with what money you will now find in my
purse, is all the ready money I have to
leave you. I have told you how I am cir∣cumstanced
with M. Motteville, at Paris.
Ah, my child! I leave you poor—but not
destitute," he added, after a long pause.
Emily could make no reply to any thing he
now said, but knelt at the bed-side, with
her face upon the quilt, weeping over the
hand she held there.</P>
<P>After this conversation, the mind of St.
Aubert appeared to be much more at ease;
but, exhausted by the effort of speaking, he
sunk into a kind of doze, and Emily conti∣nued
to watch and weep beside him, till a
gentle tap at the chamber-door roused her.
It was La Voisin, come to say, that a con∣fessor
from the neighbouring convent was
below, ready to attend St. Aubert. Emily
would not suffer her father to be disturbed,
but desired, that the priest might hot leave
<PB N="209" REF="219"/>
the cottage. When St. Aubert awoke
from this doze, his senses were confused,
and it was some moments before he reco∣vered
them sufficiently to know, that it was
Emily who sat beside him. He then moved
his lips, and stretched forth his hand to
her; as she received which, she sunk back
in her chair, overcome by the impression of
death on his countenance. In a few mi∣nutes
he recovered his voice, and Emily
then asked, if he wished to see the confessor,
he replied, that he did; and, when the holy
father appeared, she withdrew. They re∣mained
alone together above half an hour;
when Emily was called in, she found St.
Aubert more agitated than when she had
left him, and she gazed, with a slight de∣gree
of resentment, at the friar, as the cause
of this; who, however, looked mildly and
mournfully at her, and turned away. St.
Aubert, in a tremulous voice, said, he
wished her to join in prayer with him, and
asked if La Voisin would do so too. The
old man and his daughter came; they both
<PB N="210" REF="220"/>
wept, and knelt with Emily round the bed,
while the holy father read in a solemn voice
the service for the dying. St. Aubert lay
with a serene countenance, and seemed to
join fervently in the devotion, while tears
often stole from beneath his closed eye-lids,
and Emily's sobs more than once inter∣rupted
the service.</P>
<P>When it was concluded, and extreme
unction had been administered, the friar
withdrew. St. Aubert then made a sign
for La Voisin to come nearer. He gave
him his hand, and was, for a moment,
silent. At length, he said, in a trembling
voice, "My good friend, our acquaintance
has been short, but long enough to give
you an opportunity of shewing me much
kind attention. I cannot doubt, that you
will extend this kindness to my daughter,
when I am gone; she will have need of it.
I entrust her to your care during the few
days she will remain here. I need say no
more—you know the feelings of a father,
for you have children; mine would be, in∣deed,
<PB N="211" REF="221"/>
deed, severe if I had less confidence in you."
He paused. La Voisin assured him, and
his tears bore testimony to his sincerity,
that he would do all he could to soften her
affliction, and that, if St. Aubert wished it,
he would even attend her into Gascony; an
offer so pleasing to St. Aubert, that he had
scarcely words to acknowledge his sense of
the old man's kindness, or to tell him, that
he accepted it. The scene, that followed
between St. Aubert and Emily, affected
La Voisin so much, that he quitted the
chamber, and she was again left alone with
her father, whose spirits seemed fainting fast,
but neither his senses, or his voice, yet failed
him; and, at intervals, he employed much
of these last awful moments in advising his
daughter, as to her future conduct. Per∣haps,
he never had thought more justly, or
expressed himself more clearly, than he did
now.</P>
<P>"Above all, my dear Emily," said he, "do
not indulge in the pride of fine feeling, the
romantic error of amiable minds. Those,
<PB N="212" REF="222"/>
who really possess sensibility, ought early to
be taught, that it is a dangerous quality,
which is continually extracting the excess of
misery, or delight, from every surrounding
circumstance. And, since, in our passage
through this world, painful circumstances
occur more frequently than pleasing ones,
and since our sense of evil is, I fear, more
acute than our sense of good, we become
the victims of our feelings, unless we can
in some degree command them. I know you
will say, (for you are young, my Emily)
I know you will say, that you are contented
sometimes to suffer, rather than to give up
your refined sense of happiness, at others;
but, when your mind has been long ha∣rassed by vicissitude, you will be content to
rest, and you will then recover from your
delusion. You will perceive, that the
phantom of happiness is exchanged for the
substance; for happiness arises in a state of
peace, not of tumult. It is of a temperate
and uniform nature, and can no more exist
in a heart, that is continually alive to mi∣nute
<PB N="213" REF="223"/>
circumstances, than in one that is dead
to feeling. You see, my dear, that, though
I would guard you against the dangers of
sensibility, I am not an advocate for apa∣thy.
At your age I should have said <HI>that</HI> is
a vice more hateful than all the errors of
sensibility, and I say so still. I call it a
<HI>vice,</HI> because it leads to positive evil; in
this, however, it does no more than an ill∣governed
sensibility, which, by such a rule,
might also be called a vice; but the evil of
the former is of more general consequence.
I have exhausted myself" said St. Aubert,
feebly, "and have wearied you, my Emily;
but, on a subject so important to your fu∣ture
comfort, I am anxious to be perfectly
understood."</P>
<P>Emily assured him, that his advice was
most precious to her, and that she would
never forget it, or cease from endeavouring
to profit by it. St. Aubert smiled affec∣tionately
and sorrowfully upon her. "I
repeat it," said he, "I would not teach you
to become insensible, if I could; I would
<PB N="214" REF="224"/>
only warn you of the evils of susceptibility,
and point out how you may avoid them.
Beware, my love, I conjure you, of that self∣delusion,
which has been fatal to the peace of
so many persons; beware of priding yourself
on the gracefulness of sensibility; if you
yield to this vanity, your happiness is lost
for ever. Always remember how much
more valuable is the strength of fortitude,
than the grace of sensibility. Do not,
however, confound fortitude with apathy;
apathy cannot know the virtue. Remem∣ber,
too, that one act of beneficence, one
act of real usefulness, is worth all the ab∣stract
sentiment in the world. Sentiment
is a disgrace, instead of an ornament, unless
it lead us to good actions. The miser,
who thinks himself respectable, merely be∣cause
he possesses wealth, and thus mistakes
the means of doing good, for the actual ac∣complishment
of it, is not more blameable
than the man of sentiment, without active
virtue. You may have observed persons,
who delight so much in this sort of sensibi∣lity
<PB N="215" REF="225"/>
to sentiment, which excludes that to the
calls of any practical virtue, that they turn
from the distressed, and, because their suf∣ferings
are painful to be contemplated, do
not endeavour to relieve them. How de∣spicable
is that humanity, which can be
contented to pity, where it might assuage!"</P>
<P>St. Aubert, some time after, spoke of
Madame Cheron, his sister. "Let me in∣form
you of a circumstance, that nearly
affects, your welfare," he added. "We
have, you know, had little intercourse for
some years; but, as she is now your only
female relation, I have thought it proper to
consign you to her care, as you will see in my
will, till yon are of age, and to recommend
you to her protection afterwards. She is
not exactly the person, to whom I would
have committed my Emily, but I had no
alternative, and I believe her to be upon
the whole—a good kind of woman. I
need not recommend it to your prudence,
my love, to endeavour to conciliate her
<PB N="216" REF="226"/>
kindness; you will do this for his sake, who
has often wished to do so for yours."</P>
<P>Emily assured him, that, whatever he re∣quested
she would religiously perform to
the utmost of her ability. "Alas!" added
she, in a voice interrupted by sighs, "that
will soon be all which remains for me; it will
be almost my only consolation to fulfil your
wishes."</P>
<P>St. Aubert looked up silently in her face,
as if he would have spoken, but his spirit
sunk a while, and his eyes became heavy
and dull. She felt that look at her heart.
"My dear father!" she exclaimed; and
then, checking herself, pressed his hand
closer, and hid her face with her handker∣chief.
Her tears were concealed, but St.
Aubert heard her convulsive sobs. His
spirits returned. "O my child!" said
he, faintly, "let my consolations be yours.
I die in peace; for I know, that I am about
to return to the bosom of my Father, who
will still be your Father, when I am gone.
<PB N="217" REF="227"/>
Always trust in him, my love, and he will
support you in these moments, as he sup∣ports
me."</P>
<P>Emily could only listen, and weep; but;
the extreme composure of his manner, and
the faith and hope he expressed, somewhat
soothed her anguish. Yet, whenever she
looked upon his emaciated countenance,
and saw the lines of death beginning to
prevail over it—saw his sunk eyes, still bent
on her, and their heavy lids pressing to a
close, there was a pang in her heart, such as
defied expression, though it required filial
virtue, like hers, to forbear the attempt.</P>
<P>He desired once more to bless her;
"Where are you, my dear?" said he, as he
stretched forth his hands. Emily had
turned to the window, that he might not
perceive her anguish; she now understood,
that his sight had failed him. When he
had given her his blessing, and it seemed to
be the last effort of expiring life, he sunk
back on his pillow. She kissed his fore∣head;
the damps of death had settled there,
<PB N="218" REF="228"/>
and, forgetting her fortitude for a moment,
her tears mingled with them. St. Aubert
lifted up his eyes; the spirit of a father re∣turned
to them, but it quickly vanished,
and he spoke no more.</P>
<P>St. Aubert lingered till about three
o'clock in the afternoon, and, thus gradu∣ally
sinking into death, he expired without
a struggle, or a sigh.</P>
<P>Emily was led from the chamber by La
Voisin and his daughter, who did what they
could to comfort her. The old man sat
and wept with her. Agnes was more erro∣neously
officious.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE monk, who had before appeared,
returned in the evening to offer consolation
to Emily, and brought a kind message from
the lady abbess, inviting her to the convent.
Emily, though she did not accept the offer,
returned an answer expressive of her grati∣tude.
The holy conversation of the friar,
whose mild benevolence of manners bore
some resemblance to those of St. Aubert,
soothed the violence of her grief, and lifted
her heart to the Being, who, extending
through all place and all eternity, looks
on the events of this little world as on
the shadows of a moment, and beholds
equally, and in the same instant, the soul
<PB N="220" REF="230"/>
that has passed the gates of death, and that,
which still lingers in the body. "In the sight
of God," said Emily, "my dear father now
exists, as truly as he yesterday existed to
me; it is to me only that he is dead; to God
and to himself he yet lives!"</P>
<P>The good monk left her more tranquil
than she had been since St. Aubert died;
and, before she retired to her little cabin for
the night, she trusted herself so far as to
visit the corpse. Silent, and without weep∣ing,
she stood by its side. The features,
placid and serene, told the nature of the last
sensations, that had lingered in the now de∣serted
frame. For a moment she turned
away, in horror of the stillness in which
death had fixed that countenance, never till
now seen otherwise than animated; then
gazed on it with a mixture of doubt and
awful astonishment. Her reason could
scarcely overcome an involuntary and un∣accountable
expectation of seeing that be∣loved
countenance still susceptible. She con∣tinued
to gaze wildly; took up the cold
<PB N="221" REF="231"/>
hand; spoke; still gazed, and then burst
into a transport of grief. La Voisin, hear∣ing
her sobs, came into the room to lead
her away, but she heard nothing, and only
begged that he would leave her.</P>
<P>Again alone, she indulged her tears, and,
when the gloom of evening obscured the
chamber, and almost veiled from her eyes
the object of her distress, she still hung over
the body; till her spirits, at length, were
exhausted, and she became tranquil. La
Voisin again knocked at the door, and en∣treated
that she would come to the common
apartment. Before she went, she kissed the
lips of St. Aubert, as she was wont to do
when she bade him good night. Again she
kissed them; her heart felt as if it would
break, a few tears of agony started to her
eyes, she looked up to heaven, then at St.
Aubert, and left the room.</P>
<P>Retired to her lonely cabin, her melan∣choly
thoughts still hovered round the body
of her deceased parent; and, when she sunk
into a kind of slumber, the images of her
<PB N="222" REF="232"/>
waking mind still haunted her fancy. She
thought she saw her father approaching her
with a benign countenance; then, smiling
mournfully and pointing upwards, his lips
moved, but, instead of words, she heard
sweet music borne on the distant air, and
presently saw his features glow with the
mild rapture of a superior being. The
strain seemed to swell louder, and she awoke.
The vision was gone, but music yet came
to her ear in strains such as angels might
breathe. She doubted, listened, raised her∣self
in the bed, and again listened. It was
music, and not an illusion of her imagina∣tion.
After a solemn steady harmony, it
paused; then rose again, in mournful sweet∣ness,
and then died, in a cadence, that seem∣ed
to bear away the listening soul to heaven.
She instantly remembered the music of the
preceding night, with the strange circum∣stances,
related by La Voisin, and the affect∣ing
conversation it had led to, concerning
the state of departed spirits. All that St.
Aubert had said, on that subject, now pressed
<PB N="223" REF="233"/>
upon her heart, and overwhelmed it. What
a change in a few hours! He, who then
could only conjecture, was now made ac∣quainted
with truth; was himself become
one of the departed! As the listened, she
was chilled with superstitious awe, her tears
stopped; and she rose, and went to the win∣dow.
All without was obscured in shade;
but Emily, turning her eyes from the massy
darkness of the woods, whose waving out∣line
appeared on the horizon, saw, on the
left, that effulgent planet, which the old
man had pointed out, setting over the woods.
She remembered what he had said concern∣ing
it, and, the music now coming at inter∣vals
on the air, she unclosed the casement to
listen to the strains, that soon gradually
sunk to a greater distance, and tried to dis∣cover
whence they came. The obscurity
prevented her from distinguishing any ob∣ject
on the green platform below; and the
sounds became fainter and fainter, till they
softened into silence. She listened, but they
returned no more. Soon after, she observed
<PB N="224" REF="234"/>
the planet trembling between the fringed
tops of the woods, and, in the next moment,
sink behind them. Chilled with a melan∣choly
awe, she retired once more to her bed,
and, at length, forgot for a while her sorrows
in sleep.</P>
<P>On the following morning, she was visited
by a sister of the convent, who came, with
kind offices and a second invitation from
the lady abbess; and Emily, though she
could not forsake the cottage, while the re∣mains
of her father were in it, consented,
however painful such a visit must be, in the
present state of her spirits, to pay her re∣spects
to the abbess, in the evening.</P>
<P>About an hour before sun-set, La Voisin
shewed her the way through the woods to
the convent, which stood in a small bay of
the Mediterranean, crowned by a woody
amphitheatre; and Emily, had she been less
unhappy, would have admired the extensive
sea view, that appeared from the green slope,
in front of the edifice, and the rich shores,
hung with woods and pastures, that extended
<PB N="225" REF="235"/>
on either hand. But her thoughts were now
occupied by one sad idea, and the features
of nature were to her colourless and without
form. The bell for vespers struck, as she
passed the ancient gate of the convent, and
seemed the funereal note for St. Aubert.
Little incidents affect a mind, enervated,
by sorrow; Emily, struggled against the
sickening faintness, that came over her,
and was led into the presence of the abbess,
who received her with an air of maternal,
tenderness; an air of such gentle solici∣tude
and consideration, as touched her with
an instantaneous gratitude; her eyes were
filled with tears, and the words she' would
have spoken faltered on her lips. The
abbess led her to a seat, and sat down beside
her, still holding her hand and regarding
her in silence, as Emily dried her tears and
attempted to speak. "Be composed, my
daughter," said the abbess in a soothing
voice, "do not speak yet; I know all you
would say. Your spirits must be soothed.
We are going to prayers;—will you attend:
<PB N="226" REF="236"/>
our evening service? It is comfortable, my
child, to look up in our afflictions to a fa∣ther,
who sees and pities us, and who chas∣tens
in his mercy."</P>
<P>Emily's tears flowed again, but a thousand
sweet emotions mingled with them. The
abbess suffered her to weep without in∣terruption,
and watched over her with a look
of benignity, that might have characterized
the countenance of a guardian angel. Emi∣ly,
when she became tranquil, was en∣couraged
to speak without reserve, and to
mention the motive, that made her unwill∣ing
to quit the cottage, which the abbess
did not oppose even by a hint; but praised
the filial piety of her conduct, and added a
hope, that she would pass a few days at the
convent, before she returned to La Vallée.
"You must allow yourself a little time to
recover from your first shock, my daughter,
before you encounter a second; I will not
affect to conceal from you how much I know
your heart must suffer, on returning to the
scene of your former happiness. Here, you
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
will have all, that quiet and sympathy and
religion can give, to restore your spirits. But
come," added she, observing the tears swell
in Emily's eyes, "we will go to the chapel."</P>
<P>Emily followed to the parlour, where the
nuns were assembled, to whom the abbess
committed her, saying, "This is a daugh∣ter,
for whom I have much esteem; be sisters
to her."</P>
<P>They passed on in a train to the chapel,
where the solemn devotion, with which the
service was performed, elevated her mind,
and brought to it the comforts of faith and
resignation.</P>
<P>Twilight came on, before the abbess's
kindness would suffer Emily to depart, when
she left the convent, with a heart much
lighter than she had entered it, and was re∣conducted
by La Voisin through the woods,
the pensive gloom of which was in unison
with the temper of her mind; and she pur∣sued
the little wild path, in musing silence,
till her guide suddenly stopped, looked
round, and then struck out of the path into
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
the high grass, saying he had mistaken the
road. He now walked on quickly, and
Emily, proceeding with difficulty over the
obscured and uneven ground, was left at
some distance, till her voice arrested him,
who seemed unwilling to stop, and still hur∣ried
on. "If you are in doubt about the
way," said Emily, "had we not better en∣quire
it at the chateau yonder, between the
trees?"</P>
<P>"No," replied La Voisin, "there is no
occasion. When we reach that brook,
ma'amselle, (you see the light upon the wa∣ter
there, beyond the woods) when we
reach that brook, we shall be at home pre∣sently.
I don't know how I happened to
mistake the path; I seldom come this way
after sun-set."</P>
<P>"It is solitary enough." said Emily, "but
you have no banditti here." "No, ma' am∣selle—no
banditti."</P>
<P>"What are you afraid of then, my good
friend? you are not superstitious?" "No,
not superstitious; but, to tell you the truth,
<PB N="229" REF="239"/>
lady, nobody likes to go near that chateau,
after dusk." "By whom is it inhabited,"
said Emily, "that it is so formidable?"
"Why, ma'amselle, it is scarcely inhabited,
for our lord the Marquis, and the lord of
all these fine woods, too, is dead. He had
not once been in it, for these many years,
and his people, who have the care of it, live
in a cottage close by." Emily now under∣stood
this to be the chateau, which La
Voisin had formerly pointed out, as having
belonged to the Marquis Villeroi, on the
mention of which her father had appeared
so much affected.</P>
<P>"Ah! it is a desolate place now," con∣tinued
La Voisin, "and such a grand, fine
place, as I remember it!" Emily enquired
what had occasioned this lamentable change;
but the old man was silent, and Emily,
whose interest was awakened by the fear he
had expressed, and above all by a recollec∣tion
of her father's agitation, repeated the
question, and added, "If you are neither
afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend,
<PB N="230" REF="240"/>
nor are superstitious, how happens it, that
you dread to pass near that chateau in the
dark?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps, then, I am a little superstitious,
ma'amselle; and, if you knew what I do,
you might be so too. Strange things have
happened there. Monsieur, your good fa∣ther,
appeared to have known the late Mar∣chioness."
"Pray inform me what did
happen?" said Emily, with much emotion.</P>
<P>"Alas! ma'amselle," answered La Voisin,
"enquire no further: it is not for me to lay
open the domestic secrets of my lord."—Emily,
surprised by the old man's words,
and his manner of delivering them, forbore
to repeat her question; a nearer interest, the
remembrance of St. Aubert, occupied her
thoughts, and she was led to recollect the
music she heard on the preceding night,
which she mentioned to La Voisin. "You
was not alone, ma'amselle, in this," he re∣plied,
"I heard it too; but I have so often
heard it, at the same hour, that I was scarcely
surprised."</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="241"/>
"You doubtless believe this music to
have some connection with the chateau,"
said Emily suddenly," and are, therefore,
superstitious." "It may be so, ma'amselle,
but there are other circumstances, belonging
to that chateau, which I remember, and sad∣ly
too." A heavy sigh followed: but Emi∣ly's
delicacy restrained the curiosity these
words revived, and she enquired no further.</P>
<P>On reaching the cottage, all the violence
of her grief returned; it seemed as if she had
escaped its heavy pressure only while she was
removed from the object of it. She passed
immediately to the chamber, where the re∣mains
of her father were laid, and yielded to
all the anguish of hopeless grief. La Voisin,
at length, persuaded her to leave the room,
and she returned to her own, where, ex∣hausted
by the sufferings of the day, she soon
fell into deep sleep, and awoke considerably
refreshed.</P>
<P>When the dreadful hour arrived, in which
the remains of St. Aubert were to be taken
from her for ever, she went alone to the
<PB N="232" REF="242"/>
chamber to look upon his countenance yet
once again, and La Voisin, who had waited
patiently below stairs, till her despair should
subside, with the respect due to grief, forbore
to interrupt the indulgence of it, till surprise,
at the length of her stay, and then appre∣hension
overcame his delicacy, and he went
to lead her from the chamber. Having tap∣ped
gently at the door, without receiving an
answer, he listened attentively, but all was
still; no sigh, no sob of anguish was heard.
Yet more alarmed by this silence, he opened
the door, and found Emily lying senseless∣across
the foot of the bed, near which stood
the coffin. His calls procured assistance,
and she was carried to her room, where pro∣per
applications, at length, restored her.</P>
<P>During her state of insensibility, La Voisin
had given directions for the coffin to be
closed, and he succeeded in persuading
Emily to forbear revisiting the chamber.
She, indeed, felt herself unequal to this, and
also perceived the necessity of sparing her
spirits, and recollecting fortitude sufficient to
<PB N="233" REF="243"/>
bear her through the approaching scene. St.
Aubert had given a particular injunction,
that his remains should be interred in the
church of the convent of St. Clair, and,
in mentioning the north chancel, near the
ancient tomb of the Villerois, had pointed
out the exact spot, where he wished to be
laid. The superior had granted this place for
the interment, and thither, therefore, the sad
procession now moved, which was met, at the
gates, by the venerable prièst, followed by a
train of friars. Every person, who heard the
solemn chant of the anthem, and the peal of
the organ, that struck up, when the body
entered the church, and saw also the feeble
steps, and the assumed tranquillity of Emily,
gave her involuntary tears. She shed none,
but walked, her face partly shaded by a thin
black veil, between two persons, who sup∣ported
her, preceded by the abbess, and
followed by nuns, whose plaintive voices
mellowed the swelling harmony of the dirge.
When the procession came to the grave the
music ceased. Emily drew the veil entirely
<PB N="234" REF="244"/>
over her face, and, in a momentary pause,
between the anthem and the rest of the ser∣vice,
her sobs were distinctly audible. The
holy father began the service, and Emily
again commanded her feelings, till the coffin
was let down, and she heard the earth rattle
on its lid. Then, as she shuddered, a groan
burst from her heart, and she leaned for
support on the person who stood next to
her. In a few moments she recovered; and,
when she heard those affecting and sublime
words: "His body is buried in peace, and
his soul returns to Him that gave it," her
anguish softened into tears.</P>
<P>The abbess led her from the church into
her own parlour, and there administered all
the consolations, that religion and gentle
sympathy can give. Emily struggled against
the pressure of grief; but the abbess, ob∣serving
her attentively, ordered a bed to be
prepared, and recommended her to retire to
repose. She also kindly claimed her promise
to remain a few days at the convent, and Emi∣ly,
who had no wish to return to the cottage,
<PB N="235" REF="245"/>
the scene of all her sufferings, had leisure,
now that no immediate care pressed upon her
attention, to feel the indisposition, which
disabled her from immediately travelling.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the maternal kindness of the
abbess, and the gentle attentions of the nuns
did all, that was possible, towards soothing
her spirits and restoring her health. But the
latter was too deeply wounded, through the
medium of her mind, to be quickly revived.
She lingered for some weeks at the convent,
under the insluence of a slow fever, wishing
to return home, yet unable to go thither;
often even reluctant to leave the spot where
her father's relics were deposited, and some∣times
soothing herself with the consideration,
that, if she died here, her remains would re∣pose
beside those of St. Aubert. In the mean∣while,
she sent letters to Madame Cheron
and to the old housekeeper, informing them
of the sad event, that had taken place, and
of her own situation. From her aunt she
received an answer, abounding more in com∣mon-place
condolement, than in traits of
<PB N="236" REF="246"/>
real sorrow, which assured her, that a servant
should be sent to conduct her to La Vallèe,
for that her own time was so much occupied
by company, that she had no leisure to under∣take
so long a journey. However Emily
might prefer La Vallèe to Tholouse, she
could not be insensible of the indecorous
and unkind conduct of her aunt, in suffer∣ing
her to return thither, where she had no
longer a relation to console and protect her; a
conduct, which was the more culpable, since
St. Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron
the guardian of his orphan daughter.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron's servant made the at∣tendance
of the good La Voisin unnecessary;
and Emily, who felt sensibly her obligations
to him, for all his kind attention to her late
father, as well as to herself, was glad to spare
him a long, and what, at his time of life,
must have been a troublesome journey.</P>
<P>During her stay at the convent, the peace
and sanctity that reigned within, the tranquil
beauty of the scenery without, and the de∣licate
<PB N="237" REF="247"/>
attentions of the abbess and the nuns,
were circumstances so soothing to her mind,
that they almost tempted her to leave a
world, where she had lost her dearest friends,
and devote herself to the cloister, in a spot,
rendered sacred to her by containing the tomb
of St. Aubert. The pensive enthusiasm, too,
so natural to her temper, had spread a beau∣tiful
illusion over the sanctified retirement of
a nun, that almost hid from her view the
selfishness of its security. But the touches,
which a melancholy fancy, slightly tinctured
with superstition, gave to the monastic scene,
began to fade, as her spirits revived, and
brought once more to her heart an image,
which had only transiently been banished
thence. By this she was silently awakened
to hope and comfort and sweet affections;
visions of happiness gleamed faintly at a
distance, and, though she knew them to be
illusions, she could not resolve to shut them
out for ever. It was the remembrance of
Valancourt, of his taste, his genius, and of
the countenance which glowed with both,
<PB N="238" REF="248"/>
that, perhaps, alone determined her to return
to the world. The grandeur and sublimity
of the scenes, amidst which they had first met,
had fascinated her fancy, and had imper∣ceptibly
contributed to render Valancourt
more interesting by seeming to communicate
to him somewhat of their own character.
The esteem, too, which St. Aubert had re∣peatedly
expressed for him, sanctioned this
kindness; but, though his countenance and
manner had continually expressed his admi∣ration
of her, he had no otherwise declared
it; and even the hope of seeing him again
was so distant, that she was scarcely con∣scious
of it, still less that it influenced her
conduct on this occasion.</P>
<P>It was several days after the arrival of
Madame Cheron's servant before Emily was
sufficiently recovered to undertake the jour∣ney
to La Vallée. On the evening pre∣ceding
her departure, she went to the cot∣tage
to take leave of La Voisin and his fa∣mily,
and to make them a return for their
kindness. The old man she found sitting
<PB N="239" REF="249"/>
on a bench at his door, between his daugh∣ter,
and his son-in-law, who was just return∣ed
from his daily labour, and who was play∣ing
upon a pipe, that, in tone, resembled
an oboe. A flask of wine stood beside the
old man, and, before him, a small table with
fruit and bread, round which stood several
of his grandsons, fine rosy children, who
were taking their supper, as their mother
distributed it. On the edge of the little
green, that spread before the cottage, were
cattle and a few sheep reposing under the
trees. The landscape was touched with the
mellow light of the evening sun, whose long
slanting beams played through a vista of
the woods, and lighted up the distant turrets
of the chateau. She paused a moment, be∣fore
she emerged from the shade, to gaze
upon the happy group before her—on the
complacency and ease of healthy age, de∣pictured
on the countenance of La Voisin;
the maternal tenderness of Agnes, as she
looked upon her children, and the inno∣cency
of infantine pleasures, reflected in their
<PB N="240" REF="250"/>
smiles. Emily looked again at the venc∣rable
old man, and at the cottage; the, me∣mory
of her father rose with full force upon
her mind, and she hastily stepped forward,
afraid to trust herself with a longer pause.
She took an affectionate and affecting leave of
La Voisin and his family; he seemed to love
her as his daughter, and shed tears; Emily
shed many. She avoided going into the cot∣tage,
since she knew it would revive emo∣tions,
such as she could not now endure.</P>
<P>One painful scene yet awaited her, for
she determined to visit again her father's
grave; and that she might not be interrupted,
or observed in the indulgence of her melan∣choly
tenderness, she deferred her visit, till
every inhabitant of the convent, except the
nun who promised to bring her the key of
the church, should be retired to rest. Emily
remained in her chamber, till she heard the
convent bell strike twelve, when the nun
came, as she had appointed, with the key of
a private door, that opened into the church,
and they descended together the narrow
<PB N="241" REF="251"/>
winding stair-case, that led thither. The
nun offered to accompany Emily to the
grave, adding, "It is melancholy to go
alone at this hour;" but the former, thank∣ing
her for the consideration, could not con∣sent
to have any witness of her sorrow; and
the sister, having unlocked the door, gave
her the lamp. "You will remember, sister,"
said she, "that in the east aisle, which you
must pass, is a newly opened grave; hold
the light to the ground, that you may not
stumble over the loose earth." Emily,
thanking her again, took the lamp, and,
stepping into the church, sister Mariette de∣parted.
But Emily paused a moment at
the door; a sudden fear came over her, and
she returned to the foot of the stair-case,
where, as she heard the steps of the nun as∣cending,
and, while she held up the lamp, saw
her black veil waving over the spiral balus∣ters,
she was tempted to call her back. While
she hesitated, the veil disappeared, and, in
the next moment, ashamed of her fears, she
returned to the church. The cold air of the
<PB N="242" REF="252"/>
aisles chilled her, and their deep silence and
extent, feebly shone upon by the moon-light,
that streamed through a distant gothic win∣dow,
would at any other time have awed her
into superstition; now, grief occupied all her
attention. She scarcely heard the whisper∣ing
echoes of her own steps, or thought of
the open grave, till she found herself almost
on its brink. A friar of the convent had
been buried there on the preceding evening,
and, as she had sat alone in her chamber at
twilight, she heard, at distance, the monks
chanting the requiem for his soul. This
brought freshly to her memory the circum∣stances
of her father's death; and, as the
voices, mingling with a low querulous peal of
the organ, swelled faintly, gloomy and affect∣ing
visions had arisen upon her mind. Now
she remembered them, and, turning aside to
avoid the broken ground, these recollections
made her pass on with quicker steps to the
grave of St. Aubert, when in the moon∣light,
that fell athwart a remote part of the
aisle, she thought she saw a shadow gliding
<PB N="243" REF="253"/>
between the pillars. She stopped to listen,
and, not hearing any footstep, believed
that her fancy had deceived her, and, no
longer apprehensive of being observed, pro∣ceeded.
St. Aubert was buried beneath a
plain marble, bearing little more than his
name and the date of his birth and death,
near the foot of the stately monument of the
Villerois. Emily remained at his grave,
till a chime, that called the monks to early
prayers, warned her to retire; then, she wept
over it a last farewel, and forced herself
from the spot. After this hour of melan∣choly
indulgence, she was refreshed by a
deeper sleep, than she had experienced for a
long time, and, on awakening, her mind was
more tranquil and resigned, than it had been
since St. Aubert's death.</P>
<P>But, when the moment of her departure
from the convent arrived, all her grief re∣turned;
the memory of the dead, and the
kindness of the living attached her to the
place; and for the sacred spot, where her
father's remains were interred, she seemed to
<PB N="244" REF="254"/>
feel all those tender affections which we con∣ceive
for home. The abbess repeated many
kind assurances of regard at their parting,
and pressed her to return, if ever she should
find her condition elsewhere unpleasant;
many of the nuns also expressed unaffected
regret at her departure, and Emily left the
convent with many tears, and followed by
sincere wishes for her happiness.</P>
<P>She had travelled several leagues, before
the scenes of the country, through which
she passed, had power to rouse her for a mo∣ment
from the deep melancholy, into which
she was sunk, and, when they did, it was only
to remind her, that, on her last view of them,
St. Aubert was at her side, and to call up to
herremembrance the remarks he had delivered
on similar scenery. Thus, without any parti∣cular
occurrence, passed the day in languor
and dejection. She slept that night at a
town on the skirts of Languedoc, and, on
the following morning, entered Gascony.</P>
<P>Towards the close of this day, Emily
came within view of the plains in the neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="245" REF="255"/>
of La Vallée, and the well-known
objects of former times began to press upon
her notice, and with them recollections,
that awakened all her tenderness and grief.
Often, while she looked through her tears
upon the wild grandeur of the Pyrenées,
now varied with the rich lights and shadows
of evening, she remembered, that, when last
she saw them, her father partook with her
of the pleasure they inspired. Suddenly
some scene, which he had particularly
pointed out to her, would present itself,
and the sick languor of despair would steal
upon her heart. "There!" she would ex∣claim,
"there are the very cliffs, there the
wood of pines, which he looked at with such
delight, as we passed this road together for
the last time. There, too, under the crag
of that mountain, is the cottage, peeping
from among the cedars, which he bade me
remember, and copy with my pencil. O
my father, shall I never see you more!"</P>
<P>As she drew near the chateau, these me∣lancholy
memorials of past times multiplied.
<PB N="246" REF="256"/>
At length, the chateau itself appeared amid
the glowing beauty of St. Aubert's fa∣vourite
landscape. This was an object,
which called for fortitude, not for tears;
Emily dried hers, and prepared to meet
with calmness the trying moment of her re∣turn
to that home, where there was no
longer a parent to welcome her. "Yes,"
said she, "let me not forget the lessons he
has taught me! How often he has pointed
out the necessity of resisting even virtuous
sorrow; how often we have admired toge∣ther
the greatness of a mind, that can at
once suffer and reason! O my father! if
you are permitted to look down upon, your
child, it will please you to see, that she re∣members,
and endeavours to practise, the
precepts you have given her."</P>
<P>A turn on the road now allowed a nearer
view of the chateau, the chimneys, tipped
with light, rising from, behind St. Aubert's
favourite oaks, whose foliage partly con∣cealed
the lower part of the building. Emily
could not suppress a heavy sigh. "This,
<PB N="247" REF="257"/>
too, was his favourite hour," said she, as
she gazed upon the long evening shadows,
stretched athwart the landscape. "How
deep the repose, how lovely the scene!
lovely and tranquil as in former days!"</P>
<P>Again she resisted the pressure of sor∣row,
till her ear caught the gay melody of
the dance, which she had so often listened
to, as she walked with St. Aubert, on the
margin of the Garonne, when all her forti∣tude
forsook her, and she continued to
weep, till the carriage stopped at the little
gate, that opened upon what was now her
own territory. She raised her eyes on the
sudden stopping of the carriage, and saw
her father's old housekeeper coming to open
the gate. Manchon also came running,
and barking before her; and, when his
young mistress alighted, fawned, and played
round her, gasping with joy."</P>
<P>"Dear ma'amselle!" said Theresa, and
paused, and looked as is she would have of∣fered
something of condolement to Emily,
whose tears now prevented reply. The dog
<PB N="246" REF="258"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="247" REF="259"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="248" REF="260"/>
still fawned and ran round her, and then
flew towards the carriage, with a short
quick bark. "Ah, ma'amslle!—my poor
master!" said Theresa, whose feelings were
more awakened than her delicacy, "Man∣chon's
gone to look for him." Emily
sobbed aloud; and, on looking towards
the carriage, which still stood with the door
open, saw the animal spring into it, and in∣stantly
leap out, and then with his nose on
the ground run round the horses.</P>
<P>"Don't cry so, ma'amselle," said The∣resa,
"it breaks my heart to see you." The
dog now came running to Emily, then re∣turned
to the carriage, and then back again
to her, whining and discontented. "Poor
rogue!" said Theresa, "thou hast lost thy
master, thou mayst well cry! But come,
my dear young lady, be comforted. What
shall I get to refresh you?" Emily gave
her hand to the old servant, and tried to re∣strain
her grief, while she made some kind
enquiries concerning her health. But she
still lingered in the walk which led to the
<PB N="249" REF="261"/>
chateau, for within was no person to meet her
with the kiss of affection; her own heart no
longer palpitated with impatient joy to
meet again the well-known smile, and she
dreaded to see objects, which would recall
the full remembrance of her sormer happi∣ness.
She moved slowly towards the door,
paused, went on, and paused again. How
silent, how forsaken, how forlorn did the
chateau appear! Trembling to enter it, yet
blaming herself for delaying what she could
not avoid, she, at length, patted into the
hall; crossed it with a hurried step, as if
afraid to look round, and opened the door
of that room, which she was wont to call
her own. The gloom of evening gave so∣lemnity
to its silent and deserted air. The
chairs, the tables, every article of furniture,
so familiar to her in happier times, spoke
eloquently to her heart. She seated herself,
without immediately observing it, in a win∣dow,
which opened upon the garden, and
where St. Aubert had often sat with her,
watching the sun retire from the rich and
<PB N="250" REF="262"/>
extensive prospect, that appeared beyond
the groves.</P>
<P>Having indulged her tears for some time,
she became more composed; and, when
Theresa, after seeing the baggage deposited
in her lady's room, again appeared, she had
so far recovered her spirits, as to be able to
converse with her.</P>
<P>"I have made up the green bed for you,
ma'amselle," said Theresa, as she set the cof∣fee
upon the table. "I thought you would
like it better than your own now; but I
little thought this day month, that you
would come back alone. A-well-a-day!
the news almost broke my heart, when
it did come. Who would have believed,
that my poor master, when he went from,
home, would never return again!" Emily
hid her face with her handkerchief, and
waved her hand.</P>
<P>"Do taste the coffee, said Theresa.
"My dear young lady, be comforted—we
must all die. My dear master is a saint
above." Emily took the handkerchief
<PB N="251" REF="263"/>
from her face, and raised her eyes full of
tears towards heaven; soon after she dried
them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice,
began to enquire concerning some of her
late father's pensioners.</P>
<P>"Alas-a-day!" said Theresa, as she
poured out the cossee, and handed it to her
mistress, "all that could come, have been
here every day to enquire after you and my
master." She then proceeded to tell, that
some were dead whom they had left well;
and others, who were ill, had recovered.
"And see, ma'amselle," added Theresa,
"there is old Mary coming up the garden
now; she has looked every day these three
years as if she would die, yet she is alive still.
She has seen the chaise at the door, and
knows you are come home."</P>
<P>The sight of this poor old woman would
have been too much for Emily, and she beg∣ged
Theresa would go and tell her, that she
was too ill to see any person that night.
"To-morrow I shall be better, perhaps;
<PB N="252" REF="264"/>
but give her this token of my remem∣brance."</P>
<P>Emily sat for some time, given up to sor∣row.
Not an object, on which her eye
glanced, but awakened some remembrance,
that led immediately to the subject of her
grief. Her favourite plants, which St. Au∣bert
had taught her to nurse; the little
drawings, that adorned the room, which
his taste had instructed her to execute; the
books, that he had selected for her use, and
which they had read together; her musical
instruments, whose sounds he loved so well,
and which he sometimes awakened himself—every
object gave new force to sorrow.
At length, she roused herself from this me∣lancholy
indulgence, and, summoning all
her resolution, stepped forward to go into
those forlorn rooms, which, though she
dreaded to enter, she knew would yet more
powerfully affect her, if she delayed to visit
them.</P>
<P>Having passed through the green-house,
her courage for a moment forsook her, when
<PB N="253" REF="265"/>
she opened the door of the library; and, per∣haps,
the shade, which evening and the fo∣liage
of the trees near the windows threw
across the room, heightened the solemnity of
her feelings on entering that apartment, where
every thing spoke of her father. There
was an arm-chair, in which he used to
sit; she shrunk when she observed it, for she
had so often seen him seated there, and the
idea of him rose so distinctly to her mind,
that she almost fancied she saw him before
her. But she checked the illusions of a
distempered imagination, though she could
not subdue a certain degree of awe, which
now mingled with her emotions. She
walked slowly to the chair, and seated her∣self
in it; there was a reading-desk before
it, on which lay a book open, as it had been
left by her father. It was some moments
before she recovered courage enough to ex∣amine
it; and, when she looked at the open
page, she immediately recollected, that St.
Aubert, on the evening before his departure
from the chateau, had read to her some pas∣sages
<PB N="254" REF="266"/>
from this his favourite author. The
circumstance now affected her extremely;
she looked at the page, wept, and looked
again. To her the book appeared sacred
and invaluable, and she would not have
moved it, or closed the page, which he had
left open, for the treasures of the Indies.
Still she sat before the desk, and could not
resolve to quit it, though the increasing
gloom, and the profound silence of the
apartment, revived a degree of painful awe.
Her thoughts dwelt on the probable state
of departed spirits, and she remembered the
affecting conversation, which had passed
between St. Aubert and La Voisin, on the
night preceding his death.</P>
<P>As she mused she saw the door slowly
open, and a rustling sound in a remote part
of the room startled her. Through the
dusk she thought she perceived something
move. The subject she had been consider∣ing,
and the present tone of her spirits,
which made her imagination respond to
every impression of her senses, gave her a
<PB N="255" REF="267"/>
sudden terror of something supernatural.
She sat for a moment motionless, and then,
her dissipated reason returning, "What
should I fear?" said she. "It the spirits
of those we love ever return to us, it is in
kindness."</P>
<P>The silence, which again reigned, made
her ashamed of her late fears, and she be∣lieved,
that her imagination had deluded
her, or that she had heard one of those unac∣countable
noises, which sometimes occur in
old houses. The same sound, however, re∣turned;
and, distinguishing something mov∣ing
towards her, and in the next instant
press beside her into the chair, she shrieked;
but her fleeting senses were instantly re∣called,
on perceiving that it was Manchon
who sat by her, and who now licked her
hands affectionately.</P>
<P>Perceiving her spirits unequal to the talk
she had assigned herself of visiting the de∣serted
rooms of the chateau, this night,
when she left the library, she walked into the
garden, and down to the terrace, that over∣hung
<PB N="256" REF="268"/>
the river. The sun was now set; but,
under the dark branches of the almond
trees, was seen the saffron glow of the west,
spreading beyond the twilight of middle
air. The bat slitted silently by; and, now
and then, the mourning note of the nightin∣gale
was heard. The circumstances of the
hour brought to her recollestion some lines,
which she had once heard St. Aubert recite
on this very spot, and she had now a melan∣choly
plesure in repeating them.</P>

<P><PB N="257" REF="269"/>
Emily, wandering on, came to St. Au∣bert's
favourite plane-tree, where so often,
at this hour, they had sat beneath the shade
together, and with her dear mother so
often had conversed on the subject of a su∣ture
state. How often, too, had her father
expressed the comfort he derived from be∣lieving,
that they should meet in another
world! Emily, overcome by these recollec∣tions,
left the plane-tree, and, as she leaned
pensively on the wall of the terrace, she
observed a group of peasants dancing gaily
on the banks of the Garonne, which spread
in broad expanse below, and reflected
the evening light. What a contrast they
formed to the desolate, unhappy Emily!
They were gay and <HI>debonnaire,</HI> as they were
wont to be when she, too, was gay—when
St. Aubert used to listen to their merry mu∣sic,
with a countenance beaming pleasure
and benevolence. Emily, having looked
for a moment on this sprightly band, turned
away, unable to bear the remembrances it
excited; but where, alas! could she turn,
<PB N="258" REF="270"/>
and not meet new objects to give acuteness
to grief?</P>
<P>As she walked slowly towards the house,
she was met by Theresa. "Dear ma'am∣selle,"
said she, "I have been seeking you
up and down this half hour, and was afraid
some accident had happened to you. How
can you like to wander about so in this
night air! Do come into the house. Think
what my poor master would have said, if
he could see you. I am sure, when my
dear lady died, no gentleman could take it
more to heart than he did, yet you know he
seldom shed a tear."</P>
<P>"Pray, Theresa, cease," said Emily, wish∣ing
to interrupt this ill-judged, but well-mean∣ing
harangue; Theresa's loquacity, however,
was not to be silenced so easily. "And
when you used to grieve so," she added,
"he often told you how wrong it was—for
that my mistress was happy. And, if she
was happy, I am sure he is so too; for the
prayers of the poor, they say, reach hea∣ven."
During this speech, Emily had
<PB N="259" REF="271"/>
walked silently into the chateau, and The∣resa
lighted her across the hall into the com∣mon
sitting parlour, where she had laid the
cloth, with one solitary knife and fork, for
supper. Emily was in the room before she
perceived that it was not her own apartment,
but she checked the emotion which inclined
her to leave it, and seated herself quietly by
the little supper table. Her father's hat
hung upon the opposite wall; while she
gazed at it, a faintness came over her.
Theresa looked at her, and then at the ob∣ject,
on which her eyes were settled, and
went to remove it; but Emily waved her
hand—"No," said she, "let it remain. I
am going to my chamber." "Nay, ma'am∣selle,
supper is ready." "I cannot take
it," replied Emily, "I will go to my room,
and try to sleep. To-morrow I shall be
better."</P>
<P>"This is poor doings!" said Theresa.
"Dear lady! do take some food! I have
dressed a pheasant, and a fine one it is. Old
Monsieur Barreaux sent it this morning, for
<PB N="260" REF="272"/>
I saw him yesterday, and told him you were
coming. And I know nobody that seemed
more concerned, when he heard the sad
news, than he."</P>
<P>"Did he?" said Emily, in a tender voice,
while she felt her poor heart warmed for a
moment by a ray of sympathy.</P>
<P>At length, her spirits were entirely over∣come,
and she retired to her room.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY, some time after her return to
La Vallée, received letters from her aunt,
Madame Cheron, in which, after some com∣mon-place
condolement and advice, she in∣vited
her to Tholouse, and added, that, as
her late brother had entrusted Emily's <HI>edu∣cation</HI>
to her, she should consider herself
bound to overlook her conduct. Emily, at
this time, wished only to remain at La Val∣lée,
<PB N="262" REF="274"/>
in the scenes of her early happiness
now rendered infinitely dear to her, as the
late residence of those, whom she had lost
for ever, where she could weep unobserved,
retrace their steps, and remember each mi∣nute
particular of their manners. But she
was equally anxious to avoid the displeasure
of Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>Though her affection would not suffer her
to question, even a moment, the propriety
of St. Aubert's conduct in appointing Ma∣dame
for her guardian, she was sensible, that
this step had made her happiness depend,
in a great degree, on the humour of her aunt.
In her reply, she begged permission to re∣main,
at present, at La Vallée, mentioning
the extreme dejection of her spirits, and the
necessity she felt for quiet and retirement to
restore them. These she knew were not to
be found at Madame Cheron's, whose in∣clinations
led her into a life of dissipation,
which her ample fortune encouraged; and,
having given her answer, she felt somewhat
more at ease.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="275"/>
In the first days of her affliction, she was
visited by Monsieur Barreaux, a sincere
mourner for St. Aubert. "I may well la∣ment
my friend," said he, "for I shall never
meet with his resemblance. If I could have
found such a man in what is called society,
I should not have left it."</P>
<P>M. Barreaux's admiration of her father
endeared him extremely to Emily, whose
heart found almost its first relief in conver∣sing
of her parents, with a man, whom she
so much revered, and who, though with
such an ungracious appearance, possessed so
much goodness of heart and delicacy of
mind.</P>
<P>Several weeks passed away in quiet retire∣ment,
and Emily's affliction began to soften
into melancholy. She could bear to read
the books she had before read with her
father; to sit in his chair in the library—to
watch the flowers his hand had planted—to
awaken the tones of that instrument his fin∣gers
had pressed, and sometimes even to play
his favourite air.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="276"/>
When her mind had recovered from the
first shock of affliction, perceiving the dan∣ger
of yielding to indolence, and that activity
alone could restore its tone, she scrupulously
endeavoured to pass all her hours in em∣ployment.
And it was now that she under∣stood
the full value of the education she had
received from St. Aubert, for in cultivating
her understanding he had secured her an
asylum from indolence, without recourse to
dissipation, and rich and varied amusement
and information, independent of the society,
from which her situation secluded her. Nor
were the good effects of this education con∣fined
to selfish advantages, since, St. Aubert
having nourished every amiable quality of
her heart, it now expanded in benevolence
to all around her, and taught her, when she
could not remove the misfortunes of others,
at lead to soften them by sympathy and ten∣derness;—a
benevolence that taught her to
feel for all, that could suffer.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron returned no answer to
Emily's letter, who began to hope, that she
<PB N="265" REF="277"/>
should be permitted to remain some time
longer in her retirement, and her mind had
now so far recovered its strength, that she
ventured to view the scenes, which most
powerfully recalled the images of part times.
Among these was the fishing-house; and,
to indulge still more the affectionate melan∣choly
of the visit, she took thither her lute,
that she might again hear there the tones, to
which St. Aubert and her mother had so
often delighted to listen. She went alone,
and at that still hour of the evening, which
is so soothing to fancy and to grief. The
last time she had been here she was in com∣pany
with Monsieur and Madame St. Aubert,
a few days preceding that, on which
the latter was seized with a fatal illness.
Now, when Emily again entered the woods,
that surrounded the building, they awakened
so forcibly the memory of former times,
that her resolution yielded for a moment to
excess of grief. She stopped, leaned for
support against a tree, and wept for some
minutes, before she had recovered herself
<PB N="266" REF="278"/>
sufficiently to proceed. The little path, that
led to the building, was overgrown with
grass, and the flowers which St. Aubert had
scattered carelessly along the border were al∣most
choked with weeds—the tall thistle—the
fox-glove, and the nettle. She often
paused to look on the desolate spot, now so
silent and forsaken, and when, with a trem∣bling
hand, she opened the door of the fish∣ing-house,
"Ah!" said she, "every thing—every
thing remains as when I left it last—left
it with those who never must return!"
She went to a window, that overhung the
rivulet, and, leaning over it, with her eyes
fixed on the current, was soon lost in melan∣choly
reverie. The lute she had brought
lay forgotten beside her; the mournful sigh∣ing
of the breeze, as it waved the high pines
above, and its softer whispers among the
osiers, that bowed upon the banks below,
was a kind of music more in unison with
her feelings. It did not vibrate on the
chords of unhappy memory, but was sooth∣ing
to the heart as the voice of Pity. She
<PB N="267" REF="279"/>
continued to muse, unconscious of the gloom
of evening, and that the sun's last light
trembled on the heights above, and would
probably have remained so much longer, if
a sudden footstep, without the building, had
not alarmed her attention, and first made
her recollect that she was unprotected. In
the next moment, a door opened, and a
stranger appeared, who stopped on perceive∣ing
Emily, and then began to apologize for
his intrusion. But Emily, at the sound of
his voice, lost her fear in a stronger emo∣tion;
its tones were familiar to her ear, and,
though she could not readily distinguish
through the dusk the features of the person
who spoke, she felt a remembrance too
strong to be distrusted.</P>
<P>He repeated his apology, and Emily then said
something in reply, when the stranger,
eagerly advancing, exclaimed, "Good God!
can it be—surely I am not mistaken—ma'amselle
St. Aubert—is it not?"</P>
<P>"It is indeed," said Emily, who was
confirmed in her first conjecture, for she
<PB N="268" REF="280"/>
now distinguished the countenance of Va∣lancourt,
lighted up with still more than its
usual animation. A thousand painful re∣collections
crowded to her mind, and the
effort, which she made to support herself,
only served to increase her agitation. Va∣lancourt,
meanwhile, having enquired anxi∣ously
after her health, and expressed his
hopes, that M. St. Aubert had found benefit
from travelling, learned from the flood of
tears, which she could no longer repress,
the fatal truth. He led her to a seat, and
sat down by her, while Emily continued to
weep, and Valancourt to hold the hand,
which she was unconscious he had taken,
till it was wet with the tears, which grief for
St. Aubert and sympathy for herself had
called forth.</P>
<P>"I feel," said he at length, "I feel how
insufficient all attempt at consolation must
be on this subject. I can only mourn with
you, for I cannot doubt the source of your tears.
Would to God I were mistaken!"</P>
<P>Emily could still answer only by tears,
<PB N="269" REF="281"/>
till she rose, and begged they might leave
the melancholy spot, when Valancourt,
though he saw her feebleness, could not
offer to detain her, but took her arm with∣in
his, and led her from the fishing-house.
They walked silently through the woods,
Valancourt anxious to know, yet fearing to
ask any particulars concerning St. Aubert;
and Emily too much distressed to converse.
After some time, however, she acquired for∣titude
enough to speak of her father, and to
give a brief account of the manner of his
death; during which recital Valancourt's
countenance betrayed strong emotion, and,
when he heard that St. Aubert had died on
the road, and that Emily had been left
among strangers, he pressed her hand be∣tween
his, and involuntarily exclaimed,
"Why was I not there!" but in the next
moment recollected himself, for he imme∣diately
returned to the mention of her fa∣ther;
till, perceiving that her spirits were
exhausted, he gradually changed the subject,
and spoke of himself. Emily thus learned,
<PB N="270" REF="282"/>
that, after they had parted, he had wan∣dered,
for some time, along the shores of
the Mediterranean, and had then returned
through Languedoc into Gascony, which
was his native province, and where he usually
resided.</P>
<P>When he had concluded his little narra∣tive,
he sunk into a silence, which Emily was
not disposed to interrupt, and it continued,
till they reached the gate of the chateau,
when he stopped, as if he had known
this to be the limit of his walk. Here, saying,
that it was his intention to return to Estu∣viere
on the following day, he asked her if
she would permit him to take leave of her
in the morning; and Emily, perceiving that
she could not reject an ordinary civility,
without expressing by her refusal an expec∣tation
of something more, was compelled to
answer, that she should be at home.</P>
<P>She passed a melancholy evening, during
which the retrospect of all that had hap∣pened,
since she had seen Valancourt, would
rise to her imagination; and the scene of her
<PB N="271" REF="283"/>
father's death appeared in tints as fresh, as
if it had passed on the preceding day. She
remembered particularly the earnest and so∣lemn
manner, in which he had required her
to destroy the manuscript papers, and, awa∣kening
from the lethargy, in which sorrow
had held her, she was shocked to think she
had not yet obeyed him, and determined,
that another day should not reproach her
with the neglect.</P>

<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the next morning, Emily ordered a
fire to be lighted in the stove of the cham∣ber,
where St. Aubert used to sleep; and,
as soon as she had breakfasted, went thi∣ther
to burn the papers. Having fastened
the door to prevent interruption, she opened
the closet where they were concealed, as
she entered which, she felt an emotion of
unusual awe, and stood for some moments
surveying it, trembling, and almost afraid
to remove the board. There was a great
chair in one corner of the closet, and, op∣posite
to it, stood the table, at which she
had seen her father sit, on the evening
that preceded his departure, looking over,
<PB N="273" REF="285"/>
with so much emotion, what she believed
to be these very papers.</P>
<P>The solitary life, which Emily had led
of late, and the melancholy subjects, on
which she had suffered her thoughts to dwell,
had rendered her at times sensible to the
"thick-coming fancies" of a mind greatly
enervated. It was lamentable, that her ex∣cellent
understanding should have yielded,
even for a moment, to the reveries of su∣perstition,
or rather to those starts of ima∣gination,
which deceive the senses into what
can be called nothing less than momentary
madness. Instances of this temporary failure
of mind had more than once occurred since
her return home; particularly when, wan∣dering
through this lonely mansion in the
evening twilight, she had been alarmed by
appearances, which would have been un∣seen
in her more cheerful days. To this in∣firm
state of her nerves may be attributed,
what, she imagined, when, her eyes glancing
a second time on the arm-chair, which
stood in an obscure part of the closet, the
<PB N="274" REF="286"/>
countenance of her dead father appeared
there. Emily stood fixed for a moment to
the floor, after which she left the closet. Her
spirits, however, soon returned; she re∣proached
herself with the weakness of thus
suffering interruption in an act of serious
importance, and again opened the door.
By the directions which St. Aubert had
given her, she readily found the board he
had described in an opposite corner of the
closet, near the window; she distinguished
also the line he had mentioned, and, pres∣sing
it as he had bade her, it slid down,
and disclosed the bundle of papers, together
with some scattered ones, and the purse of
louis. With a trembling hand she re∣moved
them, replaced the board, paused a
moment, and was rising from the floor,
when, on looking up, there appeared to
her alarmed fancy the same countenance in
the chair. The illusion, another instance
of the unhappy effect which solitude and
grief had gradually produced upon her
mind, subdued her spirits; she rushed for∣ward
<PB N="275" REF="287"/>
into the chamber, and sunk almost
senseless into a chair. Returning reason
soon overcame the dreadful, but pitiable at∣tack
of imagination, and she turned to the
papers, though still with so little recollect∣tion,
that her eyes involuntarily settled on
the writing of some loose sheets, which lay
open; and she was unconscious, that she
was transgressing her father's strict injunc∣tion,
till a sentence of dreadful import
awakened her attention and her memory to∣gether.
She hastily put the papers from
her; but the words, which had roused
equally her curiosity and terror, she could not
dismiss from her thoughts. So powerfully
had they affected her, that she even could
not resolve to destroy the papers immedi∣ately;
and the more she dwelt on the cir∣cumstance,
the more it inflamed her imagi∣nation.
Urged by the most forcible, and
apparently the most necessary, curiosity to
enquire farther, concerning the terrible and
mysterious subject, to which she had seen
an allusion, she began to lament her pro∣mise
<PB N="276" REF="288"/>
to destroy the papers. For a moment,
she even doubted, whether it could justly
be obeyed, in contradiction to such reasons
as there appeared to be for further informa∣tion.
But the delusion was momentary.</P>
<P>"I have given a solemn promise," said
she, "to observe a solemn injunction, and
it is not my business to argue, but to obey.
Let me hasten to remove the temptation,
that would destroy my innocence, and em∣bitter
my life with the consciousness of irre∣mediable
guilt, while I have, strength to, re∣ject
it."</P>
<P>Thus re-animated with a sense of her
duty, she completed the triumph of inte∣grity
over temptation, more forcible than
any she had ever known, and consigned the
papers to the flames. Her eyes watched
them as they slowly consumed, she shud∣dered
at the recollection of the sentence she
had just seen, and at the certainty, that the
only opportunity of explaining it was then
passing away for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="289"/>
It was long after this, that she recollected
the purse; and as she was depositing it, un∣opened,
in a cabinet, perceiving that it con∣tained
something of a size larger than coin,
she examined it. "His hand deposited
them here," said she, as she kissed some
pieces of the coin, and wetted them with
her tears, "his hand—which is now dust!"
At the bottom of the purse was a small
packet, having taken out which, and un∣folded
paper after paper, she found to be an
ivory case, containing, the miniature of a—lady!
She started—"The same," said
she, "my father, wept over!" On exa∣mining
the countenance she could recollect
no person that it resembled. It was of un∣common
beauty, and was characterized by
an expression of sweetness, shaded with, sor∣row,
and tempered by resignation.</P>
<P>St. Aubert had given no directions con∣cerning
this picture, nor had even named
it; she, therefore, thought herself justified
in preserving it. More than once remem∣bering
his manner, when he had spoken of
<PB N="278" REF="290"/>
the Marchioness of Villeroi, she felt inclined
to believe that this was her resemblance;
yet there appeared no reason why he should
have preserved a picture of that lady, or,
having preserved it, why he should lament
over it in a manner so striking and affecting
as she had witnessed on the night preceding
his departure.</P>
<P>Emily still gazed on the countenance,
examining its features, but she knew not
where to detect the charm that captivated
her attention, and inspired sentiments of
such love and pity. Dark brown hair
played carelessly along the open forehead;
the nose was rather inclined to aquiline;
the lips spoke in a smile, but it was a melan∣choly
one; the eyes were blue, and were di∣rected
upwards with an expression of pecu∣liar
meekness, while the soft cloud of the
brow spoke the fine sensibility of the temper.</P>
<P>Emily was roused from the musing mood
into which the picture had thrown her, by
the closing of the garden gate; and, on
turning her eyes to the window, she saw
Valancourt coming towards the chateau.
<PB N="279" REF="291"/>
Her spirits agitated by the subjects that
had lately occupied her mind, she felt un∣prepared
to see him, and remained a few
moments in the chamber to recover her∣self.</P>
<P>When she met him in the parlour, she was
struck with the change that appeared in his
air and countenance since they had parted
in Rousillon, which twilight and the distress
she suffered on the preceding evening had
prevented her from observing. But de∣jection
and languor disappeared, for a mo∣ment,
in the smile that now enlightened his
countenance, on perceiving her. "You
see," said he, "I have availed myself of the
permission with which you honoured me—of
bidding <HI>you</HI> farewell, whom I had
the happiness of meeting only yesterday."</P>
<P>Emily smiled faintly, and, anxious to say
something, asked if he had been long in Gas∣cony.
"A few days only," replied Valan∣court,
while a blush passed over his cheek
"I engaged in a long ramble after I
had the misfortune of parting with the
<PB N="280" REF="292"/>
friends who had made my wanderings
among the Pyrenees so delightful."</P>
<P>A tear came to Emily's eye, as Valan∣court
said this, which he observed; and,
anxious to draw off her attention from the
remembrance that had occasioned it, as
well as shocked at his own thoughtlessness,
he began to speak on other subjects; ex∣pressing
his admiration of the chateau, and
its prospects. Emily, who felt somewhat
embarrassed how to support a conversation,
was glad of such an opportunity to conti∣nue
it on indifferent topics. They walked
down to the terrace, where Valancourt was
charmed with the river scenery, and the
views over the opposite shores of Guienne.</P>
<P>As he leaned on the wall of the terrace,
watching the rapid current of the Garonne,
"I was a few weeks ago," said he, "at the
source of this noble river; I had not then
the happiness of knowing you, or I should
have regretted your absence—it was a scene
so exactly suited to your taste. It rises in a
part of the Pyrenées, still wilder and more
<PB N="281" REF="293"/>
sublime I think, than any we passed in the
way to Rousillon." He then described its
fall among thé precipices of the mountains,
where its waters, augmented by the streams
that descend from the snowy summits
around, rush into the Vallée d'Aran, be∣tween
whose romantic heights it foams
along, pursuing its way to the north west
till it emerges upon the plains of Langue∣doc.
Then, washing the walls of Tholouse,
and turning again to the north west, it as∣sumes
a milder character, as it fertilizes the
pastures of Gascony and Guienne, in its pro∣gress
to the Bay of Biscay.</P>
<P>Emily and Valancourt talked of the scenes
they had passed among the Pyrenean Alps;
as he spoke of which there was often a tremu∣lous
tenderness in his voice, and sometimes
he expatiated on them with all the fire of
genius, sometimes would appear scarcely
conscious of the topic, though he continued
to speak. This subject recalled forcibly to
Emily the idea of her father, whose image
appeared in every landscape which Valan∣court
<PB N="282" REF="294"/>
particularized, whose remarks dwelt
upon her memory, and whose enthusiasm
still glowed in her heart. Her silence, at
length, reminded Valancourt how nearly
his conversation approached to the occasion
of her grief, and he changed the subject,
though for one scarcely less affecting to
Emily. When he admired the grandeur of
the plane-tree, that spread its wide branches
over the terrace, and under whose shade they
now sat, she remembered how often she had
sat thus with St. Aubert, and heard him ex∣press
the same admiration.</P>
<P>"This was a favourite tree with my dear
father," said she; "he used to love to sit
under its foliage with his family about him,
in the fine evenings of summer."</P>
<P>Valancourt understood her feelings, and
was silent; had she raised her eyes from the
ground she would have seen tears in his.
He rose, and leaned on the wall of the ter∣race,
from which, in a few moments, he re∣turned
to his seat, then rose again, and ap∣peared
to be greatly agitated; while Emily
<PB N="283" REF="295"/>
found her spirits so much depressed, that seve∣ral
of her attempts to renew the conversation
were ineffectual. Valancourt again sat down,
but was still silent, and trembled. At length
he said, with a hesitating voice, "This lovely
scene!—I am going to leave—to leave you—perhaps
for ever! These moments may never
return; I cannot resolve to neglect, though
I scarcely dare to avail myself of them. Let
me, however, without offending the delicacy
of your sorrow, venture to declare the admi∣ration
I must always feel of your goodness,—O!
that at some future period I might be
permitted to call it love!"</P>
<P>Emily's emotion would not suffer her to
reply; and Valancourt, who now ventured
to look up, observing her countenance
change, expected to see her faint, and made
an involuntary effort to support her, which
recalled Emily to a sense of her situation,
and to an exertion of her spirits. Valan∣court
did not appear to notice her indispo∣sition,
but, when he spoke again, his voice
told the tenderest love. "I will not pre∣sume,"
<PB N="284" REF="296"/>
he added, "to intrude this subject
longer upon your attention at this time, but I
may, perhaps, be permitted to mention, that
these parting moments would lose much of
their bitterness if I might be allowed to hope
the declaration I have made would not ex∣clude
me from your presence in future."</P>
<P>Emily made another effort to overcome
the confusion of her thoughts, and to speak.
She feared to trust the preference her heart
acknowledged towards Valancourt, and to
give him any encouragement for hope, on
so short an acquaintance. For though in
this narrow period she had observed much
that was admirable in his taste and disposi∣tion,
and though these observations had been
sanctioned by the opinion of her father, they
were not sufficient testimonies of his general
worth to determine her upon a subject so in∣finitely
important to her future happiness
as that, which now solicited her attention.
Yet, though the thought of dismissing Va∣lancourt
was so very painful to her, that
she could scarcely endure to pause upon it,
<PB N="285" REF="297"/>
the consiousness of this made her fear the
partiality of her judgment, and hesitate still
more to encourage that suit, for which her
own heart too tenderly pleaded. The fa∣mily
of Valancourt, if not his circumstances,
had been known to her father, and known to
be unexceptionable. Of his circumstances,
Valancourt himself hinted as far as de∣licacy
would permit, when he said he had at
present little else to offer but an heart, that
adored her. He had solicited only for a
distant hope, and she could not resolve to
forbid, though she scarcely dared to permit
it; at length, she acquired courage to say,
that she must think herself honoured by the
good opinion of any person, whom her father
had esteemed.</P>
<P>"And was I, then, thought worthy of
his esteem?" said Valancourt, in a voice
trembling with anxiety; then checking him∣self,
he added, "But pardon the question; I
scarcely know what I say. If I might dare to
hope, that you think me not unworthy such
honour, and might be permitted sometimes
<PB N="286" REF="298"/>
to enquire after your health, I should now
leave you with comparative tranquillity."</P>
<P>Emily, after a moment's silence, said, "I
will be ingenuous with you, for I know you
will understand, and allow for my situation;
you will consider it as a proof of my—my
esteem that I am so. Though I live here
in what was my father's house, I live here
alone. I have, alas! no longer a parent—a
parent, whose presence might sanction
your visits. It is unnecessary for me to
point out the impropriety of my receiving
them."</P>
<P>"Nor will I affect to be insensible of
this," replied Valancourt, adding mourn∣fully—"but
what is to console me for my
candour? I distress you, and would now
leave the subject, if I might carry with me
a hope of being some time permitted to re∣new
it, of being allowed to make myself
known to your family."</P>
<P>Emily was again confused, and again he∣sitated
what to reply; she felt most acutely
the difficulty—the forlornness of her situa∣tion,
<PB N="287" REF="299"/>
which did not allow her a single rela∣tive,
or friend, to whom me could turn for
even a look, that might support and guide
her in the present embarrassing circum∣stances.
Madame Cheron, who was her only
relative, and ought to have been this friend,
was either occupied by her / own amusements,
or so resentful of the reluctance her niece
had shewn to quit La Vallée, that she seemed
totally to have abandoned her.</P>
<P>"Ah! I see," said Valancourt, after a
long pause, during which Emily had begun,
and left unfinished two three sentences, "I
see that I have nothing to hope; my fears
were too just, you think me unworthy of
your esteem. That fatal journey! which I
considered as the happiest period of my life—those
delightful days were to embitter all
my future ones. How often I have looked
back to them with hope and fear—yet never
till this moment could I prevail with myself
to regret their enchanting influence."</P>
<P>His voice faltered, and he abruptly quit∣ted
his seat and walked on the terrace.
<PB N="288" REF="300"/>
There was an expression of despair on his
countenance, that affected Emily. The
pleadings of her heart overcame, in some
degree, her extreme timidity, and, when he
resumed his seat, she said, in an accent that
betrayed her tenderness, "You do both
yourself and me injustice when you say I
think you unworthy of my esteem; I will
acknowledge that you have long possessed
it, and—and—"</P>
<P>Valancourt waited impatiently for the
conclusion of the sentence, but the words
died on her lips. Her eyes, however, re∣flected
all the emotions of her heart. Va∣lancourt
passed, in an instant, from the im∣patience
of despair, to that of joy and tender∣ness.
"O Emily!" he exclaimed, "my own
Emily—teach me to sustain this moment!
Let me seal it as the most sacred of my life!"</P>
<P>He pressed her hand to his lips, it was
cold and trembling; and, raising his eyes,
he saw the paleness of her countenance.
Tears came to her relief, and Valancourt
watched in anxious silence over her. In a
<PB N="289" REF="301"/>
few moments, she recovered herself, and
smiling faintly through her tears, said,
"Can you excuse this weakness? My spi∣rits
have not yet, I believe, recovered from
the shock they lately received."</P>
<P>"I cannot excuse myself," said Valan∣court,
"but I will forbear to renew the
subject;, which may have contributed to agi∣tate
them, now that I can leave you, with
the sweet certainty of possessing your es∣teem.</P>
<P>Then, forgetting his resolution, he again
spoke of himself. "You know not," said
he, "the many anxious hours I have passed
near you lately, when you believed me, if
indeed you honoured me with a thought, far
away. I have wandered, near the chateau, in
the still hours of the night, when no eye could
observe me. It was delightful to know I was
so near you, and there was something particu∣larly
soothing in the thought, that I watched
round your habitation, while you slept.
These grounds are not entirely new to me.
Once I ventured within the sence, and spent
<PB N="290" REF="302"/>
one of the happiest, and yet most melancholy
hours of my life in walking under what I be∣lieved
to be your window."</P>
<P>Emily enquired how, long Valancourt had
been in the neighbourhood. "Several days,"
he replied. "It was my design to avail
myself of the permission M. St. Aubert had
given me. I scarcely know how to account
for it; but, though I anxiously wished to do
this, my resolution always failed, when the
moment approached, and I constantly de∣ferred
my visit. I lodged in a village at
some distance, and wandered with my dogs,
among the scenes of this charming country,
wishing continually to meet you, yet not
daring to visit you."</P>
<P>Having thus continued to converse, with∣out
perceiving the flight of time, Valan∣court,
at length, seemed to recollect himself.
"I must go," said he mournsully, "but it
is with the hope of seeing you again, of being
permitted to pay my respects to your family,
let me hear this hope confirmed by your
voice." "My family will be happy to see
<PB N="291" REF="303"/>
any friend of my dear father," said Emily.
Valancourt kissed her hand, and still lin∣gered,
unable to depart, while Emily sat
silently with her eyes bent on the ground;
and Valancourt, as he gazed on her, consi∣dered
that it would soon be impossible for
him to recall, even to his memory, the exact
resemblance of the beautiful countenance he
then beheld; at this moment an hasty foot∣step
approached from behind the plane-tree,
and, turning her eyes, Emily saw Madame
Cheron. She felt a blush steal upon her
cheek, and her frame trembled with the
emotion of her mind; but she instantly rose
to meet her visitor. "So niece," said Ma∣dame
Cheron, casting a look of surprise and
enquiry on Valancourt, "so niece, how do
you do? But I need not ask, your looks tell
me you have already recovered your loss."</P>
<P>"My looks do me injustice then, Ma∣dam,
my loss I know can never be reco∣vered."</P>
<P>"Well!—I will not argue with
you; I see you have exactly your father's
<PB N="292" REF="304"/>
disposition; and let me tell you it would
have been much happier for him, poor
man! if it had been a different one."</P>
<P>A look of dignified displeasure, with
which Emily regarded Madame Cheron,
while she spoke, would have touched almost
any other heart: she made no other reply, but
introduced Valancourt, who could scarcely
stifle the resentment he selt, and whose bow
Madame Cheron returned with a slight
curtesy, and a look of supercilious exami∣nation.
After a few moments he took leave
of Emily, in a manner, that hastily expressed
his pain both at his own departure, and at
leaving her to the society of Madame Che∣ron.</P>
<P>"Who is that young man?" said her
aunt, in an accent, which equally implied
inquisitiveness and censure. "Some idle
admirer of yours I suppose; but I believed
niece you had a greater sense of propriety,
than to have received the visits of any young
man in your present unfriended situation.
Let me tell you the world will observe those
<PB N="293" REF="305"/>
things, and it will talk, aye and very freely
too."</P>
<P>Emily, extremely shocked at this coarse
speech, attempted to interrupt it; but Ma∣dame
Cheron would proceed, with all the
self-importance of a person, to whom power
is new.</P>
<P>"It is very necessary you should be under
the eye of some person more able to guide
you than yourself. I, indeed, have not much
leisure for such a task; however, since your
poor father made it his last request, that I
should overlook your conduct—I must even
take you "under my care. But this let me
tell you niece, that, unless you will deter∣mine
to be very conformable to my direc∣tion,
I shall not trouble myself longer about
you."</P>
<P>Emily made no attempt to interrupt Ma∣dame
Cheron a second time, grief and the
pride of conscious innocence kept her silent,
till her aunt said, "I am now come to
take you with me to Thoulouse; I am sorry
to find, that your poor father died, after all,
<PB N="294" REF="306"/>
in such indifferent circumstances; however,
I shall take you home with me. Ah! poor
man, he was always more generous than pro∣vident,
or he would not have left his daugh∣ter
dependent on his relations."</P>
<P>"Nor has he done so, I hope, madam,"
said Emily calmly, "nor did his pecuniary
misfortunes arise from that noble generosity,
which always distinguished him. The affairs
of M. de Motteville may, I trust, yet
be settled without deeply injuring his credi∣tors,
and in the mean time I should be very
happy to remain at La Vallée."</P>
<P>"No doubt you would," replied Ma∣dame
Cheron, with a smile of irony, "and
I shall no doubt consent to this, since I see
how necessary tranquillity and retirement
are to restore your spirits. I did not think
you capable of so much duplicity, niece;
when you pleaded this excuse for re∣maining
here, I foolishly believed it to be
a just one, nor expected to have found with
you so agreeable a companion as this M.
La Val—, I forget his name."</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="307"/>
Emily could no longer endure these cruel
indignities. "It was a just one, madam,"
said she; "and now, indeed, I feel more than
ever the value of the retirement I then so∣licited;
and, if the purport of your visit is
only to add insult to the sorrows of your
brother's child, she could well have spared
it."</P>
<P>"I see that I have undertaken a very
troublesome task," said Madame Cheron,
colouring highly. "I am sure, madam,"
said Emily mildly, and endeavouring to re∣strain
her tears, "I am sure my father did
not mean it should be such. I have the
happiness to reflect, that my conduct under
his eye was such as he often delighted to ap∣prove.
It would be very painful to me to
disobey the sister of such a parent, and, if
you believe the task will really be so trouble∣some,
I must lament, that it is yours."</P>
<P>"Well! niece, fine speaking signifies little.
I am willing, in consideration of my poor
brother, to overlook the impropriety of your
<PB N="296" REF="308"/>
late conduct, and to try what your future
will be."</P>
<P>Emily interrupted her, to beg she would
explain what was the impropriety she al∣luded
to.</P>
<P>"What impropriety! why that of re∣ceiving
the visits of a lover unknown to
your family," replied Madame Cheron, not
considering the impropriety of which she
had herself been guilty, in exposing her niece
to the possibility of conduct so erroneous.</P>
<P>A faint blush passed over Emily's counte∣nance;
pride and anxiety struggled in her
breast; and, till she recollected, that appear∣ances
did, in some degree, justify her aunt's
suspicions, she could not resolve to humble
herself so far as to enter into the defence
of a conduct, which had been so innocent
and undesigning on her part. She men∣tioned
the manner of Valancourt's introduc∣tion
to her father; the circumstance of his
receiving the pistol-shot, and of their after∣wards
travelling together; with the acci∣dental
way, in which she had met him, on
<PB N="297" REF="309"/>
the preceding evening. She owned he had
declared a partiality for her, and that he
had asked permission to address her family.</P>
<P>"And who is this young adventurer,
pray?" said Madame Cheron, "and what
are his pretensions?" "These he must
himself explain, madam," replied Emily.
"Of his family my father was not igno∣rant,
and I believe it is unexceptionable."
She then proceeded to mention what she
knew concerning it.</P>
<P>"O, then, this it seems is a younger bro∣ther,"
exclaimed her aunt, "and of course
a beggar. A very sine tale indeed! And
so my brother took a fancy to this young
man after only a few days acquaintance!—but
that was so like him! In his youth
he was always taking these likes and dis∣likes,
when no other person saw any reason
for them at all; nay, indeed, I have often
thought the people he disapproved were
much more agreeable than those he ad∣mired;—but
there is no accounting for
tastes. He was always so much influenced
<PB N="298" REF="310"/>
by people's countenances; now I, for my
part, have no notion of this, it is all ridicu∣lous
enthusiasm. What has a man's face to
do with his character? Can a man of good
character help having a disagreeable face?"—which
last sentence Madame Cheron de∣livered
with the decisive air of a person who
congratulates herself on having made a
grand discovery, and believes the question
to be unanswerably settled.</P>
<P>Emily, desirous of concluding the con∣versation,
enquired if her aunt would accept
some resreshment, and Madame Cheron ac∣companied
her to the chateau, but without
desisting from a topic, which she discussed
with so much complacency to" herself, and
severity to her niece.</P>
<P>"I am sorry to perceive, niece," said she,
in allusion to somewhat that Emily had said,
concerning physiognomy, "that you have
a great many of your father's prejudices,
and among them are those sudden predilec∣tions
for people from their looks. I can
perceive, that you imagine yourself to be
<PB N="299" REF="311"/>
violently in love with this young adventurer,
after an acquaintance of only a few days.
There was something, too, so charmingly
romantic in the manner of your meeting!"</P>
<P>Emily checked the tears, that trembled in
her eyes, while she said, "When my con∣duct
mall deserve this severity, madam, you
will do well to exercise it; till then justice,
if not tenderness, should surely restrain it. I
have never willingly offended you; now I
have loft my parents, you are the only person
to whom I can look, for kindness. Let me
not lament more than ever the loss of such
parents." The last words were almost stifled
by her emotions, and she burst into tears.
Remembering the delicacy and the tender∣ness
of St. Aubert, the happy, happy days
she had passed in these scenes, and contrast∣ing
them with the coarse and unfeeling be∣haviour
of Madame Cheron, and with the
future hours of mortification she must sub∣mit
to in her presence—a degree of grief
seized her, that almost reached despair. Ma∣dame
Cheron, more offended by the reproof,
<PB N="300" REF="312"/>
which Emily's words conveyed, than touch∣ed
by the sorrow they expressed, said nothing,
that might soften her grief; but, notwith∣standing
an apparent reluctance to receive
her niece, she desired her company. The
love of sway was her ruling passion, and she
knew it would be highly gratified by taking
into her house a young orphan, who had no
appeal from her decisions, and on whom she
could exercise without controul the caprici∣ous
humour of the moment.</P>
<P>On entering the chateau, Madame Cheron
expressed a desire, that she would put up
what she thought necessary to take to Tho∣louse,
as she meant to set off immediately.
Emily now tried to persuade her to defer
the journey, at least, till the next day, and,
at length, with much difficulty, prevailed.</P>
<P>The day passed in the exercise of petty
tyranny on the part of Madame Cheron,
and in mournful regret and melancholy an∣ticipation
on that of Emily, who, when
her aunt retired to her apartment for the
night, went, to take leave of every other
<PB N="301" REF="313"/>
room in this her dear native home, which
she was now quitting for she knew not how
long, and for a world, to which she was
wholly a stranger. She could not conquer
a presentiment, which frequently occurred
to her, this night—that she should never
more return to La Vallée. Having passed
a considerable time in what had been her fa∣ther's
study, having selected some of his fa∣vourite
authors, to put up with her clothes,
and shed many tears, as she wiped the dust
from their covers, she seated herself in his
chair before the reading desk, and sat lost
in melancholy reflection, till Theresa opened
the door to examine, as was her custom be∣fore
she went to bed, if all was safe. She
started, on observing her young lady, who
bade her come in, and then gave her some
directions for keeping the chateau in readi∣ness
for her reception at all times.</P>
<P>"Alas-a day! that you should leave it!"
said Theresa, "I think you would be hap∣pier
here than where you are going, if one
may judge." Emily made no reply to this
<PB N="302" REF="314"/>
remark; he sorrow Theresa proceeded to
express at her departure assected her, but
she sound some comfort in the simple affect∣tion
of this poor old servant, to whom she
gave such directions as might best conduce
to her comfort, during her own absence.</P>
<P>Having dismissed Theresa to bed, Emily
wandered through every lonely apartment of
the chateau, lingering long in what had been
her father's bed-room, indulging melan∣choly,
yet not unpleasing, emotions, and,
having often returned, within the door to
take another look at it, she withdrew to her
own chamber. From her window she gazed
upon the garden below, shewn faintly by the
moon, rising over the tops of the palm-trees,
and, at length, the calm, beauty, of the night
increased a desire of indulging the mournful
sweetness of bidding farewel to the beloved
shades of her childhood, till she was tempted
to descend. Throwing over her the light
veil, in which she usually walked, she silently
passed into the garden, and, hastening to∣wards
the distant groves, was glad to breathe
<PB N="303" REF="315"/>
once more the air of liberty, and to sigh un∣observed.
The deep repose of the scene,
the rich scents, that floated on the breeze,
the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the
clear blue arch, soothed and gradually ele∣vated
her mind to that sublime compla∣cency,
which renders the vexations of this
world so insignificant and mean in our eyes,
that we wonder they have had power for a
moment to disturb us. Emily forgot Ma∣dame
Cheron and all the circumstances of
her conduct, while her thoughts ascended
to the contemplation, of those unnumbered
worlds, that lie scattered in the depths of
aether, thausands of them hid from human
eyes, and almost beyond the slight of human
fancy. As her imagination soared through
the regions of space, and aspired to that
Great First Cause, which pervades and go∣verns
all being, the idea of her father scarcely
ever lest her; but it was a pleasing idea,
since she resigned him to God in the full
confidence of a pure and holy faith. She
pursued her way through the groves to the
<PB N="304" REF="316"/>
terrace, often pausing as memory awakened
the pang of affection, and as reason antici∣pated
the exile, into which she was going.</P>
<P>And now the moon was high over the
woods, touching their summits with yellow
light, and darting between the foliage long
level beams; while on the rapid Garonne
below the trembling radiance was faintly
obscured by the lightest vapour. Emily
long watched the playing lustre, listened to
the soothing murmur of the current, and
the yet lighter sounds of the air, as it stirred,
at intervals, the lofty palm-trees. "How
delightful is the sweet breath of these
groves," said she. "This lovely scene!—how
often shall I remember and regret it,
when I am far away. Alas! What events
may occur before I see it again! O, peace∣ful,
happy shades!—scenes of my infant
delights, of parental tenderness now lost for
ever!—why must I leave ye!—In your re∣treats
I should still sind safety and repose.
Sweet hours of my childhood—I am now
to leave even your last memorials! No ob∣jects,
<PB N="305" REF="317"/>
that would revive your impressions,
will remain for me!"</P>
<P>Then drying her tears and looking up,
her thoughts rose again to the sublime sub∣ject
she had contemplated, the same divine
complacency stole over her heart, and, hush∣ing
its throbs, inspired hope and confidence
and resignation to the will of the Deity,
whose works filled her mind with adora∣tion.</P>
<P>Emily gazed long on the plane-tree, and
then seated herself, for the last time, on the
bench under its shade, where she had so
often sat with her parents, and where, only
a few hours before, she had conversed with
Valancourt, at the remembrance of whom,
thus revived, a mingled sensation of esteem,
tenderness and anxiety rose in her breast.
With this remembrance occurred a recol∣lection
of his late confession—that he had
often wandered near her habitation in the
night, having even passed the boundary of
the garden, and it immediately occurred to
her, that he might be at this moment in the
<PB N="306" REF="318"/>
grounds. The fear of meeting him, parti∣cularly
after the declaration he had made,
and of incurring a censure, which her aunt
might so reasonably bestow, if it was known,
that she was met by her lover, at this hour,
made her instantly leave her beloved plane∣tree,
and walk towards the chateau. She
cast an anxious eye around, and often stop∣ped
for a moment to examine the shadowy
scene before she ventured to proceed, but
she passed on without perceiving any per∣son,
till, having reached a clump of almond
trees, not far from the house, she rested
to take a retrospect of the garden, and to∣sigh
forth another adieu: As her eyes wan∣dered
over the landscape she thought she
perceived a person emerge from the groves,
and pass slowly along a moon-light alley
that led between them, but the distance,
and the imperfect light would not suffer her
to judge with any degree of certainty whe∣ther
this was fancy or reality. She con∣tinued
to gaze for some time on the spot,
till an the dead stillness of the air she heard
<PB N="307" REF="319"/>
a sudden sound, and in the next instant
fancied she distinguished footsteps near her.
Wasting not another moment in conjecture,
she hurried to the chateau, and, having
reached it, retired to her chamber, where, as
she closed her window she looked upon the
garden, and then again thought she distin∣guished
a figure, gliding between the almond
trees she had just left. She immediately
withdrew from the casement, and, though
much agitated, sought in sleep the refresh∣ment
of a short oblivion.</P>

<BIBL>THE MINSTREL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT an early hour, the carriage, which
was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to
Tholouse, appeared at the door of the cha∣teau,
and Madame was already in the break∣fast-room,
when her niece entered it. The
repast was silent and melancholy on the
part of Emily; and Madame Cheron,
whose vanity was piqued on observing her
dejection, reproved her in a manner that
did not contribute to remove it. It was
with much reluctance, that Emily's request
to take with her the dog, which had been a
<PB N="309" REF="321"/>
favourite of her father, was granted. Her
aunt, impatient to be gone, ordered the car∣riage
to draw up; and, while she passed to
the hall door, Emily gave another look
into the library, and another farewell glance
over the garden, and then followed. Old
Theresa stood at the door to take leave of
her young lady. "God for ever keep you,
ma'amselle!" said she, while Emily gave
her hand in silence, and could answer only
with a pressure of her hand, and a forced
smile.</P>
<P>At the gate, which led out of the grounds,
several of her father's pensioners were as∣sembled
to bid her farewell, to whom she
would have spoken, if her aunt would have
suffered the driver to stop; and, having
distributed to them almost all the money she
had about her, she sunk back in the car∣riage,
yielding to the melancholy of her
heart. Soon after, she caught, between
the steep-banks of the road, another view
of the chateau, peeping from among the
high trees, and surrounded by green slopes
<PB N="310" REF="322"/>
and tufted groves, the Garonne winding its
way beneath their shades, sometimes lost
among the vineyards, and then rising in
greater majesty in the distant pastures. The
towering precipices of the Pyrenées, that rose
to the south, gave Emily a thousand interest∣ing
recollections of her late journey; and
these objects of her former enthusiastic admi∣ration,
now excited only sorrow and regret.
Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely
scenery, till the banks again closed upon
them, her mind became too much occupied
by mournful reflections, to permit her to at∣tend
to the conversation, which Madame
Cheron had begun on some trivial topic,
so that they soon travelled in profound si∣lence.</P>
<P>Valancourt, mean while, was returned to
Estuviere, his heart occupied with the image
of Emily; sometimes indulging in reveries
of future happiness, but more frequently
shrinking with dread of the opposition he
might encounter from her family. He was
the younger son of an ancient family of
<PB N="311" REF="323"/>
Gascony; and, having lost his parents at an
early period of his life, the care of his edu∣cation
and of his small portion had devolved,
to his brother, the Count de Duvarney, his
senior by nearly twenty years. Valancourt
had been educated in all the accomplish∣ments
of his age, and had an ardour of spi∣rit,
and a certain grandeur of mind, that
gave him particular excellence in the exer∣cises
then thought heroic. His little for∣tune
had been diminished by the necessary
expences of his education; but M. La Va∣lancourt,
the elder, seemed to think, that
his genius and accomplishments would am∣ply
supply the deficiency of his inheritance.
They offered flattering hopes of promotion
in the military profession, in those times al∣most
the only one in which a gentleman
could engage without incurring a stain on
his name; and La Valancourt was of course
enrolled in the army. The general genius
of his mind was but little understood by
his brother. That ardour for whatever is
great and good in the moral world, as well as
<PB N="312" REF="324"/>
in the natural one, displayed itself in his
infant years; and the strong indignation,
which he felt and expressed at a criminal,
or a mean action, sometimes drew upon him
the displeasure of his tutor; who reprobated
it under the general term of violence of
temper; and who, when haranguing on the
virtues of mildness and moderation, seemed
to forget the gentleness and compassion,
which always appeared in his pupil towards
objects of misfortune.</P>
<P>He had now obtained leave of absence
from his regiment when he made the excur∣sion
into the Pyrenées, which was the means
of introducing him to St. Aubert; and, as
this permission was nearly expired, he was
the more anxious to declare himself to
Emily's family, from whom he reasonably
apprehended opposition, since his fortune,
though, with a moderate addition from hers,
it would be sufficient to support them,
would not satisfy the views, either of vanity,
or ambition. Valancourt was not without
the latter, but he saw golden visions of pro∣motion
<PB N="313" REF="325"/>
in the army; and believed, that with
Emily he could, in the mean time, be de∣lighted
to live within the limits of his hum∣ble
income. His thoughts were now oc∣cupied
in considering the means of making
himself known to her family, to whom,
however, he had yet no address, for he was
entirely ignorant of Emily's precipitate de∣parture
from La Vallée, of whom he hoped
to obtain it.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the travelers pursued their
journey; Emily making frequent efforts to
appear chearful, and too often relapsing
into silence and dejection. Madame Che∣ron,
attributing her melancholy solely to the
circumstance of her being removed to a
distance from her lover, and believing, that
the sorrow, which her niece still expressed
for the loss of St. Aubert, proceeded partly
from an affectation of sensibility, endea∣voured
to make it appear ridiculous to her,
that such deep regret mould continue to be
felt so long after the period usually allowed
for grief.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="326"/>
At length, these unpleasant lectures were
interrupted by the arrival of the travellers
at Tholouse; and Emily, who had not
been there for many years, and had only a,
very faint recollection of it, was surprised
at the ostentatious style exhibited in her
aunt's house and furniture; the more so,
perhaps, because it was so totally different
from the modest elegance, to which she had
been accustomed. She followed Madame
Cheron through a large hall, where several
servants in rich liveries appeared, to a kind
of saloon, fitted up with more shew than
taste; and her aunt, complaining of fa∣tigue,
ordered supper immediately. "I
am glad to find myself in my own house
again," said she, throwing herself on a large
settee, "and to have my own people about
me. I detest travelling; though, indeed, I
ought to like it, for what I see abroad al∣ways
makes me delighted to return to my
own chateau. What makes you so silent,
child?—What is it that difturbs you now?"</P>
<P>Emily suppressed a starting tear, and
<PB N="315" REF="327"/>
tried to smile away the expression of an op∣pressed
heart; she was thinking of <HI>her</HI>
home, and felt too sensibly the arrogance
and ostentatious vanity of Madame Che∣ron's
conversation. "Can this be my fa∣ther's
sister!" said she to herself; and then
the conviction that she was so, warming her
heart with something like kindness towards
her, she felt anxious to soften the harsh im∣pression
her mind had received of her aunt's
character, and to shew a willingness to
oblige her. The effort did not entirely
fail; she listened with apparent chearfulness,
while Madame Cheron expatiated on the
splendour of her house, told of the nume∣rous
parties she entertained, and what she
should expect of Emily, whose diffidence as∣sumed
the air of a reserve, which her aunt, be∣lieving
it to be that of pride and ignorance
united, now took occasion to reprehend.
She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind,
that fears to trust its own powers; which,
possessing a nice judgment, and inclining to
believe, that every other person perceives
<PB N="316" REF="328"/>
still more critically, fears to commit itself to
censure, and seeks shelter in the obscurity
of silence. Emily had frequently blushed
at the fearless manners, which she had seen
admired, and the brilliant nothings, which
she had heard applauded; yet this applause,
so far from encouraging her to imitate the
conduct that had won it, rather made her
shrink into the reserve, that would protect
her from such absurdity.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron looked on her niece's
diffidence with a feeling very near to con∣tempt,
and endeavoured to overcome it by
reproof, rather than to encourage it by gen∣tleness.</P>
<P>The entrance of supper somewhat inter∣rupted
the complacent discourse of Ma∣dame
Cheron and the painful considerations,
which it had forced upon Emily. When
the repast, which was rendered ostentatious
by the attendance of a great number of ser∣vants,
and by a profusion of plate, was over,
Madame Cheron retired to her chamber,
and a female servant came to shew Emily
<PB N="317" REF="329"/>
to hers. Having passed up a large stair
case, and through several galleries, they
came to a flight of back stairs, which led
into a short passage in a remote part of the
chateau, and there the servant opened the
door of a small chamber, which she said
was Ma'amselle Emily's, who, once more
alone, indulged the tears she had long
tried to restrain.</P>
<P>Those, who know, from experience, how
much the heart becomes attached even to
inanimate objects, to which it has been
long accustomed, how unwillingly it re∣signs
them; how with the sensations of an
old friend it meets them, after temporary
absence, will understand the forlornness of
Emily's feelings, of Emily shut out from
the only home she had known from her in∣fancy,
and thrown upon a scene, and among
persons, disagreeable for more qualities
than their novelty. Her father's favourite
dog, now in the chamber, thus seemed to
acquire the character and importance of a
friend; and, as the animal fawned over her
<PB N="318" REF="330"/>
when she wept, and licked her hands,
"Ah, poor Manchon!" said she, "I have
nobody now to love me—but you!" and
she wept the more. After some time, her
thoughts returning to her father's injunc∣tions,
she remembered how often he had
blamed her for indulging useless sorrow;
how often he had pointed out to her the ne∣cessity
of fortitude and patience, assuring
her, that the faculties of the mind strengthen
by exertion, till they finally unnerve afflic∣tion,
and triumph over it. These recollec∣tions
dried her tears, gradually soothed her
spirits, and inspired her with the sweet emu∣lation
of practising precepts, which her fa∣ther
had so frequently inculcated.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MADAME Cheron's house stood at a
little distance from the city of Tholouse,
and was surrounded by extensive gardens,
in which Emily, who had arisen early,
amused herself with wandering before
breakfast, From a terrace, that extended
along the highest part of them, was a wide
view over Languedoc. On the distaht ho∣rizon
to the south, she discovered the wild
summits of the Pyrenées, and her fancy im∣mediately
painted the green pastures of
Gascony at their feet. Her heart pointed
to her peaceful home—to the neighbour∣hood
where Valancourt was—where St.
<PB N="320" REF="332"/>
Aubert had been; and her imagination,
piercing the veil of distance, brought that
home to her eyes in all its interesting and
romantic beauty. She experienced an in∣expressible
pleasure in believing, that she
beheld the country around it, though no
feature could be distinguished, except the
retiring chain of the Pyrenées; and, inat∣tentive
to the scene immediately before
her, and to the flight of time, she continued
to lean on the window of a pavilion, that
terminated the terrace, with her eyes fixed
on Gascony, and her mind occupied with
the interesting ideas which the view of it
awakened, till a servant came to tell her
breakfast was ready. Her thoughts thus
recalled to the surrounding objects, the
straight walks, square parterres, and artifi∣cial
fountains of the garden, could not fail,
as she passed through it, to appear the
worse, opposed to the negligent graces, and
natural beauties of the grounds at La Val∣lée,
upon which her recollection had been
so intensely employed.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="333"/>
"Whither have you been rambling so
early?" said Madame Cheron, as her niece
entered the breakfast-room. "I don't ap∣prove
of these solitary walks," and Emily
was surprised, when, having informed her
aunt, that she had been no further than the
gardens, she understood these to be included
in the reproof. "I desire you will not
walk there again at so early an hour unat∣tended,"
said Madame Cheron; "my gar∣dens
are very extensive; and a young wo∣man,
who can make assignations by moon∣light,
at La Vallée, is not to be trusted to
her own inclinations elsewhere."</P>
<P>Emily, extremely surprised and shocked,
had scarcely power to beg an explanation of
these words, and, when she did, her aunt
absolutely refused to give it, though, by her
severe looks, and half sentences, she ap∣peared
anxious to impress Emily with a be∣lief,
that she was well informed of some de∣grading
circumstances of her conduct. Con∣scious
innocence could not prevent a blush
from stealing over Emily's cheek; she trem∣bled,
<PB N="322" REF="334"/>
and looked confusedly under the bold
eye of Madame Cheron, who blushed also;
but hers was the blush of triumph, such as
sometimes stains the countenance of a per∣son,
congratulating himself on the penetra∣tion
which had taught him to suspect ano∣ther,
and who loses both pity for the sup∣posed
criminal, and indignation of his guilt,
in the gratification of his own vanity.</P>
<P>Emily, not doubting that her aunt's mis∣take
arose from the having observed her
ramble in the garden on the night preced∣ing
her departure from La Vallée, now
mentioned the motive of it, at which Ma∣dame
Cheron smiled contemptuously, re∣fusing
either to accept this explanation, or
to give her reasons for refusing it; and,
soon after, she concluded the subject by say∣ing,
"I never trust people's assertions, I
always judge of them by their actions; but
I am willing to try what will be your beha∣viour
in future."</P>
<P>Emily, less surprised by her aunt's mo∣deration
and mysterious silence, than by the
<PB N="323" REF="335"/>
accusation she had received, deeply consi∣dered
the latter, and scarcely doubted, that
it was Valancourt whom she had seen at
night in the gardens of La Vallée, and that
he had been observed there by Madame
Cheron; who now passing from one painful
topic only to revive another almost equally
so, spoke of the situation of her niece's pro∣perty,
in the hands of M. Motteville. While
she thus talked with oftentatious pity of
Emily's misfortunes, she failed not to incul∣cate
the duties of humility and gratitude, or
to render Emily fully sensible of every cruel
mortification, who soon perceived, that she
was to be considered as a dependent, not
only by her aunt, but by her aunt's servants.</P>
<P>She was now informed, that a large party
were expected to dinner, on which account
Madame Cheron repeated the lesson of the
preceding night, concerning her conduct in
company, and Emily wished, that she might
have courage enough to practise it. Her
aunt then proceeded to examine the simpli∣city
of her dress, adding, that she expected
<PB N="324" REF="336"/>
to see her attired with gaiety and taste;
after which me condescended to shew Emily
the splendour of her chateau, and to point
out the particular beauty, or elegance,
which she thought distinguished each of her
numerous suites of apartments. She then
withdrew to her toilet, the throne of her
homage, and Emily to her chamber, to un∣pack
her books, and to try to charm her
mind by reading, till the hour of dressing.</P>
<P>When the company arrived, Emily en∣tered
the saloon with an air of timidity,
which all her efforts could not overcome,
and which was increased by the conscious∣ness
of Madame Cheron's severe observation.
Her mourning dress, the mild dejection of
her beautiful countenance, and the retiring
diffidence of her manner, rendered her a
very interesting object to many of the
company, among whom she distinguished
Signor Montoni, and his friend Cavigni,
the late visitors at M. Quesnel's, who now
seemed to converse with Madame Cheron
with the familiarity of old acquaintance,
<PB N="325" REF="337"/>
and she to attend to them with particular
pleasure.</P>
<P>This Signor Montoni had an air of con∣scious
superiority, animated by spirit, and
strengthened by talents, to which every per∣son
seemed involuntarily to yield. The
quickness of his perceptions was strikingly
expressed on his countenance, yet that
countenance could submit implicitly to oc∣casion;
and, more than once in this day,
the triumph of art over nature might have
been discerned in it. His visage was
long, and rather narrow, yet he was called
handsome; and it was, perhaps, the spirit
and vigour of his soul, sparkling through
his features, that triumphed for him. Emily
felt admiration, but not the admiration
that leads to esteem; for it was mixed
with a degree of fear she knew not exactly
wherefore.</P>
<P>Cavigni was gay and insinuating as for∣merly;
and, though he paid almost inces∣sant
attention to Madame Cheron, he found
some opportunities of conversing with
<PB N="326" REF="338"/>
Emily, to whom he directed, at first, the
fallies of his wit, but now and then assumed
an air of tenderness, which she observed,
and shrunk from. Though she replied but
little, the gentleness and sweetness of her
manners encouraged him to talk, and she
felt relieved when a young lady of the
party, who spoke incessantly, obtruded her∣self
on his notice. This lady, who pos∣sessed
all the sprightliness of a French∣woman,
with all her coquetry, affected to
understand every subject, or rather there
was no affectation in the case; for, never
looking beyond the limits of her own ig∣norance,
she believed she had nothing
to learn. She attracted notice from all;
amused some, disgusted others for a mo∣ment,
and was then forgotten.</P>
<P>This day passed without any material oc∣currence;
and Emily, though amused by the
characters she had seen, was glad when she
could retire to the recollections, which had
acquired with her the character of duties.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="339"/>
A fortnight passed in a round of dissipa∣tion
and company, and Emily, who at∣tended
Madame Cheron in all her visits,
was sometimes entertained, but oftener
wearied. She was struck by the apparent
talents and knowledge displayed in the va∣rious
conversations she listened to, and it
was long before she discovered, that the ta∣lents
were for the most part those of impos∣ture,
and the knowledge nothing more than
was necessary to assist them. But what de∣ceived
her most, was the air of constant
gaiety and good spirits, displayed by every
visitor, and which she supposed to arise from
content as constant, and from benevolence
as ready. At length, from the over-acting
of some, less accomplished than the others,
she could perceive, that, though content∣ment
and benevolence are the only sure
sources of cheerfulness, the immoderate and
feverish animation, usually exhibited in
large parties, results partly from an insensi∣bility
to the cares, which benevolence must
sometimes derive from the sufferings of
<PB N="328" REF="340"/>
others, and partly from a desire to display
the appearance of that prosperity, which
they know will command submission and
attention to themselves.</P>
<P>Emily's pleasantest hours were passed in
the pavilion of the terrace, to which she re∣tired,
when she could steal from observation,
with a book to overcome, or a lute to in∣dulge,
her melancholy. There, as she sat
with her eyes fixed on the far-distant Pyre∣nées,
and her thoughts on Valancourt and
the beloved scenes of Gascony, she would
play the sweet and melancholy songs of her
native province—the popular songs she had
listened to from her childhood.</P>
<P>One evening, having excused herself from
accompanying her aunt abroad, she thus
withdrew to the pavilion, with books and
her lute. It was the mild and beautiful
evening of a sultry day, and the windows,
which fronted the west, opened upon all
the glory of a setting sun. Its rays illumi∣nated,
with strong splendour, the cliffs of
the Pyrenées, and touched their snowy tops
<PB N="329" REF="341"/>
with a roseate hue, that remained, long after
the sun had sunk below the horizon, and
the shades of twilight had stolen over the
landscape. Emily touched her lute with
that fine melancholy expression, which came
from her heart. The pensive hour and the
scene, the evening light on the Garonne,
that flowed at no great distance, and whose
waves, as they passed towards La Vallée,
she often viewed with a sigh,—these united
circumstances disposed her mind to tender∣ness,
and her thoughts were with Valan∣court;
of whom she had heard nothing since
her arrival at Tholouse, and now that she
was removed from him, and in uncertainty,
she perceived all the interest he held in her
heart. Before she saw Valancourt she had
never met a mind and taste so accordant
with her own, and, though Madame Che∣ron
told her much of the arts of dissimula∣tion,
and that the elegance and propriety of
thought, which she so much admired in
her lover, were assumed for the purpose of
pleasing her, she could scarcely doubt their
<PB N="330" REF="342"/>
truth. This possibility, however, faint as it
was, was sufficient to harass her mind with
anxiety, and she found, that few conditions
are more painful than that of uncertainty,
as to the merit of a beloved object; an
uncertainty, which she would not have suf∣fered,
had her confidence in her own opi∣nions
been greater.</P>
<P>She was awakened from her musing by
the sound of horses' feet along a road, that
wound under the windows of the pavilion,
and a gentleman passed on horseback, whose
resemblance to Valancourt, in air and figure,
for the twilight did not permit a view of
his features, immediately struck her. She
retired hastily from the lattice, fearing to
be seen, yet wishing to observe further,
while the stranger passed on without look∣ing
up, and, when she returned to the lattice,
she saw him faintly through the twilight,
winding under the high trees, that led to
Tholouse. This little incident so much dis∣turbed
her spirits, that the temple and its
scenery were no longer interesting to her,
<PB N="331" REF="343"/>
and, after walking a while on the terrace, she
returned to the chateau.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron, whether she had seen a
rival admired, had lost at play, or had wit∣nessed
an entertainment more splendid than
her own, was returned from her visit with
a temper more than usually discomposed;
and Emily was glad, when the hour arrived,
in which she could retire to the solitude of
her own apartment.</P>
<P>On the following morning, she was sum∣moned
to Madame Cheron, whose counte∣nance
was inflamed with resentment, and,
as Emily advanced, she held out a letter to
her.</P>
<P>"Do you know this hand?" said she, in
a severe tone, and with a look that was in∣tended,
to search her heart, while Emily ex∣amined
the letter attentively, and assured
her, that she did not.</P>
<P>"Do not provoke me," said her aunt;
"you do know it, confess the truth imme∣diately.
I insist upon your confessing the
truth instantly."</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="344"/>
Emily was silent, and turned to leave the
room, but Madame called her back. "O
you are guilty then," said she, "you do
know the hand." "If you was before in
doubt of this, madam," replied Emily calm∣ly,
"why did you accuse me of having
told a falsehood." Madame Cheron did not
blush; but her niece did, a moment after,
when she heard the name of Valancourt. It
was not, however, with the consciousness of
deserving reproof, for, if she ever had seen
his hand-writing, the present characters did
not bring it to her recollection.</P>
<P>"It is useless to deny it," said Madame
Cheron, "I see in your countenance, that
you are no stranger to this letter; and, I
dare say, you have received many such from
this impertinent young man, without my
knowledge, in my own house."</P>
<P>Emily, shocked at the indelicacy of this
accusation, still more than by the vulgarity
of the former, instantly forgot the pride, that
had imposed silence, and endeavoured to
<PB N="333" REF="345"/>
vindicate herself from the aspersion, but Ma∣dame
Cheron was not to be convinced.</P>
<P>"I cannot suppose," she resumed, "that
this young man would have taken the liberty
of writing to me, if you had not encouraged
him to do so, and I must now"—"You
will allow me to remind you, madam," said
Emily timidly, "of some particulars of a
conversation we had at La Vallée. I then
told you truly, that I had only not forbade
Monsieur Valancourt from addressing my
family."</P>
<P>"I will not be interrupted," said Madame
Cheron, interrupting her niece, "I was go∣ing
to say—I—I—have forgot what I was
going to say. But how happened it that you
did not forbid him?" Emily was silent.
"How happened it that you encouraged
him to trouble me with this letter?—A
young man that nobody knows;—an utter
stranger in the place,—a young adventurer,
no doubt, who is looking out for a good
fortune. However, on that point he has
mistaken his aim."</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="346"/>
"His family was known to my father,"
said Emily modestly; and without appear∣ing
to be sensible of the last sentence.</P>
<P>"O! that is no recommendation at all,"
replied her aunt, with her usual readiness
upon this topic; "he took such strange
fanciès to people! He was always judging
persons by their countenances, and was con∣tinually
deceived." "Yet it was but now,
madam, that you judged me guilty by my
countenance," said Emily, with a design of
reproving Madame Cheron, to which she
was induced by this disrespectful mention of
her father.</P>
<P>"I called you here," resumed her aunt,
colouring, "to tell you, that I will not be
disturbed in my own house by any letters, or
visits from young men, who may take a
fancy to flatter you. This M. de Valantine—I
think you call him, has the imperti∣nence
to beg I will permit him to pay his
respects to me! I shall send him a proper
answer. And for you, Emily, I repeat it
once for all—if you are not contented to
<PB N="335" REF="347"/>
conform to my directions, and to my way
of life, I shall give up the task of overlook∣ing
your conduct—I shall no longer trouble
myself with your education, but shall send
you to board in a convent."</P>
<P>"Dear madam," said Emily, bursting
into tears, and overcome by the rude sus∣picions
her aunt had expressed, "how have
I deserved these reproofs!" She could say
no more; and so very fearful was she of
acting with any degree of impropriety in the
affair itself, that, at the present moment,
Madame Cheron might perhaps have pre∣vailed
with her to bind herself by a promise
to renounce Valancourt for ever. Her mind,
weakened by her terrors, would no longer
suffer her to view him as she had formerly
done; she feared the error of her own judg∣ment,
not that of Madame Cheron, and
feared also, that, in her former conversation
with him, at La Vallée, she had not con∣ducted
herself with sufficient reserve. She
knew, that she did not deserve the coarse
suspicions, which her aunt had thrown out,
<PB N="336" REF="348"/>
but a thousand scruples rose to torment her,
such as would never have disturbed the
peace of Madame Cheron. Thus rendered
anxious to avoid every opportunity of er∣ring,
and willing to submit to any restric∣tions,
that her aunt should think proper,
she expressed an obedience, to which Ma∣dame
Cheron did not give much confidence,
and which she seemed to consider as the
consequence of either fear, or artifice.</P>
<P>"Well then," said she, "promise me
that you will neither see this young man,
nor write to him without my consent."—"Dear,
madam," replied Emily, "can you
suppose I would do either, unknown to
you!" "I don't know what to suppose;
there is no knowing how young women will
act. It is difficult to place any confidence
in them, for they have seldom sense enough
to wish for the respect of the world."</P>
<P>"Alas, madam!" said Emily, "I am
anxious for my own respect; my father
taught me the value of that; he said if I de∣served
<PB N="337" REF="349"/>
my own esteem, that of the world
would follow of course."</P>
<P>"My brother was a good kind of a man,"
replied Madame Cheron, "but he did not
know the world. I am sure I have always
felt a proper respect for myself, yet—"
She stopped, but she might have added, that
the world had not always shewn respect to
her, and this without impeaching its judg∣ment.</P>
<P>"Well!" resumed Madame Cheron,
"you have not given me the promise,
though, that I demand." Emily readily
gave it, and, being then suffered to with∣draw,
she walked in the garden; tried to
compose her spirits, and, at length, arrived
at her favourite pavilion at the end of the
terrace, where, seating herself at one of the
embowered windows, that opened upon a
balcony, the stillness and seclusion of the
scene allowed her to recollect her thoughts,
and to arrange them so as to form a clearer
judgment of her former conduct. She en∣deavoured
to review with exactness all the
<PB N="338" REF="350"/>
particulars of her conversation with Valan∣court
at La Vallée, had the satisfaction to
observe nothing, that could alarm her deli∣cate
pride, and thus to be confirmed in the
self-esteem, which was so necessary to her
peace. Her mind then became tranquil,
and she saw Valancourt amiable and intelli∣gent,
as he had formerly appeared, and Ma∣dame
Cheron neither the one, or the other.
The remembrance of her lover, however,
brought with it many very painful emo∣tions,
for it by no means reconciled her to
the thought of resigning him; and, Madame
Cheron having already shewn how highly
she disapproved of the attachment, she fore∣saw
much suffering from the opposition of
interests; yet with all this was mingled a
degree of delight, which, in spite of reason,
partook of hope. She determined, however,
that no consideration should induce her to
permit a ciandestine correspondence, and to
observe in her conversation with Valancourt,
should they ever meet again, the same nicety
of reserve, which had hitherto marked her
<PB N="339" REF="351"/>
conduct. As she repeated the words—"should
we ever meet again!" she shrunk
as if this was a circumstance, which had
never before occurred to her, and tears came
to her eyes, which she hastily dried, for she
heard footsteps approaching, and then the
door of the pavilion open, and, on turning,
she saw—Valancourt. An emotion of mingled
pleasure, surprise and apprehension pressed
so suddenly upon her heart as almost to
overcome her spirits; the colour left her
cheeks, then returned brighter than before,
and she was for a moment unable to speak,
or to rise from her chair. His countenance
was the mirror, in which she saw her own
emotions reflected, and it roused her to self-command.
The joy, which had animated
his features, when he entered the pavilion,
was suddenly repressed, as, approaching, he
perceived her agitation, and, in a tremulous
voice, enquired after her health. Recovered
from her first surprise, she answered him
with a tempered smile; but a variety of op∣posite
emotions still assailed her heart, and
<PB N="340" REF="352"/>
struggled to subdue the mild dignity of her
manner. It was difficult to tell which pre∣dominated—the
joy of seeing Valancourt, or
the terror of her aunt's displeasure, when she
should hear of this meeting. After some
short and embarrassed conversation, she led
him into the gardens, and enquired if he
had seen Madame Cheron." "No," said
he, "I have not yet seen her, for they told
me she was engaged, and as soon as I
learned that you were in the gardens, I came
hither." He paused a moment, in great agi∣tation,
and then added, "May I venture to
tell you the purport of my visit, without
incurring your displeasure, and to hope,
that you will not accuse me of precipitation
in now availing myself of the permission
you once gave me of addressing your fa∣mily?"
Emily, who knew not what to re∣ply,
was spared from further perplexity, and
was sensible only of fear, when, on raising
her eyes, she saw Madame Cheron turn into
the avenue. As the consciousness of inno∣cence
returned, this fear was so far dissipated
<PB N="341" REF="353"/>
as to permit her to appear tranquil, and,
instead of avoiding her aunt, she advanced
with Valancourt to meet her. The look of
haughty and impatient displeasure, with which
Madame Cheron regarded them, made Emily
shrink, who understood from a single glance,
that this meeting was believed to have been
more than accidental: having mentioned
Valancourt's name, she became again too
much agitated to remain with them, and
returned into the chateau; where she
awaited long, in a state of trembling anxiety,
the conclusion of the conference. She
knew not how to account for Valancourt's
visit to her aunt, before he had received the
permission he solicited, since she was ignorant
of a circumstance, which would have rendered
the request useless, even if Madame Cheron
had been inclined to grant it. Valancourt,
in the agitation of his spirits, had forgotten
to date his letter, so that it was impossible
for Madame Cheron to return an answer;
and, when he recollected this circumstance,
he was, perhaps, not so sorry for the omis∣sion
<PB N="342" REF="354"/>
as glad of the excuse it allowed him
for waiting on her before she could send a
refusal.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron had a long conversation
with Valancourt, and, when she returned to
the chateau, her countenance expressed ill
humour, but not the degree of severity,
which Emily had apprehended. "I have
dismissed this young man, at last," said she,
"and I hope my house will never again
be disturbed with similar visits. He as∣sures
me, that your interview was not pre∣concerted."</P>
<P>"Dear madam!" said Emily in extreme
emotion, "you surely did not ask him the
question!" "Most certainly I did; you
could not suppose I should be so imprudent
as to neglect it."</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what
an opinion must he form of me, since you,
Madam, could express a suspicion of such
ill conduct!"</P>
<P>"It is of very little consequence what
opinion he may form of you," replied her
<PB N="343" REF="355"/>
aunt, "for I have put an end to the affair;
but I believe he will not form a worse opi∣nion
of me for my prudent conduct. I let
him see, that I was not to be trifled with;
and that I had more delicacy, than to permit
any clandestine correspondence to be carried
on in my house."</P>
<P>Emily had frequently heard Madame Che∣ron
use the word delicacy, but she was now
more than usually perplexed to understand
how she meant to apply it in this instance,
in which her whole conduct appeared to
merit the very reverse of the term.</P>
<P>"It was very inconsiderate of my bro∣ther,"
resumed Madame Cheron, "to leave
the trouble of overlooking your conduct to
me; I wish you was well settled in life. But if
I find, that I am to be further troubled with
such visitors as this M. Valancourt, I shall
place you in a convent at once;—so remember
the alternative. This young man has the im∣pertinence
to own to me,—he owns it! that
his fortune is very small, and that he is
chiefly dependent on an elder brother and
<PB N="344" REF="356"/>
on the profession he has chosen! He should
have concealed these circumstances, at least,
if he expected to succeed with me. Had he
the presumption to suppose I would marry
my niece to a person such as he describes
himself!"</P>
<P>Emily dried her tears when she heard of
the candid confession of Valancourt; and,
though the circumstances it discovered were
afflicting to her hopes, his artless conduct
gave her a degree of pleasure, that overcame
every other emotion. But she was compelled,
even thus early in life, to observe, that good
sense and noble integrity are not always suf∣ficient
to cope with folly and narrow cun∣ning;
and her heart was pure enough to al∣low
her, even at this trying moment, to look
with more pride on the defeat of the former,
than with mortification on the conquests of
the latter.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron pursued her triumph.—"He
has also thought proper to tell me,
that he will receive his dismission from no
person but yourself; this favour, however,
<PB N="345" REF="357"/>
I have absolutely refused him. He shall
learn, that it is quite sufficient, that I disap∣prove
him. And I take this opportunity of
repeating,—that if you concert any means of
interview unknown to me, you shall leave
my house immediately."</P>
<P>"How little do you know me, madam,
that you should think such an injunction
necessary!" said Emily, trying to suppress
her emotion, "how little of the dear pa∣rents,
who educated me!"</P>
<P>Madame Cheron now went to dress for an
engagement, which she had made for the
evening; and Emily, who would gladly
have been excused from attending her aunt,
did not ask to remain at home lest her request
should be attributed to an improper motive.
When she retired to her own room, the little
fortitude, which had supported her in the
presence of her relation, forsook her; she re∣membered
only that Valancourt, whose cha∣racter
appeared more amiable from every
circumstance, that unfolded it, was banished
from her presence, perhaps, for ever, and
<PB N="346" REF="358"/>
she passed the time in weeping, which, ac∣cording
to her aunt's direction, she ought to
have employed in dressing. This important
duty was, however, quickly dispatched;
though, when she joined Madame Cheron
at table, her eyes betrayed, that she had been
in tears, and drew upon her a severe re∣proof.</P>
<P>Her efforts to appear cheerful did not en∣tirely
fail when she joined the company at the
house of Madame Clairval, an elderly widow
lady, who had lately come to reside at Tho∣louse,
on an estate of her late husband. She had
lived many years at Paris in a splendid style;
had naturally a gay temper, and, since her
residence at Tholouse, had given some of the
most magnificent entertainments, that had
been seen in that neighbourhood.</P>
<P>These excited not only the envy, but the
trifling ambition of Madame Cheron, who,
since she could not rival the splendour of
her festivities, was desirous of being ranked
in the number of her most intimate friends.
For this purpose she paid her the most ob∣sequious
<PB N="347" REF="359"/>
sequious attention, and made a point of being
disengaged, whenever she received an invi∣tation
from Madame Clairval, of whom she
talked, wherever she went, and derived much
self-consequence from impressing a belief
on her general acquaintance, that they were
on the most familiar footing.</P>
<P>The entertainments of this evening con∣sisted
of a ball and supper; it was a fancy
ball, and the company danced in groups in
the gardens, which were very extensive.
The high and luxuriant trees, under which
the groups assembled, were illuminated with
a profusion of lamps, disposed with taste and
fancy. The gay and various dresses of the
company, some of whom were seated on the
turf, conversing at their ease, observing
the cotillons, taking refreshments, and some∣times
touching sportively a guitar; the
gallant manners of the gentlemen, the ex∣quisitely
capricious air of the ladies; the
light fantastic steps of their dances; the mu∣sicians,
with the lute, the hautboy, and the
tabor, seated at the foot of an elm, and the
<PB N="348" REF="360"/>
sylvan scenery of woods around were cir∣cumstances,
that unitedly formed a charac∣teristic
and striking picture of French festi∣vity.
Emily surveyed the gaiety of the scene
with a melancholy kind of pleasure, and her
emotion may be imagined when, as she stood
with her aunt, looking at one of the groups,
she perceived Valancourt; saw him dancing
with a young and beautiful lady, saw him
conversing with her with a mixture of at∣tention
and familiarity, such as she had sel∣dom
observed in his manner. She turned
hastily from the scene, and attempted to
draw away Madame Cheron, who was con∣versing
with Signor Cavigni, and neither
perceived Valancourt, or was willing to
be interrupted. A faintness suddenly came
over Emily, and, unable to support herself,
she sat down on a turf bank beneath the
trees, where several other persons were
seated. One of these, observing the ex∣treme
paleness of her countenance, enquired
if she was ill, and begged she would allow
him to fetch her a glass of water, for which
<PB N="349" REF="361"/>
politeness she thanked him, but did not
accept it. Her apprehension lest Valan∣court
should observe her emotion made her
anxious to overcome it, and she succeeded
so far as to re-compose her countenance.
Madame Cheron was still conversing with
Cavigni; and the Count Bauvillers, who
had addressed Emily, made some observa∣tions
upon the scene; to which she answered
almost unconsciously, for her mind was still
occupied with the idea of Valancourt, to
whom it was with extreme uneasiness that
she remained so near. Some remarks, how∣ever,
which the Count made upon the dance
obliged her to turn her eyes towards it, and,
at that moment, Valancourt's met hers. Her
colour faded again, she felt, that she was re∣lapsing
into faintness, and instantly averted
her looks, but not before she had observed
the altered countenance of Valancourt, on
perceiving her. She would have left the
spot immediately, had she not been consci∣ous,
that this conduct would have shewn
him more obviously the interest he held in
<PB N="350" REF="362"/>
her heart; and, having tried to attend to
the Count's conversation and to join in it,
she, at length, recovered her spirits. But,
when he made some observation on Valan∣court's
partner, the fear of shewing, that she
was interested in the remark, would have
betrayed it to him, had not the Count,
while he spoke, looked towards the person
of whom he was speaking. "The lady,"
said he, "dancing with that young cheva∣lier,
who appears to be accomplished in
every thing, but in dancing, is ranked
among the beauties of Tholouse. She is
handsome, and her fortune will be very
large, I hope she will make a better choice
in a partner for life than she has done in a
partner for the dance, for I observe he has
just put the set into great confusion; he does
nothing but commit blunders. I am surprised,
that, with his air and figure, he has
not taken more care to accomplish himself
in dancing."</P>
<P>Emily, whose heart trembled at every
word, that was now uttered, endeavoured to
<PB N="351" REF="363"/>
turn the conversation from Valancourt, by
enquiring the name of the lady, with whom
he danced; but, before the Count could re∣ply,
the dance concluded, and Emily, per∣ceiving
that Valancourt was coming towards
her, rose and joined Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"Here is the Chevalier Valancourt, ma∣dam,"
said she in a whisper, "pray let us
go." Her aunt immediately moved on, but
not before Valancourt had reached them, who
bowed lowly to Madame Cheron, and with
an earnest and dejected look to Emily, with
whom, notwithstanding all her effort, an air
of more than common reserve prevailed.
The presence of Madame Cheron prevented
Valancourt from remaining, and he passed
on with a countenance, whose melancholy
reproached her for having increased it.
Emily was called from the musing fit, into
which he had fallen, by the Count Bauvil∣lers,
who was known to her aunt.</P>
<P>"I have your pardon to beg, ma'amselle,"
said he, "for a rudeness, which you will
readily believe was quite, unintentional. I
<PB N="352" REF="364"/>
did not know, that the Chevalier was your
acquaintance, when I so freely criticised his
dancing." Emily blushed and smiled, and
Madame Cheron spared her the difficulty of
replying. "If you mean the person, who
has just passed us," said she, "I can assure
you he is no acquaintance of either mine, or
ma'amselle St. Aubert's: I know nothing
of him."</P>
<P>"O! that is the chevalier Valancourt,"
said Cavigni carelessly, and looking back.
"You know him then?" said Madame Che∣ron.
"I am not acquainted with him," re∣plied
Cavigni. "You don't know, then, the
reason I have to call him impertinent;—he
as had the presumption to admire my niece!"</P>
<P>"If every man deserves the title of im∣pertinent,
who admires ma'amselle St. Au∣bert,
"replied Cavigni, "I fear there are
a great many impertinents, and I am will∣ing
to acknowledge myself one of the num∣ber."</P>
<P>"O signor!" said Madame Cheron, with
an affected smile, "I perceive you have
<PB N="353" REF="365"/>
learnt the art of complimenting, since you
came into France. But it is cruel to com∣pliment
children, since they mistake flattery
for truth."</P>
<P>Cavigni turned away his face for a mo∣ment,
and then said with a studied air,
"Whom then are we to compliment, madam?
for it would be absurd to compliment a wo∣man
of refined understanding; <HI>she</HI> is above
all praise." As he finished the sentence
he gave Emily a sly look, and the smile, that
had lurked in his eye, stole forth. She per∣fectly
understood it, and blushed for Ma∣dame
Cheron, who replied, "You are per∣fectly
right, signor, no woman of under∣standing
can endure compliment."</P>
<P>"I have heard signor Montoni say," re∣joined
Cavigni, "that he never knew but
one woman who deserved it."</P>
<P>"Well!" exclaimed Madame Cheron,
with a short laugh, and a smile of unutterable
complacency, "and who could she be?"</P>
<P>"O!" replied Cavigni, "it is impossible
to mistake her, for certainly there is not
<PB N="354" REF="366"/>
more than one woman in the world, who
has both the merit to deserve compliment
and the wit to refuse it. Most women re∣verse
the case entirely." He looked again
at Emily, who blushed deeper than before
for her aunt, and turned from him with dis∣pleasure.</P>
<P>"Well, signor!" said Madame Cheron,
"I protest you are a Frenchman; I never
heard a foreigner say any thing half so gal∣lant
as that!"</P>
<P>"True, madam," said the Count, who
had been some time silent, and with a low
bow, "but the gallantry of the compliment
had been utterly lost, but for the ingenuity
that discovered the application."</P>
<P>Madame Cheron did not perceive the
meaning of this too satirical sentence, and
she, therefore, escaped the pain, which Emi∣ly
felt on her account. "O! here comes
signor Montoni himself," said her aunt, "I
protest I will tell him all the fine things
you have been saying to me." The signor,
however, passed at this moment into another
<PB N="355" REF="367"/>
walk. "Pray, who is it, that has so much
engaged your friend this evening?" asked
Madame Cheron, with an air of chagrin,
"I have not seen him once."</P>
<P>"He hid a very particular engagement
with the Marquis I a Rivière," replied Ca∣vigni,
"which has detained him, I per∣ceive,
till this moment, or he would have
done himself the honour of paying his re∣spects
to you, madam, sooner, as he com∣missioned
me to say. But, I know not how
it is—your conversation is so fascinating—that
it can charm even memory, I think, or
I should certainly have delivered my friend's
apology before."</P>
<P>"The apology, fir, would have been more
satisfactory from himself," said Madame
Cheron, whose vanity was more mortified by
Montoni's neglect, than flattered by Ca∣vigni's
compliment. Her manner, at this
moment, and Cavigni's late conversation,
now awakened a suspicion inEmily's mind,
which, notwithstanding that some recol∣lections
served to confirm it appeared prepo∣sterous.
<PB N="356" REF="368"/>
She thought she perceived, that
Montoni was paying serious addresses to
her aunt, and that she not only accepted
them, but was jealously watchful of any
appearance of neglect on his part.—That
Madame Cheron at her years should
elect a second husband was ridiculous,
though her vanity made it not impossible;
but that Montoni, with his discernment,
his figure, and pretensions, should make a
choice of Madame Cheron—appeared most
wonderful. Her thoughts, however, did
not dwell long on the subject; nearer inte∣rests
pressed upon them; Valancourt, re∣jected
of her aunt, and Valancourt dancing
with a gay and beautiful partner, alternately
tormented her mind. As she passed along
the gardens she looked timidly forward, half
fearing and half hoping that he might
appear in the crowd; and the disappoint∣ment
she felt on not seeing him, told her,
that she had hoped more than she had feared.</P>
<P>Montoni soon after joined the party.
He muttered over some short speech about
<PB N="357" REF="369"/>
regret for having been so long detained
elsewhere, when he knew he should have the
pleasure of seeing Madame Cheron here; and
she, receiving the apology with the air of a
pettish girl, addressed herself entirely to Ca∣vigni,
who looked archly at Montoni, as if
he would have said, "I will not triumph
over you too much; I will have the good∣ness
to bear my honours meekly; but look
sharp, signor, or I shall certainly run away
with your prize."</P>
<P>The supper was served in different pavi∣lions
in the gardens, as well as in one large
saloon of the chateau, and with more of
taste, than either of splendour, or even of
plenty. Madame Cheron and her party
supped with Madame Clairval in the sa∣loon,
and Emily, with difficulty, disguised
her emotion, when she saw Valancourt placed
at the same table with herself. There, Ma∣dame
Cheron having surveyed him with
high displeasure, said to some person who
sat next to her, "Pray, who <HI>is</HI> that young
man?" "It is the Chevalier Valancourt,"
was the answer. "Yes, I am not ignorant
<PB N="358" REF="370"/>
of his name, but who is this Chevalier Va∣lancourt
that thus intrudes himself at this
table?" The attention of the person, to
whom she spoke, was called off before she
received a second reply. The table, at
which they sat, was very long, and, Valan∣court
being seated, with his partner, near
the bottom, and Emily near the top, the
distance between them may account for his
not immediately perceiving her. She avoid∣ed
looking to that end of the table, but,
whenever her eyes happened to glance to∣wards
it, she observed him conversing
with his beautiful companion, and the ob∣servation
did not contribute to restore her
peace, any more than the accounts she
heard of the fortune and accomplishments of
this same lady.</P>
<P>Madame Cheron, to whom these remarks
were sometimes addressed, because they sup∣ported
topics for trivial conversation, seemed
indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate
Valancourt, towards whom she felt all the
petty resentment of a narrow pride, "I
<PB N="359" REF="371"/>
admire the lady," said she, "but I must
condemn her choice of a partner." "Oh,
the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the most
accomplished young men we have," replied
the lady, to whom this remark was ad∣dressed;
"it is whispered, that Mademoi∣selle
D'Emery, and her very large fortune,
are to be his."</P>
<P>"Impossible!" exclaimed Madame Che∣ron,
reddening with vexation," it is impossi∣ble
that she can be so destitute of taste; he
has so little the air of a person of condition,
that, if I did not see him at the table of
Madame Clairval, I should never have sus∣pected
him to be one. I have besides par∣ticular
reasons for believing the report to
be erroneous."</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt the truth of it," replied
the lady gravely, disgusted by the abrupt
contradiction she had received, concerning
her opinion of Valancourt's merit. "You
will, perhaps, doubt it," said Madame
Cheron, "when I assure you, that it was
only this morning that I rejected his suit."
<PB N="360" REF="372"/>
This was said without any intention of im∣posing
the meaning it conveyed, but simply
from a habit of considering herself to be the
most important person in every affair that
concerned her niece, and because literally
she had rejected Valancourt. "Your rea∣sons
are indeed such as cannot be doubted,"
replied the lady, with an ironical smile.—"Any
more than the discernment of the
Chevalier Valancourt," added Cavigni,
who stood by the chair of Madame Che∣ron,
and had heard her arrogate to herself,
as he thought, a distinction which had been
paid to her niece. "His discernment <HI>may</HI>
be justly questioned, signor," said Madame
Cheron, who was not flattered by what she
understood to be an encomium upon Emily.</P>
<P>"Alas!" exclaimed Cavigni, surveying
Madame Cheron with affected ecstasy,
"how vain is that assertion, while that face—that
shape—that air—combine to refute
it! Unhappy Valancourt! his discernment
has been his destruction."</P>
<P>Emily looked surprised and embarrassed;
the lady, who had lately spoken, astonished,
<PB N="361" REF="373"/>
and Madame Cheron, who, though she
did not perfectly understand this speech,
was very ready to believe herself compli∣mented
by it, said smilingly, "O Signor!
you are very gallant; but those, who hear
you vindicate the chevalier's discernment,
will suppose that I am the object of it."</P>
<P>"They cannot doubt it," replied Ca∣vigni,
bowing low.</P>
<P>"And would not that be very mortify∣ing,
Signor?"</P>
<P>"Unquestionably it would," said Ca∣vigni.</P>
<P>"I cannot endure the thought," said
Madame Cheron.</P>
<P>"It is not to be endured," replied Ca∣vigni.</P>
<P>"What can be done to prevent so humi∣liating a mistake?" rejoined Madame Che∣ron.</P>
<P>"Alas! I cannot assist you," replied Ca∣vigni, with a deliberating air. "Your only
chance of refuting the calumny, and of
making people understand what you wish
<PB N="362" REF="374"/>
them to believe, is to persist in your first
assertion; for, when they are told of the
chevalier's want of discernment, it is possi∣ble
they may suppose he never presumed to
distress you with his admiration.—But then
again—that diffidence, which renders you
so insensible to your own perfections—they
will consider this, and Valancourt's taste
will not be doubted, though you arraign it.
In short, they will, in spite of your endea∣vours,
continue to believe, what might very
naturally have occurred to them without
any hint of mine—that the chevalier has
taste enough to admire a beautiful woman."</P>
<P>"All this is very distressing!" said Ma∣dame
Cheron, with a profound sigh.</P>
<P>"May I be allowed to ask what is so
distressing?" said Madame Clairval, who
was struck with the rueful countenance and
doleful accent, with which this was deli∣vered.</P>
<P>"It is a delicate subject," replied Madame
Cheron, "a very mortifying one to me."
"I am concerned to hear it," said Ma∣dame
<PB N="363" REF="375"/>
dame Clairval, "I hope nothing has oc∣curred,
this evening, particularly to di∣stress you?"
"Alas, yes! within this half
hour; and I know not where the report
may end;—my pride was never so shocked
before, but I assure yon the report is to∣tally
void of foundation." "Good God!"
exclaimed Madame Clairval, "what can be
done? Can you point out any way, by
which I can assist, or console you?"</P>
<P>"The only way, by which you can do
either," replied Madame Cheron, "is to
contradict the report wherever you go."</P>
<P>"Well! but pray inform me what I am
to contradict."</P>
<P>"It is so very humiliating, that I know
not how to mention it," continued Madame
Cheron, "but you shall judge. Do you
observe that young man seated near the bot∣tom
of the table, who is conversing with
Mademoiselle D'Emery?" "Yes, I per∣ceive
whom you mean." "You observe
how little he has the air of a person of con∣dition;
I was saying just now, that I should
<PB N="364" REF="376"/>
not have thought him a gentleman, if I
had not seen him at this table." "Well!
but the report," said Madame Clairva,
"let me understand the subject of your di∣stress."
"Ah! the subject of my distress,"
replied Madame Cheron; "this person,
whom nobody knows—(I beg pardon, ma∣dam,
I did not consider what I said)—this
impertinent young man, having had the
presumption to address my niece, has, I
fear, given rise to a report, that he had de∣clared
himself my admirer. Now only con∣sider
how very mortifying such a report must
be! You, I know, will feel for my situ∣ation.
A woman of my condition!—think
how degrading even the rumour of such
an alliance must be."</P>
<P>"Degrading indeed, my poor friend!"
said Madame Clairval. "You may rely upon
it I will contradict the report wherever I
go;"
as she said which, she turned her at∣tention
upon another part of the company;
and Cavigni, who had hitherto appeared a
grave spectator of the scene, now fearing
<PB N="365" REF="377"/>
he should be unable to smother the laugh,
that convulsed him, walked abruptly away.</P>
<P>"I perceive you do not know," said the
lady who sat near Madame Cheron, "that
the gentleman you have been speaking of is
Madame Clairval's nephew!" "Impossi∣ble!"
exclaimed Madame Cheron, who now
began to perceive, that she had been totally
mistaken in her judgment of Valancourt,
and to praise him aloud with as much ser∣vility,
as she had before censured him with
frivolous malignity.</P>
<P>Emily, who, during the greater part of
this conversation, had been so absorbed in
thought as to be spared the pain of hearing
it, was now extremely surprised by her
aunt's praise of Valancourt, with whose
relationship to Madame Clairval she was
unacquainted; but she was not sorry when
Madame Cheron, who, though she now
tried to appear unconcerned, was really much
embarrassed, prepared to withdraw imme∣diately
after supper. Montoni then came to
hand Madame Cheron to her carriage, and
Cavigni, with an arch solemnity of counte∣nance,
<PB N="366" REF="378"/>
nance, followed with Emily, who, as she
wished them good night, and drew up the
glass, saw Valancourt among the crowd at
the gates. Before the carriage drove off,
he disappeared. Madame Cheron forbore
to mention him to Emily, and, as soon as
they reached the chateau, they separated for
the night.</P>
<P>On the following morning, as Emily sat
at breakfast with her aunt, a letter was
brought to her, of which she knew the
hand-writing upon the cover; and, as she
received it with a trembling hand, Madame
Cheron hastily enquired from whom it
came. Emily, with her leave, broke the
seal, and, observing the signature of Valan∣court,
gave it unread to her aunt, who re∣ceived
it with impatience; and, as she
looked it over, Emily endeavoured to
read on her countenance its contents. Hav∣ing
returned the letter to her niece, whose
eyes asked if she might examine it, "Yes,
read it, child," said Madame Cheron, in
a manner less severe than she had expected,
<PB N="367" REF="379"/>
and Emily had, perhaps, never before so
willingly obeyed her aunt. In this letter
Valancourt said little of the interview of
the preceding day, but concluded with de∣claring,
that he would accept his dismission
from Emily only, and with entreating, that
she would allow him to wait upon her, on
the approaching evening. When she read
this, she was astonished at the moderation of
Madame Cheron, and looked at her with
timid expectation, as she said sorrowfully—"What
am I to say, madam?"</P>
<P>"Why—we must see the young man, I
believe," replied her aunt, "and hear what
he has further to say for himself. You
may tell him he may come." Emily dared
scarcely credit what she heard. "Yet, stay,"
added Madame Cheron, "I will tell him so
myself." She called for pen and ink;
Emily still not daring to trust the emotions
she felt, and almost sinking beneath them.
Her surprise would have been less had she
overheard, on the preceding evening, what
Madame Cheron had not forgotten—that
<PB N="368" REF="380"/>
Valancourt was the nephew of Madame
Clairval.</P>
<P>"What were the "particulars of her aunt's
note Emily did not learn, but the result was
a visit from Valancourt in the evening,
whom Madame Cheron received alone,
and they had a long conversation before
Emily was called down. When she en∣tered
the room, her aunt was conversing
with complacency, and she saw the eyes of
Valancourt, as he impatiently rose, ani∣mated
with hope.</P>
<P>"We have been talking over this affair,"
said Madame Cheron," the chevalier has
been telling me, that the late Monsieur
Clairval was the brother of the Countess de
Duvarney, his mother. I only wish he had
mentioned his relationship to Madame
Clairval before, I certainly should have
considered that circumstance as a sufficient
introduction to my house." Valancourt
bowed, and was going to address Emily,
but her aunt prevented him. "I have,
therefore, consented, that you shall receive
his visits; and, though I will not bind
<PB N="369" REF="381"/>
myself by any promise, or say, that I shall
consider him as my nephew, yet I shall per∣mit
the intercourse, and shall look forward
to any further connection as an event,
which may possibly take place in a course
of years, provided the chevalier rises in his
profession, or any circumstance occurs,
which may make it prudent for him to
take a wife. But Mons. Valancourt will
observe, and you too, Emily, that, till that
happens, I positively forbid any thoughts
of marrying."</P>
<P>Emily's countenance, during this coarse
speech, varied every instant, and, towards
its conclusion, her distress had so much in∣creased,
that she was on the point of leaving
the room. Valancourt, meanwhile, scarcely
less embarrassed, did not dare to look at
her, for whom he was thus distressed; but,
when Madame Cheron was silent, he said,
"Flattering, madam, as your approbation
is to me—highly as I am honoured by it—I
have yet so much to fear, that I scarcely
dare to hope." "Pray, sir, explain your-self,"
<PB N="370" REF="382"/>
self," said Madame Cheron; an unexpected
requisition, which embarrassed Valancourt
again, and almost overcame him with confu∣sion,
at circumstances, on which, had he been
only a spectator of the scene, he would have
smiled.</P>
<P>"Till I receive Mademoiselle St. Au∣bert's
permission to accept your indul∣gence,"
said he, falteringly—" till she al∣lows
me to hope—"</P>
<P>"O! is that all?" interrupted Madame
Cheron. "Well, I will take upon me to
answer for her. But at the same time, sir,
give me leave to observe to you, that I am
her guardian, and that I expect, in every
instance, that my will is hers."</P>
<P>As she said this, she rose and quitted the
room, leaving Emily and Valancourt in a
state of mutual embarrassment; and, when
Valancourt's hopes enabled him to over∣come
his fears, and to address her with the
zeal and sincerity so natural to him, it was
a considerable time before she was susfici∣ently
<PB N="371" REF="383"/>
recovered to hear with distinctness his
solicitations and enquiries.</P>
<P>The conduct of Madame Cheron in this
affair had been entirely governed by selfish
vanity. Valancourt, in his first interview,
had with great candour laid open to her
the true state of his present circumstances,
and his future expectancies, and she, with
more prudence than humanity, had abso∣lutely
and abruptly rejected his suit. She
wished her niece to marry ambitiously, not
because she desired to see her in posses∣sion
of the happiness, which rank and
wealth are usually believed to bestow, but
because she desired to partake the import∣ance,
which such an alliance would give,
When, therefore, she discovered that Va∣lancourt
was the nephew of a person of so
much consequence as Madame Clairval, she
became anxious for the connection, since
the prospect it afforded of future fortune
and distinction for Emily, promised the ex∣altation
she coveted for herself. Her cal∣culations
concerning fortune in this alli∣ance
<PB N="372" REF="384"/>
were guided rather by her wishes,
than by any hint of Valancourt or strong
appearance of probability; and, when she
rested her expectation on the wealth of
Madame Clairval, she seemed totally to have
forgotten, that the latter had a daughter.
Valancourt, however, had not forgotten this
circumstance, and the consideration of it
had made him so modest in his expectations
from Madame Clairval, that he had not even
named the relationship in his first conversa∣tion
with Madame Cheron. But, whatever
might be the future fortune of Emily, the
present distinction, which the connection
would afford for herself; was certain, since
the splendour of Madame Clairval's esta∣blishment
was such as to excite the general
envy and partial imitation of the neigh∣bourhood.
Thus had she consented to
involve her niece in an engagement, to
which she saw only a distant and uncertain
conclusion, with as little consideration of her
happiness, as when she had so precipitately
forbade it: for though she herself pos∣sessed
<PB N="373" REF="385"/>
the means of rendering this union not
only certain, but prudent, yet to do so was
no part of her present intention.</P>
<P>From this period Valancourt made fre∣quent
visits to Madame Cheron, and Emily
passed in his society the happiest hours she
had known since the death of her father.
They were both too much engaged by the
present moments to give serious considera∣tion
to the future. They loved and were
beloved, and saw not, that the very attach∣ment,
which formed the delight of their pre∣sent days, might possibly occasion the suf∣ferings
of years. Meanwhile, Madame
Cheron's intercourse with Madame Clair∣val
became more frequent than before, and
her vanity was already gratified by the op∣portunity
of proclaiming, wherever she
went, the attachment that subsisted between
their nephew and niece.</P>
<P>Montoni was now also become a daily
guest at the chateau, and Emily was com∣pelled
to observe, that he really was a fui∣tor,
and a favoured suitor, to her aunt.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="386"/>
Thus passed the winter months, not only
in peace, but in happiness, to Valancourt
and Emily; the station of his regiment be∣ing
so near Tholouse, as to allow this fre∣quent
intercourse. The pavilion on the
terrace was the favourite scene of their in∣terviews,
and there Emily, with Madame
Cheron, would work, while Valancourt
read aloud works of genius and taste, lis∣tened
to her enthusiasm, expressed his own,
and caught new opportunities of observing,
that their minds were formed to constitute
the happiness of each other, the same taste,
the same noble and benevolent sentiments
animating each.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MADAME Cheron's avarice at length
yielded to her vanity. Some very splendid
entertainments, which Madame Clairval had
given, and the general adulation, which was
paid her, made the former more anxious
than before to secure an alliance, that would
so much exalt her in her own opinion and
in that of the world. She proposed terms
for the immediate marriage of her niece,
<PB N="376" REF="388"/>
and offered to give Emily a dower, provided
Madame Clairval observed equal terms, on
the part of her nephew. Madame Clairval
listened to the proposal, and, considering
that Emily was the apparent heiress of her
aunt's wealth, accepted it. Meanwhile,
Emily knew nothing of the transaction, till
Madame Cheron informed her, that she must
make preparation for the nuptials, which
would be celebrated without further delay,
then, astonished and wholly unable to ac∣count
for this sudden conclusion, which Va∣lancourt
had not solicited (for he was igno∣rant
of what had passed between the elder
ladies and had not dared to hope such good
fortune), she decisively objected to it. Ma∣dame
Cheron, however, quite as jealous of
contradiction now, as she had been formerly,
contended for a speedy marriage with as
much vehemence as she had formerly op∣posed
whatever had the most remote possi∣bility
of leading to it; and Emily's scruples
disappeared, when she again saw Valancourt,
who was now informed of the happiness, de∣signed
<PB N="377" REF="389"/>
signed for him, and came to claim a pro∣mise
of it from herself.</P>
<P>While preparations were making for these
nuptials, Montoni became the acknowledged
lover of Madame Cheron; and, though
Madame Clairval was much displeased,
when she heard of the approaching connec∣tion,
and was willing to prevent that of Va∣lancourt
with Emily, her conscience told
her, that she had no right thus to trifle with
their peace, and Madame Clairval, though a
woman of fashion, was far less advanced
than her friend in the art of deriving satis∣faction
from distinction and admiration, ra∣ther
than from conscience.</P>
<P>Emily observed with concern the ascen∣dancy,
which Montoni had acquired over
Madame Cheron, as well as the increasing
frequency of his visits; and her own opinion
of this Italian was confirmed by that of Va∣lancourt,
who had always expressed a dislike
of him. As she was, one morning, sitting
at work in the pavilion, enjoying the plea∣sant
freshness of spring, whose colours were
<PB N="378" REF="390"/>
now spread upon the landscape, and listen∣ing
to Valancourt, who was reading, but
who often laid aside the book to converse,
she received a summons to attend Madame
Cheron immediately, and had scarcely en∣tered
the dressing-room, when she observed
with surprise the dejection of her aunt's
countenance, and the contrasted gaiety of
her dress. "So, niece!"—said Madame,
and she stopped under some degree of embar∣rassment.—"I
sent for you,—I—I wished
to see you; I have news to tell you. From
this hour you must consider the signor
Montoni as your uncle—we were married
this morning."</P>
<P>Astonished—not so much at the marriage,
as at the secrecy with which it had been con∣cluded,
and the agitation with which it was
announced, Emily, at length, attributed
the privacy to the wish of Montoni, rather
than of her aunt. His wife, however, in∣tended,
that the contrary should be believed,
and therefore added, "You see I wished to
avoid a bustle; but now the ceremony is
<PB N="379" REF="391"/>
over I shall do so no longer; and I wish
to announce to my servants, that they must
receive the signor Montoni for their master."
Emily made a feeble attempt to congratu∣late
her on these apparently imprudent nup∣tials.
"I shall now celebrate my marriage
with some splendour," continued Madame
Montoni, "and to save time I shall avail
myself of the preparation that has been made
for yours, which will, of course, be delayed
a little while. Such of your wedding clothes
as are ready I shall expect you will appear
in, to do honour to this festival. I also
wish you to inform Monsieur Valancourt,
that I have changed my name, and he will
acquaint Madame Clairval. In a few days
I shall give a grand entertainment, at which
I shall request their presence."</P>
<P>Emily was so lost in surprise and various
thought, that she made Madame Montoni
scarcely any reply, but, at her desire, she
returned to inform Valancourt of what had
passed. Surprise was not his predominant
emotion on hearing of these hasty nuptials;
<PB N="380" REF="392"/>
and, when he learned, that they were to be
the means of delaying his own, and that the
very ornaments of the chateau, which had
been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his
Emily, were to be degraded to the celebra∣tion
of Madame Montoni's, grief and indig∣nation
agitated him alternately. He could
conceal neither from the observation of Emi∣ly,
whose efforts to abstract him from these
serious emotions, and to laugh at the appre∣hensive
considerations, that assailed him,
were ineffectual; and, when, at length, he
took leave, there was an earnest tenderness
in his manner, that extremely affected her;
she even shed tears, when he disappeared at
the end of the terrace, yet knew not exactly
why she should do so.</P>
<P>Montoni now took possession of the cha∣teau
and the command of its inhabitants,
with the ease of a man, who had long consi∣dered
it to be his own. His friend Cavigni,
who had been extremely serviceable, in hav∣ing
paid Madame Cheron the attention and
flattery, which she required, but from which
<PB N="381" REF="393"/>
Montoni too often revolted, had apartments
assigned to him, and received from the do∣mestics
an equal degree of obedience with
the master of the mansion.</P>
<P>Within a few days, Madame Montoni, as
she had promised, gave a magnificent enter∣tainment
to a very numerous company,
among whom was Valancourt; but at which
Madame Clairval excused herself from at∣tending.
There was a concert, ball and
supper. Valancourt was, of course, Emily's
partner, and though, when he gave a look
to the decorations of the apartments, he
could not but remember, that they were de∣signed
for other festivities, than those they
now contributed to celebrate, he endea∣voured
to check his concern by considering,
that a little while only would elapse before
they would be given to their original desti∣nation.
During this evening, Madame Mon∣toni
danced, laughed and talked incessantly;
while Montoni, silent, reserved and some∣what
haughty, seemed weary of the parade,
<PB N="382" REF="394"/>
and of the frivolous company it had drawn
together.</P>
<P>This was the first and the last entertain∣ment,
given in celebration of their nuptials.
Montoni, though the severity of his temper
and the gloominess of his pride prevented
him from enjoying such festivities, was ex∣tremely
willing to promote them. It was
seldom, that he could meet in any company
a man of more address, and still seldomer
one of more understanding, than himself;
the balance of advantage in such parties, or
in the connections, which might arise from
them, must, therefore, be on his side; and,
knowing, as he did, the selfish purposes, for
which they are generally frequented, he had
no objection to measure his talents of dissi∣mulation
with those of any other competitor
for distinction and plunder. But his wife,
who, when her own interest was immediately
concerned, had sometimes more discernment
than vanity, acquired a consciousness of her
inferiority to other women, in personal at∣tractions,
which, uniting with the jealousy
<PB N="383" REF="395"/>
natural to the discovery, counteracted his
readiness for mingling with all the parties
Tholouse could afford. Till she had, as
she supposed, the affections of an husband to
lose, she had no motive for discovering the
unwelcome truth, and it had never obtruded
itself upon her; but, now that it influenced
her policy, she opposed her husband's in∣clination
for company, with the more eager∣ness,
because she believed him to be really as
well received in the female society of the
place, as, during his addresses to her, he had
affected to be.</P>
<P>A few weeks only had elapsed, since the
marriage, when Madame Montoni informed
Emily, that the signor intended to return to
Italy, as soon as the necessary preparation
could be made for so long a journey. "We
shall go to Venice," said she, "where the
signor has a fine mansion, and from thence
to his estate in Tuscany. Why do you
look so grave, child?—You, who are so fond
of a romantic country and fine views, will
doubtless be delighted with this journey."</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="396"/>
"Am I then to be of the party, ma∣dam?"
said Emily, with extreme surprise
and emotion. "Most certainly," replied
her aunt, "how could you imagine we
should leave you behind? But I see you are
thinking of the Chevalier; he is not yet, I
believe, informed of the journey, but he very
soon will be so. Signor Montoni is gone to
acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey,
and to say, that the proposed connection be∣tween
the families must from this time be
thought of no more."</P>
<P>The unfeeling manner, in which Madame
Montoni thus informed her niece, that she
must be separated, perhaps for ever, from
the man, with whom she was on the point of
being united for life, added to the dismay,
which she must otherwise have suffered at
such intelligence. When she could speak
she asked the cause of the sudden change in
Madame's sentiments towards Valancourt,
but the only reply she could obtain was,
that the Signor had forbade the connection,
<PB N="385" REF="397"/>
considering it to be greatly inferior to what
Emily might reasonably expect.</P>
<P>"I now leave the affair entirely to the Sig∣nor,"
added Madame Montoni, "but I must
say, that M. Valancourt never was a favourite
with me, and I was overpersuaded, or I
should not have given my consent to the
connection. I was weak enough—I am so
foolish sometimes!—to suffer other people's
uneasiness to affect me, and so my better
judgment yielded to your affliction. But
the Signor has very properly pointed out
the folly of this, and he shall not have to
reprove me a second time. I am determined,
that you shall submit to those, who know
how to guide you better than yourself—I am
determined, that you shall be conformable."</P>
<P>Emily would have been astonished at the
assertions of this eloquent speech, had not
her mind been so overwhelmed by the sud∣den
shock it had received, that she scarcely
heard a word of what was latterly addressed
to her. Whatever were the weaknesses of
Madame Montoni, she might have avoided
<PB N="386" REF="398"/>
to accuse herself with those of compassion
and tenderness to the feelings of others, and
especially to those of Emily. It was the
same ambition, that lately prevailed upon
her to solicit an alliance with Madame
Clairval's family, which induced her to
withdraw from it, now that her marriage
with Montoni had exalted her self-con∣sequence,
and, with it, her views for her
niece.</P>
<P>Emily was, at this time, too much affec∣ted
to employ either remonstrance, or en∣treaty
on this topic; and when, at length,
she attempted the latter, her emotion over∣came
her speech, and she retired to her apart∣ment,
to think, if in the present state of her
mind to think was possible, upon this sud∣den
and overwhelming subject. It was very
long, before her spirits were sufficiently com∣posed
to permit the reflection, which, when
it came, was dark and even terrible. She
saw, that Montoni sought to aggrandise him∣self
in his disposal of her, and it occurred,
that his friend Cavigni was the person, for
<PB N="387" REF="399"/>
whom he was interested. The prospect of
going to Italy was still rendered darker,
when she considered the tumultuous situa∣tion
of that country, then torn by civil com∣motion,
where every petty state was at war
with its neighbour, and even every castle
liable to the attack of an invader. She consi∣dered
the person, to whose immediate guid∣ance
she would be committed, and the vast
distance, that was to separate her from Valan∣court,
and, at the recollection of him, every
other image vanished from her mind, and
every thought was again obscured by grief.</P>
<P>In this perturbed state she passed some
hours, and, when she was summoned to din∣ner,
she entreated permission to remain
in her own apartment; but Madame Mon∣toni
was alone, and the request was refused.
Emily and her aunt said little during the
repast; the one occupied by her griefs, the
otherengrossed by the disappointment, which
the unexpected absence of Montoni occa∣sioned;
for not only was her vanity piqued
by the neglect, but her jealousy alarmed by
<PB N="388" REF="400"/>
what she considered as a mysterious engage∣ment.
When the cloth was drawn and they
were alone, Emily renewed the mention of
Valancourt; but her aunt, neither softened
to pity, or awakened to remorse, became
enraged, that her will should be opposed,
and the authority of Montoni questioned,
though this was done by Emily with her
usual gentleness, who, after a long, and tor∣turing
conversation, retired in tears.</P>
<P>As she crossed the hall, a person entered
it by the great door, whom, as her eyes
hastily glanced that way, she imagined to be
Montoni, and she was passing on with quicker
steps, when she heard the well-known voice
of Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Emily, O! my Emily!" cried he in a tone
faltering with impatience, while she turned,
and, as he advanced, was alarmed at the
expression of his countenance and the eager
desperation of his air. "In tears, Emily!
I would speak with you," said he, "I
have much to say; conduct me where we
<PB N="389" REF="401"/>
may converse. But you tremble—you are
ill! Let me lead you to a seat."</P>
<P>He observed the open door of an apart∣ment,
and hastily took her hand to lead
her thither; but she attempted to withdraw
it, and said, with a languid smile, "I am
better already; if you wish to see my aunt
she is in the dining-parlour." "I must
speak with <HI>you,</HI> my Emily," replied Valan∣court,
"Good God! is it already come to
this? Are you indeed so willing to resign
me? But this is an improper place—I am
overheard. Let me entreat your attention,
if only for a few minutes." "When you
have seen my aunt," said Emily. "I was
wretched enough when I came hither," ex∣claimed
Valancourt, "do not increase my
misery by this coldness—this cruel refu∣sal."</P>
<P>The despondency, with which he spoke
this, affected her almost to tears, but she
persisted in refusing to hear him, till he had
conversed with Madame Montoni. "Where
is her husband, where, then, is Montoni?"
<PB N="390" REF="402"/>
said Valancourt, in an altered tone, "it is
he, to whom I must speak."</P>
<P>Emily, terrified for the consequence of
the indignation, that flashed in his eyes,
tremblingly assured him, that Montoni was
at home, and entreated he would endeavour
to moderate his resentment. At the tremu∣lous
accents of her voice, his eyes softened
instantly from wildness into tenderness.
"You are ill, Emily," said he, "they will
destroy us both! Forgive me, that I dared
to doubt your affection."</P>
<P>Emily no longer opposed him, as he led
her into an adjoining parlour; the manner,
in which he had named Montoni, had so
much alarmed, her for his own safety, that
she was now only anxious to "prevent the con∣sequences
of his just resentment. He listened
to her entreaties, with attention, but replied
to them only with looks of despondency and
tenderness, concealing, as much as possible,
the sentiments he felt toward Morrtoni, that
he might sooth the apprehensions, which dis∣tressed
her. But she saw the veil he had
<PB N="391" REF="403"/>
spread over his resentment, and, his assumed
tranquillity only alarming her more, she
urged, at length, the impolicy of forcing
an interview with Montoni, and of taking
any measure, which might render their sepa∣ration
irremediable. Valancourt yielded
to these remonstrances, and her affecting
entreaties drew from him a promise, that,
however Montoni might persist in his design
of disuniting them, he would not seek to
redress his wrongs by violence. "For my
sake," said Emily, "let the consideration
of what I should suffer deter you from such
a mode of revenge!" "For your sake,
Emily," replied Valancourt, his eyes filling
with tears of tenderness and grief, while he
gazed upon her. "Yes—yes—I shall sub∣due
myself. But, though I have given you
my solemn promise to do this, do not expect,
that I can tamely submit to the authority or
Montoni; if I could, I should be unworthy
of you. Yet, O Emily! how long may
he condemn me to live without you,—
<PB N="392" REF="404"/>
how long may it be before you return to
France!"</P>
<P>Emily endeavoured to sooth him with
assurances of her unalterable affection, and by
representing, that, in little more than a year,
she should be her own mistress, as far as re∣lated
to her aunt, from whose guardianship
her age would then release her; assurances,
which gave little consolation to Valancourt,
who considered, that she would then be in
Italy and in the power of those, whose
dominion over her would not cease with
their rights; but he affected to be consoled
by them. Emily, comforted by the promise
she had obtained, and by his apparent com∣posure,
was about to leave him, when her
aunt entered the room. She threw a glance
of sharp reproof upon her niece; who im∣mediately
withdrew, and of haughty dis∣pleasure
upon Valancourt.</P>
<P>"This is not the conduct I should have
expected from you, sir;" said she, "I did
not expect to see you in my house, after
you had been informed, that your visits
<PB N="393" REF="405"/>
were no longer agreeable, much less, that
you would seek a clandestine interview with
my niece, and that she would grant one."</P>
<P>Valancourt, perceiving it necessary to vin∣dicate
Emily from such a design, explained,
that the purpose of his own visit had been
to request an interview with Montoni, and
he then entered upon the subject of it, with
the tempered spirit which the sex, rather
than the respectability, of Madame Mon∣toni,
demanded.</P>
<P>His expostulations were answered with
severe rebuke she lamented again, that her
prudence had ever yielded to what she termed
compassion, and added, that she was so sen∣sible
of the folly of her former consent, that,
to prevent the possibility of a repetition, she
had committed the affair entirely to the con∣duct
of Signor Montoni.</P>
<P>The feeling eloquence of Valancourt, how∣ever,
at length, made her sensible in some mea∣sure
of her unworthy conduct, and she became
susceptible to shame, but not to remorse: she
hated Valancourt, who awakened her to this
painful sensation, and, in proportion as she
<PB N="394" REF="406"/>
grew dissatisfied with herself, her abhorrence
of him increased. This was also the more
inveterate, because his tempered words and
manner were such as, without accusing her,
compelled her to accuse herself, and neither
left her a hope, that the odious portrait was
the caricature of his prejudice, or afforded
her an excuse for expressing the violent re∣sentment,
with which she contemplated it.
At length, her anger rose to such an height,
that Valancourt was compelled to leave the
house abruptly, lest he should forfeit his
own esteem by an intemperate reply. He
was then convinced, that from Madame
Montoni he had nothing to hope, for what of
either pity, or justice could be expected from
a person, who could feel the pain of guilt,
without the humility of repentance?</P>
<P>To Montoni he looked with equal de∣spondency,
since it was nearly evident, that
this plan of separation originated with him,
and it was not probable, that he would re∣linquish
his own views to entreaties, or re∣monstrances,
which he must have foreseen
<PB N="395" REF="407"/>
and have been prepared to resist. Yet,
remembering his promise to Emily, and
more solicitous, concerning his love, than
jealous of his consequence, Valancourt was
careful to do nothing that might unneces∣sarily
irritate Montoni; he wrote to him,
therefore, not to demand an interview, but
to solicit one, and, having done this, he
endeavoured to await with calmness his re∣ply.</P>
<P>Madame Clairval was passive in the af∣fair.
When she gave her approbation to
Valancourt's marriage, it was in the belief,
that Emily would be the heiress of Madame
Montoni's fortune, and, though, upon the
nuptials of the latter, when she perceived the
fallacy of this expectation, her conscience
had withheld her from adopting any mea∣sure
to prevent the union, her benevolence
was not sufficiently active to impel her to∣wards
any step, that might now promote it.
She was, on the contrary, secretly pleased,
that Valancourt was released from an en∣gagement,
which she considered to be as in∣ferior,
<PB N="396" REF="408"/>
in point of fortune, to his merit, as
his alliance was thought by Montoni to be
humiliating to the beauty of Emily; and,
though her pride was wounded by this re∣jection
of a member of her family, she dis∣dained
to shew resentment otherwise, than
by silence.</P>
<P>Montoni, in his reply to Valancourt,
said, that as an interview could neither re∣move
the objections of the one, or overcome
the wishes of the other, it would serve only
to produce useless altercation between them.
He, therefore, thought proper to refuse it.</P>
<P>In consideration of the policy, suggested
by Emily, and of his promise to her, Valan∣court
restrained the impulse, that urged
him to the house of Montoni, to demand
what had been denied to his entreaties.
He only repeated his solicitations to see
him; seconding them with all the argu∣ments
his situation could suggest. Thus
several days passed, in remonstrance, on one
side, and inflexible denial, on the other;
for, whether it was fear, or shame, or the
<PB N="397" REF="409"/>
hatred, which results from both, that made
Montoni shun the man he had injured, he
was peremptory in his refusal, and was
neither softened to pity by the agony, which
Valancourt's letters pourtrayed, or awakened
to a repentance of his own injustice by the
strong remonstrances he employed. At length,
Valancourt's letters were returned unopened,
and then, in the first moments of passionate
despair, he forgot every promise to Emily,
except the solemn one, which bound him to
avoid violence, and hastened to Montoni's
chateau, determined to see him by whatever
other means might be necessary. Montoni
was denied, and Valancourt, when he after∣wards
enquired for Madame, and Ma'am∣selle
St. Aubert, was absolutely refused ad∣mittance
by the servants. Not choosing to
submit himself to a contest with these, he,
at length, departed, and, returning home in
a state of mind approaching to frenzy,
wrote to Emily of what had passed, expres∣sed
without restraint all the agony of his
heart, and entreated, that, since he must not
<PB N="398" REF="410"/>
otherwise hope to see her immediately, she
would allow him an interview unknown to
Montoni. Soon after he had dispatched this,
his passions becoming more temperate, he
was sensible of the error he had committed
in having given Emily new subject of distress
in the strong mention of his own suffering,
and would have given half the world, had
it been his, to recover the letter. Emily,
however, was spared the pain she must have
received from it by the suspicious policy of
Madame Montoni, who had ordered, that
all letters, addressed to her niece, should be
delivered to herself, and who, after having
perused this and indulged the expressions of
resentment, which Valancourt's mention of
Montoni provoked, had consigned it to the
flames.</P>
<P>Montoni, meanwhile, every day more
impatient to leave France, gave repeated
orders for dispatch to the servants employed
in preparations for the journey, and to the
persons, with whom he was transacting some
particular business. He preserved a steady
<PB N="399" REF="411"/>
silence to the letters in which Valancourt,
despairing of greater good, and having sub∣dued
the passion, that had transgressed
against his policy, solicited only the indul∣gence
of being allowed to bid Emily fare∣well.
But, when the latter learned, that she
was really to set out in a very few days,
and that it was designed he should see her
no more, forgetting every consideration of
prudence, he dared, in a second letter to
Emily, to propose a clandestine marriage.
This also was transmitted to Madame Mon∣toni,
and the last day of Emily's stay at
Tholouse arrived, without affording Valan∣court
even a line to sooth his sufferings, or
a hope, that he should be allowed a parting
interview.</P>
<P>During this period of torturing suspense
to Valancourt, Emily was sunk into that
kind of stupor, with which sudden and
irremediable misfortune sometimes over∣whelms
the mind. Loving him with the
tenderest affection, and having long been
accustomed to consider him as the friend
<PB N="400" REF="412"/>
and companion of all her future days, she
had no ideas of happiness, that were not con∣nected
with him. What, then, must have
been her suffering, when thus suddenly they
were to be separated, perhaps, for ever, cer∣tainly
to be thrown into distant parts of the
world, where they could scarcely hear of
each other's existence; and all this in obe∣dience
to the will of a stranger, for such
was Montoni, and of a person, who had
but lately been anxious to hasten their nup∣tials!
It was in vain, that she endeavoured
to subdue her grief, and resign herself to
an event, which she could not avoid. The
silence of Valancourt afflicted more than
it surprised her, since she attributed it to its
just occasion; but, when the day, preceding
that, on which she was to quit Tholouse,
arrived, and she heard no mention of his
being permitted to take leave of her, grief
overcame every consideration, that had made
her reluctant to speak of him, and she en∣quired
of Madame Montoni, whether this
consolation had been refused. Her aunt
<PB N="401" REF="413"/>
informed her that it had, adding, that, after
the provocation she had herself received from
Valancourt, in their last interview, and the
persecution, which the Signor had suffered
from his letters, no entreaties should avail
to procure it.</P>
<P>"If the Chevalier expected this favour
from us," said she, "he should have con∣ducted
himself in a very different manner;
he should have waited patiently, till he knew
whether we were disposed to grant it, and
not have come and reproved me, because
I did not think proper to bestow my niece
upon him,—and then have persisted in
troubling the Signor, because he did not
think proper to enter into any dispute
about so childish an affair. His behaviour
throughout has been extremely presump∣tuous
and impertinent, and I desire, that I
may never hear his name repeated, and
that you will get the better of those foolish
sorrows and whims, and look like other peo∣ple,
and not appear with that dismal coun∣tenance,
as if you were ready to cry. For,
<PB N="402" REF="414"/>
though you say nothing, you cannot conceal
your grief from my penetration. I can see
you are ready to cry at this moment, though
I am reproving you for it; aye, even now,
in spite of my commands."</P>
<P>Emily, having turned away to hide her
tears, quitted the room to indulge them,
and the day was passed in an intensity of an∣guish,
such as she had, perhaps, never
known before. When she withdrew to
her chamber for the night, she remained in
the chair where she had placed herself, on
entering the room, absorbed in her grief,
till long after every member of the family,
except herself, was retired to rest. She
could not divest herself of a belief, that she
had parted with Valancourt to meet no
more; a belief, which did not arise merely
from foreseen circumstances, for, though
the length of the journey she was about to
commence, the uncertainty as to the period
of her return, together with the prohibitions
she had received, seemed to justify it, she
yielded also to an impression, which she mis∣took
<PB N="403" REF="415"/>
for a pre-sentiment, that she was going
from Valancourt for ever. How dreadful
to her imagination, too, was the distance
that would separate them—the Alps, those
tremendous barriers! would rise, and whole
countries extend between the regions where
each must exist! To live in adjoining pro∣vinces,
to live even in the same country,
though without seeing him, was compara∣tive
happiness to the conviction of this
dreadful length of distance.</P>
<P>Her mind was, at length, so much agi∣tated
by the consideration of her state, and
the belief, that she had seen Valancourt for
the last time, that she suddenly became very
faint, and, looking round the chamber for
something, that might revive her, she ob∣served
the casements, and had just strength
to throw one open, near which she seated
herself. The air recalled her spirits, and
the still moon-light, that fell upon the elms
of a long avenue, fronting the window,
somewhat soothed them, and determined
her to try whether exercise and the open air
<PB N="404" REF="416"/>
would not relieve the intense pain that
bound her temples. In the chateau all was
still; and, passing down the great stair-case
into the hall, from whence a passage led im∣mediately
to the garden, she sostly and un∣heard,
as she thought, unlocked the door,
and entered the avenue. Emily passed on
with steps now hurried, and now faltering,
as, deceived by the shadows among the trees,
she fancied she saw some person move in
the distant perspective, and feared, that it
was a spy of Madame Montoni. Her desire,
however, to re-visit the pavilion, where she
had passed so many happy hours with Valan∣court,
and had admired with him the exten∣sive
prospect over Languedoc and her na∣tive
Gascony, overcame her apprehension
of being observed, and she moved on to∣wards
the terrace, which, running along
the upper garden, commanded the whole of
the lower one, and communicated with it
by a flight of marble steps, that terminated
the avenue.</P>
<P>Having reached these steps, she paused a
<PB N="405" REF="417"/>
moment to look round, for her distance
from the chateau now increased the fear,
which the stillness and obscurity of the
hour had awakened. But, perceiving no∣thing
that could justify it, she ascended to
the terrace, where the moon-light shewed
the long broad walk, with the pavilion at
its extremity, while the rays silvered the fo∣liage
of the high trees and shrubs, that bor∣dered
it on the right, and the tufted sum∣mits
of those, that rose to a level with the
balustrade on the left, from the garden
below. Her distance from the chateau
again alarming her, she paused to listen; the
night was so calm, that no sound could
have escaped her, but she heard only the
plaintive sweetness of the nightingale, with
the light shiver of the leaves, and she pur∣sued
her way towards the pavilion, having
reached which, its obscurity did not prevent
the emotion, that a fuller view of its well∣known
scene would have excited. The
lattices were thrown back, and shewed be∣yond
their embowered arch the moon-light
<PB N="406" REF="418"/>
landscape, shadowy and soft; its groves,
and plains extending gradually and indis∣tinctly
to the eye, its distant mountains
catching a stronger gleam, and the nearer
river reflecting the moon, and trembling to
her rays.</P>
<P>Emily, as she approached the lattice,
was sensible of the features of this scene
only as they served to bring Valancourt
more immediately to her fancy. "Ah!"
said she, with a heavy sigh, as she threw her∣self
into a chair by the window, "how of∣ten
have we sat together in this spot—often
have looked upon that landscape! Never,
never more shall we view it together—never—never
more, perhaps, shall we look upon
each other!"</P>
<P>Her tears were suddenly stopped by ter∣ror—a
voice spoke near her in the pavilion;
she shrieked—it spoke again, and she distin∣guished
the well known tones of Valan∣court.
It was indeed Valancourt who sup∣ported
her in his arms! For some moments
their emotion would not suffer either to
<PB N="407" REF="419"/>
speak. "Emily!" said Valancourt at
length, as he pressed her hand in his,
"Emily!" and he was again silent, but the
accent, in which he had pronounced her
name, expressed all his tenderness and sor∣row.</P>
<P>"O my Emily!" he resumed, after a
long pause, "I do then see you once again,
and hear again the sound of that voice! I
have haunted this place—these gardens, for
many—many nights, with a faint, very
faint hope of seeing you. This was the
only chance that remained for me, and,
thank heaven! it has at length succeeded—I
am not condemned to absolute despair!"</P>
<P>Emily said something, she scarcely knew
what, expressive of her unalterable affec∣tion,
and endeavoured to-calm the agitation
of his mind; but Valancourt could for
some time only utter incoherent expressions
of his emotions; and, when he was some∣what
more composed, he said, "I came hi∣ther,
soon after sun-set, and have been
watching in the gardens, and in this pavi∣lion
<PB N="408" REF="420"/>
ever since; for, though I had now gi∣ven
up all hope of seeing you, I could not
resolve to tear myself from a place so near to
you, and should probably have lingered
about the chateau till morning dawned.
O how heavily the moments have passed,
yet with what various emotion have they
been marked, as I sometimes thought I
heard footsteps, and fancied you were ap∣proaching,
and then again—perceived only
a dead and dreary silence! But, when you
opened the door of the pavilion, and the
darkness prevented my distinguishing with
certainty, whether it was ray love—my
heart beat so strongly with hopes and fears,
that I could not speak. The instant I
heard the plaintive accents of your voice,
my doubts vanished, but not my fears, till
you spoke of me; then, losing the appre∣hension
of alarming you in the exces of
my emotion, I could no longer be silent.
O Emily! these are moments, in which
joy and grief struggle so powerfully for
<PB N="409" REF="421"/>
pre-eminence, that the heart can scarcely
support the contest!"</P>
<P>Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of
this assertion, but the joy she felt on thus
meeting Valancourt, at the very moment
when she was lamenting, that they must
probably meet no more, soon melted into
grief, as reflection stole over her thoughts,
and imagination prompted visions of the
future. She struggled to recover the calm
dignity of mind, which was necessary to
support her through this last interview, and
which Valancourt found it utterly impossible
to attain, for the transports of his joy
changed abruptly into those of suffering,
and he expressed in the most impassioned
language his horror of this separation, and
his despair of their ever meeting again.
Emily wept silently as she listened to him,
and then, trying to command her own dis∣tress,
and to sooth his, she suggested every
circumstance that could lead to hope. But
the energy of his fears led him instantly to
detect the friendly fallacies, which she endea∣voured
<PB N="410" REF="422"/>
to impose on herself and him, and
also to conjure up illusions too powerful
for his reason.</P>
<P>"You are going from me," said he, "to
a distant country, O how distant!—to new
society, new friends, new admirers, with
people too, who will try to make you forget
me, and to promote new connections! How
can I know this, and not know, that you
will never return for me—never can be
mine." His voice was stifled by sighs.</P>
<P>"You believe, then," said Emily, "that
the pangs I suffer proceed from a trivial
and temporary interest; you believe—"</P>
<P>"Suffer!" interrupted Valancourt, "suf∣fer
for me! O Emily—how sweet—how
bitter are those words; what comfort, what
anguish do they give! I ought not to doubt
the steadiness of your affection, yet such is
the inconsistency of real love, that it is always
awake to suspicion, however unreasonable;
always requiring new assurances from the ob∣ject
of its interest, and thus it is, that I always
feel revived, as by a new conviction, when
<PB N="411" REF="423"/>
your words tell me I am dear to you; and,
wanting these, I relapse into doubt, and too
often into despondency. "Then seeming to
recollect him∣self, he exclaimed, "But what
a wretch am I, thus to torture you, and in
these moments, too! I, who ought to sup∣port
and comfort you!"</P>
<P>This reflection overcame Valancourt with
tenderness, but, relapsing into despondency,
he again felt only for himself, and lamented
again this cruel separation, in a voice and
words so impassioned, that Emily, could no
longer struggle to repress her own grief, or
to sooth his. Valancourt, between these
emotions of love and pity, lost the power,
and almost the wish, of repressing his agi∣tation;
and, in the intervals of convulsive
sobs, he, at one moment, kissed away her
tears, then told her cruelly, that possibly she
might never again weep for him, and then
tried to speak more calmly, but only ex∣claimed,
"O Emily—my heart will break!—I
cannot—cannot leave you! Now—I
gaze upon that countenance, now I hold
<PB N="412" REF="424"/>
you in my arms! a little while, and all this
will appear a dream. I shall look, and can∣not
see you; shall try to recollect your fea∣tures—and
the impression will be fled from
my imagination;—to hear the tones of your
voice, and even memory will be silent!—I
cannot, cannot leave you! Why should
we confide the happiness of our whole lives
to the will of people, who have no right
to interrupt, and, except in giving you to
me, have no power to promote it? O
Emily! venture to trust your own heart,
venture to be mine forever!" His voice
trembled, and he was silent; Emily conti∣nued
to weep, and was silent also, when
Valancourt proceeded to propose an imme∣diate
marriage, and that, at an early hour
on the following morning, she should quit
Madame Montoni's house, and be con∣ducted
by him to the church of the Au∣gustines,
where a friar should await to
unite them.</P>
<P>The silence, with which she listened to a
proposal, dictated by love and despair, and
<PB N="413" REF="425"/>
enforced at a moment, when it seemed
scarcely possible for her to oppose it;—when
her heart was softened by the sorrows
of a separation, that might be eternal, and
her reason obscured by the illusions of love
and terror, encouraged him to hope, that
it would not be rejected. "Speak, my
Emily!" said Valancourt eagerly, "let me
hear your voice, let me hear you confirm
my fate." She spoke not; her cheek was
cold, and her senses seemed to fail her, but
she did not faint. To Valancourt's terri∣fied
imagination she appeared to be dying;
he called upon her name, rose to go to the
chateau for assistance, and then, recollect∣ing
her situation, feared to go, or to leave
her for a moment.</P>
<P>After a few minutes, she drew a deep
sigh, and began to revive. The conflict
she had suffered, between love and the duty
she at present owed to her father's sister;
her repugnance to a clandestine marriage, her
fear of emerging on the world with embar∣rassments,
such as might ultimately involve
<PB N="414" REF="426"/>
the object of her affection in misery and re∣pentance;—all
this various interest was too
powerful for a mind, already enervated by
sorrow, and her reason had suffered a tran∣sient
suspension. But duty, and good sense,
however hard the conflict, at length, tri∣umphed
over affection and mournful pre∣sentiment;
above all, she dreaded to in∣volve
Valancourt in obscurity and vain
regret, which she saw, or thought she saw,
must be the too certain consequence of a
marriage in their present circumstances; and
she acted, perhaps, with somewhat more than
female fortitude, when she resolved to endure
a present, rather than provoke a distant
misfortune.</P>
<P>With a candour, that proved how truly
she esteemed and loved him, and which en∣deared
her to him, if possible, more than
ever, she told Valancourt all her reasons for
rejecting his proposals. Those, which in∣fluenced
her concerning his future welfare,
he instantly resuted, or rather contradicted;
but they awakened tender considerations
for her, which the frenzy of passion and
<PB N="415" REF="427"/>
despair had concealed before, and love,
which had but lately prompted him to pro∣pose
a clandestine and immediate marriage,
now induced him to renounce it. The
triumph was almost too much for his heart;
for Emily's sake, he endeavoured to stifle
his grief, but the swelling anguish would
not be restrained. "O Emily!" said he,
"I must leave you—I <HI>must,</HI> leave you, and
I know it is for ever."</P>
<P>Convulsive sobs again interrupted his
words, and they wept together in silence,
till Emily, recollecting the danger of being
discovered, and the impropriety of pro∣longing
an interview, which might subject
her to censure, summoned all her fortitude
to utter a last farewell.</P>
<P>"Stay!" said Valancourt, "I conjure you
stay, for I have much to tell you. The
agitation of my mind has hitherto suffered
me to speak only on the subject that occu∣pied
it;—I have forborne to mention a doubt
of much importance, partly, lest it should
appear as if I told it with an ungenerous
<PB N="416" REF="428"/>
view of alarming you into a compliance
with my late proposal."</P>
<P>Emily, much agitated, did not leave Va∣lancourt,
but she led him from the pavi∣lion,
and, as they walked upon the terrace,
he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>"This Montoni: I have heard some
strange hints concerning him. Are you
certain he is of Madame Quesnel's family,
and that his fortune is what it appears to
be?"</P>
<P>"I have no reason to doubt either," re∣plied
Emily, in a voice of alarm. "Of the
first, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have no
certain means of judging of the latter, and
I entreat you will tell me all you have
heard."</P>
<P>"That I certainly will, but it is very im∣perfect,
and unsatisfacotory information. I
gathered it by accident from an Italian,
who was speaking to another person of this
Montoni. They were talking of his mar∣riage;
the Italian said, that if he was the
person he meant, he was not likely to make
<PB N="417" REF="429"/>
Madame Cheron happy. He proceeded to
speak of him in general terms of dislike,
and then gave some particular hints, con∣cerning
his character, that excited my curi∣osity,
and I ventured to ask him a few ques∣tions.
He was reserved in his replies,
but, after hesitating for some time, he
owned, that he had understood abroad, that
Montoni was a man of desperate fortune
and character. He said something of a
castle of Montoni's, situated among the
Apennines, and of some strange circum∣stances,
that might be mentioned, as to his
former mode of life. I pressed him to in∣form
me further, but I believe the strong
interest I felt was visible in my manner,
and alarmed him; for no entreaties could
prevail with him to give any explanation of
the circumstances he had alluded to, or to
mention any thing further concerning Mon∣toni.
I observed to him, that, if Montoni
was possessed of a castle in the Apennines,
it appeared from such a circumstance, that
he was of some family, and also seemed to
<PB N="418" REF="430"/>
contradict the report, that he was a man of
entirely broken fortunes. He shook his
head, and looked as if he could have said a
great deal, but made no reply.</P>
<P>"A hope of learning something more sa∣tisfactory,
or more positive, detained me in
his company a considerable time, and I re∣newed
the subject repeatedly, but the Italian
wrapped himself up in reserve, said—that
what he had mentioned he had caught only
from a floating report, and that reports fre∣quently
arose from personal malice, and
were very little to be depended upon. I
forbore to press the subject farther, since it
was obvious that he was alarmed for the
consequence of what he had already said,
and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty
on a point where suspense is almost intole∣rable.
Think, Emily, what I must suffer
to see you depart for a foreign country,
committed to the power of a man of such
doubtful character as is this Montoni! But
I will not alarm you unnecessarily;—it is
possible, as the Italian said, at first, that
<PB N="419" REF="431"/>
this is not the Montoni he alluded to. Yet,
Emily, consider well before you resolve to
commit yourself to him. O! I must not
trust myself to speak—or I shall renounce
all the motives, which so lately influenced
me to resign the hope of your becoming
mine immediately."</P>
<P>Valancourt walked upon the terrace with
hurried steps, while Emily remained lean∣ing
on the balustrade in deep thought.
The information she had just received ex∣cited,
perhaps, more alarm than it could
justify, and raised once more the conflict of
contrasted interests. She had never liked
Montoni. The fire and keenness of his
eye, its proud exultation, its bold fierce∣ness,
its sullen watchfulness, as occasion,
and even slight occasion, had called forth the
latent soul, she had often observed with emo∣tion;
while from the usual expression of his
countenance she had always shrunk. From
such observations she was the more inclined
to believe, that it was this Montoni, of
whom the Italian had uttered his suspicious
<PB N="420" REF="432"/>
hints. The thought of being solely in his
power, in a foreign land, was terrifying to
her, but it was not by terror alone that she
was urged to an immediate marriage with
Valancourt. The tenderest love had already
pleaded his cause, but had been unable to
overcome her opinion, as to her duty, her
disinterested considerations for Valancourt,
and the delicacy, which made her revolt from
a clandestine union. It was not to be ex∣pected,
that a vague terror would be more
powerful, than the united influence of love
and grief. But it recalled all their energy,
and rendered a second conquest necessary.</P>
<P>With Valancourt, whose imagination was
now awake to the suggestion of every passion;
whose apprehensions for Emily had acquired
strength by the mere mention of them, and be∣came
every instant more powerful, as his mind
brooded over them—with Valancourt no se∣cond
conquest was attainable. He thought
he saw in the clearest light, and love as∣sisted
the fear, that this journey to Italy
would involve Emily in misery; he deter∣minded,
<PB N="421" REF="433"/>
therefore, to persevere in opposing
it, and in conjuring her to bestow upon
him the title of her lawful protector.</P>
<P>"Emily!" said he, with solemn earnest∣ness,
"this is no time for serupulous dis∣tinctions,
for weighing the dubious and
comparatively trifling circumstances, that
may affect our future comfort. I now see.,
much more clearly than before, the train of
serious dangers you are going to encounter
with a man of Montoni's character. Those
dark hints of the Italian spoke much, but
not more than the idea I have of Montoni's
disposition, as exhibited even in his counte∣nance.
I think I see at this moment all that
could have been hinted, written there. He is
the Italian, whom I fear, and I conjure you
for your own sake, as well as for mine, to
prevent the evils I shudder to foresee. O
Emily! let my tenderness, my arms with∣hold
you from them—give me the right to
defend you!"</P>
<P>Emily only sighed, while Valancourt pro∣ceeded
to remonstrate and to entreat with
<PB N="422" REF="434"/>
all the energy that love and apprehension
could inspire. But, as his imagination
magnified to her the possible evils she was
going to meet, the mists of her own fancy
began to dissipate, and allowed her to distin∣guish
the exaggerated images, which im∣posed
on his reason. She considered, that
there was no proof of Montoni being the
person, whom the stranger had meant;
that, even if he was so, the Italian had no∣ticed
his character and broken fortunes
merely from report; and that, though the
countenance of Montoni seemed to give pro∣bability
to a part of the rumour, it was.
not by such circumstances that an implicit
belief of it could be justified. These con∣siderations
would probably not have arisen
so distinctly to her mind, at this time, had
not the terrors of Valancourt presented to
her such obvious exaggerations of her dan∣ger,
as incited her to distrust the fallacies of
passion. But, while she endeavoured in
the gentlest manner to convince him of his
error, she plunged him into a new one.
<PB N="423" REF="435"/>
His voice and countenance changed to an
expression of dark despair. "Emily!"
said he, "this, this moment is the bitterest
that is yet come to me. You do not—cannot
love me!—It would be impossible for you to
reason thus coolly, thus deliberately, if you
did. I, <HI>I</HI> am torn with anguish at the pro∣spect
of our separation, and of the evils that
may await you in consequence of it; I would
encounter any hazards to prevent it—to
save you. No! Emily, no!—you cannot
love me."</P>
<P>"We have now little time to waste in ex∣clamation,
or assertion," said Emily, endea∣vouring
to conceal her emotion: "if you
are yet to learn how dear you are, and ever
must be, to my heart, no assurances of mine
can give you conviction."</P>
<P>The last words faltered on her lips, and
her tears flowed fast. Those words and
tears brought, once more, and with instan∣taneous
force, conviction of her love to Va∣lancourt.
He could only exclaim, "Emi∣ly!
Emily!" and weep over the hand he
<PB N="424" REF="436"/>
pressed to his lips; but she, after some mo∣ments,
again roused herself from the indul∣gence
of sorrow, and said, "I must leave
you; it is late, and my absence from the
chateau may be discovered. Think of me—love
me—when I am far away; the be∣lief
of this will be my comfort!"</P>
<P>"Think of you!—love you!" exclaimed
Valancourt.</P>
<P>"Try to moderate these transports," said
Emily, "for my sake, try."</P>
<P>"For your sake!"</P>
<P>"Yes, for my sake," replied Emily, in a
tremulous voice, "I cannot leave you
thus!"</P>
<P>"Then do not leave me!" said Valancourt,
with quickness. "Why should we part,
or part for longer than till to-morrow?"</P>
<P>"I am, indeed I am, unequal to these
moments," replied Emily, "you tear my
heart, but I never can consent to this hasty,
imprudent proposal!"</P>
<P>"If we could command our time, my
<PB N="425" REF="437"/>
Emily, it should not be thus hasty; we
must submit to circumstances."</P>
<P>"We must, indeed! I have already told
you all my heart—my spirits are gone.
You allowed the force of my objections, till
your tenderness called up vague terrors,
which have given us both unnecessary an∣guish.
Spare me! do not oblige me to re∣peat
the reasons I have already urged."</P>
<P>"Spare you!" cried Valancourt, "I am
a wretch—a very wretch, that have felt
only for myself!—I! who ought to have
shewn the fortitude of man, who ought
to have supported you, l! have increased
your sufferings by the conduct of a child!
Forgive me, Emily! think of the distrac∣tion
of my mind now that I am about to
part with, all that is dear to me—and forgive
me! When you are gone, I shall recollect!
with bitter remorse what I have made you
suffer, and shall wish in vain that I could
see you, if only for a moment, that I might
sooth your grief."</P>
<P>Tears again interrupted his voice, and
Emily wept with him. "I will shew my
<PB N="426" REF="438"/>
self more worthy of your love," said Va∣lancourt,
at length; "I will not prolong
these moments. My Emily—my own
Emily! never forget me! God knows
when we shall meet again! I resign you to
his care—. O God!—O God!—protect
and bless her!"</P>
<P>He pressed her hand to his heart. Emily
sunk almost lifeless on his bosom; and nei∣ther
wept, nor spoke. Valancourt, now
commanding his own distress, tried to com∣fort
and re-assure her, but she appeared to∣tally
unaffected by what he said, and a sigh,
which she uttered, now and then, was all
that proved she had not fainted.</P>
<P>He supported her slowly towards the cha∣teau,
weeping and speaking to her; but she
answered only in sighs, till, having reached
the gate, that terminated the avenue, she
seemed to have recovered her consciousness,
and, looking round, perceived how near
they were to the chateau. "We must part
here," said she, stopping, "Why prolong
these moments? Teach me the fortitude
I have forgot."</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="439"/>
Valancourt struggled to assume a com∣posed
air. "Farewell, my love!" said he,
in a voice of solemn tenderness—"trust me
we shall meet again—meet for each other—meet
to part no more!" His voice fal∣tered,
but, recovering it, he proceeded in a
firmer tone. "You know not what I
shall suffer, till I hear from you; I shall
omit no opportunity of conveying to you
my letters, yet I tremble to think how few
may occur. And trust me, love, for your
dear sake, I will try to bear this absence
with fortitude. O how little I have shewn
to-night!"</P>
<P>"Farewell!" said Emily faintly. "When
you are gone, I shall think of many things I
would have said to you." "And I of many—many!"
said Valancourt; "I never left
you yet, that I did not immediately remem∣ber
some question, or some entreaty, or some
circumstance, concerning my love, that I ear∣nestly
wished to mention, and feel wretched
because I could not. O Emily! this counte∣nance,
on which I now gaze—will, in a
moment, be gone from my eyes, and not
<PB N="428" REF="440"/>
all the efforts of fancy will be able to recall
it with exactness. O! what an infinite
difference between this moment and, the
next! <HI>Now,</HI> I am in your presence, can be∣hold
you! <HI>then,</HI> all will be a dreary blank—and
I shall be a wanderer, exiled from my
only home!"</P>
<P>Valancourt again pressed her to his heart,
and held her there in silence, weeping.
Tears once again calmed her oppressed mind.
They again bade each other farewell, lin∣gered
a moment, and then parted, Valan∣court
seemed to force himself from the spot;
he passed hastily up the avenue, and Emily,
as she moved slowly towards the chateau,
heard his distant steps. She listened to the
sounds, as they sunk fainter and fainter,
till the melancholy stillness of night alone
remained; and then hurried to her cham∣ber,
to seek repose, which, alas! was fled
from her wretchedness.</P>
