<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>COULD some gentlemen of approved ability have been prevailed
upon to do justice to the subject of the following Ode, the present
apology would have been unnecessary;—but as it was requisite to
produce something of this kind upon the occasion, and the lot
having unluckily fallen on the person perhaps the least qualified to
succeed in the attempt, it is hoped the candour of the public will
esteem the performance rather as an act of duty, than vanity in the
author.</P>
<P>As some news-paper writers have illiberally endeavoured to shake
the poetic character of our immortal bard (too deeply indeed rooted
in the heart to be affected by them) it is recommended to those
who are not sufficiently established in their dramatic faith, to peruse
a work lately published, called, <HI>An Essay on the Writings and Genius
of</HI> SHAKESPEARE, by which they will with much satisfaction be
convinced, that <HI>England</HI> may justly boast the honour of producing
the greatest dramatic poet in the world.</P>
<P>To strengthen and justify the general admiration of this astonish∣ing
Genius, it has been thought proper to subjoin to the Ode some
undeniable Testimonies (both in prose and verse) of his unequalled
original talents.</P>
<P>If it shall be found, that <HI>speaking</HI> that part of the Ode, which
has usually been conveyed in recitative, produces a better effect,
the Author flatters himself he may lay claim to some little merit on
that account: As to the Ode itself, he presents it to the public as
an object of their good-nature,—to his friends as an exercise of
their partiality,—to his enemies, as a lucky opportunity of venting
their wit, humour, criticism, spleen, or whatever else they please,
should they think it worthy of their notice.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Though there are many, many more poets who have spoken of
<HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI> with equal praise and admiration, yet these, which
first occurred, were thought sufficient.—Lest any of our readers
should think with a certain gentleman, who, upon hearing <HI>Milton</HI>'s
verses in praise of <HI>SHAKESPEARE,</HI> said, He never regarded what
was said in poetry,—that the very nature of it was fiction, and
had no value without it,—there is added some undeniable testi∣monies
in prose, of <HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI>'s unparalleled genius.</P>
<Q><P>—SHAKESPEARE was a man, who, of all modern, and
perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive
soul. All the images of Nature were still present to him, and he
drew them not labouriously, but luckily: when he describes any
thing, you more than see it, you feel it too. Those who accuse
him to have wanted learning, give him the greater commendation:
he was naturally learned: he needed not the spectacles of books to
read Nature; he looked inwards, and found her there. I cannot
say he is every where alike; where he so, I should do him injury
to compare him with the greatest of mankind. But he is always
great, where some great occasion is presented to him: No man
can say he ever had a fit subject for his wit, and did not then raise
himself as high above the rest of poets,
<Q>Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi.</Q></P>
<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>Among the <HI>English,</HI> SHAKESPEARE has incomparably excelled
all others. That noble extravagance of fancy, which he had in
so great perfection, thoroughly qualified him to touch this weak
superstitious part of his reader's imagination; and made him ca∣pable
of succeeding, when he had nothing to support him besides
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
the strength of his own genius. There is something so wild, and
yet so solemn, in the speeches of his ghosts, fairies, witches, and
the like imaginary persons, that we cannot forbear thinking them
natural, though we have no rule by which to judge of them, and
must confess, if there are such beings in the world, it looks highly
probable they should talk and act as he has represented them.</P>
<P>—Our inimitable SHAKSPEARE is a stumbling-block to the
whole tribe of these rigid criticks: who would not rather read one
of his plays, when there is not a single rule of the stage observed,
than any production of a modern critic, where there is not one of
them violated? SHAKESPEARE was indeed born with all the seeds
of poetry, and may be compared to the stone of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>'s ring,
which, as <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us, had the figure of Apollo and the nine
muses in the viens of it, produced by the spontaneous hand of
Nature without any help from art.</P>
<BIBL>ADDISON.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>But certainly the greatness of this Author's genius does no where
so much appear, as where he gives his imagination an entire loose,
and raises his fancy to a flight above mankind, and the limits of the
visible world.</P>
<BIBL>ROWE.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>If ever any author deserved the name of an original it was
SHAKESPEARE. Homer himself drew not his art so immediately
from the fountains of Nature, it proceeded through Egyptian
stainers and channels, and came to him not without some tincture
of the learning, or some cast of the models of those before him.
The poetry of SHAKESPEARE was inspiration indeed: he is not so
much an imitator, as an instrument of Nature; and it is not so just
to say that he speaks from her, as that she speaks through him.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
His characters are so much Nature herself, that it is a sort of in∣jury
to call them by so distant a name as copies of her. Those of
other poets have a constant resemblance, which shews that they re∣ceived
them from one another, and were but multipliers of the
same image: each picture, like a mock rainbow, is but the re∣flection
of a reflection. But every single character in SHAKESPEARE
is as much an individual, as those in life itself; it is as impossible to
find any two alike; and such as from their relation or affinity in any
respect appear most to be twins, will, upon comparison, be found
remarkably distinct. To this life and variety of character, we must
add the wonderful preservation of it; which is such throughout
his plays, that had all the speeches been printed without the very
names of the persons, I believe one might have applied them with
certainty to every speaker.</P>
<P>The power over our passions was never possessed in a more eminent
degree, or displayed in so different instances. Yet all along, there is
seen no labour, no pains to raise them; no preparation to guide
our guess to the effect, or to be perceived to lead toward it: but
the heart swells, and the tears burst out, just at the proper places:
we are surprized the moment we weep; and yet upon reflection
find the passion so just, that we should be surprized if we had not
wept, and wept at that very moment.</P>
<P>How astonishing is it again, that the passions directly opposite to
these, Laughter and Spleen, are no less at his command! That he
is not more a master of the great, than of the ridiculous, in human
nature; of our noblest tendernesses, than of our vainest foibles;
of our strongest emotions, than of our idlest sensations!</P>
<P>Nor does he only excel in the passions; in the coolness of re∣flection
and reasoning, he is full as admirable. His sentiments are
not only in general the most pertinent and judicious upon every
subject, but by a talent very peculiar, something between pene∣tration
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
and felicity, he hits upon that particular point on which the
bent of each argument turns, or the force of each moment de∣pends.
This is perfectly amazing, from a man of no education
or experience in those great and public scenes of life, which are
usually the subject of his thoughts: so that he seems to have known
the world by intuition, to have looked through human nature at one
glance, and to be the only author that gives ground for a very new
opinion, That the philosopher, and even the man of the world,
may be born as well as the poet.</P>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>SHAKESPEARE created, as it were, the <HI>English</HI> theatre: that he
boasted a strong, fruitful genius: that he was natural and sublime:
that his scenes are beautiful and noble, though sometimes dread∣ful:
that his passages are strong and forcible, and atone sor all his
faults: and that his dramatic pieces dart such resplendant flashes
as amaze and astonish!</P><BIBL>VOLTAIRE's Letters concerning the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>


<P>In how many points of light must we be obliged to gaze at
this great poet! In how many branches of excellence to consider
and admire him! Whether we view him on the side of art or
nature, he ought equally to engage our attention: whether we re∣spect
the force and greatness of his genius, the extent of his
knowledge and reading, the power and address with which he
throws out and applies either Nature, or Learning, there is ample
scope both for our wonder and pleasure. If his diction, and the
cloathing of his thoughts attract us, how much more must we be
charmed with the richness and variety of his images and ideas! If his
images and ideas steal into our souls, and strike upon our fancy,
how much are they improved in price, when we come to reflect with
what propriety and justness they are applied to character! If we
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
look into his characters, and how they are furnished and propor∣tioned
to the employment he cuts out for them, how are we taken
up with the mastery of his portraits! What draughts of Nature!
What variety of originals, and how differing from each other! How
are they dressed from the stores of his own luxurious imagination,
without being the apes of mode, or borrowing from any foreign
wardrobe!</P>
<BIBL>THEOBALD.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>Since therefore other nations have taken care to dignify the works
of their most celebrated poets with the fairest impressions, beauti∣fied
with the ornaments of sculpture, well may our SHAKESPEARE
be thought to deserve no less consideration: and as a fresh acknow∣ledgment
hath lately been paid to his merit, and a high regard to his
name and memory, by erecting his statue at a public expence; so it
it is desired that this new edition of his works, which has cost some
attention and care, may be looked upon as another small monument
designed and dedicated to his honour.</P>
<BIBL>HANMER.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, whose excellent Genius opened to
him the whole heart of man, all the mines of Fancy, all the
stores of nature, and gave him power beyond all other writers to
move, astonish, and delight mankind.</P>
<BIBL>Lord LYTTELTON.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>Of all the literary exercitations of speculative man, whether de∣signed
for the use or entertainment of the world, there are none of
so much importance, or what are more of our immediate concern,
than those which let us into the knowledge of our nature. Others
may exercise the reason, or amuse the imagination; but these only
can improve the heart, and form the human mind to wisdom. Now
in this science our SHAKESPEARE is confessed to occupy the fore∣most
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
place; whether we consider the amazing sagacity with which
he investigates every hidden spring and wheel of human action; or
his happy manner of communicating this knowledge, in the just
and lively paintings which he has given us of all our passions, appe∣tites,
and pursuits.</P>
<BIBL>WARBURTON.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>I shall not attempt any laboured encomiums on SHAKESPEARE,
or endeavour to set forth his perfections, at a time when such uni∣versal
and just applause is paid him: He himself tells us,
<Q><L>To gild refined gold, or paint the lily,</L>
<L>To throw a perfume on the violet,</L>
<L>To smooth the ice, or add another hue</L>
<L>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</L>
<L>To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,</L>
<L>Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</L></Q>And wasteful and ridiculous indeed it would be, to say any thing
in his praise, when presenting the world with such a collection of
beauties, as perhaps is no where to be met with; and, I may very
safely affirm, cannot be paralleled from the productions of any
other single author, ancient or modern.</P>

<BIBL>DODD.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>—If such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently
reproach him, that his first act passed at <HI>Venice,</HI> and his next at
<HI>Cyprus.</HI> Such violations of rules merely passive, becomes the com∣prehensive
Genius of SHAKESPEARE, and such censures are suitable
to the minute and slender criticism of Voltaire:
<Q><L>Non usque adeo permiscuit imis</L>
<L>Longus summa dies, ut non, si voce Metelli</L>
<L>Serventur leges, malint a Caesare telli.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"/>
This therefore is the praise of SHAKESPEARE, that his drama is
the mirrour of life; that he who has mazed his imagination, in fol∣lowing
the phantoms which other writers raise up before him, may
here be cured of his delirious extasies, by reading human senti∣ments
in human language; by scenes from which a hermit may
estimate the transactions of the world, and a confessor predict the
progress of the passions.</P>
<BIBL>JOHNSON.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>—My design amounted to no more than a desire to en∣courage
others to think of preserving the oldest editions of the
<HI>English</HI> writers, which are growing scarcer every day; and to afford
the world all the assistance or pleasure it can receive from the most
authentic copies extant of its NOBLEST POET.</P>
<BIBL>STEVENS.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>It is said of the ostrich, that she drops her egg at random, to be
disposed of as chance pleases; either brought to maturity by the
sun's kindly warmth, or else crushed by beasts, and the feet of pas∣sengers:
such, at least, is the account which naturalists has given us
of this extraordinary bird; and admitting it for a truth, she is in
this a fit emblem of almost every great genius; they conceive and
produce with ease those noble issues of human understanding; but
incubation, the dull work of putting them correctly upon paper,
and afterwards publishig, is a task they cannot away with. If the
original state of all such author's writings, even from <HI>Homer</HI> down∣ward,
could be inquired into and known, they would yield proof
in abundance of the justness of what is here asserted: but the author
now before us shall suffice for them all; being at once the greatest
instance of genius in producing noble things, and of negligence in
providing for them afterwards.</P>
<BIBL>CAPEL.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><PB N="33" REF="34"/>
<P>There was a time, when the art of Johnson was set above the
divinest raptures of SHAKESPEARE. The present age is well con∣vinced
of the mistake. And now the Genius of SHAKESPEARE is
idolized in its turn. Happily for the public taste it can scarcely be
too much so.</P>
<BIBL>HURD.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>SHAKESPEARE is a kind of established religion in poetry, and
his bays will always flourish with undiminished verdure. When
I say this, I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of trans∣gressions,
but for every transgression he recompences his auditors
with beauties which no art will ever equal. That the notes
established by <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> are agreeable to nature, I am
ready to allow, and that inferior geniuses may avail themselves by
a skilful conformity to them, I as freely assent to. But fable is but
a secondary beauty; the exhibition of character, and the excite∣ment
of the passions, justly claim the precedence in dramatic
poetry. It is in writing as in gardening, where nature does not
afford spontaneous beauties, recourse must be had to the establish∣ments
of slow and endeavouring art, to the regularity of uniform
vistas, the intricacy of elaborate mazes, and a studied insertion of
ever-greens; but when the course of the country of itself presents
attractive scenes on every side, when the trees branch out with a
free expansion, and the bold prospect surprizes with the heath, the
lawn, the hill, and valley in wild variety, the littleness of tedious
culture is unnecessary, and trifling ornaments are unlooked for.</P>

<P><HI>Voltaire</HI> is a genius, but not of SHAKESPEARE's magnitude
Without recurring to disputable authority, I appeal from <HI>Voltaire</HI>
to himself. I shall not avail myself of his former encomiums on
our mighty poet; though the <HI>French</HI> critic has twice translated the
same speech in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> some years ago in admiration, latterly in de∣rision;
and I am sorry to find that his judgment grows weaker,
when it ought to be further matured.</P>
<BIBL>WALPOLE.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>Such is SHAKESPEARE's merit, that the more just and refined the
taste of the nation has become, the more he has increased in re∣putation.
He was approved by his own age, admired by the next,
and is revered, and almost adored by the present. His merit is
disputed by little wits, and his errors are the jests of little critics;
but there has not been a great poet, or great critic, since his time,
who has not spoken of him with the highest veneration, Mr. <HI>Vol∣taire</HI>
excepted. His translations often, his criticisms still oftener,
prove he did not perfectly understand the words of the author: and
therefore it is certain he could not enter into his meaning. He com∣prehended
enough to perceive he was unobservant of some established
rules of composition; the felicity with which he performs what no
rules can teach, escapes him. Will not an intelligent spectator ad∣mire
the prodigious structures of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> because he does not
know by what law of mechanics they were raised? Like them our
author's works will remain for ever the greatest monuments of the
amazing force of nature, which we ought to view as we do other
prodigies, with an attention to, and admiration of their stupendous
parts, and proud irregularity of greatness.</P>
