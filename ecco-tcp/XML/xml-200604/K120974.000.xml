<HEAD>TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a Time, when all Communities Congratulate Your MAJESTY on the <HI>Glories</HI> of Your Reign, which are continually rising from the <HI>Prosperities</HI> of Your People; be graciously pleas'd, <HI>Dread Sir,</HI> to permit the lowest of Your Subjects from the <HI>Theatre,</HI> to take this Occasion of offering their most Humble Acknowledgments for Your Royal Favour and Protection.</P>
<P>YOUR Comedians, SIR, are an Unhappy Society, whom some Severe Heads think wholly Useless, and o∣thers Dangerous to the Young and Innocent: This Come∣dy is therefore an Attempt to remove that Prejudice, and to shew, what Honest and Laudable Uses may be made of the <HI>Theatre,</HI> when its Performaces keep close to the true Purposes of its Institution: That it may be necessary to divert the Sullen and Dissaffected from busying their Brains to disturb the Happiness of a Government, which (for want of proper Amusements) they often enter into Wild and Seditious Schemes to reform: And that it may likewise make those very Follies the Ridicule and Diver∣sion even of those that committed them. Our Labours have at least this Glory to boast, That since Plays were first Exhibited in <HI>England,</HI> they were never totally sup∣press'd, but by those very People, that turn'd our <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Constitution,</HI> into <HI>Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Anarchy.</HI></P>
<P>OF all Errors, those that are the Effect of <HI>Superstition</HI> make us naturally most obstinate; it is therefore no won∣der, that the Blinded Proselytes of our Few Non-Juring Clergy, are so hard to be recover'd by the clearest Evi∣dences of Sense and Reason. But when a <HI>Principle</HI> is once made truly <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> it is not in the Power of Human Nature not to be <HI>asham'd</HI> of it. From which Reflection, I was first determin'd to attack those <HI>lurking</HI> Enemies of our Constitution from the Stage: And though my Success has far exceeded my Expectation, yet I grieve, when I (perhaps with Vanity) imagine it might had thrice the
<PB REF="4"/>
good Effect on the Minds of Your MAJESTY'S People, were it not under the <HI>Misfortune</HI> of being written by a <HI>Comedian.</HI> I am therefore in some Terror, notwithstanding its Publick Applause, to reflect how far Your MAJESTY, in Your Wisdom, may think it proper to with-hold Your Pardon for the Unlicensed Boldness of my Undertaking. I am sensible it may be justly urg'd against me, That e∣ven <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Loyalty</HI> might have lost their Lustre, by ap∣pearing reduc'd to want the Defence of so inconsidera∣ble a Champion: But as I never believ'd the best Play could be supported in an Ill Cause; so was I assur'd the worst might pass, with Favour, in a Good one. And though my Duty and Concern has made me more careful in the Conduct of this, than any of my former Endea∣vours; I am convinc'd, that what may have been extra∣ordinary in the Success of it, is utterly owing to a happy Choice of the Subject: And as its meeting no Opposition from our Publick Malecontents, seems, in some Degree, an Argument of the Clear and Honest Truth of those Principles it vindicates; so may it of the equal Falshood of the Rebellious and Unchristian Tenets it exposes. Nay, I have yet a farther Hope, that it has even disco∣vered the Strength and Number of the <HI>Misguided</HI> to be much less, than may have been artfully infinuated; there being no Assembly where People are so free, and apt to speak their Minds, as in a Crowded <HI>Theatre;</HI> Of which Your MAJESTY may have lately seen an Instance, in the Insuppressible Acclamations that were given on Your appearing to Honour this Play with Your Royal Presence.</P>
<P>BUT were the Disaffected yet as Numerous, as some Few may wish them, What Honest <HI>Englishman</HI> can ever think them formidable, that considers his Security in the Wisdom of Your MAJESTY'S <HI>Counsels,</HI> and Your He∣roick <HI>Resolution</HI> to Execute them? And as every Action of Your Regal Power has shewn the Nation, that Your greatest <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Delight</HI> is in being the <HI>Father</HI> of Your <HI>People;</HI> so may it Convince its Enemies, that <HI>they</HI> will always find You KING of Your <HI>Subjects.</HI>—But I am wandring into Thoughts that awe me into Silence; and humbly beg Leave to Subscribe my self,</P>
<CLOSER>May it please Your <HI>MAJESTY,</HI> <SIGNED>Your <HI>MAJESTY'S</HI> Most Dutiful, and Most Obedient, Subject and Servant, COLLEY CIBBER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>We mean to souse <HI>Old Satan</HI> and the <HI>Pope;</HI></L>
<L>They've no <HI>Relations</HI> here, nor <HI>Friends</HI> we hope.</L>

<L>Nor think our Colours may too strongly paint</L>
<L>The Stiff <HI>Nonjuring-Separation-Saint.</HI></L>
<L>Good Breeding ne'er commands us to be Civil</L>
<L>To those who give the Nation to the <HI>Devil;</HI></L>
<L>Who at our Surest, `Best Foundation strike,</L>
<L>And hate our Monarch and <HI>our Church</HI> alike:</L>
<L><HI>Our Church</HI>—which aw'd with Reverential Fear,</L>
<L>Scarcely the Muse presumes to mention here.</L>
<L>Long may she these, her <HI>worst</HI> of Foes, defy,</L>
<L>And lift her Mitred Head triumphant to the Sky;</L>
<L>While <HI>theirs</HI>—but Satyr silently disdains</L>
<L>To name, what lives not but in <HI>Madmen's Brains.</HI></L>

In close Back Rooms his Reuted Flocks he rallys,</L>

<L>There safe, he lets his thund'ring Censures fly,</L>

<L>And Excommunicates three Storys high.</L>
<L>Why, since a Land of Liberty they hate,</L>
<L>Still will they linger in this Freeborn State?</L>
<L>Here, every Hour, fresh hateful Objects rise,</L>
<L>Peace and Prosperity afflict their Eyes:</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't dispute your Authority, Sir: but am I am your Son too, I think it my Duty to be concern'd for your Honour: Have not you countenanced his addresses to my Sister! Has not she receiv'd them? How then is it possible, That either you or she with Honour can recede?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir? Suppose I was about buying a Pad-nag for your Sister, and upon Enquiry should find him not sound: Pray, Sir, would there be any great Dis∣honour in being off o'the Bargain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Submission, Sir, I don't take that to be the Case. Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI>'s Birth and Fortune are too well known to you; and I dare swear he may desy the World, to lay a Blemish upon his Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, since I must be catechis'd, I must tell you, I don't like his Principles: For I am in∣form'd he is a Time-server, one that basely flatters the Government, and has no more Religion than you have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we don't either of us think it proper to make boast of our Religion; but if you please to enquire, you will find we go to Church as orderly as the rest of our Neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! to what Church!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>—St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church—The establish'd Church.</P>

<P>Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you need not stare, Sir; and before he values himself upon going to Church, I would first have him be sure he is a Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Christian, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's my Question, Whether he is yet christned? I mean, by a Pastor, that had a Divine, Un∣interrupted, Successive Right to mark him as a Sheep of the true Fold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible! are you an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and offer Sir, a Question so uncharitable, not only to him, but the whole Nation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, you may give your self what Air of Amazement you please,—I won't argue with you; you are both of you too harden'd to be converted now, but since you thing it your Duty, as a Son, to be con∣cern'd for my Errors, I think it as much mine, as a Fa∣ther, to be concern'd for yours—I'll only tell you of them, if you think fit to mend them—so—if not—take the Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>O! give me Temper, Heaven! this vile nonjuring Zealot! what poisonous Principles has he swell'd him with!—Well, Sir, since you don't think it proper to argue upon this Subject, I'll wave it too. But if I may ask it without Offence, Are these your only Reasons for discountenancing Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI>'s Address to my Sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>These! are they not flagrant! would you have me marry my Daughter to a Pagan! for so he is, and all of you, till you are regularly Christians. In short, Son, expect to inherit no Estate of mine, unless you resolve to come into the Pale of the Church, of which I prosess my self a Member.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I always was, Sir, and hope I am still, unless you have lately been converted to the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I abhor the Thoughts on't; and Protest against their Errors as much as you do.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, Sir, Where's our Difference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Difference! 'twould make you tremble, Sir, to know it! but since 'tis fit you should know it, look there— <STAGE>[Gives him a Book]</STAGE> read that, and be reform'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's here? <STAGE>(Reads)</STAGE> <HI>The Case of Schism,</HI> &amp;c. Thank you, Sir, I have seen enough of this in the <HI>Daily Courant,</HI> to be sorry its in any Hands, but those of the common Hangman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Prophanation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>And though I always honour'd your Concern for the Church's Welfare, I little thought 'twas for a Church that is establish'd no where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O, Perverseness! but there is no better to be expected from your Course of Life: This is all the Effects of your modern Loyalty, your Conversation at <HI>Button</HI>'s. Will you never leave that foul Nest of Heresy and Schism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, when I see any Thing like it there; and should think my self oblig'd to retire, where such Principles were started—I own I use the Place, be∣cause I generally meet there instructive or diverting Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, fine Company indeed, <HI>Arians,</HI> Party-Po∣ets, Players and Presbyterians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a very unusual Mixture, Sir; but if a Man entertains me innocently, am I oblig'd to enquire into his Profession, or Principles? Would not it be ridiculous for a Protestant that loves Musick, to refuse going to the <HI>Opera,</HI> because most of the Performers are Papists? But, Sir, this seems foreign to my Business; Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI> in∣tends this Morning to pay his Respects to you, in hopes to obtain your final Consent; and desired me to be pre∣sent, as a Mediator of Articles between you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's kind, indeed, Sir.</P>

<P>May be not, Sir—for I will not be at home when he comes.</P>

<P>Nay, pray, Sir, 'twill be but Civility, at least, to hear him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And because I won't tell a Lie for the Matter, I'll go out this Moment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But because I won't deceive him neither, tell him, I would not have him lose his Time, in fooling af∣ter your Sister—In short, I have another Man in my Head for her.</P>
<STAGE>(Exit Sir <HI>John.</HI></STAGE>

<P>Another Man!

<P>Well then, provided it is not upon the Subject of Love, I will be so—but make Haste too—for I have not had my Tea yet.</P>

<P>To a Degree: Do you think a Man has any more Charms for me for my Father's liking him? No, Sir, if Mr. <HI>Heartley</HI> can make his Way to me now, he is oblig'd to me only: Besides, now it may have the Face of an Amour indeed: Now one has something to struggle for; there's Difficulty, there's Danger, there's the dear Spirit of Contradiction in it too. O I like it mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad this does not make you think the worse of <HI>Heartley</HI>—but however, a Father's Consent might have clapt a pair of Horses more to your Coach perhaps, and the want of that, may pinch your Fortune.</P>

<P>No, no, Brother; the Suits of my Lovers shall not be ended, like those at Law, by dull Council on both sides, I'll hear nothing but what the Plaintiff himself can say to me; 'twould be a pretty Thing indeed to confine my Airs to the Directions of a Sollicitor, to look kind or cruel, only as the Jointure propos'd▪ is, or is not, equal to the Fortune my Father designs me: What do you think I'll have my Features put into the <HI>Gazette</HI> to be dispos'd of, like a parcel of dirty Acres, by an old Master in Chancery to the fairest Bidder?

<P>Ay, it's no Matter for that, its violently pleasant, and there's no Law against it, that I know of. You had best advise your Friend <HI>Heartley</HI> to bring in a Bill to pre∣vent it: All the discarded Toasts, Prudes, and superan∣nuated Virgins would give him their Interest I dare swear.

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my Friend, you mistake her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O pardon me, had she any real Concern for me, the Apprehension of a Man's Addresses, whom yet she never saw, must have alarm'd her to be something more than serious.</P>

<P>And pray Sir, may I not as well suspect, that this artful Delay of her good Nature to me now, is meant as a provisional Defence against my Reproaches, in case, when she has seen this Man, she should think it conve∣nient to prefer him to Me?</P>

<P>No; but as a stander by, I often see more of the Game than you do: Don't you know that she is naturally Coquette? And a Coquett's Play with a serious Lover, is like a Back game at Tables, all open at first; she'll make you twenty Blots—and you—spare none, take them All up, to be sure, while she—gains Points upon you: So that when you eagerly expect to end the Game on your Side, slap—as you were, she whips up your Man, she's fortified, and you are in a worse Condition, than when you begun with her—Upon which, you know of Course, you curse your Fortune, and she laughs at you.</P>

At Dinner he never fails to sit next her, and will eat nothing but what she helps him; always takes her side in Argument, and when he bows after Grace, constantly Ogles her; bids my Sister, if she would look lovely, learn to Dress by her; and at the Tea-Table, I have seen the impudent Goat most lusci∣ously sip off her leavings.

<P>It is indeed a Spiritual Comfort to find my La∣bours in the Cause are not forgotten; though I must own some less conspicuous Instance of their Favour had better suited me: Such high Distinctions are invidious; and it would really grieve me, Sir, among my Friends, to meet with Envy where I only hope for Love; not but I submit in any way to serve them.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a Man! never in such sanguine hopes—the Court's extremely throng'd—never was there such a con∣course of Warlike Exiles: though they talk, this sharp Season, of removing farther into <HI>Italy,</HI> for the benefit of mil∣der Air: Well! The Catholicks are the sincerest Friends!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I must do them Justice, they are truly Zealous in the Cause, and it has often griev'd my Heart, that our Churches Differences are so utterly Irreconcile∣able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct.</SPEAKER>
<P>O nourish still that charitable Thought! there's something truly Great and Humane in it; and really, Sir, if you examine well the Doctrines laid down, by my learned Predecessor, in his <HI>Case of Schism,</HI> you will find those Differences are not so terribly material, as some obstinate Schismaticks would paint them: Ah! could we but be brought to Temper, a great many seeming Contradictions might be reconcil'd on both finds: But while the Laity will interpret for themselves, there is indeed no doing it. Now, could we, Sir, like other Nations, but once restrain that monstrous Licence. Ah! Sir, a Union then might soon be practicable.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Auh!

No no, it is not Force will do the Thing, your Press'd Men don't al∣ways make the best Soldiers. And truly, my Lord, we seem to be wrong too in another Point, to which I have often imputed the ill Success of our Cause; and that is, the taking into our Party so may loose Persons of disso∣lute and abandon'd Morals; Fellows, whom in their dai∣ly private Course of Life, the Pillory and Gallows seem to groan for.</P>

<P>'Tis true indeed, and I have often wish'd 'twere possible to do without them, but in a Multitude all Men won't be all Saints; and then again they are really use∣ful; nay, and in many things, that Sober Men will not stoop to—They serve, poor Curs, to brak at the Govern∣ment in the open Streets, and keep up the wholsome

Spirit of Clamour in the common People; and, Sir, you cannot conceive the wonderful use of Clamour, 'tis so teiz∣ing to a Ministry, it makes them winch and fret, and grow uneasy in their Posts—Ah! many a comfortable Point has been gain'd by Clamour! 'tis in the Nature of Mankind to yield more to that, than Reason—E'en <HI>Socrates</HI> himself could not resist it; for wise, as he was, yet you see his Wife <HI>Xantippe</HI> carried all her Points by Clamour. Come, come, Clamour is a useful Monster, and we must feed the hungry Mouths of it; it being of the last Importance to us, that hope to change the Government to let it have no quiet.</P>

<P>No, Madam; but I own in Principles of very little difference, which I imbib'd chiefly from this Doctor; he having been five Years my Governor. As I grew up, my Father'sMerit had rais'd his Fortune under the present Go∣vernment; and fearing I might be too far fix'd in Principles against it, desired me from my Uncle Home again: But I, as I then thought my self bound in Gratitude, excus'd my going in Terms of Duty to my Father; whom since alas! I too justly have provok'd ever to hope a Reconciliation. I saw too late my Folly, and had no Defence against his

<P>Your kind Compassion, Madam, has prevented, what, if I durst, I should have mention'd, I hope too, I shall personally deserve his Favour; if not, your gene∣rous Inclination to have sav'd me, even in my last Despair of Life, will give my Heart a Joy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! the poor unfortunate Boy loves me too? what shall I do with him? But, Mr. <HI>Charles,</HI> pray once more to your Story—what was it that really drew you into the Rebellion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Doctor, Madam, who, as he is now your Father's, was then my Uncle's Bosom-Counsellor: 'Twas his infidious Tongue that painted it to us as an incumbent Duty, on which the Welfare of our Souls depended; he warm'd us too into such a weak Belief of vile Reports, as Infamy should blush to mention—we were assur'd, that half the Churches here in Town were lying all in sacri∣legious Ruines; which since, I found, maliciously was meant, even of those that are magnificently rising from their new Foundation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray—while you were in Arms how did the Doctor dispose of himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>He!—went with us, Madam, none so active in the Front of Resolution, till Danger came to face him; then indeed a friendly Fever seiz'd him, which on the first Alarm of the King's Forces marching towards <HI>Preston,</HI> gave him a cold Pretence to leave the Town; in the Defence

of which my Uncle lost his Life, and I my only Friend, with all my long fed Hopes of Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Wretch but how came you to avoid being Prisoner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon our Surrender of the Place, I brib'd a Townsman to employ me, as his Servant, in a backward Working-house, where, from my Youth, and Change of Habit, I pass'd without Suspicion till the whole Affair was over—But then, alas! whither to turn I knew not: My Life grew now no more my Care—Perish, I saw, I must, whether as a Criminal, or a Beggar, was my only Choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord! tell me quickly how you came hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this Despair I wander'd up to <HI>London,</HI> where I scarce knew one Mortal, but some few Friends in Prison. What could I do? I ventur'd even hither for my Safety; where 'twas my Fortune first to see your Father, Madam, distributing Relief to several: He knew my Uncle well; and being inform'd of my Condition, he charitably took me Home; and here has ever since conceal'd me as a me∣nial Servant to the Doctor. The Detestation of whose vile, dishonest Practices at last have waked me to a Sense of all my blinded Errors; of which this Writing is his least of sordid Instances.</P>

Can you suppose, that I'm to stand confounded, as a Criminal before you? How despicable a Figure must a Woman make, to bear but such a Mo∣ment? Come, come, there's nothing shews so low a Mind, as these grave, and insolent Jealousies.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Charles,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>This Day, by Colonel <HI>Woodvil,</HI> I receiv'd the joyful News of your being yet alive, and well: Though that's but half my Comfort. He has assur'd me too, you have renounc'd those Principles, that made me think your Death my Happiness. The Services you have in∣tended his Family, and may do the Government, in your just Detecti∣on of a Traytor that would ruin both, have been so well receiv'd at Court, and so generously represented there by the <HI>Colonel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Heartly,</HI> that they have obtain'd an Order for your Pardon; which I now stay the passing of, before I throw my Arms about you, that I may have no Doubt or Fear behind to interupt the Fulness of my Joy. I am inform'd, that in revealing your self to a certain fair Lady, you have let fall some Words, that shew you have an innocent tho' hopeless Passion for her. Your Youth excuses what is past; but now consider how far you owe your Life to Mr. <HI>Heartly:</HI> I there∣fore charge you, on my Blessing, to give up every idle Thought of Love, that may interrupt his Happiness, or abate the Merit of what you've done to deserve the Pardon of your Sovereign, or of your af∣fectionate forgiving Father,</P>

<P>Dear <HI>Maria,</HI> what will become of us? The Tyran∣ny of this subtle Priest is insupportable: He has so fortified himself in Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Opinion by this last Misconduct of your Brother, that I begin to lose my usual Power with him.</P>

<P>No, no, he presses it, to keep Sir <HI>John</HI> still blind to his wicked Design upon me—Therefore I came to give you notice, that you might be prepar'd to receive him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am oblig'd to your Ladyship: Our Meeting will be a tender Scene, no doubt on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard, I suppose, what an extrava∣gant Settlement your Father has sign'd to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; but I am glad your Ladyship's like to be a Gainer by it, however: For when I marry, it will be without the Doctor's Consent, depend upon't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Child, I did not come into Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Fa∣mily with a Design to injure it, or make any one of it my Enemy: Whenever that Four Thousand Pound falls into my Hands, you'll find it as firmly yours, as if it had been given you, without that odious Condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I think my self as much oblig'd by this kind Intention, as the Performance: But if your Ladyship could yet find a way to prove this Hypocrite a private Vil∣lain to my Father, I am not without Hopes the Publick will soon have enough against him, to give a Turn to the Settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose that fails, what will become of your poor Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Madam, I cannot suppose this Fellow must not be hang'd at last; and then, you know, the same honest Hand that ties him up, releases the Settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely, neither; for this very House is given him in present, which, tho' that were to be the End of him, would then be sorfeited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then my Brother must ev'n petition the Go∣vernment. There have been Presidents of the same Fa∣vour, Madam. If not, he must pay for his Blundering, and lay his next Plot deeper, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you are so chearful upon it, however; it looks as if you had something <HI>in Petto</HI> to depend upon. But here comes the Doctor.</P>

<P>Well there is, however, some Merit in speaking Truth; therefore to be as just on my side, I ought in Conscience to let you know, that I have as cordial a Con∣tempt for you too.</P>

<P>Yes. But what do you infer from thence?</P>
</SP>

<P>That while we still preserve this Temper in our Hate, a mutual Benefit may rise from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! never fear me, Sir; I shall not fly out; being convinc'd, that nothing gives so sharp a Point to one's A version, as good Breeding; as, on the contrary, ill Man∣ners often hide a secret Inclination</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct.</SPEAKER>
<P>You over-rate my Prudence: I sought it not, but he would crowd it in among other Obligations: He is good-natur'd, and I could not shock him by a Refusal. Wou'd you have had me plainly told him, what a des∣picable Opinion I had of his Daughter?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not much to tell—Where two such tender Passions met, Words had but faintly spoke them. The Son conducted to the Door, with sudden Fear stopt short, and bursting into Sights, o'er chang'd with Shame, and Joy, had almost fainted in my Arms: The Father, touch'd with his Concern, mov'd forward with a kindly Smile to meet him. At this he took new Life, and springing from his Hold, fell protestate at his Feet; where mute, and trembling, for a while he lay: At length with streaming Eyes, and faultring Tongue, he begg'd his Blessing, and his Pardon. The tender Father caught him in his Arms, and dropping his fond Head upon his Cheek, kiss'd him, and sigh'd out, <HI>Heaven protect thee!</HI> then gave into his hand the Royal Pardon; and turning back his Face to dry his Manly Eyes, he cry'd, <HI>Deserve this Royal Mercy,</HI> Charles, <HI>and I am still thy Father.</HI> The grateful Youth. raising his Heart-swollen Voice, reply'd, <HI>May Heaven preserve the Royal Life that gave it.</HI> But here, their Passions grew too strong for farther Speech: Silent Embraces, alter∣nate Sighs, and mingling Tears, were all their Language now. The moving Scene became too tender for my Eyes, and call'd methought, for Privacy; there unperceiv'd I left them, to recover into breathing Sense, and utterable Joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! of all the inmost Transports of the Soul, there's none that dance into the Heart, like Friendly Re∣concilements.</P>

<P>That Argument might hold us now too long.—But, Sir,—here's the Case—your Principles and mine have the Misfortune to differ: Yours being (as I take it) entirely on the Revolution Side.</P>

<P>If I am not misinform'd, Sir, you your self com∣manded a Regiment in Defence of it.</P>

<P>I did so, and thought it just.—'Twould be fruitless, perhaps, to offer you the Reasons, that since have alter'd my Opinion: But now, Sir, even supposing that I err in Principle, you must still allow, that Conscience is the Rule that every honest Man ought to walk by.</P>

<P>Well, I own he has declined his Interest, in Favour of Mr. <HI>Heartly.</HI> But I must tell you, Madam, he did it in so modest, so friendly, so good-natur'd, so con∣scientious a Manner, that I now think my self more than ever bound in Honour to espouse him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Sir, (only for Arguments Sake) suppose I could prove, that all this seeming Virtue was utterly Ar∣tificial; that his Regard to Mr. <HI>Heartly</HI> was neither found∣ed upon Modesty, Friendship, Good-Nature, nor Con∣science; or in short, that he has basely betray'd and sold the Trust you made him; like a Villain barter'd, bargain'd to give me to Mr. <HI>Heartly,</HI> for half the Four Thousand Pound you have valued his Consent at.

<P>Indeed my Dear, I fear it is, it would be Cruel to her Concern to think it wholly false, can you suppose she'd urge so gross an Accusation only to expose her self to the Justice of your Resentment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What are you against him too? then he has no Friend but me, and I cannot, at so short a warning, give him up to Infamy, and Baseness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Sir, be Compos'd, and ask your Heart one farther Question:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What would you say to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>In all our mutual Course of Happiness, have I ever yet deceiv'd you with a falshood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never, I grant it, nor has my Honest Heart yet Wrong'd thy Goodness with a Jealous Thought of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you then believe me, should I accuse him too? even of Crimes, that Vertue Blushes but no mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To what Extravagance would you drive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would before have undeceiv'd you, when his late Artifice turn'd the Honest Duty of your Son, into his own Reproach, and Ruine: But knowing then your Temper was inaccessible, I durst not offer it. But now, in better Hope of being believ'd, I here avow the Truth of all he was accus'd of then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you Distract me? my Senses could not be deceiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Indeed, they were, he saw you listning, and at the Instant turn'd his Impious Barefac'd Leve to me, into Equivocal Intercessions pretending to <HI>Maria.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You Starrle me.</P>

<P>I'm all Astonishment!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir, Suspend your Wonder, Respite your Belief ev'n of this, till grosser Evidence convinces you: Sup∣pose I here, before your Face, should let you see his Villany, make him repeat his Odious Love to me, at once throw

<P>Is it possible? Make me but Witness of that Fact, and I shall soon Accuse my self, and own my Folly equal to his Baseness: But Pardon me, as I in such a Case would not believe, ev'n him Accusing you, so am I bound in equal Charity to think, you yet may be deceiv'd, in what you Charge on him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis Just—let it be so—we'll yet suppose him Innocent, till you your self pronounce him Guilty: and since I have stak'd my Faith upon the Truth of what I urge, 'tis fit we bring him to immediate Tryal: But then Sir, I must beg you to descend ev'n to the poorShifts we are reduc'd to.</P>

<P>O! think then, what I endure for you, such are my Pains; but such is my Sincerity, tho' I fear my being reduc'd to feign a Passion for <HI>Maria,</HI> in my late Surprize, has done dishonour to the Vows I then preferr'd to You.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady W.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas on that Point, I wanted now to talk with you, not knowing then, how fat you might mistake my Silence: Now had I clos'd with the Colonel in Accusing You, it would have been plain I was your Enemy; as had I joyn'd in your Defence against him, it had been as grossly evident I was his; but since I have Uses for his Friend∣ship, and, as I saw your Credit with Sir <HI>John</HI> needed no support, I hope you'll think betwixt the two Extremes I have acted but a prudent Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me presume to hope then, what I did, you Judge was Self-Defence, and pure Necessity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Perjury! for such it must have been, should I have charg'd, as you'd have had me, this Gentleman with Treason: What Facts have I been privy to, that reach that Name? The Worst I know of him, is, that all the Factious Falshoods you have rais'd against the best of Princes, he, blinded with your Hypocrisy, believ'd.</P>

<P>For thee my Son, whose filial Virtues I have Injur'd; this Honest Deed in every Article shall be ratified: I see your Eyes are all upon me, expecting from that vile Traytors Parctices, some Voluntary Instance of my Hearts Conver∣sion: I must be Blind indeed, were I not now convinc'd He must in all things have alike deceiv'd me, as the Di∣al that miss-tels one Hour, of Consequence is false through the whole round of Day. Let it suffice. I see my Errors with a Conscious Shame; but hope, when I am justly Weigh'd, you'll find those Errors rose but from a Ductile Heart, not Disinclin'd to Truth, but fatally misled by false Appearances:</P>

<P>Whoever knows your Private Life, must think you, Sir, in this Sincere:</P>

<P>And Now Sir, since I am sure, it will no more Offend you, give me leave to Observe, that of all the Arts our Enemies make use on to Embroil us, none seem so Audaciously Preposterous, as their Insisting, that a Nations best Security is the Word of a Prince, whose Religion In∣dulges him to give it, and at the same time Obliges him to break it: And tho' perhaps in lesser Points our Politick Disputes won't suddenly be ended, methinks there's one Principle, that all Partys might easily come into, that no Change of Government can give us a Blessing equal to our Liberty.</P>

<L>Grant us but this and then of Course you'll own,</L>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. Oldfield.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>HOW Wild, how Frantick is the vain Essay,</L>
<L>That Builds on Modern Politicks a Play!</L>
<L>Methinks to Write at all, is Bold enough,</L>
<L>But in a Play to stand a Faction Buff!</L>
<L>Not <HI>Rome</HI>'s Old Stage presum'd, (or Fame's a Fibber.)</L>
<L>And Moderns to attempt it! well said <HI>CIBBER!</HI></L>
<L>Was't not enough the Criticks might pursue him!</L>
<L>But must he rouse a Party to undo him!</L>
<L>These Blows I told him on his Play would fall,</L>
<L>But he unmov'd, cry'd—Blood! we'll Stand it all,</L>
<L>When PRIESTS turn TRAYTORS where's the mighty matter?</L>
<L>Since when has Treason been exempt from Satyr?</L>
<L>And should from Guilt a Factious Clamour Rise,</L>
<L>Such Spite must speak them <HI>England's</HI> Enemies,</L>
<L>But if <HI>Old England's</HI> Friends allow 'tis right,</L>
<L>W'are sure their Power can chace the Jacobite,</L>
<L>And put their Malice, like their Troops, to Flight.</L>
<L>As for the Criticks, Those, he owns, may Teize him,</L>
<L>Because he never took such Pains to please them,</L>
<L>In Time; Place, Action, Rules by which Old Wits</L>
<L>Made Plays, as—Dames do Puddings, by Receipts:</L>
<L>But hopes again ev'n Rebels cannot say,</L>
<L>Tho' Vanquisht, they're Insulted in his Play:</L>
<L>Nay more—To set their Cause in fairest light,</L>
<L>H' has made a Man of Sense—A Jacobite!</L>
<L>(Tho' by our Bards good leave, (to take it right,</L>
<L>His Sense was shewn, when turn'd from Jacobite)</L>
<L>Thus too the Fair, that may be wrong Inclin'd,</L>
<L>He Hopes to <HI>CHARLES's</HI> Passion will be Kind,</L>
<L>And own, at worst, on their Reflecting Pillow,</L>
<L>The Rebel, after all's, a Pretty Fellow!</L>
<L>But why, you'll say, was I made <HI>HEARTLYS</HI> Wife?</L>
<L>Consider, Fair ones, <HI>HEARTLY</HI> sav'd his Life:</L>
<L>So that you see, the Boy han't quite Miscarried</L>
<L>Beside—</L>
<L>Are all those Dears so Happy you have Married?</L>
<L>How often, in that State, has Love seen Elves</L>
<L>So Cramm'd with Comsort, they could Han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves?</L>
<L>The Worst you can against his Satyr Plead,</L>
<L>Is that My Lord of <HI>THETFORD's</HI> Hang'd indeed:</L>
<L>If that seems hard▪ why Grant him your Reprive,</L>
<L>And by an Act of Grace, let this <HI>NON-JUROR</HI> Live.</L>
