<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SO many different opinions having of late
been offered to the public concerning
the cause of the present advanced price of
provisions, some attributing it to the engross∣ing
and monopolizing of land, others to
luxury, others again to regraters and fore∣stallers;
I cannot forbear giving my senti∣ments
on these subjects, as I think the dif∣ferent
arguments I have met with are by
no means satisfactory; but such as, in
many instances, may tend to mislead my
countrymen, and inflame the imaginations
of that class, who, on such occasions, often
become riotous, and dangerous to a state.
When this is the case, it is surely incum∣bent
on every one who thinks he has it in
his power, to set such authors right where
it may appear they have been misinformed;
I shall therefore not scruple, though unac∣customed
to the press, to refute these argu∣ments
<PB REF="3"/>
in the manner which my profession en∣ables
me to do. Accordingly, I shall in the
following sheets endeavour to point out the
real causes of scarcity, and at the same time
offer such remedies as appear to me capa∣ble
of producing the desired effect; I
mean regular and moderate prices of
provisions.</P>
<P>I shall begin with the article of mono∣polizing
land, as that seems to be the
most general topic of the present times.
The evil tendency of this has been at∣tempted
to be explained by several writers,
whose plausible arguments may mislead
those who are not conversant in the na∣ture
and management of different soils,
and who therefore give credit to every
absurdity; for if the subject savours of
compassion, it is popular, and carries con∣viction,
though it is not understood.</P>

AN
INQUIRY
INTO THE
Connection between the present advanced
PRICE OF PROVISIONS,
AND THE
SIZE OF FARMS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. ON MONOPOLIZING LAND.</HEAD>
<P>TO proceed with all possible candor
in my investigation of this subject,
I shall enumerate the many evils which are
said to arise from the monopolizing of land,
whereby it is supposed the present scarcity
is artificially produced. A cool examina∣tion
of facts will probably shew us, whether
this practice bears any, and what share in
the calamity we complain of.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
It is said, <HI>First,</HI> That large farmers, by
growing opulent, become negligent of their
business; that they, consequently, do not
cultivate their lands to so much advantage
as they might, and that by this means their
produce is less than that of an equal pro∣portion
of land in the hands of many small
farmers, who, with their families, did the
chief of the work themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That large farmers, being opu∣lent,
are not under the necessity of bringing
their corn to market, but retain it, to the
great distress of the poor.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That our markets are not so
well supplied with pigs, poultry, butter,
and eggs, as when there were small far∣mers,
whose wives attended the markets
with those articles, which rendered the
price of butcher's meat cheap.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That large farms are the occa∣sion
of depopulation, whereby the num∣ber
of labourers is so much diminished,
that, in some places, there are scarcely
hands sufficient to till the ground; conse∣quently,
that the cropping of the land is
neglected, and the harvest badly got in;
both which must diminish the quantity,
and enhance the price of corn.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>SECTION I. The national benefit of proper sized farms.</HEAD>
<P>IN answer to the first of the foregoing
objections against large farms, I shall
set out with laying down a principle in
which I am confident all parties will agree;
it is, that the produce of the earth, whe∣ther
in tin, lead, iron, corn, or wool, is the
riches of our nation; and therefore, that
however those articles may be obtained, it
is the quantity that is the only national
object. Farther, that whatever the article
is, the surplus of what is wanted will be
locally a drug in real value or estimation,
till converted to its proper use; if lead or
iron, it will be sold to purchase necessaries;
if corn, we shall consume what is necessary
for our support, and the surplus will be
sold for other commodities which we may
require: at all events, it is the quantity
to be produced which the nation should
attend to. This being granted, it remains
to prove by what means the greatest quan∣tity
is to be produced.</P>
<P>The advocates for small farms will say,
By the industry which is so conspicuous
among small farmers, who, being obliged
to struggle for their livelihood, can neither
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
commit waste, nor be guilty of neglect. I
say, that it is by the industry of those who,
being easy in their circumstances, can at∣tend
their business with spirit and chear∣fulness,
and who, by daily tasting the
sweets of their labours, are encouraged to
redouble their activity. But let us consult
facts, and see which argument they will
best support.</P>
<P>It has pretty generally been laid down
as a maxim, by the gentlemen I allude to,
that farms of one hundred acres are the
proper size<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. Author of Political Speculations, and others.</NOTE>. This they say without spe∣cifying
the kind of soil; a circumstance,
surely, somewhat material to be known.
However, I will assist them in that point,
which I am enabled to do, by finding
others, or perhaps the same under another
signature, talk of 50 <HI>l.</HI> a year.—We will
therefore suppose the land at 10 <HI>s.</HI> an acre;
and as we must take the average price of
England, I will call it good loam; and to
assist their argument, I will tell them what
are the necessary requisites for such a farm.
First, it is absolutely necessary that the
farmer should have in ready cash at least
500 <HI>l.</HI>—When I mention this sum, I am
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
far within bounds: had he more, he and
his country would reap the benefit of it.
I shall not enter into the minute detail of
every instrument to be purchased, and every
operation necessary to be done, but only
chalk out the great outlines of the oeco∣nomy
necessary on such a farm.</P>
<P>He must keep at least 4 horses; 5 would
be better, but almost too much for his capi∣tal.
He must keep
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Ploughman,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Boy,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Thresher,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Maid,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Odd man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Now, without entering into the manage∣ment
of his farm, or considering whether
he is a good or a bad farmer; I mean to
prove, from the above circumstances, that
three hundred acres of such land in the
hands of one man, will produce more,
and consequently that such a sized farm,
considered in a national view, is more bene∣ficial.
I shall not be thought unreasonable
in alloting my farmer on the three hun∣dred
acres, a proportionate sum of money,
cattle, and servants.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Thus he will have 1500 <HI>l.</HI> in money,
<LIST>
<ITEM>12 Horses,</ITEM>
<ITEM>9 Men,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Boys,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Maids, or the labour of three women.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Previous to what I am now going to say,
I must mention some facts which are neces∣sary
by way of explanation to some of my
readers, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are operations on
this, and indeed almost every kind of soil,
which, at different times, require different
strength of horses: for example, sometimes
six horses will be required in one plough,
to break up a piece of ground for fallow;
thus, in this instance, the farmer of three
hundred acres will have two ploughs at
work, when the little farmer cannot have
one, but must wait till it is perhaps too
late to recover his season; or at least he
will have lost all the benefit of the roasting
weather, which is to make his fallow. On
the other hand, there are many operations
in fallowing, and in feed-time, when three-horse
ploughs are sufficient; in which case
the farm of three hundred acres will have
four three-horse ploughs at work when the
other can have but one. To this some will
say, why not in the one instance hire, and
in the other work with two-horse ploughs,
in which case they would be equal, as in
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
part of Yorkshire, Norfolk, Essex, &amp;c.
I answer, that at the one time, perhaps,
his neighbours are equally busy with him∣self;
and as to the latter, I will agree
there are times when two-horse ploughs
are useful: but if horses go abreast when
there is any moisture in this sort of land,
the damage done by their trampling the
surface of the ground, will not be recovered
in a twelvemonth. If what I have said
be truth, it is as evident, that the farmer
of three hundred acres, with a proportionate
capital and number of horses, is able to do
more than his proportion of work in the
same time; and the doing of it at the cri∣tical
juncture, is of so much the greater
consequence; thus his ground is naturally
in better tilth, his fallows, seed-time, dung∣cart,
in short, every operation performed
better, because they can be dispatched;
and his ground being in better order, it will
not be denied but that his produce must be
greater. There is also an advantage in the
proportion of servants, which will not so
easily be understood but by practical men;
for it is natural to say, As one is to four, so
are three to twelve: but this will not hold
good in practice; for, in harvest-time, and
many other operations which require that
kind of dispatch, by throwing many hands
together, the work is better and more ex∣peditiously
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
done: for example, in harvest;
two drivers, two loaders, two pitchers, two
rakers, and the rest at the rick, or in the
barn, will dispatch double the work that
the same number of hands would do, if divi∣ded
into different gangs on different farms.
Howsoever unintelligible this matter may
appear to some, it is fact. But the circum∣stance
of the great farmer's employing an
equal number of men may be denied; in
answer to which I can only say, that daily
observation proves it, and shall add more∣over,
that reapers will flock to him, when
the little farmer is not able to get a hand:
the reason is evident, namely, that labourers
will always prefer that master who is most
likely to employ them longest, that they
may not lose time in shifting. But as I
mean to confute by facts, and not by argu∣ments,
I will appeal to the farmer, whe∣ther
what I advance is true or not.</P>
<P>The great farmer will also have a con∣siderable
advantage in respect to his carts
and waggons; for he will not require above
two waggons and four carts, whereas each
of the little ones is obliged to have one
waggon and two carts; thus there will be
a saving of the expence of one waggon
and two carts on an equal spot of ground;
which surplus may be expended in stock
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
or labour: the same will hold good with
regard to harrows, rollers, and many other
implements.</P>
<P>There is likewise a national advantage
attending this farm, which cannot be on
the small one; I mean, the keeping of
live stock; oxen, or sheep, or both. It
may be asked, Why? and whether an
equal number of cattle may not be kept
on the three small farms? The reasons
why they cannot are many: The pur∣chasing
of stock, and providing artificial
food for them, not only requires capital,
but the resolution of a man in an extensive
business: for though 500<HI>l.</HI> are the pro∣portion
for one hundred acres, yet sup∣posing
a part laid by for such purposes,
I will say 50<HI>l.</HI> out of each 500<HI>l.</HI> my argu∣ment
is, that 150<HI>l.</HI> in the hands of one
man, will encourage him to do more than
50<HI>l.</HI> in those of the other. For the truth
of this I will appeal to the feelings of
farmers, or indeed of men on the Royal
Exchange. However, there is a yet more
substantial reason; which is, that the little
farmer cannot do it with so much profit;
for suppose he should have a flock of one
hundred sheep, which is a great many for
such a farm, that flock will not maintain
a shepherd, though it requires as much
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
care and attendance as triple the number,
which would be very easily tended by one
man; nor is it sufficient to make a bene∣ficial
fold: even if there is a common, the
small farmer will not reap an equal advan∣tage
with the larger; for his sheep must
straggle by themselves, and the shepherd
who attends the large flock will always
take care to have the best feed, while the
others are drove among bushes and furzes
to seek a miserable livelihood; losing per∣haps
half their wool before sheering time;
and thus they become of less benefit, either
to the owners or to the nation. With
oxen, it is nearly the same: there must
be artificial food provided for them, which
is rarely seen on small farms; nor indeed
will the little farmer easily be induced to
go into such a culture: his capital is too
small, and he trusts to his corn to pay his
rent, though the benefit of the dung of
these cattle would be very considerable.
This is one of the great advantages which
attends the farmer who at the same time is
the grazier; and who is of so much more
value to his country, as he can, by the
assistance of artificial pasture, bring cattle
to market at a cheaper rate than when fed
on old pastures and hay; with the addi∣tional
benefit to the nation, of employing
more hands in procuring that food for the
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
cattle, though they can be brought to mar∣ket
cheaper, and will be of course when
the practice becomes more general.</P>
<P>In opposition to these arguments, I hear
some say, that corn can be raised cheapest by
the small farmer, because the chief of the
labour is executed by himself and his fa∣mily,
whereas the labour on the great farm
is done by others, whose wages must be
paid out of the profits. Those who argue
thus are little acquainted with husbandry
affairs; for it will appear upon inquiry,
that there neither is or can be one servant
less kept on the three small farms, than
there are on the three hundred acres in the
hands of one man. However industrious
the small farmer may be, it does not exempt
him from keeping one single servant the
less; he must have, as I said before,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Ploughman,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Boy,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Thresher,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Odd-man,</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 Maid.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If his sons and daughters are grown up,
and able to do the business of the farm,
they seldom remain at home; and if they
do, they are not maintained for so little as
hired servants: but we will suppose that
matter equal. I only mean to prove, that
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
the farmer cannot rely on his own labour;
and if he does, I will maintain that he
is a loser by it. His employment should
be, a general attention to the whole: his
thresher must be watched, or he will soon
lose his wages in corn not threshed out;
his mowers, reapers, &amp;c. must be looked
after; he must constantly go round his
sences; he must see there is no neglect;
which would be the case if he was con∣fined
to any one spot: if he chances to
have a few sheep, they will require as
much attendance as a larger flock; yet he
cannot afford to keep a shepherd: thus
there are three men employed to look after
three hundred acres, which would be at
least as well managed by one man on his
horse. To this it will be said, No; the
great farmer growing opulent, becomes
negligent, and of course, his ground is
not so well managed, and his produce is
consequently less. This is a contradiction
in terms; for if he grows opulent, in
what manner did he acquire his riches,
but by having a greater return for his
capital, and thereby being able to lay up
something annually, which the small far∣mer
seldom or ever has it in his power to do,
unless indeed by a very uncommonly spi∣rited
husbandry. There cannot be a clearer
proof that a certain tract in the hands of
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
one man produces more than in the hands
of many: for was it otherwise, and that
he was carrying on a losing trade, it is a
known fact, that the greater his undertak∣ing,
the sooner he would be ruined: but
on the other hand, if there is ever so small
an annual saving, that will soon accumu∣late;
and I will venture to say, that the
man who finds he is carrying on a pro∣fitable
business, will attend it with infi∣nitely
more spirit, than the poor dejected
wretch, who is always labouring against
the stream.</P>
<P>But this calculation of the comparative
advantage of labour on the great and small
farms, only regards the common business
of a farmer, without taking in the several
great works of marling, land-draining, &amp;c.
by which such considerable improvements
have been made, but which there is rarely,
if ever, an instance of on small farms, for
want of a sufficient capital for such an under∣taking;
and when I mention this advan∣tage,
let it be remembered that I consi∣der
it as a national one, as I cannot admit
a distinction between the profit of the far∣mer
and that of the nation, each depend∣ing
so intimately on the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>SECTION II. That the large farmers retaining their corn;
under the present laws, is beneficial to the
nation.</HEAD>
<P>THE general outcry which has been
made against the great farmer, for
keeping his corn from market, has not failed
to inflame the minds of almost all ranks of
people. The arguments made use of have
been plausible, and could not but have
weight with those among us who are neither
acquainted with husbandry, the nature of
markets, nor the corn laws. It is the lan∣guage
of men compassionating the miserable
state of the distressed Poor, and conse∣quently
one of those popular topics which
must affect the religious good man. But
when we come coolly to examine the state
of our husbandry, markets, and corn laws,
and who are the present purchasers of corn,
we shall perhaps find, that it is a most
happy circumstance for this nation, that
there are a sett of wealthy farmers who
have it in their power to retain a part of
their growth in those natural and best of
granaries, their ricks. Was it otherwise, as
the corn laws now stand, we might often,
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
even with a most plentiful harvest, be in the
utmost danger of famine.</P>
<P>The argument made use of is, that the
little farmer is, through necessity, obliged
to thresh out his corn and bring it to market;
but that the opulent man will not produce
his, until it comes to a certain price. The
first fact I will allow; for true it is, that the
little farmer is obliged to bring his corn to
market before Christmas, to enable him to
pay his rent; and therefore it is at that
time that corn is cheapest: but what is the
consequence? Their little portion is soon
gone, and you have no reliance but on the
ricks of the great farmer to afford you a
regular supply. Had their corn likewise
been threshed out and brought to market,
what would have been the consequence? the
Poor could not have consumed it; but it
would have been cheap, and so cheap, that
Bear-Key, which is esteemed the barometer
of our produce, would have pronounced
corn plenty this year, at a time, when, I
am confident, England had the greatest
reason to dread a scarcity; and, in this case,
your corn might have been exported, per∣haps
with a bounty, without a possibility of
receiving a single grain back again. What
would then have become of your Poor at
Midsummer? This is a real fact, and lucky
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
it is for us at present, that either the great
farmers wilfully retain, or by some other
circumstances have it not in their power to
send corn to market in such quantities as
would gratify the spleen of ignorant, dis∣contented
people: for my own part, I am
apt to suspect that some have not in their
power to do it: for I will confess that there
is in some instances an evil attending great
farms, which is, where landlords, when
they lay many small farms together, destroy
barns to avoid the expence of repairs. Thus
the want of threshing-floors, added to the
bad yield of the crop, may, in some places,
prevent the great farmer's sending to market
what he would otherwise do. Some there
may be, who greedy of gain, may wait a
higher market; but they as often outstand
it. Wheat is now near 15<HI>l.</HI> per load: do not
imagine that farmers in general are not con∣tent
with such a price. The fair trader in
London would be satisfied with such a profit:
yet there are scheming speculators who ruin
themselves and their neighbours. So it is
with farmers. They are men like your∣selves;
and let them stand on the same
ground, for their occupation is full as
honourable, and infinitely more beneficial
to a nation. In plentiful years they must
sell cheap: let them then, when they have
scanty crops, have a price equal to the loss
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
in their quantity; treat them as you would
be done by, and cease such illiberal abuses
against men who deserve every encourage∣ment,
and who should be considered by a
wise nation as it's bulwark and the source
of it's riches. Let these declaimers point
me out a number of merchants, who, at
the approach of a war, when a heavy in∣crease
of taxes is to be laid on the Poor,
would not monopolize hemp, though the
enhancing its price to government must ne∣cessarily
add to the weight already laid on
the Poor? How few are there who will not
engross a commodity necessary for the ma∣nufacturer,
and thereby render the national
advantage of exporting his labours abor∣tive,
by raising the price so that we cannot
fell upon an equal footing with our neigh∣bours?
How very few are there, who, in
the greatest dearth at home, will not export
our beef and corn, if they can do it to ad∣vantage?
But if the farmer retains his corn
but a day, applications are made to parlia∣ment,
to force it if possible out of his barn.
Let these declaimers, among whom there
are many who, to get money, will think
no scheme too wild, turn their hands to the
plough, and see what plenty they will pro∣duce
to their families. They will, I suspect,
though too late, discover that more inge∣nuity
is requisite in that, than in fabricating
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
a bill upon the Royal-Exchange, and that
close attention and hard labour are the price
of the comforts which the farmer enjoys.</P>
<P>This subject has also been illustrated by
the Author of the Considerations on the
Exportation of Corn.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the different supply of markets from large
or small farms, in regard to pigs, poultry,
butter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER national evil which has
been pointed out as proceeding from
the present custom of monopolizing land,
is the want of that supply of pigs, poultry,
butter, and eggs, with which markets were
so well stocked by little farmers, and which
greatly tended to lower the price of other
provisions. In answer to the two first of
these articles, I shall briefly observe, that
they are not objects worthy the attention of
the legislature; for few will conceive that
dainties should be brought to market to
reduce the average price of provisions: but
was it otherwise, I will say, that no small
farmer can raise pigs and fowls in the same
district at so low a price as butcher's meat,
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
no more than he can afford to sell veal and
lamb at the same price as beef and mutton;
and therefore, especially, when provisions
are dear, it is better that such delicacies be
kept from market, and that what they cost
in cramming, be expended in rearing up
live stock.</P>
<P>But as some may differ with me in
opinion, I shall inform such, that it is not
the little farmer who can rear either to ad∣vantage.
If he is a suckler, not one drop
of milk can be spared to the sow which is
to fatten her pigs, and if he has only one
cow for the use of his family, the milk will
be more advantageously consumed among
them than in his stye: farther, unless he
has constant threshing going on, that the
pigs and poultry may always have to pick
up the corn which is left in the straw thrown
out at the barn door, he will find that they
will want the many handfuls of corn thrown
to them, which are never taken account of,
and not missed, because they are taken from
the great heap, but which, if measured out
to the good housewife, whose perquisite
they are, would startle her at the end of
the year. So thoroughly is a neighbour of
mine satisfied of the truth of this, that he
is determined never to rear another pig;
convinced that he can buy store pigs to put
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
up for fattening, cheaper than he can rear
them; being well assured that they do not
cost him less than 8<HI>d.</HI> per pound before they
are put up: much less will he be able to
sell a sucking pig at the price of butcher's
meat. Those who are acquainted with the
fattening of suckling animals, know the
truth of what I say.</P>
<P>It is only the cottager and large farmer
who can rear them to advantage; the first,
by letting a sow with her litter of pigs run
in the lanes, or rather, under that pretence,
in the fields and meadows of the neigh∣bouring
farmers. Yet this cannot be deemed
a national benefit. The only person who
can rear pigs to real advantage, is the far∣mer
who sows fields of clover purposely for
their use, (but this must be at a distance
from large towns, where hay does not fetch
an extraordinary price) or the dairy-man
who makes butter and cheese. These are
likewise the only people who can supply us
with butter at a reasonable rate, and that by
dint of capital and close attention to that
one article: nor are these men seated on
what are called arable farms.</P>
<P>Here I will inform my opponents of a
practice they are probably not acquainted
with, which is, that in Denbighshire and
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
Flintshire, it is no uncommon thing to see
hundreds of pigs, for which they grow
clover on purpose, and which graze on the
grass lands adjoining the beach, and when
the tide is out, they go down and feed on
the sea ooze, where they find shell-fish, &amp;c.
These pigs are as regularly folded at night
as sheep. They are bought up by the dis∣tillers,
&amp;c. By this means pigs, or what
is more proper for the farm, pork, is reared
to most advantage. The person from whom
I had this information, and who has been
long a dealer in hogs, assures me of this fact;
and that it is not uncommon to see five
thousand in one market; and he confirmed
to me what I have advanced, that it is the
great farmer only who can rear them to
advantage, and that by this practice.</P>
<P>As to eggs, they may indeed, at particu∣lar
times of the year, have been brought to
market by the small farmer: the same may
also be done by the cottager's wife, not
that it is such a supply as will answer the
purpose. It is the quantity which comes
from Scotland, and other cheap countries,
that can affect the market.</P>
<P>With regard to fowls, it is a known fact
that it is the great farmers who chiefly
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
supply markets with them; for they only
can do it to advantage.</P>
<P>One Shallcroft, who had a farm of 400
acres, and who lately died worth 10,000<HI>l.</HI>
supplied Croydon market with fowls; and
what is remarkable is, that it is chiefly the
great farmers who have supplied that
market with poultry and butter for many
years past, and their wives have attended
that market as regularly as the farmers did
the corn market. That of butter cannot
be doubted; and the other is as evident to
those who are the least conversant in the
matter. The threshing-floor of the great
farmer is always open, and it is the corn
thrown out in the straw that fattens the
barn-door fowl; whereas the little farmer,
whose threshing-floor is not constantly em∣ployed,
must at times feed them, and the
wife, whose perquisite they are, will not let
them starve while there is a grain of corn
in the heap. If this is the case at Croydon,
which is so near London, and from whence
so much straw is carried to support the
London market with all this grain in it,
which would be picked out of the straw by
pigs and fowls; how strong a proof is it,
that the markets, at a distance from great
towns, must be more easily supplied with
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
fowls in the neighbourhood of large farms,
than where they are all small ones?</P>
<P>I am almost ashamed to have given a
place to these answers; but the loss of pigs,
poultry, butter, and eggs, has been so ge∣neral
a topic in all companies, and in every
pamphlet which has appeared, that, insig∣nificant
as the subject is, I could not avoid
exposing the fallacy of the arguments
made use of on this occasion.</P>
<P>Let me now, in my turn, ask, Who is
it that supplies our markets with beef and
mutton? It is the great and opulent
farmer. Who is it that furnishes the Poor
with cheese, and such butter as they ought
to eat, good potted Cambridge butter? It
is the great dairy men.—But among the
various lamentable complaints with which
we have been pestered, I have not heard a
syllable of the want of veal or lamb; No!
there is plenty of them. Let these de∣claimers,
if they really feel, as they pretend
to do, for the Poor, blush at the sight of
it on their table. This is one of the real
causes of the high price of meat. When a
calf or a lamb can be made to fetch as
much at three months old, as they would
be worth when a steer or wether at two
years old in the ordinary method of feed∣ing
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
stock, this may sometimes become a
real evil; but not the want of other lux∣uries
of the same kind.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Of population, as affected by large or small
farms.</HEAD>
<P>THE last charge against the great far∣mer,
or, as he is called, the mono∣polizer
of land, is depopulation. The
absurdity of the assertion has often amazed
me: but what makes, it more ridiculous,
is, that the same writer who tells us there
is apprehension of famine, laments that
there are not more mouths to eat the little
we have. When indeed I consider that the
quickness of the conveyance in post-chaises
has induced many gentlemen to travel for
their amusement, who, quitting London,
where perhaps they were bred in a crowd,
are struck with the utmost astonishment at
the vast size of Salisbury Plain, without a
house in view, and wonder how agricul∣ture
is carried on upon the Dorsetshire
Downs by some scattered shepherds with
their flocks, or in the grazing countries,
where they see nothing but fat oxen and
a few scattered houses, I am not surprized
that the country has made such an impres∣sion
on them: but were they to visit the
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
manufacturing towns which border on those
tracts, they would perhaps return with far
different ideas. To these, I should not
think it worth the while to give any an∣swer:
but when I hear gentlemen who
pretend to some knowledge in agriculture
assert, that the holding large tracts of arable
land is the cause of depopulation, I can no
longer be silent. I have, indeed, fre∣quently
intended to give my opinion on
this very interesting subject, and am now
the more particularly induced so to do, as
I mean to avail myself of the very argu∣ments
made use of in a pamphlet lately
published, under the title of, <HI>Uniting and
monopolizing Farms plainly proved disad∣vantageous
to the Land-owner, and highly
prejudicial to the public;</HI> so perfectly do
they agree with those I had before laid
down to enforce the very contrary opi∣nion.</P>
<P>The writer of that pamphlet supposes,
as I would, a tract of land of eight hun∣dred
acres, or 400<HI>l. per ann.</HI> in the occu∣pation
of one man, and a like quantity in
the occupation of eight men. The only
circumstance in which I shall differ from
him in his calculation is the number of
servants in general, and the proportion of
them that are kept in the house: My esti∣mate
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
will be from my own knowledge,
corroborated by the intelligence I have
picked up on that subject in the different
counties through which I have passed.
But as the alteration I shall make in the
number and distribution of the servants
will rather make for this author's argu∣ment,
he certainly can have no objection
to it.</P>
<P>He sets out with saying, that if the tract
is in the hands of one man, his family
will consist of himself, a wife, three chil∣dren,
twelve servants, and ten labourers,
each with a wife and three children; in
all fifty.

<P>Then, on each of the eight small farms,
he supposes the farmer, his wife, and three
children, and two servants, that is, seven
in each family; and that each farm should
have a labourer, with five persons in each
labourer's family. In this case, the num∣ber
of persons depending on these lands
thus divided into eight separate farms will
stand thus;

<P>Thus there are 29 persons more depen∣dant

will be as follows, supposing the tract divi∣ded
into eight farms.</P>

Now it is reasonable to allow the same
number of labourers on the tract in the
possession of one man, as there is on the
eight farms: but whether it is allowed or
not, I know that there is the same number
of hands employed, though perhaps more

I shall take no notice of them,
supposing them to be better employed
in weeding and picking up stones, than
in scrubbing and dressing victuals for
the single men on the small farms. I
will therefore throw them into the
number of cottagers wives, supposing
some of these to be dead: but surely I
have a right to claim seven men for
the seven supernumerary farmers; and
their work ought to be reckoned as
something; consequently their labour
allowed on the large tract in the occu∣pation
of one man; or else they must
be considered as useless bailiffs, and
consequently as an incumbrance on the
estate. However, as this author lays so
much stress upon the labour of the small
farmer, we will admit them on this
farm; and, supposing them likewise

<P>I have taken this mode of calculating the
inhabitants from the Author's own plan:
but allowing the seven supernumerary mar∣ried
men to be single, and deducting for
their wives and children 28, there would
remain 114, among whom there would be
20 married men instead of only 16 on the
8 small farms. Had this Author stated the
fact otherwise, and made the comparison on
pasture land, I should have agreed with
him: but on arable land, nothing is more
contrary to the fact than what he lays down.
Now we have each of us told our tale, and
the fact only must determine who is right.
At all events, I would advise gentlemen to
make very strict inquiry into the truth of
the matter before they suffer themselves to
be led away by every publication that ap∣pears.
I will acknowledge, that there is a
management of land which may tend to
diminish the number of people in that par∣ticular
parish where it is practised; it is
indeed what rarely happens in old farms,
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
but it may be an attendant on some of the
new-inclosed common-field land, where,
perhaps at the instigation of the landlord,
too great a proportion is laid down to grass.
A sensible tenant will be glad to meet with
old meadow; but few, I believe, will court
new pastures, since the introduction of
clovers, &amp;c. I will likewise say, that there
are circumstances when it may be prudent
for both tenant and landlord. For example;
suppose common-field land on a moory soil,
best adapted to pasture land, and which
with good management will, in a very few
years, become equal to the best: or suppose
chalky land, excellently well adapted to
sainfoin, but by the barbarous custom of
common-field tenure, rendered almost use∣less
to the tenant. Are those tenants who
sensibly pay higher rent for such land when
inclosed, to be precluded the liberty of con∣verting
it to what it ought to be, merely to
gratify the whim of a few theoretical
farmers; or should the nation be deprived
of the increased produce, by its not being
put under proper culture? and yet, if this
is done to a great extent, it must diminish
the labour, and consequently drive away
some of the inhabitants. But where do
these gentlemen-writers think they are gone
to? Perhaps to other spots, which once
were poor stinted commons, but now are
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
covered with sheaves of corn, instead of the
few starved sheep which were maintained
there in the summer, for the winter food of
crows and ravens. It is indeed certain,
that large tracts of pasture land must keep a
district thin of inhabitants: it could not well
be otherwise, when, as formerly, grass and
hay were the only method of fattening
bullocks: nor was that a branch which used
to be carried on by the little or middling
farmer: it was done by people of capi∣tal;
and to turn it to the most advantage,
or indeed to employ their capital, large
tracts of land were necessary. It is, and
must continue to be, the same in breeding
countries; and on the downs, where our
flocks are bred, large tracts are requisite for
a sheep-walk. Best maiden down will not
carry above two sheep per acre to fold,
without clover or good meadow to bait
them on: but let it not be imagined that
this is waste; these little animals doubly
earn their value before they come to market,
by their fleeces, and by the many adjoin∣ing
acres which they manure; and on this
account it is, that in these and such-like
spots, large farms are indispensably neces∣sary:
and the advantage of a large fold is
so well known, that in parts of Wiltshire
where there are small farms which have but
small flocks, it is a common practice to
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
throw them into one fold, each man having
them for as many nights as are equal to the
proportion of his flock: nor indeed do I
know any tract of country where excessive
large farms, such as have been alluded to,
prevail, but in downy countries, where
sheep-walk is so necessary, and where often
many acres are rented for a few shillings,
Norfolk and Effex farms excepted: but in
Norfolk I hope our author will not say the
country has been depopulated by large
farms, for by the sensible and spirited cul∣ture
of the inhabitants of that country,
nobly inspired by Lord Townshend, who
quitted the office of Secretary of State to
become the useful husbandman, they have
converted a barren sand into the most fertile
spot in England. View their fields of tur∣nips,
barley, clover, wheat, and shew me
such management in a country inhabited by
little farmers. But how have they done it?
by industry, and a sensible attention to their
business; by the landlords sensibly dividing
the country among opulent men, who, by
dint of capital, were able to cover their soil
with clay or marle at the expence of the
then fee-simple of the land, and not by
becoming indolent, because they grew opu∣lent:
and I will say, that it redounds much to
the honour of those landed proprietors, that
they suffered the sons to enjoy the fruits of
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
the labours of their fathers: not but that
their rents are now properly increased.</P>
<P>This leads me necessarily to hint at an∣other
observation of the author I allude to,
who seems to lay so great a stress on the
national advantage of increased rents, and
of the old method of calculating the profits
of the farmer by the three rents. In the
infancy of agriculture, it was a conscien∣tious
and equal partition of property; such
as is now practised in the less enlightened
parts of the world; in most parts of France,
Germany, and in some of our American
colonies: the one finds land and capital,
the other knowledge and labour: but on a
well-cultivated and good soil, the rent is
now the least object: it is the sum which a
man can sink in stock, and in the annual
expence of his labour, on which he is to
reckon the interest of his money, or income.
—The subject has already led me beyond
the intended limits of this Chapter: but in
answering the author of the above-quoted
Pamphlet, on the topic of depopulation, I
was naturally led to point out some other
circumstances in large farms, in which he
seemed to be equally misinformed.</P>
<P>Let it not, however, be thought that I
am so absurd as to propose that all England
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
should be divided into large, or indeed any
particular-sized farms. I have only endea∣voured
to refute the absurd doctrine of those
who maintain that large farms have brought
on a ruin to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion and that the only
remedy is to divide the land into small
farms. I say that there should be, as there
are now, farms of all sizes, to suit the dif∣ferent
capitals of the people who engage in
farming. If such writers as I am speaking
of were at all conversant in husbandry, they
would know, as I have already explained,
that the proportion of land, which is in
some degree governed by its value, should
be equal to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capital; and if they
were acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ words" DISP="〈◊…〉"/> nature of the most
valuable trade of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion, they would con∣sider
agriculture in this country to be the
first object of commerce, and therefore they
would see that it is as absurd to confine a
farmer with 10,000<HI>l.</HI> to one hundred acres,
as to place a man with 500<HI>l.</HI> on one thou∣sand
acres. To say that a man, who, by
industry, has increased his capital in farm∣ing,
shall cease to be a farmer, is as great a
contradiction to common sense; for such
prohibition it would be, not to permit a
man to employ his capital in the business he
has been brought up to and understands.
Whatever may be the opinion of these gen∣tlemen,
I will maintain, that the produce
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
of the earth is the only wealth of a
nation: if corn is our natural produce,
corn should be our trade, as gold is that of
Peru; and perhaps it is the only trade that
cannot be over-done: we do not want in∣stances
to prove, that artificial trade is often
extended to the ruin of a nation: that
cannot be the case with the produce of the
earth: manufactures have a limited con∣sumption;
besides which, that nation which
will not wear your cloth, will eat your
corn. Let this manufacture then go on in its
usual course: it is in the hands of men who
understand it better than you do, and, be∣lieve
me, their own interest will tell them
what is most proper to be done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. On Jobbers, Forestallers, and Regrators.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many who have assigned
causes for the present advanced price
of provisions, there are a set of men who
do not attribute the scarcity to either of the
aforementioned causes, nor do they confine
their compassion to the Poor only, but ex∣tend
their pity even to the farmer. Their
complaints are poured out against jobbers,
forestallers, and regrators; though I am
confident that many of them do not under∣stand
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
the particular occupation of either of
these, but confound the whole in one mass.
I confess that there are many instances in
the sale of cattle at Smithfield, which must
confirm these people in their opinion: a
very recent and remarkable one happened
on the 16th of November last, when oxen sold
at 2 <HI>d.</HI> per pound; and yet there was no
visible alteration in the price of butcher's
meat. This would naturally induce them
to believe that there is plenty, but that it is
withheld by art. It must, likewise, be ob∣served,
that sheep were dearer that very
day, than had been known for some time
past. However, as tales are told imper∣fectly,
and too often that part of them only
which makes for an argument, I am not
surprized that well-disposed men are fre∣quently
misled. I shall not say but that
there may be, and is, craft in that business, as
there must be in every other where the least
restriction will always give the attentive
artful man an advantage over his neighbour:
at the same time, it must be conceived, that
there is in this, as in all other articles, a
fluctuation in the price: nor will it be diffi∣cult
to explain that this fluctuation must
operate by greater strides in live cattle, than
in any commodity which can be deposited
in magazines. All that the wisdom of
legislature can do, or ought to attempt, is,
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
to let those streams of plenty flow from
their source in their natural channel; for
the dam that occasions still-water above, is
sure to create a torrent below, which carries
every thing before it.</P>
<P>To investigate the truth of what is here
advanced, I shall explain the natural causes
of this fluctuation in the price of live cattle:
this will account for the sudden fall of beef
on the day abovementioned, and prove that
it neither could have, nor ought to have,
any great effect on the price of butcher's
meat: I shall then proceed to point out the
channel in which the supply of live cattle
used to flow, till it met with a check,
which, I believe, has given some foundation
for a part of the complaints we have heard.
In doing this, I shall describe the different
occupation of each man concerned in this
traffick; and from thence it will appear,
that the abolishing of either must eternally
produce the evil complained of.</P>
<P>First then, I shall inform the Reader,
that the fluctuation in the price of live stock
does, and ever must, depend on the quan∣tity
there is of the different sorts of food
necessary to support those cattle in their dif∣ferent
stages of age and degree of fatness.
For example; if after-pasture, fodder and
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
turnips fail, lean stock must be cheap, be∣cause
there will not be purchasers for them
at the fairs; and fat beasts will, for the
same reason, keep their price, because the
grazier knows it will turn to better account
for him to bestow the food he has upon the
stock which is nearly fit for market, than
to divide it among many, which would
keep the forward ones too back; nor would
it bring the lean stock forward enough to
make off in the spring with any moderate
degree of profit. Thus he will consume
the whole with his fattening beasts, by
which means there will not be a succession
to supply the market, and those beasts
which would have come in the spring, must
be kept lean, to another year. This cir∣cumstance,
and the scarcity of food, which
will not allow him to have so great a stock
to employ his capital in, must naturally,
and ought to give him a greater profit on
the few he has. Thus will the course of
market generally be governed; and I believe
it was as generally expected that what I
have related would have been the case this
year; for there was in the summer little
appearance of grass, fodder was evidently
scarce, and cabbages and turnips had failed
almost every where: but a most providen∣tially
fine autumn furnished the Essex and
Kentish men with such abundance of after∣pasture,
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
that they gave great prices for all
cattle that were forward enough to be
brought on. This naturally induced them
to make off all their stock on hand that was
fit, or nearly fit, for market, in order that
their new stock might have sufficient plenty
to push them on before the winter set in,
when they could be able to finish them on
oil-cake, &amp;c. To this I impute the great
and unexpected glut that there was at
Smithfield on the Monday alluded to; and
what strengthens me in my opinion is, that it
was immediately after Kingston-Fair, where
a great number of Welch beasts were bought
up by the Essex and Kentish farmers. The
present high price of hay and oil-cakes
might indeed have operated in some degree,
by inducing many graziers to send up such
of their beasts as were fit for market, rather
than keep them back for the regular supply:
but as it is not natural to suppose that this
last reason should have operated with all on
the same day, I cannot but think my sug∣gestion
right; and what confirms me in it
is, that sheep were dearer that very day
than they had been for some time past.
This last circumstance is one reason why this
extraordinary fall in beef should not have
had an immediate effect on the price of
butcher's meat: for it is the average of the
profits which must govern the butcher in his
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
sale. But supposing mutton had been equally
cheap, no butcher in London would have
purchased more than was necessary for the
demand of his usual customers: he could
neither keep his beasts nor his sheep alive;
and if he slaughtered them, he ran the risk of
having a great part remain to spoil on his
hands. Thus the overplus of what was
wanted for the usual consumption, would be
naturally bought up by those who had an op∣portunity
of keeping them on; and was it not
for such men, from whence should we now
expect a regular supply, till those beasts are
brought forward, which are not yet fit for
market? Let it not, however, be imagined
that all their dealings are attended with
such profit; they have severe blows, as well
as men in other trades: it is the average
profit of the whole year on which they
count their gain; and however it may be
the fashion to stigmatise these dealers with
odious appellations, it is on them alone that
we can depend for a regular supply. Yet,
whilst I am thus speaking in favour of these
dealers, I will confess that I believe there
are among them some who, as the laws
have lately been enforced, have given too
great foundation for the clamours of the
people; I mean, when the salesman is the
dealer. I know that precautions have been
taken to guard against this inconvenience,
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
by prohibiting them from holding farms:
but it is easy to conceive that such a law
may be evaded: and I know that it is; and
though it be a crime to act in violation of
the laws, yet that crime is greatly lessened,
if the enactors of the laws lay temptations
in the way, to induce people to act in op∣position
thereto: and this they have done,
by abolishing what were called Jobbers;
the evil consequences of which I shall pro∣ceed
to explain.</P>
<P>When there were those traders in cattle
called Jobbers, Smithfield market was con∣stantly
and well supplied. They were
people who had no fixed residence, but tra∣velled
the country in search of such cattle
as were fit for market; and having no land
in their own possession, as soon as they had
bought a lot of sheep, or oxen, they im∣mediately
dispatched them to Smithfield∣market,
where they were consequently
obliged to be sold. If several of these hap∣pened
to meet at the same market, which
was frequently the case, of course their
cattle were sold cheap; but they were con∣tented
with their chance profit; and set out
immediately on another journey. If the
cattle were ever so cheap, the butchers could
not buy more than for their usual con∣sumption.
This necessarily called in a set
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
of men who had land within a moderate
distance of the metropolis, and thereby had
an opportunity of keeping them on, to
supply the market regularly. These men
naturally should have their profit: but that
could not, in general, be great, as they
were always liable to have great quantities
poured in unexpectedly by the jobbers,
whose motions were never known, and al∣ways
uncertain. Thus were the markets
always fully stocked; the grazier got rid of
his cattle, at his door, without trouble or
expence; and the butcher was always sure
of finding a market well supplied by the
jobber, or the intermediate man who had
always by him a stock that had been pur∣chased
when the markets were glutted.
This was a regular channel of trade, which
went on uninterrupted: whereas, when the
jobbers were suppressed, the grazier was
obliged either to send up his cattle himself,
or to commit them to the care of a salesman,
who, of course, became his adviser when
to send his stock to market; and by this
means, being intimately acquainted with
the demand and the supply, it is natural to
believe that self-interest, which governs us
all, would induce him to become a purchaser,
who had it so much in his power to supply
the butchers as he thought proper, and who,
by the same knowledge, had it as much in
his power to purchase his cattle at what
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
price he pleased to set on them: for it re∣quired
but the combination of a few, to
order up the grazier's cattle whenever they
wished to make a purchase. In this manner
has the profit of the latter decreased so
much, as to render it necessary for some
of them to attend Smithfield themselves,
though, when they came there, they could
only look on; not having it in their power
to sell to a butcher, who was perhaps as
much in the clutches of the salesman as
himself. By this means we have lost that
intermediate man, so necessary to all parties,
and by this means we have created a real
forestaller. I will not charge all with being
guilty of this practice: there are honest
men, as well as knaves, in every profession.
I have only endeavoured to point out the
manner in which this may operate; and I
am confident that it will, whenever there is
the smallest restriction or interference of
legislature in any trade; for, as Sir Wil∣liam
Mildmay justly observes, a general
liberty granted to raise our necessary pro∣visions,
will procure us a general plenty for
sale; a general indulgence allowed to this
sale, will reduce them to a general cheap∣ness,
&amp;c. Happy am I to think we have a
Minister, whose wisdom has induced him to
listen to such men as can give him real in∣formation
on a subject he cannot be supposed
to be intimately acquainted with himself!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. On Luxury, as affecting Provisions and
Population.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many writers who have
favoured us with their productions on
the subject of Provisions and Population,
there are none who fail to attribute it, in
part or the whole, to Luxury. I shall not
attempt to say that Luxury has not an
effect on the price of all commodities;
among others, on provisions: but how far
it is prejudicial or beneficial to a state, is
matter of serious consideration, and should
be handled with infinite delicacy whenever
the subject is taken up by the Legislature.
It is a known fact, that, in an infant-state,
Luxury is a child which should be nou∣rished
to such a degree as to procure the
conveniencies and comforts of life; for on
that depends the improvement of agricul∣ture,
arts, manufactures, and commerce.
It is as certain a fact, that Luxury is an
attendant on wealth, and that, when it is
not accompanied with vice, it is a benefit
to a nation. By this it is that wealth be∣comes
more equally diffused among all
ranks of people: it encourages the manu∣facturer
and artificer; and if it is confined
to the table of the rich man, agriculture
reaps the benefit of it, without any public
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
detriment: in short, in every instance, the
poor receive their share of this scattered
wealth; and in proportion to the luxury
of the spot, the poor who inhabit are, by
the diffused riches, enabled to bear their
share in the price of provisions. In proof
of what I say, draw the comparison between
the labouring poor of the city of London
and its neighbourhood, with those of Wales
and other remote countries. I do not speak
of the worthless abandoned poor: they
always flock to large cities, and subsist by
charity and theft, where they are not so
easily detected as in the country. This
leads me to point out a species of luxury
which I have never heard arraigned, but
which, I am confident, does much mis∣chief,
though proceeding from a laudable
motive: I mean, that unbounded charity
which, when kept within limits, and ad∣ministred
with prudence, is the noble cha∣racteristic
of the English nation; but which
I have known, in many instances, to do
much hurt, and encourage idleness, instead
of rewarding industry. I say, this evil pro∣ceeds
from luxury, because I fear an osten∣tatious
vanity is frequently the motive for
many whimfical donations.</P>
<P>Why Luxury should be an attendant on
wealth is obvious; it is, becaufe money be∣comes
cheap: but in such proportion all
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
commodities rise in value. In 1307, when
the interest of money was 45 <HI>per cent.</HI> all
provisions were what we should now call
cheap. In 1604, when the interest of mo∣ney
was 9<HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s. per cent.</HI> provisions rose
in proportion; and so on to this day, mak∣ing
proper allowance for the different cir∣cumstances
which attended this country
when divided by civil wars, or harrassed by
foreign enemies. But as luxury is the
constant attendant on wealth, it must natu∣rally
affect provisions in a greater propor∣tion;
for it will create waste; it induces
people of fortune to keep a great number
of domestic servants, who are fed on dain∣ties,
instead of the coarse but wholesome
food they were before accustomed to; it
increases the number of horses which are
kept for pleasure; both which must consi∣derably
increase the consumption of meat
and corn. It likewise certainly affects pro∣visions,
by the destruction of the number∣less
calves and lambs that are slaughtered
for the London market, which must raise
the price of beef and mutton, as they
consume in three months the amount in
value of food which would rear them, to
two years old. This is, indeed, an encou∣ragement
to agriculture, and, as I said
before, disperses the wealth among all ranks
and denominations of people, while the
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
taxes on luxury properly fall upon the rich,
and the land is so far relieved of a part of
that burthen which must be chearfully
borne for the support of a great and power∣ful
nation, I mean that part of the taxes
which, lights on the consumer, which is all
exciseable commodities. It will here be
said, that the waste on the rich man's table,
and the corn consumed by his horses, would
feed many hungry mouths. I allow it:—
but the evil points out a remedy; for if it
is the real fact, as I believe it to be, that
the consumption is greater than the pro∣duce,
cultivate more land, and suffer not
barren acres to stare us in the face when
we are crying out for bread.</P>
<P>There is yet another species of Luxury,
which is in consequence of wealth; it is, that
the inhabitants of the country naturally flock
to great cities, where they can enjoy the more
refined amusements of a polished nation.
The conveniency of trade indeed brings
thither the most considerable part; the
necessary calling together of the Legisla∣ture
brings another part; and the attach∣ment
to courts and other amusements,
brings the third. These necessarily carry
with them a suite of attendants, which I
cannot but think mischievous to a state;
for the loitering life of a gentleman's ser∣vant
not only debauches his own mind,
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>
but, by his attendance on the great, and
his intercourse with the inferior class,
makes him the vehicle of conveyance of
those manners which ruin the industrious
tradesman, though necessary accomplish∣ments
in the rich. If they unfortunately
see a bad example, they retail it out with
all its mischievous consequences; and in
this manner does their appearance and ex∣ample
operate when they return with their
masters to the country. They there de∣bauch
the minds of the rustic labourers,
who envy their fine cloaths and lazy life;
and by this means too many of the inferior
class are drawn to towns, where, I must
confess, they do not continue to be such
useful members in point of population, as
if they had remained in the country; for
by all the calculations that have appeared,
the lives of children in towns bear no pro∣portion
with those born and bred up in the
country. This necessary evil, which at∣tends
all great cities, is the natural and
inevitable consequence of wealth. Let us
not, however, see things in so gloomy a
light, as to think these people entirely lost
to society, or even to that part which de∣pends
on agriculture. What I am going
to relate is matter of fact within my own
knowledge; namely, that in hay and har∣vest
time, when labourers are wanted in
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
the country, it is inconceivable what num∣bers
of tradesmen and handicrafts flock into
the country, and as considerable is the
assistance we receive from them at the only
time they are wanted there. Thus they
become doubly beneficial to the nation.
The fact is as I say, but their motives may
be two-fold; the one, that they have not
employment at that time of the year; and
the other, that nature may dictate to them
the desire of breathing the fresh air they
were accustomed to in their youth, when
they learnt the different branches of hus∣bandry
business, which they return to at a
time when their town employment falls
slack, and when, as I said before, we only
want them.</P>
<P>I am far from being an advocate for
wanton Luxury. There have been too
many instances in history, to prove that
Luxury, accompanied with vice, which is
its last stage, must ever end in ruin to a
state. All that I mean to alledge is, that
Luxury will attend the wealth of a great
trading nation, and that what was once a
virtue, cannot be converted into a vice. Let
those who exclaim against the evil effects
of Luxury, keep a watchful eye over them∣selves,
and they will not have cause to
complain.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56"/>
Let those who reside in the country set a
good example to the poor inhabitants of
the village; let those who have it in their
power diminish, if possible, at least not
increase, the number of alehouses, which
are perdition to the poor, and the real
cause of their distress. I know many pa∣rishes
in different parts of the country
where labourers maintain themselves and
families comfortably, even in these times,
on six shillings a week; whereas in other
places they are starving on nine in winter,
and ten to twelve in summer. But where
the former reside, there are no alehouses,
and they themselves attribute their comfort
to it: however, where they cannot be easily
abolished, let the restrictive laws attending
licences be enforced; prevent gambling,
and do not suffer them to permit a labour∣ing
inhabitant of the parish to sit in their
houses but at the stated hours of meal times;
this every one has it in his power to pre∣vent;
and this I know to be one of the
chief causes of the distress of the poor, as
hath justly been remarked by the Reverend
Mr. Powel, of Fakenham, in his <HI>Real
Grievances,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. On the real causes of the advanced price of
provisions.</HEAD>
<P>THE real cause of the present scar∣city
being, in general, too well
known to need any formal discourse to
ascertain its origin, it may, perhaps, be
thought impertinent in me to undertake
that task: and, indeed, I honestly confess,
that the original intention of these sheets
was only to shew, that it is not to be im∣puted
solely to any of the various causes I
have lately seen assigned for it in print.
Most of those publications have appeared
to me big with mischief, as blowing the
trumpet of discontent among every rank
of people; and, howsoever inadvertently
they may have been suffered to creep into
the world, they cannot fail to breed, espe∣cially
among the lower class, that rancour
and jealousy which are the mother of riot
and confusion, and which may, if thus
fomented, carry them to such lengths as
may seriously increase the misfortunes we
complain of. My only motive for thus
offering to the public my opinion on this
head, proceeds from an ardent desire to
rectify, if I can, the strangely miscon∣ceived
notion of my countrymen, by prov∣ing
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
to them, that it is not to any indi∣vidual,
or set of individuals, that we
ought to ascribe this calamity; but that
it is the hand of God which has visited
us, and that it is patience only, with a
proper exertion of those means which Pro∣vidence
hath put in our power, that can
afford us relief. But as I find the number∣less
complaints of the dissatisfied have
reached the ear of the Legislature, and
that the Parliament seem earnestly disposed
to adopt such measures as shall appear to
them most salutary; I think it the duty of
every one who has considered this matter
candidly, to lay his thoughts open to
Government.</P>
<P>Previous to our entering upon this sub∣ject,
it will be necessary to examine into
the truth of what is daily asserted about
the price of provisions, and to determine
whether they are, or are not, really dear;
and, if found to be dear, how far the price
exceeds the bounds of what is deemed an
equitable one for the farmer. The only
method by which this fact can be ascer∣tained,
is to draw a comparison between
them and other articles of consumption; for
example, if the articles of cloaths, house∣rent,
furniture, luxuries of life, and pro∣visions,
have kept a nearly proportionate
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
advance for any given number of years,
we have the clearest proof that there is
some one general extraneous cause which
affects the whole; and if it appears that
the rise in the price of all the various com∣modities
bears a just proportion to the
interest of money, it is as self-evident that
the general cause is the riches of the nation:
but to fix this with such precision as would
carry with it universal conviction, would
require many <HI>data</HI> not easy to be obtained.
Thus, among other circumstances, to make
a just comparison, it will be necessary that
there should have been an equal demand
for every article; for on that will depend
the value of each. Now as I have de∣clared
that such <HI>data</HI> as I would only
draw conclusions from are, in my opi∣nion,
not to be obtained, I may claim
the same privilege as others assume, of
grounding my facts on the general cry,
that all the necessaries of life are at an
enormous price, which, as I said before,
must proceed from one general cause, and
that can only be the cheapness of money;
and therefore, that all commodities bearing
that proportion are cheap, at least not dear.
However, as an extraordinary demand for,
or a scarcity of any article, must affect
that article in a peculiar manner, I will
acknowledge that there is an advance in
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
the price of provisions, though not so great
as is generally believed, nor such as ought
to alarm this nation; nor will I scruple to
pronounce, that this advance has been oc∣casioned
by a real scarcity of corn, pro∣ceeding
from a failure of crops in gene∣ral;
and that, for these five years past, we
have had, at one or other time of the year,
the most unfavourable seasons for corn that
have been known for a long while past.
To this must be imputed the natural cause
of the dearness of all commodities, and
among them, of provisions.</P>
<P>It is the vast influx of wealth, which,
though the great encourager of agriculture,
brings with it an apparent temporary evil.
This is the mother of luxury, which as
certainly creates waste, and, by an extra∣ordinary
consumption, undoubtedly affects
the markets; as was clearly proved to the
House of Lords about nine years ago, in the
examination of a person who had gone
through all the various branches of the
butcher's business, and who attributed the
great rise in meat, in a great measure, to
the luxury of the town, saying, that the
tradesman who formerly was contented with
a shoulder of mutton, must now have his
fillet of veal, &amp;c. and by this luxury's
descending to the lowest class, there were
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
not those customers for the offal-pieces,
which were consequently in a manner
thrown away. This might be the opinion
of a single man; but certain it is, that the
consumption of veal and lamb has increased
to a prodigious degree; and, as I mentioned
before, the expence of the food necessary to
bring those young animals to market being
as much in four months as would maintain
them as a breeding stock for two years,
that must undoubtedly have an effect upon
all other butcher's meat, and this will as
surely affect other provisions, in a certain
proportion.</P>
<P>There is yet another manner in which
luxury has operated: it has increased the
number of post-horses within these twenty
years, as ten to one. The increase of
stage-coaches too has been very consider∣able,
as has likewise the number of wag∣gon-horses:
these last, indeed, have been
in consequence of internal trade: yet all
these are, directly or indirectly, in conse∣quence
of luxury, which has established so
many fashionable places of resort for people
of all ranks and denominations, and in
which list the city of London has furnished
no inconsiderable part; for money, which,
in a trading nation, puts all men on a level,
soon teaches the tradesman and his family
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
that they can associate with people of rank
and fashion: thus servants, mimicking their
masters and mistresses, as soon forget the
prudent oeconomy of the pantry and cellar,
and vye with my lord's butler and my
lady's woman in every wanton extrava∣gance,
which, fatal as it proves in the end,
does not at first displease the good sober
citizen: but this is the natural channel in
which riches ever will and ought to flow.
It is by these means that the wealth acquired
by the trading individual becomes equally
diffused among all ranks of men: it is ex∣tended
even to the chimney-sweeper's boy,
who, instead of the crust of bread which
used to be his fee, now receives a morsel of
meat: but at last, though too late, the
tradesman discovers that he and his family
have purchased a relish for pleasure and ex∣travagance
with a diminution of his capital.
He feels with redoubled force every little
blow in trade, because he dares not retrench,
from a misconstrued pride, and fear of in∣juring
his credit: he stretches every sinew
to extend that credit and increase his trade:
perhaps, at last, conscious that his own will
not support his extravagance, he flies to
that of his neighbour, who, at the same
moment, may be getting into his. Thus
has trade been over-done, and credit, so
essential for a commercial nation, totally
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
ruined. Stock-jobbing, and every species
of gambling, have succeeded, and have now
brought on a general bankruptcy among
those people who were once improperly
thought the chief support of this country.</P>
<P>But let not this picture deceive us. It
only proves what common sense ought
to have taught before, which is, that trade
can be extended but to a certain degree,
and that the only one which can be bene∣sicial
to a nation is the export of the produce
of the earth. Such part of it as can be
manufactured is undoubtedly doubly ad∣vantageous:
it maintains a number of men
who are the strength of a nation, whilst fo∣reigners,
who buy the manufactured goods,
pay their wages, which, in fact, becomes
an advanced price upon our corn and meat.
But as the demand for goods may be
limited, do not let us confine ourselves to
the growth of so much corn only as will
maintain them, let the surplus be exported,
and though not attended with so much
profit, it is always an addition to the other;
the returns for which, in merchandize or
specie, are our riches. Merchants, neces∣sary
as they are, are no more than the
carriers of those commodities: take them in
any other view, they are men preying upon
one another: one individual is enriched,
while the other is ruined; and whether the
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
trade is among ourselves, or with others, so
soon as it exceeds the bounds of our produce
and manufactures, it is gambling, and, as
in all other games of chance, at the end of
the year, the profits will only pay the cards.
But miserable as the present scene appears,
it by no means proves that the country is
not rich; it only shews how money may be,
and how it is, dispersed and divided among
all ranks, and I could prove, happily for this
nation, that much of it is sunk in the bowels
of the earth, from which grateful treasury
we are sure to receive ample returns. The
new cultivated lands, and improvements in
agriculture, with the great inland navi∣gations,
have swallowed up immense sums
in the purchase of corn to feed the labourers.
These are the real riches of a country. It
would be wrong to imagine, that because
some few individuals have over-traded them∣selves,
and want money, therefore the nation
is poor; look at the riches that are amassed
among the farmers, and bless yourselves
that it has got into the hands of men who
will turn it to a national benefit; while they
thrive, the interest of your funds will con∣tinue
low, and land will keep its price:
these are the only touchstones of the value
of money.</P>
<P>But before I quit this subject, let me
hint that I do not draw the distinction
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
between agriculture, manufactures and com∣merce;
I know them all to be so dependant
on each other, that the prevalence of either
is prejudicial to this nation: all I contend
for is, that the source of the whole is agri∣culture.</P>
<P>Those who attempt to point out the
distinct advantage arising from either agri∣culture,
manufactures, or commerce, are
little acquainted with the true policy of this
nation; for if they recollect that the natural
produce of this country consists in corn
for the use of man, and other staple com∣modities
for our manufactures, such as
hides, wool, tin, lead, and iron, they will
conceive that the labourers of the earth and
the manufacturers are so mutually dependent
one on the other, that to obtain the greatest
national advantage from their reciprocal
labours, would almost seem to demand that
a just proportionate number of each should
be preserved: I say, in point of the profit
to be made on the produce of the earth,
which is the natural riches of a country,
this would seem to be the case, with an ad∣ditional
number in agriculture to provide
food for their own body, and the third
class, which consists of the navy, army,
and idle people: but no advantage could
arise from such a distribution without the
assistance of traders, whose business it is to
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
export our manufactured staple commodi∣ties,
or the surplus of such as are not
required for the different manufactures in
their raw state: in return for these, the
trader brings us back either specie, or, by
way of barter, the luxuries of life, or raw
materials for some manufactures, which we
have not within ourselves, but are necessary
for them. In this manner are these three
classes so intimately dependant on each
other, that neither can exist alone in this
country, I mean to a national advantage;
nor in this view is it easy to determine to
which should be ascribed the preference in
point of rank: for unless we grew our own
corn, our manufactures would not be so be∣neficial
to the country, nor without manufac∣tures
would our corn be exported to so great
advantage; nor would either be nationally
advantageous in point of riches if they could
not be exported. This therefore calls in
the assistance of the merchant, whose trade
would not be beneficial to the nation unless
his exports consisted in the produce of the
earth; and in the proportion that such ex∣ports
exceed the value of his imports, the
balance is in favour of this country.</P>
<P>Let it however be observed, that the ad∣vantage
arising from this chain of traffic is
limited to a certain pitch, beyond which it
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
cannot extend: it must be governed by the
demand of foreign markets, which is al∣ways
regulated by the consumption, but
too often subject to the caprice of courts;
therefore it is impossible to determine the
exact proportion of hands proper to be al∣lotted
to each different class. It must then
remain an established maxim, that, as Sir
James Stuart has so ably shewn, each
class will, from time to time, be supplied
with the overflowings of the other, as exi∣gencies
direct: but it should be remembered,
that manufactories can at no time employ
more than are requisite at that particular
time to supply the demands of trade;
whereas the culture of the earth cannot
be over-done. If the quantity of corn and
cattle produced should, by being too great
for the consumption, reduce the price below
what is a reasonable profit for the farmer,
that cheapness will create mouths to eat it,
that is, men will flock in from different
countries to that spot where there is the
greatest plenty. This will make us formi∣dable
in point of people, and the taxes on
what they consume will increase the revenue,
so as to enable the Government to discharge
part of its debt, at least enable it to protect
its territories, without loading the Poor with
a fresh burden. This argument would rather
seemingly lead to give the preference to
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
agriculture: but I shall contend for no more
than to call it the spring of the whole machine.</P>
<P>In contradiction to what I have advanced,
I am aware that there are those who will say,
that the whole of my theory is disproved by
the instance of Holland. But let such re∣member,
that what I have said relates to the
policy of England only, and that though
Holland has subsisted and become powerful
by trade alone, it has been owing to the
very particular circumstances which have
attended the situation of the Dutch: they
established themselves in a little swampy
corner, hemmed in on all sides by enemies,
whose reciprocal interest it was to protect
them against each other: by this means
their little spot became an asylum for trade
to all parties, and thus they became like∣wise
the carriers and bankers of Europe,
and by these concomitant circumstances,
art has supplied them with what nature
furnishes us.</P>
<P>But to return to the subject of horses,
which, I am confident, have helped to
raise the price of provisions, for they must
consume a great part of the produce of
the earth, and in a much greater proportion
than other cattle, which are not fed so
highly. Therefore, unless it appears that
the importation of oats during these last
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
twenty years has greatly increased, it is
evident that either the quantity of other corn
grown, has decreased, or that more ground
has been cultivated, and as certain that
unless the quantity of grass land has increased
in the same degree, there cannot remain the
same proportion for the feeding of young
steers, as there was before the breeding of
these additional horses. With regard to the
number that have been exported, as much
as it has been exclaimed against, surely no
man who considers the matter coolly can
see it in any other light than as being
greatly beneficial to the nation; for whether
we export the corn, or the cattle that feed
on it, the money received is for the produce
of the earth.</P>
<P>We all know that more land has been
taken into culture, and that the inclosing of
common-field land has increased the pro∣duce:
but, I am apt to believe, not in a
proportion equal to the consumption; and
I am farther of opinion, that a greater part
has been devoted to the growth of food
for horses: for the extraordinary rise in the
price of oats within these twenty years past,
in which that grain has exceeded all pro∣portion
with other corn, and the uniform
and steady price oats have kept at, are such
inducements to a farmer, that it is scarcely
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
possible to believe he would not attend to
the growth of that species of corn, as well
as, in the breeding countries, to the raising
of colts instead of steers: for a serviceable
colt, at three years old, with the assistance
of a few pecks of ground meal, will fetch
as much as an ox at seven, with a whole
summer's fattening. By these methods, I
believe, luxury has operated in the rise of
provisions: but surely no man will ad∣vance
so dangerous a doctrine, as to say
that any thing which encourages agricul∣ture
can be prejudicial to a state.</P>
<P>When I consider the present state of this
nation, it is evident to me, that our pro∣duce,
in a middling year, is but barely
equal to our consumption: it is certain,
that by the great concourse of the poorer
sort of people to great cities, the consump∣tion
of wheaten bread is greater than it was
when many of these fed on barley, rye,
or oats: nor has this species of luxury failed
to diffuse itself thro' many country places.
It has likewise been demonstrated by many,
but particularly by the ingenious author of
the Corn-Tracts, that the consumption of
wheat has been nearly equal to the growth,
and that, even in the most plentiful years, our
exports have not amounted to above the value
of 947,000 <HI>l.</HI> Let those who doubt this fact,
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
consult Sir James Stewart's Enquiry into
the Principles of Political Oeconomy, vol. I.
page 58. If these are facts, it is pretty
evident to me, that our average crops do
but barely equal the consumption, and
consequently, that, when crops fail, we
must feel that deficiency. It is therefore
not to be wondered at, that if after five
successive bad years, we should be appre∣hensive
of want; at least that provisions
must rise. The evil points out its own
remedy. If your consumption is greater
than, or but equal to your produce, increase
the latter, and plenty must reduce the price:
for though other causes may operate in a
certain degree, plenty or scarcity must go∣vern
the price of all provisions. This in∣crease
can only be produced by a sensible
encouragement to the farmer, by convin∣cing
him that his interest is concerned in
it, by securing to him a constant consump∣tion
for his grain, that he may not be sub∣ject
to ruin by his trade being over-done.
As the means of doing this are evident to
me, though perhaps not to every one, I
shall point them out in the following
chapter.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER V. On the means of procuring plenty.</HEAD>
<P>MY principal aim in the foregoing
pages has been to prove that the
present advanced price of provisions is not
occasioned by the supposed increase of large
farms, and to explain to the Legislature,
that though Luxury and Forestallers may
bear some proportion in the cause, the chief
one is real scarcity. For the truth of this,
I most sincerely wish the Parliament would
examine such men, from the different
counties of England, as they think they
can rely on: for a few partial examinations
cannot determine the point; as local cir∣cumstances
will ever misguide. The aver∣age
of the whole will, I fear, prove what
I assert; and I am still more concerned to
say, that it is not susceptible of any pre∣sent
relief. All that can be done by Le∣gislature,
as the laws now stand, has been
put in force; I mean, the opening of our
ports: But where is the corn to come
from? In Holland, it is as dear as with
us. The ports in Flanders and France are
shut. In the Baltic, they have been open
and shut several times within these twelve
months. Sicily is shut, except for a limited
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
quantity to be exported for the use of the
Pope's dominions. In America, wheat is
now 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> sterling the bushel, and cannot
be imported here at our price. If these facts
are true, it will be allowed that there is no
great prospect of immediate relief. Pa∣tience
is our only resource. We have had
five successive bad crops, and this last more
generally so than any of the former. It
has been nearly the same all over Europe:
therefore, till there is a plentiful year, corn
cannot be cheap. All that the Legislature
can do, is to endeavour to guard against
such an evil befalling us again; and this,
in my opinion, is in their power: but,
salutary as the measure may be, it cannot
be effectually accomplished till corn is plen∣tiful,
and nearly at an equal price all over
Europe.</P>
<P>But corn is not the only article in pro∣visions
that is thought too dear: meat bears
a just proportion to it, and till the latter is
reduced, it will be vain to expect a fall in
the former: in fact, they are, and ought
to be, so dependant on each other, that
the same cause will produce the same effects
in each; and it is clear to me, that more
land is wanted both for pasture and the
plough; for it is not to be disputed that
the number of horses kept in this country,
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
and the number necessary for breeding those
that are exported, must consume the pro∣duce
of many of those acres which would
be alloted to other purposes. This is un∣doubtedly
one of the causes of provisions
being risen in price: but it is an evil at∣tended
with so great benefit, that it ought
to be endured; for it is an encouragement
to agriculture, and by whatsoever mode
this is encouraged, it will operate every
way to the advantage of this country,
which ought to consider husbandry as the
source of her wealth and strength.</P>
<P>The case is the same in regard to the
destruction of lambs and calves, which cer∣tainly
consume as much food as would
maintain a much greater number of rear∣ing
stock: but this is a species of luxury
which, though attended with some present
inconveniencies, must be complied with;
excepting in particular times, as when a
murrain alarms the nation: for, exclusive
of the political sense in which the national
advantage of agriculture sould be consi∣dered,
it is dangerous to check the inno∣cent
luxury of a free and wealthy people.
The extraordinary incentive which Britons
have, beyond all other nations, to exert
their ingenuity and industry, is a perfect
security for their enjoying the fruits of their
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
labours as they please, uncontrouled by any
thing but the laws of the land, which
should be, and are, a check on those only
who wish to go beyond the bounds of civil
society; for surely every one has a right to
enjoy his own inherited possessions; and
how much more so is that man entitled to
such security, who acquires his by indu∣stry?
Yet this security encourages luxury,
which, in some measure, increases the sup∣posed
evil. Against this there is not, in
my opinion, any salutary remedy. A
government may indeed avail itself of the
folly of men, and raise a considerable sum
by levying a severe tax on post-horses, and
other different species of luxury; but how
far that is adviseable, I humbly submit to
Legislature. I am confident it would in∣crease
the revenue, for I am certain it would
increase the evil, as every man is proud of
vying with his neighbour in extravagance:
but if it is an evil, let it not meet with
such encouragement, and let us attend to
those points which only can afford real and
constant plenty, I mean, the cultivation of
more land; for though many waste acres
have lately been brought into culture, it is
evident from what has been said above,
that the quantity is not equal to the in∣creased
consumption: was it otherwise,
provisions would be cheap, because they
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
would be plentiful; which is the only
thing that can counterbalance the effect of
riches and luxury. In evidence of what I
say, let me remind the reader of the price
of provisions, and even dainties, at Bath,
to which, though a place of dissipation,
many resort in order to live cheap.</P>
<P>This being my idea, I shall not scruple
to point out, as the first necessary step to
be taken, the inclosing and parcelling out
of all the King's Forests and Chaces, which
now lie a disgrace to a Minister who wishes
to be thought to listen to the complaints of
a nation. Let corn supply the place of
those miserable pollards, and let flocks and
herds supplant the half-starved deer which
prowl about to tempt poor wretches to
the gallows; for it is deer-stealing that in∣duces
those who are born on the chaces to
lead an idle life, which corrupts their mo∣rals,
and makes them the terror of every
honest man in their neighbourhood. Their
example likewise corrupts many who might
otherwise, probably, be useful industrious
subjects. By this a minister would entail
immortal honour on his administration, and
at the same time that the poor would be
employed and fed, the coffers of his Royal
Master would be filled. The task is not
in reality so very arduous as some may
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
imagine, nor need the Minister who under∣takes
it fear the resentment of those who
derive to themselves emoluments from the
present useless and desolate state of those
otherwise truly valuable lands. Pensions
for their lives, far superior to what they
can ever make by their forest-tenures, may
be secured to them, and yet a triple residue
be left to their Prince, who, in the pre∣sent
state of those lands, can reap no other
benefit from them than that of providing
for a good servant, and that too in a man∣ner
which no good man would wish.</P>
<P>To answer the intended good purpose,
the undertaking must be conducted with
judgment, and a strict attention to justice.
Let then the first step be the bringing a bill
into Parliament, to oblige the several pa∣rishes
and persons who have right of com∣monage,
&amp;c. upon the King's forests, to
ascertain those rights, and to mark out
such boundaries as shall be equivalent for
them, and let the turn of the scale be in
their favour; for the purpose of the pub∣lic
will be equally answered if these lands
are but appropriated: they will then by
degrees come into culture. Such rights as
shall not be ascertained within a certain
limited time, to be settled by commissioners
appointed by Parliament; and what shall
<PB N="73" REF="78"/>
afterwards remain to the Crown, may be
disposed of in the following manner;</P>
<P>Allot to each cottager his few acres, and
to each little farmer such proportion as he
can conveniently add to his farm; if many
of these two classes are near each other,
they will form an useful village: then let
the more open parts be divided into lots of
one hundred acres, and be put up to auction
on such terms as the Crown can grant,
either for three lives, or upon leases of
thirty-one years, renewable every seven
years. When I say, lots of one hundred
acres, I do not mean to confine every pur∣chaser
to a single lot: let every man pur∣chase
what tract he pleases; for, certainly,
it is from the opulent man that the greatest
benefit is to be expected; but to secure that
benefit, let it be a condition, that within a
certain number of years, the whole of each
man's purchase shall be in culture, on pain
of forfeiture of his whole purchase, with
every partial improvement that has been
made thereon. This will secure to the
Crown such purchasers as can accomplish
what they undertake, and will prevent the
land's being bought up by any rich indi∣vidual
who may wish to preserve it for
deer and moor-game: these are truly mo∣nopolizers
of lands, and not those who,
<PB N="74" REF="79"/>
employing 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> in agriculture, can,
and do, make land produce more than the
little farmer who can barely subsist: how∣ever,
both are necessary; for as I have be∣fore
said, every man's farm ought to be in
proportion to his capital, and thus both are
equally useful to the community. I repeat
this to shew, that though I think the little
farmer necessary, I would not wish the
opulent one to be excluded; and under the
restrictions I have mentioned, no evil can
ensue; for though these laws are not en∣forced
at the distance of America, yet here
they might with ease. Let every possible
encouragement be given to the undertakers:
let the first fine be in lieu of so many years
rent, which should not commence before
the seventh year; let these lands remain for
ever free from tythe, &amp;c. making a proper
provision for the church by an allotment
of a certain number of acres; and for the
encouragement of cattle, let those who work
oxen be exempted from a certain propor∣tion
of rent: that may once more intro∣duce
the use of those noble animals. En∣couragement
may prevail; but taxes and
restrictions operate too hastily and too harsh∣ly,
and will never answer any good end
in a free country. Let but the experiment
be made in one single chace or forest, and
by the effect of that let the rest be governed,
<PB N="75" REF="80"/>
Let an accurate survey be made, and the
different lots delineated: this will be the
only expence that will attend it; for each
lot will find its value. The only restriction
I would annex to the tenure should be,
that those lots which were converted into
arable land should, within a certain num∣ber
of years, have a barn and two cottages
erected on them; or, if intended for grass,
sheds and cottages suitable to the quantity
of land. Let all the trees, excepting only
such as might be picked out for his Ma∣jesty's
yards, and which should be pre∣viously
marked, be included in the pur∣chase-money of the lot on which they
stand. This will be a reciprocal advantage
to both: it will, on the one hand, save the
expence of removing them, and it will
enable the tenant either to preserve some
in case of pasture land, or he will have
wood on the spot to erect the necessary
buildings. If such a plan as this should
ever take place, it would bring in a con∣siderable
revenue to the Crown, and set a
noble example to gentlemen of landed pro∣perty
to convert their many barren acres
into useful pasture or corn-fields.</P>
<P>A better authority can no where be
produced to support my arguments on this
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
occasion, than that of the illustrious Mr.
Evelyn, in his <HI>Sylva.</HI> His advice on this
subject does honour to the country that
gave him birth. His description of our
forests, in a quotation from Lawson, points
out their deplorable state in too lively co∣lours;
nor have we reason to think they
have been improved in the course of these
last hundred years. "In our forests (says
he) you shall have for one lively thriving
tree, four, nay sometimes twenty-four,
evil thriving, rotten, and dying trees; and
instead of trees, thousands of bushes and
shrubs. What rottenness, what hollowness,
what dead arms, withered tops, curtailed
trunks; what loads of moss, dropping
boughs, and dying branches, shall you see
every where!"</P>
<P>On this Mr. Evelyn justly observes, that
the condition they are in speaks them to be
the property of a broken and decaying
freeholder; and adds, "Let not then the
Royal patrimony bear a bankrupt's re∣proach."</P>
<P>But when I quote such an author, let
me here give his opinion of the mode in
which he thinks those tracts can be made
most useful to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="82"/>
"There is not, says he, a cheaper, easier,
or more prompt expedient to advance ship∣timber,
than to solicit that in all his Majesty's
forests, woods, and parks, the spreading
oak, &amp;c. be cherished by plowing and sow∣ing."
He supposes the royal forests to
contain about 200,000 acres, and after
pointing out the method of improving them,
concludes in the following words: "The
care of so public and honourable an en∣terprize
is a right noble and royal under∣taking;
and I do pronounce it more
worthy of a Prince who truly consults
his glory in the highest interest of his
subjects, than that of gaining battles or
subduing a province."</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn has so properly recommended
a provident care of timber for the navy,
and so judiciously pointed out the method in
which it should be managed, that I cannot
but hope some attention may be paid to the
instructions of so justly-celebrated a man:
therefore all that I shall propose to myself
here will be to make my plan coincide as
much as possible with his ideas. He tells
us, that to procure good timber, every oak
should stand single, and that the frequent
plowing of the ground will cherish and
nourish the roots so as to make the tree
thrive amazingly: but, though it is with
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>
the utmost diffidence that I shall venture
to offer an opinion in competition with
him, I cannot help remarking, that if his
plan is properly executed over the whole
forest, all thoughts of converting it into
arable must drop, for the shade of those
trees disposed as he recommends would
render it unfit for corn; and it is as certain,
that if they were confined to hedge-rows
they would not become such fine timber,
for the ditches, which would naturally be
close to them, must prevent the extension
of some of their roots, and the bushes and
briars would injure them by excluding the
air from their trunks. I would therefore
propose, that half of the land be dedicated
to pasture, where the trees might stand scat∣tered
over the fields, and the distance which
Mr. Evelyn allots them would rather benefit
than prejudice the pasturage, as well as
afford shade for the cattle. By constant
feeding, the ground will certainly be en∣riched,
and if it is likewise kept free from
bushes, I cannot see why the trees upon it
should not thrive nearly, if not quite, as
well as if it was cultivated by the plough,
which operation could be almost solely for
their benefit, as the crops that might grow
there would, I doubt, scarcely repay the
expence of labour. The remaining half of
the ground would be sufficient to grow corn
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>
for the inhabitants of the forest, who could
not be very numerous under this culture,
together with cabbages, turnips, and fodder
for the beasts in the winter: thus, sup∣posing,
as Mr. Evelyn does, that there are
two hundred thousand acres of land in the
forests, &amp;c. one hundred thousand of them
will be pasture. To the four trees which he
allots to each acre, making in all 400,000
trees, I shall add in the intermediate spaces,
an equal number for succession; and I
would have all the pasture land be sur∣rounded
by a nursery well secured with
double fences.</P>
<P>This is the way in which, I think, the
forests and chaces may be converted to the
greatest use: for whether they are employed
in breeding and fattening of cattle, or in
growing of corn, they will equally answer
the intended purpose of producing plenty;
and in this manner a valuable treasure will
be kept up for the navy. As to the mode
of accomplishing it, that requires only de∣termination;
for the business is then done.
Let the conditions of planting, fencing,
and preserving, be annexed to the lease,
under a forfeiture of it upon non-com∣pliance
with the terms; and in conside∣ration
of the trouble and expence of pre∣serving
the trees and nurseries, let there be
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>
a proportionate deduction in the rent. An
annual survey, by an honest man, would
easily enforce the execution of whatever
might be proposed.</P>
<P>If what I have thrown out on this subject
should either coincide with the general
opinion, or afford any hint for a better plan,
I shall think myself happy. But at the
same time that I deliver these as my senti∣ments
in regard to the advantage which
would accrue to the Public from the in∣closure
and cultivation of the royal forests
and chaces, I confess that it is without even
the smallest hope of ever seeing any part of
this plan put in execution. Many difficul∣ties,
which must be obvious to every one
who knows the distribution of places de∣pendant
on these forests, seem almost insu∣perable.—I
therefore beg leave to offer
another plan, one that is practicable, and
which cannot fail to do honour to the ad∣ministration
of the Minister who shall effect
it. Let a sum of money be voted to his
Majesty, to purchase a tract of land on the
moors, and let this land be put into the
hands of an intelligent industrious man, to
improve it; and let the profit be his reward.
The sum thus sunk will be the only ex∣pence
incurred by Government; and such
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>
an example to men of landed property
will be truly worthy of a great King.</P>
<P>When I appear so strenuous an advocate
for cultivating waste lands, it may readily
be believed, that I shall recommend as
strongly the giving of every possible encou∣ragement
to inclosing bills. Let not the
mistaken zeal of well-disposed, but ignorant
people, persuade the man of sense that it is
prejudicial to the Poor. Create but work
for them, and their numbers cannot be too
great; nor will they want bread. The
benefit which they are supposed to reap
from commons, in their present state, I
know to be merely nominal; nay, indeed,
what is worse, I know, that, in many in∣stances,
it is an essential injury to them, by
being made a plea for their idleness; for,
some few excepted, if you offer them work,
they will tell you, that they must go to look
up their sheep, cut furzes, get their cow
out of the pound, or perhaps say they must
take their horse to be shod, that he may
carry them to a horse-race or cricket-match.
The first is plausible; but I am sorry to say
merely so, because the benefit which the
sheep are of either to himself or the
country is not an object worth notice: the
little care that such people can take of them,
frequently occasions the loss of their lambs,
<PB N="82" REF="87"/>
and the difficulty, nay indeed impossibility,
of supporting them in the winter, is the
death of the few scrubby things which
have been eating the grass that would have
maintained an useful flock: but if there is
a farmer in the neighbourhood who does
keep a flock, then the benefit which the
cottager would have, even in the summer,
must vanish; for if there is a shepherd to
this flock, he will take care that his sheep
have the best of the feed; and what is
more remarkable, though true, is, that if
a large flock are daily turned out on a
common by themselves, they only will re∣ceive
the benefit of it, and the common
sheep will fly before them to seek their
miserable sustenance among the bushes and
furzes. It is on this account that our com∣mons,
circumstanced as they generally are,
without limitation, are advantageous only
to the most considerable men of the parish;
whereas, if they were inclosed, they would
produce twice the quantity of food if re∣served
for pasture, because the furzes would
be grubbed up; or if they were divided,
they would produce their proportion of
corn. I mention these trivial circumstances
in answer to some gentlemen who, I am
convinced, oppose inclosures from a laud∣able
spirit of taking care of the Poor,
which I would propose doing in a much
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>
more effectual manner in all future in∣closures.</P>
<P>My plan is, to allot to each cottage three
or four acres, which should be annexed to
it without power of alienation, and with∣out
rent; but under the covenant of being
kept in grass, except such small part as
should be necessary for a garden: this would
keep the cottager in more plenty than a
very extensive range of common: he and
his family must then cultivate the garden,
or suffer as they ought to do: and to ob∣viate
the plea of their wanting fuel, let it
be fenced and planted with ash and other
quick growing trees, at the expence of
those who are to have the property of the
common. This would be a real benefit to
him, as it would employ his wife and chil∣dren,
and help to support his family whilst
he is at work for the farmers in the neigh∣bourhood,
instead of depending, as they
too often do, upon the supposed profits of
their commonage. The commons in the
parish of Chailley in Sussex afford remark∣able
instances of what I advance. Mr.
Young observes, in Vol. iii. p. 153, of the
Farmer's Tour, that in that parish the rates
are 9<HI>s.</HI> in the pound; and on enquiry into
the cause of it, found, that it was owing
to the extensiveness of the commons, which
<PB N="84" REF="89"/>
induced many to rely on the cows and sheep
they could keep, to exempt them from la∣bour;
the consequence of which was their
coming on the parish upon any loss they suf∣fered
in their cattle, having acquired that idle
habit which would not permit them to work.
Instead of this, an industrious life leads them
to a knowledge of those real and reasonable
comforts which I wish them to enjoy; such
as, a good dwelling decently furnished, they
and their children well fed and clad; and
if these last are early brought up to honest
labour, instead of pilfering, there cannot
be a better security for their not becoming
a burden to the parish.</P>
<P>I am aware that there may be objections
started to what I have now proposed, by
saying, that though this land may be se∣cured
to the present occupier, yet it will be
in the power of the landlord, provided it is
not the cottager's own, to raise the rent, or
that, when the cottagers families grow up,
and more cottages are built, the ground
being all disposed of, there will not remain
any to annex to the new cottages. In my
opinion, these difficulties are easily obvi∣ated;
for as the landlords are to be bene∣fited
by their proportion of the common,
they may, by the same act, be restrained
from raising the rents of the old ones; and
<PB N="85" REF="90"/>
as the land-holders are the only people who
will build, or grant building leases, they
may be obliged in future to annex to each
new-erected cottage an equal proportion of
land.</P>
<P>There is indeed one other restrictive
clause which I would add to these inclosing
bills, I mean when commons are to be
converted into arable land: it is, that for
every hundred acres of arable land, the
proprietor should be obliged to erect a barn
and threshing-floor; for confident I am that
there are frequently large tracts of land
which have not a sufficient number of them,
and that by this means the farmer is often
accused of retaining his corn, when in fact
he cannot thresh it out so fast as he would
wish to do.</P>
<P>Another improvement in which legisla∣ture
can interfere, is the inclosure of com∣mon-field
land, which I know requires their
cordial assistance as much, if not more,
than the commons I have been speaking of;
for, in the present state of those lands,
they are not capable of producing half
what they would otherwise do, unless in∣deed
the whole belongs to some very few,
who are sensible enough to agree among
themselves on a good mode of culture; but
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>
this is rarely the case: and though it may
appear ridiculous to some of my readers
that I enter so minutely into the little detail
of farming, I cannot refrain from enume∣rating
the many disadvantages which attend
their present situation, that I may be the
better able to point out the benefit that
would accrue to the nation if they were in∣closed
and properly divided. The general
face of such common-fields, being divided
into narrow slips, makes it obvious to every
traveller, whether conversant in farming or
not, that they belong to different tenants,
and it is a certain fact, that, frequently, a
man who rents one hundred acres will not
have ten acres adjoining to each other, but,
often, scattered over the whole tract in
small parcels, sometimes so small as half
acres, but often in single acres. It will
not require much rhetoric to prove, even
to a man not conversant in the busi∣ness,
that this must occasion great loss of
time in sending the horses and men from
spot to spot, in plowing, carting, or in
harvest time; nor is it necessary to demon∣strate,
that waste of labour is waste of
produce. Besides, by these small divisions
there is generally a real waste of land, and
in many countries a very considerable one,
commonly called <HI>balks.</HI> These balks are of
different widths, from two to sixteen feet:
<PB N="87" REF="92"/>
they are never ploughed, but are kept in
grass, under pretence of their being com∣mon-field
pasture. They are, literally, of
no benefit to either the occupier or the Poor;
for they are too narrow either to mow, or
to graze without a boy to attend each beast
with a halter; and when the corn is off,
their grass is too old to feed: nor ought the
common-field to be kept open till it is con∣sumed,
for that must prevent putting in
wheat in the proper season, and is a total
prohibition of turnips and cabbages, often
so necessary to the farmer, and consequently
to the country. Likewise, the encourage∣ment
which the plough gives to the sides of
these balks encourages the grass and other
weeds to run into the farmer's corn-land.
In many instances too, where a bad course
of husbandry prevails, and while the com∣mon-field
tenure is such that the whole must
be governed by the custom of the field, it
prevents all improvement let an indi∣vidual
be ever so industrious: it will be said
that he has his land accordingly; but that
is what I lament.</P>
<P>Can there be a clearer proof of the
national advantage of inclosing and pro∣perly
dividing the land, than that the
farmer will chearfully give double the rent
for the same land when inclosed? Does not
this point out, that he can make it produce
<PB N="88" REF="93"/>
more; and is it not as clear that the nation
must be benefited by that increase?</P>
<P>I should not have dwelt so long on this
tedious subject, but that I am persuaded
plenty is wanting, and that these are the
most likely means to procure it: when
that is done, then, and not till then, is the
time for the legislature to take up the great
object of a free port for corn: then, let
every act that regards the corn laws be re∣pealed;
make the trade free and open for
export or import at all times and on all
occasions, without the least restraint; abolish
every port-charge, nay even the smallest
incumbrance: let corn flow like water, and
it will find its level. Then, and by that
means only, will be introduced a set of
traders which this country never knew; I
mean, <HI>Corn-Merchants,</HI> who will most
chearfully embark in a commerce where so
quick returns are made. Watchful of their
neighbours, and attentive to their own in∣terest,
they will not miss an opportunity of
supplying the market that is in want. If
corn is plentiful here and scarce abroad,
they will export: that will naturally give
a start to the market, and the rise of the
market will as naturally stop the ex∣portation.
Thus will the price of corn
always be nearly on an equal footing,
and not subject to the great variations which
<PB N="89" REF="94"/>
must ever be the consequence when the
opening or shutting of the port depends
on the price at Bear-key, where an artifi∣cial
rise or fall may ever mislead the Legis∣lature,
while a few individuals will reap
the sole benefit of what is calculated for a
national advantage; not without danger,
sometimes, of bringing on a famine:
whereas if the corn-trade was perfectly
free, men of capital would engage in it,
and the price of corn would be as well
regulated and as well known as the price
of exchange, which is alternately in favour
of London, Amsterdam, Hamburgh, and
Cadiz, as circumstances direct, and in which
there cannot be any craft. The balance
would, from time to time, be in favour of
the exporter. This is a fact, and as well
known as that the course of exchange points
out in whose favour is the balance of trade;
which is, in other words, that the country
which exports most of its own produce, must
have the greatest remittance made to it.</P>
<P>The dread which some may have of
monopolies, cannot bear an argument; for,
by the account lately laid before the House
of Commons, the yearly produce of wheat
alone is said to be 4,000,000 of quarters,
which I believe far short of the reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Young</HI>'s Northern Tour, vol. IV. p. 349.</NOTE>;
<PB N="90" REF="95"/>
but even that quantity, at 30 <HI>s.</HI> a quarter,
would amount to 6,000,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI>
Will any man, or set of men, dream of such
a monopoly? especially as, if it should take
place, it could not fail of being doubled in
a few years; for as it is the steady and
uniform price of a commodity which en∣gages
the real merchant, such as this coun∣try
once knew, to embark his capital, be∣lieve
me, the same would operate with the
farmer. Let us not run away with a notion
that the growth of corn is not to be adopted
as a system of trade, as much as the growth
of rice, or sugar-canes. Whatever may be
the opinion of men in great cities, I know
it ought to be, I know it is; for there is
not a good farmer in any country, who has
not a regular system in his business, and
who does not adopt an uniform course of
crops. In confirmation of what I say, look
to Norfolk, where the course is regularly
turnips, barley, clover, wheat: Does not
this prove, that the farmer prefers a regu∣lar
certain profit to the chance-gain of spe∣culative
husbandry? Is it not then as evi∣dent,
that the farmers would prefer the
reasonable profits of a steady market, to the
present uncertainty which keeps them in
constant alarm? and with how much more
pleasure would they deal with the open
fair trader, from whom they could not fail
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>
having the price of the market, than with
the present speculators, of whom they are
ever jealous, and always suspicious that
when such buyers appear in markets, some
sudden rise is expected? But without al∣lowing
them this degree of common sense,
and even suspecting them of the practice
of retaining their corn, the freedom of the
trade in which such capitals would be en∣gaged
would force their corn to market:
exportation would induce them to send it
thither; and importation would render their
scheme of retention abortive. I have just
mentioned these few circumstances relative
to the farmer, to prove that the freedom of
the trade must encourage agriculture, and
that the natural consequence must be an
increase in the produce: if so, it is as evi∣dent
that England must always have a sur∣plus
to export, and the national advantage
that will accrue therefrom cannot, I believe,
require explanation.</P>
<P>To those whose views do not extend be∣yond
the bellies of the poor, I shall pro∣duce
a stronger argument. Look up to
Amsterdam, and wonder how that city,
with every natural disadvantage that can
attend the corn-trade, has, for many years
past, been the magazine of Europe; com∣paratively
speaking, without a blade of corn
<PB N="92" REF="97"/>
growing in its country, with one of the
worst ports in the German Ocean, the
<HI>Texel,</HI> and with a mud-bank within two
leagues of the city, namely the <HI>Pompus,</HI>
which will not float a vessel even of two
hundred tuns, except in spring-tides; won∣der,
I say, that this city should supply all
Europe. The reason is, that there the trade
is free, and there the most wealthy people
of the country are corn merchants. I speak
within bounds when I say, that one half
of the trade of the city of Amsterdam is
corn. Corn was as plentiful there, and as
cheap as it had been for some years before,
when, in 1767, England was under the
greatest apprehensions of a famine; and
when it was necessary to take, during the
recess of Parliament, a step which this
country cannot yet have forgot.</P>
<P>In answer to this it may be asked, By
what accident then were the Dutch in such
distress for corn the last year? The reason
is obvious: too great security will some∣times
put men off their guard; unused to
know the want of corn, they might inad∣vertently
go too great lengths before they
perceived the mischief; the intended mono∣poly
of the courts of Vienna and Berlin,
added to the distress of Poland, might in∣crease
the general scarcity, and prevent
<PB N="93" REF="98"/>
their usual supplies. The like could not
probably befal us, who are naturally so
averse to the idea of monopolizing, and
consequently would be ever on the watch.
Besides, our supplies are within ourselves,
and would, I am confident, annually in∣crease.</P>
<P>I am aware that there is another sort
of men who would oppose the free expor∣tation
on a more plausible foundation,
namely, the danger of our manufacturers
wanting bread, and being thereby rendered
useless subjects, as the raising of their prices
would fix a prohibition on their goods in
foreign markets. To these I shall reply,
that profuse plenty in manufacturing towns
does not produce more labour, but the
contrary. It is a fact well known to those
who are conversant in that matter, that
scarcity, to a certain degree, promotes in∣dustry,
and that the manufacturer who can
subsist on three days work, will be idle
and drunken the remainder of the week.
I shall proceed yet farther, and say, that
those manufactures in which foreigners can∣not
vye with us, will go abroad under
every disadvantage that may attend them
in regard to price; such as Sheffield and
Birmingham hard-wares—France must and
will have them at any rate. In proof of
<PB N="94" REF="99"/>
what I say, we have continued to supply
that country with them, notwithstanding
their threat when Mr. C. Townshend was
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that unless
we would permit the importation of cam∣bricks,
&amp;c. they would prohibit the use
of our hard-ware, and some other of our
manufactures. So it will ever be with our
woollen manufactures of Norwich, Leeds,
Exeter, Colchester, and Salisbury; consist∣ing
in bays, druggets, long-ells, shalloons,
duroys, flannels, &amp;c. these will go to Italy,
Spain, Portugal, and Germany, and even
into the South of France through Genoa.
Russia and the Northern parts must have
the Leeds manufactory; and Holland and
Flanders some particular articles in con∣siderable
quantities. And let it be observed,
that these articles are the most beneficial
objects in our woollen manufactory, be∣ing
made of all English wool, whereas
broad-cloth must be part Spanish. As to
the trade to the Levant, which we have
lost, it has not been owing to the price,
but to the cloth being of an improper qua∣lity.
France, which has been long in the
use of making the thin cloths which are
required at that market, must have the
trade; whilst our manufacturers, ignorantly
and obstinately persisting in making that
strong cloth which we pride ourselves in,
<PB N="95" REF="100"/>
cannot sell a piece. Many attempts have
been made to obtain the thin cloth; sam∣ples
have been sent over to our merchants;
the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and
Commerce, throw out premiums, but all to
no purpose. Not that this was the only
cause of our losing that part of the Levant
trade, for, notwithstanding the precautions
at Blackwell-hall, frauds were committed
by our traders that did dishonour to this
nation. However, allowing every advan∣tage
which attends the exportation of our
manufactures, in which the corn that fed
the manufacturers is exported to double ad∣vantage,
by feeding those men whose la∣bours
we export, it will be agreed, that
the demand for our manufactures is limited,
and that, under particular treaties of com∣merce,
or ruptures with states, a total pro∣hibition
of them may take place. That
never can be the case with corn; a remark∣able
instance of which appeared in the
year 1748, when the French, though at
war with us, contracted for 400,000 quar∣ters.
There cannot be a more glaring proof
than this, of the great national benefit
that would attend the free exportation of
grain; and if that can be done, with as
great a certainty of having corn cheap at
home, is not that country mad, who have
it naturally in their power, and will not
<PB N="96" REF="101"/>
adopt the scheme. That plenty, and a more
equal price, which I will maintain is the
great encouragement to the farmer, has
been produced by exportation, no man
who has read the history of this country
can deny.</P>
<P>In 1689, an act passed to give a bounty
on the exportation of corn, with repeal of
customs on exportation. The wife intention
of the Legislature is evident; it was to
increase agriculture, I mean the plough,
for that had ever been neglected; the na∣tural
consequence of a continued scene of
intestine broils. What was the consequence?
Corn became cheaper, and was reduced
from 2<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> to 1<HI>l.</HI> 15<HI>s.</HI> 1<HI>d.</HI> in 1756.
The wisdom of this law, and its salutary
effects during a course of seventy years,
sufficiently proves the strength of my ar∣gument,
namely, that exportation, which
is consumption, will encourage agriculture,
that this will produce plenty, and that
plenty must naturally reduce the price.
The facts which I allude to have been ac∣curately
stated, and the advantages arising
from the exportation of corn clearly proved
by the author of the Corn Tracts, from
whom I differ in opinion only with re∣gard
to retaining the bounty, and allow∣ing
any restraint whatever in the corn∣trade.
<PB N="97" REF="102"/>
A perfect freedom is all that is now
requisite; but that freedom ought to be
without the least check or controul: the
very motive for instituting the bounty,
proves that it is now needless.</P>
<P>In former years, when England was
divided into many little principalities, and
consequently in eternal warfare, flocks and
herds were the natural riches of the people,
as being easily removed: the plough was
of course neglected. In the year 1537, the
size of flocks was limited to 2000, and in
1547 it was reduced to 1550. This was
done to encourage the plough; and to the
same end commons were inclosed. In 1563,
the exportation of corn was allowed, and
this continued in force, under different
modes, till 1688, when a bounty thereon
was first granted. Thus was agriculture
first nourished; and of such consequence
was it deemed in a national light, that a
bounty was given to the farmer to indem∣nify
him in an undertaking which might
afterwards prove beneficial to the nation.
In short, that wife legislature knew that
the produce of the earth, whether gold, lead,
or corn, was the riches of the state, and
it was a sensible encouragement to the sub∣ject
to search for those riches in the bowels
of the earth. In no other light could it
<PB N="98" REF="103"/>
be seen: for if it was supposed that the
husbandman could only continue to support
himself by his labour, and that there would
be no surplus to export, or that foreigners
should be bribed to purchase that surplus at
an equivalent to the value of the national
gain, what benefit could ensue? It was evi∣dently
meant, as in the whale and herring
fishery, to indemnisy adventurers in a
hazardous undertaking: but when that
undertaking ceases to be hazardous, and the
trade is become beneficial, the encouragement
is no longer necessary. Such is now the
situation of our agriculture; and happily
for this country it is in so flourishing a
state, that all the farmer requires is perfect
liberty to sell when and where he pleases:
but that cannot take place, unless the same
free liberty be given to people to become
purchasers, which can never happen so long
as the least restraint hangs over the trade.
The merchant, who engages his capital,
must be as uncontrouled in the sale as in the
purchase, and the benefit which the nation
is to expect from the interference of the
merchant naturally is, that he will settle
proper correspondencies abroad, as well as
that he will be intimately acquainted with
the state of our markets at home; in short,
he will be in corn, what the great remit∣tancer
is in bills of exchange: but if we
<PB N="99" REF="104"/>
are to expect the merchant to import when
he finds the nation is in want of it, a secu∣rity
must be given to himself and his cor∣respondents,
that their property is safe, and
that if their corn comes to a bad market,
they shall have liberty to take it back again,
and not be treated in the manner they were
in 1767: for when their cargoes then came
into the river, the factors took the alarm,
and sunk the price below what the foreign
corn could be fold at: nor were the im∣porters
suffered to carry it out again; but
here their corn lay till it was damaged, and
sold to feed hogs. This must ever be the
case with a partial opening or shutting of
the ports. An artificial price, made for the
purpose by designing schemers, may ever
misguide; nor can legislature rely on the
information they are likely to obtain, at least
not in so short a time as may be requisite;
and under these circumstances, depend on
it, foreigners will ever be averse to send us
corn; for if, as in the abovementioned in∣stance,
they are only to be made use of as
tools to check the villainy of our own
traders, they will not submit to it; but if the
trade was perfectly open, they would deal
with us in that as in other commodities.</P>
<P>How much more favourably are we situ∣ated
than the Dutch to supply all Europe
<PB N="100" REF="105"/>
with corn! But to do that there must not
be the smallest incumbrance whatever on the
trade; not even the slightest port-charge.
Let freight and insurance be the only bur∣then.
These, for exportation, are, in time
of peace,

about 16<HI>s.</HI> per ton, or 4<HI>s.</HI> per quarter, ex∣clusive
of from 1 to 1 1/2 <HI>per cent.</HI> insurance.
A saving of this to the exporter, with any
rise of our market, would naturally stop too
great an exportation. To prove the proba∣bility
of what I assert, let any one examine
Mr. Cook's corn-tables as published by au∣thority
of parliament. It will be found,
throughout the whole of them, that, all
along the coast where corn has been shipped
off to supply the London market, and
under that pretence, with still greater ad∣vantage
to France, corn has been uniformly
cheaper than in the inland counties. There
may, indeed, likewise be other reasons for
it; but I am confident the chief one is,
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
that there being a constant demand, a con∣stant
source of plenty flows in; and though
the temptations to ship off have been great,
a saving of freight and insurance has been
thought an adequate profit to the merchant.</P>
<P>I am aware that, though there may be
some who will agree with me that expor∣tation
will encourage agriculture, and con∣sequently
produce plenty, yet others will
say, that free importation may be as great a
check, and under particular circumstances
ruin the farmer, and thus affect the landed
interest; that is, if by chance crops should
fail in this country, and there should be
universal plenty every where else, corn
might be imported at a much lower price
than the farmer could afford to sell it for;
this might occasion a loss to him, which
this country cannot wish, nor ought to
permit; for it would naturally be a total
discouragement to tillage.</P>
<P>Let us see how this matter is likely to
operate. The only country, in my opinion,
from whence we can apprehend such an
importation is America; where, some say,
they can afford to export at 20<HI>s.</HI> but to this
must be added, commission, freight, insu∣rance,
wharfage, waste, and damage.

<P>However, let us consider at what price
the farmer can afford to sell under the dif∣ferent
circumstance of good and bad crops,
in which I shall make some allowance for
the improved culture of this country, which
is, that of sowing wheat on clover lays in∣stead
of a dunged fallow. This will enable
him to sell at a lower price, as I shall
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>
endeavour to explain by the following
calculation, supposing his course to be tur∣nips,
barley, clover, wheat.</P>
<P>This is indeed a very profitable course,
and indicates good land; but it would be
endless to take all the courses that would
suit different soils; nor will it be difficult to
form a general opinion from the following
calculation.

<P>By the foregoing estimate, which is in∣deed
on an excellent course of husbandry
upon land that is proper for it, it appears
that the farmer may, by great care and with
good luck, obtain about 25 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI>
but to do this he must sell his wheat at 46 <HI>s.</HI>
8 <HI>d.</HI> and his barley at 24 <HI>s.</HI> It must likewise
be observed, that it is not every soil that
will admit of a course attended with so
much profit. However, the conclusion to
be drawn from the above seems to be this,
viz. that to obtain this profit, the produce
of an acre of wheat should sell for 7 <HI>l.</HI> His
expences will always be nearly the same,
but his crop may vary, therefore his wheat
should sell in proportion to his crop; for
example:

</LIST></P>
<P>Here it is worthy of observation, that by
the above table it appears that when the
farmer has three quarters he can afford to
sell at 46 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> and as the average of the
various opinions of the produce of an acre
is between 3 Q. and 2½ Q. which would
require a price of about 51 <HI>s.</HI> it seems to
account for the bounty having been ex∣tended
to 48 <HI>s.</HI> as supposing that a price the
farmer could not afford to sell at; for tho'
at that price there appears now to be a very
handsome profit, it must be remembered,
that agriculture was in those days in a very
unimproved state, and attended with much
greater expence, which must have rendered
a much less profit; however, it is evident
that the fixing the bounty at 48 <HI>s.</HI> was the
work of upright and intelligent men, but
proves that in the present improved state of
agriculture, the farmer can afford to sell
much cheaper, and that indeed no bounty
is requisite; but if any, that it should not
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>
exceed 40 <HI>s.</HI> It likewise proves, in my opi∣nion,
that we need not dread the effects
of importation from America; for though
land there is cheap, labour is dear, and
therefore there is little cause to believe that
they can undersell us in Europe: nor is it
reasonable to believe that agriculture is there
so good; and though that climate may be,
and is fine, it is not to be expected that
they should always have plentiful harvests
when we have scanty ones, without which
they would be but on a par with us; for
supposing the advantage of climate and
cheapness of land to be in their favour,
the expence of freight, &amp;c. will always
make an addition of at least 14 <HI>s.</HI> per
quarter. But there is yet another rea∣son,
which is, that if corn should be
very dear here, we may rest assured they
would have a profit in some proportion to
such dearness. The truth of this is pretty
evident from the present price of wheat
in America, it being now 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> sterling
the bushel there, and cannot be imported
here at our present high price: but were it
otherwise; suppose the farmer should be
curtailed in his profit for one year, it
would not be his ruin. As to any quan∣tity
that may come from other parts of
the world, I am confident they cannot pre∣judice
the English farmer: it is true that
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>
Holland has formerly imported great quan∣tities
of wheat from Poland, and rye from
Russia: but when we consider the present
division of Poland, and that Dantzig, thro'
which it must pass, is in the hands of
Prussia, there is greater reason to believe
that the Dutch will come to us for their sup∣ply,
than that we need fear an influx from
Poland.</P>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. On Markets.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I appear so strong an advocate
for free import and export, it will be
conceived that I am not less strenuous for a
perfect freedom in markets: every restraint
in the sale of a commodity, is a check on
the trade, and must necessarily enhance the
price of the commodity.</P>
<P>The absurd law of obliging farmers to
bring their corn to market, and not sell by
sample, can answer no good purpose: as
often as it has been attempted to be en∣forced,
it has done mischief; it has pre∣vented
the farmer from exposing his corn to
sale: for can it be imagined that the grower
will submit to be the dupe to the crafty pur∣chaser,
or is it reasonable that he should?
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
Real plenty, or real scarcity, will fix the
standard price, and as he must submit to the
one, it is as reasonable that he should reap
the benefit of the other: but supposing it
could be enforced, the line of the law can
admit of deviation in the defaulter; thus,
suppose a farmer and a miller to be next∣door
neighbours, with a market at ten miles
distance; is it agreeable to common sense,
that the farmer should employ a team of
horses which may be wanted in the plough,
to carry to market that corn which he or
the miller must bring back again? must it
not naturally inhance the price? and must
not that fall upon the Poor, for whose sake
the law was supposed to be made?</P>
<P>To enumerate the many inconveniencies
that attend restrictions in the corn-trade,
would be endless. Turn but your eyes to
France, and view the inconveniencies they
laboured under for so many years, by adopt∣ing
that barbarous feudal system in their
corn laws! Happily for that country, a set
of worthy virtuous men, who are as able
politicians as they are truly patriots, have,
by their publications, opened the eyes of
their Government, who are now making
great strides in revoking those restrictive
laws, equally absurd and injurious to the
nation and the individual. Our laws indeed
<PB N="112" REF="117"/>
have not been so rigid; but such as they
are, I hope the legislature will totally abolish
them. Let this be their first step; it may be
done without danger of lessening our corn-trade,
and is one of the necessary preludes
to the great work of making free ports,
which neither can or ought to be done till
corn is plentiful, and at nearly an equal
price all over Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="118"/>
<HI>A short Account of the</HI> CORN TRADE
<HI>of</HI> AMSTERDAM.</P>
<P>OF all the arguments that can be urged
in support of a free corn trade, none
will carry with it that conviction which
is to be obtained by a candid inquiry into
the state of that of Amsterdam. It is
indeed my knowledge of some circum∣stances,
relative to that branch of com∣merce,
which makes me so strong an ad∣vocate
for the freedom I recommend. I
shall therefore, in support of my opinion,
give an account of the nature of the trade
of that city, and the circumstances that
attend it in consequence of its situation.</P>
<P>I shall begin by informing my Reader,
that the most considerable merchants, and
most opulent people of Amsterdam, are
engaged in this trade: it is not indeed well
possible to ascertain the fund employed in
it, as that must vary with the annual growth
of the countries from whence it was sup∣plied,
which was chiefly Poland, by the
way of Dantzig, with some small quanti∣ties
from Riga; though this last indeed
has consisted mostly in rye. Since the dis∣turbances
in Poland, Amsterdam has re∣ceived
<PB N="114" REF="119"/>
large quantities of wheat from Arch∣angel,
Petersburgh, and several other ports
in the gulf of Finland; but they have
not been sufficient to preserve the usual
plenty, and evidently account for the scarcity
that city experienced these two last years.</P>
<P>So thoroughly are the Dutch convinced
of the national advantage which attends the
freedom of their corn trade, that though
there was at one period so great an appear∣ance
of scarcity that they would not permit
the exportation of potatoes, roots, or any
other kind of provision, yet they would
not suffer the freedom of their corn trade to
be infringed. Exportation continued as
free as their importation, though wheat
was then 240 gold guilders <HI>per</HI> last, or
168 current guilders <HI>per</HI> half last, equal to
about 16 <HI>l.</HI> sterling <HI>per</HI> load. It is true
indeed that there are some small duties and
port charges, such as 6 guilders <HI>per</HI> last,
which is about 13 <HI>d. per</HI> quarter for import,
and about one half of that for export, to
which is to be added one half <HI>per cent.</HI>
admiralty duty, or what we should call
port charge. I have indeed recommended
the abolishing every charge, and am con∣fident
it is necessary so to do in this country,
where it cannot be denied but that the de∣lays
and difficulties to which our traders
<PB N="115" REF="120"/>
are subject from the behaviour of custom-house
officers, are such severe checks on
trade, as ought to be abolished, especially
in a trade which consists so much in coasting
voyages. However, if the abolishing them
cannot be complied with, let us at least
adopt the sensible mode of the Dutch, who
have fixed their duties at one regular stan∣dard;
well knowing that if it was left de∣pendant
on the market price, the trade
would even be subject to frauds, which can
so easily be practised by a few men, who
always have it in their power to make
whatever artificial price may suit them.</P>
<P>As a yet stronger proof of the advantage
of a free corn trade, I can inform the rea∣der,
that the wisdom of the corn laws of
the Dutch, which were founded on found
policy, has been confirmed to them by ex∣perience:
for, some years ago, when they
were under great apprehension of scarcity,
they laid an embargo on corn, but after
three months trial were obliged to open
their ports; nor have the States suffered it
to be attempted since, not even last year,
when the universal appearance of a dearth
in Germany might seem to require it, if
any thing could: the experience which
they had acquired by the former attempt,
convinced them of the folly of such a step;
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>
for in consequence of the embargo here
alluded to, they soon discovered they were
in danger of being deprived of that supply
which enabled them to be the warehouse
keepers and carriers of all Europe. By this
wise regulation they have had the supplying
of France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, nay
even Germany, by the way of the Rhine:
but what is very remarkable, and the strong∣est
proof of the advantage of free trade,
is, that Amsterdam, from a long habit of
carrying it on, enjoys it to its full extent,
notwithstanding every natural disadvantage
that can possibly attend a country. In proof
of what I now advance, I can inform the
reader of two remarkable instances; the
one is, that corn was shipped at Amsterdam
for France, but from an apprehension the
ship would not get time enough through the
Texel, the remainder of the quantity was
sent by inland navigation at a considerable
expence to Rotterdam, to be shipped off
there; and the fact is, that the last ship was
returned again from the coast of France,
before the Amsterdam ship got out of the
Texel. The other instance, not less striking,
and more pertinent to my present subject,
is, that the same house shipped a cargo
from Amsterdam and London at the same
time, both bound to Leghorn; the English
ship returned into the river, and the remit∣tances
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>
were made, before the Dutchman got
out of the Texel.</P>
<P>The two abovementioned examples are, I
hope, sufficient to prove the natural advantages
we have in point of situation; nor can I think
that people will be so blind as not to see the
great national advantage that would attend
such an export of the natural growth of our
country. It is true, indeed, that according
to the information given by the ingenious
author of the Corn Tracts, the greatest quan∣tity
ever exported here is too trifling to be
thought an object: but let it be remembered,
that all I mean to prove is, that this is entirely
owing to our trade's not being open, and
that we might naturally command the whole
of it; especially since the division of Poland,
the growth of which must now come through
Dantzick, which at present belongs to the
King of Prussia.</P>
<P>Here I must inform those who do not think
the corn trade can ever be a great object to
England, that the capital which is engaged
in it at Amsterdam is far beyond belief.
Let them judge of it when I tell them, that,
on an average, there are seldom less than
20,000 lasts, which make above 200,000
quarters, lying in their magazines. The value
of this quantity cannot be much less than
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
400,000f sterling. So considerable a sum
as this lying always locked up in an arti∣ficial
trade, proves the advantage of it, and
demonstrates that we need only create the
trade, to have the traders. I have before
observed, that the trade which is really bene∣ficial
to a country must consist in the expor∣tation
of such articles as are the produce of
that country: but, in contradiction to this
idea, it appears that a sensible policy has
rendered the most unnatural branch of trade
highly beneficial to Holland; for, without
a blade of corn growing in their own coun∣try,
excepting a very small quantity in
Zealand and East∣Friesland, the magazines
of Amsterdam have always a supply for
every port in Europe, brought in and car∣ried
out through the most tedious and dan∣gerous
passage into the German Ocean, or
the Channel.</P>
<P>The necessary result of what I have been
saying is, that if we, who are so well situ∣ated
to supply those markets, were to adopt
the policy of the Dutch, we should enjoy
their profits in a much higher degree than
they can with their bad navigation, and this
in addition to the great advantage of a natu∣ral
trade, which is that of exporting the pro∣duce
of our own country. Can there pos∣sibly
be a clearer demonstration of the en∣couragement
<PB N="119" REF="124"/>
it would give to agriculture,
or do we want a stronger proof that we
should always have plenty at home for our
own consumption, when the people at Am∣sterdam,
who are obliged to purchase it,
have their magazines always full, notwith∣standing
that the port is never shut?</P>
<P>As what I have advanced on this head
may perhaps not be credited, but deemed
the phantom of a wild brain, let me intreat
the legislature to consult that able and up∣right
minister at the Hague, Sir Joseph
Yorke. He can give indisputable information
on this subject, information which may be
depended on; and upon his opinion I will
rest mine.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER I had finished the foregoing
Essay, the third edition of the Rev.
Doctor Price's <HI>Observations on Reversionary
Payments, &amp;c.</HI> was sent to me from town.
His deservedly respectable character made
it necessary that I should take particular
notice of what he says on monopolizing
farms and its consequences. I am sorry to
find myself under a necessity of differing
widely with him in my opinion on this
subject; and cannot help lamenting that a
gentleman of so much knowledge, and who
is so clear and demonstrative in all that he
says on those matters which come within
the sphere of his real studies, should, so
inadvertently, enter into a popular error,
and join in the cry which has been art∣fully
kept up to irritate and inflame the
minds of men.</P>
<P>My expressions on this occasion may
seem too strong; but so sensible and candid
an antagonist requires to be very pointedly
refuted. I declare, that I highly revere
and esteem his character, and am persuaded
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>
that it was his very love of truth that has
led him out of the way: but at the same
time I hope this instance of his having un∣designedly
promoted the present uneasiness
of a misguided people, will be a caution to
him, in the future, to keep to such subjects
as really come within the line of his
particular studies; and that he will not so
readily give credit to reports propagated
by designing men, the circumstances of
which he is not perfectly acquainted with;
for an opinion of so much weight as his,
is more dangerous than the declamations
of an hundred scribblers whom I have not
thought worthy of notice. This, I hope,
will be an apology for my pointing out to
him the true state of the facts concerning
which he has been misinformed.</P>
<P>As to the authority of Mr. <HI>Muret,</HI> and
his reasoning on the subject of great farms,
(quoted by Dr. Price, p. 373.) it has very
little weight with me: not that I mean to
doubt his veracity, for I believe he relates
and argues as he thinks; but speculative
productions seldom carry conviction. If
the village that was converted into a de∣mesne,
was made a park or pleasure ground,
I can suppose the fact; or if it was a nest
of houses thrown down and converted into
corn-fields, I will allow that it could not
<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
lodge so many inhabitants; or if it was a
number of small farms taken up by some
rich man, who, though merely a specula∣tor,
thought himself a farmer, I will be∣lieve
the produce to have been less; but if
it was put into the hands of an intelligent
husbandman, I think I have shewn in the
foregoing pages, that the produce could
not but be greater. Our country abounds
with facts of this kind, and I hope their
number will increase.</P>
<P>When it is done by landlords, to reduce
the repairs of cottages, I abhor the idea,
and have accordingly exploded it: but the
speculations which the great farmer is able
to make, put it in his power to draw more
riches from the bowels of the earth, and
thereby he becomes a more useful member
of this great and powerful nation. Perhaps
Mr. Muret would have rejoiced to have
seen an instance of industry which I met
with in Flanders, a dozen men mattock∣ing
up a field of stubble to put in wheat:
but the man who knew the use and benefit
of the plough, lamented the lost labour of
eleven of those poor wretches, who might
have been employed more beneficially for
their country in manufactures, whilst one
might cultivate with a plough as much land
as would support the rest. This would be a
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>
public benefit, and not a calamity:—nor is
it a consequence that there must be depo∣pulation,
because men are not seen wasting
their labour in the open field.</P>
<P>In regard to the many calculations which
have appeared, and by which the depopu∣lation
of this country has been attempted
to be proved, I can say little; nor would it
become me to enter the lists with the many
ingenious men who have made that a part
of their studies; but I shall not scruple to
say, that the <HI>data</HI> on which these calcu∣lations
are made are, in my opinion, too
slight to establish certain consequences. For
example, the residence in London of those
who are deemed its inhabitants is by no
means regular, and the number who come
from different parts to London and its envi∣rons
within the bills of mortality, for ad∣vice
in their last stage, must swell the list
of deaths. On the other hand, as the list
of births is only taken from the christen∣ings,
the number of born must be much
greater, as neither the Dissenters nor the
Quakers are christened in our churches;
thus the whole is erroneous. Again, when
we consider the number of great manu∣facturing
towns which have arisen within
this century, and see every where not only
an increase of culture, but also that it is
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
carried on in a much more spirited manner
than formerly, (circumstances which must
necessarily employ a greater number of
hands) I cannot see on what foundation
we can determine the number of the inha∣bitants
to be less. As to forming the cal∣culation
from the number of houses, so far
as my observation has extended, that can∣not
be done: but if any medium is to be
taken, I should rather fix it at six persons
in a house, which would make our whole
number amount to about six millions. But
when we consider the numbers of poor that
inhabit one house in manufacturing towns
and great cities, nay even in country vil∣lages,
there can be no doubt but that six
millions is far under the mark. How∣ever,
neither of these doctrines can have
any relation to the scarcity of corn, which,
in reality, is scarce or not scarce in propor∣tion
to the consumption of it. If there are
more mouths, there will be more corn, be∣cause
there will be more hands to till the
earth; and if there is more corn, there
will be more mouths, because plenty will
bring people; and thus, by this happy
connection and dependance one on the
other, I am pleased to think the world will
go on as it has hitherto continued to do.
If any of the ingenious literary world
agree with me in opinion, I hope to see
<PB N="126" REF="130"/>
some of their productions calculated to ease
the minds of men, by convincing them that
industry and chearful sobriety are the only
requisites to acquire that happiness, which
despondency, with a disposition of exclaim∣ing
against the times, precludes them from.</P>
<P>Dr. Price's distinctions (p. 379, 380)
between the wild and the civilized state are
well drawn, and his observations on them
are very just: but when he knows that the
natural progression from an infant colony to
a powerful and free nation is always at∣tended
with a proportionate degree of lux∣ury,
why does he lament in print what the
art and power of man cannot prevent? It
is a thesis for a school, but should not have
flowed from the Doctor's pen.</P>
<P>I perfectly agree with Dr. Price (p. 381)
in his opinion of the fatal consequences that
have attended the accumulation of property
in this kingdom, and most sincerely regret
the loss of that set of men who were called
yeomen: but let not the accumulation of
property be blended with the renting of
large farms; its tendency is just the reverse.</P>
<P>By the quotation (p. 381) from Susmilch,
one would imagine it was proposed to adopt
the law of Licinius and Romulus. That po∣licy
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
of the then Romans was wise; it was
when they were a small state, and confined
by their enemies to a small extent of
country: it was then necessary that the
little quantity of land on which they were
to depend for subsistance should be portioned
out in small parcels, in order that each family
might have sufficient to maintain itself; for
then it was not a disgrace to handle the
plough or the spade, though the very men
who did it were to be called out to command
their armies. In a nation like the Romans,
not depending on its manufactures and
commerce, and whose only care is to pro∣vide
corn for itself, perhaps Mr. Muret's
observations, and Licinius's law, may be
the best institution. Upon this principle
too it was that the Spartans did not aim at
raising more corn, though by the hands
of their slaves, than was necessary to main∣tain
a warlike people. But to adopt such a
system in a commercial nation, whose very
commerce depends upon agricultur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is by
no means of a piece with the Doctor's sen∣timents
on other subjects; for supposing
the farmers restricted to seven <HI>jugera,</HI> or
five acres, what could be the produce? The
land would be too little for a plough, and too
much for the spade, as hath been shewn in
p. 3 to 14 of the foregoing sheets, where the
beneficial size of a farm is explained; and in
p. 83, the Doctor will be pleased to observe,
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
that equal care was taken to provide the
seven and the two <HI>jugera</HI> for the cottagers,
who, though not farmers, are, when dis∣posed
of in their proper sphere, equally
necessary and beneficial to a state, as there
will be a greater increase of produce by their
joint labours in one farm, than when each
is to toil for himself on a little spot better
calculated for the labour of his wife and
children. The certain weekly income of
the husband's labour, not attended with
the anxiety of the little farmer, will pro∣cure
more real comfort in his little cottage,
and therefore will be more likely to promote
population. As to the supposed advantages of
the commons, and the means of the cottager's
procuring subsistence from them, that matter
is fully explained in p. 83 and 84; and if by
converting the little farmers into a body of
men who must work for others more labour
is produced, it is an advantage which the
nation should wish for: the compulsion
will be that of honest industry to provide
for a family, which by that means is less
liable to become a burden to the parish,
than that of the little farmer, whose la∣bours,
being attended with constant anxiety
and distress, seldom prosper.</P>
<P>I agree with Dr. Price that more bread
will be consumed, and therefore that more
<PB N="129" REF="133"/>
corn will be grown: but that will be like∣wise
a benefit to the nation; for it will be
by the assistance of the cottager and his
family who are employed in the culture of
the land, instead of loitering away their
time in tending a few starved sheep on the
commons, and cutting furzes. It will en∣able
him to go to market to purchase what
food he pleases, and by the produce being
greater when their joint labours are em∣ployed
on one farm, there will be a surplus
for manufacturers, and by this means manu∣factures,
one of the mines of this nation,
will increase, in proportion to the quantity
of corn produced; but wherever numbers
of men are employed, there will be among
them idle and debauched, who, thanks to
the poors' laws as they now stand, will load
the parish, though not real objects of cha∣rity.</P>
<P>This is the way in which the renting of
large and moderate-sized tracts operates,
(see p. 3 to 14), and this is the way by which
this country has for many years past been
becoming the most powerful in Europe.</P>
<P>I shall grant with Dr. Price, (p. 383) that
what has been suggested will promote til∣lage;
but how it is to account for the fact
which he immediately alludes to in 1697,
<PB N="130" REF="134"/>
namely, that when wheat was at 3<HI>l.</HI> and
exportation went on, and yet that there was
no clamour, I know not; unless it proves
that the exportation of corn, which then
first took place in consequence of the wise
law that was passed in 1689 for granting a
bounty, inspired the Poor with industry,
which kept their minds peaceable and sober;
whereas there now prevails among the
lower class of people a licentiousness which
has been, in a great measure, occasioned by
the numberless publications on the causes of
scarcity, too evidently calculated to inflame
their minds.</P>
<P>Dr. Price attributes the abovementioned
patience in the Poor to the then cheapness of
other food. I allow that this might natu∣rally
enough have been the consequence,
had the fact been so: but, from the best
authority I can procure, which is the account
of the prices of beef as contracted for from
time to time by the Victualling-Office, it
appears, that in 1697, the time alluded to,
the commissioners of that office contracted
at 25<HI>s. per C. wt.</HI> which is nearly the same
they do now; but what is more remarkable,
is, that the average of the five preceding
and five following years was only 23<HI>s.</HI> 1<HI>d.
per C. wt.</HI> and in 1697, Pork was at 31<HI>s.
per C. wt.</HI> However, this was undoubtedly
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
cheaper in proportion than bread: but it
was a natural consequence, for agriculture
at that time, I mean the plough, was but in
its infancy; herds and pasture still pre∣vailed;
and from the uncertainty which the
people had been accustomed to in the great
variation of the price of corn, it is no
wonder they were in the habit of living
more on meat, which had ever been plenti∣ful,
as herds and flocks had been their
riches; and as little surprizing is it that
they, in 1697, still continued in the use of
meat for their chief support. The very
fame custom still prevails in the islands and
all along the North-West coast of Scotland.</P>
<P>In regard to the Doctor's observation on the
great difference there was in the price of
meat and corn during the last century, when
he acknowledges that corn was dearer than
it has been at an average for these last 40
years, but that meat was about half its
present price; it only proves, that his ar∣gument
can have no reference to the present
times, and that that great difference in the
price of meat and corn was occasioned by
this country's having been, during almost
the whole century, distracted by civil wars,
which must be a check to the plough, and
encourage herds and flocks, the only move∣able
riches of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136"/>
The Doctor says, that beef and pork were
sold at 2½ and three pounds for a penny at
the same time that wheat was sold at 7<HI>s.</HI> and
8<HI>s.</HI> per quarter, and that bore the same pro∣portion
to the price of corn as it would bear
now were this at about 4<HI>l.</HI> per quarter. This
assertion must certainly be intended to prove,
that either corn is too cheap, or meat too
dear; but, in my opinion, it proves neither;
for every commodity will bear a value in
proportion to its plenty and the demand for
it. It is incontestably proved in history,
that the plenty of meat was in proportion to
the scarcity of corn; consequently the price
must vary in the same proportion; but when
a demand for each is equal, and the plenty
of each is the same, the value of the one
must fall, or that of the other rise, till they
come on a par, and that value will always
be according to the value of money: if
therefore the price of corn is nearly what
it ought to be, which can only be deter∣mined
by the proportion that the value of
land bears to the value of money, it is as
evident, that meat ought to rise in the same
proportion: but the only method of ascer∣taining
what should be the price of the one
for it to be in proportion to that of the
other, is to allot a certain sum of money to
the raising of corn, and an equal sum to the
rearing and fattening of cattle; an equal
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
profit will determine the real value of each.
If this was done, I am pretty certain it
would appear that the present prices are
nearly equal, and that meat has not risen
in too great proportion; nor will it be
found, if we consider the value of money
and of land, that provisions are greatly
above what they ought to be. Indeed this
is pretty clearly demonstrated by the Doctor's
own tables: I call them his, because I can∣not
find the corn-tables carried down lower
than 1766 on any other authority than his;
he extends them to 1772, and makes the
average from 1766 to 1772, 2<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>
This is evidently higher than the preceding
average; though not so much as I should
have expected. However, this difference
is clearly accounted for by a very remark∣able
circumstance, which is, that it is the
exact period during which this country has
had successive bad crops. It likewise shews,
that scarcity is the real, as it is the natural
cause of the present high prices, and that
these are therefore not to be attributed to the
various causes which some have as wickedly,
as others have ignorantly, pretended to
point out. Whichever of these may have
been the motive, both of them are fraught
with the same evil tendency of stirring up
riot and confusion. That the prices are too
high for the Poor at this moment, I confess;
<PB N="134" REF="138"/>
and the cause of their being so is evident;
it proceeds from the general calamity that
has attended trade during this last year; a
calamity which has occasioned a general
consternation among all ranks of people.
The general diffidence that now prevails,
and the doubt which the merchant has of
not receiving his remittances, makes him
cautious in giving fresh orders, and tardy in
his payments to the manufacturer: the
manufacturer must, in consequence of this,
in the same manner treat those from whom
he purchases his materials, and cease to
employ so many hands as before. By this
chain of circumstances, the hardship must
ultimately fall upon the labourer dependant
on such manufactures, who, though he
could afford to maintain himself and family
well at the wages he now earns, if he was
in constant employ, must certainly feel the
weight of the present prices of necessaries,
which are on this account, and on this only,
too high. What I have said of the manu∣facturer,
may equally hold good with regard
to the common labourer; for undoubt∣edly
the late scanty harvest has deprived
many threshers of their winter's work, and
I can believe that many hands which before
found employment in supplying the luxu∣ries
and pleasures of life, both in town and
country, may, in consequence of the ap∣prehension
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
that has seized every one, now
want work: but this is a momentary evil.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this subject without pointing
out one glaring fault: it is, that the ave∣rage
which has occasioned this clamour
does not arrive at the price when ex∣portation
is allowed with bounty; and
it must be supposed that the bounty's
being fixed at any price, must imply that
such price should be under the general
average of the whole country; whereas
Dr. Price's elucidation of this matter clearly
demonstrates, that the opening or shutting
of the port, and the giving or taking off
the bounty, depend solely on the artificial
price of Bear-key. There cannot be a clearer
proof than this, that restrictions in any trade
must ever subject the Legislature to be mis∣led
by intersted designing men: it like∣wise
proves, that restrictions naturally
create the very monopoly which they are
meant to guard against; and thus shews
the absolute necessity of a perfect freedom
in trade in general, but most especially in
that of corn.</P>
<P>In regard to what the Doctor says (page
388) on the inclosures of the common-fields
in Leicestershire, from whence he
concludes that the increase of tillage there is
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
at an end, I shall briefly observe, that it
greatly surprized me, as being diametrically
contrary to every day's experience. I make
no doubt but that the Doctor had that in∣formation;
but I would advise a cautious
inquiry into the validity of the authority,
before he, whose character as an author is
in such high repute, ventures to assert so
palpable an absurdity: but granting the
fact, the only observation I can make upon
it is, that the land is in very unskilful
hands. In regard to Northamptonshire
inclosure, I can speak with some degree of
knowledge, and notwithstanding the re∣marks
of the sensible author alluded to, I
know farmers who have chearfully sub∣mitted
to have their rents doubled on the
inclosure of the common-field land, though
intended to be kept under the plough,
saying, that they must now become better
farmers, and not continue such slovens.
That laying down many of these inclosures
to grass has prevailed, I shall not disallow,
and such tracts must consequently bear the
face of depopulation: however, the men
are not lost, but perhaps, with the ground,
better employed; not but that, as an indi∣vidual,
I should, upon my own estate, lay
a certain restriction in the allotment of pa∣sture
and arable; but how far commissioners
ought to be intrusted with such a charge, I
shall not presume to say.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="141"/>
With regard to the quotation from Lord
Bacon, it is not applicable to the present
times, and I think I have sufficiently
exposed, in the foregoing sheets, the ab∣surdity
of owners holding the plough
themselves, at a time when corn is, or
ought to be, esteemed part of the trade
and wealth of this great nation. Dr. Price's
farther quotations (page 391 and 392 of
this work) are fully answered by the his∣tory
of the times. Herds and cattle were
formerly the only riches, and the free ex∣portation
of wool occasioned those mono∣polies
of land and sheep which were found
to be of evil tendency: a few men could
tend great numbers, and the rest of the
rustic tribe were unemployed; for, by the
exportation of the raw wool, there could be
no woollen manufactories. On this account
it was, that in 1537, flocks were stinted
to 2000, and tenements were to be erected
on a given number of acres: but yet were
people so averse to agriculture, that it was
necessary to set a fine on laying down arable
ground to pasture. In those days agricul∣ture,
I mean the plough, was esteemed of
such consequence to the nation, that it had
not only every encouragement, but was
even inforced; whereas now that it has
arrived to a degree of perfection, it is the
fashion of the times to be jealous of its
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>
prosperity, and to load it with every incum∣brance;
in short, all the acts which passed,
and are here alluded to, were intended only
to people a country laid waste and depo∣pulated
by civil wars: but such restrictions
now would be altogether absurd. In re∣gard
to the Doctor's observations in page
393, I shall say, that every one was culti∣vating
for his own wants, as our author
justly observes is now the case in the inte∣rior
parts of America: but I am happy to
think that in these days this nation will
vye with Holland to supply all Europe
with corn, either directly, or through the
bowels of our manufacturers. As to the
proportion of the price of labour, it can
bear no comparison; for if no labour was
wanted, there could be no price; nor is a
comparison to be drawn with the present
time, when, owing to successive bad crops,
corn has risen a little. But it may not be
unworthy of notice, that in the circum∣stance
of the price of labour's not being
increased in the proportion of the price of
provisions, the Doctor's assertion corrobo∣rates
what is said in the valuable works of
Mr. Arthur Young, and will, I hope, pa∣cify
the minds of those who imagine that
the dearness of provisions must ruin our
manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="143"/>
As to the circumstance (page 394 of Dr.
Price) of the ranks of men being altered,
I agree and lament the fact with the Doctor:
but perhaps we do not mean the same class
of men. I most truly lament the loss of
our yeomenry, that set of men who really
kept up the independance of this nation;
and sorry I am to see their lands now in
the hands of monopolizing Lords, tenanted
out to small farmers, who hold their leases
on such conditions as to be little better than
vassals ready to attend a summons on every
mischievous occasion.</P>
<P>With regard to the class called Hire∣lings,
I believe they are mostly in the
same state as they were, with the benefit of
work at present, instead of being prowling
about commons and wastes; and as to the
luxury which the Doctor talks of, it has
been and ever will be an attendant on a
wealthy free people, and, with the riches,
diffuses itself through all ranks of people;
it is one of those evils which cannot be
avoided, and therefore is needless to la∣ment.</P>
<P>It is true that the lower people pay their
proportion of the taxes, that is to say, of
those taxes which are levied by affize, for
then they fall always on the consumer:
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>
for example, the currier who pays the tax,
charges it to the shoemaker, and the shoe∣maker
lays it on the labourer, who, deal∣ing
in an article that is not assizeable (his
labour) cannot raise the price of it to the
farmer; therefore the tax falls on him:
but though it may not appear visible to
every eye, I will maintain, that an equal
proportion of it falls on the wealthy; for
the rich man, who spends the whole of his
income, by consuming a greater quantity
of assizeable commodities, pays his just pro∣portion
of the tax.</P>
<P>It is likewise true, that the lower people
fight the battles of a nation: but, as Sir
James Stewart rightly says, it is from the
free hands, the manufacturers and artifi∣cers,
that our armies are recruited, and not
from the cottager and small farmer that
such drafts are, or ought to be made.</P>
<P>The reasoning of the author of <HI>The En∣quiry</HI>
concerning the comparison which
ought to be made between the prices of
corn since the bounty, and during the reign
of James I. cannot be just, because they
are founded either on false or imperfect
facts: he thinks the latter period should be
taken, because it was peaceable, commerce
increased, and all the influence which the
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
riches of America could produce on the
prices of corn and provisions had taken
place: but the reign of Charles I. except∣ing
the years 1642, 3, 4, and 5, (the prices
of which do not come into his account)
ought for the same reasons to be taken:
they also were peaceable, and commerce
had increased. The average of these two
periods should therefore be taken, and in
that case the foundation of our author's
reasoning falls to the ground. But in the
conduct of it he contradicts himself: under
the reign of James I. he says, <HI>the influence
of American money had taken full effect;</HI>
under that of Charles I. <HI>that the great plenty
of money had risen the price of superior pro∣visions;</HI>
consequently the increase of money
had <HI>not</HI> taken its full effect. But whether
the reign of Charles or James should be
taken is not essential, since, in just reason∣ing,
we should take neither; for no com∣parison
can be made between periods in
which the <HI>interest</HI> and consequently the
<HI>quantity</HI> of money is so extremely different,
being more than 50 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Enquiry</HI> (p. 93) speak∣ing
of the bounty, says, employing so large
a proportion of our cultivated lands must
straiten the means of raising every other
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
kind of provision to such a degree that the
utmost exertion of the Poor cannot reach
them, and the people must be obliged either
to desert the country, or enhance the price
of labour.</P>
<P>Upon this I shall observe, that the most
material fact in the whole Enquiry is against
him; I mean, the fall in the price of corn
since the bounty was given, a fall which every
one of his tables sufficiently proves, and of
which we see the consequence in the people's
not having deserted their country: on the
contrary, we have received great accessions
from every quarter of the globe; and as to
the rise in the price of labour, it has risen
all over Europe, as well as in England, and
ought to rise, as well as all commodities,
with the increase of money.</P>
<P>But as our author attempts to enforce the
result of his tables by an estimate drawn up
of the farmer's expences, produce, and
profit on 10 acres, which he would prove
to amount to 68 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI> for
four successive years; he will permit me to
set him right, in some essential points,
which can only be done by stating a true
account of the expences and product of
such a course as he lays down.

By the above estimate, which I believe
nearest the truth, it will appear, that the
farmer may clear about 12 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI>
in four years: but from this should be
deducted the interest of his money for the
greatest part of the expences of the
wheat crop, which was expended the first
year; and I will venture to say, that with
such an execrable course of husbandry, it
is full as much as any farmer makes: but
this does no more than prove that very
little dependence is to be made on such
calculations. All that is meant by this
refutation, is only to expose the fallacy of
such calculations, from whence such false
arguments are deduced. Whether done by
design, or through ignorance, they have
the same mischievous effect of inflaming
the minds of men; and as the whole of
this author's arguments depends on such
false principles, I shall not think his sub∣sequent
observations worthy my notice, but
conclude with a hint to those who are biassed
by his reasoning, to enquire carefully into
the truth of the facts which serve him for
the basis of his arguments.</P>
