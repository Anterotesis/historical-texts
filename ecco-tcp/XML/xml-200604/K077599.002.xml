this year are more curious than important. The Scotish Jacoâˆ£bites
were resolved to risk every thing to prevent the union, and the
consequent success of the succession in the protestant line. The French
had given them some expectations of support; but the battles of Ramilâˆ£lies
and Turin disconcerted all their measures. The French King deâˆ£clared
that he could spare neither men nor money at present; but that
he would search for a more favourable conjuncture to give them the aid
they required. The Tories in England were more cautious than the Jaâˆ£cobites
of Scotland. They wished for the restoration of the excluded
family; but they were unwilling to agree to any attempt, during the life
of Queen Anne. They held no direct communication with the court of
St. Germains. The agents of that court, however, had access, as usual,
to Marlborough and Godolphin, who seemed to give private assurances
of zeal for the Pretender, when they, particularly the former, publickly
avowed their attachment to the house of Hannover, while both promoted
the succession in the protestant line. It appears that the excluded family
had turned their eyes, as early as the present year, towards the King of
Sweden; who, by possessing himself of Saxony, and dethroning King
Augustus, became, in some measure, the umpire of the affairs of Euâˆ£rope.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Caâˆ£ryll's Letters, vol. v. fol. Scotch Colâˆ£lege. February 21.</NOTE>"THIS is to let you know that your cousin Wisely [the King] is
very well pleased with the care you take to preserve her right in
reversion upon her kinswoman's [Queen Anne's] death; and she very
well approves of the method you propose of consulting with Mr. Goulâˆ£ston
[Godolphin] concerning what is best to be done in it: considering
all present circumstances, without doubt that lawyer is better able than
any other, both to advise and to act effectually in this affair, if he were
willing to undertake it. But of that I must doubt, considering his beâˆ£haviour
in your cousin's former claim of right to her estate in possession;
however, your cousin gives you full commission to act and proceed in the
way you shall think best for his interest. And when you have consulted
the above-named lawyer, you will be better able to take your measures,
and to inform your cousin how matters are likely to go.</P>
<P><DATE>March 21.</DATE> What you now write concerning that part of the quit-rents
which are lately become due to your cousin Wisely [the King]
sufficiently shews her undoubted right to them according to law; but I
fear there will be many difficulties, not easy to overcome, that will obâˆ£struct
her getting possession of them, through the neglect of her trustee,
of which we shall know more, when you have conferred with Mr. Goulâˆ£ston
[Godolphin] about it. Your cousin's title is certainly good in law,
both against Young [princess Anne] and against that other person [Hanâˆ£nover]
whose name I forgot, who at present, as you say, puts in a claim.
I am glad to hear you say that those who have long since so often proâˆ£mised
to pay Plessington's [the King's] debts, make steps as if they did
design to be honest at last; though I do not find that you have had any
fresh assurance from Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough] or Mr. Gilburn
[Godolphin], who I know are full of other business at present.</P>
<P><DATE>April 5.</DATE> What I hear concerning Hanmer [Hannover] and his
knight [Sir Rowland Gwyne] is very extraordinary, and I believe will
make some division in Wanley's [the Whigs] family, of which some are
for joining immediately in company with the merchant Hanmer [Hanâˆ£nover],
and others of them, with Mr. Brag [in the parliament] have pubâˆ£licly
appeared against it. I also believe that those few of Kenzy's
relations [Tories], that stood up for Hanmer [Hannover], have done
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
but little good either to Hanmer [Hannover] or to themselves. It is
very probable, as you say, that the two merchants, Goulston [Godolâˆ£phin]
and Armsworth [Marlborough] have had a great hand in all this,
but whether with an honest intention of paying their old debts or not,
time must show. You are much in the right not to move in the busiâˆ£ness
of the quit-rents, lately fallen in, whilst Mr. Brag [parliament] is
in town, and that will come on better next term. In the mean time,
you may have opportunity of consulting with Mr. Goulston [Godolphin]
about it, and as you may find him disposed, you may make a pretty
near guess of the success of that and of other matters.</P>
<P><DATE>April 25.</DATE> I should be very glad to hear of your having had some
communication with Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough] about the old
debts, before his going into the country [abroad]; but if that cannot be,
I hope at least that something will be said about that matter to captain
Gourdon [colonel Sackville], of which I suppose you will have an acâˆ£count.</P>
<P><DATE>June 6.</DATE> I find that your kinsman, Mr. Wisely [the King], is very
well pleased with the way in which you proceed about the recovery of
that part of the quit-rents lately fallen in, and applying them to the
payment of the debts formerly contracted. As to the success of this
matter, much will depend upon the honesty of Mr. Young's solicitor,
[the princess of Denmark's minister] Goulston [Godolphin], for he has in
his hands wherewithall to clear that matter, and therefore a seasonable
application ought to be made to him.</P>
<P>Being a person concerned in these debts, though I can pretend no
great skill in the law, yet I should be glad these queries might be made
to those that are of Wisely's [Queen's] council: 1st, Whether Wisely
has not at present a clear title in law, as it now stands, to those quit-rents?
2dly, And if so, whether he may not make them over to some
trustees, for the payment of those debts, by a deed that will stand good
in law? This I mention because I do not see, at present, how the title
is devolved from Wisely [the King] to Young [Queen Anne]; but you
that are upon the place can better judge of these matters.</P>
<P><DATE>June 28.</DATE> In your last you gave full satisfaction to the two queâˆ£ries
I had put to you in mine of the sixth of June; so that nothing
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
otherwise is to be done in the business of the quit-rents than according to
the plan laid down by you, by the advice of counsel upon the place
for, as you say, Mr. Brag [parliament] is a very angry gentleman naturally,
and his bitterness ought not to be stirred. Mr. Manning's [the King of
France] affairs have gone so much backwards of late, that there is little
hope of his being able to lay down the sum necessary to redeem the
mortgage (an army for an invasion), so that we must necessarily make
the best of the promises given, by those other merchants, which you
know have been such, as no honest man could make and not perform,
when able to do so. Nor is there, at present, any question to be made
of their ability, having almost all the trade in their hands; so that, if
they fail in the performance, the shame will be theirs, and the loss
will be ours."</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">"First, An account of the standing forces, now actually in the kingdom."</HEAD>
<P>"THE earl of Leven, commander in chief and master of the ordâˆ£nance,
a notorious whig and Hannoverian. The earl of Lothian,
major general, such as the commander in chief, but of less capacity.
James Maitland, major general, a soldier since he was a man; and if his
capacity is as good as his experience is long, he may be a good officer.
He is thought to have some good inclinations; and it is presumed he
may be treated with.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
The regiment of guards, without a colonel since Ramsay's death,
consists of 16 companies, each company 40 men, including serjeants,
corporals, and drums, is 640.</P>
<P>The earl of Dalhousie, first lieutenant colonel, a young man with a
very small estate, no good manager, has debts, and sometimes forced to
take sanctuary in the abbey of Holyrood-House; but being of a loyal
family and so educated, it is presumed he has good inclinations; and it
may be reasonably expected, that the King's presence will draw him, and
all such to his Majesty's interest and service. The other lieutenant colonel
â€”Stewart, brother to the earl of Galloway, is thought to have good
inclinations; and to my certain knowledge, he was for the grand resolve.
The major and following officers of this regiment, are reputed well
affected; Thomas Hamilton, second major, John Murray, James Scott,
John Hamilton, William Sharp,â€”Scott,â€”Stewart, captains; William
Murray and James Ogilvie, lieutenants; the first two captains, and
the two lieutenants, I know to be so.</P>
<P>The troop of horse guards, commanded by the earl of Argyle, conâˆ£sists
of 100 gentlemen; at least, should be so.</P>
<P>The lord Forbes, first lieutenant, a bigotted whig, little sense, little
estate, and disloyal. My lord Ballantyne, the other lieutenant, one of a
very ordinary capacity and little or no estate; at the revolution, and for
several years after, was esteemed very loyal; but having squandered a
good estate, and falling in with the duke of Queensberry, he bought him,
at the price of his post. Mr. John Kerr, the first cornet, such as the
captain; the other Archibald Douglas, was at and after the Revolution
thought very loyal, and is still reputed well affected; but much under
the influence of the duke of Queensberry. I am credibly informed, that
many of the gentlemen of the troop are well affected.</P>
<P>Two troops, or companies of grenadiers, on horseback; each consistâˆ£ing
of 30 men, ranked as guards, 60.</P>
<P>The earl of Crawford, colonel, a good-natured man, and brave; has
little or no estate, and influenced by the earl of Arran. The captains of
<HI>(some words illegible)</HI> lord Cumberland, oldest son to the earl of
Balcarras, andâ€”Chrichton, heir male to the late earl of Dumfries.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15"/>
The first is a very young gentleman, that seems to promise no great
things; the other is thought to have some good inclinations towards the
King.</P>
<P>Major general Maitland's regiment, in the garrison of Inverlochy, conâˆ£sists
(as I remember) of twelve companies; each company 40 men, inâˆ£cluding
serjeants, corporals, and drums, 480.</P>
<P>Robert Keith, first lieutenant colonel. I have known him from my
infancy. He always was before, and at the Revolution, very loyal; but I
think, since that unhappy time, he is much corrupted in his principles; yet,
at the same time, I judge his old imbibed loyalty is not entirely wore out,
but that he may be retrieved; and, if I am commanded or permitted,
I will use my best endeavours to persuade and engage him to his duty;
for I know he has a great friendship for me, and will not deceive me.
The other lieutenant colonel of this regiment, is Mr. Patrick Ogilvie,
second son to the earl of Findlater, who will always be such as his broâˆ£ther,
at least so long as he is chancellor. Yet he has many times, with
great asseverations, said, that he never would do any thing against the
King's interest. Other officers of that regiment I know not; but in
general, I am informed, that some of them are well affected, and it is
presumed, many of the common soldiers are so, because most of them
are Highlandmen, and of consequence thought loyal.</P>
<P>Lord Strathnaver's regiment of foot, consists of 10 companies; each
company 30 men, including serjeants, corporals, and drums, is 300.</P>
<P>This colonel is a very young man, and his father, the earl of Sutherâˆ£land,
being of ill principles, it may reasonably be presumed he is so.
Yet I am told by some of his relations, that he is much better disposed
than his father. The earl of Glencairn, lieutenant colonel, I know is
loyally inclined; and I have it from most unquestionable authors, that
he has often said, he never would do any thing against the King, and,
as I remember, he voted the grand resolution; and several captains and
subalterns in the regiment are reputed well affected.</P>
<P>The laird of Grant, younger; his regiment is in companies, and numâˆ£ber
of men, the same with Strathnaver's, 300.</P>
<P>The colonel before he got the regiment, was reputed loyal; but since
he had it, by Argyle's procurement, he is considered, as much influenced
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
by that lord. Bruce of Kennith, the lieutenant colonel, is reputed
loyal, as are several other officers in that regiment.</P>
<P>The earl of Lothian's regiment of dragoons, as I remember, consists
of six companies; each company, including serjeants, corporal, and
drum, is 30 men, 180.</P>
<P>The colonel's character is already given. The lieutenant colonel is
son to Pollwarth, now called earl of Marchmont; when the late earl of
Hume listed, this lieutenant colonel was thought well affected, and very
much under the influence of Hume; but what to say of him now, I
know not.</P>
<P>The major of this regiment, John Johnston, of Westraw, is reputed
to have loyal inclinations, being much managed that way by his very
loyal lady; but he is much under the influence of his chief, the earl of
Annandale, whom few of any side must trust.</P>
<P>The Master of Carmichael's regiment of dragoons is, in troops and
number of men, every way the same with Lothian's, 180.</P>
<P>This colonel, like his father, my lord Carmichael, now called earl
Hyndford, is considered as not well affected to the King's interest, and
his lieutenant colonelâ€”Wishart far less; being a bigotted whig, the
son of a minister of that pernicious tribe. But Pollock of that ilk, the
major, though he is something whiggishly inclined, Kilmaronock tells me,
that he has often, with great asseverations, said to him, that when the
King comes, he shall have him and his troop; and this is all the loyalty
I know in this regiment, except one lieutenant Graham, who I know to
be well affected.</P>
<P>Three independent companies, for suppressing the Highland thieves
and robbers; each company 100 men, 300.</P>
<P>The first independent company is commanded by captain Campbell, of
Finnab; such as his chief, Argyle.</P>
<P>The second independent company, commanded by captain William
Grant; generally reputed loyal.</P>
<P>The third independent company, commanded by major M<SUP>c</SUP>Kenzie;
reputed loyal.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17"/>
The castle of Edinburgh, commanded by earl of Leven, governor.
The garrison, as I remember, consists of 100.</P>
<P>The governor's character is already given.</P>
<P>The lieutenant-governor, colonel James Stuart, one that was bred in
Dumbarton's regiment, and before and at the Revolution was esteemed
very loyal, and is still reputed to have loyal inclinations, but is a little
influenced by the duke of Queensberry.</P>
<P>Major Cout, the lieutenant of the company, is a most bigotted whig,
and reputed very disloyal.</P>
<P>The castle of Stirling is commanded by the earl of Mar, governor.
The garrison consists of 100 men.</P>
<P>What to say of the governor I know not well. He was much reâˆ£puted
to have loyal inclinations; and to my certain knowledge, very
much courted by the earl of Arran, to be brought entirely in, both to
the interest of the King and country, and Arran once thought himself
sure of him. But, last session of parliament, when the duke of Queensâˆ£berry
came to Scotland, he no sooner came, but he drew Mar from
the country party, with the bait of secretary of state.</P>
<P>The lieutenant governor is colonel John Erskine; one that is supposed
will always be for what the court has a mind to, so long as he enjoys
any tolerable good post. Butâ€”Shaw, of Saughy, lieutenant of the
company, is reputed to have loyal inclinations.</P>
<P>The castle of Dumbarton is commanded by Master Archibald Campâˆ£bell,
brother to Argyle. Who is the lieutenant, I know not; but the
garrison, I think, consists of 60 men.</P>
<P>The castle of Blackness is commanded by the earl of Buchan, lately
made governor; and the garrison, as I suppose, consists of about 60
men; but who the lieutenant is, I know not.</P>
<P>The number of the whole forces, in field and garrison, 2860.</P>
<P>This account of the forces is calculated according to the establishment;
but cannot be reckoned effectually 2500, at the highest.</P>

with disloyalty. The present earl is in France; and the affairs of that
family are under the conduct of Mr. James Seaton, a most loyal gentleâˆ£man,

bold loyal man, and of good parts, is very significant in parliament, and
always with the country party."</Q> Collington, lord of Session, in the late

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>"IT is unnecessary to prove the utility of having a free communicaâˆ£tion
between separate dominions. Now the duke of Hannover,
who will have none with his territories in Germany, when he is master
of England, will think himself obliged, and even under a necessity, to
find this advantage of a communication, and to employ all sorts of means
to establish it; and his conscience will be no obstacle to him, as he will
justly think, that he will have as much right to any other country as he
has to England.</P>
<P>As a bridge of boats is thrown over rivers, vessels are employed for
the same purpose at sea; and, in order to employ them to keep up a
communication between England and the territories of Hannover, the
duke of Hannover must have a maritime province to join his dominions,
and he will find none but that of Bremen.</P>
<P>The same reasons which will induce the family of Hannover to seize
on the country of Bremen, should alarm the King of Denmark for the
safety of Holstein and Oldenburgh, without which that family will not
be master of the Elbe and the Weser; not to mention the ancient enmity
between these two powers, which appeared on all occasions, and lately at
the treaty of Travendal. Any regard he may have had for the present
establishment in England should have ceased, at the death of the prince,
his uncle, without children; and now, instead of establishing an enemy,
it depends entirely upon him to re-establish the King of England, his
near relation, and thereby engage him still more strongly from a prinâˆ£ciple
of gratitude and from ties of blood, to be invariably in his interest.</P>
<P>The elector of Brandenbugh likewise may allow himself to be carried
away by the hopes of having for his share Pomerania, to which he preâˆ£tends
a right of succession, as well as conveniency, and a powerful addiâˆ£tion
to support his royalty.</P>
<P>The elector of Saxony will require no other motive for entering into
this plan, but revenge and an irreconcilable hatred.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="37"/>
It is not to be doubted but the King of Sweden will be persuaded that
these things merit serious reflections; and that he will find no other means
so effectual for preventing the calamities with which he is threatened, as
to employ all his force to re-establish the King of England; and there is
reason to hope, that he will make no difficulty of contributing to this,
when he will see that prudence, justice, and glory, concur in it.</P>
<P>The means of executing so great and so noble an enterprise will be
explained, when the King of Sweden chooses to enter into a treaty."</P>

<HEAD>1706.</HEAD>
<P>THE Whigs, by intimidating Godolphin, had procured the influâˆ£ence
of government in the elections for members of the new parâˆ£liament,
which met, for the first time, on the twenty-fifth of October,
1705. Finding themselves the majority, John Smith, one of their own
party, was chosen speaker of the house of commons, notwithstanding the
vehement opposition of the Tories. William Cowper, a man of heavy and
confused parts, but who was attached to the same principles, was made, by
their influence, keeper of the great seal; and in general, the whole curâˆ£rent
of preferment ran through the same channel. The Tories, vexed at
the loss of their influence, acted a part which exhibited a curious speciâˆ£men
of that glaring inconsistency of conduct, into which the spirit of
party has too often betrayed mankind. To harass their political oppoâˆ£nents,
they endeavoured to take possession of their ground; and though
they were supposed to be enemies to the succession of the house of Hanâˆ£nover,
the lord Haversham, as the mouth of the party, moved, in the
house of lords, for an address to the Queen, to invite the princess Soâˆ£phia
into England. The motion was rejected by the Whigs, who then
possessed the whole influence of government. There were, however,
brought in two bills, which were deemed a great security to the proteâˆ£stant
succession: the first, appointing a regency on the event of the
Queen's death; and the second for naturalizing the princess Sophia, and
the issue of her body, being protestants.</P>
<P>The opposition of the Whigs to the invitation to the princess Sophia,
having raised suspicions against their attachment to the house of Hannoâˆ£ver,
the party endeavoured to take to themselves the whole merit of the
<PB N="26" REF="39"/>
securities in savour of the succession, which had passed in the present
session of parliament. The lord Halifax, one of their number, was sent
with the acts of regency and naturalization to Hannover; and he carried
along with him letters from all the leaders of the Whigs, expressive of
their sincere attachment to the succession of the electoral family. The
increase in the correspondence with Hannover, together with the zeal
expressed in the letters, form a kind of proof that the succession of
the princess Sophia and her posterity, began then, for the first time, to
acquire a degree of certainty. The Queen, perhaps justly, was suspected
of having no intentions of that kind; and her minister, the lord Godolâˆ£phin,
had been uniformly in the interest of the exiled family, though,
by a happy timidity, he at last, in a manner, ensured success to their
rivals. He, however, was so true to his principles, that, though he
aided, with all the weight of government, the acts of regency and natuâˆ£ralization,
he never took merit to himself from that circumstance, nor
entered into any correspondence with the house of Hannover. The prinâˆ£cipal
events, connected with the correspondence of this year, are the
complimentary embassy of the lord Halifax, the treaty guaranteeing the
protestant succession concluded with the States General, the treaty of
Union then carrying on between the two kingdoms, the battle of Ramilâˆ£lies,
the subsequent conquest of Flanders, the victory before Turin, and
the evacuation of Italy by the house of Bourbon.</P>

which you got approved of at the Hague, for putting King Charles and
prince Eugene in a condition to act offensively the next campaign. It is

project, joined to the care which yon have taken to bring it to a happy

<P>"With regard to the affair of Lubec, you are too well informed not
to see that it would be as much my interest as the interest of the rest of
the allies, to see it terminated amicably, by an accommodation. But if
this cannot be soon done, in a manner with which the administration may
be satisfied, I leave you to judge if it will be possible to control the
King of Sweden, and if I can dispense with fulfilling the engagements
into which I entered personally, concerning the bishopric of Lubec, and
those to which the guarantee of the treaty of Travendahl binds me.
Being joined in this guarantee with her Majesty, and with Holland, I
doubt not but in that case they will concur with me, in making the
house of Gottorp sensible of its good effects, in an efficacious manner."</P>
<P>"You have, no doubt, been informed already, that the troops have
been withdrawn by both parties from the city of Eutin, and from the whole
bishopric; and that the Danes are returned home, after having dislodged
the troops of the administrator; so that the only thing to be done now
is, to support that prince in the civil possession, and in the administration
of the bishopric, under the guarantee of the same powers who are guaâˆ£rantees
of the treaty of Travendahl. I hope that her Majesty will not
only contribute to this, but also, by her influence, determine the States
General to join her in so salutary an undertaking. I beseech you, Sir,
to be so good as to give all your attentions to this, as the affair is of imâˆ£portance

<P>"THE dutchess of Marlborough shewed me a letter she received
from Mrs. Howe, which appears to me to contain an affair of
so much consequence, that I think myself obliged, as a good Englishâˆ£man,
and as a faithful servant to your Electoral Highness, to commuâˆ£nicate
it to you. It contains, that all that has been done in England this
winter, for establishing the protestant succession, and for testifying reâˆ£spect
and attentions to your electoral family, is, in the opinion of the
electress, of so little consequence, that she considers it, at most, as a
mere compliment; and that, for that reason, it will be more agreeable to
her, that the acts of parliament may be sent to Hannover without any
ceremony, and that the garter which the Queen has given to the elecâˆ£toral
prince, may be sent merely by a herald."</P>
<P>"These sentiments, concerning what hath been done here, are altogether
different from those, which every one in England, who has ever shewn
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
any zeal for the protestant succession, entertains of it. It is for this
reason, I am not able to reflect upon this affair, without a great
deal of uneasiness. The parliament have redressed several very essential
defects in the laws, which regarded a protestant succession. They have
provided against all accidents which human prudence could foresee, and
they have put the government, in the time of the successor, on the same
footing which it is at present, during the reign of the Queen. These
things are considered here, as affairs of the last importance, and as the
most real and essential marks that could be given of a true zeal for the
protestant succession."</P>
<P>"With regard to the act of naturalization of the electoral family, it has
been declared to be absolutely necessary, by the unanimous opinion of all
the judges, who are the best guides in an affair of that nature. With reâˆ£gard
to the proposal of inviting the electress over to England immediâˆ£ately,
when it is considered, by what fort of men it was made, in what
manner, and at what time, there was reason to hope, that a proposal of
that nature would not be better received by the electress, than it has
been in England. There is no one so capable of judging of all this
affair, as your electoral Highness, and you only can set it before the
electress in the proper light. This is what I beseech you to be pleased
to do, for the good of England and of the protestant succession. I canâˆ£not
make a better excuse for the liberty I have taken, than the true zeal
and attachment which I have for your service, being with great respect

<P>WHEN I was first, by her Majesty's great goodness, raised to the
station I am now in, I could not persuade myself, that a subject
of so little importance, would have then excused my presumption in
troubling your electoral highness in this manner upon that occasion,
though with the sincerest assurances, that my heart should ever continue
most firmly devoted to the service of your E. H. and your E. H. seâˆ£rene
house. But now, since I hope it is allowable for me, to express to
your E. H. the very great satisfaction I have with every good Englishâˆ£man,
received from the effectual securities lately provided by the parliaâˆ£ment,
for the protestant succession to the crown of England; I beg leave
humbly to present to your E. H. at the same time, his most faithful proâˆ£fession
of a most ardent zeal for your E. H. prosperity, and promise
never to neglect any thing in my little power, that may possibly conduce
to it; being fully persuaded, it is impossible to be in the true interest of
England and not to be a fast friend to that succession, which the sense of
the kingdom hath so often declared to be its only defence from the most
deplorable condition a people can be reduced to. I was one of those,
who have had the honour, for a long time past, constantly to have adâˆ£hered
to that opinion, for excluding a Romish successor, even while it
was unfashionable and decried by those that were in authority; and thereâˆ£fore,
that the same persons should now continue firm to the same, when
it is owned by the legislative authority and the general bent of the peoâˆ£ple,
can admit, I think, of no question. This I chose to mention, as an
evidence of my sincerity in what I profess, rather than multiply exâˆ£pressions,
which are in every one's power to make; not that I am at all
apprehensive of those endeavours which have been used to render your
E. H. and your E. H. serene house disgusted, with those who have the
truest concern for your service; since it is impossible, that so excellent a
judgment as that of your E. H. should ever prefer the surprizing starts of
a sudden unaccountable zeal, contrary to known principles, affected
merely for popularity, and shewing itself in one particular only, (while
all other means tending to the same are neglected) to a steady, uninterâˆ£rupted,
<PB N="33" REF="46"/>
and uniform course of acting for the protestant succession, and
flowing from principles, that were owned, when most discountenanced.
But these endeavours in me to give your E. H. any satisfaction of this
kind, are perfectly unnecessary, since my lord Halifax, who is so able and
thoroughly versed in all the affairs of this kingdom, and so acquainted with
the inclinations and practices of all men in business here, is to be for
some time, in your E. H.'s court, where none can so well disperse all
unfair representations of facts; and when that is done, your E. H. canâˆ£not
but make the wisest conclusion, and such as next, under the blessing
of God, may best tend to make yet more effectual, those prudent proâˆ£visions
which the wisdom of this kingdom hath, on mature deliberation,
thought fittest to be made for the interest and honour of your E. H.'s seâˆ£rene

<P>"THE hopes of having my letter presented to your Electoral Highâˆ£ness,
by my lord Halifax, has encouraged me to the presumption
of writing. I could not hope for a more favourable opportunity of makâˆ£ing
this humble tender of my duty, than by the hands of one, who has
so eminently distinguished himself, upon all occasions, for the settling and
establishing the succession of the crown of England, in your most serene
family, and who will be a witness above exception, of my conduct, in
every part of that affair. I confess I always depended upon it, that my
public behaviour should be an abundant testimony for me, as to my
zeal to the protestant succession, and for promoting the war, in order to
reduce the power of France, which I take to be the most effectual security
to that succession.</P>
<P>It is with infinite satisfaction we hear your Electoral Highness has been
pleased to approve the measures taken in our parliament this last winter.
My lord Halifax is able to give so perfect an account of every thing that
has been done, and of the several means used to bring them all to bear,
that I shall not pretend to enter further into that matter, than by saying,
<PB N="34" REF="47"/>
I hope it will appear, that nothing is now wanting to the establishment
of the succession that can be done by the provision of laws; and that the
administration of the government, when the succession shall take place,
will be upon the same foot that it is now in the Queen's reign.</P>
<P>It might have a strange appearance, that they, who by a long and
steady series of acting, had shown themselves, beyond a possibility of
dispute, the assertors of the succession, in the person of her Electoral
Highness, the princess Sophia, should in the least hesitate to agree to a
proposition, that it was necessary to have the next presumptive heir to the
crown to reside in England; but I beg leave to suggest to your Electoral
Highness's consideration, that if this had been allowed for a rule, it might
possibly, in a little time, have pressed very inconvenient upon your
Electoral Highness. It was not to be imagined you would leave domiâˆ£nions,
where you were sovereign, to reside in England, before you were
our king; and yet there would have been an inconveniency in rejecting
an invitation of that nature, when the kingdom had before declared such
a residence to be necessary. But the manner of making this proposal
was, above all other things, the strongest objection to it. The speech
with which it was introduced, is in print, and so cannot be misrepreâˆ£sented.
The turn of it was to shew first, that we could go on no farâˆ£ther
with the Dutch, (which was in effect to say, we must make peace)
and next to say, the Queen's administration was hardly sufficient to help
us in peace, at home, unless the next heir came over. The Queen was
present at this discourse, and no one can judge so well as your E. H.
whether this was a compliment proper to engage her Majesty, to enter
willingly into the invitation; and if it had been assented to with relucâˆ£tance,
whether it might not have given rise to unkindnesses, that might
in the end have proved very fatal.</P>
<P>They who were afraid of entering into such an invitation, (especially
coming as it did from those, who never till then shewed any concern for
the protestant succession) thought it proper to lay hold of that favourâˆ£able
conjuncture, to push in for those solid provisions, which were
evidently wanting, and which we hope are brought to effect, by the act
that is to be farther carried on by the negociation entered into for enâˆ£gaging
the allies to become guaranties of our succession, and by the treaty
<PB N="35" REF="48"/>
between the commissioners of England and Scotland, for a union of the
two kingdoms, which seems to be the way now laid open, for obtaining
the declaration of the same succession in Scotland, which is already
effected in England. I believe there is a good disposition in the comâˆ£missioners,
on both sides. I can absolutely promise for one, the meanest
of them, that as far as my capacity and application can go, nothing shall
be wanting to bring this treaty to a happy issue.</P>
<P>Having already presumed to take so great a liberty, I humbly beg
permission of your E. H. to mention another particular, the act of naâˆ£turalization,
which some have said was, at least, unnecessary, if not a
diminution to your most serene family. If this be so, not only all our
present judges, but all the lawyers of former ages have been in the wrong.
There are but two ways of making any persons born out of the allegiâˆ£ance
of the crown of England, capable of enjoying inheritances, honours,
or offices in this Kingdom; the one complete and perfect, which is a naâˆ£turalization,
by act of parliament; the other imperfect, which is by
letters patent, of denization. That this is so, cannot be better proved, than
by the instance of his highness prince Rupert. For when K. C. the First
intended to create him D. of Cumberland, to make him capable of that
title, it was found necessary, previously to make him a denizen, by the K.'s
grant, under the great seal; the differences then subsisting between the
King and his parliament, making it impossible to procure a naturalizaâˆ£tion.
But the present act is attended with all possible marks of honour
and respect, for the Queen and nation. It extends to all the posterity of
her R. H. the princess Sophia, born, or hereafter to be born, and whereâˆ£soever
they are born, which is a privilege that was never yet granted
in any case, till in this instance. It is only from your E. H.'s eminent
goodness, that I can hope for pardon, for this tedious address. I am,
with the most profound respect, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"I Am very much obliged to you for the letter which you have taken
the trouble of writing to me. I consider it as a fresh proof of your
zeal for the protestant succession, and for the interests of my family. I
communicated its contents to the electress. She comprehends perfectly well
the advantage of the two acts, and what obligations we owe the Queen,
for having employed her influence, in getting them passed. We are also
very sensible of the honour which she does to the electoral prince, in
sending him the order of the garter. As you know, that I am naturally
an enemy to ceremonies and compliments, you are undoubtedly perâˆ£suaded,
that it is from that very motive I have wished that Mr. How
should be charged with that commission. I entreat you, my lord, to be
so good, as to assure her Majesty of our sincere gratitude, and of the atâˆ£tention
which we shall always employ, to cultivate the honour of her
friendship. I flatter myself, that it is too solidly established to suffer
any diminution, from the discourses attributed to the electress, which
she certainly never held with Mrs. How; and which, having only come
to the ears of that lady, at second hand, have been undoubtedly related to
her in an unfaithful manner. I depend very much upon your afâˆ£fection,
and upon your attentions, to maintain a friendship which is so
very precious to us as that of the Queen; and I am, very sincereâˆ£ly,

<P>"MY brother and cousin. Knowing the inviolable attachment, which
the intendant of my finances, that is to say, the auditor of the
Exchequer, lord Halifax, has always testified for your person and your
interests; I gave him orders to present to you authentic copies of three
acts, which concern your family. The share which he has had in these
acts, renders him very fit to explain to you, with what intention they
have been formed; and, I doubt not, but you will agree with me, that
nothing could more effectually secure the succession of your family. It
is with this view I have given them my assent, having nothing in the
world so much at heart, as to preserve our religion and the tranquillity of
my subjects, by leaving these kingdoms to the mild dominion of my
protestant heirs. I have given orders to lord Halifax, to assure you,
that, on all occasions, I consider your interest as my own; and, as a small
proof of my esteem and affection for your family, I have made my
cousin, the electoral prince, knight of the order of the garter; which is
a dignity, that my ancestors always conferred upon those whom they
most esteemed, and of which the greatest princes in Europe are ambiâˆ£tious.
The earnestness of my above-mentioned minister to obey my
orders, and his zeal for his country, equally engage him to discharge
this commission. I beseech you to be so good, as to honour him with
your confidence, when he enters upon these subjects; and when he tells
you, with what sincerity, I am," &amp;c.</P>

<P>"I Am much obliged to you, for the letter of the 26th of March, (5th

I received, with the utmost gratitude, the communication of the design
<PB N="39" REF="52"/>
of finishing the war in Italy, with which the Queen was pleased to honour
me. I judge it worthy of her Majesty's prudence, and of her zeal for
the common good. I doubt not but you will execute it, in a manner,
which will add a new lustre to the glory which you have already acâˆ£quired,
and a fresh obligation to those which the public owe you. I am
very sorry, that the state of my affairs, the situation of my country, and
the just diffidence which I must entertain of several of my neighbours,
do not leave me the power to agree to send my troops to such a distance;
and to put them beyond the reach of being of service to me, in case of
need. You know, my lord, that I expressly reserved it to myself, by the
treaty, the liberty of bringing them back, when I should find it requiâˆ£site
for my own defence; and that the fear of that want has induced
me not to renew the treaty, but from year to year, and to specify the
places where my troops should act. I doubt not, but before you begin
the proposed march to Italy, you will take care to provide sufficiently for
the safety of Holland; since a check upon that side might occasion irreâˆ£parable
losses to the common cause; and your being at such a distance,
might put it absolutely out of your power to bring timely relief; and as
it is impossible to provide for the defence of the frontiers of the reâˆ£public,
but by leaving in them a powerful army, I think the troops,
which I have in the Queen's pay, may be allowed to serve in such an
army. I am much obliged to you, for communicating to me the proâˆ£jects
of the prince of Baden. I judge of them, in the same manner as
you do; and I see no reason, that they should be attended to. I always
am, very sincerely," &amp;c.</P>

did not entirely depend on your great prudence, which will easily imaâˆ£gine
the good reasons for it, after those extraordinary sort of proceedings

<P>The truth is, I, with a great many more (as they have owned in
conversation) have been this long while in a constant expectation of your
appointing some person, either privately or publickly, to convey letters
safely, and to be conversed with and confided in upon occasion; because,
though I believe no body ever had a thought on this subject of your
coming over hither either in the least disrespectful to the Queen, or even to
the government, or which could justly be blamed by either of them, if disâˆ£covered;
yet it would be unmannerly to yourself, as well as imprudent,
to venter letters to so great a person that are so liable to be intercepted
as mine are at this time, though, God knows, without my least deserving
it. And therefore, according to this notion, it was thought absolutely
necessary long ago to acquaint your R. H. (once for all) with the necesâˆ£sity
of such an agent; but since none has come, I must conclude the
proposal never came to your hands, though sent inclosed several ways;
which was a confirmation of the reasonableness of it: which has made
me resolve to give your R. H. this one trouble more now at last, in
hopes it may have better success, though inclosed for once to Mr. Daveâˆ£nant,
but in a private pacquet, who, as devoted as possible to the house
of Hannover, yet is by no means proper to convey a correspondence of
this kind, which, as innocent as it is, must needs be exposed, every
pacquet, to the under clerks of an office.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="58"/>
I most here most humbly take my leave of your R. H. this way,
because, besides the being apprehensive of giving unnecessary troubles, I
think it better to refer all to that time when you will be pleased to settle
this so necessary method. I shall now only say that, in my conscience, I
believe, and dare affirm myself sure, that the persons in both houses who
appeared for your coming over, and against that bill which passed, not
to present it, but as a security brought in the room of it, did it princiâˆ£pally
for the quiet and safety of the government, and more especially
of the Queen's sacred person, whom, according to their obligations, they
love and reverence above all things: and their next consideration was
for fear that ill-disposed persons should interpose between the time of
such a fatal accident of our losing her, and the protestant succession
established, and might consequently wish for that sad day, in order to
such their design; and this was my own reason, which I gave openly in
parliament, before herself, taking God to witness the truth of it. I

<P>"As soon as we understood that the enemy, having withdrawn their
troops from the fortified places, and collected together all their
forces in the Low Countries, had passed the Geete at Tirlemont, and
encamped between that place and Leane, with a design of giving us batâˆ£tle,
we did not hesitate to advance toward them, placing our confidence
in the blessing of heaven and the valour of our troops. Sunday last, we
continued our march, at three o'clock in the morning, to gain the opening
between the Mahain and the great Geete. We soon understood that the
enemy were likewise in march; but, according to the report of the
general officers who were our prisoners, their design was not to fight
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
before Monday; not believing that we would venture to come to them.
The armies were in fight before noon; and all diligence was used on
both sides to arrange the troops in order of battle, and to form the batâˆ£teries,
which began to play at one. And toward two o'clock, we orâˆ£dered
the village of Ramillies, which covered the right of their infantry,
where they had their largest battery, with a great force, to be attacked.</P>
<P>The battle became hot, and continued long enough, with great
fury; but at last, the enemy was obliged to give way. We took their
cannon, and made many prisoners; and having continued the fight with
the same vigour, (the infantry as well as the cavalry) until between four
and five o'clock, when the enemy began to withdraw; we pursued them
without intermission, fighting them as they retired, until the night was
far advanced: so that God has given us a complete victory. We have
taken forty-three pieces of cannon, the pontons, a great part of their
baggage, and at least four thousand prisoners, besides their loss in the
battle.</P>
<P>We only halted two hours in the night, and we began our march
before day, in order to draw near the Dyle, of which we had determined
to attempt the passage this morning at day-light: but the enemy saved
us that trouble, having retired last night toward Brussels; so that we
entered Louvain, and all our army passed the river without opposition.
The French burnt their magazines in the town, but the Spaniards left
theirs entire.</P>
<P>Your E. H. may easily judge, by this, of the loss of the enemy, and
of the consternation in which they are. We propose, to-morrow, to adâˆ£vance
toward Brussels, to take the advantage of this consternation; and
to endeavour to attack them again, or to oblige them to retire further.
Nothing could excuse us for fatiguing the troops so much, after so obâˆ£stinate
an engagement, but the necessity of driving them to the last extreâˆ£mity
before the Marishal de Marsin joins them, which may happen in
four days.</P>

He wrote to him from Rastadt, the 19th instant, by Mr. D'Aveâˆ£nant,

the lieutenant general to advance, on that side, with my troops, when
there was any hopes of preventing the enemy from executing their proâˆ£ject

point, when the Marshal de Marsin returns to the Maese with the detachâˆ£ment
which he commands, and when the prince of Baden, having placed
himself safely beyond the Rhine, has assembled there a force sufficient to
prevent the passage of the French, I see no necessity of sending to him
my troops. I know, if they once should advance on that side, the prince
will find means of keeping them all the campaign, which is as contrary to
my intentions as it is to the public service. I always reckoned that they
were to serve in your army; and I don't see that there is any necessity of
employing them elsewhere. You will therefore oblige me much, by
sending them your orders without delay. They will follow them puncâˆ£tually.
But I chuse to hope, that you will approve the strong reasons
which I have, not to trust them to the prince of Baden; and that the
interest of the common cause does not demand that I should. You will find
means of employing my troops in places where they may serve more useâˆ£fully.

<PB N="49" REF="62"/>
use. But as, according to the intelligence which we receive, the court
of France must have given orders to Monsieur de Villars to march thirty
battalions and forty squadrons to this side, the prince will be soon at
liberty to act on his side: and I slatter myself that the court of Vienna
will take care, that so large a body of troops, Monsieur de Bulau comâˆ£puting
them at forty thousand men, besides the Hessians, shall not remain
inactive during the campaign.</P>
<P>I did myself the honour to communicate to your E. H. on the
25th of the last month, the victory which we obtained over the enemy.
We have not failed to pursue our blow; and the happy consequences
which that has produced, are beyond whatever we could hope. It has
never been heard, that so many places of strength, with entire provinces,
surrendered in so short a time, especially as they were provided with garriâˆ£sons
and magazines for a good defence. Oudenard, where there were
three battalions, surrendered yesterday. I have ordered Antwerp and
Oftend to be summoned, and I expect their answers every moment. We
cannot take the proper measures, until we are masters of the first place.
I flatter myself that all this will have a good effect elsewhere; and that if
our troops upon the Upper Rhine will do their duty properly, the enemy
will be even obliged to bring forces from Italy to their assistance; which
will give relief to the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene, and may frusâˆ£trate
the designs of the enemy upon Turin. I am, with a most profound
respect, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"AT my return to this place, Monsieur Bothmer gave me your letter
of the 23d July, which gave me a great dale of satisfaction. I
did not understand, why the nomination was delayed so long; and I am
consident, that it was more proper that it should be dispatched. I shall
not fail to write to the archbishop and my lord Keeper, and I do not
imagine, they will make any difficulty of waiting on Monsieur Schutz,
if he is not able to go abroad; but Monsieur Schutz must have his creâˆ£dentials
enrolled in Chancery, before he is capable of acting; if I am in
England before the instruments are delivered, I will be there, if that
shall be thought proper; but in my own opinion it is not. When I was
at the camp, I spoke to the duke of Marlborough about the title, and he
is very ready to join in that, or any thing that may be agreeable to the
prince. When I come into England, I shall not fail to represent it to
the Queen. I intended to have gone to England by Ostend, but the
pensioner writ to have me come this way, to satisfy some scruples that
were raised against our treaty; all the towns in this province have
<PB N="61" REF="74"/>
agreed to it, but Leyden. I have been this morning with Monsieur Van
Lewen, their deputy; and I hope he is so well satisfied, that he will not
make any opposition longer; if he does, it will not obstruct above a day

<P>"I Found myself so very desirous of embracing the opportunity of the
convoy, from the Texel, that I was not able to inform your Elecâˆ£toral
Highness of the manner in which the province of Holland consented
to the treaty. I send now a copy of it to your Electoral Highness, in
order that I may have the honour of receiving such remarks or instrucâˆ£tions,
as your Electoral Highness will think proper to communicate to
me, on the subject. Your Electoral Highness will find the guarantee of
the succession drawn up nearly in the same terms, as I mentioned in my
last letter. But their demands, with regard to the barrier, which they
wish to have, are so extravagant, that I doubt whether they will be conâˆ£sented
to, as they have projected them. I represented this very amply to
the ministers in Holland; and it appears to me, that they have made this
proposal concerning a barrier, altogether like merchants. They know
very well, that their demands are exorbitant; but they hope to obtain
the better bargain, by lowering a great deal of their pretensions. The
pensionary is so convinced of this, that he entreated me to send him, in
writing, the objections which I made to them. I will not fail to do so.
Although this method of acting is not just, for it will greatly retard the
conclusion of the treaty. Several efforts have been made from many
places, for breaking off this negociation. But I hope that we shall surâˆ£mount
all these obstacles.</P>
<P>We have all the reason to promise ourselves success, in our union
with Scotland. All the letters from that country give us great hopes,
that it will be accepted by their parliament. This treaty has had its
effect in advancing the other; and when the last hand is put to the union,
<PB N="62" REF="75"/>
and there shall be no further means of preventing it, certain gentlemen
in Holland, will not show so much coldness for the treaty of guarantee.</P>
<P>I gave an account to the Queen, of the favourable reception which
I met with in Hannover; and her Majesty is extremely satisfied with
the friendship and esteem, which your Electoral Highness testified for
her. She has commanded me to renew all the assurances which I gave to
your Electoral Highness, that she will do every thing in her power, for
advancing the interests of your Electoral Highness, and of your family;
and I believe you will receive, very soon, some fresh marks of her zeal
for their honour and interest, which, as I hope, will be very agreeable to
your Electoral Highness."</P>

has made them as advantageous offers, as they propose; which makes it
the more delicate and difficult to tell them, that we believe they themâˆ£selves
propose too much. I can tell your Electoral Highness, that the
Queen's ministers have acted as wise men and men of honour, with reâˆ£gard
to the offers of France for a peace. They plainly declared to the
Dutch, on what terms they could consent to it, which are such as canâˆ£not
fail to satisfy all the allies: and they insisted particularly, that we
could never believe, that it was honourable to treat of a peace, while one
who pretended to be King of England, remained in France. I am, with

concerning the entry of the King of Sweden into Saxony. You

no diffidence of that prince, and to take no measures against him;
for that would be the means of hurrying him into engagements with
France, and into designs against the empire; of which, there is reason to

<P>As for my part, I shall spare neither care nor pains, to appease the trouâˆ£bles
of Saxony, and to prevent them from being prejudicial to the interests
of the common cause, and from interrupting the course of the glorious sucâˆ£cesses,
which God continues to grant to the arms of the Queen and of
her allies. It is with this view, that I sent to his Swedish Majesty, baâˆ£ron
D'Oberg, one of my ministers of state. I informed the Queen and
the States-general of his embassy; and I shall not fail to acquaint them
with the answer of the King of Sweden, and the dispositions which he
will discover.</P>
<P>I shall do myself a pleasure in sending to you, my lord, the same

<P>"I Have received the honour of your Royal Highness's letter of the

Highness and your family, has been so well received; and I shall make
it the business of my life to merit the continuance of your faâˆ£vour.
The patent for the title of the electoral prince, is now dispatched.
We were a great while looking for titles, that were anciently in the royal
family, for the earldom and the marquisate; but most of the old titles
have been since given away, especially to the natural sons of King Charles;
and at last, it was thought best, to create him Marquis and Duke of
Cambridge, that if your Royal Highness and the Elector please, the young
prince, when he shall be born<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His lordship, it seems, was determined, that the unborn child should be a boy.</NOTE> may be called marquis of Cambridge.
The duke of York his sons were called so, when he was nearer in degree
to the crown, and it would certainly please the English, if he took that
name. I send your Royal Highness the articles of the Union, as they
are printed in Scotland. They have been kept very private, till they
were laid before the parliament; by all accounts from thence, there is
great reason to hope they will be approved; there has been little done
hitherto, but the appearances are promising; the Jacobites there, are so
apprehensive that the Union will be carried, that they are willing to come
into the proposition which the opposing party talk of making, which is,
to settle the succession on your Royal Highness, with limitations, and a
communication of trade; they think this the most plausible way of bafâˆ£fling
the union; but it is so well understood, that this offer comes too
late now, which might willingly have been received some months ago.
But your Royal Highness will give me leave to observe, that we have
managed the opportunities we have had with some skill, when things are
brought to that pass, that the very Jacobites are for settling the protesâˆ£tant
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
succession one way, to avoid establishing it more effectually another.
And we have this further to say, that, if this Union is made, it will be
the first instance in history of this kind; for there never was, at any time
or in any place, an example of two sovereign kingdoms incorporating
themselves in such a manner."</P>

which I hope you will give to Mons. Lubieres; 'tis a pretty

tell you, very confidently, that the Union will be agreed to in Scotland;
we have letters from thence, of the 14th, which say, that the opposing
party have made their effort two ways; they would first have put off the
consideration of it for three months, that they might consult their constiâˆ£tuents;
but that was carried against them, by a great majority: then
they proposed a general fast, which would have taken up three weeks,
but that was waved, because the Assembly of the kirk had not asked it;
and when it was moved there, it was rejected, and the assembly has diâˆ£rected
the ministers to offer up prayers for the success of the union. And
now the clergy have made this step, it cannot fail of succeeding. By
letters I have from Holland, I have no doubt of the success of our treaty
there, though there will be some difficulty in adjusting their barrier. I
think now, we may be all allowed to boast, that nothing was ever better
pushed, than the establishment of our succession has been, since we had a
parliament to promote it. And if you can but take care of hindering
your northern hero from breaking our measures, we will make France
own, both the Electorate and the succession of the House of Hannover.

confidence which you shew me, by the communication of the two letters
which were inclosed in it. Their contents are so important, that it is imâˆ£possible

to the allies, that France addresses herself to a person whose good
intentions are so well known, and whose understanding is proof against
every artifice.</P>
<P>I agree with you, my lord, that it is necessary to be very much on

quarter. It appears to me, that it is to be avoided, above all
things, to take any step which may give umbrage to such of the allies to
whom France has made no overture; and, as the two letters which you
communicated to me bear, that that crown does not choose to exclude,
from the negociation which it proposes, any of the powers which are at
war with it, nothing, in my opinion, is more natural than to answer,
<PB N="71" REF="86"/>
That, the Queen and the States being obliged to act in concert with the
Emperor and the principal allies in this great affair, it is necessary for you
to begin, by communicating to them what hath been addressed to you,

<P>By this means, you will gain all the time necessary for discovering if
France acts sincerely, or if she wants to lay snares; and you will persuade,
more and more, the Emperor and the other allies of the rectitude with
which the Queen and the States act with them. This will strengthen
the union of the confederated powers, which ought never to be closer,
than when it is proposed to treat of a peace. I order the Baron de Bothâˆ£mar
to be thoroughly instructed, as well in this affair as in others which
are at present on the carpet; entreating you to place an intire confidence

chuses to subscribe to such terms, they will never pay the smallest attenâˆ£tion

<P>I believe it very material to stipulate, in the strongest and
most solemn manner, that neither the crown of Spain, nor any of its deâˆ£pendencies,
can ever be possessed by a prince of the royal family of
France; whether elder or younger, whether in a direct or a collateral
line: and that all the dispositions which can be made to the contrary
hereafter, by will, by contract of marriage, or by any manner whatever,
will be absolutely null: and that in all the cases which can arise, that is
to say, whether there are any princes of the house of Austria, whether
there are but princesses, or whether that house shall be entirely extinct.
For, without this precaution, it may happen, that in case the Emperor
and King Charles the Third shall die without male descendants, France
may draw a pretext from thence of beginning a new war, and of forming
fresh pretensions to the crown of Spain.</P>
<P>I leave you likewise to consider, my lord, if, in order to take away a
pretext from France, ever ready to excite new troubles in the empire, it
would not be proper to stipulate, with that crown, the recognition of the

<HEAD>1707.<MILESTONE N="1707" UNIT="year"/></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Great Britain derived the benefits of the Revolution
from the folly and enthusiasm of James the Second, it owed the
continuance of that system of government to the happy ignorance and
confined policy of Lewis the Fourteenth. The justness of this observaâˆ£tion
is partly established by the secret negociations of the present year.
The Union of the kingdoms had raised a resentment, and even a degree
of fury, among the nobility and gentry, as well as among the vulgar in
Scotland, that threatened the worst consequences. They wanted but a
show of succours from France, to take up arms against England. Many
of the nobility and chiefs of clans were enthusiastically attached to the
excluded family; and they pressed, with eagerness, for the presence of
the Pretender in Scotland, were it only with a body of men sufficient to
protect him against the officers of justice in the kingdom, till they could
join him with their vassals. The French King, though apprized of this
state of affairs in Scotland, either through want of comprehension in
himself, or the fortunate ignorance of foreign affairs, which always preâˆ£vailed
in the counsels of France, declined to send the demanded supplies,
and thus discouraged a diversion to the arms of the most powerful of the
allies, which, in all likelihood, would have procured the peace which was
so necessary to his distressed subjects.</P>
<P>To amuse, however, the Scots, he resolved to send colonel Hooke
again into their country. The object of this man's expedition was to
induce the malecontents to take arms, without subjecting the French
King to any engagements on his side. When Hooke arrived in Scotâˆ£land,
he found the malecontents distracted among themselves. The
duke of Hamilton, who had been for many years considered as the head
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
of the Jacobites,<MILESTONE N="January." UNIT="month"/> and was much followed by the Presbyterians, had lost
the affection and confidence of both, by his impenetrable conduct in parâˆ£liament.
The two parties were equally averse to the Union; and they
ascribed the misfortune, as they called it, of that measure, either to the
timidity or treachery of the duke. In this state of affairs, it was not
likely that, if even France had sent the aid required, the enemies of the
Union could make any formidable figure in the field. But the court of
St. Germains, who perceived that there was no serious intention to favour
their own cause, informed their friends in Scotland, that no succours
were to be sent; and that, therefore, they ought to take care of themâˆ£selves.
The chief part of the correspondence of the present year relates
to these circumstances. The servants of the Pretender, who had been
unreasonably sanguine on many other occasions, seemed to have derived
no hopes, either from Hooke's negociations, or the intrigues of their agents
in England, with the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin.
They, however, continued their intercourse with the Jacobites in Briâˆ£tain,
to preserve them in their principles and hopes, for a more favourâˆ£able
conjuncture.</P>

<P>"I Find no ground at all for the reports you mention, of the merâˆ£chants
Manly [the King] and Wisely's [Queen] removing from the

I am also of your opinion, that a good construction may posâˆ£sibly
be made of Armsworth's [Marlborough's] intentions in the bargain
which is now making between Wheatly [England] and Norly [Scotland],
because it may bring on a necessity of Henly's continuing in his post;
for it has always been my opinion, that Armsworth [Marlborough] withâˆ£out
the assistance of Henly would never be able to pay his old debts.
But on the other hand, I very much question whether at this present that
merchant and his partners have such honest thoughts. I am very appreâˆ£hensive
that he intends only to support himself, in supporting Henly,
and little thinks of his former engagements. But these matters must be

[Godolphin] and Armsworth [Marlborough], they are so full of mystery
in their dealings, that it is hard to judge of their intentions and designs."</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="February." UNIT="month"/> The Jacobites have generally, and with some reason, suspected, that
the court of France regarded no further the interest of the Pretender,
than only when it was subservient to their own. Lewis the Fourteenth
himself seems frequently to have been sincere in his professions to the exâˆ£cluded
family. His ministers, however, justly judging that they could
have only the uncertain gratitude of the person whom they should serve
for the expence and hazard of an expedition, were extremely backward in
making any effectual efforts for invading Britain. Besides, it was natural
for them, considering their own attachment to monarchy, to suppose,
that they derived great advantage from having in their hands the person
whom they supposed to have an hereditary right to the British crown.
The attempts, therefore, which were, from time to time, made for inâˆ£vading
this island, were rather intended to engage the nation in a civil
war, than to contribute effectually to restore the family of Stuart. The
languor and caution of its court increased with the misfortunes of France
in the present war. Happily for Britain, the court of Versailles were
most inattentive and negligent, when they most stood in need of spirited
efforts, and when the state of these kingdoms were most exposed to reâˆ£volution
and change. It was, for example, with great caution and reâˆ£luctancy,
as appears from the following letters, that the French ministry
yielded to the vehement applications of the court of St. Germains, to
take advantage of the violent discontents excited in Scotland, in the preâˆ£sent
year, by the Union between the kingdoms.</P>

<P>The French court resolving to send colonel Hooke to Scotland, M.
de Chamillart gave him the following instructions, which may serve, at
once, for a specimen of the extreme ignorance of the French ministry,
and their insincerity in the cause of the Pretender. Chamillart, it seems,
had the weakness to suppose, that the Scotish nobility would rise in arms,
and maintain a regular war against England. He speaks with familiarity
of campaigns, as if the populace of Scotland had already been formed
into regular armies, and their leaders provided with finances, to support
a long series of hostilities.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>February, 1707.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"TO be certain of making a diversion in Scotland, which will emâˆ£barrass
the English, and oblige them to bring back a considerable
body of troops to England; the Scotish nobility must be in a condition
to assemble 25 or 30,000 men, and to clothe, arm, equip, and maintain
them, during the campaign; i. e. at least, six months, to commence at
the beginning of May.</P>
<P>The favourable dispositions of the nobility, leave no room to doubt,
but they will make their utmost efforts, to withdraw themselves from the
yoke which the English nation intends to impose upon them. Before a
revolution, which should end in the restoration of the lawful sovereign,
is begun, it is necessary to enter into a particular detail of the forces and
means which the Scotch can employ to accomplish it, and of the succours
which they may promise themselves from the protection of the King,
who is no less interested in the success of this enterprise, than his Briâˆ£tannic
Majesty. It is for these considerations, that his Majesty hath
judged it proper, before he makes any positive promise to the Scots,
to send over Mr. Hooke, in order to acquire, upon the spot, a perfect
knowledge of the state of things, to form a well digested plan with the
nobility, to reduce it to writing, and to get it signed by the principal
men of the country; giving them assurances of his Majesty's sincere deâˆ£sire
and his dispositions to send them the succours, which may be necesâˆ£sary
for them; and his Majesty recommends, in a very particular manner,
to Mr. Hooke, not to engage him in expences, which those he is obliged
to lay out elsewhere will not allow him to support, nor to give them
any room to hope for more than he can furnish.</P>
<P>The articles which are to be the principal objects of his attention, are
first, to inform himself, with certainty, of the number of troops of
which the army shall be composed, and of the generals and other officers,
who are in the country, to command them: if they stand in need of
some of those which are in France: of what rank, and how many: the
particular places where those men, who voluntarily engage shall assemble,
and the place of general rendezvous afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="96"/>
To know who will clothe, arm and equip them: if they have cloth
in the country, and if they are able to pay for it: who will furnish fuâˆ£sees,
bayonets, swords, belts, bandeliers, and powder-flasks, linen, stockâˆ£ings,
shoes, hats, and other utensils, such as hatchets, pickaxes, and
spades.</P>
<P>If they have any artillery; of what size, and what quantity.</P>
<P>If they have stocks and carriages for cannon.</P>
<P>If they have officers of artillery, cannoniers, bombardiers, and miners.</P>
<P>If they have mortars, bullets, bombs, grenades, and in what quantity.</P>
<P>If they have powder and ball, whether for cannon or for muskets.</P>
<P>What they want of these things, and what they demand as absolutely
necessary for them; acquainting them that it is not their interest to deâˆ£mand
too much.</P>
<P>It will not be sufficient to be informed, with certainty, that they are
able to assemble a considerable army: it likewise is necessary to know
further, the means by which the nobility intend to subsist them, while
they are in the field; and by which they can form magazines, and
assemble waggons to follow the army, wherever the generals think it may
be proper to order it to march.</P>
<P>The same inquiry must be made about the equipage for the artillery;
for the use of which it will be necessary to have a certain number of
horses, in proportion to the train which they think they should bring into
the field.</P>
<P>They must not persuade themselves that the mere good will of the noâˆ£bility,
and the blind obedience of their vassals, in doing whatever they
choose, are sufficient to oblige them to remain too long from home,
when they are furnished only with bread; they must have meat and spirits,
or, at least, vegetables, with some other drink than water, the use of
which is not common in that country.</P>
<P>It is of importance to be assured of the manner in which the grain
and drink shall be furnished; of the assessment which shall be made; of
the contingent which each nobleman shall contribute in grain, drink, and
other provisions; of the number of men they will give, and if they shall
be clothed, armed, and equipped. In short, to enter into such an exact
<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
detail, that nothing will remain to be done, but to take a final resolution
concerning the project which Mr. Hooke shall form, in order to secure
its success.</P>
<P>It is supposed it may be demanded further, that the person who shall
command the army, should explain himself, as to the use he intends to
make of it. There will be several other things to be added, which the
experience and good sense of Mr. Hooke will suggest to him."</P>

<P>M. de Chamillart discovers in these instructions, that he was ignorant of
the real state of Scotland; but Mr. Hooke adhered strictly to some parts

several engagements, while the King of France declined to oblige himâˆ£self

<P>"WHAT you tell me of your acquaintance Mr. Goulston [Godolâˆ£phin],
that he appears out of humour, notwithstanding his plenâˆ£tiful
fortune, does not much surprise me; for I always thought him hyâˆ£pochondrical
in his temper, which increaseth with age. I am only sorry
that this sourness of humour will make him unfit to be applied to in your
cousin Wisely's [the pretender's] affair, at least at present; and as for Mr.
<PB N="85" REF="100"/>
Armsworth [Marlborough], I believe he has so much business of his own
upon his hands, that notwithstanding all former engagements, he will
hardly have the leisure, perhaps not the will, to mind old promises.</P>
<P>I am very glad to hear what has lately been imparted to you by some
of Mr. Kensy's [the Tories] relations, that they are not now averse from
having the concurrence of Mr. Manning [the King of France] in Plessingâˆ£ton's
[the King's] affair; for though we cannot expect to bring that
cause speedily to a trial, yet Kensy [the Tories] and his partners ought
to be managed and kept in good humour. In the mean time, I believe
he is irreconcilable with our chief adversary Wanly [the Whigs]; and
that you may perhaps make him firm to us; and it is upon a like account
that we may reckon to have friends in Mr. Norly's [Scotland] family,
who can never pardon what our adversary Brag [parliament] has done
against them; but these are seeds which must have time to grow."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 7.</NOTE>"As to our affair about the cause depending between Wheatly [Engâˆ£land]
and Manning [France], I believe that what Mr. Armsworth
[Marlborough] told captain Gordon is very true, viz. that Manning
[France] has offered to bring the whole cause to arbitration, without any
salvo to your cousin's [the King's] interest: which being so, I hope
there will be no mention made of it on either side, but that it will be left
as now it is.</P>
<P>I am glad to find that your friend the captain has so good an opinion
of Mr. Gurny's [Marlborough's] honest intentions to pay the old debt,
when able. As to his ability, there are few people that doubt of it; but
as to his sincerity, I find there are many who doubt of it.</P>
<P>I perceive there are great animosities between these two merchants,
Kensy [Tories] and Wanly [Whigs], which may possibly break out into
suits at law; nor is there much more peace and quiet in Norly's [Scotâˆ£land]
family, about stating their accounts. Now, I perceive, that if they
proceed to a trial at law, discoveries may be made very advantageous to
your cousin's interest, as having been formerly joined in commerce with
them.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to hear what a second conference between our captain
and Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough] will produce, which you seem to
intimate."</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="101"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 1.</NOTE>"You tell me, that the hasty departure of Mr. Rysehoven [Marlboâˆ£rough]
out of town disappointed you of speaking to him, of which the
loss, I think, is not very great; for I think he would have said no more
to you than he lately said to captain Gordon, of paying of the old debt;
and than what he hath formerly so often said upon that subject, without
any effect. But you have no reason from thence to think yourself an
unprofitable servant, in the concerns of your friends, and to take upon
yourself the faults and failings of others. However, it will not be amiss
to receive good words, as often as we can from that merchant; hoping,
that, in time, whatever it may be now, things may so fall out, that he
may have a good meaning, joined to good words. The same thing is to
be hoped from Mr. Travers [Tunstal] and his partners Kensy [Tories],
though these two at present, I think, have more sincerity than the former,
in what they say, whether it be out of spite on one side, or out of friendâˆ£ship
on the other. What Mr. Travers [Tunstal] has promised you, of
keeping his hold, in his trust for your cousin Wisely, is a mark of his
good intentions; and I hope Mr. Goulston [Godolphin] will do the same,
that justice at last may take place."</P>

<P>I do not pretend to trouble you with tales of antiquity, but to remark
what we ourselves see. What embarrassment have not the Hungarians
given to the Emperor? Who would have believed that a few peasants
in the Cevannes, without any succours, could have occupied so many reâˆ£gular
troops, commanded by mareschals of France, for three years? The
King of Sweden, always favoured by fortune, during five years in Poâˆ£land,
has been convinced, that he could never finish the war without
entering into Saxony; and his enemy, after having obtained a victory,
has been obliged to renounce his dignity, in order to save his own paâˆ£trimony;
<PB N="87" REF="102"/>
and the enemies in Germany,<MILESTONE N="July." UNIT="month"/> who fled before the mareschal de
Villars, by their return to Philipsburgh, have obliged that general to
return, by a forced march, in order to cover Alsace. The King, by his
great conquests, has extended the frontier of his kingdom farther than all
his ancestors. We see, however, that all the art of our enemies have
been employed to carry the war into his dominions; of this, their efforts
in Spain, their attempts upon the Moselle, their project of a descent,
and the invasion of the duke of Savoy, for the second time, are very
sensible proofs.</P>
<P>Mr. Hooke has informed us of the good disposition of the Scots, whose
fidelity and capacity are known to you. They demand their King, who
wishes ardently to join them. If the affairs of the King are urgent here,
that pleads strongly for the project in Scotland. If a small part of the
money and of the troops which are employed here, would finish the buâˆ£siness
there, it would be wrong to hesitate; and what would be formerly
prudent and glorious, becomes now absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>The King of England beseeches you to examine and to weigh delibeâˆ£rately
this important affair, and to be pleased to represent it to the King;
it being undoubtedly the most important and most useful that can happen

seems not consistent with that morality of which he has formerly made

bringing Hanmer [Hannover] to join and cohabit with Wheatly [Engâˆ£land,]
he will not be the man to rule the roast; but that Wanly's family

<P>THE Whigs in England had paid their court to the family of Hanâˆ£nover
in the preceding year, by repealing, in the bill of regency,
the limitations imposed upon the successor to the crown, by the act of
settlement. Their leaders had, in various letters, expressed their attachâˆ£ment,
and enumerated their services. Some Tories also endeavoured to
gain the favour of the presumptive heirs, by explaining the invariable
attachment of their party to the prerogatives of the crown. In the preâˆ£sent
year nothing happened that could give a pretence to either party to
renew their correspondence. The duke of Marlborough and the earl of
Sunderland, are the only persons of rank whose letters deserve to be
inserted.</P>
<P>The Hannover correspondence of this year, regards chiefly the birth
of a son to the Electoral Prince, and his being created duke of Camâˆ£bridge;

Saxony; and the Elector's taking upon himself the command of the army

<P>I Received at once your letters of the 11th and of the 14th of Feâˆ£bruary.
I am always in the hopes, that the King of Sweden will
adhere, in preference to every thing, to the prosecution of the war
against the Czar; and that if her Majesty and the States General proceed
to a recognition of King Stanislaus, and charge themselves with the guaâˆ£rantee
of the peace of Saxony, without exacting any condition or declaâˆ£ration
from the King of Sweden: and that, on the other hand, an end is
put to the affair of the renunciation of prince Charles, and ministers
are sent to Hamburgh to regulate there, what is still wanting to the
entire execution of the treaty of Travandahl, there will be no apprehenâˆ£sions
of any trouble.</P>
<P>I doubt not but the journey to the King of Sweden, which is proposed
to you, will produce very good effects; knowing the great regard which
he has for the Queen, and his very particular esteem for you. I shall
<PB N="91" REF="106"/>
rejoice at it, for my part, because this journey will procure me the pleaâˆ£sure
of seeing you again. You will judge better, when you cross the sea,
if it will be necessary for you to undertake it; and if you can do so withâˆ£out
any prejudice to the operations of the campaign. I believe it is
extremely necessary that you should give all your attentions to secure
Piper and Harmelin. My opinion is, that a pension of 2000l. sterling
may be offered to the first, and of 1000l. to the second; of which the
first year may be paid to them in advance. And that if you do not go to
Saxony, it will, in my opinion, be very proper to give this commission
to Mr. Robinson, while he is at hand, to execute it; for it will be very
difficult for him to do so, if it is delayed until the King of Sweden
marches: besides that, there is a risk of being prevented by the new miâˆ£nister
from France, who is come to the court of that prince; and who,
undoubtedly, has very positive orders to make considerable offers to the
two ministers in question. I am, my Lord, &amp;c.</P>

upon by the parliament. He had lived for some time at the court of
Hannover: but when lord Halifax was expected there, in the preceding
year, the Elector ordered Gwyne to retire, for fear of his giving offence
to the Whigs. He, accordingly, went to Hamburgh; and, after having
continued in that city ten months, he wrote to the Elector, requesting
leave to return to Hannover, and enumerating his own pretended serâˆ£vices

The reinforcement is so much the more indispensable, that it is certain,
that the cavalry which King Augustus offers, is not in a condition to
serve this campaign, and that there are no more cavalry remaining in
Germany which one can employ. I shall be very particularly obliged

<P>"ON my arrival at the Hague, I communicated to the grand Penâˆ£sionary
all that passed at Francfort, and particularly the sentiments
of your Electoral Highness, with regard to the operations on the Moâˆ£selle;
whence he immediately comprehended the necessity of being, in
that case, on the defensive in the Low Countries; and as he was of
opinion, that this proposal may have a bad effect, by discouraging
the gentlemen here, who will believe themselves too much exposed
thereby, he advised me not to make the proposal at present; so that I
have not spoke of it to any, but to the count de Wrattislow and to
Monsieur de Bothmar, who are instructed in the particulars of all that
passed, during my stay at the Hague. The first is to give an exact acâˆ£count
of it to your Electoral Highness, when he will have the honour
of saluting you at Hannover; as Mr. de Bothmar will do by writing.</P>
<P>I am sorry, however, to be obliged to tell you, that I do not find
the minds of people so well disposed for the augmentation of their troops,
as in the last journey I made to this place: but I continue to do every
thing in my power to incline them to it; and I flatter myself, that when
they will reflect maturely upon the great efforts of France, and upon
the new levies which they propose to make, they will return to their
former sentiments, and take salutary measures, according to the necessity
of the conjuncture.</P>
<P>I have put every thing on board, and I wait only for the first fair wind
to go over to England, from whence I will do myself the honour of wriâˆ£ting
to your Electoral Highness, beseeching you to accept of my very
humble acknowledgments, for the kindness which you shewed me at
Francfort; and to be persuaded of the respectful attachment with which
I shall always be, Sir, your Electoral Highness's, &amp;c."</P>

<P>THE attempt made towards an invasion of Scotland, in the beginâˆ£ning
of the present year, seems to have been, in a manner, exâˆ£torted
from the French ministry, by the repeated and earnest solicitations
of the court of St. Germains. Ascribing the flattering accounts, received
from Scotland, to the zeal of the Jacobites in France, they were unâˆ£willing
to hazard either their ships or their troops upon so slender a founâˆ£dation.
The discontents, in Scotland, though, perhaps, not magnified
beyond their real bounds, were represented as too great to be implicitly
believed. This caution, on the part of France, has been, upon many
occasions, highly fortunate for Great Britain; but at no period more forâˆ£tunate,
than in the year 1708. Towards the beginning of February,
M. de Chamillart and his brethren in office began to issue orders, for an
expedition from Dunkirk. The Pretender, when he perceived, that
something serious was intended in his favour, resolved to acquaint his
friends in Scotland, of the intentions of the court of France, and to give
them directions to prepare themselves for an insurrection. The person
appointed for this service, was Charles Fleming, brother to the earl of
Wigton. The following were the instructions given him upon this ocâˆ£casion.</P>

<P>"AS soon as you have received these our instructions, you are forthâˆ£with
to repair, with what convenient speed you can, to our ancient
<PB N="99" REF="114"/>
kingdom of Scotland; and there, to address yourself to such of our
friends, as we have named to you; but cannot safely name them here,
for fear of accidents.</P>
<P>1st, You are to assure them, that we are coming, with all possible
diligence, to assert our right, and to protect our subjects, in their reâˆ£ligion,
liberties, and trade, conform to their laws; and that we bring
with us a sufficient force, a good sum of money, arms, ammunition, and
other provisions, as was required in their memoire.</P>
<P>2dly, You are likewise to assure them, that, upon our being put in posâˆ£session
of the throne by their assistance, our dearest brother, the most
Christian King will restore the Scots to their ancient privileges in France,
and will also use his endeavours to have them included in all treaties of
peace.</P>
<P>3dly, You are to give our positive orders to a select number of the noâˆ£bility
and gentry, to seize suspected persons, with their horses, arms, and
other provisions for war; and to tell them, that we do hereby allow and
authorize them, to grant warrants to others for the same effect, when they
judge the proper time to do it, without discovering the secret which we
recommend to them above all things.</P>
<P>4thly, You are to tell those who are trusted, that upon the first appearâˆ£ance
of the fleet, that brings us, or upon the first account they have of
our landing, we order them to cause to proclaim us King, in all the
countrys where they have any interest, and to raise all their fensible men,
with their best horses and arms, and that they hinder all meetings, that
may be made by those who dare continue in their rebellion, and seize as
many of them as they can.</P>
<P>5thly, That those of our friends, who have had any correspondence
in the north of England or in Ireland, may renew it, by sending some
trusty persons, to persuade our friends, in those parts, to take arms, at
the same time, which will be of great advantage, for many reasons that
are obvious.</P>
<P>6thly, You are to give orders from us to our friends, to have a genâˆ£tleman
ready, on the east coast of the Lothians, and others on the coasts
of Fife, Angus, and Mearns, that upon a signal, which shall be agreed
on, and will be given from the first ship that appears, they may be ready
<PB N="100" REF="115"/>
to come off with full accounts of the state of the country, and may
bring along with them some knowing pilots, who understand the depth
along the coast.</P>
<P>7thly, You are also to tell our friends to give orders, that all the
public moneys be kept within the shires, as also provisions of all kinds
unsold, and not sent away; and, that they inquire what provisions may
be about Edinburgh or Leith, or in any of the shires above mentioned;
but with great precaution in regard to the secret.</P>
<P>8thly, Those who are trusted, may take their own private methods,
to renew any correspondence they have had within the forts and garrisons;
and to secure, upon the landing, any places of strength fit for magazines.
All which is to be considered, with a special regard to the keeping of
the secret, it being much safer that several things be omitted, which,
might be very useful, than that any thing be recommended, which may
be a means of discovery.</P>
<P>9th, Lastly, you are to tell our friends, that we could not, with safety,
trust to these written instructions, the name of the geneal who is to comâˆ£mand
our forces under us, nor the particular places where we intend to
land; but that, as soon as it shall be proper and necessary, we will fully
satisfy them upon these two heads, as well as upon all other matters."</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="April." UNIT="month"/> The Pretender sailed from Dunkirk, on the 17th of March, N. S.
1708. Lockhart, in his Memoirs, supposes, with great probability, that
Lewis the XlVth never designed he should land in Scotland; and that
Fourbin had secret orders from his master, which he did not communicate.
It is, at least, certain, that there are many circumstances which seem to
justify this supposition; and that, if they had landed the troops, as they
might have done, the greatest part of the nation would have joined the
standard of the Pretender. Their pretended excuse for returning, as they
received no signal from shore, is either a proof of this, or of the happy
ignorance of the French, in every thing regarding Britain, in the only
period in which they could hurt this island. The fleet returned to Dunâˆ£kirk,
on the 7th of April. The Pretender, before he went to Flanders
to serve the campaign, renewed his correspondence with his adherents in
Scotland.</P>

<P>3dly, You are to assure them, that far from being discouraged with
what has happened, we are resolved to move heaven and earth, and to
leave no stone unturned to free ourselves and them; and to that end, we
propose to come ourselves into the Highlands, with money, arms, and

send back this bearer, well informed of their opinion concerning
it; as also with an account of the state of the nation, of what troops are
in it, of what country, and how inclined, and what number of men they
can bring into the field for us.</P>
<P>6thly, And in case they approve this our project, and promise to stand
by us, we desire that all means may be used to get possession of the fort
of Inverlochy, and that they would inform us of the fittest place in the
Highlands for our landing, and send along with the bearer two or more
able pilots, who know these places and can conduct us into them.</P>

had already such an effect in England, that, from the eagerness of every
one to withdraw his money, the princess of Denmark would have had
great difficulty to play the game, if the affair had been prolonged for
never so short a time: at least, it is certain, that far from sending any
succours to the allies, she would have been obliged to recall the greatest
part of her troops for her own defence.</P>

The signatures of the most considerable Scotch noblemen are an eviâˆ£dent
proof of their loyalty, and they have given no room to call it in

orders which his Majesty had given them, to undertake nothing before
the arrival and landing of the King of England, and especially to keep
the secret, preferable to every other consideration.</P>
<P>The King of England, far from being discouraged by the last enterâˆ£prise,
finds himself more animated and determined by it never to spare
his person; but to leave no means untried for recovering his dominions.
It is with this design that he prepares immediately to send one to the
Highlanders of Scotland with the following instructions:</P>
<P>To assure them, in case he finds them in arms, that his Britannic Maâˆ£jesty
will come immediately to put himself at their head, and to bring
them arms, ammunition, and money. If they are not in arms, to proâˆ£pose
to them to rise, with the like assurances, that the King of England
is ready to go in person to join them, in expectation that his most

done the instant they can be transported with safety. Lastly, to know,

<HEAD>1709.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1709" UNIT="year"/> THE violent Jacobites in Scotland complained, without reason, that
they were deserted by the prince whom they called to the throne.
The Pretender was not his own master, when he was carried to the coast
of Britain, in a French bottom. He had, with tears in his eyes, solicited
M. de Fourbir, to land him on the coast of North Britain, were it even
with his domestics only. But it seems, that the French admiral had reâˆ£ceived
secret orders, not to permit the Pretender to slip from his hands,
though it is difficult to say what use the court of Versailles could make
of that unfortunate prince, except the making a diversion, for a few
months, to the British arms. When the pretended prince returned to
France, he accompanied the duke of Burgundy into Flanders, and served
the campaign. The discontented Scots continued their solicitations to
the person whom they called their King, and he and his servants were
equally earnest with the court of Versailles, to prepare another expeâˆ£dition
into North Britain.</P>
<P>Lewis, for some time, listened with attention to the representations of
the Pretender. But a winter uncommonly severe, which destroyed the
fruits of the earth, added the misfortune of famine to the numerous disâˆ£tresses
brought on his people by the war. He, therefore, plainly told
the Pretender, that he was so far from being in a condition to invade the
territories of his enemies, that he was afraid he could not defend his own.
The discontented Scots were strangers to the low state of France; and
they endeavoured, as in the following state of the Highland clans, to inâˆ£duce
Lewis the Fourteenth to send aid, by representing their own power.
Nothing in the paper appears to have been exaggerated, though its maniâˆ£fest
design was to encourage a French invasion.</P>

<P>"THE Highlanders are used to arms from their infancy, and may
be reckoned as good as their equal number of the best regular
troops in Europe; and they have, on all occasions, (particularly under
the command of the marquis of Montrose for King Charles the First,
and the viscount of Dundee for King James the Seventh) in several
battles defeated above double their number of old regular troops; and
it is hardly possible to sustain their charge, if they be rightly led on;
they being superior both in their arms and manner of fighting to any
other troops.</P>
<P>The clans are here mentioned, with five hundred men to a regiment.
It is true, that some of them can bring more men to the field, and others
fewer; but, computing them one with another, they may be reckoned so.</P>
<P>The three great branches of the M<SUP>c</SUP>Donalds, viz.</P>
<P>CLANRANALD.â€”GLENGARIE.â€”Sir DONALD M<SUP>c</SUP>DONALD of Sleat.</P>
<P>The captains of Clanranald's family have still been loyal, and had a
good regiment in the fields for King Charles I. and II. and this present
captain, at fourteen years of age, was, with 500 men, at the battle of
Killicranky for King James VII. This family has suffered much for
their loyalty, by the oppressions of the family of Argyle, who have been
rebels for four generations by-past.</P>
<P>Clanranald's family and their followers are Catholics.</P>
<P>Glengarie his predecessor, the late lord M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, had still a regiment
for the service of King Charles I. and II. and this present Glengarie had
the same for King James VII.</P>
<P>This family has suffered much also by the family of Argyle. Both he
and his followers are Catholics.</P>
<P>Sir Donald M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald of Sleat was with his regiment at the battle of

<P>FARQUHARSONS.â€”M<SUP>c</SUP>INTOSHES.â€”M<SUP>c</SUP>PHERSONS.</P>
<P>The Farquharsons have still been loyal: for Findlay Farquharson of
Braemar and Inverey was killed carrying the royal banner at the battle
of Pinkie, in the year 1547, against the English. His grand-child,
James Farquharson of Inverey was, at 70 years of age, kept two years
prisoner at Edinburgh for his loyalty; and was forced to pay a considerâˆ£able
fine before he was released. His son, colonel William Farquharson
of Inverey, had still a good regiment for the service of King Charles I.
and II. under the command of the marquises of Huntley and Montrose,
and the earls of Glencairn and Middleton; and being still without pay,
and at his own charges, mortgaged all his estate for the said service, worth
about 500<HI>l.</HI> sterling a-year. Yet his son, colonel John Farquharson of
Inverey, was among the first who took arms for King James VII.; and
after all the other Highlanders had given over coming to the field, he
raised betwixt eight and nine hundred men, and sustained the small party
of the King's officers a whole campaign, acting offensively as well as deâˆ£fensive;
for which he had six parishes (belonging to him and his reâˆ£lations)
entirely burnt and destroyed, which was procured by the lord
Forbes and his family; one of the most rebellious in Scotland, and their
next neighbours. Witnesses of their last services and sufferings are coâˆ£lonel
Rattrey, major Holmes, lieutenant colonel Fitzsimons, and several
others present in France. Many of the name of Farquharson and their
followers are Catholics.</P>
<P>The M<SUP>c</SUP>Intoshes and M<SUP>c</SUP>Phersons, although they did not rise to arms
all of them, yet they still sent men to the field, both for the services
of Kings Charles I. and II. and for King James VII.; and are all of
them at present loyal. These three fore-mentioned branches, including
others lesser about them, can bring to the field, of very good men, 1500.</P>
<P>The M<SUP>c</SUP>Leans have still been loyal; their chief and 500 of his name
being killed at Inverkething, for King Charles II. by Cromwell. They
have been also in the field for King Charles I. and they had, at the battle
of Killicranky, for King James VII. five hundred men, and will be found
very ready, when the King shall have use for them. They are mightily
oppressed by the family of Argyle. They can bring to the field, of very

The Camerons have still been loyal, and have still had a good regiment
in the fields, for Kings Charles I. and II. and for King James VII. and

<P>The Stuarts and Robertsons of Athol have still been loyal, and have still
taken the field for the Kings Charles I. and II. and for King James VII.
notwithstanding the present marquis of Athol who was superior to the
most part of them, was then for the prince of Orange; but it is now the
better, that he himself is loyal at present. They may bring to the field,

<P>The Drummonds' loyalty is not to be doubted; since they will cerâˆ£tainly
follow their chief the duke of Perth, or his son the earl of Drumâˆ£mond.
They may bring to the field, of very good men, 500.</P>
<P>The M<SUP>c</SUP>Kenzies are neither to be doubted; since they will follow their
chief the marquis of Seaforth. They, with other little names about
them, may bring to the field, of indifferent good men, 1000.</P>
<P>The Frasers are loyally inclined; and may bring to the field, of very

<P>The Sinclairs are esteemed loyal; and may bring to the field, of inâˆ£different

<P>The M<SUP>c</SUP>Kays and the Highlanders of Strathnaver; their superiors are
not loyal; yet their commons can be brought to the field, and may do
good service, being joined with others; they may make, of very good
men, 500.</P>
<P>The Rosses of Balnagowan; their chief is not loyal, yet his clan
might be brought to the field; and they may make, of none of the
best men, 500.</P>
<P>The Grants; their chief has been very violent against the late King,
and raised a regiment against him, and entertained it three years at his
own charges; yet his clan must be called to the field, and joined to
<PB N="120" REF="135"/>
others of unquestioned loyalty. They may raise, of none of the best of
men, 500.</P>
<P>The Campbells of Breadalbin; their superior, the earl of Breadalbin,
is a very cunning man; yet still pretends to be very loyal. They may
bring to the field, of indifferent good men, 500.</P>
<P>The Grahams of Menteeth and Stuarts of Down are loyal; and may
bring to the field, of very good men, 500.</P>
<P>The M<SUP>c</SUP>Neils of Galchyle, M<SUP>c</SUP>Lauchlans, M<SUP>c</SUP>Kinnons, M<SUP>c</SUP>Aulays,
M<SUP>c</SUP>Nabs, M<SUP>c</SUP>Gregors, M<SUP>c</SUP>Gibbons, M<SUP>c</SUP>Echins of Dumbarton; Argyle
and Stirling shires are loyal; and may bring to the field, amongst them
all, of very good men, 1000.</P>
<P>The number of all the men is 12,000.</P>
<P>That which is commonly objected against the Highlanders is, that
they do not keep discipline, and that they plunder.</P>
<P>To which it may be easily answered, that at all the times the Highlanders
were in the fields, they neither had pay nor provisions, but what Proviâˆ£dence
sent them from day to day; and each soldier being obliged to go
and search for himself, it was impossible to send an officer with each of
them: so abuses could not be prevented; and, were the most regular
troops in Europe in the same circumstances, they might be found as ill,
if not worse, than the Highlanders.</P>
<P>Most part of all Lowlanders are their inveterate enemies, and seldom
or never speak or write favourably of them, and that from mere envy;
because a Highland clan is capable to render the King better service than
some of their first nobility; and, as to their lesser, a dozen and more of
them cannot bring so many men to the field as one clan.</P>
<P>The King might likewise expect from the low countries of Scotland,
at least, 20,000 men; for the King hath generally, all the nation over,
three for him, for one against him. But supposing he hath but half,
as certainly he hath more, the militia of Scotland being 22,000 men,
that half has but to double their militia, which they may easily do, will
make above 20,000 men. But the King must carry arms for them.</P>
<P>Whereas the Highlanders are generally well armed of themselves; and,
at most, will not want above a fourth part of their arms.</P>
<P>The Lowlanders will likewise want officers.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>"THE King of Great Britain has been very sensibly chagrined that
his friends in Scotland have been kept so long in suspence, conâˆ£cerning
a second expedition into that country; but it was impossible to
come to any certain determination about it sooner, although the affair
was pressed with all possible earnestness. At last, his Majesty has reâˆ£ceived,
within a few days, a decisive answer, and he commands me to
communicate it to you from him.</P>
<P>I shall tell you then, that the project of a second expedition into Scotâˆ£land
has been proposed to his most Christian Majesty, in a very ample
memorial, in which nothing was omitted to engage him to enter into the
scheme, and to convince him, that the enterprise was as much for his
interest as for the interest of his Britannic Majesty. That his most Chriâˆ£stian
Majesty has been pleased to enter very cordially into the affair when
it was proposed to him; and that he has taken time to consider the proâˆ£ject,
and has testified a sincere desire to make every effort for putting it
in execution: but, after having duly weighed all things, and considered
the present situation of his affairs, his last answer has been, that, in the
present conjuncture, the thing was not practicable, considering that it
was absolutely impossible for him, at this time, to furnish all that was
necessary for such an expedition.</P>
<P>It is his Britannic Majesty's desire that you communicate this to all the
well-affected in Scotland, in order that they may take their measures to
preserve themselves to a more favourable time. The King did not deâˆ£mand
of his most Christian Majesty but 8000 men, with money, arms,
and ammunition in proportion. But that could neither be granted nor
transported, with safety, in the present state of the affairs of France.
When they are in a better situation, I hope the King of Great Britain
will feel the effects of it. But whatever may happen, he is determined
never to discontinue his efforts for the recovery of his dominions; and,
I doubt not, but soon or late he will succeed, although it is not easy to
foresee either the time or the manner. In the mean time, he recommends
to all his loyal subjects to take as much care as they can of their own
preservation. Every one knows the state of his own affairs, and what is
<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
most suitable for him to do for his own safety in this conjuncture; thereâˆ£fore,
in that respect, there are no rules to be prescribed to them. But
his Majesty always depends upon the continuance of their loyalty; and
he is thoroughly persuaded, that he will always find them well disposed
to give him proofs of their zeal and affection, every time he shall have
occasion for their assistance."</P>

<P>The States General having informed the courts of Vienna and Great
Britain, that the president RouillÃ¨ was come to them from France,
with general offers of peace, prince Eugene and the duke of Marlboâˆ£rough
were sent, by their respective courts, to the Hague, in the beginâˆ£ning
of April, 1709. To these generals, who were buoyed up with the
hopes of penetrating into France the next campaign, the overtures made
on the part of Lewis XIV. seemed not to be satisfactory; and the duke
of Marlborough came back to London on the 17th of April. His proâˆ£sessed
design was to acquaint the Queen that the French overtures were
rejected, and that the allies were determined to prosecute the war with the
utmost vigour. In the meantime, RouillÃ¨ dispatched a courier to Paris
for further instructions; and Lewis immediately sent the marquis de
Torcy, his secretary for foreign affairs, with fresh offers to the Hague.
In all the conferences held to settle the preliminaries of peace, it was deâˆ£manded
by the allies, and granted by Lewis, that he should abandon
the Pretender, and dismiss him from his dominions. This produced the
following letter and memorial to the marquis de Torcy, about a place
of security for the Pretender, a dowry for his mother, and an indemnity;

<P>"I HAVE the honour to send you a memorial concerning the inâˆ£terests
of the King, my master; and I hope you will approve of
the method which I have taken, of inserting nothing in it but what might
serve for an instruction to your negociator, in case the King approves it,
<PB N="123" REF="138"/>
reserving to myself to explain to you here the sentiments of the King of
England, because that mixture might occasion some confusion.</P>
<P>Although France is the only country in which his Britannic Majesty
can find any consolation, out of his own country, yet, since the enemy
insist upon his leaving it, he asks the King's permission to do so, as the
only means of giving him a testimony of his gratitude. The ecclesiaâˆ£stical
state is excluded, for reasons too evident to be specified; and likeâˆ£wise
the Swiss Cantons, because there he would be deprived of the society
of men, and at too great a distance from what he ought never to lose
sight of; and he would have no neighbours there but goats, who could
walk out and resist the rigour of the winter. The Spanish Low Counâˆ£tries
are named only in preference.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that sentiments are divided here about the article of the
indemnity. Some say that those who are at home will complain, with
justice, that they are abandoned to the fury of their enemies; and that
those who are here, will exclaim that they are neglected, that they might
subsist at home, if they could return in safety, and that this court will be
delivered from a number of troublesome people, who will die of hunger
after our departure. Others think, that a security for the past will render
them useless for the future; that self-love is a powerful motive for exâˆ£citing
the generality of men to perform their duty; that severals may
return from thence full of ill-humour, and in order to be well received,
will become informers, which would produce very bad effects; and also,
that this would weaken the Irish regiments in the service, many of whom
will be seized with the sickness of the Swiss. It is hoped the King will
be pleased to decide upon this diversity of opinions.</P>
<P>With regard to the Queen's dowry, her Majesty orders me to tell
you, that after her death, and the restoration of the King, her son, she
gives the million in the town-house to his Majesty, to refund, in part,
some small share of his bounty. But above all, his Britannic Majesty insists
most earnestly not to be named in the article which concerns the Queen;
for, although there should be no express condition, all the world will
suppose that his honour will be deeply wounded by it. He will be abanâˆ£doned
by all his good subjects, and will find himself exposed to the conâˆ£tempt
of every one, which such a suspicion will insallibly draw upon
him."</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>"ALL that regards the King of England's interest in the present conâˆ£juncture,
may be reduced to three articles.</P>
<P>In case the enemy insist that the King of England leaves France, noâˆ£thing
will be more natural and reasonable than to ask them a security for
him. It is to be wished it may be general. If, however, this meets
with difficulties, let them grant it, at least, in a country that suits
them. For there are countries where he will never put his foot, such as
the Pope's territories, and the Swiss cantons. The Spanish Low Counâˆ£tries
appear to be the most commodious, from their situation, and beâˆ£caufe
there will be no occasion for a security but from the Dutch, and
from the sovereign of the country, who must oblige himself to allow the
King to live at full liberty, with a permission of travelling through all
his dominions, of choosing the place of his residence, and of changing it,
and of leaving his territories and coming back again, without being
obliged to take passports, or to give any explanations of the motives of
his journies. A prince cannot be too delicate in such a case; and they
cannot, if they act sincerely, refuse him the privileges which the law of
nations gives to private persons in time of peace.</P>
<P>It is proposed likewise, that his Majesty may be pleased to sollicit
earnestly for an indemnity to all those who have followed the late King
of England, and the King's son, as well as for those who find themselves
exposed to troublesome enquiries at home, for having done their duty
since the revolution in England. If they make the same demand for the
Hugonots, it will be a mere evasion; for they are desirous of keeping
them, designing, by a general act of naturalization, to draw to them
every one who is not a Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>It is not believed that they will make great difficulty about the Queen's
dowry for the future, but about her arrears, although they cannot deny
but they are due for upwards of twenty years. If that cannot be obâˆ£tained,
we must propose the time of the peace of Ryswick, when the
dowry was granted, and when the prince of Orange broke his word;
although he received from his parliament a fund for keeping it, he always
found pretences for doing so. There is another term, which is common
<PB N="125" REF="140"/>
to all widows, and that is the death of their husbands, and the right
ceases at the death of the Queen. But when the worst comes to the
worst, we must accept it as they will choose to give it. It may be likeâˆ£wise
proposed, that in case they pay the Queen all the arrears, which
amount to a million sterling, her Majesty will renounce absolutely her
dowry, the revenue of that sum being precisely 50,000 l. sterling, at five
per cent. By this means several embarrassments will be avoided, her
Majesty will be assured of her revenue, without authorizing any one in
England to receive it, and without disputing about the form of disâˆ£charges;
for they may exact such as she never will grant, much less
will she seek redress in their courts of justice; and to answer the chicane,
which was used after the peace of Ryswick, that this money might be
employed against them, his Majesty may oblige himself to place the sum
immediately in the town-house of Paris."</P>

<P>"I Imagined I had the honour of seeing you after the council yesterday;
but not being able to join you, I delayed to write to you, until the
arrival of a courier, which we expected in the course of the day. His
departure from the Hague being delayed, as he is not yet arrived here,

the King, which were delivered to me the day before yesterday, in orâˆ£der
that you may give an account of them to the King, your master, and
to the Queen. He had a long conference with lord Churchill and Mr.
Townsend, about the interests of the King of England. After great difficulâˆ£ties,
which they imagined to find in obtaining payment of the Queen's dowâˆ£ry,
which they allege is contrary to the laws of England, they confined
themselves, at last, to say, that they would desist from their demand of
the King's changing his place of abode; or, if they were obliged to inâˆ£sist
upon his leaving France, that it would be just, in that case, his exâˆ£pence
should fall upon them, and that his Majesty might choose his
place of abode, remain there in all security and change from place to
place, as would suit his conveniency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>De Torcy himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memoirs of the Marâˆ£quis de Torcy, vol. i.</NOTE> in a letter to Lewis XIV, dated from the Hague, the 12th of May, gave the following account of his conference with the duke of Marlborough on this subject.</P>
<Q><P>"He, the duke of Marlborough, added, that this same lord (meaning lord Townsend) had orders concerning the King of England, whom he stiled Prince of Wales. He exâˆ£pressed a strong desire of being in a capacity to serve him, as the son of a King, for whom, he told me afterwards, he would have spilt the last drop of his blood. That he believed it was his interest to remove out of France; and when I asked him, to what country he should retire, and in what manner he was to subsist, he agreed, in respect to the first arâˆ£ticle, that this prince should be at liberty to fix his residence whereever he chose, should enjoy perfect security, and be his own master, to go whereever he judged proper.</P>
<P>The article of his subsistence met with greater obstacles. I proposed to him the exâˆ£pedient of the Queen's dowry. He said, that the laws of England rendered the payment of that sum extremely difficult: however, he begged of me to insist strenuously on this article, when my lord Townsend and he came to speak to me about it, in the conferences. This lord, he said, is a kind of an inspector over me; though he is a very honest man who has been chosen through my means, and of the Whig party, before him I must speak like an obstinate Englishman; but I wish, with all my heart, I was able to serve the prince of Wales, and that your solicitations afforded me an opportunity of doing it."</P></Q></NOTE>.

<P>"I Have shown to the King, my master, and to the Queen, the letter
which you did me the honour to write to me, to-day; upon which
their Majesties have commanded me, to beg of you to remark three
things:</P>
<P>1st, With regard to their saying, that they cannot pay the Queen's
dowry, as being contrary to the laws of England. In that they are not
sincere; for, although they have converted the fund to other purposes,
there never was any legal decision against her Majesty or her pretensions;
and the parliament, after the peace of Ryswick, acknowledged them so
fully, that they granted, without any difficulty, the whole sum, which
the prince of Orange received, and detained upon an ill founded chicane.</P>
<P>2dly, Their offer to charge themselves with the maintainance of the
King, my master, in case he leaves France, is to be suspected; and inâˆ£deed
one may easily perceive, that the malicious design of it, is to make
the world believe, that he renounced his pretensions, on account of this
pension, and at the same time, to have it in their power to reduce him to
the last extremity, which his Majesty will rather endure, than expose himâˆ£self
to be suspected of such meanness. I had set forth in a memorial all
I now say, and explained it more fully in a letter I sent to M. de Torcy,
the evening before he set out.</P>
<P>3dly, The King of England is highly pleased, that a general security
is agreed to, in case they insist on his changing his place of abode. But it
ought to be considered, whether the word of these two English gentlemen
<PB N="128" REF="143"/>
may be depended on: for, it would be better to have a written deed,
signed by all the confederates, to be inserted by the mediator, among the
acts of the treaty.</P>

were to serve as a foundation for a general peace; and before it was
publickly known that their master would refuse his ratification of them,

for them, in the congress at the Hague.</P>

the Hague was continued. June, 1709."</HEAD>
<P>"THE first step to be made, is to endeavour to persuade the King
of France, to use his interest, by his ministers, at the treaty, to
have leave and security for a person to appear there from the King, only
to give in a memorial in the King's name to the mediator, representing his
just pretension, and protesting against any thing that may be agreed
upon in the general peace, contrary to the right and title he has to his
crown; which, as it will not hinder the plenipotentiaries to conclude
the peace, as they shall agree upon it together, so it is hoped they
have no interest to refuse to an injured prince, the satisfaction, at least,
of giving this public testimony to the world, of his not renouncing his
right, or acquiescing to any thing that may be done in this treaty to his
prejudice, which is all the benefit required. To facilitate his demand,
it may be represented, that the King does not require the person he
sends should be owned as a plenipotentiary in form from the King of
England; but only that he should have security to go and return, and
not be refused access to the mediator, to deliver his message and proâˆ£testation,
from the King and in the King's name, leaving to the mediâˆ£ator
the liberty, in his answer, to give or refuse the title to the King,
as he shall think sit, only that he be obliged to enter the fact in his proâˆ£toco'e,
that such a message, memorial, or protestation was delivered to him,
<PB N="129" REF="144"/>
such a day, by such a one, in the name of the Pretender to the crown
of England, if he will not directly give the King his title.</P>
<P>If this cannot be obtained, at least it may be proposed, that the proâˆ£testations
be given by one of the French plenipotentiaries, and entered,
as given by him in the name of the King, because he could not have
leave and security for a minister of his own to go and deliver it.</P>
<P>If even that be refused, there is no other method left, but to send the
protestation in blank covers, by the post, to all the plenipotentiaries, and
publishing it in gazettes and otherwise, and mentioning, at the same time,
that the King asked a passport, for a person to go in his name to proâˆ£test
in the formal manner, and was refused.</P>
<P>As for any thing that may be treated about the Queen's jointure, or
other things relating to the security of the King's person, in case of his
memorial from France, if Monsieur de Torcy pleases, he can always
obtain a pass for a private agent of the King's, to attend Mr. RouillÃ©,
and be at hand to represent the King's interest to him, and answer the
objections the English may make to him, and furnish him with memoâˆ£rials
and arguments, according as shall be concerted with the court of
France; and this person being an Englishman, and a person of known
trust, prudence, and integrity, may be of use as an interpreter with the
French minister, and may also, being under the security of public faith,
be able to insinuate and disperse fit memorials, to move and persuade the
English or others, that it is neither theirs nor the public interest of Euâˆ£rope,
to exclude the King from his right, and prefer Hannover."</P>

<P>"THE King of England believes that it would be necessary for his
service, and useful to his most Christian Majesty, to send to the
Hague, in the present conjuncture, one of his subjects who is a man of
abilities and fidelity, who is well instructed in his affairs and capable of
carrying on a negociation, who would have a communication with the
French plenipotentiaries, and act in concert with them in all things, for
the common interest, and in conformity to the instructions with which
he shall be intrusted, without giving him any character.</P>
<P>This man, having no public character, would not be subjected to ceâˆ£remonies,
and might insinuate himself and have access every where as a
private man, without being suspected to be of any party; and underâˆ£standing
the language, laws, customs, and manners of the English, he
might by frequenting them, discover their secret sentiments, and inform
the French plenipotentiaries of many things very useful, in the course of
the negociation, it being very much the humour of the greatest part of
the English, who may be very reserved with the French, to open themâˆ£selves
to, and place their confidence willingly in, a countryman, who
will appear to enter into their sentiments, and have the address, by disâˆ£covering
their different tempers, to insinuate himself into their favour
prudently and reasonably.</P>
<P>This secret agent, by going early to the Hague, before the opening of
the congress, will have time to renew the old acquaintances he formerly
had in that country, and to form new ones, to contract intimacies, and
manage intrigues and secret cabals, with the public ministers and other
men of credit of all the different nations, who may meet there in the preâˆ£sent
conjuncture, and of whom he may contribute to gain over some to
the interest of France, and to abate the violent opposition of others, by
undeceiving them in many wrong impressions with which they are preâˆ£possessed.
He will be able to inform himself, thoroughly and at leisure,
of the different interests of the plenipotentiaries, and of their cabals and

divisions among themselves, that he may take the advantage of them;
and, being of the same nation, he will have a more particular facility in
discovering the inclinations, designs, and schemes of the English pleniâˆ£potentiaries,
of whatever sect of religion they are, whose creatures they
are, and to what party in England they are attached; and, thus, knowâˆ£ing
their strength and their weakness, he will be able to give, from time
to time, excellent memorials concerning these things to the French pleâˆ£nipotentiaries.</P>
<P>And when the concerns of the King of England are in agitation, he
will be at hand to give informations to the said plenipotentiaries, conâˆ£cerning
the intentions and real interests of his Britannic Majesty; and,
when the English object the difficulties and chicanery of their laws, as
they have done already, without any foundation, in the affair of the
Queen's dowry, he will be able to tell the French plenipotentiaries, with
certainty, what is true or false in the allegations of the English, concernâˆ£ing
their laws, or the facts, which shall be contested, and to give them
ample explanations, on the spot by memorials, which will refute the chiâˆ£canery
of the English, and hinder them from imposing ambiguous exâˆ£pressions
and advancing as truths facts which are notoriously false.</P>
<P>The advantage of sending this man early to the Hague is evident;
for, in order to negociate with success, he must be on the spot before
they begin to treat in form, in order to acquaint himself thoroughly
with the different characters of those with whom he may have to do, to
study their humours, their public and private interests, and to tamâˆ£per
with those who have credit with the principal ministers, endeavourâˆ£ing,
in that manner, to discover their sentiments, and to find means of
gaining them, or at least of appeasing them, on several articles, from moâˆ£tives
of personal interest, joined to all the other reasons of justice and
equity which can be suggested to them. Now, all this cannot be done,
but slowly and by degrees. Their minds must be previously disposed,
and their prejudices removed, and a number of emissaries must be emâˆ£ployed,
in order to be well instructed in every thing that happens, and
to be always ready to seize every favourable opportunity. He must beâˆ£gin
in time, and spare nothing to gain over favourites, in order that he
may have free access to their superiors, and find means of insinuating
himself into their confidence, and of disposing them insensibly for a faâˆ£vourable

treaty; and, if all these intrigues and attentions are not begun,
and even carried some length before the congress opens, it will be very
difficult to begin them, with any hopes of success, during its continuance:
for then all the plenipotentiaries will be so occupied, with receiving and
sending of dispatches, with attendance on all the public and private conâˆ£ferences,
with receiving and returning visits, and discharging the ceremoâˆ£nial
and essential duties of their commission, that they will have so little
spare time as will render access to them very difficult; and as the part
they are to act will be determined by that time, and all or most of the
essential articles agreed upon, it will be too late then to hope to carry
on a negociation of any importance for the service of France, or for
that of his Britannic Majesty."</P>

<P>THE Hannover correspondence of the present year is connected with
the following facts. The lord Somers, who had been raised to the
office of president of the council, moved for an address to the Queen,
that she would be pleased to stipulate in the projected treaty, that the
French King should own the title of Queen Anne, and remove the Preâˆ£tender
out of his dominions. The minister, the earl of Godolphin and
the duke of Marlborough, who divided with his lordship the power of
government, were not averse from this motion. They seem to have secretly
wished his removal, as the surest means of giving him the eventual sucâˆ£cession
of the throne, after his sister's death; as they knew the unsurâˆ£mountable
aversion the people had to the receiving a sovereign from
France.â€”The Electoral Princess, afterwards Queen of Great Britain,
was delivered of a princess who was baptized, by the name of Anne, in
compliment to Queen Anne. The King of Sweden was stopt, in the
career of his victories, by the total defeat of his army, in the fatal battle
of Pultowa, which was fought on the eighth of July. Tournay surrenâˆ£dered
to the Allies on the thirtieth of the same month. The bloody
battle of Blaregnies or Malplaquet was fought, on the eleventh of Sepâˆ£tember;
and Mons surrendered, in the end of October. These are the
transactions to which the letters to and from the house of Hannover prinâˆ£cipally
relate.</P>

<P>It is the greatest human satisfaction that I can have in this world, to
find that your Electoral Highness does believe my wishes for your hapâˆ£piness

your Electoral Highness is graciously pleased to have for me. It is,
now, more than three years since the ministers of England took an occaâˆ£sion
to complain in parliament of a letter published under my name.</P>
<P>If my zeal for supporting the interest of the Protestant succession did
happen to carry me too far, yet I hope that your Electoral Highness
will pardon it; it being well meant, and I may be supposed to know the
constitution of our government.</P>
<P>But since that time, there hath not been the least thing laid to my

<P>I am not guilty of any crime against her Majesty, or the laws of Engâˆ£land;
and I hope, that my fidelity to your Electoral Highness will never
be looked upon as such.</P>
<P>If the ministers of England were then offended with me, without reaâˆ£son,
I cannot help it. They have their time, and their power and influâˆ£ence

the Queen's council, though impeached by parliament, that he can be

the particulars of the affairs of Great Britain, I imagined that I conâˆ£formed
myself to your inclinations, by depriving myself of the honour

have wished. But since, in the house of peers, I had the honour of
making a motion, which may become a solid foundation for securing,
more powerfully, the protestant succession, in the family of your Electoral
Highness, I could not deprive myself of the satisfaction of being among
the first to send you the address, which has been the result of this motion,
and which has passed, unanimously, in the two houses of parliament.</P>
<P>Your Electoral Highness may remember, that I employed the time
which I passed in Holland, and all my attentions to conclude there, with,
the States, a treaty which might secure our succession and their barrier.
But they rendered the conclusion of it impracticable for me, by the deâˆ£mand
which they made then of being put in possession of Oftend. Since
my return, there was little or nothing done in that affair. I hope that
the address of to-day will set on foot again that negociation, and produce
a league, for that effect, between most of the high allies. The two
houses concurred so unanimously in this address; the Queen received
it with so much satisfaction, and it has the public approbation to such a
degree; that I do not see that the nation can hear a peace mentioned, unâˆ£til
France is humbled, and obliged to admit such terms, that the sucâˆ£cession
in the protestant line will remain thereby certain and permanent.
And, for my part, I have nothing so much at heart, as to secure to my
country such a benefit, which I consider as a blessing of heaven; and to
give, on all occasions, certain proofs of the respectful attachment with
which I am, Sir, &amp;c."</P>

them, which was granted to him by an arrest of the council of state,
bearing date the tenth of April, 1699. In this there was the less diffiâˆ£culty,
that the said marquis de la Forrest had left the kingdom with the
late count de Roy, by an express permission from the King of France,
bearing date the tenth of May, 1683. Your Majesty will be pleased to

<P>In consequence of this arrest, the said marquis de la Forrest enjoyed
his estates in France, from the peace of Ryswick to his death. But his
estates having been seized anew, on the commencement of the present

after the conclusion of the future peace, his only son has reason to deâˆ£mand

I could not refuse him to write in his favour to your Majesty;

derive advantages to himself, from appearing eager to furnish Lewis XIV.
with the means of obtaining that restoration of the public tranquillity,
so much wanted by his kingdom, found means to obtain leave, in the
end of the year, to make a journey to Paris, to forward that important
business. Though the proposals which he brought back to Holland
were not relished by the Dutch, who were entrusted with the negociation
by the rest of the allies, the French King was permitted, at length, to
send plenipotentiaries to treat about a peace. These were the Mareschal
d'Huxelles, and the AbbÃ© de Polignac. The States appointed Buys and
Vander-Dussen, their deputies to treat with the commissioners of the
French King; and the conferences were opened at Gertruydenberg, on
the nineteenth of March, in the present year. The AbbÃ© de Polignac,
whose intrigues had almost placed the late King James on the throne of
Poland, was inviolably attached to the family of the Stuarts. The Earl
of Middleton, therefore, as soon as he understood that the AbbÃ© was to
be one of the plenipotentiaries, began to recommend to him the interests
of his master.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>While the plenipotentiaries of France were on their way to Gertruyâˆ£denberg,
the earl of Middleton wrote a letter to Mr. Regner Leers,
bookseller at Rotterdam, and sent him a memorial, to be communicated
privately to some of the members of the States General. The letter
is dated, at St. Germains, the 12th of March, 1710<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"12th March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, vol. ix. 4to. p. 5.</NOTE> I," Nairne, "sent away the French letter and memorial, directed,
A Monsieur Regner Leers, libraire sur le Nicuhaven Ã  Rotterdam."</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. fol. No. 26, 27.</NOTE>AFTER strong professions of personal affection and esteem, Middleton
desires him to make what use of the memorial his own discretion
should dictate to him; but enjoins him secrecy, as he had sent it without
the knowledge of the court of France. He thinks that the excluding
the King of England, and so many of his nearest heirs, from succeeding
to the crown, will, for a long time, continue dissensions and wars in
Europe, which his restoration alone can prevent; and to which he thinks
the neighbouring states, and particularly the Dutch, are, in common
prudence, bound to contribute. He asks a passport for a trusty person,
whom his master might send privately to them, to assure them of his
attachment, and to cultivate a good understanding with them.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="162"/>
In the memorial, the Pretender sets forth, that, as he will continue his
efforts for his own restoration and the deliverance of his people, a solid
peace can never be established, while so many millions of his subjects
were well affected to him. A strict union with England was necessary
for the United Provinces. His Majesty was sincerely disposed to cultiâˆ£vate
a good understanding with the States; and, from their great wisdom
and penetration, he hoped to meet with corresponding sentiments in
them, and that they would find acts of friendship towards a prince who
suffers unjustly, and never was their enemy, consistent with their own
interest, and with the principles of honour and justice. England is the
only rival of Holland in commerce, which will often occasion animosities,
that will often terminate in open wars. It is the interest of the States
to secure the friendship of the sovereign of that country. A Catholic
King will be less in a condition to carry on a war against them, than a
Protestant; and if he is but King of England, he can only carry on a
war by sea; whereas a Protestant prince, who has considerable territories
on the continent, and in their neighbourhood, can attack them by land,
as well as by sea.</P>
<P>He then recommends two points to their consideration. He asks their
good offices at the ensuing treaty of peace, in obtaining a security for
the payment of the dowry of the Queen his mother; and also a seâˆ£curity
for his own person, and for those who will follow him when he
leaves France. He gives the same reasons for these demands which are
contained in the memorials presented to the court of France last year.</P>
<P>It appears, that Leers wrote several letters, after receiving this memoâˆ£rial,
to the earl of Middleton. There are copies, in Nairne's hand, of
all his lordship's answers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. iii. 410. No. 5.</NOTE>He writes to him, on the third of April, that it was not his intention
to propose, that the States should, at this time, openly support all his
master's pretensions. He only meant, that they should obtain favourâˆ£able
terms from the English, concerning his mother's dowry and his own
personal security.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>In another letter to him, of the same date, he writes: <Q REND="inline">"I am ordered,
in the first place, to thank you for having informed me, that your friends
beyond the sea have consented to the payment of the dowry. I hope
<PB N="148" REF="163"/>
this payment will comprehend what is due for,<MILESTONE N="April." UNIT="month"/> at least, nine years back,
as well as what will be due for the future. But with regard to the place
to which the King is to retire, I am surprised, Sir, to see that Rome
or Avignon is proposed; and that Cologne or Liege are thought too
near. I entreat you to consider, that his Majesty, by removing to too
great a distance, would appear to renounce his pretensions. Now there
is no hardship which he is not determined to suffer, rather than give
room to suspect him of such meanness; and, though Avignon was situâˆ£ated
near Oftend, his Majesty would never set his foot in it; because his
enemies would contrive to make the general hatred to the Pope fall upon
him. I can assure you, that the duke of Marlborough explained himâˆ£self,
last year, to Monsieur de Torcy, in such a way, as to make him
conclude, that the King would be under no restraint, in choosing the
place of his abode, nor obliged to confine himself to any particular place;
and even that the English, by insisting that he should leave France, were
obliged to provide for his subsistence."</Q></P>

necessary for our maintenance in foreign parts, it may be accepted, proâˆ£vided
the article of agreement be clearly and absolutely expressed, withâˆ£out
any restriction or doubtful clause, which may imply our departing
from our right, or suspending our claim; and that the security and acâˆ£quittances
may be the same as the Queen our mother's, nor can the sum
be less.</P>

an indemnity for those who followed the King our father and us, conâˆ£form

<P>"I Have just seen Ogilvie, who sent me word yesterday he had more
to say to me, than was in his paper, which you have. This more
was no great matter, though much more than I believe; he pretends to
have seen lord Athol, Braidalbin, &amp;c. and that they say, that, if the King
of France cannot be brought to help them, they will do my business
themselves, provided I come to them. But then he brings no other seâˆ£curity
of what he says, but his own word, and an ample credential from
lord Drummond, whom he affirms to be sent by the rest. How imâˆ£probable
all this is, you may easily see. However, not to seem to
suspect the man, I was very civil to him, and took all he said as argent
comptant, for fear he should think to be discovered, and disappear
before the Queen's answer comes, which I shall expect before I do any
more in the matter. In the mean time, he says, lord Drummond won't
stir from Gand, where he now is, till he receives my farther orders.
This man is certainly employed by the government, to betray my friends;
so that when he comes to you (for I suppose the Queen will think that
necessary) one cannot have too great an eye over him, till one can, at
least, hear from Scotland, what ground there is for what he affirms.
But I refer to the Queen, to do, in this matter, what she thinks fit.
She has yourself and a few others to consult, and I am here alone, which
is far from easy to me, upon many accounts. But necessity has no law;
and that alone could have made me not carry you along with me;
though, at present, I really begin to believe I shall not be long from you;
for the enemies immobility looks very like a truce. I am sure we want
it, for we have no money, bread but hardly, though hitherto exactly
enough, and our list not above half complete. I shall say nothing of my
health, for you know from the Queen how that goes with me; but am
now at ease, that I am well enough to go to the army, if there be apâˆ£pearance
of action. My sister is charmed with your complaisance in
being her conductor in all her sorties, and, by what I can find, she is as
<PB N="156" REF="171"/>
well pleased to be at Chaliot, as you are to be out of St. Germains.
'Tis a fine evening, so I must end, to go and take a walk in a prettier
place, I believe, than you have in your palace at Chaliot, though I hear
it is very magnificent."</P>

<P>SOME years ago, Mr. Ogilvie was accused of being a man who
had sold himself to the government of England, and we expect
him here to-morrow. He passed through Ipres, and from thence to
Arras, where he presented himself to the King, my master, who recolâˆ£lected
directly, the informations he had of him; however, he heard him
favourably, though he advanced tales equally false and ridiculous. He
has named several persons of known probity, but without proofs, except
my lord Drummond, the eldest son of the duke of Perth, a man of
strict honour. But he is not the first, who has allowed himself to be
surprised by the artifices of a rogue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Drummond's father appears to have had a different opinion of Ogilvie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. D. N vol. iii. 4to. No. 9.</NOTE> for he

The disposition of the country has been laid before them again and again. If they intend any thing, what would they know, that is not already fully made plain. Your lordship will let the Queen know, that if Oâ€”be thought the fittest to carry the letters, he is still at Paris; and one may say more by word to him, than is fit to be put in writing.

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>The prosecution of Sacheverell having destroyed the influence of
the Whig-ministry with the people, the Earl of Sunderland, the son-in-law
of Marlborough, was dismissed from the office of secretary of state,
in June. A total change, in the servants of the crown, was no longer a
matter of doubt with the nation; though the persons who composed
the administration, used all their art to intimidate the Queen, that they
themselves might retain their power. The monied interest in the city,
in particular the governour and directors of the bank, represented the
danger of turning out the lord-treasurer, and such persons as he could
trust. The duke of Marlborough had influence sufficient with the allies,
to induce them to interfere in the cause of his party. The comte de
Galas, ambassador for the Emperor and King Charles the Third, together
with Vrybergen, the Dutch ambassador, represented to the Queen, the danâˆ£ger
of making any change among her servants. She however, though
she answered them politely, seemed determined not to comply with their
demands, except in the article of the duke of Marlborough's continuing
in the command of the army. The duke himself, with his usual address
and coolness, affected to acquiesce in the Queen's pleasure. But he seems
to have entered privately into a scheme of revenge, by his renewing,
with more warmth, his correspondence with the court of St. Germains.
The following letter from the earl of Middleton, will throw a complete
light upon this subject.</P>

to which no answer hath been made; and altho' he is not a man to be

for his own safety, there is reason to fear, that if we neglect him, he will
attach himself to the family of Hannover, which would be such a fatal
blow, that we must employ all possible means to parry it. These several
considerations have induced the Queen to write him a letter, of which
I inclose to you a translation, and her Majesty begs of you, Sir, to write
to the Mareschal de Villars, to put under his cover, the letter which the
chevalier de St. George will give him, and to send it to his adversary by

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT you wrote to your nephew, on the 13th of the last month,
is of so great importance to Mr. Matthews [the King] and
yourself, that I think myself obliged, for your interest and his, to write
to you my opinion of it, with my own hand; your nephew, who set
out from this place suddenly, being now at too great a distance.</P>
<P>I shall tell you, in the first place, that as I was glad to find you still
continue in your good resolutions towards Mr. Matthews [the King], I was
surprised, on the other hand, to see that you had a design of quitting every
thing, as soon as the peace was concluded; for I find that to be the only
means of rendering you useless to your friends, and your retreat may prove
dangerous likewise to yourself; you are too large a mark, and too much
exposed for malice to miss; and your enemies will never believe themâˆ£selves
in safety, until they have ruined you. They will reduce the army,
and the troops that are allowed to stand, will be all composed of their
own creatures. All the civil offices and military employments will be
filled by men who are of their party. They will change the officers of
<PB N="159" REF="174"/>
the revenue, and the credit of these new officers, with the influence which
the preachers of their party have over the people, will not fail to proâˆ£duce
a new parliament of a very different temper from the present: thus
your enemies will have all the power to hurt you, and you know well,
they will not want the inclination.</P>
<P>I beseech you, therefore, to reflect well, before you deprive yourself
of the means you have in your hands, to support yourself and to assist
your friends.</P>
<P>But, as you are lost, if you quit your employments, I see likewise, on
the other hand, that it will be very difficult for you to keep yourself in
office, as things are now situated, fo that your interest itself declares now
for your honour. You cannot be in safety without doing justice, nor
preserve your greatness without discharging your duty, and the time is
precious to you as well as for us.</P>
<P>The advice you give us, in sending us to the new favourite <HI>(lady)</HI> is
very obliging; but what can we hope from a stranger who has no obliâˆ£gation
to us? Whereas, we have all the reasons in the world to depend
upon you, since we have now but the same interest to manage, and you
have the power to put Mr. Matthews [the King] in a condition to proâˆ£tect
you. Lay aside then, I beseech you, your resolutions of retiring.
Take courage, and without losing more time, send us a person in whom
you have an entire confidence; or if you have not such a man with
you, allow us to send you one whom we may trust, in order to concert
measures for our common interest, which can never be properly done
by letters. We shall know, by your speedy and positive answer to
this letter, what judgment we can form of our affairs.</P>
<P>I must not finish my letter, without thanking you, for promising to
assist me in my suit at the treaty of peace. My cause is so just, that I
have all reason to hope I shall gain it; at least, I flatter myself, that Mr.
Matthews's sister [princess of Denmark] is of too good a disposition to
oppose it."</P>

<P>"I Received, this morning, yours of the 22d; but have not yet heard
of the young Hollander, who is, I suppose, at Peronne, waiting
for a convoy to come hither, by opportunity. The more I hear of
captain Gray, the worse I like him. I am sure I don't believe one word
he says; but since there is nothing to be done out of hand, there is yet
no harm done, though I confess I am still of opinion, that, if it were
possible, he should be kept in France, for fear of the worst. In the
meantime what you propose of writing to Mordecai is absolutely necesâˆ£sary,
and the sooner the better. When I receive the Queen's packet,
I shall, I suppose, know the end of the business; and, till then, can say
no more of it.</P>
<P>I shall not write to the Queen to-day, having nothing to say to her
more than what is above. Present my duty to her. I am sorry my
sister's bleeding succeeded so ill: but I hope now she is well, she will
not want it. I have, at last, quite done with physick, and I hope, with
my ague, and that with only ten doses of quinquina; but shall still keep
possession of my gate house, till the army removes, which must be soon.
Our Hector [Villars] doth talk of fighting in his chariot; but I don't
believe him, especially now that the conferences of peace are certainly
renewed. M. de Vauban, who came from Bethune, on Wednesday,
was told so by some of the enemy's generals. Letters from Tournay
speak of it, and now even the gazettes themselves. I cannot but hope
now they will break off no more. I am sure Mrs. Betty [himself]
heartily wishes it, that she may quit Mr. Williams's country [France, of
which she is quite weary, on all accounts. You will have seen, before
this, Gurney's [Marlborough's] letter to Daniel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is very little about Marlborough's correspondence with the duke of Berwick in Mr. Nairne's papers; but it appears by a letter from the marquis de Torcy to Lewis XIV. dated from the Hague, the 12th of May, 1709, that letters on some interâˆ£esting subjects passed between them.</P>

play, musick, a very great and good supper, and then dancing and
masks. I left them at 12 o'clock, with the resolution of sitting up till

<P>YOU know very well it was far from my inclination not to carry
you along with me to the camp; but, at the same time, the
reasons which hindered me from doing it, have not hindered me
often from regretting the want of your company: since I am here, I
said something of it in my letters to the Queen; and I find, by what she
said, you understood I ordered you to come down, which was a mistake,
as she will have told you before this; for as much as I desire your comâˆ£pany,
and to have at least one wise man with me, yet I think you will
be more necessary where you are than here, and therefore I must prefer
my interest to my private satisfaction, especially now that I am half seas
over. I thought to have gone out this evening, but the weather is so
hot, that I shall take this day's rest, after the two last days work. Booth
tells you our news; so I shall only add, that we begin now to hope we
shall end the campaign on the banks of the Canihe. Our general doth
all he can to end his with the enemy; and I left him just now in hopes
of at last compassing that work: but I said too much on that article yesâˆ£terday,
and am resolved to say no more of it, but mere matter of fact;
but I own it is hard not to lose patience, when other people lose their
reason. I was surprised to find, by my sister's letter of the 30th, that
the Queen had been ill at Marli, but am mighty glad it is so well over.
Present her my duty.</P>
<P>I gave the Mareschal this day the Queen's packet, which I reckon
gone by this time. Though Follette has said nothing of her children,
yet Hector has again writ about them. I could not put off his writing
about them till I heard from you, because he had now no other pretence,

<P>"YOU would have received the inclosed memorial sooner, if it had
not been necessary to send it first to the King, my master, in order
<PB N="164" REF="179"/>
to have his approbation, and receive his orders concerning it. Although
we were unwilling to repeat over again former memorials, it was, howâˆ£ever,
judged necessary to put you in mind of some principal points.
You will find in it again the word Capital; for if you begin with this
project, you will find every thing that is necessary to make it so. But,
if in preference, you mean to execute every other design, and to put off
this as superfluous, I own, before hand, you will find nothing in it.</P>
<P>All that is new in this memorial is, the state of England, and the deâˆ£mand
made of the Irish troops. As to what regards England, it is a
matter of indifference to you whether the parliament be dissolved or not;
or whether the high or the low church prevail. You will always find
they are your enemies; and I am very sorry, Sir, to tell you, that even
our friends will do nothing for you, while you do nothing for them.
They don't believe you are disposed to do any thing; and there is noâˆ£thing
but an actual landing which can cure them of their credulity.
That will contribute to conceal the design in that country; but it will be
more difficult to conceal it here, because all conversations at the Thuilâˆ£leries,
and in Coffee houses, run upon this project; and the voice of
the people desire it, as the only remedy to their calamities.</P>
<P>With regard to the demand of the Irish troops, I consider it as granted,
because it cannot be conjectured from what motive it can be refused;
since, besides the convincing reasons of the memorial, the Irish making
but half the number of troops which was proposed, the armies will be
less diminished by it, and they will be transported with less difficulty,
and at less expence; and it is essential to the service to do every thing
which humanly may secure its success, since thereby we shall gain our
cause.</P>
<P>If the bad news from Spain are confirmed, they should forward this
project, because he will be more pressed on all sides, and you will have
no favourable prospect from any other quarter. In short, it is necessary
to determine upon something. Even though this project should be difâˆ£ficult,
a peace is impossible; therefore there is no choice. I am, Sir,

and of the Irish.â€”The present state of England;â€”and the opinions of the
opposite parties.â€”The King offers to make a descent in Scotland with the
Irish troops.â€”The place of embarkation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>IN the several memorials which have been formerly presented to the
court of France from his Britannic Majesty, concerning his re-estaâˆ£blishment,
it hath been shown, that a well-concerted enterprise against
Scotland would be the most certain means to accomplish it; and that
that enterprise would, at the same time, be the most efficacious, not to
say the sole means, to break the confederacy of the enemy, and to reâˆ£establish
France in its former superiority: that all the other means tried
till then, whether by force of arms or by negociations, had produced no
effect: that the enterprise against Scotland had been tried only once
that it was evident to all the world it would have succeeded, if several
obstacles had not occurred; and that both friends and enemies acknowâˆ£ledged
that, if his Britannic Majesty had landed then, all Scotland would
have declared for him, the bank of England would have been shut up,
and consequently the government of England overturned, and the league
dissolved.</P>
<P>It hath been shown, in these memorials, that the changes which hapâˆ£pened
in Scotland since that time, were all advantageous to the King;
that the people were irritated more than ever against the present governâˆ£ment,
on account of the bad treatment they had received from it: that,
at the same time, no one had deserted the King's party, even after the
bad success of that enterprise: that no secret had been ever kept like this
one; since, of so great a number, both of the nobility and of the prinâˆ£cipal
persons among the commoners, there was not one who would acâˆ£knowledge
any thing, or accuse any of those who had been apprehended,
notwithstanding all the threatenings and all the promises of the governâˆ£ment;
and that witnesses could never be found to condemn any one of
those who have been apprehended, whatever efforts were made by the
<PB N="166" REF="181"/>
servants of the government for that purpose; so that there can be no
doubt of the good disposition of the Scots.</P>
<P>With regard to the Irish, it hath been likewise shown, in these memoâˆ£rials,
that their disposition hath been always the same with regard to
their lawful sovereign, founded upon interest, liberty, and religion; and
it may be added, that the Catholics, who are at least six to one Proteâˆ£stant,
are reduced to such despair, by the last persecution of the English
government, and are more disposed than ever to hazard all, and to unâˆ£dertake
every thing, in order to free themselves from the oppression they suffer.</P>
<P>It is very true, that in the memorials which have been hitherto preâˆ£sented,
the same assurances could not be given of the disposition of Engâˆ£land;
all that could be said of it, with certainty, was that an insurrection
in Scotland, in the King's favour, would have thrown the affairs of Engâˆ£land
into confusion. But now, it is very evident, that the surprising
changes which have for some time appeared in the affections of the peoâˆ£ple
of England, and which are seen to increase every day, leave not the
smallest room to doubt of their being well disposed towards their lawful
sovereign.</P>
<P>Two parties, animated to an extreme against one another, evidently
establish the right of that prince in their public writings. The high church
maintain, as a principle of their religion, that it is never allowable to
resist their King for any cause whatsoever; and that the hereditary sucâˆ£cession
is a law so fundamental, that the parliament itself cannot change
it. The low church, to show the high to be enemies to the present goâˆ£vernment,
maintain, that the consequence of the first of these principles
is, that the government, since the Revolution, hath been but a continued
usurpation, and that the princes who have occupied the throne, have
been but usurpers; and that the consequence of the second principle is,
that the Pretender must be acknowledged as lawful King. The people,
attentive spectators of this dispute, have no difficulty in concluding that
both the one and the other are in the right; and the princess, who is in
possession, by taking the high church into her considence, and giving
them the best employments, seems to declare intelligibly enough, what
are her inclinations towards her brother. This far the invisible hand of
<PB N="167" REF="182"/>
Providence hath already conducted this affair; employing even its
greatest enemies to advance it, without their perceiving it.</P>
<P>It is therefore very evident, that the present situation of his Britannic
Majesty's affairs is more favourable than ever; and that, according to all
appearances, he need only have patience for a little time, as several of
his Majesty's friends in that country advice him, and leave Providence to
act, in order to enter into the possession of his right, by the means of his
own subjects alone.</P>
<P>But, however well founded these hopes of his Britannic Majesty from
his own subjects may be, he is not the less sensibly affected with the bad
state of the affairs of France; and this is what induces him to offer now
again to expose his person in a second attempt in Scotland, in order to
procure to France a peace, of which she has so much need, providing
the Irish troops are given to him to attend him in the enterprize. This
he judges so absolutely necessary for the interest of France, as well as his
own, that, without it, he believes it is needless to think of such a proâˆ£ject.</P>
<P>His Britannic Majesty would wish that he had no occasion for any
troops for this expedition. But, however well assured he may be of the
good will of the greatest part of Scotland, yet, as all the fortresses, as
well as the regular troops of the country, are in the hands of the governâˆ£ment,
and ready to act by their orders, it is absolutely necessary, for the
security of his Majesty's person, as well as for the success of the enterâˆ£prize,
that he should have a sufficient number of troops with him at
landing, to oppose the enemy, until his faithful subjects have time to
assemble and to join him. The prince of Orange, although he was sure,
before hand, of all the most considerable men in England, and even of
the chief officers in the army of the late King of England, as appeared
sufficiently by the event, judged, however, that it was improper to unâˆ£dertake
the enterprize without being attended with fourteen thousand
regular troops.</P>
<P>In the former memorials, the King of England could never demand
less than six thousand men; his subjects having always asked eight thouâˆ£sand
men to secure the success of the expedition. It is true, in lord
Drummond's last memorial, three thousand men only are mentioned.
<PB N="168" REF="183"/>
But it is likewise true, that that nobleman does not deny, but he has conâˆ£certed
his projects with the Highlanders alone, without the knowledge
of the chief men in the low country, who compose the greatest part of
the nation. Yet his Britannic Majesty, considering how difficult it would
be to transport a greater number, has limited his demand to the Irish
troops, his own subjects; who, at the end of the campaign, will be scarce
three thousand effective men. What absolutely determines his Majesty
to ask the Irish is, that they speak the same language, and are accustomed
to the hardy manner of living of the country; and that, of each Irish
regiment, two or three may be formed, by incorporating with them the
new levies of the country: besides, that it will be impossible to keep the
Irish in France, after they know that the King is landed in Scotland.</P>
<P>But there is likewise a reason, which his Majesty thinks he should not
pass over in silence, and which appears to him to be very essential;
namely, that the allies will no sooner see the landing succeed, than, dreadâˆ£ing
the consequences with which it must be infallibly attended to their
disadvantage, they will make fraudulent proposals of peace to France,
in order to ward off the blow. One of these proposals will be, to desire
the most Christian King to withdraw the troops who may have followed
that prince; and, as his most Christian Majesty will not choose to do so,
he will have a very justisiable excuse, in saying, that they are not his
subjects, but the subjects of the King of England, which he could not
say if they were native Frenchmen.</P>
<P>With regard to the transport of troops and other necessaries, in which
the greatest difficulty consists, those who have experience in maritime afâˆ£fairs
are the best, or rather the only judges of that affair. What is very
certain and necessary to be remarked here, is, that, unless this enterprise
is considered as a capital object to the state, difficulties will occur on all
hands to discourage, and imaginary dangers, which will become real
when things are done by halves: so that, to attempt it, in any other
view, will be useless to France and hurtful to the King of England. But,
if his most Christian Majesty will find this expedition of importance
enough to consider it as a capital object; in that case, money, arms, and
ammunition, as well as ships and troops, will be found without any difâˆ£ficulty;
and he will likewise find sea-officers, who will undertake it, and
who, with God's assistance, will accomplish it.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="184"/>
The port of Dunkirk has its advantages for the embarkation, on acâˆ£count
of the neighbourhood of the troops and the shortness of the pasâˆ£sage.
But the secret can never be kept: for every thing that is done
there is known the next day at Ostend; and when once the English and
the Dutch have discovered the design, they will be always in a condition
to thwart it.</P>
<P>It appears then, that Brest would be more suitable, because the eneâˆ£my
could not easily hinder the vessels from sailing from that port, as was
seen by experience, during the war in Ireland. In case the preference
is given to that port, the Irish troops should be put into winter-quarters
in the neighbouring provinces.</P>
<P>It might be likewise examined, whether Portpassage, near Fontaraâˆ£bia,
was sit for embarkation. In that case, the Irish regiments might be
sent to that quarter, as if they were to go to serve in Spain; and his Briâˆ£tannic
Majesty might repair thither, under the same pretext, and his reâˆ£moving
at a distance from his kingdoms would conceal the design.</P>
<P>In the case the troops embark at Brest or at Portpassage, they may
land anywhere on the west coast of Scotland, from Kirkcudbright to the
mouth of the river Clyde. It is true, there is no fortified harbour there,
nor in any other part of Scotland, which would render the landing more
easy. But, at the same time, the ships could not remain there afterwards,
in safety, in case they were pursued by a superior force.</P>
<P>With regard to pilots, they might be had from that country, though
not without giving some suspicion of the design. But, as ships from
Glasgow, Air, and Kirkcudbright, come ordinarily towards the month of
November, to Nantz and Bourdeaux, sailors to serve as pilots might be
taken out of them, on different pretences. Besides that, some might be
found among the French privateers, who cruize frequently on that coast;
as five or six of these privateers, not long ago, made a descent in Scotâˆ£land,
near Air, from whence they carried away some cattle and alarmed
the country. It may be known from them, where they got their pilots,
and their method may be followed.</P>
<P>The squadron, sailing from Brest or from Portpassage, may steer their
course through St. George's channel, or round the west of Ireland: the
first is the shortest course; but is esteemed the most dangerous. Yet the
English merchant-ships daily pass through that channel, at all seasons.
<PB N="170" REF="185"/>
In failing along the coast of Ireland, some Irish officers may be landed,
with arms, &amp;c. in order to put the inhabitants in a condition to rise.</P>
<P>But, without entering into a more ample detail of the measures which
should be taken to secure the success of the expedition; and referring, for
that purpose, to former memorials, we shall only repeat, in concluding,
that the success will entirely depend on the manner in which the enterâˆ£prise
is considered, as of greater or less importance to France. It is the
business of his most Christian Majesty to judge of this, by his consumâˆ£mate
prudence, and to determine according to the interest of his own
affairs."</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>The following anecdote deserves credit, from collateral proofs. There
is no doubt but Marlborough and Godolphin had talked about a scheme
of restoring the Pretender some time or other, without the assistance of
France. Godolphin was probably sincere; so would Marlborough have
been, should the thing itself happen to suit his interest.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Meâˆ£morandum-book, marked vol. xi. 410. p. 38.</NOTE><P>"LORD Godolphin had certainly the best head and capacity for a miâˆ£nister
of state of any man in England; and was a man that no
country in the world might be ashamed of. He had not the least tincâˆ£ture
of avarice, and was the uncorruptest man in his time, in the maâˆ£nagement
of the treasury and discharge of his offices. He was lord
chamberlain to King James's Queen, who had always (as Mr. Dillon told
me, April, 22d 1724) a very great opinion of him; and Mr. Dillon beâˆ£lieves
he really intended to serve the King. He has sent many of his
letters to that Queen; and the letters are still in being.</P>
<P>One reason, perhaps, why he did not execute what he projected, was
his cowardice. Nobody could have more of that temper of mind; and
he was so susceptible of fear, that the Whigs could bully and frighten
him into any thing.</P>
<P>This has made me remember what the E. of A., who was very intiâˆ£mate
with him, told me, in 1716, viz. That lord Godolphin was the
truest and sincerest friend to the King, that he ever had; and that, after
his disgrace, on Dr. Sacheverel's trial, about a month after he was turned
out, making him a visit, lord Godolphin expressed his concern at his
being turned out, before he had restored the King: that he had been in
unhappy circumstances and distressed by the Tories: that all his ministry
<PB N="171" REF="186"/>
had been spent in a struggle with the junto, whose hands the Tories had
forced him into; but that he saw himself at last master over them, when
he was turned out on occasion of the trial, which he was noways concerned
at but on the King's account. That, however, he was of opinion, lord Oxâˆ£ford
would restore him; but he would make France necessary to it, which
himself would not have done; for he would have restored him alone, and
made the French know how poorly they had treated him, and how little
they deserved at his hands; and the E. of A. believed him."</P></Q>

him. The trumpet being an Irishman, Pitts did not speak one word to
him; but in the morning he called a trumpet of the guard-de-corps
into his chamber, and shewed the medals to him, and bid him tell me,
he would give the medals back when he saw me, but never before. The
French trumpet came to me before the Irishman came home, and asked
me what those medals were; for that above thirty English officers spoke
to him to bring them medals. The fellow told them what was true, he
did not know what they meant. When you come back, go to the Chevaâˆ£lier

<P><MILESTONE N="1710" UNIT="year"/> THE Whigs frequently upbraided the Tories with being Jacobites,
and abettors of an arbitrary power in the crown. The Tories
charged the Whigs with being antimonarchical and republican. But if
one was to form his judgement of their principles from their own profesâˆ£sions,
it would be difficult to distinguish them, for both parties courted
popularity by the same arts, and publickly professed to espouse the sucâˆ£cession
in the protestant line. It will be seen by the correspondence
of this year, that each, as soon as they came into place, were equally
ready to make their court to the presumptive heirs of the crown.</P>
<P>To defend Queen Anne from being charged with inconstancy, weakâˆ£ness,
or ingratitude, for removing and disgracing men, who had served
her long and faithfully, doctor Swift insinuates, that the Marlborough
family had lost all favour with her Majesty, upon her accession to the throne,
though she possessed the art of disguising her passions so perfectly, as to
have been able to conceal, for a long time, the aversion she had conceived
for them. It is not probable, that her aversion began so early; and, tho'
it is not easy to guess when she began to be sensible of the haughty and
imperious behaviour of the party which governed her and the nation, it is
certain, that nothing contributed more to alienate her affections totally
from them, than their conduct and speeches in the course of doctor
Sacheverel's trial. Godolphin began the prosecution more from private
resentment, than state necessity, and imprudently furnished his enemies
with an opportunity of ruining him and his friends, when he unwarily
gave importance to a man and a cause, which he should have treated with
neglect and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="191"/>
The Queen was present at the trial, and listened with great attention
to the debates, in which a spirit of opposition betrayed both parties to
advance principles, which probably neither of them would follow to their
utmost extent. The Tories openly maintained the doctrine of herediâˆ£tary
right and nonâˆ£resistance; and the Whigs, in justifying the Revoâˆ£lution,
asserted a nation's right to depose and dethrone their sovereign,
and laid down maxims of government more favourable to the privileges
of parliament and the liberties of the people, than monarchs choose to
adopt.</P>
<P>The Tories had not strength to prevent Sacheverel from being found
guilty of all the articles for which he was impeached by the commons;
but they had influence afterwards to procure addresses to the Queen from
all parts of the nation, avowing the very principles for which he was conâˆ£demned.
These addresses asserted the doctrines of passive obedience and
non-resistance, and acknowledged the absolute power of the crown.
They condemned, as antimonarchical and republican, all doctrines which
allowed subjects to resist their sovereigns in any instance, and declared
the defenders of these doctrines to be advocates of blasphemy and imâˆ£piety:
they affirmed that the Queen acceded to the throne by a herediâˆ£tary,
and not by a precarious parliamentary right or election: they enâˆ£treated
a dissolution of the present parliament, and contained assurances
that none should be chosen in a new election, but such as should be loyal
to the sovereign and zealous for the church.</P>
<P>These addresses could not fail to be more agreeable to Anne, a woâˆ£man
and a sovereign, than those presented by the Whigs in a different,
though dutiful and respectful strain. In consequence of the first, she
determined to emancipate herself, and to change her ministry, notwithâˆ£standing
the success with which they had served her, and an interposition
in their favour by the ministers of the Emperor and of the Statesâˆ£general,
who were directed to represent to her Majesty what bad influâˆ£ence
a change might have on affairs abroad.</P>
<P>This change furnishes a new set of correspondents in the course
of this year, when the following persons came into office. The duke
of Shrewsbury was made lord chamberlain on the 13th of April, in
the room of the marquis of Kent, who was gratified with a dukeâˆ£dom.
Dartmouth was made secretary of state in the room of the
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
earl of Sunderland, who was turned out, the 14th of June. The earl
of Godolphin was dismissed the 8th of August, and in his room, earl
Powlet, Robert Harley, Henry Paget, Sir Thomas Mansel, and Robert
Benson, were appointed commissioners of the treasury. Though Powlet
was the first commissioner in form, it was well known, that Harley, who
was made chancellor and underâˆ£treasurer of the exchequer, had the chief
management of the treasury, and presided in every thing, behind the
curtain.</P>
<P>Mr. James Cresset, who had been formerly envoy extraordinary at the
courts of Zell and Hannover, was chosen by the new ministry to carry
assurances of their attachment to the presumptive heirs of the crown;
and upon his death, which happened soon after his nomination, the earl
of Rivers was sent to Hannover, in the month of August, with the same
commission. He was authorized to assure the princess Sophia and her
son the Elector, that the late changes, for which the Queen had suffiâˆ£cient
reasons, were rather favourable to them, and a further security for
their succession to the crown.</P>
<P>On the 21st of September the Queen issued a proclamation to dissolve
the parliament. The earl of Rochester was made lord president of the
council, in the room of lord Somers. The lord chamberlain's staff was
taken from the duke of Devonshire, and given to the duke of Buckingâˆ£ham.
Mr. Boyle was dismissed from the post of secretary of state, and
the seals were given to Mr. Henry St. John. The great seal, upon the
resignation of the lord chancellor Cowper, was given to Sir Simon Harâˆ£court;
and the lord lieutenancy of Ireland to the duke of Ormond, upon
the resignation of the earl of Wharton. The earl of Portmore was apâˆ£pointed
commander in chief of her Majesty's forces in Portugal, and the
duke of Hamilton lord lieutenant of the county palatine of Lancaster.</P>
<P>Harley did not make such an entire change as the Tories expected.
But the numbers who were turned out of office now, and on another ocâˆ£casion
soon after, sufficiently prove, that the Whigs had as carefully exâˆ£cluded
the Tories from all places of honour and profit, as the Tories
would have now excluded the Whigs in their turn. The military opeâˆ£rations,
mentioned in the correspondence of this year, are the taking of
Douay on the 26th of June, of Bethune the 29th August, of St. Veâˆ£nant
the 30th September, and of Aire the 9th November. The baron

<P>I Received, with great gratitude, the letter or the 5th or January,
with which your Majesty honoured me. There is nothing more
worthy or your zeal for the good cause, than the lively exhortations
which you take care to make to all the allies, to induce them to act with
more vigour than heretofore, against the common enemy; and nothing
would be more just than to imitate the great example which your Maâˆ£jesty
gives in that respect. It does not depend upon my representations,
that that does not happen in the Empire; but they have been hitherto so
ineffectual, that I dare not promise myself a better success for the future.
This obliged me to divest myself of the command of the army on the
Rhine, as I did myself the honour of notifying to your Majesty, by my
former letter. I would imagine, that I encroached upon your time, if
I repeated the reasons which it contains. I flatter myself that your Maâˆ£jesty
will honour them with your approbation, and that you will acâˆ£knowledge,
that nothing but an absolute necessiry could induce me to
adopt such a measure; and that feeing my presence useless with the army
on the Rhine, and my reputation exposed, I ought not to render myself reâˆ£sponsible
for the bad consequences which the disorders, that I endeavoured
so ineffectually to redress, might have. I shall not spare, however, either
my attentions or my exhortations to put things upon a better footing, and
I shall give the example, as much as it depends upon me. I entreat
your Majesty to be persuaded of this; and that I am, with great respect,
Madam, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Could not observe, but with great regret, the resolution which you
took of divesting yourself of the command of the army on the
Rhine, as you notified to me, in your letter of the 15th of January;
and confirmed again by another of the 6th of February. I am very sorry
<PB N="180" REF="195"/>
that you have had so many reasons to induce you to adopt that measure; <MILESTONE N="April." UNIT="month"/>
but, as I am persuaded that your presence with that army is of the last
importance, I cannot hinder myself from hoping, that matters will run
in a better train; and that the states of the Empire, seeing that they are
to lose such a leader at the head of their troops, will exert themselves to
remedy the disorders of which they complain: and for this purpose I
wrote, some time ago, to the princes and circles of the Empire; and I
pressed strongly his Imperial Majesty to remove the difficulties which
may hinder you: and I have reason to believe, that my representations
have had a good effect; for, I own, that my confidence, with regard to
that army, was always in your conduct and in your valour. And you
appear to me to be the only one who is able to render it, in some meaâˆ£sure,
useful to the common cause; and if you absolutely throw up that
command, I see nothing that can keep the enemy at bay, on that side.
The season for the campaign advances, and a diversion on the upper
Rhine will have an extraordinary effect to the advantage of the common
cause. It is for this reason I continue to shew you still the desire I have
that you may reconcile yourself to the command of the army on the
Rhine for this year: and I assure you, at the same time, that there is no
one who has your reputation more at heart than I. But I believe it
above every thing that can happen on that side, where all the world must
be convinced, that nothing will be wanting of what depends upon you,
for rendering the arms of the Empire more useful and more glorious than
they have been heretofore. I am, with a great deal of affection and
esteem, Brother, your affectionate Sister,</P>

<P>"I Received, with the utmost acknowledgments, the obliging letter
with which your Majesty honoured me. I doubt not but the inâˆ£telligence
which you will have received, after having written that letter,
of the state of affairs on the Rhine, have entirely convinced you, that
none of the deficiencies of which I complained have been supplied;
and that the army of the Empire will be less in condition than ever to
act in the manner which the interest of the Allies would require. Acâˆ£cordingly
his Imperial Majesty has so well comprehended the reasons
which I advanced to him, for quitting the command of that army, that
he has entirely acquiesced in them. This he has been so good as to noâˆ£tify
to me, by his letter of the 3d instant; and to inform me, at the same
time, that he conferred the command of that army upon prince Eugene
of Savoy; and that, without leaving the Low Countries, he would comâˆ£mand
the army of the Empire. I entreat your Majesty to be persuaded,
that I shall do, in other respects, whatever depends upon me, for conâˆ£tributing
to the good of the common cause, and for giving to your Maâˆ£jesty,

<P>"IT is with joy I presume, once more, with the most profound reâˆ£spect
imaginable, to address myself to your Electoral Highness;
and to tell you that her Majesty begins to reign, and that the oligarchy
which tyrannized and threatened so long the Queen and the British naâˆ£tions,
begins to vanish in this kingdom; where a little cabal made obeâˆ£dience
the duty of the sovereign, and dominion the prerogative of two or
three subjects for some years." He then tells him, that her Majesty has
placed herself on the throne and at the head of her treasury. That she
has sent bills of exchange to Holland, for paying her troops in Flanders
and Portugal; "and she has made sufficient provision for their payment
for the next six months, notwithstanding the tricks and chicane of the
lord Godolphin and his party."</P>
<P>"The nation in general adores her Majesty, and commends extremely
the conduct of the new ministry; who had the courage and loyalty so
seasonably to preserve the Queen and the monarchy. It is very certain,
that four years ago, the Queen thought of dismissing her treasurer and
her general. But the corruption of the two last parliaments always preâˆ£vented
her." By Mr. Harley's good offices, he says, the Queen received
the duke of Shrewsbury into her confidence, as well as Mr. Harley himâˆ£self,
"who was always very loyal and active, and religiously devoted to
the interests of her Majesty and the protestant succession, in the illustrious
family of your Electoral Highness."</P>
<P>"The Queen cannot avoid suspecting all those, who have a familiar
correspondence with her general, who had already set himself up as a proâˆ£tector;
and his creatures had the insolence, as well as the impudence,
during all the last winter, to drink to his health under that sine title."
He tells him, that the general and treasurer, afraid of contributing to the
<PB N="190" REF="205"/>
advantage of his Electoral Highness, and of restoring to the Queen the
liberty, of which she had been so long deprived, were induced to intrigue
with their party in the house of commons, to take notice of some impruâˆ£dent
expressions of the speaker; and, by that means to embarrass her
Majesty's affairs, and prevent their own fall. When Shrewsbury, he
says, was put in possession of his office, without the knowledge of the
treasurer or the general, his duchess, with her usual insolence, began to
quarrel with her Majesty. But her Majesty, wearied of hearing so much
abuse from such a peevish woman, forbad her to appear in her presence;
since which time, her Majesty has been allowed to transact business in
peace.</P>
<P>"At length the earl of Rivers is gone to fulfil the office which Mr.
Cresset<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cresset had been sent in capacity of envoy from her Majesty to his Electoral Highness.</NOTE> had to execute. An individual should never pretend to know
what the commissions of his sovereign contain, with regard to affairs of
state; of which, it is certain, the public is entirely ignorant. The caâˆ£bal,
and the public ministers of the foreign potentates, who were always
closely connected with lord Godolphin, and who were almost all seduced,
or rather charmed and bewitched by him, for very strong reasons, no
doubt, give out in their public walks and conversation, that lord Rivers
is sent by her Majesty to offer the command of the army to your Elecâˆ£toral
Highness; at least, to come over to this country and pay a visit to
her Majesty, &amp;c. What! say they, will a great sovereign prince, as
the Elector of Brunswick, leave his own dominions and visit the Queen?
or will he chuse to command an army after a general who has triumphed
so often, gained so many battles, and taken so many towns? These
wicked men have, for a long time, exposed your Electoral Highness in
this manner." He tells his Electoral Highness that Charles V. visited
Henry VIII. and that King William visited the duke of Zell and his
Electoral Highness. That, since her Majesty has thought proper to disâˆ£miss
her general, he asks, "if there is any one so proper to command
the armies of the Queen and the British nation, as the protestant sucâˆ£cessor?
in which protestant successor her Majesty and her people place
all their hopes," &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="206"/>
He prosesses his attachment to the Electoral family, and entreats his
Electoral Highness to accept of the command of the army. He exclaims
against the measures of the late ministry; and says, that her Majesty had
just reason to be offended with them: and he concludes, with praying
"God to preserve the person of your Electoral Highness, with your illusâˆ£trious
family."</P>

<P>"I Am sorry, that some business which intervenes hinders me from

me with a great deal of polite attention, for you and for myself, and deâˆ£sired
me to see him sometimes. The letter which you gave him to me,
was still in the bottom of his trunk.</P>
<P>Yesterday I received a visit, on your account. Monsieur de Hervart,
whom I do not visit, because I am afraid of new acquaintances and drop
the old, came to see me. At first, he spoke to me of you, and of the
esteem he had for you; this ended, in telling me, that as the Whigs
gave you some private advantages, you might hope for the same thing
from the new party, (in which he is deeply engaged). I answered, that
I did not believe the Whigs gave you any such advantages; that, if
it had been so, I would have perceived something of it, and that you
had a master, who was alone capable of rewarding your services. "I beg
of you," says I, "explain to me a little what you mean, that I may underâˆ£stand
you the better." He said to me, "what is expected from Monsieur
de Robethon is, that he should act in concert with the new party in
favour of the family of Hannover." This appeared to me, to have been
suggested to him, by Mr. St. John, the new secretary of state, with
whom I find he is so much connected, that I have little doubt, but he
will be sent back to Switzerland. I replied, that you would always do
your best, to support the interest of the Elector, and to shew, that the
new party was well thought of at your court. I went to my closet
for your ostensible letter, which I read to him all from the beginning,
without giving him a copy of it. This made an impression, and I doubt
not, but Mr. St. John was regaled that very evening, with what he had
<PB N="201" REF="216"/>
retained of it. This is the substance of our conversation. Perhaps
Monsieur de Hervart informed you of all this in the letter which he
wrote you. He told me, that he had likewise seen your cousin. They
do not choose to disoblige you, as you see. He assured me, that my
lord Rivers was very well satisfied with you; and what is more, for your
court, although the public concludes the contrary, from his returning
without a present. The baron de Bothmar is expected every day. I wish
he was already arrived. I foresee, that both sides will pay court to

<P>THE honour which you was pleased to do me by your letter of the
23d of the last month, deserved to have an answer made to it by the
first opportunity. This is a duty in which I would not have failed, if
I had not been so oppressed with business these two weeks, that it was
impossible for me to perform it.</P>
<P>I beg of you, Sir, to believe, that I embrace, with all imaginable
pleasure, the offer which you make me of a correspondence, that must
be very agreeable to me, and perhaps useful to the two courts which we
have the honour of serving.</P>
<P>The baron de Bothmar is expected here shortly, as I have sent, some
time ago, the Queen's orders to the commissaries of the admiralty, to
send over a yatch for him to Holland. He may assure himself, that I
shall not fail to render him my services in all things. This is the least
mark I can give of the respect which I always bore, and which I shall
never lose for the court, of which he is the minister. Her Majesty will
name shortly, the minister whom she is to send to his Electoral Highâˆ£ness.
I hope that you will be pleased with him, and I doubt not, but
you will grant him your protection.</P>
<P>You will always do me a particular favour, when you give me your
orders. This is a truth, of which I beg you to be persuaded;
and, at the same time, that it is impossible to be more sincerely than I
am, with great respect, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"MY lord Halifax and my lord Sunderland beg of you, Sir, to exâˆ£plain
to your court, that the Whigs are, by no means, for a
republic, nor for rendering the crown elective, as they consider it hereâˆ£ditary
in the protestant line, and belonging to the nearest in that line.
<PB N="203" REF="218"/>
But it is not possible for the Whigs to abandon the Revolution. They
advanced the late King to the throne, and they are obliged to defend
his title. Now, they advanced him then in preference to the Queen who
now reigns, although she was nearer, and a protestant. As this could
not be done but by the authority of the parliament, it is natural for the
Whigs to defend that authority, and the parliamentary right to the
crown; for otherwise, they would declare themselves traitors and rebels.
And as the establishment of the Hannoverian succession is a consequence
of the Revolution, and a work of the late King, your court should take it
well of the Whigs, that they defend the Revolution, and should excuse some
expressions in their last writings, which appear to carry too far the auâˆ£thority
of the parliament in the affair of the succession; and the more so,
that the maxims of the Tories tending directly to prepare the way for the
prince of Wales, and to secure his title from being called in question;
it is natural for the friends of the Hannoverian succession, to maintain a
contrary doctrine. The baron de Bothmar is expected impatiently, in
order that they may explain themselves to him more fully upon this
subject."</P>

<P>"I Received while I was at Gohre, (from whence our court returned
three days ago) the obliging letter with which you was pleased to
honour me. His Electoral Highness, who read it, has very expressly
commanded me to thank you, from him, for the protestations which it
contains of your zeal for the interests of his family; and to assure you,
<PB N="205" REF="220"/>
that he is very sensible of this, and has a very great esteem and regard
for you, knowing your capacity, which renders you so deserving of the
choice and confidence of the Queen.</P>
<P>His Electoral Highness approves much of my having the honour of
writing to you, when Mr. Bothmar shall be absent from London, and
business worthy of your attention shall offer. But during the residence
of that minister, at her Majesty's court, you will allow, no doubt, that
since he has the entire confidence of his Electoral Highness, and is perâˆ£fectly
well acquainted with his intentions, my correspondence would be
very useless; and would but only weary you by the repetition of things,
which Mr. Bothmar will not fail to represent to you verbally, much betâˆ£ter
than I can write them. I said so to my lord Rivers, and I must add
now, that they hope here, you will be pleased to give Mr. Bothmar
some share of your confidence; and will judge him deserving of this
when you know him; having great experience in business, with a great
deal of discretion, and impartiality, and known probity. I am not
afraid of flattering him, in allowing him these qualities.</P>
<P>As to the rest, I am very much surprised, Sir, that you should
demand my protection, for the minister whom her Majesty shall send
here. I am not upon such a footing at this court, as to be able to proâˆ£tect
any one; and the ministers of so great a Queen, have no need of
any other protection here, but their character. But with regard to the renâˆ£dering
my small services to him who shall come here, and the doing so
cheerfully, with all imaginable care and sincerity, I can venture to proâˆ£mise
this, and I shall perform it with pleasure, as I endeavoured to do,
to the late Mr. Cresset, to my lord Winchelsea, Mr. Poley, and Mr.
How.</P>
<P>I received likewise, with respect and gratitude, the polite things which
Mr. D'Hervart wrote to me, by your order. I desired him to testify this
to you, and I doubt not, but he has communicated to you the letter which
I wrote to him, entreating you to believe, that in all I can do, I shall
never feel any motive, but that of acquiring the honour of your esteem,
and of being considered by you as an honest man, a quality without

<P>"IF a prince there is so good and wise, as to be content to govern acâˆ£cording
to the constitution and laws of the land, he may employ
whoever he pleaseth in his service, without regarding the opinion of
<PB N="207" REF="222"/>
others; but with this reserve, that if they act ill, that he will leave them
always to be judged by the laws of the land, and such a declaration
would be the best means to suppress insolence and parties.</P>
<P>But now as to the high-church.</P>
<P>There are 9600 parishes in England, and consequently so many parsons;
but their number may be at least 2000 more, to supply cures and who
seek preferment.</P>
<P>Ten or fifteen of this number have made it their business to preach
that the church is in danger, though the church enjoys all the privileges
that the law does allow them; but the clergymen in England would have
the same power over the people, that the church of Rome had in the
time of its dominion over us.</P>
<P>The Queen and parliament have now declared, that they will maintain
the church as established by law; so that they will not gain any thing by
their noise, only this ministry have blown them up to recommend them
and their party, to govern the helm, which point they have gained, and
the poor ambitious priests will be left in the lurch.</P>
<P>The priests handle edged tools, which any prince may cut them with,
when he pleases; for the laws are so severe against their encroachments,
that they are in danger of treason or premunire upon the least fault; and
the civil government hath been so jealous of their impertinence, that the
convocation of the clergy, cannot do any thing but by commission from
the King or Queen, and they cannot debate upon or resolve any point,
but such as are permitted in their commission; and which resolved, they
are not valid, unless the Queen approves them.</P>
<P>So that you see our church is limited by law. I think it good, in its
constitution and doctrine; but shall never encourage or consent to the
pride, ambition, and dominion of <HI>prists,</HI> which hath occasioned so much
blood-shed in the world in all ages.</P>
<P>Sir, I ask your pardon for writing you so long a letter, but my thought
suggested it to me, with a respect and good intention towards you. If
any of them may be thought by you serviceable to his Electoral Highâˆ£ness,
you may communicate them. I am, &amp;c."</P>

They were no strangers to Harley's attachment to the protestant succession:
but they supposed, that he would sacrifice his principles to his prudence;
especially, as his political enemies had obtained the confidence of the faâˆ£mily
of Hannover. The adherents of the court of St. Germains, judgâˆ£ing
superficially of things, built much on the supposed attachment of
Queen Anne to her brother, and the violent principles of the Tories, in
favour of the hereditary succession of the crown. They were too weak
or too ignorant to perceive, that the timidity of the Queen was little calâˆ£culated
to favour their cause, and that the professions of the Tories conâˆ£sisted
merely of empty clamour and noise. In this state of deception,
they renewed, or rather continued, with encreasing vehemence, their corâˆ£respondence
with Great Britain; and the intelligence which they sent and
received throws a new and important light on the history of the present

<P>"SINCE the Revolution, there has not been so great a confusion of
counsels and of measures in England, as there has been since the last
change in the ministry; and the affair of Greenshields, a minister of the
church of England, whom the parliament has lately protected against
<PB N="211" REF="226"/>
the presbyterians of Scotland, has irritated the latter to such a degree,
that they would concur in whatever might deliver them from the Union
with England, which is universally detested in Scotland; where they are
all persuaded, that nothing can deliver them from it, but the return of
their sovereign.</P>
<P>There is, at present, a concurrence of circumstances, more favourable
for an enterprise than there has been since his Majesty came out of Engâˆ£land.
But all this will change in time; and for the future, they will atâˆ£tend
only to the means of supporting, as easily as they can, the chains,
from which they see no further hopes of being delivered.</P>
<P>There is not a man in Great Britain, who is not convinced, that, if
the King of England had landed the last time in Scotland, he would have
infallibly succeeded; and the conjuncture appears, at present, still more
favourable than it was then. The inclination of the Scots towards their
King appears visible, in their sending, as members to parliament, the
same men who had been brought prisoners to London on account of the
invasion; and I can assure, that these men have not changed their sentiâˆ£ments.
The presbyterians in Scotland opposed the elections as much as
they could, and their ministers preached against them; but in vain; for
these members were chosen in spite of them, by a great majority of
voices.</P>
<P>At the time of the last expedition to Scotland, men ran in crowds,
and with so great eagerness, to withdraw their stock out of the Bank, that
the commons were obliged to pass a law declaring all those to be enemies
to the government and to the nation, who should demand their money
from the Bank, at that time; but, instead of curing the evil thereby,
they increased the discontent; every one exclaiming, that it was cruel to
treat, as enemies to the state, those who called for their money when they
had occasion for it; and, if news had not come, that the King of Engâˆ£land
had returned to France with the fleet, in twelve hours later the Bank
would have been shut up. This is well known to all those who were
then in London, and is known throughout all England, insomuch, that,
since that time, the credit of the Bank is greatly diminished. Not long
ago, the news of the failing of 13 or 14 privateers from Dunkirk gave
the alarm in England, that the Pretender was coming; upon which, seâˆ£verals,
<PB N="212" REF="227"/>
with some of whom I am acquainted, ran immediately to the Bank
to demand their money; and there is no doubt, but the same thing will
happen universally, whenever there is a real invasion. All the funds
will fail: no tax will be paid, but what is raised by force: no one will
choo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>e to advance money upon the security of the funds; and without it,
it will be impossible to make new preparations for opposing the invasion.</P>
<P>If the Bank of England fails, I believe there is no doubt, that the
Confederates will not be able to support the war, and then his most
Christian Majesty will have a safe game to play, without running any
risk. Troops are daily draughted, to be sent out of the kingdom; so
that few will be left to make opposition, and there are severals in the
army who have discovered their dispositions of returning to their duty
towards their King, if they found the opportunity.</P>
<P>They are preparing fleets to be sent to the Mediterranean and elseâˆ£where;
so that the few ships, which will remain to guard the channel,
cannot hinder the passage from Brest to Kirkcudbright; especially, if an
alarm is given from Dunkirk and other ports. All the fleet of England
can never hinder a squadron to pass from Brest to Ireland; and Scotland
is only a little more distant in the same line.</P>
<P>Severals in England wish the King well, who would not hazard their
estates for him; but these very people would not willingly hazard any
thing against him, if they saw the smallest risk on the side of the goâˆ£vernment.
It seems, therefore, that the greatest number want only an
opportunity of declaring themselves; that is to say, the return of his
Britannic Majesty, with a force sufficient to protect those who would
choose to join him on his arrival. If he came with 10,000 men, it is
thought there would not be a sword drawn against him.; but if he canâˆ£not
have that number, 5000 men would render the success probable,
but not so certain.</P>
<P>It is generally thought, that the princess of Denmark is favourably
inclined towards the King her brother; and that she would choose raâˆ£ther
to have him for her successor, than the prince of Hannover. But
she is timid, and does not know to whom she can give her confidence.
The duke of Leeds told me, that he had endeavoured to sound her as
much as he could, upon this subject, and he is in her confidence, and has
free access to her; but though she never chose to explain herself upon
<PB N="213" REF="228"/>
this point, she says nothing against him. It is thought, that if the King
of England was in Scotland, a treaty with him would be immediately
proposed, and then the members of parliament would be at liberty to
declare their sentiments; whereas, they are now restrained by an act
of parliament, which declares all those guilty of high treason, who shall
oppose the Hannoverian succession, by word or by writing. But the
King of England being in Scotland, and all the kingdom acknowledgâˆ£ing
him, which could not fail to happen soon after his arrival in that
country, then the present nccessity, and the common good of the nation,
would authorise the liberty, which each might take, of proposing whatâˆ£ever
could prevent the fatal effects of a civil war. I am well assured,
that some members of parliament would speak boldly in that case; and
I have also reason to believe, that there are several others, who only want
a similar conjuncture for declaring themselves, and who would do it corâˆ£dially:
and there is scarcely any doubt, but the greatest number would
be for a treaty. Those who would oppose it, would not render themselves
popular, and might be considered as the enemies of the peace and settleâˆ£ment
of the nation; and the very rumour of the treaty, would make the
people consider the King as already in possession, and as the rising sun.
I believe there is no example in our history, that the lawful heir has been
admitted to a treaty, when his right was not acknowledged; as in the
case of Stephen and Henry II.; of Richard duke of York, and of Henry
VI. &amp;c.: and the princess of Denmark having no children, would renâˆ£der
the affair still more easy, both with regard to herself and with regard
to the people.</P>
<P>The Arch-duke had none of these motives to encourage his enterprise,
and was not assured of having one miquilite for him, when he undertook
to make that diversion in Spain, which has continued for so many years,
and is not yet finished. The diversion of the malecontents in Hungary
has been of considerable advantage to France; and it was by marching
into Saxony, that the King of Sweden obliged King Augustus to submit.</P>
<P>The smallest advantage which an expedition of the King of England
into Scotland could produce, would be a civil war; which might be
supported from time to time by France, even though none of his Maâˆ£jesty's
subjects should join him: but that is not to be supposed: for in the
divisions of parties, there are now malecontents enough in Great Britain,
<PB N="214" REF="229"/>
who would rejoice at that opportunity of joining him, besides so many
others in distressed circumstances, or on bad terms with the government,
whom fear, resentment, or hope would influence; and there are men of
that character, in every country, but no where so many as there are at
present in Great Britain. But it is certain that the greatest number of the
Scots are disposed to join their King from inclination, and from a
principle of loyalty. This is evident, from all that they have suffered,
with so much constancy, for above two and twenty years; and that there
is a considerable number of them, appears from the apprehensions the
government entertain of them, and the measures they take to apprehend
the leaders on every alarm. But there are, besides, a set of men, wellâˆ£disposed,
who have taken the oaths to the government only by form,
and from interest, and whom general Stanhope, in Sacheverel's trial,
calls the nonjuror-swearers. These are very numerous in the two kingâˆ£doms.
There is not a high-church man in England that is not suspected
by the government. This is the case with all those who have presented
addresses for maintaining hereditary right and the maxim of the church
of England, that a prince is never to be resisted; and these comprehend
almost the whole nation, excepting such as are Whigs or Presbyterians
by profession; who, however, are become the contempt and aversion of
the people.</P>
<P>Malicious and injurious expressions against the King are no longer used,
even by the Whigs, who dare not now express themselves as they did
formerly. They acknowledged his birth in Sacheverel's trial, in order
to destroy hereditary right by that means, and to convince the princess
of Denmark, that she has no other title to the crown, but the settlement
which has been made for the succession since the Revolution; and the geâˆ£nerality
speak with esteem and respect of the King's person.</P>
<P>I do not intend to conceal any thing. The only objection against the
King is his religion; but that is not imputed to him as a fault, but as
his misfortune and ours; and the people would endure him much more
willingly, if they did not believe him a bigot to his religion; and this
is the idea his enemies endeavour to give of him as much as they can.</P>
<P>To obviate this objection, the following means are judged useful, by
his Majesty's friends, who persuade themselves that he will be ready to
do, on his part, all that is lawful for him, to bring about his restoration;
<PB N="215" REF="230"/>
and God forbid that more should be demanded of him, to gain even all
the kingdoms of the earth.</P>
<P>1st, The King of England, therefore, must not, either by word or by
insinuation, give any reason to believe that he is capable of dissembling
his religion. Every one would have a worse opinion of him, on that
account, and less credit would be given to all that he could say.</P>
<P>But, to remove the objection of bigotry and blind zeal, it is proâˆ£posed
he should acquaint his subjects, that when it shall please God to
restore him to his kingdoms, and to give him a proper opportunity, he
will not refuse to hear whatever can be said to him, with respect and subâˆ£mission,
in favour of the religion of his dominions. But whatever may
be the issue of this, with regard to his Majesty's religion, that will not
diminish our loyalty and our entire submission to him as our lawful soâˆ£vereign.</P>
<P>It is not understood by this, that there is to be a public dispute, which
is a sort of combat of gladiators for victory, and which ends generally
in increasing the differences, and exasperating the animosities, upon both
sides; the pride of man having a natural aversion to appear to be conâˆ£vinced:
accordingly when reasons fail, pride summons all the passions
to its aid, and then the combat is carried on with bitterness, and with perâˆ£sonal
reflections, which produce a hatred that excludes all means of reâˆ£conciliation.</P>
<P>No, this is not pretended; it is proposed only, that his Britannic Maâˆ£jesty
should not refuse to hear a reasonable man, who will explain to him,
with all the deference and respect that is due to him, the principles of
the church of England; and that, afterwards, he should determine as
God and his conscience will dictate to him; but, at the same time, he
should preserve to the church of England all legal securities for its estaâˆ£blishment
and support.</P>
<P>2dly, It is proposed, in order to remove all suspicion and prejudice
against his Majesty, that, when he comes over, he should bring no more
priests along with him than he has occasion for. It is the interest of the
King of England, especially on his arrival, to give the people advanâˆ£tageous
impressions of him; afterwards things will be more easy. When
he is on the throne, and the people find that their religion, their liberty,
<PB N="216" REF="231"/>
and their fortunes arc safe, he may then have as many priests with him
as he pleases, without being found fault with. So that it is only proâˆ£posed
to deprive himself of some of them for a little time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn through the last paragraph in the copy; probably to prevent givâˆ£ing offence to the bigotry of Lewis XIV. for whose perusal the translation of the memorial was intended.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3dly, If his most Christian Majesty would only connive at allowing
the Protestant domestics of the King of England to assemble themselves,
from time to time, at St. Germains, in order to worship God in the most
secret manner that possibly could be, that would do more service than
10,000 men. For, in England, that would appear as a sort of toleration,
with regard to his attendants; and, being obtained by his Britanni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/> Maâˆ£jesty,
every one would consider it as a mark of his inclination to favour
his protestant subjects, and as a pledge of what they might expect from
him, when he was restored to his throne. Besides that, it would entirely
remove the objection of bigotry. If it could be said in England, that
the King has procured for the protestant servants who attend him, the
liberty which is here proposed for them, that would be half the way to
his restoration. I only repeat here the very words which I have heard
from sensible men in London.</P>
<P>4thly, When the King of England comes, it will be proper to have in
his company some minister of the church of England, who is of an
approved character, in order to preach to the people, as soon as he lands,
without trusting to chance, and employing the first whom he finds on the
place, and who may be either disaffected or incapable.</P>
<P>5thly, It is necessary to bring along with him all the Irish troops,
who will be very agreeable to the Highlanders, because they speak the
same language; but, above all, to bring the duke of Berwick along with
him; for he is feared and loved, and his presence will prevent all the
disputes which may arise among the nobility of Scotland for the comâˆ£mand
of the army; for they will all submit to him, and they all desire
that he may come.</P>
<P>Time presses and appears short; for, according to all appearances,
the next winter will produce a peace, and then the King of England
must be reduced to begin every thing a-new for bringing about his reâˆ£storation,
and to seek new and uncertain measures to accomplish it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="232"/>
If the princess of Denmark, who is very infirm, dies, and if the
prince of Hannover is once in possession, he will bring along with him
his German troops, who, in virtue of the last act of parliament, will be
naturalized the moment they arrive; and he will humble and ruin all the
King of England's friends, and render, by these means, his cause desperate."</P>
<P>[The pen is drawn through what follows.]</P>
<P>"If his most Christian Majesty is not in a condition now to furnish
troops and other succours necessary to the King of England, for an exâˆ£pedition
into Scotland, may not some proposals be made to the King of
Sweden? Will not that prince be very well pleased to have such an ally
to assist him to obtain satisfaction from the King of Denmark, and to
defend his coasts against the Muscovites? And, in case of a double
marriage, which might be proposed to him, he would have a chance of
succeeding to the crown of England, as the King of England would have
to that of Sweden. Their religion cannot be objected against the Swedes,
for the prince of Hannover is a Lutheran.</P>
<P>If his most Christian Majesty chooses rather to land 5 or 10,000 men, to
the assistance of the King of Sweden, than to risk his troops and his ships
on an expedition to Scotland, the King of Sweden might send an equal
number of troops to Scotland much more easily, because the passage is
much shorter; and considering that that prince is engaged in sitting out
considerable armaments, both by sea and by land, against the Danes,
and against the Muscovites, the real designs of his preparations will never
be suspected. He may be the more easily reconciled to this, that the
government of England is not very favourably disposed towards him, of
which his Swedish Majesty appears, by his last declaration, to be very
sensible; declaring war against them, in some measure, and considering
them as the aggressors, because they engaged to maintain a neutrality in
the north of Germany: and nothing appears more natural, and more conâˆ£form
to the genius of that prince, than to enter into an alliance with the
King of England, who may write to him, by the means of the Swedish
resident, who is here, until he can send a minister to treat with him
Besides, that prince is guarantee of the peace of Riswick, and has a right
to interest himself in the present war; and, by an alliance with the King
of England, he might once more have the balance of Europe in his hands,
<PB N="218" REF="233"/>
and give a general peace upon reasonable terms; and these two princes
thus allied, would be in a condition to maintain the peace against all
those who would incline to disturb it, and to prevent any rebellion that
might arise in their respective dominions."</P>

<P>The dismission of the Whig ministry, last year, was followed by a disâˆ£solution
of the parliament. Doctor Sacheverel's trial, and his pompous
procession to the country, when he went to his living in North Wales,
inflamed the passions of the people, and influenced the elections in faâˆ£vour
of the Tories. The expectations from a Tory ministry, and the

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. fol. No. 36.</NOTE>A letter to a friend; with a state of affairs in England. 1711.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A copy in Nairne's hand; with corrections interlined, in lord Middleton's.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Violence of both Whigs and Tories.â€”The Whigs are attached to the family of
Hannover.â€”To prevent a civil war, the King should come over, and the
laws settling the succession be repealed.â€”The Pretender recommended to his
friends to support the measures of the court and the present ministry.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"SINCE you desire my opinion upon the present state of affairs of our
country, and that you assure me I may, with all safety, conside
my private thoughts to you, I shall tell you here very plainly what I think
most adviseable in the present conjuncture.</P>
<P>I need not go about to prove, that the house of Hannover and the
States of Holland are united with the Whigs and discontented party of
England; against the Queen, her present ministry, and the church of
England.</P>
<P>Their late proceedings have sufficiently shewn their inclinations that
way; and nothing is more obvious, than that the church and court party
can expect no quarter from these three united powers, if ever they come
to have the superiority. They think they have been very ill used, and
after resenting their pretended injuries so publickly as they have done,
<PB N="219" REF="234"/>
it is not to be expected they will ever hardly pardon. 'Tis pretty plain
they are in a sort of confederacy together, and that they are resolved to
stand and fall by one another. The duke of Hannover has, in conâˆ£junction
with the States, declared himself so openly for the Whig party,
in opposition to the Queen herself, as well as her ministry, that it is
visible he is inseparably united to that party, and will always be influâˆ£enced
by it; and that if ever he comes to have the power in his hands,
the church and present ministry must fall a sacrifice to the Whigs' reâˆ£venge;
the breach being too wide to expect they can ever be thoroughly
reconciled.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, therefore, that as matters stand now, there remains
only one expedient that can possibly secure, at once, both the church and
state against any attempt that may be made to their prejudice, either
during the Queen's life, or after her death, by a powerful, absolute
prince, supported by a jealous, interested nation abroad, and animated
by an exasperated, factious party at home; and that is to call home the
Queen's brother, whose just right gains ground daily in the hearts of his
subjects: in order to which, I think it not only advisable, but absolutely
necessary, to send to treat with him without loss of time; for all depends
upon taking timely measures, it being of the last importance to the
court and country interest, as well as his, to be before-hand with their
common adversaries. Accidents may happen; we are all mortal; and
if things be not prepared and secured before a vacancy, it will be very
hard, after that, to avoid a civil war: for we all know, that, according
to the laws now in being, Hannover, in that case, must of course be
proclaimed King. It will be too late then to repeal those laws which
make it high treason to oppose him; and it is not to be doubted but he
will quickly come over here, and bring with him (if it be necessary)
all the force the Hollanders and he can draw together. On the other
hand, it is certain the King will not be wanting, on his side, to transport
himself, at any rate, into some part of his dominions, to join with
his friends, in order to assert his right, and venture all, rather than have
the shame and grief to see a foreign Uâ€”r take peaceable possession of
his lawful inheritance. This must unavoidably produce a civil war,
which is, perhaps, what the Hollanders wish for; the fatal consequences
of which may last and extend, nobody knows how far.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="235"/>
The only remedy I see to prevent these misfortunes, and save our naâˆ£tion
from ruin and bloodshed, is the proposal above mentioned, of sendâˆ£ing,
immediately upon the conclusion of the peace, to treat with her
Majesty's brother, the King, and call him home privately upon the first
recess of parliament.</P>
<P>This is absolutely the quickest, safest, and easiest way; for all other
flow, dilatory methods of preparing things by degrees, managing the
opposite party, waiting for new favourable opportunities, and keeping,
in the mean time, this prince at a distance, are exposed to too many
dangers and difficulties, besides that unanswerable one of a sudden morâˆ£tality,
which, as it may very possibly happen, to our great grief and
misfortune, when we expect it least, so it is the height of imprudence
not to prepare against it.</P>
<P>It would require a great deal of more time, than we can in pruâˆ£dence
promise to ourselves, to go about to repeal the act of the settleâˆ£ment
of the crown, in a parliamentary way, before he be called over;
so I think that tedious method nowise advisable. Besides that, the
undertaking itself might meet with such opposition, in his absence, as
would expose it to the danger of a miscarriage; whereas, he being once
upon the place invited thither, and countenanced by her Majesty (which,
is no hard matter to contrive, so as to make it very practicable in the
recess of parliament, without the least danger of disturbance) those very
persons, who would have opposed him in parliament, and every where
else in his absence, will be the first to come and kiss his hand when
he is here, and comply with whatever the Queen shall think fit to do
in his favour.</P>
<P>It is so visibly the Queen's and the present ministry's true interest to
call her only brother home, in this conjuncture, that he and they may
be a mutual support and security to one another, that I am morally asâˆ£sured
he will not make the least difficulty to trust himself entirely into
their hands, whenever they please to call him; and that he will be wilâˆ£ling
even to come over with a page only to accompany him, upon the
Queen his sister's letter, if it be thought fit and necessary for his and
their common interest so to do: and when he is once here, I am sure
nobody will dare to find fault with the Queen's receiving him kindly.
She may safely present him to her council, own him there for her broâˆ£ther,
<PB N="221" REF="236"/>
and declare her good intentions towards him, and what she has
thought fit, with the advice of her ministers, to treat and concert with
him, for the future good and peace of her kingdoms. After which step
it will be infinitely more easy and less hazardous by any other method
whatsoever, to get the present settlement of the succession altered, in the
next meeting of the parliament, and every thing regulated there to their
mutual satisfaction; and all the rights and privileges of church and state,
crown, parliament, and people settled again upon the solid foundation of
the ancient laws and constitution of the kingdom.</P>
<P>But to assure the success of this great work, I think it absolutely best,
when he is invited over, that he be allowed to come straight to London,
where his sudden and unexpected appearance will surprise and confound
all his unprepared enemies, break all their measures, and make every
thing go so quick and easy on the Queen's side and his, that they will
soon, by the wise conduct of the present ministry, put it out of the
power of either Hannover or the discontented Whigs to disturb the new
settlement that shall be agreed upon, between the brother and his now
only sister. But, in case things be not thought ripe enough, or suffiâˆ£ciently
disposed to bring him straight to London, the next best will be
to bring him to Scotland; which would be better by far, than sending
him a travelling into foreign countries. Only one thing is to be obâˆ£served,
as to Scotland, that the government of the church there being
Presbyterian, and the generality of that nation being discontented with
the Union, which we in England think our interest to maintain, he may,
perhaps, have some hard proposals made to him upon that head, by a
prevalent party in that kingdom, which will make him very uneasy, by
putting a disagreeable necessity upon him of refusing what he cannot
grant to them, without disobliging the English, which I have good
reason to be believe he is resolved not to do; it being contrary to his inâˆ£clination,
as well as his interest, to do any thing in favour of one nation,
that may be a just ground of grievance to another; his intention, as I
am credibly informed, being to leave all those matters of state, as well
as of religion, to be entirely decided and settled in a British parliament.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have (in compliance to your desire) opened my mind
freely to you upon a very nice point. I hope, from your friendship for
me, and your known discretion in matters of this importance, that you
<PB N="222" REF="237"/>
will not communicate this paper, but where you are sure it will be safe,
and where you have reason to hope it may be of some use. I shall conâˆ£clude
with assuring you, that you are the only person to whom it is sent,
and that neither the person by whose conveyance it comes, nor any other
person whatever on your side, knows any thing of the contents of it.
Any thing that tends towards Jacobitism (as I own this letter does) sounds
ill in the ears of those who are always used to tack popery, slavery, and
arbitrary government together; and have no other notion of a popish
King, but that of a bigot tyrant. But I, who know from unquestionâˆ£able
hands, that the Pretender (as we call him here) besides his other
great and good qualities, is too wise and too just a prince to think of perâˆ£secuting
any body for his religion; that, on the contrary, all those of
our church, that are about him at present, have distinguished marks of
his bounty shewn to them, with assurances that it shall not be his fault
if they have not the full exercise of their religion whenever they go with
him. I, who know also, that he has sent particular directions to his
friends here, to join themselves unanimously to vote for and support the
measures of the court and present ministry, with all the interest they
have, am not only fully persuaded of his true affection for his sister, and
love for his country, but am also convinced, in my conscience, that our
established religion, as well as our liberties, estates, and employments,
and every thing else that is dear to us, will be infinitely more secure unâˆ£der
his government, than under a Lutheran foreign prince, influenced
by German and Whig counsels: and, therefore, to you I am not afraid
nor ashamed to own myself, so far a Jacobite as to wish a good underâˆ£standing
between our gracious Queen and her brother, which I look upon
to be the only means to make her Majesty happy, easy, and safe, as long
as she lives, our present ministry out of danger of being ever oppressed
by their enemies, our church safe, and our country happy. To be a
Jacobite, at this rate, in my opinion, is to be a true patriot and a faithful
subject; and I hope you do me the justice to have no other opinion of,
Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"THE violence and ambition of the enemies of our family, and of

the obligations of nature and duty, ought to be more firmly united;
and have hindered us from the proper means and endeavours of a

most happy effects to ourselves, to our family, and to our bleeding
country.</P>
<P>But whatever the success may be, I have resolved now to break
through all reserve, and to be the first in an endeavour so just and necesâˆ£sary.
The natural affection I bear you, and that the King our father
had for you, till his last breath; the consideration of our mutual inâˆ£terest,
honour, and safety, and the duty I owe to God and my country,
are the true motives that persuade me to write to you, and to do all
that is possible for me to come to a perfect union with you.</P>
<P>And you may be assured, Madam, that though I can never abandon,
but with my life, my own just right, which you know is unalterably
settled by the most fundamental laws of the land; yet I am most deâˆ£sirous
rather to owe to you, than to any living, the recovery of it. It
is for yourself that a work so just and glorious is reserved. The voice
of God and nature calls you to it; the promises you made to the King
our father enjoin it; the preservation of our family, the preventing of
unnatural wars require it; and the public good and welfare of our
country recommend it to you, to rescue it from present and future evils;
which must, to the latest posterity, involve the nation in blood and conâˆ£fusion,
till the succession be again settled in the right line.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="239"/>
I am satisfied,<MILESTONE N="May." UNIT="month"/> Madam, that, if you will be guided by your own incliâˆ£nations,
you will readily comply with so just and fair a proposal as to preâˆ£fer
your own brother, the last male of our name, to the dutchess of Hanâˆ£nover,
the remotest relation we have, whose friendship you have no
reason to rely on, or be fond of, who will leave the government to foâˆ£reigners
of another language, of another interest, and who, by the geâˆ£neral
naturalization, may bring over crowds of his countrymen to supply
the defect of his right, and enslave the nation.</P>
<P>In the meantime, I assure you, Madam, and am ready to give all the
security that can be desired, that it is my unalterable resolution to make
the law of the land the rule of my government, to preserve every man's
right, liberty, and property, equally with the rights of the crown; and
to secure and maintain those of the church of England, in all their just
rights and privileges, as by law established; and to grant such a toleraâˆ£tion
to dissenters as the parliament shall think fit.</P>
<P>Your own good nature, Madam, and your natural affection to a broâˆ£ther,
from whom you never received any injury, cannot but incline your
heart to do him justice; and, as it is in your power, I cannot doubt of
your good inclinations. And I do here assure you, that, in that case,
no reasonable terms of accommodation which you can desire for yourself,
shall be refused by me. But as affairs of this moment cannot be so well
transacted by letters, I must conjure you to send one over to me, fully
instructed and empowered by you, or to give security for such a one from
me; for by that way only, things can be adjusted to our mutual satisâˆ£faction,
which shall be managed on our side with the utmost secrecy.</P>
<P>I have made this first step towards our mutual happiness, with a true
brotherly affection, with the plainness and sincerity that becomes both
our rank and relation, and in the most prudent manner I could at preâˆ£sent
contrive; and will be directed by you in the prosecution of it, relyâˆ£ing
entirely on your knowledge and experience, as to the means and
instruments.</P>
<P>And now, Madam, as you tender your own honour and happiness,
the preservation and re-establishment of our ancient royal family, the
safety and welfare of a brave people, who are almost sinking under preâˆ£sent
weights, and have reason to fear greater; who have no reason to

complain of me, and whom I must still, and do love as my own. I conâˆ£jure
you to meet me in this friendly way of composing our difference,

both happy; yourself more glorious than all the other parts of your life,
and your memory dear to all posterity.</P>

<P>"IN answer to yours, I cannot, at this distance, and in my present
circumstances, enter into disputes of religion; but those of the
church of England have no reason to doubt of my favour and protection,
after the early assurances I gave them in my instructions, bearing date
the 3d March, 1702, which you have seen, and I am resolved to make
good. I know my grand-father and my father too had always a good
opinion of the principles of the church of England relating to monarchy;
and experience sufficiently sheweth, that the crown was never struck at
but she also felt the blow; and though some of her chief professors have
failed in their duty, we must not measure the principles of a church by
the actions of some particulars.</P>
<P>Plain dealing is best in all things, especially in matters of religion;
and, as I am resolved never to dissemble in religion, so I shall never
tempt others to do it; and as well as I am satisfied of the truth of my
own religion, yet I shall never look worse upon any persons, because in
this they chance to differ with me: nor shall I refuse, in due time and
place, to hear what they have to say upon this subject. But they must
not take it ill if I use the same liberty I allow to others, to adhere to the
religion which I, in my conscience, think the best; and I may reasonâˆ£ably
expect that liberty of conscience for myself, which I deny to none."</P>

<P>"I Have been away these two months since I writ my last to you, and
my journey home being much about the same time your lawyer
[Churchill] was in motion, made him a little concerned for fear he should
not have had an opportunity of speaking to me before he left these parts
for good and all: this he shewed in a more open manner than usual, for
he asked particularly after [of] me of [after] one that had gone from
our town to wait upon him, and commissioned him, at his return, to
inquire whether I was come back or no; and if so, to tell me he had a mind
to see me. But at this gentleman's return, I not being arrived, he neâˆ£glected
to send any more to our house, and I had like to have lost the
news of this intimation. As soon as I knew it, in the uncertainty I was
in to find Mr. James [Churchill], your lawyer, I writ to one of his houseâˆ£hold,
to know more in particular his desires, and where I might wait
upon him, who immediately answered me, as from his master, and fixed
me the place where he was to stay some days: whereupon, the time
pressing of both sides, I took post, and had two long conferences with
him about Mr. Bernard's [the Queen's] lawsuit, and Mr. Kelly's [the
King's] affairs. As to both which he shews a good-will, and gives, in
appearance, sincere wishes; but how far he will be able to work effecâˆ£tually
in the matter, I leave you to judge. First, as to Mr. Bernard's
[the Queen's] deed, he says, it must be insisted upon in time; for
he looks upon it certain that an accommodation [peace] will be
<PB N="229" REF="244"/>
made; <MILESTONE N="November." UNIT="month"/> and if he shall be found capable of helping on the signing this
deed, he assures Mr. Bernard [the Queen] of his best services. (But he
believes measures are taken in such a manner, that he shall be excluded
from having any hand in concluding matters at Povey [peace]: but
could not some one work to gain Mr. Mathew [Harley] and Nathaniel
[Masham]?) He looks upon the strongly insisting upon, and gaining
this point of the deed to be of great consequence, not only as to the
making my lady Betty [the Queen] easy as to her own circumstances,
but very much conducing to the advancing Mr. Athony's [the King's]
interest: and this not so much again as to the money itself, as that the
grant of it, (which cannot be refused, it being formerly concluded and
granted at Povey [peace], and funds being set aside for it, and only
diverted by "the unworthiness of him who then ruled the roast)" and
continual payment, will be a means to make people open their eyes,
even in regard to Mr. Andrew [the King], and see better their own inâˆ£terest
in reference to the same, "whose cause has got so much sensible
ground for these latter years, that, (to assure me more, I suppose, of
his real interior sentiments) he swore solemnly he thought it could not
fail of coming to a happy issue: nay, that both sides would see an absoâˆ£lute
necessity of having recourse to him, as the only means left of securâˆ£ing
solid peace and happiness: not so much, perchance, (either Mr.
Robert [High Church] or cousin. Simon [Whigs]) out of any true prinâˆ£ciples
of conscience or honesty, for he does not think either deserves the
name of Lumsdell [Loyal].</P>
<P>As to Mr. Antony's [the King's] business, it must be managed with
a great deal of dexterity. He was not a little startled at the news of his
going to Mr. Price [the Pope]; it would not have been well at all. He
says, when they begin to work at Povey [peace], perchance Mr. Edâˆ£ward
[King of France] and his Fredlingers [ministers], (who will be wilâˆ£ling
to consecrate any thing to their own ends) will be consenting to Mr.
Athony's [the King's] going to live some where with Mr. Price [the
Pope], or some where in that country, and he fancies that something of
that kind may be insisted upon by others in Evans [England]; by that
means to persuade the tenants that they are altogether for excluding the
Thomists [Catholics], and all for Gregory (Hannover]. "But he deâˆ£clares,
as much as he can judge of things, that Mr. Athony's [the King's]
<PB N="230" REF="245"/>
going thither must never be granted to." And this he looks upon as a
point of the last importance; for he declares, he thinks it absolutely
contrary to Mr. Athony's interest; and, therefore, though Mr. Edward
[King of France] should consent to it, and people in Evans [England]
push for it, it must not be done: and he desired me in particular to assure
you of this, (and he swore it by the living God) that he thought, that
if Mr. Benjamin [the Queen] ever consented to this, that 'twas no better
than ruining and quite murdering this son's, the Grot's [King's] cause.
If it be necessary, or judged advantageous to quit Forster [France], let
him go to his uncle David [Germany], or rather have recourse to some
free seat. But I asked him, what security for his person, there being
such a writ out against him? He answered, he really did not think he
wanted any security, for nobody would touch him. "As for his part,
he had seen such visible changes for the better of late, on all sides, that
he thought the gaining of his cause could not but follow." And when
he gets his estate, he hopes he will make his tenants easy; and not thinkâˆ£ing
of annulling any regulations, made for the cutting down woods, and
altering other farms, for these many years; for that will bring dangerous
consequences, the interest of so many persons being engaged, who otherâˆ£wise
would come in to him.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Betty's deed [the Queen's jointure] is insisted upon, if it
was to be put to Philip Cook [the parliament], you will find many, he is
persuaded, even willing to help it on, and glad of an occasion of making
their compliments <HI>Ã  bon grace,</HI> and giving some testimony of their goodâˆ£will.
If she thinks, that he shall be in any capacity of serving her in this
point, she needs only to signify to him what she expects from him, and
he will be very glad of the occasion of showing himself her humble
servant. He insinuated a desire you should be sensible, that what he has
done for these many years, (and seem to affirm the same of others) has
not been out of any spleen or ill-will against you, but only to put down
Foster [France], which he always judged the true interest of Mrs.
Edwards [England], whose cause alone he pleaded for. He thinks
certainly there will be an accommodation; for when he was, last winter,
at Mrs. Evans [England], he saw so much of the disposition of the peoâˆ£ple,
that if all were to be polled, nine in ten would absolutely vote
for Povey [peace], being spent, on all sides, by so long a law-suit.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="246"/>
A great many, he says, have taken strange methods, of late, which,
contrary to the intentions of those that made use of them, will prove very
much to the advantage of Mr. Andrew's [the King's] cause; and God,
who rules above, seems visibly to dispose all things for the best. Neither
your cousin Temple, [the Tories] nor Wilson [the Whigs] are much to
be relyed on, quatenus such; but all that they have or seem to be
a doing, will insensibly reduce both of them, more and more, to the neâˆ£cessity
of doing Mr. Athony's [the King's] business, and even calling for
him.</P>
<P>To signify these things to you, was the reason of his calling for me,
and he desired I would tike an occasion of waiting upon you for this inâˆ£tent;
but I hope the writing this will suffice; if not, you know where
to command. After my compliments to him, I told him, as to myself,
I was much more afraid of the issue of his suits, in this following seaâˆ£son,
than in the former. He owned, he had been treated unworthily,
upon several accounts: but that was nothing. For his part, God had
blessed him with a great deal of temper, and he had taken the resolution
of being quiet for the present; but he would expect his time; and if
Mr. Matthew [Harley] or others pushed things to greater extremities,
they should give him, perchance, only better hold, and they should find
what metal he was made of.</P>
<P>He desired, that his compliments might be made, in a particular
manner, to Mr. Barker [Berwick] and Mr. Wal. [E. Midd.] and bade
me tell the latter, that he hoped Mr. Wal. [E. Midd.] would live to see
better times, and more according to his satisfaction. He was pleased to
ask me many questions about Mr. Walter's [E. Midd.'s] conversion; and
said, he had heard, at the beginning, as if he had had a mind of retiring
from business, for good and all. As for his conversion, I told him,
it was beyond all doubt, truly solid, and certainly upon motives altoâˆ£gether
christian; and for the rumour of his having a mind to retire,
perchance, his retiring to our little seminary, at Onksi [Paris], might
give occasion of that rumour; but this was only to do his work he had
undertaken more efficaciously, and first cleanse the garden of so many
weeds that had overrun it, and secondly plant the same, with necessary
adornments. (I think he answered, it is what we must all come to; but
I did not understand him perfectly).</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247"/>
As for the working at Povey [peace], he thought they had taken all
their measures to do the business without him; and as for his part, he
desired nothing more than to be at quiet. Some business to settle matâˆ£ters
abroad, would detain him yet a little while, at Mr. Harrison's
[Holland]; but when that was done, he would hasten home, where he
would maintain himself against them all; and if Mr. Mathews [Harley]
or others pushed matters any farther against him, perchance so much
the better.</P>
<P>But, after he had used a great many compliments, &amp;c. towards you, I
thought it would not be amiss, civilly to urge him to something more
positive, and endeavour to see if there were any more solid assurances to
be had from him, above what one might call a compliment; and for the
purpose, I objected this to him, that some might say, he being a lawyer
of such interest, why would not he stickle more in Mr. Anthony [the
King] and Barnard's [the Queen's] suits? He answered, he did not
know what he could do directly in the matter; but only by managing
people so, on occasions, as to make them enter into the aforesaid interâˆ£ests;
and they might assure themselves, nothing should be wanting on
his side, as occasions should present. He owned, indeed, that he had
acted with a great deal of animosity against Foster [France], (and he
always thought it the interest of his country so to do) but not against
them; and really seemed to shew a great desire of all things prospering
with you, and said, that God Almighty had disposed things so, that he
solemnly swore again, that he thought Mr. Anthony's [the King's] buâˆ£siness
could not fail of going forward, and that his Rode [religion] would
not be any hinderance to it, for all the protestations Evans [England]
had made to the contrary. He says, he knows your cousin Harry
[princess of Denmark] perfectly well; that he is a very honest person,
but easily won and wrought upon; but, at the bottom, he certainly has
no aversion from his brother Alexander [the King]. But he [princess
Anne] is one that must not be frightened; and the lawyer [Churchill]
says, he thinks any extern force used, will rather do more harm than
good, both in regard of Harry [princess Anne] and others. Whereas,
if one will but let things go on their own train, Alexander [the King's]
business will go on of itself, and he does not doubt, but will come to
a happy conclusion.</P>

<P>A clandestine negociation had now been carried on, for five months,
between France and England. Mr. Prior went to France in the month
of July, and came back with Mr. Mesnager and the abbÃ© Gaultier, in

about the latter end of September; and notwithstanding the remonstrances
of the Emperor and of the States, and a spirited and vehement memoâˆ£rial
from the Elector of Hannover, it was determined to open a general
congress at Utrecht, in the beginning of the ensuing year. The court
of St. Germains seem to have had such confidence in the attachment of
Queen Anne and her ministry to their cause, that they were not so uneasy
now at the news of a general peace, as at the time of the treaty at Rysâˆ£wick.
The Dauphin paid them a visit, and congratulated them on
their prospect. They did not, however, neglect the measures which

concerning the succession to the crown of England.</HEAD>
<P>This Memorial, which is but a copy in Nairne's hand, begins with
setting forth the disadvantages of which a disputed title to the crown
had been formerly, and will always continue to be, to England, and then
proceeds as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>December, 1711.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"IT would be proper to show the English, that the monarchy and the
hierarchy, having such a close connexion, and so much dependence
the one upon the other; the one cannot possibly subsist without the other,
as might be easily shown, by arguments and examples. A King must enâˆ£tirely
neglect his own interests, when he does not protect and maintain
<PB N="235" REF="250"/>
the church of England,<MILESTONE N="December." UNIT="month"/> in all its rights and privileges; and, therefore,
as there is not a stronger tye than common interest, the members of that
church may be sure, that the King will never depart from the solemn
promises which he hath already made to them, and which he is ready to
confirm to them, that he will protect and maintain them, in the peaceâˆ£ful
possession of all their rights, privileges, and immunities, which have
been granted to them by acts of parliament and the common law of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>And, in order to remove all their uneasiness on the article of religion,
it may be shown to them, that, in the year 1702, the King having been
informed, by men of rank of the church of England, that, in order to
render their religion perfectly secure under a Catholic King, they wished
that his Majesty would grant them certain privileges, even beyond what
the acts of parliament and common law of the kingdom allow them;
his Majesty having examined their demands, granted them immediately,
although they could not deny themselves, but by granting them, he deâˆ£rogated
from the rights and prerogatives of the crown."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Then follows a copy of the declaration.</P>
<P><Q>"It appears plainly then, to any one who will reflect, that it is the inâˆ£terest
of the English nation to finish, as soon as possible, all disputes about
the succession of the crown, by re-establishing it in the right line; and
it appears likewise, that the catholic religion, which is the only thing
that can be objected to the King, is of no prejudice to them, but, on
the contrary, an advantage, as his Majesty yields to the church of Engâˆ£land,
what no Protestant King would yield to them; therefore, the
members of that church will find their account, and have their priâˆ£vileges
more enlarged, and their securities better established under the
King, being a catholic, than if he was a protestant."</Q></P>
<P>After proposing, in the very words of the <HI>Sieur Lamb,</HI> that is, doctor
Leslie, that the act of settlement should be repealed, that every one
might be at liberty to declare his sentiments, the Memorialist proceeds.</P>
<Q><P>"After the act, which exchanged the succession, shall be repealed,
it would be necessary to send over the King to England, that he might
learn what is necessary for him to know, in order to govern his people,
by instructing himself in the laws and customs of the country; and likeâˆ£wise,
<PB N="236" REF="251"/>
that he might be before-hand with the Dutch, who might otherâˆ£wise,
upon the first news of the death of the reigning princess, transport
thither the prince of Hannover, which would infallibly produce a civil
war, with which they would be very well pleased, because they would
find their account in it. Moreover, they know that the prince of Hanâˆ£nover,
who has not the best title on his side, will stand in need of a
foreign support to maintain him; and, as he cannot find it any where but
with them, they will by that dependence, reassume the direction of all
the affairs of England, as they did during the government of the prince
of Orange, which will nowise suit either the humours or the interests of
the English nation.</P>
<P>When the King would be transported to England, the best means of
securing to him the succession would be to treat him as a sovereign, in
which, it does not appear, there would be any inconveniency to the
reigning princess; who, for associating her brother to the royal title,
will not the less peaceably enjoy all her authority, during her own life;
as it has been seen lately, that the kingdom was governed peaceably, unâˆ£der
the names of William and Mary, although the first had all the adminiâˆ£stration;
and as it was seen formerly, that the same kingdom was goâˆ£verned
as peaceably, under the names of Philip and Mary, although the
last alone had the whole administration."</P></Q>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. fol. No. 34.</NOTE>A Memorial concerning the dowry of the Queen of England, and the indemâˆ£nity
of the King of England's subjects, given to the Marquis de Torcy,
in December, 1711.</HEAD>
<P>THIS memorial recites, that the late King had made a settlement of
50,000<HI>l.</HI> sterling upon the Queen, by letters patent under the
great seal, which was afterwards confirmed by acts of parliament which
have never been repealed; that according to the prerogatives of the Queens
of England, she had appointed her own officers and disposed of her
revenues, from the date of the settlement; that, therefore, she has an
undoubted right to what is due since she left England; and that, if she
could claim it, according to the usual forms, there is not a court of
justice in England, but what would decide it in her favour.</P>
<P>The memorial mentions, in the next place, that her pretensions were
sustained, by the English themselves, at the treaty of Ryswick, and reâˆ£cites
<PB N="237" REF="252"/>
the particulars, which may be seen in the preceding volume, among
the papers of that period.</P>
<P><Q>"A promise so solemn, reiterated, and confirmed, in a manner so
positive and so precise, and without any condition, should not have met
with any difficulty in the execution; and the more so, that the parliaâˆ£ment
of England made no difficulty of testifying, in a very effectual
manner, their approbation of that promise, by furnishing the prince with
the means of performing it: for, in the first session after the peace, the
commons assembled in parliament, granted him a new fund of a hundred
thousand pounds sterling of an additional revenue, of which they apâˆ£propriated
the half to supply the funds on which the appanage had been
assigned, and which had been otherwise employed; and to show further,
that it was their intention that the sum should be paid honestly to the
Queen, according to the promise publickly and positively made, in the
name of the nation, without exacting any condition from her Majesty,
they added a clause, by which it was declared, that those who should be
employed to remit the money to the Queen, in France, should not be
subject to the penalties of the law which forbade all correspondence
with the court of St. Germains. This evidently shows, that the preâˆ£tended
condition, which was afterwards alleged to elude the payment,
was ill-founded; and that the parliament never thought of exacting such
conditions."</Q></P>
<P>The memorial next proposes, that at the ensuing treaty of peace, the
sum of 50,000<HI>l.</HI> should be secured to the Queen for life; and that all
the arrears, due since the Revolution, at least since the treaty of Rysâˆ£wick,
should be paid. It specifies the manner in which this should be
done; particularly, that the Queen should be at liberty to nominate
any person she chose to receive her money, and to grant valid discharges
to the government of England, without her being obliged to sign any

<HEAD>HANNOVER PAPERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>1711.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1711" UNIT="year"/> TO explain the papers of the family of Hannover, in the present
year, a short detail of leading facts may be necessary. The baron
de Bothmar, envoy extraordinary from the Elector, arrived in London,
early this year. Though the duke of Marlborough was permitted to reâˆ£tain
the command of the army, the dutchess was deprived of all her
employments; and Harley, at the desire of the Queen, informed the
court of Hannover of her dismission. The Electoral Prince, who had
been elected a Knight of the Garter in 1706, was installed at Windsor in
December 1710; the lord Halifax serving as his proxy. The earl of
Rochester, the Queen's maternal uncle, who, from his rank, abilities,
experience in business, and influence with the high-church party, was the
only rival of Harley, died suddenly, in the May of the present year. A
fair field being left for Harley's ambition, he became lord-treasurer, earl
of Oxford and Mortimer, and was considered as prime minister.</P>
<P>Marlborough, endeavouring to overcome his enemies in the cabinet by
the splendour of his actions in the field, made various, but unsuccessful,
efforts to force the Mareschal de Villars to a battle. He, however, by a
sudden exertion, surprised the famous lines with which the French had
joined the Scheld, the Sansette, the Scarpe, and the Ugy. The conseâˆ£quence
of this enterprise was the siege and surrender of Bouchain, the
last exploit of the duke of Marlborough. Mr. Matthew Prior, having
been sent clandestinely by the ministry with preliminaries of peace to
France, arrived at Fountainbleau, in the month of July. Lewis the XIV.
afraid either to accept or refuse the terms offered by Prior, sent to Lonâˆ£don,
in his company, Mons. Menager and the famous AbbÃ© du Bois. An
intimate correspondence was established between the British and French
<PB N="239" REF="254"/>
ministers; and preliminary articles, to the satisfaction of both, were signed
on the twenty-seventh of September. The Queen sent the earl of Rivers
to Hannover, to assure the Elector, that the succession of his family to
the crown of Great Britain should be secured in the treaty. The earl of
Oxford and his associates made the same assurances, in vain; the jealousy
of his Electoral Highness having been raised by the emissaries of the
Whigs.</P>
<P>The lord Raby, who had been appointed, in the preceding March,
ambassador extraordinary to the States-general, was created earl of Strafâˆ£ford
in the beginning of September, and in the end of that month was
sent back to Holland, to press the opening of a general congress. The
privy-seal, upon the death of the duke of Newcastle, was delivered into
the custody of Dr. Robinson, bishop of Bristol, who was intended to be
joined as plenipotentiary to the earl of Strafford, on the expected conâˆ£gress.
Doctor Swift gives the character of both very justly, in a few
words. <Q REND="inline">"They were practiced in business, but possessed no parts.
Strafford hath some life and spirit; but is infinitely proud, and wholly
illiterate."</Q> His lordship's letters, indeed, furnish no proof of his learnâˆ£ing;
and Robinson was a heavy, though decent man.</P>
<P>An incident, in Scotland, employed the attention of the court of Hanâˆ£nover,
in the present year. The dutchess of Gordon, a Roman Catholic,
presuming on the temper of the times, sent a medal of the Pretender to
Mr. Robert Bennet, dean of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh.
This piece of silver had a legend upon it, importing that the kingdom
should be restored to the right owner. At a meeting of the Faculty,
thanks were voted to her Grace; and Mr. Robert Dundas of Arniston
returned them, in terms sufficiently seditious and bold. He thanked
her for presenting them with a medal of their sovereign lord the King.
He hoped, that her Grace would soon have an opportunity of presenting
to the faculty of Advocates a second medal, struck upon the restoration
of the King and royal family, and the finishing of rebellion, usurpation,
tyranny, and whiggery. No inquiry was made into this affair, till the
baron de Kreyenberg, in the name of his master, the Elector, complained
of the conduct of the advocates to the Queen. In compliance with his
representation, Sir David Dalrymple, the lord advocate, who was a
Whig, when it suited with his own interest, was dismissed from his ofâˆ£fice,
<PB N="240" REF="255"/>
for his being remiss in the prosecution of the delinquents.<MILESTONE N="January." UNIT="month"/> The
premising of these facts will explain the correspondence of this year.</P>

<P>"BEING ready to embark, your Electoral Highness will be pleased
to allow me to thank you, by this letter, for all the attention
you have condescended to shew me, and to assure you, that I am firmly
resolved to conform myself, in all respects, to the excellent advices your
Electoral Highness has been pleased to give me by Monsieur de Bulau.
Monsieur de Bothmar, who has been detained by contrary winds till
now, will be a witness of this, and will have the honour to send inforâˆ£mation,
from time to time, of what passes. I shall apply myself to proâˆ£mote
the Queen's interests with the same zeal and assiduity I always did,
in order that I may have nothing to reproach myself with, in case they
shall choose that I should not continue in the service, and I presume to
hope that your Electoral Highness will do me justice in that respect. I
must not however conceal from you that my correspondents write to me,
that those who have most credit at present, are resolved to embarrass me,
by depriving me of officers and others in whom I place the most confiâˆ£dence.
<PB N="241" REF="256"/>
You will be informed by your ministers here, that it has been
resolved to take all possible measures for being in the field early next
year. For this purpose all the troops must be complete on the 25th of
March, and magazines of forage will be formed on the frontiers. But the
principal subject of consideration was how to carry on the war in Spain
with the greatest vigour. Her Majesty, on her side, makes her utmost
efforts; she takes 2000 more of Imperial cavalry into her pay, and furâˆ£nishes
2500 recruits for the Imperial infantry, at the rate of 20 crowns
each; she is at the expence of transporting them all to Catalonia, besides
an equal number of recruits for the English infantry, and five battalions
of an augmentation: it is expected that these have failed already. This
is intended as an example to excite the court of Vienna and the States-general
to exert themselves likewise on their side. Prince Eugene, at parting,
gave reason to hope that the Emperor would send four battalions to Spain,
if the States would do as much. The province of Holland has taken a
favourable resolution in consequence of this; and it is hoped, the other
provinces will soon follow the example, especially as count Zinzendorff
has since declared his Imperial Majesty's consent to this augmentation.
These troops will be a powerful succour, if they arrive in time, and the
greatest care will be taken that they shall; but the bad news we have
lately received from that country will oblige both the one and the other
to take still more vigorous resolutions.</P>
<P>I entreat your Electoral Highness to continue to honour me with your
kindness, and to be persuaded of the inviolable and respectful attachment
with which I am, &amp;c."</P>

ravaged the enemy's country, will return to take up their winter-quarters
in Mecklenburg, and in other places in the circle of the Lower Saxony;
and that his Danish Majesty will choose to place troops in the country of
Bremen. It is easy to conceive, that, by that means, the slames of war
may extend themselves farther into the empire, to the great prejudice of

therefore, have a very particular obligation to you, if you employ your
influence to obtain permission from the Queen for some of the regiments
of cavalry and dragoons, which I have in her Majesty's pay, to come
back to my own dominions after the campaign, as the regiment of Haher
came back last winter, and upon the same footing. They may be abâˆ£sent
from the Low Countries, during the winter, without any prejudice to
the public; and it is precisely during that season that I shall have need of
them here. I do not foresce that any thing can hinder me from sending
them back to you at the opening of the next campaign: but by neâˆ£glecting

<P>"IT is with an entire considence, that I address myself to you, as a
minister who has both the clearest views and the best intentions, in
order to represent to you, that the advanced season does not permit the
princes who are consederated against Sweden to possess themselves of any
place of strength in Pomerania. It appears certain, that their troops, after
having committed some ravages, will return to take up their winter-quarâˆ£ters
in different places in the circle of the Lower Saxony, and particularly
in Mecklenburg; and that his Danish Majesty will choose to place some
troops in the country of Bremen. It is easy to conceive, that this may

be the means of carrying the war to this side of the Elbe, from whence
it may extend itself farther into the empire, to the great prejudice of
the allies. Besides, the situation of my dominions is such, that they canâˆ£not
be in safety if the war should communicate itself to the country of Bremen.</P>
<P>I shall employ all my attentions to divert the court of Denmark from
forming this project. But, my lord, you are too penetrating not to see,
that having but very few infantry, without any cavalry, in my domiâˆ£nions,
I cannot exert myself with efficacy for the security of this neighâˆ£bourhood
and of my own territories; and that it is very necessary, in
order to give weight to the negociations which I design to set on foot
with the enemies of Sweden, and to the proposals which I may make to
them, that I should have some cavalry and dragoons here next winter.
As the design I have in view is the common interest of all the allies, and
as I shall act in perfect concert with the Queen, I hope her Majesty will
permit some of the regiments of cavalry and dragoons, which I have in

last winter, and upon the same footing. I will owe you, my lord, a
very particular obligation, if you will be pleased to employ your influâˆ£ence
with the Queen, in obtaining this favour from her, by representing
to her, that these regiments may be absent from the Low Countries durâˆ£ing
the winter, without any prejudice to the public, and that I can send
them back at the opening of the next campaign; whereas, by neglecting
this precaution, some events may happen next winter in my neighbourâˆ£hood,
which will oblige me to recall all the troops which I have in the
service of the Queen and of the States. I wrote on this very subject to
the duke of Marlborough. It is of such importance, that I cannot doubt
but you will interest yourself in its success. I entreat you, my lord, to be
persuaded that I shall retain a grateful sense of this, and to allow me,
for the future, to testify, on all occasions which may offer, the perfect
confidence I have in you, and the distinguished esteem I have for your
merit. I am, very sincerely, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"TO accept my most humble acknowledgment, for the very great
honour I receiv'd of your Electoral Highness's letter of Sept. 4.
I take it as a particular mark of your goodness, that you think fit to
honor me with your commands; to obey which, I am equally engag'd
by duty and inclination. I had the honor to communicate your Elecâˆ£toral
Highness letter, yesterday, to the Queen at Windsor; and I wish
I were capable of expressing the obliging manner wherewith her Majesty
spoke of your Electoral Highness, and her readiness to comply with your
desires in that way which would most demonstrate her Majesty's concerne
for you and your most serene house; being wel assured that your Elecâˆ£toral
Highness will desire nothing that is inconsistent with the good of
the common cause. You are pleased to mention in your letter, that your
Highness had wrote to the duke of Marlborough upon this subject; and
the Queen thinks it wil be best to leave it to be adjusted between your
Electoral Highness's minister and the duke of Marlborough, as wel for
keeping the secret, that others may not ask the same, as also he being
at the head of the army, is best able to speak with your Electoral Highâˆ£ness's
minister upon every thing which relates to this affair; to this purâˆ£pose
Mr. secretary St. John has directions to write by this ordinary, to
my lord Marlborough.</P>
<P>I should have given your Electoral Highness frequent troble by my
letters, but that I was afraid of interrupting your greater affairs; and I
flatter myself with the belief that your Highness is so fully perswaded of
my inviolable attachment to your interest, that I can add nothing to it
by any thing I can write; being resolved that my actions shal demonâˆ£strate
the zeal and devotion wherewith I am, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"SINCE the letter I did myself the honour of writing to your Elecâˆ£toral

<PB N="251" REF="266"/>
in order to secure a post on the other side of the Scheld. It will be imaâˆ£gined,
perhaps, considering the vigour of the attacks, that the siege
hath continued too long; indeed the enemy take every method to hinder
us from finishing it, and the neighbourhood, not to say the presence, of
a superior army, always employed in distressing us, encouraged the beâˆ£sieged
to be obstinate. But, at length, we have found means of surâˆ£mounting
all obstacles, and of obliging the garrison to surrender themâˆ£selves
prisoners of war. I entreat your Electoral Highness to accept of
my humble felicitations on the success of this enterprise, which deserves
to be considered as an effect of the blessing of Heaven upon the just
cause of the High Allies; since neither the number nor the courage of
the enemy was able to frustrate our design. We shall be obliged to reâˆ£main
for some time yet in this camp, in order to repair the works of the
town, and put it out of a condition of being insulted. But the enemy
have taken all the precautions they could, in order to deprive us of subâˆ£sistence;
having for some days burnt all the forage in the country round
it, and likewise plundered and burnt the most considerable towns and vilâˆ£lages.

<P>"I AM much obliged to you for your letter of the 31st of August,
and for your having been pleased to communicate to me your plan
of operations for the ensuing campaign. I cannot but approve of it, in
all respects, and I consider it with you, as the surest means of reducing
France to the necessity of concurring in a reasonable peace. But I imaâˆ£gine
you will allow that secrecy is the life of this project, and that it is
necessary to avoid, with all possible attention, to give the enemy any
room to perceive it; since, in that case, they will not fail to take the neâˆ£cessary
measures for preventing a blow which may be so fatal to them,
and for forming magazines on their side, whatever expence they may cost
them. I leave you, then, Sir, to reflect, if by stationing the cavalry on
the frontiers, you will not discover too clearly to the French, what is so
<PB N="252" REF="267"/>
necessary to conceal from them. It appears to me likewise, that my
troops, though sent to more distant places, may, by speedy marches,
arrive time enough at the place where you will judge proper to assemble
the army. As to the rest, I hope that the measures which you will take
for the execution of your project, will be no obstacle to the return of
the few regiments of cavalry and dragoons which the necessity arising
from the state of affairs obliges me to demand of the Queen for some
months. It is about the end of autumn or beginning of winter that I
shall have principally occasion for them; and I reckon that I shall send
them back to you in time. I refer myself to my preceding letter conâˆ£cerning
the reasons which make me desirous of having them soon in
my dominions. They are of such importance for the security of this
neighbourhood, and for the common interest of the allies, that I cannot
doubt but they will have your approbation, and that you will employ your
influence to obtain from the Queen the favour which I demand. I am

<P>"I AM persuaded, from your friendship, you will have a particular
satisfaction, in the good news you now receive of the garrison's beâˆ£ing

confess we must own it as a very great providence, that all his endeaâˆ£vours

to obstruct us have meet with so little success. As I have not yet
received any reply to the answer I gave to the resolution of the counsel of
state at the Hague, relating to the project for the winter-quarters, whereof
I sent you a copy the 20th past, I have reason to apprehend they are not so
fully convinced as were to be wished of the necessity of persuing it; and,
as there is no time to be lost, I have prevaill'd with lord Albemarle to take
a journey to the Hague, to represent the great advantages that must acâˆ£crue
to the publick by the measures we propose. Besides, the papers whereâˆ£of
you have already copies, I have furnished his lordship with the like, to
be inclosed, by which you will see the arguments enforced; and how inâˆ£considerable
the expence of fforage will be, with respect to the great adâˆ£vantages
we may hope to reap from it. I could not enter into the other
articles of the expence, because they are very incertain. Besides that, it
may reasonably be expect'd the great towns, who will be eased, should
contribute towards it. As soon as his lordship returns, I shall let you
know the success of his journey. In the mean time, I hope lord Stair
will be with us, that there may be no delay on our side. Enclosed I send
you a letter Mr. Bulau has just now delivred to me from the Elector of
Hannover. I shall defer returning an answer, til I receive the Queen's
directions upon the contents; which, I pray, may be as soon as you can.
In the mean time, shall give you my opinion, that his Electoral Highâˆ£ness
should not be refused his request; but be desir'd to take from us as
few troops as possible; and that it might be insinuated to him, that her
Majesty will expect they should return into this country early in the

project which you have formed for taking the field early next year: but
it appears to me, that it will be sufficient for the execution of it, to
station the English and Dutch cavalry in the places on the frontiers;
where, being under the direction of their own generals, they may be
easily recruited. This must have the less difficulty, with regard to the
English cavalry, that they have always had their winter-quarters in places
in Flanders which are not far from those now in question. It will be
otherwise with my troops, which, in such quarters, will be no longer
under the inspection of my generals, and will be too distant to receive
their recruits with facility; whereas, when my troops are placed in their
usual quarters, I shall take particular care that their recruits shall be
sent to them early, and that the whole corps shall be in condition to march
to the rendezvous as soon as you shall judge proper to assemble the army.
I hope likewise I shall send back time enough the regiments of cavalry
and dragoons which I propose to bring this winter into my dominions.

<P>"THE earl of Rivers delivered to me the letter with which your
Majesty was pleased to honour me. I received, with the utmost
gratitude, the communication which you ordered him to make to me,
of the overtures of France for a general peace. I consider the care,
which your Majesty has taken of the interests of my family on this occaâˆ£sion,
as a continuance of that kindness of which you have given me so
many proofs, and which I shall always very highly esteem. After the
great things which your Majesty has done for your allies since your acâˆ£cession
to the throne, they have reason to hope that you will continue to
act in concert with them, and take the same care of their interests in the
ensuing treaty of peace, which you have taken during the course of so
glorious a war. The merit and rank of the earl of Rivers, and his atâˆ£tachment
to my family, are well known to me; and the confidence
which your Majesty places in him, is a new motive for me to esteem him
in the most distinguished manner. I doubt not but he will make a
faithful report to your Majesty, of my gratitude for your kindness, and
of the inviolable respect with which I am, &amp;c."</P>

whatever your Majesty will undertake, may give satisfaction to yourself

<P>"WE have seen by one of your private letters of the 27th of October,

a procuration for subscribing in the funds of the South Sea comâˆ£pany,
the 9375 <HI>l.</HI> sterling which are due to us by a warrant of the late
King William, and which have been acknowledged as a national debt,
in the last session of parliament. As it does not become us to make this
subscription, we shall not resolve upon it, but in case of necessity, preâˆ£ferring,
in all respects, to be paid this debt in cash. Our intention, thereâˆ£fore
is, that you should make representations to the lord treasurer to
obtain this payment, assuring him, that we shall be very particularly
obliged to the Queen, if her Majesty would be pleased to take, upon her
own account, stocks of the South Sea company, for the sum which is due
to us, and pay to us that sum, as it is very just we should receive it comâˆ£plete,

<P>If this expedient is not practicable, it will be necessary to subscribe to

to authorise you to do so, on our account. But you are not to
use it but a few days before the 25th of December, the day on which

the books are closed; since it is likely, that before that day, the baron
de Bothmar, our plenipotentiary, may arrive in London; he having

being unjust to give us but 80 <HI>l.</HI> sterling to pay us for 100, they could not
give us stock for the 20 per cent. remaining, which upon the whole sum,
would be an augmentation of 1900 <HI>l.</HI> sterling.</P>

<P>"I Consider, as a continuation of the friendship which you always testiâˆ£fied
for me, that you have been pleased to communicate to me the
commission which the Queen gave you, to treat of a peace, in concurâˆ£rence
with the States-general. It is true, that the Earl of Rivers likewise
has had orders, to communicate to the Elector, my son, and to me, her
Majesty's laudable intentions; but he did not enlarge upon the subject,
as you have been at the trouble to do. He has also brought a present to
the Queen's god-daughter, as an honourable mark of her favours, which
are infinitely esteemed. I would not, however, give my parchment
for it: since it will be an everlasting monument in the archives of Hanâˆ£nover;
and the present of the little princess will go, when she is grown
up, into another family. As for the rest, I will not combat all the reaâˆ£sons
which you produce, to make me acquainted with those which the
Queen has to be dissatisfied with her allies; but as her Majesty entered
into this war, for the good of her crown, and to hinder France from beâˆ£coming
too powerful; and as her Majesty's arms have been always vicâˆ£torious;
as my lord Rivers, last year, spoke of nothing but war, which the
Queen was determined to continue with the utmost vigour; and as all
<PB N="267" REF="282"/>
those things of which you speak, were then already past; you must not
be surprised, if so sudden a change creates astonishment, especially if a
peace is to be concluded upon such terms as are printed in the English
Gazettes. If you had been willing to accept peace on those terms, a
great deal of blood, and a great deal of the money of England and Holâˆ£land
might have been saved, and no one is ignorant of the state of
the Emperor's finances, which indeed England has generously and
bountifully supplied. As her Majesty finds now, the burden of this too
heavy for her people, it is not surprising that she looks out for a remedy,
which I heartily wish may contibute to her glory, and to the good of her
kingdoms, and of her allies. But hitherto, it was always believed, that
the too great power of France would be prejudicial to them all, and
especially to England. But you know this, undoubtedly, better than
I, who do not pretend to understand affairs of state. With regard to
those which are private, they will always incline me to be, with great
esteem for you, &amp;c."</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1712" UNIT="year"/><MILESTONE N="February." UNIT="month"/> THOUGH the earl of Oxford made use of the zeal, and even vioâˆ£lence
of the Tories, to possess himself of power, he was unwilling
to throw himself entirely into the hands of that party, by displacing all
the real and supposed Whigs. In the inferior departments, the retainers
of the former ministry still remained; and the duke of Marlborough was
continued at the head of the army The minister would have been exâˆ£tremely
glad to have gained over to his views that nobleman. But the
latter had entered into cabals with the opposite party, which he chose not
to relinquish, for the uncertain friendship of a man whom he had some
reason to distrust. The information conveyed to the ministry, concernâˆ£ing
the duke's designs, induced them to dismiss him abruptly from all
his offices, on the thirtieth of December, 1711. They knew that, in
conjunction with prince Eugene, who was daily expected in England, he
was forming plans dangerous to their own power, if not to the repose of
the kingdom. The intrigues between these two great generals and the
baron de Bothmar are minutely set forth by the marquis de Torcy, in his
memoirs; and he seems to have been well informed on the subject. His
relation is corroborated by several anecdotes, in the correspondence of the
Jacobites, in the present year. The first of their letters, in the order of

estate) so if at the trial the act be deficient, he will get an act for the fuâˆ£ture

<P>As to your affair, Mr. Harris [Harley] is entirely a friend to Mr. Sanâˆ£dy
[Hannover], notwithstanding the disobliging measures that spark has
taken to disoblige him personally, as ridiculing his endeavours; but his
head is set on shewing him he is above resentment, and that he has been
put in a wrong way; and that he has taken by the hand those that will
ruin his credit with his uncle Carre [the church of England], who will
certainly make him his heir, if he will yet abandon that ill-family that he
is so linked to at present; and, in order to prove his zeal, as soon as the
quarrel is made up with Mr. Jacob Smith [the King of France] and Miss
Dibby Jons [the princess Anne] he will send his relation to your cousin
Sandy [Hannover], to demonstrate to him that he is sincere; and, in the
mean time, he does all he can, in order to get him to prevail, by all the
arts that he is capable of. Those, he knows, look another way. He finds
ways to lessen and discourage, and whatever they have is what he cannot
avoid. He would not have a clamorous complaint; so manages it with
dexterity. Your relations [the church party] see it, but cannot help
themselves; for, on the other side, Mr. Willie [the Whigs] would ruin
them worse; so that, to use a modish expression, they are forced to hold
the candle to the devil, at present, and after a little time he will defy
them to hurt him, when the great decision is over.</P>
<P>Now to public news; I must inform you that the parliament, by the
votes which you see, have so exposed the allies, that it is plain they do
not intend to have any more of the same dealings with them, and that a
peace is certain. The Portugal minister said, at Somerset-house, in
<PB N="270" REF="285"/>
public, that the parliament had called his master rogue and rascal; but
that he was abused in good company, meaning the Emperor and the
Dutch. The Whigs croud after prince Eugene, and cabal with him
hourly; but it can come to nothing. The parliament is to go on the barâˆ£rier
treaty: that will lay a great scene open. The duke of Marlborough
did not sign it; but there is a letter of his, that proves that he ordered
my lord Townsend to sign it. They say the two scored articles are,
that the Dutch should have all the conquered towns from Cambray to
the other side for themselves, and that they are to furnish England with
30,000 men and 40 ships, for the loyalists of England to secure them.
The parliament will be judges of that design. The Queen declares they
did not let her read it, but said it was approved of by the council, so
she signed it. The article relating to Portugal is very dishonourable for
England; they agreeing to have our fleet to attend them, on all occaâˆ£sions
they thought proper for them. This makes a great noise, has exâˆ£posed
the Whigs more than all their other management, and left them
without excuse. The birth-day of the Queen, the duke of Marlborough
was in a chair in St. James's Park, with the curtains drawn; the mob,
that believed it to be the prince Eugene, huzza'd the chair; but the
duke modestly drew back the curtains and put himself out, and with a
sign shewed his dislike to the salutation. The mob, finding their misâˆ£take,
and that it was he, cried out, "Stop thief," which was a thorough
mortification to him. His daughters, that day, to shew their contempt
of the court, were in wrapping-gowns at a window in St. James's, to see
the company pass, two of them, and the other two drove through the
Pall-mall four times, in the worst mob-dress they could put themselves.
The duke was in a black suit, that day, and his son-in-law, the duke of
Montague, was at court in a plain, coarse, red coat, with a long shoulder-knot,
in ridicule of the day; but the Queen had the satisfaction to see
the most splendid court that ever was, and crowded more than ever, by
all the church, nobility and gentry. There was a short uproar. My lord
Marlborough finds his levees much thinner than they were, and daily
less and less. The people are disgusted at him. In a little time he will
be odious to them. How they huzza the duke of Ormond, who loves
popularity too well. Prince Eugene wears the sword the Queen gave
him, ever since the birth-day; it is worth 6000 <HI>l.</HI> He has had his anâˆ£swer
<PB N="271" REF="286"/>
from the third day he was here. The court wish him gone; but
my lord Oxford does not apprehend any thing from him. The Whigs,
since they missed sending him to the Tower by their impeachment, canâˆ£not
reach him since the additional lords. They say there will be fix more
made. The Whigs cry out at the number that was made to serve a turn,
and say it destroys one of the three parts of our constitution; and made
the Queen and lords one, which ought to be two parts, and the commons
the third. Though it is in the power of the crown, the trust is betrayed,
when used to destroy the power of parliaments. It cannot be imagined
how the votes that reflected on the allies have discouraged the Whigs; for
it has ended all their hopes of having the war continued. This news of
Brasette has been an unlucky stroke for the allies. The Scottish peers
will sit no more; they have absented themselves these five days; declare
the union broke; and this of liberty for the church-clergy is directly
against the agreement. The Scots will prove themselves the bribery,
and to whom the money was given to get it signed. There is nobody
made master of the horse; it is in commission, they say, till my lord
Strafford's return. The duke of Somerset is not yet out of the bed-chamâˆ£ber.
The lady Catharine Hyde is bed-chamber lady. My lord Notâˆ£tingham
continues to work to draw some over to the flying party, which
he designed to ruin the lord treasurer with; but it will not do. The
Dissenters are highly dissatisfied with the State-whigs, for betraying them,
as they call it. My lord treasurer declares to them he would have preâˆ£vented
it, if he could; for certainly he is a friend to them, though an
enemy to the State-whigs, who would have ruined him and his country."</P>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N. vol. iv. 4to. No. 7.</NOTE>The designs and projects of the Whigs against the Tory ministry discovered and
prevented, at the time prince Eugene came, and the duke of Marlborough
was turned out of all his employments.</HEAD>
<P>"THE whigish faction, being disappointed in the execution of all their
black designs since their being turned out, industriously made use
of the Emperor's and Hannoverian ministers (who were well prepared to
break off the treaty) to procure the aversion of the vulgar against a
peace.</P>
<P>The first step made towards it was, that the Emperor's ministers havâˆ£ing
acquainted baron Bothmar and the whigish faction, that he was well
<PB N="272" REF="287"/>
assured the Tory ministry intended to procure a match to be made, and
a marriage solemnized between the Pretender's sister and the King of
Sweden; and that restoring the Pretender would be the consequence of
such a match; and that he is in the bottom of the present negociation for
a peace.</P>
<P>This was calculated for a bait to bring over the ignorant part of the
commonalty on their side, as Doctor Sacheverel's sermon was serviceable
for the Tories, upon which ensued the late change of the ministry; and
accordingly Bothmar was prevailed upon to present the late memorial
to the Queen, who surreptitiously got it printed and published against the
sitting of the parliament.</P>
<P>But finding it had not the desired effect, they were resolved to leave no
stone unturned, and accordingly pressed prince Eugene's coming for
England, to lay before the Queen and parliament his master's mighty
proposals, viz. that England should have all the West Indies, and a free
trade throughout all Spain, and that 90,000 men, at his Imperial Maâˆ£jesty's
proper charges, should be employed wherever the Queen should
appoint.</P>
<P>These high proposals put them in mighty hopes of prevailing with the
Queen, having the house of lords already prepared, the majority being
Whigs: but, on the contrary, the Queen and ministry were so averse to
it, that, to balance the lords, she made twelve new peers all of a start,
whereby she has established a majority of the lords, as well as of the
commons, of her side for the peace.</P>
<P>But her Majesty, finding the faction so earnest for the prince's comâˆ£ing,
upon these occasions, dispatched a messenger to Holland, to preâˆ£vent
his coming over, who missing him, by reason of his having emâˆ£barked
before the messenger's arrival, and his being detained by contrary
winds for several days, it was thought necessary (in order to weaken his
pretensions and discountenance the faction) to remove the duke of Marlâˆ£borough
from all places of trust, which sudden and unexpected change
quite broke all their measures.</P>
<P>The prince at his landing, finding things in this dismal posture, and
foreseeing his fruitless errand, would expose him to a public ridicule, conâˆ£certed
with his party to form another plausible scheme of laying before
the Queen and both houses, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="288"/>
That his master had formed a new alliance with Holland, Prussia,
Denmark, Poland, the Czar of Muscovy, Hannover, and the other princes
of the Empire, and all the Hans Towns, for securing the protestant sucâˆ£cession,
and if possible to bring his Swedish Majesty into the alliance.
But the ministry look upon all this to be only a design to get the maâˆ£nagement
again into their own hands, rather than a sincere intention of
performing any better, than the last treaty has been executed on the late
Emperor's part; and accordingly rejected it.</P>
<P>Then little Eugene thought of another project, viz. To have the duke

and conducted with great acclamations and huzzas through the city,
where great illuminations and ringing of bells was to be made, and the
mob to cry out, No peace, No peace; and then great and splendid enâˆ£tertainments
were to be made by subscription for him. All which fine
doings were timely prevented, by the vigilance of the ministry, who were
truly apprized of it.</P>

<P>"THE deputation of the city of Ghent in Flanders, representing the
generality of that province, cast themselves at your Majesty's feet,
and, with all respect and submission, set forth: That the glorious battle
of Ramillies, which was fought by the troops of her High Allies against
the French, had given us hopes of being freed from their tyranny.
Whereas general Cadogan, whom your Majesty was pleased to appoint,
in the room of Mr. Stepney, for the general government, and my lord
duke, persons who tread under foot the glory of your Majesty and of all
the English nation, in that, in the year 1706, at the taking of the city
of Ghent, they immediately made an agreement, with the members of
that province, promising them their protection and continuance of it,
notwithstanding they had served the enemy, the French, which they perâˆ£formed,
and thereby reaped the benefit of the sweat and blood of the
poor provinces of Flanders; my lord duke having got six thousand pisâˆ£toles,
and general Cadogan one thousand in specie.</P>
<P>After a regulation was forthwith framed, for the better direction of
the said province, signed by the said lord duke and the deputies of the
States of Holland, the 6th October 1706; but the same being to the
prejudice of those persons who were in offices, and whose perquisites were
thereby somewhat restrained, they entreated the said lord duke and Cadoâˆ£gan
to inhibit the same, which was likewise granted them, whereby Caâˆ£dogan
got for himself 40,000 gilders, out of the said poor and exhausted
province, which has been for so many years the feat of war, and supplied
with bad directors, who have made themselves rich as Croesus, and enâˆ£tirely
impoverished the province.</P>
<P>The consequence which befel the High Allies, by those infamous and
contribution-thirsty thieves, the lord duke and Cadogan, in their causing
the aforesaid persons to be continued in their employments, namely in
the magistracy, was, that in the year 1708, they contrived and accomâˆ£plished
the betraying the towns of Ghent and Bruges; the army of the
High Allies being thereby brought in the greatest danger of perishing all
at once. My lord duke and Cadogan, whether they had a hand in it or
not, agreed anew with the said persons in offices to procure for them a
general pardon, which my lord duke promised to obtain by your Maâˆ£jesty,
as it also happened, notwithstanding that the said lord duke and
<PB N="275" REF="290"/>
Cadogan were fully informed and knew themselves the secret correspondâˆ£ence
of our governors with the generals and ministers of the enemy, as
also the persons who contributed thereto; and for the said general parâˆ£don,
the first got two hundred thousand gilders, and the latter ten thouâˆ£sand
pistoles, all out of the remainder of the revenues of the said ruined
province of Flanders.</P>
<P>The aforesaid members or governors of the said province have, not
long since, given to the said Cadogan, the sum of five thousand pistoles,
upon his promise that they should be continued in their employments;
which sum he has received at Brussels, in the house of the Sieur Vanderâˆ£gote,
one of the council of state, his great friend; besides other gentleâˆ£men
of the said council, who are enemies of the High Allies and protectors
of their enemies; and that was done at the time that our convoy was
beaten between Ghent and Courtray, in the parish of St. Eloyvive, when
instead of furthering the service of the war, he preferred his own interest.</P>
<P>Over and above the several sums, which he and my lord duke have
otherwise exacted from our poor province, we shall allege no other for
shortness sake, this serving only to observe that they have continued such
members in the magistracy of Ghent and Bruges, notwithstanding they
had served the French before, and had contrived and accomplished the
betraying of the said towns, only thereby to continue to feed their avaâˆ£rice
by extortions from the poor province, that those persons might not
discover to your Majesty and parliament their thieveries.</P>
<P>The matter is come to that pitch, that her Majesty having no opinion
of the conduct of those two money-thirsty persons, the duke and Cadoâˆ£gan,
they are capable to induce the aforesaid members to give attestaâˆ£tions
of their good behaviour in having reaped no profits from this proâˆ£vince;
but, it is hoped, that your Majesty and the parliament will have
no regard to them, it being certain, that one thief will not willingly disâˆ£cover
another; that is to say, that the said lord duke and Cadogan, who
have procured to the said directors of our province the amnesty concernâˆ£ing
the said treachery, will easily be induced to excuse those that proâˆ£tected
them: and to discover the truth of what is above mentioned, that
her Majesty will please to cause an inquiry to be made into the conduct
and roguery of those two persons during the war in the Netherlands, by
<PB N="276" REF="291"/>
such members of the new parliament as have been employed under
them as officers in her Majesty's service.</P>
<P>We prostrate ourselves at your Majesty's feet with all humility, that
your Majesty will be pleased to reflect on the premises, and consider the
miserable condition, in which our aforesaid province is involved by this
long war, and to deliver and free us of the said lord duke and Cadogan,
two professed thieves to our province and the reputation of your Majesty
and the whole English nation, who are pleased to pay their troops and
officers so largely with their own money and never permitted that any of
their chief officers, as these two, should enrich themselves so unreasonâˆ£ably
with the money of our poor country, much less to protect such perâˆ£sons,
as shewed their affection entirely for the French, and still correspond
with them. There is so much of this, that all the favours they have
shewed to the enemy would be sufficient to fill a book, the sending of
money to sustain the war against us being one of their least favours.</P>
<P>We further pray your Majesty to send another plenipotentiary to our
government, with express orders, to turn out all such persons in the maâˆ£gistracy,
who have served the enemy, and to put in their room such perâˆ£sons,
who are fit to serve your Majesty and to ease our poor province.
As for secretary Laws, like masters like men, of whom no good testiâˆ£mony
can likewise be given. Wherefore, we pray, likewise, your Majesty
to appoint another in his room; and, in so doing your Majesty will find
plainly more prosperity in your arms, restore the reputation of the nation,
and further have the blessing of God Almighty, for having punished the
bad, for which all superiors are ordained. And in case your Majesty is
not pleased to appoint other ministers, in the room of Cadogan and Laws
as also my lord duke, who will better promote the glory of your Majesty
and the reputation of the parliament and English nations, who must imâˆ£mediately
change the respective magistrates, as is usual every year, acâˆ£cording
to the customs and privileges of the country, we shall still be
governed by, and remain under, traitors to your Majesty and the High
Allies, who were serviceable to the enemy, and were put into those emâˆ£ployments
and have now continued in them for four years together, which
if not remedied, we should be happier to be governed by Turks than by
that British thief Cadogan. Relying on the protection of your Maâˆ£jesty,
<PB N="277" REF="292"/>
and hoping for the same, we remain, with the utmost respect,

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Have received yours of the 1st. I shall, since it is a satisfaction to
you, give you an account of all the public news that I hear. The
vote of the house of commons against my lord Townsend, for signing the
Barrier treaty, which declares him an enemy to the Queen and counâˆ£try,
it is believed, will have no other consequence, 'till after the peace,
but to give a latitude to our plenipotentiaries, to act on the most advanâˆ£tageous
terms they can, notwithstanding that treaty. The death of the
Dauphin has put the Whigs in fresh hopes, that prince Eugene has preâˆ£vailed
to get it insisted on, that Spain and the Indies shall be the Emâˆ£peror's.
He cabals daily with the Whigs, in a very indecent manner; the
great project is, to have the prince of Hannover here, to nose the Queen,
at least; but their aims are further. The Dutch, Hannover, and Emâˆ£peror's
ministers here, are laying a scheme for it, and have carried it so
far, that the command of the army, this Summer, is not offered to the
prince of Hannover, as was intended. The duke of Ormond comâˆ£mands
<PB N="280" REF="295"/>
in Flanders, and is fitting up his equipage. The vote of the
Lords, which they got by surprise, the house being thin, and the Scotch
lords retiring, to make themselves considerable, the Whigs carried it, and
addressed, with a detestation to the articles from France, though they did
not come judiciously before them; it was only to encourage the Dutch,
and Emperor, and Portugal, to insist on great demands; but had no
weight here. The house of commons being zealous for the good of the
kingdom, out-balances all their tricks, and the ministry treat sure and
gain ground daily. The scheme is only to expose and discourage, and
undeceive the kingdom; their punishment will be left 'till the peace is
finished. It is my lord of Oxford's politics to smooth and check, and
would not have removed the duke of Marlborough, if it had not been
absolutely necessary. The Hannover minister is highly displeased at an
accident that has happened; his letters he sent by a servant, betwixt 11
and 12 to the general post house: atâ€”, he was robbed of his letâˆ£ters
and what little he had about him. Theâ€”will have it, our miâˆ£nister
laid the design to come by his letters. It was not amiss to find
what he and prince Eugene have been contriving with the Whigs. He
has had his answer, from the first of his coming, and has been told, by a
side wind, that the court is not satisfied with his stay, since he is so close
in cabals with the dissatisfied lords. He told him, that said this to
him, that he knew that; but he should do what was convenient to his inâˆ£terest.
If he stays much longer, he will be sent away, contrary to the
Queen's first resolution. His nephew is taken ill of the small pox; so
that gives a fresh pretence. The Whigs have so contrived it, that it
will be moved, at the congress, to remove the prince that is in France.
By the instigation of the Whigs, this is moved here, by prince Eugene,
in the Emperor's name, and that all the allies shall be guarantees for the
succession of Hannover; but it is believed our plenipotentiaries have
instructions not to have any such guarantees, which would limit the
people of England; for hereafter, in case of necessity, they must ask all
the allies leave to choose a King, and my lord chief justice has declared
it treason in those that signed the Barrier treaty. On that account, all
the people in the country have got the book which I hope you have,
called "The conduct of the late ministry and the allies;" and another,
"The obligations that the Dutch have to us." They are two books worth
<PB N="281" REF="296"/>
reading. They have set us in a right light, and have so exasperated all
the counties of England against the late ministry and our allies, that
they are in some counties ready to address the Queen, to punish those
that acted in all their vile practices; and now the barrier treaty itself,
with remarks on it, is published, written by the same hand, which is a
very good one. They are approved and directed by my lord Oxford;
the Whigs answer them, but in that railing evading manner that has no
force.</P>
<P>My lord Marlborough is very humble, visits every creature that has
any credit. To general Webb, he sent to know, when he would be at
home, he would visit him. He sent him word, he never would be at
home to him; that he had done him all the injustice he could, when he was
in power, and that now he would do him all the justice he could, which
he thought he deserved; and my lord Wharton told my lord treasurer,
that he played well at whist. What he could not make by tricks, he
made up by knaves. The treasurer answered him, that they believed
the game up before he took the cards, and had made tricks out of all the
knaves, let who would hold them; but he observed their game, and
should be sorry to be thought a bungler. The house of commons are
resolved to throw Walpole out of the house again. He was chosen aâˆ£gain;
but now they have lodged a petition against him. The Hannover
resident took the liberty to threaten some of the leading members, with
his master's resentment, if they pretended to meddle with the barrier
treaty, but did not deter them; but, as a jest, it is said, the same memâˆ£bers
caused his servant to be robbed of his letters, to see what he had
writ of them. All here believe the peace certain. We have strange
stories sent from France, of the duke of Orleans being taken in the very
act of incest with his daughter, the dutchess of Berry, when he had
made her, and the lady the duke de Berry had a design of, drunk; whilst
one debauched her, the other abused his own daughter; and that the
Dauphin was poisoned; these stories are common; they were first told
by Madam Malous, the niece of the late lord Feversham, who lives at
Somerset-house, where prince Eugene is every night, at least, three times
a week. She pretends to have letters of it from France. There all the
foreign ministers are two or three times a week. Baron Bothmar, the
Hannover Envoy, daily shews his dislike to my lord of Oxford, and
<PB N="282" REF="297"/>
does his master great prejudice by it, and has turned the court against
his proceedings. Prince Eugene is angry, thatâ€”â€”put
in his advertisement by way of jest: a reward for any that could bring
the names of these fifty persons, his mother the dutchess of Bollin poiâˆ£soned.

<P>The truth of the following anecdotes is, in some degree, ascertained by
collateral proofs. The marquis de Torcy, in his memoirs, mentions
them, with corroborating circumstances; and he was not a writer, that
advanced facts upon mere surmises, being a man of integrity, intelligence,
and abilities. The Stuart Papers of the present year are full of anecâˆ£dotes
of the same kind; and the ministry, by the precautions they took,
seemed to have been convinced, that dangerous conspiracies were formed.
There can scarce a doubt be entertained, that Marlborough, prince Euâˆ£gene

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Meâˆ£morandum book, 8vo.</NOTE>Anecdotes concerning the Duke of Marlborough, the Peace, and the designs of
the Duke and prince Eugene against the Ministry.</HEAD>
<P><DATE>April 10, 1749.</DATE>â€”"MR. Erasmus Lewis told me, that at the latter
end of 1709 or beginning of 1710, Queen
Anne sent for lord Somers, and told him, as they were alone, she having
an opinion of his judgment and impartiality, desired him to tell her his
opinion of the Duke of Marlborough. He said he would; and told her
that he was the worst man that God Almighty ever made; that his amâˆ£bition
was boundless and his avarice insatiable; and that he had neither
honour nor conscience to restrain him from any wicked attempt, even
against her person, as well as against his country, &amp;c. Somers (as the
Queen was weary of the dâ€”ss) expected to be made first minister, but
was baulked. The Queen had expressed herself advantageously of his
honour, integrity, and capacity. During the debates about the peace, in
opposition to it, M. de Torcy acquainted lord Oxford, that after the
Duke of Marlborough had hindered the peace of 1706, when it should
have been made, he had treated with the French court to make them one,
and was to have two millions of crowns for it. This would have been
done, but for M. Chamillard, a weak minister, who during the siege of
Lisle, came to Valenciennes, sent the duke of Marlborough word, that
he expected he would raise the siege of Lisle, as a proof of his sincerity in
the peace they had treated and settled. The duke of Marlborough was
angry, and wrote to the duke of Berwick, that there was an end of the
affair, and he would have nothing more to do with the treaty.</P>
<P>When M. de Torcy discovered this, the King of France allowed lord
Oxford to make use of it, to send the duke of Marlborough abroad; but
insisted that his life should not be touched; and so it was. They had a
meeting at Thomas Harley's house, in James street, Westminster. Oxâˆ£ford
coming to the street door, in his coach, the duke of Marlborough in
a chair to the garden door opening into the park; it was then resolved,
<PB N="284" REF="299"/>
that the duke of Marlborough should go abroad. Prince Eugene and
lord Wharton both said, on the occasion, that the duke of Marlborough
had not a clear conscience, or he would not have submitted to that
step.</P>
<P>Several measures were proposed to oppose the peace, and several
schemes sent to Vienna; some for seizing the Queen, others for seizing
the ministry, and one for assassinating Oxford and Bolingbroke in their
chairs. Prince Eugene wrote about this last, to count Zinzendorff, then
at the Hague; who wrote, in answer, that such measures were extremely
hazardous, and scarce to be undertaken; but if this was resolved on, he
advised prince Eugene to come over to Holland, before it was executed.</P>
<P>Among other schemes, one was for the duke of Marlborough, by his
power, as general, to assemble 2 or 3000 men, at an hour, in different
squares of Westminster, and to seize St. James's. This was discovered,
and lord Oxford sent to Mr. Lewis to come immediately to the office,
that morning, his presence being necessary by ten o'clock. When he
came, he found the lord chancellor and all the lords of council there.
The business was to supersede the duke of Marlborough's commission, as
general, under the broad seal. There had been before an order under
the privy seal sent him not to act more as general; but his commission
being under the great seal, could not be superseded, but by a revoâˆ£cation
under the great seal. When this was done, the duke of Marlboâˆ£rough
would not act so against law, as to rendezvous the men: he was
not made for hazards.</P>
<P>He said, the duke of Marlborough's quitting the opposition to the
peace, had ruined his credit at Hannover and at the Hague. King
George was resolved to make no alteration in ministry, but 40000 <HI>l.</HI> given
to Bothmar, at the Hope, caused the duke of Marlborough's apology to
to be accepted, and all Queen Anne's ministers to be turned out<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot"><P>Erasinus Lewis, was under secretary to the Earl of Oxford.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"BY one of our late mails I received a letter from you, but without
date; however, it being the only one I have of yours unanswered,
you will have no difficulty in judging of what I speak. Mr. Wat. Thoâˆ£mas
[Mr. Lilly] who is, at present, a part of our family, desired me to
tell you, that he had yours of the 18th instant, which he will answer
shortly, as business shall arise. What I hinted in my last, of Mr. Matâˆ£hew
Jude and party [the Low Church], seeming in a disposition to play
some frolick of youth [rise in rebellion] has even a greater appearance
than before. But how to give direction for Mr. Kee's [the King's] beâˆ£haviour,
in such an event, is not easy, at this distance, to do; however,
what I am asked, I will tell you the thought of our house and partners.
At what time, or in what court these gentlemen will think fit to prosecute
<PB N="286" REF="301"/>
their frolic,<MILESTONE N="March." UNIT="month"/> is difficult to say; it is talked, as if Mr. Diederick Hamilton
[Hannover] was to come hither, assisted by cousin Jasp and party [the
Dutch]; and to countenance his coming, Mr. Jaselin's relations [the
house of lords] are waiting a favourable opportunity to give him an inâˆ£vitation.
Be it by this, or what other means soever, Mr. Matthew Judd
[the Low Church] begins his work; it seems absolutely necessary too,
that Mr. Lours [the King] should be upon the place as soon as possible,
to take care of his own effects; his aunt Susan [Scotland], if one may
believe her, will give him a most hearty welcome; and though she cannot
advance much money for carrying on of the suit, yet his adversaries will
probably be no better supplied; every body being unwilling to venture
in the present state of things, in which there are hardly three persons, how
long soever friends, who would be able to take council together. In
short Mr. Lours [the King] will undoubtedly provide himself the best he
is able, and for the rest <HI>Deus providebit.</HI> There is a report here, as if
he intended to make a journey to see his kinsman Obedia Townsend [Saâˆ£voy
duke] and country; but, to tell you true, his friends think that a
great way off. But it is time to tell you something of our public matters.
The occasional-bill, whatever misery might be intended by it, has not yet
raised any stir, nor gives the least appearance of doing so. Prince Eugene,
besides his feasting from house to house, has proposed very little business;
and, if he thinks fit to stay a month longer, in the same way, will be as
little mentioned as any ensign in his army. Our court keeps still its disâˆ£position
for peace, in which it is backed by the house of commons; but
the Tory majority in the lord's house is but small, and by the absence of
some of them, they are now and then trapped in an odd vote. In a little
time, we shall see what is to be hoped for, as to peace; and as that proâˆ£ceeds
or goes back, our parties shape their hopes. Pray my service to
honest Hicks, and tell him his friends are well, but want to hear from
him. I am, &amp;c."</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>Mr. Menzies, so often exhibited under the feigned name of Abram
is the Scotch gentleman mentioned by Monsieur Menager, in the account
of his secret negociations in England.</P>
<P>Menager having signed the preliminary articles of a separate treaty beâˆ£tween
France and Britain, employed the time he staid afterwards in
London, in attempting, according to his instructions, to render some
service to the court of St. Germains, and introduced the subject in a
conversation with Mr. St. John. They foresaw, that the King of
France would be obliged, in the ensuing treaty, <Q REND="inline">"not so much to abanâˆ£don
the chevalier, as to acknowledge the succession of the crown in the
house of Hannover, as it was mentioned in the second preliminary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minute of Monsicur Menager's negociation.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager proposed that a secret article should be made by the Queen,
to disengage the King from all the obligations of such agreements upon
such subsequent occasions as might happen; and a declaration from her
Majesty, that all the engagements the King should enter into in the
treaty of peace, should be so understood by the Queen. St. John was
afraid the Queen would not sign such a declaration; but he thought she
would declare, by word of mouth, that she would be satisfied to underâˆ£stand
the treaty in such a manner; and that whenever she disengaged the
King from it, the obligation on him, as to the recognition of the sucâˆ£cession,
should cease. Bolingbroke mentioned this proposal to the
Queen; and, with her consent, introduced Menager to Mrs. Masham,
that he might learn her Majesty's intentions from that lady, as he himâˆ£self
did not choose to meddle further in the affair.</P>
<P>Two points were agreed upon between Menager and Mrs. Masham:
First, <Q REND="inline">"that, for the satisfaction of the people at home, and the allies
abroad, the King should be required, in the Queen's name, to abandon
her brother and his interest, on pretence of adhering to the succession as
it was now established."</Q></P>
<P>2d. <Q REND="inline">"That nevertheless, this seeming to abandon the said interest,
was to be so understood, that the King should not be obliged, in case of
her Majesty's decease, not to use his endeavours for the placing the said
prince on his father's throne, to which he had an undoubted right<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 276.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="304"/>
Mrs. Masham told him, <Q REND="inline">"that it was the present unhappiness of the
Queen to possess the throne of her brother, which she had no other claim
to than what the political measures of the state had made legal, and in a
sort necessary; which, however, she believed, gave her Majesty oftenâˆ£times
secret uneasiness: that this was not all the misfortune, but that,
by the same necessity of state, she was obliged, not only against her disâˆ£position,
but even against her principles, to further and promote the
continuance of the usurpation, not only beyond her own life, but for
ever. That I might be sure, under such circumstances, it would be an
inexpressible satisfaction to her Majesty, to see herself delivered from the
fatal necessity of doing so much wrong; and if it could be possible, with
safety to the religion and liberties of her subjects, to have her brother reâˆ£stored
to his right, at least, after her decease, if it could not be done
before."</Q></P>
<P>"That it was true the Queen did not see through this; and it seemed
next to impossible, <Q REND="inline">"the rage and irreconcilable aversion of the greatest
part of the common people to her brother being grown to such a
height:"</Q> nay, she said, the Queen found it would be impossible to
enter upon any treaty of peace, or so much as to let the people hear of
putting an end to the war, without entering into the strongest engageâˆ£ments
possible for the confirming the succession in the house of Hannover;
<Q REND="inline">"a thing that I am sure, says she, is all our aversions;"</Q> and we have
no retreat but to his most Christian Majesty, in hopes of his ordering
things so at this treaty, that he may be at liberty to support and assist in
the work, whenever an opportunity should present itself: that, to this
end, the plenipotentiaries from hence, <Q REND="inline">"though there was no commuâˆ£nicating
any thing to them by way of confidence,"</Q> should be instructed
not to insist upon things more than necessity obliged; and <Q REND="inline">"some reâˆ£serves,
sure," says she, "may be made, to leave room for justice to take
place in time to come<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minute of Monsieur Menager's negociation, <HI>p.</HI> 282.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager, upon his arrival at Utrecht, where he acted as one of the
plenipotentiaries from France, found that the British ministers had not
received the private instructions which lady Masham gave him reason to
expect would be sent to them; and he afterwards discovered, that
the agents of the court of St. Germains had made the concerns of
the chevalier the subject of a private negociation with the ministry in
<PB N="290" REF="305"/>
England. These agents were obliged, at last, to write to the King of
France <Q REND="inline">"in plain terms, that the ministry in England were men of no
honour; that they had held them in suspense for a long time;
and that now, they not only did not come to the point with them,
but declined any conversation on the subject; only said in general,
that a certain person would be sent over to Utrecht, who should disâˆ£course
by word of mouth freely, and should settle that affair so as should
be agreeable to all parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minute of Monsieur Menager's negociation, <HI>p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Lady Masham, in a letter to Menager, dated St. James's, March 2,
1712, says, <Q REND="inline">"I take it for granted, that they (the court of St. Gerâˆ£mains)
are fallen into the hands of my Lord Treasurer: he loves a secret,
and is famous for making intricacies, where there is a sterility of inâˆ£trigues;
and no less renowned for causing every thing of such a nature
to miscarry. If their assurances are from him, I doubt not, he values
himself upon having deceived them; and if the person to be sent to
Utrecht comes from him, I dare promise you, that when he comes there,
he wants his instructions<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 310.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager, who hated all the agents of the court of St. Germains, and
was equally hated by them, says, that <Q REND="inline">"all this was owing to the imâˆ£patience
and jealousy of the court of St. Germains, who, though the
King had agents of his own in London, who, perhaps, did their utmost,
yet they at St. Germains, being uneasy, could not refrain sending a secret
embassy themselves. This, it seems, was a Scotchman, who pretended
great interest with a Scotch lord, who was an officer of state in England;
but either the messenger failed in the interest he pretended to have, or the
Scotch nobleman failed in what he promised to do for him; seeing the
sum of his negociation was briefly this; that after a long stay, he perâˆ£formed
only there two notable exploits, viz. first, that he spent a great
deal of their money; and secondly, that he ruined and exposed the business
which he was entrusted with; and at last, came away with nothing but
an empty promise from the said Scotch lord, that a person should be sent
over to negociate that matter with the French and British ministers togeâˆ£ther<NOTE N="â€¡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 314.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager had strong prejudices against the earl of Middleton. He
gives the postscript of a letter he wrote to lady Masham. <Q REND="inline">"A Scotchâˆ£man
<PB N="291" REF="306"/>
from St. Germains, and a Scotchman in your court, have been the
agents to deceive one another, and to abuse their masters. As to the
inquiring who the secret has remained with, they confess now, at St.
Germains, that it has really remained with no body: for so ill a choice
did they make of their agent, that he has not only exposed his errand
but his employer: and our people in London are very free to send word
hither how ill he has acquitted himself; though, by the way, I must
observe, that this was not done till after they had been amused with the
persuasions of this person, to believe things were in a good train, when
they were indeed in hands who intended nothing less than to perform
what was proposed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Minute of Monsieur Menager's negociation,</HI> p. 316.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Menager's account of this negociation appeared so extraordinary, that
it hath hitherto met with little credit from the public; but it will be
found to coincide with what relates to Menzies, under the borrowed
name of Abram in Nairne's letters, and with the account which the well
known John Plunket gives of his own intrigues. He acknowledges,
that he allowed himself to be amused with promises by the earl of Oxford.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>About restoring the Pretender at the Queen's death, and the part the Earl of
Oxford acted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"WHat you see demanded by England will not be insisted on by the
parliament, in relation to his leaving that country, if the King
<PB N="296" REF="311"/>
of France is firm in desiring the King's stay, for, although Harley is,
as I have always told you, a Whig, and an enemy to the King, the parâˆ£liament
would be friends if they could find a way to show it. But he
cramps all, and makes each man afraid to appear inclined to the interest
their inclinations would lead them to. All well-inclined are enraged at
Harley's proceedings, and that part of the commons they call the Octoâˆ£ber
club of forty. He screens, I mean Mr. Harley, that not any of
the first nobility can get an audience, but with the utmost difficulty; so
that he will govern this affair, I mean the peace, and certainly intends
to make up with Hannover, although at present they differ. But, after
all Hannover's attempts have failed, he will be glad to make up with
Harley. But the best part of the gentry, and half the nobility, are reâˆ£solved
to have the King; the parliament would do it in a year, if it
could be believed he had changed his religion. They would not impose
it, but would have it reported, to give them a handle: for to change,
on that account, would render him unworthy of wearing what was so
got; but they tell me, they do not desire it to be done, only said to be
done.</P>
<P>The paper that comes a-part is from Mr. Plunket, who would have
M. Torcy to know the contents; it is what prince Eugene has been conâˆ£triving
with the cabal.</P>
<P>Princess Anne and Harley have had it discovered to them, that prince
Eugene and the cabal have laid a design to have Harley, the keeper, and
St. John taken off; and the ways that are now practised<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Mohocks sent, by night, through the streets.</NOTE> was to be the
forerunner, and done as a frolic, till it had raised a tumult, and in the
disorder to act that part, and Hannover's agent here was in the consult.
Princess Anne was terribly frighted, and Harley has got lodgings in her
house, and aster it is dark does not stir out of that house: the honest
men wish him out of the way, but dare not appear against the peace,
because it would ruin the nation; they would be glad otherwise to opâˆ£pose
it, because it would ruin him; for the nation cannot bear the war a
year longer, but would sink.</P>

<P>"MR. Arnold's letter to Nelson [Middleton], of the 4th, O. S. came
safe, with Berry's inclosed, which was delivered to Plessington
[the King] and Wisely [the Queen], who desired me to tell Berry, that
they were very glad to hear he had seen Mr. Armsworth [Marlborough].
They are fully persuaded, that he is now very sorry that he has not solâˆ£lowed
their advice, in compounding their debts, whilst he had sufficient
effects in his hands; but it is the misfortune of very many just men to
let themselves be over-ruled by pretended friends, who have different
views. However, pray see him as soon as you can; and you may very
truly assure him of the friendship that Goodall [the King] has for him,
the confidence he has in him, and the assistance he expects from him;
for, though his affairs are in a low condition, by reason of his losses at sea,
yet his prudence and experience may be of great use; and his substantial
associates may put him in a condition to appear again on the Exchange,
and establish his credit on a sure bottom. But it is very natural for Plesâˆ£sington
[the King] to expect to hear from him, to know by what ways
and means, when and how he designs to do him justice.</P>
<P>'Squire Young [princess Anne] is so entirely in Goldsmith Baker's
[Harley's] power, that we cannot tell what judgment to make of him.
Manning [the King of France] knocks under the table; so that we must
shift for ourselves. Nothing but want of bread can make us go to Mr.
Deane's door, being sensible that would be the greatest misery that could
befal us. I am confident that Gurney [Marlborough] and Gilburn [Goâˆ£dolphin]
will be grieved at heart to see our present distress, and use their
best endeavours to relieve us.</P>

<P>The draught which Mr. Nairne mentions here, is in the earl of Middleâˆ£ton's
hand, and as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"THE Queen having some assurance, that, at this treaty of peace,
her jointure will be allowed her, or rather a pension equivalent
to it, her design is to make use of your assistance in the receiving of it;
but that matter not being yet settled, she is not willing to have it pubâˆ£lickly
spoke of, or to say any thing further relating to it, than to consult
about a form for a letter of attorney, or power to authorise you thereâˆ£unto.</P>
<P>The difficulty consists in this, how to avoid owning the government
in what she signs herself, and yet not to offend it: so that to compass
these two points, and yet make the instrument valid, is the matter you
are desired to advise with some judicious council about.</P>
<P>Should the Queen style herself Queen-mother, she supposes, that will
not be allowed; should she style herself Queen-dowager, that would be
a lessening of herself, and a prejudice to the King her son; which she
will never do.</P>
<P>The question is, therefore, whether the instrument may not be good
without any title at all, only the word "We"; (for in as much as it will
be signed Maria R. and sealed with her seal, one would think the person
<PB N="299" REF="314"/>
would be sufficiently denoted); but if that be not sufficient, then wheâˆ£ther
any other expression can be invented to the intent mentioned.</P>
<P>Our council here think she might style herself thus: "Mary, Queen Conâˆ£sort
of James the Second, late King of England, Scotland, France, and
Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c." to all unto whom these presents may
come, sends greeting, &amp;c.; and so go on according to the form here inâˆ£closed.
In fine, you are desired to advise about this matter, and send the
result, as soon as with convenience you can, that her Majesty may not
be to seek in so material a point, when the time comes to use it.</P>
<P>If the inclosed form, upon other accounts, be improper, please send a
draught of such an one as is thought sit; and, if it must be drawn upon
stamped paper, please to send a sheet or two also.</P>
<P>Her Majesty is to allow you two hundred pounds a year, as a salary
for this trouble, besides all incident charges, and is sorry her circumâˆ£stances
will not permit her to make it more considerable; however, is
desirous that what advantage was to be had by it, it should be given to
you, preferable to any other person, as a mark of her Majesty's sense of
your constant zeal and fidelity in her service."</P>

all the speed you can, at Mr. Hacket's at Rotterdam. He will
tell you what will be of the greatest consequence to the King, and to the
King of France; he is sent by Mr. Harley and the cabinet-council; his
stay may be but short; you must make haste. I hope the King is in a
condition of health to give his orders to you. My lord Middleton may,
if he pleases, acquaint the King of France's minister, Monsieur de Torcy,
to send one too, or let you bring back what is fit they should know. By
arts, Mr. Harley has kept Mr. Plunket from going till now; but he cannot
now hinder the King's being established; for it is resolved by the parliaâˆ£ment
and the leading men. The discovery of the allies and Hannover
have given the blow.</P>
<P>Where the King was to land last time, is where his friends desire may
be the place; but things are not ripe yet. Mr. Plunket will let you see
how all things are carried; and he desires you may be the person sent to
meet him. He wrote to you, by my direction; and when you come to
Rotterdam, you must not take notice he is Mr. Plunket, but call him
Rogers to the merchant, Mr. Hacket, who does not know him. I need
not desire this to be the greatest secret; you will guess at the reason of it.</P>
<P>The King of France is sure in the wrong, not to grant us every reaâˆ£sonable
thing; since it is resolved to make a separate peace. The Whigs,
sure, must have used art to bring them to refuse us good terms, which
would justify our leaving the others to treat for themselves.</P>
<P>All the practices I have sent you word of, will be laid before the parâˆ£liament.
It has ruined Hannover; he will never come here, if he comes
not now, by the Whigs means, and contrary to the desire of princess
Anne and the parliament, and all the body of the church party; the
Dutch dare not venture on such a prospect.</P>
<P>You must write to Mr. Plunket, and inclose it to Mr. Hacket, and Mr.

for I am very well, and have often told you so, could my letters
get to you, which I hope they have long before this, and that Mr. Massy

in your new employment, though the occasion of it was dismal to
all; and you cannot imagine how generally she is lamented, even by
those, that have ever been enemies to her family. I and mine have
shared so in your loss that we thought our sorrows could have no addiâˆ£tion,
when we heard your Chevalier was recovered; but now we find
our mistake; for, since we had yours to my daughter Jeany, 'tis said at
court he is despaired of, and on the Exchange that he is dead; that he
eat too much meat, and got a cold with going out too soon. If this be
true, all honest people will think no more of this world; for sure never
was mortals so unfortunate as we. You may guess at our condition;
which, by the worst of natures, would be pitied. Your doctor gave us
hopes, last night, there was no good grounds for such reports; but whom
to believe, or what to think, our concern is too great to know; but every
moment we are either going or sending to inquire for comfort, but find
none yet. Pray Heaven this day gives us some, for the wind is fairer for
it. I beg you will make my condoling compliment, for to write it myâˆ£self
to your only mistress is tormenting her now; but pray assure her I
grieve for her loss, and the sense I am sure she has of it, to a degree not

This is to acknowledge the receipt of two of your letters. I would

herself. I do not question but you must guess at the concern my sisters,
&amp;c. were in, when we received the news of your loss; upon my word
I was stupified with it, and cannot still help being anxious about the
brother's health, notwithstanding your assurances of his recovery; for
we have so many cruel reports about him, that it is enough to make
one distracted. Pray assure his afflicted mother of my most humble
duty. God in heaven send her comfort, for she wants it; nothing but
her goodness could resist such a stroke. We are all well and entirely

<P>"If I did not know the King's affairs perfectly well, your fears would
have cast me to the gates of death. No, no. All is as my heart can
wish; and I am not easily content with every little affair concerning him.
Take my word, all is right, and will soon bear. All his friends are
earnest for his changing his lodgings, and rejoice he is to leave France.
I confess it strikes a damp sometimes upon me; but I must submit to his
lawyers, who know best what he is to do. Alas! I was to-day to have
sent him a pacquet from his friend, but he has delayed it till I hear again.
O! what is my dear angel doing at this time? He represents himself alâˆ£ways
to me as my blessed saviour. Men and angels cannot tell the
heart I bear to him. I hope God will pity me, and preserve him.
I know that is all that is wanting, and that you will soon see. I
hope you are to go with him to his new house, and pray God for
it; it will put me out of all my senses, if I do not often hear of you
and from him; and, to be sure, nobody will be so kind and so careful as
I now find you are. I thank you ten thousand times. For God's sake,
continue it to me. Is he not my all on earth? It is like a mill-stone about
my neck to keep me from writing him. If we do not hear any more bad
news, we will write on Friday, and I must beg of you to represent E.
Mâ€”r's faithful duty to him, and tell him, I am sure he would give
500 guineas, at this moment, for a thing he promised: he said it was
both for his own sake and mine, and he does this day pity me at
his heart. I have no eyes in my head, but that which look like red
blood. We parted about an hour ago. He kept the first illness from
me, till I had yours. When I had yours of the 3d, I was for coming to
see him, and roared and cried I would do it; and I told him I would
not desire to stay but four days with him, and I would be back before
his affairs wanted me; but E. Mâ€”r told me, the world could not
save my life, I would die before I was two days journey. I said if I
<PB N="305" REF="320"/>
died coming back I did not care, but I was sure I would not die in the
going; the joy to see my dear angel would support me. All my friends
in general were against it; but it was to E. Mâ€”r I was to submit.
I had interest enough to have come the short way. I trust in God I shall
see him soon, and give me the satisfaction to assure him of my humble
duty, and leave my poor heart with him. I am sorry to trouble you
with so long a letter, but pity my present distraction, and believe, Sir, &amp;c."</P>

you in the happy recovery, as I then thought, of our two friends

knows, has been too well confirmed since, and which made the pen fall

but I do not say this as the opinion of only one physician: the

think themselves infinitely obliged to you for your constant remembrance
of them, and your frequent accounts of late, which honest Mr. Rye
[Edwards] has not failed to communicate to us, in concerns which touch
us so very sensibly, that public affairs have lost their taste; nor indeed, if
I was so disposed, is there much to say. A peace is no ways doubted to
be well advanced; but whether the negociations at Utrecht contribute
much to it, is more than I can say. The house of commons is sumâˆ£moned,
with great solemnity, to meet the first of May our stile; and it
is the general expectation to have a sketch of the peace then laid before

he pleases. We see Kings and princes have their afflictions, as well as
our poor families; and a little time will bring us all together again. I
hope you have seen the gentleman (Mr. Sheridan) I recommended to
you. He is a worthy man; I sent a book or two by him, but have not
<PB N="307" REF="322"/>
heard from him but once, upon his first getting to Amsterdam [St. Gerâˆ£mains],
and he could not then tell me how to direct to him, and he
knew not I had writ to you concerning him, and may neglect going to
you; but if you hear of him at the Exchange or otherwise, pray send for
him, and let him know this, and that his friends are in pain for him, not
hearing from him, nor knowing how to write to him. It was by his
means I recovered two of the books the old woman [Mrs. Traveller]
left behind her, else I had never got one of them. Let him know I writ
to Allen [my lord Middleton] concerning him; inclosed to you, I writ
of others matters, but have had no answer from him since; so he is a
letter in my debt: I pray my hearty service to him and good landlady
[lady Middleton], and tell him, his house at Putney [the peace] is near
finished and will be ready for him; and if he has any further commands
for me, let me know them. You are constantly remembered at the colâˆ£lege,
with sincere respect and kindness. Ned shewed me yours of the
14th; but neither he nor I could make any thing of Alban [church of
England]; so that is to be explained. Is Mr. Emerton [F. Eyre] still
at his house in your town, or gone to Toruine [Liege] where he lived
before? His leaving off trade, at this time, for himself, is of great service
to his master, and I doubt not, he did it very willingly, in which I have
done him justice here; from what I know of him myself, I have really
a great value for him, and would let him know it from myself, if it
would be worth the postage; therefore, pray do it for me. My kind
service to good Mr. Sands [Mr. Stafford], and honest Jackson [Mr.

<P>"LET me see the dear hand of Mr. Kennedy [the King] again. I
sent you one inclosed from E. M. this day fourthnight, and I
<PB N="308" REF="323"/>
writ another myself since, but have had no returns, which makes E. M.
uneasy. He longs for your opinion of the circumstance of your law-suit;
he believes 'tis all for your good and advantage, in all points, and is very
angry with me that I cannot be content; and then he will tell me, if it
were to save Mrs. Ord's [Queen Anne] soul from death, she could not
proceed otherwise, nor faster. Your friends do not know this, and they
come every day with some new story to me. But my joy is, that you are
secure, on all hands, as E. M. tells you in his last. Scotland is always
ready, but I am sure it will be England that will have the first honour;
but all your friends may submit to that, for I am at my old saying,
Welcome Turk, Jew, and Infidel, to help to end that long law-suit;
and I dare say it will end in great joy and friendship.</P>
<P>The parliament is out of town, and will not be in town till Monday;
and, for that reason, E. M. is out of town for a few days; but desired
me, if I had any letter from you, to send an express for him. I need not
tell you how he longs for his present, although he says, he has no doubt
of seeing the original in a short time. I am sure he takes true pains for
it, and this is doing him justice. All your friends and correspondents
may do that piece of right, to own it is he of all the Scots has the best
interest with Q. Anne and E. Oxford; and also he is believed by the
English as a good and great lawyer, and a man of much goodness and
honour. If he was not my kinsman and dear friend, I would say much
more; but that I can justify. His being a faithful attorney to you, is
perfection enough to make him happy in this world and in the next; a
good conscience is the world's ease; and I am sure, 'tis a great ease to
my poor heart, to see the friendship of your creditors increase every day,
and it will bring you with ease to town, when your debts will be comâˆ£pounded,
and I am well informed not to be uneasy at your leaving
France. It is the safest way to bring you to your own; and that you
are not to stay long in any settled place till then, only tour about till
your debts are near paid; and the parting word between E. M. and me,
when he went to his country-house, was to beg me to chear up my spiâˆ£rits,
I should see my best beloved, and that he would then tell all my
faults. So the Almighty God permit it me, is my poor and hearty
prayer. Yours, &amp;c."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"ONE Mr. Rogers [Plunket] being desirous of an accommodation
between Mr. Jenkins [the King] and his sister, in hopes to reconâˆ£cile
them so far, as that she might let him enjoy his pretensions, descended
to him by birthright, laboured to compass to good a work, and in order
thereunto, he provided as follows.</P>
<P>First, by founding Mr. Simson and his associates for several months
together, not perceiving in them a real disposition for an agreement with
Mr. Maine [King of France], with an inclination to do justice to Mr.
<PB N="310" REF="325"/>
Jenkins [the King], with safety to themselves; but the current running
too strong against them, for such an attempt, at that time, they resolved
to take a year or two's time to stem it, though they knew it would reâˆ£dound
to the prejudice of the sister and all her tenants, the said Rogers
[Plunket] conceiving they wanted but a plausible handle to justify such
proceedings, resolved to procure them one if possible.</P>
<P>Accordingly, being intimate as well with Mr. Goodman as with all
those that were entrusted by him, he became master of all their secrets,
and of the methods that were taken to prevent the sister from entering
into any accommodation with Mr. Maine [King of France], in order to do
Mr. Jenkins [the King] justice, and produced the vouchers from time to
time to Mr. Simson, whereof he got as many as were sufficient to justify
the sister's [P. Anne] making a separate agreement with Mr. Maine
[King of France]. Upon which she took courage, and made a firm reâˆ£solution
to treat with him at all hazards; whereupon, Rogers [Plunket]
was pitched upon, as an indifferent man, to deliver a message to Mr.
Maine [the King of France] to that purpose. But, upon second thoughts,
he being found more useful and capable of rendering further service here,
Mr. Simson sent another that was a creature of his own; but, in the
meantime, Mr. Maine [the King of France] sent hither one Mr. Ciprian,
in order to try the sister [princess Anne] and Mr. Simson's pulses, which
Mr. Rogers [Plunket] communicated to Mr. Simson, wherewith he
seemed to be well-pleased, whereby a true understanding was settled beâˆ£tween
them, which has been the foundation of the present agreement
between them.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams's master [prince Eugene's], having a dark notion of the
matters, and conceiving them to be much to his detriment, came hither
by the instigation of the Wylens [Whigs], in order to frustate and renâˆ£der
all abortive, cost what it would; wherein he was so desperate as to
form a design of laying violent hands on the sister, rather than he should
be disappointed of his ends; but Mr. Rogers [Plunket], being vigilant
upon this occasion, found means to discover all his intrigues; and, acâˆ£cordingly,
communicated the same, from time to time, to Mr. Simson
and his associates, which put the sister [princess Anne] upon a resolution
of closing immediately with Mr. Maine [the King of France] and keepâˆ£ing
a good correspondence with him for the future, in order to do Mr.
<PB N="311" REF="326"/>
Jenkins [the King] justice, upon occasion; whereby it is in Mr. Maine's
[King of France's] power to give the rest of his adversaries what terms
he pleases, about which we shall not dispute much with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Rogers [Plunket] desires you would be pleased to meet him at
Rotterdam, where Mrs. White directs her letters: for he has orders from
Mr. Harris [Harley] to set out immediately;</P>

communicate to you, relating to Mr. Jenkins's [the King's] affair. I am
come hither to do him service. His immediate re-establishment depends

think himself in a condition to give what terms he thinks fit to his antaâˆ£gonists,
and establish his affairs for the future. But, as those things
cannot be so well done by writing as by word of mouth, it is fitting Mr.

on Mr. Simson and the rest of his companions and will make them firm
to Mr. Jacob's [the King of France] interest for the future.</P>
<P>I am heartily sorry for the death of Mr. Jenkins's [the King's] sister.
The loss of her, at this time of day, is inconceivable; however, if Mr.

<P>"YOUR last letter has given me a great deal of concern, because I
do believe it had been of great consequence to the cause in Chanâˆ£cery,
that you should have settled the accounts with Mr. Rogers. He
could have told you what the best counsellors had said to him, upon his
laying the merits of the cause before them, Mr. Tom West [lord Mulâˆ£grave]
who is a friend to Mr. Jenkins [the King] told Mr. Roger
[Plunket] that what he had informed him of, would do Mrs. Bess Smith
[England] the greatest service that had been done her ever since the suit
began, (which has been these twenty odd years), and Mrs. Bess Smith
[England] has very nobly rewarded him for that service; for it has disâˆ£covered
<PB N="314" REF="329"/>
covered Mr. Sandys's [Hannover's] practises, and laid them open, which
would have ruined Mrs. Dibby [princess Anne] who abhors him now.
Mr. Rogers [Plunket] did believe, that young man [Mr. Sheridan] was
sent by Mr. Peregrine [Ferguson] to Mr. Jenkins [the King], because
Mr. Peregrine [Ferguson] did acquaint Mr. Tom. West [L. Mul.] of
Mr. Rogers's business, unknown to Mr. Rogers; for he had taken meaâˆ£sures
to have it laid before the friends in Mr. Medlicot's family [the parâˆ£liament];
and the pleading first council [cab. coun.], both at a time,
when he found Mr. Hans [Harley] concealed all from them; but when
Mr. Peregrine [Ferguson] had taken that way, Rogers was satisfied,
though he was not privy to the doing it, for it had the end he wished;
and in a little time it will be laid before Mr. Medlicote himself [the
parliament], though he is very tender in openly exposing Mr.
Sandys [Hannover], because of the tenants love to him yet; but
all the others, that are injointly with him, will be openly exposed,
which will justify Mrs. Bess Smith [England] acting apart from them;
a greater service could not be done to Mr. St. John [the King] than this
has been. Mr. Tom West [lord M.] has been informed, that Mr.
Wealy of the country of Mr. Peregrine [the Scots Whigs] has sent to
Mr. Sandys [Hannover] to assist him against Mr. Carres [Church of Engâˆ£land],
and desired him to come to them; therefore, now Mr. Carres has
no better way, than by Mr. Jenkins [the King] to do himself justice;
and that is what he is resolved on. But the many difficulties he must go
through, is what they are labouring under, because of the jointure Mrs.
Dian Johns [princess Anne] has upon the estate; and after her death
it will be too late, because of the entail that will then take place. Mr.
Peregrine would have had Mr. Rogers to have let him have managed it;
to have a friend of his to have come to him, to settle the accounts, and
said, Mr. James Staff [Mr. Stafford] would, he believed, come himself to
settle the accounts with Mr. Rogers [Plunket]; but he having given
Mrs. White direction to write to you, he would not alter that; so that
he will be disappointed extremely, because, for many reasons, he cannot
do it, by writing at a distance; besides, you may guess how impossible it
is to direct you, by writing all the particulars of what he would let you
understand, for he knows a great deal of the affairs of the entailed
estate. He said, he did not acquaint the young man [Mr. Sheridan] of
<PB N="315" REF="330"/>
any thing, not believing him a proper person; but Mr. Peregrine havâˆ£ing
done that to Mr. Tom West [lord Mulgrave], he believed, by the
young man's going of a sudden then, away he had sent him; but Mr.
Rogers has no patron [cut paper], and cannot get the work done any
other way, effectually; so you will not have the work. I fear he is,
what I told you, expecting Mr. Sam Hamey [Sir William Ellis]; he will
write to him: Mrs. White gave him a direction how to write. He,
poor man, is in danger in that ill air, considering his weakly constiâˆ£tution,
so he will stay as little a time as he can; but he has much to do,
being fully apprized of his business, from the first hands. I believe there
could be nothing of greater use in the cause, than your sending this acâˆ£count
with him; but since that, you say, cannot be done, pray write to
him, and let him know the reason, and tell him how you think it ought
to be done. Direct for Mr. Rogers as you send Mrs. White's, to be deâˆ£livered
to him by Mr. Hacket; so you and he must do it the best way
you can; the term is now, and it will be a great damage to those you value
most, not to know how to instruct the counsel. Your friend Mr. Matâˆ£thews,
tells me, that he has writ to you. He is now in Mr. Medlecot's
family [Scotch parliament], and that more than half of those children,
wish us well, as he does the prosperity of your cousin St. John [the
King]; but they were deceived in this last affair, in relation to Mr. Jenâˆ£kins
[the King] by Mr. Hans [Mr. Harley], and hate him heartily for it;
But you know, they must take no notice of it, but are resolved to make
what reparation they can, and as soon as they can do it. Mr. Peregrine
is ordered to receive 100 <HI>l.</HI> for laying the business of Mr. Rogers before
the lawyers [cabinet council]. Mr. Tom West [duke of Buckingham]
has got it done, on that account, by Mrs. Debby's [princess Anne's] direcâˆ£tions.
I have not seen him a great while, he and I being long sick."</P>

<P>"I Don't imagine I shall be able to leave London as soon as I proposed.
The Whigs continue always to sow the feeds of division, by formâˆ£ing
new projects for destroying entirely, if possible, the party now in
power, and they flatter themselves much, to accomplish this the more
easily, that the treasurer, who is at the head of it, is universally hated,
that is to say, by both parties; consequently, no one will regret him.
It is for this reason they urge me to stay for some time longer, in order
to see what their projects will come to. I shewed them again, that they
would have the same success with the former, and that my stay would be
of no advantage to them, as my presence serves only to four the minds of
the ministry; and, in order to disengage myself the more from them,
I communicated to them the sentiments of the Grand Pensionary, upon
the clause which I sent to you, in my dispatches of the 25th and 29th of
January. They answered me abruptly; and among the rest, the Duke
<PB N="319" REF="334"/>
of Marlborough, that the grand Pensionary had changed his sentiments
very soon, since he began to be apprehensive of disobliging a handful of
factious members in the house of commons, and to be afraid of a ministry
who are pensioners of France, and consequently enemies to the common
cause, and will continue so as long as they subsist. It seems to me, that
the States have already forgot, that they formerly resisted France and
England at once; and if I am not mistaken, they will find themselves
soon in the same necessity. <Q REND="inline">"Yes," says baron Bothmar, "of sending
thither the prince of Hannover, as they sent the prince of Orange, to deâˆ£liver
the nation and to prevent the ruin of the common cause."</Q></P>
<P>They urged me instantly to send you the following particulars to be
added to those, which I sent you in my dispatches of 25 and 29 of Jaâˆ£nuary,
and to make up a memorial of them, to be printed there first, as it
might then be printed here without any suspicion.</P>
<P>The Queen of England upon her accession to the crown, declared
the following particulars.</P>
<P>That trade being the support of the nation, and she having religion
so much at heart, had made no difficulty of engaging in this war,
though the nation was then in debt, being well convinced, that she could
not be secure upon the throne, while Spain was in the possession of the
house of Bourbon; and she had engaged herself deeper in this war than
she had at first proposed, to the great detriment of her kingdoms.</P>
<P>But the measures of the present ministry sufficiently shew, that they
were not hearty in the cause from the beginning, and that the most disâˆ£cerning
see very well, that every thing tends to a separate peace, and to
pave the way more easily for her brother. I told them, that appeared
very probable; but that the Pensionary would start the same objections,
as baron Bothmar did not think proper to undertake such a delicate affair
without communicating it to his master; and that it is now too late to
produce any great effect, as the people in England were already biassed
by the resolutions of the house of commons; but the junto made the
following answer: <Q REND="inline">"by this method of proceeding, we shall never sucâˆ£ceed,
for you made the same objection to the loans which we had proâˆ£posed
from the bank and from rich merchants, by engaging the revenue
of the kingdom of Hungary, and other hereditary dominions; and by
that means, the Emperor would find himself in a condition, jointly
<PB N="320" REF="335"/>
with the States-general, of besieging a town, and at the same time, taking
the field, by which, of consequence, he would put an end to the cessation
of arms, and infallibly break up the conferences at Utrecht, and dispose
the people to believe all the projects that might be formed. I imagine
we have still time enough to insert this in the memorial."</Q></P>
<P>I answered them, that we were foolishly employed in building the
tower of Babel, for there are not three among you or us of the same
sentiment. Sometimes you would choose to have the prince of Hannoâˆ£ver,
and sometimes you would not; and I see that the greatest number of
you are for an aristocracy; and what vexes me most is, that you have
obliged the Emperor to make demands, from the greatest part of which
he will be obliged to desist."</P>

<P>"Since my last to you I had two letters from London, wherein I am
desired not to stir from hence till orders from Mr. Han [Harley];
and if I can send over the fellow, and not to appear in that matter myâˆ£self,
for weighty reasons, which I shall know hereafter. The English of
this I take to be, that they are for having that man over, in order to
stop his mouth, or lay him aside, so that he can do no service to Mr.
Jenkins [the King]. By the last letter I am desired to tell my friend,
the resident for the Emperor, that the English court is willing to make
up the breaches and keep a good correspondence for the future, proâˆ£vided
they come into the present ministry's measures: this I communiâˆ£cated
to the said resident this morning, who seemed well pleased with it.
How far this will be conducive to Mr. Jenkins [the King's] interest, or
Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] affairs, I leave you to judge. We shall
now think of the properest method to bring this thing to bear. If Mr.
Jacob's [the King of France's] manager thinks this accommodation will
affect: his master's interest, let him speak to me in time. I believe it will
do good to Mr. Jenkins [the King], seeing die Emperor seems satisfied as

things stand now. He should have his own; but if he thinks this acâˆ£commodation
will in the least prejudice him, it shall go no further. I
had no more papers come. I sent again this post for them. I am, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shan't send the fellow to London, but rather dispose him to come
into our interest, and, by this means, keep Harris [Harley] in awe, and
make him more pliable; for he knows none can do him more harm, at

laughed at, that should undertake to demonstrate that two and two make
four; and, in doubtful cases, it is sufficient to prove the fact, and learnâˆ£ed
men must decide.</P>
<P>"What is more evident than that Crassus [Hannover], with the Pedâˆ£lars
[the Dutch] and the Tartars [Whigs], have declared against Thoâˆ£mas
[Queen Anne] and his lawyers [ministry], and that there is no means
to ward that blow but by doing justice to Richard [Pretender]? One
must want both sense and manners to mistrust such eminent persons; and
it would be as absurd to instruct them in the ways and means of managâˆ£ing
a matter so necessary for their own security, and the advantage of
their pupil Canaan. As for instance, would it not be a strange presumpâˆ£tion
to tell them that delays are dangerous, that if Thomas [Queen
Anne] should die, whom God preserve, Crassus [Hannover] must cerâˆ£tainly
get possession, because the decrees made in his favour, though unâˆ£just,
could never in that case be reversed? That Richard is a person of
too much spirit to submit, but would immediately appear armed, with
equity, and supported by many good friends and relations, to assert his
right; so that the estate in debate would be utterly ruined, and the preâˆ£sent
lawyers [ministry] could not escape the rage of Tartars [Whigs];
and that though Croesus's [Marlborough's] case be not so desperate, yet it
cannot be doubted but he wishes he had made better use of his time.</P>
<P>That the surest way to prevent these miseries, is for Thomas [Queen]
to send a letter of attorney [treaty] to his brother Richard [Pretender];
and when that is signed, to call him home immediately, when the troops
[parliament] are dispersed in their respective quarters: that this merry
meeting must be at Sir Roger's [London], to make it more solemn and
secure, by surprising the Tartars [Whigs] in their head quarters, by a good
guard of Janisaries [Tories]: that those who never had a good
thought of Richard [Pretender] would crowd to embrace him, and tell
him, as they did his uncle, that it is the happy day they all wished for:
<PB N="324" REF="339"/>
that when the troops [parliament] were assembled, and the brothers
should appear together, they, no doubt, would not only applaud what
had been done, but would make a secure title to the estate: that it would
be dangerous to begin with the troops; for, besides the case of mortality
already mentioned, they are fickle and humoursome; and even the Jaâˆ£nisaries
themselves are jealous of one another.</P>
<P>That there is more prudence, and as much courage shown in preventâˆ£ing
danger, than by running into it: many great occasions have been
lost by too much caution; whereas, by stealing a march the secret is
kept, and the enemy found unprepared: that for that end and purpose,
Richard [Pretender] should be as advantageously posted as can be, to
prevent Crassus [Hannover] in case of the worst.</P>
<P>These considerations, and many more, would be supersluous to be
offered to such vigilant, clear-sighted lawyers, which is the beginning
and end of this scrible."</P>

this time, to give any jealousy to Young [Princess Anne] or Baker
[Harley]: that the journey was not fixed yet, neither as to the day nor
place: that what he advised of the duke of Lorrain making difficulty,
was probable enough: that it were to be wished Young and Baker
would consider well the danger of distance and delay; and that they
would lose no time to shorten Goodall's [the King's] travels, and hasten
to secure his marriage, for fear of accidents: and that young Sparrow
was not named to go; but that he, and all others, had leave to follow

corrupt. I was sorry to find, by yours of the 19th, to Moncrief, that
the King was kept so much in the dark; for, though we are so here, I
did not doubt but Queen Anne had explained matters fully, with relation
to the King of England, to the King of France, and he to his Britannic

I asked one from Lesly, who gave it, but I durst not use it hereâˆ£after,

more to try if it comes safe, than any thing else: opposite to 113 set

<P>If 231 is not, I am indifferent to other things: compliments are not
necessary, where deeds shall give conviction of fidelity. If the King of
France remembers 33, he will not refuse the duke of Hamilton; and he
hopes that the King of England will interest himself for him, and the
Queen likewise. The duke of Hamilton has been much pressed to go
ambassador to Vienna; but lately insinuations have been made to him,
as if they would send him to Philip after the peace; but he did not choose
to engage himself in any thing, until he knew the King's sentiments upon
it; he will do in that what he thinks fit.</P>
<P>The present situation of affairs gives more hopes than any particular
man can tell you. But if the King will let the duke of Hamilton know
with whom he may communicate himself here, he will speak without
reserve to them. Place Richard Hamilton opposite to 129, or Husie.

defect of your coming to me. You will be pleased to desire him not to
give himself the trouble, for I communicated all to one of the gentleâˆ£men

friends at Utrecht, seemed well pleased with the account I gave them of
things. They thanked me; but I told them they should thank Mr.
Jenkins [the King], and that what was done is owing to him; and if
Mr. Jacob [King of France] gives but a helping hand, he may be soon

<P>"I Have considered very seriously the subject of your last letter, and
the more I reflect upon it, the more diffident I find myself; not
only from the importance of the subject itself, so nearly concerning the
welfare of my nephew [the King's affairs], for which I have the tenderest
<PB N="328" REF="343"/>
concern,<MILESTONE N="July." UNIT="month"/> as I truly love him, and design him my heir, notwithstanding
the difference of religion; but also from the great difficulty of giving an
opinion, where I do not well understand the law. Yet, that I may
leave nothing undone, I must say it is my opinion, that the chief matter
is to regain my brother's [princess Anne's] good liking. I shall, thereâˆ£fore,
mention such steps as I think Harry [the King] may best take to
please his uncle [princess Anne], and, at the same time, get the good will
of the old servants and tenants, who I find in general much better
inclined to Harry [the King] than to his cousin [Hannover]. You
know the first dislike my brother [princess Anne] took, was upon Harry's
[the King's] changing his religion; though, as I have often told him, it
was no more than he might expect from the manner of sending him abroad;
for I did not think so very young a man, indeed you know he was a very
boy when he went, should be trusted altogether to his own conduct, and the
event hath shewn my fears were not in vain. Yet my brother [princess
Anne] will not so much as own any imprudence, far less any fault, as I
think it, in this management; and whenever I touch upon this string, I
can very seldom get any other answer, than, <Q REND="inline">"You see he doth not make
the least step to oblige me. I have no reason to think he values me or my
estate, and therefore I am resolved to give it to Dick [Hannover]."</Q> Once,
indeed, I was observing to him, that my cousin Richard [Hannover] freâˆ£quently
abused his best servants; that he often shewed very little respect
for himself; that he seemed to me, by his behaviour, to think it not
in his power to alter the will he had made; and that, underhand, he
gave him all the obstructions he could in the management of his estate,
for no other reason, that I could see, but because he could not put what
servants he had a mind about him; that, for my part, I should not think
it safe to have servants near me recommended by a person of Dick's
[Hannover's] temper; and that Harry [the King] never offered anything
like this. I am sensible this made a very great impression on my brother
[princess Anne]; for he replied very hastily, <Q REND="inline">"What wouldst have
me do, Jack [lord Mulgrave]; you know, as the law stands, a Papist
cannot inherit; and, therefore, should I alter my will, it would be to no
purpose, the law would give it all to Dick [Hannovr], and therefore I
had better do that with a good grace, that I cannot help."</Q> I told him
then, I believed Dick [Hannover] himself was no better than a Papist:
<PB N="329" REF="344"/>
that I had good grounds to suspect him, for I never saw him at church
in my life, nor did I ever hear he went thither; and certainly a Papist
was better than one of no religion at all. I then said, that I had been
told, that, by deeds of trust, and by other devices, the lawyers often
found means to evade the act of parliament; and I do not doubt, but if
he would give good fees and good encouragement, the law would speak
whatever he would have it: that the lawyers never suffered an act
to be made without a loop-hole to creep out at, and I believed it was
so in this case. Besides, brother, said I, you know Dick hath not the
reputation of being the best husband in the world: but, added I then,
this his wife's behaviour too well excuseth; yet, at the same time, give
me leave to tell you, brother, this doth not so much commend your setâˆ£tlement,
since it is plain you have no certainty that Dick's children
are his own. This made him very uneasy, and he said upon it, <Q REND="inline">"you
must not believe all that is reported upon that subject. However, be
that as it may, I do not see how I can undo, what I myself have done,
and done in such a manner: Harry [the King] may thank himself for it.
He knows I always loved him better than Dick [Hannover]."</Q> I could
not think it proper to press further at this time, but rather chose to leave
him to his own reflections on what had passed, and, in the mean time, I
will consult some good lawyers what can best be done in such a case. I
am convinced, that if Harry [the King] would return to the church of
England, all would be easy; nay, for what I know, if he would but
barely give hopes he would do so, my brother [princess Anne] would do
all he can to leave him his estate. I am satisfied he hates Dick [Hanâˆ£nover],
and loves Harry [the King] now rather better than ever.</P>
<P>I was in the country about a month since, and could not but be pleased
to see how almost all the tenants caressed me; on my conscience, it was
for Harry's [the King's] sake, whose part they know I always take. Old
Tom Simmonds [lord Mulgrave] told me a thousand stories of Dick
[Hannover], and swore when his lease was up, that he would not renew
again, if Dick [Hannover] had the estate. Ah! Master, said he, if
Master Harry [the King] was not a Papist, we would soon give Mr.
Richard [Hannover] his belly-full of law; we would all turn tenants to
Mr. Harry [the King], and see whether Mr. Richard's [Hannover's] anâˆ£nuities
would hold out against such an estate; i'faith he should have
<PB N="330" REF="345"/>
enough of law before he should set a foot here. You certainly remember
old Tom [lord Mulgrave]; he is worth, at least, 5000<HI>l.</HI> which he hath
got by his own industry; and I verily believe he speaks the hearts and
minds of his fellows.</P>
<P>By what is above, you will pretty plainly perceive my [lord Mulgrave's]
opinion, and I would have Harry [the King] remember he is not the
first of his family who have thought a good estate worth changing an opiâˆ£nion
for, and ten thousand pounds a year is a pretty thing for a young
fellow to play withal; but if his scruples are so very strong, that he canâˆ£not
go this length, let him endeavour to try to make his uncle [princess
Anne] believe, at least, that he is in himself desirous to come back,
but is ashamed, left the world should think he changes his religion for an
estate, which he will hardly get quietly, if at all, without it. Pray tell
him this in the strongest terms, and that I myself [lord Mulgrave],
though my fondness makes me overlook it, would be very glad that he
was of my opinion; much more, he may well think, is expected by my
brother [princess Anne], who is, and ever was, very obstinate in all his
opinions: if, therefore, Harry [the King] can prevail upon himself to do
as much on his side as I will do on mine, I by no means despair of perâˆ£suading
my brother [princess Anne] to consent to let him go live on the
estate in Yorkshire [Scotland] where he hath most friends; and when he
is once there, the rest will surely follow at my brother's [princess Anne's]
death, who I must tell you by the bye, notwithstanding his care to hide
it, I can perceive to be so infirm, that it well behoves Harry [the King] to
be speedy in his resolutions, left Dick [Hannover] should, in that case,
get into possession before him, which, by the help of God, he shall never
do, at least without a law-suit; but then Harry [the King] must join,
or nothing effectual can be hoped for. Pray give him my kind love, and
desire him carefully to consider his old uncle's advice, and to take this with
him, that I find he can hardly depend upon the tenants assistance, whilst
he continues the opinion he is of; and that whoever tells him the conâˆ£trary,
deceives him; my assistance and firm friendship he may be most sure
of at all events, and in all circumstances. Tell him likewise, and I have
pretty good means to know it, that my brother [princess Anne] and his
best servants are now so angry at Dick's [Hannover's] late insolence, that
if Harry [the King] will but put it in their power to help him, they will
<PB N="331" REF="346"/>
do all they can for him; and I do not know but my brother [princess
Anne] may go so far as try his interest to get an act of parliament to
settle the estate on him, which, in my conscience, he hath friends enow to
obtain, if he will go heartily about it. Adieu. Love me as I do you."</P>

<P>"IT is some time since one Plumtree, an attorney of this town, inâˆ£formed
you that he had put into my hands some papers which might,
hereafter, prove of the greatest consequence to Mr. Knox [the King] and
Mr. Kennedy [King of France]. Having myself lately been obliged to
<PB N="332" REF="347"/>
make a journey into the North, I had put these papers into the custody
of a friend, who being himself absent at my return, I could not get
them back till lately. After looking them over, as attentively as I could,
I cannot see how they can be of any great use hereafter, unless it be as
a proof of the zeal and industry of the person who collected them, and
who, as far as I can judge, had chiefly in view the service and advanâˆ£tage
of Mr. Kirkton [the King]. That gentleman can best tell how far
his interests are linked with that of Mr. Putney's [the peace]; but it canâˆ£not
be doubted but the latter has been much forwarded in his affairs
by the light those papers have given Henderson [Harley], who thereby
discovered the knavery of Edward [Emperor], and his ingratitude to
Quanton [Queen Anne] and Eden [England], and his close union with
Wishart [the Whigs]. This, Sir, is all that I can say at this distance;
but I shall take particular care to preserve the premises till we meet, as
I hope we one day shall, I suppose you expect that every letter from
hence should bring you a great deal of news; but instead of that, I can
only tell you that our affairs are managed with greater secrecy than ever,
which I think is one important proof that the changes made some time
since, have been for the better; and I believe we shall be daily more and
more convinced of this: for though the Whigs talk big, they lose
ground visibly, and the calumnies which they continually throw on the
Queen and ministry, with the utmost efforts of malice and impudence,
have little effect on the body of the people, who heartily long for peace
and Dunkirk, which we hope is, as this day, in English hands. The
Whigs do all they can to possess the people with a notion that there are
evil designs on foot against the succession; and they are even malicious
enough to give out, that Scotland is, by the peace, to be yielded to the
Chevalier de St. George; but there is nobody simple enough to give ear
to such suggestions. All friends here are well, except Rowley [Rivers],
who is dying, and poor Sanders [lord Somers] who cannot live long,
and is already dead in effect, to the great grief of Harry [Hannover]
who depends more on him than on any one friend besides. I hope, Sir,
you will do me the justice to believe that I am, with the greatest respect
and sincerity, Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"THE thoughts I had of changing place are now over, at least for
some time; the present world is in so troubled a posture, one
would be glad to see it settle a little. In the mean time I will give you
the best account I am able of our private affairs: poor Mr. Matthew
Turner [the low-church] and partners are upon their last legs; and if,
in two or three months, they are not able to give some new turn to their
business, which must be by some notable trick of youth [rebellion], their
great dealing will dwindle to nothing, and their name be almost forgot
upon the Change. To do them right they are not idle; and yet I hardly
think they will make any great venture; or if they should, I hope we may
be able to turn it to some profit in our way; for, indeed, the struggles and
endeavours they and Mr. Diederick Gould [Hannover] have hitherto made,
have been very useful to us, and brought our business into credit; so
that I have often thought we have as good service from those that do not
love us, as even our best friends. What business Mr. Stephen Cosen
[Mr. Thomas Harley] may be employed in to Mr. Diederick [Hannover]
I cannot say; but I am very much mistaken if it be at all complied with,
be it what it will, such is that gentleman's temper and present humour.
You will wonder when I tell you, that Mynheer Klaas [the King of France]
begins to come into good business, and to be mentioned in the city, as a
<PB N="334" REF="349"/>
very honest man, and a fair dealer. The giving up his interest in Mr.
Barty's house [Dunkirk] to accommodate his friends Mr. Ezekiel White
and partner [the high-church party] has given him great reputation, and
will so establish his trade here, that our old correspondents [the Dutch
and the rest of the allies], will either be obliged to come into it, or we
shall leave them to themselves, if not worse. I must not forget to acâˆ£quaint
you how great satisfaction Mr. Kreely's [King of England] maâˆ£nagement,
of late, has given here: friends and foes all speak of it, tho
to different purposes; the event, however, is infinitely to his service.
Thomas Harrison [lord Somers] and Mr. Noy [lord Rivers] are both
dangerously ill, and their recovery much doubted; but though these
gentlemen were considerable in their way, yet I shall be much less conâˆ£cerned
for what becomes of them, than I am for the death of honest Mr.
Nicho's wife [captain David Floyd]: her distemper was the jaundice, to
which she had been subject several years; but it increasing of late upon
her, she went down to the Bath, where she died the second of this month,
O. S. and was buried there the 4th. I tell you these circumstances for
the sake of their young relation with you, who it is fit should be acâˆ£quainted
with it; but the manner of doing it I leave to your prudence
and good nature. Certain it is, she was a most excellent woman; and
applied herself to every relation, and in every circumstance of life, with
a cheerfulness and conduct which I know not where to equal amongst all
my acquaintance. You will please to give my hearty service to the
young gentleman, and tell him the rest of his friends are well, though in
great grief, as is very just. I am, Sir, to you and the whole family, a most
sincere and humble servant,</P>

<P>"I Wrote you three letters by Desborde's address; and having had no
answer, I am afraid they did not come to hand. I send this by the
way of Rotterdam, to let you know that young Ciprian is still at the
Hague, and don't come near me, but gives out he is come on purpose to
speak to me. I did let him know the ill consequence of his staying at
the Hague, and of his idle talk at this time. Pray send to him to go
back from whence he came, and by no means let him go for England;
you cannot imagine what prejudice it may be to Mr. Jenkins' [the King's]
affairs: he is not in the least fit for business, and especially of moment;
he is known to be such in London. Henceforward you will see the effect
of our labour these two years past; and it will be found in a little time,
that we laid a good foundation to bring home Mr. Jenkins [the King].
If you would but recover the papers I sent, you could easily guess how
matters may go in time. Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] friends proâˆ£mised
to let me know, in a little time, whether they fell into their friends
hands in that country. It appears, by their discourse, they did fall into
their hands. The Whigs in England lose ground every day; and to reâˆ£gain
it, they openly give out, they will make such another attempt as
the Tories did in 88. Their friends in this country will give them all the
assistance they can; the rather, because they seem well assured the fleet
and the army are not well-affected to the Queen and present ministry;
and consequently will side with that of Marlborough and the Whigs on
this occasion. This is what hinders the Dutch and the allies from comâˆ£ing
into the peace.</P>
<P>The Tories laugh at what they can do or say, and say they do not vaâˆ£lue
the Dutch nor the rest of the confederates. How these great feuds
and animosities will end, time will shew. Mr. Jenkins' [the King's]
friends are for having him declare himself of your stamp, that they may
have a handle to declare for him, and exclude his competitor or rival.
I send two letters to my lady Litcot by Mr. Jacobs' friends [King of

<P>"I Was in hopes that the interest you had with Tom's lawyers [princess

the match proposed, for the only person who can dispose of the party. Mrs.
Overbury, [Duke of Ormond] by name, is utterly unknown to us; nor had
we ever any correspondence with her; and as to her inclinations, that is
what we desire to know. The world, judging by interest, think she ought
to be favourable, and rather marry her niece, where she may procure great
advantages to herself, than to a malicious, covetous fellow, who will
make her account for the last farthing that she has received during her
guardianship; and this was the drift of the former scribble, to which I
shall add nothing."</P>

<P>It is evident the court of St. Germains were of opinion, that Marlboâˆ£rough,
if he had continued in power, would at length serve them.
Middleton, having furnished his correspondent in this letter with reasons
for convincing the ministry of the dangers of delay, concludes with these
words: <Q REND="inline">"The greatest should take example by Croesus [Marlborough],

date to Mrs. Watson: that Paterson was unjust to think that Jeny [the King],
or any about her, had not the discretion to keep their own secret; and that
he might assure him, nothing of what Morley had writ here from Paterson
could ever come out; but if people would have groundless fears and jeaâˆ£lousies,
there was no help for it: that Jonathan [the King] was not yet
gone to the waters; that he was very well, and had no need of them;

the court of Chancery seems to be in, to reverse the decree in faâˆ£vour
of Mr. Harper [Hannover], and to leave the equity of the redempâˆ£tion
of the estate in question in Mr. Aylmer's [probably Queen Anne]
disposal and nomination; and that Hampton will (as your informer
thinks) be easily inclined to give his consent to such a decree, but proâˆ£bably
with a limitation excluding all the family of the Cottons [Roman

<P>Mr. Goodall [the King] thanks you for the notice you give him of
this matter, and bids me tell you, that it will still be a great step gained,
to have Harper's [Hannover's] decree reversed, and the nomination left
in Aylmer: for though Plessington [the King] will never comply with
the limitation above mentioned, yet when a rich and numerous family are

he is a tall proper well shaped young gentleman, that he has an air of

can never venture their stock upon a safer bottom in all respects; and
the sooner they set her to sea immediately after the peace, the better. I

good intentions some persons may have for him. That all depended on
Harley, who being a dark man, nobody knew well what to reckon upon,

<P>"AN accident hath some time confined me at home; but, I thank
God, I am now well. I could not write sooner, having always
carried my letters to the post myself. There is little news here: all
friends [princess Anne] are well; and, as far as I can judge, my cousin's

tedious. Pray send me a large cypher, part words, part figures, and then
I shall sometimes be more plain. Adieu. Love me as I do you.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="356"/>
I wish you could get me a copy of a treaty made in 1677 or 78, beâˆ£tween
England and Holland, by the then duke of Ormond and the prince
of Orange. I believe a friend of yours or Mat. [L. Midd] hath it."</P>

<P><HI>Nairne to Berry.</HI>â€”December 31st.â€”"I am sorry Edward's [England's]
chief trustees who do not pass for persons very fond of Ross [religion]
upon other occasions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Paâˆ£pers, vol. ix. 4to. p. 47.</NOTE> should be so very nice upon his account with so
honest and so fair a dealer as Plessington [the King], who will give them
all the strongest assurances their hearts can desire, that his inseparable
partner Cotton [Catholic] shall never molest their friend Ross [religion];
but, on the contrary, that he will be a truer friend to all Edward's [Engâˆ£land]
family, but most especially to Cary [church of England] than ever
Harper [Hannover] can be. It is natural enough for Cary [church of
England], to wish Plessington [the King] would marry in his family; but
it can never be thought reasonable or friendly to press him to that marâˆ£riage.
For any thing of that nature, that is either done or may seem to
be done by force or interest, can never have that good effect that is proâˆ£posed
of mutual union and confidence; and, therefore, I can hardly
believe that any that wish Plessington truly well, will ever press him eiâˆ£ther
upon marriage, or upon parting with his friend Cotton [Catholic R.],
who is so harmless a creature that he has neither power nor intention to
disturb in the least any of Cary's family [church of England]; for, if
Plessington should comply with any such proposal at this juncture of
time, it would only serve to lessen his credit, even with those that
require it of him; for, if they will not trust his word now, when they
see nothing but firmness, integrity, honour, and sincerity in him, they'll
certainly have much less reason to trust him, when they see him turn
away so slightly, a poor friend that he has been bred up with, for they'll
either think he is very weak or very insincere, and in either of these
cases, they'll have reason not only to distrust him, more than they do
now, but even to despise him. But I hope Young [princess Anne], and
Baker [Harley], and Price [the parliament] (if they have any good inâˆ£tentions
towards their relation) will find a way to make both themselves
and him happy, without being uneasy to him upon this nice point."</P>

<HEAD>1712.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1712" UNIT="year"/> THE embassy of the earl of Rivers made little impression on the
court of Hannover. The Elector sent back a written answer by
him, and authorized his own minister, the baron de Bothmar, who had
come over with the duke of Marlborough, on the 18th of November
1711, to deliver a long memorial to the ministry. It was published in
the Daily Courant of the 5th of December, and gave great satisfaction
to the Whigs, but very great offence to the Tories; and the ministry
charged Bothmar with espousing a party, and intermeddling very unseaâˆ£sonably
in the affairs of Britain. Dr. Swift throws some light on this
subject, in his History of the four last years of Queen Anne.</P>
<P><Q>"It was the misfortune of his Electoral Highness," says their confiâˆ£dent
and advocate, "to be very ill served, by Mons. Bothmar, his envoy
here; who assisted at all the factious meetings of the discontented party,
and deceived his master, by a false representation of the kingdom, drawn
from the opinion of those, to whom he confined his conversation. There
was likewise at the Elector's court a little Frenchman, without merit or
consequence, called Robithan; who, by the assistance and encouragement
of the last ministry, had insinuated himself into some degree of that
prince's favour, which he used in giving his master the worst impressions
he was able of those whom the Queen employed in her service, insinuatâˆ£ing
that the present ministers were not in the interest of his Highness's
family; that their views were towards the Pretender; that they were
making an insecure and dishonourable peace; that the weight of the
nation was against them; and that it was impossible for them to preserve,
much longer, their credit or power."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="358"/>
It is certain, the Elector, who had hitherto affected to be a friend to
both sides, or, at least, to be attached to neither of the parties which diâˆ£vided
the nation, discovered different sentiments this year, and might be
considered as at the head of one of them. The ministry sent over in the
beginning of the year Mr. Thomas Harley, a cousin of the earl of Oxford,
accompanied by Mr. St. John, brother to the secretary, in order to remove
whatever prejudices might have been infused into his Highness against
their proceedings, and to persuade him to come into their measures. Mr.
Harley staid long in Holland, and did not arrive in Hannover until the
12th of July.</P>
<P>The Queen, in her speech to both houses on the 6th of June, expressed
herself in this manner: <Q REND="inline">"The assuring the protestant succession, as by
law established, in the house of Hannover, to these kingdoms, being
what I have nearest at heart, particular care is taken, not only to have
that acknowledged, in the strongest terms; but to have an additional seâˆ£curity,
by the removal of that person out of the dominions of France,
who has pretended to disturb this settlement."</Q></P>
<P>But neither Mr. Thomas Harley's declarations and remonstrances to the
Elector, nor the Queen's assurances to her parliament, nor the professions
of attachment contained in the prime minister's letters, could reconcile his
Highness to the measures which were pursued in Britain; or persuade
him, that the ministry were well affected to the succession in his family.
He was particularly alarmed, by a resolution of the commons against the
Barrier treaty; whereby they declare, that, under pretext of securing the
protestant succession to the crown, and a barrier to the States, many articles
had been inserted, in the treaty, destructive to the commerce of
Great Britain, and dishonourable to her Majesty. When Mr. Hampden
moved, that an address should be presented to the Queen, that she would
be pleased to give particular instructions to her plenipotentiaries, that,
in the conclusion of the treaty of peace, the several powers, in alliance
with her Majesty, might be guarantees to the protestant succession to the
crown of these realms, as settled by act of parliament, in the illustrious
house of Hannover, the house rejected his motion; and resolved, that
they had such an entire confidence in the repeated declarations her Maâˆ£jesty
had been pleased to make, of her concern for assuring to these
kingdoms the protestant succession, as by law established, that they could
<PB N="344" REF="359"/>
never doubt her taking the proper measures for the security thereof.<MILESTONE N="January." UNIT="month"/> This
resolution of the commons increased the Elector's suspicions of the miâˆ£nistry.</P>
<P>The baron de Bothmar had returned to be the Elector's envoy in Holâˆ£land,
and his plenipotentiary at the treaty now negociating at Utrecht.
The baron de Grote was sent in November to be his envoy extraordinary
in Great Britain. Bothmar, Grote, and Bernsdorff, president of the
council, and Monsieur de Robethon, secretary for the embassies, being
privy counsellors to the Elector, give one another, in their letters, the
title of Excellency.</P>

<P>"I Have, from post to post, put off writing to your Royal Highness;
still hoping for something agreeable to fill my letter, and make it
worth your reading. At last, I imagined the opening of the parliament
would have furnished me with something I might have enlarged upon;
but the violence of their proceedings, on one side and t'other, makes a
man, as your Royal Highness knows me to be, not partial of either
party, not well know what to write, especially since they write me from
London, that Mons. Bothmar has now declared himself of the Whig-party;
so that my finding fault on that side, would be opposing the sentiments
of your court; and when one has not the liberty to find fault on both
sides, when they give occasion, one can't, with half the pleasure, turn
one's pen, when it is confined only against one side. One is not at liberâˆ£ty,
they tell me now, to remember the villany of a party, who cut off your
royal ancestor's head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His lordship, though a master of diction, was but an ordinary genealogist. Charles I. was Sophia's uncle and not her ancestor.</NOTE> nor to remember, amongst others, their actions,
that, when they were in power, they acted contrary to your illustrious
house; and when the heads of them were pressed, by well-wishers to it,
to settle some distinguishing allowance on your next successor, they reâˆ£jected
it, with an insolence unbecoming them; nor when it was thought
<PB N="345" REF="360"/>
by an act, they should have made provision for their speedy coming after
the demise of the Queen, they found out, on the contrary, an expedient
to lay the foundation of a republic, by investing, by act of parliament, the
sovereign power in certain places of which they were themselves masters,
and by their behaviour thought to have kept for life; all this instead of
making it high-treason for any one to do any act of sovereignty between
the demise of the Queen and the coming over of the successor, as was
proposed by some of the Tory party, who, to my knowledge, and as I'm
an honest man and a Christian, designed to have voted an allowance fit
for the present maintainance of a successor, and told me when I was in
England, they were sure of the Queen's consent. I believe I mentioned
this before to you; but matters are since changed. I cannot tell what to
say. Is it permitted me, Madam, to remind your Royal Highnes of the
discourse I have formerly had the honour to have with you on this subâˆ£ject,
when you used to blame extremely the conduct of poor Mons.
Shuts, for declaring so violently of one party? Did your Royal Highâˆ£nes
not use to tell me, that a prince should strive to be a prince of his
people, and not by espousing a faction give distaste to two thirds of his
subjects; especially a successor, who is called in to the succession, by both
parties, whose succession both parties were to maintain, and whose sucâˆ£cession
always meets with the greatest opposition from those who have
now the folly to range themselves on t'other side? You were pleased,
Madam, sometimes, to tell me, that you saw the nation established in
the protestant succession for the good of itself and posterity, and not out
of affection to your persons, who the greatest part of the nation knew
not; that you were sure that very reason alone would support your sucâˆ£cession,
and to meddle in intrigues and parties could only create personal
and party distaste, and make opposition to your succession, which else could
never happen, as long as the reason and motive, which induced the nation to
settle the succession on your family, subsisted. But I hope these idle stoâˆ£ries,
the public hear of Bothmar's siding with the faction, are false like
many others; for I know inpartiality temper is the character of the Elecâˆ£tor;
and I must do Mons. Bothmar that justice, that here I found him
extremely impartial and temporate. I knew upon the first bringing
over the general points, he objected the words The Protestant, had
been better than The Present Establishment. I told him, that certainly
<PB N="346" REF="361"/>
the last expression was the same as the first; for the present establishment
of the succession was that in the Elector's family. I told him, I believed
they didn't just hold to the old beaten words, being they would have
these preliminaries appear entirely general, in every point, that none
could take it amiss, and that it might not appear as restrained as the forâˆ£mer
were; and, therefore, they avoided the same words. That, if he
had nothing else to assure him of the sincerity of the intentions of the
ministry in favour of the protestant succession, though all their lives and
actions have shewn, that is their first principle, yet they would not have
chosen the bishop and me, being they knew both our principles, and
that we had both the honour to be perfectly known to your court, espeâˆ£cially
myself. Bothmar seemed satisfied with the discourse and assurances
he had from me, whilst I had the honour of seeing him alone; though,
after the duke of Marlborough came hither, he was so often taken up in
his Grace's company, I had not the same opportunity of conversing with
him, which I was sorry for, being Mons. Bothmar is one I had always a
perfect esteem for; and should have been glad of his assistance to have
advanced in my negociations the interest of your most illustrious family."</P>

<P>"I Have no reason to complain of your silence, since you have been
pleased to make amends, by the long obliging letter, which I have
so much pleasure in reading; although I was very much surprised, that
you say to me, that they have written to you from London, that Mr.
Bothmar has declared for the Whigs. But, as you say, towards the end
of your letter, that the rumour may be false, I shall have no difficulty
to convince you, that it is; and you will see, by the memorial, which he
has given on the part of the Elector, that neither Whigs nor Tories are
mentioned in that affair. But as the Queen did the honour to my son,
the Elector, to demand, by my lord Rivers, his opinion of the prelimiâˆ£naries
of peace, he thought it was his duty to give it, which he would
not have done, if her Majesty had not commanded him; and it was neiâˆ£ther
<PB N="347" REF="362"/>
by his order nor by the order of Bothmar, that the memorial has
been printed. But it's said, her Majesty has not been dissatisfied with it.
You say, likewise, that you are of no party; yet if that party, who beâˆ£headed
the King, my uncle, subsisted still, as you say they do, there
could be now nothing laid to their charge. I imagined, however, that
that party was long since extinct; yet we have clearly seen, in these latâˆ£ter
times, that the parliament have done what they pleased, in disposing
of the crown.</P>
<P>The favourable sentiments, which you say they entertained towards me,
have had no effect; therefore, I am obliged to them only for their good
intention; and as I know none of them but you, I also believe, that it
is to you alone I owe thanks. The good-natured lord Rivers told me,
he clearly perceived I was of the duke of Marlborough's party. I anâˆ£swered,
that, if the Queen had made an ape her general, and that he
had gained so many battles and towns, I would be equally for him: and
I see that you have forgot how little I was obliged to his wife; and as
for himself, he never spoke to me of any thing which had any concern
with the advantages of this house. His expression, in speaking of the
Queen, was always, that she was a very good fort of a woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were also his expressions to the court of St. Germains. Stuart Papers, Nov. 1711.</NOTE> He
repeated this frequently, and it appeared to us too low a commendation
for so great a princess. But I have not the talent of reasoning so well, by
letter, as you have. I can only assure you, that I have always the same
sentiments, which you knew me to have had; and that I shall always be,
my Lord, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"I Can't say any one of your Royal Highnesse's letters are mor agreeâˆ£able
or better writt than another. But they are every one so very
agreeable, that always the last I think the finest and most agreeable. I
have now, Madam, before me that your Royal Highnes honoured me
with of the 8th instant, which is mixed with so much goodness, and yet
giving me some agreeable rubbs, that I ought to still this letter rather
<PB N="348" REF="363"/>
with excuses for my former, than to presume again to justify any thing
in it; but as contradiction is the life of conversation, as I have often
heard the late Queen of Prussia, your daughter, say, so I hope your Royal
Highnes will not take it ill, if in answer to what you are pleased to
write, I justify a little my former arguments, and say, that I believe it is
not to be doubted, but the sons and grandsons of those live, who were
of the party who did that barbarous murder on the King your Royal
uncle, and all those are ranged in the party of the present Whigs; and
certainly the same discourse is now held, and has been since time held
among them, as was in those former unhappy times; therefore, one has
reason to apprehend from the same race, and same principles, the same
facts; and I believe no true Whig will, in his conscience, where he is put
to it, and has any conscience, say that he loves monarchy better than deâˆ£mocracy.
Now the danger those princes run, that make use of a party,
whose principle and conscience is against them, is obvious to all the
world: and I yet, I say again, naturally I am of neither party, but was
for moderation, till I saw it so abused, that it only put the government
in danger; then, out of love to my country, and not till then, I put myâˆ£self
and interest entirely into the other party; not that I am personally
angry with any one man of the party, but really the business of party is
so confounded, that even a native of our country can hardly distinguish
them; and how much less could Mr. Bothmar, who has not been, in all
his lifetime, in England not above five or six months at most, and thereâˆ£fore
very, very unfit to meddle in such nice matters, especially he not
speaking the language; and not only to draw himself into a matter he
could not understand, but also the Elector his master, whose apparent
interest it was not to have meddled to have set any one of either party
against him. I may almost venter to say in confidence to your R. H.
who has always shown a particular indulgence for me, that I knew
from whence the spring of that memorial came, and the violence of
those people, I fear, will do great prejudice at your court; and pray beâˆ£lieve
me, Madam, the Queen and all her present ministers are entirely
well disposed for the succession of the crown in your family, and nothing
can turn that disposition; no, not even the unkind way of remonstrating
and blaming their intentions and proceedings in print, by way of memoâˆ£rial:
and pardon me, Madam, if I say, that, if the Queen had made an
<PB N="349" REF="364"/>
overture of her intentions,<MILESTONE N="February." UNIT="month"/> and asked the Elector's sentiments, by lord
Rivers; was it not by that lord, and in the same secret manner, the
Elector ought to have sent the Queen his answer, and have told her his
sentiments? Was my lord Rivers, whose estate and quality is so great
in England, not fit to be trusted with them? And is that a way to anâˆ£swer
the Queen's confidence in the Elector; to give so general an answer
to lord Rivers, and to print so particular a one at such a conjuncture?"</P>

that you have observed in them the favourable sentiments which I

found, that contradiction supported conversation. But I will not conâˆ£tradict
you any longer about the whigs; for you know them better than
I do, and the intrigues of England better than the baron de Bothmar, who
has not been sent there to reform them. But the Elector only gave him
in charge to testify his respect to the Queen, and to address himself to
those of council, to whom he gave the memorial, and who may have
printed it; for it was not printed by order of the Elector, nor of baron
de Bothmar. I suppose your multiplicity of business has prevented you
from reading it; or, that they have, perhaps, falsified it. For this reaâˆ£son,
I send it to you, that you may see it corresponds, word for word,

been pleased to make the succession the first article of the peace, after
the acknowledgment of her Majesty. I imagine, these will be the arâˆ£ticles
the most easily granted, by France; having formerly acknowledged
King William and the Pretender, at the same time. I wish the point of

<P>â€”"I Have this comfort, that, in spite of all insinuations to the
contrary, I have begun, by making the French, at the very
first conference, declare themselves ready to acknowledge your succession
to the crown of England, and that they will send the Pretender to travel
where we please. This we did artificially enough, at the first conference,
in spite of all the intrigues were used to hinder us from speaking till the
French had been obliged to give their specifique explications; and this we
did, without that any Whig can pretend the least merit in it; though I
believe, they who always strive to attribute all to themselves, will strive
to attribute what has been done at home to their industry. However it
is, at least, they must own it was not opposed by the Tories.â€”I am
glad, in one part of my arguments, your Royal Highness seemed to
aquesse, that you never loved or liked the dutchess of Marlborough's
character; and that you thought the duke's way of speaking of the Queen
was in too slighting a manner. If your Royal Highness had known and
seen as much as the Queen has done, you would think much worse of
both; really, Madam, a prince is happier that rules the hearts of all his
people, than he who is set up by one, and sets himself at the head but of
one party. In a limited monarchy, he reigns but over half his people.
The temper and constitution of England is mightily mistaken by some
people; this the Queen saw, that by reigning by one party, was but
being a slave to the heads of that party; and, therefore, when she first
made her change, it was possitively resolved not to stick to parties, but
to those who served her best. However, the other party's opposition and
violence may have made her change her mind for the mere necessity at
this conjuncture: if your Royal Highness was but to hear half the stories
I heard, when I was last in Britain, you would wonder how the Queen's
patience could bear so long what she has borne; such usage no mistress
of a family would have borne from their menial servants. But I hope
there is an end of it, and that she will spend the rest of her days happily,
<PB N="351" REF="368"/>
as she really deserves to do for her many good qualities. We are now all
hard at work, and we shall put that article of your Royal Highness's sucâˆ£cession,
and obliging France to promise, that they shall not, neither diâˆ£rectly
nor indirectly, assist the Pretender; that I hope you will have
reason to be satisfied with us. I wish I knew any thing you desired
more, in these negociations; since really, besides the honour, nothing
could be more agreeable to me, than to receive your commands and exâˆ£ecute
them."</P>

zeal and true attachment I have for your Royal Highness and
your interest. I found the ministry very busy about a bill of Resumpâˆ£tions,
which they had a great mind should pass the house of lords, and
was very nigh it, as no doubt your Royal Highness has heard, being the
last and conclusive votes, were equal; I was out of the house, wanting
the formality of being introduced as Earl, which I was to-day, after the
Queen was gone from the house, where she has been to pass a money-bill;
so that I was neither obliged to vote against the court and ministry, nor
against my late Master's grants, nor against a good one he has given me.
I thought it a very difficult point, and am glad it is ended as it is. The
whole town was in expectations the Queen would have said something toâˆ£day
about the peace; but not doing it, the commons were very angry,
and some warm speeches were made, which shewed the great uneasiness
there is in that house, to have a peace; so much that some expressed
themselves, that if the Queen met with any difficulty from her Allies,
if she would lay it before the parliament, they would ease her; but they
<PB N="353" REF="370"/>
were told by a minister of state, they must be easy, at least, till Wedâˆ£nesday
se'night, and by that time, the Queen would lay something before
them, which was hoped would be to their satisfaction. This uneasiness
shows that any peace almost would be agreeable to the nation, and yet
I am persuaded we shall have a good one, and such a one that was not
expected, and must be relished by every one who really wishes well to
Europe; <HI>for since it is thought so dangerous to leave Philip</HI> on the throne of
Spain, there may be means found <HI>to remove him.</HI>"</P>

that her laudable design of concluding a good peace, may be accomplished
with advantage to her crown and to her allies; as her Majesty herself
seems to wish. You wrote to me, however, in your letter of the 26th of

it seems they have not been found. I don't know who could be so maâˆ£licious

<P>"IN spite of all the pains taken to blacken the Queen's administration
under the present ministry, and to render us all Jacobites, it would
be endless to tell your Royal Highness of the intrigues to that end; but
they will all turn to the shame of the contrivers, as will that lately deâˆ£tected
on one Azzurini, an Italian, who finding his encouragement so
great, had even forged a letter from the Pretender to me, though I neâˆ£ver
saw the man in my life time, and am sure, never gave the least reason
to the Pretender to imagine I was in his interest. You know, Madam,
and the world knows, I am truly and heartily for the protestant succesâˆ£sion
in your illustrious house, and shall ever be so, though I should be
assured never to have the honour to be employed under you, should I
out live the Queen, which I really hope I shall not; for besides the perâˆ£sonal
<PB N="355" REF="372"/>
esteem and veneration I have for your Royal Highness, the interest
and good of my country will make me ever oppose a Romish King, bred
up with Popish and arbitrary principles; for I love liberty so much, that
even the employment I have here, is such a confinement to me, that I am
uneasy till it is ended. Your Royal Highness knows I always told you
I was tied by obligation to neither party, but if to either, it was to that
called the Tory, since I found sounder principles and honester men,
by much, in that, than in the other party. And since I was last in Engâˆ£land
and employed in this negociation, I am extremely confirmed in my
opinion; and so would your Royal Highness, did you but know the
falseness and villany of the faction, as well as I do; but a little time, I
am sure, will make it plain to you; in the meantime, I am glad this
story of Azzurini will be laid clearly before your Royal Highness, and
all the encouragements that fellow has had to go on to accuse the most
faithful of the Queen's ministers, and your Royal Highness's humble
servant. I can hardly believe Monsieur Bothmar could have given so
much into that fellow's stories, as to have sent his papers to the Elector,
and to have given him money, and promise of being gentleman of the
chamber to the Elector. Indeed it were to be wished Monsieur Bothmar
had had a better knowledge of the character of the English, before he
had been sent thither, for I doubt he has mistaken them extremely, and
has drawn others into his errors. I can't help telling your Royal Highâˆ£ness
a story I was told, by one that pretends to have been present. When
Monsieur Bothmar and count Passieny [Passionei], the Pope's minister,
was together at count Sinzendorff's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He means count Zintzendorff.]</NOTE>, Monsieur Bothmar rallying count
Passiony [Passionei] upon his commendations of the English learning and
libraries, told him; "stay a little, and you may go over, to do the afâˆ£fairs
of your master." Count Passiony [Passionei] answered him, "that he
had no occasion, since one had been lately there, who had done the afâˆ£fair
of his master much better than he could ever hope to do."</P>

<P>"I Arrived from Garlow, with Mr. de Bernstorff, but an hour before
the departure of the post, so that I must answer, in great hurry, the
letter with which your Excellency honoured me. It were to be wished
you had made these difficulties while you were here.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="376"/>
I never told you that I would insert the names of the regents in the
blanks left in the copy of the instrument; there is not even room for
them. I gave you the names of those who were formerly, and who are
now intended to be regents (to which have been added since, lord Lexâˆ£ington,
lord Polwarth, and lord Annandale). There are several remarks
on the last, and a cypher concerning the Queen's health.â€”Your Excelâˆ£lency
must avoid to discover to any one that these names are known to
you.</P>
<P>I come now to your remarks.</P>
<P>1. While lord Bolingbroke is secretary of state, to whom shall your
Excellency address yourself? and how can you avoid to pay some attenâˆ£tions
to him?</P>
<P>There will be no occasion for this, if he is deprived of that post.</P>
<P>2. The officers which the Electress is to have in England, are but
very few in number. She herself insists to offer the nomination of them
to Harley.</P>
<P>I added that to your instructions, contrary to my own opinion. But
you are to understand it so, only in case your Excellency sees no prospect
of succeeding in the affair without that offer; for if you can obtain the
pension simply, without any limitations or conditions, it will be certainly
so much the better, and the Electress will be the more obliged to you.</P>
<P>3. The Elector would very much disgust those who want now, by
way of precaution against a case which is scarcely possible, to put him
to the trouble of naming regents by separate instruments.</P>
<P>The act of parliament gives that power only to the nearest heir; thereâˆ£fore,
the Elector has it not, and the validity of his nomination at this
time might be disputed. It is to be hoped that the Queen and the Elecâˆ£tress
will not die in the same week.</P>
<P>4. As their Electoral Highnesses always assured the Queen and her
ministers that none of the family would go to England without her Maâˆ£jesty's
consent; that will be still the case, if a pension is granted to the
Electress, and being under that new obligation to the Queen, they will
be the more disposed thereby, to do nothing but in concert with her.
Besides, the more the succession is firmly established, the less will the
<PB N="360" REF="377"/>
presence of the successor be necessary. Add to this the past conduct of
their Electoral Highnesses; for each party, in their turn, incited them
to apply for an invitation to go to England, and they always rejected all
these intrigues, being determined to do nothing in that respect, unless the
Queen entreated them to it.</P>
<P>5. It is not probable that the English ministry will stipulate, on payâˆ£ing
our arrears, that the troops will not return again to the Low Counâˆ£tries.
If they shall think of any thing so foolish, your Excellency will be
so good as to write about it to our master, and to wait for his orders.</P>
<P>6. Monsieur de Bothmar having given some poor lords reason to exâˆ£pect
small pensions, our master would never hear of it; therefore, your
Excellency is in the right not to give a present of a crown without orders;
you may demand them when the opportunity offers. If the house will
enable you to make donations when you judge proper, or obtain the perâˆ£mission
of his Electoral Highness, let them do so. For my share, I am
a mere cypher when it is necessary to ask a penny; and I cannot at all
meddle in the affair. I am, &amp;c."</P>

his back to you. You will see there a great many who behave in that
genteel manner.</P>
<P>The new method which these gentlemen take to guarantee our succession
in the new Barrier Treaty they offer, is infinitely captious. I don't know
if his Electoral Highness will take notice of it so far, as to send orders to
your Excellency, and to Monsieur de Bothmar on the subject. It is
principally necessary to see first, what the States General will resolve;
and, if they will submit to the terms which their good friend, lord Strafâˆ£ford,
takes so much merit to himself for having procured to them. If
they do, and the same torrent carries the Emperor along, and gives us a

<P><MILESTONE N="1713" UNIT="year"/> THOUGH the attachment of the earl of Oxford to the protestant
succession had embarrassed the intrigues of the Jacobites, throughâˆ£out
the year 1712, the most fatal stroke to their cause was the death of the
duke of Hamilton. That nobleman was killed unfairly in a duel, in Hydeâˆ£park,
on the 15th of November, while he was upon the point of setting
out for France, in the character of ambassador-extraordinary. The secret
object of his embassy, the Jacobites affirmed, was to obtain the Irish regiâˆ£ments
in the French service, to be conveyed with the Pretender, in a clanâˆ£destine
manner, to Scotland. The Queen herself, eager for the eventual
succession of her brother, is said to have approved of this scheme. Her obâˆ£ject
was to enter into a treaty with the Pretender upon his arrival; by which
she was to permit him to remain, during her own life in Scotland, under
the character of presumptive heir of the crown. His friends in parliament
were so numerous, that she formed no doubt of being able to repeal the
act of settlement. These measures were prevented by the duke's death.
But the Jacobites continued their intrigues, in Great Britain, with unabatâˆ£ing
diligence, and entertained great hopes of success. The nation owed
the disappointment of their schemes to the timidity of their leaders, and
the enthusiasm of the Pretender himself, in adhering to the Romish faith,
contrary to the advice of all his friends. The following papers throw a
new and very important light on the history of the present year. The
secret intrigues of both parties are distinctly marked and accurately reâˆ£lated;
and a chain of facts is continued, in a manner that gives them

<P>â€”"YOUR lordship will have seen Abram's last of the 9th, I think
it is, with a very bold title-page and conclusion of a pamâˆ£phlet,
which the Queen sent last night to the King. I send here the Reâˆ£view
and Flying Post, which came in the same letter. I hope to be at
Paris, Wednesday, and shall observe the Queen's and your lordship's diâˆ£rections,
in dealing with Mr. Stoner and Mr. Philips. By what Sir Wilâˆ£liam
told me at parting, I find he had already engaged Mr. Philips to
correspond with him; so shall come too late as to that. At the same
time, I pressed Sir William to know what he meant by the encourageâˆ£ment,
he had before told both the Queen and me, their college had to be
so uneasy to the King about religion. He said their encouragement proâˆ£ceeded
from their reflecting that King Charles had been Catholic long
<PB N="366" REF="383"/>
before the restoration; yet that he temporised and never declared himâˆ£self
Catholic, till upon his death-bed; and that this encouraged them
to hope, that the King, seeing the impossibility of his being restored
without temporising, in the same manner, might be persuaded to it. I
let him see the case was no way the same; for whatever inclinations King
Charles might have had to the Catholic Religion, he never was received
into the church, till his last illness; whereas the King has been educated
from his infancy in the Catholic Religion, and has all his life made open
profession of it. He could not but own the difference of the case; but
seemed not to believe that King Charles had not been received Catholic
before his restoration, though certainly he was not. However, he repeated
again, that the King should be no more teazed upon that subject.</P>
<P>My lord Newcastle happening to tell me, that he was acquainted with
my lord Argyle, who is now at Paris, and that he would go to see him,
I thought myself authorised, by your lordship's letter, to desire him make
your compliments, and return your thanks to that lord, for his civilities
shewn to my lord Clermont and his brother; and the same compliment
shall be made by my lord Maxwell, who is still at Paris; for, as your
lordship says, the more ways it comes to him the better."</P>

<P>"YOUR friend Mr. Cary [Lockhart] writes to me from Porter's [Lonâˆ£don]
quarters, that he is in friendship with Mr. Bruce z f p p v
o z i n q y [Bolingbroke], and has lately had much freedom of converâˆ£sation
with him, by which he thinks Bruce [Bolingbroke] an honest
man, and much in your uncle Frank's [the King's] interest; but, at the
same time, he thinks Bruce [Bolingbroke] is not altogether well with
<PB N="367" REF="384"/>
Mr. Gould's successor [Harley], and seems confident that the latter is
not pleased with the other's conduct in Fox's [France] family; and by
what Cary [Mr. Lockhart] draws from Bruce [Bolingbroke], he judges
Bruce doubts of Gould's good intentions. Whatever may be in this matâˆ£ter,
it is fit Mr. Manning [earl Middleton] should know it; and though
it may be hard to penetrate into this dark man's designs, it seems almost
impossible he can long conceal them; and it is thought his first; or at furâˆ£thest
second meeting with Porter [the parliament] will discover much,
which I heartily pray may be as you and I wish.</P>
<P>I am told from very good hands, that Mr. Harry h vi Gsn smo a niy

with, and influence on, both Mr. Porter [the parliament] and Mr. Gould
[Harley]; so that if there could be ways and means found to engage him
to your cousin Knowld's [the King's] interest, it is thought he is capable
to do very important services. I cannot, to this minute, think on poor
unfortunate Ashby [duke of Hamilton] but with grief, especially when
I reflect what a loss his death is to your uncle [the King], which is hard
to be repaired in Stuart's [Scotland] family; for in it I do not know the
head that can every way fill Ashby's [duke Hamilton's] bonnet: but we
must submit to Providence, and I hope God will raise up other instruâˆ£ments,
both capable and willing to give due assistance and support to
your uncle [the King] in his most just cause. So, wishing you and all

<P>"LAST night I had a visit from Phil<NOTE N="Â§" PLACE="foot">Philips.</NOTE>, who began with many excuses,
for his knight's [Sir Thomas Hanmer] having received the letter,
as he did; and again repeated, that, as far as he could discover, the
knight was an absolute enemy to the Hannover succession, and conseâˆ£quently,
that, at bottom, he must be our friend; though he was so reâˆ£served,
that it was hard to discover his machinations, and when he spoke,
thought himself obliged to speak in conformity to the present standing
acts of parliament. He told me, at the same time, that the knight was
so far disgusted with Honyton's [Oxford's] proceedings, that he was reâˆ£solved
not to return to England, till he saw what turn affairs were like to
take; that he had already taken measures for going to the south of
France, and from thence into Italy, and waited only the arrival of my
lord Shrewsbury, from whom he expects more particular information;
and that, if that lord did not satisfy him as to some things, that he would
immediately set out for Montpelier. This he told me, as a very great
secret, though it cannot be so long now; for my lord Shrewsbury is exâˆ£pected
here, this very night. I find they are nettled at Hamden's, a noâˆ£torious
Whig, being taken into favour, and now to be sent to Hannover;
and that Honyton [Oxford] has lately put in some of the most violent
Whigs to be high sheriffs in some counties, on purpose to influence the next
elections, in favour of the Whigs. He has promised to see me again,
before my return to St. Germains, and then I may know if this knight's

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Have received yours of the 25th of November, with great satisfacâˆ£tion,
and have answered it before, and writ to you to the same effect
of this; but since you direct me to send again, by the old direction, the
last not being found good, for fear that may not come to your hands, I
get my friend, who incloses this to his correspondent, to take care of it.
Mr. Rogers<NOTE N="â€¡" PLACE="foot">Plunket.</NOTE> told me he would write, and desired a new patron<NOTE N="Â§" PLACE="foot">Cypher.</NOTE>; and
that then he would send what would be very acceptable, on all accounts.
It is certainly in his power to do it effectually, as you will find. What I
earnestly desired in my last, was, that you would use all your interest to
fix the remittance of Mrs. Rachel Jones's [the Queen's] money, which
will be returned from hence, by our friend [Mr. Arthur] that incloses
this. There is none so proper: his known honour, and integrity, and
substance, is so unquestionable, that I think there cannot be the least obâˆ£jection;
but, as the thing is considerable, one does not know what interest
may be made. I did beg and do again, that you will be pleased to move
it heartily. Mrs. Phillips [lady Middleton] can get it determined for
him, with a word's speaking; and as I told you before, Mrs. Harris
[Harley] did desire it may be so. He spoke to Mr. Rogers's friend to
get it done; for he esteems him it is desired for. He sent for him to him,
and desired him to remit a considerable sum "for him, that was of the best
quality, that has been lastly with you" [Secretary St. John], on Mrs. Dian.
Mansfield's [princess Anne's] account; so that I beg you to get an answer
from Mrs. Rachel Jones [the Queen], if it be not already done. As I begâˆ£ged
before, you may, if you please; send yours to his correspondent, to
send the short way, and it will come safe. I cannot change my opinion of
him I have named [Mr. Harley]. On Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] account, he
would engage all; but keeps the balance in his own power, to give a turn
the way he thinks will prove most suitable to continue for his own priâˆ£vate
interest. He makes himself many enemies, and secures but few
friends; for those that are in Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] interest, aboâˆ£<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>inate
<PB N="371" REF="388"/>
the trimming way he takes; and he will not be able to go on
much longer, without giving some other demonstration than he yet has.
Mr. Tom Smith [lord Mulgrave] is sincere, and he will not be led in so
dark a path. When Mr. Medlicote [the parliament] comes, there will
be another storm raised against him. Would Mr. Sandy [Hannover]
come into his measures, he would, we all do believe, join entirely with
him; and that is the reason, those that are entirely for Mr. Jenkins [the
King] do so rail and hate him. He depends only upon the widow's
[princess Anne's] opinion of him, which will fail him, if Mr. Thomas
Smith [lord Mulgrave] and his friends can prevail upon her. Mrs. Phiâˆ£lips's
nephew [lord Shrewsbury] will not do any thing in favour of Mrs.
Rachel Jones's [the King's] relations. He is a very cautious man, and
hates his principles, though he may wish otherways well, in some sense.
He is sent to be out of Mr. Harris's [Harley's] way. He could wish,
without doubt, to get Mr. Tom [lord Mulgrave] away, on any plausible
account; but he acts such a game, that cannot hold long, because neiâˆ£ther
side can depend on him. The next term will show a great deal
what we have to trust to. We have very good council, that will do the
utmost at that hearing. You shall have a particular account how all
passes. Mrs. White would beg, that if it were possible, you would get
your friend, Sam Brown [Sir William Ellis], to send her, by some of
those that have now a privilege to carry what they please, twenty ells of
taffeta, such as they wear for mantuas, in summer, of a bright blue. It
will take but little room, and it would oblige a friend of hers, if it could
be done. It generally costs a crown or something more an ell. Pardon this
trouble, and believe me most sincerely, Sir, your most humble servant."</P>

and the more I think of it, the more I am convinced, that villany must
proceed originally, either from the Irish, to remove one they generally
look upon as none of their friends, and to make way for one of their

friends; or else, that it is a trick of the Whigs invention, to ruin Jonaâˆ£than
[the King], by insinuating a correspondence with them to give jeaâˆ£lousy
to the other party; and by that means, to deprive Jonathan of the
only person capable of giving him advice. They say Jonathan's friends
desire this removal: these good friends have of late found themselves
mightily disappointed, in their threatening Jonathan, as they have done,
unless he complyed, or as they term it, temporized in point of religion.
It is very probable, they think Mr. Massey has contributed to his being
fixed in that point, and may, therefore have been glad of any pretext to
get him removed."</P>

He answered me, that his design to oblige the King, would induce him
to do a great deal more, if it lay in his power, and appeared glad that
the expression of his Majesty's passport was to his Majesty's liking, as he

the copy I had the honour to send your lordship some time ago; but the
duke had an explicatory letter, that dispenses him from the hard condiâˆ£tions
imposed upon him by the former, though, in effect, it meant
nothing, that could lay any essential obligation upon the duke, to be

upon that point; so that he designs to send to your lordship, the Empeâˆ£ror's

The reason why he has not sent it sooner was, that he feared your
lordship might, by the tenour of this letter, apprehend still that it implied
a kind of injunction to his Royal Highness, to observe the King's deâˆ£meanour,
&amp;c. But, as it is, in effect, but an exhortation from the Emâˆ£peror,
and that the duke is very far from acting any part that might be
disobliging to the King, or that did not become his own character; he
hopes those words, of course, such as he looks upon them to be in the
Emperor's letter, will not startle your C. the main point, I think
is, that his Royal Highness is well enough satisfied, that, by that letter,
he lies under no obligation to answer for any of the King's actions.</P>

writ to the pensionary, to know who he ought to address himself to, for
to solicit the State's safe conduct. The duke believes, that that of the
Emperor's will serve for a model and a motive to dispatch theirs. He
expects, in a few days, a courier, that may inform him further about it,
which I shall wait for.</P>
<P>The duke presumes, that the safe conduct from England has been disâˆ£patched
a great while ago; his envoy there having writ positively to
him, above three months ago, that he had been told so by the minister.
Your lordship knows what there is of it, and may perhaps judge it proper
to inform me of it; for if it be not granted yet, and that it may require
the ceremony of being solicited by his Royal Highness, he is ready to
act in that, according to instructions, and to do all things else that may
contribute to his Majesty's satisfaction and settlement at Bar."</P>

<P>"I Have not had the heart, all this while, to write to you, upon the
dismal subject of your leaving the [King; but I am sure you are
just enough to me, to believe, that it has and does give to me a great
deal of trouble; and that which I see it gives the King encreases mine.
You tell me, in your last letter, upon Mr. Hamilton's coming away, that
if your opinion had been followed, you had gone first; but I am sure, if
mine were, you should never go first, nor last. But alas! I am grown
so insignificant, and so useless to my friends, that all I can do, is to pray
for them, and God knows, my poor prayers are worth but little. I own
to you, that as weary as I am of the world, I am not yet so dead to it, as
not to feel the usage the King and I meet with. His troubles are more
sensible to me than my own; and if all fell only upon me, and his affairs
went well, and he were easy, I think I could be so too: but we must
take what God sends, and as he sends it, and submit entirely to his will,
which, I hope, in his mercy, he will give us grace to do; and then, in
spite of the world, all will turn to our good.</P>
<P>You told me, in one of your former letters, that you were charmed
with the King's being a good son. What do you think then I must be,
that am the poor old doating mother of him? I do assure you, his
<PB N="377" REF="394"/>
kindness to me is all my support under God; and I am confirmed of late
more than ever, in my old observation, that the better you are with
him, the kinder he is to me. But I am also charmed with him, for beâˆ£ing
a good master, and a true friend to those that deserve it from him;
though I am sorry from my heart, that you have so much cause of late to
make the experience of it.</P>

<P>"I Told him" (Mr. Philips) "that I would fain know, before he
parted, what he thought of my master, and whether he had friends
in England that he could depend upon. He answered, as to the first
question, that he was charmed with the character he had, and soe were a
great many peopel in England, but that they were loth to shew themâˆ£selves,
or venture any thing, whilst he had so ill advisers. I askt who
those were; he answered, that he ment a counselle that was there, who
made it their bussinesse to give the King ill impressions of the proteâˆ£stants,
and to make them odious to him, though they were the people
from whom he was to expect most service.â€”As I know my lord Midâˆ£dleton
must have beene ment as wan of this counselle, I askt him what
was thought of him in England, and that I was sure that no body that
knew him, cod looke upon him as a bigot. He answered, that he was
in very good esteeme, and thoght very capable of bussinesse, but that
since he changed his religion, they had not soe good an opinion of him.â€”After
all this, I told him there cod be nothing more glorious for him,
nor soe advantageous, as to be the means and instrument of bringinge
the knight, his friend, into the King's interest; and that if he was soe
honest a man as he often tould me he was, it ought not to be difficult; to
which he answered, that if there was an honest man in England he was
wan, which was answer enuffe, as he sayd, to my question; but that he,
<PB N="378" REF="395"/>
like others, wod be cautious, till they were shure of the peopel about the
King; but that for his own particular, he wod dey to serve the King;
and he made noe mystery, but that tother was in his interest as much, if
twere not for the aforesaid raisons.</P>
<P>I then askt him whether the great man Harle, he believed ever
thoght of doing the King any good; he tould me that question was very
difficult to be answered; that when wan examined neerly several things
that he does, a body might believe he had no good intentions; but that
he was so cuning and close a man, that wan shod not despayre of him,
thogh he dos things that seeme very oposite to our master's interest;
and that his friend, the knight, knew no more of that particular then
what he told me.â€”I tould him that, since their Queene cod not live for
ever, that my thoghts Mr. Harle wod doe very prudently to strike up
with the King, to have all confirmed upon him, and continued to him
by the King, after the death of their Queene. He answered, that if the
King were master of his three kingdoms to-morrow, he wod not be able
to doe for Mr. de HarlÃ© what the Elector of Hannovre has done
alredy."</P>
<P>In the remaining part of the letter, he gives a very improbable acâˆ£count
of Harley's receiving money from the Elector, and assures lord
Middleton that Sir Thomas Hanmer and Mr. Philips were sincerely in
their master's interest.</P>
<P>"My countryman," Mr. Philips, "drinks the King's health upon

<P>"MR. Franklin's [the King's] letter to Mrs. Deering [the Queen],

<P>Yesterday morning I delivered to Mr. Phe [Mr. Philips] Mr. Frankâˆ£lin's

gratitude; and said he hoped to shew it where it would do good service.
He told me his knight [Sir Thomas Hanmer] and he, were to part for
England the 13th, and did not disown but his knight was like to be seâˆ£cretary,
and himself to be employed about him. If that should happen,
he said, he could not promise to write himself, but assured me, when he
met with any thing which was for Mr. Franklin's service, he would comâˆ£municate
it to Lilly or Abram, being particularly acquainted with both;
and spoke very kindly, and with great esteem, of the last. Meantime,
he said, there was one thing he thought himself obliged to mention, as
being of great importance for Mr. Franklin; which was, that he should
shew kindness to protestants, and have as many of them about him as
his present condition could allow. After that, he fell on Honyton
[Harley], and sharply enough blaming his conduct, and insinuating
very intelligibly that he was not like to support himself long in the dark
trimming methods he took, having few or no true friends at bottom,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Anecdotes of the Earl of Oxford.â€”He has promised his interest to the Elector
of Hannover, who does not trust him.â€”The King of France, by Oxford's
means, must guarantee the succession.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"MR. Harley has assured the D. of Hannover, by all that is sacred,
that he intends his faithful service; and showed that what he has
done was to stem a tide, and that had he acted otherwise, it would have
ruined all; and that, by being in with some Jacobites, he is come to the
knowledge of all their designs, and knows their weakness and strength;
and by his son in-law, he is come to a better intelligence with Hannoâˆ£ver;
<PB N="380" REF="397"/>
and that son was, and is, a great favourite at Hannover. But the
Whigs so possessed Hannover of the trickish temper of Harley, that yet
he does not entirely rely on him; but demands, for a proof of what he
protests, that he will give him this proof, that he will get all the sheriffs
of each county in, that are Low Church, and a motly ministry, and the
King of France to be guarantee for the succession for him, and his son
and grand-son to do the same; this, and all other terms which he deâˆ£manded,
Harley has promised to do all in his power to perform. And,
on his side, Harley demands that it shall not be insisted on to have lord
Wharton, nor any of those that were in the ministry, who are his personal
enemies, but such as are for moderate ways. He would prove, that
that set were against Hannover, and aimed at doing for themselves; but
he is content to have the late chancellor Cowper, and some of that stamp
in, and this is to reconcile him to the body of the Whigs, and promises
all assurances to him and his. This is now upon the anvil, and you may
assure my lord Middleton of it, for I was told it by Mr. Cowper (brother
to the late lord chancellor Cowper) as the greatest secret, and I am sure
it is most true; his brother told it to him."</P>
<P>The last two pages of this letter are decyphered in the original.</P>
<P>"The person I have named is a very cunning false man, and has
several of Mr. Jenkins's [the King's] friends frequently with him, only to
draw all he can, to do him the more essential wrong. My council hates
him [Harley], and uses to repeat all his unfair practices; yet, at this
time, owns that he has so warded against a storm, that few besides himâˆ£self
could have done; and added, that it was the opinion of all of his sort,
that if he gave the proofs which he had promised, and orders it so, to
have the family of Medlecot [parliament] to be such as they had been
some years past, he will be in esteem with those that now hate him.
Here is no public news. We that are called Whigs, are in great hopes
things will go better; for all that can be done yet, to procure a parliaâˆ£ment
of Low Church Men, is done: the sheriffs of each county, where
there are any of that sort of men pricked, they are chosen, though the
counties are as averse as ever, or more; and it is said, there will be adâˆ£mitted
into the council several of the same sort. The French ambassador
has inraged the people in bringing over so vast a quantity of wine, and
suffering his servants to sell it, from his own house, by retail, at six and
<PB N="381" REF="398"/>
seven shillings a bottle. I know severals that have bought it so, and
drank it in his cellar, and paid down their money there; and they sell
silk. The Spittle-field weavers have a design to pull down his house,
because they have bought and sold great quantities of silk, they report,
to the value of 200,000 <HI>l.;</HI> this breeds ill blood, and was very impoliâˆ£ticly
done. Mr. Jacob [King of France], I am told, consents to be
surety for Mr. Sandy [Hannover], and his relation [King of Spain] the
same. This is owing to Mr. Harris [Harley], and he, with Mr. Jacobs,
now that is lately gone to him [lord Shrewsbury]. Your friend Mr.
Bartholeme [Mr. Mathews<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D. of Buckingham.</NOTE>], is zealous for his chief [the King]: but
what can they do? If they consent to contradict Mr. Harris's [Harley's]
measures, they will have their congÃ©e given them, and turned away,
and now there is a way in the family to give their opinion, that the
choice before them is writ to make it stand so, though it be quite wrong;
that advantage they can have by those that send up to them, it has been
the practice these late years in that family; and all that can be done will
be practised, notwithstanding the general bent is otherwise. I have tired
you, who am, with all esteem, &amp;c."</P>

the troublesome hero of this disagreeable scene, I shall say nothing of

whom I find is now very sensible how much he was mistaken in his man.
For lord Edward, I never heard a word of him, but good, till I saw the

<P>"I Communicated your letters of the 20th of January to Sir Joseph
[the King], in answer to which he has ordered me to tell you, that
he is very sensible of Cowly's [church of England] friendship, and truly
concerned for the right succession of that worthy family; that the power
he sent some years ago, by Mr. Lamb, to constitute new overseers
[bishops], where they were thought necessary, subsists still, and impowers
Cowly's relations [the High Church party] to act according to the tenor
thereof, as occasion offers, without need of renewing the same; but,
since they are now desirous of knowing Sir Joseph's opinion, and to reâˆ£ceive
his further directions, before they proceed to the choice of any new
overseer, you are desired, in the first place, to thank them for the regard
and deference they have to Sir Joseph in this matter; and in the next
<PB N="383" REF="400"/>
place, to let them know that he is of opinion this is no proper time,
either for himself or Cowly, to be making any new steps of that nature.</P>
<P>First, Because he is advised, by his best friends and wisest lawyers,
to make as few plain acts belonging to his character as possible, in his
present circumstances.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because of the difficulty of secrecy in performing the thing,
and the bad consequences the knowledge thereof might produce in this
juncture of time.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because the overseers of Cowley's family, who are now in
possession, being by far the greater number, ought not, in prudence, to
be provoked at this time.</P>
<P>For these, and other reasons, Sir Joseph thinks it will be much better,
both for his own service, and for the good of Cowley's family, to sit
quiet at present, and defer till a better opportunity, especially since the
thing has been delayed so long already. This you will be pleased to imâˆ£part
to Mr. Hartely and Mr. Lamb, and the other trustees of the
family, in answer to the commission they charged you with, and assure
them, at the same time, of the continuation of Sir Joseph's friendship
and esteem for them.</P>
<P>You are also desired to tell them to recommend to all their friends to
associate with Hickman [Harley] and company [the ministry], and go
along with them in all their measures, according to the directions given
last year to Morley; and particularly to caution his relations in Proby's
family [the parliament], to move nothing of lady Jean's concerns in that
company, unless it be in conjunction with How [princess Anne] and his
factors [her ministry], who will be sure to obstruct any thing of that
kind that comes not originally from themselves; and such a disappointâˆ£ment

had been long absent, and was little known in England; whereas Lesly
was of known reputation, and that either he or Downs ought to be there.
I answered nothing as to Downs; but as to Lesly, that his health did not

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. iv. 4 to No. 33.</NOTE>"An extract of Mr. Rogers's [Plunket's] letters of the 9th, 14th, 20th,
23d, and 27th of February, 1713."</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This extract is in Sir William Ellis's hand, and was probably sent by
him to the earl of Middleton. Almost every circumstance is authentiâˆ£cated
by the Hannover Papers of the same month.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>About the succession to the crown after the death of Queen Anne, and the inâˆ£trigues
for securing it for her brother.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"THAT what he had said, in a former letter, viz. That Mr. Harley
and his brethren would call home the King; he had it from, and
has since had it confirmed to him by, Mr. Netterville; which is, he says,
as much as if he had had it from Mr. Harley's own mouth: and that he
has had the same thing confirmed to him, at several times, by Mr. Pen,
the Quaker.</P>
<P>That lord Mulgrave, and the rest of his opinion, would be glad to
have the King home as soon as possible, if they knew how to do it withâˆ£out
running any hazard; and that princess Anne is of the same mind,
but timorous. This, he says, comes from lady Fretchwel.</P>
<P>The reasons he gives for not making use of a cypher formerly sent to
Mr. Netterville, in order to his corresponding with my lord Middleton,
are, that the French ministers had given him a disadvantageous character
of my lord Middleton. That his lordship and lord Melfort do not agree,
and betray one another. That Mr. Netterville was desired from thence,
(that is, from St. Germains, or from Paris) not to correspond with any
there, for he would have been betrayed. But that Mr. Netterville tells
<PB N="388" REF="405"/>
him, that my lord Middleton and Sir William Ellis are honest, modeâˆ£rate,
and understand the affairs of England the best of any he knows,
consequently the fittest to be entrusted and employed. He gives anoâˆ£ther
reason, for not using the cypher sent to Netterville, viz. Lest Mr.
Harley should know he corresponds with any about the King, and gives
measures different from Mr. Harley's, and such as may hinder the King
from coming to the terms, which he says, perhaps, may be expected from
his Majesty; that Mr. Harley would have the King kept in the dark,
believe nothing but what comes from him, or think of a restoration but
by his means; and that the King must abandon Rome, if he desires to
come home. Mr. Netterville asked him, why he did not send some body
to the King, to know his mind; he replied, the King of France would
know it and would raise disturbances in England, which he (Harley)
would prevent all he can; which, Mr. Rogers says, he believes, he will
do, as long as princess Anne lives; and advises not to believe the conâˆ£trary,
or rely on a civil war, as Messrs. Harley and Netterville say, they
are sure, we are made believe, by Sheridan, Mrs. Fox, Mr. Minnis, Mr.
Ferguson, and these, Mr. Rogers says, he calls Propaganda stories.
These, he desires, may not be believed, because the writers are strangers
to the affairs on the anvil.</P>
<P>He says, he is surprized that Sir William Ellis had not the papers he
sent him from Rotterdam; and says, he directed one of them to Sir
Richard Cantillon.</P>
<P>That D. Hamilton proposed to obtain of the King of France four
or five regiments to have gone with the King to Scotland; and then prinâˆ£cess
Anne and the parliament would have ventured to treat with his Maâˆ£jesty,
which they won't hazard to do otherwise till after the peace, and
till they have turned out all the Low Church men; which being done,
will send to treat with his Majesty,, and with the King of France, who
must give as a security for the King's performance.</P>
<P>That Mr. Harley manages the Low Church and Hannover, till he
can get the peace settled. Believes him hearty to the King's interest, and
has several instances of it, though few of the Jacobites believe him to
be so.</P>
<P>The cabinet-council are for the King, for their own interest and fear;
but will hazard nothing. That Mr. Harley has so watchful an eye over
<PB N="389" REF="406"/>
him (Rogers), that he can't go to lord Mulgrave nor Bâ€”; but
lord Yarmouth goes between them. That Mr. Netterville knows every
thing, and Mr. Harley consults him in every thing; and yet he (meanâˆ£ing,
as it is supposed, Netterville) would have the King restored at any
rate.</P>
<P>That they (Mr. Rogers and Mr. Netterville) would fain make duke
D'Aumont subservient to the King's interest; but Rogers thinks he and
those about him, are more capable of spoiling than doing business, for he
(duke D'Aumont) thinks he knows more than he does, won't be advised,
and pretends to know England, of which he knows nothing at all; but
however, thinks he may be made some use of, such as to fetch and carry.
He desires this may be read to none, but to the King.</P>
<P>That the cabinet-council intend to purge the army and the guards,
and make a thorough regulation in the kingdom. That he (Rogers)
will give a full account of all circumstances, when he comes. That he
is told, he shall, after a little time, be sent to Bar, to let the King know
his true friends in Scotland and England; but whether he is sent or no,
he will endeavour to come, because it will be of use to his Majesty's afâˆ£fairs;
though he knows Mons. Torcy and Mr. Harley do not desire he
should go at present; but he says, he will find a good colour, when there
is occasion.</P>
<P>That a great many of the Whigs have subscribed a paper, and sent it
to princess Sophia, setting forth their own strength, and advising that
young Hannover may be sent to England, whither he may lawfully come
(being naturalized a peer). That he (Rogers) could have got said paper
secured; but thought it best to let it be sent, in order to let Hannover
further expose himself, to no purpose, which will turn to the King's adâˆ£vantage.
By way of postscript to this letter, which is of the 14/25 February,
he says, he had just then had a letter from Holland, advising, that lord
Churchill and his friends are taking measures to send over young Hanâˆ£nover;
as being the only resort he and his party have. But Mr. Rogers
thinks, as before, the sooner he attempts it the better. In his letters of the
20 February,/3, March, he gives an account of the measures lord Churchill and the
Dutch are taking, and particulars of the paper which the Whigs subâˆ£scribed
and sent to the princess Sophia; viz.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="407"/>
That princess Anne could not live longer than March.</P>
<P>That she (princess Sophia) should order matters so, as to be ready to
come at twenty-four hours warning.</P>
<P>That they will get the heads of the clergy to give princess Anne a
memorial; setting forth, that the King is coming to England, and bringâˆ£ing
with him the Roman Catholic religion. This they believe will make
the country declare for the succession of Hannover, and give a handle
to the parliament to send for princess Sophia and her grandson, as the
only pledges she (princess Anne) and the kingdom can have, at present,
for the security of the protestant religion, in and out of England, for the
future.</P>
<P>That they will urge, in their said memorial to have the Whigs share
equally with the Tories in the government.</P>
<P>That they will get the D. of Hannover's minister in England to second
this memorial, which Mr. Rogers says, he hopes he (Hannover's miniâˆ£ster)
will do; but believes the cabinet-council will prevent the giving of
any such memorial. That Mr. Harley laughed at it, but looks on it to
be well concerted.</P>
<P>That Somers, Halifax, and Câ€”r, are pressing Netterville daily, to
use his interest with Mr. Harley, to bring them and their friends into
business; that the person who manages this affair with Netterville is his
(Mr. Rogers's) acquaintance; and tells him also, that Cowper, the late
chancellor, if he could get off handsomely from the Whigs, would join
with princess Anne in all her measures.</P>
<P>That he (Rogers) knows, Mr. Harley is for dividing the employments
betwixt the High and Low Church, and for having the choosing of them
himself; hoping, by that means, to be master, whoever gets the crown.
But that the October-club will never suffer this, and Mr. Harley stands
in awe of that club, which is jealous of him already; and if he should
share the places, as aforesaid, he would soon be discarded.</P>
<P>That Mr. Harley has spies among the Whigs, that discover all their
designs; and he lets them play with their plot, till he sees his time to
break it, and then they begin another. This, Mr. Rogers says, he knows
to be true, as having been employed in these matters from the beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="408"/>
That, if the papers he (Rogers) has given to the cabinet-council were
published, he doubts not, they would reconcile all the kingdom to the
King's interest; but that Mr. Harley, believing this would lessen his
credit with the King, and give his Majesty occasion to think, what serâˆ£vice
he (Harley) might do was more out of necessity than duty and affecâˆ£tion,
has opposed and prevailed with princess Anne to oppose the pubâˆ£lishing
of said papers, which lord Mulgrave and his Majesty's true
friends were for having done. That there are two parliament-men who
would fain have him (Rogers) give them some of those papers: that they
would improve them to advantage. But he says, he thinks it too nice
a thing to venture upon, without advice: so desires Sir William Ellis's
opinion, by the next ordinary, and believes the October-club would
make a good business of it.</P>
<P>That there is an old acquaintance of his (Rogers) there (at London),
who sends intelligence to princess Sophia of what the Whigs are doing.
That the said person shows him (Rogers) all she sends. That she is a
great confident of princess Sophia's; and, by this means, he (Rogers)
shall have a further occasion, he says, of serving the King.</P>
<P>That we, he says (meaning, as seems, himself and the King's friends
there) must strain a point to get the King soon restored; for lord Mulâˆ£grave
is old, and lord Shrewsbury is right, but timorous. These two,
he supposes, govern the cabinet-council, and keep Mr. Harley in awe;
and that, if Mulgrave dies, Mr. Harley will send lord Shrewsbury to
Ireland, and then govern the cabinet-council to give the crown to whom
he pleases, and that this makes him (Harley) delay, and go so slow in reâˆ£forming
the government.</P>
<P>That, to prevent Mr. Harley's management as aforefaid, he (Rogers)
had thought fit to acquaint lord Mulgrave with some late advices he had
had from Holland, viz. That Heinsius is of opinion, Holland can't be
safe whilst the government of England is in the hands of the Tories;
and that it should be the business of the Dutch and Whigs, whether
there be war or peace, to blow up the Tories, or at least make them unâˆ£easy.
That, since this advice has been communicated as aforesaid, he
(Rogers) finds Mr. Harley is uneasy and is afraid that the cabinet-council
will join with the Whigs, this session of parliament, to send him to the
Tower; and to obviate it, he is for making five or six peers more, and
<PB N="392" REF="409"/>
to publish the peace, at least with France and Spain, which he thinks
will so far please the two houses, in regard of the advantages England
has by it, that they will be soon reconciled to him.</P>
<P>That, on 23 Feb./3 March, a man of note had advice from Ireland, that the
Whigs there are ready to declare for Hannover, and that the West of
Scotland will join with them. That Netterville acquainted Mr. Harley
with this, and advised him to proceed forthwith to a thorough reformaâˆ£tion,
in the three kingdoms; that, otherwise, princess Anne could not
be safe. That Mr. Harley answered, No danger. That the parliament
will be so well pleased with his conduct and management, that the Whigs
and their adherents will be soon laid on their backs. That all the counâˆ£try
gentlemen are for princess Anne and her ministers, and will not be
for Hannover. That the Whigs may make a noise this session, and inâˆ£vite
Hannover to come to nose princess Anne; yet all will not do, and
they will get no point by it; for the parliament will declare neither way.
Their business will be to secure the protestant religion, and order matters
so now, that it will not be in the King's power ever to hurt it. Mr.
Rogers adds, that, by this means, he (Harley) will weather the point.
And that you, he says, "may depend upon it, if there is truth in man,
and I, he says, understand any thing, the way is a paving for the King;
but as they are resolved to run no risque for a restoration, they'll take
their own time, and the safest way to do it; and the King of France is
in the secret;" and you will find all this to be true in the end.</P>
<P>I, he says, don't think the King safe at Barleduc, and that the allies
will stand at nothing to ruin him.</P>
<P>That he (Rogers) had, since his last, which was of the 23 February,/6 March,
introduced Netterville to D. D'Aumont, who discoursed with them two
hours and a half. That they showed him how easy it would be, for his
master and him, to procure the King's restoration, if they would follow
the measures that should be given them. That the said duke answered,
"their desire should be strictly complied with;" and that the King or
none of his house should know any thing, till the business is done. He
(the duke) told them, he would rely on what intelligence they will give
him, and will give what money is necessary for carrying on his master's
business, which they had showed him was to restore the King; with reâˆ£gard
<PB N="393" REF="410"/>
to his own safety and welfare, of which he seemed to be sensible,
desired their friendship and assistance, and said they should find their
account in it.</P>
<P>'Tis believed lord Nottingham will, at the meeting of the parliament,
insist on Hannover's being sent for.</P>
<P>That there is come for England one Widam of Camb, as he pretends
himself, from the King of France. That he told Mr. Netterville, that
the King is not much concerned for the crown; is nothing at all addicted
to the Roman Catholic religion; is in the hands of lord Middleton and
Sir William Ellis, both deists, and believes they'll make him one, and are
not at all liked or looked on in the court of France; and that lord Melfort
is the man he (Mr. Netterville) should correspond withal. This, and much
more such fulsome stuff, it is said Widam told Netterville, in order to
his acquainting Mr. Harley with it; but Mr. Netterville would not, knowâˆ£ing
it would do the King harm; and, if said man stays long, he will do
hurt. What is or has been doing for the King's interest hitherto may be
spoiled, by such foolish management. The man means well; but Mr.
Netterville is not pleased with his actings, nor any that hears him.</P>
<P>Mr. Netterville proposed lately to Mr. Harley, to have a bill brought
in to break the triennial act, and to have the army put into trusty hands.
Mr. Harley answered, the breaking the triennial act would seem too vioâˆ£lent,
and there's reason to hope the next parliament will be as good as
this. The kingdom will be so well pleased with the peace, that the preâˆ£sent
ministers will be better settled than hitherto, and the late ministers
more blasted this session than they were the last. That the country genâˆ£tlemen
will never be reconciled to the Whigs.</P>
<P>Mr. Rogers says, that most of the country gentlemen are for having
the King; but will hazard nothing.</P>
<P>That he finds, after a little while, the duke of Berwick may have a
passport to come for England; that he and lord Middleton and Sir Wilâˆ£liam
Ellis are not hated, but lord Melfort is. Mr. Netterville tells Mr.
Harley they are men of moderation, which is well looked on among
them in England.</P>
<P>That it's desired, the King of France, or any of his, may not know,
that Mr. Rogers writes to Sir William Ellis, and what he writes, he deâˆ£sires
<PB N="394" REF="411"/>
the King only may know it; <MILESTONE N="March." UNIT="month"/> and that Mr. Netterville tells him
they must serve the King unknown to the King of France and those
about him; and that the King of France must make use of no other meaâˆ£sures,
but what they in England give him."</P>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. ix. 4 to p. 50.</NOTE>The Earl of Middleton to Berry.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>March 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"YOUR friend Mr. Plessington [the King] read your letter to me of
the 20th ult. with a great deal of satisfaction, finding you persist
still in your former opinion, that it is Baker's [Harley's] real interest, and
consequently his inclination, to have Harper's [Hannover's] decree reâˆ£versed.
It's certain, that if Aylmer [the princess Anne] should break
[die] before the cause be reheard, that Baker [Harley] is in as much danâˆ£ger
of suffering in proportion as Manly [the King]; and, therefore, it is
reasonable to hope he should use all his endeavours to bring this matter
to a speedy issue, as soon as possible he can, since delays are equally danâˆ£gerous
for both.</P>
<P>I wish the late alarm he has had of Aylmer [the princess Anne] breakâˆ£ing
may quicken him a little for what was like to happen, when even
Berry himself, in some of his last letters, had no apprehension of Aylâˆ£mer's
[the princess Anne's] affairs being in any real danger, may happen
hereafter in effect, when least feared or expected; and, in such a case,
no wise merchant, who has his all at stake, ought to lose a moment, to
ensure his effects and make himself and his partners easy.</P>
<P>I reckon Baker [Harley] is sure of Philips [the peace] by this time;
and Young [princess Anne] and he may reckon upon Kemp's [King's]
friendship. Wanly [the Whigs] is low, at present, and they have it in
their power to make him [them] yet lower. Wheatly [the English] has
but one objection against Manly [the King], which Arnot and all Cary's
true relations [the church of England] know to be unreasonable, since
all the reasonable security Cary himself can desire to remove all fears
of danger from Cotton's partnership [the Roman Catholic religion],
Manly [the King] is willing to grant.</P>
<P>This old dying man Price [the parliament] is tractable. Baker [Harâˆ£ley]
has an ascendant over him, and he cannot be sure of having the
same credit with his successor, nor that Young [princess Anne] himself
<PB N="395" REF="412"/>
will be then in being, and in a condition to support him. Edward's
[England's] best relations speak well of Manly [the King], at present;
and the generality of Wheatly's family [the English] are dissatisfied with
Harper's [Hannover's] late behaviour; but these gentlemen being changeâˆ£able,
their hearts may cool. All this considered, I confess, I cannot see
any prudent reason for Baker's [Harley's] dilatory proceedings: but he
being the chiefest lawyer, and his own interest so much concerned, Manâˆ£ly
[the King] must be governed by him, and comply with what he canâˆ£not
help; and, in the mean time, have patience and hope the best."</P>
<P>There follows here a paragraph, in which names occur for which there
is no key, in the whole correspondence.</P>
<P>"Plessington [the King] is, God be thanked, in very good health, and
receives all the friendship and kindness from the Gentleman [duke of
Lorraine], in whose house he lodges at present; but he hopes Aitkins
will invite him to a better house before it be long."</P>

<P>"YOU will have heard, before now, that your old and dear friend
Wat [Mr. Lilly<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Lesley.</NOTE>] is called away from you, and from his delightâˆ£ful
bower. I am persuaded the parting will be mixed with grief and
joy; but that the latter will be in a much greater proportion, and preâˆ£vail,
for reasons which your good sense will supply you with; and, thereâˆ£fore,
I need mention none. What I hope and wish is, that he may bring
with him such proof of the unity, affection, firmness, and zeal of James
and partners [church of England], and particularly of those of your
house, for the common interest of the manufactory, as may be satisfacâˆ£tory
to the principal friend Mr. Kreely [the King], the chief undertaker,
and who, as such, cannot but suffer chiefly, as his interest is much the
most considerable, by the contrary; and, therefore, whatever misunderâˆ£standings
there may have been, and on what grounds soever, it is certainly
best for all to forget and forgive, and to go enjointly to pursue the main
point; for truth and justice will have the better on't at last, which is the
great comfort and support of all that mean well and uprightly, as I am
fully persuaded, and know assuredly all of you do, and consequently will
not only act conformably in your several capacities, but also will give
such frequent accounts of your so doing, from time to time, as may
let Mr. Kreely [the King] see your cheerful and hearty concurrence
with all his measures and inclinations, which, if I am capable of judging
right, only and solely aim at the common good, joint interest, and welâˆ£fare
of all concerned. This, I believe, is enough to say to you and those
that are with you.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <DATE>April 6th.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>"I Received, last post, the favour of two of yours together, of the 3d
and 10th March, which I had the honour to read, both to Mr.
Kennedy [the King] and Mr. Crofton [lord Middleton]. The first is
very sensible of your care of his and of Wisely's [the Queen's] concerns;
and the latter gives you his kind service, and is very glad you received
his letter. I am glad to find you still so hearty in the hopes you have of
the recovery of the mortgage; but I find you have no hopes that old
Price [the parliament] will move any thing in the matter, so we must
trust to his next heir. I pray God he may prove as honest a man as you
expect he will; and that no breaking<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Queen's death.</NOTE> happens between this and the hearâˆ£ing
of the decree.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that common interest is the best security between
merchants, and therefore your argument is good; but interest, as well
as inclinations, change with time and other accidents. Besides that, many
of the wisest men mistake their true interest every day; but, however,
we must be contented, in these uncertain times, with what certainty we
can have; and so Young [princess Anne] keep up his credit, I hope as
you do, that, soon or late, all will go well.</P>
<P>But I am sorry you find Cary [church of England] so animated against
poor Cotton [Roman Catholic religion], who desires only to live in peace
and quiet at home, and to give security that he never will meddle with
or disturb Cary in the least. I hope, when Cary, who is a reasonable, just
man, is truly convinced that this is both Manly's [the King's] and Cotâˆ£ton's
[Catholics'] character, and their sincere intention, he will not be so
<PB N="398" REF="415"/>
irreconcileable as he appears to be now that they are at a distance. As
for Waters, I do not wonder at his ill-nature; for he is naturally hot-headed,
and very much piqued at this time: but I hope counsellor Baker
[Harley], with the help of Mr. Philips [the peace], will bring him to
temper. I do assure you, Mr. Peacock's relations [the Protestants] reâˆ£ceive
all marks of friendship and esteem from Plessington [the King], that
he can shew them, in the limited state he is in, and will continue to do
so, not only because it is his inclination, as well as his interest, but beâˆ£cause
he is naturally just and impartial to all his deserving friends, withâˆ£out
distinction of families.</P>
<P>In short, he loves old Edwards [England] so well, that he'll do any
thing to please him, that an honest man can do; and I am glad to find
Arnot gives it as the general opinion, both of friends and enemies, upon
Change, that his parting with his old friends, and especially at this time,
would lessen his character, and lose his reputation and credit with all
sides. He is certainly too honest a man to dissemble or deceive any body,
and too wise, on the other hand, not to comply with any thing that is inâˆ£nocent
in itself, in order to please and oblige his old uncle Edwards."</P>

for they find out more and more the blind side of Knox [King of France]
and his mates [ministers]; and that he is afraid to meddle or make with
<PB N="399" REF="416"/>
Mr. Ken's [the King's] affairs, or put himself to any manner of stress to
do him service.</P>
<P>I spoke to some honest men among the partners [parliament], this
day, and find by them they have but a mean opinion of Knox's [King of
France's] integrity and ability. Nothing will make him espouse Mr. Ken's
[the King's] cause, but his Own safety for the future, and that of his grandâˆ£children,
which cannot be, if Hall [Hannover] comes hither. They
told, that it would be of vast service to Mr. Ken [the King] if he did
but declare himself a Polet [Protestant]; the sooner the better, especially
if he does it spontaneously, and perform his quarantine; and, in the
mean time, his friends will be disposing things to receive him; for, at
present, the temper of the men-worthy [the mob] is not for him, and it
will be work of time to bring them to it; for they have been served with
venom this long time, and must have time to vomit it by degrees.</P>
<P>King Noble [Netterville] says, if he were the patron [Pope], he would
oblige Mr. Ken [the King] to declare himself a Polet [Protestant], beâˆ£ing
the safest way to secure the copy-hold [crown] and establish the phyâˆ£sician-resolution
[Roman Catholic religion] in Evelin's house [England];
and, when he compleats the work, appear with safety in his true shape,
and not be beholding to any body. As for those that Knox [the King of
France] has here, he looks on them to be worthless fellows. They conâˆ£verse
with none but sycophants and men that can give them no true idea
of the affairs here, and therefore will have nothing more to do with them;
for they are in the way of ruin, and will do nothing that is for their own
good or others; so that we must stand on our own bottom, and do as if
there were no such man as Knox [King of France] in the world.</P>
<P>His agent [ambassador] said to me, the other day, his master would not
interfere with Mr. Ken's [the King's] business, before he knows what
number is for him in Chomily [the country], and their places of abode;
and he is assured of Churchill [the court] and the rest of the tanners
[Tories] promise from their own mouths, or under their hands. Noble
[Netterville] says he ne'er will have that they'll be his friends, but won't
trust him nor his master; so that we shall be quit of him, and have little
or nothing to say to him. I dare say he'll do little good here, nor carry
any right notions with him from hence.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="417"/>
I shall continue to send some things to amuse you in your country retireâˆ£ment
at least once a week, and know the different sentiments of the several
partners [parliament-men], 'Tis not only my notion, but it is the noâˆ£tion
of the sensiblest part of mankind here, the present mates [ministers]
or Gold [government] cannot be safe if Hall [Hannover] comes here,
and of course must have Mr. Ken [the King], but on their own terms
'Tis, therefore, thought they'll be the harder on him, that he may declare
himself; and I believe they may, obliquely at least, order him to go from
where he is, further off, if he don't do in convenient time. The longer
he delays it the worse, says Noble [Netterville]. This is the sentiment of
Overton [Harley] and the rest of his brethren.</P>

assure you, is very sensible of it, and takes it very kindly; but, as for
A. B. [AbbÃ© Butler], who pretends to know much of his mind, he toâˆ£tally
disowns him and what he gives out, and assures me he neither has, nor
ever had, any dealing with him, directly or indirectly; and was so far from
giving him any commissions and instructions, that neither he nor his partâˆ£ner
Quarington so much as spoke to him, or saw him, when he parted;
and that what he, the said A. B. [AbbÃ© Butler], gives out to be Mr.
Kennedy's [the King's] intentions, is the farthest from his thoughts of
any thing in the world, and which would be the last thing in the world
he would do. The judgment you say Mr. Netterville made of it, viz.
that it would do hurt, if not true, was very just, and certainly it would
<PB N="401" REF="418"/>
do so; and, therefore, since it is not true, nor ever likely to be so, it
will be best not to press it, or mention it any more. But as to all other
matters which might tend to the ease, happiness, and conveniency of his
friend Mr. Keepers [the kingdoms], he would most readily concur in all

good-will and friendship the tanners [Tories] testify towards him, he
is much pleased with it, and wishes they may act in concert with Mr.

<P>An account of the debates about the Queen's speech to both houses. </P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>April 10th, 1713.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"YEsterday, dear Sir, the Queen made a speech to both houses. The
house of commons unanimously, except my lord William Pawlet,
voted an address of thanks. The house of lords carried it by 78 against
43. The duke of Beaufort was the first that moved to thank her Maâˆ£jesty:
he was seconded by the duke of Kent. My lord Halifax stood up
and said, it was fit to know for what; for they ought to have had the
peace laid affore them first, and how the succession is secured by the peace;
for the Pretender is but a day's journey further off; is still within call:
that the Queen, when she was last in the house, said, she would make
peace sword in hand. Upon which there was six millions given; and,
soon after, the sword was taken out of a successful general's hand, and
a peace made when they might conquer France. He was seconded by
my lords Townsend, Cowper, Sunderland, Montague, who all spoke
with a deal of warmth and peevishness; which is flying in the face of the
Queen and ministry, and questioning her sincerity, and not believing what
she said.</P>
<P>My lord Peterborough stood up and answered, seconded by my lord
[treasurer, probably,] and a great many more of the tory lords, that it
<PB N="402" REF="419"/>
was time the sword was taken out of the general's hands, or else he would
have been general for life, and continued the war, and the nation been
obliged to give many millions: that Hannover had three acts of parliaâˆ£ment
for him and the guarantee abroad, and more laws might be made
to secure it more, if they think fit; and if they be not satisfied with the
management of the ministry, they might appoint a committee to examine
matters, and due satisfaction should be given them. This my lord treaâˆ£surer
said.</P>
<P>The Whigs say, the speech is artfully drawn, and made popular, for
some sinister ends; notwithstanding, they will be as troublesome as they
can, and say they will make my lord treasurer uneasy; but he laughs at
them, and values not what they can do. The next parliament will be
as good, if not better, than this. The Queen relies entirely on the loyâˆ£alty
of her subjects; which is as much as to say, that Hannover must do
the same, if he comes here, and be and lead by the ministry and
parliament.</P>
<P>Both are wording the addresses. There will be warm debates about the
wording of them. There will be new changes every day. My lord
Chomley gave up his staff as comptroller of the household, yesterday,
and several others are put out.</P>

<P>"I Suppose you have seen e'er now what Quaint [princess Anne] said
to the partners [parliament], and affords you, as will others, matâˆ£ter
of speculation; 'tis Overton [Harley] all over, to think, by showing
so much love and friendship to Hall [Hannover], that the waggs [Whigs]
will abandon him and renounce his interest, and consequently espouse
Mr. Ken's [the King's]. Mr. Noble [Netterville] told him, yesterday,
that the speech was too condescending, and so much in favour of Hall
[Hannover], that it will be work of time to make the menworthy [mob]
to forget him. Overton [Harley] answered, that he must fight the
waggs [Whigs] with their own weapons, and silence them all at once, and
make the jewellers [Jacobites] more modest, Hall [Hannover] and
<PB N="403" REF="420"/>
Ken [the King] more pliable; and let them say and do what they will
against Ken [the King], if the menworthy [mob] and the tanners [Tories]
be for him, he will have the copy-hold [the crown], and 'tis prudence
to run with the tide, <HI>i. e.</HI> with the inclination of Mr. Keepers [the kingâˆ£dom].
Noble told him, 'tis a mistaken policy to condescend too much
to Hall [Hannover] or the waggs [Whigs], who won't think the better
of him for't. I know he hopes, by this means, to make Hall [Hanâˆ£nover]
abandon the waggs [Whigs], and believes now he will. If he
does, the waggs [Whigs] will renounce and declare against him. Time
will shew. Ab. B. [AbbÃ© Butler] was with Noble [Netterville], and tells
him Mr. Kemp [the King] is a Quietest, and tells every body of it, and
what he does is by orders. Noble [Netterville] wishes it may be believed;
for any thing will go down better than a Phiss [Roman Catholic].</P>
<P>I had yours of the 9th instant yesterday; am well pleased to know Mr.
Ken's [the King's] mind. We will take measures accordingly. There's
some things fit to be imparted to Overton [Harley]. If you think well
on't, it shall. Jasper [lord Ilay] and Arbuthnot [lord Argyle] did not
speak in favour of Quaint [princess Anne] in Holton's house [house of

<P>"APLETON [lord Athol] has got the staton middle [the privy seal],
and is gone to Intler's house [Scotland] to regulate the affairs of
that house. Overbury [duke of Ormond] goes to Johnson's house [Ireland]
to put the gold [government] of that house into honest hands. The
Allen [army] there is to be reduced from 12 to 8, that of Evelly [Engâˆ£land]
will be reduced to 10 m. The Waggs [Whigs] will be blasted, and
then discarded. Their management will be censured in Hangel's house
[house of commons] to-morrow, and then exposed to the world. They
will fall unpitied. Did the menworthy [mob] but know the roguery of the
late mates [ministry], they would tear them to pieces. Overton [Harley]
will endeavour to keep them in the dark, as much as he can, and as long
as he can; the reason you shall know by word of mouth.</P>
<P>Arbuthnot [Argyle] begins to be obstreperous. Overton [Harley]
thought to make him his smuggler [spy] on the Waggs [Whigs], and bully
them on occasion; but he will do nothing for him, till he gets Hawley's
[duke Hamilton's] place. Overton [Harley] won't trust him with it.
Arbuthnot [Argyle] is resolved to hector him into it. Overton [Harley]
makes satires on him, in order to expose him, and thinks to silence him;
time will shew how they will end. The Waggs [Whigs] will spirit him
to be uneasy to Overton [Harley] and Quaint [princess Anne]. They
say, they will move to have Mrs. Strange [princess Sophia] here; but I
am told, by some sensible men among the partners [parliament] they will
get no point by it; for they had enow of strangers. They talk kindly
of Mr. Jenkins [the King], at least to me, and begin to hate Hall
[Hannover] more and more, because the Waggs [Whigs] stand up for
him. He has his seven brass candlesticks in Hungal's house [house of
commons] which opens lightly in his favour. One of them said, the
other day, that it was fitting Quaint [princess Anne] should have no map
[money] before the portion [peace] was laid before them; if the stature
large [great seal] be put to it, she should not be ashamed of letting them
<PB N="405" REF="422"/>
see it; but got no point by the brazen impudence. The next thing they
will do, is to object against every point of the portion [peace] to make
the mates [ministers] odious; and Egleton's [the Emperor's] standing
out, as he does, will give them a further handle to cavil. I must tell you,
by the by, if Egleton [the Emperor] would but close with Knox [King
of France] the Duncans [Dutch] will be forced to vomit up what they
are to get by this pardon [general peace], and of course, will be glad to
give a helping hand to Mr. Kennedy [the King]. He would do well to
make a proposal of this kind to him, by his nephew there. I knew full
well, the Waggs [Whigs] make him and Hall [Hannover] believe
Quaint [princess Anne] won't live long, and of course, he must come here,
and then renew the weatherhot [war] again.</P>
<P>I have given convincing arguments to Egleton's mates [Emperor's miâˆ£nisters]
that he must not believe the Waggs [Whigs] any more. I foreâˆ£told
him every thing that happened him hitherto. He now finds it to be
true, to his cost. I know Overton [Harley] and his brethren would be
glad on't; for it would give them a good handle to call Mr. Kennedy
[the King] home, and run no risque or hazard of life or fortune. It is
true, the mates [ministers] have enough under their thumb, to justify
their conduct in this point; but they are coverts [cowards]; so you see
we must drive that nail as far as it goes. You may depend on't they will
keep the same conduct with Mr. Kennedy [the King] as they did in makâˆ£ing
the portion [peace], and carry things on with the same caution,
which you'll say, will be tedious; but they think it more sure. Overton
[Harley] is a goe cart, that must be pricked as he goes along.</P>
<P>It is therefore, Rogers put a precept [paper] into his hand, the other
day, that Moulsworth [lord Churchill] caresses Hall [Hannover] mightily,
and is putting him on coming to Evelin's house [England] with a good
allen [army]. This and several other precepts [papers] he has given
him, with which he seemed well pleased, and no doubt will have good
effect, which is all that offers, at present, from, dear Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<P><PB N="406" REF="423"/>
There is a tragedy called Cato, made by the Whigs. It was acted
several times. It makes impression on the people. The Whigs say, it
will have as good an effect on the people, as Shacheverel's sermons and
trial. They continue to bombard the Queen and ministry, every day;
but will get nothing by it. They have no interest in or out of parliaâˆ£ment.

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> <DATE>April 24, 1713.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>"I Had the honour of yours of the 20th instant, and can tell you, Roâˆ£gers
designs to wait on you, as soon as practicable, which will
hardly be before the 1st of June, or Midsummer. There is a lady from
Hannover, that has some pretentions in the French court, where she
will be recommended from hence, and from princess Sophia. He will
put himself into her retinue, and may be useful to her in France. Prinâˆ£cess
Sophia will take it kindly of any body, that will do this lady any
service. Rogers conceives he may be, by her means, being under so
great a princess's protection, more useful to Mr. Evans [Sir William
Ellis] and his master [the King], because he can appear barefacedly.
He must, therefore, wait her time.</P>
<P>I must, dear Sir, be under your direction, whether I should see Peyton.
[Polignac] or Tradenham [Monsieur de Torcy] before I see you. I
conceive I must stay some time at Putney [Paris] before I go to your
parts; and, if I should see any body else, before I see Tradenham [Monâˆ£sieur
de Torcy] or Peyton [Polignac] it won't be taken well. If it could
be ordered so, that I could see Mr. Bensongs [duke of Berwick] as I arâˆ£rive
at Putney [Paris], it would be of use; he is, I know, a favourite at
Knox house [King of France]. I am resolved to talk to none but him
and Mrs. Quarnington [the Queen]. I expect, by your next, to know
your mind and will, as to this point.</P>
<P>I was last night, with the gentleman [Mr. Sheridan, I suppose]. He
has the writings I spoke to you of before. He tells me they are ready
for the press. They will see whether Egleton [the Emperor] comes to,
<PB N="407" REF="424"/>
by the time prefixed; if he does, what relates to him, will be struck out;
for they don't think sit to expose him. About the close of the summer
[session] they will publish them, in order to sower the Chammismen
[country gentlemen] against the Waggs [Whigs], and to keep up their
spirits, till the new partners [parliament] are chosen. I find he gutted
the precepts [papers]; for, should they print them, <HI>in haec verba,</HI> the men
worthy [mob] would tear the Waggs [Whigs] in pieces. Overton
[Harley] says, there is a medium between Scylla and Carybdis, and will
keep it as much as he can. The partners [parliament] will carry on their
business smoothly and roundly, with little or no noise, but with caution,
and manage that of the sape [succession] as they did the portion [peace],
and take their own time to do it, and it will be left entirely to them.
This I know to be Overton's [Harley's] mind, and his scheme, which will
be put in execution, when things are ripe for it, which cannot be before
the next new partners [parliament] meets. This you will find to be true.
I find Mr. Yates [lord Yarmouth] will be provided for, and a great
many of Mr. Kennedy's [the King's] friends advanced, after a little
time, which is a good sign.</P>
<P>As for news, we have little or none. The parliament took off two
shillings in the pound, which will make itself a high church parliament.
The Whigs are mad at this, and will be more, especially if the parliaâˆ£ment
gives the broken officers their whole subsistance, because it will
screen the ministry and them, and what they can do. To-day or to-morâˆ£row
it will be known what will be done in it; so that the Whigs will have
nothing left to scare the vulgar with but Popery and the Pretender, esâˆ£pecially
if they can't get Hannoversent for.</P>
<P>They got the higher house of convocation not to join the lower, in an
address of thanks to her Majesty, for the peace. There are ten bishops
against the address, and six pro; so that it is believed, the body of the
clergy must address alone; they got the bank and the E. I. C. in their
hands, which make them more insolent.</P>
<P>It is believed my lord Peterborough will be made duke of Monmouth,
or at least, marquis.</P>
<P>Just how the house voted half-pay to the land and sea officers. The
Whigs opposed the latter. This will make the ministry more popuâˆ£lar.
<PB N="408" REF="425"/>
Notwithstanding the usage Egleton [the Emperor] met with here,
yet he will trust and cringe to Quaint [princess Anne] and mates [minisâˆ£try]
sooner than to Knox [King of France], for he sent one to her; pray
she may moderate matters between them. He does it because the
Waggs [Whigs] desire him, and make him believe Quaint [princess
Anne] cannot live long, and Hall [Hannover] will come here, and things
will go to his mind in a year or two. This I know to be true. I am,

hath given him thereof, all along. That he could send no directions to
him, of late, about his affairs, because he is in the dark himself, and has
been advised by his best friends to lie quiet, and not to say or do any
thing, till he sees clearer, what Dunbar [princess Anne] and Gooldings

all this necessary prudence of Knowles [the King], to any neglect,
or want of friendship and confidence in him; for I am authorized to assure
you, that he has a true and just value for Stuart [Scotland] and all his

proofs of it, and that he is incapable of ever having any unjust partiality

and to assure all your acquaintances in that family, that they themselves
cannot be more heartily against Uperton [the union], than he is and alâˆ£ways
was, which Scot himself can witness; since he had directions from
him from the beginning, to desire all his friends to oppose him with their

publickly, that five or six of the late mates [ministry] will go soon to

<P>I read a letter of Mrs. Strange's [P. Sophia], wherein she wishes and
hopes, the next partn [parliament] may consist more of the Waggs
[Whigs] than Tanners [Tories]; she finds they are more her friends.
This was sent to a bitter enemy of Overton's [Harley]: 'tis therefore I
thought fit to let him know the contents of it, and do find he was well
pleased with it. I did let him also know, how Hall [Hannover] pushes
on Egleton [the Emperor] to carry on the weather [war] hot; the Waggs
[Whigs] making him believe Quaint [Q. Anne] can't live long, and
Knox [King of France], being taken up and kept in play with Egleton
[the Emperor], he won't have an opportunity to send Mr. Ken [the King]
here with an Allen [army] as he may in time of portion [peace].</P>
<P>We are paying and discarding the Allen [army] every day. 'Tis obâˆ£servable,

<P>Overton [Harley] is advised to give the stature middle [privy seal] to

the peace, so did our bishops. Hall [Hannover] falls into the measures,
Mr. Ken [the King] and his friends here would have him. Knox [King

'Tis mean in him to own the sape [succession] of Hall [Hannover] in

<P>One of Hungat's house [house of commons] asked me, yesterday, if
I could give him a true account how Mr. Ken [the King] does; so the
Waggs [Whigs] banter the Tanners [Tories] telling them, that he can't live
long, he is consumptive, dispirited, melancholy, and very infirm, so that
they must not rely on his coming home. This is the language of the Waggs
[Whigs] now daily in the house; and that one came from Billingford

it was a waggish [whiggish] story, and not to be credited. He told me,

<P>"THE Sutlers [Scots] begin to be troublesome. They seem resolved
to break off with us, unless they are put on a better footing. They
all join with the Waggs [Whigs] to make Overton [Harley] so uneasy,
that he will be glad to resign in time. Some of Mr. Ken's [the King's]
friends help them behind the curtain, to pin him to the wall; for they
find 'tis the best way to make him do honest and fair things.</P>
<P>I have no news worth your notice, only the Scots make a noise.
Their representatives in both houses met in a tavern, where they were not
long, when the D. of Argyle and my lord Mar went from the lords,
Lockhart and Coulcairn from the commons, to wait on the Queen, to
tell her, they could not see their country ruined; and asked her leave to
bring in a bill to dissolve the Union. She desired them to consider of it
first; upon which, they returned and met several times since. My lord
Seafield moved, yesterday, in the house of lords, to go upon the state
of both nations. The motion was adjourned till Monday. The Whigs
are indefatigably busy to open, as they say, the eyes of the people, and
give out they'll let the world know, that day, how the nation has been
imposed upon and grieved; and give out, they'll send my lord treasurer
to the Tower. But you'll find all these heats will end in fumes and
vapours; though the Scots say, they'll lay a foundation for a ganâˆ£gernie.</P>
<P>Arbuthnot [lord Argyle] is night and day with the Waggs [Whigs],
who will ply Overton [Harley] very warmly. The mates [ministers]
will connive so far with them, as to send him to Tracy [the Tower].
They won't see him ruined. He laughs at all this. For he has Snap
[money] and Quaint's [Queen Anne's] favour to bring him off. I can
<PB N="415" REF="432"/>
assure you, Rogers laid a foundation for this matter, which you shall
know in due time; 'twill make you laugh.</P>
<P>I am told, by a good hand, Arbuth. [lord Argyle] will be turned out
of his all. Newam, alias Dan, will have the stature-middle [privy seal],
and the gold [government] put into the hands of Charles [the High
church] and his [its] friends.</P>
<P>The friends of Hall [Hannover] are upish, and think the day will be
their own. They wrote to him lately, that the mates [ministers] and
Quaint [princess Anne] are on a tottering foundation, and will break
Overton's [Harley's] neck; of which I gave him an account, two days
ago, and that Strange [P. Sophia] will never side with the Tanners
[Tories], nor abandon the Waggs [Whigs]; this I hinted as well to
Beaumont [lord Mulgrave], who seemed well pleased with it. This aniâˆ£mates
him much, and his brethren, against Overton [Harley] and the
Waggs [Whigs]: so that, on the whole, things seem to have a good
effect.</P>
<P>Knox's agent [King of France's ambassador] wonders I don't see him,
and oblige him and his master, as I promised when he came here. I
sent him word by his sarper [secretary], I was afraid he would be scandaâˆ£lized
to see me, that's a known jeweller [Jacobite], at his apartment,
being his master disowns Mr. Jenkins [the King] so solemnly; and that
I believed he didn't want any aid or assistance in any thing, since he has
come into all Quaint's [Q. Anne's] measures, and that their interests are
the same. He sent me word, by a party of my name, I shouldn't misâˆ£take
him, and that I and my master should find him and Knox [King of
France] honest in the end, and he would give his two fingers to serve
him; and, therefore, desired my friendship, and that I should bring Mr.
Noble [Netterville] to him again.â€”I am to see him to-morrow. I shall
let you know, in my next, what he says. Till then, I am yours, or not,</P>

the matter with Harrison [Sir Thomas Hanmer] and the rest of the orâˆ£phans

tanners [Tories], Harrison [Sir Thomas Hanmer] and the orphans [Ocâˆ£tober-club],
with the rest of the Tanners [Tories] will join with the Waggs
[Whigs] again to ruin him. This is the third shock he stood, and made
no amendments. The partners of Holton and Hungal [houses of lords
and commons] are in a serment, especially the Tanners [Tories] of them,
since they are made sensible, how Hall [Hannover] did of late fly in the
face of Quaint [princess Anne] and the mates [ministers], telling her, she
knows no new obligation or friendship he owes her or the present gold
[government], and that he will stand by the Waggs [Whigs].</P>
<P>Several of Hung [commons] and Holt [house of lords] tell me those
of South-house [of the French] have nothing in them that's brave or
wise, neither do they take them to be cordially in Mr. Ken's [the King's]
interest. I answered, they needn't suspect Knox's [King of France's] inâˆ£tegrity
to him; and that they should exert themselves the more they susâˆ£pect
him. They replied, his agent [ambassador] here should give them
some marks of his sincerity, which he has not done as yet. Eating and
drinking is not enough here; he ought to court the partners [house of
commons] especially. I rejoined, he is only come to make a parade;
but the next that comes will do his duty. This I did, to keep them in
heart, and up to Mr. Ken's [the King's] interest. I know the agent
[ambassador] acts by direction, and is afraid to be seen to countenance
any thing that seems to tend to Mr. Ken's [the King's] interest, at preâˆ£sent;
for he thinks there is no truth in an Evelinsman [Englishman],
which shows the weakness of his master and his mate [minister].</P>
<P>Rogers, however, continues still to blow the coals, and as he laid the
foundation of this late storm, he may lay one for another, that may prove
to Mr. Ken's [the King's] advantage, in the end; for Overton [Harley]
must be spurred on, or else he'll ruin all by his delays and false measures,
on mistaken policy. His heart is divided betwixt Hall [Hannover] and
Quaint [princess Anne] and consequently of an unsteady principle, which
gives room to most men to say, he is an ambidexter. The truth on't is,
he thinks if the gold [government] is lodged in the hands of the Tanâˆ£ners

so prejudicial to the nation; or, at least, they'll censure it. But
they ha'n't strength enough to carry their point, unless the Tories join

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Meâˆ£morandumâˆ£book, markâˆ£ed vol. ix. 4 to p. 42.</NOTE>Anecdotes, concerning the Treaty of Commerce with France.â€”Debates thereâˆ£on,
in the House of Commons, when rejected, in compliment to Sir Thomas
Hanmer, by the Earl of Oxford.</HEAD>
<P>"SIR Thomas Hanmer was sent over, in 1712, to the D. of Ormond
(whose relation and friend he was) in Flanders, and after that came
to Paris, where he was received, by the King of France's order, like a
prince. Never had a private man such honours paid him.</P>
<P>There, he put the last hand to the Treaty of Commerce; which very
treaty, he afterwards, when speaker, used his interest to throw out.</P>
<P>When that treaty was to come before the house, and several debates
had been held on it, just as the last debate for the final determination of
the affair came on, the earl of Oxford wrote a letter, as L. L. told me
April 23d 1724, to Mr. Bromley, telling him, that he would, by no means,
be an occasion of a breach among friends: that he would willingly let all the
blame lie upon himself, and the treaty be given up, rather than make a
division. Nor would there have been a division in the house that day,
had not Sir Richard Vyvian got up and said, that he had studied the
point of commerce: that he found the treaty admirably calculated for
the advantage of England, and he had grounded his notion on the best
informations; and that he could not bear to see a matter given up,
out of a compliment to any body's notions, when his country was to
receive a prejudice by it; and he laid the foundation of a debate, which
lasted till 2 in the morning, being carried on purely on a country-foot,
and the treaty rejected, by only about 8 votes. Lord L. dined that day
with lord Oxford, who was surprised to hear, that the house was sitting
<PB N="421" REF="438"/>
at nine o'clock, and could not imagine how it happened, nor did then
take a step to carry the point; whereas, as lord L. told me, had he but
sent a note to his brother Ned, or cousin Tom Harley, the court interest,
which was neuter, would have fallen in with the country, and the treaty
would have certainly been ratified: so that this point was left, to the inâˆ£finite
prejudice of England, only out of a compliment of the earl of Oxâˆ£ford
to Sir Thomas Hanmer.</P>
<P>A. O. told me, Sir T. Hanmer and the B. of R. were the two persons
that sent Sir C. P. to the D. of Ormond, pressing him to be gone for
France."</P>

<P>Overton [Harley] is ill of his eyes; and the eyes of his understanding

same end; but I believe the best way is to be neuter in the matter, at least
till I have the honour to wait upon her, and let her know how things
stand, and the inconveniencies and conveniences of naming a physician
[Roman Catholic] or policion [Protestant], at present. Overton [Harâˆ£ley]
says he will leave it to her.</P>

<P>"SINCE I received yours of the 20th July, I have made it my busiâˆ£ness
to find out from what ground that aspersion sprung relating to
your friend Mr. Philips [my lord Middleton], and at last have found
what I must conjure our friend to be very circumspect in taking notes
from whence he has the account: for Mrs. White has engaged her hoâˆ£nour
in it to him that told it her, that it shall never come to be named.
He speaks himself with respect of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]; but
told her of what I shall tell you on the other side of this; and the young
gentleman that came with Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] first agent here,
has been no friend to Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]; but, on the conâˆ£trary,
has insinuated things to the agent (whose secretary he is) injurious
to our friend; altogether, they have spread such a suspicious character,
that does, and will be of a very bad consequence to him, whose honour
and truth can stand the test of all their suspicions; but it deters and
frights the great traders from engaging their stocks. I cannot say it is
by the instigation of Mr. Ford [lord Melfort] or his brother; but I find
the person that told Mrs. White was intimate with both: for, in discourse,
he told her, that Mr. Ford [lord Melfort] had several times wept, in reâˆ£lating
the story of the unfortunate letter, that he says was the cause of so
much trouble to him, that letter that came here and was sent back to your
<PB N="424" REF="441"/>
house and Mr. Jacob's [France]; so that she found, by that, they were
intimate. How this person came to speak to Mr. Jacob's [King of
France's] chief factor, Mr. Philips [lord Middleton] knows, and what
he proposed for Mr. Jenkins' [the King's] advantage. He corresponds
with my sister Brown. I wish I could persuade her to take you advice;
but I fear she will marry, and so ruin her children."</P>

William Ellis's hand.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. iv. 4 to No. 46.</NOTE>"A copy of the 2d and 3d pages of Mrs. White's letter of 30 July,/10 August, which are
written on a cut paper."</HEAD>
<P>"HE corresponds with Mr. Inese, that is, with you, and he is intimate
with Mr. Mennis. He has given him fifty pounds on the King's
account. It is my lord Fingale that told me, that Monsieur Pontâˆ£chartrain
told him, if my lord Middleton was faithful to the King, he
was false to the King of France; and he that is here, I mean D. D'Auâˆ£mont,
is of the same opinion as he says, or words to that effect, But it
was not lord Fingale that told me that. The duke of Powis told me, he
did not speak or trust himself to my lord Middleton's sons, and repeated
only at large, that there were strange reports of my lord Middleton.
When Mr. Rogers comes, he will tell you more; but be sure not to take
notice you have heard any thing from me.</P>
<P>All will go well for the King, when the parliament meets again. She
[princess Anne] has a rupture in her belly, and is dangerously ill, but
goes about her chamber.</P>
<P>The proposal of this person to the King, to come incognito, is danâˆ£gerous
and foolish. The parliament will do it, if she lives long enough
to let it sit. But the terms will be cruel, and unfit to take; but if once
in possession, the power of altering, in time, will of course follow.</P>
<P>The thing [the late addresses] that passed the parliament has no conâˆ£sequence.
My lord Fingale spoke to the Lorrain envoy. He said he
was sent to princess Anne, not to the parliament; so should take no noâˆ£tice,
unless she spoke to him. All the rest of the ministers see it was a
trick of the Whigs, to get an advantage in the elections, and the Tories
would not have let it pass; but, with a sneer and a laugh, passed it.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="442"/>
Mr. Harley is provoked, to the last degree, against Hannover, and, much

<P>The remaining part of the letter follows, with the key interlined, in
Sir William Ellis's hand.</P>
<P>"ASSURE Mr. Philips [lord Middleton] of my zealous service, and
let him know I shall manage this affair, so as he shall have full
power to justify himself; but I beg, at present, he will take no notice of
what I write. Rogers is intrusted, by the person I have named, that told
me what Mr. Jacob's [King of France's] first man told him; and, to do
that person justice, he said he did believe Mr. Philips [lord Middleton]
to be a man of honour. I cannot find yet, if he has told the same to any
other person than Mrs. White. Rogers has told her several times, that
he feared an ill character of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton], in regard to
Mr. Jenkins [the King]. She assured him it was groundless malice.
Then he repeated, that he was the cause of Mr. Hamilton's leaving Mr.
Jenkins [the King]. So she concluded it was from that, that the maliâˆ£cious
report came; but now she finds that it came both ways. Mr.
Rogers is an ill figure of a man, and as ill an utterance; but what he has
fallen into, by chance, is very extraordinary, and I believe that filly apâˆ£pearance
has been of great help to him, in doing what he has done. I
believe you will say what he has writ was well done, and like a man of a
better appearance. He will be serviceable when at the great town [Paris],
and Mr. Harris [Harley] will see what he sends, and supply him in the
factory. He is honest. The traffick will require Mr. Philip's [lord
Middleton's] and your head to manage. He has promised me to have
to do with no other, in this traffick, but your friend [he means my lord
Middleton] and you. Mr. Peregrine [Ferguson] would have him to trade
with Mr. St. [Stafford], that is, with Mrs. Rachell [the Queen]; and the
person I have named would have him trade with Mr. Inese, who he trades
with; but he assures me he will attend Mrs. Philips [my lady Middleton],
and by her, trade with Mrs. Racheil [the Queen], and then buy and
sell by Mr. Philip's [lord Middleton's] and your direction. It is odd that
Peregrine [Mr. Fergusion] should have, under Mr. Jenkins's [the King's]
hand, to be one of the factors for present chalk [cash], one of his cirâˆ£cumstances;
<PB N="426" REF="443"/>
for none here will deal with him in that way, he is so indiâˆ£gent,
and other things alledged. I believe very well of him; but many
others do not. What I name of the fifty pounds given, must not be
named, only to know if that person has ever acknowledged to have reâˆ£ceived
that sum of the man I have named; for he scorns to name it
only to know if it be approved his giving it so; because he pretends to
have direction to be one of the factors named to receive an account of
trade for Mr. Jenkins [the King]; he would have had as much more since.
This person would have refused a thousand pounds himself, or two hunâˆ£dred
a-year to the fund, if there had been a compliance from others of
the manufactory. What he wants in understanding the trade, he makes
up in zeal and bravery of spirit for the good of the company. What I
mean, of not knowing he has told any other than Mrs. White is, I cannot
prove he has, though I don't doubt but he has, because of the report
being spread; though yet I cannot fix it on any particular person, that
has been told it by him. You will judge, when you see Mr. Rogers,
what is fit to let him know; since those he will deal with here, will acâˆ£quaint
Mr. Harris [Harley] with what he writes; for they are at his deâˆ£votion
to all intents; and he not at all a friend, only will have it in his
power at once, if he finds it will be so without him, to seem to have had
always the intention, and waited for an opportunity; for that is the true
character of Mr. Harris [Harley]. I find that Mr. Innes, I have named,
is no friend to Mr. Philips [my lord Middleton], and I am sure those of
his character do Mr. Jenkins [the King] great injury, by being with him
at this time, and his not being in their hands, as his father was, has done
him a great service; so that his being there is not well. I desire Mrs.
Philips [my lady Middleton] will receive Rogers well, and not think worse
of him for his figure. I wish Mr. Philips [lord Middleton] would write
himself a kind letter to Mr. Askine [lord Aylesbury], my friend, that was
at Brussels, who is now at Paris, and ill of an ulcer in his bladder. He has
long taken it ill he did not answer his letters, which is the reason he does
not write there, though he is still the same. Mr. Ford [my lord Melâˆ£fort]
has been once to see my friend [lord Aylesbury], and he returned
it, but no more friendship will ever be betwixt them. I do not know if
Mr. Rogers can support himself, or if he expects to have a consideration
from those concerned, who are to reap the benefit. I believe Mr. Harris
<PB N="427" REF="444"/>
[Harley] will take care, under-hand: for, by what I have found out, he
is at the bottom; but I am fully persuaded Rogers is truly zealous for
the good of the manufactory, and indeed every action has proved it; and
the use that can be made will be of consequence. Adieu.</P>
<P>I assure you, you are not mistaken in your friend Mr. Bartheleme [Mr.
Mathews<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Perhaps the duke of Buckingham.</NOTE>]; he is your real, hearty servant, and will be what he was again.

<P>"I Have spoken to lord Fingale. He has told me three things alledged
against my lord Middleton. One, that when F. Plowden was sent
on the King's business, another father of theirs was taken in Flanders;
and when they found it was not Plowden, they let him go, and that my
lord Middleton was the man that knew of this business. The second
thing was, that young Sheridan told my lord, that his father was sent to
the Elector of Cologne, who promised to assist the King with money: but
when Sheridan came, he shuffled him off, because he found all designs
were discovered to those here. The third was, that a letter sent by
duke Hamilton, was sent back to the prince of Orange, and that he
shewed it him, and, in a pleasant manner, bid him do so no more. My
lord asked the duke himself, if this was true; who answered, it was false,
and spoke of my lord Middleton with respect, and not at all so of my
lord Melfort. That of Monsieur Pontchartrain I find my lord Fingale
spoke of to the Queen: but she told him he [Pontchartrain] was angry
with my lord Middleton, and was a passionate man; but he [lord Fingale]
did not speak to her [the Queen] in the very bare terms he [Pontcharâˆ£train]
spoke them to him [lord Fingale], which were as I writ them in my
last. But now this lord is convinced, that all this is occasioned by maâˆ£lice
and designs, and desires, that my lord Middleton will be pleased to
send him his instructions, what the King would have moved in parliaâˆ£ment
this next session: for several of the house, that desire to be chosen
<PB N="428" REF="445"/>
again, desire him to know what the King would have them do, and they
will do it. Sir John Packington has promised to be the leading man, and
the rest promise to second it, and I know severals that say they will. Sir
William Whitlock says, he will, who is a leading man. If the King apâˆ£proves
of it, they will call for the box, where the names of those are, whom
princess Sophia sent to be commissioned to have the government in their
hands, till she could come after the death of princess Anne. This was sent
when they thought her a dying; and then the parliament, if the box be
produced, will declare against the choice, as men that are against the conâˆ£stitution,
and will take the occasion to prove, that there are a number
of Papists in employments in that state, and that they have built them a
church; and then prove all the disrespectful things which that court has
done against princess Anne and the present ministry, and, by degrees, fall
on the succession; which, if the parliament is as they expect, will be as
good as the old."</P>
<P>The same subject is continued in the remaining part of the letter;
and the key to it is interlined, in the original, by Sir William Ellis.</P>
<P>"MOST tenants are disposed pretty well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original.</NOTE> if Mr. Harris [Mr. Harâˆ£ley]
would once resolve it was to be done;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. iv. 4 to No. 46.</NOTE> but he will keep in
with both. Those five, [Sunderland, Somers, Halifax, Cowper, and
Russel,] he met, and, as I told you in a former letter, he is in close
counsel with, and does many things by their instigation. The book-keeper
that was with Mr. Jacob [lord Bolingbroke] he would have out of the
office, and give him a place of more profit; but he will not change, beâˆ£cause
he knows what he means by it; if the laws do go for Mr. Jenkins
[the King], and that all the management cannot hinder him, then he
[Mr. Harley] will appear as a main witness, else he has taken such meaâˆ£sures
as will justify him, and will have those five persons to prove how he
concerted all those things for the good of Mr. Sandy [Hannover], tho'
he did not believe him his friend; and this is what that person who is
hourly with him [lord Fingale] says of him. He is so afraid of Mr. Medâˆ£lecote
[the parliament], he dare not do more for Mr. Sandy [Hannover]
openly; but he renders all things of no effect, that is offered as to his
prejudice, and still gives a politic reason for it, that every one in his
club clearly sees what he aims at. That princess Anne's speech, at going
away of Mr. Medlecote [the parliament], was so ordered, he could not
<PB N="429" REF="446"/>
help her saying what she did; because he that it belonged to so to order
it, had contrived to have it so, and argued the point to Mrs. Anne Smith
[princess Anne]. As she consented, so he could not change it, though
he attempted it. I spoke to you before of Mr. Rogers; he is, I do truly
believe, an honest man. Mr. Harris [Mr. Harley] does certainly know of
his journey, further than the great town [Paris], though it is his confiâˆ£dant
that does employ him. Mr. Rogers will clear this point to you.
The parson [lord Fingall] I have named to have told me this, in regard
of Mr. Philips [lord Middleton], is no man of great parts, but most
zealously honest to his friend and relation [the King]; his wife, who is at
the great town [Paris], has sent to him to come, and says that Mr. Ford's
broker [lord Melfort], that was the first about Mr. St. John's [the duke
of Perth], desires him to come to him; he laughs with me at that, and
said he thinks it was a great way to go to make him a visit: he said he was
intimate with his brother [lord Melfort]; but never was but three times
with him [duke of Perth]. He does not say his brother [lord Melfort]
did tell him any thing I have writ; it was what I could not in manners
ask him. I find Parker was well acquainted with him, who he thinks
mad. All I could say I did, to undeceive those that had handed those
malicious reports on hearsay, to come to a juster opinion.</P>
<P>Mr. Laur [Sir Constantine Phips], that was my council, that is not
here now, I have heard from lately, by one that came from him; he is
sincerely a friend to Mr. Jenkins [the King], and desires he may know
he is so. He has gained great reputation where he is.</P>
<P>Pray, with my most faithful service, assure Mr. Philips [lord Middleâˆ£ton]
that none on earth more truly honours him; that I beg he will be
pleased, by you, to direct you to write such a letter, as I may show the
person I have named [lord Fingall]; only thus, in answer to my letter.
He gave me leave to desire him to give me such directions as were apâˆ£proved,
that he may deliver to those of Mr. Medlecote's family [the parâˆ£liament],
as I have here named; what I have told, in relation to Mr.
Philips [lord Middleton] himself, he has not given me leave yet to tell
him; but he said, after some time, he would give me leave to acquaint
him, for it was unjust that such fort of reports should not be cleared,
and that he was for what was just, and then what was most proper to be
done to cultivate all the family's interest together; for that was the way
<PB N="430" REF="447"/>
to do something effectually; for this is the time before the next term, for
all depends upon it. All has been trifling till now, it is come to the
decision of all. If this time be lost, there will be but an ill prospect of
recovering the estate. Mr. Rogers is obliged to be where Mrs. Rachel is
[at Paris], for some time before he can see Mr. St. Johns [the King]; for
there is something to be done there that will regard Mr. Harris [Harley],
by whose direction he goes with that lady I formerly named [lady Anne
Bellamont]. I believe I have tired you with this long scroll, who am,

trades in [his religion] are no less forbidden here, in this country, than
they are in Falmouth [France], he must trade warily and in private, that
people may take as little notice of it as possible. This is prudent and
necessary, in a place where we have measures to keep, and where we are
not masters; and the more our landlord is kind to us, the less we ought

<P>"I Could not part for the waters, without writing to you, though I
have little to say, only to acknowledge the favour of your last of the
21st July. The proposal you mention therein, of promoting a good
work at Geneva, which might be very acceptable to uncle Edwards
[England], would certainly be complied with by Kelly [the King] and
Morton [Middleton], as far as would be proper for them, in case they
passed that way; but the travelling, which you supposed these two genâˆ£tlemen
might be obliged to, is, I hope, now out of doors. The good
man, in whose house they live, is so kind to them, that he seems in no
way inclined to part with them, unless it were to travel another way;
so, in all likelihood, they will pass the winter where they are, and where
I hope uncle Edwards [England] will be pleased to hear, that his nephew
Kelly [the King] is very kind to a Caryman [a church of England clergyâˆ£man],
whom he has sent for of purpose to follow his profession with the
<PB N="432" REF="449"/>
Peacocks [ProteÌ„stants] of his family, and who is arrived but some days
ago.</P>
<P>This, I hope, will answer, in some measure, the ends of your proâˆ£posal;
and ought to have some good effect with all those who will be
contented with reasonable things, which I am sure Kelly [the King] will
never refuse to satisfy his uncle, and make the good man easy. On the
other hand, it is but fit the nephew should be made easy too. He is a
sincere man, and he thinks it is neither consistent with his honour nor his
interest, at this time, to be disputing about Mr. Ross [religion]; so the
less that gentleman is spoke of the better, and he hopes all those that
wish him well will comply with him in that point.</P>

<P>"YOU remember you had directions sent to you, by a letter, in Mr.
Massey's [Middleton and sometimes the King's] own hand, of the
20th of May last, by which Jeremy [the King] desired you and all your
friends of the College, to press all their Cowley [High Church] acquaintâˆ£ances
to use their utmost endeavours, both with Edgebury [England] and
Mark [Scotland], to bring Trevor [Tories] into Proby's family [parâˆ£liament]
next term, and to engage him to be ruled, in every thing, by
Charles Brown's lawyers [princess Anne's ministers], Hickman [Harâˆ£ley]
and his associates.</P>
<P>You may also remember, that upon occasion of the late hard usage
Snell [Scotland] had met with in Proby's family [parliament], in which
it was feared he might be drawn in by Williamson [the Whigs], to join
him against Charles's said lawyers. I writ to you of the 22d of June, to
put you in mind of Jeremy's positive directions, that Juxon should join
with Hickman's company, upon all occasions, against Williamson, and
to tell you it was expected Will. Morley would bestir himself as he ought,
in this matter, and stick to his directions.

I am now ordered to reiterate the same directions to you, particularly
in relation to 5xgxz hspai, [elections] I mean Mr. Everard (whom pray
mark down, lest you should forget him). His business is now in hand,
and presses mightily. You are, therefore, desired to set all your friends,
not only those of the college, but all others of Juxon's family, whom
you can trust, that Jeremy desires and expects from them, that they will
spare no pains, and lose no time, to employ all the influence they can
have upon Everard [the Elections], either by themselves, or by relations
and acquaintances, to persuade that gentleman to be firm to Cowley, and
to unite with Charles's [Queen's] lawyers, and be directed by them, in
all that matter now in hand; that Hickman [Harley] may see, that Juxâˆ£on
[Pretender] is his friend, and desires no better than to join stocks with
him, and trust his interest in his hands.</P>
<P>This is what John Brown [the King's] best friends advised, as a thing
which they hope may turn to his account. Whatever the event be, Jereâˆ£my
[the King] is resolved to do his part, which is the reason he now so

being certainly in power to do good offices to your friend Mr. Kelly [the

Jeffrys<NOTE N="Â§" PLACE="foot">Pretender.</NOTE> should render himself as useful and acceptable to him as he can,
upon all occasions; but particularly upon this of young Price's forming

means were found, without affectation, to let Baker [Harley] and Young

Manly [the King] has given such directions to his friends, which I hope
they cannot but take kindly, and be grateful for in due time.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="454"/>
I find by your last, which I think is of the 11th of August, that Edâˆ£wards
[England] continues still peevish against poor Cotton, which is no
kind return to the sincere friendship of Manly, for all Cary's relaâˆ£tions,
whose interest and security (as I have often told) he is constantly
resolved to support, in every thing, that is consistent with his honour and
conscience. I hope Arnot will make it his endeavours, upon all proper
occasions, to soften Edwards upon that point, and to convince him how
hard it would be upon Manly to require things of him, that are neither
necessary for Cary's safety nor his interest; for certainly Wanly himâˆ£self
[the Whigs], would not use him worse than that, if he were to join
stocks with them, which he hopes Cary will never force him to."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Am sorry to find you lay so much stress upon Mr. Smith's [the
King's] living [being] or not living [being] in Forbes's [catholic]
family, as if the issue of his law suit depended upon it, when Mr. Anderâˆ£son
[E. Mar] himself knows, that it would be against all law to cast him
upon that account; since therefore, you have been so plain with me, upon
this subject, confiding in your friendship, I will use the same freedom
with you, in telling you my thoughts of this matter.</P>
<P>In the first place, if Smith's friends require this condition from him,
they do him no favour; for he could compound, at that rate, with his
greatest enemies, and with Cramond himself [the Whigs].</P>
<P>In the next place, living or not living with Forbes, must be a volunâˆ£tary
act of one's own free choice, otherwise it cannot answer the ends for
which it is required. It would be but cheating and imposing upon one
another, which is neither Smith nor Cant's [Church of England's] inâˆ£tention.</P>
<P>If Smith be willing, on one side, as certainly he is, to give Cant's faâˆ£mily
all the marks of favour and friendship, that can be asked of him,
for the benefit of the family, I think it a little hard, on the other side, that
Cant [church of England] should not allow him the liberty that all freeâˆ£men
have, to live where he pleases, and to follow his own judgment, in a
thing that relates only personally to himself, and can be of no real preâˆ£judice
to Cant.</P>
<P>If he were to trade with a Cramond [Whiggish] mob, I should not
wonder at any hardship of that kind, from such people. But I hope
Cant's [church of England's] relations are men of too good principles,
to refuse the liberty to Smith himself, which he is willing and ready to seâˆ£cure
to all their family, in the strongest and most authentic manner that
they themselves can desire.</P>
<P>They own, that the justice of the cause in question, is altogether inâˆ£dependant
of Mr. Talbot [religion]; therefore, to deal justly and imâˆ£partially
<PB N="437" REF="456"/>
with Smith, they should begin by deciding his law suit; and afâˆ£ter
he is in peaceable possession of his estate, then he and Cant [church of
England] may talk of Talbot's concerns [religion], with more honour
and freedom, and less suspicion of being biassed by views of interest, than
at present.</P>
<P>I must tell you, that I know Smith to be very nice upon that point:
for, if it were to receive a crown, he would not do a thing that might reâˆ£proach
either his honour or his sincerity. He desires a union of confiâˆ£dence,
friendship, and interest, with Cant [church of England], above all
things, because he thinks him an honest man, and they may be mutually
useful to one another. For that reason, he seeks all occasions to oblige
him, and to make all those of his relations that are with him, easy; and
it is for their satisfaction, that he has brought a person lately into his faâˆ£mily
who has free liberty to serve them, in their own way.</P>
<P>He had reason to hope, that Cant would be satisfied with this testimoâˆ£ny
of his good-will towards him; and that in return, he would be as easy
to him, as he has been to his relations; but, instead of that, he has met
with more uneasiness, upon that subject, than he had before; what he
meant only for the comfort and satisfaction of his friends having been inâˆ£terpreted
beyond what he intended, which has drawn several unseasonaâˆ£ble
teazings upon him, on one side, and occasioned rash judgments, on
the other. He cannot help people's speaking; but it were to be wished,
at least, that his friends had spoke of Talbot [religion] and him with
more caution and prudence than they have done. For their late reports
have done him no good; on the contrary, they have exposed him to be
looked upon, as a wavering, interested, and dissembling spirit, which is
quite the reverse of his character.</P>
<P>I must desire you, therefore, as you love Smith's interest and reputaâˆ£tion,
to use your endeavours to silence their groundless reports, wherever
you perceive they may do him harm, and to prevail all you can with
Cant's [church of England's] chief relations, not to teaze upon Forbes's
[catholic] account, in so unseasonable a conjuncture as this is. Let them
ask for themselves whatever they please. He loves them so well, that
he will refuse them nothing that can tend to make them happy and secure
them in their estates. This which he hath so often promised, and reâˆ£solves
<PB N="438" REF="457"/>
still, in due time, to perform, should be sufficient, and to ask more,
especially at this time, would neither be friendly nor just.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, having told you freely my mind, I hope you will make
your own prudent use of it, and employ your interest, when occasion
offers, with Ord [princess Anne], Jones [Harley], Bambery [St. John],
and others of your friends, in case any of them have any good will toâˆ£wards
Smith [the King], to persuade them to be contented to trade with
him upon the foot here mentioned, which is certainly the surest for both
sides; for whatever he promises they may depend upon, nor will he leave
it, even in his own power to deceive them. Whereas, if he should, at
this suspicious time, part with his old friend Forbes [Catholic] so easily,
or be any ways moved thereto by the motives represented to him, by Mr.
Anderson, it would not be prudent in any of his new friends, to trust him
half so much, as they may safely do, remaining as he is, especially when
he offers to give them all the demonstrations of his friendship, firmness,
and sincerity, that conscience and honour will allow him."</P>

see you here, or not. I have no hopes any further than this, that I perâˆ£suade
myself, that it is the interest of those that are to serve you, to serve

imagine, yet some think it impracticable, because of the difficulty of setâˆ£tling
the estate, whether it shall be parted, or that our friend [the King]

<P>I do not concern myself much about these difficulties, because I believe,
that if you are to have any good done you, those that design it you will
easily find out an expedient to do it by. My opinion is, that the generality,
especially those in place here, are wholly guided by interest, and that
setting that aside, it is equal to them, whether this or that person is put
in the possession of the estate; and it is for that reason only, that you can
expect to have yours restored, that they may enjoy theirs, which otherâˆ£wise,
I think, they cannot do. I have heard, that the worthless lord

the time of electing a new senate, only laughed at them for: for when
the addresses were presented to the Queen, that of the upper house was
attended only, by five or six Whig lords; that of the lower, by twenty
Whig senators. This I write, that you may know how well people seem

imports, that the duke of Shrewsbury goes to Ireland in 14 days,
to call a parliament, and put that kingdom into honest hands. He is
to come back to England, in four months. The changes go on by deâˆ£grees
to Mr. Kennedy's [the King's] advantage; none but his friends
advanced or employed, in order to serve the great project. I am deâˆ£sired
to tell you, Mr. Kennedy [the King] and those about him are to
obey and observe what instructions are sent him from England, from
time to time, and that, in six or eight months, things will be ripe and
forward to be imparted to him. I am at liberty to go thither; but must
not make any stay, for reasons he don't think fit to be told now.</P>
<P>Bolingbroke and Oxford do not set their horses together, because he
is so dilatory and dozes over things, which is the occasion there is so
many Whigs chosen this parliament, though there are four Tories to one,
they think it little; but I think, if there were more Whigs it were
better.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="459"/>
He tells me, the house of commons will let no prime minister govern
for the future, but manage the main point, and make the crown dependâˆ£ent
on them. They will give money to have a share of it themselves;
by this he gives to understand, that if Knox [the King of France] would
but send his agent over soon with a good spell, Mr. Kennedy [the King]
might soon go home. They are hungry; a pound now will go further
than ten another time. I gave de Torcy an account of all this matter;
but I believe it will be to little or no purpose; for it is a maxim with
him, not to believe Mr. Kennedy [the King's] friends.</P>
<P>I continue to fix Mrs. Strange [princess Sophia] against Overton [Mr.
Harley] and he against her. I wrote him, last night, that I saw a letter
from her and her son, which says, he is a worthless hollow-fellow. She
complains the English do not go much near her now, of late.</P>
<P>Noble [Mr. Netterville] tells me, in his letters, the parliament will put
in the Queen's power to name her successor; and if she lives a little longer
Hannover will never see England. The duke of Berwick will be here
the next week. I am to go to De Torcy with him, and tell him what's
proper, and tell him what orders I have from England; doubtless, he
won't be against my going to see you there. Noble [Netterville] truly
tells me, that it is but curiosity of both sides; therefore, is not very fond
of my going yet, till he sees how matters go. The parliament will be
very active and stirring. The treasurer and ministry look on the German
minister, residing in England with such disdain and contempt, and he on
them, that they are ready to fly in one anothers faces when they meet.
The Whigs call themselves the church Tories, to deceive the people;
but they get no profit by it. Queen is now very well; but the Whigs
say she will die next winter, and gives the Emperor hopes Hannover
will come over; for they tell them, the moment the church party goes
about to set aside the succession, or declares for the Pretender, the mob
will come over to them, as they did to the Tories in Sacheverel's time.
This they write abroad daily to their correspondents here and elsewhere,
I am, &amp;c."</P>

his own law-suit, he would not stick to use all his interest, both privately

heartily; (and the duke of Berwick's commission, is to see how far this
will reach). Perhaps some good may come of this; at least, it is and
shall be the subject of my prayers and best endeavours. The duke of
Berwick, I suppose, will give his sentiments more at large. I shall wait
upon her Majesty this evening, and so make all the haste I can back to

was in hopes of seeing you afore this. But finding my stay here
longer than I at first proposed, and my inclination leading me, to be acâˆ£quainted

first approaches by letter, till I have the happiness to wait upon you,
which, in some measure, depends upon his Majesty and you, Mr. de

truth is, Sir, neither of them knows, nor perhaps is it convenient they
should know, the reasons I have for seeing his Majesty and you; nor do
I think it proper to commit any thing to paper afore I see his Majesty

judgment than my own.</P>
<P>I doubt not but you have seen several of my letters to Sir William. I
don't know whether they gave that satisfaction you desire. It may be,
they were not explained, as they ought, or I meant. The circumstance
I was then in obliged me to write dark, and not descend to particulars;
and the not being personally acquainted with you, was then the reason I did
not presume to address myself to you; and though the same reason still

<P>If, therefore, I can't hope to see you soon, I will send you some paâˆ£pers
of our transactions hitherto, though I confess I should be glad to be
the bearer myself, for several reasons. If, therefore, Sir, after the peruâˆ£sal

that you assure us the contents have been and will be punctually obâˆ£served:
it's what your uncle's [the King's] friends hope may be for his
service, though what you say of How's [Harley's] unaccountable methods,
and of his friends growing daily more diffident of him and angry with
him to a great degree; and that Trevor [the Tories], and particularly
Snow [Scotland], are mighty disobliged; and Williamson [the Whigs]
still supported, contrary to all the rules of common prudence, supposing
his intentions to be such as we wish, and such as one would think it is
his real interest they should be; though all this, I say, be very melancholy
and disheartening, yet your uncle [the King] continues still resolved to
try what time, patience, and all good offices, on his side, will produce;
leaving (as you say very well) the event to God Almighty, and to
Charles's [princess Anne] and Honiton's [Harley's] consciences. But
when Proby [the parliament] comes to town, we shall be better able to
judge how matters will go; for it is reasonable to believe, that then or
never some people will show themselves.</P>
<P>The medal you mention to have been sent, the 14th of August,
never came to hand. John [the King] would have valued it for the lady's
sake, who I hope loves him in her heart preferably to Laurence [Hanâˆ£nover].
If it be so, I wish she may show it soon, for time is precious, and
delays in that match may be fatal to both.</P>
<P>May not you get Autry [Auchterhouse] to tell Honiton [Harley]
plainly what his friends complain and blame him for? We hear Autry
<PB N="445" REF="464"/>
has a great intimacy with him, and perhaps he may prevail with him to
alter his methods, when he demonstrates how prejudicial they are to his
credit, and how fatal they may prove to himself, as well as to those who
stick to him.</P>
<P>Jeremy [the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>ing] is well, and goes in a fortnight to see his kind

<P>"I Had a letter, last night, from Noble [Netterville], with the followâˆ£ing
occurrences: That the Emperor and Dutch scorned and conâˆ£temned
of late the Queen and her ministers. He will give Oftend and
all the towns in Flanders to the Dutch, because he thinks he will vex the
English. The Whigs are so sowered against the Tories now, that they
want but strength to rise up in arms. They gave out lately, through the
three kingdoms, the Pretender was turned protestant, to feel the pulse of
<PB N="446" REF="465"/>
the Tories; but, having gained no point by it, they now say it was a reâˆ£port
from Lorrain, and the contrary was wrote from Bar. They brag
they have a faction strong enough, if not to bring over Hannover, to
keep out the Pretender at least this session; in the mean time, the Queen
may die. They'll get the Emperor to hold out another campaign. They
contrive to advance him money, as they have done already. They think
to put the ministry on some extreme, and on a necessity to call France
to their assistance, and consequently bring home the Pretender, hoping
thereby to get the people of their side, as the Tories got them by Dr.
Sacheverel's trial.</P>
<P>The ministry, now seeing they can't bring the Emperor to a peace,
concluded to send Shrewsbury to call a parliament in Ireland, to sit at
the same time with that of England; a thing not usual. They are reâˆ£solved
now to go through stich with the changes through the three kingâˆ£doms.
Tney must now sink or swim with France. The Whigs know it,
and will push them on to it, in order to ruin the Tories; but all to no
purpose. They persuade the German ministers at London, the Emperor
may have the same terms after the next campaign as now. If he loses
ground, the balance is lost; therefore, the ministry must get him the
same terms that was offered at Utrecht, or else the people will fly in their
faces, and oblige them to renew the war, to secure the balance of power.
These arguments, however chimerical in themselves, make an impression
on the Germans, and leave a sting in the minds of the people.</P>
<P>Marlborough desires to go and live in England this winter; but the
Queen can't as much as hear him named. Some few attempted to keep
the princess Sophia's birth-day; but they were affronted. There was
but one flag hung out of one steeple in all the town: a good sign. The
Scots commoners half mild, half stale. The lords right: money will gain
them at any time. Argyle will be soon turned out, and his employment
given to honest men.</P>
<P>The treasurer is mortified at the Emperor, and the Dutch proceedings.
He foresees he can't, as he desired, renew an alliance with them, or bring
them into his measures. The factions were never seen so high as now.
There will be warm doings in both houses. How the treasurer shall stem
the current, you shall know per next, from, &amp;c."</P>

believed the parliament won't sit to act, till after Christmas. They'll
only choose a speaker, and perhaps pass the bill of commerce. The
Scotch commons are most of them Whigs; but the lords have the power
of that kingdom in their hands. The parliament of Ireland mostly
Whigs. Their friends in England will assist to thwart the measures of
the court and embarrass matters. They continue to persuade the Empeâˆ£ror
to offer his niece to the prince of Piedmont, in hopes to get the D.
of Savoy into the alliance again, and make him hold out two campaigns
more. By that time, they hope, either the Queen or the King of France
may drop off, and they'll get a great point by it. They are alarmed more
and more every day to see the Pretender gains ground; therefore, they
double their efforts to roar against him in print.</P>

and Bavaria and other Roman Catholic ministers residing here; and if
they have any confidence in me, I shall have measures sent me, from time
to time, to communicate to them, that may be useful to their masters and
subservient to the consul's interest. I know, Sir, the men in power
would be glad those of his stamp did contribute to restore him to his
consulship, though they dare not appear in the matter bare-facedly, much
less trust any of those foreigners in the circumstances they are now in;
but, as it is a nice thing, I shall not proceed in it, till I know the consul's
sentiments of the matter; besides, none of these foreigners will trust me,
unless I be introduced to them by those that has interest with them: but
we must not lose much time: for I find, by my accounts from home, the
consul's friends begin to be more active, and design to bring things to
bear sooner than it was first proposed. I am desired again to tell you,
Sir, that all those at the helm are unanimously for the consul, and my
friend will answer for it, with his blood. I have no news to send you;
but that I saw letters from Hannover, which say, the Elector will not
send his son to England till he is invited by the Queen and parliament;
nor will he believe what they say to him, unless they do it, or that they
mean him well. He falls in with the sentiments of Whigs, and acts by
their directions. I gave a hint of this to my correspondent, who will imâˆ£prove
it to the consul's advantage. I have given several hints of the
kind of late, that did put some people of power on the tantrums, and
made them jealous of each other, and will spur them on to serve the conâˆ£sul
better than they have done hitherto; to put them out of their road, I
shall not pretend to it, for it will be impossible; they have chosen an unâˆ£common
<PB N="450" REF="469"/>
common one, and won't be beat out of it, but they may be spurred on
in it. You shall have timely notice what to do in it, when matters are
ripe. I am desired to tell the consul, that he must not give ear to the
many scribblers, that pretend to things they know nothing of, for they do
but mislead you and impose on you there. I gave the papers to Mr.
Innes, and desired him to give them into the consul's own hands, and, if
he desired it, to read them to him; and then that you make your reâˆ£marks.
And I hope the consul won't let them go out of his own
hands, or suffer copies to be taken of them, but after he has perused them
to lock them up till I see him: for they will be of use to him hereafter;
depend on it. I shall send you more in a few days, and let you know
the sense of great many of them. If the right use was made of them,
the consul might be at home ere now. I wrote, almost every post, to
my correspondent there; but don't acknowledge the receipt of them. I
would not have him smell a rat, because it might prejudice the consul's
interest. I expect the key you promised to send, Sir, to your true friend

in England.</HEAD>
<P>"ROGERS having, for some years, been educated in Gerard's house
[Germany], Mr. Egleton [the Emperor] recommended him to
Mrs. Strange [princess Sophia], who recommended him to some of our
friends among the Waggs [Whigs], and Egleton [the Emperor] likeâˆ£wise
recommended him to his agent, then residing in Evelin's house
[England]. This gave the said Rogers an opportunity to contract a
<PB N="452" REF="471"/>
friendship and intimacy with the said agent, and the men of business
among the Waggs [Whigs], whereby he had an opportunity of serving
Mr. Jenkins [the King], when Quaint [princess Anne] made the late regulation.</P>
<P>The said Rogers having, by his daily conversation with Quack [Mr.
Pen a Quaker], Noble [Netterville], and others, that were very intiâˆ£mate
with Overton [Mr. Harley] and the rest of his brethren, found their
pulse beat very low, and that they were at a loss to maintain the new reâˆ£gulation; and it was therefore they caressed the agents of Egleton [the
Emperor], and Simon's house [Savoy], to bring them into their interest,
in order for a pardon general [a general peace] with Knox [the King of
France], exclusive of Duncan [the Dutch.]</P>
<P>Rogers, perceiving this would prejudice the interests of Jenkins [the
King], found ways and means to frustrate their design, which he brought
about in the following manner.</P>
<P>He being very intimate with one of the sharpers of Egleton's agent
[secretary of the Emperor's ambassador], who was master of all his soâˆ£phistry
[secrets], got a precept [a paper] which contained in substance,
that the Tanners [Tories] caressed the said agent [minister] then more
than ever, making him great offers, in case he would join with them as
above: but he assured his master Egleton [the Emperor] that such great
offers of the Tanners [Tories] were an infallible sign they were not in a
condition to stand their ground long, and assuring him the Waggs
[Whigs] had laid such a foundation as would turn the stream into its forâˆ£mer
channel; and that there was no reason to apprehend the Tanners
[Tories] would dare to deal separately with Knox [King of France], or
run the risque of giving any jealousy to Anabaptists [the allies], or offendâˆ£ing
the men worthy [the mob].</P>
<P>Rogers, after having got this precept [paper] in his hand, did signify
to Noble, Quack, and Overton [Netterville, Quaker Pen, and Mr.
Harley] that the Waggs [the Whigs], in conjunction with the Anabapâˆ£tists
[the allies], were resolved to supplant Quaint [princess Anne] and
him, and also that it was in his power to let him know all their sophistries
[secrets]; telling withal, that his chief aim in this was purely to serve
Mr. Jenkins [the King], Whereupon Harris [Harley] answered, that
<PB N="453" REF="472"/>
he did not dislike his fidelity to his friends, assuring him that he should
find his account in what service he should do for him and Quaint [the
Queen].</P>
<P>Hereupon Rogers gave him the aforesaid precept [paper], and all the
precepts [papers] that the agent sent to Egleton [the Emperor] and Dunâˆ£can
[the Dutch], from time to time, to the number of about twenty-four;
containing, in substance, the schemes they had laid for continuâˆ£ing
the weather hot [war] or cold. In order thereunto, the agent prepared
a memorandum to be given in Egleton's [the Emperor's] name, to
Quaint [princess Anne]; setting forth, that he could raise treble the allen
[army] he had hitherto. <HI>Nota bene,</HI> that the Agent, at the same time,
advised his master to make large promises, till he could gain his point in
Evelin's house [England]; and afterwards, that ways may be found to
evade the performance of them with credit.</P>
<P>Which was to be printed and published, in order to gain the men
worthy [mob], and exasperate them against Quaint [the princess], Overâˆ£ton
[Harley], and his brethren; and another precept [paper], giving
an account that Simon's house [Savoy] would stick no longer to Egleton's
[the Emperor's] interest, but would look to himself; and another preâˆ£cept
[paper], sent from Riston [the King of Portugal] to Egleton [the
Emperor], importing that he would follow Quaint's [the princess Anne's]
steps. Another precept [paper], proposing a method of removing
Quaint [princess Anne] out of trust [the throne]; and another preâˆ£cept
[paper], containing a method how to prolong the weather hot [war]
for two years longer. These, with many other matters, too long to
mention here, being given by Rogers to Harris [Harley], made such
impression on Quaint [princess Anne], and Overton [Harley], that they
immediately resolved upon dealing even separately with Knox [King of
France].</P>
<P>Rogers, perceiving the agent to be dejected upon account of his beâˆ£ing
slighted on this occasion, discoursed with him as usually, and made
a bye motion to him to reconcile him to Kennedy's [the King's] interest;
but he being so much elated by the repeated assurances of the Waggs
[Whigs], refused to favour it. Whereupon Rogers attacked him anâˆ£other
way, and told him there was a project set on foot by Lewis [old
Danby], Overton [Harley], and the rest of the society, to marry Mr.
<PB N="454" REF="473"/>
Kemp's [the King's sister] to Knell [the King of Sweden]; and, by that
means, to restore him, exclusive of Mrs. Strange [the princess Sophia].</P>
<P>The agent communicated this to his chief confidents among the Waggs
[the Whigs], who were so alarmed at it, that they raised all the Devils
in Hell to prevent it, and said, that of the two evils, they would rather
have Jenkins [the King], though a physician [a Roman Catholic], than
that such a project should take, which would knock all their measures
down at once, and ruin for ever them and their friends the Anabaptists
[the allies].</P>
<P>Whereupon they sent to Hall [Hannover], that he would send his
agent immediately to Evelin's house [England], to take care of his inâˆ£terest;
who, thereupon, gave in a memorandum, which served Quaint
[the princess Anne], Cleveland [cabinet council], and the partners [parâˆ£liament]
to a great degree never to be forgotten. Beaumont [lord Mulâˆ£grave],
Segrave [lord Shrewsbury], and the rest of the society, except
Overton [Harley], were of opinion that the agent should be sent away
with Moulins [a messenger], but Overton [Harley] said it was not seaâˆ£sonable,
for several reasons: First, because the pardon general [general
peace], was not so far advanced as to rely upon Knox [King of France]:
secondly, that it would give a great cause of jealousy to the men worâˆ£thy
[the mob], which may draw them away; and thirdly, because it
would make the jewellers [Jacobites] insolent, and give Kemp [the King]
greater hopes of establishing his interest than otherwise he could expect.
Upon these reasons that business dropt.</P>
<P>The Waggs [Whigs] finding that the memorandum had not the efâˆ£fects
proposed by it, they sent to Evers [prince Eugene] to come with all
speed to Evelin's house [England], in order to lay before Quaint [prinâˆ£cess
Anne] and partners [parliament] the necessity of continuing the
weather hot [war], and how Knox [King of France] bought the pardon
general [peace] for maps [money]; to retrieve which, the Waggs
[Whigs] were sure to carry the point, by the majority they assured
themselves in Holton [house of Lords] and Hungate [house of comâˆ£mons],
by sending two or three of Clevland [cabinet council] to Tracy
[the Tower of London.]</P>
<P>Rogers having an indenture [intelligence] of all this from Egleton's
[Emperor's] agent, then living at Hatton's house [the Hague], gave the
<PB N="455" REF="474"/>
said indenture to Overton [Harley], and the rest of his brethren; upon
which, Moulsworth [lord Churchill] was laid aside, which mightily surâˆ£prised
Evers [prince Eugene] at his arrival. Upon this, Moulsworth
[lord Churchill] told Ivers [prince Eugene], that had he come before
the new dozen were made in Holton [house of lords], all would do well,
and that now more violent measures must be used rather than fail; which
Ivers [prince Eugene] agreed to consult with Jonathan [the junto] and
partners. Whereupon he proposed to gather together a great many of
the men worthy [mob] to be led by some of Jonathan [the junto] and
partners, (to destroy in the night-time, after a frolicksome manner)
Overton [Harley], Hervy [Sir Simon Harcourt], and one or two of his
principal companions: but Hall's [Hannover's] agent, did not approve
of this method, conceiving it would turn the hearts of the men worthy
[mob] against his master, but Jonathan [the junto] and partners being
divided in this:</P>
<P>Ivers [prince Eugene] proposed another way, which was to set fire
to several houses in Little Town [London], and especially near South's
house [St. James's]; and, by this means, raise all the men worthy
[mob]; and the Waggs [Whigs] being sure of the Gapers [Guards],
Quaint [princess Anne], together with the Exchange [Exchequer], and
Tracy [the Tower], were to be seized, and thereupon immediately
new partners [parliament] to be called; but Horn [Halifax], Sands
[Somers], and the late Collier [Chancellor], did not approve of this.</P>
<P>All this Rogers communicated to Overton [Harley], thinking Ivers
[prince Eugene] would be sent to pain [prison]; but finding that Overâˆ£ton
[Harley] shewed it to Quaint [princess Anne] and not to Clevland [cabinet council], he, by Yates [lord Yarmouth], sent, under hand, a
detail of the whole matter to Beaumont [lord Mulgrave] and the present
Collier [lord Keeper], who laid it before Clevland [cabinet council], at
which Overton [Harley] was very much surprised, and started; but told
Clevland [the cabinet council], that he had the same account, which he
gave to Quaint [princess Anne], and another mate [minister of state],
saying that Quaint [princess Anne], finding they were divided among
themselves, thought it more prudent to smother it. To which Clevland
[cabinet council] replied, that it concerned them too near not to sift it to
<PB N="456" REF="475"/>
the bottom; therefore, ordered that Rogers should be called immediately
before them, to give a full account of the whole matter. Overton
[Harley] sent immediately for Rogers, and spoke to him as followeth.</P>
<P>Rogers, you have been betrayed in the sophistry [secret] and precepts
[papers] you gave me; to which Rogers replied, that he gave it by Mr.
Noble's [Netterville's] advice to Farringdon [Ferguson], to lard a preâˆ£cept
[paper] that he had then in hand with the heads of it for Quaint's
[princess Anne's] use; wherewith Overton [Harley] seeming to be satisfied,
asked him what course was proper to take in the matter. Rogers,
knowing what would be acceptable to him, proposed to go with him beâˆ£fore
Quaint [princess Anne] or any of the mates [ministers]; and acâˆ£cordingly
he ordered Rogers to go along with him to Quaint [princess
[Anne]. But Beamont [lord Mulgrave], having a hint of this from
Rogers, underhand, ordered him to come before Clevland [cabinet
council], which he accordingly did, and was examined upon all the preâˆ£cepts
[papers] which he (from time to time, during the space of two
years before), gave Overton [Harley]; and having also declared the
manner of his obtaining them, Clevland [cabinet council] was so much
satisfied therewith, that Rogers was desired to reduce his examination,
which lasted two hours and a half, with all the circumstances, into writâˆ£ing,
and at parting returned him thanks, with a promise of a settlement
during life; and gave positive orders that he should be forthwith sent to
Hassel's house [Holland], to bring back his friend, from whom he had
Ivers's precept [prince Eugene's paper], and to discover further the proâˆ£ceedings
of Duncan [the Dutch] and the Waggs [Whigs].</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that Beamont [lord Mulgrave] whispered Rogers,
that he should be full and particular in his journal, because it would
turn to his own and friend's [the King's] advantage. Overton [Harley]
gave the following reasons against his going to Hassel's house [Holland].
First, that if it should be found out that a physician [Roman Catholic]
should be employed upon such an occasion, at that juncture, it would
give the Waggs [Whigs] an occasion to clamour. Secondly, that it
would be enough to divide the Anabaptists [allies]; and that Evelin's
house [England] would never be trusted hereafter, if they should exâˆ£pose
these sophistries [secrets] before the partners [parliament]: and,
<PB N="457" REF="476"/>
thirdly, that it would give Knox [King of France] an opportunity to
make what portion [peace] he pleased, when he found the Anabaptists
[allies] jealous of each other, and divided among themselves.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding all these reasons, Rogers was ordered to go on
his journey; who, coming to Rymer's house [Rotterdam], he met his
confident, and engaged him to come back to Evelin's house [England],
where he should be provided for during his life. He liked the offer, but
insisted upon having it under the sharper's [secretary of state's] own hand.
This Rogers communicated to Overton [Harley], but had no answer.
It is to be observed, that, notwithstanding these matters did properly
belong to the sharper's [secretary of state's] province, yet Overton [Harâˆ£ley]
took it into his own management, in order to conceal it from Clevâˆ£land
[privy council], and communicate it only to Quaint [princess
Anne], and keep Rogers out of the way as long as he could, to prevent
his being tampered with by Clevland [cabinet council].</P>
<P>Rogers was not long in Hassel's house [Holland], when Ciprian arâˆ£rived
from Putney [Paris] at Hatton's house [the Hague], and gave
three memorandums, one to Harpers [pensionary Heinsius], one to
Hall's agent [Hannover agent], and a third to Egleton's agent [the Emâˆ£peror's
ambassador], containing in substance all what he and his father
transacted in Evelin's house [England]; and that he had contracted in
Knox's [King of France's] name with Clevland [cabinet council], and esâˆ£pecially
with Overton [Harley], for a great quantity of maps [money],
in case he should agree to give a separate portion [peace]; and that
Quaint [princess Anne] desired him to tell Mr. Jenkins [the King] that
she would send for him as soon as possible.</P>
<P>This was acceptable to the above-mentioned three persons, who said
it was the only thing they wanted; and that they had enough to undo
Quaint [princess Anne] and destroy Clevland [the cabinet council], and
prevent the pardon general [the general peace]. Rogers, being apprized
of all this matter, acquainted Overton [Harley] therewith, as he did
likewise Doyle, Peyton, and Mead [marishal D'Uxelles, AbbÃ© Poligâˆ£nac,
and Mr. Menager], assuring them, that now they had a good game
in hand, which, if rightly managed, would turn to Knox's [the King of
France's] advantage, and forward the portion [peace] to their satisfacâˆ£tion.
They asked how? Rogers answered, that Ciprian was to be sent
<PB N="456" REF="477"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="ã€ˆ1 page duplicateã€‰"/>
<PB N="457" REF="478"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="ã€ˆ1 page duplicateã€‰"/>
<PB N="458" REF="479"/>
with good recommendations to Mouldsworth [lord Churchill], and to the
chief of the Waggs [Whigs] dignified with titles of honour and good
characters from Hall [Hannover] and Egleton [the Emperor]; and that
he the said Rogers would go with him to Evelin's house [England],
and introduce him first to Clevland [cabinet council], to let him see all
the precepts [papers] he had along with him, which would be acceptâˆ£able
to Clevland [cabinet council], who would engage him in Quaint's
[princess Anne's] interest, in order to expose the sophistry [secret] of the
Waggs [Whigs] and Duncan [Dutch], and lay the same before the partâˆ£ners
[parliament], which would infallibly give them a plausible handle
to destroy the shape of Hall [succession of Hannover].</P>
<P>Mead [Monsieur Menager] replied, that it was not prudent to hazard
the breaking the measures so well concerted, wherein Rogers had a good
share; and the said Mead [Monsieur Menager] well understood that
Rogers aimed at the immediate restoration of Kennedy [the King] to his
trust [throne], and said Knox [the King of France] would take care of
that, after finishing the pardon general [the general peace]. Rogers anâˆ£swered,
that now was the proper time, and that such a favourable occaâˆ£sion
would never offer again; and told them, that he would send Ciprian
to Stapleton [lord Strafford], who went the day before to Hassel's house
[Holland]; upon this, the three retiring aside, and consulting a while
together, they told Rogers, that Tradenham [Monsieur de Torcy] sent
for Ciprian, in order to give him new instructions to take care of his affairs
in Evelin's house [England]; and, by that means, he might have a better
opportunity of serving both Knox [King of France] and Kennedy's [the
King's] interests.</P>
<P>They, finding that poor Ciprian did bite at this bait, very wisely sent
him away to Putney [Paris], not doubting his sincerity.</P>
<P>But Rogers, having a watchful eye upon him, and discovering his inâˆ£tentions
of going directly to the Waggs [Whigs], got him, by a straâˆ£tagem,
to Hassel's house [Holland], and acquainted Stapleton [lord
Strafford] with the whole matter; who approved of Rogers' conduct, in
sending him to Clevland [cabinet council]; and offered to send Moulins
[a messenger] along with him; but Ciprian shewing Harper [Heinsius]
the orders which Doyle [Mareschal D'Uxelles] and his companions gave
<PB N="459" REF="480"/>
for going first to Tradenham [Monsieur de Torcy] to receive his instrucâˆ£tions,
he approved of it, and desired him to go with speed; and promisâˆ£ing
him all the humour [honour] and pinimo [pension] he could desire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. B. Ciprian having proposed Rogers to vouch the truth of his allegation, Harper [Heinsius] consulted with, the agents of Hall and Egleton about securing Rogers; but he being apprized of it, avoided the snare.</NOTE>.
So he accordingly went to Tradenham [Monsieur de Torcy], and how
he was received the reader knows.</P>
<P>Upon this, Rogers told Doyles [Mareschal D'Uxelles] and his fellows,
that a good scheme was spoiled, if this fellow should be kept in pain
[prison]; and that it was sacrificing Kennedy's [the King's] interest to
theirs, at present. To which Doyles [Mareschal D'Uxelles] replied, that
Quaint [princess Anne] and Knox [King of France] would do his [the
King's] business in due time; and said, that, for his part, he would be
sure to acquaint Knox [King of France] how active Rogers has been in
his and Kemp's [the King's] affairs, both there and in Evelin's house [Engâˆ£land];
and that he acted like a man of honour, especially in this particular.</P>
<P>Rogers finding that all the parleys [plots] he proposed, for a present
replication [restoration], must be laid aside for a time, he thought of
another, which he expected may turn to as good account, which is as
follows.</P>
<P>During his abode in Hassel's house [Holland], he luckily met with a
relation of his own, who was conversant with the principal men that goâˆ£verned
that house [state], and found, by his friend's and his own observâˆ£ation,
that Hassel's house [Holland] was governed by Waggs [Whigs]
and Tanners [Tories], as well as Evelin's house [England]; and that the
Waggs [Whigs] are the persons now in vogue; and that the Tanners
[Tories] being in obscurity during this long reckoning [revolution] were
meditating a long time to bring about a replication [restoration] there,
after the same manner as in Evelin's house [England].</P>
<P>Rogers, being introduced by his friend to the chief of these Tanners
[Tories] found, by discoursing with them, that they wanted only a little
map [money] to compass their ends; wherein there was no difficulty, as
in Evelin's house [England]. He, upon this, proposed to Knox's [King
<PB N="460" REF="481"/>
of France's] agents, among them, to supply them; and having prevailed
with them to send to the said persons, who came and made out that they
could infallibly do it without noise or stir, by bestowing a small matter on
such as should be stubborn; with this the agents [ambassadors] seemed
well pleased, and assured them, that Knox [King of France] should be
acquainted with their good intention; but Peyton [AbbÃ© Polignac] told
Rogers, that he believed Knox [King of France] would hardly hear of
this proposal, without first consulting the mates [ministers] of Evelin's
house [England]. Rogers replied, that he would send to get Clevland's
[cabinet council] consent, but he was called away before he could have
an answer. He acquainted Clevland [cabinet council] therewith, which
was well approved of; but Overton [Harley] said, that the portion
[peace] was far advanced, and it would be better to defer it till after the
pardon general [general peace], because it would weaken the politician
[protestant] interest abroad; saying, that although Duncan [the Dutch]
should be humbled, yet Knox [the King of France] should not be
exalted.</P>
<P>Rogers, seeing that Knox [the King of France], in conjunction with
Overton [Harley], was intent upon securing their own game, did resolve
to ply Overton [Harley] warmly, by setting Clevland [cabinet council]
upon his back; which he did, by communicating to Beaumont [lord
Mulgrave], by Yates [lord Yarmouth], what he wrote to Overton [Harley],
from time to time, during his abode at Hassel's house [Holland], viz.</P>
<P>First, that Moulsworth [lord Churchill] wrote to Harper [Hensius] and
Evers [prince Eugene] not to let the foreign allen [army] in Quaint's
[princess] Anne's service obey Overbury [duke of Ormond], thinking
thereby to prevent Knox [King of France] giving up Dean's house [Dunâˆ£kirk]
to Quaint; and this would give the Waggs [Whigs] a plausible
handle to send Overton [Harley] and one or two more to Tracy [the
Tower] and consequently would be a good excuse for Knox [King of
France] to abandon Quaint.</P>
<P>Secondly, he discovered at Hatton's house [the Hague] the new plan
framed by Moulsworth [lord Churchill], Horn [Halifax], and Sands
[Somers], for bringing Hall [Hannover] to Evelin's house [England],
by publishing a model [a manifesto], containing that Kennedy [the King]
was coming from Fitches' house [France] with a physician allen [a
<PB N="461" REF="482"/>
Roman Catholic army], and arrived at Sutler's house [Scotland]; and that
Hall [Hannover] was arrived at Evelin's house [England], to secure the
copyhold [crown] against Kemp [the King], and that Moulsworth [lord
Churchill] was to have a good allen [army] of his own. By this means,
they did not doubt but the unthinking menworthy [mob] would join
them, and that Quaint [princess Anne], upon this occasion, would doubtâˆ£less
escape, as Mr. Kemp [the late King] did at the late reckoning [Reâˆ£volution].</P>
<P>This plausible project was sent to Mrs. Strange [princess Sophia], not
doubting of her approbation, and give her consent to young Hall [Hanâˆ£nover]
going to Evelin's house [England].</P>
<P>But the more penetrating heads among the Waggs [Whigs] advised
her, underhand, to be wary in so important an affair, and avoid all things
that would give the Tanners [Tories] a good pretence to alter the shape
[succession].</P>
<P>Hall [Hannover] sent his agent to know the strength of the Waggs
[Whigs], and in case he found their interest to be as they represented it,
he was to be governed by them, and accordingly the agent keeps very
close to them, who are fully resolved to pave the way for Hall [Hanâˆ£nover]
this summer of partners [session of parliament].</P>
<P>By this they propose to gain two points; first, in case the Tanners
[Tories] oppose it, then it's clear they are for Kennedy [the King], which
will give umbrage to the menworthy [mob], and draw them away from
the Tanners [Tories]. Secondly, They expect to have a majority among
the next partners [parliament].</P>
<P>Rogers wrote to Overton [Harley], that the person from whom he had
all these sophistries [secrets] should be sent to Evelin's house [England]
to prove it <HI>viva voce;</HI> but had no answer while he was at Hassel's house
[Holland], which may fall heavy on him hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>HANNOVER PAPERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>1713.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1713" UNIT="year"/> TO throw light on the Hannover papers of the present year, it is
necessary to premise a few particulars. The baron de Bernsdorff
was president of the Elector's council, and M. de Robethon secretary for
embassies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Secretaire des ambassades.</NOTE>. Baron de Grote was his Electoral Highness's envoy at the
court of London in the beginning of the present year. Grote died in
the month of April, and was succeeded by M. de Schutz, whose father
had been in England some years before in the same character. Kreyenberg
was ordinary resident, and Galke secretary to the embassy. It does not
appear that Monsieur l'Hermitage acted in any public character from the
court of Hannover: he was probably connected with the Dutch embassy;
at least, his business obliged him to go sometimes to Holland. The letâˆ£ters
from London, said to have been sent by a <HI>secret address,</HI> were usually
directed to Mr. Siffen at the Hague.</P>
<P>The baron de Bothmar was the Elector's envoy extraordinary at the
Hague, and his minister plenipotentiary at the treaty of Utrecht. Klinâˆ£graff
was resident, and Schrader secretary to the embassy. The originals
of all Bothmar's letters to Robethon are extant, and likewise the originals
of most of the letters written to him by Schutz, Kreyenberg, and Galke;
but of some of them we have only copies in Robethon's hand, which he
decyphered for the use of the Elector and his ministers. They frequently
refer him for further particulars to their letters to Bothmar. Bothmar
sent him copies of these letters, decyphered in Schrader's hand, and usuâˆ£ally
marked in his own hand at the top, the date of the letter and the
name of the writer. As these copies are extant, we have probably all
the letters written by the Hannoverian agents from this country, from
<PB N="463" REF="484"/>
the beginning of April this year to the accession of George I. in August,
1714.</P>
<P>They, indeed, wrote regularly, by every post, to the Elector himself,
what they called a narrative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Une relation.</NOTE>; but in their letters to Bothmar, Bernsdorff,
and Robethon, they generally repeat in a summary manner what they
wrote at greater length to their master. As either the originals or auâˆ£thentic
copies of all their letters are extant, we are probably acquainted
with the whole subject of their correspondence, during a period, in which
the protestant succession was thought to be in the utmost danger, and deâˆ£signs
were actually formed for bringing in the Pretender.</P>
<P>They sent by every post a very particular account of parliamentary
proceedings: but it differs in nothing from what is publickly known;
and therefore has been entirely omitted. But every thing that they wrote,
of the private characters and conduct of the great men, who flourished at
this period, has been carefully extracted; and we know, at least, what
the Hannoverians thought of them, and in what light they were repreâˆ£sented
by others.</P>
<P>De Grote was sent to Great Britain to obtain a pension for the princess
Sophia, and the arrears claimed by the Elector, as due to his troops which
served in Flanders, and to insist upon the Pretender's removal from Lorâˆ£rain.
The court of Hannover, ignorant of that prince's attachment to
the principles imbibed in his youth, were alarmed this year with rumours
of his conversion; and directions were sent to Grote to propose some
measures which they thought necessary to be taken in such an event.</P>
<P>The earl of Oxford made a motion in parliament, in the following
year, which, at the time, greatly surprised the nation: but now the true
cause of that measure sufficiently appears. The Whigs had invited the
Elector of Hannover to invade Great Britain, with an army. They, at
the same time, endeavoured to show, that Oxford meant only to amuse
the people, by an affected zeal for the protestant succession, to conceal his
real designs in favour of the Pretender. The motion bore, that, for the
further security of the succession, it should be made high treason to bring
foreign troops into the kingdom. A law against bringing troops into
<PB N="464" REF="485"/>
Great Britain, to support the cause of the Pretender, was unnecessary;
since such troops, if foreigners, might be treated as enemies; and as naâˆ£tives,
might be punished as rebels. Therefore, the design of the earl of
Oxford was to allude, in his motion, to the scheme of the Whigs to
bring over the Elector in a hostile manner.</P>
<P>The Queen, in her speech to the parliament, which met on the ninth
of April in the present year, expressed great zeal for the succession in the
house of Hannover. But the friends of that family considered the speech
itself, and the consequent address of the two houses, as an artful design of
the minister to deceive the nation. The agents of Hannover, convinced of
this circumstance by the Whigs, represented to their court, the necessity of
taking some step to bring the sincerity of these professions to such a proof
as would convince the world, that neither friendship nor harmony subâˆ£sisted
between the Queen and her ministers and the parliamentary heirs of
the crown.</P>
<P>The following letters were written by M. de Robethon, at Hannover,
to the Baron de Grote, in London, in January and February. They are
in Robethon's hand, in French; but decyphered by an unknown hand.</P>

<P>"I Doubt not but this will find your Excellency arrived in London.
Some time ago, I hinted to Monsieur l'Hermitage to speak to lord
Halifax, of a design which suggested itself to me, and which, having met
since with the approbation of all our ministers, I have orders to write to
you about. It is to sound lord Halifax and other friends, if they could
propose, in both houses, to bring in a bill excluÌ„ding the Pretender, and
any other Papist who has pretensions to the succession, with their posteâˆ£rity,
even though he should become a Protestant.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="486"/>
The reasons for such an act are so strong, on account of the rumours
which circulate about the prince of Wales in this respect, and of the
alarms which these rumours give the nation, that I do not see they can
venture to make great opposition to such a salutary scheme. If the act
passes, we gain every material point for our succession; if the Queen's
ministers oppose it, that will unmasque them, and contribute, more effecâˆ£tually
than any tiling else, to open the eyes of the nation. Please write to
me what our friends say on the subject.</P>
<P>I am likewise to tell your Excellency, that remarks on the project of a
Barrier Treaty, proposed to the Dutch by lord Strafford, are sent this
evening to the Baron de Bothmar. We have made seven or eight corâˆ£rections,
short indeed, but essential to our succession; and lent an orâˆ£der
to Monsieur de Bothmar, to persuade the grand pensionary to try to
prevail with the Queen's ministers to admit these corrections. Your Exâˆ£cellency
will receive a copy of them by the next post; not in order to
speak of them to the Queen's ministers, for you know that the treaty was
not communicated to us by them, but in order to make use of them hereâˆ£after,
when the opportunity offers, which can scarcely miss: and, in the
mean time, you are desired to communicate these corrections to lord
Halifax and other friends, and to write to us their opinion of them.
I am, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"LORD Oxford had mentioned the treaty of guarantee of the sucâˆ£cession
to Kreyenberg, and consequently would probably mention
it to Grote. Robethon desires Grote to propose to his lordship, in the
politest manner he could, to insert the corrections and additions which he
had mentioned in his preceding letter, and of which he now sends him a
copy. He complains of it, as an omission very offensive to them, that
there was no mention of the Pretender in the treaty; and desires to
have the person known under the name of the Chevalier de St. George
particularly specified; "if it is in earnest they have abjured the Chevaâˆ£lier;
if it is in earnest they demand from France to remove him, and not
to assist him; they cannot refuse to mention him in the treaty of guarantee
of our succession. It is to be hoped the lord treasurer will repair the
<PB N="466" REF="487"/>
omission of such an essential clause, and pay attention to the just remonâˆ£strances
of your Excellency on the subject."</P>
<P>Your Excellency may be assured, that in the act which establishes the
succession, and in all the acts which have been made since concerning it,
even at the time when the Whigs had all the power in their hands, there
never was a clause inserted for excluding the Pretender in case he turned
Protestant; which, however, would be very necessary. It will be said,
perhaps, that the popish lords likewise, who might be converted, would
be excluded thereby from the house of peers. But there is a great difâˆ£ference
between the sovereign and an individual. The Pretender, on the
slightest appearance of a pretended conversion, might ruin all, the reliâˆ£gion,
the liberties, the privileges of the nation, &amp;c. This is not the case
of a lord, and therefore it is not parallel. Besides, when they exclude
the Pretender, in such a case they may, if they chuse, make an exception
in favour of the lords who would change. Your Excellency will speak
of all this to persons more capable of judging of it, than I am."</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. x. Bothmar, No. 6.</NOTE>â€”January 10th, 1713.â€”De Grote had given an account of his arâˆ£rival
in London. "What you say of the violence of the English is very
true; and the Electoral Prince, to whom I read your letter, thinks that
your judgment of them is very just.</P>
<P>With regard to the passage in cypher, all the ministers of his Electoral
Highness think lord Halifax a very proper person to make a proposal to
Harley<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Earl of Oxford.</NOTE>, who consulted him, and to speak to him, both about the
pension for the Electress, and about the exclusion of the Pretender, to
be inserted in the treaty of peace. Your Excellency will be so good as
to converse on this subject with lord Halifax: he always paid great atâˆ£tention
to Harley, who cannot take it amiss that he should enter into these
affairs. Besides, he may speak of them to him as of himself, and not
at our desire.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Bothmar writes to me, and all our ministers agree with
him, that it would be proper to exclude from the crown, by act of parâˆ£liament,
all those who, after compleating their tenth year, continue to
profess the popish religion."</P>

write to you by the next post, if the sentiments of lord Somers, conâˆ£cerning
the pension, are approved of here. I am very anxious about
what the lord treasurer will say to you on the subject.</P>
<P>They write us from Paris, that the Pretender is getting himself inâˆ£structed
in the religion of the church of England, and discovers he finds
great satisfaction in it. This doubles the necessity of an act to exclude
him, even in case of his conversion."</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="letter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. x. Bothmar, No. 10.</NOTE>â€”January 17th, 1713.â€”"All our ministers order me to tell you,
it is their opinion, that you should conform yourself to the sentiments of
lord Somers, concerning the pension for the Electress; and that you
should, by no means, offer to lord Oxford, that the Queen and he should
dispose of the offices of the household. You will recollect that that offer
was a thought of the Electress alone, who insisted to add it to your inâˆ£structions;
and did so principally because she had spoke in that strain to
that Harley who was here, with whom she is highly dissatisfied at preâˆ£sent;
that gentleman, notwithstanding all his fine protestations, not havâˆ£ing
written even once since his departure from Hannover.</P>
<P>We have received no intelligence by the means of the duke of Marlâˆ£borough.
It is very proper to put a stop to the frequent visits of lord
Sunderland, without disobliging him however. If the affair of the penâˆ£sion
succeeds, you will be exalted to the third heavens. I hope you shall
have your share of it; and I therefore prefer it, in all respects, to the
affair of the arrears. I would not say so, however, toâ€”."</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="letter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 13.</NOTE>â€”January 24th, 1713.â€”"It would be an excellent thing, no doubt,
to oblige France to send the Pretender to Rome; and you must neglect
nothing that will induce the British court to demand it.</P>
<P>Such is the spirit of oeconomy here, especially since the speedy return
of our troops is looked for, that you must not expect the Elector will put
his hand to his pocket, even for a master-stroke of party <HI>(coup de partie),</HI>
such as would be, beyond contradiction, to gain the duke of Argyle and
his brother; although, according to Bernsdorff, there is not room to heâˆ£sitate
a moment."</P>
<P>"Another proof of this" (spirit of oeconomy, continues Robethon)
"is that the president told me, that having insisted with OUR MASTER for
some extraordinary allowance for your Excellency, on account of your
<PB N="468" REF="489"/>
journey to London, and to enable you to settle there, the answer was
a flat denial, and that he would not give a penny above what the late
M. de Schutz had."</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="letter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. x. Bothmar, No. 14.</NOTE>January 27th, 1713.â€”"I judge of Oxford's intentions, from the
pains which he takes to avoid you. You cannot be too diffident of him,
and you must take care that we are not duped by him. We may depend
upon it, that Oxford is too far engaged with France and the Queen, to
dare to be able to withdraw; and even though he inclined it, it would be
impossible for him to bring back the Queen to proper measures; so that
all he would gain, would be to meet with the same fate with Godolphin
and Marlborough.</P>
<P>On this account, and with this precaution, the attentions which you
propose to show to that minister, and the manner in which you intend to
behave to the Queen's ministers in general, are greatly approved of here;
and it gives great satisfaction, that you are agreeable to Halifax and other
friends.</P>
<P>With regard to the pension, we think here, that Sunderland and Soâˆ£mers
reason much better on the subject than Halifax; for, upon the supâˆ£position,
which is but too probable, of the lord treasurer's intentions, the
great aim should be to unmask him and the other ministers publickly,
and to open the eyes of the nation, which cannot be done but by the
means of some such business as this, brought before the parliament:
whereas, whatever the Queen's ministers may be entreated to obtain from
France about the removal of the Pretender, or to add to the Barrier
Treaty, will not strike the people, and will be liable to chicane; and
consequently now, when the nation is alarmed on all sides with the Preâˆ£tender,
is the proper time to bring an affair of this kind before the parâˆ£liament.</P>
<P>I refer myself, on this subject, to the rescript which you will receive,
signed by our master, and add only that Bernsdorf, in particular, recomâˆ£mends
to you strongly, what regards Argyle and his brother, and to see
if, by the hopes you shall give them both of a pension, in case the parâˆ£liament,
by their interest, shall grant a pension to the Electress, you can
obtain some important service from them. This in reality is a capital
point.</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="490"/>
If Oxford continues to avoid you, as I imagine he will, and if Bolingâˆ£broke
does so likewise, you need not be afraid of giving offence to the
Whigs by your familiarity with these ministers. I have no hopes of our
arrears.</P>
<P>You will see, by the rescript of our master, that lord Halifax's advice
concerning the Barrier Treaty, and the sending the Pretender into Italy,
has been entirely followed; and that it is wished you would propose to our
friends to move in parliament for a bill to exclude him, in case of his
conversion.</P>
<P>Be so good as to thank lord justice Parker, for his good advice, and
(how him that it has been regarded. What does Nottingham do? Have
you seen L'Hermitage? His Electoral Highness recommends to you in
a very particular manner, the article which regards the duke of Argyle,
and to make his compliments to his Grace.</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Reden told me the other day, that the Electress said
lately, more than once, at a full table, that she had sent you a new reâˆ£gency;
reproaching herself for having put in so many Whigs. You see
how we are placed. Judge if Mr. Winde and secretary D'Alais would
neglect to write this to London; and is it not possible that the knowledge
which the Queen's ministers have of it, may occasion the objections they
propose to make to the registration, and have suggested these good adâˆ£vices
from the Whigs?"</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>Copy of the Rescript, signed by the Elector, as mentioned above.</HEAD>
<P>"We understand, with pleasure, by your private letters, that the
duke of Argyle and his brother appeared disposed to court your acquaintâˆ£ance,
and to give proofs of their zeal. The credit of his Grace must
naturally be so great in Scotland, after the death of the Queen, that you
can never pay too much attention to any favourable dispositions which he
may discover to you. You will assure him of the very particular regard
we have for his person, and also for his brother. If you observe that
they act sincerely, we believe you may entreat them, when the proper time
comes, to employ their credit to get an act, settling a pension on the
Electress, passed in parliament; promising, in case the affair succeeds,
to give them, from that fund, pensions proportioned to the importance of
<PB N="470" REF="491"/>
the service they will render her. You will easily comprehend, that you
must make these promises in the name of the Electress."</P>
<P>"I must tell you," continues Robethon, in a postscript to de Grote,
"by order of our ministers, who have all signed the minute of this reâˆ£script,
that the Elector approves very much of the contents, but said, that
it was the Electress who should sign it. The ministers did not at all
choose to speak about it to the Electress; because the affair would unâˆ£doubtedly
be very soon made public. They entreat you however to conâˆ£form
yourself entirely to this rescript; being very well persuaded, that,
instead of being disavowed, you will be commended by the Electress, if
the affair of the pension succeeds. It is in this case clear, that Argyle
and his brother are to be rewarded with pensions."</P>

treaty, with regard to the quarantee of our succession, is much approved
of here. I see the lord treasurer seemed to pay some attention to them.
We must wait the issue. You are desired to insist, that the Pretender may
be mentioned in that treaty, and mentioned under the title of the person
who usurps the name and dignity of James the Third King of Great
Britain; and that it may be added, that it is principally against him,
that the Queen requires of the States, to quarantee the succession estaâˆ£blished
in the house of Hannover.</P>
<P>All your reflections, concerning a design of a bill to exclude the Preâˆ£tender
and other Papists, in case they turn Protestants, are approved of.
The ministers make this additional reflection, that it would call our right
in question, by supposing, that there were cases in which that right might
be doubtful and require explanation, which we must never suppose, or
put in question. The Pretender's being excluded and abjured, after the
strongest form, in all cases, and without restriction or reserve, should be
sufficient. You are, therefore, desired to drop the design of speaking of
it to our friends, much less to the Queen's ministers. I imagine Halifax
will be of this opinion."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Original. Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar x. No. 22.</NOTE>The Queen's ministers are attached to the Pretender.â€”The Whigs propose to
the Elector to go over with a body of troops to England.â€”Grote is directed
to demand a pension for the Princess Sophia, and to insist upon the Preâˆ£tender's
removal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Robethon's hand, in French.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>â€”February 17, 1713.â€”"THE principal reason for the change of
the Queen's ministry, was the design of
establishing the Pretender; scruples were then raised in the Queen's mind
concerning him, and lord Jersey endeavoured to serve him, long before
the memorial was presented by the baron de Bothmar. They have exâˆ£erted
themselves to bring about a peace, merely to pave the way for the
prince of Wales. That memorial had, at least, the effect of making the
Queen's ministers proceed with more caution, and if we had done nothing,
all the consequence would have been, that these gentlemen, meeting
with no obstacles, would have accomplished their design much sooner.</P>
<P>That lord Oxford is devoted irrecoverably to the Pretender and to the
King of France, is what we had no doubts of long ago, although his
cousin, when he was at Hannover, endeavoured to impose, in that respect,
upon the Electress and the Electoral Prince, with whom I did not choose
to dispute the subject, for they would not have failed to reproach me with
my partiality for the Whigs, and I choose rather to wait, until your Exâˆ£cellency,
having observed the matter yourself, should bear testimony to
this incontestible truth.</P>
<P>With regard to the project of going over with a body of troops now to
England, Monsieur de Bernsdorff would have wished, that all that passage
had been written in cyphers rather than any other; and his Excellency
orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="â€¢â€¢"/> me to tell you, that as that design requires absolutely the conâˆ£currence
of the States General, and their men of war, it is impossible to
think of it at present; since the States General give their whole attenâˆ£tion
now to hasten the peace, and to gain the good graces of the Queen
and of her ministry, imagining they have done enough for us, when they
signed the treaty guaranteeing the succession. We must, therefore, acâˆ£cording
to Mr. de Bernsdorff, give time to the States General and to the
<PB N="473" REF="494"/>
English nation, to be sensible of the pernicious consequences of the peace,
and then we may take juster measures.</P>
<P>The question is, if the King of France will not, in the mean time, estaâˆ£blish
the Pretender by force; but how can we do otherwise? If the
Queen dies before the Pretender arrives, all things will be easier, and the
States will be obliged, by their guarantee, to assist us. But it is the opiâˆ£nion
of Monsieur de Bernstorff, that if it was necessary during the Queen's
life time, to take such measures against her Majesty and her ministers, we
would meet with terrible difficulties from the party in the nation who
love the Queen; besides, it is almost certain, the Elector, in that case,
will never bring himself to such a resolution. This your Excellency will
very easily conceive; but we have every reason to hope, that, in case of
the Queen's death, the Elector will do whatever can be expected from
him, of which your Excellency may, if you please, give assurances to
our friends.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Bernstorff judges the scheme of having ships of war from
the King of Denmark, totally impossible."</P>

sent from the Hague, by general Schulenburg; what they contain conâˆ£cerning
the sentiments of Oxford and Bollingbroke towards the Pretenâˆ£der,
was well known here already, and it will be a foundation to go upon
for the future: but it is not at all admitted, that the sentiments of those
two Jacobite lords must be attributed to the memorial of Monsieur de
Bothmar. And with regard to the proposals of the Whigs, contained in
the end of these dispatches," viz. the sending over troops to England,
"I must refer myself to what I had the honour of writing to you about
them, the thing being impracticable without the concurrence of the States

<P>It is principally in the name of the Electress, that your Excellency must
negociate the affair of the pension, and it is much wished here, that you
may present the memorial you have ready on the subject, before the

the lord treasurer in mind, that his cousin assured the Electress, more
than once, that the affair of the pension was very reasonable, and could not
be refused, promising, that he himself would forward it when he returned,

with the Queen. This is strongly recommended to you. I also
write about it, by order of his Electoral Highness, to the baron de Bothâˆ£mar,
and to the duke of Marlborough."</P>
<P>â€”"Monsieur de Bernstorff orders me to repeat to you, that the
project of going over with a body of troops now into England, is absolutely
impracticable, because the thing is impossible, without the ships of the
States General, who are very far from being disposed, at present, to emâˆ£bark
in such an affair; and indeed, it is all they could do, if they saw the
Pretender actually in England. They are afraid for themselves. As
<PB N="475" REF="496"/>
long then as the Queen lives and the Pretender is out of England, and
while the Queen makes no direct attack upon the rights of her Electoral
Highness, it is not to be imagined, that the Elector will enter into the
measures proposed by the Whigs, who are generally too sanguine.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Bernstorff is very angry to find, by Monsieur de Bothmar's
letters, that the Whigs communicated schemes of this kind to general
Schulenburgh. It is probable he will not make a proper use of this
confidence, and that abbÃ© Passionei, the Pope's nuntio at Utrecht, being
his intimate friend, is informed of it by this time.</P>
<P>The Electress and the Electoral Prince are entirely undeceived in their
opinion of lord Oxford, since his fine discourse to your Excellency about
the pension of the Electress. They could have wished here, that at the
first conversation, in which your Excellency spoke to lord Oxford of the
pension, you had delivered to him the memorial on the subject; because
lord Oxford not relishing it, and the memorial being presented to him
however, after it was known that he received it unwillingly, would say,
perhaps, that we wanted to vex him; but to this, in my opinion, no atâˆ£tention
should be paid at all, in this affair, nor in that of removing the

concerning the measures to be taken upon the Queen's death.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>"THE Queen's situation obliges us to desire you to ask the answer
of lord Sunderland, lord Somers, lord Halifax, and lord Townsâˆ£hend,
to what follows.</P>
<P>What are the steps in general which we should take here, after we have
received the news of the Queen's death?</P>
<P>What procurations, patents, or orders, should we have ready to be sent
then, wherever it will be necessary?</P>
<P>Mr. Bernstorff is of opinion, that, in case of the Queen's death, as the
Electress cannot set out immediately, nor travel with the necessary disâˆ£patch,
the Elector, or, on his refusal, the Electoral Prince, should set out
<PB N="476" REF="497"/>
for London, without the loss of a moment; and that, on the first news
of the Queen's death, ships should be kept in readiness in Holland, for
the security of his passage.</P>
<P>We ask, in that case,</P>
<P>1. What kind of procuration should the Elector or the Electoral
Prince have from the Electress? How far should it extend? Should it
authorize him to disolve the parliament and to call another; to dispose
of all places; to imprison suspected persons, &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. We ask, If the Electress, after the Queen's death, can establish,
until she arrives in London, a different regency from that which is apâˆ£pointed
in the instruments now in England, or at least, add to it or reâˆ£trench
from it, as she chuses?</P>
<P>3. In case the Queen dies before your Excellency has changed the inâˆ£struments,
can you still establish as regents the lords named in the last
instruments, and make them valid?</P>
<P>4. Can the Electress, after the Queen's death, authorise the Elector to
dismiss this regency, and take the government into his own hands, comâˆ£posing
his privy council of such persons as he shall think deserving?</P>
<P>5. If it is necessary, that the regency should subsist until the Electress
arrives; we ask what share of the government can the Elector or the
Electoral Prince have, jointly with the regents?</P>
<P>At the same time that the Electress sets out for London, Monsieur de
Bernstorff would have the Electoral Prince or duke Ernest to repair to
Ghent, Bruges and Dunkirk; in order to secure those three towns, place
good governours in them, and administer oaths to the English troops
which garrison them.</P>
<P>6. We ask, how should the order be drawn out which the Electress
will give to the prince whom we shall charge with this commission?</P>
<P>M. de Bernstorff wants that Mr. Cadogan should be at hand to go
over to England upon the first notice of the Queen's death, furnished
with the necessary orders from the Electress, for taking the oaths of the
troops in England, breaking the suspected officers, filling up their places,
securing the tower of London, &amp;c. We would choose to have these
orders for Mr. Cadogan, with patents of the offices which will be given
<PB N="477" REF="498"/>
to him, ready in the hands of the baron de Bothmar, in Holland. Bothâˆ£mar
will speak on this subject to Cadogan, who goes to Holland now from
the duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>We shall endeavour to know from the duke of Marlborough, by the
means of Cadogan, what part he would choose to act, in case of the
Queen's death. If he would go directly to London, being one of the
regents, or go along with the Elector. Robethon hath already written,

<P>Lastly, we ask similar explanations concerning the internal affairs of

<P>We ask, if the Queen being dead, the Electress should write to the
lord mayor of London, and in what strain?"</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>A copy of the preceding Queries was sent to Bothmar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar 10. No. 14.</NOTE> at the Hague,
to be communicated to Mr. Cadogan, who was to come to Holland on
a commission from the duke of Marlborough; and Bothmar, in a letter to
Robethon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 138.</NOTE> on the 18th and in a postscript to it on the 25th of March,
gives him Cadogan's and Marlborough's answer to these queries.</P>
<P>It was the duke's opinion, that the Elector should go to England imâˆ£mediately,
upon the Queen's death, with full powers from the Electress,
as her lieutenant general. The Kings of England, he said, frequently
invested lieutenants to govern the kingdom, in their absence, with all the
authority and power they possessed themselves.</P>
<P>Cadogan thought, that the Electoral Prince should not go to take the
command of the English troops on the continent; but that Bothmar
should provisionally have powers in his hands to authorize the duke of
Marlborough and himself (Cadogan), to secure these troops and the
fortresses they garrison. If the Electress did not choose to sign a comâˆ£mission
of that kind, it would be sufficient to have one signed by the
Elector, in her name. The troops, upon seeing a parchment with the
great seal of his Electoral Highness would readily obey a man so agreeâˆ£able
to them as the duke of Marlborough. It was not necessary to folâˆ£low
<PB N="478" REF="499"/>
the form used in commissions of that kind in England, nor to write
one in English, The duke of Marlborough's commission and his own
were in England, and he could not send copies of them; but it would be
sufficient to say in the new patent, that he was now invested with the
same powers he had formerly from the Queen.</P>
<P>When the duke of Marlborough was sure of the fidelity of the troops
abroad, he might follow the Elector into England, and leave the Elecâˆ£toral
Prince with Cadogan to command the troops.</P>
<P>Cadagon thought it was very necessary, that he himself should have the
commission of lieutenant general and governour of the tower, under the
duke of Marlborough or the Electoral Prince. Bothmar, however, was
not thoroughly convinced of that necessity.</P>
<P>Cadogan gave Bothmar the character of some officers. Colonel Choâˆ£lomondely,
who commanded the second battalion of Guards, which went
back to England, was attached to the Protestant succession, and the two
battalions, officers, and men, might be depended upon. Major general
Sabin who commanded at Ghent, a timid man, but well affected at the
bottom, and might be managed. Brigadier Sutton, who commanded at
Bruges, was entirely dependent on the ministry; but to make amends,
colonel Hill, who commanded the regiment of royal Scots, might be deâˆ£pended
on. The commandant at Dunkirk, a Scotchman, and two batâˆ£talions
of that nation, were thorough Jacobites; but the eight English
battalions were well affected, and would give a very good account of the
other two, and of their commandant.</P>
<P>Cadogan concluded, with recommending, from the duke of Marlâˆ£borough,
that his Electoral Highness should have some one with the Preâˆ£tender,
to send exact and speedy intelligence of every thing that hapâˆ£pened.
The duke offered to find a proper person, if the Elector would
lay out fifty louis-d'ors a month, and in the mean time, he would endeaâˆ£vour
to have some news of what was done openly at the Pretender's
court.</P>
<P>Bothmar writes, in his postscript, that Cadogan approved of the comâˆ£missions
sent to Marlborough and to himself: he gives it as his opinion,
that Cadogan should be employed to command the troops abroad, that
there might be an opportunity of doing something at home for Mr.
Stanhope, who was well affected, and a man of abilities.</P>
<Q><PB N="479" REF="500"/><P>"Mr. Cadogan," says Bothmar, "has named to me the three corresâˆ£pondents,
who may be employed to procure intelligence of the Preâˆ£tender.</P>
<P>1. One of the magistrates of Huy, who is a capital enemy of
the Jesuits, and is, for that reason, called the messenger of the Janseâˆ£nists.</P>
<P>2. An Irish officer of the name of Carol, who professes the Popish
religion, but is a Protestant in his heart, and who has friends and relations
at the Pretender's court.</P>
<P>3. A Lorrain gentleman, who served in the army, and whose name
was Remiremont. He had forgot his real name.</P>
<P>These correspondents are to address their letters to M. Sapporin, diâˆ£rector

<P>"I send you likewise, the form of a commission in Latin, for constituting
the Elector or the Electoral Prince, after the Queen's death, <HI>Custos regni</HI>

was drawn up by these three persons, with great care. There
are, besides, two other commissions; one in Latin, for a lord lieutenant
of Ireland, and the other in English, for a captain general, such as the
Duke of Marlborough has been. I shall send you likewise, in a few

hope that will be sufficient to instruct the court of Hannover, in every
thing they can do, after the Queen's death and before the successor arâˆ£rives

<P>"Since it is so difficult for the Elector to contribute to the expence of
the ensuing elections, all friends agree to make another proposal to him,
which is of greater consequence, and which appears to them to be absoâˆ£lutely
necessary. It is to send over the Electoral Prince. It is true, an
invitation by a vote of parliament was formerly spoke of; but all friends
are unanimously of opinion, that such an invitation, in the present situaâˆ£tion
of affairs, in such a parliament and under the influence of such a
ministry, is impracticable."</P>
<P>"They are of opinion, that the Electoral Prince, being a peer of the
realm, and his precedency as a prince of the blood having been reguâˆ£lated
by act of parliament, has so many just pretexts and reasons for
coming, that those who should oppose him, would thereby do themselves
the greatest injury which their greatest enemies could wish them. If the
Elector will consent to this point, it will give such support to the friends
of the succession, that the other affair of the money will not be necessary.

<P>HE had sent the preceding letter with the commissions, &amp;c. by a
gentleman belonging to the deceased baron de Grote. He promises
again in this letter to send the other commissions soon, and urges, by a
repetition of his former arguments, the necessity of sending over the Elecâˆ£toral
Prince, "as a sure and easy, and as perhaps the only means of
saving the succession. This journey must not be delayed in hopes of an
invitation, which is absolutely impracticable. If the prince was once
here, it is the opinion of all his friends, that they would easily obtain
any pension they would choose, and in a manner suitable to the dignity
of the family.</P>
<P>With regard to the removing the prince of Wales, they will not fail to
propose it in the strongest manner in parliament. If they carry it, it will
be a great point gained; if they lose it, it will be so much the worse for
those who shall oppose them: for they shall be exposed thereby to the inâˆ£dignation
of the people in the elections."</P>

Elector's friends in England, and sent by Lord Sunderland to the Baron de
Bothmar at the Hague.</HEAD>
<P>"THE following considerations will possibly furnish a more clear and
useful answer to the queries proposed, than strictly pursuing the
order of the queries, and breaking that which will be offered, into sepaâˆ£rate
answers, to each distinct particular.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="505"/>
1. The instrument for nominating lords justices ought to be sealed up,
and deposited with the archbishop, &amp;c. during her Majesty's life, or their
validity will be too doubtful to be depended upon: for the instruments
already sealed up and deposited are effectual appointments of lords jusâˆ£tices,
until revoked or altered; and when there is an intention to revoke
or alter them, the Act, page 227, appoints a particular method how
that is to be effected, by three writings, under hand and seal, requiring
them to be delivered up; and till that be done, by the express words of
the Act, page 228, the instruments, sealed up and deposited as aforeâˆ£said,
are those which are directed to be brought before the privy council,
there to be opened and read, and afterwards to be inrolled in Chancery.
And, therefore, as often as it shall be thought fit to make any alteration
in the three instruments, it ought to be kept in mind, that the alteration
is incompleat, and that nothing is in effect done till the old instruments
are taken up, and the new sealed up, and deposited in their place; and
that during the Queen's life, in Robethon's hand.</P>
<P>2. In case of the demise of her Majesty, the regency established by the
act of parliament may be entirely abolished, by the successor, before her
or his arrival in Great Britain. The Kings and Queens of England have,
by the common law, a power to constitute a regency in their absence, in
such manner as is afore-mentioned; and this regency, established by this
act, was not intended as any diminution of the royal power, but is merely
provisional, to prevent an inter-regnum before the successor could arrive
in person, or constitute a regency; and, when either of those things hapâˆ£pen,
the end designed by it is fully attained: accordingly by the express
words of the Act, in the clause page 226, which makes the seven officers
lords justices, they are appointed lords justices, and impowered to exeâˆ£cute
all acts of government, (no longer than) until such successor shall
arrive, or otherwise determine their authority. And by the next clause,
the persons nominated in the three instruments are only to be added to
the seven, and to act with them as lords justices as fully, and in the same
manner, as if they had been particularly named in the Act; and conseâˆ£quently,
their authority will be liable to be determined in the same manâˆ£ner
as the authority of the seven who are particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>But whether some of the regents may be removed from the regency,
after they have once entered upon it, without abolishing the whole, is
<PB N="485" REF="506"/>
doubtful. The successor's arrival of course determines the authority of
them all; and whether the power of determining their authority otherâˆ£wise
(as the words of the act run), mean not a like determination of the
authority of them all, is not clear enough to be depended upon in a matâˆ£ter
of this consequence. It is yet more doubtful, whether those who are
lords justices by virtue of the act, either the seven officers, or those
named in the three instruments, can act together, with any others to be
added anew to them by the successor, after they shall have entered upon
their office.</P>
<P>Therefore, in case it should be thought requisite to remove any of the
old, or to add any new, the safest way will be, to determine the whole
regency, and constitute one or more person or persons lord justice or lords
justices, with or without restraints, and with such directions as shall be
thought fit.</P>
<P>3. The successor's power to determine the authority of the lords jusâˆ£tices
appointed by the act, before her arrival in Great Britain, supposes
the power to appoint <HI>a new one or new ones by the common law.</HI> And in
case of the demise of her Majesty during the life of the Electress, it is
agreeable to law, and seems in itself proper and requisite, that she should
appoint the Elector, her son, or the Electoral Prince, her grandson, Lord
Justice of Great Britain, <HI>Custos Regni et Locum tenens,</HI> with power and
directions, in case he shall see it fit and convenient, to dissolve and deterâˆ£mine
the privy council, and appoint a new one; to dissolve the parliaâˆ£ment,
and call a new one; to remove all officers, and dispose of all offices
and employments in the disposal of the crown (which will extend to those
of the seven regents not for life); and to execute and do all other acts of
government in the name and stead of the new succeeding Queen, as if she
were present in person. That she may do this, before her arrival in
Great Britain, is plain, because it is a proper regal act, often done by
the Kings of England; and the clause, page 231, which gives force and
effect to such seal as the succeeding Queen or King shall make use of, to
affix to any instrument to execute and do any regal act, proves that such
succeeding Queen or King may do regal acts before her or his arrival in
Great Britain. That the privy council may be determined, appears page
225, where it is continued six months, unless sooner determined by the
next successor.

<P><PB N="486" REF="509"/>
That all officers, not for life, may be removed, and others put in
their places, appears by the same clause; and it is to be noted, that in
that clause concerning the continuance of officers of the privy council,
all the officers appointed regents, except the archbishop, and the chief
justice, are expresly named. Therefore, it is to be observed, they may
be removed from their offices, though it be doubtful whether they can
be removed from the regency, while it continues; and it seems plain,
that the removal of them from their offices, does not of itself remove
them from the regency, nor will their successors become lords justices,
in virtue of their succeeding to those offices, for the regency is not anâˆ£nexed
to their offices to go along therewith; but, page 226, the seven
officers after-named, who shall be in possession of their offices at the time
of such demise of her Majesty, are appointed lords justices until the sucâˆ£cessor
shall arrive, or otherwise determine their authority, where it apâˆ£pears,
that those who shall succeed to those offices are not within the
words, to be lords justices, because not in possession of those offices at
the time of the demise of her Majesty; and those who were in possession
at the time of such demise are continued until the successor arrive, or
otherwise determine (not their offices, but) their authority; <HI>i. e.</HI> their auâˆ£thority
of lords justices.</P>
<P>That the parliament may be dissolved, is certain; and may be colâˆ£lected
from page 228, where the regents, constituted lords justices by
the act, are restrained from dissolving the parliament, without express diâˆ£rection
from such succeeding Queen or King: therefore, by such direcâˆ£tion,
those lords justices may dissolve it; and much more, therefore, may
another lord justice, appointed by the succeeding Queen or King, not
under the restraints laid by the act, upon the provisional regency.</P>
<P>4. The prince so appointed lord justice, <HI>Custos regni et locum tenens,</HI>
may, by virtue thereof, take upon him the whole government; and upon
his so doing, and producing his patent, the regency appointed by the act
will be determined. However, it may be proper to have an express
clause for determining the regency inserted in the patent, to prevent all
doubts in that case, and nothing more is requisite to the abolishing the
regency.</P>
<P>5. The acts done by such lord justice, pursuant to his authority, will,
in law, be the acts of the sovereign, however the privy council, the parâˆ£liament,
<PB N="487" REF="510"/>
and officers being appointed, to continue for some time, unless
sooner determined, dissolved, or removed, by the next successor. To
leave no room for doubt, it may be proper to insert express powers and
directions, for the lord justice to dissolve and determine the privy counâˆ£cil,
to dissolve the parliament, and to remove officers if he shall see fit.</P>
<P>6. The removing of any officers in the disposition of the crown, and
appointing new ones, is a regal act, which may be done abroad, taking
care to declare of what effect the seal whereby the instrument is sealed
shall be. And as to offices to be executed in Great Britain, the instruâˆ£ment
granting the office, or directing the regents to grant the office, may
be sent over before the next successor or the <HI>Custos regni</HI> can arrive; conâˆ£sequently,
a captain general may be abroad appointed to command the
forces abroad, and to secure their fidelity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The regency will have power sufficient as to the forces in Great Briâˆ£tain;
but yet the successor may appoint a captain general for them too,
if it shall be thought requisite.</P>
<P>7. A particular power to seize and imprison suspected persons, will be
neither necessary nor useful, the ordinary magistrates have sufficient
powers for that purpose.</P>
<P>8. It is to be observed, once for all, that any dormant instrument for
any of the purposes aforesaid, sealed during her Majesty's life, will be of
no force by the laws of Great Britain."</P>

Kreyenberg proposed, that they themselves should make some
motion in parliament, which they knew the ministry would reject. This
would discover the insincerity of their protestations. They answered,
that the ministry would then represent them as seditious in the eyes of
the nation, who believed implicitly the Queen's declaration, and as deâˆ£signing
to create a misunderstanding between the two courts; and they
gave it as their opinion, that the Electoral Prince should take advantage
of the Queen's declaration, and come over to England, which would
greatly embarrass the ministry."</P>

<P>"THE Queen's speech, which you have already received, is very artâˆ£fully
composed to blind the eyes of the people; especially the arâˆ£ticle
which insinuates, that there subsists a perfect understanding between
her Majesty and their Electoral Highnesses, as if the Queen did nothing
without consulting the Elector; when, at the same time, she has not even
a minister at Hannover.</P>
<P>Eight of your principal friends, who dined together on Thursday, at
my lord Halifax's, have given me in charge to tell you, that there will be
no resource, unless the Electoral Prince is sent over soon. All these fine
compliments to the Electoral family, which are contained in the Queen's
speech, and in the address of the two houses, should encourage your
<PB N="490" REF="513"/>
court to approve of this journey, and they furnish the most natural preâˆ£text
in the world; which is, to come in person, to acknowledge thankâˆ£fully
such obliging declarations, and pretend to consider them as very
sincere: for it is but just to pay the dissimulation of the Queen and of
the treasurer in the same coin. And his Electoral Highness cannot but
be sensible of the unbecoming manner in which they treat him, by pubâˆ£lishing
from the throne, that they do nothing but in concert with him;
while they neglect to give the least answer to the two memorials, presented
by the deceased M. de Grote, concerning the removal of the Pretender
and the pension of the Electress; and while they sacrifice entirely, at
Utrecht, the interests of his electorate, and of his office as high treaâˆ£surer
of the empire.</P>
<P>At any rate, here is the finest opportunity in the world, to catch lord
Oxford in his own snare. It would seem that Providence presents it to
you. For God's sake, do not neglect it; for when you would choose to
recur to it hereafter, it may be too late.</P>
<P>The prince does not require an order to come here, either the invitaâˆ£tion
of the parliament, which is not to be expected from a parliament so
ill composed as the present, or the permission of the Queen, which most
assuredly she will not grant, if it is asked. He is entirely at liberty to
come of his own accord, being naturalized, and being duke of Camâˆ£bridge
and a member in the house of peers, and his rank as prince of the
blood being settled. The Queen herself cannot forbid him according
to the laws, neither to come into the kingdoms, nor to take his seat in
parliament; and her Majesty and her ministers, after such public and
solemn declarations, which the Queen and the two houses have lately
made, cannot retract themselves, and will be obliged to receive the prince
well, while every one will turn to him, as to the rising sun, seeing the
Queen's health is so broken.</P>
<P>My lord Halifax told me, that the friends would by no means proâˆ£pose
in parliament, that it would be necessary to have some one of the
Electoral family in this country; for that would be questioning a right,
which your princes have obtained, and give a handle to parliament to
take, in that respect, some improper resolution, which might render the
coming of the prince more difficult; neither will they speak of the penâˆ£sion
<PB N="491" REF="514"/>
for the Electress; but I believe they will bring the removal of the
Pretender upon the carpet.</P>
<P>The friends are very desirous, that the Elector should immediately reâˆ£solve
to send over the prince, in order that he may arrive during the preâˆ£sent
session of parliament, which will not continue but two months, and
may take his seat in the house of peers, not in order to vote with the
Whigs, and against the court, but in order to take possession of what is
due to him; and to convince the nation of the falsehood of the rumours
they circulated, that the Elector is indifferent about the crown of Engâˆ£land.
For, in other respects, our friends agree, that the Prince should
make his court to the Queen, pay attention to the ministers, caress every
one without distinction of party, and refrain from coming to the house
when party questions are debated, since he would be obliged, if he came
on such occasions, to vote either against the court, or against the friends
of the succession.</P>
<P>That the nation is for the Electoral family, and against the Pretender,
is evident now to a demonstration, since the court imagines they cannot
carry the ensuing elections, but by means of her Majesty's declarations
in favour of the family; and the members of the house of commons,
that they may be chosen again for the next parliament, cover themselves,
in their addresses, with the same mask of a pretended zeal for the proâˆ£testant
succession: an example, which will be followed, in all the
addresses that will be presented, on the peace, from all parts of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>The lord treasurer publishes every where in the counties, that his
Electoral Highness is in perfect concert with the Queen, and will be very
well pleased, that the members recommended by the court should be
chosen. This artifice succeeds to the treasurer's satisfaction in many
places; and as he has, besides, money to lay out, and is very liberal of
it on such occasions; the Whigs are discouraged thereby from offering
themselves to be chosen, from the fear of being disappointed. So that
there is a danger of having a new parliament as devoted to the ministers
as the present; after which, these ministers being absolute masters for
three years, will easily accomplish their pernicious designs, and establish
the Pretender in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="515"/>
The presence of the Electoral Prince in the kingdom,<MILESTONE N="May." UNIT="month"/> will be sufficient
to defeat this plan of the ministers. It will encourage the Whigs to get
themselves chosen, and they will chearfully take upon themselves all the
expence of the elections, without asking any thing from his Electoral
Highness. The presence of the prince will alone have a mighty influence
on the elections, and gain over to the well-affected party an infinite numâˆ£ber,
who follow the court only because they are not supported by the
successor, and are in the mistaken notion of the Elector's neglecting the
affairs of England. All these fears will vanish. Every one will attach
himself to the prince, and by that means we shall have a good parliaâˆ£ment;
after which, his Electoral Highness may decide in it as he chooses,
both with regard to the affairs of the succession and the affairs of Europe.</P>
<P>The sending the Electoral Prince then is an infallible remedy against
present evils, and against such as are dreaded hereafter. It is easy,
it is natural, it is unexpensive, and without any risk in the present conâˆ£juncture;
insomuch, that I cannot conceal from you, that if our
friends, who ask it with so much earnestness, see they are refused, they
will believe themselves absolutely abandoned, they will hope for no furâˆ£ther
resource, they will lose courage, and take their own measures.</P>
<P>Lord Halifax would have the prince to come post, with a valet de
chambre and two footmen, under another name, without his order of the
garter, and without liveries, and take his passage in the pacquet boat,
with a passport from lord Strafford, procured under a borrowed name.
The rest of his servants and baggage would follow. In short, the only
question is, to come speedily and secretly, and every thing will go well."</P>

<P>THE Electoral Prince should come of his own accord. The present
parliament will never invite him. The Queen will be angry if
they should force her to invite him; and if the parliament should reject
a motion of addressing the Queen to invite him, the prince could not
come again with any propriety; whereas, no one can take it amiss if he
should come in consequence of the Queen's speech. It is necessary eiâˆ£ther
to send the prince, or to undeceive the nation by a manifesto, denying
the good understanding which the Queen pretends to subsist between her
<PB N="493" REF="516"/>
and the Electoral family. But this last measure will occasion an open
rupture with the Queen, and may be attended with a thousand inconâˆ£veniencies.
"Send over, therefore, the prince: for the safety of Engâˆ£land,
or to speak more properly, of Europe, and your own safety is at
stake; for if you abandon the crown to the Pretender, you cannot save
yourselves. The prince should have letters from the Elector and from
the Electress for the Queen, and likewise for the treasurer; and the
letters for him must be very flattering, testifying the greatest confiâˆ£dence

<P>"AS our envoy in England is dead, I imagine that you will allow me

her Majesty has been pleased to make to the parliament, in my faâˆ£vour,

I shall be attached to her, with all imaginable respect, as long as I live.
â€”I have been much scandalized by a book which has been sent
to me called "Free-thinker." Although it is very natural for every
one to think as he chooses; yet, in a well-governed state, every one
should not have the liberty of publishing his opinion; and I imagine that
is not allowed in England. Poor Mr. D'Alais is so scrupulous, that for

<P>"LOrd Anglesea is determined to drive the lord Treasurer to extremiâˆ£ties,
and has been, for some time, in strict connection with the
duke of Argyle. This earl is one of the greatest Tories, and is not a
good tempered man. He is very haughty, and very ambitious. He is
one of the most active men in the world, and does not deviate an inch
from what he hath once undertaken: and being very clever, there is
reason to think that the Treasurer will not consider him as an indifferent
enemy, and that his hatred will give him room for serious reflections.</P>
<P>This nobleman is offended at the haughty manner in which the Treaâˆ£surer
treated him; and because he discovered that the Treasurer designs
to bring over the Pretender, whom he does not favour, though he is

deep in all the other schemes of the Tories: but it is said he has estates
in Ireland, which he would be in danger of losing, if the Pretender came
over.</P>
<P>The treasurer has discovered long ago, that he is neither loved nor
esteemed by any party. The affront he lately received, when the treaty
of commerce was thrown out, makes him sensible of the danger to which
he is exposed, and will hasten the execution of his design of bringing
over the Pretender, to which the Queen's state of health will be a further
inducement. The King of France likewise is offended for losing the
advantages he would have obtained by that treaty, and will contribute
every thing in his power to send over the Pretender. The presence of
the prince, is the only remedy against thefe and other evils."</P>

the emoluments of government, which will not perhaps be so considerâˆ£able.
The Treasurer having proposed a reconciliation with the Whigs
after their fall, they assured him, that they would willingly renounce all
pretensions to offices, and support his measures with all their force, if
he would humble France, and free them from their fears of the Pretender.
But he laughed at their offers, and followed a different plan; in conseâˆ£quence

<P>"HIS Electoral Highness having assured our friends, by the late
baron de Grote, that he will never abandon them; and that on
the Queen's death, he would do every thing which the nation could exâˆ£pect
from him; and having renewed these assurances, after the death of
de Grote, by his resident Kreyenberg, in the strongest and most positive
manner, it would be surprising, that they should doubt of these assurâˆ£ances
from a prince who is known to be a religious observer of his
word.</P>
<P>The Elector does the greatest service to the well-affected in England,
which the state of affairs in Europe in general, and his own particular
situation will allow, when he engages the Emperor and the Empire to
continue the war against France, and employs 17,000 of his own troops
against that kingdom. This puts it out of the King of France's power
to send an army with the Pretender into England, and it is not to be
supposed that he will venture to go without a French army, since he is
proscribed by the laws, and has the nation against him. If he does, will
the friends of the succession, who are so rich, and have so much influâˆ£ence,
and have the nation and the laws on their side, lose courage and
submit immediately, when their religion, their laws, their property, and
their liberties are at stake? especially when they are sure of speedy assistâˆ£ance
from the Elector. The nation must exert itself, for the Elector
cannot save them against their will.</P>
<P>The Elector is at so much expence on the troops he employs on the
Rhine, that he cannot give the money demanded for the elections. Beâˆ£sides,
he should fail infallibly, as the court would always have the heaâˆ£viest
purse, and such a measure could never be kept so secret as not to
give great offence to the English ministry.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="521"/>
There are several objections against sending the Electoral Prince.
There can be no security for a safe passage. It will be impossible for
him to go secretly. The ministry might put obstacles in his way; and
they might subject him to mortifications after his arrival. The Elector
has been so often amused these two years, with false intelligence of the
Queen's health, that he does not know but her death may be still very
distant; and it would be imprudent in him, upon an uncertainty, to
expose his only son and the only hope of his family."</P>

<P>"I Had the honour of your letter of the first of August. There is no
doubt but that, if the Queen happens to die before the ministers
here have adjusted their measures with France, for bringing over the
prince of Wales, the friends of the family here will have strength enough
to support their cause until the Elector arrives, and they are all of opiâˆ£nion
that the presence of the Elector would be infinitely more useful
than that of the Electoral Prince, not only in that case, but even at this
very time. But as they imagine that the Elector would not choose to
come before the Queen's death, they proposed that the Electoral Prince
should come, as he has such a just pretext for this, which regards himâˆ£self
alone, being a peer of the realm; and they propose this not only in
view of the Queen's dying soon, for the danger is then by no means so
great, but in order to have a support, and some one to counteract the
designs of the ministry, who will use the authority of the Queen while
she lives; the administration of affairs, which the laws place in their
hands, for concerting such measures with France, that the Pretender will
be here in an instant, and then it will be too late to prevent him.</P>
<P>All this is so clear to common sense, and must be particularly so to
the Elector, who knows better than any one the engagements of the miâˆ£nistry
with France, that it is very surprising he should hesitate a moâˆ£ment,
and from any jealousy he may have of the Electoral Prince. If
he will come himself, as I had often the honour to tell you, all his
friends will rejoice at it more than at the coming of the Electoral Prince.
But if he will neither come himself nor send the Electoral Prince, I assure
you that all friends, of all ranks, will consider themselves as abandoned.
Perhaps this will not be relished at Hannover; but I would not be a
faithful servant to the Elector and to the Protestant succession, if I did
not acquaint you with the just state of the affair.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <DATELINE>Cleves, <DATE>Sept. 12th, 1713.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"AS I am encouraged from your Electoral Highness to give my opiâˆ£nion
of the affairs of England, I shall take the liberty to tell
<PB N="501" REF="524"/>
you, that the changes which happened, are founded solely upon the enâˆ£mity
of the earl of Oxford against the duke of Marlborough. To renâˆ£der
that great General useless, Oxford advised the Queen to finish the
war, and conclude a peace with France; and, to gain the favour of the
people, he provided for the payment of ten millions of debt, by estaâˆ£blishing
the South Sea company; gaining, at the same time, the Clergy
of the church of England, by building fifty new churches, and by other
methods sufficiently known.</P>
<P>He hath likewise drawn the Jacobites into his party, by conniving at
their hopes and at their views for the Pretender, in order to alarm thereâˆ£by
your illustrious house. But, in my humble opinion, your Electoral
Highness should employ all sorts of means to engage Oxford and his
friends in your interests; promising to continue them in their offices, and
to protect them against Marlborough and his adherents, after the death
of the Queen; for I don't believe that lord Oxford and his friends are
for the Pretender; all he did was from a hatred to Marlborough, and to
revenge himself of one, who had disgraced him with the Queen."</P>
<P>Jacob Mears advises the Elector to employ some men of address in
England, with powers from him to gain the leaders of the Tories, by
promises and money, who might easily be prevailed upon to abandon the
Pretender, and would then dispose the Queen to be favourable to his
Electoral Highness. He thinks the Electoral Prince should go over, and
gives directions about his behaviour in England.</P>
<P>"I submit all this to the great prudence of your Electoral Highness,
and am always ready to obey your orders; and if your Electoral Highâˆ£ness
chooses that I should come to Hannover before I go over to England,
I am ready to obey, and to have the honour of going for your commands,
entreating your Electoral Highness to conceal my name and my person.
I shall wait at Cleves for an answer to this letter."</P>
<P>"To prevent him from coming here," says Robethon, in a note at
the end of this letter, "I wrote to him, thanking him very gravely, and
telling him that he might go to England when he pleased, and that if
he learned any thing which concerned the service of your Electoral Highâˆ£ness,
he might give information of it to the resident Kreyenberg."</P>

and Monsieur Galke, secretary of the embassy in London, to Bothmar at
the Hague, and Robethon in Hannover. Containing several particulars concerning their secret intrigues in
England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sept. and Oct. 1713.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the death of the Baron de Grote, the Elector had no one to reâˆ£present
him in England but his ordinary resident Kreyenberg. Galke
was only secretary to the embassy, and Monsieur 'Hermitage does not
appear to have been in any public character from the court of Hannover.
Baron deSchutz, whose father had been envoy at London, was sent thither,
with the same character, in the beginning of September. His first letter
to Robethon is dated from the Hague on the 12th.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 38.</NOTE> He acknowledges
himself obliged to Robethon for his employment. He wrote him anoâˆ£ther
letter on the 14th, and gave him an account of a conversation with
Mr. Cadogan.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 40.</NOTE> "He (Cadogan) approves entirely of the plan of uniting
ourselves with the Tories, of whom some are for our succession, and
others dissatisfied with the Queen and with the ministry, and he thinks
that the motions we choose to make in the ensuing parliament should be
proposed by them, and not by the Whigs. He recommends Mr. Hutchiâˆ£son
as a fit person for that purpose; being an avowed Tory, and having
great credit among the party."</P>
<P>"He believes the duke of Ormond is well affected towards our sucâˆ£cession;
but he apprehends he may be led, on account of his strong enâˆ£gagements
with the lord treasurer, and as he is not capable of resisting,
by a solid reasoning. He describes the duke of Argyle as a man entirely
led by his ambition: he believes, however, that, the ministry having
broken their word to him, he may support, at least for some time, the
party he has lately embraced, and by whom he was very well received,
although he was well known to them. Cadogan accuses him of having
been one of the principal instruments who contributed to all the changes
which happened for some years back, from personal hatred, and to satisfy
his ambition."</P>
<P>Cadogan considered as the greatest advantage to their party, the conâˆ£tinuance
of the war of the Empire against France, and the death of the
King of France, or of the Queen, or of the Pretender. The first was
<PB N="503" REF="526"/>
old, the second was sickly, and the third was consumptive. The Queen,
he said, GOT DRUNK every day, as a remedy against the gout in her
stomach.</P>

<P>THIS letter regards almost entirely his journey and arrival in London, and Kreyenberg having placed the lottery tickets belonging to the
Electress in the hands of Mr. Strafford, a merchant, who failed some time
ago, and some other private business. "The duke of Argyle continues
to be on very bad terms with lord Oxford. Neither the one nor the other
are now in town. It is believed that Sir Thomas Hanmer is entirely reâˆ£conciled
with lord Oxford. L'Hermitage assures me, that the ministry

<P>"I Have it from very good authority, that the Queen is altogether
prejudiced against our family, and that the impressions they have
given her in that way are so strong, that it is judged impossible to efface
them. Lord Oxford leads her implicitly; making her believe that all
his measures were necessary to preserve her crown, after having perâˆ£suaded
her that the Whigs had a design of depriving her of it. One is at a
loss what character to give of this man. He told a stranger, who wanted
to put him on his guard against some one, "I never trusted any one; I
am determined not to trust any one for the future; consequently no one
deceived me, or can deceive me." He promises the same thing to five
different persons, which, at least, will procure him four enemies for one
friend. Plessen promised to give me notice in time; but we see one anoâˆ£ther
but seldom, and in public we pretend to be scarcely acquainted."</P>

<P>"MR. Cadogan told me, that Sir Thomas Hanmer is not satisfied with
the treasurer: for he pretends never to have received any thing
from him, and says, it is not in the treasurer's power to prevent his being
speaker. As Hanmer is very selfish, one cannot depend upon his conâˆ£tinuing
firm.</P>
<P>Lord Bolingbroke came to see Cadogan immediately upon his arrival,
to ask if he would choose to be presented to the Queen, which was to
have been done the day before yesterday, by the duke of Ormond. He

<P>"THE avowed Jacobites speak with assurance of the Pretender's reâˆ£turn;
but they are divided in their opinion of the manner. The
most unreasonable among them would choose that, without depending
upon a powerful party here, he should come with a considerable body of
troops from France. Others, lest they should alarm the people, want
that he should come alone, after having written to the Queen, representâˆ£ing
to her his right to the crown, in the most submissive and affecting
manner: for they suppose that the Queen would propose him to the
parliament, which, they flatter themselves, will be devoted to the court,
and disposed to infringe the act of succession.</P>
<P>Such a representation, in their opinion, would have so much the greater
influence on the Queen's mind, that it is certain she attributes the loss of
her children to the dethroning of her father; having been very sensibly
touched with an affecting letter which he wrote to her before his death,
and in which he recommended his family to her. It was brought to her
<PB N="505" REF="528"/>
by Madam Oglethrope, who went twice to France. These things are
communicated to several persons, in order to found them, and partly in
order to take the necessary precautions and measures against the objections
which are made to them; and lastly, in order to find out if measures are
concerted for opposing them. I have all this from lord Portmore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His lordship's authority is good. He was himself a Jacobite.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Monsieur de Plesse, or de Plessen, as his name is sometimes written,
had been of the prince of Denmark's household. He had entered into
a secret correspondence with the Elector's agents in London, unknown to
the Queen and to the ministry, to whom it appears he had constant
access.</P>
<P>"Although he (Plessen) discoursed with the Queen about the prince of
Wales, during an hour, for three following days, he was not able to
obtain any answer from her, when he turned the discourse to the Elecâˆ£toral
family of Hannover; but her Majesty began constantly to speak of
something else."</P>

<P>"I AM assured from all hands, especially by those who had business to
transact with the treasurer, that it is impossible to comprehend the
answers he gives, much less to put them afterwards in writing. Besides,
he frequently gives such as have no connexion with the proposals which
were made to him. Again, when he takes me aside, and appears to speak

leaves me, and bows to the right and to the left to those who come in.

in the next parliament than in the last; but he has a very bad opinion of
it. He considers the efforts made in Scotland for breaking the union, as
proceeding from the instigations of the lord treasurer; because after that,
it will be more easy for him to bring in the Pretender. In short, his
opinion is, that if things continue never so short a time upon the preâˆ£sent
footing, the Elector will not come to the crown, unless he comes with
an army. He believes the greatest number of the country gentlemen are
rather against us than for us; but, to make amends, he assures that the

<P>"MR. Cadogan told me, this morning, that on a jaunt to the country
to see his friends, and, among others, lord Sunderland, he had
employed to very good purpose the arguments with which you furnished
him in writing, when he passed through the Hague. He recommends
again to employ 6 or 7000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, to secure, thereby, six or seven
voices in the house of peers, which will secure us a majority against
the treaty of commerce, and against the attempts which may be made to
infringe the succession. For he says, it is a certain fact, that several peers,
wanting a livelihood, are obliged, in order to have wherewith to subsist,
to take pensions from the court, and to vote as it orders them. He
hopes Sir Thomas Hanmer may be gained, and he designs to found him
by the means of two of his friends, with whom he is to pass some days.</P>
<P>L'Hermitage, who will not go any more to Hannover, tells me, that
if our court is not at this expence, to gain some members in the house of
peers, who will prefer 400<HI>l.</HI> Sterling from us, to 1000<HI>l.</HI> from the Queen,
we will ruin ourselves and our friends in this country. Mr. Cadogan inâˆ£treats
you much to represent the consequence of all this to our court.

<P>"THE duke of Argyle having sent for Kreyenberg to his countryâˆ£house,

that the Queen would not change the five among the sixteen Scotch
peers, whose names Kreyenberg sent already, He looks upon the earl of

Breadalbin, though his near relation, and also upon the earls of Dunâˆ£donald
and Dunmore, as avowed Jacobites; and he is afraid lord Selkirk
and lord Portmore will follow the ministry.</P>
<P>He spoke to the Queen, some time ago, concerning his brother lord
Hay; saying, that he flattered himself that her Majesty would be pleased
to employ him in the ensuing parliament. But he says she answered
coolly, that she had not yet come to any resolution concerning the Scotch
peers. When lord Hay spoke of it to the lord treasurer, he answered,
that he did not design to meddle in these things.</P>
<P>The duke of Argyle assures, that he spoke several times, for some
months, to the Queen, and discovered to her his apprehensions from the
Pretender; adding, that he suspected even some persons about her Maâˆ£jesty.
To which her Majesty answered, sometimes by a sneering smile,
and sometimes by saying to him, How can any one entertain such

<Q REND="inline">"They reason differently about lady Jersey's journey to France. Some
maintain, that she went only to obtain some money which her late husâˆ£band

He was, in his reign, envoy and ambassador extraordinary to the States General, one of the plenipotenâˆ£tiaries for the treaty of Ryswick, ambassador extraordinary to the court of France, secreâˆ£tary of state, and chamberlain of his Majesty's household. He died on the 28th of August, 1711, the day he was to have been named lord privy seal. He had married Barbara Chifâˆ£finch, daughter to William Chiffinch, Esq; closet-keeper to King Charles II.</NOTE>; and, as a proof of this,
<PB N="508" REF="531"/>
they observe, that, notwithstanding the great oeconomy with which he
lived, no ready money was found by him at his death: others pretend
that she went in order to be at a distance from her creditors; and lastly,
others say, that it was to be among the first to make her court, and to
offer her second son in Lorrain. The relations of the young man waited
on lord Bolingbroke, to entreat him to send after him, and bring him
back hither, and hinder him from following his mother to France; but
before those who were sent to take him arrived at Dover, he had left it."</Q></P>

was at Windsor to take leave of lady Masham."</Q></P>
<P>There are other two letters from Schutz of this date;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 79 and 81.</NOTE> one in French to
Robethon, and one in High Dutch to president Bernsdorff. He complains,
that he frequently spoke to Monsieur Kreyenberg about the 400 lottery
tickets belonging to the Electress, but without success. He believes that
Kreyenberg's affairs are in bad order; for he owned to him the loss of
5000 <HI>l.</HI> which he had trusted to Strafford. He begs that his own exâˆ£pences
should be considered, and entitle him to a greater allowance, espeâˆ£cially
as every thing was very dear.</P>
<Q><P>"I know too well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Translation from the High Dutch.</NOTE> from experience, that when I shall spend all my

master with activity and zeal, one must ruin his health and lose his moâˆ£ney,
I truly think, that nothing but an extravagant, not to say a foolish,
desire can induce any one to accept such services. You may depend
upon it, that the four weeks I have passed here, cost me already, after
deducting all extraordinary expences, 200 guineas. Now, judge you,

<P>"LORD Halifax received, with the utmost gratitude, the compliâˆ£ments
and assurances which I gave him from the Elector; declarâˆ£ing
to me his willingness to sacrifice his fortune and his life for his
service."</P>
<P>Halifax assured Schutz, that the treasurer endeavours to convince
every one that the Elector approves of all his measures: this prevented
the friends of the succession from opposing him; "and if he speaks
in this strain, to a nobleman of lord Halifax's capacity, with whom
he pretends to converse as a friend, and who is considered to have the
confidence of the Elector, what will he not say to others, who, he knows,
are not so well informed? These assertions of the treasurer's, and the
orders which monsieur de Grote had, as well as myself, to see very few
Whigs, and but rarely and in secret, will render it very difficult to unâˆ£deceive
our friends.</P>
<P>"Lord Halifax believes the Queen, as well as her ministry, is entirely
against our succession, but he is persuaded, that her Majesty, far from
choosing to yield the crown to the Pretender in her lifetime, is no ways
disposed, as yet, to bring him over."</P>
<P>Lord Halifax assured Schutz, that it was owing to him alone, that the
Treaty of Commerce was rejected: he was the first who opposed it in the
house of peers, and he engaged lord Anglesea and others to oppose it in
the house of commons: "And as he gave me clearly to understand,
that to sacrifice all his fortune, and expose himself to the resentment of
France, of the Pretender, and of the Queen's ministry, was playing a
very high game, until one was well assured that such a conduct was apâˆ£proved,
could not a letter to him be obtained from the Elector, thankâˆ£ing
him for his services in the last session, begging the continuance of
chem, and asking his opinion of the state of affairs in this country."</P>

<P>"I Saw lord Sunderland at Kreyenberg's the day before yesterday. He
does not despair of the affairs of this country, as many others do.
He thinks the Treaty of Commerce will be rejected, although a better
one will be presented to this parliament, than that which was rejected by
the last. He assures me the duke of Argyle, who passed some days with
him in the country, may be depended upon. He thinks him incapable
of ever reconciling himself with the minister; as he acknowledges now
that he acted formerly on wrong principles, and is dissatisfied with his
brother for having shuffled, <HI>i. e.</HI> for having paid court to the lord treaâˆ£surer,
in hopes that he would have made him one of the 16 Scotch peers.
The misfortune is, that he has thereby neglected to be chosen in oppoâˆ£sition
to the court, which the duke thinks he could not have missed to
be, if he had spoke out, and employed the interest of his friends in Scotâˆ£land.
They say he is disgusted at having been played the fool with in
this manner, and disappointed in his hopes; and he must have exerted
himself very much and with great success, though chiefly out of spite, in
order to carry the elections of the commons in Scotland against the court,
since it is certain that, of 45 members, there are 34 or 35 Whigs.</P>
<P>Young Mr. Murray, who is known at Hannover, has changed sides,

<P>"THE duke of Argyle, with whom I was this morning, assured me
strongly, that the lord treasurer could not be depended on; that
he knew him better than any one, from his own experience; and that he
was very sure, that he exerted himself with all his might against the sucâˆ£cession,
and for the Pretender. His intimate friends must have said, that
he was too far engaged to withdraw, and that he was forced to most of
the things which he did. The duke of Argyle assured me, that very
odd questions were put to the officers, of whom the treasurer was not
entirely sure; and that he broke them, when their answers did not please
him. He behaves in the same manner to those who have other employâˆ£ments.</P>
<P>The offer which the elder Mr. Murray made me, this morning,

<P>"THE Duke of Argyle coming to see me, the day after I waited
on him, spoke to me with great openness; telling me among
many other particulars, that he constantly spoke to the Queen about
the succession; but, however frequently, could never obtain any anâˆ£swer
from her. As the duke sometimes observed, that he was not well
received by her Majesty, he ascribed the cause of this, to the malicious
reports which had been made to her of his conduct, and he entreated her
to let him know what he was accused of, that he might exculpate himâˆ£self
by informing her of the truth; but having never been able to obâˆ£tain
that favour, he conjured her to compare the freedom and the boldâˆ£ness,
<PB N="512" REF="535"/>
with which he always told her his opinion concerning affairs in
general, and concerning his diffidence of some persons who had the hoâˆ£nour
of approaching her frequently, without enjoining secrecy, with the
manner in which they spoke to her, in order to judge who acted most
honourably to her. But still he had no answer."</P>
<P>"Monsieur de Plessen confirmed the truth of all this to Schutz. The
duke of Argyle thought it was absolutely necessary to gain lord Anglesey
and Sir Thomas Hanmer. The friends of the succession offered to assist
Hanmer in being chosen speaker; and he assured them, that he was

<P>"LORD Halifax is very happy at the steps which the Queen's miâˆ£nisters
were obliged to take, at Utrecht, by the bishop of London.
He hopes it will furnish an opportunity, in the ensuing parliament, of
doing something for the further security of the succession, and for the adâˆ£vantage
of the Electoral family; as he is persuaded, it was unwillingly
the Queen's ministers took such a step. For he believes them disposed,
from inclination and duty, to favour the Pretender. He flatters himself
that our affairs are not so desperate as we imagine, and that our enemies
meet with difficulties which we are ignorant of, and which forced them
to such a measure. In short, he hopes, whether the Pretender stays in
Lorrain or leaves it, that means will be found in the ensuing session of
parliament, to take advantage of this step against them.</P>
<P>It was, on this occasion, the Queen must have written to the Pretender
to inform him, that it was against her will she took that step, assuring him,
that his interests were always dear to her; that she would take all imaâˆ£ginable
care of them; that it was not yet the time to declare herself,
and a great deal more in the same strain, and even treating him as a broâˆ£ther.
But as such a letter must have been written very privately, it is
difficult to conceive how any notice could be got of it, and it is necessary
not to discover any diffidence of the Queen in that respect, as the bad
consequence of that would fall back upon us."</P>

<P>"I Have not troubled you since my coming to this place, because
nothing of the least consequence has offered; but Mr. Cadogan
being now returned from England, with an account of the present seituâˆ£ation
of things and disposion of people's minds there, I thought it neâˆ£cessary
to take notice in general to you of it, and, at the same time, acâˆ£quaint
you, I send him to the Hague, in some few days, to comunicate
all matters to Monsieur Bothmar, in order to his transmitting, in the most
ample maner, to his Electoral Highness, the sentiments and thoughts of our
friends in England, concerning the unhappy condition we are in, which
I am sorry to tell you, grows worse every day, and will very soon be desâˆ£perate,
unless some speedy remedy is applyed. Though the whole conâˆ£duct
of our ministry, both as to affaires at home and abroad, leaves no rome
to doubt of their intentions to bring in the Pretender, yet I cannot forâˆ£bear
mentioning some circumstances relating to it, which have happened
since the last sessions of parliament: I shall begin with our court's enterâˆ£ing
into a stricter and greater union with France than ever, notwithstandâˆ£ing
the collusive maner with which the French King has evaded executing
those articles made with England, which were for our advantage; and
as the highest and most convincing mark of the double dealing and perâˆ£nicious
designs of our ministers; I shall, in the next place, instance their
affectation of writting to such princes, not to receive the Pretender, into
whoes countrys they are sure he will never come, and their making
no step in earned, towardes the removing him out of Lorrain, notwithâˆ£standing
the addresses of both houses, and that his being there or in France
is the same thing, by which means, the article in the treaty of peace, for
the security of the Protestant's Succession is eluded: to this must be
added, the giving all employments, millitary and civil, to notorious Jaâˆ£cobits;
the putting the governments of Scotland and Ireland into the hands
of two persons who are known friends to the Pretender; the choosing
the 16 lords to serve for Scotland, of which two were with the Pretenâˆ£der,
last sumer, and most of the rest declared Jacobits; the ministers receivâˆ£ing
<PB N="516" REF="539"/>
with such distinction, Sir Patrick Lawless, and under the pretence
of his transacting the busines of Spain, their admitting him intoo their
confidence and privacy, though an Irish Papist and an avowed agent of
the Pretender's; the violence and force used in the election of members
for the citty of London; the invading the freedome of elections all over
the kingdome, by corruption, opression, and bribary, in order to get
such persons chose, as are in the interest of the Pretender; the animating
the clergy to preach up hereditary and testamentary right, both which
principles are distructive to the succession; the encoraging the publishâˆ£ing
that pernicious book, lately write to support those doctrins, which,
though high treason by our laws, yet this book which asserts them, was
write, either by direction or conivence of Ld. T. as may be judged by the
following circumstances. First the matterials for it were collect'd either
out of manuscripts in his own library, or out of such publick recordes
as Mr. Lowndes was known to have been employed in the serch of;
Ld. Tâ€”r, library keeper, corrected the manuscript, and the printing
of the book was publish'd in the Gazet, and though the printer was taâˆ£ken
up for form's sake, the sale of the book is openly permitted, and
great numbers of them sent gratis all over the kingdome. Many inâˆ£stances
of the same nature might be joyned to these I have mentioned;
but I think these more then sufficient to demonstrate the views of
the ministry, and the dainger of delaying any longer the entering into efâˆ£fectual
measures for the preventing of them. But as this matter is of the
highest moment, and that the safety of our religon, property and liberty
will depend upon the resolutions to be now taken, our friends in England
submit every thing to his Electoral Highness's great wisdom and
discretion, and will execute with zeal and pleasure, whatever instrucâˆ£tions
or orders he shall please to give them in this most important affaire.
However, they beleive themselves oblidged, at the same time, both in
duty to his Electoral Highness and out of concern for the safety and good
of their country, to represent, in the most humble and submissive maner,
that considering the present state of things in England, nothing can so
effectually assure the succession, as his Electoral Highness going there;
or, if that can not be hoped for, the sending the prince, which would
animate and encorage, to the greatest degree, all those of both partys,
who wish well to the succession, and break the measures of those who
<PB N="517" REF="540"/>
are against it.<MILESTONE N="December." UNIT="month"/> But, though this is the unanimous, sense of our friends in
England, yet they leave and wholly submit it to his Electorale Highness
prudence and judgement, and desire that this their advice may be understood
to proceed from hearts ful of affection and unalterable attachement to his
Electoral Highness person and interests; for the promoting of which
they will be allways ready to venture their lives and fortunes. As I write
you this, in the last confidence, I desire it may be comunicated only
to his Electoral Highness and Monsieur Bernstorf, and for fear of acceâˆ£dents,
you will be pleased afterwards to burn it. I am with truth, yours."</P>

<P>CADOGAN was at the Hague, and gave to Bothmar a memorial conâˆ£cerning
the state of affairs in England, and the means of retrieving
them. It was to be sent to the Elector, and drawn up in such a way, that
it might be communicated to the well affected Tories: but he mentioned
several other particulars to Bothmar, which the latter writes to his correâˆ£spondent
in this letter. The Elector should assure the Tories, that the
Whigs would resign to them offices and employments. If the Electoral
Prince would go to England, there were 50 or 60 great men who would
hazard their fortunes and their lives to serve him. If the Elector himâˆ£self
would go, they would furnish him any sums of money that he should
judge necessary for the execution of his designs. A proof of the possiâˆ£bility
of this was, that eight or ten persons were able to furnish the Emâˆ£peror
<PB N="520" REF="543"/>
with three millions. They would furnish money much more reaâˆ£dily
for the preservation of their own country.</P>
<P>They again entreated his Electoral Highness very earnestly to grant
the pensions they ask for some poor lords, who want necessary subsistence;
and if they cannot engage his Electoral Highness to agree to any thing
they propose, they will endeavour to provide for themselves as well as
they can, and yield to the times. "He told me, that the dutchess of
Marlborough was to return to England in spring, and that perhaps the
duke would do so likewise; for being now 66 years of age, it was proper
for him to think of dying in peace in his native country, if he could. If
we will do nothing ourselves to secure the succession, we cannot expect it
without a miracle. I am afraid we will not get off with the loss of our
hopes of that succession, and that so much trouble will be given to us,
and so many enemies raised against us elsewhere, that we will not be either
in peace or safety in the Electorate, until we shall be so low, that they
may be assured they have nothing further to apprehend from us."</P>
<P>"You recollect, that both the duke of Marlborough and Cadogan
have provisional orders from the Electress to take the command of the
troops and of garrisons in case of the Queen's death. Cadogan told me,
it would be proper to have a particular one for Mr. Armstrong quarter-master
general, who commands at Dunkirk, to seize upon that place,
and execute the orders of Marlborough or Cadogan. That order may
remain in the duke of Marlborough's hands, until it will be time to exâˆ£ecute
it; which Cadogan answers Armstrong will do, although the miâˆ£nistry
confide in him. He is a creature of Cadogan's, who knows, that
according to the laws such orders are not valid; but he says, that officers
and soldiers, so very well affected as they are, will not examine the point
so narrowly, and will be satisfied with seeing the name and the seal of the
Electress; and when once the thing is done, reasons will be easily found
afterwards to justify it."</P>

the expences to be laid out on the poor lords and the common-council,
during the three years that the parliament sits. He wished the sum had
been 24,000 l. which would have made 8,000 l. a year; but he was at
last satisfied with the 20,000. He says it will not be necessary to go far
for this sum. That he himself and the duke of Marlborough will furâˆ£nish
it on the obligation of his Electoral Highness; and, providing the
interest of 5 per cent. be regularly paid, they will not ask when his
Highness would choose to reimburse the capital. I said nothing to him
of what you wrote to me of his Electoral Highness's reimbursing this caâˆ£pital
out of his own revenue, in case other resources fail; but I doubt

present conjuncture, and that he was disposed to give the Chevalier
marks of esteem and regard when the occasions offered. This, in a few
words, is the answer that was made to me. I remarked, however, in conâˆ£tinuing
the conversation with the prince of Trauston, that, far from being
averse from this alliance, they would desire it much; especially if the
Chevalier de St. George was restored to his dominions, as it is not doubted
will happen in a short time.</P>
<P>This minister found, that there was a disproportion of age, between
the Chevalier de St. George and the youngest of the archdutchesses, niece
to the reigning Emperor; and that they would be more inclined to settle
the youngest of the archdutchesses, his sister, the first being only twelve;
and the last two and twenty years old; and it is believed here, that the
Chevalier de St. George is twenty-five. The minister strictly enjoined me
<PB N="524" REF="547"/>
to write to your Royal Highness,<MILESTONE N="March." UNIT="month"/> that you ought to preserve the most
profound secrecy in this affair; that the present conjuncture requires this,
on your own account, and on account of the Emperor and of the Chevaâˆ£lier

should do myself the honour to write all this precisely to your Royal

<P>"I Was not able to answer sooner the letter which you wrote to me,
wherein you informed me of the Emperor's answer to what I had
written to you concerning the designs of the Chevalier de St. George, with
regard to the alliance he would choose to form with the family of Auâˆ£stria.
The reason of my delay has been, that I could not till now find
an opportunity of giving information to the Chevalier de St. George,
who appeared to me to be very sensible of the marks of regard and esteem
which the Emperor has shewn him; and he has given me in charge to
write to you about this, in order that by my orders you might show that
he has a grateful sense of the Emperor's behaviour; that he has a muâˆ£tual
esteem for him, and will seek every opportunity of cultivating that
friendship and regard, which the Emperor has testified for him. He exâˆ£pressed
himself in the most obliging terms. You will, therefore, execute
this commission as soon as you receive my letter. I will even tell you,
as from myself, that I thought I had perceived the Chevalier de St.
George would have wished that he himself could have written to the Emâˆ£peror,
to shew his gratitude; but that he did not believe it became him
to write for the first time as an incognito. I want to know, though for
no other reason but pure curiosity, if the Emperor would receive or anâˆ£swer
a letter from the Chevalier de St. George, and write to him as
King.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, that I had for a long time the curiosity to ask you,
as particular an account as you could give me of the temper, the genius,
and the education of the four archdutchesses, the sisters and the nieces;
<PB N="525" REF="548"/>
and as I have the pictures of all the Emperors, I would choose likewise
to have those of the archduchesses. I command Sauter to write to you
the particulars I would choose to know; and, as you must take time to
get the pictures, I wish that may not hinder you from answering what
I have written above."</P>

<P>In various letters to the earl of Middleton, Sir William Ellis and
others, from their correspondents in England, it appears, that some
friends proposed to the Chevalier de St. George to change his religion,
at least to have protestant servants, and a protestant clergyman with him.
To satisfy them in this last particular, Mr. Lesly, the famous nonjuring
clergyman, so often mentioned in these papers under the feigned name of
Lamb, was sent for to Bar-le-duc, in the room of Mr. West, who was
not so well known. Mr. Lesly wrote a letter on the subject, addressed to
a member of parliament. It was openly handed about by the party;
and at the same time, the Chevalier himself wrote another on the same
subject.</P>

<P>"I Would very much have wished not to have been obliged, at this

two last letters are so pressing and positive, that it would be an unparâˆ£donable
dissimulation in me, should I not answer your letters, with the
same sincerity you write them.</P>
<P>I shall, therefore, begin by putting you in mind of the last conversaâˆ£tion
I had with you upon that subject, to which I have nothing to add,
but that I neither want counsel nor advice to remain unalterable in my
fixt resolution, of never dissembling my religion; but rather to abandon
all than act against my conscience and honour, cost what it will. These
are my sentiments; and, had I others, or should I act contrary to those I
have, where is the man of honour that would trust me? and how could
ever my subjects depend upon me, or be happy under me, if I should
make use of such a notorious hypocrisy to get myself amongst them? I
<PB N="526" REF="549"/>
know their generous character could not but detest both the crime itself
and him that should be guilty of it. And would they but give themâˆ£selves
time seriously to consider, I am persuaded they would not make
my religion the only obstacle to my restoration; it being itself the greatâˆ£est
security for their liberties, properties, and religion, by putting it out
of my power ever to invade them should I intend it; which is so far
from my thoughts, that, on the contrary, I am most willing and ready
to grant all the reasonable security that can be demanded of me, in relaâˆ£tion
to all these points, all my desire being to make them a slourishing
and happy people.</P>
<P>I can have no other interest but theirs; whereas, how many other
rightful heirs are there to the crown after me, who being powerful foâˆ£reigners,
may have inclinations equal to their power, and may very proâˆ£bably
never give rest to England, till they enslave it in good earnest?</P>
<P>Will my subjects be always so blinded, as to make a monster of what
is in effect their greatest security; and not perceive and endeavour to
prevent the real and just causes they have of fear and apprehension?</P>
<P>My present sincerity, at a time it may cost me so dear, ought to be
a sufficient earnest to them of my religious observance of whatever I
promise them: for I can say, with truth, that I heartily abhor all dissiâˆ£mulation
and double dealing, and I love my subjects even now too well
not to wish, as much for their sakes as my own, that they would at least
open their eyes to see their true interest, and timely provide for their fuâˆ£ture
peace and quiet.</P>
<P>I know my grandfather and father too had always a good opinion of
the principles of the church of England, relating to monarchy; and exâˆ£perience
sufficiently sheweth, that the crown was never struck at but she
also felt the blow: and, though some of her chief professors have failed
in their duty, we must not measure the principles of a church by the
actions of some particular persons."</P>

<P>"THIS moment Mr. Strickland is arrived with the letter, which you
did me the honour to write to me. Behold then, at last, the peâˆ£riod
arrived which must decide your fortune! You have taken the only
proper course, by going to Paris; and I hope that you will find at the
court of France the succours which are necessary for securing the success
of your enterprise. The honour which you did me, Sir, during your
stay in my dominions, and the liberty with which you allowed me to tell
you my sentiments, induce me to entreat you now to remember, that by
the death of Queen Anne, France is free of all engagements with Engâˆ£land;
those which had been contracted by the most Christian King havâˆ£ing
been only with the Queen personally, and not with the English
nation. This leaves France without any engagement, and in a situation
to support you without any reproach. But, Sir, this support, when too
public, may not be advantageous to you; and in my opinion, as I have
had the honour of representing to you several times already, the most
essential succours are, not to allow you to want money, to secure your
passage by some ships, and to permit you to take along with you the naâˆ£tional
troops, which would not alarm any one in England; whereas
French troops certainly would.</P>
<P>Some arms and ammunition will be no less necessary; ammunition
may be easily found at Calais, and for fear of losing time, arms may be
taken from the troops which work at the new harbour near Dunkirk; for
they may make some difficulties about the time which will be necessary
for furnishing these things. If the duke of Berwick, as you believed,
was not desirous of attending you, he has succeeded: but, Sir, I entreat
you to remember that a good officer, who is not a stranger, is necessary
for you. I have no doubts but you will land in Scotland; it is upon
that kingdom, it appears to me, you ought principally to depend. You
will probably find there a greater number of friends; and besides, it is a
country in which you can better maintain your ground. The disunion of
<PB N="528" REF="551"/>
that kingdom is the measure, which will attach them most to you. Forâˆ£give
me, Sir, this detail; but amidst the great occupations, in which
you are engaged, you may not perhaps recollect this, of which, howâˆ£ever,
you yourself are convinced. My zeal makes me take too much
liberty, which you will be pleased to excuse; as well as any omission I
may have been guilty of, during your stay in this country. I can do
nothing now, but pray God to bless your undertaking, and to preserve
your health; beseeching you, Sir, to grant me your protection, and to
be persuaded of my zeal, which will not cease but with my life.</P>

<P>He had had with lord Oxford a conference about the King's afâˆ£fairs,

writing; he did so, and gave the paper to the abbÃ©, desiring him to
transcribe it and restore it to him, next day. When the abbÃ©, came home,
though he understood English pretty well, yet it was so bad wrote, that
the abbÃ© could not read it. In this difficulty, knowing none to trust so
nice an affair with but L. L. he came to him, and told him the case, deâˆ£sired
him to transcribe it for him, which he did in so legible a hand, that
the abbÃ© could read it, and transcribed it afterwards himself, time enough
to restore it next morning to lord Oxford; (L. L. thought him always
sincere afterwards).</P>
<P>July 9, 1725,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 92.</NOTE> dining at lady S.'s, lord Mâ€”r said, that the night the
proclamation was ordered to be issued out againstâ€”, he was sumâˆ£moned

in order to such an affair; he meeting lord Oxford, asked him if it was:
lord Oxford said, he knew nothing of it; that he did not meddle in afâˆ£fairs,
<PB N="530" REF="553"/>
and that he would be against it if proposed. Soon after he met lord
B. and asking him about it, and expressing his wonder, that they should
think of such a thing after it had been so carried in the house of lords;
B. denied that he knew any thing of it. Afterwards they were called
into council, where the Queen giving no body time to speak, said she
had resolved on a proclamation, which she caused to be read, and then,
without staying for, or asking any body's advice, went out: so that it was
all her own act. Asking lord Bolingbroke afterwards how it came to
be issued out, in such a manner, he said, lord Trevor (who was then neâˆ£cessary
to him) positively insisted on it that it should be done, and he was
forced to comply.</P>
<P>May 30, 1726, at supper, at L. S.'s, L. L. was giving an account of
the struggle between lord B. and lord Oxford. The latter was absolute
at first, and lady Masham hated L. B. who was only kept in, because the
peace was transacting, and nobody else could speak French. At last,
lord Oxford, disobliging lady Masham, in the affair of Quebec, she joined
L. B. and lord Oxford was turned out a little before the Queen died.
The design of L. B. at the time, was to bring about the Hannover sucâˆ£cession:
and two or three days before her death, L. L. and Sir W.
Windham going in a coach together, the first said, Now they had got
the power entirely into their hands, they might easily bring about a resâˆ£toration;
to which Sir W. said, Put that out of your head; that will
never be:â€”is an impracticable man (<HI>i. e.</HI> he would not change his
religion at that moment) and will never be brought in: and L. L. going
on the Saturday evening (before the Queen died) to Kensington, met
Arthur Moore and John Drummond waiting for L. B. (who dined with
S. W. W. and a great deal of company that day, at Blackheath), who
did not come, though John was appointed to attend there for L. B. to
receive his last instructions, in order to set out the next day for Hannover,
to make up matters with that court. This John Drummond himself
told L. L.; but the Queen's death did not allow them time to execute
their scheme, and they could never make the court believe they had any
such schemes.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The beginâˆ£ning
of their quarrel.â€”Their conduct and views at the Queen's death.â€”The
reasons of the Earl of Oxford's quarrel with the duke of Ormond.â€”The
Duke of Marlborough and Lord Bolingbroke were always friends.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"L. L. on the 28th of June, 1725, told me, that Mr. Harley, at the
time he was bringing about the change in the ministry, in 1710,
was near quarrelling with lord Harcourt and Bolingbroke. He had a
mind to fix them in their old posts of secretary of war and attorney-geneâˆ£ral.
But the one insisted on being lord chancellor, and the other secreâˆ£tary
of state; which he refusing to agree to, they came to L. L. and told
him the case, and that there was no doing any thing with him, and thereâˆ£fore,
they determined to go, the one into Oxfordshire and the other into
Berkshire, next morning; and as he was to stay in town, they begged of
him to shew himself cool and reserved to him. L. L. said, he was sorry
for the occasion of their going; but he would not quarrel with an old
friend without reason. They said, all that they desired of him was, to
shew himself cool to Mr. Harley, which he determined to do. After they
were gone, lord L. wrote a letter to Mr. Harley, acquainting him with
Harcourt and Bolingbroke's being with him and their resolution; and
told him very plainly, that if he went on at this rate, he would lose all his
friends, and nobody would have any thing to do with him; represented
the consequences and desired him to consider them. He left a copy of
this letter in England. Harley and Bolingbroke, after parting with L. L.
had gone to Mr. Harley's, and this letter was delivered to Mr. Harley,
whilst they were with him, and they saw the superscription to be
lord L's hand. Bolingbroke asked L. L. afterwards, what was in the
letter; for, he said, he never saw a man so struck, in his life time, as
Harley was after reading it. The issue was, Harcourt and Bolingbroke
were satisfied, and staid in town.</P>
<P>Harley used often to complain to lord L. of the Tories having been
cut out of business for above twenty years, and of their unfitness for it;
and had, therefore, a mind to bring over a capable Whig or two. But
the least motion of it put the Tories in a slame, and he could not do it.</P>
<P>Harcourt had complained often, in very feeling terms, to lord L. that
he knew no more of the measures of the court, though he was L. C. than
<PB N="532" REF="555"/>
his footman. That lord Bolingbroke had not made him a visit of a
year, and lord Oxford did not so much as know him. But just before
the Queen died, Bolingbroke brought him into his measures, and they
were entire confidents.</P>
<P>Oxford and Bolingbroke had always been pushing one another, from
the very time of their power, and labouring to supplant each other.
Lord Oxford told L. L. upon asking when he had seen Harry St. John,
and L. L. answering, that Harry was a man of business, and he had not
seen him of a long while, that Bolingbroke was betraying all their counâˆ£sels
to lord Marlborough; and that he owed the finding out of the secret
to little Dartmouth, and Erasmus Lewis had made the discovery.</P>
<P>It is certain, lord Marlborough was very fond always of Harry St.
John; and, on the loss of his son, the lord Blandford, said he had no
comfort lest, but in Harry St. John, whom he loved and considered as
his son: and, notwithstanding the difference, on account of Party,
the duke always had a regard for him.</P>
<P>Bolingbroke, in the midst of his struggle with lord Oxford, was hated
mortally by lady Masham and abominated by the Queen, for his loose
life, and Oxford was in the height of his credit; so that he must have
fallen, if he had not been necessary for the scheme of the peace, he
being the only man about court that could speak French, or transact any
thing with Mesnager or the other persons sent over by the court of
France, or to be sent into France.</P>
<P>About the same time, or a little after the first overtures of peace, the
Quebec expedition was set on foot, in which lord Oxford refused to graâˆ£tify
Mrs. Masham, in an affair relating to it, by which she would have
got a good sum of money. She, though his relation, resented this highâˆ£ly.
Bolingbroke improved the moment, struck in with her and told her,
he would get it done, in spite of lord Oxford. He did so; and she stood
by him afterwards.</P>
<P>Lord Oxford, who was for serving the King<NOTE N="â€–" PLACE="foot">This seems to be a mistake.</NOTE>, fancied Bolingbroke was
engaged in that scheme; and therefore, thought to strike in with the H.
of H. This completed his ruin; and he was mistaken in his point: for
Bolingbroke's view was the H. of H. and the night after lord Oxford
was out, L. L. came to Kensington, to get the Queen to sign some papers,
<PB N="533" REF="556"/>
which he deferred upon the dutchess of Ormond, (who was then in waiting)
her telling, that the Queen was something indisposed; but she would
acquaint her, if his lordship pleased. But, he said, it was no matter of
consequence, and he would not disturb her. He saw there waiting for
lord Bolingbroke, who failed them, Charles Caesar, John Drummond,
&amp;c. John was to part in a day's time, for Holland, to engage lord Albeâˆ£marle
to negociate for them, with the court of Hannover; and these and
others then in waiting, as John Drummond himself told L. L. were
all in that scheme. The earl's death blew up this affair; that ministry
lasting only three days, and the house of Hannover not sensible of their
obligation to them.</P>
<P>Lord Marlborough landing, as it were, the moment of the Queen's
death, I was apt to fancy, he might be in that scheme; but L. L. said,
he did not believe it; and he heard lord Bolingbroke, in company with
himself, lord Bath, and others, on the day of the duke's entry into Lonâˆ£don,
speak with a violent resentment upon it, and say, He ought to be
sent to the Tower for it.</P>
<P>December the 13th, Mrs. A. O. told me, that lord Oxford opposed
the duke of Ormond's list of new officers for the army, because it was comâˆ£posed
of Bagnals, Mathews, and other Irish, and because the duke of
Ormond insisted, that the officers turned out should be paid for their reâˆ£giments
and posts which they had purchased with their blood, which the
new officers proposed were not able to do; nor could the Exchequer
then supply 50,000 <HI>l.</HI> which was the least it amounted to. That,
upon lady Masham's quarrel with lord Oxford, about her share in the
10 per cent. reserved out of the Assiento contract, which was intended to
be shared between her, &amp;c. She sent for A O. to apply to the duke of
Ormond; who said, she could not pretend to have so much credit with
the duke, though perhaps her mother might. That her mother was sent
for, and she (A. O.) went to Sir John Stapleton's, where the duke was to
sup, fetched him away to Kensington, where lady Masham told him how
ill the Queen was, and how uneasy at nothing being done for her brother;
and that, if he would but secure her 30,000 <HI>l.</HI> of the ten per cent, which
amounted to 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> she would join with him, and he should have the
modelling of the army, &amp;c. as he pleased. He was afterwards introduced
to the Queen, who was ill, (this was the year before her death) in order
<PB N="534" REF="557"/>
to offer his service to serve her brother, and have the modelling of the
army, &amp;c. granted him: but instead of giving any assurances or making
any proposals to the Queen, who was prepared to grant him every thing;
he only asked her, if she had any commands for him, and went away withâˆ£out
saying more.</P>
<P>The duke of Ormond took it ill of lord Oxford, that when he desired
1200 <HI>l.</HI> a year pension might be settled on lady Hales, lord Oxford proâˆ£posed
to make the duke's own pension 6000 <HI>l.</HI> instead of 5000 a year, and
offered to get it done, and then the duke might give her as much on his
own estate: but lady Hales piqued herself on having a pension from the
Queen; and made the duke refuse the offer and quarrel with lord Oxâˆ£ford,
who would not grant the 1200 <HI>l.</HI> a year pension.</P>
<P>When lord Oxford was turned out, Bolingbroke's scheme and Harâˆ£court's
was for the house of Hannover, to make the duke of Marlborough
general, and if the duke of Ormond submitted to it, to allow him the post
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland; if not, to turn him out of all, and slight him."</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1714" UNIT="year"/> THOUGH the Tories were generally deemed Jacobites, by the
house of Hannover, there is no reason to believe, that the whole
of that party were friends to the Pretender. The bigotry of that prince,
in adhering, with such obstinacy, to the Romish faith, cooled the zeal of
those who were most attached to the line of hereditary succession. Beâˆ£sides,
many Tory leaders, disappointed in their own views upon office, and
offended, upon that account, with the lord treasurer, began to cabal with
the Whigs. Among these was the earl of Anglesea, a man of quick
parts, but revengeful in his disposition. This earl, together with Sir Wilâˆ£liam
Dawes, the successor of arch-bishop Sharpe, in the see of York, posâˆ£sessed
great influence with the Tories. On the 5th of April, in the preâˆ£sent
year, they joined themselves to the Whigs; when, upon a division
in the house of lords, the protestant succession was, by a small majority,
voted out of danger. They were followed by the whole bench of biâˆ£shops,
by the earls of Abingdon and Jersey, the lords Ashburnham and
Carteret, and some other temporal peers of the High Church party.
Their principles, however, were not the sole motives of this desertion.
The means by which Anglesea, the arch-bishop, and their friend Sir Thoâˆ£mas
Hanmer, were gained to the house of Hannover, are explained, upon
more solid grounds, in the following papers.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the votes in parliament, the security of laws which
had never been infringed, and the manifest attachment of a great majority
of the nation, the family of Hannover, misled by the ignorance of their
agents and the violence of the Whigs, continued to think, that their sucâˆ£cession
to the throne was in the utmost danger. The Elector himself,
harassed and fatigued, by the eagerness of his agents, and the vehement
<PB N="536" REF="559"/>
remonstrances of those who called themselves his friends, had become exâˆ£tremely
indifferent, about a throne so difficult to mount. He had, duâˆ£ring
the whole course of the preceding year, declined to gratify the
Whigs, in sending over the Electoral Prince. He refused to satisfy
either their avarice or their wants with pensions. He would not give them
money to influence the general elections in their favour. He rejected
their violent proposal of invading the kingdom with an army. Having
failed to awaken the ambition of his Highness, they applied themselves
to his humanity and his fears. They represented, that their liberties,
their fortunes, and, perhaps, their lives were in the utmost danger, should
the Pretender succeed to the throne. They insinuated, that neither the
Elector himself nor his family could be safe, upon that event, in the
heart of Germany: that a prince, who considered them as rivals in the
succession, would never sit down contented, till he had reduced them so
low, as to cease to be an object of terror. This last consideration had,
at length, such an effect upon his Highness, that he permitted his envoy
in London to demand a writ of summons to the Electoral Prince, as duke
of Cambridge; a transaction that made a great noise at the time, and is
fully explained in the following papers.</P>
<P>The attention of the people having been gradually raised by this and
similar circumstances, the Queen and her servants found it absolutely neâˆ£cessary
to concur, at last, in appearance, with the sentiments of the naâˆ£tion.
They had hitherto succeeded, notwithstanding the arts of the
Whigs, in establishing a general opinion, that a perfect harmony subâˆ£sisted
between the courts of Great Britain and Hannover. Whatever afâˆ£fection
the Queen might have had for her brother, a great part of it was
obliterated, by his bigotted attachment to a system of religion which she
abhorred. She, however, secretly wished that he might succeed her in
the throne. But her servants would be extremely willing to retain their
power, by gaining the good graces of the house of Hannover<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"A foolish circumstance which rendered ineffectual all endeavours of the late ministry to establish themselves in the good graces of the court of Hannover, as I shall parâˆ£ticularly relate in another work.

<PB N="537" REF="560"/>
sent Mr. Harley, this year, to Hannover, to inquire what further
securities the Elector thought necessary for the succession of his family to
the throne. She offered to concur in whatever he should demand, exâˆ£cepting
the sending over a prince of his family to reside in the kingdom.
This, she thought, was the same thing as to descend from the throne. She
and her ministers were much blamed by the Whigs, for refusing to invite
the Electoral prince. That party had forgot that they themselves had
been equally averse from such an invitation, when they were in power<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot"><Q>"For my own part, I freely told my opinion to the ministers, and did, afterâˆ£wards, offer many reasons for it, in a discourse intended for the public (but stopped by the Queen's death.) That the young grandson, whose name I cannot remember, should be invited over to be educated in England; by which, I conceived the Queen might be secure from the influence of cabals and factions. The zealots, who affected to believe the succession in danger, could have no pretences to complain; and the nation might one day hope to be governed by a prince of English manners and language."</Q> <BIBL>Swift's Enquiry.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>The lord treasurer, while a commoner, and speaker of the house, voted
for all the acts that were passed in different sessions of parliament, for setâˆ£tling
and securing the succession in the protestant line. Notwithstanding
what has been supposed by the court of Hannover, and asserted, with
uniform vehemence, by the Whigs, no decisive proofs can be advanced,
that he ever favoured the Pretender, during the four years of his adminiâˆ£stration.
In the two last years, when he found himself declining in the
Queen's favour, and felt a consequent diminution of his influence in the
cabinet, he made all advances to the court of Hannover, consistent with
the aukwardness of his manner, the reserve of his temper, and that afâˆ£fectation
of secrecy and design, which he thought absolutely necessary for
a minister, and which he probably used to conceal his own want of extenâˆ£sive
talents. A discerning reader will perceive, even through the comâˆ£plaints
and prejudices of the Hannoverian agents, that this unfortunate
man wished sincerely to secure a retreat for himself, behind the succession
in the protestant line. He paid no court to the Jacobites and high Tories,
<PB N="538" REF="561"/>
that was not absolutely necessary for continuing himself in office. Bolingâˆ£broke
was the principal adviser of all the violent measures which contriâˆ£buted
to increase the terrors of the Whigs, and to continue the suspicions
of the house of Hannover.</P>
<P>The apprehensions of those who were, or pretended to be, well-affected
to the succession in the house of Hannover, were not entirely groundless.
The jealousy of the Electoral family could not altogether have proceeded
from the inventions of faction, the misrepresentations of party, or the igâˆ£norance
or blind zeal of their agents in London. Though Queen Anne
was, perhaps, conveniently free from strong attachments of any kind,
though she was actually too dilatory and unenterprising in her nature, and
timid in her disposition, to engage in any dangerous undertaking; though
she was probably as averse from bringing over the Pretender, during her
life, as she was from seeing a prince of the Electoral family residing in
the kingdom; yet it can be now no question, but towards the end of her
reign, she was favourably disposed towards her brother, and would have
been well pleased, without any trouble or danger to herself, to have seâˆ£cured
for him the eventual succession of the throne. He himself was no
stranger to this circumstance, and he formed his expectations accordingly.
In a declaration, published immediately upon her demise, he says, <Q REND="inline">"Of
her good intentions towards us, we could not, for some time past, well
doubt; and this was the reason we then sat still, expecting the good efâˆ£fects
thereof, which were unfortunately prevented by her deplorable
death."</Q></P>
<P>The court of Hannover, though the suspicions of their agents were
greater than the truth, could not possibly be strangers to the Queen's intenâˆ£tions.
Notwithstanding all the kind assurances and protestations of friendâˆ£ship
received from Anne, it was natural for them to suspect her sincerity,
when they saw that all the avowed friends of the Pretender supported all
her measures. The character and manner of her minister were calculated
to increase the suspicions of the Electoral family. With some abilities,
he possessed all the weaknesses, and even stooped to the meannesses in
which the whole art of every shallow politician consists. Regardless of
sincerity, in his political conduct, he often promised more than he had
either power or inclination to perform. Flying perpetually from the
<PB N="539" REF="562"/>
point, in his conversation upon business, he disgusted mankind in general,
in proportion to the eagerness which men entertain concerning their own
affairs. It was only when he meant not to adhere to his word, he gave
any answer at all; and that was even then contrived in a way that renâˆ£dered
it ambiguous. There was an air of secrecy in all his manner,
and visible in every feature of his countenance, and an affectation of mysâˆ£tery
and deep design, even in trifles. This defect in his character was so
little calculated to gain the confidence of others, that it actually exposed
himself to suspicions, when in reality he might have no bad designs.</P>
<P>The repeated charges brought against the earl of Oxford, in the Hanâˆ£nover
papers, may be justified by the defects of his own manner and mind.
But his colleagues in office, especially the viscount Bolingbroke, were
more sanguine in their temper and determined in their measures, An
inveteracy, arising from mutual injuries, had subsisted between them and
the Whigs for several years. It was foreseen, that an universal change of
men and measures would take place, upon the demise of the Queen: that
the Electoral family would employ the Whigs in the administration of
their affairs, whenever they mould succeed to the crown: that the Tories
would be humbled, and those at present in office be in danger of their
lives and fortunes. It was, therefore, natural to suppose, that men in
such circumstances had entered into secret measures to form a shelter for
themselves, against the storm which was gathering over their heads. Their
common prudence, if not their principles, might be supposed to direct
their views to the Pretender. But, notwithstanding all these appearances,
there is reason to believe that, had the Queen lived for some time longer,
even Bolingbroke would have found means to reconcile himself to the
house of Hannover; having held an uninterrupted communication with
the duke of Maryborough, who was much more attached to the reâˆ£covery
of his own power, than to either of the rivals for the British
throne.</P>

his opinion, he should take in the present conjuncture. I entreated him
then, after having thanked him for his good intentions to my master, to

<P>Schutz not knowing, probably, that Oxford had quarrelled, at this

but the treasurer staid in London, which made Kreyenberg believe that
there was nothing very extraordinary, if other circumstances did not
prove the contrary. Dr. Sloane, who was never called for, by a certain
great personage, but when in great danger, set out about the same time
for Windsor. Masham sent to the clerk of the signet-office, before he
was out of bed, begging of him to make out his patent of remembrancer
of the Exchequer, (though in the Christmas holydays), which made Kreyâˆ£enberg

By the accounts he brings, as well as by what has been write from thence,
it is evident the principal regents of the Republic begin to be now conâˆ£vinced

and since the destruction of their state must inevitably follow, they have
warmly taken the alarm, and seem disposed to enter into any measures
towards preventing itt, which the form of their government will alow

at present very desirous to reconcile themselves to his Imperial Majesty;
but the managements they are outwarly forced to keep with France and

matters so fast in favour of the Pretender, every body must agree,
if something further be not done in the next sessions of parliament toâˆ£wardes
securing the succession, it is to be fear'd it may be irretrievably
lost. Mr. Cadogan returns in about fourteen days to the Hague, in

necessary. But, in either case, he thinks that we can draw great advanâˆ£tage
from it; and even though lord Oxford should be as great a fool,
and as great a rogue, on this occasion, as he has always been, such a
measure as sending, in this present conjuncture, his cousin, who is his
great favourite, may set him forever at variance with such of the Tories
as are for the Pretender; by which he will lose a great part of his credit.</P>
<P>Lord Halifax told me, that the petition of the principal merchants of
London, and likewise that of 3 or 4000 of the richest inhabitants of that
city, was resolved upon, Friday and Sunday last, at his house; and that
they were to be delivered to-day. He promises himself great effect from
them; and the more so, that there is no example of London's having
ever given one."</P>

hands, would put our succession out of danger; that he would thereby
do a signal service to the nation, which he would render happy, and gain
to himself the gratitude and favour of all the family that should succeed

he (Halifax) and all those who were of his opinion, should exert all their

<P>"AS to Ferguson, who calls himself Ker of Kersland, the character I
have given of him may be depended on. I am of your Excelâˆ£lency's
opinion, that the letter you was pleased to send a translation of,
is of his own framing, and it confirms me that he is sent as a spy by my
lord treasurer; for the plan is, according to the directions which his lordâˆ£ship
gave to one of his spies, to fish out matter for a plot to be charged
on the Whigs, for bringing in the house of Hannover by force, during
her Majesty's life, which the spy himself discovered to one of my
friends."</P>

written of the Cameronians and of the Presbyterians in general, and of
the influence and conduct of his predecessors, as well as his own. <Q REND="inline">"It's
true he had interest enough among the Cameronians, on his wife's acâˆ£count,
at the time of the Union, to keep them from breaking up the
parliament; but he was well paid for it, by the lord Godolphin and the
D. of Queensberry, and by that money bribed others to concur with him;
but that being now known, the Cameronians hate him and call him a
traitor."</Q></P>
<P>Ferguson, it seems, had married the eldest daughter of Ker of Kersâˆ£land,
and the male heirs being extinct, assumed tile name of the family.
<Q REND="inline">"He did get money from lord Godolphin, on pretence of his interest
with the Cameronians, and that he was courted by France; but upon
the change, he played the knave, and endeavoured to blacken the late
ministry, as not having listened to his information of a Jacobite plot, and
that he could procure an address from 15,000 Cameronians for settling
<PB N="554" REF="577"/>
the Hannover succession, and by this means got money from the present
lord treasurer, and I believe he has been his tool ever since."</Q></P>

<P>"HAving spoke, a few days ago, to lord Townshend and lord Cowper,
on their return from the country, before they had seen any of
our friends, they said the very same things to me, which I wrote to you
already. I hope, therefore, you will maturely weigh an affair of so great
importance, on which depends your succession, and the fortune and lives
of those who have your interests at heart in this country, and who are
devoted to your service.</P>
<P>Consider further, that if ever the Pretender mounts the throne, (which
he will undoubtedly do, if he comes with a French army, <HI>i. e.</HI> 10 or
12,000 men, before any of the family is here) in what manner England
and France in conjunction will concur in your ruin, and in the destrucâˆ£tion
of a family, which they will know they disobliged so much, by robâˆ£bing
it of a crown which was destined for it, and of which they will not
believe themselves to be in peaceable possession, while that family reâˆ£mains
on a good footing. I leave it to you to consider, what efforts they
will make to ruin it, in one way or other.</P>
<P>You must be sufficiently convinced, ever since the same thing has been
so often repeated to you, that the ministry of this country make great
<PB N="556" REF="579"/>
efforts to weaken our party among the people, by making them believe,
that the oaths which they take, as well as the act of succession, regard the
Electoral family merely because they were the nearest protestant successors,
at the time when these acts were past; and that, as they were past merely
to prevent the danger of seeing the crown of these kingdoms fall into the
hands of a Roman Catholic, the principal design was to have a protestant
successor. That, therefore, it was sufficient to answer that design; and
that, to find a protestant successor, who was nearer of kin than the
Electoral family, would be a thing which was just, and to which every
true Englishman ought to be naturally inclined.</P>
<P>These reasonings have their weak side, of which I wish the nation was
as thoroughly persuaded as I am. But the real state of this kingdom at
present is, that all honest men, without distinction of party, acknowledge,
that although of every ten men in the nation nine should be for us, it is
certain, that of fifteen Tories there are fourteen who would not oppose
the Pretender, in case he came with a French army; but, instead of
making any resistance to him, would be the first to receive and acknowâˆ£ledge
him.</P>
<P>It is likewise very certain, that if some prince of the Electoral family
came now to this country, all those who are at this time in office would
hasten to make their court to him, and things would be made quite safe
and solidly settled in our favour.</P>
<P>What answer shall I make to these facts, which I know to be certain!
How can I encourage men, whom you do not choose to acknowledge or
support, either by money or by sending over some one of the family? Or,
in short, what other measures can I take, which will give them courage,
at a time when they know for certain, that the next session of parliament
will not end without enfringing the acts of succession? And what remedy
do you imagine you can then apply, which may prevent or disconcert
their design? Is it Mr. Harley's embassy, and the manner in which the
lord treasurer and he explain themselves to me? Is it the proofs, which
they give you of their attachment at Utrecht? In short, what is it?"</P>
<P>For my share, Sir, I entreat you to employ all these reasons to conâˆ£vince
our master, without being restrained by any apprehensions of hurtâˆ£ing
my fortune thereby. I had rather lose it, by saving men of honour,
who are in the interests of his Electoral Highness, and by showing him the
<PB N="557" REF="580"/>
true state in which his affairs are in this country, than fail to inform
him of his danger of losing both his succession and perhaps something
else.</P>
<P>These things must undoubtedly appear disagreeable to you. Judge
then, how I must consider them, and with what satisfaction I can hear
them repeated to me so often, by all those who are generally acknowâˆ£ledged
to possess abilities and zeal, and who have had the constancy, till
now, of remaining attached to our interests; although, without a miraâˆ£culous
interposition in their favour, as well as in ours, they must believe
themselves to be absolutely lost, seeing themselves entirely abandoned by
those in whose cause they run every kind of risk."</P>

Jacobites, who have been over looked, while others were under discouâˆ£ragements,
and who had provided themselves in arms, seemed ready to
make a push for their favourite Pretender; and many of the Popish and
Jacobite nobility and gentry came to town, as is suspected with that view.
Whereupon, friends, I can't give their names here, met and considered
what might be proper upon this emergency. The safety of this place
soon appeared to be of the last consequence to the cause in general in this
country, both for its being the fate of the government here, and so a
right place, more observable and important, for the life and spirit it must
give to meaner and remote places, and because of the public money's
being for the most part lodged here: a good morsel for their stomachs!</P>
<P>To secure this place, therefore, the magistrates, who are generally well
affected, and who have the executive part of the law in their hands, were
spoke to, and desired earnestly to augment their guard, and take care it
<PB N="559" REF="582"/>
be in right hands; to arm the honest people of the town, and to have a
watchful eye upon all strangers and suspected persons, to prevent a surâˆ£prise,
and so pary the first shock, which probably may be the worst: all
which they radyly enugh agreed to, and I hope will observe. Care is
taken to encourage them, by assurances of support and advice, which you
know people of their reach and resolution require not a little; at the same
time, what arms can be got are providing for those places of the country
may be trusted, and accounts are given of circumstances to friends
elsewhere, that things may goe uniformly.</P>
<P>I must own we have more Jacobites here than in other places of Briâˆ£tain,
and that they are but two well provided; but still I am persuaded,
the honest people, with a very small assistance, will be able to hold head
against, if they have non els to deal with; however, care would be taken
that the small number of troops here be ordered and disposed of to the
best advantage.</P>
<P>These are the measures were thought at present adviseable, which I
could not advertise you of sooner, I hope they will pleas; and as need
may require, and ther is access, you will send advice of what is thought
proper.</P>
<P>I send you now the rest of what I promised, and what I formerly writ
of; which is no easie matter, and which I cannot desire you to rely upon,
so unsixt are the generallity of mankind. However, that I may not fail
in any thing that may possiblely be of use to you, I have sent it accordâˆ£ing
to the present situation. You'll understand what I now write by
comparing it with what I wrot before. And as to 5, 7, 12, and 14, of
the 1st, they have been thought friends of the present establishment and
succession; but their behaviour of late has rendered them suspect. The
rest have left no ground to doubt them, as you already know.</P>
<P>The 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28,
30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, of the second, have always been
reckoned friends to that establishment and succession, upon good grounds:
as the 1, 5, 7, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 29, 31, 35, 37, and 40,
have been suspected of being friends to the Pretender.</P>
<P>I cannot give you particulars here, but what's write will give you a
view of what you desired of me. I have sent also a cypher inclosed, by
which I may have occasion to write. You'll pleas to let me know if it
<PB N="560" REF="583"/>
comes safe to hand: ther was a mistake in my former. Lieut. Col.
George Douglas is a member to the commons in place of Captain Moody,
which you'll pleas to help. I could have sent you some papers are handed
about here, the Highland address, and the Pretender's declaration; but
I know you have them another way, and I would not give you duble
truble. Adieu.</P>

maintained that there was no armament going forward in France, nor
any troops moving down to the coast. He acquaints him with the death
of archbishop Sharp, and gives his character. "He (the archbishop)
really believed four years ago, with others, whose eyes are now opened,
that the church of England was in danger, and concurred in the meaâˆ£sures
of those who endeavoured to put it in security; but having found
out his mistake, and being convinced that they had no other design
than to satisfy their avarice, their ambition, and their private resentments,
he left them about a year and a half ago, and even hindered her Majesty

<Q><P>"Lord Nottingham came to me to desire me to offer his respects to

<P>"As he lays it down for a foundation, that the Queen's ministers are

themselves, it would be too late, after the Queen's death, to attempt to
set the Pretender on the throne, they will exert themselves to secure it to
him during her Majesty's life."</P></Q>
<P>Nottingham thought they would do this by the assistance of France,

would, at last, agree to the only remedy, which all his friends judged
would be effectual; viz. to send over the Electoral Prince. <Q REND="inline">"Your
friends will not fall, without employing all their efforts to preserve you
the crown: and as they see that all their representations to you have been,

that it is their own interest which influences them to speak in this manâˆ£ner,
they will demand of the lord chancellor a writ for the Electora

happen to them, only because you neglect your interests, by refusing to

<OPENER><DATELINE>London <DATE>16/27 February, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"UPON the 'late change of the ministry, there was a general rumour
that the Queen was to send the earl of Rivers to Hannover, to deâˆ£sire
the Elector to send a prince of his family to reside in England, which
at that time the treasurer gave out as a thing determined upon, and even
told the lords Somers and Halifax, as in great confidence, that the Queen
intended to offer the Elector the command of the army in Flanders, and
this was told in such a manner that these lords believed it. But it was
soon found that this story was only to amuse the nation, and to re estaâˆ£blish
credit in some degree; and that the treasurer might know the disâˆ£position
of the house, as in the infancy of his ministry he could not know
how every individual would allow himself to be managed."</P>
<P>"The same rumour was spread two years ago, at the meeting of the
parliament; upon which, however, I will not insist, as it appears to
have been rather a direct mockery, than that the situation of affairs then
required it. But now things are come to a crisis; a new parliament is
chosen, and the first session, which is always a delicate matter, has not the
desired effect; trade is interrupted; France is victorious over the emâˆ£pire,
and behaves with haughtiness to her friends as well as enemies. The
lord treasurer, by his haughtiness and breaches of promise, is personally
<PB N="565" REF="588"/>
hated by many people. A considerable party begin to make an outcry
about the succession and other things. The bank, and consequently the pubâˆ£lic
credit, is in a very bad situation; the stocks fall; the people are disconâˆ£tented;
and lastly, the Queen is in so bad a state of health, that nobody
believes she can live long.</P>
<P>In such circumstances, it is not to be wondered that the treasurer falls
to his old shifts, and finding that the report of the duke of Kent's going
to Hannover has little effect (as every body is persuaded that were the
court in earnest, one would be sent of some interest in either party) he
now gives out, that the Queen has given occasion to an invitation, and
that secretary Bromley was not only to propose it to the lower house,
but was in person to go to Hannover, to deliver the Queen's message.</P>
<P>What I have said above of the lord treasurer's conduct, particularly
with regard to lord Rivers's embassy, must necessarily raise doubts, as to his
sincerity in this,â€”and not to speak of the Queen's personal inclinations,
when one considers the lord treasurer's behaviour, at the very time he
makes such great promises, I do not see the least regard can be had to
them; I must own that one here, on the spot, can judge of this better,
than can be shown by a letter. I shall, however, add one or two remarks.</P>
<P>First, then, I must observe in general, that to make so great and sudâˆ£den
a change of measures, is very difficult, and requires near connexions
with another set of people, which hitherto has not happened; neither is
the first minister in such a situation, that he can act so cavalierly with
France and the Jacobites here, who are not so contemptible a party as is
generally believed, without having made up with the other party, as hath
been said.</P>
<P>2dly, The Jacobites are more and more encouraged, and are daily
placed in all the small posts, of which no lists are kept; and, as to the
great employments, it is certain, that lord Stairs and the duke of Argyle
have lost theirs.</P>
<P>3dly, The court is busy, at this moment, to get out, by petitions or
otherwise, from the house of commons, all those who have distinguished
themselves for the succession, and particularly an inquiry is made, in a
most scandalous and inquisition-like manner, against Mr. Walpole, who
has made himself formidable, and it is resolved to have him <HI>per fas et
nefas</HI> voted out of the house.</P>
<P><PB N="566" REF="589"/>
4thly, There is good reason to believe, that the report of confirming
the act of regency, which has been spoken of, is not without grounds,
nay, that it appears to be really resolved upon; and the success of
this matter is the less doubted of at court, that it appears very
plausible to the Tories. To whom they set forth, that in the sealed act,
as it now stands, most of the lords of the regency are Whigs, and so they
must fall into the hands of their enemies, whereas, if the next successor is
fixed by a new instrument, to be registered in Chancery, decency will
require that, at least, a certain number of Tories should be named with
them. Others say, that the nomination will be lest to the Queen and
parliament. Be that as it will, it is certain, that if the act of regency unâˆ£dergo
this change, it is in fact annulled, and so the strongest wall in faâˆ£vour
of the succession, thrown down. How all these things agree with the
present offers is easy to judge.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to flatter myself into a belief, that the lord treaâˆ£surer
acts in this matter uprightly; but can find no reasons to encourage
me to such a belief. When one considers that man's humour and way
of acting, they may think, that perhaps the Jacobite party grows too
strong for him, and that, supposing the Queen's health re-established, to
keep that party in awe, and perhaps to get something from France, he
will show them he is not in so bad a situation, but that he can do without
them, and for some time continue his game without being obliged to deâˆ£clare
for the one or the other party. All this might be supposed of this
minister, if one did not reflect, that the present step is of too much imporâˆ£tance,
and that he had not reason to be afraid of the proposals being
really brought to a bearing. Those that think he has been obliged to
this step against his will, have a better opinion of the lower house than I
have, unless the state of the Queen's health is so bad, that there is no apâˆ£pearance
of her being able to come to London; allow me to add, that the adâˆ£vantages
that the lord treasurer will draw, or seeks to draw, from the preâˆ£sent
proposals, are these.</P>
<P>1st, In general to amuse the people, and to prevent the fall of credit.</P>
<P>2dly, To prevent some Tories coming into measures with the Whigs,
and so hinder these last from making some disagreeable overtures in the
beginning of the session; and</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="590"/>
3dly, To afford to these that pretend to be friends to the succession,
yet for private interest will not break with the treasurer, an excuse for
not meddling, in any thing, in favour of the succession; so that the treaâˆ£surer
will by this means, gain some weeks, during which time he will be
able to bring his forces into order, and may then laugh at every one for
the rest of the session, and undertake, with safety, to change the act of
regency.</P>
<P>Lord Cowper having understood that there was a writ made out, at
the chancellor's office, for the hereditary prince, as duke of Cambridge,
to appear in parliament, employed the clerk who gives out the writs to
the peers, to enquire at the lord chancellor, whether he should bring
the Electoral Prince's writ to the envoy of the Elector's court. The chanâˆ£cellor
received him in a very angry manner, enquired who had employed
him in that message, reprimanded him severely, and ordered that the
writ should not be delivered out of the office, even though enquired for.
The officers sent by Mr. Stanhope to the Boulonnoise and Flanders are
returned, and report that they found no troops in motion there, only that
nine Irish battalions and a regiment of dragoons were advanced from
Lorrain, and in quarters at Douay, Valenciennes, and Hesdin, and that
the officers said openly, that they had orders to be ready to march upon
a minute's warning.</P>
<P>After I had ended this letter, I have learned from good authority, that
Mr. Harley's instructions bear, to let his Electoral Highness know, that a
faction of ill disposed people disturbed her Majesty's government, by
raising jealousies and alarms, particularly with regard to the succession,
notwithstanding the act settling the succession was in full force; that her
Majesty would however, do all she could, with honour, to make his
Highness easy as to that matter; but that, if to chagrin her, an invitation
should be proposed to parliament, she would look upon it as a personal
affront. I cannot be sure of the truth of this information, but as I had
it from good hands, I thought it my duty to communicate it."</P>

<P>"BEING returned to my post again, on this side the water, give me
leave to remind your Royal Highness of your most devoted humâˆ£ble
<PB N="568" REF="591"/>
servant, and to beg the continuation of the honour of your good
graces, and those of your commands, if you have any in this country. I
thought Mr. Harley would have been over, by this time, and then Monâˆ£sieur
Lahonton would have seen the effects your Royal Highness has over
me, since nothing is harder at our court to obtain, than money; though
I must own, in this case, naming your name, my lord treasurer was as
ready as I was to obey any command of your Royal Highness's. I could
not have imagined, till I was in England, the heats and animosities there
is amongst people even of the same principles; and, believe me, Madam,
all the noise made about the Pretender is groundless; and the Tories are
full as much in your interest, or rather more, than the Whigs, though
the latter have of late got up a way of threatening the Tories with the
protestant succession, as if your Royal Highness, or those of your illusâˆ£trious
house, who should succeed the Queen, were not to reign over the
Tories, as well as the Whigs. I am satisfied that your Royal Highness
knows Great Britain too well, not to know who are honest men, and who
otherwise, without the distinguishing names of Whig and Tory: for I am
sure you know, what is called Tory, are those which are for the church of
England, which is all or almost all the clergy of England; a great maâˆ£jority
in the parliament and nation, and almost all the landed men in the
kingdom; who should be more desirous than they to secure their religion
and liberty to their posterity; and you may depend upon it, Madam,
they are all heartily in your interest? I need no better proofs, than that
famous book of Steel's, called, The Crisis, which the Whigs cry up so
much, and which I think is demonstration to your Royal Highness, that
you have nothing to fear from the Tories. Are they not all sworn to
your succession? Have they not all abjured the Pretender? And is there
one man either in parliament, ministry, or any place of trust, that is not
sworn to support your succession, and to oppose the Pretender's? Are
not our laws made so strong, that it is high treason to do any thing
against your succession? Can any one pretend to suppose, that all the
clergy, all the men of the greatest estates in the kingdom, would at once
venture soul, and body, and fortune, to be in the interest of one, who puts
their religion and liberties in danger? Can any honest man pretend to
say, that all these people would voluntarily engage to be damned, to be
hanged, and to lose, at once, all their estates and liberty, from themselves
<PB N="569" REF="592"/>
and posterity? All I could wish is, that means could be found out to
quiet people's minds, and that the protestant succession should not be
more the cry of one party than the other; that it should be (as it is)
esteemed the good of both parties and of all the kingdom. I flatter myself
I have some place in your good opinion, else I durst not take the liberty
I do to assure you, that I know all the present ministry is as much, or
more sincerely in your interest than the last were. I had a very good opâˆ£portunity
to know it; for when the Queen was lately so ill, that people
began to make reflection, if she should have died, and being to be, by
my post, as first lord of the admiralty, one of the seven regents, or lords
justices, in case of a demise, I saw so entire and so strong a resolution
to adhere to the protestant succession, that I shall never be more in any
doubt about it. Let me beg, Madam, that what I have writ may be
kept to yourself, and that you will not show my letter, but burn it; beâˆ£ing
I only mean what I write for your own private information, being you
have always used me with that goodness, I may say kindness, that I can't
do too much to show my gratitude and real zeal for your interest. The
Queen, by all our relations, is so perfectly recovered, that she may live
many years; wherefore, I shan't be suspected of flattery, and were she
in a worse state of health, I durst not have ventured to write on this
to pick with the freedom I have done, for fear of a false interpretation."</P>

brought things so near a decision, that unless the states design to look on
and see us lost, and consequently themselves, they could no longer reâˆ£main
inactive, or delay entering into such vigorous measures, as are abâˆ£solutly
necessary to save us both. The first and great mark of their
present good disposition, is their secret resolution to set out, as soon as
possible, a strong squadron of men of war; for which they have found a
very plausible pretext, when their preparations are so far advanced, as
to oblige them to own it. They have likewise, in case of her Majesty's
death, agreed on the most proper means for assisting his Electoral Highâˆ£nesse
with their troops, and doing every thing that depends on them
for his service, which I omit explaining, since you have been particularly
informed of it by Monsieur Bothmar. I shall only add, that they have
promised to go on with their sea-preparations, though her Majesty shou'd
continue to languish on for some weeks longer; for it has been shewn
them, our danger would be greatest in that case, for it would give the
ministers time to concert every thing with France, for bringing in the Preâˆ£tender,
even whielst the Queen was alive; therefore, all measures to
support the succession of his Electoral Highness, would prove ineffectual,
unless a sleet was ready to obstruct the Pretender's passage, and to conâˆ£voy
such troops as must be sent to join with the nation, in order to resist
him.</P>
<P>Mr. Cadogan returns this week to the Hague, and intends, in a few
days after, for England; the meeting of the parliament obliging him to
hasten there. He hopes, before he goes, to receive the honour of his
Electoral Highness's commands; and our friends in England assure themâˆ£selves,
such vigorous resolutions will speedily be taken, as the greatness
of the danger requires. I have so often acquainted you with my thoughts
on this subject, as that makes it unnecessary to say any thing more of it
now. I have received the commission his Electoral Highness has been
pleased to honour me with. I must beg of you to make him my most
humble and sincere acknowledgements, for this new mark of favour and
confidence. I shall make the best use I can of it, for his service, in the
advancing of which I am always ready to hazard both life and fortune.
I constantly transmit whatever I receive of consequence from England
to Monsieur Bothmar, that he may comunicat it to the pensioner, at the
<PB N="571" REF="594"/>
same time he forwardes it to Hannover. As to what you desire to know
concerning Dunkerk and the English troopes on this side, Mr. Cadogan
having fully explained it in the last paper sent you by Mr. Bothmar, I
forbear troubling you with repeating it. I must desire you will assure
the Electoral Prince of my most humble respects, and that you will beâˆ£lieve

<P>"OUR friends having, for a long time, deliberated on the measures
they should take for the ensuing parliament, have at last agreed,
that their best conduct will be to meddle in nothing, and to propose noâˆ£thing
in parliament. The reason they commonly and openly allege is,
to show lord Anglesea, Sir Thomas Hanmer, and men of that character,
who have credit with the High Church party, and pretend to be our
friends, that it is not from a spirit of faction they have acted till now, and
they can be quiet, and do not desire forcibly to assume to themselves
the glory of securing the succession, but are ready to assign to them, the
Tories, all the honour and all the merit of it, and to promise to second
them, at the time, and in the manner they themselves shall prescribe.</P>
<P>Besides they saw, as they told Kreyenberg, that all their efforts would
be ineffectual, unless the Elector took some decisive step, on his side,
and they were not sure but he attributed their conduct more to private
than to public views. They would wait, until they heard what Mr.
<PB N="572" REF="595"/>
Harley did at Hannover, and what answer was given him, and they
would regulate themselves accordingly. This resolution made Kreyenâˆ£berg
very uneasy, as he was afraid it proceeded from despair, and from
an apprehension that they were blamed and abandoned by the Elector.</P>
<P>With regard to my lord Anglesea, I can venture to say, from my own
knowledge of him, that he is rather for the succession, than for the Preâˆ£tender:
but, at the same time, we may depend upon it, that he will do
nothing, but in certain circumstances, and that he will not break with the
court, unless the Elector or the Electoral Prince is here; and that is
the case of Sir Thomas Hanmer and of several others.</P>
<P>Lord Notingham urged Anglesea very much, to enter into measures
for proposing an invitation; but he always answered, that it was not neâˆ£cessary,
and that it could not be done with propriety, as the Electoral
Prince, in quality of peer, could come over whenever he pleased, and
as all the Oxfords in the universe could not hinder him."</P>

<P>"I Was informed, a few days ago, says he, that the Queen's miâˆ£nistry
triumph when they are together, especially in their drunkâˆ£enness,
at their having, at last, engaged her Majesty to order Mr.
Harley, to make it clearly known to the Elector and Electress, that the
coming of any one of the Electoral Family into this country, would disâˆ£please
her infinitely; offering them, in other respects, all the security
which they themselves would choose to ask, for further establishing the
succession in their family."</P>
<P>From thence Schutz draws several arguments for the coming of the
Electoral Prince, and then proceeds.</P>
<P>"You have been already told, that, of ten who are for us, nine will
accommodate themselves to the times, and embrace the interests of him
who will be the first on the spot, and who will undoubtedly have the best
game and all the hopes of success, rather than expose themselves, by
their opposition, to a civil war, which appears to them a real and an imâˆ£mediate
evil; whereas, they flatter themselves, that the government of
<PB N="573" REF="596"/>
the Pretender, whom they look upon as a weak prince, will not be such a
great evil, as a civil war. And we want to flatter ourselves, when we
imagine, that those who call themselves our friends, are such heroes, as
that the love of their religion, and their attachment to us, will animate
them sufficiently to expose themselves willingly to the greatest dangers,
to maintain the rights of a family, which is distant from them, and which
always shewed great indifference for the succession to the crown of these
kingdoms."</P>
<P>In another letter of the same date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Bothm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>r x. p. 303.</NOTE> he expresses great impatience to
know what impressions his arguments have made at Hannover. "Alâˆ£though
I ought to be at perfect ease, whatever turn affairs may take now,
as I did not neglect to give you all the necessary and suitable advices, I
own that I take the thing too much to heart, and find my situation disâˆ£agreeable,
to hear every day those whom you yourselves acknowledge to
be your best friends, complain that you abandon them, and wantonly
neglect our interests, notwithstanding their intreaties and their clear reâˆ£presentations
to you of the danger to which you are exposed; when, at
the same time, I understand, that in spite of all my importunities, there is
any hesitation to represent to our master, what concerns him so much to
know.</P>
<P>After repeating the complaints of their friends, and their resolution to
do nothing in parliament, as mentioned in former letters from himself and
from Kreyenberg, he writes, for the first time, about an affair which
Kreyenberg had mentioned in a letter inserted above, and which made a
great noise thereafter.</P>
<P>"Chancellor Harcourt, to whom it was proposed to send to me the writ
of the duke of Cambridge, without his being able to suspect that the proâˆ£posal
came from me, gave a very bad reception to the person who made
the motion to him, and strictly forbad his clerks to bring it to me, or to
give it to those who might call for it, without an express order from him.
You may judge now the reasons of this prohibition, and whether it proâˆ£ceeds
from himself alone. The writ is in his office, in all the forms,
with the great seal, and in a more authentic manner than the writ of
other peers, from whence one may judge, that the princes of the blood
usually had them.</P>
<P>I imagine you easily conceive the embarrassment I must be in, in regard
to this writ. A great many, knowing that the chancellor has not sent it
<PB N="574" REF="597"/>
to me, are surprised I do not ask it. Now, how can I do so, having no orâˆ£ders
from you? I own however, that this alone would not hinder me,
if I could flatter myself, that, after I shall receive it and send it by
express to Hannover, which I would have done if I had got it, the Elecâˆ£toral
Prince will immediately set out for this country.</P>
<P>Two things, he said, hindered him from asking the writ: he was afraid
that the chancellor would venture to refuse it; and that the Electoral
Prince, though he got it, would not come over."</P>

<P>"THE Queen, since she has been in town, called several peers into
her closet, and among others, the duke of Kent, to whom she
said, that she hoped, he would always join her ministers in all the affairs
that might be debated in parliament. But upon his answering, that he
would be always willing to declare himself for every thing, that would
be of real service to her Majesty in parliament, and for the good of his
country in general, she told him, that she intended to send lord Oxford
to him, that they might converse together upon that matter. He has
been actually with him for two hours, speaking as ambiguously as usual.
He wanted to prove he was a Whig, because it was by his means that
lord Cowper was made a peer; but when it was proposed to bring over
some one of the family of Lunenburg, he said, that; would be to place her
coffin before her Majesty's eyes; and that those who had any respect and
friendship for her, could never propose a thing that was so disagreeable
to her.</P>
<P>Those who have seen lord Anglesea and are his friends, acknowledge
that he is a great deal more cool than he was before he went to Ireland,
and he declines hitherto, to enter into what our friends propose to him,
One may judge by lord Orkney's discourses, that he will go with the
court-party, in every measure, as well as lord Lexington, whom the miâˆ£nistry
found means to satisfy. They say very openly, that money

<P>"KREYENBERG having written four pages about the complaints of
the Whigs, of their being abandoned, and their resolutions of doing
<PB N="576" REF="599"/>
nothing in parliament, and about lord Anglesea's conduct, ambition, &amp;c.
proceeds to give his opinion and advice in the following terms:</P>
<P>"With regard to the Tories in general, I am very far from calling them
all Jacobites; but the misfortune is, that they suffer themselves to be led,
and it is certain, they will never oppose the Pretender, at the hazard of
the smallest part of their fortune. They don't mince the matter in their
conversations; although they allow that their religion and liberty would
be more secure, by holding to the present establishment; yet they slatter
themselves, that by good laws, both the one and the other may be very
well secured. They are not the lowest class of people who reason in this
manner. It is but four or five days ago, that lord Guilford, speakâˆ£ing
to lord Cowper, as intimate private friends, about the rumours
which are current concerning the Pretender, told him sincerely, he could
swear he knows nothing yet of a formed design of bringing in the Preâˆ£tender,
and does not believe there is any; but I frankly acknowledge,
says he, that if matters ever go any length, the greatest part of us Tories
will willingly submit, while you Whigs will, perhaps, be fools enough
to expose your country to a civil war, and to be laid waste by the French
on the one hand, and by the Germans on the other."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg writes, that many of the Whigs would act, and that some
of them argued already in the same manner, and maintained, that nothing
could justify a civil war if they could possibly be safe without it. They
saw, that if the Pretender was once come over, it would be very easy to
hinder Holland or Denmark from giving any assistance: "and, what is
still worse," continues Kreyenberg, "the Whigs do nothing new; partly
from the want of power, and partly from their chagrin, at seeing themâˆ£selves
neglected and abandoned, and it will not be long before they will
file off, after the rest; I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/>ean, that they will all become Jacobites;
but one will retire to the country, another leave the kingdom perhaps,
and so on with the rest.</P>
<P>Till now, the Whigs in general allowed themselves to be governed by
Devonshire, Sunderland, Somers, Halifax, Townshend, Cowper, Oxford,
and lately by Nottingham likewise, merely from the opinion they have,
that these noblemen act in perfect concert with the Elector, and have
great credit with his Electoral Highness: but they begin to perceive,
that matters do not go on as they imagined; and as men seldom find out
<PB N="577" REF="600"/>
the true medium in things of this kind, they carry their reasonings farâˆ£ther
than is just. The duke of Argyle, since he has got a little into the
secret of the Whigs, appears to be greatly surprised, and God knows, if
in the humour he is in now, he will not join the first. He dropt some
words to me, the other day, which convince me that his blood boils, and
that he is a man who will consult only his own interest."</P>

<P>"LORD Halifax entreated me to inform you of what he is resolved
to do. He has charged those among the Whigs who have
most intercourse with the Tories, to tell them, that for his share, he
would not speak about the succession any more in parliament. That they,
the Tories, being out of question, the majority might do with regard to
it, whatever they pleased. That he renounced for ever all the advanâˆ£tages
which might result to him, in case the succession should take place,
and that they might take all the merit of it to themselves.</P>
<P>He made this declaration, only because he saw no other means of openâˆ£ing
people's eyes, and he has some design of making it in parliament.
According to his opinion, unless the Queen or the Pretender dies soon,
you may look upon the succession as lost. The blame, he says, cannot
fall upon him, since it is certain, that if you had followed, even lately,
his advice, and the advice of all your friends, you would have prevented
that article in the Queen's speech, by which the ministry boast they have
shut the door against any of the family who would choose to come here.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Hanmer, whom I saw yesterday, told me, that he did not
despair yet; but it is certain, that he was duped, by lord Oxford and
Mr. Bromley, in the affair of the address of the commons. Besides, lord
<PB N="578" REF="601"/>
Anglesea will not oppose the ministry, with whom some of his friends
tell me he is reconciled. In short, they will not contribute to bring over
any of the family, although they allow it is the only means of putting
the succession out of all danger; and the motive of this shameful conduct
is an apprehension that the Whigs may enter into employments, and all
the protections which the Whigs incessantly make to shew they renounce
them, appear to them incredible, and not to be trusted."</P>

<P>"HOPING that this letter will find you safely arrived, I acquit myâˆ£self
of my promise, to give you an account of the business of which
you spoke to me here. I shall begin with the proposal of the Electoral
Prince's journey to England.</P>
<P>The Elector, having known, long ago, that the Queen was averse
from seeing any of his family at her court, hesitated always for that reaâˆ£son,
to send the Prince, his son. However, he would have complied at
length with the importunities of his friends in England, if notice had not
been given to him, that Mr. Harley was charged by the Queen to inâˆ£timate
to him, that the sending the prince or any of the Electoral family,
would disoblige her highly, and that she would oppose their coming.
It is likewise easy to perceive, that her Majesty's speech to the parliament
referred to that. The Elector hopes therefore, his friends will consider,
that these circumstances render this journey impracticable, unless he has
a mind to come to an open rupture with the Queen. You and other
friends may judge, Sir, if that would be seasonable; if it would be for
<PB N="579" REF="602"/>
the advantage or disadvantage of the succession; and if affairs at home
and abroad are in a situation to justify such an extremity.</P>
<P>Since it appears then, to be impracticable to bring into the kingdom,
the successor, whom the laws destine to the throne, it will be the more
necessary to secure the protestant succession, by removing the competiâˆ£tor.
The Elector made instances for that purpose to the Queen, by the
late baron de Grote, who gave a memorial on the subject to the lord
treasurer: he will continue to do so; when Mr. Harley arrives, he will
give it to him in writing; and baron de Schutz will have orders to speak
in the same style at your court.</P>
<P>His Electoral Highness is of opinion likewise, that the regency-bill
should not be changed from a pretence of amending it. He will shew
Mr. Harley likewise, that he is satisfied with it, and that he wishes it
may be preserved entire, which baron de Schutz had orders already to
tell to the lord treasurer and to the rest of the Queen's ministers. If there
is any thing else to be done, for the greater security and further estaâˆ£blishment
of the Protestant Succession, his Electoral Highness resigns
himself to the opinions of his friends, who are the most competent judges
for deciding concerning the utility, or necessity, as well as practicability
of measures for that purpose.</P>
<P>The Queen's speech gives room to think, that the court intends to
make things, which concern the Protestant Succession, the subject of deâˆ£liberation.
It is to be wished, that the result may contribute to its firmer
establishment, and to be hoped, that there is no intention of making a
law to forbid the Protestant Successor to come into the kingdom, during
the life of the Queen. It would be injurious to him to be put thereby,
in some measure, on the same footing with the Pretender.</P>
<P>As to the rest, Sir, you will inform our friends of the good disposition
of this State in favour of the Protestant Succession, and of what they
were prepared to do, in case the Queen had died, and of what the Elecâˆ£tor
himself was resolved to do. The Queen's recovery does not make
them lose sight of these things. The Emperor's peace changes a little
the state of affairs; but he will continue in arms for three months yet,
at least, it being impossible to conclude the peace finally before that
time. Endeavours will be used. in the mean time to bring about an agreeâˆ£ment
between the Emperor and the States about the barrier, in order
that his Imperial Majesty may have a good number of troops in the Low
<PB N="580" REF="603"/>
Countries. He always assures the Elector, that he has the affair of the
Succession much at heart<NOTE N="â€ " PLACE="foot">Yet he listened, two months before, to a proposal made by the Pretender to marry an arch-dutchess. He even, in some measure, recommended his own sister to that prince.</NOTE>, and the King of Prussia likewise gives the
strongest assurances to the same purpose."</P>

<P>"AFTER having written to you a letter, which our friends may see,
on the three articles, of which we spoke together here, I take the
liberty, according to our agreement, of writing to you in particular, this
billet, on the article of pensions, especially as the answer, in that respect,
is not such as I could wish; for they write to me, that the Elector does
not choose at all to enter into that affair, believing that a beginning
might lead him into an expence infinitely above his income, as he has
not such a purse for things of that kind, as the lord treasurer. All
the representations which were made to him, on the subject, could not
bring him to a more favourable resolution.</P>
<P>My friend writes to me, that our friends in England should advance
this money without the Elector's interfering, being certain that they
shall be reimbursed, as soon as he or his mother shall come to the throne,
or as soon as a pension, in the mean time, is settled on the successor. I
imagine one must place something more than confidence in you, to make
this proposal to you. I entreat you, Sir, to give, agreeably to your friendâˆ£ship
for his Electoral Highness, the best turn you can to this denial. I
am persuaded that, excepting such expences, he will do every thing that
can be expected from him."</P>

<P>"FAR be it from me to pretend to complain of any minister the Elecâˆ£tor
thinks fit to employ; but, upon this occasion, I find myself
oblidged to take notice, least others should think fit to insinuate comâˆ£plaints
against me, that I think in public, and upon these occasions of
conferences, to see what yet remains to be done in favour of the proteâˆ£stant
religion. Monsieur Bothmar takes too warmly upon him to justify
the Emperor and Roman Catholic princes proceedings; for even count
Sinzendorf himself owned to us, that though the Emperor had that arâˆ£ticle
in the treaty of Riswick imposed upon him, yet since it was once
received, he would not do any thing to get it abolished; and it has but a
very ill air in the world for a minister of the Elector to begin always with
an insinuation in public, that the Queen had not done enough, that she had
it in her power, and that she should have made France declare in positive
words, that they would abolish the fourth article of the treaty of Riswick.
<PB N="582" REF="605"/>
He was answered, that if the Emperor would but declare as much on his
side, as the French King had done, that article would be as good as abolished.
Nay, Madam, I can assure your Royal Highness there was not a minister
of one protestant prince but took up the argument against baron Bothmar.
I told him, and repeated it, that the Queen had done, and would conâˆ£tinue
to use her most pressing offices, in concert with the States General,
to dispose France to consent to a plain abolition of that clause, in express
words, and hoped the princes of the Empire would do the same thing, on
their side, with the Emperor, at least to bring his I. M. to declare as much
as France had done. I told baron Bothmar, if we had really at heart the
prosperity and protection of the protestant religion, we should look forâˆ£wards,
and not backward (only to find out insinuations of reproaches
one against another); and I must, under the liberty your R. H. has alâˆ£lowed
me, say I was extremely surprised at the distinction baron Bothmar
alone affected, in naming the States before the Queen; for all the other
ministers returned the princes their masters' thanks, first to the Queen,
and then to the States, for the care they expressed for the interest of the
protestant religion in the Empire; but M. Bothmar, which was extremely
wondered at, and taken notice of by all, returned the Elector's thanks
to the States General, as well as the Queen, for their care, &amp;c. and,
throughout his whole speech, never named the Queen, in preference to
the States, but always said the Maritime Powers, as if the Queen and
States were either equal in dignity or power. I could wish this way of
explaining himself was altered; for others of the Queen's servants might
think it necessary to take more notice than I shall; for most sincerely
it shall be always my utmost endeavours to keep up a perfect good unâˆ£derstanding
between the Queen's court and yours, which is the only
reason I venter to give this information to your R. H. who I know
wishes that, on all occasions, those of your court shewed a particular defâˆ£ference
for the Queen, as I am persuaded your R. H. has, which you
have often expressed. I hope nobody has been so officious to write this
to England; and assure you, Madam, I have not done it, &amp;c."</P>

<P>"ONE of my intimate friends, who was, about two months last Auâˆ£tumn,
with the Chevalier de St. George, arrived here four days
ago. He speaks very favourably of him. That prince spoke to him
with great confidence, and did not conceal from him the good underâˆ£standing
between him and the Queen. He has news of her frequently
from the English who come and return for that purpose. He reckons
that all the Scots are undoubtedly in his interest."</P>
<P>His council were in doubt whether the Chevalier should land in Engâˆ£land
or in Scotland, in case of the Queen's death. He had a clergyâˆ£man
of the church of England with him, who officiated to the protestant
servants in his house above his own apartment; and it was thought he
himself would not scruple to change.</P>
<P>"He, the Chevalier," continues Martines, "he himself told the perâˆ£son
in question what was said to him by a quaker, who was much spoke
of some time ago, and who came from England to Bar on purpose to
see him. He said to him, when he entered the room, "Good-day,

James, the spirit desired me to come to thee, to tell thee that thou shalt
reign over us, and we all wish it. I come to tell thee that, if thou hast
need of money, we will give thee amongst us from three to four millions.'
The prince wanted to make him some present; but he did not choose to
take any, and went back directly to England. The prince made him
eat at his own table.</P>
<P>The protestant clergyman who is with him is brother to one of the
Queen's physicians. This physician sends to his brother, from time to

we derive our right to succeed to the crown. It is certain that the

<P>"IT was once very likely I was to have important news to send you
to-day, viz. that lord Oxford was without a staff, abandoned by
all the ministers, and the Queen herself, in some measure, prejudiced
against him. He asked her permission to lay down his office, when, at
the same time, he found some one to wait on the Queen, and tell her
that if she gave him his dismission, the whole Tory party would be ruined,
and that she would fall again into the hands of the Whigs. This apâˆ£prehension
appeared so terrible to her, that she tried all imaginable meâˆ£thods
of keeping him, and of reconciling him, two nights ago, with all
her ministers. If he had fallen, lord Nottingham would be at the head
of the treasury; as lord Anglesea would approve of him only, of all our
friends.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more useful to our affairs, than that this reconciliâˆ£ation
should not continue. There is reason to fear, that our enemies may
prevail on the Queen to give her consent to the Pretender's coming here,
in her life-time. Lord Anglesea discovered a greater inclination to deâˆ£clare
himself openly for us, during the quarrels of the ministry. The
duke of Argyle outdid himself in endeavouring to influence him, while
Mr. Hill and Sir Thomas Hanmer did every thing in their power likeâˆ£wise.
The Archbishop of York is to have a conference with lord Notâˆ£tingham
tomorrow, at which the duke of Argyle will be present. In
short, our friends neglect nothing, and they deserve that his Electoral Highâˆ£ness
should express his gratitude to them.</P>
<P>Be very attentive to the motions of the prince of Wales. I am assured
he left Bar-le-Duc.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 325.</NOTE> Lord Oxford says, it is in order to go to Switzerâˆ£land:
but he said so before, without its being true."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg wrote a long letter, of the same date, giving an account
of the divisions among the ministry. The treasurer himself told several
of his friends, that he would resign, and for that very reason, Kreyenâˆ£berg
did not believe him. He thought the cause of their dispute was, that
they could not agree about the measures for bringing in the Pretender (Boâˆ£lingbroke
being warm and precipitate, and Oxford slow and dilatory in every
<PB N="586" REF="609"/>
thing, hating to act openly); or that they were jealous who should have
most merit with him. Pretensions to the Queen's favour could not proâˆ£bably
be the cause of their quarrel; as they knew she could not live
long. Kreyenberg adds in a postscript:</P>
<P>"After writing this letter, I am informed with certainty, that the
Queen, at the solicitation of lady Masham, whom lord Bolingbroke
found means of gaining, had consented to the dismission of the lord treaâˆ£surer;
but that, the night before the last, there was a reconciliation on
certain conditions. It is more than probable, that this affair will be folâˆ£lowed
with a change of measures. The lord chancellor was for Bolingâˆ£broke,
and Mr. Bromley was neuter."</P>
<P>Schutz wrote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 331.</NOTE> on the 30 March,/10 April, that the Whigs employed lord Notâˆ£tingham
to tell again to Sir Thomas Hanmer and lord Anglesea, that
they entreated them to concur with them in the affair of the succession,
and that they would renounce all their pretensions to employments, and
do any thing the Tories could ask of them. They thought a change abâˆ£solutely
necessary for the safety of the nation, and that the easiest and
most acceptable to the Tories would be, to deprive lord Oxford of the
treasurer's staff, and to make Nottingham, his brother, and Mr. Hill
commissioners of the treasury. These proposals of the Whigs made no
impression on the Tories. They hated lord Oxford; but they were afraid
his fall would kill the Queen. "That is, in plain English," says Schutz,
"if she choose the prince of Wales should come and reign here, he must
be received, for fear of putting her out of humour."</P>
<P>"Hanmer assures me, that our acts are in no danger during this session,
and he will not allow that the ministry are against us, nor for the prince
of Wales."</P>

<P>"THE duke of Argyle brought about another meeting, last night,
between lord Anglesea and Sir Thomas Hanmer, at which he, lord
Nottingham and some others assisted. After a great deal of reasoning,
these three noblemen agreed upon the following articles.</P>
<P>1. To live in friendship with the Whigs, and to concert with them
what must be done to secure the protestant succession, and oppose the
Pretender.</P>
<P><PB N="588" REF="611"/>
2. Not to support lord Oxford, but to assist one another in depriving
him of his employment.</P>
<P>3. Not to allow the Treasury to be in the hands of one man; but to
put it in commission: that our friends leave them to choose, for that
purpose, as they may judge proper; all acknowledging that it was as neâˆ£cessary
as it was prudent, to have in the Queen's council two or three
persons who would be for the protestant succession, and in opposition to
the Queen's ministers.</P>
<P>They promise to join the Whigs in entreating the Queen, by an adâˆ£dress,
to repeat her instances to the duke of Lorrain to send the Pretender
out of his dominions; assuring her, that in case of a refusal, they would
put her Majesty in a condition to oblige the duke by force to do what was
desired of him. They will speak afterwards of Sir Patrick Lawless,
and intreat the Queen to send him away, and to order the Jacobites and
the Highlanders in Scotland to be disarmed."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg wrote a long letter of this date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 339.</NOTE> in which he acquainted
his correspondent with the changes in the army. Lord Stair was obliged
to sell his regiment to lord Portmore for 6000<HI>l.</HI> and the duke of Argyle
the company of life-guards to the earl of Dundonald, an avowed Jacoâˆ£bite,
for 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> of which the Queen gave 3000 <HI>l.</HI> The government of
the castle of Edinburgh was to be given to a Mr. George Hamilton, an
officer in the Dutch service, who was a soldier of fortune, and would not
surrender it, from fears of a forfeiture, as the duke of Gordon did, after
the Revolution. Colonels Sydney and Egerton, of the foot guards, broâˆ£thers
to the earls of Leicester and Bridgwater, had notice from Gwyn,
the secretary at war, that the Queen had no further service for them, and
that a thousand guineas should be paid to each of them, for their comâˆ£panies,
which they had bought for the ordinary price of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> Colonel
Paget of the guards had the same notice; but the price was not yet fixed;
and it was said that lord Windsor and general Lumley, though both
Tories, would lose their regiments. "The treasurer protests, that he
has no hand in these changes, and that these things are done without his
knowledge, as he says to some, or against his consent, as he says to
others."</P>
<P>"Nottingham was to have a final conference, last night, with the
archbishop of York, Anglesea, and the speaker, to see what they intend
<PB N="589" REF="612"/>
to do. He had full powers to tell them, that they had nothing to do,
but to order themselves the manner in which they would choose to be
supported by the Whigs; and that they might distribute offices as they
had a mind, providing they would take care of three things, 1. To seâˆ£cure
the protestant succession: 2. To re-establish the alliances broken by
the ministry: 3. To preserve the commerce of the kingdom. We must
wait for the issue, although there is nothing to be expected from Angleâˆ£sea,
and without him there is reason to believe the other two will do
nothing."</P>

<P>"M. De Plessen had a long conversation with the Queen, some
days ago, in which she spoke to him more openly than usual,
giving him to understand that, of the two parties which composed the
nation, one was suspected of being inclined to bring in the Pretender,
in her life time, and the other, some one of the family of Hannover;
but that she would oppose both the one and the other, with all her
force."</P>
<P>Plessen endeavoured to convince the Queen, that the Elector would
never agree to send over any of his family, without an invitation from
her Majesty and the parliament; but that it was necessary to assure
him, that no attempts would be made to infringe the acts of parliament,
which established his succession.</P>
<P>"She said, that, notwithstanding all the reiterated assurances which
she had given the Elector, that she was for his succession, it seems he was
not persuaded of it, nor believed that she was in his interests." Plessen
assured the Queen, that the Elector did not doubt of her Majesty's inâˆ£tentions;
but that he justly suspected those of her ministers, and said many
things to convince her, that she was bound in conscience to secure the

<P>"WHAT the Queen did lately, when it was intended to present an

leaves no room to doubt of her sentiments, with regard to that man.
She set all her ministers to work, and they spoke, one after another, in
opposition to it, and think they have made themselves masters of every
thing, when they got a clause added, by which it is left to her Majesty
to publish such a proclamation, when she shall find it proper, being very

of the princess Sophia, you demanded a writ of summons for
the duke of Cambridge, I let you know that I thought it my duty to acâˆ£quaint
her Majesty therewith.</P>
<P>I have accordingly laid this matter before the Queen, who was pleased
to say, that, not having received the least information of this demand
<PB N="592" REF="615"/>
from you, or in any other manner whatsoever from the court of Hannover,
she could hardly persuade herself that you acted by direction from thence;
that she, therefore, did not think fit to give me any other answer than this.</P>
<P>The writ for the duke of Cambridge was sealed of course, when the
writs of summons to all the other peers were sealed, and lies ready to be
delivered to you, whenever you call for it. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>

<P>"YOUR friends continue to assure me, that the coming of the Elecâˆ£toral
prince was absolutely necessary, considering that the fears of
the Pretender's coming were but too well founded. They were all deâˆ£lighted
with the order which the Electress gave me, to demand the writ
for the Electoral Prince; and before I did any thing in that affair, I
asked the advice of the following persons, and they were all of the same
opinion: Devonshire, Somerset, Nottingham, Argyle, Orford, Somers,
Cowper, Halifax, Wharton, and Townshend.</P>
<P>Anglesea being in the country, I could not consult him before last
night, when I saw him at Sir Thomas Hanmer's. He said, that you could
not do any thing more to the purpose; and that this is the last opportuâˆ£nity
of saving your succession; being very sure, that unless you apply a
speedy remedy, it will be too late before the end of six months, as every
thing will be then ruined.</P>
<P>Therefore, he, as well as all our other friends, conjure the Elector to
send over the Prince immediately, although the writ should be refused,
as his presence alone can re establish every thing yet; and as every thing
will be lost after taking such a step, if we go no farther. Sir Thomas
Hanmer is of the same opinion, and promised, as well as Lord Anglesea,
to employ his influence with all those who depend upon him in the house
of commons to make them declare themselves, assuring me he is fully
convinced the court will not be in a condition to hinder them."</P>

<P>"THIS last post, I receiv'd the honour of your letter of the 17th of
April, for which be pleased to accept of my most humble
thanks.</P>
<P>I send this letter by an express messenger, who is going to Mr. Harâˆ£ley,
with my letters to Hannover; and if you please, he wil carry any
thing you think fit to write. But that I may answer that openess whereâˆ£with
you so obligingly treat me, I do, in the most solemn manner, assure
you, that, next to the Queen, I am entirely and unalterably devoted to
the interests of his Electoral Highness of Hannover. This is not only
from the conscience of my oaths, but out of profound respect to the
Elector's great virtues. I may without vanity say, that I had the greatâˆ£est
hand in settling the succession. I have ever preserved the same opiâˆ£nion;
and it is owing to the declarations the Queen has so often made in
their favour, that the generality of the people are come to be for that
serene house.</P>
<P>I am sure, that lady Masham, the Queen's favourite, is entirely for
their succession. I am also sure, that the Queen is so; and you may do
me the justice to assure his Electoral Highness, that I am ready to give
him all the proofs of my attachment to his interes, and to set in a true
light the state of this country; for it wil be very unfortunate for so great
a prince, to be only prince over a party, wich can never last long in
England. And let me in confidence tell you, Sir, that there is but one
thing can be any way of prejudice to the succession in that family, and
that is the endeavour to bring them, or any of them, over without the
Queen's consent. Two courts in this country have been so fatal, and the
factions are so high, that it must be very mischievous both to the Queen
and to that serene house, to have any such thing enterprized, that may create
<PB N="594" REF="617"/>
a difference between the Queen and that family: that wil change the
dispute to the crown and the successor; whereas now, it is between the
house of Hannover and a popish Pretender.</P>
<P>I wil add but this one word, that I will assure you, that upon any adâˆ£vances
of kindness from the house of Hannover, I will pawn my life for
it, they shall receive most essential proofs of the Queen's friendship; and
I am sure, that is the best confirmation of their succession.</P>
<P>Be pleased to accept my most hearty thanks, and to believe me to be,
with the greatest respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most humble and most obedient Servant,

<P>"I Received, Tuesday after midnight, or to speak more properly Wedâˆ£nesday
morning, a letter from the chancellor, of which I inclose a
copy, and also of the letter I wrote to him, Tuesday after six o'clock.
You will see that they suspect me of having acted without orders; hoping
perhaps, that, after they have opened such a door for us, I shall be disâˆ£avowed,
which I look to without any uneasiness.</P>
<P>" I was yesterday morning at the chancellor's, to take the writ; but
he and all his clerks had gone out; so that I returned empty handed.
From thence I went to the lord treasurer's, who drew me aside and asked
if I had not the writ. I told him, I had not. He inquired if the chanâˆ£cellor
had not written to me, and I acquainted him how I had missed
him. He then said to me, that the Queen was very much surprised I
had never said any thing to her about it; adding, that she had never been
treated in that manner. I answered that my orders having been addressed
to the lord chancellor, I went to him; that I was surprised he did not
warn me of my mistake, if it was necessary to address myself to the
Queen, which he might and should have known better than I. He apâˆ£peared
to be in very bad humour, and much embarrassed.</P>
<P><PB N="595" REF="618"/>
Anglesea and all our friends think, that I have taken the only method
of obtaining the writ; and that it is for that reason they insinuate, that
the Queen complains I did not address myself to her, in which case they
would have endeavoured to divert the thing, with as much warmth as
they now employ to hinder the coming of the prince; and it is plain that
the embassy of lord Paget has no other design, especially as he is to set
out immediately. There have been, however, great rejoicings over all
the city, since it was made public that I had asked the writ for the prince;
and some have no doubts of his coming speedily, as others most certainly
fear it. The bells were ringing for some days past, and healths drunk
to his good journey.</P>
<P>The report which our enemies spread every where, and which found
credit with a great number, that we were very indifferent about the sucâˆ£cession,
will be considered as perfectly true, if, after having demanded
the writ, the Electoral Prince does not come over immediately.</P>
<P>I am come again from the chancellor's; although it was but 9 o'clock
in the morning, they assured me that it was an hour since he went out,
which I consider as if they had a mind to amuse me, and not to give me
the writ. The chancellor's letter, however, is positive.</P>
<P>I was this morning with Mr. Bromley, to express to him my surprise
at seeing by the chancellor's letter, and by the lord treasurer's discourse
to me yesterday, that the Queen thought it strange, that I did not adâˆ£dress
myself to her; repeating to him what I had said to lord Oxford,
and entreating him to inform her Majesty of it, who, I hoped, would
approve of these reasons, and not believe that there was any intention of
failing in the respect due to her, or of doing a thing that was disagreeâˆ£able."</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>In another letter of the same date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Schutz fils 8. p. 365.</NOTE> Schutz mentions the good effects
which the demanding the writ had already produced, and urges with the
greatest earnestness the sending over of the prince immediately. "The
court dispatched, last night, an express to Mr. Harley, who no doubt
will do all he can to intimidate our court, and particularly the Electress,
with complaints of the demand. But, in the name of God, do not hesitate
at any thing which he can say to you. It ought rather to determine you
speedily. This is the general opinion of all your friends, who deserve,
<PB N="596" REF="619"/>
on account of the danger to which they expose themselves, that you
should not lose a moment in coming to their relief.</P>
<P>Lord Anglesea, who was with me for an hour yesterday, is entirely of
the same opinion, and conjures the Elector to embrace this favourable
opportunity of preserving his right. All those who are for him believe
the coming of the Electoral Prince to be as salutary and advantageous, as
those who are against the succession are frightened at his coming. These
are two different motives; but they should be equally persuasive."</P>

<P>"I Am to acknowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">English copy.</NOTE> with the greatest thankfulness, your letter of
the 29th of March, which came safe, and has been communicated
where it was proper. All you mention with regard to the peace of Rasâˆ£tadt,
agrees entirely with our sentiments here, and the pains your court
is taking towards bringing the Emperor and the States to an amicable
accommodation, in relation to the Netherlands, together with the hopes
you give us of success in that grand affair, is a great encouragement to
all that wish well to the house of Hannover. There is one passage in
yours, where you seem to think it is impossible for the Pretender to make
<PB N="597" REF="620"/>
any attempt during the Queen's life. In this we are absolutely of anoâˆ£ther
opinion, for reasons, as we think, so very obvious to those who obâˆ£serve
with the least attention the present conduct here, that there is no
need of entering into particulars on this head; and this being the settled
notion of all your friends here, you will easily imagine, into how great a
degree of despair we were all thrown by that part of your letter, where
you mention the Elector's resolution of not sending the Electoral Prince
without a previous invitation. For it is but a small comfort to us, to see
how diligent and careful you are in taking remote precautions abroad,
whilst we are convinced that the danger is so imminent here, that we shall
in all probability be totally ruined before any of those supports can posâˆ£sibly
come to our relief. But now I must congratulate with you upon
Mons. le baron de Schutz's last orders for demanding the Electoral
Prince's writ of summons. This I can assure you is thought by every
body, both friends as well as enemies, to be the first step that your court
has made, that looks as if you were in earnest about the succession. Noâˆ£thing
can be more effectual, if it be supported by the immediate sending
the Prince, nor more seasonable than it was at this time; for the Queen
had just then given a most unkind answer, to give it no worse term, to
an address for the support of the succession, and when the house of lords
came to consider of this answer, the effect of the Electoral Prince's havâˆ£ing
demanded his writ appeared most plainly by the behaviour of a great
number of lords upon that occasion, though that news was not then pubâˆ£lickly
known. Mons. Schutz will acquaint you with the consternation
our ministers were under, upon this occasion, and the fright the chanâˆ£cellor
was in, lest it should be thought he had denied the writ. They
are so sensible that this step, if it be followed by the immediate coming
of the prince, will so effectually ruin their designs, and tend so directly to
the securing the succession from all future danger, that you may depend
upon their making use of all arts and contrivances imaginable to prevent
his coming. Neither threats nor flattery will be spared. They are so
intent and so bent upon prevailing with you to stop the prince, that they
will not rely upon Mr. Harley's dexterity, but have determined to send to
you my lord Pagett. You must, therefore, prepare to be very vigoâˆ£rously
attacked by way of message; they see the spirit of the people here
runs so high in your favour, that they have no hopes of bringing either
them or parliament up to any thing, that may discourage the prince's
<PB N="598" REF="621"/>
coming. They are, therefore, forced to turn all their views towards
you, and are reduced to the miserable necessity of trying whether they
can persuade your court to betray itself. I shall trouble you no farther
than only to give you the unanimous opinion of all our friends upon this
occasion. They are persuaded that you must be convinced by the manâˆ£ner
in which this writ was granted, that you have opened a most unexcepâˆ£tionable
way for the coming of the prince. It is plain, the writ would not
have been granted, could they, by law, have justified the refusing of it; and
the uneasiness they expressed, both when it was granted and since, shews
plainly they would not have failed to have attempted something in parâˆ£liament,
in order to have discouraged him from coming, could they have
had the least hopes of carrying it. From this we cannot think, but that
you must be satisfied that the inclinations of the people here are so
strongly in favour of the house of Hannover, that the prince may come,
not only with great security as to his person, but also that he will be reâˆ£ceived
with all the respect and honour that is due to him. But if, after
you have raised these expectations through the whole kingdom to the
highest degree by the step you have made, you shou'd be prevail'd upon
to abandon the thoughts of sending the prince, or be persuaded even to
delay it, such a proceeding will be so fatal, that no man can be answerable
for the consequences of it. I cannot conclude this without doing justice
to Mons. le baron Schutz, who has upon this and all other occasions beâˆ£haved
himself with so much zeal and prudence, that he has deservedly
got the entire esteem and consideration of all, both Whigs and Tories,
who are well affected to the house of Hannover."</P>

<P>"THEY have held frequent councils here, and continue to shew great
dissatisfaction; the lord treasurer having told me yesterday, that
he never saw the Queen in a greater passion. All the reason he alleges
to me for this is, that she had no notice from me of the demand which I
was to make of the writ, and although he could not deny but the chancellor
<PB N="599" REF="622"/>
prepared and delivered writs. From whence I wanted to prove to him, that
it was therefore to the chancellor I was to address myself, as he was the
minister to whose department such things belonged; besides that my orâˆ£ders
imported to go to him, and that he did not discover to me that I adâˆ£dressed
myself improperly; yet he said, that I ought to have addressed
myself to the secretary of state, or to him, who would not have failed to
advise very properly in the affair; protesting, that he had no serâˆ£vice
more at heart, after the Queen's, than that of the Electoral family,
and that he was vexed at what had happened, the Queen taking it as the
greatest mark of contempt that could be given to her, telling me, that
had it not been for this incident, her Majesty would have invited the
Electoral Prince to come to pay her a visit next summer; without recolâˆ£lecting
that he had told me, but a moment before, that she was too much
afraid to see any of the Electoral family here; and that, this alone exâˆ£cepted,
she would willingly grant every thing else that could be demanded
of her.</P>
<P>He heaped together several very unintelligible things in this discourse,
to which I made no other answer, than that having addressed myself to
the proper officer for a thing which the law determined in our favour, I
could not imagine that the Queen was angry at it, nor that she would inâˆ£terpret
wrongly a measure of that kind."</P>

<P>"I Cannot but repeat what I wrote to you already by the advice
of all those who have our interest at heart, about the coming of the
Electoral prince, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The advice which was given to me by lord Oxford, and confirmed by
Mr. Bromley, not to appear any more at Court, seems too violent, espeâˆ£cially
as the ministers say nothing to me, but that I should have adâˆ£dressed
myself to Mr. Bromley, instead of demanding the writ of lord
Harcourt; and without proving this by any example or argument, they
say simply, that the Queen takes it as a mark of contempt, although it
would have been contrary to the custom of this country, as well as to the
order of the Electress, to have applied the other way.</P>
<P><PB N="600" REF="623"/>
I acquainted our friends with every thing that happened to me, in the
course of this affair. I placed the same confidence in lord Anglesea and

<P>Lord Anglesea, who is very well acquainted with lord Paget, gives me
a bad character of him; saying, he is false and changeable. He believes, with several others, that his lordship will not go to Hannover; as the

<P>â€”"THE reason why Mons. Dalay makes difficulty to go to the foâˆ£reign
churches, which other ministers before him never did,
is, since the passing the bill of occasional uniformity, about three years
ago, which only affects those that are in employments of trust or profit;
so that my lord Morpeth, having none, did not lye under those difficulâˆ£ties
Mr. Dalay does. I make a doubt whether that act extends out of
her Majesty's dominions; but as it is a doubt, I would no more risque it
than I find Dalay will; and had it not been for Mr. Cadogan, I had not
minded it. But asking him, just after the act passed, to go with me to
the French church, to hear a famous preacher here; he told me, he did
<PB N="601" REF="624"/>
not know what I might do,<MILESTONE N="May." UNIT="month"/> but for him, he was not so fond of going to
any church, as to venture the loss of his employments, which he had not
then quitted: so I, having a chaplain of my own, have never thought it
worth venturing to go to a foreign church, but have constantly the comâˆ£mon
prayers in my family, and sermons every holiday."</P>
<P>"I am assured his (lord Paget) errand is, to explain matters, and set them
in so true a light before you, that no artifice of a faction, or party, for
private views and interest, may be able for the future to cause any inâˆ£quietude
between the Queen and your illustrious family. I took the liâˆ£berty,
at my last coming hither, to state that matter plainly to your Royal
Highness, who was so good as to make me the answer I could wish, both
in relation to your respect for the Queen, and your being of neither
party; and yet I am sorry to find your minister in England has lately
acted as if at least he was governed by the party that is against the court,
because the chief amongst them have not the chief employments at court;
and I am afraid his late behaviour is something resented, as being very
irregular, and neglectful of that respect due to the Queen: for though
by strictness of law, I believe a peer may demand his writ of the lord
chancellor, though absent, yet it is never done; but the lord chancellor
keeps it by him till such time as the absent peer returns and demands it
himself, to sit in parliament. I know this better than any man, it havâˆ£ing
been my case under several lord chancellors, as I have been abroad
ever since the first year her Majesty came to the crown, and having often
had leave to take turns into England, the chancellors have always kept
my writ till I came and demanded it to sit in parliament, which they
immediately were obliged to send me; and so it would have been with
the duke of Cambridge, whenever he should come into England to sit in
parliament. Upon his demanding it, the chancellor is obliged by law to
send it him immediately. This being so, what occasion had Mons. Schutz
to go, just at this juncture, and to demand it of the lord chancellor withâˆ£out
having previously acquainted some of the Queen's ministers of state,
or having first notified his intentions or orders (if he had them) to do
it to the Queen, by the secretary of state, for her Majesty's approbation,
which he might have been assured would not have been denied him, no
more than she did her leave to lord chancellor to deliver the writ, when
he asked her if he should do it? I must own to your Royal Highness, I
<PB N="602" REF="625"/>
am very sorry to see such things happen. Let the partys jar as they
please; but let not any thing happen, by any minister of yours, that
may be interpreted as if your illustrious family wanted all the confidence
and consideration imaginable for the Queen; who, I find, by Mr, Secreâˆ£tary's
letter, is herself a little startled at this way of proceeding of Mons.
Schutz; and, if you will pardon the liberty I take, I believe nothing
could have a better effect than your and the Elector's disapproving what
Mons. Schutz has done in this matter. As I certainly wish well to the
protestant succession in your family, and desire heartily the peace and
tranquillity of my country, I can't but apprehend for both, if some efâˆ£fectual
means is not immediately found out to put matters upon such a
foot as to convince the world, that there is a mutual good understanding
between the Queen and your Royal Highness's illustrious family; and
that you act on both sides, with the just consideration and confidence
you ought to have for and in one another. Your Royal Highness knows
my character and opinion of partys. You know my zeal for your inteâˆ£rest,
and, therefore, I hope will excuse this liberty I take, to beg of you
to consider seriously with the Elector your son upon some expedient to
put matters upon a foot of reciprocal confidence in the Queen and
your illustrious house. A King or Queen of England must govern by
the bulk of their people, and must never be tyed to one or t'other party;
which made King William, and all the Kings his predecessors, change
from one to the other party, as they had the majority of the nation and
parliament; and any King or Queen who would reign with a party,
against the majority of the nation, would have but a most uneasy life;
and God forbid I should live to see ever the Queen and her successors
struggling to support different parties."</P>
<P>"After all the foolish and malicious outcry of the danger of the Preâˆ£tender,
I have asked the people here, to tell me one thing done in his faâˆ£vour,
or one thing left undone to exclude him, and to secure your
succession; nay I have desired them to let me know what was desired, or
if there could be any thing more done to secure the protestant succession
in your illustrious house, and if they would tell me, I would engage it
should be done. And upon discoursing this matter t'other day with the
pensionary, he seemed convinced of the truth of what I told him; and
that there was no just grounds for this outcry about the Pretender, and
<PB N="603" REF="626"/>
that nothing could be of a worse consequence than the project talked of
by some Whigs, of getting the Electoral Prince over, and setting him
up for successor, in prejudice to your's and the Elector's right. The
pensionary told me upon this, that he would go and talk roundly to that
man, pointing to baron Bothmar, who was then in the Treves-chamber,
when I was in this discourse with the pensionary; and that he would afâˆ£terwards
tell me, if there was any thing the Baron could propose to be
done. He told me, after having talked to Bothmar, that all he had to
oppose was, that the Pretender was suffered to continue in Lorrain. Your
Royal Highness is judge whether the Queen can oblige the duke of Lorâˆ£rain
to send him from thence if he won't, and has engaged to France not
to do it; and what we can say more to France, when they answer us,
that they have punctually executed their treaty, by sending him out of
France; and yet that article, in our treaty, was looked upon as a hardâˆ£ship
on the French King; since even in the preliminaries, in 1709, they
did not oblige the French King so strongly as we had done in our treaty;
being all was said in those preliminaries was, that whereas the Chevalier
St. George had a mind to travel, the French King consented to it."</P>

<P>"THE news of baron de Schutz's departure, which at length spread
yesterday over all the town, have given occasion to reasonings of
every kind: our friends are pleased with it, but our enemies, who, since
the baron had been forbid to appear at court, had begun to take courage,
do not relish it much. I know from good authority, that the lord treaâˆ£surer
said some days ago to one of his creatures, that he never thought
that affair should have been pushed so far; and another person affirmed
to me, that he said that he apprehended he would be very soon disgraced;
that they wanted to oblige him to enter into the measures of those who
intended to establish the Pretender; and that the Queen was more deâˆ£termined
on that point than ever.</P>
<P>I have received the pacquet for the baron de Schutz; but the letters
which came by a secret address are not yet decyphered. I shall inform
<PB N="604" REF="627"/>
lord Halifax of every thing. I hope Mr. Kreyenberg will make the
compliments of thanks with which the Electress charged the baron de
Schutz for lord Anglesea, lord Abington, and the archbishop of York.
It will be the more necessary to make them to the archbishop, because it
is well known he is not yet quite firm in the good cause; and it is for
this reason some friends desired me to write to you, that a letter from the
Electress would confirm him much in the sentiments which he has begun
to discover.</P>
<P>I inclose the Examiner of this day. I would not have taken the liberty
of sending it to you, if lord Townsend was not of opinion that it deâˆ£served
to be read at Hannover."</P>

<P>"I Send you, Sir, the Examiner of this day, which makes a great noise
in town, and gives great pleasure to the well-affected. The author,
who succeeded Dr. Swift, is the lord treasurer's library-keeper; and none
of his papers, of which three appear every week, are printed without the
prime minister's knowing their contents; so that one may look upon this
performance as the interpretation of his sentiments.</P>
<P>You will see by this piece, that the Tories are so far from exclaiming
against the coming of the Electoral Prince, that they applaud it, and
pretend to have the principal share in his good graces. This we will not
envy them, providing they attach themselves to him as they appear reâˆ£solved
to do; and it is not to be doubted, but as soon as he appears, the
lord treasurer will seek his protection, and both parties pay their court
to him. There is no question, therefore, of sending the prince to be the head of a party, but to have the glory of uniting the two parties, who
will concur together in parliament to settle a revenue of 30 or 40,000<HI>l.</HI>
sterling upon him; but for this purpose, he must come before the end
of the session.</P>
<P>You see the Prince may come with entire security, and with the greatest
pleasure imaginable, and prevent the designs of the Pretender; whereas,
<PB N="605" REF="628"/>
by allowing them to break out, it would be necessary to come with sleets
and armies, and at an excessive expence, and be yet, after all, uncertain of
the success, which is now infallible, providing the opportunity is not lost."</P>

<P>"I Entreat you to be so good as to offer my very humble thanks to the
Elector, for the share he appears to take in my affliction for the
death of my daughter.</P>
<P>It is so evident, that the Queen's ministers are determined to place the
Pretender on the throne, that it would be losing one's time to produce
<PB N="606" REF="629"/>
proofs of it. Their greatest desire, and their only view in Mr. Harley's
embassy, is to obtain some declaration from the Elector, which may imâˆ£pose
upon the nation, and make it believe that your court is satisfied
with them. If you have fallen into this snare, it will render all the efâˆ£forts
of your friends of no avail; but we rely upon the great prudence of
his Electoral Highness.</P>
<P>A more proper time for demanding the writ for the Electoral Prince
could not have been chosen; for you see how many of the richest and
most considerable among the Tories declare for you, and acknowledge
that they were deceived by the ministry, who lose so much ground in
both houses, that you may depend upon it, they will take care not to
call the second session of this parliament, before they have executed their
design in favour of the Pretender; for otherwise they will run a risk of
being prosecuted, for having betrayed their country and violated the laws;
and as they cannot justify themselves in that respect, it is not to be beâˆ£lieved,
that they will expose themselves to the hazard of another session;
for if they lose any more ground, however small, their ruin is certain.</P>
<P>Luckily, this session is to continue for two months longer, as no supâˆ£plies
are yet found; so that the Electoral Prince will have time enough
before the end of it, to arrive and take his seat in parliament; in which
case the balance will incline entirely to your side, as it begins to do alâˆ£ready,
upon the mere rumour of his coming: so that you may judge
what effect his presence would produce. Accordingly our friends write
to me, that, in that case, the parliament will not rise before they have
settled a pension of 40,000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, for a subsistence to the prince,
who will have nothing to do but to make his court to the Queen, and
caress the ministers, without meddling in any thing.</P>
<P>By this remedy the succession will be secured, without risk, without
expence, and without war; and likewise it is very probable that France,
seeing herself prevented in that manner, will abandon her design of asâˆ£sisting
the Pretender.</P>
<P>In my humble opinion, it would be proper to use dispatch, and that
the prince should set out before lord Paget arrives. This journey of the
Prince, attended with the success which there is reason to expect from
it, cannot fail to give the Elector new influence, and much greater conâˆ£sequence
over all Europe; as he will secure to himself thereby the crown
<PB N="607" REF="630"/>
of Great Britain, which will attach the Emperor, Holland, and the
court of Prussia to him, and render him the arbiter of the differences of
the North. Whereas, if this opportunity is lost, (which, according to
appearances, will be the last), the contrary will happen, and the influâˆ£ence
of his Electoral Highness at other courts will suffer considerably by
it, especially after the great noise which this demand of the writ for the
Electoral Prince makes every where, which leaves no one room to doubt
of his setting out soon: so that if he does not set out at all, your friends
in England, who have exposed themselves so generously for your interests,
will be absolutely ruined, and the succession in the utmost danger, which
cannot fail to be productive of bad consequences to your court, in all
the other courts of Europe.</P>
<P>It is easy for your court to conceive of what importance it is, that the
Prince should arrive while the parliament is sitting, as the reason to justify
his journey is the right he has to take his seat in parliament, and the
writ by which the Queen calls him to it. I hope you will send me good
news.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Molineux will be now at your court. I recommend him
to you, as being a man of quality, who has very large possessions in
Ireland, but principally as a man of parts and of merit, with whose good
principles I am well acquainted. I flatter myself that he will be well
received by their Highnesses. I am, &amp;c."</P>
<P>"I may add further, that the Prince being but the third in the order of
succession, and coming alone without troops, the Queen cannot be justly
offended."</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Desiring the Pretender's removal.â€”A pension for the Princess Sophia.â€”Leave

of the Blood to such of the protestant Princes of the family as have none.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Delivered to Mr. Harley at Hannover, the 7th May, N. S. 1714.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Translation.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR Electoral Highnesses received, with the utmost gratitude,
the fresh mark of kindness which the Queen gave them, when
she ordered Mr. Harley to ask them, what they wanted to be done for
the greater security of the Protestant Succession established in their faâˆ£mily,
and also the obliging assurances he added to it, that her Britannic
Majesty would have a pleasure in granting whatever they desired in that
respect.</P>
<P>It is in reliance on this, that their Electoral Highnesses take the liberty
of representing to her Majesty the necessity of obliging the Pretender
to remove to Italy, and the danger which may result from his staying
longer in Lorrain, both to her Majesty's kingdoms and to her royal perâˆ£son,
and the protestant succession.</P>
<P>It is impossible to be more obliged to her Majesty than their Electoral
Highnesses are, for the instances which she has been already pleased to
make for the Pretender's removal. And as the present parliament, as
well as the former, have shewn they are persuaded, that the security of
<PB N="609" REF="632"/>
the nation and of the succession is connected with it, which is likewise
the opinion of their Electoral Highnesses, they entreat her Majesty to take
most effectual measures for attaining such a salutary end; and the more
so, the Pretender's adherents publish, with the utmost assurance, that he
is preparing to make a descent in the North of Great Britain, while the
kingdom is unfurnished with a fleet and troops; which is confirmed by
different advices received from persons who have been lately at Bar-leâˆ£duc,
and have a share of the Pretender's confidence, and who affirm that
he will begin very soon to execute his enterprise, and that he depends upon
a powerful foreign assistance.</P>
<P>"Affairs being in such a dangerous situation, their Electoral Highâˆ£nesses
hope, that her Majesty will own with them, that it is necessary for
the security of her royal person, and for that of her kingdoms, and of
the protestant religion, to settle in Great Britain some one of the Elecâˆ£toral
family, who would be attentive to such important concerns, and
shew her Majesty, by a fidelity and an inviolable attachment to her perâˆ£son,
how much their Electoral Highnesses are filled with respect and
gratitude towards her. The time appears to be now come, when the
security of their common interests cannot be found any longer but in a
reciprocal confidence, and in measures taken with perfect concert; and
when their Electoral Highnesses, as they do not expect the security of
their rights to the succession, but from the continuance of her Majesty's
goodness, are ready to contribute, on their side, as much as is in their
power, to defeat the designs of those who would choose to disturb the
tranquillity and felicity of her glorious reign.</P>
<P>"Their Electoral Highnesses likewise take the liberty of renewing the
instances they made near two years ago, to her Majesty and to her miâˆ£nisters,
for asking that such a pension and establishment should be settled
by act of parliament on her Highness the Electress, as the nearest heir to
the crown usually enjoyed. Their Electoral Highnesses did not choose
to form any pretensions in this respect, while the nation was burdened
with the expences of the war; but these expences being discontinued,
and as every thing ought to be put upon a sure and solid footing by the
peace, they hope, that during this very session of parliament, her Maâˆ£jesty
will be so good as to procure them a thing Which is so just, and
which is but a natural consequence of all that she has done already in
their favour.</P>
<P><PB N="610" REF="633"/>
"Their Electoral Highnesses hope likewise, that her Majesty will be
pleased to grant titles belonging to the princes of the blood of Great
Britain, to such of the Protestant Princes of the Electoral family, as are
not yet invested with them."</P>

<P>BOTH Whigs and Tories pressed Kreyenberg to represent the absoâˆ£lute
necessity of the prince's coming over, after the step which had
been taken. "The Queen," says he, "will at last reconcile herself to
it, and the ministers, at least the greatest number of them, will pay
their court to him. Anglesea, Abington, Orrery, and Sir Thomas
Hanmer declared, without being desired, that before the end of the sesâˆ£sion,
the parliament will make such a settlement for him as the Queen
had when she was princess."</P>
<P>Kreyenberg was convinced that the Queen and ministry would agree
to every thing that could be asked of them, if the prince did not come
over, and would perhaps sacrifice Bolingbroke, and turn others out of
the ministry: but he thought that would be done merely to amuse the
Elector until the parliament rose.</P>
<P>"The Queen sent for the archbishop of York, and made him the
greatest protestations, founded on conscience and sentiments of religion,
that she was sincerely for the protestant succession. This prelate cannot
reconcile all this with what he himself and every one sees. She said noâˆ£thing
at all of the coming of the Electoral Prince, but only of the disâˆ£obliging
manner in which the writ was demanded."</P>
<P>"It is confidently said now, and it appears very probable, that lord
Oxford has carried his point with the Queen, and is become prime miâˆ£nister.
It is believed that the affair of the writ contributed not a little to
this; as his lordship insinuated, with great address, that lord Bolingâˆ£broke's
violent conduct induced the Elector to take that step."</P>
<P>In the news which was sent this post in cyphers by Galke to Bothmar,
we have the following passages.</P>
<P>"Mr. Johnston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 404.</NOTE> who was formerly secretary of state in Scotland,
told l'Hermitage, that the plan was formed for bringing in the Pretenâˆ£der;
but that it was communicated only to four persons. He dined that
day with lord Mar, who married his niece. He said that he would go
in three weeks to Spa; and that, as he passed through the Hague, he
<PB N="613" REF="636"/>
would discover very important secrets to Mons. de Bothmar. He added,
that the coming of the Electoral Prince would remedy every thing; that
even the ministers, at least some of them, would pay court to him; and
that there was no other remedy for saving the nation and the succession,
but that it must be applied without delay, and before the end of the
parliament."</P>
<P>"They give out at court, that it is not the affair of the writ, but the
manner of asking it, which displeased the Queen; and for that reason
they affect to shew a thousand civilities to Kreyenberg, who has been
two following times invited to dine with the Lâ€”d Tâ€”r, who is
more than ever in credit with the Queen, and appears disposed to attach
himself to the prince, as soon as he appears, in order to gain him her
Majesty's good graces, and to overturn Bolingbroke."</P>

<P>"THE Queen's conversation with the archbishop of York, of which
Kreyenberg will have informed you, begins to make great noise.
It is confirmed now, that the Lord Treasurer is more in favour with the
Queen than ever he was. Bolingbroke is enraged at this, and it is not
doubted but he will take his measures upon it in a manner suitable to his
humour.</P>
<P>"L'Hermitage told me to-day, that lord Portmore employs all imaâˆ£ginable
persuasions to inspire the duke of Ormond, who is more firm
than ever in the interests of the Pretender, with more favourable sentiâˆ£ments
towards the succession; but that he has not been able yet, to

<P>"IF I did myself the honour of writing to you so seldom since I have
been here, it was to save you the repetition of the same news which
you received from the baron de Schutz and Mons. Kreyenberg; but now,
when every thing is at stake, and when our safety, and the security of
the succession depend entirely upon the journey of the Electoral Prince,
I consider it is my duty to represent to you, in the strongest manner I am
able, that if his Highness's journey is put off, the succession is inevitably
lost.</P>
<P><PB N="615" REF="638"/>
"One may say, that the whole nation expects the prince now with
the utmost impatience, and that there is such a general disposition to reâˆ£ceive
him well, that the ministers will be obliged to treat his Highness
with the respect which is due to him. But if the opportunity is lost,
this inclination may cool; they will think themselves neglected, and will
be capable, perhaps, of going from one extreme into another.</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly the reasons for the prince's journey become every day
more strong; you know them, Sir, better than any man; therefore I
shall only say, that all the Tories, excepting such as are entirely devoted
to the ministers, wish for the Prince's arrival with as much earnestness as
the Whigs; and there is reason to fear, that if the resolution of sending
him is changed, our new allies, lord Anglesea, the archbishop of York,
and the speaker of the house of commons, with their friends, will leave
us soon: for they declare publickly enough, that the succession cannot
be secured but by the presence of the prince; and they insinuated, that
if he does not come, they will be obliged to take other measures.</P>
<P>"You would see by the Gazettes, that the stocks rose very high since
the Prince's journey was spoke of; an undoubted sign of the good dispoâˆ£sition
of the nation; and, I think, I may assure you, that his presence
here will give us immediately a majority in both houses. The Tories
do not conceal their sentiments in this respect, and they say publickly,
that they only wait to see the Prince for declaring, against the ministers.</P>
<P>"The lord treasurer and lord Bolingbroke are more exasperated than
ever against one another. The lord treasurer found means of reconciling
himself with lady Masham, and boasts that he will very soon turn out
lord Bolingbroke, and the lord chancellor; and the treasurer's friends
begin, by private rumours, to charge these two noblemen with the deâˆ£sign
of bringing in the Pretender. In a word, this is a fine opportunity
for bringing over the Prince; and the ministers being come to an open
rupture with one another, the parliament and the people are impatient
to see him arrive, and the partisans of the Pretender cannot disguise their
apprehensions of this journey, which they consider as a mortal blow, to
all their designs."</P>

<P>"I Did myself the honour of writing to you the 4th instant, that I
would communicate, without delay, to the court of Hannover, the
letter which you was so good as to write to me the 25th of April. I have
done so; and I have had the pleasure to understand, that the assurances
of your good intentions and of your attachment to the interests of the
illustrious family, gave great joy at that court, and that they desire to
live in perfect confidence with you.</P>
<P>With regard to the Electoral Prince's journey; I am charged to tell
you, my lord, that when the Queen gave the prince the patent of duke
of Cambridge, and regulated the rank of the Protestant princes of the
family, as princes of the blood, by the act of precedency, which was
carried to them two years ago, by Mr. Harley, that court imagined these
were real favours, of which they might make use when the opportunity
offered, and that the Electoral Prince, when he made use of his writ of
summons, only made use of what was his right, and that, if he went to
England, it would be with an intention to continue inviolably attached
to the Queen and to her ministers, and to your lordship in particular;
wherein her Britannic Majesty would find her own safety and that of her
kingdoms against the attempts of the Pretender, who would not dare,
in that case, to think of an invasion. Besides that, the King of France
would have this reason to allege for dispensing himself from assisting
him, that there would be no means of doing it, as the family of Hannoâˆ£ver
was beforehand with him: so that nothing appears more conformed
to the interest of the Queen and the nation, than the sending over the
prince, which is evident, as the Jacobites fear it, as a mortal blow to
their hopes.</P>
<P>I hope, my lord, that you will have no difficulty of conceiving the
Elector's views, and I pray God, with all my heart, that the measures
taken to secure the Protestant Succession to the crown of Great Britain
may succeed, persuaded as I am, that the preservation of our holy reliâˆ£gion
and the safety of Europe depend upon it. Your lordship is in a
situation which enables you to procure so great a benefit, by uniting, still
more clearly, the Queen with the family of Hannover. In the name of
<PB N="617" REF="640"/>
God, my lord, employ your influence and your prudence to promote this
falutary end. You will gain the blessing of heaven, and the applause of
all honest men.</P>
<P>If you think that I can be serviceable to you in any thing, you will do
me a favour and a pleasure by employing me. I shall always shew that I
have nothing more at heart, than the establishment of the Protestant Sucâˆ£cession,
and the union of the two nations; and on all occasions, I shall give
you marks of the zeal and respect with which I have the honour to be, my
lord, &amp;c.</P>

<P>"WE live here in the hope of seeing the Electoral prince arrive, and
of seeing him introduced to parliament, by virtue of the writ
which was given; and this expectation is so strong, that a disappointâˆ£ment
will discourage entirely his friends and encourage his enemies.</P>
<P>I can assure you, it is the general opinion of people of the first conseâˆ£quence
and the well affected to the succession, (who are the majority of
the kingdom) that nothing can contribute more to render the Queen's
reign happy and safe, and at the same time secure the succession, as it is
established by the laws in favour of the family of Hannover, than the
presence of the duke of Cambridge among us, that being the surest
means to curb the great and continued efforts of those who act for the
Pretender, and give themselves out to be a very powerful party, with a
view of gaining over many to their faction at home, and of encouraging
France to send them the Pretender with French troops. Upon that asâˆ£sistance
their greatest expectations are founded. You may judge then at
Hannover, of what importance it is to prevent such an event, by sending
over the prince. I expect from you, with the utmost impatience, the
good news of his departure."</P>

<P>"THE Pretender's faction acknowledge that if the prince comes
over, their system's over-turned, and they invent lyes of every
kind, to destroy all hopes of the prince's coming, producing letters from
Hannover, which bear that Monsieur de Schutz has been disavowed and
very ill received, and that it is certain the Elector will not send the prince
to England.</P>
<P>Mr. Bromley, secretary of state, in particular, spoke in this manner,
which has thrown the Pretender's faction into transports of joy, and the
friends of Hannover, both Whigs and Tories, into the utmost despair.
I have heard several of them, and among others, the duke of Argyle exâˆ£claim,
if the Elector abandons us in this manner, and refuses to embrace
an opportunity so favourable, so easy, and so conformed to our laws,
sacrificing us, and abandoning us to the rage of our enemies, after all
that we have done for him, we have no further recourse, but to go to the
other extremity, and invite the Pretender to come over on tolerable terms,
and without a French army.</P>
<P>I entreat your Excellency to communicate this to his Electoral Highâˆ£ness.
Consider what advantage the Pretender's friends will draw from it,
and if, your friends being refused and disgusted, it will not be very easy
for your enemies to carry any bill they please. in parliament, for infringâˆ£ing
the acts of the succession, which they have attempted before now
several times, but without success. The boldness of these people goes so
far, that Sir John Packington, in a club of more than 80 Tories,
proposed that the parliament should order, the black box to be opened;
so they call the sealed instruments of the Electress, appointing a regency
in case of the Queen's death; but the affair was dropped.</P>
<P>This and some things still worse, will be brought now again upon the
carpet, if the prince does not come, for then your enemies will reassume
courage; and seeing that your court shews no resentment of the affront
done to your Minister, they will imagine, as you put up with every
thing, that every thing is allowable to them.</P>
<P><PB N="619" REF="642"/>
The pardon which the Queen granted to Doctor Bedford, author of
the bock on Hereditary Right, is the greatest affront which her Majesty
could offer to the Electoral family. I don't know if these things are
understood at your court, or if attention is paid to them.</P>
<P>They continue to dismiss all the officers, civil and military, who preâˆ£sume
to shew any attachment to the Hannoverian succession; and yet
they give out, that the Queen's ministers assure your court that they
have the greatest zeal and attachment to them. It would be very curiâˆ£ous
if they could succeed to persuade you of this.</P>
<P>My conclusion from all this is, that if the prince does not come over,
the succession is lost. The delaying his journey has had already the bad
effects I apprehended from it, having given time to the ministers to conâˆ£trive
new intrigues, and give life and courage to their party, which was
half extinct, and which laughs now at your friends every where, and asks
them, Where is then your duke of Cambridge? And where is your sucâˆ£cession?
Is it not more than a month since the Writ was demanded?
A proper resolution on the part of his Electoral Highness would make
them change their language soon.</P>

<P>"THE inexpressible impatience Which every one shows here, for news
of the Electoral Prince's departure, induces me to, take the liberty
of embracing every safe opportunity which offers, of repeating to you,
that every thing is irreparably lost if the resolution of sending him is
changed or delayed; for the earnest desire of seeing him here, having beâˆ£come
so universal, and augmenting every day, his coming is so absolutely
necessary, that I fear a longer delay may produce very disagreeable effects.</P>
<P>As to the Queen, she continues much indisposed: the St. Anthony's
fire [<HI>l'erisipele</HI>] which broke out in her leg and thigh, has considerably deâˆ£minished
the violence of her fever; but it is believed, on, the other hand,
that a mortification may follow. She sleeps little and eats nothing, and
she is in such dreadful anxiety, that her mind suffers no less than her body.</P>
<P><PB N="620" REF="643"/>
The quarrels between the treasurer and Bolingbroke are greater than
ever. It is true, their common friends reconcile them for a day or
two, but they quarrel more violently afterwards. The partisans of both
the one and the other give out, that their leader possesses all the favour
and confidence of the Queen; but it is impossible to write any thing posiâˆ£tively
on this subject, this scene at court having lately changed as freâˆ£quently
as the wind. The fact is, that these two ministers exert themselves
very openly, to ruin one another, and as this division among the leaders
reigns also among their followers, it is very certain, that if the Electoral
Prince comes over, both of them will be very soon overturned; to which
I may add, that at bottom, the treasurer would not be sorry that the
Electoral Prince were here, although he is obliged to declare and to
publish the contrary, for fear of losing entirely the Queen, who cannot
hear the prince's journey spoke of without putting herself in a passion,
and the more so, that she perceives the nation desires it with ardour.</P>
<P>What I write to you of the real sentiments of the treasurer, concerning
this affair, comes from his brother the auditor, who told it to general
Erle, from whom I had it. The treasurer has likewise commanded seâˆ£veral
secret negociations with the Whigs, since his credit has begun to
decline at court; and they have answered, that in case he will consent to
the coming of the Electoral Prince, and exert himself seriously to secure
the succession, they will not only forget the past, but they will
endeavour to support him and to maintain him in his authority and in
his office.</P>
<P>I imagine, Sir, that it is impossible to act in a more disinterested manâˆ£ner
than the Whigs do; and I am almost persuaded, that the presence of
the Electoral Prince will determine the treasurer to adopt that plan.</P>
<P>I shall expect, with great impatience to hear from you, and you may
write by the usual conveyance in the cypher which you gave me. I
make no use of it in this letter, because I send it by a lady who will deliâˆ£ver
it safely. The house of commons, adjourned, till Thursday. I

I do not choose to delay a moment to write to you about this, and to
communicate to you my sentiments, upon a subject of this importance.</P>
<P>I then freely own to you, that I cannot imagine, that a prince who posâˆ£sesses
the knowledge and penetration of your Electoral Highness, can
ever contribute to such an attempt; and that I believe you are too just to
allow, that any infringement shall be made on my sovereignty which you
would not choose should be made on your own. I am firmly persuaded,
that you would not suffer the smallest diminution of your authority: I
am no less delicate, in that respect; and I am determined to oppose a
project so contrary to my royal authority, however fatal the consequences
may be.</P>
<P>Your Electoral Highness is too just to refuse to bear me witness, that
I gave, on all occasions, proofs of my desire that your family should sucâˆ£ceed
to my crowns; which I always recommend to my people, as the
most solid support of their religion and their laws. I employ all my atâˆ£tentions,
that nothing should efface those impressions from the hearts of
my subjects: but it is not possible to derogate from the dignity and preâˆ£rogatives
of the prince who wears the crown, without making a dangerous
breach on the rights of the successors; therefore, I doubt not, but with
your usual wisdom, you will prevent the taking such a step; and that you
will give me an opportunity of renewing to you, assurances of the most
sincere friendship with which I am, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Luneville, <DATE>June 5, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"IT is likely that the chevalier de St. George is preparing for some
great design which is kept very private. It was believed that he
would drink the waters of Plombiere for three weeks, as is customary,
and that he would come afterwards, to pass 15 days at Luneville; but
he changed his measures: he did not continue to drink the waters, which
he drank only for 10 days, and came back to Luneville Saturday last.
He sets out to-morrow very early for Bar; lord Galmoy went before
him, and set out this morning. Lord Talmo, who came lately from
France, is with him, and some say, that the duke of Berwick is incogâˆ£nito
in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The chevalier appears pensive: that, indeed, is his ordinary humour.
Mr. Floyd, who has been these five days at the court of his Royal Highâˆ£ness,
told a mistress he has here, that when he leaves her now, he will
take his leave of her, perhaps, for the last time. In short, it is certain,
that every thing here seems sufficiently to anounce preparations for a
journey; it is said likewise, in private, that the chevalier has had letâˆ£ters
that the Queen is very ill.</P>
<P>I have done every thing I could to discover something of his designs.
I supped last night with several of his attendants, thinking to learn someâˆ£thing;
but they avoid to explain themselves. They only say, that
the chevalier did not find himself the better of drinking the waters, that
he would go now to repose himself for some time, at Bar, until he goes,
in the beginning of next month, to the Prince de Vaudemont's, at Comâˆ£merci,
where their Royal Highnesses will come likewise. They say,
they do not know yet, if they will remain in this country or not; that
they will follow the destiny of the chevalier; and that it is not known
yet what it shall be."</P>

<P>"YOUR letters leave me in an uncertainty whether the Electoral
Prince will come or not. Here they begin to believe the last. I
made no use of the reason which you give me, why the Elector has not come
to a determination, that is to say, the issue of the Queen's sickness, as
they would say, it is only a pretence. The Queen's dangerous situation,
they would say, ought to determine you so much the sooner. In short,
I do not know what to say to all this, and I don't believe you expect from
me that I should foretell what may be the consequence. We must wait a
few days to see more clearly.</P>
<P>All I can say at present is, that our friends are much dejected and disâˆ£couraged.
Some of them, as Sir Thomas Hanmer and others of his
party, intimate, that as this affair has spun out so long, and as the court
has had time to recollect itself and concert its measures, it would be more
proper, in such a state of things, to wait for the next session of parliaâˆ£ment,
and to see, in the mean time, what can be done. I own I cannot
agree with them in this, and all our other friends likewise, as Nottingâˆ£ham,
Townshend, Sunderland, Halifax, &amp;c. continue in their old opinion.
But they all in general think, that if the Elector does not choose to send
the Electoral Prince, it would have been proper and will be proper still
to declare so, in order that the Elector on the one hand, may take advanâˆ£tage
of it at this court, and that our friends on the other, may consider
of something else, and of the conduct they are to follow, to keep up the
spirits of their party."</P>

at the disapoyntment; this is what my correspondance write, the 29,
O. S. of May, and one thing more, which I think is deverting, that Mr.
Auditor Harley gives into these complaints, and say'd, that if the Electoral
Prince had imediately follow'd the demanding of the writte, it had, by
this time, put an end to the Jacobite ministers and party; how sinâˆ£cere
this is in my lord Treasurer brother, I believe you may be able to
judg of as well as any body, by what he has written to your court:
but this artifice and a great many others of the same kind, shew, that hee
thinks it of use to continue deluding people with such tricks, and preâˆ£tending
that he is for the succession in the house of Hannover, tho' since
he had the power, he never made one step that was not derectly against
it. Pray be pleased to take an opertunity of acquainting his Electoral
Highnesse, that my best frends think my being in England may bee of
much more use to the service then my continuing abroad, upon which I
design to return as soon as the parliament is up; and being very desirous
of receiving the Elector's commands, I have already written to Monsieur
Bothmar to meet me at Mordick, which may easily be done without
being known to any body. I shall not leave this place till the beginning

<P>"THE Queen coveting nothing so much, as that you may be able to
conciliate a firm and entire friendship between her Majesty and the
house of Hannover; I am commanded to acquaint your lordship, that
when you speak to the Elector upon her Majesty's good disposition, you
are to let him understand, she hopes it will meet with suitable returns.</P>
<P>Your lordship will endeavor to satisfie the Elector, the Queen has no
intention but to secure the succession to her crowns, as by law established,
in the house of Hannover, and is ready to do every thing that may conâˆ£tribute
to that end, consistent with the safe and quiet possession of them
during her own time.</P>
<P>Her Majesty having been very sincere in the public declarations she
has made, and in the assurances she has frequently given in favour of this
succession; she expects from the Elector, he will speak freely on this
subject; and particularly, if he thinks he has reason to suspect designs
are carrying on to disappoint it, that he will declare what foundation he
has for such suspicion. And your lordship will assure him, he may deâˆ£pend,
that no person shall be continued in her Majesty's service, he has
reasonable ground to imagine has other views; and if that can be made
appear, her Majesty will not fail to make examples of such persons.</P>
<P>Upon your lordship's arrival at Hannover, you will learn what resoluâˆ£tion
that court has taken about the Electoral Prince (the duke of Camâˆ£bridge)
coming hither, the demanding the writ for his setting in parliâˆ£ament
having given an expectation it was soon intended. Your lordship
will find such resolution is either taken or suspended; or a resolution
taken, that he will not come over without her Majesty's consent and
invitation.</P>
<P>If the resolution for his coming is taken or suspended, your lordship
will represent to the Elector, the great uneasiness his coming hither, at this
<PB N="629" REF="652"/>
time, will give to the Queen; how unseasonable it is, and that it may
endanger the succession itself.</P>
<P>It must make the Queen uneasie, as it will be thought to confirm a
jealousie, maliciously and industriously spread, of her Majesty's want of
sincerity and good inclination to the succession; and, as it will be underâˆ£stood
to gratify those who desire, and there is cause to believe, have soliâˆ£cited
his coming over, in opposition to her Majesty; it is unseasonable,
because of the divisions among us, which his presence, at this juncture,
will rather foment and increase, than compose and quiet. And it may
endanger the succession, as it will certainly cool the zeal of many now
well-affected to it, who, from their duty and regard for the Queen will
be disgusted with every thing that shall have the appearance of a conâˆ£temptuous
treatment of her Majesty; and who will apprehend such a
step to be a declaration of the faction, and entering into the heats and exâˆ£travagances
of a party, for whom they have so strong an aversion, that
they dread nothing more, than their returning again into power.</P>
<P>But if the resolution is taken, that the duke of Cambridge shall not
come without the Queen's consent and invitation, your lordship will let
the Elector know, that this deference and respect to her Majesty will lay
such an obligation on her, as will entitle him to all the good effects he
can expect from it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, your lordship will observe to the Elector, that a good
use may be made of this accident, of this attempt to bring over the duke
of Cambridge, in opposition to her Majesty, since the regards he shall
shew to her Majesty, on this occasion, must necessarily, create such a
friendship and good correspondence between her Majesty and him, as
must be very serviceable to their mutual interests. I am, with all possible
respect, my lord, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Matters begin to be in a situation which gives our friends reason to
hope for great advantages to the protestant succession. They flatter
themselves especially that they will be in a condition to overturn Bolingâˆ£broke.
They have concerted two ways for that purpose; the one by the
Queen, and the other by the parliament. With regard to the first, it
happens that Oxford, Shrewsbury, Dartmouth, Pawlet, and the bishop of
London, who are all of the cabinet council, are already gained; and that
there remains on the other side but Bolingbroke, Buckingham, Ormond,
Harcourt, and Bromley. Besides, the house of peers is to day on the state

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>29 June,/10 July, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HE had paid several visits, and found none of the ministers at home
but the lord treasurer and Mr. Bromley.â€”"I am just returned from
an audience of the Queen. She answered me with a very gracious manâˆ£ner.
I find her paler than formerly, but in other respects she looks well,
and seems to be in health, excepting that she cannot walk, nor stand up.</P>
<P>I was told here, that it is not lord Middleton himself, but his son, who
went to Vienna; and it must be certainly for a different purpose from
travelling, as he conceals himself there in a convent."</P>
<P>â€”6/17 July.â€”Bromley spoke to Bothmar of the publication of the
Queen's letters to the Electress and to the Electoral Prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 128.</NOTE>. It was susâˆ£pected
by some that Bothmar published them, but he convinced them
that he did not. Those who were for the Prince's coming over, were anâˆ£gry
at the publication of the letters, as it might produce bad effects
among the people, who would see by it, that the Queen had so much
aversion from a prince of the succession. The ministry continued to be
on bad terms.</P>
<P>â€”9/20 July.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>â€”"It is true the treasurer receives me very well;
but the question is, if he is sincere, and if he will still have power to
serve us. He deceived the Whigs, and perhaps himself. It is thought
he has patched up matters with Bolingbroke. I shall write to you about
this by a secret address."</P>
<P>The letter, which Bothmar promised to send by a secret address, was
written in cyphers; the copy of it which follows, is in Robethon's hand.</P>
<P>"It was believed that the examination of the treaty of commerce with
Spain would have given an opportunity of making Bolingbroke fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> if
<PB N="634" REF="657"/>
the treasurer, with his friends, had joined those who wanted to overturn
his antagonist. He had promised it by his brother, through whom asâˆ£surances
had been given him, that on that condition, they would support
him against Bolingbroke. But it seems they dared not attack the latter
directly, seeing themselves uncertain of the treasurer and of his friends,
while Bolingbroke endeavoured to gain lord Anglesea, Lord Abington,
and some others to his side. At last they contented themselves with atâˆ£tacking
only his friend Arthur More; so that lord Bolingbroke will
maintain himself in his post, and may be able to turn out the treasurer
by his credit with the Queen. The fall of the treasurer appears to be
very near, according to the opinion of his own friends. Some of those
who would have assisted him to bring down his rival, say now, according
to the maxim which prevails much here, that he does not deserve to be
assisted, as he does not choose to assist himself.</P>
<P>The reasons of his conduct in this situation of affairs are perhaps,
1. His own humour, which does not allow him to keep himself entirely
to one side. 2. The hopes of maintaining himself still in the Queen's
good graces, by the same means, by which he introduced himself into
her favour. 3. The hopes of entering again into favour, by degrees,
although he should now lose his employment, providing he does not deâˆ£clare
openly against the court party. 4. That he is engaged so deeply in
certain projects with lord Bolingbroke, that he dares not attack him
openly, for fear of being involved in his ruin; probably, all these reasons
contribute to influence his conduct.</P>
<P>He seems, however, to reckon upon the good graces of the Elector, and
to be inclined to pay attention to them, which Bolingbroke thinks inâˆ£compatible
with the service of the Queen; from which one might conâˆ£clude
what are his intentions, although they were not otherwise known.
We may be sure he will proceed rapidly, if the direction of affairs falls
into his hands. It is said now, that he wants to continue secretary of
state; but that Bromley will be turned out, and Sir William Wyndham
put in his place. That the treasury will be put in commission. That
lord Anglesea will be the first commissioner of it, and have alone the
vice-treasurership of Ireland, which he shared till now with lord Roâˆ£chester;
and that Shrewsbury will continue lord lieutenant of Ireland,
from whence they would infer that he will abandon the treasurer to
<PB N="635" REF="658"/>
unite himself with Bolingbroke, although others do not believe this on
account of the irreconcileable difference in their tempers."</P>
<P>â€”July 13/24.â€”The letter in Bothmar's hand of this date contains
nothing material;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover papers, vol. marked Bothmar x. No. 128.</NOTE> but the copy in Robethon's hand, of what Bothmar
wrote to him in cyphers, contains the following particulars about the
quarrel of the ministry.</P>
<P>"It is thought that a reconciliation is made by the mediation of their
friends; but that Bolingbroke has always most credit with the Queen.
They say, that not only the favourite but the dutchess of Shrewsbury is
secretly for him, by the persuasions of her daughter, who is married to
Sir William Wyndham.</P>
<P>These two ministers have been for a long time on bad terms, from
the opposition of their tempers and manners. But what gave occasion to
complete their diffidence of one another and their disunion, is a project
which had been formed, of dividing in 16 shares the profits which the
Queen was to have from the trade to the South-sea, of which five were
designed for the treasurer, five for Bolingbroke, four for lady Masham,
and two for Arthur More. The treasurer having had his reasons for reâˆ£fusing
the share destined for him, was suspected on that account, and at
last became odious to the other sharers. He afterwards furnished their
enemies with means of discovering this mystery, which gave them occaâˆ£sion
to examine the treaty of commerce without producing the effect
which they promised themselves from it, as the treasurer did not furnish
them with the assistance they expected from him, and as the prorogaâˆ£tion
of the parliament put an end too soon to the deliberations on that
affair.</P>
<P>The Queen's answer to the address of the lords, at which they are so
much offended, is ascribed to Bolingbroke. Lord Anglesea is particuâˆ£larly
offended, having been the author of the address, to which the Queen
gave that answer, and if her Majesty had not interrupted the debates by
her presence, matters, according to all appearances, would have been
pushed very far in the animosity of all the house of peers against Bolingâˆ£broke
and against her Majesty's answer. His lordship, they affirm, will
be prosecuted vigorously in the next session; but as he apprehends this
himself, it is feared he will bring over the Pretender before that time, to
<PB N="636" REF="659"/>
save himself and to finish his grand scheme, from which he expects the
completion of the fortune which his ambition promises him.</P>
<P>They ascribe to him likewise the Queen's speech; others believe it was
composed by the chancellor Harcourt. It displeases people here in many
passages; they are persuaded that the last article reflects on the Protesâˆ£tant
Succession, and on the intention of having one of our princes in this
country."</P>
<P>â€”July 16/27.â€”Bothmar having mentioned the quarrels of the miâˆ£nistry
adds:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar, 10. No. 128.</NOTE> "It is surprising, that the duke of Marlborough comes
over at such a crisis, and does not rather wait until it is seen which of the
two competitors will carry it with the Queen; lord Sunderland himself
does not comprehend this. I am told he will be the day after to-morâˆ£row
at Ostend, in order to embark there for this country. Cadogan has
been for eight or ten days in the country. He is expected back this evenâˆ£ing.
He said when he went away, that the duke of Marlborough
would wait for him at Antwerp. The impetuosity of the dutchess has
probably precipitated this journey."</P>
<P>There is a copy in Robethon's hand, of what Bothmar wrote, by this
post, in cyphers. He says the reconciliation of the ministry could not
be durable. Their quarrels continued, and he found it very difficult to
speak with them. His friends dissuaded him from pressing them to an
alliance with the Emperor and the King of Prussia for quaranteeing the
succession, lest they should afterwards think that the parliament demandâˆ£ed
it of the Queen, at the instigation of the Elector. His friends likeâˆ£wise
advised him not to ask, at this time, English titles for the prince of
the Electoral family, as that might be delayed without any inconveniency
until the next session of parliament.</P>
<P>"Lord Halifax," continues Bothmar, "thinks that the Elector should
have the title of prince of Wales, and that very little time is necessary to
prepare the way for that. They are surprised that the duke of Marlborough
is in a hurry to come here at this juncture. If he adheres to his old
friends, he will run a risk with the ministry; and if he wants to please
the latter, he will be abandoned by the former, without gaining much
upon the court. It is thought that the treasurer has led him into this
step, by the means of Cadogan; and that, at length, he will find himself
shifted off, as his old friends were, to whom the treasurer had promised
<PB N="637" REF="660"/>
likewise by Cadogan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> to second them in the affair of the Spanish comâˆ£merce,
of which promise he acquitted himself in the manner I wrote to
you by former posts."<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Bothmar x. No. 128.</NOTE></P>
<P>â€”July 20/31.â€”"I see by what you tell me of the King of Sweden,
that his return from Turkey will not be so soon. It seems to me, that his
minister here flatters himself with a real assistance from this court. I don't
see, however, that things are yet disposed for that. It is said he has hopes
from Bolingbroke, and wishes the Pretender were here already."</P>
<P>â€”23 July,/3 August,â€”"We are still in expectations here of a change in the
ministry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 130.</NOTE> There are some who believe that if the duke of Ormond reâˆ£signs
his employments, the duke of Marlborough will have the command
of the army; but I think there are many reasons for believing, that neiâˆ£ther
the one nor the other will happen. I imagine your Ker of Kersland
will embarrass you. Send him away speedily with a medal, <HI>Serve well
the best.</HI>"</P>
<P>â€”27 July,/7 August,â€”"The duke of Marlborough is not arrived yet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 132.</NOTE> It
is probable he wants to remain beyond the sea, until he knows that there
is a change in the ministry. It is certain that the treasurer will resign his
employment. I imagine I can write to you this very evening, that he
has actually done so. It was said to-day, that Mr. Boyle was to be first
commissioner of the treasury, and Mr. Bridges one of his colleagues; but
that neither of them would accept."</P>
<P>â€”30 July,/10 August,â€”"I am very curious to know if there is any foundaâˆ£tion
for what I write in my postscript to his Electoral Highness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> of a good
understanding between the duke of Marlborough and the Pretender.
His Highness himself can give a great deal of light in this affair, as I am
assured, that the lord treasurer showed him, by his cousin, the originals
of the letters between the duke and the Pretender. This correspondence
appears to me to be altogether incredible, it being inconsistent with all I
ever saw or heard of the duke. I refer myself to what I wrote about it to
his Electoral Highness, and to Mr. de Bernsdorf, entreating you to inâˆ£form
me in what manner they consider this affair. I don't recollect
it was to you or to his Electoral Highness himself, that I gave an account
of the communication of a letter, by an unknown person, to the duke of
<PB N="638" REF="661"/>
Marlborough, of which I speak in the same postscript; perhaps, that the
person who wrote to him that letter, has also forged an answer to it.
That letter consists in great reasoning on the weak state of the Protestant
Succession, and on the advantages which the duke might find in embracâˆ£ing
the part of the Pretender without running any risk.</P>
<P>I imagine they begin to reason much in the same manner at Vienna,
believing that our party is much weaker here, than it is in reality, and
that we will weaken it by our indifference, and that on that account, they
ought not to offend our competitor, by too much opposition to him, who
can the more easily mount the throne here, that we are indifferent about
it. I write that it would be proper to undeceive the court of Vienna of
this mistaken opinion."</P>
<P>"P. S. This instant, at half an hour after nine, the duke of Grafton
coming from Kensington, tells me, that all the physicians can do to make
the Queen throw up two vomits of antimony, produces no effect either
up or down, and that they believe she will not live out the night. I
have so much company in the house, that I find it difficult to write
to you."</P>
<P>In another letter to Robethon of this date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Misâˆ£cell. d'Etat. No. 4. No. 7.</NOTE> he acquaints him, that there
was a change in the ministry, that Oxford and Buckingham had resigned,
and that the Queen was dangerously ill.</P>
<P>â€”31 July,/11 August,â€”"I write to you but these two lines.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. marked Bothmar 10. No. 132.</NOTE> You will know
every thing by my dispatches to his Electoral Highness, and by Mr.
Craggs who brings them to you. The Queen is at the last extremity,
and, according to all appearances, another express will soon follow with

you shall find the Elector in a good disposition.</P>

Nothing certainly can more contribute to their mutual interests, than
a perfect good understanding between her Majesty and his Electoral
Highness; and as your lordship is a very proper, so I hope you will be
an happy instrument for settling the friendship upon a firm and lasting
foundation. The way to obtain it can never be by such a conduct as her
Majesty has, at this time, too much cause to complain of; and which, I
am directed particularly to mention to your lordship.</P>
<P>There has been printed here, as your lordship will see by the inclosed,
the letters her Majesty writ, on the 19th of May last, to the late Electoress
Dowager and to the Electoral Prince. The copies can only have been
obtained from Hannover; and, therefore, it is her Majesty's pleasure,
that you take notice of it to the Elector, and let him know, that she is
concerned to meet with such treatment, which she thinks she has not
deserved.</P>
<P>I am directed to acquaint your lordship, that the Queen has removed
my lord treasurer, which you are to take notice of to the Elector; and,
at the same time, to let him know, that this domestic incident shall
make no alteration, with respect to public affairs. The Treasury will be
put into commission.</P>
<P>When your audiences are over, your lordship will be pleased to give
me a full account of your reception, that I may lay it before the Queen,
who desires to know all the particulars relating to it. I am glad your
lordship has had a good journey to Hannover, and hope your success there
will be very prosperous. I am, with all possible respect, &amp;c.</P>

ardent wishes, providing the king came over soon. His presence would
prevent any disturbances, even in Scotland, where they were apprehended.
He sent the King a letter from the duke of Shrewsbury, who wanted to
be chamberlain, and would resign his place in the Treasury and the lord
lieutenancy of Ireland, which Bothmar proposed first should be given to
the duke of Ormond, when the duke of Marlborough got the command
of the army. But he thought afterwards, it would be better to place the
duke of Ormond at the head of the prince of Wales's household, as beâˆ£ing
fitter for a court than for any other employment, and to make Sunâˆ£derland
lord lieutenant, and Stanhope commander in chief in Ireland. Orâˆ£mond
could not subsist without his pension. Sunderland shewed always,
and continued to shew more attachment to the King than any other.</P>
<P>â€”August 6th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Misâˆ£cel. d'Etat. No. 1.</NOTE> O. S. Bothmar, in a letter to Baron Bernsdorff of
this date, mentions Mr. Steel's services to the family of Hannover, and
recommends Dr. Hill for the bishoprick of Ely, the duke of St. Albans
to be captain of the band of gentlemen pensioners, lord Halifax to be
first lord of the Treasury, Mr. Boyle and Mr. Walpole to be his colâˆ£leagues,
and lord Orford to be first lord of the Admiralty, in the room of
lord Strafford, "who knew nothing about the business. The duke of
Marlborough came to town yesterday, amidst the acclamations of the
people, as if he had gained another battle at Hochstet. He will be of
great service, if the Pretender makes any attempt. He is not pleased,
that he is not of the regency, and that there is any man but the King
higher than him in this country."</P>
<P>Bothmar recommended to allow Shrewsbury to retire, to satisfy Marlâˆ£borough
and Sunderland, to provide for Stanhope and Cadogan, and then
to think of doing something for lord Somers.</P>
<P>Kreyenberg wrote to Robethon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 9.</NOTE> in a letter of this date, that the King
had been proclaimed very quietly over all England, and that they exâˆ£pected
to hear he had been proclaimed in the same manner in Scotland
and in Ireland: that it was thought the Jacobites would not stir, unless
they were assisted by France; and that the French ambassador declared
his master was determins to observe the Treaty of Utrecht.</P>
<P>August 10th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 1</NOTE> O. S. Bothmar, in a letter to Baron Bernsdorff of this
date, acquaints him, that things go on very quietly in England. The
<PB N="641" REF="666"/>
King has been proclaimed very quietly at Edinburgh, and probably will
be so likewise in Ireland, where some propose to send general Stanhope,
while others think he will be made more useful in the English parliament.
He recommends to deprive lord North and Gray of the government
of Portsmouth, and to give it to general Erle, and to make this change
before the King's arrival. He hopes the house of commons will grant the
King for life the same civil list they gave the Queen, and that the ensuing
parliament will augment it on account of the Prince's family. He forâˆ£wards
a letter to the King, from lord Manchester, who had been ambassador
in France and at Venice, and secretary of state at home, and now
begs only to be made a gentleman of the King's bed-chamber; a favour
which Bothmar recommends to grant to him; but he proposes that no
answer should be given to his lady, who wants to be one of the Princess's
maids of honour. He recommends brigadiers Honnywood and Dormer
to be made grooms of the bed-chamber; the last having been recomâˆ£mended
by the duke of Marlborough. He thinks it will be sufficient
now to give general promises to such as ask favours, and to fulfil them
when the King has formed his plan. "He may then turn out in general
all the late Queen's court and council."</P>
<P>He writes to Robethon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Misâˆ£cell. d'Etat. No. 10.</NOTE> of the same date, that a great change had hapâˆ£pened,
by the King's accession to the throne of these kingdoms; and that
things go on very favourably for his Majesty. It is reported that they
are arming and preparing transports in France. This is not probable;
but preparations are made to guard against it, and 15 ships will be
soon ready. It is surprising that Mr. Prior sends no intelligence of these
things from France, and that lie writes in cyphers things which he might
very safely write plain. Some members of the regency suspect that letâˆ£ters
are concealed from them.</P>

<P>THE archbishop of York and Sir Thomas Hanmer recommended Dr.
Hill to Bothmar for the bishoprick of Ely;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 1.</NOTE> but lord Townshend
told him it would be proper to give it at the recommendation of the good
old archbishop of Canterbury.â€”Mr. Cadogan told him, that lord Sunâˆ£derland
wanted to be secretary of State: in case the King chooses to
gratify him, Bothmar proposes that Townshend should be provided in
<PB N="642" REF="667"/>
another place. Lord Wharton and several other noblemen proposed to
him to recommend colonel Tirel to the King for one of the grooms of
his Majesty's bed-chamber. Bishop Burnet recommends his own son;
but Bothmar thinks it would be better to give him some employment in
the law. Mr. Santyan wants to be a commissioner of the customs in
England, and Ridpath desires to be made one in Scotland.</P>
<P>The Prince cannot take the title of Prince of Wales, until the King
creates him. The duke of Bolton recommends his brother-in-law, Mr.
Crofts, to be a groom of the bed-chamber. Lord Winchester's eldest
son asked the same favour for himself. He is well made, but irregular
in his conduct, and on that account is on bad terms with his father.
Lord Hertford, the duke of Somerset's eldest son, wants to be a groom
of the bed-chamber to the King or to the Prince. Townshend and other
friends recommend lord Lincoln for such a place. Lord reâˆ£commends
himself. Bothmar thinks the King should give such a place
to lord Dorset, to recompense him for his journey, and make lord Orford
first lord of the Admiralty, "before lord Strafford applies to be contiâˆ£nued;
and likewise to recall that man soon from the Hague; that will
please the Dutch and a great many here. He is not only hated, but
likewise despised by his countrymen, as a vain man, who has not the
smallest pretensions to be so."</P>
<P>The duke of Buckingham requested, that his dutchess might be made
a maid of honour to the princess. "She is handsome, and appears to
me sit for such a place; but she could not obtain it from the late Queen,
although she was her natural sister. I don't know if it was for that
reason she did not choose to have her so nearher, but preferred rather to
give her a pension." The duke of Grafton, whose mother had married the
Speaker, Sir Thomas Hanmer, desired likewise to be of the King's bedâˆ£chamber.
Bothmar gives him a high character, and recommends him.</P>

<P>"I Easily observe here, that those who are called the Tory-party have
very good intelligence from your court, and that you recommend
strongly a proper conduct to them. Three months ago they treated us
as seditious on account of the zeal we shewed for the succession, at a time
when we believed it to be in danger: since they see it confirmed, they
dispute to be for us. However, they had the indiscretion to shew themâˆ£selves
Saturday last, more than they intended, by their opposition to the
act for putting a price on the head of the Pretender. I can assure your
Excellency I do not say so from a spirit of party. I shall be the first to
rejoice to see that the King may succeed in annihilating parties, and in emâˆ£ploying,
without distinction, those who are the best affected and the most
capable. But I own I distrust such a sudden change, and cannot help
remarking to you, that a great change in offices is necessary, in order to
be able to say, that you are not governed by a party: for as they are now
given, they are in the hands of the most violent of a party, of whom the
most moderate had left them.</P>
<P>I ask your Excellency's pardon for the liberty I take. If what I have the

<P>THE Marquis de Torcy asked Buys, the Dutch ambassador at Paris,
if his mailers intended to interfere in the succession, and said they
had better not. The French Ambassador at the Hague did not congraâˆ£tulate
lord Strafford. "He," Strafford, "is become as smooth as a
glove; he caresses me now: he shewed me immediately the letter which
his Majesty wrote him: he entreated me to write that he offers his house
to the King. I am persuaded it will be agreeable neither to the States nor

judge him worthy of the honour of receiving so great a Monarch."</P>

particulars about the King's journey; the manner in which the Dutch were

men, that may be useful to his Majesty, I shall be very free to communiâˆ£cate
them to so faithful a minister. I was mightily pleased with the King's
letter to the lords justices; it was so clearly and so judiciously writ as
gave universal satisfaction. I wish, while the King is at the Hague, he
would concert measures with the States to secure the navigation of the
Baltic. We find the reputation and interest of England lost and sacriâˆ£ficed
in all parts of the world; the Spaniards, the Algerines, and several
other nations insult us in the Streights; the Danes and Swedes in the
North; and if Providence had not, in this juncture, called the King to the
throne, our trade had been every where destroyed: if, therefore, his Maâˆ£jesty
can retrieve our sinking commerce, he will gain the hearts of all his
people. The Dutch were quite wearied out with the double-dealing and
tricks of this court about their barrier: if the King, by his good offices,
could adjust that between the Emperor and the States, it would be a
great glory and happiness to his Majesty; they being the most useful alâˆ£lies,
both to the King and these nations. I did not doubt that the King
would approve what we had done to put a stop to the league which was
framing against the Emperor in Italy; and I thought nothing could be
more agreeable to the King than the making a strict union between him
and the court of Vienna. The affair of Portugal is fully set out in our
letter to his Majesty; and I will trouble you no further, but to assure you
that I am your most, &amp;c.</P>

Pretender's agent, and in whom the Jacobites placed more confidence
than in Iberville, was recalled.</P>

<P>"I Entreat you not to think of putting the expence of your tables, or
any other expence for the court which you bring along with you,
upon the civil list here: that would be directly contrary to the laws
which exclude strangers from offices and emoluments in this country.
Such a pretension would exasperate; and so far from giving any room
to hope for a mitigation of that law hereafter, would suggest to them to
make it still more severe, when they saw that we pretended to elude it,
as France eludes treaties.</P>
<P>If the King pays out of his finances at Hannover all the court which
he brings from thence, it will be of infinite advantage to him, in gaining
the opinions and affections of the nation. It will show his disinterestedâˆ£ness,
his generosity, his rectitude and regularity in every thing. The
very proposal of charging that expence upon the civil list, would not only
deprive him of that advantage, and give a quite opposite idea of him,
but would likewise create great difficulties with the ensuing parliament
about the augmentation of the civil list, which, without such an unseaâˆ£sonable
proposal, there is room to hope for, as also for a mitigation of the
law I have just now mentioned.</P>
<P>Besides this, we may depend upon it, that this pretension of maintainâˆ£ing
our Hannoverian court in this country, at the expence of England,
would not be admitted; and, instead of ascribing them to the King's geâˆ£nerosity,
that he is at that expence out of his Electoral revenues, they
would ascribe it entirely to the refusal he met with here. As you yourself
answer the arguments drawn from the customs of the court of France, I
have nothing further to say to you about them. You will easily conceive,
<PB N="650" REF="675"/>
that you would not be welcome to the English, with the offer of a
French example for their imitation. I flatter myself you will find my
reasonings so solid, that this proposal shall never be mentioned again."</P>

<P>BOthmar delivered to the regency the King's message about Boling-broke:
he wishes his place may be given to lord Townshend, though
Sunderland asks it. "Lord Bolingbroke makes up Mr. Prior's dispatch,
which may very well happen to be the last. He said formerly, that he
would never serve the Elector: he did not believe then, that the time
would ever be when he would be taken at his word." Bothmar inclosed
a letter from lord Mar, and another from lord Bolingbroke, to the
King. Bolingbroke wrote about his dismission, for the regency had deâˆ£prived
him of the seals. He desired to speak to Bothmar the next day,
and probably on the same subject.</P>
<P>Sept. 3d.â€”Bolingbroke had been with Bothmar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> He attributed his
disgrace to the insinuations of Oxford, whom he suspects of having misâˆ£represented
him to the King. Oxford endeavours to persuade the world
that, by his influence with his Majesty, Bolingbroke was turned out, in
order to create a belief that he will have still the giving away of employâˆ£ments.
He hates lord Nottingham, and, to prevent his being president
of the council, he advises the duke of Devonshire to apply for that place,
in order thereby to keep lord Powlet in his office of master of the houseâˆ£hold;
and what is still more entertaining, he says that, unless this plan
is adopted, he will be obliged to make Powlet president of the council.</P>

which they promise themselves from his Majesty's accession to the throne.
I take the liberty to send you, inclosed, a poem written on this occasion,
by one of our most eminent hands, which is indeed a master-piece in its
kind; and though very short, has touched upon all the topics that are
most popular among us. I have likewise transmitted to you a copy of
the preamble to the prince of Wales's patent, which was a very grateful
talk imposed on me by the lords justices. Their Excellencies have orâˆ£dered
that the lords and others who meet his Majesty be out of mourning
that day, as also their coaches; but all servants, except those of the city
magistrates, to be in mourning. The shortness of the time, which
would not be sufficient for the making of new liveries, occasioned this
last order. The removal of the lord Bolingbroke has put a seasonable
check to an interest that was making in many places for members in the
next parliament, and was very much relished by the people, who ascribed
to him in a great measure the decay of trade and public credit. You
will do me a very great honour, if you can find terms submissive enough

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor has thought proper to annex to this volume an Appendix, conâˆ£taining
a short review of such papers, in Nairne's collection, as were not
deemed sufficiently important to be inserted. He has also subjoined some account
of papers collected by Carte, relating to the affairs of this kingdom before the Reâˆ£storation,
in the year 1660. There are many letters, correspondences, memorials,
and anecdotes concerning the reign of George the First, still in the Editor's hands.
These he designed to have printed; but he finds that this volume has already
swelled to a size that precludes him, at present, from executing his purpose. They
shall, however, be soon given to the public. In this Appendix the order of time
is not observed, as in the preceding collection. The papers omitted are marked as
the volumes presented themselves to the Editor's hands.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="biography">
<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bundle of loose papers.</NOTE>Life of James II. Written by himself.</HEAD>
<P>KING James the Second was born, on the fourteenth of October, 1633, about
twelve at night. He went out of London, with his father, the Queen, and
the princess Mary, to Dover. He was sent back to St. James's; prince Charles
only going to York. About Easter, the marquis of Hertford was ordered to bring
the duke to him. The marquis had received an order from the parliament not to
carry the duke of York out of town; yet he did. He went with the Palsgrave,
and other lords and gentlemen, to Hull; the King intending to follow the next
day. Sir L. Dyves came, the next day before dinner, and told the governor, that
the King would dine with him. They were on a platform, by the water-side.
The governor turned pale. He desired the duke and company to retire to their
lodgings. The gates were shut and the garrison put in arms. The King came;
and, seeing the gates shut, asked to speak with the governor, who excused himself
from letting him enter, as trusted by the parliament. The King gave reasons, in
vain. The governor had received advertisement from York, from William Murâˆ£ray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was, afterwards, created earl of Dysert.</NOTE>,
one of the King's bed-chamber, as a friend, advising him not to let in the
King; who was resolved, if master of the town, to secure him and cut off his
head. Nothing was more false, yet it had effect on Hotham.</P>
<P>The King then desired, that his son and the rest might come out to him. They
were, accordingly, sent out, one after another. He then went back to Beverly
<PB N="658" REF="684"/>
and York. In Hull, there was a magazine of arms and amunition, for above
twenty thousand men, and a train suitable. The King could not arm a hundred
men. Had he not sent Sir L. Dyves before, he might, perhaps, have been adâˆ£mitted,
and would then be master of the town, which was affectionate to him; and
the gentry attending were too numerous for Hotham to resist. The soldiers of the
garrison all threw down their arms, being called upon, by some of the King's train
without, to do so; nor did they take them up again, till their officers, with their
swords in hand, forced them. Some vigorous, bold men, that went with the duke
of York, should have been trusted with the design, with an order on the rest to
obey the duke. For it was in their power, several times after Hotham ordered the
gates to be shut, to have secured him, or knocked him on the head: Either would
have done the work. Hotham came into the duke's room without any officer with
him, where he had before confined the duke; yet none seized the opportunity.
Sir L. Dyves and William Murray, groom of the duke of York's bed-chamber,
were the only ones for such a step; and were resolved to kill him. But they were
confined, before they could do it, and a guard put upon them; yet they were let
out with the rest.</P>
<P>The King wanted money and arms. The Queen sent captain J. Strahan, with
arms and amunition and officers in the Providence, from Holland; else, the King
could not have formed an army. Captain Strahan brought them into the Humber,
where least expected; so run a-ground at a place appointed. He went from Brill
to the Humber. The signal was not answered. He was forced to anchor, when
the tide was spent. The parliament ship of fifty-four guns came down from Hull
and anchored, with another from Grimsby, near him. They ordered him aboard.
But, commanding one of the King's Ships, he refused. He waited till afloat, and
then stood towards Hull, till near high-water. He passed over a sand, then but
twelve feet water; and, when past it, ran a-ground. The parliament's ships
drawing more water, were not able to follow. The Providence drew but eleven
feet and a half water. He got into the other channel, by bearing up with all his
sails. The parliament's ships, trying to follow, stuck fast. Strahan landed at
Powle, some miles below Hull, on the same side of the Humber; and ran his ships
ashore; so that it served for a battery to defend itself, whilst the arms were landed,
and the seamen and officers were intrenched; so that Hull garrison durst not attack
them. A convoy was sent from York. The King would not let the ship be burnt,
after the guns were taken out and carried to York. The seamen were made
gunners.</P>
<P>Essex's men were posted in the vale near Keynton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642. Oct. 23.</NOTE> The King marched down
the hill to fight them. Ruthen, who had served as major general under the King
of Sweden, and the earl of Brentsord, being ordered to draw up the army, Lindsay
<PB N="659" REF="685"/>
took it ill, and said he would serve as colonel; and put himself at the head of his
regiment of foot posted against Essex. The King's army was above four thousand
horse and eight thousand foot. The rebels were three thousand stronger in foot;
but had not many more horse, and few cannon. It was three <HI>p. m.</HI> before the King's
army were embattled; when they marched slowly, but with great resolution; reâˆ£ceiving
the rebels shot, till they came to push of the pike. Both sides retiring, as
if by mutual consent, back a few paces, struck down their colours and stood firm,
till both drew off, when it began to grow dark. The enemy's left wing fled, as
soon as charged. They were pursued, without falling on the foot. The enemy's
foot made the King's retire to their cannon; which, playing with success, stopt
them. Prince Rupert could not stop his horse from pursuing, or make them charge
the foot. Lord Willoughby's gallant behaviour over his father's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The earl of Lindsey, who died, soon after, of his wounds at Warwick. He was an

with his thigh broke by a musket-shot, and carried him to bs dressed. But he was
taken, by some straggling horse, who came in the way. Sir Edmund Verney was
killed and his standard taken. But it was recovered, by the means of Sir James
Smith. Both armies retired to their former posts; and the King sent, early next
morning, five hundred horse, which brought off his own cannon, and six of the
enemy's. Sir Faithful Fortescue had given notice of his intention, some days beâˆ£fore.
There were not full one thousand, on both sides, slain; as the parson, who
buried and counted them, said. Lord Aubigny and lieutenant-colonel Monro
were among the number. The earl of Lindsey died of his wounds at Warwick.
About sixty standards were taken from the rebels. The King marched to Edgert
and Banbury, taking the castle; and so to Oxford. But it was of fatal conseâˆ£quence,
that he did not march to London; which, in the fright, would not have
coil him a stroke.</P>
<P>Ruthen, the day after the battle, desired the King to send him, with most of the
horse and three thousand foot to London, where he would get before Essex, seize
Westminster, drive away the rebel part of the parliament, and maintain it, till the
King came up with the rest of the army. But this was opposed, by the advice of
many of the council. They were afraid that the King should return by conquest;
and, said so openly. They persuaded the King to advance so slowly to London,
that Essex got there before him; and the parliament, ready before to fly, took
heart. All the King's old foot were lost in the siege of Gloucester and battle of
Newbury.</P>
<P><PB N="660" REF="686"/>
The duke of York might have escaped from Oxford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648. April 20.</NOTE> if Sir George Ratcliff, his
governor, would have suffered it, without a positive order from the King. He
was carried to London, where the duke of Gloucester and the princess Elizabeth
had been left, when the King went to the North. The earl of Northumberland
was made his governor. All respect was used to him. George Howard, brother
to the earl of Suffolk, and colonel Joseph Bampfield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His real name was Bamford; an Irishman.</NOTE> contrived his escape; the
first carrying all the messages between the duke and Bampfield, which was all he
had to do.</P>
<P>All things being prepared, the duke of York supped, at the usual hour, about
seven, with his brother and sister, and after supper all played at hide and seek, with
the rest of the young people of the house; having played at it constantly every
night for above a fortnight before. The duke used to hide himself in a place
where they could not find him, for half an hour or more; and then he would
come out to them. To prevent suspicion of his being gone, when he really was,
the duke lockt up a little dog, that used to follow him, into his sister's chamber,
to prevent his coming after him, slipt down the back stairs, went into the innerâˆ£most
garden, and so into the Park, out of a back door of the said garden, of which
he had a key, where Bampfield staid for him; having a footman with a cloak,
which the duke put on, with a peruke he had ready, and went through Spring-Gardens,
where one Mr. Trip staid with a hackney-coach, which carried them to
Salisbury-house. Here the duke and Bampfield went out of the coach, as if
going in there; and Trip went with the coach into the city, and kept it as long
as he could, at the end of the town. But as soon as the coach was gone, they
took boat and landed on the same side of the river, close to the bridge, and went to
one Loo's, a surgeon, where they found Mrs. Murray, who had women's cloaths
ready for him to put on. He was drest presently, and went with Bampfield to
Lion-key, where there stayed a four-oared barge for them. They went in it down
the river; the tyde serving them.</P>
<P>But they no sooner entered the barge than the master suspected something;
Bampfield having told him to be there with his barge, and he should bring a friend
with him, not saying it should be a woman. He thought something more was
in it, and was so frightened, that, as they went down, he did nothing but talked
with them, how impossible it was for them to pass by the Block-house at Gravesâˆ£end,
without being discovered; and that they had no other way to get on board
the ship that staid for them at the Hope, but to land at Gravesend, and get a pair
of oars to carry them down. When they debated the distance, and shewed him the
hazard of getting a boat to carry them to the ship, he objected, the light of the
moon. He was soon satisfied fully, that his woman was some disguised body of
great quality. For, peeping through a cranny of the door of the barge, where
they then had a candle burning, he saw the duke put his leg upon the table and
<PB N="661" REF="687"/>
pluck up his stockings, in so indecent a manner, as made him conclude what he
had before suspected. This confounded him so, as he told them afterwards, that
he hardly knew what he did or said; which they perceiving, thought it best to tell
him the truth and trust him, knowing him to be an honest man. So the duke told
him who he was, and assured him, that he would take care to provide for him; and,
if it was not safe to return to London, to carry him to Holland. The man's mind
was now settled. He resolved to pass by the Block-house, without going ashore;
and, when they came near the town, he put out the light; let the barge drive down
with the tyde; passed undiscovered by the Block-house, and got to the ship, a
Dutch pink of seventy tons, lying for them, at the upper end of the Hope. She
had been cleared at Gravesend, where Sir Nicholas Armourer, colonel Mayard,
Richard Johnson, three gentlemen, with each a servant, expected them, whom
Bampfield had trusted and sent before, that, by their help, he might master the
vessel, if need.</P>
<P>They set sail, at break of day, with a fair wind, and anchored early next mornâˆ£ing,
before Flushing, where they staid, expecting the tyde to carry them up to
Middleburg. The master, with two of his four hands, went ashore with the boat
to Flushing, intending to be back, by the time the water was high enough to
go to Middleburg. But before he came back, Owen, master of the barge, who
came along with the duke, came down, in a great fright to the small cabbin,
telling them that a parliament frigate was coming in to look for them, and would
be with them presently; and that they must get their anchor on board and sail for
Middleburg. He was positive it was a frigate. The two seamen would not get
up anchor till the master came back. But they were forced by the gentlemen and
servants to do it; though they said there was not water for it, and the ship would
be lost. The ship proved only a merchantman. The vessel struck twice or thrice.
But the master coming on board, and the tyde serving, they got to Middleburg,
before the tyde was spent. The duke landed in women's cloaths, staid all night,
went next morning to Dordrecht; and sent Bampfield, next day, to the Hague,
to acquaint his sister and the prince of Orange of his arrival, and to desire cloaths.
He was missed, in an hour's time, at St. James's. When he was not sound, on
search, notice was given to Whitehall and general Fairfax.</P>
<P>Rising in Kent.â€”Rainsborough commanded a squadron in the Downs of one
second rate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May, 1648.</NOTE> three or four fourth, one fifth, and three or four sixth rates, and some
ketches; the Constant-Reformation, Convertin, Antelope, Swallow, Satisfaction,
Hind, Roebuck, Pelican, Constant-Warwick. These, on notice of the three
castles being surprized and seized, by the insurgents, declared for the King.
Rainsborough seeing that they of Deal had been instrumental in it, went on board
a ketch to go nearer to the shore, the better to see what was doing there, and thence
sent orders to his ship to get under fail, and stand as near as they could to the
<PB N="662" REF="688"/>
shore, in order to batter the town. Accordingly, they worked to get their anchors
on board; and in doing which, in the Constant-Reformation, Rainsborough's ship,
and heaving out the capstern, one of the boatswain's mates, Robert Lindale,
thought it the proper time to execute the resolution, which he had taken some time
before, of doing something to serve the King. Having opened himself to three
more common seamen, whom he had found to be of his principles, he proposed,
as all Kent had declared for the King, to get some of the ships to do so. They,
now, as heaving the capstern, began to grumble at the orders received; saying,
they had no reason to batter Deal, which was full of their wives, children, and
relations, to destroy it and them. This working on the men, they ventured
further to say, that it would be better to join with them for the King. On cryâˆ£ing,
one and all, for the King, Lindale told them, he believed that the lieuteâˆ£nant
and some other officers of the ship would be against it, and they must immeâˆ£diately
possess the gun-room and arm themselves; and then they might seize their
officers and those that would not join them. They did so; secured their officers,
telling them they would declare for the King; and, as they would not comply,
they put them in the hold, till they let them go ashore, and such as had a mind to
go with them. The officers were forced to submit. This done, he got under
fail, and, passing along the broad-side of the next ship, told them what they had
done, and bid them seize their officers, in like manner, else they would sink
them; and thus, from ship to ship, till every one had declared for the King.</P>
<P>Rainsborough, seeing his ship had got under sail, and yet not come up to him,
as he ordered, but speaking to one another, went to them with his ketch, and asked
his own ship what they were doing. They told him, he must not put his foot in
it, they having declared for the King; but would send him his servants and some
of his officers. They did so; and, on his beginning to talk with them to return
to obedience, bid him hold his tongue or they would fire on him. So he went
away in his ketch up the river to acquaint the parliament. The other ships turned
out all their commanders, then came ashore to tell the Kent gentry what they had
done; and to desire some that were seamen to come on board and command them,
as Sir William Palmer, captain Bargrave, captain Foy, and others did, and put
in other officers. Before they got out of the Downs, the earl of Warwick came
down in a ketch from the parliament, to get them to return to their duty, and
desired to come on board of them. They sent to know first what his business
was. He offered pardon, redress of grievances, if they would declare for the
parliament. Their answer was, they valued not the promises of parliament:
that they had declared for the King, and would be loyal. The earl shewed a
letter, by which he had been invited down by some. All these were sent to him.
He desired one of the ships, for his better accommodation, to carry him up the
river; promising, on his honour, to send it back. They let him have the Nicoâˆ£demus,
a sixth rate, but he did not keep his word.</P>
<P><PB N="663" REF="689"/>
They then went to Holland, where the duke of York was, to receive the
prince's commands, and arrived at Helveotsluys. The duke went and staid on board
with them, till the prince came by sea from France. He took the command and
failed for the Downs; leaving the duke in Holland, and having first discharged
Bampfield, an unquiet, intriguing head, from his brother's service. His tamperâˆ£ing
with the seamen, and driving on a presbyterian interest, so offended the duke,
that he would never take him again into his service, whatever application was
made. Yet he supplied him with what he was able, in his condition, till the Reâˆ£storation.</P>
<P>The prince, about the end of summer, came with the fleet to Helveotsluys.
The earl of Warwick, with the parliament-fleet, followed to the same port. The
Dutch would suffer no hostilities; and Warwick returned. Prince Rupert, who
was made commander of the King's ships went with prince Maurice to Ireland,
Portugal, the Streights, and the West Indies, where prince Maurice and some
ships were lost. Prince Rupert returned to Europe, in 1653, and landed at Nantz.
The duke of York went to Paris, a few days before his father's murder. The
King came thither, in his way to Ireland, where nothing considerable remained
in the rebels hands, but Dublin. But he staid all the summer at St. Germains, or
in Jersey, till the end of September, where he landed on the twenty-sixth of Sepâˆ£tember,
and received an account of the rout near Rathmines. All thoughts of
Ireland were laid aside; and the two ships sent by the prince of Orange to transâˆ£port
him, were sent back to Holland. Addresses were made there from Scotland,
by one Windram, an honest gentleman. The King resolved to return to Holland
to treat with the Scots. The Queen-mother met him at Beauvois. After some
days stay, he proceeded to Holland. He agreed with the Scots commissioners, and
went to Scotland. The duke of York staid at Jersey, till the September of 1650.
He went to Paris, by the King's orders, on the seventeenth. But he left it on the
fourth of October, and came to Brussels on the thirteenth of the same month,
where he staid till the middle of December. The prince of Orange died of the
small pox on the sixth of November; and the princess was delivered of a son on
the fourteenth, eight days after his death.</P>
<P>He went to the Hague, and staid till the twelfth of January, 1651, when the
English ambassador was there received; and then went to Breda. But, some
days after, he returned to the Hague. In June he was ordered, by the King, to
return to Paris, and follow the Queen-mother's advice. He arrived there in the
end of June. The King landed about the middle of October, at Fescamp in
Normandie; and coming to Paris, cardinal de Retz brought him a vast sum of
money in his coach, which the King would not receive, not knowing when he
should be able to pay it. The cardinal shewed himself very affectionate to him.
He proposed his marriage with the duke of Orleans'a daughter. The King visited
<PB N="664" REF="690"/>
her often. But she grew cool; being put in the head of marrying the King of
France, and that the Queen-mother would be forced to consent to it. So the match
was broke off Mademoiselle, only daughter of the duke of Longueville, by his
first wife, sister of the cardinal Soissons, was, at the same time, proposed for the
duke of York; the greatest match, next to Mademoiselle, in France. But the
court of France would not consent. The duke went a volunteer in the campaign
of 1652.</P>

<P>Papers which passed between the earl of Melfort and M. de Legny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13, 14.</NOTE> director-general
of the commerce of France, about passports for six Scotch ships, in Februâˆ£ary,
1692.</P>
<P>"A rough sketch and orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE> about complaints and calumnies against the King's
servants." This order was probably obtained through the influence of the earl of
Melfort, who had become very disagreeable to many of James's friends in England.
There is a paper in his own hand, after he had retired from St. Germains, entiâˆ£tuled,
Memoire justificatif du comte de Melfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE> 17 <HI>Mai,</HI> 1694. This paper conâˆ£sists
of twenty-four pages. Melfort begins with observing that he had been in
great favour with Charles, and with James; and that neither the changing his
religion, nor his rising so high in office, had procured him any enemies, "before
the prince of Orange's arrival, which he had always foretold, without being
believed: but that he had drawn upon himself hatred, and many enemies, for
the following reasons, viz. for having advised the King to accept of the assistance
of France, to send the prince of Wales into a place of safety, and to seize the most
considerable of his enemies before the prince of Orange's arrival."</P>
<P>When the earl of Sunderland was dismissed, King James's business with the
court of France was committed to Melfort. He says he persuaded his master to
accept of the assistance of France; and having, by his orders, made the proposals
to Barillon, he received, for answer, that there were no troops now on the coast
of France, nor vessels to transport them. This gave great offence to the English,
particularly to the earl of Middleton, one of the secretaries of state. Melfort was
in danger of being assassinated; such were the prejudices of the people against the
French. He was obliged to retire to France, and had their Majesties orders to
meet the prince of Wales at Dieppe, where the prince would have landed, if he
had been sent, according to their Majesties orders, from Portsmouth. Upon
James's arrival at St. Germains, Melfort was made secretary of state for England;
and, against his will, was obliged to attend his Majesty to Ireland. He dreaded
<PB N="675" REF="701"/>
lord Tyrconnel's temper and pride. He claims great merit to himself, for having
saved that kingdom, by his invention of copper currency, and from his other serâˆ£vices
and fatigues. He left Ireland, and exposed himself to be suspected of having
been in disgrace with his master; until it was seen, that he was employed to exeâˆ£cute
a particular commission at Rome. But still he says, Sir Theophilus Ogleâˆ£thorp
and his lady, who is very intriguing and cunning, continued to do him ill
offices. They thought it impossible that he should pardon them; and therefore,
they retained their malice against him.</P>
<P>Melfort was recalled from Rome, where he acquitted himself to the satisfaction
of the French ministry, to act again as secretary of state. He carried on the correâˆ£spondence
with England. James's friends increased. The King of France was
induced to attempt an invasion, and communicated his intentions to Melfort
alone. James, from thenceforward, never called to his council five Roman Caâˆ£tholic
servants, with whom he used to consult while Melfort was at Rome. This
step, which Melfort opposed, in vain, created him many enemies.</P>
<P>While Melfort was absent, Montgomery, whose father and grandfather were
great enemies to the crown of Scotland, proposed to the King and to the Queen,
by his emissaries, and particularly by one Jones, to seize the government. The
papers, which concern this affair, were delivered up to the ministry, though Montâˆ£gomery
and Jones maintained the contrary; as Melfort had foretold from Rome,
from his knowledge of the men who were to conduct it. Montgomery, on acâˆ£count
of his hatred to the prince of Orange, having gained credit with two or
three of the King's friends, began again to make proposals to the King, and to
give him information of some men of quality who were in his interest. As these
men, in whose name Montgomery had advanced several things, were for the prince
of Orange and Whigs at bottom, the King had reason to distrust him, and ask an
explanation. Jones was sent over by Montgomery; and, when he arrived at St.
Germains, instead of shewing who these men of quality were, the King saw that
he had nothing to expect from Montgomery; and the correspondence was interâˆ£rupted
until Melfort returned from Rome, except some letters which Montgomery
wrote from time to time to Strafford, soliciting money. A person who was so atâˆ£tached
to the King, that he suffered the torture with great firmness, without makâˆ£ing
any discovery, was sent, in the mean time, by one of the King's loyal subjects
from Scotland, to inform him, that Montgomery had declared, at the table of the
marquis of Montrose, who is the King's great enemy, that he also would be his
enemy to his death.</P>
<P>The correspondence was interrupted. Jones, at the instance of the King's
friends in England, was thrown into the Bastile. AbbÃ© Renaudot complained,
that Melfort received few letters from England, and furnished him with no materials
for his Gazette. He went to see Jones in the Bastile, Jones promised to renew
<PB N="676" REF="702"/>
the correspondence, and, by Renaudot's means, was allowed to make his escape.
When he arrived in England, he blamed Melfort for his imprisonment.</P>
<P>Melfort, in the remaining part of this long memorial, enlarges upon the preâˆ£judice
done to him, by the misrepresentations of Montgomery and Jones in Engâˆ£land;
the intrigues of AbbÃ© Renaudot in France; his own difference of opinion
with the Marquis de Croiffy, about the terms of a letter, proposed to be written by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰"/> two houses of parliament; and with the earl of Middleton, about the

hand, and probably a part of one of the letters he wrote, during his embassy at
Rome. It is in the following terms: "I suppose you have heard of the great
doings here, with the <HI>principe Inglese,</HI> as they call him (Russel). Here he passes
for duke of Bedford. The cardinals and ambassadors themselves make court to
him. His defects are supplied by father Cosmo Clark, who is every thing to him,
except his divine; which office is supplied by a parson. But the father is interâˆ£preter,
maestro di camera, major domo; and I pray God he be not somewhat beâˆ£sides.
To speak freely, but with secrecy, there are great abuses in this matter;
this father pretending to every body, by way of secret, that he has a sort of comâˆ£mission
from the King to treat with the English nobility, who may come hither;
and says, that the King has, by Mr. Carryl, writ to this lord, and given him the
title of marquis of Tavistock. Whether all this be real or supposed, is not the
<PB N="677" REF="703"/>
question: that is not my business, &amp;c. But it seems very improper, that one who
has no better guard upon his tongue, should be trusted in affairs of consequence; one
whose glory and vanity would make him not only boast of what is, but invent what
is not: of the which I'll give you a considerable instance. At Torre de Specchi, very
lately, he gave himself out for a person of a great family, and related to the King.
(By the by, he is grandson to a taylor, and his father was a contemptible advoâˆ£cate.)
By this lie, he got a considerable present of Agnus Deis, finely wrought
and set into cases, from a nun of the house of Massimi. Mrs. White told me,
this enquiring into his birth being asked by the said nun if what he said was true.
His keeping company with Protestants does not pass, without giving great scandal:
and, if he has any such commission, as pretended, he makes no other use of it,
but to satisfy his worldly satisfactions and appetites; which his habit would not
allow him to do, without this pretext of the royal countenance, he says he hasâ–ª

<HEAD>VOL. IV. QUARTO.</HEAD>
<P>THIS volume consists almost entirely of original letters concerning the intrigues
of the courts of St. Germains and Barleduc, during the years 1712 and 1713.
It consists of 77 numbers; and almost every one of these numbers contains several
letters. But extracts have been made from them all, as they occurred in the orâˆ£der
of time; consequently there is no occasion to take any notice of them here.</P>

<HEAD>Lettres et Memoires du Cardinal Gualterio. 2 Vols. 4to.</HEAD>
<P>THESE two volumes contain Gualterio's correspondence and negociations
during the years 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1719. They are almost all in Itaâˆ£lian,
and consist of memorials to the Pope, letters to Nairne, and a few to the
Chevalier de St. George himself. The cardinal was the Chevalier's agent at Rome.
The subjects of his letters and memorials are the severity of the oaths of allegiance
on the English Roman Catholicksâ€”An application to the Pope for a dispensation
to take themâ€”Lord Peterborough's arrest at Bolognaâ€”Secret negociations about
<PB N="680" REF="706"/>
the Chevalier's marriageâ€”Negociations with the court of Spain, and an offer of
Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, providing that court placed the Chevalier on the British
throneâ€”Difficulties attending the Chevalier's marriage and place of abodeâ€”Coldâˆ£ness
of the court of Romeâ€”Various negociations and correspondences.</P>
<P>Gualterio's letters are mostly in cyphers, but the cant-names are easily explained.
Neither his letters nor his memorials are of much importance; and accordingly
few extracts have been made from them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="papers">
<HEAD>VOLUMES VII. VIII. and IX. QUARTO.</HEAD>
<P>THE first of these volumes is "a copy-book of the earl of Middleton's letters
begun at St. Germains, 19th April, 1693, to 28th March, 1695." The second
is, "Entrys of some letters of the earl of Middleton's, most of them writt
by M. from the 14th June, 1713, to the 13 Juillet, 1712, with some letters of
1700." And the third is, "Entries of some letters writt to England to Abram
and Berry, &amp;c. from 1709 to 1713; some by earl Middleton, and most by N."
(Nairne.)</P>
<P>These letters throw considerable light on the intrigues of the times, and every
thing has been extracted from them, that was any ways connected with the general
history, or with the private conduct and characters of individuals. They are
mostly allegorical and in cyphers, and are often without a key: but every thing
of importance in them hath been explained by a careful attention to trace the chain
of the correspondence, and an unwearied application in comparing them with one
another, and in discovering the views, connexions, &amp;c. of the several persons
concerned. Access to the letters, to which these volumes contain answers, would
have greatly abridged this labour, but perhaps have brought but few important
facts to light.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Thomas Carte was a great collector of anecdotes. From one
8vo. and three 4to. volumes of his memorandum-books, and a bundle of loose
papers, such of them have been inserted in the preceding volumes as were supâˆ£ported
by collateral evidence, and connected with the history of the period to
which Mr. Nairne's papers extend. But as many of the papers collected by him
in a large solio volume, marked A. L. were not comprehended within this period
it is necessary to give a more particular account of them. He himself made
some use of them to the year 1654, where his history ends. It will be sufficient
to give a list of those to which he has not referred, and a short account of their
contents, where they are of any importance.</P>

<P>â€”"The Queen hath not been in good humour of late, speaking with more
earnestness than heretofore, of her going to remain in the Carmelites<NOTE N="Â§" PLACE="foot">Sir John certainly meant the Carmelitesses.</NOTE>. The great
want she is in for want of money to sustain her houshold hath somewhat disposed
her M. thereunto. She hath been, this two last days, in debate about the reducâˆ£ing
and regulating her family, and hath not made any considerable alteration,
Though her Majesty expressed, in her last to his Majesty, her opinion for his goâˆ£ing
into Ireland; yet she is a little troubled to find his Majesty hath taken his
resolution to go thither before it came to him. Mr. Montague hath been heer this
four days, and returns to Pontoize to-morrow. He is very much with the Queen,
and I believe we shall be able to know what her Majesty intends, before she goes
into the <HI>Carmelites</HI> convent, which will be five days hence, to remain there for ten

<P><PB N="683" REF="709"/>
I sent, as soon as I came thither, my lord duke of Buckingham's commission
into Flanders, as judging it the safest conveyance. His Grace is expected here the
next week. I think I did not inform you, in my last, that my lord duke Hamilâˆ£ton
hath written to a consident friend of his heer, that, by no means, his Majesty
ought not to acknowledge the parliament of Scotland, but in a full conclusion with
them, in which case there can be little sayd for the contrary; only, I am still of
opinion, that Windram is not to have a refusal; but that his Majesty should send
his answer into Scotland, by deputies of his own, instructed as amply towards
their satisfaction as will stand with a good conscience, voyd of scruples, and
without doing any prejudice, either to his hopes of Montrose or to his present
possession in Ireland; and, since the Scots have, in a manner, appeared for the
crown Swedeland, methinks it should be of no ill consequence, that his deputies,
in case of disagreement in the treaty, should provoke them to a decision, by an
arbitration of that crown. But I am not ignorant how unlikely any such propoâˆ£sition
is to take effect, without the expedient you know of; without which I must
and do despayre of it. I shall endeavour it still to the utmost of my power. My

<P>Lord Colpepper to Mr. secretary Long. Anchuisen, January 11, 1650.<NOTE PLACE="marg">137.</NOTE></P>
<P>The following paragraph of this letter is in cyphers. "The Emperor of Russia
hath, you know, banished all English trade, and the merchants are making up
their packs as fast as they can. But before they go, I intend to demand of the
Emperor of Muscow the custom unpaid for the English goods, since they submitted
to the new authority in England; and if the Emperor will comply with the King's
desire in any thing, it will more probably be in this demand, which is so notoriâˆ£ously
grounded on his Majesty's right, and which will not cost the said Emperor
any thing out of his own purse. This shall not slacken my endeavours in the rest
(literally in my instructions) but shall only be a reserve.â€”The duke of Courland,
as his agent at Amsterdam told me, will lend his Majesty three good ships; the
least of twenty-five guns. They are now in these parts; but it ought to be conâˆ£cealed,
if accepted, until they shall be at sea, for many reasons. M. Wicford, at
the Hague, will negotiate any thing with the agent who had orders to comply
with the King's desire therein, that you shall intimate. He himself has a design
to send two or three good ships to the East Indies, with the King's commission,
and likewise with goods to trade, if his Majesty thinks fit; paying a good proâˆ£portion
of the value of the prizes to him. I only propounded for you to judge of
it as I do the raising of a very round sum, upon the islands of Scilly, upon a
treaty to be made with these States. Think well of this latter, and whether the
<PB N="684" REF="710"/>
King will be able to defend and relieve them this next summer. But, if he might
receive 50,000 <HI>l.</HI> and they be put into the States' hands, as caution only for the
money, whereby they should be defended by them, and possibly they thereby insenâˆ£sibly
engaged in the King's quarrel, it might be no ill bargain."</P>
<P>A copy of King Charles the Second's letter to lord Loudon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. L. folio, page 138.</NOTE> Jersey, January
13/22 1650.</P>
<P>The letter was sent by Mr. Wyndram. Charles appoints commissioners from
Scotland to meet him at Breda. Along with it was sent a letter to the clergy of
Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">139.</NOTE> Charles, in these letters, promised to submit to the conditions which
were proposed to him, and particularly to acknowledge the convention of estates,
then assembled in Scotland, to be a parliament. At the same time he wrote a letter
to the marquis of Montrose, assuring him, that he would make no concessions, inâˆ£consistent
with the powers he had given him in his commission; and declaring,
that, though he called them a committee of estates, he was determined not to acâˆ£knowledge
them to be legally so. This letter was intercepted, and was of infinite
prejudice to the King. Abram Cowley, on the 13th of March, writes about it to
secretary Long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">140.</NOTE> in the following terms: "No doubt it has done the King a great
deal of hurt; but it is very happy, that it has missed of the chief end, for which
I conceive it was published, which was to hinder the treaty. That danger is now
over; and the only doubt remaining is, whether the treaty will produce an agreeâˆ£ment;
and I dare say, all the world, besides a few of our nation, believe it so
great a madness not to agree, that they think it impossible to happen."</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"I am not certain, but there may be
some attempts to trim the settlement of Ireland; and some neate-handed barbers of
the law may contrive how it must be done, if they are back't with force. Yet I
should think there are but two ways; either by commission or by parliament. That
of commission has bin tried and laid aside: but it may be reassumed, and this
thought to be a more favourable conjuncture for it than 1670. To shake the
settlement by parliament requires more preparation; sheriffs to favour elections
must be named; and the house of lords must be filled with peers, that will concur.
In short, I know not what is designed, or by what means.</P>
<P>I believe you will shortly heare, that the earl of Macklesfield is prisoner in the
Tower, as well as his sonne. I am certain they both deserve it. Time will proâˆ£duce
what may prove fatal to them. I am, with reality, Sir,</P>

<P>Account from Edinburgh of the earl of Argyle's defeat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">277.</NOTE> June 18th, 1685.</P>
<P>It is an account of facts which are well known.</P>
<P>Extract of a letter from Sir John Percival,<NOTE PLACE="marg">229.</NOTE> July 14th, 1685.</P>
<P>He writes about the affairs of Ireland; the hardships of the act prohibiting the
Irish to trade directly to the plantations; and the consequences of the proclamaâˆ£tion
calling in the arms of the militia.</P>
<P>"This proclamation doth disquiet the minds of the militia, especially of the
common sort, who are all fearful, left endeavours should have been used to reâˆ£present
them to his Majesty, as persons disaffected to his service, and not fit to be
trusted with arms, though they are all English, and universally, in those parts,
Protestants of the church of England, and have all taken the oaths of allegiance
and supremacy, a little before King Charles the Second's death (such being then
turned out as refused); and the officers have all produced certificates of their havâˆ£ing
taken the sacrament, as required by the church of England, upon an order
from the government of this kingdom, about 12 months since. And many of the
Irish gentlemen of this country openly spread abroad reports, and tell the English
themselves, that their arms are thus called in to be given to them, as the King's
best subjects; and that, they say, is the meaning of the proclamation, in the exâˆ£pression
used therein, viz. that the captains are to keep the arms, for the use of
the militia, or such other uses as his Majesty may have for them. This serves to
disquiet the minds of the common people: but the officers, and all others of better
sense, are so well satisfied with his Majesty's gracious and royal opinion, declared
to the advantage of all the church of England principles, that no such idle fear
enters their thoughts; but they wholly rely upon, and acquiesce in, the assurances
given by his Majesty, whose word, they know, is sacred and inviolable.</P>

People's fears of troubles here are very great, especially if the rebel Monmouth
should have any success; which disturbance breeds a great deal of ill blood here
between the English and the Irish; the latter charging this rebellion on the whole
body of the English, and telling them, that now their turn is come, and that they
will make the English of this country good subjects: and the English, on such
occasions, justifying themselves, and telling them, that though this be a rebellion
in England, yet it is only by the worst of the King's subjects there; and that there
are none, but his subjects of England, that: appear in the King's service against
them; with abundance of other hot discourses of this kind that run about the
country; the Irish charging all the English universally, hardly three excepted in
all this country, as devoted to Monmouth, and not fit to be trusted by the King:
which language gives great offence and provocation to such of the English as hear
it, and administers greater occasion of jealousy between the Irish and them than
formerly; insomuch as each say they are afraid the others will cut their throats.
And some, more fearful or disaffected than others, speak of sermons being in many
places preached, by the friars of this country, upon the 5th, 6th, and 7th verses
of the ninth chapter of Ezekiel; and though I cannot find any such sermon any
where, by them preached, yet it serves to amuse and disquiet the ignorant sort of
people, and to prejudice the little trade that is going about the country; nobody
buying any thing of the countrymen: insomuch that I have not been able to reâˆ£ceive
the sixth part of my rent in money, and am fain to receive the rest in beef or
corn, or to go without it.â€”The most apprehensive of my friends, on this side
the water have been advising me, upon score of security, to cross the sea, and to
go live privately in England; and, though I see not so much cause to fear, or exâˆ£pectation
of disturbance, as they pretend to see, yet, because they desired me to
move it to you, I desire the favour, of your advice about it. It is upon the advice
of our friends, that we have thoughts of sending part of our stocke of children,
