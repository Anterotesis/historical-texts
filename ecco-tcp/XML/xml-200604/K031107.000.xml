<P>A DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT, IN TWO ACTS, TAKEN FROM THE MASQUE OF KING ARTHUR, BY DRYDEN. And now performed at The THEATRE-ROYAL in DRURY-LANE, With VARIETY of SCENES and MACHINERY.</P>
<P>The MUSIC by PURCEL, and Dr. ARNE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Names of <HI>Dryden</HI> and <HI>Purcel</HI> have made the following Performance hitherto re∣garded as one the best calculated to show the Effects of Poetry, Action, and Music. Yet the want of a Plot sufficiently interesting and va∣ried, has prevented it keeping its Rank on the Stage, as a first Piece. This it is hoped will excuse the present alteration, by which, the whole of the Story, with the most approved Parts of the Music and Machinery are compressed into two Acts, leaving the beautiful Scenes of Emmeline almost wholly untouched.</P>
