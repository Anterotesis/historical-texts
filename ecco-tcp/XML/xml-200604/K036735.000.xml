<P>BUT hear me, Merlin, I beseech you, hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear you! I have heard you—for years have heard your vows, your protestations—Have you not allur'd my affections by every female art? and when I thought that my unalterable passion was to be rewarded for its constancy—What have you done?—Why, like mere mortal woman, in the true spirit of frailty, have given up me and my pes—for what?—a boy, an ideot.</P>

<SPEAKER>Urg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ev'n this I can bear from Merlin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have injur'd me, and must bear more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll repair that injury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then send back you fav'rite Cymon to his disconsolate friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urg.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you imagine that such a poor ig∣norant object as Cymon is can have any charms for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignorance, no more than profligacy, is ex∣cluded from female favour; the success of rakes and fools, is a sufficient warning to us, could we be wise enough to take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urg.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me, Merlin; pity for Cymon's state of mind, and friendship for his father, have induced me to endeavour at his cure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>False, prevaricating Urganda! Love was your inducement. Have you not stolen the prince from his royal father, and detained him here by your power while a hundred knights are in search after him?—Does not every thing about you prove the consequence of your want of honour and faith to me? Were you not plac'd on this happy spot of Arcadia, to be the guardian of its peace and inno∣cence? and have not the Arcadians liv'd for ages the envy of less happy, because less virtuous people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Urg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me beseech you, Merlin, spare my shame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are they not at last, by your example, sunk from their state of happiness and tranquillity to that of care, vice, and folly! Their once happy lives are now imbitter'd with envy, passion, vanity, selfishness, and inconstancy;—and who are they to curse for this change? Urganda, the lost Urgande.</P>

<P>And poor reason may stay at home—me ex∣actly!—Ay, ay, we are all alike—but with this difference, madam—your passion is surely a strange one—you have stolen away this young man; who, bating his youth and figure, has not one single cir∣cumstance to create affection about him. He is half an idiot, madam, which is no great compliment to your wisdom, your beauty, or your power.</P>

<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT to be left and forsaken! and see the false fellow make the same vows to another, almost before my face! I can't bear it, and I won't!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye, Sister, I am as little inclin'd to bear these things as yourself; and if my swain had been faithless too, I should have been vex'd at it, to be sure; but how can you help your∣self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not thought of that; I only feel I can't bear it; and as to the <HI>won't,</HI> I must trust in a little mischief of my own to bring it about.—O, that I had the power of our enchantress yonder! I wou'd play the devil with them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet folks say, she has no power in love-matters; you know, notwithstanding her charms, and her spirits, she is in love with a fool, and has not wit enough to make him return it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that; if I could not make folks love me, I would make them miserable and that's the next pleasure to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, to do justice to to her who makes all this disturbance among you, she does not in the least encourage the Shepherds, and she can't help their falling in love with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so, nor can I help hating and detesting her, because they do fall in love with her.—Sylvia's good qualities cannot excuse her to me; my quarrel to her is, that all the young fellows fol∣low her, not because she does not follow the young fellows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but really now, sister, 'tis a little hard, that a girl, who has beauty to get lovers, or merit enough to keep 'em, should be hated for her good qualities. <STAGE>(Affectedly.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry come up, my insulting sister; because you think your shepherd constant, you have no feeling for the false-heartedness of mine.—But don't be too vain with your success; my Dorilas is made of the same stuff as your Damon; and I can't for the life of me see that you have any particular security for your fool, more than I had for mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are you so angry, my dear sister?—I am not Sylvia, and to oblige you, I will abuse her wherever I go, and whenever you please; I think she is a most provoking creature, and I wish she was out of the country with all my soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she ought to be. She has no business here with her good qualities. Nobody knows who she is, or whence she came.—She was left here with old Dorcas, but how, or by whom, or for what, except to make mischief among us, I know not—There is some mystery about her, and I'll find it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>But will your quarrelling with her bring back your sweetheart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>1st Shep.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that—when the heart is over-loaded, any vent is a relief to it; and that of the tongue is always the readiest and most na∣tural—So if you wont't help me to find her, you may stay where you will.</P>

Oh! fye for shame, lasses! young and handsome, and sighing after one fellow a-piece, when you should have a hundred in a drove, fol∣lowing you like—like—you shall have the simile another time.</P>

<P>No; prithee, Linco, give it us now.</P>

<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Lin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have it—or, what's better, I'll tell you what you are <HI>not</HI> like—you are not like our shepherdess Sylvia—she's so cold, and so coy, that she flies from her lovers, but is never without a score of them; you are always running after the fellows, and yet are always alone; a very great dif∣ference, let me tell you—frost and fire, that's all.</P>

<L>She'll sing, the <HI>Zodiac</HI> round, the same sweet song:</L>
<L>And should the husband join <HI>his</HI> music too,</L>
<L>Why then 'tis <HI>cat</HI> and <HI>dog</HI> the whole year thro'.</L>
<L>Ye sons of <HI>law</HI> and <HI>physic,</HI> for your ease,</L>
<L>Besure, this day, you never take your fees:</L>
<L>Can't you refuse?—then the disease grows strong,</L>
<L>You'll have two itching palms—Lord knows how long!</L>
<L>Writers of news, by this strange fate are bound,</L>
<L>They fib to day, and fib the whole year round.</L>
<L>You wits assembled here, both great and small,</L>
<L>Set not this night afloat—your critic gall;</L>
<L>If you should snarl, and not incline to laughter,</L>
<L>What sweet companions for a twelvemonth after!</L>
<L>You must he muzzled for this night at least;</L>
<L>Our author has a right this day to feast.</L>
<L>He has not touch'd one bit as yet.—Remember</L>
<L>'Tis a long <HI>fast</HI>—from now to next December.</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>holiday!</HI> you are <HI>our patrons</HI> now; <STAGE>(to the upper gallery,</STAGE></L>
<L>If you but grin, the critics wont <HI>bow, wow.</HI></L>
<L>As for the plot, wit, humour, language—I</L>
<L>Beg you such trisles kindly to pass by;</L>
<L>The most essential part, which something means,</L>
<L>As dresses, dances, sinkings, flyings, scenes!—</L>
<L>They'll make you stare! nay, there is such a thing</L>
<L>Will make you stare!—still more▪—for I must sing:</L>
<L>And should your taste, and ears, be over nice,</L>
<L>Alas; you'll spoil my finging in a trice.</L>
<L>If you should <HI>growl,</HI> my notes will alter soon,</L>
<L>I can't be <HI>in</HI>—if you are <HI>out</HI> of tune!</L>
<L>Permit my fears your favour to bespeak,</L>
<L>My part's a strong one, and <HI>poor I but weak.</HI><STAGE>(alluding to his late accident.</STAGE></L>
<L>If you but smile, I'm firm, if frown, I stumble—</L>
<L>Scarce well of <HI>one,</HI> spare me a <HI>second</HI> tumble.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by <HI>GEORGE KEATE,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.</STAGE>
<STAGE>(Enter peeping in at the stage-door.)</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IS the stage clear?—bless me!—I've such a dread!</L>
<L>It seems enchanted ground, where'er I tread! <STAGE>(Coming forward.</STAGE></L>
<L>What noise was that!—hush!—'twas a false alarm.—</L>
<L>I'm sure there's no one here will do me harm.</L>
<L>Amongst you can't be found a single knight,</L>
<L>Who would not do an injur'd damsel right.—</L>
<L>Well—heav'n be prais'd, I'm out of magic reach,</L>
<L>And have once more regain'd the pow'r of speech:</L>
<L>Aye, and I'll use it—for it must appear,</L>
<L>That my poor tongue is greatly in arrear.—</L>
<L>There's not a female here but shar'd my woe,</L>
<L>Ty'd down to YES, or still more hateful NO,</L>
<L>No is expressive—but I must confess,</L>
<L>If rightly question'd, I'd use only YES.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In MERLIN's walk this broken wand I found, <STAGE>(Shewing a broken wand.</STAGE></L>
<L>Which to <HI>two words</HI> my speaking organs bound.</L>
<L>Suppose upon the town I try his spell—</L>
<L>Ladies, don't stir—You use your tongues too well!—</L>
<L>How tranquil ev'ry place, when, by my skill,</L>
<L>FOLLY is mute, and even SLANDER still!</L>
<L>Old gossips speechless—<HI>bloods</HI> would breed no riot,</L>
<L>And all the tongues at JONATHAN's lie quiet!</L>
<L>Each <HI>grave profession</HI> must new bush the wig;</L>
<L>Nothing to say, 'twere needful they look big!</L>
<L>The <HI>reverend doctor</HI> might the change endure,</L>
<L>He would sit still, and have his <HI>sine cure!</HI></L>
<L>Nor could <HI>great folks</HI> much hardship undergo;</L>
<L>They do their business with an AYE or NO!—</L>
<L>But, come, I only jok'd—dismiss your fear;</L>
<L>Tho' I've the pow'r, I will not use it here.</L>
<L>I'll only keep my magic, as a guard,</L>
<L>To awe each critic, who attacks our bard.</L>
<L>I see some malecontents their singers biting,</L>
<L>Snarling, " The ancients never knew such writing—</L>
<L>" The drama's lost!—the managers exhaust us</L>
<L>" With <HI>opera's, monkies, mab</HI> and <HI>Dr. Faustus.</HI>"</L>
<L>Dread Sirs, a word!—the public taste is fickle;</L>
<L>All palates in their turn we strive to tickle;</L>
<L>Our cat'rers <HI>vary,</HI> and you'll own at least,</L>
<L>It is <HI>variety</HI> that makes the feast.</L>
<L>If this fair circle smile—and the <HI>gods</HI> thunder,</L>
<L>I with this wand will heep the critics under.</L>
