<HEAD>Mr. MAITLAND's
Account of
INOCULATING
THE
Small Pox Vindicated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am very Sensible of the Respect
that is due to the Profession, and
Character of the Author of the Let∣ter
against <HI>Inoculating the Small
Pox</HI>; but am no less sensible of the Obli∣gation
I lye under to vindicate my own Re∣putation,
which a violent Fit of Sickness
hath hitherto hinder'd me from doing. And
I can do it with the more Freedom, be∣cause
I am conscious to my self, that I be∣gan
this Practice in <HI>England</HI> with the same
View to the <HI>Publick Good,</HI> with which, I
hope, the Learned Author condemns it. I
must take the Liberty to say, that allowing
the Doctor's Abilities to be as great as pos∣sible
in his own Profession, he seems not
quite so well qualify'd to write upon this
Subject; because of the Narrowness of his
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Experience (as far as appears by his Letter)
and his partial Credulity, or Incredulity in
Matters of Fact, which he takes from others;
and lastly, because of strong Prejudices, which
impose upon his most excellent Understand∣ing;
and draw him into Reasonings, which
either are inconsequential, or conclude
strongly for the Practice of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> which
they are brought to overturn. All these, I
believe, will appear very plain to any Im∣partial
Reader, in the following <HI>Animad∣versions,</HI>
in which I will endeavour to be
as short as the Subject will allow.</P>
<P>The Letter pretends to be an Admonition
to Physicians not to meddle in this Practice
of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> 'till they are better ascer∣tain'd,
by Experience, of the Success of it:
At the same Time, it is a most warm Dis∣suasive,
not only to Physicians, but to all
Sorts of People, not to practise it at all;
and consequently, to deprive them of all
Possibility of coming by Experience. Would
it not found somewhat absurd, if any one
should say to a young Physician, Pray, Sir,
don't Practise 'till you have Experience? But
it is still more so in this Case, because in
a Practice that is entirely to be laid aside,
you can neither have the Benefit of your
own, nor other Peoples Experience.</P>
<P>As to Physicians meddling with this Pra∣ctice
of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> I can only say, it may
favour too much of Novelty to be bigotly
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
zealous for it; and too much of a Faculty-Interest
to be so violent against it. Physicians
cannot ingraft People against their own, or
their Parents Consent; and a Physician would
be out of his Duty, who should persuade them
to it contrary to their Inclinations: On the
other Hand, If a Person, from the Experience
of the Fatality of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in gene∣ral,
or in his own Family in particular,
should resolve to ingraft his Child, any
Physician, who should dissuade him from it,
might, in a great measure, be chargeable
with the fatal Consequences of the Neg∣lect
of a Method, which the Parent had pro∣pos'd,
as the only Moans to save his Child's
Life: And he would be still as much to
blame, if when the Parent had resolv'd to
ingraft his Child, he should refuse to attend
him. It is very common with Parents, not
only to leave their Children in Houses in∣fected
with the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> but to bring
them into the Room, where their Brethren
or Sisters lye ill of them; and a Parent who
does so, conveys the Infection to his Child
as deliberately, and according to the Doctor,
certainly more than he, who orders him to be
<HI>Inoculated.</HI> Would it not then be equally,
impertinent in the Physician to deny his
Attendance in either Case?</P>
<P>I must put the Doctor in Mind, that there
are very few of the most useful Discoveries
in Physick, that have not been strenuously
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
oppos'd by many of the Faculty upon their
first Appearance. There is extant a Decree
of the College of Physicians at <HI>Paris,</HI> a∣gainst
the Use of Antimonial Vomits: It
were easy to assign many Instances of the
like Nature.</P>
<P>As the Doctor is surpriz'd, <HI>that an Ex∣periment,
practis'd only by a few ignorant
Women, amongst an illiterate and unthinking
People, should on a Sudden, and upon a slen∣der
Experience, so far obtain in one of the
Politest Nations in the World, as to be receiv'd
into the Royal Palace.</HI> I hope he has not
forgot, that the Practice of Curing Inter∣mitting
Fevers by the BARK, was intro∣duc'd
of a Sudden, by a barbarous <HI>Indian,</HI>
if not into the Royal Family, into the Family
of a Viceroy; and thence transmitted to us.</P>
<P>Page 7.] The <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>English if
we speak of it as National, is the Product
of the richest Dyet,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ergo,</HI> to bring 'em
to a spare Dyet before they have the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> must be extremely dangerous and hurt∣ful.
This must be the Doctor's Conclusion:
mine, I own, would be the direct contradi∣ctory.
If the Inflammatory State of the Blood,
arising from the Richness of the Dyet, makes
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in <HI>England</HI> very mortal; That
Practice, which either takes the Advantage
of a contrary State of the Blood, or by a
Spare Dyet introduces it, must be benefi∣cial.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Page 8.] <HI>The finest, the most Volatile, and
indeed, Insensible Particles of the Animal
Juices, are the most penetrating, and conse∣quently
the most contagious.</HI> And for the
same Reason, the most <HI>noxious:</HI> Does it
follow therefore, To convey the Infection
by the grosser and sensible Parts, must be ex∣tremely
unfit and dangerous? I confess, I
should have inferr'd the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>The Symptoms are more or less, and the
Distemper appears in a greater, or a less
Degree, according to the State of the Blood
at the Time of Infection.</HI> Therefore the Pra∣ctice
of <HI>Inoculation</HI> is highly to be encou∣raged,
because it either finds, or puts the
Blood into a good State, before the Infe∣ction;
seems to be a more natural Conclu∣sion,
than the contrary One.</P>
<P>Page 10.] <HI>If we could be assur'd, that the
Distemper would not be equally uncertain by</HI>
Inoculation, <HI>according to the Nature of the
Injected Matter, or the Disposition of the
Fluids, in the Person who receives it; so
that it would constantly prove of the mild∣est
Kind,</HI> Inoculation <HI>would, no doubt, be
a very rational and useful Practice.</HI> The
Doctor surely will not affirm, that a Person
<HI>Inoculated</HI> is equally uncertain of the Cir∣cumstances
mention'd, with one who catch∣es
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by the common Way of
Infection. <HI>First,</HI> He may be assur'd, if the
<HI>Inoculation</HI> takes Place, of the Time when
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
he shall have the <HI>Small Pox. Secondly,</HI> That
he has not the Infection by the insensible
Particles, which the Doctor owns to be the
most contagious; or which is near the same
Thing, convey the Contagion the strongest,
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> He may be as sure, as his Operator
is careful, that he is infected by a favour∣able
Kind. And, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> He may be much
more sure of the Disposition of his Fluids,
than a Person who catches them by Chance,
after a Surfeit, or a Debauch: And after all
this, he may be assur'd, if he has not abso∣lute
Certainty, (which, I believe, one has
hardly in Blood-letting) that he has a much
greater Probability to escape, which is suffi∣cient
Ground for human Prudence to act
upon: If the Doctor will deny those Things,
I think it is Folly to reason upon this Sub∣ject
any longer: And if, as the Doctor says,
Inoculation <HI>may be a more uncertain Me∣thod
to give the Contagion, than that which
Nature has pursu'd</HI>; it may be, notwith∣standing
that, much more safe.</P>
<P>Page 11.] <HI>The very Choice that is made
of a thick purulent Matter, to intermix im∣mediately
with the Blood, seems a little re∣pugnant
to our Reason, since we know, that
the Particles have such a different Contex∣ture,
and such different Powers to Attract.</HI>
It may proceed from my Ignorance, or Dul∣ness,
but, I confess, I do not easily appre∣hend
the Meaning of this Sentence; Whe∣ther
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
by <HI>the Particles</HI> he means the Parti∣cles
of purulent Matter, or the Particles of
Blood; or whether the Particles of purulent
Matter have different attractive Powers, from
those of the Blood, is not obvious from the
Construction of the Sentence. I chuse ra∣ther
to understand him in the last Sense, be∣cause
he has afterwards very sagaciously dis∣cover'd,
<HI>That the blended Particles of Blood
with Blood, may, in all Reason, be thought
more likely to unite, and less liable to raise
Commotions.</HI> But it happens unluckily in the
Case of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> the Design is to <HI>raise a
Commotion</HI>; and the purulent Matter, for
the Reason mention'd by him, is fittest for
that Purpose; And his Observation, that <HI>pur∣ging
Medicines injected into the Blood will
Purge,</HI> does not prove, that the <HI>Pus</HI> of the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> mix'd with the Blood, may not
raise the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> What he says in this
Paragraph, as likewise in the following, con∣cerning
the Experiment of the <HI>Mangey Dog,</HI>
proves, that <HI>Pus</HI> is a more proper Vehicle
to convey Infection than Blood; I cannot
find any more in it.</P>
<P>Page 13.] <HI>It never came into the Heads</HI>
of the Practitioners above-mention'd <HI>to raise
Distempers by Art in a human Body.</HI> Then
I will be bold to say, it never came into
their Heads to practise Physick; which, con∣sider'd
in a true Light, is founded upon that
single Principle of Curing <HI>Natural,</HI> by rais∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<HI>Artificial Diseases.</HI> What is Bleeding,
but an artificial Haemorrhagy; Purging, but
raising an artificial Diarrhaea? Does the Vo∣miting
produc'd by a Surfeit, and that pro∣cur'd
by a Medicine differ so much, as that
the One must be call'd a Disease, and the O∣ther
not? Are not Blisters, Issues, and Setons,
artificial <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Imposthumations? I hope he has
not forgot the of his great Ma∣ster
<HI>Hippocrates.</HI> The Wounds and Ampu∣tations
of Surgeons, differ only from acci∣dental
Ones, by the Manner and Intention;
<HI>Morbus est ille corporis status qui functiones
Animales laedit:</HI> And it may be likewise
observ'd, that Physicians produce those Di∣seases
in their Patients often by Way of
Prevention as well as Cure; and in this
they do nothing but imitate Nature, which
often attempts the Cure of one Disease by
another.</P>
<P>Page 14.] His next Argument is taken
from <HI>the fatal Consequences of this very
Matter it self returning into the Blood, in
the very Height of the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>where
there seldom is a full and sufficient Discharge
by the Skin,</HI> &amp;c. One would imagine, that
the natural Inference from this, would be
to the Advantage of <HI>Inoculation</HI>; For if
there are terrible Symptoms, which arise
from Want of a sufficient Discharge of the
purulent Matter in the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; <HI>Inocu∣lation,</HI>
which provides for such a Discharge,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
by artificial Out-lets, must needs be useful;
and seems more proper than the Blisters,
which the Physicians apply on that Occa∣sion.
As to the <HI>fatal Consequences arising for
Want of a sufficient Discharge upon the Skin,</HI>
I am affraid the Case is quite different from
what the Doctor represents; for the more
Matter is discharg'd upon the Skin, the more
is often return'd into the Blood; witness the
<HI>confluent</HI> Kind of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> where the Dis∣charge
upon the Skin, as well as the Symp∣toms
arising from the Return of the Mat∣ter
into the Blood, are both the greatest:
And I believe it will be found, the less the
Discharge upon the Skin, the less will be
the Danger from these Symptoms. The Do∣ctor
says, <HI>That one may always observe in
this artificial Method (even where the Di∣stemper
is the fairest and most kindly) that
the Pustules scarce ever plump up to that
Degree, or contain so laudable a Matter, as
they do in the natural Sort.</HI> Here is an odd
Jumble of the Words <HI>always, scarce ever:</HI>
Suppose for <HI>scarce ever</HI> one put <HI>seldom,</HI> then
the Sentence runs thus; <HI>One may always
observe the Pustules seldom plump up,</HI> &amp;c.
What happens but seldom, happens some∣times;
and to observe <HI>always That</HI> not to
happen, which happens sometimes, is odd,
or oddly express'd. I would be glad to know
how many Cases the Doctor has observ'd,
to frame this so general a Proposition upon;
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
of the contrary of which, Hundreds of Per∣sons
about this Town, who know the Di∣sease
perfectly, have been Eye-Witnesses.</P>
<P>Page 16.] The Doctor foresees some Incon∣venience
that must happen, from those <HI>vis∣cid
Particles</HI> intermixing with the Blood,
without undergoing the common Alterations
of Aliment. But they have that in common
with the <HI>Volatile</HI> and most <HI>Insensible Parti∣cles.</HI>
But then they are <HI>viscid,</HI> and therefore,
(according to the Doctor's Reasoning) don't
convey the Infection so strong: But they <HI>oc∣casion
great Disorders</HI>; Not so great as the
<HI>Insensible</HI> and <HI>Volatile Particles.</HI> At last,
they <HI>break through the Glands of the Skin:</HI>
If only the small Quantity of purulent Mat∣ter,
that mixes with the Blood, break thro'
the Pores of the Skin, the Eruption, indeed,
would be very small; But to cause an Erup∣tion,
is the very Intention of the Operation;
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> cannot be produc'd without
it: And if the Doctor still insists, that it is
<HI>only like the</HI> Small Pox; all I can say is, If
he had been pleas'd to attend Multitudes of
Cases of <HI>Inoculated Persons,</HI> here and else∣where
in <HI>England,</HI> since this Practice began,
he must have been convinc'd, that the <HI>Erup∣tions,</HI>
produc'd by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> are the <HI>Ge∣nuine
Small Pox.</HI> If his Arguments so far
prevail, as to hinder any future <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
he must for ever continue in his Mistake; If
the Patient recovers, then it was only some∣thing
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
like the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; If any one dies,
then to be sure it was the <HI>Small Pox</HI> catch'd
by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> and of the worst Sort. In
this Paragraph it is no <HI>Small Pox</HI>; by and
by, it is a <HI>Small Pox</HI> so bad, that it is capa∣ble
of <HI>spreading the</HI> Small Pox through <HI>a
whole City; and an artificial Way of depo∣pulating
a whole Country.</HI> This Way of Ar∣guing
is a very plain Proof of the strong Pre∣judices
the Doctor lyes under; and that as he
has taken up his Opinion early, he is resolv'd
to defend it obstinately.</P>
<P>Page 20.] The <HI>Inoculators</HI> are charg'd with
<HI>Acting like Empirics,</HI> because <HI>they are not
ascertain'd of the different Doses for Chil∣dren
and Adults.</HI> There does not seem to
be any great Matter in this Nicety, by Ex∣perience,
as it stands hitherto; a small Quan∣tity
will communicate the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and
a greater has been found not to do hurt in a∣ny
one Instance. If the <HI>Inoculation</HI> is per∣form'd
by Incision, the different Apertures
will answer that Intention: However, there
is a great Difference between recommending
Caution, and forbidding the Practice: It is
still more strange to forbid the Practice, 'till
that is determin'd, which can only be found
out by Practice. According to this Princi∣ple,
it had been impossible ever to have
found out any Thing in Medicine; for he
that gave the first Dose of a Vomiting, or
Purging Medicine, or of any other, could
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
never be sure of the proper Dose; nay far∣ther,
according to this Doctrine, it is impos∣sible
to give any Body their first Dose of any
Medicine: For who can tell what is the pro∣per
Dose for any particular Person, there be∣ing
often Singularities in every one's Consti∣tution:
In all these Matters, Mankind ge∣nerally
govern themselves by common Sense,
and strong Probabilities; there being no ab∣solute
Certainty in any human Affairs.</P>
<P>Page 25.] The Doctor returns to his for∣mer
Point, that it is <HI>not the Genuine</HI> Small
Pox, <HI>and consequently no Security against that
Disease.</HI> The Matters of Fact I will answer
by themselves; all I shall say at present is,
that if the Symptoms of the Ingrafted <HI>Small
Pox</HI> are more mild, than those of the natu∣ral
Sort, I hope the Doctor will not bring
that as an Objection against the Practice. I
believe the Patient, in this Case, has just as
great Certainty for not having the <HI>Small Pox</HI>
again, as any other Person who has had them;
<HI>which is no absolute one.</HI> Those who are In∣fected
by any Method, I believe, are much
in the same Condition, as to their Security
from the Disease for the future; for which,
I will give the Doctor this one plain Proof,
which is sufficient to establish a moral Cer∣tainty.
This Practice of <HI>Inoculation</HI> has been
continu'd for many Years in several Countries;
if the <HI>Inoculated</HI> had been subject to catch
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> a second Time, something
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
of this Kind must have happen'd; and a very
few Instances of this, must have put an End
to the whole Practice: For can any one ima∣gine,
that People in their Senses would have
continu'd a troublesome Experiment, which
was not effectual for the Purpose for which
it was design'd? I will take the Freedom to
say, that this single Reflection is a stronger
Proof of this Point, than all the Doctor's
Doubts and Suggestions, who knows nothing
to the contrary; as I shall shew by and
by. May it not at least be adviseable to al∣low
a Truce in the Dispute, 'till an uncon∣tested
Case of that Kind happens?</P>
<P>Page 28.] But, Innoculation <HI>does not al∣ways
take Place and produce the Disease:</HI>
is Therefore the Practice to be left off? There
are some Persons, who by a Speciality of
their Constitutions, seem hardly susceptible
of the Distemper; and others, who have had
the Disease, but it has been mistaken, or
forgot. They go farther in <HI>Turky,</HI> and af∣firm,
that the very running Sores are a Secu∣rity
against the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> There may be,
indeed, a strong Presumption, that Persons,
who have had so severe a Tryal as <HI>Inocula∣tion,</HI>
may not be susceptible of the Distemper.
Besides, there are several Incidents in perform∣ing
the Operation, which may not be carefully
attended to; if the Patient has not the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> there is little Hurt done. There
are some, whom a very strong Dose of Phy∣sick
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
will not purge: What then? must we
never afterwards give a Purge?</P>
<P>If the Doctor's Aphorism, laid down, <HI>Page</HI>
36, That an <HI>Experiment, to make it useful,
always must be nearly uniform</HI>; there must
be no such Thing as the Practice of Physick;
unless by the Word <HI>nearly</HI> he allows a very
great Latitude.</P>
<P>I cannot allow it as a solid Argument a∣gainst
<HI>Inoculation,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Ita∣lians</HI>
have not begun it; no more, than that
the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI> has never been <HI>Ino∣culated.</HI>
Were the Doctor's Letter publish'd
in <HI>Italian</HI> too, as it is in very elegant <HI>French,</HI>
both Nations, to be sure, will be sufficiently
frighten'd from ever attempting this Practice:
And to make the Antidote still more univer∣sal,
let us have it in <HI>Sclavonic</HI> and <HI>High-Dutch,</HI>
<HI>Welsh</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> also.</P>
<P>What the Doctor says, <HI>Page</HI> 44, of <HI>the
Attention that is to be given to the na∣tural
Weaknesses of the Constitutions of the
Persons</HI> Inoculated, is a very proper Cau∣tion;
and perhaps Miscarriages, if any such
there be, may be owing to the Neglect of
it. But, as I hinted before, if the least ill
Success, even in the most innocent Branch∣es
of the Practice of Physick, arising from
Want of Care, or Skill, should be a per∣petual
<HI>Bar</HI> to the Repitition of them, Peo∣ple
must leave off to Purge, Vomit, Bleed,
or even to cut Corns, of which Operation
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
several die in a Year within the Bills of
Mortality.</P>
<P>Page 45.] But it is <HI>possible, and even pro∣bable,
the Matter of the</HI> Small Pox <HI>may
communicate the Diseases of the People
from which it is taken.</HI> This is hard! The
Doctor will scarcely allow, that the Matter of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> will communicate the <HI>Small
Pox</HI>; but it is <HI>probable,</HI> that it will commu∣nicate
any other <HI>Disease. Que vive</HI> Thomas
Diaphoinus, <HI>il n'a Jamais ete vaincu en dis∣pute!</HI>
How are we sure, that the Aliment,
or Drugs, both for External and Internal U∣ses,
don't communicate the Diseases; nay,
the very natural Qualities of those Animals
from which they are taken? I think, indeed,
the Election of wholsome Subjects to <HI>Ino∣culate
from,</HI> is a proper Caution; but the
Doctor demands absolute Certainty, which
cannot be found in any human Affair, and
less still in any Medical or Chyrurgical Pra∣ctice.
Mankind in all those Matters govern
themselves by the strongest Probabilities; and
that these are on the Side of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> I
shall plainly demonstrate.</P>
<P>Page 51.] The Doctor's Argument from
the <HI>jarring Opinions</HI> of the <HI>Innoculators</HI>; if
all he says were true, is just as strong against
the Practice of Physick in General: For if
no Body was to take any Medicine 'till <HI>Do∣ctors
cease to differ,</HI> I believe the Faculty
would starve: May we not with more Truth
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
affirm, that the <HI>Anti-inoculators</HI> (a Word
more sonorous, and longer by two Syllables
than that of <HI>Inoculators</HI>) are as inconsistent
and changeable in their Opinions? One
while they asserted, that it was impossible to
give the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by this Method; when
Experience had convinc'd them, some of 'em
at least, of the Untenableness of this Do∣ctrine;
then they allow'd, if it prov'd mor∣tal,
that it was the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; if they esca∣ped,
to be sure they would have them again;
If it was a favourable Sort, then there was
some inveterate Distemper transplanted with
it; If any Boils or Imposthumations appear'd
at the going off of the <HI>Disease,</HI> those were
the Effect of the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> not the Con∣sequence
of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in General, or
of the Constitution of the Patient. These
are certainly, not the Reasonings of inge∣nious
and inquisitive Philosophers, but the
Cavils of interested Disputants; and it would
be ridiculous, for any Man to be determin'd
by the jarring Opinions, either of the one
Side or t'other.</P>
<P>There is nothing material in the Way of
Argumentation, 'till we come to <HI>Page</HI> 62.
There this <HI>Practice</HI> is condemn'd, as it tends
to propagate and continue an Infection in
any Place: Here again it is the <HI>Small Pox</HI>;
else why should it spread the <HI>Small Pox?</HI>
I answer, if it be true, that the Generality
of Mankind have the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; if they
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
are rare in some Years, they must be rise in
others; because a new Stock of Subjects
susceptible of the Distemper is produc'd; and
the Operation of this Distemper upon the
Mass of Mankind in any particular Place, is
nearly uniform. When this general Run of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> happens; I take it to be indif∣ferent
to the Mass of the Inhabitants of any
Place in general, except in this one particu∣lar,
that when the Disease is produc'd by a
bad Constitution of Air, as it is most Epide∣mical,
so it is then most mortal. Now if
this Distemper should happen to be propaga∣ted
by an artificial Method in a favourable
Season, would not this be rather an Advan∣tage
to Mankind than otherwise? For exam∣ple,
The Doctor alledgeth that hardly one
of a hundred hath dy'd of the natural Sort
this Year; would it not then have been
highly profitable to Mankind, that a general
Run of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> had happen'd in so fa∣vourable
a Season; and this would still ope∣rate
more strongly for the Benefit of Man∣kind,
if not only the Season, but the Method
of Propagation had ten to one of odds of
producing a mild Sort. So that this Argu∣ment
of the Doctor's has the Misfortune,
with a great many of the rest, to prove the
Contradictory of his Conclusion: But with∣out
taking the Advantage of the Doctor's
hardy Assertion, that hardly one of a hun∣dred
have dy'd this Year of the <HI>Small Pox:</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
I will examine it a little by Numbers. I
have not all the Bills of Mortality by me,
but by a small Specimen, the Accompt
stands thus:</P>

<P>By which it appears that the single Branch of
Mortality occasion'd by the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is
some Years 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in a Circle of twelve
Years about 1/12 of the whole Mortality in ge∣neral;
For 21,788 is near 1/12 of 274,615.
During this Term of Years, <HI>London</HI> wanted
an Addition of near 22000 People yearly to
keep it equally full. If all Mankind had the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> then 22000 People, one Year
with another had it; of which 1/12 dy'd; If
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
one half of Mankind had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
then 1 out of 6, who had the <HI>Distemper,</HI>
dy'd of it. Which, by the way, shows the
Doctor to be out in his Calculation; for if
only 1000 die this Year, as perhaps may ap∣pear
by the Bills, 100,000 must have been
sick of the <HI>Distemper,</HI> to make his Assertion
true, <HI>that one only of a hundred dy'd:</HI> If he
means it only of Children, it is a strong Argu∣ment
for <HI>Inoculation,</HI> because it allows that
to be a favourable Age.</P>
<P>By the Bills of Mortality of <HI>Breslaw</HI> it ap∣pears,
that the Mass of Mankind lose above
25 <HI>per Cent,</HI> before they are a Year old; that
is, of a 100 that are born, more than 25 die
that first Year: I may say with great Proba∣bility
that not 1/9 of those have the <HI>Small Pox</HI>
at all; but die of other <HI>Diseases</HI>; and that
in the Account, as it stands before us 8 of 9
of Infants may be reckon'd neither Subjects
of the <HI>Distemper,</HI> nor of this Practice, but
as it were <HI>non-Entities.</HI> Therefore out of
the 22000 People, the yearly Recruits of
<HI>London</HI> abovemention'd, substracting 4000,
there remains 18000, of which yearly there
died above 1800 of the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; that is,
1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: So that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> may be reckon'd
to cut off 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Mankind above the Age of
one Year. I wish the World is not malicious
enough to say, that Physicians (like the
Clergy) are now strugling for their Tenths.
But to proceed, If, as I said, all Mankind a∣bove
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
a Year old have the <HI>Distemper,</HI> I out
of 10 dies of it; If one half, then 1 out of 5,
which have the <HI>Distemper</HI> the natural way,
dies of it: If ¼ of Mankind have the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> once in their Life, then of them 2 out
of 15 die: If 5/6, then 3 out of 25, which have
the <HI>Distemper,</HI> die of it. According to D. <HI>Net∣tleton</HI>'s
Calculation; out of 1245 who had
the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> in some Neighbour∣ing
Towns in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> there died 270, which
is about 22 out of a hundred. As to the pru∣dential
Part of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> it is all one whe∣ther
a greater or lesser Number have the <HI>Small
Pox</HI>; for the Chance of not dying by the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> the natural Way, is made up of
the Chance of escaping the <HI>Distemper,</HI> and
that of escaping in the <HI>Distemper.</HI> If ½ of Man∣kind
have the <HI>Distemper,</HI> it is ½ of ⅕ or 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/4 of Mankind have the <HI>Distemper,</HI> then it
is ¾ × <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or 6/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Still all Mankind
must be consider'd with the Seeds of a Dis∣temper
within them which has the Chance
of 1 to 9 to cut them, off. Then surely they
don't merit such hard Names, of <HI>Homicides
and Spreaders of Infection,</HI> who do but at∣tempt
to lessen the Dread and Danger of this
terrible Pestilence.</P>
<P>By the Accounts of the <HI>Inoculation in Eng∣land</HI>
and the <HI>Plantations,</HI> tho' it is an early
Practice, and has not been manag'd with due
Care and Circumspection; out of about 500
on whom it has been perform'd, the Enemies
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
of the Practice have not produc'd the Names
of above 3 Persons that have died; allowing
their Deaths chargeable on this Practice,
which I believe is not in Fact true: A Pra∣ctice
which brings the Mortality of the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> from one in ten to one in a hundred, if
it obtain'd universally would save to the Ci∣ty
of <HI>London</HI> at least 1500 People yearly;
and the same Odds wou'd be a sufficient pru∣dential
Motive to any private Person to pro∣ceed
upon, abstracting from the more occult
and abstruse Causes which seem to favour
this Operation. It is a self evident Proposi∣tion,
that a Person who receives the Infe∣ction
by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> has a much fairer
Chance for his Life, than he who takes it
the natural Way; unless it can be affirmed,
that the having the Election of all the Cir∣comstances
of the Disease, is of no manner
of Advantage. For Example, it must be of
some Benefit, to know that one is to have
the Distemper nine or ten Dayes before it
comes; rather than to be surpris'd, or per∣haps
mistaken in it. To have it at an Age
when it is not so mortal: To take it when
the Body is in a temperate and cool State, ra∣ther
than in a contrary one: When the Con∣stitution
of the Air is favourable, rather than
malignant: After a cool Dyet and other due
Preparations, rather than after a Surfeit or a
drunken Bout. For if the principal Strokes
towards the Cure, are in the Regimen, in the
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
Beginning of a Distemper; it must be still
more so, in a Regimen before it begins. If
the Doctor will deny these Truths, I have
done. But if the having all the Circumstan∣ces
abovemention'd in one's Power be of
some Advantage, then the <HI>Practice of Ino∣culation</HI>
cannot be hurtfull but beneficial to
Mankind in general: Then why must an Ex∣periment
already practis'd with Success in an∣other
Country, that bids fair to save the
Lives of Multitudes, be entirely laid aside
and crush'd in the Bud? Cannot the learned
Physicians, who so zealously oppose it, have
a little Patience, and Time will clear up ma∣ny
Things in it, which perhaps may be now
doubtful? Therefore since this Practice can∣not
be hurtful but beneficial to Mankind in
general, it ought not to be discouraged.</P>
<P>As to the Inconsistencies and Mistakes, the
Doctor is pleas'd to charge me withall: I shall
always be so ingenuous as to own such, as
my Inadvertency or Want of Experience
have subjected me to. What I wrote was ac∣cording
to the best Information or Expe∣rience
I had at that Time. General Propo∣sitions,
in practical Matters, are not to be
understood in the Strictness of a Logical U∣niversality.
The Symptoms from which I
exempted the Inoculated <HI>Small Pox,</HI> are to
be understood in a Comparative Sense, with
regard to those of the natural Sort; the
Word <HI>usual</HI> will justify this Meaning, in
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
which any Reader, not quite Captious, will
interpret them. If with all these Restrictions
I cannot be favourably understood, I beg Par∣don;
and as I said before, I shall be always
willing to recant any Mistake. But as on the
one hand, I study to keep myself free from
Prejudices, so as to be susceptible of any fu∣ture
Conviction, which may arise from <HI>Ex∣perience</HI>;
so I wou'd not submit a Point al∣ready
establish'd, to the silly Cavils of those
who have none.</P>
<P>I am sure, I am not mistaken in the
Account of the <HI>Inoculation</HI> at <HI>Newgate</HI>;
but the Doctor is. I referr the Reader
to my printed <HI>Journal</HI>; whereby it ap∣pears,
that the Operation was fairly and
equally perform'd on all: And I can with
great Truth, declare, that I had no Intention
to make any Difference in the Incisions; nor
was there, indeed, any made. The Doctor
not having seen <HI>Evans,</HI> the Man who had
had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before, till next Day, when
they were partly heal'd, this might occa∣sion
his Mistake. Nor was the Matter taken
from a violent Flux-kind, but from a full
distinct Coherent kind, and at the proper
Time. Mrs. <HI>Tompions</HI> Boil (as he call's it)
on her Arm; was not the same from the first
Day of the Eruption; nor the only one she
had: But was a fair, regular Pustule of the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> of which also she had others, if
he had been pleas'd to examine. <HI>Alcock,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
who had the <HI>Goal-Distemper,</HI> had also 60
Pustules, at least, of the <HI>Genuine Small Pox</HI>;
with a gentle Fever before the Eruption.
As to all of them, having had but few Erup∣tions;
I hope, that is no Objection against
the Practice. And as to the Time and Man∣ner
of their Pustules going off; they were
much the same, as in the gentler Sort of
<HI>Small Pox:</HI> Only that <HI>Alcock</HI> opening his
with a Pin, made them fall off sooner. The
Doctor might have taken Notice, that <HI>Eliz.
Harrison,</HI> who had them as gently, at least,
as any of them; has been employ'd since in
Nursing above 20 People in the <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
and never has catch'd them: Which any im∣partial
Person will judge to be a better Proof
of the Genuinness of the Distemper, than all
his Observations can evince to the contrary.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n</HI>'s Case, it is true. But
the Inference is only, that there was one Per∣son,
on whom the <HI>Inoculation</HI> did not take
place. I hope the Doctor has not forgot that
he own'd to me that Mr. <HI>Colt</HI>'s Children had
the true <HI>Small Pox</HI>; tho' their Case differ'd
in nothing from those in <HI>Newgate</HI>; but in
the Degrees of the Distemper.</P>
<P>As to the Experiment in St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s <HI>Hos∣pital,</HI>
after two vastly large Incisions, and
an immoderate Quantity of the Matter ap∣play'd;
three Days and Nights Confinement
of the Patient to his Bed, without opening
his Bandage, a warm Regimen, in a hot Sea∣son;
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
I visited him, (to know the Truth of
the Noise that was made) on the sixth Day
after the Operation, and saw no Eruptions,
nor had he any; nor were his Incisions di∣gested:
I took the Freedom to ask Doctor
<HI>Wadsworth</HI> then present, whether the Sores
(pointing at them) were like those he saw
at <HI>Newgate?</HI> And he fairly own'd, he cou'd
not say they were. I again saw this Patient
a Week after, but still no Eruption; If any
Eruptions happen'd between these Times,
they could not be the <HI>Small Pox:</HI> And I be∣lieve,
none who saw and attended both Ex∣periments,
can truly say, they were like those
in <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>I own that it seem'd probable that the six
Persons in Mr. <HI>Batt</HI>'s Family might have
catch'd the <HI>Small Pox</HI> of the Girl that was
<HI>Inoculated</HI>; but it is well known that the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> were rife not only at <HI>Hertford,</HI>
but in several Villages round it, many
Months before any Person was <HI>Inoculated</HI>
there: Witness Mr. <HI>Dobb</HI>'s House in <HI>Christ's
Hospital</HI> Buildings, where he himself died
of the worst Sort with Purples; and his
Children had it. Some other Families there,
and particularly Mrs. <HI>Moss</HI>'s, where the a∣bove-named
<HI>Elizabeth Harrison, Inoculated</HI>
in <HI>Newgate,</HI> attended several Persons under
it, to prove whether she would catch the Di∣stemper
by Infection; Both <HI>Latin Boarding-Schools</HI>;
Mr. <HI>Stout</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Loyd</HI>'s Fami∣lies;
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
Mr. <HI>John Dimsdale</HI>'s Coachman and
his Wise; and Mr. <HI>Santoon</HI>'s Maid-Servant,
who was brought to the same House, and
died of the Confluent kind of the <HI>Small Pox</HI>;
I took Matter from the said Coachman to
<HI>Inoculate</HI> Mr. <HI>Batt</HI>'s Daughter in the Coun∣try
Farm House, the <HI>first</HI> Ingrafted in that
Country. After this I took Matter also from
Mr. <HI>Stout</HI>'s Maid-Servant to <HI>Inoculate</HI> Mrs
<HI>Heath</HI>'s two Sons; which were all I <HI>Inocu∣lated</HI>
in that Town. Besides all these there
were a great many more, whose Names I
cannot at present call to mind both in Town
and Country about it, who had the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> and several died of it, the Summer be∣fore
I began this Practice: These are Mat∣ters
of Fact, which the Doctor's Author can∣not
disprove. To charge then the Spreading
the <HI>Infection</HI> and the Consequences of it,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Town, upon two single Boys who
were <HI>Inoculated</HI> in a Court in a manner se∣parated
from all the rest of the Town, which
was fuller of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before than after
the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> is not agreeable to that In∣genuity
which the Doctor seems to demand
of his Adversaries.</P>
<P>The Case of Mr. <HI>De Grave</HI>'s Daughter
which fills up three or four Pages in the Let∣ter,
and upon which the Doctor lays the
Foundation of his <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> the Reader may
please to take from her Father's own Words
in his Letter annex'd. From which it ap∣pears
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
that the Girl had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> but
once, of the favourable kind; and in all
Probability by <HI>Inoculation.</HI> So far the Case
is singular, that it did not take place till ele∣ven
Weeks after the Operation; and untill
the Blood was put into a Ferment by violent
Motion. Here the Doctor triumphs in his
<HI>Dilemma, Either she had, or she had not the</HI>
Small Pox <HI>by Inoculation</HI>; If the first, then it
is plain <HI>Inoculation</HI> is no <HI>preventive</HI> of the
<HI>Disease</HI>; If the second, the <HI>Experiment</HI> is
good for nothing. I think in this way of Ar∣gumentation,
to make it conclusive, there
ought to be a perfect <HI>Enumeration</HI>; but here
is a <HI>Third</HI> Case, and the real one, not enu∣merated;
which is, that the Girl had the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> and that but once, by <HI>Inocula∣tion</HI>;
tho' not at the same Time when the
Doctor lays the Scene of his <HI>Dilemma.</HI> But
to consider the Second Branch; allowing
that this <HI>Small Pox</HI> was the natural Sort,
and not produc'd by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> of which,
I think, the contrary is plain; sure it is a
strange Inserence to say, that because <HI>Inocu∣lation</HI>
has not taken Effect in one Subject, it
is therefore good for nothing. The Do∣ctor's
excellent Judgment will instruct him
to reason with more Temper and Solidity in
other Matters of his Profession; and not
make Use of his <HI>Aphorism, That one In∣stance</HI>
is as good as a thousand in Matters of
Experience. What the Doctor says of his
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
Fears of a great Class of Hypothetical Di∣seases,
is all vanish'd, and the Girl is very
well. I refer the Doctor upon this Head
of the Preventive Power of <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
to the Letter which he lays so much Stress
upon, from <HI>Boston</HI>; where his Ally in
this Dispute owns, <HI>That not one of the</HI> Ino∣culated
(being about three Hundred) <HI>during
the Space of five or six Months,</HI> in a general
Run of the <HI>Small Pox, has had the</HI> Small
Pox <HI>the natural Way, as far as we know:</HI>
But of this more afterwards.</P>
<P>As for his second Story of Captain <HI>Hus∣sart,</HI>
it requires only a bare Reading to make
it ridiculous; For no unprejudic'd Person of
common Sense can believe that one, after ha∣ving
been <HI>Inoculated</HI> twice without any Ef∣fect,
would try it a third Time: But after a
third Time, to try it a fourth, fifth, and sixth
Time, passeth all Degrees of Credibility. But
it seems this Captain was not very certain,
whether it was five or six Times; one <HI>Inocu∣lation</HI>
had quite slipt out of his Memory: he
wanted one Quality, which the Proverb de∣mands
in some Sort of People. Since the Doc∣tor
can give Credit to this Story of Captain
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and at the same Time question the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what is said by eminent Physicians,
who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from their own and other Peoples
Observations on the Spot, where <HI>Inoculation</HI>
is practis'd daily; I appeal to my Readers, if
I may not with Justice tax him of being par∣tially
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
<HI>Credulous</HI> or <HI>Incredulous,</HI> as Facts make
for or against his Purpose. And with all due
Respect to the Senate of <HI>Boston,</HI> I question
whether a Bill, or an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> founded up∣on
such a Fact, is more extraordinary. But al∣lowing
it to be true, what is the Inference?
That a Person, who could not catch the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> had them the natural
Way: If that were granted, will it prove, that
one who has the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
may afterwards have them the natural Way?
If upon the same Authority, the Doctor can
believe the Story of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Dragoon,
or the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Soldiers in the <HI>French</HI> Ar∣my;
I wish him much Joy. I promise him
I will not (like the Gentry who went in quest
of St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s Trough) ride twenty Miles to
be able to disprove it. I should be glad to
know, which Way the Doctor supports so
bold an Assertion, <HI>That</HI> [Page 17] <HI>by the Ac∣count
Dr.</HI> Nettleton <HI>gives, as also by the best
Observation upon those who have been</HI> Inocu∣lated
<HI>in this City, scarcely a fourth Part of
them have had a true and genuine</HI> Small Pox;
I have read over carefully Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI>'s Ac∣count,
contain'd in his Letters printed in the
<HI>Transactions</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 370;
and for my Life I cannot find any Thing to
justify this Assertion; on the contrary he says,
<HI>We have not yet found, that ever any had the
Distemper twice, neither is there any Reason
to suppose it possible; there being no Difference</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="33"/><HI>that can be observ'd betwixt the natural and
artificial Sort, (if we may be allow'd to call
them so) but only that in the latter the Pu∣stules
are commonly fewer in Number; and all
the rest of the Symptoms are in the same Pro∣portion
more favourable.</HI> I hope there is at
least as much Credit due to an ingenious Pra∣ctitioner,
who writes from a very extended
Experience, as to one who writes for the
most Part by Hearsay.</P>
<P>As to those who have been <HI>Inoculated</HI> in
<HI>London</HI>; to oppose my own, and other Per∣sons
Testimony from ocular Inspection, against
his, who talks by Report, may seem perhaps
too great Presumption. I therefore challenge
the Doctor to name the Cases and Authori∣ties
whereby he supports such a wild Asser∣tion.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r</HI>'s Case, I will not pre∣occupy
my Reader with any Reflection; but
refer him to the Matter of Fact here subjoin'd,
as it is testify'd by the Surgeon and Apothe∣caries
that attended him.</P>
<P>As to the Case of Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ts</HI>'s Servant,
I refer to the Account subjoin'd.</P>
<P>He is just as much misinform'd of the Case
of Lord <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI>'s Son, who had a favourable
Sort of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and was in no Danger
of his Life; as the Physician who attended
him will readily own.</P>
<P>As to the unfortunate Accidents which
have happen'd to some of the First Rank by
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
this <HI>Ingrafting Method</HI>; if I guess right who
he means, one of them is perfectly well with∣out
any unfortunate Accident; and the Im∣posthumation,
which had no Dependance nor
Communication with the Incision, is per∣fectly
cur'd without any Exfoliation of the
Bone, or any <HI>Hectic Fever.</HI> But it is hard to
charge the common Accidents of the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> in general, upon this Method in par∣ticular.</P>
<P>It is no less a Misinformation, that the
Children of a Nobleman, understood in his
Letter, were <HI>Ingrafted</HI> from a bad Sort of
<HI>Small Pox.</HI> As to what he says of the poorer
Sort of <HI>People of</HI> Scotland, <HI>running about
with the</HI> Small Pox <HI>upon them, without ei∣ther
Shoes or Stockings</HI>; the Doctor seems
here to intend a Reflection, but I choose to
avoid all Reflections, either National or Do∣mestick.
I believe the People of <HI>England,</HI> as
well as those of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the most Part,
neither wear <HI>Shoes</HI> nor <HI>Stockings</HI> in the <HI>Small
Pox:</HI> As to their Custom or Ability of <HI>run∣ning
about,</HI> they are much in the same Con∣dition,
as they are here; some have them fa∣vourably,
some otherwise, and every one has
Conveniencies and Helps according to their
Circumstances.</P>
<P>As for the three Letters from <HI>Boston</HI> in
<HI>New England,</HI> printed by Way of <HI>Appendix</HI>
to the Doctor's, It might suffice to say, that
they are only a severe, and perhaps a just In∣vective,
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
against the Clergy and others, for
meddling in this Branch of the Physicians
Practice: Upon which Encroachment, some
of the Faculty invoke the Vengeance of the
Civil Magistrate; and threaten the Offen∣ders,
as <HI>Poisoners</HI> and <HI>Spreaders of Infection,</HI>
with Prisons and Gibbet's: And if the Laws
in being are somewhat deficient, modestly
call, as some others have done, upon the Le∣gislature
for new Ones. This general Consi∣deration
is sufficient to invalidate the Credit
of any Thing that is said by a Person so strong∣ly
interested: But so great is the Force of
Truth, that it has extorted enough from this
partial Complainant to justify the Practice,
which he so bitterly inveighs against. For
first he owns, that the whole Practice of <HI>Ino∣culation</HI>
was manag'd by unskillful Persons;
and that many <HI>who dy'd or suffer'd much un∣der</HI>
Inoculation, <HI>if they had had better Ma∣nagement,
might have had better Fate.</HI> That
the Practitioners neglected <HI>as trivial both the
Advantages of a suitable Season, and a well prepared
Body; That they</HI> Inoculated <HI>all A∣ges
and Constitutions from the Beginning;
That they</HI> Inoculated <HI>Women with Child, and
Hysterical people:</HI> And after all, <HI>They pra∣ctis'd
it at first with indifferent good Success:
That it had been practis'd, since the Middle
of</HI> June <HI>to the Date of his Letter,</HI> Dec. 20.
<HI>upon above two hundred Subjects with vari∣ous
Succcess.</HI> He tells you in his second Let∣ter,
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<HI>That they had at that Time the Expe∣rience
of two or three Hundred</HI> Inoculated:
And after all this, in all his three Letters, he
gives you only two Letters of the Name of
one <HI>Inoculated</HI> Person who dy'd, Mrs. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l.</HI>
He says at Random, <HI>that others dy'd of it,
whom Time may bring to Light.</HI> Were the
Bodies of those <HI>Inoculated</HI> Persons hid under
Dunghills? Had they not Christian Burial?
It is wondrous strange, that in a Place, where
the Practitioners in Physick and the Magi∣strates
both were against <HI>Inoculation,</HI> he could
not come at the Knowledge of a Mortal
Case but one, the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Mrs. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l,</HI>
who is trump'd up upon all Occasions: He
says, <HI>many of the</HI> Inoculated <HI>suffer much,</HI>
Page 2. What then? A Person that has the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> even in the gentlest Sort, must
suffer, And at last, Page 10, he ingenuously
acknowledges, <HI>That the</HI> Small Pox (acquir'd
by <HI>Inoculation</HI>) <HI>is frequently more favourable
than in the common Way, and not altogether
so mortal.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That not one of the</HI> Inoculated
<HI>during the Space of five or six Months has
had the</HI> Small Pox <HI>in the natural Way, so
far as we know</HI>; that is, of about three
hundred People <HI>Inoculated,</HI> some of which,
no doubt, had only those Eruptions, which
they will not allow to be the genuine <HI>Small
Pox</HI>; In a Time, when the <HI>whole Town
and Country was an Hospital of People sick</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="37"/><HI>of the Distemper, and few Persons exempt
from its Rage, for the Space of five or six
Months,</HI> not so much as one had the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> for <HI>ought they knew:</HI> I say, if such a
Case had happen'd, it is not probable it could
have been conceal'd; and that this Acknow∣ledgment
from one, who is so zealous an E∣nemy
to the Practice, is a stronger Proof of
the Efficacy of it, for the Purpose intended,
than all the <HI>Ifs</HI> and <HI>May-be's</HI> of this or any
other Letter-Writer.</P>
<P>It had been fair in this Gentleman to have
given in the Numbers that dy'd of the natu∣ral
Sort of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> during that Season;
or to have stated the Case fairly between two
or three Hundred sick of the natural Sort, and
as many of the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Kind, both under
the Care and Direction of unskillful and un∣experienc'd
People: And then, perhaps, as in
the <HI>Inoculated</HI> Kind, he could instance, by
Name, only One that dy'd; In the other Sort
he would have been puzzled to find the
Names of those who escap'd.</P>
<P>But to this he will say, that the <HI>Inocula∣ted
Small Pox</HI> propagated the Mortality of
the natural Sort. There is a full Answer gi∣ven
to this Objection of spreading Infection
before. I think it is hard to exclude Men
from the Means of securing themselves from
a great Pestilence, upon a meer Suggestion:
The Influence of the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> up∣on
Mankind, in any Place, in a Circle of
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
Years, may be affirm'd to be uniform with
strong Probability; and if the Air of any
Place, in a contagious <HI>Season,</HI> is such, as ren∣ders
the Distemper very mortal, it is a strong
Motive for People to take the Advantage of
a good Season, and secure themselves in
Time from a Plague, which is so likely to de∣stroy
them: And if Prudence only were to
be consulted, it would perhaps be much more
the Duty of the Legislature to order, than to
forbid this Practice. And no doubt, accord∣ing
to the Acknowledgment of the Enemies
of this Practice, they would, by this Method,
diminish the Mortality, and encrease the
Number of their People; and the Magistrate
is forc'd often upon more arbitrary Proceed∣ings
in any Pestilence: But as that would
seem too great an Encroachment upon the
natural Rights of Mankind, I should not ap∣prove
of it. But on the other Hand, it would
be a most Tyrannical Encroachment upon
the same Rights, to debar Mankind from the
lawful Means of securing themselves from
the Fear and Danger of so terrible a Plague.</P>
<P>As for the particular <HI>Faetor,</HI> that, accord∣ing
to the Letter, <HI>attends the Sores of the In∣oculated</HI>;
it is much of a Piece with the
Story of the <HI>Kentish Long - Tayls:</HI> It shews
him to be an utter Stranger to the whole
Practice; and makes one doubt, whether he
ever saw a Case of <HI>Inoculation</HI> quite through.
And the <HI>Pointing at the</HI> Inoculated <HI>in the</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
<HI>Streets,</HI> is as great an Instance of Barbarity,
as the other is of Ignorance.</P>
<P>There is a Letter in Town from the Revd.
Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> at <HI>Boston</HI> of a later Date, which
has several remarkable Passages in it. <HI>The
Distemper</HI> (meaning the Small Pox) <HI>has late∣ly
visited and ransacked the City of</HI> Boston;
<HI>and in little more than half a Year, of about
five thousand Persons, that have undergone
it, near nine hundred have died.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But how many Lives might have been
sav'd, if our unhappy Physicians had not poi∣son'd
and bewitch'd our People with a blind
Rage, that has appear'd, very like a Satanick
Possession, against the Method of Relief and
Safety in the way of the</HI> Small Pox <HI>Inocula∣ted?
I prevail'd with one Physician (and for
it, I have had bloody Attempts made upon
my Life by some of our Energumens) to in∣troduce
the Practice; and the Experiment
has been made upon almost three hundred Sub∣jects
in our Neighbourhood, young and old,
from one Year to seventy; weak and strong,
Male and Female, white and black; in Mid∣summer,
in Autumn and Winter: And it suc∣ceeds
to Admiration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot learn that any one has died of it,
tho' the Experiment has been made under va∣rious
and marvellous Disadvantages. Five
or six have died upon it or after it; but from
other Accidents.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40"/>
He mentions afterward <HI>that Cats had it</HI>;
<HI>and takes notice of the same thing in Doctor</HI>
Leigh's <HI>History of</HI> Lancashire; <HI>and subjoins,</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>it was generally complain'd that Pi∣geon-houses
of the City continu'd unfruitful;
and the Pigeons did not lay or hatch, as they
us'd to do, all the while that the</HI> Small Pox
<HI>was in its Epidemical Progress: And it is
very strongly affirmed, that our Dunghill
Fowl felt much of the like upon them.</HI></P>
<P>At last concludes; <HI>with the great Benefit
they have found by Blisters early apply'd and
continu'd in the natural</HI> Small Pox, <HI>and is
sorry it was so late before they fell into this
Way; but it has constantly prosper'd: I
know not, says he, that it has once miscar∣ried
since we came into it.</HI> I refer the Rea∣der
to his Letter annex'd.</P>
<P>It appears by this Letter, that somewhat
more than one out of five, and less than one
out of six died of the Distemper. And like∣wise,
by the Effects mention'd upon Animals,
that the general Contagion was owing to a
bad Disposition of the Air; and not char∣geable
upon <HI>Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>And lastly, notwithstanding the unfavou∣rable
Constitution of the Air, the <HI>Inoculated</HI>
did well.</P>
<P>I doubt not but the impartial Reader is
now satisfy'd that this Practice of <HI>Inocula∣tion</HI>
may be still beneficial to Mankind, not∣withstanding
any thing that the Doctor has
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
adduc'd to the contrary, either by way of
Argument or Fact. And that by the same
zealous Partiality, it had been easy to have
crush'd any, the most useful Practice in Me∣dicine
in the Beginning. It is pretty remar∣kable,
that in a Neighbouring Nation, where
Agues are the best Branch of the Physicians
Practice, the Use of the Bark has been, and
is still in a great Measure, suppress'd by Me∣thods
not much unlike what are us'd against
<HI>Inoculation</HI>; and indeed every one of the
Doctor's Arguments would have concluded
more strongly against the Use of the <HI>Cortex,</HI>
than against this Practice. I will suppose any
Stickler against the Bark to have reason'd
thus in the Doctor's Strain. <HI>A Drug that
has been only us'd among Slaves, an illiterate
unthinking People, who have the Advantage
of a warm Climate, and a Spare Dyet, is not
fit to be immediately dispens'd to the</HI> English,
<HI>whose Blood, speaking of it as National, is
the Product of the Richest Dyet: Is it not
plain by the Diseases that it often leaves be∣hind
it, that it spoils the Constitution? Wit∣ness
the Jaundice, Tumours of the Legs, and
other Cachexies that are often subsequent up∣on
it. Besides none but Empirics can give
a Medicine of which they are not sure of the
Dose; Is it not plain that it will not answer
the Design of preventing the Disease for the
future? For notwithstanding the Use of this
Drug, the Patient suffers many a Relapse. Be∣sides</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
<HI>there are not only one or two, but innu∣merable
Instances of People who have died
after the Use of it; and others, who have
had a diseased Constitution all the rest of their
Lives. The Dispensers of this Medicine dis∣agree
widely among themselves, both as to
the Manner of its Operation and the Dose;
Some give it in Tincture; some in Substance;
some in greater, some in lesser Quantities, &amp;c.
In fine, there are three Letters from a Friend
in</HI> New England, <HI>which inform me that ma∣ny
who have taken the Bark have suffer'd ve∣ry
much; and Mrs.</HI> D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l, <HI>who had taken
great Quantities of it, actually died, &amp;c. Tho'
I have not my self made Use of this Medicine,
nor seen much of the Effects of it; I am well
assur'd, that not a fourth part of the Diseases
it pretends to cure, are Genuine Agues: Be∣fore
I had seen the Practice of this Medicine,
I affirmed, that is was impossible, it would cure
an Ague; but I am willing to retract that
Opinion, being convinc'd by an Experiment,
that it does so sometimes.</HI> It were easy to
carry this Parallel reasoning thro' the whole
Letter, not only with equal, but more
Strength in most Places.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in appearing with so great
Zeal against this Practice, is not the Repre∣sentative
of the whole Faculty. For there
are many of them who from their Disinte∣restedness
and Innate Love to Mankind, are
willing, that an Experiment should go on,
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
which, in Proportion to the Extensiveness of
the Practice, must necessarily diminish the
Mortality of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in general: This
is a candid, as well as decent Way of proceed∣ing.
At the same Time, I only blame the
Author of the Letter, and those who take
part with him, for their too early and strong
Prejudices; being unwilling to Censure
their Intentions, which I hope, are for the
Good of Mankind, as well as my own.</P>
<P>But there is still a stronger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Massey's Sermon,</HI> Page 6.</NOTE> Objection a∣gainst
this Practice; <HI>That it is unlawful, and
first introduc'd by the Devil, who Ingrafted</HI>
Job <HI>of the Confluent Sort of</HI> Small Pox.</P>
<P>From useful Discoveries, there can always
be drawn important Consequences. <HI>First,</HI>
Hence learn we, that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is an
ancient Disease; for if it was convey'd to
Job <HI>by some such Way as</HI> Inoculation, the
Matter must have been taken from some Bo∣dy
Infected with the Distemper. <HI>Secondly,</HI>
That <HI>Sydenham</HI> was not the first that began
the <HI>cool Regimen</HI>; for <HI>Job</HI> fat down upon
the Ashes in the open Air; <HI>his Friends saw
him afar off. Thirdly,</HI> That his Friends were
tardy, above three Weeks before they came
to see him; for in the Genuine Confluent
Kind of <HI>Small Pox,</HI> it will be that Time
before they can bear scraping with a Pot∣sherd.
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> Beloved, this confluent Sort
of <HI>Small Pox</HI> were more gentle, to be sure,
than the common natural Ones; for he seems
neither to have had Delirium, sore Throat,
nor Shortness of Breath; he talk'd distinctly
and good Sense.</P>
<P>Now here a Question ariseth, Whether an
honest Man can do that which the Devil has
done? I answer in the Affirmative; there are
three things mention'd; of the Devil's Assem∣bling
himself (as in this Place) with the Sons
of God; Believing, and Quoting of Scripture.
All these Things a good Man may not only
do, but is bound to do.</P>
<P>I readily agree with this Reverend Divine,
that if <HI>Inoculating</HI> the <HI>Small Pox</HI> be an un∣lawful
Action, it cannot be justify'd by the
Good which may ensue from it; but that
it is unlawful, must be prov'd, either by some
natural or positive Law: That this Reverend
Gentleman has brought no such Proof, either
from natural or reveal'd Religion, will ap∣pear
plain upon a very short Review of his
Discourse.</P>
<P>Page 13.] He says he will attempt to prove,
<HI>That Diseases are utterly unlawful to be infli∣cted
by any who profess themselves Christians:</HI>
He terms it very right; for it is an Attempt
to Prove, and no more. By restraining the
Prohibition to Christians, one would think,
there was some positive Command in the Go∣spel
against it; but he has brought none, which,
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
by the most forc'd Construction, can prove
<HI>Inoculation</HI> to be prohibited by the Christian
Dispensation. I know of no Immorality that
is forbid to a Christian, the Practice of which
is allow'd to an Infidel. Indeed Morality is
more clearly taught and more strongly en∣forc'd
by Rewards and Punishments amongst
us; but it does not change its Nature amongst
the rest of Mankind. He does not wonder,
that the Practice of <HI>Inoculation</HI> should obtain,
where the Doctrine of <HI>Fatality</HI> is believ'd; but
the Misfortune is, that the Matter of Fact is
quite otherwise: For if he had carefully pe∣rus'd
Dr. <HI>Wagstaffe</HI>'s Discourse, which he so
much commends, that would have inform'd
him, <HI>That no Body pretends to give us an In∣stance
of an</HI> Inoculated Turk. And why? Be∣cause
their Belief of a Fatality makes them
neglect very much the ordinary Helps of Me∣dicine
for preserving their Lives.</P>
<P>Page 14.] The Instances which he gives
of Almighty God's having given a miracu∣lous
Power to Mankind to inflict Diseases
for their Punishment, does not prove, that
He has not given them an ordinary one for
their Benefit.</P>
<P>And his saying, [Pag.15] <HI>That no Man was
ever yet condemn'd to an immediate Sickness,
for Want of sufficient Authority</HI>; is, without
any Proof. Diseases are External, and In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>;
the Magistrate very often inflicts both:
That Criminals are lawfully punish'd with the
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
Mutilation of their Body, I suppose he will
allow to be common. Is not that inflicting
a Disease with a Witness? And are there not
many Executions perform'd by Poison, which
is inflicting an Internal mortal Disease? And
here his own Argument turns upon him; for
<HI>if Diseases are sent for the Punishment of
our Sins,</HI> then it would seem to follow, that
the Magistrate, who has a Power from God to
punish our Crimes, has likewise a Power to
inflict Diseases, <HI>for Sins that are manifest to
him and all the World.</HI> The greater Power
of inflicting Death, certainly includes the les∣ser
in the Choice of the Means: If, for Ex∣ample,
there should be a Law made to pu∣nish
the <HI>Inoculators</HI> with the <HI>Inoculation</HI> of
some Disease, I fancy this Reverend Divine
would not think it sinful or unreasonable.</P>
<P>Page 16.] He spends a long Paragraph, to
prove what no Body ever deny'd; That a
Man cannot lawfully do all that is in his Po∣wer
to do: And another as evident, That the
Means, as well as the Intention, must be law∣ful;
but these are only general Propositions;
The Subsumption, that inflicting Diseases for
a good Purpose is unlawful, is only suppos'd,
not prov'd.</P>
<P>Page 18.] He <HI>doubts whether the Life of
Man be a Good or not.</HI> If the Life of Man is
no Good, then, indeed, to act for the Pre∣servation
of it, is not to act for any good
End; and consequently, not only this Pra∣ctice,
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
but all others in Medicine, and many
other charitable Actions, must be given up.
The rest of the Argument of this Paragraph,
is grounded upon the Insufficiency of this
Method for the Purpose intended. The Do∣ctor
might have remember'd, from his Ex∣position
of his Text, <HI>Job</HI> had the <HI>Small Pox</HI>
by <HI>Inoculation</HI> from the Devil, even of a fa∣vourable
Sort; that he recover'd of them,
and never had them again. But in this he must
forgive me, if I put him in Mind, that he is
out of his Sphere; and that notwithstanding
his Professions to the contrary, he lays aside
the Divine, and takes upon him the Physi∣cian.
The Question here is, Whether giving
a Disease with a good Intention, be in it self
an unlawful Action.</P>
<P>Page 20.] Another Argument is, <HI>That a
Law which forbids the Evil, forbids also e∣very
thing that has a Tendency to it; therefore
all causeless and voluntary Mutilations are for∣bid:</HI>
And yet, notwithstanding this Law against
Mutilation, more express than any against <HI>I∣noculation,</HI>
Surgeons cut off Peoples Limbs.
Here the Intention hallows the Action, which
is in itself expresly forbid; and which is more,
I believe no Surgeon will affirm, that in all
Cases, where Limbs are cut off, there is a
direct Impossibility to save the Patient's Life
otherwise; or that the Operation is always
successful. A Surgeon who cuts a Person for
the <HI>Stone,</HI> even if his Patient dies of the O∣peration,
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
does not think he has committed
a mortal Sin, in inflicting a mortal Disease;
and yet the Patient perhaps might have liv'd
many Years, and not dy'd of the Distemper at
last. The Difference of the two Cases, the
one being for Cure, the other for Prevention,
does not change the State of the Question;
which, in general Terms, is this, Whether
Mankind have a Lawful Power of inflicting
Diseases for good Purposes? A Person who
has not had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> may be very
justly consider'd, as having the Seeds of a
mortal Distemper within him; and the Dread
of it is surely a Suffering, that will justify the
Lawfulness of using Means, which have the
greatest Probability of saving him from a
Danger, which, for ought he knows, may
be nearer and greater, than that of a Stone
in the Bladder. Anxiety and Bodily Pain,
don't differ so much, as to make an Action
lawful in one Case, sinful in the other.</P>
<P>Page 21.] But it seems <HI>it is a Tempting of
Providence.</HI> And there is no great Diffe∣rence
between the <HI>Devil's Proposal to our
Saviour, to cast himself down headlong, and
that of</HI> Inoculation. It is wonderful, into
what Absurdities, Zeal for an Opinion, will
drive a Man, even to assert that there is no
Difference between a Man's running into a
Danger absolutely unnecessary, and from
which nothing but a direct Miracle can save
him; and a Venturing on a small Hazard to
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
avoid a much greater. The Case put it as
disadvantagiously as possible, more resem∣bles
that of a Person who leaps out of a Win∣dow
for fear of Fire, and surely that can ne∣ver
be reckon'd a Mistrust of Providence,
even if he did it before he was much in Dan∣ger;
for no body can say that God Almighty
may not save a Man from Fire in the ordi∣nary
Course of his Providence; And if a Per∣son,
who being prompted by his too early
Fears had taken this Course, and lost his Life
by the Fall; no body will arraign him of
<HI>Self-murder:</HI> He might have done an impru∣dent,
but not a sinful Action. The Parents
who suffer their Children to converse with
their infected Relations; which differs in no
Moral Point from the Case of <HI>Inoculation,</HI>
would think it very hard to be treated as Ho∣micides
or Murderers of their Children, when
the very Action proceeds from, the contrary
Principle, extreme Tenderness.</P>
<P>Pag. 22.] In the former Page, it was a pre∣sumptuous
Trust; in this, it is an intire Mis∣trust
of Providence. He is sure to have the
<HI>Inoculators</HI> some way or other.</P>
<P>Pag. 23.] They cannot pray for a Blessing
upon their Endeavours; because Prayer sup∣poses
the Use of lawful Means.</P>
<P>I believe the contrary is true, for as a
Person, who is <HI>Inoculated,</HI> puts himself more
immediately into the Hands of God, if he
has any Sense of Religion, cannot avoid
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
praying for a Blessing upon the Means, which,
to be sure, he thinks lawful, and has not yet
been prov'd to be otherwise.</P>
<P>Page 24.] His Argument to prove that
<HI>Inoculation</HI> tends to promote Vice and Im∣mortality
is the most extraordinary of all.
This it does, by taking off the Dread of
the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and consequently the Re∣straints
of Sobriety that Mankind lie under
upon that Account. This Reverend Gentle∣man
has very justly found fault with one Ma∣xim,
to <HI>do Evil that Good may come of it:</HI>
But he has establish'd one, just as dangerous
in the room of it, <HI>not to do Good least Evil
come of it.</HI> For if the Diminishing the Fear
of Dying of Diseases catch'd by Irregularity,
is an Evil, then an able Physician is a com∣mon
Nuisance. We have reason to be thank∣ful,
that there are a sufficient Number left,
who cannot be charg'd with being Encoura∣gers
of Vice and Immorality, upon this Score.
This Principle in its full Extent would de∣stroy
all Works of Charity and Mercy; for
the Hope of Forgiveness is an Encouragment
to do Injuries; and the Hope of being re∣liev'd
in Want is a Discouragement to In∣dustry.</P>
<P>I am touch'd with the devout Reflections
upon Providence, that are all along spread
thro' his Sermon, to which I subscribe with
all my Heart; but I cannot so much com∣mend
the Distorting those great and solemn
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
Truths of our Holy Religion to mantain lit∣tle
Party Interests and fashionable Opinions.
The Text that is quoted Pag. 22. that the ve∣ry
Hairs of our Head are numbred; I take to
be a stronger Argument against Periwigs and
Shaving; than all that the Sermon contains
against <HI>Inoculation:</HI> Our Hairs of our Beards
were given us for an Ornament by Provi∣dence,
and it is known, that many have
catch'd great Colds with mortal DisEases en∣suing
upon them by Shaving. Is not a Man
answerable for all the bad Effects that fol∣low
upon an unwarrantable Action that con∣tradicts
the very Intention of Providence?</P>
<P>The Peroration Page 29, is equal to any
Piece of the whole Performance, <HI>Let the A∣theist and the Scoffer, the Heathen and the
Unbeliever disclaim a Dependance upon Pro∣vidence:
Let them</HI> Inoculate <HI>and be</HI> Inocu∣lated,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> I think this clinches the whole
Matter; and this Reverend Gentleman has
furnish'd us with a new, sensible and religious
Test, an Atheist or Infidel can be found out,
as a Witch, by the Marks upon his Body: And
that, as it has been intimated already, that the
Devil was the first <HI>Inoculator</HI>; I think, it is
not impossible that the next zealous Preacher
upon this Subject may prove the Cicatrices
of <HI>Inoculation</HI> to be the Mark of the Beast.
Thus it appears, that the Doctors Position, of
the Unlawfulness of inflicting Diseases for
good Purposes, is groundless, and contrary
to the common Usages of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52"/>
I have been oblig'd to be the more parti∣cular
in answering this <HI>Sermon,</HI> because the
Charge in it against the <HI>Inoculators,</HI> is hea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>
than that in the Letter, in as much as
immorality is a greater Fault than bad Pra∣ctice
in Physick.</P>
<P>From all that I have said, I will draw this
one Conclusion; that there does not appear
as yet any Objection of Weight enough to
stop the Progress of the Practice of <HI>Inocula∣tion.</HI>
But if upon future Trials, it should
be found that the Inconveniencies do over∣ballance
the Advantages of it; I shall then
be as ready to condemn, as I am now to
justify it.</P>

<HEAD>The CASE of Mr. DEGRAVE'S
Daughter, in a LETTER to Mr.
MAITLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find my Daughter's Case has made some
Noise in Town; and has been misrepre∣sented.
It was thus: She was <HI>Inoculated</HI> the
23d of <HI>Febr.</HI> 1721-2; and as I saw her daily
during the three Weeks that she was con∣fin'd
after the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> so I can affirm, no
<HI>Small Pox</HI> ever appear'd uponher during that
Time, but only Heats and Flushings, attend∣ed
sometimes with Heaviness and Pain in her
Head, and a little more Quickness of Pulse
than usual, and oftentimes without any Dis∣order
at all: None of those Heats and Flush∣ings
ever came to Perfection, or to any thing
like the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> which gave my Daugh∣ter
some Uneasiness; and the rather, that the
other Persons, who had been <HI>Inoculated</HI> at
the same Time, and in the same House with
her, had a very fair distinct <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and
yet had less Sickness than She: Nor did
the Incisions in her Arms discharge so much
and so long as theirs did; and therefore were
compleatly heal'd in less than three Weeks
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
Time, when the Sores of the other Person,
were yet large and running. Thus all Expe∣ctation
of her having the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by the
<HI>Inoculation</HI> being over, she was purg'd once
or twice, and then discharg'd from her Con∣finement,
the 17th of <HI>March</HI> following:
Nay, it was believ'd, she never would have
that Distemper; for having been very much
expos'd to the Infection, when the was but
two Years of Age, and yet more when the
was about Eight, without contracting it, this
last Tryal being unsuccessful, seem'd to give
a tolerable Ground for this Opinion. How∣ever
my Daughter continu'd discompos'd, and
out of Order, when the came Home; the
Heats and Flushings abovemention'd
still sub∣sisting
on her, though in a lesser Degree; her
Stomach loathing Flesh-meats, and her Rest
disturb'd with Dreams and Horrors. She had
likewise two small Boils, one under her Arm,
and another on her Side: But none of these
Accidents were troublesome enough to hin∣der
her Attendance on her accustom'd Busi∣ness
within and without the House: How∣ever
these continuing for about two Months
after she came Home, the was purg'd once or
twice, in order to remove them; but still they
subsisted upon her, not to any Degree, 'till
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> broke out upon her, which
happen'd in this Manner: Three Days be∣fore,
she had heated herself extraordinarily;
the first, by going to the <HI>Camp</HI> and back a∣gain,
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
on Foot, in a very warm Day; the se∣cond,
by walking heartily to the <HI>Charter-House,</HI>
to see her Brother and returning
Home; and the third Day in going and sit∣ting
at the <HI>Play-House</HI> in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</HI>
As she sat at this last Place, the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> broke out upon her: at least, I never per∣ceiv'd
it upon her, 'till her Return; at which
my Daughter was surpriz'd, she having had no
Illness whatever, that could hinder her Plea∣sure
at the Play, and her walking Home;
or any such precursory Warnings of that Di∣stemper,
which I hear have been divulg'd A∣broad.
As soon as the <HI>Small Pox</HI> had ap∣pear'd,
she recover'd her Stomach for those
Flesh-meats she had loath'd before; and came
to that natural compos'd Sleep, of which she
had been depriv'd since the <HI>Inoculation</HI>; And
she having gone through the most favourable
Periods of that Distemper, she got well in
Eight Days from That I perceiv'd the first
Eruption; so that I must conclude, from the
Symptoms which my Daughter was by Times
afflicted with, during Eleven Weeks after
she had been <HI>Inoculated,</HI> that it appears evi∣dent
to me, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> she had then, was
the Effect of the <HI>Inoculation,</HI> although it has
shew'd itself much later than is usual, after
that Operation. As to the <HI>Itch,</HI> that appear'd
upon her about the same Time with the
<HI>Small Pox:</HI> I can only account for it thus;
She had been Infected by her Brother, about
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
three Months before she was <HI>Inoculated,</HI> and
I thonght her cur'd of it by the same Means
that were Efficacious for the Cure of her
Brother. It is certain that when she was, there
was no Appearance subsisting of that Distem∣per,
nor any Shew of it, 'till that Time the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> appear'd upon her. However, she
is perfectly cur'd of the <HI>Itch,</HI> by the same
Means that were us'd at first: And I thank
God, my Daughter is at present as well, if
not better, in every Respect, than ever she
was in her Life.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>A Letter from Dr. NETTLETON, at
<HI>Halifax</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> to Dr. JURIN,
R.S.Secr.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Answer to what you require from me,
as to what has been farther done, I have
only to add, that since I writ to Dr. <HI>Whita∣ker,</HI>
I have made the <HI>Insition</HI> upon about fif∣teen
Persons, who have all had the Distem∣per
very favourably, and got thro' it with a
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
great deal of Ease. As nothing uncommon
or extraordinary did happen in any of these
Cases, it will not be necessary to trouble you
with a particular Account of any of them:
They were most of them at some Distance;
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> being, in a great Measure,
gone from this Town and Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I am very sensible of the Favour done me
by the Royal Society, who were pleased to
take Notice of my Letter to Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI>
which you had nothing to move you to, be∣sides
a generous Disposition to encourage the
smallest Attempts towards any thing, that
may tend to publick Advantage. I must own
that all the Information I had concerning this
Affair, which I have happen'd to be engaged
in was entirely from the <HI>Philosophical
Transactions.</HI> 'Tis now about six Years since
the Royal Society did communicate to the
World some Letters from two very conside∣rable
Physicians residing in <HI>Turky,</HI> whose
good Sense or Integrity we had no reason to
call in question; these Gentlemen did so∣lemnly
assure us, that the Method of <HI>Inocu∣lation</HI>
had been for many Years practis'd in
those Parts of the World, with almost con∣stant
Success. I had, as well as all others
who have been engaged in, the Practice, with
sufficient Sorrow and Concern, been called
to many in the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> whose Cases were
so deplorable, as to admit of no Relief. And
therefore I could not but be very thoughtful
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
about this Method, which promised to carry
Persons thro' that cruel Distemper, with so
much Ease and Safety. I was so far from
knowing that it was a Crime, that I always
thought it the Duty of our Profession, to do
what we could to preserve the Lives of those
who commit themselves to our Care. And
I know no Reason, why we ought not, with
all humble Thankfulness to Almighty God,
to make Use of any Means, which his good
Providence shall bring to Light conducing to
that End. This Matter, tho' of so great Im∣portance,
lying dormant so long after it was
known, is, I presume a sufficient Proof, that
none have been very forward to try Expe∣riments.
But when we had the Account in the
publick Papers, that it had by their <HI>Royal-Highness</HI>'s
Command been done with Suc∣cess
at <HI>London,</HI> I could not be satisfy'd with∣out
trying it here. I was soon convinced,
that it would be of very great Use; and the
more Experience I have had of it since, the
more I am confirm'd in the same Opinion. I
believe all others, who have seen any thing of
this Practice, are in the same Sentiment, and
there is no doubt, but in a few Years the
World will acknowledge the Service, which
the Royal Society have done to Mankind, in
first revealing to this Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> a Thing
so beneficial as it will certainly prove; for
tho' some few unfortunate Accidents may
sometimes happen, yet these will be very rare
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
in comparison of the many sad and disastrous
Events, which this Distemper has been, and
ever will be very fruitful of, while it is left
to rage in its full Force and Violence.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I doubt not but when you Love col∣lected
a sufficient number of Observations for
it, you will be able to demonstrate, that the
Hazard in this Method is very inconsiderable,
in proportion to that in the ordinary way by
accidental Contagion, so small, that it ought
not to deter any body from making use of it.
In order to satisfy my self, what Proportion
the Number of those that die of the <HI>Small
Pox,</HI> might bear to the whole Number that
is seized with the Distemper; in the Natural
way, I have made some Enquiry hereabouts,
and I shall take the Freedom to transmit the
Accounts to you, because I believe you may
depend upon their being taken with sufficient
Care and Impartiality. In <HI>Halifax</HI> since the
Beginning of last Winter, 276 have had the
<HI>Small Pox,</HI> and out of that Number 43 have
died. In <HI>Rochdale,</HI> a small Neighbouring
Market Town, 177 have had the Distemper,
and 38 have died. In <HI>Leeds,</HI> 792 have had
the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and 189 have died. It is
to be noted, that in this Town, the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> have been more favourable this Season
than usual, and in <HI>Leeds</HI> they have been more
than usually mortal; but upon a <HI>Medium</HI> in
these three Towns, there have died nearly 22
out of every hundred, which is above a <HI>fifth</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="61"/> <HI>Part,</HI> of all that have been infected in the na∣tural
way. I have in these Accounts con∣fin'd
my self to the Limits of the Towns.
The Numbers that have had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in
the Country round about, is vastly greater;
but the Proportion of those that die is much
the same. I have made the Enquiry in seve∣ral
Country Villages hereabouts, in some I
found the Proportion to be greater, in others
less, but in the main it is nearly the same.</P>

in <HI>New England</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>March 10<SUP>th</SUP> 1721/2.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SO considerable a Part of Mankind fear∣fully
perishing by the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; and
many more of us grievously suffering by
that miserable Distemper, you will allow me
to entertain you with a few more Commu∣nications,
and writ (I think it's) a fourth
Letter upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
The <HI>Distemper</HI> has lately visited and ran∣sack'd
the City of <HI>Boston</HI>; and in little more
than half a Year, of more then five thousand
Persons that have undergone it, near nine
hundred have died. But how many Lives
might have been saved, if our unhappy <HI>Phy∣sicians,</HI>
had not <HI>poison'd and bewitch'd</HI> our
People with a <HI>blind Rage,</HI> that has appear'd
very like a <HI>Satanick Possession,</HI> against the
Method of Relief and Safety in the way of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> Inoculated.</P>
<P>I prevail'd with one Physician, (and for it
I have had bloody Attempts made upon <HI>my
Life</HI> by some of our <HI>Energumens</HI>) to intro∣duce
the Practice; and the Experiment has
been made upon almost three hundred Ob∣jects
in our Neighbourhoud, Young and Old;
(from one Year to seventy) weak and strong;
Male and Female, White and Black; in Mid∣summer,
in Autumn, in Winter, and it suc∣ceeds
to Admiration.</P>
<P>I cannot learn that any one has died of it;
tho' the Experiment has been made under va∣rious
and marvellous Disadvantages. Five or
six have died upon it, or after it, but from o∣ther
Diseases or Accidents; chiefly from hav∣ing
taken the Infection in the common way,
by Inspiration, before it could be given them
in this way of <HI>Transplantation.</HI> However at
present I need say no more of this, having al∣ready
given you some Report of our Proceed∣ings
in it.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63"/>
To them who are under the <HI>Inoculation</HI> of
the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> we commonly give a <HI>Vomit,</HI>
in the time of their <HI>Decumbiture,</HI> a Day or
two before the expected Eruption. One of
our Patients not vomiting so freely as he
would have done, thrust a Finger or two into
his Throat, which fetch'd up, what was to be
discharg'd from his uneasy Stomach; He had
but a few of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and the Pustules
were sufficiently of the <HI>distinct Sort,</HI> as it
uses to be where they have the <HI>Small Pox In∣oculated</HI>;
but the Fingers that had been thus
employ'd, prov'd as full as they could hold, of
the <HI>confluet Sort,</HI> which he now thought his
whole Body would have been, if we had not
in this Way prevented it.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Leigh</HI> in his <HI>Natural History</HI> of
<HI>Lancashire,</HI> counts it an Occurrence worth
relating, that there were some Catts known
to catch the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; and pass regularly
thro' the State of it, and then to die. We
have had among us the very same Occur∣rence.</P>
<P>It was generally observ'd and complain'd,
that the Pigeon-<HI>Houses</HI> of the City continu'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the <HI>Pigeons</HI> did not <HI>hatch</HI> or
<HI>lay</HI> as they used to do, all the while that the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> was in its Epidemical Progress:
And it is very strongly affirm'd that our
Dunghil Fowl felt much of the like Effect
upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"/>
We have so many among us, who have
been visited with the <HI>Plague</HI> in other Coun∣tries
many Years ago, and who have never
been arrested with the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after it, tho'
they have been exposed as much as any other
People to it; that it now begins to obtain a
Belief with us, that they who have had the
<HI>Plague,</HI> will never have the <HI>Small Pox</HI> af∣ter
it.</P>
<P>I will add but one Thing more. For Suc∣cour
under the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> where Life is in
Danger, after all the Methods and Medicines,
that our <HI>Sydenham</HI> and others rely upon; I
can assure you, we have yet found nothing so
sure as this; Procure for the Patient, as early as
may be, by <HI>Epispastiks</HI> a plentiful Discharge
at the <HI>Hand-writs,</HI> or Ancles, or both, (I say
as early as my be) and keep them running
till the Danger is over. When the Venom
of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> makes an evident or vio∣lent
Invasion on the Nobler Parts this Dis∣charge
<HI>does wonderfully.</HI> I am sorry it was
so late before we fell into this Way; but it
has <HI>constantly prosper'd:</HI> I know not that it
has once miscarried, since we came into it.</P>

<HEAD>My Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>st</HI>'s Servants Case, by one
that constantly attended him.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>st's</HI> Six Children were
<HI>Inoculated</HI> the 18<HI>th April:</HI> Five of
them had got thro' the <HI>Small Pox</HI> before the
30<HI>th,</HI> when his Servant was <HI>Inoculated.</HI> He
came from <HI>Cirencester</HI> to My Lord's House in
<HI>London</HI> about the Time that his Children had
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> on them, with an Intent to be
Inoculated; but Matter could not be found so
soon as desired, and the Fellow in the mean
time liv'd among the Servants that attended
on My Lord's Children: Whether he had
contracted any Infection by that Commerce
is not determin'd; or whether the Disorder
he had on him three or four Days before he
was Inoculated, may be ascribed to that, as
some have thought, or to a Change of Dyet
and Air, or only to a Cold caught; 'tis most
certain he complain'd then of Pain in his
Head and Bones; and was feverish. Doctor
<HI>Mead</HI> was consulted, and order'd him to be
blooded, vomited, and other Medicines for
his Relief; and that the Inoculation should
be Postpon'd till after his Recovery: For this
End he was remov'd out of My Lord's House
to a Nurse, who takes People in for the <HI>Small
Pox.</HI> He got well of his Complaints the 28<HI>th
April</HI>; and 'twas thought proper to Inocu∣late
him the 30<HI>th Ditto.</HI> He kept well till the
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
<HI>5th May,</HI> and then had no other Disorder on
him than what is usual before the Eruption of
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> after Inoculation. On the 6<HI>th</HI>
the Eruptions were plain of the distinct large
Kind, and he was relieved on that Account;
but at Night his Complaints returned on him,
and were rather more severe than they had
been, he having then a kind of <HI>Dilirium,</HI> fre∣quent
Vomitings and Stools; These conti∣nuing
the 7<HI>th,</HI> Doctor <HI>Arbothnot</HI> was call'd
to his Assistance. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> saw him also
the next Day. They prescrib'd several things,
which had the desir'd Success; but at this
Time his Body was cover'd with <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
and most of it of the confluent Sort. He
continu'd in a tolerable good Way till the
11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> when his Fever was sharper on
him, with a <HI>Dilirium</HI> and Difficulty of
Breathing. He was then blooded and blisterd,
but without any Effect. He died the 12<HI>th,</HI>
and was open'd the 13<HI>th.</HI> Then upon Inspe∣cting
the Outside of his Body, the Face and
Limbs were found as full of <HI>Small Pox</HI> as
they could hold; as were also two Places in
his Breast and Shoulders; they all appearing
of the Confluent Sort. Nothing Material
was observ'd in the Dissection of his Body,
saving that the Lungs were Inflamed and mor∣tified;
and that in the Cavities of the Thorax
there was a pretty large Quantity of bloody
Matter extravasated.</P>
