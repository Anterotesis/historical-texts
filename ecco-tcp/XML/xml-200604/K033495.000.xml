<P>THE following PROLOGUE was Spoken to the Dramatic Pastoral, call∣ed the <HI>Winter</HI>'s <HI>Tale,</HI> and this Comedy; both of which are altered from <HI>Shakespear,</HI> and were perform'd the same Night.</P>
<P>Some of the Lines of the PROLOGUE are only relative to the <HI>Winter's Tale,</HI> yet as the Publication of that Pastoral is defer'd for some Time, and as the PROLOGUE has been particularly desir'd, it is hop'd that it will not be disagreeable to the Reader to see it prefix'd to this Comedy.</P>

<L>TO various Things the Stage has been compar'd,</L>
<L>As apt Ideas strike each humorous Bard:</L>
<L>This Night, for want of better Simile,</L>
<L>Let this our <HI>Theatre</HI> a <HI>Tavern</HI> be:</L>
<L>The Poets Vintners, and the Waiters we.</L>
<L>So as the Cant, and Custom of the Trade is,</L>
<L><HI>You're welcome</HI> Gem'min, <HI>kindly welcome Ladies.</HI></L>
<L>To draw in Customers, our <HI>Bills</HI> are spread,</L>
<L>You cannot miss the Sign, 'tis <HI>Shakespear's Head.</HI></L>
<L>From this same Head, this Fountain-head divine,</L>
<L>For different Palates springs a different Wine!</L>
<L>In which no Tricks, to strengthen, or to thin 'em—</L>
<L>Neat as imported—no <HI>French</HI> Brandy in em'—</L>
<L>Hence for the choicest Spirits flow <HI>Champaign</HI>;</L>
<L>Whose sparkling Atoms shoot thro' every Vein,</L>
<L>Then mount in Magic Vapours to th' enraptur'd Brain!</L>
<L>Hence flow for martial Minds Potations strong;</L>
<L>And sweet Love Potions, for the Fair and Young.</L>
<L>For you my Hearts of Oak, for your Regale, <STAGE>[To the Up∣per Gallery</STAGE></L>
<L>There's good old <HI>English Stingo,</HI> mild and stale.</L>
<L>For high, luxurious Sculs with luscious Smack,</L>
<L>There's <HI>Sir John Falstaff,</HI> is a Butt of Sack:</L>
<L>And if the stronger Liquors more invite ye;</L>
<L><HI>Bardolph</HI> is Gin, and <HI>Pistol</HI> Aqua Vitae.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But shou'd you call for <HI>Falstaff,</HI> where to find him,</L>
<L>He's gone—nor left one Cup of Sack behind him.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Sunk in his Elbow-Chair, no more he'll roam;</L>
<L>No more, with merry Wags, to <HI>Eastcheap</HI> come;</L>
<L>He's gone,—to jest, and laugh, and give his Sack at Home.</L>
<L>As for the learned Critics, grave and deep,</L>
<L>Who catch at Words, and catching fall asleep;</L>
<L>Who in the Storms of Passion—hum,—and haw!</L>
<L>For such, our Master will no Liquor draw—</L>
<L>So blindly thoughtful, and so darkly read,</L>
<L>They take <HI>Tom Durffy</HI>'s, for the <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Vintner once acquir'd both Praise and Gain,</L>
<L>And sold much <HI>Perry</HI> for the best <HI>Champaign.</HI></L>
<L>Some Rakes, this precious Stuff did so allure;</L>
<L>They drank whole Nights—what's that—when Wine is pure?</L>
<L>" Come fill a Bumper, <HI>Jack</HI>—, I will my Lord—</L>
<L>" Here's Cream!—Damn'd fine!—immense!—upon my Word!"</L>
<L>Sir <HI>William,</HI> what say you?—The best, believe me—</L>
<L>In this—Eh <HI>Jack!</HI>—the Devil can't deceive me.</L>
<L>Thus the wise Critic too, mistakes his Wine,</L>
<L>Cries out with lifted Hands, 'tis great!—Divine!</L>
<L>Then jogs his Neighbour, as the Wonders strike him;</L>
<L>This <HI>Shakespear! Shakespear!</HI>—oh there's nothing like him!</L>
<L>In this Night's various, and enchanted Cup,</L>
<L>Some little <HI>Perry</HI>'s mixt for filling up.</L>
<L>The Five long Acts, from which our Three are taken,</L>
<L>Stretch'd out to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Action of the <HI>Winter</HI>'s <HI>Tale,</HI> as written by <HI>Shake∣spear,</HI> comprehends Sixteen Years.</NOTE> sixteen Years, lay by, forsaken.</L>
<L>Lest then this precious Liquor run to waste,</L>
<L>'Tis now consin'd and bottled for your Taste.</L>

<L>Signior <HI>Baptista,</HI> thus it stands with me.</L>
<L><HI>Anthonio,</HI> my Father, is deceased:</L>
<L>You knew him well, and knowing him, know me,</L>
<L>Left solely Heir to all his Lands and Goods,</L>
<L>Which I have better'd, rather than decreas'd.</L>
<L>And I have thrust myself into the World,</L>
<L>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</L>
<L>My Business asketh Haste, old Signior,</L>

<L>Yes, when the special Thing is well obtain'd,</L>
<L>My Daughter's Love, for that is all in all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, Father,</L>
<L>I am as peremptory, as she proud-minded;</L>
<L>And where two raging Fires meet together,</L>
<L>They do consume the Thing that feeds their Fury.</L>
<L>Tho' little Fire grows great with little Wind,</L>
<L>Yet extreme Gusts will blow out Fire and all;</L>
<L>So I to her, and so she yields to me;</L>
<L>For I am rough, and wooe not like a Babe.</L>

<P>Nay, look you, Sir, he tells you flatly what his Mind is: Why give him Gold enough and marry him to a Puppet, or an old Trot with ne'er a Tooth in her Head. Tho' she have as many Diseases as two and fifty Horses; why nothing comes amiss, so Money comes withal.</P>

<P>I pray you, Sir, let him see her while the Humour lasts. O'my Word an' she knew him as well as I do, she would think Scolding would do little Good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a Score Knaves, or so; why, that's nothing; an' he begin once, she'll find her Match. I'll tell you what, Sir, an' she stand him but a little, he will throw a Figure in her Face, and so disfigure her with it, that she shall have no more Eyes to see withal than a Cat—You know him not, Sir.</P>
