<P>A fellow-citizen, warm in the cause

that like a faithful watchman, he may

<HEAD>THE
ESSENCE
OF THE
DOUGLAS CAUSE:</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Importance of the Douglas cause.</NOTE>THE Douglas cause has now made
a noise all over Europe; and in∣deed
no cause ever came before a court of
justice, so interesting in its nature, and
of such universal importance. In one
view it is a question, whether a young
gentleman of distinguished merit, the
only remaining representative of the illus∣trious
house of Douglas, is, after nineteen
years possession of his estate, to be de∣prived
of it, and to be reduced to a situ∣ation
worse than death? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
view, it is a question, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
of birthright, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
for ages, is now to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
plaintiffs have with great expence, in∣dustry
and art, collected an immense mass
of materials, which they have with equal
expence, industry and art, contrived to
arrange in such a manner as to carry a
plausible appearance. The defendant,
from the nature of judicial proceedings,
has been obliged to follow his enemies
through all their doublings, so that he
too has been necessarily involved in a
tedious train of arguments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An abridgement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> received.</NOTE>As the Douglas cause is a question in
which the impartial people of these king∣doms
are very seriously concerned, and
there are few who can submit to the fa∣tigue
of discovering the truth in so motley
a heap, I would flatter myself that this
essay will be favourably received.</P>

Douglas. I own I am most warmly inte∣rested
for him; but I trust that I have

1st, I shall lay down the principles of law
with regard to filiation, or the state which
every man holds in society, and what
ought to be the motives and conduct of
those who carry on a process to deprive a
subject of his birthright. 2dly, I shall
shew the motives and conduct of the
plaintiffs in the Douglas cause. 3dly, I
shall examine the proof which has been
brought against Mr. Douglas. And 4thly,
I shall state the proof for Mr. Douglas.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part 1. Filia∣tion or Birth∣right.</NOTE>Filiation or birthright is of all things
the most valuable to mankind; for all the
blessings and comforts of life, the suc∣cession
of property and of honours, all
the rights and all the affections of blood
flow from it: therefore it is that the wis∣dom
of law hath been particularly careful
that the birthright of the subject should
be inviolably protected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What kind of certainty law re∣quires in filia∣tion.</NOTE>We are not allowed to talk of filiation

There is no doubt but a variety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cases have actually happened; and there∣fore,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
in a strict philosophical sense, there
is properly no certainty in filiation. But
it is the spirit of law to disregard such
possible cases, and not to look for a cer∣tainty
in the abstract, but a legal cer∣tainty.
For law, like a kind parent
ever watchful for the good of her chil∣dren,
hath established such solid rules as
may check the uneasy waverings of scep∣ticism,
and make mankind pass through
life with tranquillity and satisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acknowledg∣ment of parents and general re∣port sufficient.</NOTE>Therefore it is, that according to law,
to ascertain the birthright of the subject,
so as to entitle him to succeed to the
greatest estate and honours, nothing more
is required than his being acknowledged
by two married persons as their child,
and being commonly reputed to be so.
This is a natural and an unsuspicious prin∣ciple.
It is natural to suppose that people
will not acknowledge and shew parental
fondness for children which are not their
own, and it is unsuspicious, because it

all their liberties and properties are de∣rived.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A subject may be born in a fo∣reign country.</NOTE>The birth of a subject of any state may
happen in a foreign country, or at least
in a distant colony. Great Britain hath
now extended her dominion over a part
of Africa, as well as over many distant

it is therefore of infinite importance
that the children of those who are born
abroad should also have their birthrights
secured to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The law mind∣ful of this.</NOTE>Of this the law hath also been mind∣ful;
for it is a principle in law, that if a
person is acknowledged by two married
persons as their child, and has in his fa∣vour

thereby entitled to the full possession of
his state and birthright, with all its privi∣leges

that this article was neither of his wri∣ting,

presumed that it was of the person who
called himself <HI>Fluratl.</HI>—That <HI>Michelle</HI>'s
<HI>livre du Commissaire</HI> which is brought to
him, commences subsequent to the 1750;
and that he never saw <HI>Michelle</HI>'s <HI>livre du

the article of <HI>Fluratl</HI> appeared to him of

that the deposition of this woman also

2dly, That Sir John Stewart and his
company should be found in them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godefroi's books considered.</NOTE>As to the regularity of these books
upon a careful consideration of them, it
appears, that they are on the contrary
most irregular.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godefroi's books explained.</NOTE>They are of two kinds; a household
book in order to account with the guests,
and a police book in order to show an
exact list of the guests to the inspecteur
of police, who visits all the inns of Paris
by publick authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The apparent irregularity of Godefroi's books.</NOTE>It appears that many people are entered
in the houshold book who are not entered
in the police book: and on the other
hand, that many are entered in the police
book who are not entered in the hous∣hold
book; so that notwithstanding of
that accurate police which our neigh∣bours
would fondly display as one of those
advantages which they enjoy above this
free country, though it may impose upon
superficial people, is indeed but the phan∣tom
of French vanity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The irregularity of Godefroi's books shewn from the oath of his wife.</NOTE>Nay it is acknowledged by Madame

house at night and go away in the morn∣ing
may happen not to be marked down
in any way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purs. Pr. p. 834.</NOTE>. And she has positively
deposed that her house containing fifteen
beds was generally full<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Purs. Pr. p. 833.</NOTE>: yet during the
whole time that Lady Jane and Sir John
are pretended to have been in this inn,
and when Godefroi has positively sworn
that they were lodged in the second story
for want of room, there are only two
persons lodged in this large inn, accord∣ing
to the books, and at no time during
the years 1748 and 1749, can the plain∣tiffs
show from the books that the house
was full.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther proof of the irregularity of Godefroi's books.</NOTE>It is therefore certain that many guests
must have lodged in Godefroi's without
being marked in the book, since it cannot
be presumed that so great a number hap∣pened
all to come at night and go away
in the morning, as Mr. Godefroi's inn is
not like an inn for passengers upon a
great road, but is in the city of Paris, to
which people resort to stay some time;
and at least a third, if not one half of
these people who put up at Godefroi's,
stay with him during their residence at
Paris.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godefroi's books, though regular, could be of no avail, un∣less Sir John Stewart is found in them.</NOTE>But allowing Godefroi's books to be

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The plaintiffs fondly attempt to apply a blank article to Sir John Stewart.</NOTE>In what manner have the plaintiffs

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The new evi∣dence of the plaintiffs incon∣clusive.</NOTE>So turns out the new evidence of the

is to be taken away by such evidence,
the freedom which our forefathers have

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godefroi's tale improbable at first view.</NOTE>The tale told by <HI>Godefroi</HI> is at first

at his inn is three livres or half a crown
English a day for lodging, a bottle of
wine and two meals, viz. dinner and sup∣per;
the price of the wine is twenty four
sous or one shilling English, the price of
the room to those who only sleep and go
away in the morning, is ten sous or five
pence English; therefore there remained
only thirteen pence English for two meals
and attendance through the day. If any
man can believe that Lady Jane Douglas
and Sir John Stewart were served in the
expensive city of Paris, and in their own
apartments, at the miserable rate of thir∣teen
pence each a day, it is what never
happened before, nor will ever happen
again, to any British person whatever,
much less to people of fashion recom∣mended
by the chief magistrate of <HI>Rheims,</HI>
as was the case with Sir John and Lady

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">All the other circumstances the conduct of Sir John and Lacy Jane.</NOTE>All the other circumstances of pre∣sumption

from the conduct of Sir John and lady

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane not now alive to ex∣plain their con∣duct.</NOTE>In considering these it is proper to ob∣serve,
that we are considering the con∣duct
of two persons who are not now
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
alive to explain to us all the motives of it,
nor perhaps, were they alive, would
they be able to recollect all the motives
at this great distance of time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet several of these circum∣stances accounted for very natu∣rally.</NOTE>Yet several pieces of their conduct,
which at first sight appears suspicious,
may be accounted for very naturally.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane's con∣cealment at Pa∣ris accounted for.</NOTE>Their concealment at Paris is one of
the strongest of these circumstances: but
let us remember their situation at that
time. It has been solemnly deposed to
that they were then very poor, we are
therefore bound to believe they were so.
The bill of 1979 livres which Sir John
carried with him from Rheims, was no∣thing
to a man of his character, who was
so dissipated, so profuse, and I will say,
so generous, that upon his receiving a
sum of money, no body could say how
much of it was engaged for debt, or in∣deed,
if half an hour after, a six pence of
it would be in his pocket.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane were anxious to con∣ceal from the duke of Douglas their being at Paris, and this fully explained.</NOTE>As I would not split hairs about every
trifle, which has been the great art of the
plaintiffs, I shall not insist that Sir John
and Lady Jane were in real poverty, but
surely it cannot be denied that they at
the time pretended poverty; for they
wrote to the duke of Douglas in a very
affecting strain upon that head, and they
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
borrowed money from M. Andrieux, at
Rheims, with whom they had then very
little connection. That being the case,
they were anxious to conceal from the
duke their having gone to Paris; for, said
they, the duke will be offended at our
seeming extravagance, and will very rea∣dily
observe, here are two people crying for
want, and yet they have left Rheims and
have taken a foolish journey to Paris. To
send money to such people, would be
like throwing it into a sieve.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore they used so many methods of con∣cealment.</NOTE>Sir John and Lady Jane were thus in a
dilemma. She could give no good reason
for having left Rheims, as there was
very able assistance to be had there for
women with child. She had run off in
a pannick, as women in that situation do
often take most unaccountable pannicks.
She and her husband therefore thought
they had nothing for it but if possible to
keep this journey from the knowledge of
the duke, therefore it was that they lived
in a private manner at Paris: therefore it
was that they dated their letters at
Rheims; therefore it was that Sir John,
though very fond of his countrymen,
prevailed with himself to refrain at this
time from seeing them: And so appre∣hensive
were he and Lady Jane that their
being at Paris should get air, that they
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
did not trust even Johnston, a cousin of
Mrs. Hewit's, with the secret.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other circum∣stances admit of a double inter∣pretation.</NOTE>Other pieces of their conduct will ad∣mit
of a double interpretation, such as
their leaving their maid servants at
Rheims. It may be said that they left
their maids because they did not choose
to make them privy to the shameful plot
which they were carrying on: but on the
other hand, upon the supposition of the
imposture, would they not have taken
these maids as accomplices of the fraud?
If they were accomplices, as the plain∣tiffs
themselves positively affirms, with
respect to Isabel Walker, they certainly
would not leave them at Rheims, when
they could be of so much use to them at
Paris, were it only to have served as wit∣nesses
to the supposed birth. If they
were not accomplices, then they were
both unsuspicious testimonies in behalf
of the defendant; and if their testimony
be true, there is an end of the plaintiff's
plea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The maids being left at Rheims, strongly against the plaintiffs.</NOTE>So that this circumstance of leaving
the maids, is the most unlucky that the
plaintiffs could possibly have selected; nor
can I really see how it is possible for them
to extricate themselves from the difficul∣ties
in which it places them.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leaving the maids difficult to be explained.</NOTE>It must be owned that we cannot ac∣count
for these maids being left, but one
undeniable piece of evidence in this cause
may serve to make us pay little regard to
such circumstances.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leaving the man-servant a circumstance much more suspicious.</NOTE>When Sir John and Lady Jane came
to Liege, in their way to Paris, they left
there their man servant, who was a
Frenchman. This circumstance the
plaintiffs insisted was strongly suspicious,
because they were leaving this French∣man
behind them at the very time when
he could be of most use to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Though Sir John could give no account of this, it is now by good providence clearly explain∣ed.</NOTE>When Sir John Stewart was asked
what was the reason of their leaving this
man-servant, he could give no account of
it whatever; and we should now have
heard it urged as an undeniable circum∣stance
of guilt, had not the wife of this
man by good providence been alive, and
told that her husband was pressed by Sir
John and Lady Jane to go along with
them, and that the reason why he did
not go to France, was his having been a
deserter from that service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore all the other cir∣cumstances might have been explained had they been taken in time.</NOTE>Not one of all the circumstances is so
strong as this which has been so happily
cleared up, and therefore we are to in∣fer
that had they all been enquired into
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
at an earlier period, they would all have
been as plain to us as this now is.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alledged con∣tradictory ac∣counts, by Sir John, Lady Jane, and Mrs. Hewit.</NOTE>Much has been said of contradictory
accounts which have been given by Sir
John, Lady Jane, and Mrs. Hewit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This not true as to any ma∣terial circum∣stance, but one mistake which was soon cor∣rected.</NOTE>In the first place, this is not true as to
any material circumstance except in one
instance: When Sir John was asked the
name of the person in whose house Lady
Jane was brought to bed, which he did
not recollect at the time, and mentioned
Michelle's instead of Le Brun's, which,
however, he corrected in a very short time
after.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their varying in trifles a strong argument against an imposture.</NOTE>Their varying in trifles is rather a
strong argument against an imposture
being committed; for if that had been
the case, a tale would have been con∣certed
and uniformly told: To forget
circumstances, or remember them in va∣rious
ways, is what we commonly ob∣serve
in the course of human life; and I
can appeal to any two of my readers,
who have been present at the same trans∣actions,
and desire them to try, if after
some years have elapsed, they do not va∣ry
in the remembrance of many particu∣lars.
One memory is more distinct and
comprehensive than another, and some
people are apt to confound the ideas sug∣gested
by fancy, with those preserved by
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
memory, as was the case with Sir John
Stewart, and is the case with most peo∣ple
of lively imaginations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John, Lady Jane, and Mrs. Hewit, were all along consistent in the great lines of their story.</NOTE>It is, however, certain, that Sir John,
Lady Jane, and Mrs. Hewit, did all
along give the great lines of their story
with perfect consistency.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection from what Lady Jane is said to have told to the countess of Stair.</NOTE>One objection has been made to this.
It has been said, that Lady Jane told a
very different tale to the countess of Stair,
to whom she said, that she was delivered
immediately on her coming to Paris.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer 1. This alledged by only a single witness.</NOTE>To this it is answered, 1st, That it is
only proved by the oath of the honourable
Mrs. Primrose, who swears that she heard
her mother, the countess of Stair say,
what she heard from Lady Jane; there∣fore,
this is at best but the hear-say of a
hear-say, which is not legal evidence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer 2. This witness certainly in a mistake, shewn from the story itself.</NOTE>But 2dly, It is certain, that from in∣advertency,
from dullness of hearing, or
from a fallacious memory, people who
are equally honest, will give very different
accounts of what they heard in conver∣sation;
and it is evident at first view,
that one of these ladies, either the coun∣tess
of Stair, or Mrs. Primrose, must
have been in a mistake with regard to
Lady Jane's saying that she was delivered
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
immediately upon her arrival in Paris,
which was upon the 4th of July, be∣cause
we find the 10th of July marked in
her pocket-book as the day of her de∣livery;
and upon every occasion she gave
the same account of it. Lady Jane is
allowed by all parties to have been a wo∣man
of sense; it is not therefore credible
that she would give Lady Stair alone a
different account, which numbers from
her own information could contradict.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer 3. Se∣veral persons of good character can depose that this witness is in a mistake.</NOTE>Besides, I am assured that there are
several persons of good character, still
alive, who heard the countess of Stair
tell Mrs. Primrose that she was in a
mistake in supposing that this account
was given her by Lady Jane, for that it
was told to the countess by some other
person.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great clamour about the letters of Pierre La Marre as for∣geries.</NOTE>A great clamour has been raised about
certain letters from <HI>Pierre la Marre,</HI>
which it is said were forged by Sir John
Stewart.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">There was here no forgery, as these letters were never used by Sir John in evidence.</NOTE>In the first place, I deny that there
was here, properly speaking, a forgery.
The essence of a forged deed consists in
the using it in evidence. Whereas, these
letters never were so used by Sir John
Stewart.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The existence of such letters clear∣ly proved.</NOTE>It is proved, that there really did exist
such letters long before the time at which
the plaintiffs alledge that this forgery was
committed, as appears from the private
pocket-book of Lady Jane Douglas, and
from the oaths of several witnesses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Internal evi∣dence, that the letters now char∣ged as forgeries could not be so.</NOTE>From a critical analysis of these let∣ters,
it appears, that though they contain
some phrases of the purest French, they
are, upon the whole, full of Anglicisms,
and miserably spelt; so that it is impos∣sible
to suppose that Sir John could ever
have thought of palming them upon a
court of justice as French letters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John's beha∣viour before the court of session, a confirmation that there was here no forgery.</NOTE>Several probable conjectures have been
made, both by counsel and judges, with
regard to these letters, as may be seen in
the law papers and speeches. That Sir
John never intended a forgery, must be
evident to every impartial person; be∣cause,
upon his examination before the
court of session, when he was asked with
regard to these letters, he looked at them
in his careless manner, and answered with
that easy and unconcerned air which is
the surest sign of conscious innocence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supposing the worst, how far will this go?</NOTE>But should we suppose the worst, and
allow that Sir John did forge these let∣ters,
how far will this go? Truth indeed
does not require the aid of falshood; and
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
it is very foolish, nay very criminal, to
call in falshood in support of truth; yet
many instances of this have occurred, like
the <HI>piae fraudes,</HI> which have been prac∣tised
in support of religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">If there were really a forgery, it is well balan∣ced by Duruis∣seau.</NOTE>At any rate, the plaintiffs attack this
circumstance with a very bad grace, con∣sidering
what their conduct has been; for
if this were a forgery, it would surely be
well balanced by the attempt made to
forge the contents of <HI>Michelle</HI>'s book by
the false oath of <HI>Duruisseau.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A forgery could only shew, that Sir John's anxi∣ety made him take an impro∣per step.</NOTE>Allowing the plaintiffs unworthy sup∣position
to be true, it can go no farther
than to shew, that Sir John Stewart's
anxiety to preserve his son made him
take a very improper step.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane's ne∣glect of disprov∣ing the calum∣nies against them.</NOTE>The last circumstance of conduct which
has been vehemently urged in this cause,
is the neglect shewn by Sir John and La∣dy
Jane of the reports which were raised
of their having been guilty of imposing
upon the world supposititious children,
and also their neglect of bringing unde∣niable
evidence of the truth of the birth,
which, it is said, they might easily have
done, had the birth been real.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">These calumnies raised in the most shameful manner.</NOTE>In answer to this, let it be considered,
that these reports were raised in the most
shameful and malicious manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane dis∣dained these ca∣lumnies.</NOTE>Sir John Stewart and Lady Jane Dou∣glas
were high-minded people, and dis∣dained
such calumnies, as they had a con∣tempt
for the authors of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A striking proof of this.</NOTE>A strong proof of this, and which
strikes one exceedingly, is, that in the
private correspondence of Sir John and
Lady Jane, which was never intended
for the public view, but has been most
accidentally recovered, they never once
mention these injurious suspicions, which
shews how little they were really affected
by them; for, upon truly generous minds,
undeserved calumnies will make no im∣pression.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane went to Douglas castle to ask what proof would be necessary.</NOTE>Besides, Lady Jane had gone to Dou∣glas
castle with intention to ask her bro∣ther
the Duke, what proof would satisfy
him that the children, which she had
with her, were really hers; but her re∣lentless
enemies surrounded the Duke,
and prevented her having access to him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane saw that it was in vsin to bring any proof.</NOTE>This being the case, to what purpose
bring proofs? As Douglas castle was be∣set
with dragons, these proofs could have
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
been of no service to her. Had she pro∣duced
letters both from <HI>Pierre La Marre</HI>
and <HI>Madame Le Brun,</HI> it would have
been said that they were forged. Nay,
had <HI>Pierre La Marre</HI> and <HI>Madame Le
Brun</HI> themselves been brought to Dou∣glas
castle, to swear to the truth of the
birth, it would have been said that they
were accomplices, and perjuring them∣selves
to support a falsehood; for we
have lived to see such accusations laid
against people infinitely less suspicious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This demon∣strated.</NOTE>What then was Lady Jane to do?
People of undoubted credit and character
had attested her pregnancy, and Mrs.
Hewit was then alive, and affirmed she
was present at the delivery. If they were
not to be believed, would obscure people
be believed with regard to her delivery?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane con∣sults the Lord Advocate for Scotland.</NOTE>But my Lady Jane did more. She

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane had no occasion whatever to bring proofs.</NOTE>We are not therefore to wonder that
Sir John and Lady Jane neglected to bring
all the proof they might have done with
regard to the birth of their children.
The only view they could have in doing
so, was to satisfy the Duke of Douglas,
which they had the mortification to see
was impossible. They had the opinion
of counsel learned in the law, that their
children were already in possession of a
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
proof sufficient to entitle them to all the
privileges of British subjects; and as they
themselves knew the truth, so all those
whose good opinion they were anxious
to preserve, were firmly persuaded of their
honour, and of the legitimacy of their
children.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At any rate, no∣thing more can possibly be in∣ferred, but that they had such an imprudence as is usual among mankind.</NOTE>If, after all, it shall be thought that
Sir John and Lady Jane did not here act
the most prudent part. I answer, that
prudence was none of their virtues: but
I will go farther, and say, that prudence
is a very bad test of the credibility of the
actions of men. If no conduct is be∣lieved
but what is consistent with the
rules of prudence, the history of human
life may be comprehended within very
narrow bounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The imprudence of human con∣duct exemplified in a wonderful manner.</NOTE>I need not go far for an instance of
this. The tutors of the Duke of Hamil∣ton
and his brother are mostly persons of
great respect, as well as knowledge of
business. From such tutors one would
expect very accurate proceedings, and
that they would do the very best and most
prudent things for the interest of their
pupils.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke Hamil∣ton's tutors be∣gin this expen∣sive process, when it is pro∣bable his Grace shall never get a shilling in re∣turn.</NOTE>But what has been their conduct in
this process? Why, after the court of

<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
had no right to the estate of Dou∣glas,
but that it must descend to the
heirs of line, these tutors, in place of
appealing that judgment, so as to have
their pupil's interest finally ascertained,
have been pleased to carry on a tedious
law-suit against Mr. Douglas, and have
laid out immense sums of Duke Hamil∣ton's
money, when, in all probability,
his Grace shall never get a shilling in re∣turn,
and his brother, Lord Douglas,
shall be cut out of a chance which he had
of succeeding to the Douglas estate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke Hamil∣ton's tutors au∣thorize the Tournelle pro∣cess and Moni∣toire.</NOTE>These tutors also authorized the <HI>Tour∣nelle</HI>

person is now convinced how very
bad a cause these plaintiffs have been dis∣guising,
with all the art that money can
purchase.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the plain∣tiffs would have us believe.</NOTE>Let us shortly consider what they
would have us believe..</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Lady Jane Douglas should all at once become totally abandoned.</NOTE>It is this, That the sister of the Duke
of Douglas, a lady of a distinguished good
character, who, it is certain, was then
in the way of having children herself,
should all at once have become so aban∣doned
as to enter into a plot to perpe∣trate
the most villainous imposition upon
the illustrious house from whence she
sprung.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That Lady Jane and her hus∣band should buy a subject of the French king, at the risk of dreadful punish∣ments.</NOTE>That having entered into this plot, she
and her husband went to Paris, and there
run the risk of buying a subject of the
French king, when they knew to what
dreadful punishments their doing so sub∣jected
them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That they should do this in the most dangerous manner.</NOTE>When they go about this, they take a
recommendation from the chief magi∣strate
of Rheims to the inn at Paris, where
all the people from Rheims put up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That they should deliberately re∣main 16 months exposed to detec∣tion, and all its dismal conse∣quences.</NOTE>Instead of flying the kingdom after
they had perpetrated so dangerous a
crime, they stay above a month in Paris
and the neighbourhood, and they return
to Rheims, and remain there sixteen
months; during all which time, they
were liable to detection, to a capital pu∣nishment,
to torture, and to absolute in∣famy
and disgrace.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="65"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">That they should give out that they had two children, when they had only one.</NOTE>They give it out that they had twins,
when one child was sufficient for their
purpose. And they give out that the
youngest twin was a weakly delicate
child, though they had then only one
child in their possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That they should again run the same desperare risque, and when they were in the greatest poverty, should bring up∣on themselves the burden of two children.</NOTE>The next year they go back again to
Paris; they again run the same desperate
risque; and pick up a second child. And
when they were in such poverty that for
many months they were obliged to burn and
sell the lace off their cloaths, in order to
procure themselves subsistence; at this
very time they chose to take the burden
of no less than two children belonging to
other people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That this second child, picked up by chance, should answer exactly to the description gi∣ven 16 month, before he was seen, and that he should be the very picture of Lady Jane.</NOTE>What was, if possible, still more won∣derful,
this second weakly child, which
they picked up by mere chance, answer∣ed
exactly to the description which they
had given of Sholto, then youngest son,
for sixteen months before, and was the
very picture of Lady Jane; so that not a
person who ever saw them together, but
was struck with their remarkable likeness,
as is proved by the oath of the Right
honourable Mr. Stewart M`Kenzie, Lord
Privy Seal for Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purs. Pr. p. 377.</NOTE> as well as the
oaths of many other respectable witnesses.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such being the plaintiffs proof, what can be the result of it?</NOTE>Such being the plaintiffs proof in the
Douglas cause, I desire every impartial
man in these kingdoms to say, if he
can consistently with reason, not to men∣tion
charity, take upon him to pronounce
a sentence, finding Sir John Stewart, and
Lady Jane Douglas guilty of an infa∣mous
imposition; and declaring Archi∣bald
Douglas Esquire to be the son of a
French glass-grinder?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">So strong is the cause of Douglas, even without his additional proof.</NOTE>So strong is the cause of Douglas,
when we have considered only his filiation
as established by the acknowlegement of
his parents, and common fame, opposed
to those vague and inconclusive proofs
which the plaintiffs, with all their op∣pressive
proceedings, have been able to
bring against him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part IV. But Mr. Doug∣las has brought a positive proof both direct and circumstantial.</NOTE>But what shall we say, if, besides all
this, Mr. Douglas can produce a chain
of positive evidence, amazingly strong,
at this distance of time? He has done so.
Though his parents did not make enqui∣ries
at Paris, he has; and these enquiries
have produced a proof both direct and
circumstantial in his favour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The direct proof brought by Mr. Douglas.</NOTE>The direct proof is that of the actual
birth, and of what must have necessarily
preceded and followed it; viz. the preg∣nancy,
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
and the reconvalescence of reco∣very.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John Stew∣art and Mrs. Hewit swear to the actual deli∣very.</NOTE>With regard to the actual delivery,
there are two witnesses who swear to it;
viz. Sir John Stewart, and Mrs. Hewit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection to Sir John Stewart.</NOTE>It may be objected to Sir John, that
his near connection to the defendant, ren∣ders
him a suspicious witness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE>To this it is answered, that he is a
witness called by the plaintiffs them∣selves,
and therefore they cannot now
pretend to reject his evidence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection to Mrs. Hewit.</NOTE>It may be objected to Mrs. Hewit,
that she is also a suspicious witness, as be∣ing
an attendant or domestick of Lady
Jane Douglas.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE>If this objection were to hold good,
the defendant, and all who shall ever be
in his situation, must be deprived of al∣most
the only witnesses who can be ex∣pected
to be present at a fact of this kind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection to both Sir John and Mrs. Hewit.</NOTE>It may be objected to both Sir John
and Mrs Hewit, that their evidence
ought not to be received, because they
are accomplices in the crime charged in
the present action.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The answer to this, of serious and universal importance.</NOTE>To this it is answered, that not only
in law and equity, but in the universal
judgement of mankind, innocence is al∣ways
presumed; nor are witnesses to be
rejected, as accomplices of a crime, when
proof is required, to shew that a crime
has been committed. If the objection
were good against two witnesses, it might
be good against any number against
whom a charge may be brought, in the
same manner as has been brought against
Sir John, and Mrs. Hewit; so that law,
instead of being our guardian, would sternly arm herself against her subjects,
and render it impossible for any birth ever
to be proved. But law is not so.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore two positive witness∣es to the actual delivery.</NOTE>Therefore, to every impartial man in
these kingdoms, there are two positive
witnesses to the actual delivery of Lady
Jane Douglas.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane's pregnancy strongly proved.</NOTE>The pregnancy of Lady Jane is proved
by Mrs. Hepburn, of Keith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 9.</NOTE> Mrs.
Glass,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 18. Purs. Pr. p. 50.</NOTE> and a variety of other witnesses,
who solemnly depose to circumstances;
all which together, could not exist with∣out
a real pregnancy. At least, if they
do ever so exist, it is not above once in a
million of times. Bountiful nature does
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
not leave us in such a state of uncertainty,
with regard to what interests us so much.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Corroboration of the proof of La∣dy Jane's preg∣nancy.</NOTE>This proof of Lady Jane's pregnancy,
becomes exceedingly strong, when it is
clearly proved, that after the time at
which she gave out that she was delivered,
she had all the appearances of a woman
newly recovered from childbed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The positive proof of Lady Jane's delivery confirmed by different appear∣ances.</NOTE>Let us lay together the different ap∣pearances
of Lady Jane, before and after
the period at which her delivery is said to
have happened; and then judge if any
doubt can be entertained of her delivery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">These appear∣ances could not possibly be as∣sumed.</NOTE>It is material to observe, that these ap∣pearances
could not possibly be assumed
by dress, or by any other art; because I
am now to insist only upon such as must
be allowed to have been the real appear∣ances
of her person.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane's ap∣pearance before the time when she is said to have been deli∣vered.</NOTE>Before the period at which she is said
to have been delivered, she appeared with
very large breasts, and a countenance
such as she usually had when in health.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 9. ib. p. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane's ap∣pearance after the time she is said to have been delivered.</NOTE>After the period at which she is said to
have been delivered, she appeared with
very flat breasts, and a countenance thin,
pale, and languid.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Purs. Pr. p. 868. ib. p. 876.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">These different appearances could not be without some intermediate ill∣ness.</NOTE>Now I desire to know of every person
of experience, and of every sensible phy∣sician,
if Lady Jane could possibly have
had these different appearances without
some intermediate illness?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This intermedi∣ate illness child∣birth.</NOTE>If Lady Jane had an intermediate ill∣ness,
why shall we doubt that it was
childbirth, as solemnly deposed by two
witnesses?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The circumstan∣tial proof brought by Mr. Douglas.</NOTE>The circumstantial proof, in confirm∣ation
of the direct proof now stated; is
exceedingly strong, unless we can sup∣pose
a number of witnesses, having no
knowlege or acquaintance one with ano∣ther,
all combining different facts and
circumstances, so as to make one con∣nected
story.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monfieur Me∣nager's circum∣stantial proof.</NOTE>In the first place, Monsieur Menager,
surgeon to a prince of the blood, at Paris,
who is proved by other witnesses to have
been the most intimate acquaintance of
Pierre La Marre, deposes, that La Marre
told him, that he had delivered a foreign
Lady of an advanced age, who came from
Rheims; that it was her first birth; that
he had delivered her of twins, and of
male twins, one of which was a sickly
delicate child, which on that account was
left with La Marre, and was by him
given out to nurse in the neighbourhood
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
of Paris.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 526, <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE> All these circumstances, so
directly correspond with the defendants
story, that it is impossible they can be
true, and his story false.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The plaintiffs obliged to resort to their usual desperate argu∣ment that Mon∣sieur Menager is perjured.</NOTE>The plaintiffs therefore are obliged to
have recourse to their usual desperate ar∣gument
of representing Monsieur Mena∣ger
as a man grossly perjured.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur Me∣nager acciden∣tally discovered by those acting for the defen∣dant.</NOTE>That this matter may be fairly tried,
it must be considered, that Monsieur
Menager was accidentally discovered by
those employed by the defendant. It was
from the prince of <HI>Turenne</HI> himself, that
the information was received.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 541.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur Mena∣ger is a man of good station and character.</NOTE>Monsieur Menager is a man of good
station and character, so does not deserve
to be suspected without good reason.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gentlemen employed for Mr. Douglas, are liable to no suspicion.</NOTE>When Monsieur Menager was disco∣vered,
the affairs of Mr. Douglas were
entirely in the hands of gentlemen sent
from Britain. There were no French
<HI>Procureurs,</HI> whose wicked proceedings
we have seen. And the behaviour of
the gentlemen sent from Britain, on the
part of Mr. Douglas, has been such,
that they surely have not subjected them∣selves
to any injurious imputation.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur Mena¦ger a good wit∣ness.</NOTE>Therefore it follows that <HI>Monsieur Me∣nager</HI>
must by every impartial person be
held as a good witness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection to Monsieur Mena¦ger.</NOTE>The only objection therefore to <HI>Mon∣sieur
Menager</HI>'s evidence, is, that he is
single.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE>Were it really so, it were hard from
thence to infer that he is perjured, or that
a single witness in a circumstantial proof
is not to be believed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur Mena∣ger is supported by Mr. Gilles.</NOTE>But he is not a single witness, for <HI>M.
Gilles</HI> must be held as a concurring wit∣ness
to the same facts; for I hold him to
the unsuspicious testimony that he gave
in presence of Monsieur Moreau, which
he could have no temptation to give, so
that we have in reality two witnesses to
these striking facts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur Mena∣ger is supported by other wit∣nesses.</NOTE>But <HI>Monsieur Menager</HI> is not supported
by <HI>Gilles</HI> alone, for there are other wit∣nesses
who depose to a variety of circum∣stances;
all of which wonderfully concur
in supporting the story of <HI>Monsieur Me∣nager,</HI>
and of consequence supporting the
story of the defendant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Witnesses who support Monsieur Menager.</NOTE>These other witnesses are a woman of
the name of <HI>Garnier,</HI> a nurse in the
neighbourhood of <HI>Paris,</HI> the husband of
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
this <HI>Garnier,</HI> and <HI>Madame Boucault,</HI> her
neighbour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deposition of nurse Garnier in support of Mon∣sieur Menager.</NOTE><HI>Garnier</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 533. et seq.</NOTE> has deposed that in summer
1748, while she was living on the road
to <HI>Menilmontain,</HI> she got from this very
<HI>Pierre la Marre,</HI> the friend of <HI>Menager,</HI>
a weak delicate child who was a male
twin, and his brother also a male, that
he was a foreign child, and was visited
by foreign gentlemen, one of whom ex∣pressed
such a concern about him that she
supposed he was the father, and at last
at the end of eighteen months, or there∣abouts,
this child was taken from her
not to be given to another nurse at Paris,
but to be carried further off. In short
the account given of this child agrees so
exactly to Sholto that it is impossible to
suppose it could be any other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The plaintiffs here again re∣duced to their desperate expe∣dient of an accu∣sation of perjury.</NOTE>Therefore the plaintiffs are here again
reduced to the desperate expedient of
supposing this woman to be perjured and
corrupted, though like <HI>Menager</HI> she was
accidentally discovered by those acting
for Mr. Douglas, never was tampered
with by a <HI>Danjou,</HI> or any other French
agent, and in short was never in the hands
of any body but the gentlemen sent from
Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confirmation of the evidence of Menager and Garnier by other unsuspicious witnesses.</NOTE>But it will not answer the plaintiffs
purpose to say that this poor woman is
perjured; they must further add to their
black list her husband<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 558.</NOTE>, and also her
neighbour Madame Boucault<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Def. Pr. p. 559. et seq.</NOTE>, for she
concurs with her in every particular, and
some things she has remembered more
accurately than Garnier; for she has said
that the child was kept only sixteen
months which was just the precise time;
and she has described one of the stranger
gentlemen that came to see the child in
such a way that there is little reason to
doubt but that it must have been Sir John
Stewart.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The wonderful strength of the defendant's cir∣cumstantial evi∣dence at this distance of time.</NOTE>Now the fact being thus established,
beyond all possibility of doubt, that there
was a weak twin foreign child given out
to nurse near Menilmontain by Pierre La
Marre, in the year 1748, and that the
story told by Lady Jane and Sir John,
and the story told by Monsieur Menager,
exactly tally in this story, it appears that
there is here a chain of circumstantial
evidence which no art or force of argu∣ment
can break; nay, were that link of
the chain which has been formed by Me∣nager,
or that link which is formed by
Garnier, and the evidences concurring
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
with her to be taken separately, and
compared with the story told by Sir John
and Lady Jane, there would be in either
case a proof wonderfully strong at this
distance of time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is impossible that so many circumstances should concur, and the story of the defendant not be true.</NOTE>Is it possible to believe that all these
circumstances should concur, and yet that
the story of the defendant should not be
true?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection that M. Menager's La Marre is not the same with Sir John's La Marre.</NOTE>It has been objected by the plaintiffs,
that this <HI>Pierre La Marre</HI> cannot be the
same person mentioned by Sir John Stew∣art,
in his declaration before the court of
session, because in several particulars he
is proved to be very different from Sir
John's <HI>La Marre.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The alledged differences shewn to be of small importance.</NOTE>In answer to this, it must be observed,
that the differences insisted on, are in
reality of little importance. One of them
is, that Sir John's <HI>accoucheur</HI> was called
only <HI>Pierre La Marre,</HI> whereas <HI>Monsieur
Menager</HI>'s friend was called <HI>Louis Pierre
De la Marre.</HI> This is no more but that
<HI>M. La Marre,</HI> from an affectation of
gentility very common in France, chose
to put <HI>De</HI> before his sirname, which
however he usually dropt in familiar in∣tercourse
or in subscribing letters; for his
contract of marriage produced by the
plaintiffs being a formal deed, is no proof
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
of the manner in which he signed his
letters. His being called <HI>Louis</HI> as well as
<HI>Pierre,</HI> must appear a very frivolous ob∣jection;
for we all know that people
who have two names in this manner,
often sink one of them. It has been said
too, that Sir John's <HI>La Marre</HI> was a
<HI>Walloon,</HI> whereas <HI>Menager</HI>'s <HI>La Marre</HI>
is a Frenchman. But the answer is, that
<HI>Menager</HI>'s <HI>La Marre</HI> was born at <HI>Mon∣treuil
sur mer,</HI> upon the borders of the
<HI>Walloon</HI> country, and thence was readily
taken for a <HI>Walloon.</HI> In short the only
variation of any consequence is that Sir
John has said that he fell acquainted with
<HI>La Marre</HI> at so early a period that it
could not be the friend of <HI>Menager.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John Stew∣art's declaration candidly consi∣dered.</NOTE>In answer to this, let the candid and
unprejudiced consider that Sir John Stew∣art
was all his life long a man of vivacity
and dissipation, and was particularly re∣markable
for a strange incorrect memory,
as is proved by the oath of that worthy
gentleman Mr. Hepburn of Keith, who
knew him intimately, and who swears to
most extraordinary instances of his for∣getfulness
when it cannot possibly be said
that he had any design; and therefore
there is no wonder that a man of this
singular frame of mind, who had been
abroad at several different times, should
be in a mistake in fancying a thing to
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
have happened much earlier than it really
did, especially when it is considered that
when Sir John was obliged to make this
judicial declaration he was very old, be∣ing
in his 74th year, and in such an
infirm state of health, that he was brought
into court from his bed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Evidence which speaks home to our hearts.</NOTE>It remains to consider another kind of
evidence in behalf of Mr. Douglas; and
I am persuaded that this evidence will
speak home to the hearts of the impartial
people of these kingdoms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John and Lady Jane shew∣ed a constant af∣fection and con∣cern for their children.</NOTE>Sir John and Lady Jane, during the
whole course of their lives, shewed the
greatest affection and concern for these
children, and this in no ostentatious
manner; for the most striking instances
of it were accidentally observed.</P>
<P>A very material question was put by a
judge of the court of session to Isabel Wal∣ker,
one of Lady Jane's maids, <Q REND="inline">Did
you ever observe Sir John or Lady
Jane repine at the expence of these
children, or betray any sign as if they
were not their own?</Q> <Q REND="inline">Oh! no,</Q>
replied the witness, with an air which
convinced every unprejudiced person how
much she spoke from the heart. She
added, that they at all times shewed an
uniform fondness for their children, even
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
when they themselves were in the greatest
poverty and distress.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The affecting letters between Sir John and Lady Jane an in∣vincible proof to every humane mind.</NOTE>But if we should even suppose them to
be so consummately cool and artful as to
persist for a series of years in the deepest
dissimulation, and that too before a maid
who was constantly with them, and saw
them in their most unguarded moments,
what shall we say when we read these
letters, now accidentally recovered, and
never intended for the view of any other
person; these letters, written while Sir
John was in prison, and while Lady Jane
was in straits and in sickness? Is it pos∣sible
to suppose, that these letters, writ∣ten
in so noble a stile of piety, and ex∣pressing
such warm sentiments of tender∣ness
and love for their children; is it pos∣sible
to suppose, that these letters were
also dictated by dissimulation?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The letters as strong as if Sir John and Lady Jane had been overheard talk∣ing together in their most pri∣vate moments.</NOTE>I entreat my readers may peruse these
moving letters, and I know how their
honest breasts will feel for much injured
innocence. In reading that correspon∣dence,
it is just as if two alledged confe∣derates
in a crime were overheard talking
together in the very next room; and
when we hear them breathing such strains
of truth, shall we not believe them?
Nay, it is as if we saw into the very
bottom or their hearts; and what do we
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
find there but the sincerest parental af∣fection?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dying de∣clarations of Sir John, Lady Jane, and Mrs. Hewit.</NOTE>Lastly, We have Lady Jane Douglas,
Sir John Stewart, and Mrs. Hewit, who
have all three gone to death, solemnly
attesting the truth of the defendant's
birth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dying declarati∣ons are stronger than circum∣stantial poofs.</NOTE>I do maintain, that these dying decla∣rations
alone, would be sufficient to
counterbalance all the circumstantial
proof which has been brought by the
plaintiffs, allowing it all to bear faith in
judgement. One witness upon the brink
of eternity positively attesting a fact, must
to every humane mind, be of more avail,
than many circumstances which seeming∣ly
tend to prove the contrary. In the
present case, such circumstances are op∣posed
by no less than three witnesses on
the brink of eternity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusion, warmly address'd to the impartial people of these kingdoms.</NOTE>Thus have I pleaded the cause of Mr.
Douglas to the best of my abilities. I
have examined the proof brought against
him; and I hope I have shewn it to be to∣tally
inconclusive, while I have also shewn
an amazing weight of evidence in his fa∣vour,
considering the distance of time.
Providence indeed has preserved more
proofs than could have been expected, in
order to defeat the designs of unjust re∣venge.
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
But I desire and call upon my
readers, to remember, that this cause
might be decided on conduct alone. Per∣jury,
and subornation of perjury, must
be considered as interwoven with every
page of the plaintiffs French proofs;
otherwise I must boldly say, that Mr.
Douglas has not a fair trial. This alarm∣ing
cause is now far advanced. The feel∣ings
of indignation and of humanity are
equally roused. I leave then the DOUG∣LAS

<HEAD>SOME
OBSERVATIONS
ON A
PAMPHLET LATELY PUBLISHED,
INTITLED,
CONSIDERATIONS
ON THE
DOUGLAS CAUSE.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="82"/>SOME
OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPON seeing in the news papers of
Saturday last, that <HI>Considerations on
the Douglas Cause</HI> were that day published,
and as I had read the proofs and memorials
on that singularly important question, I
immediately sent for these Considerations, in
order that I might see every thing which
should be published upon a cause which has
now for years ingrossed the attention of al∣most
every person in the united kingdom,
as well as in other countries. In the be∣ginning
of these Considerations, we are told
that they are composed by a person, <HI>no law∣yer,</HI>
and <HI>disconnected</HI> with both parties,
whose friends are pretty equally divided in
their wishes; that it is a question of fact;
and that he had often served on juries, who
are by the laws of Scotland allowed to judge
<PB N="2" REF="83"/>
in matters of fact. From this preamble, I
imagined that the observations of such a person
would contain nothing in favour of either
party, but what was founded in the proof;
and that however far the keenness of parties
might dispose them to carry their respective
arguments, an impartial unconnected jury∣man
would consider facts in their true light,
divested of all art and false colouring. But
how great was my surprize, when instead
of this I found in the very next page an
insinuation, That of the seven judges who
gave their opinions for the defender in Scot∣land,
two had been his council and agents,
two appointed his guardians, and a fifth had
such connections with the defender as had
induced him to decline judging in the pre∣liminary
steps of the cause. The plain mean∣ing
of this insinuation is to convey an idea
as if only two of these seven judges were to
be considered as disconnected with the de∣fender:
Whereas, on the other side, only
two of the judges which remained, had the
least connection with the pursuers, by
having been of their council. The fact,
however, is, that three of these eight judges
had been the pursuers council in the law-suits
betwixt duke Hamilton and Mr. Douglas,
and that some of them and several others,
are nearly connected with those who expect
to be heirs of the duke of Douglas, failing
the defender; whereas none of the seven jud∣ges
<PB N="3" REF="84"/>
who gave their opinions for the defender,
have the most distant connection with him.</P>
<P>In the next place, this impartial jury∣man,
who by the bye, is clearly some
hireling employed by the pursuers, (and
who has only assumed the title of a discon∣nected
person, that his Considerations may
have the greater appearance of impartiality)
goes on to inform, that he begun the exa∣mination
of the proofs and memorials with
diffidence; that he believed it an intricate
cause from the division among the judges;
and that he was careful lest he should go
wrong, as seven, or perhaps eight of the
judges in Scotland had done; but that great
was his astonishment on finding the cause
perfectly clear against the defender. He then
goes on to give his reasons for being of this
opinion, some of the most material of which I
shall shortly touch upon, and shew that they
are clearly false, and no other than an abridge∣ment
of the artificial arguments contained
in the plaintiff's memorial.</P>
<P>The first is, that Lady Jane before leaving
Aix la Chapelle, in a letter to Mr. Hal∣dene,
gave a false account of her destina∣tion,
which was prudent, if a fraud was
intended, because otherwise she might have
been watched. That she declined staying
at Liege, and left Rheims upon the false
pretence of want of proper assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="85"/>
It is not true that ever Lady Jane con∣cealed
or gave a false account of her destina∣tion
on leaving Aix—for some time, it is
perfectly clear she intended to have gone to
Geneva, and there after changed her mind;
when she did so, she made no secret of the
place of her destination, told the whole cir∣cle
of her acquaintance at Aix that she was
going to Rheims, pressed Lady Wigton
come and live with her there, and caused
to write to a person to take a house for her.
She mentioned it to her whole acquaintances
at Liege, at which place she could not possibly
stay, as it is the most disagreeable place in
Germany, and she had by this time given
orders to take a house for her at Rheims.
Immediately on her arrival at Rheims,
she wrote to every person with whom she
had occasion to correspond, and even invited
Lord Crawford to come and visit them there.
That after she had staid some time at
Rheims, she was advised to go to Paris,
on account of the unskilfulness of Accou∣cheurs
at Rheims, is also clearly in proof,
and not the vestige of evidence to the con∣trary;
so that this very suspicious circum∣stance
is false from beginning to end.</P>
<P>This juryman next says, that so far were
they on leaving Rheims from acquainting
Mr. Mailfer of the motives of their journey
<PB N="5" REF="86"/>
to Paris, that they tell him, that the object
of their journey was to make purchases.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary that a person
should tell an absolute untruth in an affair
of this serious nature. Sir John never told
Mr. Mailfer that his business to Paris was to
make purchases, nor does Mr. Mailfer say so
in any part of the letter to Godfrey; and if
Mailfer had said it, which he does not, it
would have been absurd from hence to have
argued that the motive of the journey was
concealed, as it is clearly in proof that it
was known to the whole town of Rheims.</P>
<P>Again it is said, that Lady Jane avoided
giving any detail of what past in Paris, and
never was heard to mention any particular
relative to the birth of her sons; only that
on being pressed by Lady Stair, she said she
had been delivered within two or three
hours of her arrival at Paris,—but that the
scrutiny which has been since made, obliges
the defender to give up this account of Lady
Jane's.</P>
<P>This again is absolutely false, and con∣trary
to clear evidence. Lady Jane did, in
her own life time, mention all the circum∣stances
of her delivery, the time when, the
person in whose house, and the Accoucheur
by whom. The evidence of Lady Jane's
<PB N="6" REF="87"/>
having said she was delivered within two or
three hours of her arrival in Paris, is of a very
singular nature. The hearsay of a hearsay
from Lady Stair, then almost 80 years of
age, and remarkably deaf, sworn to by her
daughter, Mrs. Primrose, at the distance of
many years; and who, at the time of
giving her oath, is above 60 years of age.
This very witness too has, from want of
memory, sworn sundry things which are
not true, and clearly disproved; consequent∣ly
this part of her oath is not very much to
be depended upon, and is also contradicted
by positive testimony. It is an absolute un∣truth,
that the defender is forced out of
this account given by Lady Jane, by the
scrutiny since made. At the defender's ser∣vice,
when no scrutiny had been made, the
time, the place, and every circumstance of the
birth was mentioned, in the same manner as
at present. If Mrs. Hewit had said at the
service, that Lady Jane had been brought
to bed in three hours after her arrival at Pa∣ris;
and it had now been insisted, it was
six days after, what this impartial Scotch
jury-man says, would have been true; but as
it is otherwise, it is an absolute falshood.</P>
<P>He next says, Sir John's examination was
taken in presence of the Lords, with great
deliberation, and lasted three days; and
yet that the defender wants to reject it as
<PB N="7" REF="88"/>
false in every article; and to substitute ano∣ther
La Marre, in place of Sir John's La
Marre, with the aid of one Mr. Menager,
who deposes to a delivery performed by La
Marre; but which cannot be that of Lady
Jane, as it happened in the year 1746.</P>
<P>This is as unfair as any of his former
observations. The defender never has, so
far as I can observe from his memorial, re∣jected
any one part of Sir John's declaration
as false; he has owned, that from his great
age, then 74 years, and sickly state,
having been raised out of bed to attend the
court of session, he had fallen into some in∣considerable
mistakes, in answering questi∣ons
as to facts, which happened sixteen
years before. I see it is asserted, and not
denied, that he behaved on that occasion,
with uncommon ease and unconcern, which
would have been impossible if he had been
guilty of the crime this Jury-man supposes;
and so far as I can observe from the printed
speeches of the judges, none of them have
insinuated, that he did not behave on that
occasion, in the most proper manner. As
to the delivery mentioned by Mr. Menager,
having happened in the year 1746, this is
clearly not true, as there is the most unde∣niable
evidence of its having happened sub∣sequent
to La Marre's marriage, which was
in the 1747, and in summer 1748, when he
<PB N="8" REF="89"/>
gave out Sholto to be nursed upon the milk
of a woman near Paris, whose child was
born in March 1748.</P>
<P>It is next said, that the only time Sir
John mentioned real persons, was in a note
to Mrs. Napier, in the year 1756, when
he mentioned Michelle's as the place of de∣livery,
imagining that that family would,
by that time, at the distance of 8 years,
have been dead; but finding that they had
been found out, he shifted the scene, and
placed it in the house of the ideal Madame
Le Brun, who was then mentioned for the
first time.</P>
<P>This too is as untrue as any of his for∣mer
observations. Sir John mentioned one
landlady in place of another, by mere unin∣tended
mistake. La Brun's had been men∣tioned
in Lady Jane's life time, as the place
of her delivery, so that it was not on the Mi∣chelle
family being found out, and denying
that the delivery happened in their house that
she was first mentioned. And the result of
the enquiries by Principal Gordon, never was
communicated to Sir John, consequently he
could not vary the place, on being inform∣ed
of that enquiry.</P>
<P>He next says, that if a Scotch Lady of
quality had been really delivered of twins
<PB N="9" REF="90"/>
in the house of Le Brun, and by a La Marre,
their whole friends, acquaintances, and
neighbours, would have heard of it; and
that every person in whose house they ever
lodged abroad, remember them; and that
every other person, except La Marre, and Le
Brun, these precious people, as they are
called, have been found.</P>
<P>To this it is, in the first place, to be no∣ticed,
that the only title Lady Jane took,
either at Paris or at Rheims, was that of
Madame Stewart, and that the wife of the
meanest person in France is called Madame;
such as the noted Madame Mignion, Ma∣dame
Sanry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who are common beg∣gars;
so that her being a lady of quality
was not so much as known, and the de∣livery
of a lady of twins was surely no ex∣traordinary
affair. And it is not true, that
every person with whom they lodged, ex∣cept
Le Brun, has been found. The land∣ladies
at Sedan are not found out. The per∣son
in whose house they lived after leaving
Godefroi's, and before entering to Michelle's,
has not been found out; and the nurse
brought to Michelle's, as well as Sir John's
servant Quibil, one of Godefroi's servants,
and several persons of this very name of Le
Brun, who at that time had houses in Paris,
are not found out; all of whom are admit∣ted
<PB N="10" REF="91"/>
to have existed: and there is the clear∣est
evidence possible of La Mar's existence,
and of his death; of his having brought
Lady Jane to bed, and told it to sundry of
his acquaintances.</P>
<P>The Juryman then says, that they ar∣rived
at Godefroi's on the 4th, where they
are proved by his books and oath to have
remained till the 14th; he does not say
where they were from the 14th to the 18th,
when he says they arrived at Michelle's;
that therefore Lady Jane could not have
been delivered on the 10th of July in Le
Brun's; and Mrs. Hewit has been guilty of
wilful perjury in saying Lady Jane remained
in childbed nine days. And this being the
case, what credit, says he, can be given to
any thing she or Sir John can say?</P>
<P>I have considered the evidence of this
man Godefroi, and of his books, with as
much attention, and with much less partia∣lity,
than this Juryman; and I confess I
never saw such a burlesque upon evidence.
An inn-keeper swearing at the distance of
eighteen years to the particular days of the
week and month when a person or company
entered to his house, what rooms they oc∣cupied,
and how many days they staid, is
such a memory as never was heard of before.
<PB N="11" REF="92"/>
There are no such persons as Lady Jane and
Sir John in his whole books in July 1748,
so that the books can never be of the least
avail. There are indeed some arguments in
the pursuers memorial, to shew that a blank
account in this man's book must apply to
Sir John; but this appears to me absolutely
chimerical: so it is unnecessary, and indeed
I have not time, to answer them.—It is not
true, nor indeed is there the shadow of evi∣dence,
that they arrived at Michelle's on
the 18th, or sooner than the 19th at night,
or 20th July. But as the pursuers in their
memorial have said so, this impartial, dis∣interested,
and judicious Juryman, takes it
for granted, though contrary to the clearest
evidence, if he had taken the trouble to
look at it.</P>
<P>He next goes on to mention the enleve∣ment
of a child from one Mignion, and
says, that when he was given away, <HI>his
mother insisted upon leaving her own swadling-cloaths,
of a coarse kind of blanket</HI>; <HI>and
this coarse blanket</HI> was found on the de∣fender
when he was given to Favre; so
that he must be Mignion's child.</P>
<P>It is amazing what lengths party or in∣terest
will carry a person to, in questions
which deserve the most unbiassed conside∣ration.
<PB N="12" REF="93"/>
Madame Mignion, perjured as she
is admitted to be, in favour of the pur∣suers,
does not even say that the bit of dress
left with her child was of blanket; and as
little does Favre say, that what she describes
as molton or blanketing was a bit inferior
to the other parts of the defender's dress.
There never were two children seen whose
descriptions agree less with each other, than
that of Mignion's child and the defender,
in dress, colour, strength, eyes, and every
thing else.</P>
<P>From page 33. to page 43. this Juryman
accuses Lady Jane of falshood, of flattery,
of duplicity, and I know not what, for no
other reason, than that she, in one of her
letters, commends two young gentlemen
she met with at the Hague;—that she is in
a passion with one of her relations for say∣ing
she is living at Windsor, under a bor∣rowed
name, with Col. Stewart; and that
she denied her marriage to Lady Catharine
Wemyss, at a time she was keeping it a se∣cret
from all the world.</P>
<P>If a person of her high rank, and remark∣able
good character for religion, good sense,
and other amiable accomplishments, is to
be abused in the manner this hireling (for
he can be nothing else) has done Lady Jane,
<PB N="13" REF="94"/>
for such reasons as these, it is certain no
woman on earth can possibly escape falling
a sacrifice to the spite of such illiberal, bad∣hearted
people. It is very true, that if she
was now alive, she would probably think
differently of some of those young gentle∣men,
of whom she had then so good an opi∣nion.
From her own letter, she had much
reason to be dissatisfied at the person she is
angry with for many falshoods she had
raised to her prejudice; and her denying
her marriage does not, in her circumstan∣ces,
appear to me at all culpable. If people
are to judge of one's character from their
writings, the author of these Considerations,
if he is as disinterested in this suit as he pre∣tends,
is surely a very bad hearted man:
for, at the very time he is employed in
writing these Considerations, he must have
been sensible he was saying many things
which are absolutely false, with an inten∣tion
to prejudice the world against a young
man who never offended him.</P>
<P>He next says that Sholto was left sixteen
months at Paris, under the care of La
Marre, and that if he had died in the mean
time, no person knew where the child was,
so he must have been lost.</P>
<P>Sir John knew well at the time where
the child was at nurse, he had seen him fre∣quently
<PB N="14" REF="95"/>
when at Paris. He had visited him
from Damartine; he had wrote to Lady Jane
an account of his health from Paris to that
place, as appears from Mrs. Hewit's letter
to the maids. He returned to Paris in Oc∣tober
1748, and carried cloaths with him
for the child; he went back again in the
Spring 1749, for no other purpose but to
see the child. How then can this man say
that if La Marre had died the child would
have been lost? The only reason he has is,
that Sir John says, when examined, in the
year 1762, in the 74th year of his age, that
he did not then remember the place where
she had lived in the year 1748.</P>
<P>The Juryman then goes on to state, that
when Sir John and Lady Jane were about to
return to Britain, they went from Rheims
to Paris, under the pretence of bringing away
their second child, that during the eight days
they were then at Paris, a child of one Sanry
was carried off from his father, by one
Duverné, who was aged about sixty, and
that this Duverné was no other than Sir
John Stewart, and the child Sholto.</P>
<P>As to this charge, without entering much
into the particulars, it is as clear as sun∣shine
that the child of Sanry and Sholto
were different. The proof of the existence
of Sholto from his birth in July 1748,
<PB N="15" REF="96"/>
is to me convincing, Sanry's child was four
months older than the defender; yet Sholto
was much less and weaker than his brother,
as had been uniformly given out. Sanry's
child was walking and speaking when car∣ried
off, and yet the evidence is clear that
Sholto did neither when brought to Eng∣land,
and for some time after: and every
one of the pursuers witnesses say, that appli∣cation
was made to the lieutenant of police
to make a search for the persons who carried
off this child, within two or three days after
he was taken away from his parents; and
there is the most satisfying evidence that
this magistrate was not applied to till the
10th of January 1750, several weeks before
which time Sir John had left Rheims, on
his return to England, with both his chil∣dren,
so that he could not possibly have had
the least connection with this pretended en∣levement.</P>
<P>His arguments upon the supposed
impossibility of their not writing to Paris,
when they heard of the suspicions as to
the legitimacy of their children, their
writing to Aix for certificates of the preg∣nancy,
&amp;c. are not worth minding, they
are trivial and totally immaterial: only it is
very clearly proved, that they took the ad∣vice
of a gentleman very eminent in his pro∣fession,
then a lawyer, if they ought to do
<PB N="16" REF="97"/>
so, and were assured it was highly unne∣cessary
and improper; and had they, upon
false reports raised in the manner these have
been proved to have been, given themselves
the trouble of obtaining certificates, they
would rather have increased than diminished
the suspicions.</P>
<P>What he has said as to Godefroi is al∣ready
noticed, and it is needless to take
more time upon it at present.</P>
<P>His observations upon Lady Jane's preg∣nancy
are puerile and trifling to the highest
degree. If ever woman on earth was with
child during the whole nine months prior to
the birth, Lady Jane Douglas was. Her
appearance of pregnancy was not sudden,
as alledged by this author, but gradual;
observed by her servants and the people
about her from the first hour, and conti∣nued
gradually increasing till she was deli∣vered
of the defender and his twin brother.
The supposal of her appearance of preg∣nancy
being stronger at Aix than at Rheims
is ridiculous, when it is supposed she was
at this very time deceiving onè of her own
maid servants who was about her at both
these places.</P>
<P>This author concludes with an idle and
unnecessary account of the popularity of
<PB N="17" REF="98"/>
the defender and his cause in Scotland; that
the whole country were incensed at the
judgment; but that the judicious and most
valuable part of society, though perhaps the
least numerous, applauded the decision.</P>
<P>The purpose of this declamation I do not
see; nor did I ever hear who the valuable
part of society alluded to are, unless they
be the tutors of Duke Hamilton,—the heirs
of line of the Duke of Douglas, and their
friends, and some of the authors of the
scandalous reports which were falsely raised
against Lady Jane.</P>
<P>This gentleman however is pleased to say
that every humane heart must compassionate
the defender; and that he applauds his pa∣troness,
by whom, I suppose, he means
the Duchess of Douglas, for her unwearied
support of him.</P>
<P>Whether this gentleman is one of these
humane hearted people will appear from his
pamphlet. The defender, I am persuaded,
despises his pity as much as his pamphlet,
and as much as the Duchess of Douglas, if I
am not much mistaken of her character, does
his praises. She has done what she thought
her duty, and what she owed to the fa∣mily
of Douglas in supporting it, and pro∣tecting
a young man of uncommon merit,
<PB N="18" REF="99"/>
against a very extraordinary combination of
the most relentless, implacable and malici∣ous
enemies. Neither she or her pupil
have the least reason to doubt of obtaining
that justice in another country which they
have been refused in their own.</P>
