<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN first Willoughby arrived in
London, he had endeavoured to bring him∣self
to a resolution of seeing Celestina; but
her absence at that time on a tour of plea∣sure,
and the assurances he received that
she was engaged to Montague Thorold,
not only diverted him from that intention,
but gave his sister both time and opportu∣nity
to represent her as neither wanting or
wishing for that attention, which he thought
he should, as a friend, shew her. These
insinuations had gradually their effect: not
however in curing that invincible tender∣ness
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
he always felt for her, but in mingling
with it so much bitterness that his life be∣came
more than ever wretched. The acci∣dentally
meeting Celestina at an assembly,
gay, unconcerned, and, as he believed,
forgetting her former attachment to him in
her new preference to Montague Thorold;
the second meeting, which happened at the
opera; and evéry thing that he heard both
from his sister and in general conversation
where Celestina was mentioned, all served
to confirm this idea; while the letter which
would have undeceived him, never reached
his hands. It was left with Lady Moly∣neux;
who, determined as she was to im∣pede
every advance towards a reconciliation
between her brother and Celestina, made
no scruple, on hearing from whom it came,
to open, read, and, after some consideration,
to deftroy it.</P>
<P>Of the apparent neglect, therefore, which
Celestina imputed to Willoughby, he had
accused <HI>ber;</HI> and thought, that if she had
not determined to connect herself with
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Montague Thorold without any attention
to his wishes or reliance on his regard, she
would have written to or sent to him: while
his neglect of a letter by which she thought
she should awaken all the tenderness of
friendship which she hoped he still retained
for her, and the angry and disdainful looks
with which he had twice met her, wounded
both her affection and her pride. Thus,
by the treachery of Lady Molyneux, all
commerce even of civility was at an end
between them; and such was the situation
of Willoughby, when the Castlenorths ar∣rived
in London from Italy.</P>
<P>Embarrassed more and more in his af∣fairs,
and on the point of being over∣whelmed
with pecuniary distress, it was more
than time that he should determine what to
do; and this determination, the return of
the Castlenorths to England was intended
to hasten.</P>
<P>Always believing that to the artifices of
Lady Castlenorth he had owed his being
compelled to quit Celestina, and still hoping
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
to detect those artifices, he had, by fre∣quent
visits at his uncle's, and by a sort of
tacit and reluctant acquiescence in many of
his plans, given Miss Fitz-Hayman great
reason to suppose that he intended fulfilling
his original engagement with her: yet now
that he saw he must either continue to act
what he could not but feel was a disho∣nourable
and disingenuous part, or break
with his uncle entirely, his uneasiness be∣came
more insupportable. The tortures
which he had felt in observing the favour
Celestina had shewn to Montague Thorold,
by whispering and laughing with him, gave
him a cruel foretaste of what he should suf∣fer
were he to see her married to him; yet
his reason, whenever he was calm enough
to listen to it, told him how absurd, how
improper it was, to indulge such sensations
of anguish and regret; since, if the relation∣ship
which had been hinted at did really
subsist between them, he could never take
any other part in regard to her than a
friendly and fraternal concern in her happi∣ness;
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and since the age, family, and circum∣stances
of Montague Thorold were all with∣out
objection, he ought, if she believed
such an alliance would make her happy,
not only to rejoice in it but promote it.</P>
<P>From this, however, his heart absolutely
revolted; and all he could prevail upon
himself to think of was, to make for Celes∣tina
some more ample provision if he was
once convinced of their relationship, and to
wish her happy: for to see her happy, when
another was to be the object of her love,
he found would be to him the cruellest pu∣nishment
that Fate could inflict.</P>
<P>Sometimes he thought, that since every
other woman on earth was indifferent to
him, he ought to learn to approve of Miss
Fitz-Hayman, of whose apparently en∣creasing
affection towards him he could not
be insensible. But love was never yet the
effect of effort; and while he compared her,
with all her laboured accomplishments, to
Celestina, he found too certainly that he
never could love her, and that with such
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
sentiments to promise it, was an unworthy
prostitution of his honour.</P>
<P>His coldness, however, and visible re∣luctance,
discouraged none of the other
parties who desired this marriage: and
Miss Fitz-Hayman, with all that pride
which her birth, her fortune, and the exalted
idea of her own merit, gave her, seemed to
be, either from her affection to Willough∣by
or some other cause, content to receive
his hand with the hope of afterwards win∣ning
his heart. Convinced that he had no
attachment but to Celestina, and certain
that the impediments between them must
effectually prevent his ever again thinking
of her with the fond partiality he had done,
she seemed very easy as to his indifference
towards herself; foreseeing, perhaps, that
their lives would be such after they were
married as would very soon produce it, if
they did not set out with it: or, to judge
more candidly, she might think with pride
and pleasure of conquering, as his wife, that
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
coldness to which, as his mistress, she could
not be insensible.</P>
<P>Lord Castlenorth had so determined a
predilection for the match, which the diffi∣culties
he had met with had by no means
abated, that he would not see any thing that
appeared inimical to this his darling scheme.
His great object was—and he forgot his
infirmities as he pursued it—to procure for
Willoughby the reversion of all his titles,
and, to change his name to Fitz-Hayman.
This he found would be attended with no
great difficulty; and now, whenever he saw
his nephew, he enumerated all the species
of satisfaction which in his opinion would
attend these acquirements, dwelling with
great delight on the circumstance of the
family arms remaining unchanged; though
he offered to quarter those of Willoughby,
if their owner found any reluctance in
parting with them entirely.</P>
<P>From these harangues, which nothing
could for a moment render interesting to
Willoughby, <HI>his</HI> imagination was often quite
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
absent, and sled after Celestina, whom it
represented as making the felicity of Mon∣tague
Thorold, and enjoying with him that
life of elegant and literary retirement, which
he had himself fondly hoped to share with
her. Frequently, when his uncle was
talking to him of his ancestor, Reginald
Fitz-Hayman, who in the reign of Hen∣ry
IV. was slain by the celebrated Hotspur,
then in rebellion, after having twice un∣horsed
him, describing the circumstances
of the combat, and still more minutely
the bearings thereupon granted in addition
to their former coat, Willoughby, far from
attending to him, was meditating on some
walk he had taken with Celestina during their
short happiness at Alvestone the preceding
spring; on the remarks she had made, and
the improvements she had suggested; and
having no idea of what his uncle was talk∣ing
about, only under standing by his tone
when he ended a period, he said—"To be
sure"—"Oh certainly"—"Very great"—"Undoubtedly"—without
knowing or car∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
whether these words were well placed:
while Lord Castlenorth was too much de∣lighted
with the pleasure of hearing himself
talk on his favourite topic, to remark, that
Willoughby knew not a syllable of what he
was saying; and the latter had really ac∣quired
such a habit of inattention to those
subjects about which his uncle paraded,
that he not unfrequently had, in appear∣ance,
assented to plans relative to his for∣tune,
and his residence after his marriage,
when in reality he had not, on the discourse
to which he seemed to listen, formed any
one idea.</P>
<P>A few days only passed in this manner
after the return of the Castlenorths to Eng∣land,
before the extreme pain he felt, the
second time of seeing Celestina in public,
made him sensible of his inability to conti∣nue
long in this undecided and wretched
state. From mere acquiescence in misery,
or rather from an hope to escape from it by
detecting Lady Castlenorth's schemes, he
had become insensibly more deeply entan∣gled
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
in them: and he now began to accuse
himself of very unjustifiable conduct; since
not all the distressing circumstances of his
fortune, not the certainty of Celestina's be∣ing
lost to him, nor the pleasure of saving
his paternal estate, and particularly Alves∣tone,
which, after Celestina, had always
been his first object, could, on a strict ex∣amination
of his own heart, lead him to
form a serious wish of becoming the hus∣band
of Miss Fitz-Hayman: and he was
conscious that every part of his behaviour
that had raised contrary expectations, was
owing rather to his despair of obtaining one
woman than to his wish of being united to
another.</P>
<P>His mind was now in such a state of con∣tinual
debate and perplexity, that nothing
had the power a moment to amuse or please
him. His sister, without an heart herself,
had no notion of the corrosive sensations
that preyed on his; his health, though far
from being restored, was such as no longer
offered her any prospect of becoming the
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
heiress to what family property was left;
and since her brother did live, her wish was
to have him live in splendour, graced with
the happiness of nobility, and reflecting
honour on her by his affluence and pros∣perity.
Her dislike of Lady Castlenorth
and her daughter was long since loft in the
more inveterate dislike she had conceived
against Celestina, since she had been so
much seen in good company in London,
and so much celebrated for her beauty:
she always therefore affected to consider his
marriage with Miss Fitz-Hayman as a set∣tled
thing; and from the moment of the
Castlenorths return to England, she joined,
with more zeal than her selfish indolence
usually permitted her to feel for any thing,
in promoting it.</P>
<P>Thus beset by his family, and on the
other hand harrassed by the encreasing cla∣mours
of his creditors, who offered him only
the fad alternative of felling Alvestone, and
whose impatience was fomented by the
artful management of Lady Castlenorth,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Willoughby for some litle time lingered
and hesitated: now thought that he ought
to marry, when such advantages were to
be acquired by it, now recoiled from the
dreadful idea of passing his life with a wo∣man
who was indifferent to him, and whom
he doubted whether he could ever learn to
love. Even in the symptoms of her regard
for him, which were unequivocal enough,
there was something which rather disgusted
than flattered him; and when he thought
how different were their minds, their tim∣pers,
and their pursuits, no earthly consi∣deration
seemed to have sufficient weight
with, him, to make him resolve on putting
on a yoke so uneasy to his imagination.</P>
<P>The repeated sight of Celestina made all
his wounds bleed afresh. He found, that
neither the suspicions of their relationship,
or what he thought the certainty of her
alienation from him, were strong enough
to counteract the effect of the long rooted
affection he felt for her: but he believed
that if those suspicions once amounted to a
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
certainty—if once he was thoroughly con∣vinced
Celestina was his sister, he should
learn to conquer every other sentiment in
regard to her but what he might with ho∣nour
indulge.</P>
<P>For this reason, and because he found
some satisfaction in the delay this journey
would give him a pretence for, and thought
that mere change of place would afford
him some relief, he determined to set out
in search of that servant, Hannah Biscoe,
to whom he had obtained a direction in
Italy, and whom he had been detained
from visiting partly by his ill state of health
and partly by the artifices of Lady Moly∣neux.</P>
<P>After she and Lady Castlenorth had met,
however, her opposition to this journey
was withdrawn; and he set out on horse∣back,
attended only by his old servant
Farnham, intending to reach the village to
which he was directed, and which was on the
borders of Lancashire, by easy journies.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Miss Fitz-Hayman, to whom he had
said that every consideration urged him to
a complete developement of the mystery
now that it seemed to be in his power, saw
him depart with an appearance of reluc∣tance;
but Willoughby had seen her, ever
since her arrival in England, making par∣ties
for public places without him, if he
happened not to be able or disposed to go;
and found, that during his absence she
would proceed in the same course of amusement;
and that she and her mother would
find no inconvenience for want of an escort,
as they had brought over with them an Irish
officer, who had been in the service of
France,- with whom Lady Castlenorth had
contracted an intimacy a few years before
in Italy, which in their last journey to the
Continent had been renewed and encreased:
in consequence of which, Captain Cava∣naugh
had accompanied them to London,
where he had apartments in the house, and
was become one of the family. At all
places of public resort he attended on Lady
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Castlenorth; sat by her at the upper end of
the table to carve for her; and acted as a
sort of gentleman usher to the mother,
while he treated the daughter with the most
profound reverence and respect.</P>
<P>This gentleman was three or four and
thirty. His face was handsome, and his
figure, though large, uncommonly fine.
He had seen a great deal of service and of
the world; spoke all European languages
except English, well, and with all the ani∣mation
of a Frenchman, had enough of the
national character still about him, to mark
him for an Irishman.</P>
<P>He was, indeed, sufficiently proud of
his country, and piqued himself on being
descended from the kings of Leinster; and
Lord Castlenorth, to whom he contrived to
render himself agreeable by a patient at∣tention
to long stories, by his knowledge
of genealogy, by picking up for him old
books of heraldry, and understanding the
difference between a pale lozengy, and a
pale engrailed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Terms used in heraldry.</NOTE>; and affixing some impor∣tance
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
to the enquiry, whether one of the
quarterings of the arms of Fitz-Hayman,
should in strictness be on field argent, a
boar's head, couped gules, or couped Or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Terms used in heraldry.</NOTE>.
Lord Castlenorth, among other doubts on
this and equally important subjects with
which he amused himself, sometimes con∣sidered
whether the genealogy of Captain
Cavanaugh might not be traced back in
Ireland a generation or two beyond his own
in Normandy, a circumstance which ex∣cited
his respect, and gave, in his opinion,
weight and value to those qualities by which
the Captain contrived to render himself,
throughout the family, so very acceptable.</P>
<P>Willoughby had seen him with them
once or twice abroad, but had not then
particularly noticed him among that croud
of all nations and descriptions which Lady
Castlenorth contrived to collect around her
there. He now saw him, not without a
slight degree of surprise, domesticated in
the family; but his whole attention seemed
to be given to the elder members of it; and
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
he hardly ever spoke to Miss Fitz-Hayman,
who, when Willoughby one day took oc∣casion
to remark that he was on a footing
of greater intimacy than formerly, answered,
with something like a careless sneer—"Oh
you know that Cavanaugh has long been
my mother's great favourite."</P>
<P>In the societies of London, however,
this intimacy became the subject of some
malicious comments; and Lady Moly∣neux,
who seldom let any thing of that
sort escape her, could not forbear indulg∣ing
herself in some remarks on Lady Cas∣tlenorth's
friendship, even before her bro∣ther,
who gave, however, so little atten∣tion
to what he heard, that before he reached
the end of his first day's journey he had
forgot that such a person as the Captain
existed, as he would probably have forgot∣ten
Lady Castlenorth herself, had not the
purpose of his present journey, and all the
transactions of the last twelve months of his
life, brought her and the consequences of
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
those transactions too forcibly to his me∣mory.</P>
<P>While Willoughby was thus on his jour∣ney,
the disquiet and unhappiness of Celes∣tina,
though she was compelled to appear
to conquer them, were but little abated.</P>
<P>Nothing, in the opinion of Lady Hora∣tia,
contributed so much to wean the mind
from indulging sorrow or encouraging
weakness, as variety of company and con∣tinual
dissipation; and in these, notwith∣standing
her reluctance, Celestina was con∣tinually
engaged. She now more than ever
regretted that she had relinquished that
plan of life which she had fixed upon when
first left, by the death of Mrs. Willoughby,
to seek a new one. The quiet farm house
in Devonshire where Cathcatt and Jessy
lived, the tender attention she should be
there sure to meet with, the not unpleasing
melancholy of Mrs. Elphinstone, and the
perfect seclusion she might there enjoy from
a world where nothing gave her any real
pleasure, were ideas which were now al∣ways
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
returning to her mind with new
power. There, she thought her sad heart
might be laid open to the pitying sympa∣thy
of her first and most beloved friend,
and find some satisfaction amidst it's own
disappointments in witnessing the happiness
of that friend, to which she had been so,
greatly instrumental; and there she might
wander whole days among the fields and
copses, indulging herself in repeating the
name of Willoughby, in thinking of him,
in reading again those books they had read
together, painting the plants he admired,
and composing melancholy verses, which
above every other occupation soothed her
mind. But when she had represented to
herself all the mournful pleasure she should
in such a situation enjoy, and half determined
to gratify herself, the ingratitude of which
she should be guilty towards Lady Horatia
destroyed her resolves; and alas! she recol∣lected
too, that at the farm of Jessy she saw
from almost every field, and from some of
the windows of the house, Alvestone Park,
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
where Miss Fitz-Hayman would soon be
mistress; the sight she thought she could
not bear; and her mind turned with terror
from the idea of it. There were also very
strong objections against her going into the
immediate neighbourhood of Montague
Thorold, if she meant not to give him en∣couragement;
and these considerations
adding to the impracticability of her quit∣ting,
without better reasons than a mere wish
of retirement, such a generous protectress
as Lady Horatia, determined her to wean
her mind from an inclination she could not
properly indulge, and to move on as well
as she could in the wearisome circle; till
the time arrived when Lady Horatia set out
on her summer tour, which was to begin
by going to Matlock, from whence she
was to go into Wales, and then end the
summer at Cheltenham.</P>
<P>Vavasour had been so long absent, that
Celestina began to hope his pride and re∣sentment
had subdued every wish to pursue
her. In this, however, she was mistaken:
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
a few days after the departure of Willough∣by
he called, and was admitted. Lady
Horatia and Celestina, though neither of
them were pleased to see him, yet received
him with civility, and entered on common
topics, such as the occurrences of the day
afford; to these he appeared very inatten∣tive,
and turning abruptly to Celestina, he
said—"Miss De Mornay, cannot I speak
to you alone?"</P>
<P>She hesitated a moment, and then said—"I
believe, Mr. Vavasour, there is nothing
you can have to communicate to me, that
ought to be a secret to Lady Horatia How∣ard."</P>
<P>"There is, Madam," returned he with
quickness, and appearing much displeased
with her apparent disinclination to oblige
him, "for what I have to say relates in
some measure to others, whose confidence
I have no right to betray whatever I may
chuse to do in those circumstances that re∣late
only to myself."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
Lady Horatia now rose, and said—"My
dear, oblige Mr. Vavasour if he wishes to
speak to you without witnesses." She then
left the room.</P>
<P>"Now, Madam," said Vavasour, as
soon as she had shut the door—"now you
have no longer an excuse to repulse or deny
me: Willoughby assuredly quits you for
ever: and nothing ought, nothing shall im∣pede
my pretensions. Emily—my poor
Emily herself—on whose account I own to
you I have hesitated more than once, wishes
my success, and bids me say, that convinced
my happiness depends upon you, she with∣draws
every claim which she had on my
heart, and beseeches you to believe it is not
unworthy your acceptance."</P>
<P>"Emily, Sir?" cried Celestina in some
surprise: "of whom do you speak? and
how can a person to whose very name I am
a stranger, be likely in such a case to influ∣ence
me?"</P>
<P>"Don't affect," said he, "the ridiculous
prudery of disclaiming any knowledge of
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
her, because she does not rank among those
who are falsely called virtuous women: by
heaven she has virtues that might redeem
the vices of half her sex; not one in a thou∣sand
of whom possess a twentieth part of
her worth."</P>
<P>"I mean not," answered Celestina,
mildly, "to dispute her value, but only
to ask on what pretension you urge to me
either the resignation or opinions of a per∣son
with whom I have no acquaintance."</P>
<P>"Why will you pretend not to know
her," resumed he with redoubled impe∣tuosity—"why
affect not to know that
Emily, who has lived with me almost twelve
months, is the sister of your Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
and of that Cathcart whom Willough∣by
picked up and placed as his steward at
Alvestone."</P>
<P>"I have heard there is such a person,"
said Celestina: "but I did not know she
lived with you."</P>
<P>"Yes, she has lived with me some time,
though I did not till lately know her fa∣mily.
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
Unworthy and disgraced as you may
think her, she should at this moment have
been mistress of my house and my fortune,
by what you would call legal claims, if I
had not, like a cursed fool as I am, taken
up a passion for you which I cannot get rid
of, and which my generous little girl not
only knows, but with disinterested affection,
instead of trying to dissuade me from it,
wishes me to succeed in. I have some∣times
fancied, that your knowledge of my
attachment to her was in my way; and that
circumstance, together with the eternal
mystery that always hung over Willough∣by's
intentions—in short, my hopes of be∣ing
cured of a damned folly, by reason and
absence, instead of matrimony, have alto∣gether
made me refrain from visiting you
lately. But now I think, since George is
gone out of town and returns only to be
married to Miss Fitz-Hayman, there is an
end of that; and for my experiment—curse
me if I believe it will do; and so here
I am again, more in love and a greater
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
blockhead than ever. Don't, however,
mistake me, Celestina: I will not, I can∣not
bear to be trisled with; nor will I sa∣crifice
one hour, either to your coquetry or
to the absurd partiality which I sometimes
used to believe you had, for that whining,
snivelling Montague Thorold. If there are
no other pretensions than his in the way, I
shall soon know how to settle the matter."</P>
<P>"Really, Mr. Vavasour," said Celestina,
as soon as he would give her an opportunity
of speaking, "your conduct and manners
are so eccentric, that it is difficult to know
what to say to you, which you will not call
either prudery or coquetry, or impute to a
partiality for some other person. Permit
me, however, to tell you, with that sin∣cerity
with which I have always spoke on
this subject, that I am sensible of the ho∣nour
you do me, but that I never can ac∣cept
it, even though my situation were to
be more humble than it is, and though
such a man as Mr. Montague Thorold had
never existed."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
"Oh! very well, Madam," cried Va∣vasour,
impatiently interrupting her—"You
must, however, allow me to ask your ob∣jections:
are they to my person? my fa∣mily?
my fortune?"</P>
<P>"I have already said, Sir, that they are
all unexceptionable."</P>
<P>"Well, Madam, I must then infer from
your refusal, that you are engaged."</P>
<P>"No, Sir, that inference by no means
follows. Pardon me if I say, that notwith∣standing
all the advantages you possess, it
is possible for a person to decline the ho∣nour
of your addresses without being en∣gaged."</P>
<P>"However, Madam, do you or do
you not deny that such an engagement does
exist? Of that, I think, I have a right to
enquire."</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Sir, if I answer that it
does not seem to me that you have any
right in the world to ask that question of
me."</P>
<P>"Well then, I shall ask it elsewhere."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
"Where you have, if possible, still less
right," said Celestina, alarmed at his vehe∣mence.</P>
<P>"You are, however, very quick at un∣derstanding
to whom I allude."</P>
<P>"Certainly, after what you have just
said, I cannot mistake your meaning. You
allude to Mr. Montague Thorold."</P>
<P>"Damn him," cried Vavasour, rising,
and speaking with vehemence that made
her shudder, "that puppy crosses me like
my evil genius. By any man at all worthy
of you, I might perhaps bear to be sup∣planted;
but by such a silly fellow as that—no,
damn it, there is no enduring it—curse
me if it does not make me frantic."</P>
<P>"Hear me then, Mr. Vavasour—hear
me for the last time—for I never will again
willingly expose myself to this sort of treat∣ment.
<HI>I am not</HI> engaged to Mr. Thorold:
it is not likely I ever shall be engaged to
him; and farther, I again protest to you,
that did no such person exist it would make
no difference in the resolution I have made
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
never to listen to the offers with which you
honour me."</P>
<P>This declaration, repeated so strongly,
served but to inflame those passions which
Celestina hoped it would repress, and piqued
his pride, without destroying what he called
love. He walked backwards and forwards
in the room a moment or two, and seemed
to be reasoning with that extravagant
warmth of temper she had complained of:
but his eyes and his manner expressed
plainly what he forbore to utter. After a
while, he appeared to have conquered the
inclination he felt to give way to the rage
that possessed him; and sitting down by
her, he softened his voice as much as he
could, though it trembled through the va∣riety
of emotions he felt, and endeavoured
to speak calmly while he said—"Celestina,
if this be really the case—if I may venture
to believe you, you will not surely refuse
to satisfy me a little farther. I am not a
vain coxcomb: but I know that neither
my figure or my understanding are con∣temptible;
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
temptible; I have a very affluent fortune;
and I have an heart that, as you well know,
adores you. Willoughby cannot or will
not marry you; of that I think you can no
longer doubt. You say, that you are not
engaged to the young Doctor Thorold;
tell me then, what there is, that overba∣lancing
so many points in my favour, ren∣ders
them all ineffectual."</P>
<P>"And I will tell you candidly, Mr.
Vavasour. My objections then are, to your
morals—to your principles: they may not
be, and I dare say are not, worse than those
of other young men of fortune who have
equal opportunities of following their own
inclinations: but however that may be,
they are such as would inevitably make me
unhappy; and knowing that, it would be
extreme folly were any advantages which
affluence can offer to induce me to risk it."</P>
<P>"My morals!" cried Vavasour—"again
my morals!—and pray what part of what
you are pleased to call my morals is it that
gives you so much offence?"</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
"All," answered she. "Your manner
of life—your attachments—your connec∣tions,
which you have just acknowledged
you could not, without hesitation and re∣luctance,
quit."</P>
<P>"Still you will misunderstand me. What
I said in regard to Emily surely went to a
very different meaning. I told you, that
you are the only woman upon earth for
whom I would quit her; and the greater
my regard has been for her, surely the
greater it makes out my attachment to you,
for whom I would relinquish her. By hea∣ven!
I cannot tell how far my affection for
her might have carried me, if my passion
for you had not taken so deep root in my
heart; and curse me, if amidst it all I do
not still love her dearly, and would give
half my estate to make her happy and re∣establish
her health; but poor dear girl—she
will never, I am afraid, recover."</P>
<P>"If her illness is occasioned by her fears
of losing you, Sir," said Celestina, "re∣move
at once the cause of it by thinking of
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
me no more. If you love her as much as
you express, surely this cannot be difficult;
and why, feeling this attachment to a per∣son
whom you think so deserving of it,
should you, contrary to the dictates of rea∣son,
pursue one who never can return the
good opinion you entertain of her."</P>
<P>"Because of my morals! Ridiculous
cant and falsehood. Don't I know that
women all like the very libertinism they are
pleased outwardly to condemn? Don't I
know that the proudest, the most prudish
among ye, are flattered by the attention of
those men who are called the greatest rakes,
and that if any queer fellow sets up to be a
moral man, ye all laugh at and despise
him. This sort of stuff about morals, you
have learned, I suppose, either from old par∣son
Thorold, or this good motherly gentle∣woman
you live with: but you, who have
so much sense, cannot seriously persist in
such methodistical cant; and as to any ob∣jections
about Emily—"</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34"/>
"Don't mistake me, Mr. Vavasour. I
made no mention of her in the way of ob∣jection."</P>
<P>"Well then," cried he, interrupting her,
"as to my morals in every other respect
they are really exemplary. I play, com∣paratively,
very little; I don't drink a fifth
part so much as half the people I live with;
and I reckon myself, upon the whole, a very
orderly, sober fellow."</P>
<P>"By comparison only," said Celestina,
half smiling at his way of making out the account.</P>
<P>"Aye, by comparison. Every thing in
this world is, you know, good or bad only
by comparison. Come, come, Celestina, I
was willing enough to allow for your pre∣possession
in favour of George Willoughby,
but to any other I cannot, I will not sub∣mit;
nor will I allow any thing to this
damned prudery. I know myself worthy
of you, highly as I think of you. Yes, I
deserve you, if it be only for my persevering
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
love; and by all that's good I will not be
denied."</P>
<P>"You really will, Sir," replied Celestina;
who, more and more distressed by his perse∣verance,
desired to put an end to it for ever
if possible—"you really will; for I protest
to you that I never can give any other an∣swer
than I have already given, and I beg,
I entreat that you will desist from a pursuit
that can produce for you only mortification."</P>
<P>"May perdition seize me if I do!" re∣turned
he with renewed vehemence. "No!
if I perish in the attempt, I will persevere!"
He was proceeding in this strain, when Lady
Horatia sent to let Celestina know she waited
for her to go out; and she took the oppor∣tunity
of hastening away, glad to be relieved
from a conversation so distressing; while
Vavasour, finding all attempts to detain her
ineffectual, left the house in one of those
paroxysms of passion, which disappointment,
from his having never been used to submit
to it, always produced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be difficult to say, whether
Willoughby, wandering and solitary among
the remote villages of Yorkshire, or Celes∣tina,
surrounded in London by what the
world calls pleasure and amusement, was the
most internally wretched. Celestina's
last dialogue with Vavasour, had convinced
her that Willoughby no longer thought of
her even with that degree of friendship and
tenderness which he had so often assured
her nothing should destroy: he was gone
out of town merely to prepare for his mar∣riage;
and gone without deigning either
to see her or answer the letter she had writ∣ten
to him. There was, in such conduct,
so much unkindness and inhumanity, that
she began to hope her reflections on it would
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
by degrees abate the anguish she now felt:
and she listened to Lady Horatia, who con∣tinually
spoke of it as an unequivocal proof
of Willoughby's want of an heart capable
of a generous and steady attachment. To
Montague Thorold, however, (who now
again returned to town after an absence on
business of some little time), she could not
listen with so much complacency as her
friend wished; and she repeatedly told him,
that the greatest obligation he could confer
upon her would be to desist from talking to
her of love. The certainty, however, there now
seemed to be that Willoughby no
longer considered himself as interested about
her; her positive rejection of Mr. Vava∣sour,
and the encouragement given him by
Lady Horatia to persevere, brought him
continually to the house; where their morn∣ing
parties of reading re-commenced; and
whenever they went out of an evening,
Montague Thorold was their attendant:
thus drinking intoxicating draughts of love,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
and indulging hope that it would finally be
successful.</P>
<P>Willoughby now found without difficulty
the person he sought: and whether it was
that she had her lesson more completely, or
was permitted to speak plainer of what she
knew, she answered all his enquiries in such
a way as served to perplex but not entirely
to affirm the question, whether Celestina
was his mother's daughter. The woman
was, in her mind and ideas, one of the
lowest of the vulgar: yet her simplicity
seemed to be affected; and all the proofs
which had been talked of did not amount
to her declaring that she was present at the
birth of Celestina or could produce any po∣sitive
evidence of it. She spoke principally
to the time when she said the little girl was
at nurse at Kensington; of, which she related
a great many particulars that staggered
Willoughby more than ever, without con∣vincing
him: yet all the woman said, though
it was consistent, had the air of having been
learned by rote; and there was about her a
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
sort of guarded cunning which seemed to
have been acquired, or at least improved
by long practice. Willoughby attempted
to discover whether she had not received
money from Lady Castlenorth, and to find
what were her present means of subsistence:
but for these enquiries also she seemed pre∣pared;
and gave at least a plausible account
of a legacy left her by a great uncle, that
enabled her to live without servitude in her
native country, where she boarded with a re∣lation,
and affected great piety and sanctity.
She blessed God, she said, that she scorned
for the lucre of gain to belye any one, dead
or alive, much more her good mistress
who was gone: but truth was truth and she
hoped, by the help of God, always to speak
it plain and direct, without fee or reward:
"and as for Lady Castlenorth," added she,
"whom your honour thinks has paid me
for speaking of this thing, pray consider,
your honour, wherein it could be useful to
my lady to put me upon saying a falsity.
If I was base enough to take money of my
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
Lady for it, which to be certain I never
did, for what would that be, as your ho∣nour
well knows, but selling my immortal
soul? and what good, as I may say, would
all the gold and diamonds in the world do
me, if my precious soul was to perish be∣cause
of them."</P>
<P>This cant, to which Willoughby listened
with continued patience, made him hope
that he should, in some instance or other,
detect her of inconsistency. But though he
saw her repeatedly, and set Farnham to
watch her still more narrowly and to talk
the matter over with her as if in confidence,
she was always so guarded that no contra∣diction
could be discovered; and after wait∣ing
near a week at the village, Willoughby
was compelled to give up every idea of cer∣tainly
coming at the truth, and to return
towards London without being positively
sure that Celestina was so nearly related to
him; yet forced to allow that he could not,
in contradiction to all he had heard of a
child nursed in secret at Kensington, bring
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
any sort of evidence on which he ought to
rely that she was not so.</P>
<P>Sick at heart, and feeling too sensibly
that all his future life must be unhappy, his
mind sunk in total despondence. Too cer∣tain
it was, that under such circumstances
he could not think of marrying Celestina:
yet he was unhappily conscious that he
could not bear to think of her marrying
another. It was in vain he accused himself
of something worse than folly. The mo∣ment
his mind dwelt on that subject, he
found that folly irresistible: and while he
determined that one of the first things he
would do on his return should be to make a
provision for Celestina out of his remaining
fortune, he sickened in recollecting that
such a provision would probably but facili∣tate
her marriage with Montague Tho∣rold—and
of Montague Thorold he could
not think with patience.</P>
<P>Of his own situation in regard to the fa∣mily
of Fitz-Hayman, he thought with
equal bitterness. He was but too conscious,
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
that to obtain the information he wanted
from Hannah Biscoe, which he had flattered
himself would turn out very differently, he
had renewed his attendance at the house of
his uncle, and acted disingenuously and un∣like,
himself. However indifferent or averse
he was to his cousin, his honour forbade
him any longer to trifle with those senti∣ments
which she evidently entertained in
his favour. What then should he do?
This question came continually before him;
and was continually debated without his
being able to form any resolution on which
he could for a moment rest without pain.</P>
<P>He sometimes thought, that since in
losing the only woman whom he could
love, he had lost all that could render his
life happy, it was immaterial what became
of him; and that since he must be misera∣ble,
it might as well be in following as in
flying from what he still thought was in
some degree a duty—completing the en∣gagement
he had made to his mother on
her death bed. In doing this, he should
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
gratify all his surviving relations, and re∣trieve
his estate, which he must otherwise
sell, as the mortgages upon it were ra∣pidly
devouring it: and to do this was, as
he sometimes tried to persuade himself, to
pay a debt he owed his ancestors. He had
been educated by his mother in high ideas
of the consequence and respectability, not
only of her family but of that of his father;
but of these prejudices his natural good sense
had suffered very little to remain; so that
if he now endeavoured to recall them in
support of those arguments which he ran
over in favour of his marriage, his under∣standing
immediately revolted against them.</P>
<P>"I shall not-only retrieve," said he,
"but augment my fortune: not only save
Alvestone, but add to my present estates
the family possessions of my mother, which
will otherwise become the property of stran∣gers:
the honours too so long inherited by
her ancestors will be mine."</P>
<P>He frequently made efforts to fix his
mind on these advantages; but the mo∣ment
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
he began seriously to investigate their
value, he beheld them with contempt.</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried he. "My ances∣tors!
What is this foolish family pride, for
which I am meditating to sell my freedom,
in acquiescence with narrow prejudice? I
shall have a large estate: but will it make
me happier in myself, or more respected by
those whose respect can afford me any plea∣sure?
I shall be called "my Lord"—a
mighty satisfaction truly! The vulgar—for
with such empty sounds the vulgar only
are delighted—will bow low to my Lord∣ship,
and I shall take place at county
meetings above the neighbouring Esquires
who are now my equals. I shall have
a bauble called a coronet painted on my
coach doors and my hall chairs, and
shall become one of the legislature,
qualified for it only by the possession of
that bauble. Perhaps half a dozen or half
a hundred men and women of poor ambi∣tion,
may court the notice and boast of the
acquaintance of Lord Castlenorth, who
would have let Mr. Willoughby remain
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
unmolested by their kindness, and by such
friends my house will be infested and my
leisure destroyed. But I shall go to Court,
and be named as having appeared at the
drawing room; that will be very delectable
certainly: and my wife's fine cloaths will
be described at full length, and the taste of
my equipage be commended in all the
newspapers. It will be there told of me,
that I am gone to this or that of my coun∣try
houses; and my six bays, or greys, or
blacks, will be celebrated in Hyde Park, or
be conspicuous in the roads within twenty
miles of London; while a thousand insig∣nificant
insipid beings, whom I neither
know nor desire to know, shall say "what
a beautiful carriage, what a well appointed
equipage is that of my Lord Castlenorth."
All this felicity in the aggregate, and I
know of no more that belongs to the pos∣session
of a title, is certainly well worth the
sacrifice I shall make to obtain it; and my
ancestors, "from their airy clouds," will be
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
infinitely delighted by the glory of their de∣scendant.</P>
<P>But what will that descendant be in
reality? a mercenary, a miserable wretch:
condemned to pass his life with a woman,
whom, if he does not loath, he does not
love; to feel himself a purchased husband;
and to have sold, in sad exchange, man's
best birth right, freedom, for a mess of
pottage.</P>
<P>To such soliloquies as these, succeeded
determinations to carry no farther any sem∣blance
of attention to Miss Fitz-Hayman;
but to go even from his present journey and
without passing through London, imme∣diately
abroad.</P>
<P>To a mind unable to resist misery, there
frequently appears a possibility of flying
from it; and while Willoughby dreaded
the thoughts of returning to London, he
fancied that if he could cross over from Hull
to the north of Europe, he should leave
some part of his present unhappiness be∣hind
him. Unsettled and unhappy as he
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
was, these debates with himself, these vague
plans of quitting every thing and becoming
a wanderer on earth, became more usual with him:
but still he decided on nothing.
The idea of being compelled to sell Alves∣tone
was the only one, however, that had
great weight with him. To think that the
place to which he had been so fondly at∣tached
should become the property of some
upstart man of sudden fortune, was accom∣panied
by a sensation of acute uneasiness.
He imagined, those beautiful woods, the
growth of centuries, fallen in compliance
with the improving taste of a broker or a
warehouseman; the park ploughed up to
be converted into farms; and the elegant
simplicity of his house and his grounds, de∣stroyed
by gothic windows or Chinese orna∣ments;
the shrubberies where he had wan∣dered
with Celestina, that turf, where he
had ran by her side when she was learning
to ride, and where they used to walk arm
in arm together; that house, where he had
hoped she would preside, and grace so
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
lovely a scene with a mistress yet more
lovely; all, all were to become the pro∣perty
of another! and the very name of
Willoughby, and what was yet more pain∣ful,
the name of Celestina, should never
more, in those scenes, be remembered.
Yet in a moment the cruel truth occurred to
him, that whether this place belonged to
him or to another, Celestina would never
again visit it; that he should never again
hear her voice calling him among the beech
woods, or trace her footsteps on the turf;
never listen to her as she read in his mo∣ther's
dressing room, or hold her hand
within his as they sat together on the woody
banks of the water-fall, and marked it's
sparkling current leap from rock to rock.
And without her, what would Alvestone be
but a place where every spot would be
haunted by melancholy images of departed
happiness. How little the indulgence of
these painful contemplations would be in∣terrupted,
or put an end to, by any satisfac∣tion
he could derive from the conversation
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
of Miss Fitz-Hayman, his sick and reluc∣tant
heart too plainly told him: and then he
again believed himself determined to sell all
his estatesand quit England; if not for ever,
at least till time, absence, and the impossi∣bility
of his changing it, had better recon∣ciled
him to that destiny which condemned
him to give up Celestina, and to see her in
the arms of another.</P>
<P>A desultory and unsettled life, had within
the last year become habitual to him; and
while he was actually moving from one
place to another, his spirits preyed less
corrosively on themselves. Since to live as
he wished to have lived in his own country
was impossible, he thought he should re∣gret
it less while he was wandering over
others: and since he could not now con∣template
the face and character he so fondly
loved, he hoped that variety of characters
and variety of faces would divert his regret
if they could not cure his attachment.
There was too an idea of freedom and in∣dependence,
which accompanied his thus
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
shaking off at once every incumbrance,
that was not without it's charms; and in
this disposition he thought contemptuously
of mere local preference as unworthy a
strong mind, and determined to become a
citizen of the world; and when in his ima∣gination
he had settled his rout, through
Holland and France to Sicily, which he
had long wished to see, and from thence
to the Archipelago, he breathed freer, and
felt himself more reconciled to existence.</P>
<P>He journeyed, however, slowly towards
London while these debates were carrying
on: and at York, whither he had ordered
his letters to be directed, he found one
from Cathcart which related some circum∣stances
in regard to his affairs that con∣vinced
him he could not, unless to the
material injury of some persons who were
connected with him, quit England without
some regulation of those pecuniary con∣cerns
which he had so long neglected and
would now willingly have escaped from.
This letter determined him to return to
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
London; though another letter from his
sister, in which she mentioned, as an article
of news, that Celestina was either actually
married to Montague Thorold or on the
point of being so, threw him into a state
of mind bordering on distraction: reason,
which had long fruitlessly contended
against this fatal, and perhaps guilty attach∣ment,
now seemed tired of a contention so
hopeless, and his mind became a chaos of
conflicting passions, all equally destructive
to his mental and bodily health.</P>
<P>To return to London, however, was be∣come
necessary; and Farnham, his old
faithful servant, persuaded him to take
post chaises for the rest of his journey. He
arrived, after an absence of above three
weeks, at the house of Lady Molyneux;
and there heard, that a few days before,
Lady Horatia Howard had publicly spoken
of Celestina's marriage with the young di∣vine
as a settled thing; that his father had
bought for him a considerable living in
Gloucestershire, where they were to reside,
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
and where a curate was settled till he was
himself qualified to take it; and thither,
as there was a very good house upon it,
they were going immediately after their
marriage. Willoughby heard all this with∣out
being able to make any reply, and then
hastened to his own lodgings, from whence
he dispatched Farnham for intelligence
from the servants of Lady Horatia. The
coachman, with whom he had some time
before made an acquaintance and who was
a very talkative fellow, immediately in∣formed
him of all he knew, and much that
he imagined. He said it was very true,
that Mr. Thorold lived almost always at
their house, "and my Lady," said the
man—"my Lady loves him for all the
world as if he was her own son. There they
are all morning reading play books and,
such together, as my fellow servants tell
me, that is, my Lady and Miss and this
here young divine as is to be; and then
they goes out in my coach, all's one as if
they belonged to the same family; and I
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
do understand as how my Lady is to give
her a portion and they be to be married
out of hand, that is in a little time, and I
believe that's the very truth of the thing,
for my Lady have bought another coach
horse within these ten days, and told me—"Abraham,"
says she, "I shall go early next
month into Gloucestershire, instead of go∣ing
to Matlock as I talked of, and I shall
go in the coach instead of the post chaise,
because I have some friends with me."</P>
<P>This account, which Farnham faithfully
repeated to Willoughby, confirmed almost
beyond a doubt all Lady Molyneux had
related to him. Some more recent intelli∣gence
that he had received from Cathcart as
to the embroiled state of his affairs in the
country, combined to render him despe∣rate:
and he had been so long harrassed be∣tween
his love and his interest, his honour
and his reluctance, that he suddenly took
the resolution of putting it out of his own
power to undergo again such variety of
torments: like a wretch who leaps from a
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
ship on fire into the sea, though certain of
meeting death in another shape, he formed
the determination of making himself, since
he must be wretched, as completely
wretched as possible. He thought of Celes∣tina
as his relation in vain; it abated no∣thing
of that anguish with which he consi∣dered
her as the wife of Montague Thorold;
and so hideous were the images that forced
themselves upon him, that he found his rea∣son
had no power to subdue them, and
thought that nothing could so decidedly
oblige him to check them as his marriage;
and without giving himself time to consider
how desperate was the remedy, he went
immediately to the house of Lord Castle∣north,
declared to him that he was satisfied
as to the object of his journey, and took
the most immediate opportunity after his
return of expressing his solicitude to avail
himself of his cousin's generous predilection
in his favour, and to fulfil the wishes of his
deceased mother and his surviving family.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>
The eager and tremulous manner in which
lie uttered all this, and which was in reality
the effect of despair and anguish, Lord
Castlenorth mistook for the anxiety and im∣patience
of love. His nephew had never
spoke thus decisively before; and seeing
thus what he had so long fondly wished for
out of doubt, his first idea was, to proceed
instantly in securing to Willoughby the
reversion of those titles on which he set so
high a value himself. While, therefore, he
sat out in his chariot, supported by Mrs.
Calder, who always attended him, to solicit
the completion of a business which had hi∣ther
proceeded but slowly, and fancied the
happiness of all parties would be wonder∣fully
advanced by his success, Willoughby,
with such sensations as a determined suicide
alone could envy, was making to Lady
Castlenorth the same declaration; and was
immediately afterwards allowed, or rather
desired, to present himself at the feet of her
fair daughter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>TO play the lover is not difficult to most
men, even where their hearts are not really
interested. A few fine speeches, a little
common place declamation, are easily pro∣duced
and generally accepted: but Wil∣loughby,
always a very poor dissembler,
and who felt, in despite of every effort to
repress them, sentiments towards Miss Fitz-Hayman
bordering on antipathy, was very
conscious that he should ill answer her ideas
of a passionate lover, and this consciousness
deprived him of the little power he might
otherwise have had to dissemble.</P>
<P>He now, with encreased confusion of
thought, repented that he had gone so far;
but to recede was impossible; and with a
countenance expressive rather of perturba∣tion
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
and wretchedness than of the pleasura∣ble
sensations inspired by successful love,
he entered the apartment where Miss Fitz-Hayman
had been prepared by Lady Castle∣north
to receive his tender professions.</P>
<P>He approached her, and took her hand;
muttered something about the final ecclair∣cissement
of his doubts as to another per∣son,
(for he dared not trust his voice with
the name of Celestina), and something
about being, in consequence of that ecclair∣cissement,
released from his former engage∣ments:
then in a still more tremulous and
uncertain tone, he solicited her permission
to dedicate his life to her service, and to
hasten those preparations for his happiness,
which his former uncertainties and embar∣rassments
had put it out of his power to so∣licit
with that ardour which he should un∣der
other circumstances have evinced.</P>
<P>The falsehood he was uttering died away
almost inarticulately on his lips, and his re∣volting
heart reproached him for it, faint and
reluctantas it was. As he finished his speech,
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
Miss Fitz-Hayman turned her large black
eyes, which had till then been modestly
cast down, full upon him. She seemed to
have been trying to make them speak ten∣derness;
but to him they expressed nothing
but an imperious enquiry into the truth of
his professions, from which he shrunk. In
a moment, however, those eyes, so little
calculated for the soft parley of affection,
contrived to overflow with tears. She gave
him the hand he had just before let go, and
inclining her head tenderly towards him,
said, in terms as gentle as she could com∣mand—"Oh!
Willoughby! you know
too well, you have long known my unfor∣tunate
partiality towards you—a partiality,
which, with reluctance and with regret I
own, not all your too evident coldness has
conquered. Alas! could I now believe
you sincere!—"</P>
<P>"Believe it I conjure you," cried he in
a hurried voice, and hastening to put an
end to a dialogue which he found he could
so ill support—"Believe it, dear Madam!
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
and believe, (what is true also)—that I
have now no other engagement—no other
attachment—and cannot but be—be truly
sensible of your extraordinary merit."</P>
<P>"I will believe it," answered she: "I
will endeavour to believe it, for I find, that
even if I am deceived, the deceit is dear to
me."</P>
<P>Willoughby then kissed her hand with
as much warmth as he could affect; and
running over, in the breathless tremor which
consciousness of his disingenuous conduct
occasioned, a few common place sentences
about eternal gratitude and unalterable
love; speeches which have probably been
repeated ten million of times with as little
sincerity but seldom with so much self re∣proof,
he led her to talk of preparations,
and equipages, and jewels; subjects on which
she entered with such ease as shewed that
her mind had been familiarized to consider
them, and that they were not without im∣portance
in her opinion. Poor Willough∣by,
who now felt his fate irretrievable, had
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
very different sensations. Oppressed and
bewildered by a variety of sufferings, yet
compelled, by the part he had thus rashly
determined to act, to stifle them all, his
prevailing idea was, that since the Rubicon
was now passed, the sooner this dreaded
marriage was over the better for him; since
his mind must then combat, with more force
than it could now do, those wild eccentri∣cities,
the offspring of despair, which were
crouding fast upon him. He therefore
pressed for an early day; not with the vehe∣mence
of love, but with that of a wretch
who knowing he must die, wishes to hear
his physician fix the period when his tor∣ments
are likely to end. Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
however, either could not or would
not discover this; and though his inflamed
eyes, his short sighs, unsettled manner, and
broken sentences, gave him altogether the
appearance rather of a man suffering under
some recent calamity than of a favoured and
fortunate lover on the point of obtaining his
happiness, the lady, either from her confi∣dence
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
in her own charms, or from some
other cause, was perfectly satisfied with his
behaviour; and before he left her, pro∣mised
that she would not oppose the ar∣rangement
which she understood to have
been made by her father—that in three
weeks he should receive her hand.</P>
<P>This then was determined without possi∣bility
of recall; and Willoughby, too sensi∣ble
already of the weight of those chains
which he had thus hastily forged for him∣self,
now disengaged himself as soon as
possible, and ran out of the house, impa∣tient
to be alone, and to contemplate in
the stillness of his own room the prospect of
misery into which he had thus rashly bound
himself to rush. He walked very fast, and
as if he was flying from himself, towards
his lodgings in Bond-street, where, as he
passed along it, a croud of passengers near
one of the crossings impeded his passage.
He regarded them not; but made his way
eagerly among them, till he was imme∣diately
between a footman who waited at
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
the door of a coach, and a young lady who
was coming out of a shop to step into it.
On his pressing rather hastily before her,
the servant put him back with his hand.
Willoughby, out of humour at that mo∣ment
with himself and with all the world,
and fancying the action of the footman
impertinent, spoke to him very harshly and
was almost provoked to strike him, when
the lady, who had her foot on the step, ap∣peared
a good deal alarmed, and no sooner
heard the sound of his voice thus menacing,
than she caught the servant's arm for sup∣port;
and at the same moment Willough∣by,
who had not till then seen her face, be∣held
the lovely but pale and terrified coun∣tenance
of Celestina!</P>
<P>Thrown entirely off his guard, and not
knowing what he did, he took the hand
with which she had supported herself against
the servant. "Celestina!" cried he—"Oh
God! is it you, Celestina?"</P>
<P>She looked at him with eyes where sur∣prise
was softened by tenderness, and tried
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
to recover voice enough to utter more
than—"Willoughby!" which the imme∣diate
emotion drew from her: but he gave
her not time; for fixing his eyes on her's,
all that she had been to him, all that he be∣lieved
she was now to another, and all
that he had just agreed to be himself,
rushed upon his recollection at once,
and in an agony of grief, remorse, and de∣spair,
he threw her hand from him, and
turning away, he walked, or rather ran
towards his lodgings as if he had been pur∣sued
by the furies, where, without giving
his servant time to open it, he rapped at
the door with violence enough to break it
down; so fearful he seemed of again seeing
Celestina as she passed in the coach, which,
by the horses being in that direction, would,
he thought, come that way.</P>
<P>Farnham, his servant, who opened the
door, was amazed at his impatience so un∣like
his usual manner, and with still more
surprise saw him, instead of speaking and
enquiring for letters, as he always did when
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
he came in, and was particularly likely now
to do after so long an absence, rush by him
as if he had not seen him; and hurrying up
stairs by two steps at a time, shut the door
of the dining room with a violence that
shook the whole house, and turn the key.</P>
<P>This faithful servant had lived with him
from the time of his leaving school, and
was more attached to his master than to any
other person on earth. He had seen with
deep concern the sad change that had hap∣pened
in his health and in his temper, since
that unfortunate night when he so suddenly
left Alvestone the year before, and had, in
all his journies and all his illness, watched
over him with assiduous and attentive care.
He had often known him dejected, and al∣most
sinking under his uncertainties and his
disappointments, but had never till now ob∣served
such fury in his eyes and marks of
desperation in his manner; and alarmed at
the circumstance of his having locked the
door of his room, Farnham was immediately
beset with numberless fearful conjectures.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65"/>
He was aware that his master's affairs were
far from being prosperous, and imagined it
possible that he might be pursued for debt:
and as he knew his pride would render such
a thing almost insupportable, he feared least
in the sudden agony to which it might sub∣ject
him, he might commit some violence
on himself. Willoughby's temper was na∣turally
very mild, and not easily inflamed
to anger; but when that did happen, his
anger was dreadful; and though Farnham
had only once or twice seen it excited dur∣ing
his long service, he knew how terrible
it was when thoroughly roused.</P>
<P>The conjectures that Farnham enter∣tained
were not to be supported calmly;
and though he had always received strict
orders never to enter the room where his
master was busy, till he rang or called for
him, he was now strongly tempted, yet
dared not determine to disobey his com∣mands.
He could not, however, forbear
going to the door and listening. He heard
his master utter deep and convulsive sighs:
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
he heard him walking by starts in the room;
but, by the key's being left in the lock, he
could see nothing. He then went softly
into the bed chamber; and from thence a
defect in the door, which opened from it
into the dining room, enabled him to distin∣guish
that Willoughby now sat by a table
on which his arms were thrown, and on
them he rested his head; while his hair, all
in disorder, concealed every part of his
face: then in a moment starting up, he
traversed the room with quick and uncer∣tain
steps, now clasping his hands together,
now throwing them wildly abroad. At
length he stopped, and striking his fore∣head,
said, in a voice rather resembling
groaning than speaking—"Oh accursed,
accursed wretch!—what hast thou done!"</P>
<P>Still more alarmed by these words, and
by beholding the frantic gestures with which
his master now leaned against the side of
the chimney, now flew to the other side of
the room, and now threw himself on a so∣pha,
Farnham again debated with himself
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
whether he should not go in at any event.
There was a <HI>couteau de chasse</HI> and a sword
hung up in the room, and two brace of
pistols in their cases, which Farnham had
just put there, loaded as they were when his
master travelled; and the poor fellow fan∣cied
that on these, whenever he passed
them, his master looked wildly eager.
This might be some time fancy: but at
length, either from accident or from his
feeling at that instant some horrible tempta∣tion
to escape from the evils that just then
appeared quite intolerable, Willoughby
stopped with folded arms opposite to these
instruments of destruction, and while his
expressive countenance was marked with
the severest anguish, he murmured inarti∣culately
some words which Farnham inter∣preted
as a determination to put an end to
his sufferings. Bent at any hazard to pre∣vent
his executing this fearful threat, the
affrighted servant now searched with trem∣bling
hands for the lock, which he forgot
he could not open. His master demanded,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
in a voice which struck him with terror,
who was there? when luckily for him a
thundering rap at the street door gave him
hopes that some visitors might be coming
who might more properly and effectually
interfere, and he flew down to let them in,
regardless of Willoughby, who, coming
out to the top of the stairs, called to him,
and peremptorily ordered him to admit no∣body.</P>
<P>It was Sir Philip Molyneux; who hav∣ing
just met Lord Castlenorth at the Minis∣ter's
levee, had heard from him that Wil∣loughby,
immediately on his arrival in
town, had agreed to the conclusion of his
marriage; and that in consequence of it he
had himself been attending the levee to has∣ten
the affair of the reversionary titles, which,
affair was likely to be speedily concluded.
Sir Philip, therefore, having received this
intelligence, called as he went home to
congratulate his brother in law, and to take
him to dinner in Portman-square.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69"/>
Little accustomed as Sir Philip was to
make remarks on any body's appearance,
and particularly on that of his inferiors, he
was not withstanding struck with the coun∣tenance
of Farnham, as, pale and aghast,
he opened the door to him; and as he went
before him up stairs, he enquired what ailed
him. "I hardly know indeed Sir," replied
Farnham: "but my master, who came
from Barnet only early this morning as you
know I suppose Sir, off his Yorkshire jour∣ney,
has been out somewhere since, and is
come home in such a humour as I am sure
I have never seen him in in all the years I
have lived with him: be so good, Sir,
however, as not to take notice that I spoke
about it."</P>
<P>Sir Philip had no time to promise he
would not, before they were at the door of
the dining room, where Willoughby stood
and sternly said to his servant—"How dare
you, Sir, disobey me in this manner? did
I not tell you, stupid hound, that I would
not be at home?"</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
"Lord, Sir," cried Farmham in great
distress, for he was little accustomed and
could hardly bear to be thus harshly re∣proved—"Lord,
Sir—it is only Sir Phi∣lip—and
I am sure I thought—"</P>
<P>"Curse on your thoughts!" cried Wil∣loughby.
"Blockhead—are you to think
for me?"</P>
<P>"Hey day!" said Sir Philip, "what's
all this? Don't be angry with poor Farn∣ham.
I would come in, for I was impatient
to wish you joy."</P>
<P>"Joy, Sir?—of what?"</P>
<P>"Why I have this moment seen Lord
Castlenorth, who has told me that every thing
is settled at last. Come, I'm very glad to
hear it, for it must be owned that this busi∣ness,
George, has advanced but slowly.
Well! so now 'tis to be done directly?
The old peer was quite frisky upon it, and
forgot his asthma and his gout to stand till
I was tired of hearing him, telling me of
the regulation he had made as to your
name: he becomes Earl and Viscount Cas∣tlenorth;
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
and you take, as your title, that
of Baron Ravensburgh. I heard the history
too of how that came into the family.
Well, but George, you'll go dine with us.
Lady Molyneux will be glad, perhaps, to
hear about it, and to wish you joy."</P>
<P>"Joy—damnation rather!" muttered
Willoughby, as, snatching away his hand,
he fled to the other end of the room: then
by an effort recovering himself a little, he
returned towards Sir Philip, and said, with
forced calmness—"Prythee don't teize me
with these hateful common place congratu∣lations.
Surely it is bad enough for a fellow
to be forced to hear them afterwards, and
indeed bad enough to be married, without
having them rung in his ears for a month
before hand."</P>
<P>Sir Philip, who now saw very plainly that
his reluctance was by no means subdued,
had no inclination to argue the matter with
him. He had no idea why he might not be
happy with Miss Fitz-Hayman or any other
woman of equal fortune: but whether he
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
was so or no, his own solicitude went no
further than that his brother in law might
not be reduced either to a state of indigence
such as might disgrace his alliance or com∣pel
him to borrow money of his relations;
and as Willoughby's marriage with Miss
Fitz-Hayman would preclude the possibility
of any such awkward circumstances, he
heartily wished it, and had of late forgot
his usual apathy to join with his wife in pro∣moting
it.</P>
<P>There was, he thought, no occasion for
argument in the present case, since the af∣fair
was now, whether Willoughby liked it
or no, irrevocably fixed upon. He there∣fore
spared himself the fatigue of remarks or
remonstrance on Willoughby's behaviour,
and only said—"But you'll dine with us,
George, to-day—will you not?"</P>
<P>"No, I cannot," replied Willoughby.</P>
<P>"To-morrow then. We shall have a
large party, and dine exactly at seven o'clock.</P>
<P>"I will if I can. But I can engage for
nothing. I hate to be fettered by engage∣ments:
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
but if I can come I will. Shall I
ring for your servants?"</P>
<P>"They are at the door," said Sir Philip,
who immediately went away, without hav∣ing
any great reason to be satisfied with the
politeness of his brother in law. Of that,
however, he thought not; and if the beha∣viour
of Willoughby afterwards occurred to
him at all, it only created a momentary
surprise, mingled with some degree of pity,
which his absurdity, and not his evident
unhappiness, excited.</P>
<P>His visit, however, had the effect of
rousing Willoughby from that dreadful con∣dition
of mind into which the step he had
taken that morning in regard to Miss Fitz-Hayman,
and the sudden sight of Celestina,
had thrown him. He now became able to
collect his thoughts; and was at once con∣scious
of the general folly of his conduct,
and of his cruel behaviour to Farnham,
who was so hurt by having seen his master
in such a state, and by the unkind and un∣usual
way in which he had spoke to him,
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
that when the poor fellow came up to en∣quire
if he would please to dress, the tears
were in his eyes, and he was hardly able to
speak.</P>
<P>Willoughby was of too noble a nature
not to apologise for his fault the moment
he felt it. He answered mildly that he
should dress directly, and then said—"Farnham,
I spoke angrily to you just
now, and I am sorry for it. I was vexed,
and could not command my temper. You
were wrong too in letting in Sir Philip
Molyneux. Another time remember, that
when I give orders to be denied I except
nobody unless I particularly name them."</P>
<P>Poor Farnham dared not say why he
then ventured to disobey him; but in the
most humble terms begged his pardon and
said he was very sorry. "Well, well," cried
Willoughby, with a deep sigh, "and I
am very sorry, Farnham, that I was so
foolishly passionate. Let us think no more
of it." He then bade him get his things to
dress, and tried, by taking up a book, to
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
divert his thoughts from himself, and ob∣tain
at least a respite from the corrosive re∣flections
that pursued him; but it would not
do: he threw the book away, and felt, not∣withstanding
all his efforts, his wretched∣ness
and impatience returning: while Farn∣ham,
who as he dressed his hair watched
every turn of his countenance, saw but too
plainly that his master was half distracted
by something into which he dared not en∣quire.
This gave a sort of unquiet flow∣ness
to his manner, which Willoughby ob∣serving,
was on the point of relapsing into
that sort of behaviour for which he had but
the moment before expressed his sorrow,
and impetuously bade him mind what he
was about and make haste: then hardly
suffering him to finish his hair, he started
up, and putting on his cloaths in the haste
that denoted the unquietness of his mind,
he sent for a hackney coach, and ordered it
to set him down at the hotel in Soho-square.
Farnham still apprehending that some fatal
event might follow all the agitation of
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
mind which he had witnessed, now ap∣proached
again, and asked if he should be
at home in the evening, or sup at home?
To which Willoughby, no longer able to
check himself, answered—"no!" as he
drew up the glass, in an accent that terrified
poor Farnham; who, more and more con∣firmed
in his notion that something was
about to befall his master, now concluded
that something was a duel. The pistols
and the sword indeed were still hanging up
in the dining room: but yet he could not
be easy; and, after some consideration, he
determined to go and enquire among the
servants at Sir Philip Molyneux's and at
Lord Castlenorth's if they could at all
guess what was the matter; and with most
of the latter he was particularly acquainted,
by having been much with them at Flo∣rence
and Naples when his master was last
abroad.</P>

<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IF Willoughby was so deeply affected
by the sight of Celestina, the sudden shock
she had received from their abrupt meeting,
and from his strange behaviour, had on her
an equally painful though a different ef∣fect.
That the impulse of the moment had
urged him to take her hand, made her hope
that some remains of affection for her yet
lingered in his bosom, and that his former
regard was rather stifled by anger than an∣nihilated
by indifference. She knew that
the first might be removed, and that she
might be restored to his friendship; but
that if his heart had once become quite cold
towards her, nothing could ever renew even
that share of tenderness with which she could
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
learn, if not to be happy, at least to be con∣tent.</P>
<P>It was some time before she could reco∣ver
from the agitation of spirits into which
this unexpected interview had thrown her:
but when she at length became calm
enough to reflect on it, she determined to
say nothing of having seen Willoughby to
Lady Horatia, as she knew it would ap∣pear
to her only a fresh instance of his un∣worthy
treatment of her; on which, how
severely soever she felt it, she did not love
to hear any comments even from her best
friends. With all the resolution she could
collect, therefore, stifling her internal an∣guish,
she prepared to go with a large
party in the evening to Ranelagh.</P>
<P>While she was dressing for this purpose,
a servant brought up to her the following
letter:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>That a stranger, and a stranger in my
situation of life, should address you,
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
would possibly appear, to any less gene∣rous
mind than your's, a liberty that
should be repulsed with disdain and re∣sented
by contempt: but I am persuaded
that from you <HI>I</HI> may expect that liberal
candour with which true virtue and un∣affected
goodness considers even those
whom the generality of the world agree
to condemn and despise.</P>
<P>You know, Madam, what I have
been and what I am. From Mrs. El∣phinstone
you have probably learned
what were the circumstances of my
early life; and Mr. Vavasour, with that
sincerity which deserves to be so highly
valued, has told you how long I have
been under his protection.</P>
<P>He has since, Madam, expressed
somefears that this information may have
been prejudicial to his interest with you,
and least it should be so, allow me to
declare to you, that I know myself too
well to believe for a moment that I ought
to be in question where you are beloved
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
—too well to hesitate in declaring, that
attached as I am to Mr. Vavasour, <HI>I</HI> can
never make him as happy as he deserves
to be.</P>
<P>No, Madam; that happiness depends
entirely on you. Such a passion as he
feels for you, I believe no other person
can deserve; and I know him to have
so good a heart, I desire his felicity so
sincerely, that I hazard this step in the
hope of promoting it.</P>
<P>Mr. Vavasour's generosity has left me
nothing to fear for the rest of my life,
were it even to be a long one: but I feel
that a very few months will bring it to
an end; and I feel it without concern;
for, thoughtless and unworthy as my con∣duct
has been, I have never found in
its most brilliant periods, that the glitter∣ing
trappings bestowed by mercenary
love, could quiet the throbbing heart
that beat beneath them: and now my
only wish is, to be forgiven and re∣ceived
by my family, and to pass the
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
short remainder of my days with them.
You can intercede with them success∣fully,
for they can refuse you nothing.
Deign then, Madam, to interest your∣self
for me, and at the same time be as∣sured
that it is my purpose to withdraw
myself for ever from Mr. Vavasour,
whenever he will suffer me to go, which
shall, he says, be whenever you will give
him hopes of listening to him.</P>
<P>If generosity, sincerity, good nature,
and understanding, may be sufficient re∣commendations
to your good opinion,
Mr. Vavasour eminently deserves it;
and whatever faults he may have, your
virtues will correct. He knows no∣thing
of my writing to you; but I am
conscious that I owe <HI>him</HI> such an effort
where the felicity of his future days is
concerned, and I feel that in addressing
<HI>you,</HI> my presumption if not successful
will be forgiven.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>your most obedient servant,
EMILY CATHCART.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82"/>
Celestina could not peruse such a letter
without a mixture of admiration and pity
for the amiable unhappy writer. Though
her resolution in regard to Vavasour could
not be changed, she thought that she should
no longer delay acquainting Mrs. Elphin∣stone
and Cathcart with the information she
had obtained relative to their sister; but it
required some consideration, at least in re∣gard
to Cathcart. The circumstance of
Emily's letter added to the flutter of spirits
which the meeting in the morning had
given her. Montague Thorold, who dined
with Lady Horatia, and was to be one of
their party at Ranelagh, contrived to be
more than usually importunate with her
for more pity and favour than she had lately
shewn him: while the ladies, and Mr.How∣ard,
who joined them in the evening, com∣pleted
her anguish and confusion, by talk∣ing.
of the marriage which was in a few days
to take place between Miss Fitz-Hayman
and Mr. Willoughby. One of these was
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
acquainted with Mrs. Calder, and had
heard from her that morning that every
thing was settled, the title arranged, the
equipages and liveries bespoke, and the
jewels and cloaths concluded upon, all of
which she detailed at great length; while
another said, that <HI>she</HI> understood that the
marriage was to take place at Castlenorth,
and that from thence all the family were to
proceed together to Italy, where they were
to pass a twelvemonth. All, however,
agreed that it was certainly to be concluded
immediately, and Celestina could not any
longer entertain a doubt of it.</P>
<P>Though her heart had always revolted
from the idea of Willoughby's union with
Miss Fitz-Hayman, she had been now so
long accustomed to think of it, that she
felt less poignant concern on that account,
but if possible more than ever from his
continued coldness, and the cruel neg∣lect
he had been guilty of in not answer∣ing
her letter. "That he marries ano∣ther,"
cried she, as she reflected on it, "I
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
might learn to submit to without murmur∣ing,
if it can contribute to his ease or hap∣piness
in any way; but that he should quite
desert and forsake me after so many assur∣ances
of esteem and regard, even when
love was no longer in question; that he
should disdain to own that connection by
blood, if he is sure that it is so, which made
him, with so much apparent reluctance,
relinquish every other, that he should with∣out
pity leave me to a destiny which owes
its unhappiness to him, seems so strange,
so unnatural, so unlike him!—If I could
once see him, hear him talk to me with
friendly calmness, and tell me that he felt
for me fraternal affection, or even the re∣gard
of long acquaintance, even what his
mother's ward might claim from him, I
think I should be comparatively happy, and
should have no farther wish than to hear
sometimes from himself that he was happy
too. But to be thrown from him in this
unfeeling and unfriendly way, to be for∣gotten
and abandoned as if I had been
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
found unworthy not only of his affection
but of his remembrance—oh! it is too
much."</P>
<P>These reflections, and the uninteresting
conversation of the company she was with,
to which she was compelled to attend in
order to escape the more irksome importu∣nity
of Montague Thorold, served but lit∣tle
to raise her spirits. They did not reach
Ranelagh till a late hour: but on their en∣trance,
the first party they met was Lady
Castlenorth, her daughter, and Lady Mo∣lyneux.
Captain Cavanaugh was on one
side between the two former; and in deep
conference with the latter was Captain Tho∣rold.</P>
<P>The ladies, who could not avoid seeing
Celestina, passed her with averted and
haughty looks. Cavanaugh fixed his eyes
on her with a look of bold enquiry, and
Captain Thorold, as he passed his brother,
said—"Ho! Montague, are you there? I
did not know you were in town my boy!"
He then gave a significant nod, as much
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
as to say—"Aye, aye, I see how you are
engaged," and passed on, renewing with
great seeming earnestness his conversation
with Lady Molyneux.</P>
<P>Though there was not in the world ano∣ther
set of people whom Celestina could be
so little pleased to meet, and though she
heard throughout the room, and from every
group that passed them, the report of Wil∣loughby's
marriage, with various comments
and circumstances, such as every body
thought themselves at liberty to adorn it
with, she felt a sort of satisfaction in seeing
that he was not with them; and while there
was not any thing she really so ardently de∣sired
as his happiness, yet so contradictory
is the human heart, that she wished to be∣lieve
he married Miss Fitz-Hayman reluc∣tantly,
though a marriage under such cir∣cumstances
must above all other things ren∣der
him miserable.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, elated more than
ever by hope, and encouraged to persevere
by Lady Horatia, having now too, in con∣sequence
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
of the purchase his father had
made for him, more pretensions to aspire to
her than his unsettled fortune had before
given him; and sanguinely interpreting her
gentle refusals, her friendly admonitions to
desist, as giving him all the encouragement
she could do, while her fate in regard to
Willoughby was not absolutely decided;
was on this evening particularly pressing
and earnest; while her languor and weari∣ness,
the encouragement which she was
conscious she seemed to have given him,
her pity and even her regard for him, with
the certainty of his ardent love for her, gave
her altogether the air of listening to him fa∣vourably;
and while her mind was fre∣quently
fixed on Willoughby, and she
hardly recollected that Montague Thorold
was talking to her, she seemed to be hear∣ing
the latter with complacency, and ap∣proving
of conversation which it was not
necessary for her to answer.</P>
<P>At length the short time Lady Horatia
meant to pass at Ranelagh was over. She
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
was fatigued, and Celestina rejoiced to
hear her say she should go home. As
Montague Thorold and Mr. Howard were
with them, the other gentlemen remained
with the ladies who intended to stay longer;
and Lady Horatia taking the arm of her
relation, left Celestina to the care of Mon∣tague
Thorold; and they were in this order
proceeding towards the entrance, when
standing near one of the niches, his hat
over his eyes, and his head leaning against
the wall, they saw themselves close to Wil∣loughby,
who was, in that attitude, listening
to some very earnest conversation from Va∣vasour,
who stood by him.</P>
<P>The croud about the entrance was con∣siderable;
and Celestina, holding by the
arm of Montague Thorold, was so near
them, that they both at the same moment
saw her. Willoughby started as if he had
been crossed by a spectre; and without
waiting to look a second time, he pushed
through the croud and disappeared; but
Vavasour came up to Celestina, and said
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
in his usual way, taking abruptly the hand
that was at liberty—"You must give <HI>me</HI>
leave, Miss De Mornay, to see you to your
carriage."</P>
<P>Celestina, dreading to give occasion to
any thing like altercation between him and
Thorold, answered coldly but civilly, that
she thanked him; but Thorold, who had
not forgotten or forgiven the mortification
she received from him at York and on
other occasions, could not now help resent∣ing
what seemed to be a repetition of such
insulting behaviour. He therefore, walk∣ing
very hastily on with Celestina, said—"No,
Sir, there is no occasion for you to
give yourself that trouble; for Miss De
Mornay is under my care."</P>
<P>"I did not mean, Sir," replied Vava∣sour
fiercely, "to ask your leave to wait on
this lady; and I beg you will not take the
liberty to address yourself to me."</P>
<P>"Pray, Mr. Vavasour," said Celestina,
trembling, "do not persecute and terrify
me with this sort of behaviour." She then
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
saw by his countenance, and by the eager
way in which he grasped the hand he held,
that he was very far from being sober, and
her terror encreased.</P>
<P>"I did not mean to persecute or terrify
you," cried he: "no, by heaven! But
damme if I can with any temper see that fel∣low
always at your ear, and affecting to be
favoured. Come, come, leave the pedant
to his meditations, and don't forsake your
old friends. The petticoats that he is to
wear are his protection."</P>
<P>"And this lady's presence, Sir," said
Thorold, "is your's, or be assured I should
answer you in a very different way."</P>
<P>Celestina, now alarmed even to agony by
the menacing look of Vavasour, who quitted
her hand and stepped before Thorold,
screamed out to Mr. Howard and Lady
Horatia; but the croud had so far divided
them from her, that neither heard her, and
before she could effectually interfere to pre∣vent
it, such words had passed between
Vavasour and Thorold, as nothing but blood
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
is, by the laws of honour, suppposed to
atone for. Celestina, who heard them in
affright not to be described, now disengaged
herself from both of them, and not know∣ing
what she did, only having some con∣fused
idea that she might meet Captain
Thorold in the room, she ran back thither
alone.</P>
<P>Her beauty and her terror, whether it
was thought real or affected, gave her, in
the opinion of the first groups she met, the
appearance of some young creature desirous
to attract attention. Three or four young
men surrounded her, and enquired what
service they could do her. Breathless and
ready to faint, she answered that she was in
search of Captain Thorold.</P>
<P>"Egad," cried one of them, "Captain
Thorold is a devilish lucky fellow."</P>
<P>"And a very tasteless one," said ano∣ther,
"to leave such a lovely creature to
seek for him."</P>
<P>Celestina now understood how entirely
they mistook her; and collecting some pre∣sence
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
of mind, said—"For heaven's sake,
gentlemen, assist me to find him. His
brother is engaged in a quarrel: a quarrel,
I fear, on my account—and—"</P>
<P>She would have gone on, but unhappily
for her the party of men who surrounded
her were all of that description which are
called bucks, who fancy they distinguish
themselves by shewing how little they de∣serve
the character of men. One or two of
these hearing of a quarrel, found they had
no disposition to engage where there might
be trouble or danger, and therefore walked
away; but three others had now time to
consider the eminent beauty of Celestina,
and to have settled in their own minds that
she was a girl without character, which her
being alone, and even what she had told
them of a quarrel on her account, seemed
to authorise: they were therefore all deter∣mined
not to let her go; and far from
thinking of relieving the terror in which
they saw her, and which they indeed be∣lieved
to be a mere piece of acting, two
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
of them took her arms within theirs, and
held with her such discourse as encreased
her alarm almost to distraction. She now
knew not what she said. Terror for herself
had so mingled itself with her fears of what
might happen between Vavasour and Tho∣rold,
that she sometimes angrily entreated
her persecutors to release her, then humbly
besought them to see for Captain Thorold,
till at length, as they led her again towards
the door, her fears were become insup∣portable,
and shrieking, she entreated them
rather to kill her than expose her to such
horror as she felt. At this moment, how∣ever,
by a sudden spring, she disengaged
herself: Willoughby was returning alone
along the passage: she saw him, and threw
herself into his arms.</P>
<P>"Save me, save me, Willoughby!" was
all she could utter, before, quite overcome
with variety of terrors, she became almost
senseless; her head resting on his shoulder,
and his arms supporting her.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
He looked sternly on the young men,
and demanded the occasion of the lady's
alarm. They replied that they knew no∣thing
more than that she had run into the
room alone, enquiring for a Captain some∣body,
and that they had endeavoured to
find the cause of her fright and to assist her.
Willoughby, who did not believe this, but
who was more solicitous to recover the
fainting Celestina than to punish these idle
boys, waved with his hand for them to be
gone, and they immediately obeyed; for
it was the defenceless only they had courage
to insult. Willoughby then, by the assist∣ance
of a gentleman whom he happened to
know, led Celestina, who was just sensible,
into the room where the ladies cloaks are
received; and while his friend ran to get
her a glass of water, Willoughby placed
himself by her, and with one hand round
her waist, supported her with the other;
nor could he forbear, as he gazed on her
pale but still lovely countenance, pressing
her to that heart which had been so long
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
fondly devoted to her. In a very short
time she drew a deep sigh; and recovering
recollection, begged his pardon, in a voice
hardly articulate, for the trouble she had
given him. She remembered that to the
husband, the lover of Miss Fitz-Hayman,
it must be trouble, and she withdrew her∣self
from his arms before he could ask her,
(so absorbed was he in the mingled sensa∣tions
of pain and pleasure,) what had occa∣sioned
the alarm in which he had seen her.
With a sigh still deeper than her's, he now
made this enquiry. She answered, but not
very distinctly, that high words had arisen
between Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Montague
Thorold, and that not able to check their
impetuosity, nor to overtake Lady Horatia
and Mr. Howard, who were gone on be∣fore,
she had foolishly run back into the
room to find somebody who might part
them, when those young men had sur∣rounded
and insulted her, till in her fear she
knew not what she did.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96"/>
"And all this terror—all this excessive
apprehension, was for Mr. Montague Tho∣rold?"
said Willoughby, in a faultering
but not a tender voice: then, as if he had
discovered nothing but what he had before
known enough of to be easy under, he
seemed at once to repress all appearance of
interest as far as it related to Celestina, and
said, with forced coldness—"I dare say,
Madam, you have nothing to apprehend
for his precious life. However, I will seek
my friend Vavasour, and take care at least
for to-night that it goes no farther, if you
will tell me where I can find him, and whi∣ther
I shall have the honour of conducting you."</P>
<P>Celestina was heart struck by the manner
in which this was uttered. She turned her
expressive eyes on his, to enquire whether
he could really behave thus cruelly towards
her; his eyes met her's; but as if he could
not bear her looks he turned them away
towards the door, where his friend now en∣tered,
with the water, and almost at the
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
same moment Mr. Howard came in, and
told her that Lady Horatia had been in
great alarm at her not following her to the
coach, where she now waited for her. She
did not give him time to finish the sentence,
before she eagerly asked if he had seen Mr.
Montague Thorold.</P>
<P>"Seen him," cried Mr. Howard; "no
certainly. Is he not with you?"</P>
<P>Celestina would then have related what
had happened; but her returning appre∣hensions
that something fatal might have
already been the consequence, and the look
with which Willoughby surveyed her, en∣tirely
deprived her of the power of speech;
and Willoughby himself in a few words re∣lated
to Mr. Howard what she had told
him. "I do not know," added he, "what
ground Miss de Mornay has had for the
alarm she has been in; but I know Vavasour
was not sober, and possibly may have been
wrong headed: it will therefore be neces∣sary
perhaps for me to enquire after him;
and as you Madam, seem to be now re∣covered,
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
and are safe in the protection of
Mr. Howard, I will wish you good night."
Having hurried over these words, he bowed
to Mr. Howard, then with equal coolness
to Celestina, and disappeared.</P>
<P>A shower of tears, the first she had been
able to shed, fell from the eyes of Celestina
as she lost sight of him. These tears how∣ever,
and the water she had drank, a little
relieved her; and Mr. Howard again re∣presenting
the uneasiness in which he had
left Lady Horatia, she collected strength
enough to avail herself of the assistance he
offered her; and leaning on his arm,
reached the coach, where she was compelled,
however unequal to the recital, to relate to
Lady Horatia what had happened within
the twenty minutes, (for more had not
elapsed,) that she had lost sight of her.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia expressed great apprehen∣sions
for Montague Thorold; and thought,
with great appearance of truth, that unless
he had gone immediately away with Vava∣sour
to decide their difference that evening,
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
he would have sought them again, and have
relieved them from the extreme apprehen∣sions
which he must imagine they must be
under on his account.—These conjectures,
which were but too well founded, and which
they had no means of satisfying, kept Lady
Horatia and Celestina awake the whole night:
towards morning, the former, who was less
deeply interested; and more accustomed to
the painful events of life than Celestina,
found some repose; but Celestina herself
was up by break of day, listening to every
noise in the street, and trembling every mo∣ment
least she should hear of some fatal acci∣dent:
and her reflections, which no longer
offered her any thing to hope, were busy in
representing and magnifying all the evils
which she had to apprehend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE cruel suspense as to the extraordi∣nary
disappearance of Montague Thorold
with Vavasour the evening before, lasted till
near ten o'clock; when, as Lady Horatia
and Celestina were sitting at a breakfast∣table,
where the uneasiness they were both
under did not allow them to eat, a ser∣vant
announced Captain Thorold.—Celes∣tina
turned pale as death at the name; but
there was no time to express any part of the
fear she felt before he entered.</P>
<P>His air was assuming, confident, and what
the French call <HI>glorieux.</HI> But from that Ce∣lestina
could judge nothing; for she knew
he had too little regard for his brother to have
been much affected at any thing that might
have befallen him. He paid his compliments
in the common form to Lady Horatia, who
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
was too much concerned to be able to answer
them; and then turning to the silent, trem∣bling
Celestina, he said, with an unfeeling
smile, "Well, Madam, your young cham∣pion
is living."</P>
<P>"Good God," cried Celestina, "has he
ever then been in danger?" "Yes," replied
the Captain, "he has been in all the danger
that a man can be who has a brace of pistols
fired at him; and is now in as much as is
usual to a man who has a ball lodged in his
shoulder."</P>
<P>Celestina could not speak; she could with
difficulty breathe: but Lady Horatia now
eagerly enquired the particulars, and learned,
that in consequence of violent language
that passed between Vavasour and Montague
Thorold, after Celestina left them the pre∣ceding
evening, a challenge had passed, and
a meeting been appointed in Chelsea Fields, at
seven o'clock in the morning;—that Thorold,
after quitting Vavasour, had in vain endea∣voured
to find out Lady Horatia and Ce∣lestina,
and meeting his brother, and relating
to him what had happened, was by him dis∣suaded
from attempting it, as he could not
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
see them without informing them of what
had passed, and was yet to happen; that he
had therefore gone home with Captain Tho∣rold,
who had, at the appointed time, attended
him to the field, where Vavasour was with a
friend; and where, the preliminaries being
soon settled, each fired without effect; but
neither declaring themselves satisfied, they
fired again, and Montague Thorold received
a ball in his shoulder, which was not extracted
when his brother left him at his lodgings,
whither he was immediately conveyed, and
where he was attended by an eminent surgeon.
"And is he in danger, Sir," said Celestina,
with all that tremulous tenderness in her
voice that her extreme sensibility gave her—"Is
he in danger? is he in pain?"</P>
<P>Captain Thorold gave her a look which
seemed to say "Humph"—it <HI>is</HI> true, then, that
you are violently in love with this, brother of
mine: and then, answered—"The surgeon,
on whose skill I have great reason to rely,
does not seem to think him in danger; but
till the ball is extracted, which will be attend∣ed
with pain enough, it is not, I fancy, easy
to speak very positively.—However, Miss de
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
Mornay, Montague wont complain of the
pain, let it be as severe as it will, while he
recollects that he suffers in your defence, and
hears, what I shall not fail to relate, how
dearly you are interested for him."</P>
<P>Celestina could not say that this unlucky
affair did not originate about her; indeed,
she had not at that moment strength to enter
on any explanation; nor could she deny, that
she was extremely concerned, or make Cap∣tain
Thorold comprehend that for a stranger,
under the same circumstances, she should have
been greatly, if not equally sorry:—As to
Lady Horatia, who hoped that this accident
would operate decisively on behalf of Mon∣tague,
she rather encouraged than contra∣dicted
the idea that his brother seemed to
entertain of Celestina's partiality towards him:
And now the Captain, with as much uncon∣cern
as if nothing had happened, seemed only
desirous of displaying his own consequence
and his own perfections: as if to convince
them both, that for a woman, who had ever
seen him and his brother together, to prefer
the latter, was an instance of most terrible want
of discernment. Several times was Celestina,
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
who could hardly support herself, on the point
of withdrawing; but she thought, that were
she to quit the room, it would look still more
as if she was sinking under her apprehensions;
and she besides feared, that were she absent,
the zeal of Lady Horatia would induce her
to explain to Captain Thorold more of her
wishes and projects in regard to her and his
brother than, feeling as she did the impossibi∣lity
of their ever taking place, ought in dis∣cretion
or in justice to be talked of.</P>
<P>For these reasons, wretched and distressed
as she was, she had yet resolution enough to
remain in her place; till at length Captain
Thorold, having paraded about himself for
near half an hour, withdrew.</P>
<P>Then it was, that, from the conversation
of her friend, Celestina understood how much
such an event would be expected to affect her
sentiments in favour of Montague Thorold;
and how impossible Lady Horatia considered it
for her, after all the sufferings he must sustain
on her account, to delay rewarding those suf∣ferings
and his long and ardent attachment to
her longer than till his recovery: of which,
notwithstanding what Captain Thorold had
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
said of the possibility of danger, she seemed
not to doubt; though she expressed great
concern for the pain he must endure, and
great anxiety to be informed of his actual si∣tuation.
To all that she said, Celestina hard∣ly
answered a word—her heart was too much
oppressed; and she could say nothing that
would not appear either like insensibility, in∣gratitude,
or like the anxious solicitude of
love. She wished to avoid either: she wished
to be alone; and though the determination
Lady Horatia almost immediately formed to
visit Montague Thorold herself, was a mea∣sure
which must strongly confirm all the re∣ports
that she wished to discourage, yet it
released her to her own reflections, and she
was glad at that moment to see her friend
depart.</P>
<P>Her own reflections, to which she was now
left, were most uneasy—She knew that such
an affair must unavoidably be much and im∣mediately
talked of: she knew how much it
would be misrepresented, and what conclu∣sions
would be made upon it. The expression
used by Willoughby the evening before still
vibrated in her ears: "What! and is all this
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
terror, all this apprehension, for Montague
Thorold." It was displeasing then to him
that she should feel an interest for Montague
Thorold—and the little tenderness he had ap∣peared
to shew her, was repressed the moment
he understood who was the subject of her
alarm—conscious that hopeless as she had long
been of his affection, and submitting to the
necessity of their separation, she had yet never
bestowed on another the heart he had resigned,
she could not bear to think how much every
circumstance had contributed to make him
think, that she had lightly given it to the
first candidate; nor could her mind dwell
without extreme concern, on the pain this
affair would give the elder Mr. Thorold,
whose hopes were, she well knew, centered in
his youngest son, and who would not only
be distressed by the sickness and danger to
which he had thus exposed himself, but he hurt
at his having acted so contrary to those prin∣ciples
he had always endeavoured to incul∣cate,
as to giving or receiving a challenge.—Nor
were the sufferings of Montague Thorold
himself the least part of her concern: she
apprehended he might be long confined in
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
great pain; he might perhaps lose his arm,
or even his life: and while she regretted the
rashness which had been the occasion of this
hazard, she could not but acknowledge, that
it was impossible a young man of spirit could
otherwise have answered the unprovoked fe∣rocity
of Vavasour.</P>
<P>Of him she thought with terror; and
knowing that he was capable of any impro∣priety
in the humour he was now in, she gave
immediate orders, that if he came she should
be denied.</P>
<P>All the circumstances of the preceding
evening, which the fear that had beset her
during the latter part of it had for a while
driven from her recollection, now returned to
it; and the repeated intelligence she had re∣ceived
throughout the day of Willoughby's
marriage, all the particulars with which it had
been related, the happy looks of Miss Fitz-Hayman,
the proud triumph that sat on the
features of her mother, and the forced friend∣ship
with which Lady Molyneux seemed to
have connected herself with persons who were
so lately the objects of her aversion, all con∣firmed
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
the reports that were in circulation, so
as to put their truth beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>In a few days she was to hear of their actually
being married: to listen again to the detail of
their nuptial splendor, perhaps to witness them:
she was to be surrounded by a thousand im∣pertinent
people who would enquire and talk to
her about the duel; and, with an heart so op∣pressed,
must attend to them with patience,
and answer them with civility. The whole
prospect before her was too unpleasant; she
fancied it impossible to be endured; and re∣solved
to attempt, though at the hazard of
appearing ungrateful, perhaps of disobliging
her best and almost her only friend, to so∣licit
leave to go down to Jessy, at least till the
public conversation should have been turned
to some other topic, and the public curiosity
no longer excited by the marriage of Miss
Fitz-Hayman, or the rencontre of Vavasour
and Thorold.</P>
<P>The natural softness of her heart made her,
among all these sources of peculiar uneasiness,
really and tenderly interested for Montague
Thorold: and she awaited the return of Lady
Horatia with as much solicitude as she could
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
have felt if a beloved brother had been in
such a situation: perhaps she would have felt
more for nobody but Willoughby himself.
It was, therefore, a great relief to her harassed
spirits, when she heard, that while Captain
Thorold had been in Park-street, the bullet
had been extracted; that no bone had been
injured by it, and that he was in as good a
way as could be expected; his surgeon de∣claring,
that from the nature of the wound,
and the good constitution of his patient, he.
thought him in no danger, and should pro∣bably,
at the end of a fortnight, dismiss him
with his arm in a sling.</P>
<P>The satisfaction Celestina expressed on this
account, was not however increased, when
Lady Horatia added, that far from complain∣ing
of his sufferings, he exulted and rejoiced
in them; flattering himself that she for whom
he could willingly have risked an hundred
lives if he had possessed them, would feel
some pity for him; and knowing how much
power, in such a heart as hers, that senti∣ment
had to produce others still more fa∣vourable.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110"/>
Lady Horatia then went on to say very
seriously to Celestina, that she ought no longer
to trifle with such a man, but resolve imme∣diately
to give him her hand: not only as the
reward of his merit, but to preclude the dan∣gerous
pretensions of Vavasour: "to whose
perseverance," said she, "no refusal, no re∣pulse
seems to put an end."</P>
<P>"Dearest Madam," said Celestina, <HI>did</HI> I
ever trifle with Mr. Thorold—surely I never
meant it—so far from it, I have an hundred
times regretted that your Ladyship's partia∣lity
towards him, and the influence you have
and ought to have over me, have combined
to keep him in an error, which all my candid
dealing with him has not had the power to
refute. I have told him, whenever he has
urged the subject, that he is in possession of
my esteem and of my friendship, but that
for my love I have it not to bestow."</P>
<P>"But he is content, my dear, with your
esteem, with your friendship; and knows
that, in such a heart as yours, love will follow
his attachment to you; especially as you <HI>now</HI>
surely cannot alledge that any other person
possesses it."</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111"/>
Celestina, too conscious of all these circum∣stances
that ought long since to have induced
her to withdraw it from Willoughby, yet
equally conscious that she could never feel for
another that degree of affection of which
she had been sensible for him, was silent a
moment or two, and then said, "Dear Lady
Horatia, why must I marry at all? while
you afford me your protection can I be
happier; and should I be unhappy enough
to lose it, should I not be more likely to meet
content even with my small and humble for∣tune,
if I remained single, than if I gave my
hand where I have no power to bestow my
heart."</P>
<P>"I am amazed," replied Lady Horatia,
"that with such very good sense as you pos∣sess,
you would accuston yourself to cherish
these childish and girlish notions: what is this
love, without feeling all the violence of which,
you suppose it impossible to be happy?"</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," cried Celestina, inter∣rupting
her, "have I not heard you say, that
you once was sensible of it yourself; and that
having been compelled to quit the man of
your choice, you considered such a necessity
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
as a heavy affliction, and that it rendered most
of the occurrences of your subsequent life
indifferent to you?"</P>
<P>Yes, you have heard me say so—I merely
acknowledged a folly, a weakness, which I
pretended not to defend in myself, and cer∣tainly
not to encourage in you.—What has
been the life of this man, whom I called, in
the romantic simplicity of sixteen, my first
love? When my father parted us, and I was
compelled by his authority to give my hand
to General Howard, he was a younger bro∣ther,
with very little fortune. In a twelve-month
afterwards, the death of his elder bro∣ther
and an uncle gave him a very large for∣tune;
and he quitted the navy, where he had,
for so young a man, highly distinguished
himself, and with his profession he seemed to
resign his virtues. He married a woman to∣wards
whom he professed himself indifferent;
and whose only recommendation was a for∣tune
nearly as large as his own. To her he
behaved with neglect, which she repaid with
scorn and infidelity. They seemed to agree
in nothing but mutual extravagance; till at
length they parted, and he now lives in
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
France the greatest part of the year; at other
times wanders about the world, to gratify his
taste for variety, and fly from those corrosive
reflections which must pursue him who has
ruined his health and his fortune by de∣bauchery.
Can I, when I consider all this, help
despising myself for the pain I felt at being
separated from such a man; and ought I not
rather to rejoice at what once appeared an
insupportable misfortune?</P>
<P>"Ah, Madam," said Celestina, "it is well
if by these reflections you have been enabled
to conquer those remains of useless regret
which might otherwise have embittered your
life: but give me leave to ask, since there is
now no danger of renewing them, give me
leave to ask, whether you sincerely believe
that this gentleman, had he married you,
would have passed a life as blameable? You
have told me that he was passionately
attached to you: you now say, that to the
lady he married he was indifferent: surely to
that may be imputed all his errors.—His
mind became unhinged when he lost her to
whom it was devoted, and he aggravated
himself the cruelty of his destiny. To you
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
he might have been an excellent husband,
because he loved you; but losing the poss∣ibility
of being happy, he lost the wish to be
respectable; and since he could not live with
you, cared not with whom or how he
lived."</P>
<P>"There may be some truth," said Lady
Horatia, "in your remarks; but to be tole∣rably
easy, Celestina, in this world, you
must learn to be more of an Optimist; and to
believe, that whatever happens, could not, nor
ought not to have been otherwise. Thus the
interference of Lady Castlenorth, whatever
might have been her motives, has saved you
from a marriage that might have been a hide∣ous
crime; thus, not to enumerate other in∣stances
that must occur to your recollection;
thus, the wild brutality of Vavasour, and
even the wound of Montague, will all contri∣bute
finally to good, and produce that hap∣piness
for you with him, which I do not be∣lieve
you would have found with any other
person."</P>
<P>To this doctrine Celestina could not agree.
But the fear and fatigue she had within the last
twenty-four hours undergone, disqualified her
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
for any farther discussion of the subject at pre∣sent,
or for the attempt she meant to make to
prevail on Lady Horatia to allow her to go
down to Jessy for a few weeks; her eyes were
indeed so heavy, her complexion so pale in
consequence of her long agitation, that now
the immediate fears for Montague Thorold's
life were over, Lady Horatia advised her to
take some repose; a proposal which she glad∣ly
accepted; and in despite of the variety of
uneasiness she still laboured under, exhausted
nature obtained for her a few hours respite in
sleep: though she was, in her previous con∣templations,
so far from assenting heartily to
the resigned philosophy of Lady Horatia,
that she thought with anguish of the fate of
Willoughby, who might, she feared, by the
same disappointments in the early part of his
life, become quite unlike what he once was;
and from his cruel neglect of her since he
had been in London, she already fancied she
saw that this change had begun.</P>
<P>But could she for one moment have seen
the real state of that mind whose virtues she
believed to be tarnished, she would have found
it as worthy as ever of her tenderness, and
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
entitled to all her pity. Tormented by an
affection which he could not indulge for one
woman, and entangled by a series of perverse
events in an engagement with another; em∣barrassed
in his circumstances, and discontent∣ed
with himself; his whole life passed in a
continual tumult of contending passions; and
whatever means he took to calm and mitigate
them seemed only to irritate his sufferings.—Thus,
when he left his own lodgings on the
day of his interview with Miss Fitz-Hayman
and his meeting Celestina, he went to the
hotel where Vavasour usually lived when he
was in town; and where it happened that a
party of their mutual acquaintance that day
dined: this prevented his having any con∣versation
with Vavasour, which, though it
might have contributed but little to relieve
his vexation as to Montague Thorold, would
have eased his heart by unburthening it to
his friend; and Vavasour drank so much, that
there was afterwards no hopes of his hearing
him rationally. With him he was prevailed
upon, at a late hour, to go to Ranelagh;—where
he saw Celestina again with the very
man to whom he had been so repeatedly told
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
she had engaged herself; and there, though
Celestina happened not to see them together,
he was compelled to take several turns with
Lady Castlenorth, her daughter, and his
sister; thus confirming, by his appearance in
public with the two former, what it was in∣deed
too late to retract, though he had already
most bitterly repented it.</P>
<P>The quarrel between Vavasour and Mon∣tague
Thorold, of which his suddenly quitting
the place where he met Celestina was partly
the occasion (for had he staid he might have
prevented it), added to the conviction he
now had that Thorold was very soon to be her
husband; and increased his vexation, in de∣spite
of all that reason could say to counteract
the effect of it. That reason repeatedly asked
him—if Celestina had really been brought
up and acknowledged as his sister, and had
with so small a fortune been addressed by Tho∣rold,
and herself approved him, whether he
could in such a case have made any reasonable
objection? He was compelled to answer no!
yet his heart revolted against the assent which
common sense urged him to give to a mar∣riage
which differed in nothing from what
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
would then have been the case, but in early
prejudice. He never could learn to consider
Celestina as related to him by blood; nor did
all the pains he had taken to learn the truth
convince him of it; though he dared not act
as if he wholly disbelieved it. Yet so per∣verse
is an heart under the influence of such
passion as he felt, that while he had relin∣quished
her, and agreed to marry another, left
that relationship should really exist, he detest∣ed
Thorold for having, as he believed, pos∣sessed
himself of those affections, which, other∣wise
than as her brother, he had owned he
dared not claim.</P>
<P>When he left Celestina under the care of
Mr. Howard at Ranelagh the preceding even∣ing,
he had gone, as he promised, in search
of Vavasour; but not finding him any where
about the room, or in the avenues to the Ro∣tunda,
he had gone to his lodgings, and
waited there till near four in the morning.—He
then left orders with his servant to send
for him the moment his master came; but
Vavasour, instead of returning to his lodg∣ings
at all that evening, slept somewhere else;
and only called there in a hackney-coach at
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
half past five o'clock to take his pistols; and
his servant being ordered to attend him,
with the surgeon, there was no possibility of
his man giving Willoughby notice; and of
course he could do nothing to stop a ren∣contre
of which he did not hear till after it
was over.</P>
<P>Vavasour, who then came to him, was not
sober: and Willoughby saw, with more con∣cern
than surprise, that the habits his friend
had acquired since his last absence were be∣coming
inveterate, and were ruining alike his
constitution, his fortune, and his understand∣ing.
Though he himself detested Montague
Thorold, and cursed the hour when he had
put Celestina under the protection of his fa∣ther,
and by that means thrown him in her
way; he was; too generous, even to an enemy,
not to feel that Vavasour had behaved
with unwarrantable brutality; and notwith∣standing
his long friendship for him, he felt
too, that had he been as successful as he be∣lieved.
Thorold to be, all that friendship
would have been cancelled.</P>
<P>He was vexed, however, at the conversa∣tion
which this foolish business must occasion;
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
and in which he knew the name of Celestina
must be joined with that of Montague Tho∣rold:
and when Vavasour spoke with some
triumph of his having chastised the young
pedant, Willoughby, with a peevishness very
unusual with him, said, he heartily wished he
had let it alone.</P>
<P>From the little conversation he had with
Lady Castlenorth the evening before, he
found she expected him to wait on them the
next day. Reluctantly, and with an aching
heart, he had then given a sort of promise, and
with still more regret he recollected it. The
sun now never rose for him but to bring him
a renewal of misery; and his dejection never
left him, but to give place to paroxysms of
passion and fits of fruitless despair.</P>
<P>As the hour approached when he knew
he was expected at the house of his uncle,
his unwillingness to go increased. Farn∣ham,
who now anxiously watched all his
looks, saw a deeper gloom come upon him:
he saw him take out several letters, read them,
replace them, then snatch up a pen, write a
few lines, and hurry a-cross the room as if
undecided what to do. At length he wrote
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
a few lines, sealed the note, and put it in his
pocket. Farnham had heard a great deal of
the duel that had happened the evening be∣fore,
and knew it was about Miss de Mornay,
and that a gentleman had been wounded dan∣gerously.
He had heard conversation be∣tween
his master and Vavasour, and supposed,
from their manner, that they parted in anger.
This circumstance put it in his head, which
was rather an honest than a clear one, that
some other affair of honour, in which his
master was concerned, was still in agitation;
and he so thoroughly persuaded himself of
this, that he determined to observe narrowly
every thing that happened, and to take all
possible precautions against his master's hav∣ing
such an accident besal him as had hap∣pened
to Mr. Montague Thorold,</P>
<P>For this purpose he attached himself very
closely to the hole in the door between the
dining-room and the bed-chamber; and when
he was summoned, by a furious ring, to at∣tend
him, he was under the necessity of first
slipping softly down stairs, and then running
up to ask his commands.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122"/>
Willoughby gave him two notes, and ask∣ed
if the groom was within. On hearing he
he was not: "Then go yourself," said he,
"with these two notes: no answer is required
to either: return as soon as you can."—Farnham
promising to be expeditious, left
him; and reading the directions, found one to
be, to Miss de Mornay, the other to Mr.
Vavasour. This, with all he knew of his
master's former attachment and embarrassing
doubts about Celestina, and all that had hap∣pened
that evening before, and that morn∣ing,
convinced him beyond a doubt, that
another duel would happen, which he ima∣gined
it to be his peculiar duty to prevent.—He
was not very fertile in expedients: but it
occurred to him that the best way would be
to carry both these letters, and at the same
time communicate his fears, to Sir Philip and
Lady Molyneux.</P>
<P>Sir Philip was not at home; but Lady
Molyneux, on hearing he wanted to speak to
her; ordered him up.</P>
<P>He opened his business with great gravity;
detailed all the cause he had for apprehension
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
from his master's behaviour, and produced
the two notes.</P>
<P>Lady Molyneux affected to agree with him
as to the justice of his fears, and to com∣mend
his prudence and fidelity; she then told
him she thought it would be the best way to
open the letters, which, as she happened to
have a seal with the Willoughby arms, the
same as her brother's, she could easily re∣seal;
and send, if they contained nothing of
what they suspected; and if they did, that it
would be proper to destroy them.</P>
<P>Poor Farnham, trembling as he spoke, as∣sented
to all this, only entreating her to take
care that his master might never know it. This
she readily promised; and, taking all the
blame upon herself, bade him retire while
she opened the letters, and come up again
when she rang.</P>
<P>She then read them.—That to Vavasour
was merely to put off an appointment for the
evening, which Willoughby found himself
unable to attend.—That to Celestina ran thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I should have sent to you, Madam, im∣mediately,
on my arrival in London: but ill∣ness
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
for some days prevented my being able
even to write, and in that interval I heard
that you were on the point of putting your∣self
into the protection of one who might
deem such an address improper, and render
it needless.</P>
<P>That you have come to this resolution
without consulting any of those who were once
honoured with your friendship, I can now no
longer doubt. I, however, feel it in some
measure incumbent upon me to offer you
every service in my power; to say, that as
soon as my own affairs are settled, I shall
have the honour of troubling you on pecu∣niary
matters; and if, in the mean time, you
have any wish to see me as your friend, I will
obey your summons: but leave it wholly to
yourself.—I shall consider your silence as an
acknowledgment that such an interview will
be painful to you; and submit to offer, at
a distance, those sincere wishes for your
happiness, which must ever be felt by,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125"/>
This letter, cold and unlike his former
style to Celestina as it was, his sister imme∣diately
resolved to suppress. Her hatred to
Celestina was increased to a degree of inve∣terate
malignity of which it was difficult to
conceive her haughty <HI>indolence</HI> was capable;
and this arose chiesly from the admiration she
every where saw her beauty excited, which
was a point in which she could not bear to be
excelled. Convinced as she internally was,
that Celestina was an orphan stranger, brought
up on her mother's charity, she chose rather to
leave the report of their relationship uncontra∣dicted,
than to see her united to her brother,
and put on a footing with herself, to which
that equivocal relationship could give her no
claim: and since the suppression of her letter to
Willoughby, which an interview now would
explain, she was doubly solicitous to prevent
it—Her pride could not bear that her brother
should become the humble and reduced coun∣try
gentleman that he must submit to be if he
married a woman without fortune; and her
avarice represented the possibility of his being,
in such a case, a burthen on his affluent rela∣tions.
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
All these considerations determined
her to stifle it, and the sentence with which
the letter concluded, assured her she might do
it with impunity. She therefore called up
Farnham, on whose simplicity it was very easy
to impose, and told him that the letter to
Mr. Vavasour was very immaterial, and that
he might carry that; but that the other to
Miss de Mornay, was of a nature to involve
his master in great difficulties, and that there∣fore
she would destroy it. She then put it
in the fire; and bide him carry the other,
which she had carefully re-sealed. This
Farnham immediately did; but being un∣willing
to be guilty of a greater falsehood
than there seemed to be occasion for, he ac∣tually
went to Park-street that he might tell
his master he had been there.</P>
<P>On his return, Willoughby questioned him
who he saw at Lady Horatia's.—For this
question the poor fellow was not prepared.—However
he answered—"I saw John, Sir,
my Lady's own footman."</P>
<P>"Well—and was Miss de Mornay at
home?"</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127"/>
"No, Sir," replied Farnham, who had
now acquired courage; "but you know you
bade me not wait for an answer."</P>
<P>"Well, but had you not the sense to ask
where she was?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir; to be sure I did not think of
that: but, however, I fancy she was visiting,
Sir, the wounded gentleman in Oxford-street."</P>
<P>Willoughby knew that Montague Thorold
lodged there, and that it must be him alone
who was described as the wounded gentleman.</P>
<P>"And why do you think so, Sir," said he,
fiercely, as if poor Farnham had been acces∣sary
to it—"and what the devil have you
to do to think about it?"</P>
<P>"Lord, Sir," cried Farnham, "only be∣cause
as I came along I saw my lady's coach
at the door where I knew young Mr. Thorold
lodges, and just nodded to Sam, who was
upon the box."</P>
<P>"Cursed fool!" exclaimed Willoughby—"could
you not have asked whether she was
there or no: yet why should I desire to know;"
added he, rising and walking about with his
hands clenched together—"what is it to me?
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
and why do I torment myself?—Go, Sir, and
fetch my powdering gown and my things to
dress." Poor Farnham, convinced that Lady
Molyneux was right in what she had done, yet
rendered doubly timid by the consciousness
of having committed a sort of fraud on his
master, hastily obeyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE situation of Celestina was rendered
infinitely more uneasy to her by the transac∣tions
of the last two or three days; and her
spirits could no longer support her—The cer∣tainty
of meeting Willoughby wherever she
went, and of meeting him only to be more
and more convinced that he had ceased to
feel any degree of affection for her, made the
thoughts of continuing her present mode of
life, which had any charms in her opinion,
quite insupportable to her. The conversa∣tion
about the duel—the questions she should
be asked, and the impertinence she must at∣tend
to, encreased the aversion with which she
thought of appearing again in public; and
she determined, at any hazard, to propose to
Lady Horatia, that she might go into the
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
country, and there wait, wherever she pleased,
till she should herself quit London.</P>
<P>She took, therefore, the first moment they
were alone together, to prefer and urge this
request: and after making some objections,
which, however, the altered looks and de∣pressed
spirits of Celestina very forcibly com∣bated,
Lady Horatia consented to her going;
but as the house of Jessy was too near Al∣vestone,
where it was supposed Willoughby and
his bride were immediately to go after their
marriage—it was settled that she should, with a
maid to attend her, go to Cheltenham, and wait
there till Lady Horatia could leave London,
which she proposed doing in a fortnight or
three weeks at farthest. This plan being
once arranged, Celestina was impatient till it
was executed; and so effectually set about the
little preparations she had to make, that the
next day she left London—and for the first
time since her quitting the Hebrides, enjoyed
the calm solitude she loved.</P>
<P>Wretched in the mean time was the state of
Willoughby; he went to dine at Lord Castle∣norths,
as he had been obliged to promise—where
a large company were assembled, as if
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
to receive him, for the first time, as the heir
and acknowledged son-in-law of Lord Castle∣north.
He had, however, no power to con∣ceal,
under the common forms of life, the
misery of his internal. feelings; his counte∣nance
refused to wear the forced smile of
complaisance; his emotion when the duel was
talked of, and the name of Celestina was in∣troduced,
was evident enough to all but those
who did not chuse to see it.</P>
<P>Lord Castlenorth was, indeed, never very
much celebrated for discernment; but his
Lady, who highly piqued herself on her sa∣gacity—on
the facility with which she read
characters, and penetrated the views of those
with whom she conversed—her blindness there∣fore
was evidently wilful—and that of her
daughter, unless her love or her vanity inter∣cepted
her right, was equally strange—cer∣tain
it was, that they either could not, or
would not, attend to the reluctant melancholy
of Willoughby, under which he with difficulty
concealed the bitter agonies of despair; and
they appeared perfectly satisfied with him and
with themselves.</P>
<P>There was one face, however, in the circle
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
that, though it wore looks of festivity, yet was
now and then seen to survey Willoughby with
indignant scorn; and then, as if checked for
indulging it, to resume the smile of approba∣tion
and complacency. Captain Cavanaugh
indeed did not very frequently address himself
to him; but conversed chiefly with the
Ladies. But whenever he did speak to him,
Willoughby himself, who had till now very
little noticed him, could not help remarking
that there was something peculiar in his man∣ner.</P>
<P>When the Gentlemen were left together,
Lord Castlenorth, who could not drink, and
whose health obliged him to retire early,
called to his nephew, and bade him take his
place. This Willoughby, who had been all
day meditating how he might make an early
escape, was compelled to do, though he ob∣served,
"that as Captain Cavanaugh usually
took that seat when his Lordship retired, he
wished him then to assume it." Lord Castle∣north,
however, persisted; and Willoughby,
willing to get rid of an irksome task as soon
as possible, made the wine circulate so quick∣ly,
that, as he was never in habits of drinking,
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
he soon began to find himself loosing his de∣jection
in a kind of bewildering stupor: any
thing seemed better to him than the task of
entertaining Miss Fitz-Hayman for the rest of
the evening; and as he felt he by degrees
ceased to think of her, he found some satisfac∣tion
in drinking, and was very soon complete∣ly
intoxicated.</P>
<P>He was no longer capable of judging for
himself, or he would not have gone up stairs
in such a situation—he had just recollection
enough left to stay, without committing any
great extravagance, while tea was served; and
then gladly followed a servant who whispered
to him that Lord Castlenorth desired the fa∣vour
of seeing him in his own apartment.</P>
<P>Thither he staggered with very little con∣sciousness;
and being seated where his uncle
sat opposite to him, in a great chair, while
several parchments lay open on a table, he
heard, but without the least comprehension of
what was said, a long harangue—on for∣tune
and family, heraldry and genealogy,
titles and successions;—the whole of which con∣cluded,
by his informing him that the money
was ready to pay off all the incumbrances on
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
his estate, which was to be immediately done;
that the settlements were in hand, and to be
finished in a week; and that, that day fort∣night
was fixed for the marriage. Willoughby,
between the verbose confusion of his uncle's
mode of delivery and his own incapacity of at∣tention,
heard it all, but understood nothing;
he was not, however, so unconscious of pain
and sickness. Mrs. Calder, who for the
greater part of this conversation had sat read∣ing
a treatise on bilious concretions, on the
opposite side of the room, with her spectacles
on, now finding Lord Castlenorth had done,
and that Willoughby looked very likely to
sink out of his chair, very wisely ended this
conversation, by sending up Farnham to his
master, who had him conveyed home in a
chair.</P>
<P>The next morning he was awakened to a
perfect recollection of all that had passed the
evening before; and became too certain, that
the means he had taken to obtain a temporary
release from his fetters, had served only to
rivet them more closely. Alas! he remem∣bered
too—with poignant anguish remem∣bered,
that so many hours had elapsed since he
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
had written to Celestina; and that it was now
too certain she would not answer his letter,
and wholly declined seeing him.</P>
<P>Though he had so often determined never
to meet her again; so often persuaded himself
not wish it; this cruel conviction of her total
estrangement from him, seemed to fall as
heavily as if he had never dreamed of their
separation—she might, however, be out of
town; she might be engaged; something
might have prevented her writing. To this
slender hope he clung for some hours of the
morning; but it insensibly became fainter as
his impatience encreased, and at length he
ordered Farnham to find the coachman of
Lady Horatia, with whom he was acquainted,
and try to discover any particulars he could.</P>
<P>Farnham, dreading lest his master should
discover the imposition he had ventured to
practice, dared not disobey him—he sat out
therefore for the stables, where, at that time
in the morning, he was sure of finding his ac∣quaintance;
he found him indeed very busy
in cleaning, with the aid of a postillion and a
helper, two of his horses, which had been,
"poor things!" he said, "the first stage to Chel∣tenham
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
ham, with Miss de Mornay and Rebecca the
maid, that my Lady sent with her."—Farn∣ham
made him repeat this intelligence; to
which he added, "Why, my Lady and all of
us be going down to Gloucestershire, in about
a fortnight; that is, as soon as young Mr.
Thorold is well enough to be moved, which,
the Doctor as tends him says, will be in that
time or less. My Lady takes his illness sadly to
heart, and so does Miss—and went out of
town sadly down in the mouth; but, howso∣ever,
'tis well 'twas no worse, you know;
and as he is like to do well—why there's no
great harm—and Miss will be married all
one."</P>
<P>The minutest article, of this account was
remembered by Farnham, and punctually re∣lated
by him to his master—who now tho∣roughly
convinced that all hope was at an end
of Celestina's retaining for him any affection;
and a certainty so dreadful; the assurance of
his being irrevocably engaged, and having
gone into Gloucestershire, there to wait the
recovery of Montague Thorold; the assur∣ance
that he should never see her more—all
contributed, with his excess of the evening be∣fore,
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
to inflame his blood—and by four o'clock
he was in an high fever.</P>
<P>His indisposition was encreased by a visit
from Vavasour, who laughed at the vexation
and disgust he expressed at what had hap∣pened
in regard to Montague Thorold; but
grew graver when he heard that, far from its
having put an end to his pretensions to Celes∣tina,
it had served only to hasten their mar∣riage.—The
wild and ill founded projects of
Vavasour to prevent this, and to succeed him∣self,
which to Willoughby would have been
equally hateful, were but little calculated to
appease his agitation, and quiet his boiling
blood; before Vavasour went away, he be∣came
delirious—and Farnham, in a terrible
fright, went for Lady Molyneux and a phy∣sician—Lady
Molyneux was just stepping in∣to
her coach, when the affrighted face of Farn∣ham
appeared before her—she chid him for
the needless alarm he had given her; and said,
that she supposed it was nothing but a little
return of the fever her brother was subject
to—"I cannot," said she, "call now; but as
I come home this evening, I will see him."—The
physician, for whom Farnham then went,
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
directly attended; and found his patient,
though not in so high a fever as he had seen
him before, ill enough to require his immedi∣ate
assistance—which he ordered with so happy
an effect, that in a few hours the delirium en∣tirely
subsided, and Willoughby, though ex∣tremely
languid, was at night almost free
from his fever.—Lady Molyneux who called
on him, soon after midnight, for a few mo∣ments,
again blamed Farnham for his offici∣ous
apprehensions; and being well convinced
that Willoughby would be glad of any excuse
to keep back the preparations which were now
going on, she endeavoured to persuade him
that his illness was very trisling; and taking
occasion to talk over what happened at Rane∣lagh,
told her brother, laughingly,—that she
hoped he was now convinced of the attach∣ment
between young Thorold and Miss de
Mornay—adding, "his brother, Captain Tho∣rold,
who is really an elegant and fashionable
man, tells me they are to be married the mo∣ment
Montague is able to leave London."</P>
<P>"Well, well," cried Willoughby, peevish∣ly—"I
know it; and I do not desire to hear
any more about it.—I thank you for calling
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
on me; but it is very late, and my physician
desires I will keep myself quiet."</P>
<P>Lady Molyneux then withdrew, and poor
Willoughby, to whom she had administered a
poison instead of a cordial, tried to find that
repose which he so greatly wanted: but to
him his estranged, his lost Celestina, on one
hand, and on the other his intended bride,
seemed to cry—"sleep no more."</P>
<P>Farnham, who sat up by him to administer
the medicines he was to take, heard him sigh
the greatest part of the night without ceasing;
and whenever he thought he might venture,
asked him how he did.—"Pr'ythee, Farnham,"
said he, after two or three of these questions,
"do not ask me how I do—how should a man
do, who is in a situation to envy every body
but the fellow just going to be hanged—you
know, that I am at this moment the most
miserable fellow upon earth."</P>
<P>"I am sure I am very sorry to hear it
answered his servant: but if I might be so
bold as to speak, I should say that I cannot
think what cause you can have to be miser∣able—nor....."</P>
<P>He was going on, when Willoughby, eager∣ly
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
catching aside the curtain, said, "What cause!—Have
I not lost an angel—and am I not, have
I not condemned myself to marry—a woman
I cannot love—no, never; never, by Heaven."</P>
<P>"To be sure, Sir," said Farnham, "to be
crossed in love, as I may say, is very bad—as
I have heard tell—but in this here matter—all
things considered, I hope your honour's
mind will be settled about it; and as for the
two ladies, to be sure beauty is all fancy—Miss
Celestina, for certain, is a fine young
lady, and so good and gentle to servants,
that it was always a pleasure to me to hear her
speak to me, and to wait upon her; but then,
for certain, Miss Fitz-Hayman, though she is
higher and more stately, as she ought to be,
being as she is a lady of title and quality—is
a fine young lady too, and a very majestic
grand person—and then her great riches—"Curse
on her riches," exclaimed Willoughby.
 "Aye, Sir;" said Farnham, who was not a
little slattered by his confidence, and was now
got into one of his prosing humours—"Aye
Sir, it is very well for young, gentlemen to
cry curse on this, and that, and t'other—but
as for riches—what can they do without them?
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
Nobody is not respected the least in the world,
if they don't make a shew, and a figure, and
the like of that—and can it be done without
money?—No—nor not without a pretty deal
on't—and, for my part, I own—I don't love
to see <HI>my</HI> master not able to vie with the best
lord of the land—as to be sure he ought."</P>
<P>"Thou art a fool, Farnham," cried Wil∣loughby—"Do
have done with thy Lords of
the land, and give me twenty drops more of
the opiate"—"Yes, Sir," said Farnham; and
prepared to obey him—but while he was
counting out the drops, he could not forbear
going on—"One, two—there are other peo∣ple,
Sir,—three, four—about my Lord's
house, who, it's my notion—five, six, seven—are
not so apt to cry, curse money—eight,
nine, ten—there is Captain Cavanaugh—eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen"—"Cap∣tain
Cavanaugh," interrupts Willoughby—"What
of Captain Cavanaugh?" "Nay, Sir,—only
the Captain—as far as I can find—do'nt
hate money, nor cry, curse it and damn
it—he has been long enough living about the
world, to know that nothing can be had with∣out
it, and—that is all, Sir."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="142"/>
"But that seems to me not to be all, Sir—pray,
tell me what Captain Cavanaugh has to
do with what we were talking of—with Miss
Fitz-Hayman?"</P>
<P>"Lord, nothing, Sir, I am sure, that I know
of—only, if the young Lady was not engaged,
and in love with you, perhaps—the Cap∣tain,
Sir, is reckoned, by the women, a very
handsome man, Sir—and Miss Fitz-Hayman
may think so, as well as another." "Why
he is married—you booby—what stuff have
you got into your head; and who has been
talking to you of him and Miss Fitz-Hayman;
let him be reckoned as handsome as he will
by the women—he can be nothing to Miss
Fitz-Hayman—for I know he has been mar∣ried
some years."</P>
<P>"Aye, Sir, I dare say that may be—but
there is such a thing as being un-married
again;—not that I ever heard, I am sure, much
about the Captain; only Justina was laughing
one day, and laying, in her broken English—so
that I can't say I quite right understand
her—that if my Lord should die, and the Cap∣tain
should ever be able to get rid of his wife—she
should not be much surprised if he and
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
my Lady was to make a match of it; for that
never was such a favourite as the Captain."</P>
<P>"I should not be much surprised at that
myself," answered Willoughby, "for I believe
the Captain <HI>has</HI> a good deal of interest there—so,
then, he has been trying to get rid of his
wife?"</P>
<P>"Justina told me, Sir, one day, as a great
secret, that my Lord had helped him to money,
to try at it.—But, Sir, if Justina should know
I ever mentioned it, I should never be able to
get a word out of her again." "I promise
thee, she never shall—so tell me, Farnham, all
thou hast heard from her about Lady Castle∣north
and the Captain."</P>
<P>"Why, Sir, it was not much—but only
Justina was laughing t'other day about my
Lady's having such a great friendship for him,
and there's no stopping her tongue when she
begins—so she told me—Lord, Sir! a great
many things that were odd enough to be sure—but
only Ladies of quality, I reckon, don't
much care what people says of them.—She
said, that my Lady knew well enough, that
my Lord could not hold it long—and that
she was providing herself with a handsome
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
young husband, and making sure of him, as
she thought, before the old one hobbled off—but
let her take care, said Justina, that she
marries her daughter first, or I know what
will happen.—The Captain knows well
enough, that a young woman is better than
an old one; and besides, that such a great for∣tune
as my young lady will have, is better,
twenty to one, than her mother's jointure."</P>
<P>This speech at once opened Willoughby's
eyes, as to Lady Castlenorth's motives for the
extreme haste and earnestness she had shewn
to conclude her daughter's marriage; feeling
as he did, in regard to Miss Hayman, he was
sensible neither of jealousy or mortification,
at the idea of any preference she might enter∣tain
for Cavanaugh; but a hope, that, from this
circumstance, something might happen to
break off the connection for ever between him
and his cousin involuntarily arose in his mind.—In
any event, it ought to be attended to; he
bade Farnham therefore go the next day,
and see if he could set Justina gossipping
again—"I have a notion, Farnham," said he
"that you are very much in the good graces
of the little Neapolitan."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145"/>
"Oh, no, Sir; finer fellows than I am have
all the chance there—and for my part, Sir, I
don't much fancy her, though she is lively
and smart, and when I get her by herself will
tell the secrets of all the family."</P>
<P>"Which thou lovest to hear; therefore get
her by herself as soon as thou canst, and make
her tell thee all she knows."</P>
<P>Willoughby then again tried to compose
himself—and by the help of the medicines he
had taken, obtained four or five hours sleep.—He
was a great deal better in the morning;
as he breakfasted, a note was brought him
from Lady Castlenorth, informing him that
his uncle had been seized in the night with a
violent return of that asthmatic complaint
which so frequently had rendered his stay in
England impossible: that the spring, though
far advanced, was so cold and wet, that there
was no chance of his being better while he
remained there now; and that therefore he had,
by the advice of his physicians, and by his own
inclination, determined to set out that very
day for the continent. She added, "You
will come to us, of course, instantly, and if you
cannot go with us, settle when you will follow
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
us; but your uncle wishes you to accom∣pany
us."</P>
<P>This intelligence was to Willoughby like
a reprieve from what to him was worse than
death; since the longer he considered of his
marriage, the more dishonourable now, and
the more certainly miserable hereafter, it ap∣peared
to him. He wrote an hasty note,
saying how ill he had been the whole night,
and how impossible he feared it would be for
him to see his uncle that day; but that, if his
physician, whom he every moment expected,
gave him leave to go out, he would certainly
wait upon him.</P>
<P>This answer had not been dispatched above
an hour, and his medical friend had just left
him, with a strict injunction not to stir out
that day, when Lady Castlenorth and Mrs.
Calder entered his room.</P>
<P>"So, my dear Sir," cried the former—"what
is to be done! Lord Castlenorth will
be wretched to leave you behind—and my
poor girl too!—What is this sudden fever—you
really look ill—I cannot imagine what is
to be done—For my Lord to stay, he thinks
it death."</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/>
Willoughby muttered something which he
meant should express concern at his uncle's
illness: but Mrs. Calder fortunately precluded
the necessity of his being very distinct in his
hypocrisy, by stepping up to him, and taking
his hand, "Come, come," said she, "let me
feel your pulse." She then, gravely counting
its vibrations as she held her stop-watch, said,
"Why, really now, here is much less fever
than I expected from your appearance—let us
see your tongue.—Humph—'tis white to be
sure—Where are your medicines—I should
think, if you were well wrapped up and put
into a chair, you might go to your uncle with∣out
any danger—on such an emergency, you
know, a little may be hazarded."</P>
<P>"No," said Lady Castlenorth, "by no
means; nothing must be hazarded—And af∣ter
all, my Lord may make himself easy, as I
dare say you will be able to overtake us be∣fore
we get to Paris; where, if my Lord is
better, and finds that relief he generally does
from a change of air, we will stop till you
join us: I think you will be perfectly restored
in a week: but, however, I will go myself to
Dr. B—, and hear what he says."</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148"/>
"Oh, I can tell you," interrupted Mrs.
Calder, "that he'll be well, perfectly well, in
less than a week.—I have been tasting his
medicines, and understand clearly from them
what Dr. B—thinks of his fever—I was
a mere ephemeris—of that be assured.…"</P>
<P>"Well," said Lady Castlenorth, "my dear
Willoughby, what shall we say?"</P>
<P>Willoughby was ready to answer—"No∣thing
more, good Madam:" but sighing from
a sense of pain and restraint, he only replied,
"that he could only say that he was very
sorry for his uncle's illness—and—"</P>
<P>"That you will hasten after us?—that, I
think, I may venture to assure your uncle.—He
was settling this morning that you should
be married in the English ambassador's chapel
at Paris; and I really don't see myself that,
upon the whole, these unlucky illnesses of my
Lord's and of your's need impede the affair a
single hour; all the difference will be, that
you will be married at Paris, instead of at Lon∣don,
and we will pass the rest of the year in
Italy instead of Castlenorth."</P>
<P>"But the dear young Lady," cried Mrs.
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
Calder, "our sweet and lovely child, how
will she bear even this transient separation!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, I don't know," said Lady Castle∣north,
affecting to be quite sympathetic—"but
she shall come, and bring the letter
my Lord will have directed to be written with
his last directions about the deeds and car∣riages;
which our dear George must bring
with him: and" added she, smiling, "I fancy,
upon the footing they are now, there will be
no great indecorum in her coming to his
lodgings."</P>
<P>Willoughby found immediately his fever
returning, and that he should have a terrible
headach: he put up his hand to his temples—"I am obliged to your Ladyship," said he
in a languid voice; "and I wish this most
oppressive head-ach of mine would—"</P>
<P>"What it aches now, does it?" said Mrs.
Calder, "I wish Dr. B—was here, I am
sure I could give him a hint or two on this
case which might be of use to him."</P>
<P>"Let us go to him," interrupted Lady
Castlenorth, "and talk to him about this
ugly fever; and when we have found him, it
will be time to return to my Lord, and to send
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
my daughter hither; for we think to sleep at
Rochester to-night."</P>
<P>Willoughby now blessing her for her haste,
made his compliments in a low voice; and still
complaining of his head—the Ladies de∣parted.</P>
<P>They were no sooner gone, than he tried to
discover by what means he might best avoid
receiving the favour of the visit Lady Castle∣north
had promised him from her daughter.
He was ashamed of the part he was acting,
however ill and reluctantly he performed it.
For the first time in his life his conduct was
contrary to his sense of honour, and, he was
conscious, altogether unworthy of him; and
while he had thus betrayed himself, he was
become the dupe of Lady Castlenorth, and
perhaps was meant to be the dupe of Miss
Fitz-Hayman and their mutual favourite.—His
pride, as well as his rectitude, revolted
from the idea of carrying on this odious farce,
which he now wondered what demon had
tempted him, in the moment of passion and
despair, to begin—and which he, however
late, thought he should now act more ho∣nourably
in ending at once, than in suffering it
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
it to proceed another day—He was, however,
by no means able to determine, at once, how
he should do this; and what he had most im∣mediately
to consider was, how he should
escape the enquiry and adieu of the heiress,
which he might now every moment expect.</P>
<P>He at length determined to go to bed—and
sending again for his physician, who was
very much his friend, acknowledged the truth
to him, and got an absolute prohibition against
his seeing any body—He told Farnham,
therefore, that he again felt himself extreme∣ly
ill; and bade him immediately run for Dr.
B—. Fortunately he met him in the next
street; and in less than ten minutes he had
received Willoughby's confession, that all his
illness, both before and since his return from
abroad, had been owing to distress of mind,
which he could now no longer hope would
abate, by the necessity he had thought of
putting himself under to conceal it—In short,
he owned that his dislike to Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
as a wife, was unconquerable; and that
as he was determined at all events to break
the treaty off, however far it had gone, and
therefore entreated his friend to find some rea∣son
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
for his evading an interview so useless and
so irksome, when it was impossible for him to
continue acting a moment longer the part he
had so rashly undertaken; and yet did not
mean, and especially in the present condition
of his uncle's health, abruptly and rudely to
end it; but to soften, at least to him, a dis∣appointment
which he had thus rendered
doubly heavy.</P>
<P>Dr. B—entered at once into his meaning,—and,
smiling, said, "It is a little unusual,
my friend, for me to contrive an illness to
separate a lady from her lover, though I have
been often asked to make pretences for bring∣ing
them together.—However, the fact is,
that you really are unfit to entertain the lady,
for your fever is considerably increased since I
saw you in the morning; and we see very
plainly that any agitation is hazardous while
you continue in this irritable state:—I will
therefore wait here and see Miss Fitz-Hayman
myself; and so contrive as to bring you off
this time, and for the future you must ma∣nage
it yourself."</P>
<P>"I am sure you despise me, Doctor,"—cried
Willoughby, "for the part I have acted
in this cursed affair."</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153"/>
"No," answered he, "not exactly so—But
I own I think you wrong, inasmuch as any
kind of dissimulation is unworthy of you; and
above all, that which goes to rob a young
woman of her heart under false pretences."</P>
<P>"But I hope I have not done that—for,
upon my honour, I should never forgive my∣self,
if I had."</P>
<P>It looks very like it though, my friend,
from your own account of the matter—And
if it is so—</P>
<P>"You think I ought, at all events, to
marry her?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I do."</P>
<P>"Alas, my dear Sir," said Willoughby,
"it is surely better for me—even more ho∣nourable,
to decline her hand now, than to
accept it and make her miserable."</P>
<P>"I don't believe you could make any wo∣man
miserable," answered Dr. B—, "be∣cause
you have good nature, honour, and ge∣nerosity—but,
my dear Sir, I did not mean to
play the casuist in such an affair—and here—if
I am not mistaken, is the lady herself at
the door."</P>
<P>"Dear Doctor," cried Willoughby, "have
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
the goodness to go down directly." He im∣mediately
obeyed—and returning in a few
moments, said, "Well, I have sent away the
disconsolate fair one—broken-hearted—for
fear of losing her love."</P>
<P>"Don't rally me, my friend,"—answered
Willoughby—"But, tell me, did my cousin
appear very much concerned?"</P>
<P>"She endeavoured at least to appear so."</P>
<P>"Do you think then it was merely en∣deavour?"</P>
<P>"Would you not be mortified, now, if I
said it seemed so to me?"</P>
<P>"No, upon my honour—I might perhaps
be mortified to find that I was believed to be
an easy subject of imposition—but for the rest—nothing
would be a greater relief to me, than to
be well assured that the partiality my cousin
shewed for me was either never real, or, having
been so, exists no longer."</P>
<P>"I don't know her enough," replied Dr.
B—, "nor have I been long enough talk∣ing
to her now to be a very good judge.—The
honestest of them, my friend, are not
easily understood—and I am much mistaken
if your fair relation comes under that descrip∣tion.—
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
I mean, when I say honestest—the most
candid—the most sincere."</P>
<P>"Well! but what do you judge, from her
behaviour just now, are Miss Fitz-Hayman's
sentiments towards me?"</P>
<P>"She would have me believe, I think,
that they are those of great attachment and
trembling apprehension for your health—But,
somehow, it was, I fancied, a sort of concern
that had more stage effect for its object, than
real concern ever thinks about—and I do be∣lieve,
that if you <HI>do</HI> prove a perjured swain
after all, the heiress of Castlenorth will not
add to the sorrowful catalogue of damsels who
have died for love."</P>
<P>Willoughby, glad to hear this, now rea∣dily
promised a ready acquiescence with his
friend's orders, which were to keep his mind
as quiet as he could, and to see nobody till
he had quite conquered his remaining indispo∣sition;
and the Doctor then took his leave.</P>
<P>In less than two hours, a large pacquet came
to him from Lord Castlenorth—which Wil∣loughby
sent word down to the man who
brought it, that he was then too ill to open—On
Farnham's delivering this message, the
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
servant said, that no answer then was requir∣ed,
for that his lord and lady, their daugh∣ter,
Mrs. Calder, and Captain Cavanaugh,
had all departed, with the servants who were
immediately about them, the very moment he
came away, and were then, in two post coaches
and four, on their way to Rochester.</P>
<P>Willoughby felt for a moment as much re∣lieved
by this intelligence, as if half his trou∣bles
had been removed by their departure.—Too
soon, however, this temporary respite
ended, by his recollecting how much he must
yet encounter before he could feel himself
free; and that whatever freedom he might
regain, Celestina would be another's.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time Celestina was alone at
Cheltenham, indulging that regret which
arose from the certain loss of Willoughby's
friendship, and the assurance that she should
see him no more.—Every day she expected to
see in the newspapers, or to hear from Lady
Horatia, that he was married—and though
she tried to reason herself into a calm acqui∣escence
with what was unavoidable, she never
opened a paper or a letter without trembling.</P>
<P>But her own unhappiness prevented her not
from feeling for the unhappiness of her friends.
The letter she had received from Emily Cath∣cart
had made a great impression upon her—though
she knew not how it would be proper
to act to answer the views of the writer.—At
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
length she determined to write to Mrs. El∣phinstone,
and enclose the letter itself—and
this she did a few days after she was settled at
Cheltenham.</P>
<P>Almost every post brought her accounts of
the amendment of Montague Thorold, from
Lady Horatia, who visited him constantly—and
in almost every letter she expressed, either
plainly or by implication, her expectations
that Celestina would attend to the wishes of
all her friends, and give him her hand imme∣diately
on his recovery.—This repeated im∣portunity
from a person to whose wishes,
and for whose opinion she felt so much de∣ference
to be due, was infinitely painful to
her; but how to escape from it she knew
not.—If she quitted Lady Horatia she had
no proper protection—no home to receive
her—and though her little income had hi∣therto
more than sufficed to support her
while with such a friend, and though she had
received about an hundred pounds from
Cathcart, paid her by the direction of Wil∣loughby
while he was abroad, which yet re∣mained
almost untouched, yet on such a sum,
and on the interest of fifteen hundred pounds,
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
she could not with any degree of prudence
adopt the plan on which her imagination had
lately dwelt with peculiar pleasure—that of
setting out alone, or with only a female ser∣vant,
and travelling through France. She
fancied that there she might be enabled,
though she had yet no clue to guide her, to
find some traces of her family.—An invincible
inclination, which she sometimes took for the
inspiration of heaven, had been for some weeks
gaining on her imagination—and every thing
seemed to encourage it; but reason and pru∣dence,
both of which were perhaps decidedly
in favour of her accepting the proper esta∣blishment
offered her, by a man who had
not only given so many proofs of his sincere
and tender affection for her, but who was
the son of one of her best friends, and avow∣edly
recommended to her by another—a man
too whom she preferred to every other person
except Willoughby, and whom she would
have chosen had Willoughby never been in
question.</P>
<P>For her it was very certain that he was in
question no longer; he was in fact dead to
her—and no probability remained of his ever
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
feeling for her even the regret that the loss of
an agreeable acquaintance might have given
him.—But still her heart and her imagina∣tion
had been so long accustomed to consider
him as their first object, that she found it im∣possible
for her to transfer to another the
same attachment; and without being sensible
of love she could not promise it—she desired
nothing but to be permitted to live single;
and be mistress of her time and herself—and
not to be importuned to undertake duties
which her heart told her she could not con∣scientiously
fulfil.</P>
<P>But she foresaw too evidently, that while
she remained in her present situation, and
Lady Horatia continued so eager for the
match, her life must pass in a continual con∣flict
between her wish to gratify her friend,
and her disinclination to marriage. At her
time of life, professions of a resolution to re∣main
single were merely laughed at, and
never believed; and Montague Thorold had
never hitherto considered her gentle refusals
and friendly admonitions to desist, but as be∣ing
in reality as much encouragement as she
could give him, while her situation in regard
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
to Willoughby remained soaukwardly undecid∣ed—that
while he might renounce the name
of lover, he might still assume that of a near re∣lation,
and have the power of controuling, or
at least of directing her.</P>
<P>Now that it was decided, beyond a doubt,
that he neither meant to avail himself of either
the one or the other, she saw that she had no∣thing
to urge in support of her refusal which
would be listened to; and while her mind
dwelt on all the friendly but still irksome
controversy in which she must of necessity be
engaged when Lady Horatia and Thorold
came down, it of course adverted to the means
of relief, which could, she thought, be obtain∣ed
only by her quitting England—and for
her doing so, her natural desire to discover
her parents was, she thought, a sufficient ex∣cuse.</P>
<P>In her present solitude she found so much to
soothe and console her, that she longed for no∣thing
so much as the power of enjoying it, and
at the same time wandering through various
countries, and particularly through that which
she had been taught to consider as her own. The
longer she thought of this plan, the more agree∣able
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
it became to her imagination; and she
passed many hours every day in reading travels
through France, Italy, and Switzerland, still
humouring this visionary idea till it had ac∣quired
the force of a <HI>presentiment;</HI> a persua∣sion
that could she go to the South of France
she should find her family.</P>
<P>Of this she continually thought: of this she
continually dreamed; and though one great
motive that would haveurged her to attempt it,
the possibility of being restored to Willoughby,
was at an end, she still determined to execute
this plan before the summer elapsed.</P>
<P>She had indeed nothing but her gratitude
and attachment to Lady Horatia to detain
her in England—she could not go to Jessy,
because it was so near Alvestone; nor enjoy
the friendly and instructive conversation of
Mr. Thorold, because of the unfortunate par∣tiality
of his son.—The sole remaining friend
of her childhood, Lady Molyneux, was not
merely estranged from her, but had invariably
treated her with negligence, scorn, and con∣tempt.—To
England therefore she had at least
no friends who attached her—the whole world
was her country; and with that restlessness
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
to which the unhappy are subject, she fancied
that in any part of it she should find more
satisfaction than in her present situation.</P>
<P>By her wandering continually alone in the
pleasant country that surrounded the town
where she resided, at a season too when the
face of nature was every day growing more
lovely, her talent for poetry, which sometimes
remained for whole months unexercised, was
again called forth; but whatever were the ob∣jects
really before her, whatever were present∣ed
to her mind by books, Willoughby was
ever the principal figure in the landscape.—If
she sat on the green hill, as she often did for
hours together, lost in mournful yet not un∣pleasing
reverie, it was only to recollect scenes
that were passed; which the same sounds she
had then heard, the simple sheep-bell, the
early song of birds; the same scents of fresh
turf and wild flowers, brought again most
forcibly to her recollection.</P>
<P>If in her reading, she was by the traveller's
lively description of the countries he had
passed through, to fancy herself there, she re∣verted
instantly to the delight she should have
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
felt could she in a progress through such ro∣mantic
scenes have been the companion of
Willoughby; and it was in this disposition of
mind, that after perusing an account of a
cottage and its inhabitants overwhelmed by
the fall of an avalanche, a great body of snow
from the mountain above, she composed the
following little lyric poem.</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>THE PEASANT OF THE ALPS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHERE cliffs arise by Winter crown'd,</L>
<L>And through dark groves of pine around,</L>
<L>Down the chasms, the snow-fed torrents foam,</L>
<L>Within some hollow, shelter'd from the storms,</L>
<L>The PEASANT of the ALPS his cottage forms,</L>
<L>And builds his humble, happy home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unenvied is the rich domain,</L>
<L>That far beneath him on the plain,</L>
<L>Waves its wide harvests and its olive groves,</L>
<L>More dear to him his hut, with plantain thatch'd,</L>
<L>Where long his unambitious heart attach'd,</L>
<L>Finds all he wishes, all he loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
<L>There dwells the mistress of his heart,</L>
<L>And <HI>love,</HI> who teaches every art,</L>
<L>Has bid him dress the spot with fondest care;</L>
<L>When borrowing from the vale its fertile soil,</L>
<L>He climbs the precipice with patient toil,</L>
<L>To plant her favorite flow'rets there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With native shrubs, an hardy race,</L>
<L>There the green myrtle finds a place,</L>
<L>And roses there, the dewy leaves decline;</L>
<L>While from the craggs abrupt and tangled steeps,</L>
<L>With bloom and fruit the Alpine berry peeps,</L>
<L>And blushing, mingles with the vine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His garden's simple produce stored,</L>
<L>Prepar'd for him by hands adored,</L>
<L>Is all the little luxury he knows;</L>
<L>And by the same dear hands are softly spread,</L>
<L>The Chamois' velvet spoil that forms the bed</L>
<L>Where in her arms he finds repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But absent from the calm abode,</L>
<L>Dark thunder gathers round his road,</L>
<L>Wild raves the wind, the arrowy lightnings flash,</L>
<L>Returning quick the murmuring rocks among,</L>
<L>His faint heart trembling as he winds along;</L>
<L>Alarm'd!—he listens to the crash</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of rifted ice!—Oh, man of woe!</L>
<L>O'er his dear cot—a mass of snow,</L>
<L>By the storm sever'd from the cliff above,</L>
<L>Has fallen—and buried in its marble breast,</L>
<L>All that for him—lost wretch—the world possest,</L>
<L>His home, his happiness, his love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
<L>Aghast the heart-struck mourner stands,</L>
<L>Glaz'd are his eyes—convuls'd his hands,</L>
<L>O'erwhelming anguish checks his labouring breath;</L>
<L>Crush'd by despair's intolerable weight,</L>
<L>Frantic he seeks the mountain's giddiest height,</L>
<L>And headlong seeks relief in death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A fate too similar is mine,</L>
<L>But I—in lingering pain repine,</L>
<L>And still my lost felicity deplore;</L>
<L>Cold, cold to me is that dear breast become,</L>
<L>Where this poor heart had fondly fix'd its home,</L>
<L>And love and happiness are mine no more.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>While Celestina was thus, with more tender∣ness
than discretion, cherishing the memory
of the friend she had lost, Willoughby was
very differently occupied from what her ima∣gination
suggested.—Instead of being the gay
and fortunate lover, on the eve of marrying
one of the greatest heiresses in England, he
was suffering in his personal health, from the
anxiety of a mind at war with itself—and cer∣tain
of nothing but that for him the world no
longer contained any happiness.—The intel∣ligence,
however vague, and like the com∣mon
gossipping stories so usual among servants,
that he had received from Farnham, had made
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
a great impression, which what he afterwards
gathered from the same quarter had increased.
Justina had told Farnham, as a secret however
of the first importance, that Captain Cava∣naugh
had been of late in the habit of being
admitted to her young lady's dressing-room
after Lady Castlenorth and the family were
retired, however late the hour might be—that
her young lady was obliged to entrust
her with these visits, that they might be more
securely concealed from the rest of the family;
but that sometimes she had been dismissed to
bed, and sometimes ordered to wait till he re∣tired.—That
on some of those occasions she
observed her young lady had been crying, by
the redness of her eyes; and that then the
Captain had always left her with the air of a
man much offended.—That she had some∣times
heard them talk in voices as if they
were arguing upon something, but could ne∣ver
distinctly understand what their conversa∣tion
was about.—"They were in sad fright
always," said Justina, "that Miladi hear
them.—Miladi knows not at all what goes on
in this house."—"And my lady, I suppose,"
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
said Farnham, "would be in a horrible pas∣sion
if she heard of it?" "Oh, for me," re∣plied
she, "I could not stay if she did find
it out."—"But why," enquired Farnham,
"why, if your young lady likes the Captain
so as to have him keep company with her in
this manner, what does she mean by marry∣ing
my master?" Justina then, with an arch
look, answered, "Oh, my good friend, the
Captain has one wife already; and why should
not my young lady have one husband?—The
Captain will be her Cecisbeo—cavalier
servante."—"I don't understand your French
out-of-the-way names," replied Farnham;
"but I am sure, that if your lady marries
my master only to play such pranks as some
other fine ladies do, she will get into a bad
scrape—for he is not a man to be quiet when
such fort of doings are a-going on, that I can
tell her—and if she don't love him better than
any other man, I think she had much better
say so."—"Oh, silly man,"—answered Jus∣tina—"as
if my young lady could not have
a regard for both of them!"—"Aye, aye,"
replied Farnham, "that may do well enough
in your country—but it will never do here."—
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
Justina now, afraid that Farnham's zeal for
his master would perhaps urge him to reveal
the dangerous secret with which she had thus
entrusted him, began to soften the harshest
features of it; by saying, that she believed
there was no harm at all in the friendship be∣tween
her young lady and Captain Cava∣naugh—that
to be sure, the Captain was a
sweet handsome man, and very agreeable—and
therefore her young lady liked to talk with
him, which she never could do when her mo∣ther
was by; as she never suffered him to
speak hardly to any body else—and that it
was natural enough for her lady to like the
Captain, and have a regard for him, because
she had known him so long.—She ended her
conversation with exacting from Farnham a
promise that he would never mention a syl∣lable
to any body of what she had told him;
a promise which he kept, however, only till
he could reveal it all to his master.</P>
<P>Willoughby had, after receiving this in∣formation,
no longer a doubt as to breaking
off instantly his proposed alliance; but how,
without plunging a dagger in the heart of his
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
uncle, to do this, required some considera∣tion.—Lord
Castlenorth had sent him full di∣rections
as to paying off all the incumbrances
upon his estate, and deposited the money at
a banker's, where he had also left a large sum
for his own use; and expecting him to join
the family at Paris, if he did not overtake
them sooner; and was now pleasing himself
with the idea, that in a very few days the fa∣vourite
project of his life would be com∣pleted;
and that in adopting the son of his
sister, and uniting him with his daughter, he
should transmit his name and his honours to
posterity with little variation from lineal de∣scent—It
was this hope, that seemed to have
sustained his feeble existence to its present pe∣riod,
in spite of the numerous infirmities he
laboured under, and even of the prescriptions
and nursing of Mrs. Calder—And though it
was impossible for Willoughby either to love
or esteem such a man as Lord Castlenorth,
yet he felt for him some regard, as his mo∣ther's
brother, and some pity not only for his
real but his imaginary sufferings, which he
knew must be dreadfully increased, and per∣haps
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
become fatal, from so heavy a disap∣pointment
of all his expectations.</P>
<P>He hesitated, then, how to act; whether to
write or go to him—or whether he should not
rather address himself to Lady Castlenorth or
her daughter; and for two days after their
departure, had been unable to resolve on any
thing, when a porter, who immediately dis∣appeared,
gave to the servant of the house a
letter for him.—It was evidently written in a
foreign hand, and in a foreign idiom—though
pains seemed to have been taken to disguise
both—The contents were these:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>One who is and will be always a stranger
to you, takes the liberty to approach you
with this advice so important to you—and
fearing it may be soon too late—</P>
<P>You are, Sir, on the point of being
married, as the report goes, to the daughter
of Lord Castlenorth, Miss Fitz-Hayman,
your relation—I have cause to know that her
heart is belonging to another person, and only
chagrin and inquietude will be the effect, if
you execute this marriage, whatever may have
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
seemed to the contrary.—If there is any doubt
of the truth of this, a little observation, or
making enquiry among those near her, will
explain what I would say: and if there is
question of the person she has a great friend∣ship
for, you have only to think of those
who are always with her. A word they say
to the wise is enough for them to understand—I
have the honour to be,</P>
<CLOSER>With profound respect,
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your devoted servant,
Unknown.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Willoughby had no sooner read this letter,
than it struck him that it was written, either
by Cavanaugh himself, or by some person
employed by him—and his motive evidently
was to prevent a marriage he now saw so
nearly concluded, and which would destroy
all his hopes of securing to himself this opu∣lent
heiress—rather than her mother, whose
lavish fondness for him had enabled him—by
some means or other—it was probable they
were not very justifiable means, to release
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
himself from his former engagements—en∣gagements
which, with far other views, she had
assisted him to dissolve.</P>
<P>Many concurring circumstances strength∣ened
the persuasion that this letter was fa∣bricated,
if not written, by Cavanaugh.—It
seemed to be the translation of a letter first writ∣ten
in French, and Willoughby heard that Ca∣vanaugh
could not write English with facility
from long disuse.—It was certainly Cava∣naugh's
interest, by any means, to stop the
marriage between him and Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
which perhaps no means could have
done more effectually; since from the tears
she had frequently been observed by Justina
to shed in their long conferences, it was
probable his arguments had failed of their
effect.</P>
<P>If Willoughby had before felt something
like antipathy towards Miss Fitz-Hayman,
which he never could wholly conquer, he
now found it amounting to abhorrence and
detestation.—The love she had shewn towards
him must either have been the effect of art or
of vice—and both were to him equally odious.
That she could hope to impose upon him by
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
the one, or think him a proper object for the
indulgence of the other, were ideas equally
hateful and equally humiliating; and under
the first impulse of indignation, he was tempt∣ed
to write to her, and, inclosing the letter
from his anonymous correspondent, add to it
all the circumstances Farnham had learned of
Justina, as reasons why he renounced her with
contempt.</P>
<P>But after a little reflection, his manly and
generous spirit inspired him with far other
designs.—It was possible, that his cousin,
whom he now considered with as much dis∣like,
but with more compassion, might yet
be saved from the artifices of a villain—and
he thought himself bound to attempt it by
every exertion, except the sacrifice of him∣self
in marriage. It was possible that his
uncle, though he could not make that sa∣crifice
to gratify him, might yet be in some
degree preserved from the dreadful shock
which his daughter's conduct must give him,
were it described to him in the horrid light he
himself now saw it in; or revealed to him by
any one less cautious than himself. Distressing,
therefore, as the scenes must be that he should
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
have to go through, when, instead of joining
the family, to complete his marriage, he should
meet them with those charges which put an
end to it for ever; he determined to follow
them immediately; and writing to Cathcart
such instructions as were most requisite, as to
the management of his affairs, and without
hinting how different the purpose of his jour∣ney
was from what it was supposed to be,
he departed as soon as his physician dismissed
him, for the Continent; which was in some∣thing
more than a week after the Castlenorths
had left London.</P>
<P>Every body concluded that he was gone to
his bride; and every body's conjectures remain∣ed
uncontradicted—Lady Horatia, in her letters
to Celestina, told her that Lord Castlenorth's
illness having obliged him to quit England,
on a very short notice, Willoughby and Miss
Fitz—Hayman had been privately warned the
day before they set out; that some business,
as to his estates, detained him afterwards five
or six days in London; but that he was now
gone to the Castlenorth family at Paris, and
was to proceed with them to pass the summer in
Italy. The same account found its way into the
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
public prints, and was received without any
doubt.—Celestina shed many tears over the
first information she received, and then ac∣cusing
herself of folly, tried to dry them, and
to detach her mind from thinking of Wil∣loughby—but
this no effort enabled her to
do; and though all anxiety was now lost in
the most painful certainty, she sunk from
fruitless solicitude into hopeless dejection.</P>
<P>In such a frame of mind Lady Horatia
found her—when after a separation of about
three weeks, she rejoined her at Cheltenham.
With her arrived Montague Thorold, quite
recovered of his wound, deriving from it,
and from thus being allowed to attend Ce∣lestina,
more hope than ever; while his love
seemed to have increased, if to increase
were possible; and while his sufferings and
his merit certainly rendered him interesting
to Celestina, and combined to entitle him
to her friendship, her pity, and esteem;
she felt, and felt with regret, that, decided
as she believed her fate now to be in regard
to Willoughby—friendship, esteem, and pity,
were yet all she could give to Montague Tho∣rold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WlLLOUGHBY, with every sensation that
could render such a journey unpleasant, pro∣ceeded
to Paris, where he learned that his
uncle impatiently waited for him;—had he
gone immediately to him, he must have
crush'd at once, all the expectations his appear∣ance
raifed: and the shock must have been
too great and too cruel. He determined at
first, therefore, to write to Lady Castlenorth—yet
after some reflection, doubted whether it
would not be better to give the letter he had
received to Miss Fitz-Hayman; and leave it
to her to find the means of dismissing him,
without his being compelled to assign the true
reason. It was still possible that the charges
against her might be unfounded or exaggerat∣ed.
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
It is possible, that were they neither, he
might rescue her from the abyss to which she
seemeed to be devoting herself.—But, from
the pride and violence of her temper, and
from that imperious spirit, which had never
yet borne to be told of an error, he not only
felt great uneasiness from the idea of the scene
that was before him, but doubted whether
the person for whose sake he was willing to
encounter it, would not baffle all his endea∣vours
to rescue her from evil, or conceal her
errors by clamour and resentment.</P>
<P>After some deliberation, however, as it was
necessary to fix on something, he wrote a short
note to Miss Fitz-Hayman, desiring she would
favour him with a few moments conversation;
and entreating her, for reasons which he would
then explain to her, not to inform Lord or
Lady Castlenorth of his arrival at Paris, till
after he had seen her.</P>
<P>This note he sent by Farnham to Justina,
to be delivered to her mistress; and received
in a short time an answer, that she should be
alone that evening at ten o'clock, and that
Justina should conduct him to her, in her own
dressing room.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179"/>
He found, her sitting alone; and, under
the appearance of receiving him with pleasure,
there was, he thought, a lurking apprehension
of the occasion of this mysterious visit.—He
felt himself extremely distressed how to open
such a conversation; but the consciousness of
rectitude, and some degree of indignant resent∣ment,
immediately restored that calmness and
resolution, which on his first entrance he feared
he might fail of commanding.</P>
<P>He began by apologizing for the liberty he
had taken in thus soliciting an interview with
her, before he saw the other parts of the
family. "But, I am persuaded, Madam," con∣tinued
he, advancing towards her, with the
letter open in his hand, "that whatever
foundation there may befor the assertion which
this letter contains, it will be less uneasy to
you to read it yourself—than to have any ap∣peal
made on it to Lord and Lady Castle∣north."—She
took the letter with an air of
mingled astonishment and indignation; but
Willoughby saw it tremble in her hand—"a
letter, Sir, in which mention is made of me!—I
am really quite at a loss to know what
there can be in it, that I should, in your
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
opinion, wish to have it concealed"—"It is not
long, Madam," said Willoughby, fixing his
eyes on her face; "and if you will have the
goodness to read it"—"Oh, certainly, Sir"—She
ran her eyes over it, and as he atten∣tively
watched her countenance, he saw pride
struggling to conquer fear and shame, and
with some degree of success; for having read
it, she paused a moment, and then assuming
an air of haughty resentment, she threw the
letter on the table that was between her and
Willoughby—and said, contemptuously, "I
know not whether most to despise, the Author
of such a letter, or the man who—if indeed
he is not included in both descriptions—can
poorly make it a pretence for insulting a
person, who has already been too much his
victim."—"Pardon me, Madam," said Wil∣loughby,
"for interrupting you; but I must
take leave to say, that I am included in nei∣ther—a
moment's reflection will convince you
that I am incapable of the latter; and had the
former been my object, I should not have
chosen this method of shewing this extraordi∣nary
billet to you; nor thus put it in your
power to detect the author, without any ha∣zard
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
to yourself of having his charges be∣lieved.
Miss Fitz-Hayman, I will be very
ingenuous with you:—the person here alluded
to, is Captain Cavanaugh—I know it: I know
that the partiality, whether real or affected,
with which you have appeared to favor me,
has been superseded by his more eminent merit;
and, though I am very willing to relinquish all
prospect of an honor of which I am unworthy,—I
cannot feel much satisfaction, in reflect∣ing
on the idea you seemed to have enter∣tained
of my facility or blindness;—nor, in∣deed,
can I, without regret, see you likely
to—"</P>
<P>"Say, rather, Sir," interrupted Miss Fitz-Hayman—"Say,
rather, that you rejoice in
having found, or made, an excuse to break
through the promises you have given—from
which, however, Sir, you would have been
released without degrading yourself, by this
poor and unmanly artifice.—The daughter of
Lord Castlenorth need not, surely, solicit the
hand of any man." Pride and anger now choak∣ed
her utterance; and Willoughby, taking ad∣vantage
of her want of words, again seized the
opportunity to speak; he took her hand
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
which she would have snatched from him,
but he continued to detain it, while, in the
gentlest accents of friendly remonstrance, he
said, "Come, come, my dear cousin—if I
am not your lover—at least, I can never be
your enemy.—For Heaven's sake, be not your
own; confide in me, and believe that I will
rather take the blame and inconvenience of
our separation on myself, than suffer you to in∣cur
either with your father—you cannot sup∣pose,
I trust you do not even wish, I should
proceed farther in forming the alliance that
brought me hither, knowing what I know."</P>
<P>"And what do you know, Sir; and from
whom have you obtained this knowledge."</P>
<P>"From sources, which render it impossible
that I should be mistaken—Captain Cava∣naugh."</P>
<P>He was proceeding; but, either from the
tone in which he spoke, or some other circum∣stance
which at that moment struck her, she
was suddenly impressed with a fear that he had
been calling Cavanaugh himself to an account;
who, as it happened, had not that day dined
with them.—This idea threw her instantly
off her guard—she turned pale, and asked in
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
an altered and tremulous tone—"what he
meant by these sources of information?"</P>
<P>Willoughby saw immediately what she be∣lieved;
and the truth of the information he
had received from Justina was evident beyond
a doubt. Her fears for her own reputation,
or of the anger of her father, she could con∣quer;
but the moment she apprehended that
the life of Cavanaugh either had been, or
might be hazarded, her fortitude failed her.
It was now the moment to pursue the truth,
which Willoughby, by soothing her, while he
kept the idea of her lover's danger in view,
at length, with great difficulty, obtained, by
her half indignant, half contrite avowal—that
Cavanaugh had been a too successful candi∣date
for her heart—and that her father and
her mother's eager wishes, together with some
other motives, which Willoughby discerned,
through the confusion and agitation with
which she attempted to palliate or conceal
them, had prompted her to affect for him a
passion she had not felt since she had been in
the habits of listening to Cavanaugh.</P>
<P>Willoughby looked back with terror to the
danger he had escaped—and with infinite pity,
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
mingled with less gentle emotions, cast his eyes
again on his cousin; he found her so deeply
entangled by the art of Cavanaugh, that to
save her from him, was no longer in his
power; but it was possible perhaps to take
upon himself the anger and indignation of
Lord and Lady Castlenorth, and give her time
to arrange her own plans, by immediately
withdrawing in silence; though, how any com∣fortable
arrangement could be made for her,
with a man who was understood to be already
married, he knew not; nor how Lady Castle∣north
would bear so cruel a blow, as the
preference thus given to her daughter by a
man whom she certainly had intended as suc∣cessor
to her present husband, whenever his in∣firmities
should release her. When the first
tumult of those passions, which fear, shame,
and love, had excited in the bosom of Miss
Fitz-Hayman, subsided, by the kind and con∣siderate
arguments of Willoughby, she be∣came
able to talk with some degree of calm∣ness
on the subject; and he found that from
the last renewal of their acquaintance with Cap∣tain
Cavanaugh, this design had been certainly
entertained by Lady Castlenorth; but that, on
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
his part, no other advantage had been taken
of her extreme partiality towards him, than
to obtain, by her means, money to enable
him to prosecute a divorce from his wife—a
young woman whom he had married some
years before for the sake of some fortune, and
a great deal of beauty, which she then pos∣sessed.—Having
in two or three years dissi∣pated
the former, he left her to make what
advantage she could of the latter; and had
never troubled himself about her since, till
his reception in the family of Lord Castle∣north
opened to him prospects of carrying off
the rich heiress—and made him desirous of ob∣taining
a dissolution of his marriage, for which
his wife's ill conduct, though entirely owing
to his desertion of her, gave him a very
good pretence. Much of this Willoughby
learned from various little circumstances
which escaped Miss Fitz-Hayman in this
long conversation; for her representation of
him was, that of the most amiable and un∣fortunate
of men; married early in life to a
woman insensible of his merit; and now ren∣dered
unhappy by a passion for another ob∣ject,
whom he had long seen on the point of
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
being given to a rival, who saw her with very
different eyes.</P>
<P>Willoughby could not, without astonish∣ment,
observe the blind infatuation of a wo∣man,
possessed of rather a good understand∣ing:
but he found that the art of Cavanaugh,
to the success of which his very handsome
figure had undoubtedly contributed, had so
completely attained the government of Miss
Fitz-Hayman's mind, that she no longer saw
but with his eyes; and that while, to prevent
any suspicion on the part of her mother, she
had been suffered to affect a degree of affec∣tion
for Willoughby, which had long since
ceased—Cavanaugh trusted to his reluctance
to delay a marriage, which it was easy to see he
dreaded; and hoped that the divorce would be
obtained before that reluctance would be con∣quered—he
found, however, that Willoughby
suddenly agreed to hasten it; and then it was
that, in his conference with her, after the rest of
the family were in bed, he urged her to find
delays; and to procrastinate, herself, a period,
to the arrival of which Willoughby no longer
seemed averse.—Her tears, and the alarm in
which Justina had observed her, were the effects
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
of the earnestness and impetuosity with which
Cavanaugh now pressed the necessity of her
doing this; and the alternative he sometimes
offered her, of declaring to Willoughby him∣self,
the footing upon which he was with her.—Her
father's illness, fortunately for her, inter∣vened;
and now Cavanaugh was every hour in
hopes that he should be set free from his ma∣trimonial
engagements—and possess himself
of the prize so long the object of his ambi∣tion,
and the end of all his designs.</P>
<P>Miss Fitz-Hayman and Willoughby now
were to discuss the means by which, with
the least prejudice to her, their intended
union could then be broken off.—The lady,
though she did not ingenuously own it, had
many reasons for accepting, unconditionally,
her cousin's generous offer, to take the whole
burthen of their displeasure upon himself.—She
knew, hot only the extravagant and furi∣ous
passions which any suspicion of its real
cause would excite in her mother, but she
was aware of the increasing fondness of her
father for his nephew; and apprehended,
that if he appeared the injured and forsaken
person, that fondness might urge him to make
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
him amends, by giving him a part of the
great sums and estates that were in his own
power—and this, rich as she would still have
been, she had not any disposition to pro∣mote.</P>
<P>After some debate, then, in what way
Willoughby should excuse himself, and his
rejection (on account of their falsehood) of
some method which Miss Fitz-Hayman pro∣posed;
he at length determined to write to
Lady Castlenorth, stating simply, that he
had changed his mind, and found it impossi∣ble
to fulfil his engagements: and leave it to
her to break it to her Lord as she thought
proper; for he imagined any letter from him∣self
might be a still severer shock, unless he
could assign better reasons than any it was
possible for him to offer.</P>
<P>This point being settled, Miss Fitz-Hay∣man
retired to recover herself from the effects
of the scene she had passed through; and to
study her part in those that were to come.—Willoughby
returned, unseen by all but Jus∣tina,
to his hotel; where he composed a short
note to the purport they had agreed Upon;
and early the next morning he set out on
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
horseback for Lyons, from whence he intend∣ed
to proceed, along the coast of the Medi∣terranean,
to the Pyrenees, and to pass some
weeks among those mountains which he had
never yet seen.</P>
<P>The recent and extraordinary events that
had befallen him, gave his mind sufficient
subject for contemplation, during the first
part of his journey.—It was now very certain
that he was for ever released, and that by
means which left him nothing to reproach
himself with, from his engagements with Miss
Fitz-Hayman, and of course from that pro∣mise
to his mother, in consequence of which
those engagements were made.—One great
objection, then, to his union with Celestina
was thus removed; and never did her image
more tenderly occupy his thoughts than at
this moment: but, alas! it was no longer
cherished with delight. The mystery that
clouded her birth, and which he despaired of
ever removing, empoisoned the pleasure with
which he would have thought of her; and
with yet greater bitterness, he adverted to the
probability there was that she was now the
wife of another.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190"/>
Very certain that he should now never find
that happiness of which her loss had deprived
him, the lesser evils—evils from which, a few
years before, he would have shrunk with dis∣may,
seemed to have lost their effect.—It was
almost impossible for him, without injustice
to others and uneasiness to himself, to keep such
a place as Alvestone, in the present shattered
state of his fortune; and resolving to disem∣barrass
himself from the necessity of returning
to England, for some years, he wrote from
Lyons, to Cathcart, giving him directions to
put the estate to sale: and at the same time
informed the banker, in whose hands Lord
Castlenorth had left money for the discharge
of all his incumbrances, that he should not
avail himself of it; but that it must be re∣placed
to his uncle's account.</P>
<P>Having thus loosened almost every tie that
connected him with England, from which he
did not wish even to hear, left the inform∣ation
of Celestina's marriage should reach
him,
<Q>The World was all before him where to chuse;</Q>
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
and his utmost hope was, to obtain, by change
of place, so much tranquillity of mind, as to
allow him to feel some satisfaction in the va∣riety
of the scenes it offered.</P>
<P>He journeyed from Lyons to Avignon;
and then proceeded along the coast, by Be∣zieres
and Mirepoix, into Roussillon: interested
by the grandeur and beauty of these remains
of Roman antiquity which he saw in his way;
still more charmed by the sublime views,
which, in this romantic line of country, every
where offered themselves to his sight; and
hearing, and <HI>but</HI> hearing, at a distance, the
tumults, with which a noble struggle for free∣dom
at this time (the summer of 1789) agi∣tated
the capital, and many of the great
towns of France, till, among the wild and
stupendous scenes which he at length reached,
even this faint murmur died away.</P>
<P>In one of the cottages scattered at the foot
of Montlouis, he found a young mountaineer,
acquainted with all the passes of the Pyrenees:
he was there only for a few days, on his way
back from Perpignan to his home, in the
Vallei de Douron; and on Willoughby pro∣posing
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
it to him, he most willingly undertook
to be his guide through the mountains.</P>
<P>Willoughby had left his horses at Perpig∣nan,
and his present equipage consisted only
of Farnham, carrying a light portmanteau,
and a sort of havresac for provisions, which
he took himself, strapped over his shoulders.</P>
<P>On the morning of his departure from the
foot of Montlouis, he travelled towards the
south-east, always ascending, and was soon
in the very heart of the Pyrenees. In scenes
which had hardly ever been traversed but by
the shepherds and goat-herds, and where no
vestiges of man were seen, but here and there
a solitary cabin, serving them for shelter,
during a few weeks of summer, built of the
rough branches of pine or chesnut, covered
with turf, and lined with moss.—In these huts,
which were now some of them inhabited,
Willoughby found a wild, but simple and
benevolent people; always ready to supply
him with such food as their flocks, among
those desert regions, afforded to themselves;
and in one of them, on a temporary bed,
made of the skins of their sheep, whom acci∣dent
had destroyed, after a deep sigh, which
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
was drawn from him by the memory of Ce∣lestina,
and with which every day concluded,
he obtained a few hours of refreshing sleep,
and with the dawn of the next day pursued
his journey towards the summit of the moun∣tain.</P>
<P>Amid these paths that wound among the
almost perpendicular points of the cliffs, he
often sat down; surveying with awe and ad∣miration
the stupendous works of the Divine
Architect, before whose simplest creation, the
laboured productions of the most intelligent
of his, creatures sink into insignificance.—Huge
masses of grey marble, or a dark gra∣nite,
frowned above his head; whose crevices,
here and there, afforded a scanty subsistence
to lickens and moss campion; while the deso∣late
barrenness of other parts, added to that
threatening aspect with which they seemed
to hang over the wandering traveller, and to
bid him to fear, left even the light steps of
the Izard (the Chamois of the Pyrenees),
or the wild goats, who now and then ap∣appeared
suspended amid the craggy fissures,
shouldd isunite them from the mountain it∣self,
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
and bury him beneath their thundering
ruins.</P>
<P>Dashing down amongst these immense piles
of stone, the cataracts, formed by the melting
of the snows, and the ice of the glacieres, in
the bosom of the mountains, fell roaring into
dark and abyss-like chasms, whither the eye
feared to follow them—yet, frequently, amidst
the wildest horrors of these great objects, ap∣peared
some little green recess, shaded by im∣mense
pines, cedars, or mountain-ash; and
the short turf beneath them appeared spangled
with the Soldinella and fringed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dianthus superbus.</NOTE> pink, or
blushing with the scented wreaths of the
Daphne Cneorum—while through the cracks
and hollows of the surrounding wall of rock,
were filtered small and clear streams, that crept
away among the tufts of juniper, rosemary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rhododendron Alpina; dwarf rosehay. This plant supplies firing to the shepherds of the Pyrenees.</NOTE>,
and the Rhododendron of the Alps, that
clothed the less-abrupt declivity; where, un∣interrupted
by intervening crags, the moun∣tain
shelving gradually to its base, opened a
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
bosom more smiling and fertile; through
which the collected waters, no longer foaming
from their fall, found their way towards the
Mediterranean sea; their banks feathered with
woods of cork trees, chesnuts, and evergreen
oaks—while the eye, carried beyond them,
was lost in the wide and luxuriant plains of
Languedoc.</P>
<P>Never did such a spot offer itself to the
eyes of Willoughby, but the figure of Celes∣tina
was instantly present to his imagination—he
saw her sitting by him, enjoying the beau∣tiful
and romantic scenery; he heard her, in
those accents which had, long such power to
enchant him, expatiate on its charms, with
all that exquisite taste and feeling he knew
her possessed of; and remembering a charm∣ing
description given by Rousseau, in his
Julie, of a spot of this sort among the rocks
of Meillerie.—"II sembloit que ce lieu dé∣sert,
dût être l'asyle de deux amants; échappés
seuls au bouleversement de la nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seemed that this desart spot was designed as an asylum for two lovers, who had escaped the general wreck of nature.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196"/>
For a moment or two he indulged such a
delicious reverie, till the sudden recollection
of the truth cruelly destroyed it.—Celestina
was not, never could be his—never could
share with him the simple and sublime de∣light
offered by the superb spectacle of na∣ture—"with
all her great works about her."
Whether he was among the rude mountains
that she has raised as a barrier, to divide two
powerful nations; or gratified with the more
mild beauties of his native country, never
could she share in his satisfaction, or heighten
his enjoyment—but her hours and her talents
were all destined to make the happiness of
Montague Thorold.—At that idea he started
up, and hardly conscious of the rugged pre∣cipices
beneath him, renewed his wandering
researches; and sought, by activity of body,
to chase the fearful phantoms of lost happi∣ness
that haunted his mind.</P>
<P>He had now passed three weeks among the
Pyrenees; had traversed several Glaciers, and
descended on the Spanish side, and looked
over part of Catalonia.—Again he took his
way to their summits; again crossed deep
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
vallies of ice, and wandered over regions
where winter reigns in all its rigour, though
under a sky of the deepest blue, illuminated by
the ardent sun of July; a sky so clear, that
not even a fleeting summer cloud, for a mo∣ment,
diversifies its radiance.—One of the
tallest of these stupendous points is, Le pie du
midi de Bagneus, which seems to be the so∣vereign
of the inferior points around it:—from
its tall head he descended to Bagniers;
and there meaning to close his researches, he
rested some days, and then, by another route,
returned towards the country of Roussillon,
from whence he had first begun his journey.</P>
<P>But when he arrived there, he had nothing
to do but to form some scheme of farther pro∣gress;
and therefore, pleased as he was with
the variety and novelty offered him by this
long chain of immense mountains, he deter∣mined
to lengthen his stay amongst them.—His
guide, who had by this time acquired an
affection for him, delighted to carry him to
every place that he thought might offer either
novelty or amusement—and he now conversed
with the smuggler, who conveyed, at the ex∣tremest
peril, prohibited articles of commerce
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
between France and Spain; now joined the
solitary hunter of the Izard, or smaller Cha∣mois;
and now shared the more dangerous
toils of those who sought the bear, the wild
boar, or the wolf, among the deep woods that
clothed the sides of the mountains.</P>
<P>It was in an excursion with an hunter of
the Izard, that, Farnham having been left be∣hind
at the cabin of a shepherd where Wil∣loughby
intended to pass the night, he and
Gaston, his guide, were, by an accident, se∣parated;
and he found himself alone—on one
of the most savage spots of the whole chain—above
him arose a point covered by eternal
snow; beyond which a Glacier spread its desolate
and frozen surface for some miles, surrounded
every way by sharp and barren rocks: on one
side, fed by this magazine of ice and snow, a
broad and thundering torrent threw itself; fall∣ing,
with deafening noise, into a rocky cauldron,
so far below that the eye could not fathom it.—A
dark and apparently inaccessible wood of
firs was on the other side, where no tree or
plant could find its abode, that was not equally
able to endure the severity of those cold winds,
that, passing over these immense magazines of
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
ice, carry with them frost and desolation, even
into the rich vineyards and luxuriant pas∣tures
of Gascony and Languedoc, and there
assume the name of the Bize-wind.</P>
<P>Willoughby had lingered so long among
these mountains, that it was now the second
week of August.—The evenings were, of
course, somewhat shortening; and the sun was
visible only by reflection from the snowy point
above him, when he found himself lost on a
place where he knew not his way to any hu∣man
habitation, or was likely to hear the
sound of a human voice.—Little accustomed,
however, to fear of any kind, he sat himself
down on a piece of broken rock, to consider
if, by any of those remarks which Gaston had
taught him to make, he could find his way
before, night-fall to rejoin his servant and his
guide, or to find at least some place of shelter.</P>
<P>These observations, however, were impeded
by the clouds that seemed to arise from the
extensive plains below him, and to gather
round the base of the mountains.—These in∣creased
every moment, and at length sur∣rounded
him like waves; so that he no longer
distinguished the objects beneath him, while
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
immense volumes of white vapour were
poured like a sea between him and the neigh∣bouring
precipices.—He heard louder than
ever, but he no longer saw the torrent that
threw itself down within a few yards of
him; and had apprehension ever been, under
any circumstances, troublesome to him, he now
might well have feared that, lost in this chaos
of mist, he should at least remain all night
where he was, and perhaps never regain his
companions at all.</P>
<P>Life, however, had so few charms for him
at this moment, that his indifference for it,
added to his natural courage, when only him∣self
was in question, made him perfectly calm
and collected—though the thick clouds of
mist continued to gather and darken round
the spot where he was now compelled to re∣main.</P>
<P>For a few moments the sighing of the wind
which bore this floating vapour, the increased
hollow murmurs of the rushing waters of the
cataract, were interrupted only by the scream∣ing
vulture, and the deep hoarse raven, who
seemed by their cries, as they failed above the
grey abyss of mist, to be warning their com∣panions
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
of some approaching danger: thunder
was in fact gathered in the bosom of these
clouds, and Willoughby, as he sat on his so∣litary
rock, heard it muttering at his feet;
and after some tremendous bursts, which
seemed to shake the mountains to their foun∣dations,
accompanied by blue and vivid
lightning, a violent wind arose, and dispers∣ing
the foggy clouds, drove them, with the
storm generated in their bosom, to the coun∣try
beneath.</P>
<P>The last rays of the departed sun were now
reflected from the summits of snow, the air
became perfectly serene and Willoughby saw
distinctly every object around him. He ob∣served
at some distance to the left a cross, in
an elevated situation, but far below the ex∣tremest
point of the cliffs; and he recollected,
that the day before Gaston had shewn him
that cross, and had told him that near it
was the residence of a shepherd; and that not
far from it a convent, near the foot of the
mountain.—Towards this, therefore, he now
endeavoured to find his way; and by the help
of a stick, with an iron fixed at the end of it,
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
and by his own activity, he at length passed
difficulties that to many people would have
seemed insurmountable; and, attended only
by a terrier which had followed him from
England, and which had been the faithful
companion of all his wanderings, he reached
the pointed rock where the cross was erected.</P>
<P>It was now, however, so late, that he began
to despair of finding the hut which Gaston had
told him was situated something lower down.
The moon, indeed, was rising in majestic
beauty behind him; but her light, he feared,
would hardly be sufficient to guide him
among the woods and crags with which he
was surrounded, to an object, perhaps, entirely
concealed within them, and with which he
was wholly unacquainted.—He fat down,
however, till she should afford him more be∣nefit,
and to consider what he should do—when,
amidst the silence of the night, the
sound of a human voice, in slow cadence, ac∣companied
by some musical instrument, was
borne on the faint breeze that arose from
the low-lands.—He listened—it was not
the iilusion of fancy, as he had for a mo∣ment
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
supposed; and he involuntarily ex∣claimed—
<Q><L>O, it came o'er mine ear, like the sweet south,</L>
<L>That breathes upon a bank of violets—</L>
<L>Stealing and giving odour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shakespeare.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
His dog, too, gave evident signs of hearing
something unusual—ran from his master to
the brink of the precipice—then returned
jumping towards him, and seemed rejoiced
that they were once more within reach of a
human habitation.—His sagacity assisted his
master to follow the sound; and descending
the, mountain, by an entangled and almost
overgrown sheep-path, that led from one
pointed rock to another, he at length entered
one of those woods of larch, pine, and ches∣nut,
that fill many of the hollow bosoms of
the Pyrenees; and though the trees rendered
it entirely dark, the music, which still con∣tinued
at short intervals to float in the air,
led him on, till, in a small glade, overshadow∣ed
by rocks clothed with brush-wood, he saw
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
a small cabin, or rather cottage, where he
had no doubt of finding an asylum for the
night: his terrier now run gaily before him,
and was presently saluted by the loud barking
of those dogs which guard the Pyrenean flocks—but
on meeting, the animals courteously sa∣luted
each other, and the shepherds dog seem∣ed
glad to shew the strangers to his master.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. Continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE moon, though not yet risen above
the trees, which on every side shaded the
rocks surrounding this solitary glen, yet af∣forded
general light enough for Willoughby
to perceive a groupe of peasants assembled
round the door of a cottage, superior in size
to any of the cabins of the shepherds which
he had yet visited.—As he approached, the
founds which had guided him towards it
ceased; and a man advanced to meet him,
whose air and manner were very different
from the native, mountaineers whom he had
been accustomed to see, though his dress was
nearly the same. Willoughby accosted him
in French, told him he was a stranger who
had lost his guide, and desired to be permitted
to remain in his cottage till the morning
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
enabled him to find his companions.—The
man to whom he spoke hardly allowed him
to finish the sentence, before, in language un∣adulterated
with the Patois which is spoken in
that country, and is a coarse mixture of Spa∣nish
and French, he expressed the utmost so∣licitude
for his accommodation—and leading
him to the door of the cottage, presented
him to his wife, to an old man her father,
and to several young people whom his music
had assembled round the cabin—and who
were inhabitants of a little group of cottages
dispersed at short intervals among the woods
on this part of the Vallée de Louson.</P>
<P>Every individual of this simple party was
eager to shew civility and attention to the
stranger.—"Louison," said he, who appeared
to be the master of the house, and who had
met Willoughby—"Louison, go and pre∣pare
what our cottage affords, to refresh this
gentleman, who may well have occasion for
it, after such fatigue as he has gone through."
Willoughby owned he was almost exhausted—and
in a moment, milk, bread, and such other
simple food as they themselves lived upon,
were before him.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="207"/>
With the same hospitable simplicity, Loui∣son
went again, at her husband's request, to
prepare him a bed, which one of the younger
brothers of his host relinquished to him; say∣ing,
he could find a lodging that night at a
neighbouring cottage.—Le Laurier, which he
found was the name of his host, then pressed
him to retire to his bed—but Willoughby,
refreshed by what he had eaten, found his
curiosity so strongly excited, by the manners
and language of this man, that it became more
powerful than fatigue—and he could not help
expressing a wish, to know how a man, who
possessed such musical talents, and whose con∣versation
was certainly not that of a moun∣taineer,
should be found inhabiting a feques∣tered
nook, in the bosom of the Pyrenees.</P>
<P>"I inhabit it, Sir," replied Le Laurier,
"because I was born in it; but it is true,
that I have also seen a great deal of other
parts of the world—and that it is not yet a
a month since I quitted the capital of France,
to return hither, after a very long absence."—"Long,
indeed," said his wife, who had now
rejoined them—"Alas! so long"—and she
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
sighed deeply—"that I never expected, Sir,
to have seen him again."</P>
<P>Let me hear", said Willoughby, "not
only what you have to relate of yourself,
but what is now passing at Paris, which you
say you have so lately left—I have been
so long, wandering among these mountains,
that I am wholly ignorant of the consequencs
of that fermentation which was evident there
among all ranks of men when I passed through
it?"</P>
<P>"And I was in the midst of it all, Sir,"
replied Le Laurier—"for my master, Cheva∣lier
de Bellegarde, was among the prisoners
who were released from the castle of Mount
St. Michell—but our history is too long for
this evening:"—he gave, however, a brief
detail to. Willoughby, of what had passed at
Paris the preceding July—and then, gaily
turning the conversation, said—"Well, Sir,
but here am I, after all this, returned to my
cottage in the Pyrenees, and here is Louison
and my family—we are all happy together—and
what is yet better, my dear master is re∣stored
to his home here below us."—"And
where is his home?" "Oh, Sir, the Chateau
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
of Rochemarte, where his family have lived
since the beginning of the world, I believe,
is just down in the valley—have you never
seen it?—to-morrow, please Heaven, you
shall—and you shall see my master—who is
now indeed the Count of Bellegarde—for his
father and brother are dead—you shall see him,
Sir; and see how a man enjoys liberty that
has been a prisoner so many years,—Not, in∣deed,
that he is so happy as some people would
be, because of the misfortunes in the beginning
of his life—which always hang upon his
mind—but now, I hope, in time, he will get
over them.—For my part, I think it folly to
lament what we cannot help, or regret what
cannot be recalled—and I wish the Cheva∣lier
was of my disposition."</P>
<P>"'Tis a very fortunate one, at least for
yourself," replied Willoughby—"and has
undoubtedly helped you gaily through the
world." "No, Sir, not gaily—but tole∣rably;
amidst the severest of those misfor∣tunes,
which I shared with the Chevalier, I
had always a persuasion that I should revisit
my cottage, and my Louison."—"Ah, thank
Heaven, your persuasion was a just one, my
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
friend," replied his wife—and now that we
may not part with melancholy impressions
on our minds, let us have a little more
music."</P>
<P>Le Laurier then began to play on the in∣strument
Willoughby had before heard, and
which was something between a lute and a
Spanish guitar—he touched it with uncom∣mon
taste, and sang a simple rustic air; the
cadence was solemn and pathetic, and at every
close, the female part of his auditory joined
their voices in unison.—Willoughby had now
time to observe the groupe before him by the
clear light of the moon, which cast a mild
and unclouded radience around them—The
scene was simple and affecting—Le Laurier,
a fine manly figure, sat on a feat of turf by
the side, of his door—His wife, a very hand∣some
woman, stood leaning against the side of
it, her head inclined towards him; a girl,
twelve or thirteen years old, who was his
eldest daughter, leaned on the turf, and looked
up towards him, with a fort of innocent and
affectionate admiration; while a boy of seven,
the youngest of his children, had fallen asleep
as he sat at her feet, and rested his head on
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
her lap;—two or three young peasants were
behind, listening to the music, and gazing at
the stranger; and, in a chair, before the door,
the venerable father of the family, sat, con∣templating
the felicity so lately restored to
them all, by the return of Le Laurier—with
the mild resignation of reposing age.</P>
<P>A thousand fragrant smells floated in the
air, after the rain; and the lightest wind
whispered among the woods by which they
were every way surrounded.—Not a sound
interrupted the plaintive pastoral air, which
the performer now began to play, while
his wife and daughter alternately sung a
stanza.—It was a kind of romance in Pa∣tois—but
Willoughby understood it to
be the complaint of a mountain shepherd,
whose mistress had forsaken him for a richer
establishment.—There was nothing new in it,
but it was the language of nature, and brought
forcibly to the mind of Willoughby his own
misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212"/>
The soothing melancholy which every ob∣ject
around him seemed to breathe; the light
of the moon trembling among the waving
branches, of which Celestina had so often re∣marked
the effect when they were wandering
together; the simple cadence of rustic music,
even the happiness which he saw on the coun∣tenances
of his host and his family, combined
to raise in his mind regret and languor.—Never
could he now hope to enjoy such a
scene with Celestina; never was he likely to
taste the delight of being restored to all he
loved—Oh, no!—Celestina was the wife of
another—and the world had no happiness for
him.—As he indulged these melancholy
thoughts, he sat almost motionless, and ap∣peared
to be attending to the music of Le
Laurier—but on a sudden they quite over∣came
him, and striking his hands together,
he started up, and walked suddenly away
from the little assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213"/>
His host immediately ceased to play, and
following him, enquired with unaffected soli∣citude,
if he was ill.—Willoughby immedi∣ately
recovering himself, thanked him for his
kindness; and assured him, that his emotion
was occasioned merely by the song he had
heard, which had brought some unpleasing
recollections to his mind.—The man, instead
of attempting to console him by common∣place
speeches, said, he would then leave him
a moment; and hoped he would soon rejoin
them, and allow them to wish him a good∣night.—Willoughby
walked on a little far∣ther
towards the wood—he looked up to the
moon—"Even at this moment," said he,
"perhaps the eyes of Celestina are fixed on
thee, mild and beautiful planet.—Those fine
and expressive eyes, which I have seen fill
with tears of admiration and delight, as they
have contemplated the beauty of the universe,
and the wisdom of its Creator—Ah, Celestina!—our
hearts were made for each other—but
yours—yours is perhaps changed, and to me
is lost as well as your person."—he dared not
trust himself with this train of thought; but
turning, walked slowly back towards the
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
cottage door, where only Le Laurier, and his
Louison, now waited to shew him to his bed.
As he walked silently along, the bells of a
convent below seemed to be calling its inha∣bitants
to their evening prayers; and from
an higher part of the mountain, which arose
very suddenly beyond the woods, a small bell
answered, and was re-echoed among the rocks.—On
his reaching Le Laurier, he enquired
what these sounds meant—"The bells, be∣low,"
said he," "are those of the convent
of St. Benoit, about half a mile below us;
and the smaller one is that of Father Antho∣ny,
a hermit, who inhabits one of the rocks
above—he has lived there many years.</P>
<P>"And where is the castle of Rochemarte?"
enquired Willoughby.</P>
<P>"It is almost close to the convent," re∣plied
Le Laurier—"and if you wish to see
them both I will wait upon you thither to∣morrow."</P>
<P>Willoughby now repeated his acknowledg∣ments
for the courtesy he had received; and
retired to his rustic bed—where fatigue, in
despite of the depression of spirits, which his
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
last reverie had brought upon him, gave him
up to repose; and he, for a while, enjoyed
that
<Q>Sweet forgetfulness of human care,</Q>
without which the wretched would lose the
power of enduring their wretchedness; and
the happy, that of enjoying their good for∣tune.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>BY the break of day, the following morn∣ing,
Willoughby had left his rustic couch,
and joining his host and his family, partook
of their simple meal.—He felt some concern,
on reflecting on the panic poor Farnham must
have been in, when the guide returned with∣out
him to the place of rendezvous, the preced∣ing
evening.—He expressed his uneasiness on
this head to Le Laurier, who said, he knew
the place described, perfectly; and would im∣mediately
send thither the son of a neigh∣bouring
shepherd, who was then employed
about his cottage, and bring his servant and
the guide to him: in the mean time, he pro∣pose
to shew Willoughby the chateau of his
master; a proposal which his guest readily
accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="217"/>
Louison, however, on their being about to
depart, had, in her very expressive face, a
look of concern; and in her manner, an ap∣pearance
of inquietude, for which Willoughby
wished to account.—He was not long left in
suspence: she took her husband's hand, and
said, "My friend, you will not leave me
long."—"No, simpleton," replied he—and
then turning to Willoughby, he gaily ex∣claimed—"Here
is a woman, who is afraid of
trusting her husband to go half a mile!"</P>
<P>"Ah, Monsieur,"—said Louison—"you
would not blame me, if you knew how he
once left me—he went away only for a few
days, and he staid near three years."</P>
<P>"But not voluntarily, indeed," answer∣ed
Le Laurier—"I met my master, my
dear master, who had been so kind to me—in
prison—in distress—in a state of mind bor∣dering
on insanity—and I could not leave
him."</P>
<P>"I do not blame you for that, my friend,"
said Louison; "but I own I am afraid of its
happening again."</P>
<P>"How happen again?—the Chevalier—
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
or rather the Count, my master, is not now
as he was then?"</P>
<P>"Ah, no!—But you have owned yourself,
that he is restless and unhappy; and though
he appears at times delighted with being re∣stored
to his liberty, his estate, and his daugh∣ter,
yet, that at times his mind is unsettled, and
his schemes wild and uncertain—and if he
should take it into his head to travel again!"</P>
<P>"You fear that I may be tempted to travel
with him."</P>
<P>"Yes," said his wife—"indeed I do."—Le
Laurier then tried to laugh away her appre∣hensions,
and they left her; while Willoughby
felt his dialogue give new force to the curio∣sity
he had to see the Count de Bellegarde.</P>
<P>As their way was down through the woody
side of the mountain, they soon reached the
domain of the chateau; in which, the first
object that struck Willoughby, in a spot which
had once been cleared of trees, but where the
underwood, and a smaller growth of wood
again, almost concealed it, was a pavilion, which
had once been magnificent, but was now in
ruins.—It was built of various-coloured mar∣bles,
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
found in the Pyrenees; was of Grecian
architecture, and seemed to have been a work
of taste. The pillars of the portico, though
broken, yet supported its roof; and behind
it were three apartments, that had once been
richly furnished: one, as a banqueting room;
the other two as rooms, for the <HI>Siesta</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Siesta</HI>—reposing for an hour or two after dinner, during the extreme heat; as was usual in Spain, Por∣tugal, Italy, and the West Indies.</NOTE>, which
is usually taken here as in Spain.—The cano∣pies
of yellow damask, were fallen, and the
hangings of the rooms devoured by the moths,
and decayed by the damps from the windows;
which, having never been glazed, the shutters
had long since dropped down.—There was
something particularly melancholy to the
mind of Willoughby in contemplating this
building, once the seat of gaiety, splendour,
and luxurious repose, thus deserted—and he
enquired of Le Laurier, if the present Count
never intended to repair it.—"Sir," replied
he, "My Lord, the Count, has hardly had
time to think about that yet; for he has been
so little a while at his castle, that every thing
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
there remains as it was—ruinous enough.—But,
as for this pavilion, I question if ever it
will be put in order, though my lord has
such an odd sort of a liking to it, that the mo∣ment
almost he got home, he came down to
look at it.—It was quite late in the evening;
but it was not dark—and he looked in at the
window, for that night I could not open the
door—the key was lost—and the locks were
all rusty—and by what he said, I am sure there
is some story belongs to this place.—The peo∣ple
of the castle, indeed, always had a notion
of its being haunted ever since the death of my
lord's sister, whose heart, they say, was broke by
her father's ill usage.—Certain it is, that the
old Count caused this place to be shut up,
and took away the fine glasses and pictures
that were in it once—but what you fee now
he left to fall to pieces.—There used to be
large trees all around it; and all manner of
flowers; and the stream, that now almost stag∣nates
among those reeds and rushes, and with
difficulty finds its way to the moat of the
castle, was then brought into a bath, behind
the banqueting-house, and. into a bason,
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
which is now grown over with weeds and
grass, so that it can hardly be traced.</P>
<P>Willoughby left this desolate spot with a
sigh, and as his companion led him through
the obscure paths of the woods that surround∣ed
it, he enquired whether the castle itself had
equally suffered from time.—"Oh, yes, Sir,'
replied Le Laurier, "from time; and from
war, too.—It was formerly a place of great
strength, and of great importance, as a pass
into France, from the Spanish side of the
the Pyrenees; and held out a long siege
when the famous Count of Bellegarde, my
lord's ancestor, defended it for Henry the
Fourth, <HI>our</HI> king; against the army of the
League."—"Perhaps," said Willoughby,
"your Lord may not like the intrusion of a
stranger into his retirement?"—"Oh," re∣plied
his conductor, "we may not happen
to meet him; or, if we should, it will be a
sufficient introduction and recommendation,
for you, Sir, that you are an Englishman, for
he loves the English."</P>
<P>Encouraged by this assurance, Willoughby
proceeded, and in a few moments, the woods
ascending a little, as they reached the extreme
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
base of the mountain, opened into what could
only be called a plain, when opposed to the
surrounding hills, for the ground was rugged
and uneven, scattered with masses of ruined
buildings, that had formerly been part of the
outward fortifications; but of which some
were fallen into the fosse, and others over∣grown
with alder, ash, and arbeal. The gate
of the castle, and all beyond the moat, how∣ever,
was yet entire, as were the walls within its
circumference, bearing every where the marks
of great antiquity, but of such ponderous
strength, as time alone had not been able to
destroy.—Where breaches had been made by
cannon, the walls had been repaired; but
this work being of less durability than the
original structure, had gone to decay; and
the depredations of war were still very visible.
The whole was composed of grey stone; the
towers, at each end, rose in frowning, gran∣deur,
above the rest of the building; and
having only loops, and no windows, impress∣ed
ideas of darkness and imprisonment, while
the moss and wall-flowers filled the interstices
of the broken stones; and an infinite number
of birds, made their nests among the shat∣tered
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
cornices, and half-fallen battlements,
filling the air with their shrill cries.</P>
<P>Over the moat, which was broad and deep,
but now only half-full of water, which was
almost hidden by aquatic plants, sheltering
several sorts of water-fowls, that now lived
there unmolested; a draw-bridge, with mas∣sive
chains, led to the gate of the first court,
under an high arched gate-way, defended
by a double port-cullis: this court was where
the castle guard were, used to parade—It was
spacious, and the buildings that surrounded
it were gloomily magnificent; but now, no
warlike footsteps wore away the grass which
grew over the pavement; no martial music
echoed among the arches and colonades—one
solitary figure alone, appeared slowly walking
with his arms crossed, on the terrace that led
to the second court.—"There is my Lord, the
Count," said Le Laurier—"Speak to him,
then," replied Willoughby, "and apologize
for my intrusion." Le Laurier advanced,
with his hat in his hand, and at the same mo∣ment,
the Count, who then first perceived him
and Willoughby, came towards them.—His
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
military air, and dignified figure, were tem∣pered
by the mild and courteous manner with
which he moved forward to receive the
stranger whom Le Laurier announced to him.
He was greatly above the common height,
thin, and a little bent, as if from depression
of spirit—but his face pale, sallow, and ema∣ciated,
as it was, was marked with such pe∣culiar
expression, that all the adventures of
his life seemed to have been written there.—When
he spoke, his dark eyes were full of
fire and vivacity, yet at times they were wild;
and at others, heavy and glazed—his brows
were a little contracted, and hollowness about
his temples and cheeks, and the strong mus∣cular
lines of his whole face, seemed to bear
the harsh impressions of the hand of adversity,
rather than of time: for though his hair was
grey, and he looked much older than he really
was, Willoughby did hot think him above
four or five-and-forty: at his breast was the
cross of the order of St. Esprit; and his dress,
that of a captain of cavalry, was not modern,
and apparently neglected—his whole appear∣ance
instantly announced him to be a man of high rank.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225"/>
If Willoughby was pleased with his man∣ner
and address, he seemed equally, or even
more gratified by the curiosity expressed by
an Englishman, to visit him. "You see me
here, Sir," said he, "released only a few
weeks ago from a long imprisonment, won∣dering
at my freedom, and a stranger in my
own house. To those only, who have been
the victims of despotism, it would be easy to
comprehend my sensations on such a sudden
emancipation; and the triumph with which
I reflect that I owe it to the same noble efforts
which have given liberty to France—to my
country."</P>
<P>"Ah!" continued he, pausing—and losing
at once all the vivacity with which he had, a
moment before, spoken—"ah! what sensa∣tions
of concern are mingled with this exulta∣tion—I
regain my freedom—but where shall
I regain my happiness?"</P>
<P>He now fell into a deep musing, which
lasted only a moment—while Willoughby
walked by his side, on the terrace—then sud∣denly
awaking from it, he cried—"But it is
too soon to trouble you with this sort of con∣versation—we
shall have time enough—for I
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
flatter myself, Sir, with a hope of your stay∣ing
with me, as long as you remain in this
country—you must have no other home.—If
you knew the pleasure I have in conversing
with the English!"—he paused again, as if
forgetting what he meant to say—and then
added—"I will introduce you to my daugh∣ter—to
my little Anzoletta—for I have saved
her—that one little gem is restored to me in
all its lustre, amid the wreck of every thing
else that was dear to me—we will find her
now." He then entered through another
arched way, the second court of the castle,
and Willoughby accompanied him in silence,
while Le Laurier, with his hat in his hand,
followed, as the Count bade him.</P>
<P>They entered an immense hall; barbarously
magnificent; it was roofed with beams of oak,
and the sides covered with standards, and tro∣phies
of armour, the perishable parts of which
were dropping to pieces.—The narrow Go∣thic
windows were filled, not with glass, that
admitted the light, but with glass, painted
with the atchievements of the family; mingled
with the heads of saints and martyrs, whose
names were now, no where to be found, but
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
in the archives of the neighbouring convent.
But, in contemplating the innumerable coats
of arms that were blazoned on the windows,
and on the banner that hung in faded majes∣ty,
between them, Willoughby could not
help recollecting what food they would afford
for the favourite speculations of his uncle—and
his thoughts dwelt a moment on the
scene that might have passed in consequence
of his absence, in the family of Castle∣north.</P>
<P>These reflections, however, he had neither
inclination nor time to indulge—for the Count
ascending a broad, but steep stair-case of stone,
that led out of the hall, and wound within
one of the turrets, entered a gallery, and at
the end of it was his daughter's apartment,
the door of which was open, and Willoughby
was immediately introduced to a young per∣son,
who sat before a frame, working on a
piece of embroidery: a woman between fifty
and sixty, who seemed to be a kind of go∣verness,
was with her.</P>
<P>Willoughby was pleased by the graceful
simplicity of her figure, and the beauty of
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
her face—but when she spoke, in answer to
the compliment he made her, this pleasure
was converted into amazement—he fancied
he heard the voice of Celestina!</P>
<P>So strikingly did its tones resemble those to
which his heart had been always tremblingly
responsive, that had he not seen who spoke,
he should not have doubted of its being Ce∣lestina
herself.—He started—and felt the
blood rush into his cheeks—nor could he im∣mediately
recollect himself enough to reply to
what Anzoletta said; and again call forth
those sounds, to which, the second time she
spoke, he listened with increased astonishment
and more painful delight; for, not only the
similarity of her voice, to that of Celestina,
was more evident, but he saw a resemblance
to her in the air and manner of Anzoletta,
that assisted the delusion.</P>
<P>Anzoletta seemed to be about the age of
Celestina, but her figure was less: her hair
and eyes were much darker, nor had she that
dazzling and radiant complexion which made
it always difficult to believe of Celestina, that
she was a native of the South of Europe—the
features of Anzoletta were, perhaps, more
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
regular, and were not turned like Celestina—so
that the resemblance consisted in that sort
of air of family, which we sometimes observe
among relations—a kind of flying likeness,
which we now detect, and now lose.</P>
<P>The Count seemed highly gratified by the
notice Willoughby took of his daughter—to
whom he now spoke, and bade her prepare
herself for dinner, for that his guest was to
remain with them—He then led Willoughby
back to the room where he usually sat him∣self;
and as they went, he said—"Is not my
Anzoletta charming?"—"She is indeed," re∣plied
Willoughby.—"Perhaps," added the
Count, "perhaps you would not believe that
she is the child of the daughter of a man of
inferior rank, one of my father's vassals."—"Is
she not <HI>your</HI> daughter, my Lord?" en∣quired
Willoughby.—"Yes," replied the
Count, "she is my legitimate daughter; and
as such, I glory to acknowledge her—but
her mother was <HI>rolurier</HI>—and, to my marrying
her, she owed all her misfortunes; and I,
many of mine.—But if ever you think it
worth while to hear the incidents of a life,
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
that has, I think, been marked with some
singular occurrences, I shall have a melan∣choly
pleasure in relating them.</P>
<P>"Nothing would oblige me so much,"
said Willoughby, whose curiosity had been
every instant increasing—especially since he
had seen Anzoletta.—"May I, till I can be
so gratified, enquire where is the mother of
your lovely daughter?" "Yes," replied the
Count; "and you will hear a fresh instance
of the barbarous policy which despotism en∣courages
and protects. Her mother! she was
compelled by my father, the last Count of
Bellegarde, to enter into a convent of Carme∣lites,
at Bayonne, and there to take the vows.
She was my wife, by the laws of God and
man—but I was absent with my regiment—I
was unable to protect her—and the power of
the governor of the province, and of an en∣raged
and tyrannic father, were united to tear
her from me.—Would to heaven, we had been
theonly victims—but there was yet another!—another,
who is gone whence there is no re∣turn."—Here
he sell into one of those fits
of silent musing, to which Willoughby had
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
even during their short acquaintance, observ∣ed
him to be subject.—It lasted, however,
only a moment, and then recovering from it,
he clasped his hands eagerly together, and
cried, with energy—"But, for my wife—my
Jaquelina—Thanks to the generous, the glo∣rious
spirit of my country—I shall retrieve
her—she yet lives—I have seen her through
the iron bars of her cloister—I have spoke to
her!—I have, in my bosom, a handkerchief
which she gave me, bathed in her tears!—She
told me where to find our child—our
little Anzoletta—and I go to Paris to demand
and obtain her liberty: to claim her as my wife,
and to be enabled to bring her hither, to a
husband, who, changed as she is, by consine∣ment,
and affliction, still adores her—to a
daughter, whose early excellence promises to
reward us both for many, many years of se∣paration
and sorrow."</P>
<P>The eyes of the Count were filled with
tears, as he ceased speaking; and Willoughby,—whose
heart was as tender as it was manly,
was deeply affected.—"Heaven grant you all
your wishes, Sir!" cried he—"and that
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
your private happiness may be one of the in∣numerable
blessings attending on public feli∣city."—The
Count wrung his hands—and
cried, with yet increased vivacity, "It will—it
will, my friend!"—There, was in his man∣ner
a something bordering on wildness, as
he continued this discourse, which Willough∣by
remarked with some concern—he was not,
therefore, sorry, when it was interrupted by
the entrance of Le Laurier, who told him,
that the messenger he had dispatched, had
found his servant and the guide; and, reliev∣ing
them from their fears, for his safety,
which had been cruelly severe upon poor
Farnham, had brought them both to the
castle, whither his wife had directed them.</P>
<P>Willoughby had been under a good deal
of concern for Farnham, who, he knew, must
have been dreadfully alarmed for the safety
of his master; his arrival, therefore, was
particularly welcome, and he was glad to
change his clothes; for which purpose, he
now begged leave to retire—The Count or∣dered
Le Laurier to shew them to an apart∣ment,
and to take care he had every accom∣modation
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
he desired.—Willoughby, as he
marched gravely along, through the long gal∣leries,
and across the gloomy hall, fancied him∣self
a knight of romance; and, that some of
the stories of enchanted castles, and wandering
adventurers, of which he had been so fond,
in his early youth, were here realized.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a repast, rather hospitable than
splendid, during which the looks of paternal
admiration, and tenderness with which the
Count observed every action of Anzoletta,
and her innocent and agreeable vivacity, ren∣dered
them both more attractive to Willough∣by:
Monsieur de Bellegarde, finding that
Willoughby rather wished to listen to the
history he had promised, than to take any
repose, during the heat of the day, proposed
retiring to the north gallery, and there begin∣ning
this interesting account. Willoughby
most readily agreed to the plan—and the
Count, dismissing his daughter and her go∣verness,
led him hither.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235"/>
This room extended far on the north side
of the building—and looked over the moat to
a wood of fir and cypress, fringing the abrupt
ascent of the mountain, which rose almost
perpendicularly from the. plain. As this ac∣clivity
commanded the castle, two strong re∣doubts
were built on it, where, in hostile
times, parties were stationed to keep the ene∣my
from possessing posts, whence the castle
might be annoyed. In the port-holes of these
fortresses, now fast approaching to decay,
the cannon yet remained, though rusty and
useless—and the strong but tresses, and circular
towers, mantled with ivy, were seen to aspire
above the dark trees, on every side encom∣passing
them—while, a little to the west, from
a fractured rock, of yellow granite, which
started out amid the trees, a, boiling and ra∣pid
stream rushed with violence, and pouring
down among the trees, was seen only at in∣tervals,
as they either crowded over it, or, re∣ceding,
left its foaming current to flash in the
says of the sun.</P>
<P>It was altogether one of the most sublimely
beautiful landscapes Willoughby had ever
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
seen; and he contemplated the scenery with
pensive pleasure, while the master of it thus
addressed him:</P>
<P>Perhaps you are so well read in the history
of France, as to make it unnecessary for me
to remark—that my family is ancient and il∣lustrious.—My
father, the Count of Belle∣garde,
was educated with every prejudice that
could make him tenacious of his rank, and
anxious to support it.—He was married early
by my grandfather to the heiress of the house
of Ermenonville; and his eldest son, the
only issue of that marriage, inherited from his
mother the great property of that family.</P>
<P>But ambition, which my father possessed
a great share, both from his temper and his
education, saved him not entirely from the in∣fluence
of soster passions.—During the life of
his first wife, an indigent relation of his own,
was received into the family of one of his
sisters, as a dependant—she was beautiful and
interesting, and my father being released, by
death, from an engagement, in which his
heart had never any share, married her—and
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
thought himself overpaid, by the felicity of
his second marriage, for the little satisfaction
he had found in the first.</P>
<P>But though he had in one instance, suffered
his inclinations to conquer that aspiring tem∣per,
which, under less-powerful influence,
would have led him to seek for a second great
heiress, he seemed determined to apply him∣self
with more assiduity to the attainment of
power and honour, by other means—He had
some capacity for business; was daring in
forming schemes, and obstinate in adhering to
them—proud, vindictive, and violent; with
such a portion of national pride, as made him
hold every other nation but his own in the
utmost contempt—and, whenever they seemed
likely to dispute the superiority of France, he
was tempted to wish, like Caligula, that the
people so presumptuous, had but one neck,
than he might destroy them at a blow.</P>
<P>With this disposition, you will easily ima∣gine,
the inveteracy with which he regarded
the English.—He held a high post in the
war-department of France, in 1755, when
those hostilities commenced, in which, for a
series of years, the English had almost always
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
the advantage—events that added to national
hatred, or a kind of personal and peculiar
malignity—for of many of the operations in
which his country failed of success, the Count
of Bellegarde was the projector.</P>
<P>By a long course of defeat, however, his
master, Louis the Fifteenth, and his co-adju∣tors,
grew weary of his influence; and, in
1759, after the loss of Quebec, he was sud∣denly
dismissed in disgrace.</P>
<P>Nor was this mortification the only one he
was at that period fated to sustain.—A violent
and infectious fever at the same time deprived
him of his wife—and, wounded thus deeply,
by public and domestic misfortune, he took
the sudden resolution of quitting the world,
and retiring to this castle, with my brother,
my sister, and myself.</P>
<P>Hither, then, he came—leaving, at Paris,
his eldest son, who had been some time in
possession of his mother's fortune, and had
lived entirely independent of. his father, and
on no very friendly terms with him. To
the young, gay, and dissipated D'Ermenon∣ville
(for he took the name of his mother)
the austerity of a statesman, and conversation
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
of a politician, were alike repulsive; and he
had no feelings about him that disposed him
to submit to the authority of a parent, from
whom he had nothing to expect—for it was
well understood, that of all the Count de
Bellegarde either possessed from his ancestors,
or acquired from his political advantages,
D'Ermenonville would inherit only that share
which, by its being entailed, his father could
not deprive him.</P>
<P>The error of which the Count thought he
had been guilty, in allowing to this eldest
son early independence, and boundless ex∣pence,
made him determine to adopt, in re∣gard
to me and my brother, a conduct alto∣gether
contrary.—On his retirement from the
world, my brother, who was the eldest of the
two, and called the Baron de Rochemarte,
was near fifteen, and I was only fourteen
months younger—yet, though at that age,
we should have been either pursuing our
studies, or with the army, in which we had
both commissions, my father took us away
with him: and, with a governor whom he en∣gaged,
because he was the most rigid pedant he
could find, he fixed us both in what we then
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
thought the desolate solitude of Rochemarte—a
place which he had fixed upon for his
own residence; not only because it was so far
from the scene of his former elevation; but
because it was the only one of his capital
houses that was not entailed on D'Ermenon∣ville.!</P>
<P>The gloomy solitude in which he lived—the
power of life and death which he possessed
in his domain, and the proneness of his mind
to superstition, which was encouraged by the
Monks of the neighbouring convent, who
soon. found the advantage of having so liberal
a benefactor—at once darkened and soured a
temper, never very good. Accustomed to dic∣tate
and command, he could not now divest
himself of the habit: and his vassals, and his
sons, being the only persons over whom
he could now exert it, were the victims of
his harsh and imperious spirit—for in them
he delighted to discover, or to fancy faults,
only for the satisfaction of imposing punish∣ment.</P>
<P>It may be easily imagined, that to two lads
of our ages, and who had from temper and
constitution a keen relish for pleasures of
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
every kind, the life we led was insupportable.
The mild and soft-tempered Genevieve, our
sister, who was then not more than twelve
years old, though from her sex and disposi∣tion,
more accustomed to, and able to endure
solitude and confinement, began to feel the
weight of those chains, of which, however,
she did not complain; but endeavoured, by
her soothing sweetness, to make ours sit more
easy.—She was my father's favourite, and her
influence had, for some time, the power to
assuage the harshness of his temper—but, by
degrees, even that failed of its effect, and
his mortified pride, his lost happiness, and
his gloomy notions of religion, combined to
increase this ferocity, and irritate his asperity,
till, at length, his children, though the chil∣dren
of a woman he so fondly loved, seemed
to afford him nothing but objects of anger
and tyranny, and he was left alone to the
influence of Father Ignatius, a Jesuit, whom
he took into his house as the director of his
conscience; and whose purpose, it seemed to
be, to estrange him from his family en∣tirely.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242"/>
There is a point, beyond which, the en∣durance
of the most patient sufferer, cannot
go—Genevieve, indeed, Was not yet arrived
at this point, but the Baron and I had long
since passed it, and determined to break the
setters, which, in their present form, we did
not think even paternal authority had a right
to impose. The Baron, therefore, wrote to
D'Ermenonville, representing our situation,
and entreating his assistance to deliver us
from it.</P>
<P>The Marquis D'Ermenonville had, per∣haps,
no great affection for us; he could not
be totally indifferent to the representation of
the Baron; and felt, perhaps, some pleasure,
in being able to thwart his father, where it
seemed to be a sort of duty to act in opposi∣tion
to him. For this purpose, he immedi∣ately,
and by a way which we had pointed
out to him, sent us a considerable supply of
money, and directed us both to quit the castle
in the night, and find our way to Perpignan,
where his servant and horses should attend to
conduct us to Paris.—He urged, not only the
cruelty the Count de Bellegarde was guitly of,
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
in thus obliging us to waste the best of our days
in a desart; but the appearance it must have
to the world, that when a war was carrying
on, two young men, enlisted in their coun∣try's
service, submitted to be confined, like
monks, in a cloister.—This remark would
have been enough to have fired us with am∣bition
and military ardor; but to the incite∣ments
of honour, he added the allurements of
pleasure—and every scruple that remained
(for I had still some as to leaving my father
without his permission) gave way before their
united influence.</P>
<P>I could not, however, with equal success,
conquer the regret I felt at leaving my be∣loved
Genevieve, to whom, from our earliest
infancy, I had been particularly attached.—She
would, we were well assured, be com∣pelled
to encounter all the fury and indigna∣tion
of the Count, when our departure should
be known; and when we saw her trem∣ble
with the mere apprehension of it, we
would very fain have obviated every difficulty
that seemed. to forbid our taking her with us:
but, child as she was, she answered with firm∣ness
and resolution, of which her gentle tem∣per
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
seemed little capable; "No, my dear
brothers," said she, "it is fit you should
go—but that I should stay—no point of ho∣nour,
no military duty calls me; and I will
not desert my father—he is unhappy—and
has need of me—he must not be depriv∣ed
at once of all his children—and, if he
treats me with rigour, the consciousness of
not having deserved it, will enable me to sus∣tain
it with patience."</P>
<P>It was necessary, however, that she should
appear wholly ignorant of our flight—and
we dreaded that her resolution would give
way, when she was charged with having been
acquainted with it; insomuch, that we should
now have repented having made her a party
in our secret, could we have borne the
thoughts of leaving, abruptly and unkindly,
a sister, whom we both so fondly loved.</P>
<P>At length, the hour came for this cruel
parting.—My father, who since his residence
here, had affected all the state of a feudal ba∣ron,
and even many of the precautions of a
besieged chief, though he had no enemies to
apprehend, but the wolves and bears of the
Pyrenees; not only had the draw-bridge
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
taken up every night, but had a sort of guard
parade, at stated hours, the courts of the
castle. Our desire of liberty, however, sur∣mounted
all the difficulties by which our
escape seemed to be impeded; and, by means
of our sister, and our own resolution, we de∣scended
in safety, from one of the lower win∣dows;
crossed the moat, which was then full,
in our drawers, by swimming, and dressing
ourselves on the opposite bank, we proceeded
on foot to Perpignan; and with hearts ex∣ulting
in our success, and the joy it gave
us, allayed only by our apprehensions for
Genevieve.</P>
<P>Our tutor had taken a fancy to wine, and
we took care liberally to supply him—in con∣sequence
of which, and of the increase of
pleasure he found, from this easy indulgence
of his favourite passion, he had insensibly
abated of his former strictness; suffered us
every evening to go to the apartment of Ge∣nevieve;
and frequently took, in our absence,
such plentiful potations, that he was in bed,
and asleep, before we returned to our apart∣ments,
which were within his. Thus, we
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
were not missed till the morning; and, as we
left no traces on our way, and had not even
entrusted a servant with our secret, the pur∣suit
that was then made for us, was quite in∣effectual.
We arrived safely at Perpignan;
in spirits too elevated to be affected with the
fatigue of our long walk.—We found that
D'Ermenonville had punctually adhered to
his promise; and, on his horses, and attend∣ed
by his servants, we proceeded gaily to
Paris.</P>
<P>D'Ermenonville received us with more cor∣dial
friendship than I believed to be in his na∣ture—he
furnished us with money to equip
us for joining our respective regiments, as
became the sons of the Count of Bellegarde—and
assured us of his continued assistance, till
my father could be brought to reason—it is
not, therefore, wonderful, that his friendships
made us blind to his faults; and, that we saw
not the dissolute libertine, in the kind and
generous brother.—In fact, he had many
virtues; and it was to him we owed our sup∣port
after the peace of 1763 restored us to the
pleasures of Paris. Then, however, the Count
of Bellegarde, though he resisted every argu∣ment
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
which could be brought by the other
parts of our family, to induce him to receive,
and forgive us; yet was so far averse to our
owing any farther obligation to D'Ermenon∣ville,
whom he held in abhorrence, and no
longer acknowledged as his son, that he
agreed to make us each an handsome allow∣ance.</P>
<P>Peace being made, my brother, the Baron
de Rochemarte, went into Germany, where,
during the war, he had formed some attach∣ments;
and I was for several years in gar∣rison
with my regiment, hearing nothing of
my family but what I learned from the let∣ters
my sister contrived, by stealth, to send
me. After our elopement, she had been, for
some years, more rigorously consined—and
had suffered inconceivable harshness and cruel∣ty
from her father—but at the end of six
years, though his temper was far from being
softened by age, the death of the Jesuit, who
had been his confessor, seemed to have pro∣cured
some little alleviation to her sufferings.
A younger, and less-austere director, of the
same order, had succeeded to the government
of his conscience; and Genevieve now in∣formed
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
me that, accustomed as she had been,
almost from her infancy, to confinement, the
moderate severity of that in which she now
lived, was comparatively easy to her—that
her father admitted of her services with more
pleasure than he used to do; spoke to her with
greater kindness; sometimes allowed her to
walk out, and had promised that the daugh∣ter
of one of his vassals, for whom she had
conceived a friendship, should be allowed to
reside with her at the castle, as her compa∣nion:
she always added her vexation, that this
execution of his promise was, she knew not
why, always delayed from time to time;
though her old governess was become quite
useless as a companion—but her greatest un∣easiness
seemed to arise from our long, and
as she began to fear, endless separation.</P>
<P>This regret she repeatedly dwelt upon, with
so much pathetic tenderness, that I at length
determined to go in secret, and in disguise, to
Rochemarte, and embrace once more, this
beloved sister; for whom, long as we had
been parted, I still felt the warmest af∣fection.—I
was at Paris when I made this re∣solution,
where, a short time before, I had
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
formed an intimate acquaintance with a young
Englishman, the second son of a nobleman—he
was two or three years younger than I was;
in person, remarkably handsome; and in man∣ners,
the most engaging man I ever met with.—Our
acquaintance soon became the sincerest
friendship—and as he communicated to me
every interesting circumstance that besel him—so
my situation in regard to my father, and
my increasing desire to see my sister, were no
secrets to him.—He entered into all my soli∣citude,
and encouraged me to indulge the in∣clination
I had to visit Rochemarte in dis∣guise,
for the pleasure of seeing Genevieve.</P>
<P>A letter I at that period received from her,
determined me, to hesitate no longer.—She
intimated, that her situation was become ex∣tremely
unpleasant, from the extraordinary
behaviour of the Spanish Jesuit, who had
succeeded old Ignatius—that this man seemed
to have designs of the most improper nature,
in regard to her; and, that it was he, who
had hitherto opposed her having Jacquelina,
the young person to whom she was attached,
with her; because he foresaw, he should then
have less frequent opportunities of entertain∣ing
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
her alone: finding, however, the Count
disposed to indulge her, and being unable to
form any longer pretences to prevent it, he
had at last told her, that he would immediate∣ly
influence the Count to oblige her, if she
would consent to ask for the addition of an∣other
member to the family, and receive, as
if at her own desire, a sister of his, who must
be a superintendant over both her and her
friend, and replace the superannuated go∣verness,
who was no longer capable of her
charge.—To this, my poor Genevieve told
me she had consented, rather than not have
the company of Jacquelina, to cheer her soli∣tude—that
Jacquelina was consequently ar∣rived,
and the other expected every day—but
that, notwithstanding she now had a com∣panion,
the Jesuit continued to find but too
many opportunities to entertain her with
conversation which she could not misunder∣stand.</P>
<P>My blood boiled with indignation, while I
read this letter, and I instantly communicated
the contents of it to my friend, Ormond.—"It
is not possible," said he, "that you can
hesitate, my dear Chevalier, how to act—let us
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
set out instantly for Rochemarte—you see a
friend ready, not only to attend you, but to
lose his life in your service." We departed
the next day, followed only by two servants,
and arriving at Perpignan, began to consult
on the means of meeting Genevieve, without
the knowledge of my father, or the inhabi∣tants
of the castle—and the properest expedi∣ent
that occurred to us was, to disguise our∣selves
and our servants, as hunters, and to
watch, in that dress, till chance should throw
my sister in our way.</P>
<P>I sometimes thought of going openly to my
father, and making one effort to awaken his
paternal feelings; to obtain my own pardon, and
my sister's liberty; but after consulting with
Ormond, we agreed, that it was better to en∣deavour
to see her first; for a failure in the
success of this scheme would probably occa∣sion
her to be so closely confined, that we
might never have an opportunity of seeing her
at all.</P>
<P>Equipped, therefore, as Izard hunters, we
reached this castle—and wandered about a
whole day in its neighbourhood without any
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
success—the weather was so intensely warm, for
it was now autumn, that I believed my sister
came out only early in the morning, or late in
the evening—and that the best probability of
meeting her, was at those hours—to take up
our abode near the castle, therefore, was mate∣rial,
and I recollected the banqueting-house
in the wood, which had then, I imagined, been
long neglected, and where our residence could
not be suspected. But, on entering, I was
surprised to find it newly fitted up, and sump∣tuously
furnished with every article that could
contribute to luxury and repose—this had
been done by the Jesuit's directions, and here
he now and then made little entertainments
for some favourite fathers of the convent
and their female penitents, which Apicius
or Marc Anthony might have beheld with
envy.</P>
<P>Dread of the Count's power and severity,
effectually secured every part of his domain
from the intrusion of any of the neighbouring
peasants. The pavilion, therefore, furnished as
it was, was never locked—and, as I imagined
nobody had so good a right to it as myself, I
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
took up my abode in it without much appre∣hension
of being dislodged.—My friend oc∣cupied
the other room, and our servants
found a lodging in the deserted cabin of a
shepherd, on the other side of the castle;
from whence they were ordered to watch for
the appearance of the ladies we desired to see;
and immediately, on perceiving them, to ac∣quaint
us.</P>
<P>The whole of the second day passed as the
first had done; we wandered about the woods
that skirt the castle—but all about it appear∣ed
the desolate abode of sullen despotism.—At
night, when we had no longer any thing
to fear from the observation of those who
might belong to it, we approached its walls
more nearly, and watched the lights at the
windows, hoping that Genevieve might pass
with a candle; though even then it would
have been very difficult, if not impossible, to
have apprized her of our being so near.</P>
<P>If my friend had been eager for the expe∣dition,
he was now more earnest for its suc∣cess.—The
wild and mountainous country,
around a castle such as is described as the ha∣bitation
of enchanters, and monsters of fable,
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
was exactly suited to inflame his ardent and
romantic imagination—and when, to these
circumstances, was added our purpose, to
save a young woman from the harsh severity
of a father, and the wicked hypocrisy of a
Jesuit, he became an absolute enthusiast; and
vowed, like a true knight errant, never to
leave the spot till our adventure was success∣fully
accomplished.</P>
<P>The second night, however, we were slowly
retiring to our pavilion, and had almost
reached it, when we fancied that among the
trees, on one side of us, which were then cut
into alleys, we heard female voices talking low
and plaintively.—The evening was so pro∣foundly
still that we heard every leaf that
quivered in the scarcely-perceptible air; and
these voices we now lost, now heard more
distinctly—till at length I was sure that one
of them was the voice of Genevieve, though
it was so long since I had heard it. I would
have flown into her arms—but Ormond, for
once more considerate than I was, withheld me,
by representing to me, that if the person with
her should be the Jesuit's sister, we should be
ruined by our rashness. Instead, therefore, of
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
shewing ourselves abruptly, we glided along
on the other side of a treillage of beech, which
entirely concealed us, and, listening attentive∣ly,
heard distinctly, that it was to her friend
Jacquelina, that my sister addressed herself.</P>
<P>I knew not whether my voice or the sight
of me could alarm her least; but at length
determined to walk from the banqueting∣house,
and meet her. We both, therefore,
proceeded slowly down the walk in which she
was, leaning on the arm of Jacquelina; but
neither of them immediately perceived us—and
I had time (for though it was evening,
every object was yet distinct) to observe the
wonderful alteration that time had made in
the person of my sister.</P>
<P>I had left her, a beautiful girl, of twelve
years old; her fine hair hanging loose over
her face and neck; and her features, though
then lovely and expressive, not yet formed.—She
was now in her nineteenth year—with the
figure of a nymph, and a countenance beam∣ing
with sensibility and sweetness—with a sen∣sibility
that seemed to have no object, and
with sweetness that had something of patient
acquiescence infinitely interesting. Her com∣panion
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
was so beautiful a woman, that at
any other time, I should have been immedi∣ately
struck with her charms; but at this
moment, I had no eyes but for Genevieve—and
Ormond, whose heart had been prepared
for any impression, was so fascinated, that
forgetting my injunctions of silence, he ex∣claimed,
"Heavens! Chevalier—you never
told me that your sister was an angel!"</P>
<P>At this exclamation, though not uttered in
a loud voice, Genevieve, whose eyes were be∣fore
fixed on the ground, raised them, when
seeing two men approach, she was extremely
alarmed, and taking Jacquelina by the arm,
she cried—"Here are strangers, my friend—let
us hasten back to the castle."</P>
<P>"No," cried I—"No, Genevieve, it is
no stranger, but your brother, who comes to
defend and protect you." "My brother!
my dear brother!" said she—"what, both!
is it possible; can you be both so good?"</P>
<P>I held her in my arms, for she was unable
to support herself—while Ormond passionate∣ly
exclaimed, "Oh, would to Heaven I were
your brother! but accept me, loveliest of
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
women, as your friend; and be assured, that
I will defend so glorious a title with my
life."</P>
<P>She was soon so well recovered as to listen
to what I related to her, and her beautiful
eyes were turned towards Ormond, full of
such expressions as charmed his very soul—while
she thanked him for having accompa∣nied
her dear Chevalier. From her conver∣sation,
and from that of her amiable compa∣nion,
I learned, that my infatuated father,
was not only entirely governed by his con∣fessor,
but had lately shewn so much attach∣ment
to the sister whom he had introduced,
that there was every reason to apprehend the
consequence of the increasing influence of
both. Genevieve, however, spoke of her fa∣ther's
failings, and even of his unreasonable
harshness towards her, with reluctant sweet∣ness
that was bewitchingly interesting; and
Ormond, in this short conversation, was gone
whole ages in love.—His eyes watched every
turn of her countenance—his ears drank the
soft sounds of her plaintive voice.</P>
<P>I saw that the beauty, the simplicity of Ge∣nevieve,
aided by the singularity of her situa∣tion,
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
and the scene in which he saw her, had
effected an instance of what has often been
denied, and often ridiculed—love at first sight.
Neither Ormond, nor my sister, nor I, were
conscious of the course of time; but Jacquelina
at length reminded her, that it would be ha∣zardous
to be longer absent from the castle.
She instantly recollected herself, and said with
a sigh—"My Chevalier—we must part—when
shall we meet again?" It was agreed, that
by the earliest dawn of the following morn∣ning,
we would wait for them in the wood,
near the pavilion: we attended them as far as
we dared, towards the approach to the castle,
and then slowly and unwillingly bade them
good-night.</P>
<P>Ormond stood watching my sister as she
passed among the trees, and when he could
see her no longer, he hinted to me, and said,
with an energy peculiarly his own, "Belle∣garde,
I am in love with your sister to dis∣traction!"
"I am sorry for it, my friend,"
said I; "and why sorry?" interrupted he—with
an air of displeasure; "because," replied
I, "this attachment, if it indeed becomes
permanent, though very honourable to her,
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
may be a source of misery to you both.—My
father has so great an antipathy to an English-man
and a Protestant, that were a man, who is
both, to possess the world, I am convinced he
would refuse him his daughter."—"Refuse,"
cried Ormond: "Do you think I would ask
him? or do you, Chevalier, mean to leave
your sister—such a sister—here in his power?"—"I
hardly know what I mean yet, my dear
friend. Let us, however, do nothing rashly,
lest we injure the objects we wish to serve."—Alas!
at that time, I was cool and collected,
and could argue with the romantic enthusiasm
of my friend; but in a few days I was as
madly in love with Jacquelina, as Ormond was
with my sister.</P>
<P>The impediments between us, were as great
as those between my friend and Genevieve—Jacquelina
was of inferior birth, the daughter
of one of my father's vassals; and to the sul∣len
pride of the Count of Bellegarde nothing
could be so repugnant as such an alliance.
I was not yet of the age when sons were al∣lowed
to dispose of themselves; and my al∣lowance
from my father would, I was well
assured, be instantly withdrawn, if I offended
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
him anew—All these considerations, however,
weighed nothing against the violence of my
passion—and determined as I was to marry
Jacquelina, and to give Genevieve to my
friend, the only difficulty seemed to be to find
a Priest on whom we might depend; for, sen∣sible
of our affection as were the objects of our
love, they refused to leave their home unless
under the protection of their husbands.</P>
<P>While I was studying how to find and se∣cure
the fidelity of such a man as we had oc∣casion
for, Genevieve endured from the inso∣sence
of the Jesuit, and the encroaching au∣thority
of Mademoiselle D'Aucheterre, his
sister, insults which she dared not avow to us
in all their extent. But Jacquelina, when she
was alone with me, spake with less reserve,
and told me she had no doubt but that it was
the plan of D'Aucheterre, the Jesuit, to marry
his sister to the Count: and that so entirely
was he governed by him, that there was no
doubt of his falling into the snare. This was
very unpleasant intelligence; but I forgot it
when she added, that she dreaded every day
lest the walks Genevieve was now allowed to
take should be prohibited.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261"/>
It was necessary immediately to hazard
something. I contrived to make an acquaint∣ance
with one of the younger Monks of the
convent—he had never seen me as the Cheva∣lier
de Bellegarde, and believed, for some time,
that I was an hunter, from Pau in Berne. At
length, when I believed myself tolerably ac∣quainted
with him, I told him who I was, and
with what view I had so long lingered about
my father's abode, from whence I had been
many years exiled. From the manner of his
receiving this intelligence, I believed I could
trust him—It was very hazardous; for the
Fathers of the Convent were for the most part
decidedly in the interest of the Jesuit—But I
offered to this Monk the means of gratifying
some of those passions which his poverty and
mode of life afforded him little opportunity of
indulging—and he agreed to do whatever I
pleased.</P>
<P>The rising sun of the following morning
saw my friend Ormond the enraptured hus∣band
of the lovely Genevieve; and gave
me, in Jacquelina, the only woman who
seemed to me worthy to be her friend.—Trembling
at every breath of air, at every
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
whisper of the falling leaves, they hurried
back to the castle—where an unusual degree
of tranquillity seemed on that day to reign.—The
Count spake kindly to his daughter—and
she, encouraged by the certainty of now be∣longing
to the man she loved, put a restraint
upon herself, and behaved with more civility
to D'Auchterre and his sister than she could
generally command. In the evening they
met us as usual; but our felicity was embit∣tered
by the apprehensions for our safety that
had taken possession of Jacquelina.—"Though
there is not a peasant, or a shepherd, round
the domains of the castle," said she, "that
loves the Count well enough to do him any
kindness on his own account, yet fear may
have the influence which affection and grati∣tude
have not. Some of them have been tell∣ing
the servants that two strangers have been
seen for many days among the mountains,
who call themselves Izard hunters, though
they have no dogs with them; that nobody
knows where they sleep, or how they live;
and that they are suspected to belong to a
banditti who have for some time infested the
Vallée d'Aran, about the source of the Ga∣ronne.
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
This whisper," continued Jacquelina,
"terrifies me. It was only to-day I heard it,
and I have never had a tranquil moment since:
I figure to myself that your lodging in the
banqueting-house may be discovered; that
you may be taken up—imprisoned—punished."—I
endeavoured to appease the fears of my
angelic wife, though I felt that they were too
well founded. Ormond, intoxicated by love,
and knowing less of the manners of the people
than I did, treated them slightly—"Let them
come," said he;—"are we not armed?" The
following day, however, Genevieve and Jac∣quelina
met us in increased alarm. The re∣ports
among the servants gained ground—the
Jesuit had heard of them, and had said to
Genevieve and her friend, that if such men
were lurking about the confines of the castle,
their early and late walks would become very
unsafe, and that he must speak to the Count
to forbid them.</P>
<P>To remain another night in the pavilion
was not safe. Our little council deliberated
what to do, and Love was the president.
Under his auspices, the timid Genevieve
learned courage to propose what appeared a
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
more hazardous measure than to remain where
we were. "The eastern side of the castle," said
she, "is never inhabited on that side: the
guard-room, and the rooms above and under
it, have not been opened for many years:—in
that quarter, you, my Chevalier, may recol∣lect
there was a considerable breach made in
one of the sieges, and the windows are dis∣mantled
and broken still—as nobody ever
goes near that range of rooms, would there be
much danger in your remaining in them till
we can depart?"</P>
<P>"The danger," cried Ormond; "is no
consideration, but why should we not depart
immediately? why should you and Jacquelina
ever return to the castle?"</P>
<P>To this my sister answered, that unless pre∣cautions
were taken, such as she feared we had
not thought of, our flight would undo us—"My
father," said she, "by the death of that
nobleman, who was the most powerful among
his enemies, has obtained the government of
Roussillon, and has even had offers of other
advantages which may awaken his dormant
and disappointed ambition. Thus armed with
powers to detect our flight, consider what
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
would be the consequence of our being missing,
if we are not sure of getting out of his reach
before he can exert that power. Secure, if
possible, the means of an escape, and we will
fly: in the mean time, you must think of your
own safety till that can be done."</P>
<P>We were too much in love to raise any dif∣ficulties
to a plan which brought us nearer the
objects of our affections; and the remark
Genevieve made as to the difficulty of our
carrying her and Jacquelina with us, without
some quicker means of conveyance than their
delicate limbs afforded them, was perfectly
just. How to procure such conveyance was
a matter that required more deliberation than
the present moment afforded, and it was there∣fore
agreed that at night, when all about the
castle was quiet, Genevieve and Jacquelina
should be at one of the lowest windows on the
eastern side; and that we should cross the
moat, and by their aid ascend to that window,
which we considered as a very easy under∣taking.</P>
<P>As it was now late in the autumn, and
there was no moon, it was dark enough for
our purpose. We crossed the moat with ease,
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
and found our lovely conductresses waiting
for us; with almost equal ease ascended the
broken wall, and I was thus in my father's
house, unknown to him, and took possession
of the paternal mansion of my ancestors as if
I had been a robber and an assassin.</P>
<P>Here, however, under such circumstances,
I passed the most fortunate period of my life—Ah!
short and fleeting felicity—which never,
never can return again!</P>
<P>We were not, however, so intoxicated with
our present happiness, as to neglect the means
of its continuance; but nothing was so diffi∣cult
as to carry them into execution. It was
only of a night I could get out, for with such
a commission I was unwilling to entrust the
daring and impetuous Ormond; and the ap∣plication
I made for horses at two or three
villages at hours so unreasonable, raised
such suspicion of my intention, that I twice
narrowly escaped being seized by the peasants
as one of the banditti; and once, on my return
to the castle, was watched and compelled, in∣stead
of entering it by the window, as usual,
to plunge into the woods, and conceal myself
till the following evening: while my wife, my
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
sister, and Ormond suffered the most cruel
anxiety and were almost dead with apprehen∣sion.</P>
<P>After this unsuccessful sally, they entreated
me not to venture out again, and we continued
to live on some time longer in security. The
immense extent of the castle made our abode
in this uninhabited part of it attended with
very little rish; for the passages were all stone,
and our footsteps could not be heard, even if
we had not taken all precautions against noise.
The appearance of complaisance which Gene∣vieve
was compelled to assume towards
D'Aucheterre, obtained for her any little fa∣vour
she chose to ask of him: and he allowed
her frequently to dine in her own apartment,
while his sister was thus enabled to carry on,
with more success, her plan of operations
against the heart of the Count, in which in∣deed
she had made a much greater progress
than we apprehended. Thus we were supplied
with food without raising any suspicion, and
were so well content with our consinement,
since it was the imprisonment of love, that
could we have been sure of its continuance
with safety to the objects of that love, we
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
should never have regretted our loss of li∣berty.</P>
<P>To this moment I am ignorant of the
means by which we were discovered, though
I can impute it only to the treachery of the
Monk who married us. It was after mid∣night,
near five weeks after our residence in
the castle, that I was awaked by a loud shriek
from Jacquelina, who at the same moment
threw her arms about me.—I started up, and
flew to a cutlass which I usually placed in a
chair near the bed; and with which I defended
Jacquelina for some moments, till I was stunned
by a blow which one of the ruffians who sur∣rounded
me aimed at the back of my head,
and I recovered not my senses till many hours
afterwards, when I awoke in a kind of litter,
in which two hideous figures guarded me, with
their swords drawn. I was confined by heavy
chains; and when I enquired why I was thus
fettered like a malefactor, I was shewn a Lettre
de Cachet, which directed me to be conveyed to
the Bastile—and thither I was now travelling.
Oh, Sir, if you have ever loved! you may be
enabled to judge what were my feelings!—Yet,
who was ever so cruelly outraged—who
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
was ever torn from such a woman, unless it
was my unhappy friend, Ormond!—whose
fate I had reason to fear was yet severer than
my own—because I doubted whether my fa∣ther,
savage and inhuman as he was, could
exercise on me exactly the same degree of
cruelty, which he would feel himself disposed
to inflict on one who, in addition to his being
the husband of Genevieve, was an Englishman,
and an heretic. The anxiety I felt for his
fate, and for that of my sister, and the dread
of what might have befallen Jacquelina, whose
shrieks, as they endeavoured to tear her from
me, yet vibrated in my ears, made me insen∣sible
of my own sufferings, notwithstanding
my wounds and the inconveniences of my con∣finement.
But my guards were obstinately
silent, and neither threats nor entreaties could
procure for me the least intelligence of what
was to be the fate of the beloved friends from
whom they had divided me.</P>
<P>While any hope remained, I retained some
degree of composure and recollection: but at
length despair took possession of me—I be∣came
delirious—Furious, frantic, I was only
prevented by my chains from destroying, first
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
my keepers, and then myself.—I knew nothing
of what happened for many days, during the
disorder of my senses: when I recovered them,
I was in a room in one of the towers of the
Bastile, so much weakened with the loss of
blood that they had taken from me during my
frenzy, that I could not leave my bed. My
head had been shaved, and I was under the
regimen appointed for those who are decidedly
insane.—Pardon me, if I here ask your pa∣tience
till to-morrow—the recollection of what
I then suffered is too painful for me to dwell
upon longer; and when I think that these suf∣ferings
were inflicted by a father!—Here
the Count put his hand on his heart, and
sighed deeply. Willoughby remarked in
his eyes that unsettled expression that still
bore testimony of the state of mind into which
the sufferings he had been relating had thrown
him; and extremely affected himself by the
Count's narrative, he was glad, powerfully as
his curiosity was excited, to delay hearing the
melancholy catastrophe, for melancholy he
feared it must be, till the next day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Count de Bellegarde and Wil∣loughby
met the next morning, the former
seemed perfectly composed, but pensive and
melancholy. It was early—he proposed walk∣ing
towards the convent; "and as we go,"
said he, "I will conclude, as briefly as I can,
my mournful history. I will not dwell upon
the nature of my sufferings in the Bastile: of
much of the time I passed there I have no per∣fect
recollection; and, for the rest, suffice it
to say that, by the orders of my inflexible
father, I endured all the rigours of im∣prisonment,
in its most hideous form for
several months, during which I made some
attempts to escape—Attempts, the failure of
which only served to convince me of the im∣possibility
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
of effecting it; and, in the impo∣tency
of rage, I cursed my existence, and,
I fear, reproached Heaven itself for permitting
such horrors on earth. The idea of Jacque∣lina,
abandoned to the inhuman vengeance
of a man capable of acting with such malig∣nity
towards his own son; the thoughts of the
misery in which I had probably been the
means of involving Ormond and Genevieve,
hardly suffered me to attend to my own wretch∣eduess,
when I was capable of feeling it; but
many weeks past in wild ravings about <HI>them,</HI>
and then for myself I felt nothing.</P>
<P>"I thus lost some of those miserable days, the
cause of which, when I was sensible, I marked
on the wall of my prison. I had now, though
my reckoning was thus rendered defective,
past near two years in my prison; when my
barbarous father, at the intercession of my
brother the Baron, sent a priest to offer me
my release on certain conditions: one of
which was, that I should immediately, on leav∣ing
my confinement, be conducted to my re∣giment,
which was then in garrison at Lisle,
and give my parole that I would not quit it
without the permission of the commanding
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
officer. Though I saw that this restriction was
intended to prevent my gaining any intelli∣gence
of Jacquelina, of Ormond, or of my
sister, I gave the promised desire, as being re∣leased
from my detested prison always seemed
a step towards them; and two days afterwards
the governor of the Bastile delivered me to the
persons whom my father had sent for me; and
I was thus conducted, like a prisoner, to join
the regiment, where the colonel, a friend of
the Count's, took care to take the parole in
the strongest manner; and believing, perhaps,
that under such circumstances I should not
feel myself bound in honour to keep it, he
continued to have me watched so strictly that
I was still in fact a prisoner.</P>
<P>"And thus, at the age of twenty-nine, was I
treated; my soul revolting against the tyranny,
without the means of escaping from it, and
consuming itself in vain projects, to see or to
hear from the wife so adored—from friends
so tenderly beloved.</P>
<P>"A few days, however, after my arrival at
Lisle, my brothers, D'Ermenonville and the
Baron De Rochemarte, came in disguise to find
me. They hardly knew me, so greatly was
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
I changed by despair and confinement; but
without giving them time to express their
concern, I enquired for Jacquelina—for Or∣mond,
for our sister.</P>
<P>"Their countenances, particularly that of
the Baron, told me that I had only tidings
of sorrow to expect; and knowing the state
in which my mind had been, he studied a
moment how to soften them; but the impa∣tience
of my fear would not give him time—"Tell
me," cried I, "tell me, where is Jac∣quelina,
where is Genevieve, where is my
friend Ormond? They are dead, I know they
are; that inhuman man, who calls himself
my father, has destroyed them all."</P>
<P>"No," replied the Baron, "Ormond lives,
and is long since returned to England—Jac∣quelina
lives; but lives not for you; she has
taken the veil.—As for our unfortunate sister,
she is, perhaps, happier; she has been dead
some months."—This cruel intelligence—that
of the three beings dearest to me on earth I
should never again see either, was too much
for me.—Again I lost the sense of my misery
in delirium; and it was many days before I
could attend to the consolation offered me by
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
the Baron, or the lighter arguments by which
D'Ermenonville attempted to wean me from
reflections which it could answer, he said, no
purpose to indulge. The state I then fell into
was only another species of madness. I no
longer raved or vented my sury in cries and
execrations; but I became silent and sullen:
never spoke but to the Baron, who still at∣tended
me with paternal pity, and got leave
of the commandant to do so; and whatever I
said to him was only enquiries after some par∣ticulars
relative to Jacquelina and my sister, in
which he could not satisfy me—all that he
knew being from my father, or Madame de
Bellegarde; for the sister of the Jesuit, D'Au∣cheterre
had long since been raised to that
title, and had brought the Count to Paris,
where he was again admitted to such a share
of power as had enabled him to execute more
securely his unnatural vengeance.</P>
<P>"As I was no longer capable of duty, and
my malady seemed to be incurably fixed:—as
Jacquelina had taken the vows, and was for
ever out of my reach, the Baron obtained
leave for me to go with him to a house he
had in Normandy; where the patient pity
with which he watched over me, gradually re∣stored
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
me to my senses! but I regained them
only to feel with keener anguish all the hor∣rors
of my destiny. The Count de Bellegarde,
now far advanced in life, and repenting, per∣haps,
whenever his new wife gave him leave
to think, of his cruel treatment of his daugh∣ter,
expressed some inclination to see and to
forgive me; but I felt that it was <HI>I</HI> who had
much to forgive: and, alas! I felt, too, that
though he was my father I could not forgive
him.</P>
<P>The first moment in which I enjoyed
both reason and liberty, I should have used in
flying to Perpignan, where, with difficulty, I
learned that Jacquelina was confined; but I
had promised the Baron, that I could not yet
attempt it, and to him I held my word to be
sacred, whatever it cost me to keep it. All
my present satisfaction was in traversing the
sea coast, near which my brother's house was
situated, and looking towards England, whence
I every day expected to hear of Ormond, to
whom I had written. Impatiently I waited
month after month for an answer. I wrote
again; but still I heard nothing. At length
I recollected the name of an English gentle∣man,
with whom Ormond lived in habits of
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
intimacy while he was in France. I wrote to
him, and my letter was immediately answered.
He informed me, that Captain Ormond, who
had returned to England about ten months
before in a very bad state of health, had been
ordered very soon afterwards to America, with
his regiment, which was sent thither to quell
the troubles which about that time broke out
in the English colonies. Thus I had no
longer any hope of seeing my dear friend, who
was of a disposition to have joined me in my
attempt, however hazardous, for the recovery
of Jacquelina, which I was at all events deter∣mined
to try at.</P>
<P>"Wild and impossible as the project was, it
had taken such forcible hold of my imagina∣tion,
that reason was no longer heard. I
concealed my intentions, however, carefully
from my brother—affected composure, I was
far from feeling; and, as he began to be∣lieve
me reconciled to my destiny, he no
longer refused to talk of Jacquelina, when I
calmly led the discourse to that subject: and
by degrees he told me all he knew, which was,
indeed, little more than the name of the con∣vent,
where she had taken the veil, at Per∣pignan.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278"/>
"Having gained all the instruction I could,
I left a letter to the Baron, who had long
ceased to insist upon any parole; and telling
him that being now well enough to return to
my duty, I should merely see Jacquelina, take
an eternal adieu, and then rejoin my regiment.
I sat out alone in the night, and, taking bye∣roads,
arrived at Perpignan.</P>
<P>"I found a brother of Jacquelina's, who was
settled there: he confirmed all I had heard
of the compulsion that had been used by the
Count to force my unhappy wife to take the
veil. He had threatened the destruction of
her whole family: he had imprisoned her fa∣ther,
and assured her that I was dead. If I
shuddered at this relation, judge how my ten∣derness,
my regret, my rage was encreased
when this brother of my Jacquelina went on
to speak of what he thought I had known.
That she became a mother during this inhuman
persecution; and that an infant daughter then
existed. My sister, too, had given birth to a
daughter; and died in consequence of the
anguish of mind she suffered at having her
child taken from her. "Where are these chil∣dren?"
cried I, in an agony it is impossible to
describe;—"Oh, carry me instantly where I
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
may claim them!" "Alas, Sir!" replied my
wife's brother, "my sister's child was taken
by my mother, who, ill as she could afford it,
would never part with it to the Count, who,
offered to provide for it; because she doubted
what were his designs. She doubted, indeed,
with reason, for the other baby was sent away
to Bayonne, as was then said; but every
thing relative to it was so secretly managed,
that nobody knew for a long time what was
become of it: and it was not till some time
afterwards that my sister, who from her ten∣der
affection for Mademoiselle Bellegarde, was
as anxious for it as for her own, persuaded me
to enquire about it; for we all dreaded to
hear that the Count, under the influence of the
D'Aucheterres, had been very cruel indeed
to it!</P>
<P>"Oh! Sir, reflect a moment on my feel∣ings
at this detail. In the same breath, I
bade my informer go on with the account of
all he knew of Ormond's child, and carry me
to my own. The wildness of my impatience
frightened him; he endeavoured to soothe me
with assurances that my infant was living,
and well, and then told me as gently as
he could, that he had been guilty of a
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
breach of promise in naming it, for that
the Count had made the whole family enter
into an agreement never to let me know any
thing about the child.—Irritated by this new
instance of barbarity, I swore, in a transport of
passion, that I would have my daughter re∣stored
to me, or perish in the attempt; and
that I would find the child of my murdered
sister if I traversed the world."—"Alas! my
dear Chevalier," said my wife's brother, "there
will be danger enough for you even in at∣tempting
to see your own daughter; for the
Count has never ceased to have it watched: but
for that of your sister, you will certainly never
recover it. All my researches, which I as∣sure
you were not indolently nor feebly made,
traced it no farther than into the house of a cer∣tain
Madame de Pellatier at Bayonne, a friend
of the present Madame de Bellegarde, who
undertook"—</P>
<P>"Madame de Pellatier!" cried Willoughby,
"Oh! eternal Heaven, are you sure—Merci∣ful
God!—are you sure it was Madame de
Pellatier?"</P>
<P>Amazed at the vehemence and singular
manner of Willoughby, for which he could
so little account—the Count looked at him a
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
moment, and then said—"Am I sure? Yes,
very sure—Have you then any knowledge
of Madame de Pellatier?"—"Oh! if I could
tell you," cried Willoughby, in agitation that
deprived him of his breath—"but I cannot—'tis
impossible—yet thus much—Did you re∣cover
the daughter of your sister—was she
ever restored to you?"—</P>
<P>"No, never," answered the Count, "all the
intelligence I was long afterwards to obtain was,
that Madame de Pellatier had placed her in a
convent at Hiers; but her name was changed,
and before I could obtain, after my last re∣turn
to France, even this information, the
people who had received her were dead, and
I could only guess from some memorandums
kept in the convent, 'that a child, whom I
guessed to have been the same, was taken from
thence by an English lady."—</P>
<P>"It is Celestina," cried Willoughby, in the
wildest transport, "it is my own Celestina.
She is mine again—without a doubt, without
any impediment, mine!"—He was conscious,
that at that moment he was not in possession
of his senses, so extravagant was his joy. The
Count, accustomed as he had been to the im∣pulse
of violent passions himself, was asto∣nished
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
at this phrenzy, because he compre∣hended
not what had produced it, nor could
Willoughby, for some moments, command
himself enough to explain it; till at length,
from this paroxysm of agonizing joy he sunk
at once with as deep dejection, for the proba∣bility
had occurred to him, that, at the very
moment when he was exulting in having so
wonderfully and so unexpectedly discovered
the birth of Celestina, and thus recovered all
his losses—she was, perhaps, married—and no
longer interested for him—nor solicitous to
enquire on his account to whom she belonged.</P>
<P>Then as every hour's delay might be fatal
if this had not already happened, he deter∣mined
to set out instantly for England. The
wonder, however, with which he saw the Count
survey him recalled his wandering and bewil∣dered
senses; and as well as he could, though
very incoherently and inarticulately, he re∣lated
his history to the Count—</P>
<P>Monsieur de Bellegarde had not a doubt
but that Celestina of Willoughby was his
niece; every circumstance, as they became
cool enough to compare them, answered ex∣actly.
Convinced of this, and becoming every
instant more partial to his guest, the Count
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
now entered with the warmest interest into all
his apprehensions lest he should lose her; and
approved of his hastening instantly back to
England—Willoughby now intreated him to
return to the castle, that he might not waste a
moment—for on the event of a moment, per∣haps,
said he, my life depends. As they re∣turned,
however, the Count concluded his own
history, and Willoughby, since Celestina was
concerned in it, commanded that portion of
attention which, perhaps, no other subject,
however otherwise interesting, could at that
moment have commanded.</P>
<P>"I was not deterred," said the Count de
Bellegarde, "by any of the threats that my
father had uttered; but I flew to the convent
where Jacquelina was. It was guessed by
my impatience and ardour who I was—and I
was refused admittance to the grate. I then
had recourse to the disguise of a female dress;
and, in despite of all the menaces that had
been thrown out against their family, I pre∣vailed
on one of her sisters to accompany me."</P>
<P>"I saw her!—but she did not know me.—Her
eyes were cast down; she was pale and
thin—resignation and patience seemed to have
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
softened the horrors of her destiny—but they
gave to her faded beauty an interest so power∣ful,
that I never loved her so ardently as that
moment—I would have forced myself through
the grate, which was one of those that are so
narrow as scarcely to admit an hand.—I threw
myself against it—I spoke to her—she then
knew me, and caught hold of the bars to save
herself from falling—I kissed her hand in the
wildest trans orts—I besought her to remem∣ber,
that her vows were not—could not be bind∣ing,
either in the sight of God or man!—that she
was my wife; and that against the infamousty.
ranny that had divided us, all nature revolted."
Thus I raved, while tears, such as angels shed,
fell from her lovely eyes—"Oh! Bellegarde,"
said she, when she was able to speak, "This
is all vain and frantic rage!—learn, my dear,
dear friend, to submit, as I do, to a fate,
which, cruel as it is, is inevitable—I am
dead to you!—for from hence, no power, no
force, can now release me—ah! they told me
you were no more—or never, never would I
have taken those vows, which my heart re∣fused!—But
it is done!—and this short mo∣ment
is the last we shall ever have!"—At this
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
instant the superior of the convent, and several
nuns appeared, and severely reproaching her,
forced her from the grate—"Inhuman,"
said she,—"even this last moment is denied
me!—farewell, my dear Bellegarde—farewell
for ever—believe I am dead; and transfer
the tenderness you felt for your Jacquelina—to
her little Anzoletta—in her I still live."
This sentence was hardly articulate, amid the
efforts her persecutors made to force her away—when
I lost sight of her, again I threw my∣self
frantically against the grate that divided,
I beat my head against it—fury and despair
possessed me anew—and I became, for some
days, again insensible—or sensible to nothing
but the sight of my little girl, whose innocent
smiles appeased my rage, and made me recol∣lect
that there was yet a being in the world for
whom I ought to live.</P>
<P>"Every calm interval was employed in pro∣jects,
more wild, perhaps, than my wildest
ravings; to force Jacquelina from her ac∣cursed
imprisonment. I talked about it con∣tinually
to her brothers, and persuaded my∣self
that nothing was impossible to a man so
injured, and so attached as I was. My fa∣ther,
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
however, was too powerful in a province,
where he was governor, and in a community
into which he had influence to get Jacquelina
received, notwithstanding her resistance, and
even her marriage. At this time, power did
every thing in France, and nature and justice
were silenced—thank God it is so no longer!"</P>
<P>In this ejaculation, Willoughby most sin∣cerely
joined, and the Count proceeded:—</P>
<P>"My father, as I was about to observe, was
too well served to leave me any probability of
success in this mad project; far from being
able to procure the liberty of my wife, I could
Rot preserve my own—but was, under pre∣tence
of my insanity, carried away a prisoner
from Perpignan; and the only favor the Ba∣ron
could obtain for me was, that I might be
confined in his house in Normandy.—Here I
remained only a short time, sunk again into
the impotent fullenness of despair, when the
regiment, to which I belonged, was ordered to
America, and my father desired I might go.
I wished for death—and had I had any mo∣tives
to desire life, my honour compelled me
not to hesitate. For America then I em∣barked;
and on my arrival, my first care was
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
to enquire for the English regiment, in which
my friend Ormond had a company. I heard,
from deserters, that it had suffered greatly in
the beginning of the war, and was ordered
back to England. Even the mournful satis∣faction
which I had promised myself in em∣bracing
my friend, the husband of my beloved
unfortunate Genevieve, seemed thus to be de∣nied
me; and every circumstance contributed
to promote that desperation, that impatience
of life, which is the effect of incurable cala∣mity.</P>
<P>"Before I left France, I had recommended
my infant Anzoletta to the care of the Baron,
in case of my death, and secured to her all the
property that would be at my disposal, on the
death of my father. I thought, that were
Jacquelina dead, I should think of her with
less painful regret, than I did now; languish∣ing
within the walls of a monastery; of my
natural friends, only the Baron, and D'Erme∣nonville,
affected to feel any interest in my
fate: the former was now deeply engaged in
the duties of his profession as a soldier; and for
the latter, he was decidedly a disciple of Epi∣curus—and
made it a rule of his life to enjoy
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
every possible pleasure, and avoid every possi∣ble
pain—of course, my loss would be but
slightly felt by either of my brothers—and
my father—for so many years my persecutor
and tyrant, would rejoice at it. I continually
sought death as my only refuge against the evils
he had inflicted upon me; and what was
called bravery, was, in fact, despair.</P>
<P>"In one of the rencontres which our troops
and the revolted Americans had with the
English army, it was my chance to be stationed
to defend a small post on the borders of an
immense wood, with a small detachment of
French. The engagement was warm between
the main bodies; but the troops, under my
command, were not called into the action.
Impatient to be thus idle, I sent one of my
aid-de-camps to the general, representing,
that we were absolutely useless where we were,
and entreating his leave to advance; when he
returned and told me, that the battle was
over with disputed success; that the English
had suffered greatly, particularly in their of∣ficers;
while the Americans and French,
hardly in a better condition, were making
their retreat, which I was directed to cover
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
with my fresh troops. I advanced, therefore,
through the wood by the way I was directed;
and after proceeding half a mile, I met a party
of Indians, in the interest of the colonists, car∣rying
with them an English officer, who was,
they said, mortally wounded. By his uni∣form,
he appeared to be of rank—I approached
him, and spoke to him in French. Judge of
my sensations, when I saw in this dying pri∣soner
my friend, my Ormond!—Not even the
calls of duty were so pressing as those of friend∣ship.—I
even deliberated a moment, whether
I should not hazard every thing to attend him
myself—but when I expressed this, though he
could hardly speak, he conjured me to go on,
and merely to take him out of the hands of
the Indians.—"I know I must die," said the
gallant fellow, "but I would die in your hands—if
you can, without injury to your honour,
grant me such an indulgence." I ordered a
guard to convey him, with the utmost care,
to the nearest French quarters; and then
hastening to obey the orders I had received, I
had the happiness, successfully, to execute
them; and having done so, hurried to my
friend.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290"/>
"I found he had received every assistance
which in the situation we then were, could be
given him: he was easy, and though his
wounds were mortal, his death was not likely
to happen immediately.</P>
<P>"He thanked me, as soon as he again saw
me, for my attention to him—and then eagerly
asked me after his wife—and his child—"but
she is dead," cried he—"my Genevieve is
dead; I was but too certain of that before
I left Europe."—My silence, my tears, con∣firmed
the sad truth. "Well, my dear
Chevalier," cried he, clinging my hand, "I
am following her fast—I knew what you would
tell me of my infant—of that dear pledge
of my Genevieve's affection. Your inhuman
father has eluded your search, as he did mine.
Oh! I could curse him!—but I will not, be∣cause
he is your father. If ever your friendly
solicitude for the offspring of your sister, and
your friend, should enable you to discover
her, give her these pictures—they are those of
her father—of his favourite sister;—of her
mother—see," added he,—"this resemblance
of Genevieve which she gave me, when I re∣ceived
the dear avowal of her love; never till
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
now has it left my bosom—and I conjure
you, Bellegarde, never to part with it, till
you place it on that of my daughter.</P>
<P>"My noble friend lingered a few days longer—not
in great pain, however, and perfectly
sensible—and then, in my arms, he resigned
his gallant spirit to his God.</P>
<P>"This loss added strength to the gloomy re∣solution
I had before made to die. Among
my friend's papers, which, by his order, his
servant delivered to me, after his death, I
found a narrative of all he had done, after his
release from imprisonment in the Bastile, at
the demand of the English ambassador (for
he was there part of the time that I was,
though we never saw each other,) to gain ad∣mittance
to his wife, and to have his child
restored to him—and such an abhorrence did
this add to that I had already conceived
against my father, that I could not bear the
name of Bellegarde; nor endure to think of
returning to breathe the same air with a man
whom I considered as a monster.</P>
<P>"To France, however, I returned—without
even a wound in all the hazards to which I had
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
voluntarily exposed myself. This inhuman
father was still living—but my brother, the
Baron de Rochemarte, had fallen at the head
of his regiment, at the attack made on the
island of Jersey—and I succeeded to his for∣tune—a
fortune, which, ample as it was,
could make me no amends for the excellent
kind brother I had lost.</P>
<P>"Alas! I had lost two brothers—and two
friends equally dear to me—they were not to
be recalled—but I still found a gloomy kind
of satisfaction in complying with their last re∣quests.
That of my brother de Rochemarte
was, that I would take his name; and most
willingly I quitted that of Bellegarde—the
dying request of my beloved friend I endea∣voured—ah!
how vainly endeavoured to ful∣fil—I
never could discover his daughter till
this fortunate day!</P>
<P>"But my residence among the Americans,
had awakened in my mind a spirit of freedom.
The miseries, the irreparable injuries I had re∣ceived
from ill-placed and exorbitant power,
prompted me to assert it. I was now possessed
of considerable property—useless to me, be∣cause
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
Jacquelina could not share it—though
comparatively free myself, I was wretched.
In this disposition, it may easily be ima∣gined,
that if I possessed the power, I was not
without inclination to add fewel to that fire,
which immediately after the end of the war in
America, was kindled, though it yet burnt
but feebly in France. I wrote—I acted upon
my newly-acquired principles, with the energy
of a sufferer, and with the resolution of a mar∣tyr.
I <HI>was</HI> already the martyr of despotism,
and ruined in my happiness for ever. I knew
that all the vengeance I could excite could
injure me no farther.</P>
<P>"I now saw Jacquelina—but she was still
pining within her convent.—I saw my child—I
held her to the grate while her mother be∣dewed
her little hands with tears, which I
kissed off!—It was a scene to move every heart
but such as inhabited the breast of my father!
Again, the hopelessness of rescuing my wife
from her cruel bonds, gave him occasion to
put other fetters on me. In the rashness of
my desperation, I said, I wrote, I acted such
things as made me be considered by govern∣ment
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
as a dangerous person. My father took
advantage of my rashness—he represented me
as being disordered in my senses, and obtained
an order for shutting me up in the fortress of
Mont St. Michel.</P>
<P>"Between four and five years had I been a
captive in that gloomy prison, when the glo∣rious
flame of liberty, of which I only saw the
first feeble rays, burst forth—I regained my
personal fredom, when my country became
free—I found my father dead!—Every thing
he could give away, his wife possessed, but
this, and some other of his estates, were mine—and
D'Ermenonville gave me, with the
hands which then gave the title of Bellegarde,
the name, which I abhor; and which, though
it is yet given me by the people, who have
been accustomed to give it to the head of my
family, I will not keep—but take that of
Montignac, which is my <HI>untitled</HI> name, the
original designation of our family.</P>
<P>"The first use I made now of the general and
particular freedom, in which I rejoiced, was
to fly to Perpignan—but the moment is not
yet come, when I can deliver my imprisoned
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
Jacquelina. I am, however, assured, that she
will very soon be restored to me; in that hope
I came hither to attend to my long-neglected
affairs, and to enjoy the society of my daugh∣ter.
Even greater happiness has been the
consequence of my abode here than I dared to
hope; for by you, my friend, towards whom,
the moment I saw you, I was impelled by an
invincible propensity, I shall, I trust, recover
the dear orphan child of Genevieve and Or∣mond.</P>
<P>"In a few days I shall go back to Perpignan;
leave Anzoletta again in the care of her mo∣ther's
family, and then hasten to assist in the
glorious business of securing the liberty of
France—yes!—the immortal work of defend∣ing
myriads yet unborn from ever suffering
the oppressions, under which I have groaned."</P>
<P>Here the Count de Bellegarde ended his nar∣rative;
and Willoughby, with an inexpressi∣ble
contrariety of sensations—joy and hope—fear
and apprehension—being furnished with
every assurance he could wish, of the real pa∣rents
of Celestina, took a tender leave of the
Count and Anzoletta, whose voice was to him
as the voice of a seraph, promising him feli∣city
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
to come, and he then departed, as had
been agreed upon between him and the Count,
for Perpignan: where he delivered, at the
grate, a letter to Jacquelina—of whom the
Count had desired that she would describe to
Willoughby any particulars of the person of
his wife, which she recollected—for in her
care, the infant Celestina had been left a few
weeks.</P>
<P>With trembling impatience Willoughby
waited while the interesting, and still lovely
nun perused this letter—and heard her, while
his heart sunk with apprehension, thus de∣scribe
the child of her unfortunate friend—</P>
<P>"She was," said Jacquelina, "fairer than
my child, and her features greatly resembled
those of her father.—On her neck, a little on
the left side, were three remarkable, though
diminutive, moles."—"It is enough," said
Willoughby—"those moles are on the lovely
neck of Celestina—a thousand times have I
kissed them as we played together in our in∣fancy—and
here on this portrait of her, drawn
when she was about twelve years old, they are
described."</P>
<P>Jacquelina kissed the picture,—"Little as
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
can be judged from a likeness done so many
years afterwards, I feel an assurance," said
she, "that this is the picture of my Gene∣vieve's
child. May heaven grant her those bles∣sings
which, in its unsearchable decrees, it re∣fused
to my lovely, luckless friend." Wil∣loughby,
who would not have been a moment
détained by any interview less interesting, or
less necessary, now took his leave, and with
the utmost expedition, though all he could
make, answered but ill to his impatience, he
hastened on towards England.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE these things passed at Roche∣marte,
Celestina, no longer doubting of Wil∣loughby's
marriage, and entire desertion of
her, was trying to acquire once more that
calm resignation, which she had so often de∣termined
to adopt, and so often lost.—Mon∣tague
Thorold accompanied Lady Horatia
to Cheltenham; where, as Celestina foresaw,
his ardent entreaties, and the wishes of her
friend, so strongly enforcing them, gave her
so much pain, that she grew, hourly more
fond of the schcme she had adopted, of
travelling. If she found it difficult to evade
the importunities of her lover, and her bene∣factress,
she dreaded yet more the arrival of
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
the elder Mr. Thorold; who, about six∣weeks
after Montague's recovery, came with
him (after a short visit he had paid at home)
to Cheltenham.</P>
<P>He soon found an opportunity of speaking
to Celestina, alone, and then she became more
than ever conscious of the influence that
his solid understanding, his excellent prin∣ciples,
and his tender regard for her, gave
him over her ingenuous mind.—Though he
never complained, she well knew, that he
was not happy in the other branches of his
family, and that his hopes were particularly
fixed on his younger son, whose attachment
to Celestina, which, had it been successful,
might have secured, in one point, the felicity
of his father, had hither to produced for him
only anxiety and solicitude.</P>
<P>He had seen his life once more in immi∣nent
hazard, from the fierce and impetuous
Vavasour, and from his own rashness, which
he could not but condemn; he had seen,
for many months, all his talents, and almost
all his affections, lost and absorbed in this
one predominant passion, and he knew not
what the effect might be on his intellects,
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
and on his health, should he finally be refus∣ed:
yet, while Willoughby was uncertain as
to his own situation, or unmarried, the elder
Mr. Thorold had been withheld from making
any efforts with Celestina, on behalf of his
son: now, those impediments were removed,
he no longer thought himself restrained from
applying to her himself. So mildly and
rationally, however, he entered on this conver∣sation,
that Celestina retained more courage,
while she heard him, than she, at its com∣mencement,
had dared to expect; and when
he had recapitulated all the advantages which
might, he thought, be derived, from her
union with a man so passionately devoted to
her, of suitable age; of easy fortune—one
whose taste was congenial to her own; whose
temper was remarkably good, and who had
a heart uncorrupted by vice, and unexhaust∣ed
by a long course of intrigue; and a fa∣mily
who would consider her admission into it,
as the greatest blessing that they could receive;
Celestina acknowledged it was all very true.
"I own too, Sir," said she, "that to many
people, and perhaps to you, I may have ap∣peared
to give your son such encouragement,
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
as never ought to be given, unless it is meant
to end in marriage.—I have felt, without
having it in my power to avoid this seeming
impropriety—yet he will do me the justice
to say, I have always told him, that whatever
were my sentiments in his favour, and how∣ever
I wished to encourage those sentiments,
because I was persuaded he deserved them,
yet, that my heart never felt for him that
decided preference, without which, I cannot
believe, he could be happy, were I to give
him my hand—I was too sure, that from an
unfortunate prepossession, in favour of another,
it never could feel this preference; and that,
therefore, though I should always be happy
to be considered as his friend, I never would
be his wife. Allow me, dear Sir, to repeat
to you, a resolution from which I do not be∣lieve
I shall ever recede—you know how true
a love and veneration I have for you—there
is not on earth, a man whom I would so soon
chuse to supply to me that sacred and tender
relationship I have never known! and to call
by the endearing name of father! but I can∣not—indeed
I cannot marry. I know not
why, but some invincible persuasion hangs
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
over me, that if I do, I shall be miserable,
and render my husband miserable, whatever
may be his merit or affection—and can I,
ought I, under such a conviction, to wish it?
Be assured, that if time and reason conquer
this weakness—for perhaps it may be only
weakness—if ever I feel that I can give to
your son a heart, weaned from every other at∣tachment,
and worthy of his, I will say so—as
candidly, as I declare the impossibility of
my doing so now—and you are so liberal, that
you will forgive my weakness, and save me,
I am sure, from importunity, which is the
more distressing, as it comes from those I so
much esteem, and whose wishes it would be,
on any other subject, my pride and my pleasure
obey."</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold, after this conversation, and
some other of the same nature, was convinc∣ed,
that Celestina acted from motives of the
most delicate honour—the more he saw of her
heart and disposition, the more fondly he be∣came
attached to her; and the more ardently
desired that she might become the wife of his
son. He saw, that though her ideas were
what would be generally called romantic, they
were not cherished merely because they were
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
so; but that a high sense of the tender duty
she wished to pay to the man with whom she
was to pass her life, made it impossible for
her to enter into such engagements till she
was sure of fulfilling them according to her
own ideas—and he hoped, that her entire se∣paration
from Willoughby; his unkindness
and neglect on one hand; and on the other,
the acknowledged merit of his son, would,
though almost insensibly, yet not slowly, pro∣duce
that change which she allowed herself to
be possible, though at present it did not seem
probable. In this hope he was contented to
rest; and promising Celestina, that if she
would still allow Montague to see her fre∣quently,
he should not teize her by importu∣nity—he
threw himself entirely on her gene∣rosity
and sincerity; and after a visit of near a
week, he left Montague at Cheltenham, by the
desire of Lady Horatia, and returned home.</P>
<P>In a few days after his departure, Celestina
had another and more painful scene to en∣counter.
Cathcart arrived early one morn∣ing,
and eagerly asked to speak to her—she
went down to him immediately—but when
she saw him, she dared not ask the purpose of
<PB N="302" REF="304"/>
a visit so little expected. He was pale—he
trembled and hesitated—he looked fatigued
and dejected.—Willoughby instantly recurred
to her—for he was always the first object of
her thoughts—"Is any thing the matter, dear
Cathcart," said she "with Willoughby?"—"Oh,
no," replied he; "nothing new—I
have not heard of him since he went, which
I think strange."</P>
<P>Celestina sighed, and thought she was able
too well to account for it—"but is Jessy"
well? "Yes, thank Heaven," replied he:
"but my sister"—"what, Mrs. Elphin∣stone?"
"no my other—my unfortunate
sister Emily—I have been sent for to her at
Bristol, where, you know I went to her some
time since, at your entreaty: she has now, I
think, only a few days to live—my sister
Elphinstone is with her—poor Emily wishes
to see you—I know not how to ask such a fa∣vour
of you; but you are <HI>so</HI> good—will you—can
you oblige a family—who already owe
to you all the happiness they possess?"</P>
<P>"What will I not do to give any part of
it satisfaction," said Celestina—"but do you,
can you guess the reason of your sister's wishes
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
to see me? surely Vavasour is not there?—"He
was not, when I left her; but a few
days before, he had been at Bristol, raving
like a madman at the fatal intelligence he had
then had confirmed—that Emily could not
live. If, however, he should come, you can
have nothing to fear, for I will not leave you
a moment; and I know you so well, that I
am persuaded, there are few disagreeable cir∣cumstances,
which would not, to you, be
compensated, by the reflection of having given
comfort to the last moments of my dying
Emily."</P>
<P>This plea Celestina could not resist: she
went, therefore, by the consent of Lady Ho∣ratia,
with Cathcart, to Bristol; where a scene
awaited her, that for some time almost sus∣pended
even her thoughts of Willoughby
himself.</P>
<P>The lovely, unhappy victim, to early se∣duction,
was in the last stage of a consump∣tion—and,
unlike those who are cut off by that
distemper, was perfectly aware, and perfectly
reconciled to her fate—her earnest wishes had
been to be forgiven by Cathcart, and to die
in the arms of her sister; they both now at∣tended
<PB N="304" REF="306"/>
her with the tenderest affection, and
had even yielded to her request, to be allowed
to see Vavasour, towards whom all her anxie∣ty
was now turned, and for his happiness she
felt that concern, which she no longer was
sensible of for herself.</P>
<P>Her exhausted heart was, from gratitude
and habit attached to Vavasour; and she saw
that her death would take away the only tie
that had been some restraint on his ungovern∣able
licentiousness: that his disappointment
in regard to Celestina, had embittered his
temper; and given him a sort of excuse for
the libertinism in which he seemed resolute to
persevere; and while his good qualities, his
generosity, and his candour, as well as his
attentive tenderness towards her, had made
her affection for him the last sentiment she was
capable of feeling: she fancied it yet possible,
young as she was, Celestina might be induced
to save a man who appeared so well worth the
attempt: and that, interesting as he appeared
to her, he could not fail of having some in∣terest
with others, and particularly with one
who had learned from Willoughby an early
prejudice in his favour, which she hoped all
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
his subsequent rashness had not yet wholly
destroyed.</P>
<P>Such were the views of Emily Cathcart, in
requesting this visit; and her beautiful eyes,
lit up with the fire that was consuming her,
became yet more dazzlingly bright when her
lovely visitor was led into the room by her
brother.</P>
<P>Celestina entered trembling; and fearing
the sight of Vavasour, whom she had never
met since the terrifying night at Ranelagh;
but the moment she beheld Emily, she no
longer thought of any thing but the affecting
object before her.</P>
<P>Emily sat in a great chair, supported by
pillows—the extreme beauty that had been
so fatal to its possessor, still remained, though
its lustre was gone—Emaciated, and of a de∣licate
fairness, her hands and her face had a
transparency that gave an idea of an unembo∣died
spirit, and her dress was such as favour∣ed
the deception. The blood might almost
be seen to circulate in her veins, so plainly did
they appear; and her eyes had the dazzling ra∣diance
of ethereal fire, to which the hectic heat
of her glowing, though wafted countenance,
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
still added.—A few locks of her fine light
hair had escaped from her head-dress; and
played like broken rays from a receding planet,
round a face, which only those who had hearts
unhappily rigid, could behold, without feel∣ing
the sense of her errors suspended or over∣whelmed
by strong emotions of the tenderest
pity.</P>
<P>She held out her hand to Celestina, as she
entered, and in a voice faint and interrupted,
from the difficulty with which she breathed,
said—"Ah! dearest madam, how good this
is; how worthy that tender and sensible heart,
of which I have heard so much"—she stopped;
as if unable to speak more at that moment,
and rested her head against the chair—Celes∣tina
affected to tears, sat silently down near
her—Cathcart left the room.</P>
<P>After a short pause, she recovered strength
to say, "but a moment will be allowed
me, perhaps; let me then hasten to thank
you for this condescension, and to say,
how earnestly it is my hope, that it will not
be made in vain; but that it will afford me
an opportunity of successfully pleading—for
another penitent—for poor Vavasour."</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309"/>
"I forgive him most willingly," cried Ce∣lestina—"and
most sincerely wish him
happy."</P>
<P>"Ah, Madam!" said Emily—"You must
then carry your generosity farther—for you
only can make him so—I dared to represent
this in a letter to you—I now repeat it—vic∣tim,
as I am, even in the morning of my days,
I should, however, die in peace, for I hope
my peace is made with Heaven—if I could
see any prospect of Vavasour's being happy;
reclaimed from that wild career where he is
now wasting his time, his fortune, and his
life. I owe him so many obligations! I know
him to have so good a heart! that it is terri∣ble
to me to see him devoted as he is, and
plunging into an abyss of misery, from whence
it will soon be no longer in his power to re∣turn.—It
has been a great consolation to me,
that I have had some little influence in stem∣ming
the progress of the evil; but it is you
only who can save him from himself effectu∣ally;
and how worthy would it be of good∣ness,
of compassion like yours?"</P>
<P>Celestina knew not what to answer.—To
promise what she never, could perform, was
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
little in her nature: yet did she not love to
check the disinterested hope that thus ani∣mated
the soft heart of the fair pleader. "I
believe," said she, after a short pause, "I be∣lieve
you are mistaken: and that I have no
such power as you impute to me; be assured
that, though Mr. Vavasour's conduct has
been to me a source of the most poignant
uneasiness, I not only will forget it, but shall
rejoice in seeing him happy—for his own
sake—and for the sake of that dear friend
through whose means we first became ac∣quainted:
a friend"—her voice trembled, and
she dared not attempt to name Willoughby,
lest it should wholly fail her—"a friend who
is still, and who I dare believe will ever be
truly attached to him: and who, on his re∣turn
to England, will, I am sure, use all the
influence that friendship gives him over Mr.
Vavasour, to recal him from a way of life
you so much apprehend." She was proceed∣ing
to evade, as tenderly as she could, the pa∣thetic
prayer she had just heard, when Emily
was seized with one of those spasms which
announced her approaching death. Celestina,
terrified, called for Mrs. Elphinstone; and,
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
unable to bear a scene in which she could be
of no use, she retired to another room, where
she passed with Cathcart, two melancholy
hours, at the end of which, they heard that
the fair unhappy Emily was no more.</P>
<P>Vavasour, who was in another lodging at
the Hot-wells, no sooner heard of this sad
event, than the wildest frenzy possessed him:
nor did his having so long expected it, at all
mitigate the blow.—He ran to the house, and
regardless of Cathcart and Mrs. Elphinstone,
who would have opposed these frantic ex∣pressions
of useless regret, he threw himself on
his knees by the bedside—called to her, as
if she were still living—was sure she should
not die—and now reproached Heaven that
she was dead. From this state of temporary
insanity, nothing had the power to recal him—till
Cathcart, reproaching him very warm∣ly,
for the impropriety of his conduct, asked
him, whether it was thus he meant to pro∣mote
the last wishes of his sister, and obtain
the pardon of Miss De Mornay? That name
had still all its influence on the heart of Va∣vasour:
by a strange, though, perhaps, not
uncommon division of his affections, at once
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
vehemently loved the woman he had lost, and
the woman he hoped to gain.—Starting from
his knees, he asked where Celestina was? for
Cathcart had not yet told him of her arrival,
and had promised to prevent his distressing her.—"Miss
De Mornay is below, Sir; but you
must not go to her." "Not go to her! who
shall prevent it?" was his answer—and he
hastily went down stairs.</P>
<P>When he entered the room where Celestina
sat weeping with Mrs. Elphinstone, he had
every appearance of a man out of his senses:
but, at the sight of her, he seemed subdued in
a moment; and while she dreaded some wild
and frantic speech, he threw himself on his
knees before her, and burst into tears.</P>
<P>His convulsive sobs, as he eagerly caught
her hands, and pressed them to his heart; and
the broken voice in which he attempted to
speak, disarmed her at once of all the resent∣ment
which she had, till then, felt for his un∣warrantable
behaviour, when they last met—and
so tenderly, in a voice of such soothing
pity did she speak to him, that he soon be∣came
reasonable—thanked her for her gene∣rous
attention; even blessing her, and calling
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
her the restorer of his reason—while Celestina
availed herself of this disposition of his mind,
to prevail on him to retire; which he did, on
her promise, that she would see him again the
next day.</P>
<P>After a mournful night, of which more
was passed in comforting and consoling Mrs.
Elphinstone than in sleep, that day arrived,
on which Celestina was not only bound by
the promise which in the agitation of mind
she was in the night before, she had made to
Vavasour, to see him; but induced to declare
to him again, how totally he was mistaken
in supposing her engaged to Montague Tho∣rold.
Again he cherished the hope which
she never meant to revive; and at once to do,
what he knew would gratify her, while he
acquitted himself of the promise he had given
to his regretted Emily, he had a deed drawn
up and executed, by which he gave to Mrs.
Elphinstone, and her children, two hundred
a year; and settled them at the house he had
in Devonshire. On the moment of her de∣parture,
he gave this deed to Celestina, be∣seeching
her not to open it till her arrival at
Cheltenham. "And whither are you going,
<PB N="312" REF="314"/>
Mr. Vavasour?" said Celestina, who felt her
pity revive for him, now that she saw him so
dejected and subdued. "Ah," replied he, "I
am careless whither—I cannot, however, go
back to my Staffordshire house in the state of
mind I am in now; for I should infallibly
hang myself;—I believe I shall go to Lon∣don—for,
even at this time of year, a wretch∣ed
dog, such as I am, may find somebody or
other to help them to get rid of themselves;
and the gaming houses are always open.—"The
gaming houses!" said Celestina.—"Aye,"
replied he, "I have been there al∣ways
of late when I have been cursedly mi∣serable—and
play has a momentary effect on
me, in making me forget other things. Per∣haps,
in wandering about London, I may
meet with some unsettled, unhappy fellow,
like myself, who may like to go abroad for
six or eight months: we may go find Wil∣loughby,
perhaps, and my return may be the
more welcome to <HI>you,</HI> if I bring you an ac∣count
of <HI>him.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Alas!" thought Celestina, "what ac∣count
of <HI>him</HI> can I now hear with pleasure;
unless indeed that he is well; that I always
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
wish to hear! and I <HI>think,</HI>" added she, her
heart swelling as she said it—"I think I should
<HI>sincerely</HI> rejoice to hear, that in his new situa∣tion—he
is happy with his <HI>wife!</HI>"</P>
<P>Vavasour, again feeling the renewal of that
hope which had almost escaped him, saw Ce∣lestina
depart with more calmness than he ex∣pected.
Cathcart saw her safe in the pro∣tection
of Lady Horatia, at Cheltenham; and
then returned to Bristol, to perform the last sad
offices to his lost Emily; Vavasour, at his
and Mrs. Elphinstone's request, leaving the
place before her remains were consigned to
their early grave.</P>
<P>The scenes which, during this period, passed
in the family of Lord Castlenorth, were more
turbulent, and to some of the parties equally
melancholy.</P>
<P>The anxious peer, whose health was, as
usual, a little amended by change of country,
waited at Paris the promised arrival of Wil∣loughby,
with extreme impatience: impatience
which had such an effect upon his feeble frame,
that death, which had so long been laying in
wait for him, now seized him, and at a period,
when the blow saved him from knowing what
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
could not have been concealed from him many
hours. Lady Castlenorth having enacted with
great dignity all that a mournful relict <HI>must</HI>
do on such an occasion: and Miss Fitz-Hayman
having also performed her part ad∣mirably,
the will was opened in due form,
of which Lady Castlenorth thought herself
perfectly sure of the contents; and she had
indeed secured to herself a great deal of mo∣ney,
and a splendid income, besides her set∣tlement.
The property descending to Miss
Fitz-Hayman, immediately, was about eight
thousand a year; but, in a codicil (made in
the immediate pleasure he received when
Willoughby first declared himself resolved to
marry his cousin) he had given him an estate
of five-and-twenty hundred a year; and ten
thousand pounds in money, as a nuptial pre∣sent;
without, however, affixing any condi∣tions
to the gift.</P>
<P>The short ceremony of reading the will be∣ing
over, another was to be gone through
less easy to Miss Fitz-Hayman; which was,
announcing to her mother her actual marriage
with Captain Cavanaugh—which she thought
<PB N="315" REF="317"/>
must otherwise be revealed by somebody
else.</P>
<P>The dialogue was short, but decisive—Miss
Fitz-Hayman, or rather Mrs. Cavanaugh,
had more courage than tenderness; and hav∣ing
now nothing to fear from her mother's
influence with her father; and secure of her
fortune, both at present and in reversion, she
assumed rather an air of triumph than of con∣trition.
Lady Castlenorth would be but
faintly described by the strongest of those re∣presentations
that have been given of an en∣raged
woman, when she has been compared
to a tygress robbed of her young.—Cava∣naugh
had possessed the art to make her be∣lieve,
that his admiration of her mental per∣fections
was the foundation of that attach∣ment
he felt for her; yet, that while he ador∣ed
her beautiful mind, her fine person was an
object of tender admiration. To find that he
cared for neither the one nor the other; but
had availed himself of her credulity to obtain
a footing in the family; and money to get his
matrimonial fetters broken, that he might
marry her daughter, were convictions so ex∣tremely
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
mortifying to her pride, that they,
for a while, suspended the power of expressing
her rage—When, however, that power return∣ed,
she raved like a lunatic—gave way to the
most extravagant sallies of passion—and,
though her Lord was yet unburied, protested
that the same house should no longer hold her
and her "pelican daughter." Mrs. Cavanaugh
was more calm, and retired to her room:
where Mrs. Calder, at length, persuaded Lady
Castlenorth to let her stay till after the re∣mains
of her father were sent forward to Eng∣land,
which they were in a few days; and
then Mrs. Cavanaugh set out, by the way of
Rouen, to England also, with her husband,
who was impatient to take possession of his
great acquisitions, the price of so much pa∣tient
perfidy.—Though he would willingly
have been excused giving to Willoughby even
the small share of the ample property which
his uncle had assigned to him; yet he knew
he must see the will, and finally obtain it. He
thought it better, therefore, to continue with
him the appearance of honour; and therefore
wrote to him, informing him of Lord Castle∣north's
death; of his own marriage; and the
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
codicil in favour of Mr. Willoughby. But
not knowing whither to direct this letter; for
Willoughby had left no intimation of the
route he meant to pursue, when he quitted
Paris; he addressed it to Alvestone; where,
with one on the same business from Lady
Castlenorth, it lay, while Willoughby was
wandering among the Pyrenian mountains,
and while he pursued his impatient way to∣wards
England.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>UNCONSCIOUS of the good that awaited
him, and dreading the evil that might be irre∣parable,
Willoughby landed at Brighthelm∣stone
from Dieppe. Though it was eleven
o'clock when he got on shore, he ordered
post-horses to be instantly ready; and used
the moment he waited for them to take a slight
refreshment. On the table of the room he
was in, a newspaper lay—it was long since he
had seen an English newspaper—and he took
it up, where the first article that struck him
was an account of the funeral of Lord Castle∣north,
after his having lain in state at his
house in town.</P>
<P>Willoughby felt an immediate impression
of concern for his uncle, and feared lest dis∣appointment
should have hastened his death.
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
On himself. or any advantage he might derive
from the event, he never bestowed a thought;
but as the mind, under the influence of any
predominant passion, returns immediately to
its bias, however temporally diverted from it,
it almost instantly occurred to him, that if his
uncle had been so long dead without his
knowing it, Celestina might possibly have
been as long married. Trembling, he looked
among the marriages, but there were no
names there at all resembling those which he
dreaded to see united.—His chaise was ready,
and he departed for London; for it was there
only that he was likely to gain intelligence of
Lady Horatia Howard, and he knew of no
other clue to guide him to Celestina.</P>
<P>Celestina had left Cheltenham with her
friend, and was now at Exmouth, where Mon∣tague
Thorold was continually with them.—Whether
he was present or absent, Celestina
was equally pensive and melancholy; but it
was only in the latter case, that she attempted
to indulge those sensations in the solitary walks
which the sea-shore afforded her: for she
avoided as much as possible being quite alone
with him, because her heart every day con∣firmed
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
her in the opinion that she never could
love another man as she had loved Willough∣by,
and it was distressing to her to be fre∣quently
under the necessity of repeating, what
it inflicted such pain on her impassioned and
indefatigable lover to hear. It was now late
in September: the evenings soon shut in; and,
when there happened not to be a supply of
new books, Lady Horatia often engaged
Montague Thorold at piquet, while Celestina
sat by them at work; or, if she could be sure
he was so occupied as not to be able to fol∣low
her, she walked out alone, and as the
moon trembled on the waves, recollected the
nights when, with Willoughby and Matilda, in
the early days of their innocent friendship,
they used to mark and admire together this
beautiful appearance of the sea illuminated by
the moon.—Here, on this very spot, she had
with him beheld it—The waves had now the
same trembling brilliancy; the surrounding
objects were the same; but Willoughby was
changed: and happiness and Celestina were,
she thought, parted for ever.</P>
<P>Such were her contemplations one evening▪
when, towards the end of the month, and of
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
Lady Horatia's intended stay at the place, she
left the company who were assembled at the
lodgings; and who happened to be the elder
Mr. Thorold, his wife, their son Montague,
and Mr. and Mrs. Bettenson, who being on a
visit to the elder Mr. Thorold, when he was
ordered to the sea for his health, had accom∣panied
him all together to Exmouth, and were
shewn every attention by Lady Horatia, as the
relations of her favourite Montague.</P>
<P>They were at cards; and Celestina, who
never played, took the opportunity of her ad∣mirer's
being engaged at a whist table, from
which she knew he could not immediately
escape, to go out—The wind was high, and
the sea boisterous; it was growing dark, and
she fancied a particular gloom hung over every
object—still, however, it was luxury to her
to be alone; she was particularly wearied by
the conversation of Mr. Thorold; and found
nothing in that of Mrs. Bettenson to make her
amends: Bettenson was ignorant insipidity it∣self;
and time, instead of adding to the num∣ber
of his ideas, seemed to have rendered him,
if possible, more stupid—Amid such society,
she could derive no pleasure from the con∣versation
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
of Mr. Thorold and Lady Horatia;
and the unusual weight she felt on her spirits
seemed lessened, when she could sigh at liberty—and
hear nothing around her but the wind,
or the sea breaking against the shore.</P>
<P>She had not, however, been out long, be∣fore
the chill and gloomy appearance in∣creased;
and darkness coming on, she slowly
and reluctantly returned to the house—She
heard, a little before she quitted the road,
horses behind her; but not attending to them,
she did not even distinguish whether they were
the horses of the people of the place, or those
of travellers. She entered the parlour, and
sat down by the card table, where Montague
Thorold, having performed his evening's task,
had just resigned his place to Mr. Bettenson.
Suddenly a voice was heard in the passage,
enquiring for Lady Horatia Howard of her
servant—"My lady is within, Sir," replied the
man—"And who are with her"—"Mr. and
Mrs. Thorold, and"—The servant was
going on—when the enquirer said vehemently—"It
is enough—let me however see them."
Celestina, at the first sound of this voice, had
started from her chair—The second sentence
<PB N="323" REF="325"/>
it uttered affected her still more; but she had
no time to answer the eager enquiry of Mon∣tague
Thorold—"What is the matter?"—before
the parlour door opened; and pale,
breathless—with an expression to which only
the pencil can do justice, she saw before her
the figure of Willoughby.</P>
<P>There was agony and desperation in his
looks. He gasped—he would have spoken,
but could not. The company all rose in si∣lence.
Lady Horatia, who hardly knew him
even by sight, looked at Celestina for an ex∣planation,
which she was unable to give—At
length Willoughby, as if by an effort of pas∣sionate
phrenzy, approached Celestina—and
said, in a hurried and inarticulate way, "I
would speak to you, Madam—though—to—this
gentleman, I suppose," and he turned to
Montague Thorold, "I must apply for per∣mission."</P>
<P>His manner, his look, as wildly he cast his
eyes around and saw all the family of the
Thorolds assembled, which confirmed his idea
of her being married, contributed to over∣whelm
Celestina with terror and amazement.
She no more doubted of his marriage with his
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
cousin, than he did of hers; and could not
conjecture why he came, or why he looked
so little in his senses—She sat down—for her
limbs refused to support her—and faintly
said, or rather tried to say, "I hope I see Mr.
Willoughby well."</P>
<P>Lady Horatia then addressed herself to him—desired
him to take a chair, and to do her
the honour of staying supper with her.—He
heard or heeded her not—but, with fixed eyes,
gazing on Celestina, he struck his hands to∣gether,
and cried—while the violence of his
emotion choaked him.—"It is all over then—I
have lost her—and have nothing to do
here—No, by heaven, I cannot bear it"—He
then turned away, and left the room as hastily
as lie had entered it.</P>
<P>"My dear Celestina," cried Lady Hora∣tia,
"what does all this mean? Do, Mr.
Montague—for Miss De Mornay is, I see,
much alarmed—Do, speak to Mr. Willoughby—I
am really concerned to see him in such
a situation."</P>
<P>"No;" said Celestina, who would not for
the world have had Montague Thorold follow
him—"No; I will go myself after him"—
<PB N="325" REF="327"/>
Her fears now gave her resolution, and with∣out
heeding Montague Thorold, who would
have prevented her, she hurried after Wil∣loughby,
and overtook him just as he was
quitting the house.</P>
<P>"Dear Sir," said she, "dear Willoughby!"—At
those well known sounds, once so pre∣cious
to him, he turned round—She took his
hand—"I am very sorry to see you," continu∣ed
she, "in such agitations of spirits—I greatly
fear—perhaps—" some misery between him
and his supposed wife occurred to her—"I
am afraid something is wrong—"</P>
<P>"Wrong!" cried he; "Wrong!—and
do you, Celestina, inhuman Celestina, insult me
with such an enquiry?—Wrong!—am I not
the most cursed of human beings?—"</P>
<P>"I hope not," interrupted she—"for your
happiness"—She knew no longer what she
meant to say; nor did he give her time to re∣collect;
for, eagerly rivetting his eyes on her
face, and grasping her hands between his—he
cried—"My happiness!—and what of
my happiness? Is it not gone, lost, for ever—Have
you not destroyed it?—Damnation and
distraction—Why do I linger here?" He
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
then plunged away, and rushed out of the
door, where Farnham waited with two post∣horses—Celestina,
trembling, and attempting
to stop him, followed.</P>
<P>He tried, however, to mount his horse, but
could not: he desisted, leaned against it, with
his arm over the saddle, and resting his head
on his arm: Farnham spoke, and Celestina
immediately recollected him. "What is the
matter with your master, Farnham?" said she,
"indeed he terrifies me to death!"—"Oh,
Ma'am," replied the honest fellow, sorrowfully,
"my poor master! Come, Sir," added he,
interrupted by a look of anguish and horror
from Willoughby—"Come, dear Sir!—you
cannot ride any farther, I am persuaded, to∣night;
let me lead you to the inn." Wil∣loughby,
without resistance, suffered Farnham
to lead him a step or two; but he waved with
his hand for Celestina to leave him, and faintly
said—"Go! go, Madam!—I wish you well!—I
wish you well!"—"Which is the way to
the inn?" cried Farnham.</P>
<P>"Not to the inn—do not go to the inn,"
exclaimed Celestina; "you are very ill, dear
Willoughby; let us take care of you here;
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
Lady Horatia requests it." Farnham led him
towards the door again; he leaned upon him,
and sighed loudly and deeply. At length
he said, "I am a fool!—I came hither know∣ing
all I know <HI>now,</HI> and ought to have been
better prepared for it. But I am better: let
me then execute my last resolution, and bid
her one long, one eternal adieu."</P>
<P>There was a little vacant parlour near the
door; there Willoughby sat down. The ser∣vants,
who were assembled, brought candles:
Celestina stood silently by the table on which
they were placed; and Willoughby bid Farn∣ham
leave the room.</P>
<P>A short silence ensued. Willoughby seemed
to be ashamed of his weakness, and trying to
collect fortitude to bear like a man the cruellest
moment he had ever past, he arose and ap∣proached
Celestina, saying in a low, grave,
and tremulous tone, "I have no right, Ma∣dam,
to distress you—I have no just cause of
complaint against you—I am very miserable—I
deserve your pity—your prayers—I have
been deceived—you, I hope, will never have so
much cause to regret it, as I must have—you,
<PB N="328" REF="330"/>
I hope, are happy—will be happy."—He
could say no more, but put his hand on his
heart, and looked at Celestina with eyes so ex∣pressive
of despair and grief, that all the ex∣quisite
tenderness she had ever felt for him re∣turned
at once; she forgot that he was (as
she believed) the husband of Miss Fitz-Hay∣man;
but he was in a moment the beloved
Willoughby, the first and only possessor of
her heart. She threw her arms around him,
and, sobbing on his bosom, became almost
senseless from the violence and variety of emo∣tions
that overwhelmed her.</P>
<P>He shrunk, however, from her "Who is
it," said he, "gracious Heaven! that I thus
hold in my arms?—Not my Celestina, my own
Celestina; but the wife of another—Go, Ma∣dam—I
entreat you leave me—Go, or phren∣zy
may overtake me, and I may attempt im∣possibilities—to
tear you from your husband."
"Husband!" cried Celestina—"I have no
husband."—"Are you not married then?—not
married to Montague Thorold?"—"No
indeed—indeed, I am not."—"Not married—nor
intending to be married?"—"Neither, in∣deed."—"And
you are at liberty, then, to be
<PB N="329" REF="331"/>
mine."—"I am, if you know that we ought
not to be divided."</P>
<P>Those only who have loved like Willough∣by,
and who, by a sudden transition, are raised
from the abyss of despair to the height of fe∣licity,
can imagine what he felt at that mo∣ment.
If the fear of Celestina's being mar∣ried,
had, for a moment, bereft him of rea∣son;
the certainty of her being not only free,
but as passionately attached to him as ever,
had, for a little time, an equally violent ef∣fect.
Amidst her own transports, the extrava∣gance
of his terrified her. There was a wild∣ness
in his joy which made her tremble for his
intellects. But, after a moment, her soft and
melting voice; the tender assurances she gave
him, that she lived only for him; that her
heart had never been estranged from him,
soothed and subdued the tumult of his beating
heart. As his arms fondly encompassed her;
as he rested his head on her bosom, he shed
tears of tender gratitude; his spirits became
calmer, and the native serene dignity of his
mind returned.</P>
<P>He was not, however, quite tranquil enough
to relate that night to Celestina the extraor∣dinary
<PB N="330" REF="332"/>
series of events, which had led to the
enchanting certainty he now possessed—that
she was not his sister, but the daughter of
Lady Horatia's brother; that regretted bro∣ther,
to whose picture she had so great a re∣semblance.
The information, however, such
as in his present agitated state he was able to
give, convinced her, not only that the fatal
supposition of her being too nearly related to
Willoughby was for ever removed; but, that
she was born of parents to whom it was ho∣nourable
to belong: and that she was nearly
allied by blood to her kind protectress.</P>
<P>She desired Lady Horatia might, be ac∣quainted
with this. "Not to night," said
Willoughby—"I would to night see nobody
but you, my Celestina; hear no voice but
yours—to-morrow I will explain it all. But
now I <HI>feel</HI> my unexpected felicity too forcibly
to be able to talk about it."</P>
<P>He could not, however, determine to quit
Celestina; nor were either of them conscious
of the course of time, till Lady Horatia sent to
let Celestina know supper was ready, and to
beg the honour of Mr. Willoughby's com∣pany.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="333"/>
It was then that Celestina prevailed upon
him to go from her, promising to be ready to
walk with him by the dawn of the next morn∣ing.
"And you must go with me," said he,
"immediately to Alvestone; for I will not
live another week without you." He then
recollected that Alvestone might be sold; for
he had never heard from Cathcart since he
had given directions to have it disposed of
He paused a moment, and felt some uneasi∣ness
in the reflection: but the happiness he
possessed was too great to allow him to feel
any concern long. He smiled, and added,
"If indeed Alvestone is still mine; and, if
it is not, my Celestina will <HI>create</HI> for me a pa∣radise
wherever she is."</P>
<P>"And wherever you are," replied she,
while tears of tenderness filled her eyes, "Ce∣lestina
will <HI>find</HI> a paradise."</P>
<P>He then once more bade her good night—again
returned—and again bade her adieu.
"You are going now to rejoin the company,"
said he, "and there is Montague Thorold, of
whom, I know it is a weakness, I do not love
to think"—</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="334"/>
"It is indeed, Willoughby, a weakness un∣worthy
of your generous heart; and, I hope,
what I can never have deserved that you
should indulge."—"Well, well, my angel
I will not indulge it. But must you sup with
them? They will fatigue you with questions—they
will distress you by enquiries." "No;
I had determined to send an excuse; for, in∣deed,
my heart, yet wondering at its unex∣pected
felicity, beats fearfully, and my trem∣bling
nerves have unfitted me for conver∣sation."</P>
<P>At length Willoughby withdrew; and Ce∣lestina,
with a pencil, told Lady Horatia, who
waited the event of this extraordinary inter∣view
in the most uneasy suspense, that some
extraordinary conversation with Mr. Wil∣loughby
had agitated her so much, that she
could not return to the company, but must
retire to her bed.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who was the most in∣terested
of the party, had suffered all the tor∣tures
of anxious jealousy while Celestina was
absent. Every noise he heard in the passage,
every time the door opened, he hoped she was
<PB N="333" REF="335"/>
coming. She came not. He went out, not
to listen, but in hopes of meeting her. He
heard a low murmur of voices—the tones
were those of tenderness—Willoughby then
was come to claim her: he was forgiven—and
he himself had lost all hope.—He return∣ed
to the parlour, pale and dejected—his lips
trembled; his eyes were still eagerly turned to
the door. He heard nothing that was said to
him; but unable to remain in his seat, again
arose, went out, and returned. At length he
he heard the door of the parlour open, where
Willoughby and Celestina were—he listened
attentively—he heard her say, "Good night,
dear Willoughby." Willoughby seemed, as
he answered, to kiss her hand. Poor Thorold
could not bear it; but became more restless—again
went to the door—came back—opened
it to see if Celestina was coming—then helped
the servant to put the chairs round the supper
table, without knowing what he was doing—and
sat down himself in one next to that
which he had placed for her. The supper was
announced, but no Celestina appeared. At
length the servant brought in the note she had
written. Lady Horatia read it, while poor
<PB N="334" REF="336"/>
Montague anxiously followed her eyes. She
gave it to him across the table: he ran it
over, and his solicitude becoming insupport∣able:
he complained of being ill with the head∣ach,
and desired permission to go to his
lodgings.</P>
<P>The eyes of his father were turned mourn∣fully
towards him, as he went out of the room.
Mr. Thorold, however, did not speak, but he
sighed—and Lady Horatia understood him.
As for his wife, though she had been extremely
averse to the thoughts of her son's marrying
Celestina, while Celestina seemed to be no
more than a rejected dependent on the Wil∣loughby
family; yet now, since Lady Horatia
Howard had adopted her, she appeared to be
altogether as fond of the connection—so
easily are minds like her's changed by adven∣titious
circumstances, and influenced by sounds.
The notice Lady Horatia took of her, and her
daughter Bettenson, delighted and elated
her; rendering her so disgustingly civil, that
only the regard Lady Horatia felt for Mr.
Thorold and Montague, would have induced
her to support the awkward and offensive
adulation of Mrs. Thorold.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="337"/>
The lady of the house was so anxious about
Celestina, that only her general politeness, or
what is usually termed, l'usage du monde, en∣abled
her to acquit herself in the usual forms
towards her guests.</P>
<P>The supper was short and dull—the con∣versation
being divided between Captain Bet∣tenson,
who related a long story of a duel be∣tween
Jack Marsham, of his regiment, and
one Mr. Abbersley, an ensign in the seven∣teenth;
the merits of which nobody under∣stood—and
for the event of which, nobody
cared—and Mrs. Thorold, who described a
dinner and ball given at Exeter, the week be∣fore,
by a banker of that place, on occasion of
his daughter's marriage. With the termina∣tion
of these dissertations, the supper ended;
and Mr. Thorold, who had long been uneasy
and impatient, withdrew with his family.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia then hastened to the chamber
of Celestina; she was just in bed—but knowing
who it was tapped at the door, begged her to
Come in:—</P>
<P>"Well, my dear child," said Lady Horatia,
"and what is all this? I am impatient to
know."—"And I, Madam, impatient to re∣late,
<PB N="336" REF="338"/>
though this evening I am quite unable to
undertake it, all the extraordinary circum∣stances
recounted to me by Willoughby."
"You are then related to him?" "No, thank
Heaven, I am not—I thank Heaven too, that
I am related to you." "To me?" Celestina
then gave a brief account of her birth, and the
way by which Willoughby had learnt those
particulars he had recounted: Lady Horatia
embraced her with tears of rapture. Every
circumstance she recollected of her brother's
visits to France, confirmed the truth of Wil∣loughby's
story; and she very perfectly recol∣lected
the desponding state of mind in which
he went to America, after his last return from
thence. His imprisonment for a few weeks in
the Bastile, which was imputed to some indiscretion,
and that he himself never otherwise
explained—exactly corresponded with what
the Count de Bellegarde had related. But
while every concurrent, testimony evinced
the truth of that narrative, Lady Horatia
could not account for her brother's never
having mentioned his marriage, or his daugh∣ter.—"Perhaps,
however," said she, "he
might have reasons for this, which I cannot
<PB N="337" REF="339"/>
penetrate. My father was harsh, obstinate,
and avaricious; and always expected Ormond
would marry as his elder brother did, to ag∣grandize
his family—this he used frequently
to be teazed to do, but always refused—and
for some years, his disposition retained nothing
of its former vivacity, but an ardour for war,
in which he seemed, I often told him, desirous
rather of death than of promotion: and he
answered me more than once, "That I guessed
right—for that he was weary of life." I own,
I not unfrequently suspected, that some unfor∣tunate
attachment had so shaded his natural
gay and vigorous mind, with gloomy depression.—I
have told him so—and he has replied,
"That whatever might have been the case, he
had no attachment then."</P>
<P>At length, as Celestina extremely needed
repose, Lady Horatia left her, reflecting, with
infinite delight, on the kindness she had shewn
her, as an orphan and a stranger, while she
had, in fact, been protecting the daughter of
her beloved brother. With pleasure too she
now thought of Willoughby, since Celestina's
happiness was to be restored by her union with
him. But poor Montague Thorold, de∣jected
<PB N="338" REF="340"/>
and in despair, relinquishing all those
charming hopes, which, with more pity than
prudence, she had herself encouraged him to
cherish presented himself to her imagination,
and greatly abated the satisfaction, with which
she thought of the approaching felicity of
Willoughby and her neice.</P>
<P>She determined, however, to mitigate, as
much as she could, the force of this cruel blow—and,
early the next morning, while Celes∣tina
was walking with the happy and enrap∣tured
Willoughby, she sent for the elder Mr.
Thorold, and related to him all she had learned
from Celestina the evening before.</P>
<P>"I now blame myself, my good friend,"
said she, "for the part I have taken—but who
could foresee this?—Yet, I own, I fear the
consequences, and heartily wish I had never
given so many opportunities to your son, of
contemplating those perfections of mind and
person, which he will never, I fear, be able to
forget."</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold knew too well that this ob∣servation
was just—and dreaded, lest the: loss
even of reason itself should be the consequence
of Celestina's marriage—he returned home,
<PB N="339" REF="341"/>
however, immediately, to relate to Montague
the probability there was, that this event would
immediately happen. But, however tenderly
he communicated such fatal intelligence, he
found his son more affected by it, than even
his paternal fears had represented.</P>
<P>A silent and heavy despondence took pos∣session
of him. He neither complained of,
nor reproached any one—but persisted in say∣ing,
that he would fee Celestina—take a last
leave of her, and then try to reconcile himself
to his fate.</P>
<P>But in his manner of saying this, there, was
something more distressing to his father, than
he would have felt from the wildest ravings of
despair—he entreated him to relinquish his
project of seeing Celestina.—"Why should
you see her, Montague," said he; "to what
purpose?—You own, that while Willoughby
was in question, you entertained no hope—That
Celestina has never afforded you any
since; but that in spite of her assurances that
she could never feel a second attachment—that
you have persevered, and <HI>taken</HI> that hope
which she refused to give—you have no one,
therefore, to blame; and if you have sought
<PB N="340" REF="342"/>
pain, you must learn to bear it. But after all that
has passed, I cannot consent to your inflicting
it on Celestina, or hazarding the possibility of
giving uneasiness to her husband."</P>
<P>"Husband!" cried Montague Thorold—"he
is not her husband yet—but if he were—can
my humble adoration offend him—when I
mean to bid her an everlastingadieu?—She will
console my sick heart by tender pity—She will
bid me be at peace—and I may try then to
obey her—The sound of her voice is to me so
soothing—that if she does not refuse it, I must
hear it once more speak to me in accents of
kindness."</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold, finding every thing he could
say to dissuade Montague from indulging this
unhappy inclination quite ineffectual, became
extremely uneasy; and dreaded, lest some
alarming consequence should arise from an in∣terview,
which he thought Willoughby could
not approve, even if it were reasonable or
proper in his son to ask it.</P>
<P>But Willoughby, now perfectly secure of
the affections of Celestina, was too generous,
and too noble-minded, not to feel pity for his
unfortunate rival. His own happiness, great
<PB N="341" REF="343"/>
as it was, would have been more complete, if
he could have believed Montague Thorold less
unhappy.—"Would to Heaven," said he,
as he spoke of him to Celestina, "Would to
Heaven that he could see Anzoletta, and
transfer to her that affection, which, while it
is fixed on you, can serve only to render him
miserable."—Celestina joined most cordially
in this wish.—"He deserves to be happy, I
believe," said she; "and the desire you ex∣press
to see him so, is worthy of the heart of
my Willoughby."</P>
<P>But however liberal and reasonable Wil∣loughby
was in regard to a competitor, from
whom, though he had suffered much, he had
now nothing to fear; he was not so patient
under any circumstance that was likely to
impede his union with Celestina.—All that
she or Lady Horatia could urge to him on the
propriety and necessity of a short delay, for
preparations and forms, he treated as ridicu∣lous—and
so vehemently insisted on the ne∣cessity
of fulfilling the promise he had made
to the Count de Bellegarde, at parting with
him, to return to him immediately with Ce∣lestina
as his wife—that their opposition was
<PB N="342" REF="344"/>
to little purpose.—So totally engrossed, how∣ever,
had Willoughby been by his fears lest
Celestina might be lost to him, that he did not
even know whether he had a house to take her
to—but, as with him, all places were alike to
her, he sent an express that morning to Cath∣cart,
informing him, that he should be at
Exeter the next day with Celestina, desiring
him to meet him there with Jessy, and to go
with them to Alvestone, if Alvestone was yet
in his possession.</P>
<P>He dispatched another messenger to Lon∣don
for a special licence to be married at Al∣vestone,
or Exeter; and obviating every re∣maining
seruple, he prevailed on Celestina to
set out with him that evening for the latter
place, with the consent of Lady Horatia, who
promised to follow them in a few days.</P>
<P>The distance was so short, that though it
was late in the day, after Willoughby's arri∣val
at Exmouth, before this was determined
upon, they were at Exeter by seven in the
evening; and in an hour afterwards, Cathcart
and Jessy arrived also.</P>
<P>Cathcart not only informed Willoughby
that his estate was still his, but put into hands
<PB N="343" REF="345"/>
those letters that brought the intelligence of
that acquisition of fortune which came by the
death of Lord Castlenorth.—The satisfaction
of this intelligence, the pleasure of meeting
Cathcart and Jessy, who were overwhelmed
with joy to see them—the certainty of return∣ing
together to a place they both so fondly
loved, seemed to complete the happiness of
the long divided lovers.—Early the next
morning they reached Alvestone, where, in
the absence of Mr. Thorold, his curate joined
the hands of Willoughby and Celestina, above
eighteen months after that period, when they
believed themselves separated for ever.</P>
<P>In three days Lady Horatia arrived at Al∣vestone;
and the additional pleasure her com∣pany
gave them, was checked only by the ac∣count
she gave of the situation of Montague
Thorold—who not having been allowed to see
Celestina, the time of whose departure from
Exmouth had been industriously concealed
from him, had sunk into such a state of des∣pondence,
as made his father tremble for his
reason, if not for his life.</P>
<P>For Vavasour too, whom Willoughby had
always loved, he could not help feeling con∣cern.
<PB N="344" REF="346"/>
—He knew not whither to direct to him;
but from all the accounts he was able to gain,
he feared that all the good qualities of his
heart and understanding were obscured, if not
destroyed, by the dissolute stile of life into
which he had plunged with such avidity,
since their last parting.—He endeavoured,
however, to counteract the impressions of these
only alloys to supreme happiness, by reflecting
on the probable felicity of other friends, and
particularly of the Count of Bellegarde; from
whom, ten days after his marriage, he re∣ceived
a letter, informing him, that he was
then going to Perpignan; empowered to re∣lease
his wife from her convent—and that they
should go, together with their Anzoletta, im∣mediately
to Rochemarte—where he besought
Willoughby to rejoin him, with Celestina—promising,
that if he would do so, they would
return with him, and pass the winter all toge∣ther
in England.</P>
<P>Though it was now late in the year, and
though Celestina would have preferred re∣maining
at Alvestone, where she had fixed all
her ideas of happiness, yet the wishes of her
uncle, and the melancholy satisfaction of vi∣siting
<PB N="345" REF="347"/>
the place where her mother had lived—and
where she died a victim to parental harsh∣ness,
and maternal grief; together with the
inclination Willoughby shewed to gratify the
Count, and introduce his wife to him and
Anzoletta, determined her to make no ob∣jection
to their immediate departure.—There
was, indeed, no time to lose; as the winter
was so near.—Lady Horatia too, who waited
impatiently an interview with Monsieur de
Bellegarde, though she had not health to un∣dertake
such a journey, hastened them as
much as possible; and in something less than a
month after Willoughby called Celestina his,
he presented her, at Rochemarte, to her uncle
de Bellegarde, to Jacquelina, and Anzoletta.
To the two former she appeared the precious
representative of their two beloved and re∣gretted
friends; the tender recollection of
of whom, added to her own merit, made her
to them an object almost of adoration—while
Anzoletta loved her as a sister, to whom she
became more tenderly attached, from taste
and affection, than even that near tie of blood
alone could have attached her.</P>
<P>With what melancholy pleasure did the
<PB N="346" REF="348"/>
Count tie round the neck of Celestina that
picture of her mother, which her father, as he
was dying, had taken from his own bosom—with
an injunction, never to part with it, but
to his daughter.—And how many tears did
Celestina shed, as, leaning on the arm of Wil∣loughby,
he pointed out to her the spot,
which the Count had shewn him, as the grave
of Genevieve.—Willoughby kissed those tears
away, as they filled her eyes—and bade her
turn from the too frequent recollection of the
past, to those scenes of future happiness, which
love, friendship, and fortune, seemed to be pre∣paring
for them.</P>
<P>In the romantic and magnificent scenes
round the castle the poetical taste of Celestina
Was highly gratified. Willoughby took her
the spot where he had been lost in the fortu∣nate
night that eventually led him to the re∣sidence
of the Count of Bellegarde. They
visited together the humble cottage of Le
Laurier, whose family they loaded with kind∣ness;
and traced with her the scenes which
were so many years before witnesses to the
clandestine marriages of Genevieve and Jac∣quelina.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349"/>
Winter, however, put an end to these ex∣cursions
in the mountains; and the Count
de Bellegarde, having completed the settle∣ment
of his affairs, agreed, at the earnest re∣quest
of Willoughby and Celestina, to go with
his wife and daughter to England.</P>
<P>On their journey thither, they met at Paris
Captain and Mrs. Cavanaugh. They found
the former become a man of the utmost im∣portance,
and arrogantly enjoying the splen∣dour
of his new situation, in a country where
he had appeared in one so very different.
Mrs. Cavanaugh seemed to affect being happy—and
to disdain all she had relinquished to
obtain that happiness her own way. But,
from some strange caprice, she now appeared
so fond of Willoughby, that had Celestina
been liable to jealousy—or had Cavanaugh
really cared for his wife, they might both, in
her manner, have found sufficient cause of
discontent. Mrs. Cavanaugh related to Wil∣loughby
all the artifices her mother had used
to break off his marriage with Celestina; and
when he expressed his wonder that Lady
Castlenorth should go such lengths in an affair
in which her interest did not appear to be im∣mediately
<PB N="348" REF="350"/>
or particularly concerned, she an∣swered,
in her usual sneering way—"If you
could know my mother so well as I do—but
it is impossible by words to do her justice—you
would no longer wonder. Her scheme
lay much deeper than you were aware of."</P>
<P>Lady Castlenorth, to console herself for the
defection of Captain Cavanaugh, had taken,
as her travelling companion, a young Abbé,
who, discontented with the prevailing politics
of his country, found in her at once an ad∣mirer
of his person and character, and a stre∣nuous
supporter of his aristocratic principles—and,
what was yet better than either, he found
himself sharing a fortune beyond what he had
ever dreamed of possessing. This well assorted
pair were at Brusseis—and Mrs. Cavanaugh
diverted herself with some sarcastic remarks
on the Director chosen by her mother—of
whom she always spoke with a degree of ran∣cour
which made Celestina tremble, while
Willoughby shuddered to recollect how near
he once was becoming the husband of one
who could thus express herself towards her
mother.</P>
<P>Captain and Mrs. Cavanaugh were going
<PB N="349" REF="351"/>
to Italy.—The happy party, who took leave
of them, hastened to England, where, on their
arrival in London, Lady Horatia joined them,
and they were soon fixed at Alvestone, in such
perfect felicity as is seldom enjoyed, and still
more rarely deserved.—The first enquiry of
Celestina was for Mr. Thorold and his family.
She learned that Captain Thorold was the
great friend and favourite of Lady Molyneux,
with whom he was gone to Ireland to the dis∣pleasure
of his father, who had however no
influence over him, and whose disappointment
in his eldest son was embittered by the condi∣tion
into which a hopeless and incurable
passion had thrown the youngest.</P>
<P>Celestina, who could not reflect, without
great pain, on the unhappiness with which
the days of her excellent friend were thus
over-clouded, took an early opportunity, after
her being settled at Alvestone, to desire an
interview with the elder Mr. Thorold. He
came—and she saw with redoubled concern,
the ravage which anxiety had made on his
manly face and figure, even in a few short
months. He related to her, hardly refraining
from tears, the sad change that had happened
<PB N="350" REF="352"/>
in the temper and talents of his son—"I have
sometimes thought," said he, "that you, my
dear Madam, and you only, can rouse him
from these alienations of mind—I was averse
to his seeing you before you went abroad—but
now I wish it: your reason may reconcile
him to his fate—you pity, soothe him—or, be
the event of your meeting what it may, no
change can, I think, be for the worse." Ce∣lestina
promised to see him—and his father
contrived, with her, the means of procuring
this interview; for Montague now shunned
every body, and very frequently would not
appear, even to his own family.</P>
<P>Celestina did not, however, mean to meet
him alone; but to shew him, in Anzoletta,
beauty, understanding, and sweetness, with a
heart untouched by any former passion, and
worthy of his. Her generous intentions, suc∣ceeded.—Montague
Thorold, struck with the
resemblance between them, and particularly
with the voice of Anzoletta, was soon as pas∣sionately
attached to her, as a man could be,
who had once loved Celestina herself. The
Count of Bellegarde, who intended to bestow
her, with her ample fortune, on an English∣man,
<PB N="351" REF="353"/>
and a Protestant, hesitated not a moment,
in consenting to an union which would, he
found, make his daughter happy; and, eight
months after the marriage of Willoughby and
Celestina, Anzoletta gave her hand, in the
chapel of Alvestone, to Montague Thorold.</P>
<P>Willoughby had now but one wish unful∣filled—for
every pecuniary difficulty, the mu∣nificence
of the Count de Bellegarde, and the
legacy of Lord Castlenorth, had removed—and
this one wish was, to see Vavasour such
as a reasonable being, with every reasonable
means of happiness in his power, ought to be.
But in this, as he had no second Anzoletta to
give him, and should have feared his want of
steadiness if he had, he almost despaired of
being gratified.</P>
<P>Vavasour, however, sometimes visited at
Alvestone; and, unlike Montague Thorold,
he seemed to have conquered his extravagant
passion for Celestina, since it was become
hopeless. He had, unluckily for him, taken
up no permanent affection in its place; but
lost his health, and his fortune in pursuits
which could not afford him even a temporary
<PB N="352" REF="354"/>
possession of that happiness for which he still
declared himself to be in search.</P>
<P>When Celestina reflected on his kindness to
Mrs. Elphinstone and her children, who now
lived in comfort on the provision he had made
for them; and on many other generous and
noble actions; she could not but lament, with
Willoughby, that infelicity of which he con∣tinually
complained, even amid his wildest and
most determined perseverance in the career of
dissolute pleasure. But for this source of regret,
as there seemed to be no remedy within her
power, she did not suffer it to embitter the
satisfaction she derived from almost every
other friend.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia no longer complained of that
tedium which, at the beginning of their ac∣quaintance,
seemed to have rendered life indif∣ferent
to her. She had now, in Willoughby,
and his lovely wife, objects of her affection;
and hoped to grow old amidst their children.
Monsieur and Madam de Bellegarde, were
more acutely sensible of their present happi∣ness,
from the poignancy of their past afflic∣tions;
and their daughter, the object of their
tender solicitude, made the felicity of a worthy
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
man, who deserved the affection she felt for
him. In Cathcart and Jessy, Celestina beheld
the earliest objects of her beneficence—enjoy∣ing
all that affluence and mutual tenderness
could bestow—And the widowed heart of Mrs.
Elphinstone was at ease, not only by her
own present independence, but from the as∣surances
Willoughby had given her, of pro∣viding
for her boys, as soon as they were of
the age when they could be put to professions.
The elder Mr. Thorold, too, her venerable
and respectable friend, was restored to happi∣ness,
in contemplating that of his son: and
above all, Celestina beheld in Willoughby,
the best and most affectionate of husbands—whose
whole life was dedicated to the pur∣pose
of making her happy—and whose only
apprehension seemed to be, that with all he
could do, he must fall infinitely short of that
degree of merit towards either heaven or
earth, which that fortunate being ought to
possess, who was blessed with so lovely and
perfect a creature as Celestina.</P>
