<P>THE COUNTRY GIRL, A COMEDY, (Altered from WYCHERLEY) As it is ACTED at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>DUBLIN: Printed for W. and W. SMITH, J. HOEY, Sen. J MURPHY, W. WHITESTONE, H. SAUNDERS, D. CHAMBERLAINE, J. POTTS, J. HOEY, Jun. J. WILLIAMS, O. ADAMS &amp; T. RYDER, and W. COLLES.</P>

<P>THE Desire of shewing Miss REYNOLDS to Advantage, was the first Motive for attempting an Alteration of WYCHERLEY'S COUNTRY WIFE. Tho' near half of the following Play is new written, the Alterer claims no Merit, but his Endeavour to clear one of our most celebrated Comedies from Immorality and Obscenity. He thought himself bound to preserve as much of the O∣riginal, as could be presented to an Audience of these Times without Offence; and if this Wanton of CHARLES'S Days is now so re∣claimed, as to become innocent without being insiped, the present Editor will not think his Time ill employed, which has enabled him to add some little Variety to the Entertain∣ments of the Publick. There seems indeed an absolute Necessity for reforming many Plays of our most eminent Writers: For no kind of Wit ought to be received as an Excuse for for Immorality, nay it becomes still more dangerous in proportion as it is more witty—Without such a Reformation, our <HI>English</HI> Co∣medies must be reduced to a very small Num∣ber, and would pall by a too frequent Repe∣tition, or what is worse, continue shameless in spite of publick Disapprobation.</P>
<P>Whatever fate this Play may have in the Closet, it is much indebted to the Prefor∣mers for its favourable Reception upon the Stage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>HA, ha, ha! and so you are in love, ne∣phew, not reasonably and gallantly, as a young gentleman ought, but sighingly, miserably so—not content to be ankle-deep, you have sous'd over head and ears—ha, Dick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pretty much in that condition, indeed, uncle. <STAGE>[sighs.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, never blush at it—when I was of your age, I was asham'd too;—but three years at College, and half a one at Paris, methinks should have cur'd you of that unfashionable weakness—modesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I have releas'd myself from that, I had, perhaps, been at this instant happy in the possession of what I must despair now ever to obtain—heigho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! very foolish indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't laugh at me, uncle; I am foolish, I know; but, like other fools, I deserve to be pitied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee don't talk of pity; how can I help you?—for this country girl of yours is certainly mar∣ried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—I won't believe it; she is not mar∣ried, nor she shan't, If I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, modesty;—with such a spirit you can help yourself, Dick, without my assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must encourage, and advise me too, or I shall never make any thing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Provided the girl is not married; for I never, never encourage young men to covet their neighbours wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart assures me, that she is not married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O to be sure, your heart is much to be rely'd upon—but to convince you that I have a fellow-feeling of your distress, and that I am as nearly ally'd to you in missortunes as in relationship—you must know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, uncle? you alarm me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am in love too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miserably in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's charming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my mistress is just going to be married to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better, and better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew my fellow-sufferings would please you; but now prepare for the wonderful wonder of wonders!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mistress is in the same house with yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, are you in love with Peggy too?<STAGE>[rising from his chair.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, jealousy.—No, no, set your heart at rest.—Your Peggy is too young, and too simple for me—I must have one a little more knowing, a little bet∣ter bred, just old enough to see the difference between me and a coxcomb, spirit enough to break from a brother's engagements, and chuse for herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't mean Alithea, who is to be married to Mr. Sparkish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't I be in love with a lady that is going to be married to another, as well as you, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sparkish is your friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee don't call him my friend; he can be
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
nobody's friend, not even his own—He would thrust himself into my acquaintance, would introduce me to his mistress, tho' I have told him again and again that I was in love with her, which instead of ridding me of him, has made him only ten times more troublesome—and me really in love—He should suffer for his self∣sufficiency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a conceited puppy!—And what success with the lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No great hopes,—and yet, if I could defer the marriage a few days, I should not despair;—her ho∣nour, I am confident, is her only attachment to my ri∣val—she can't like Sparkish, and if I can work upon his credulity, a credulity which even popery would be asham'd of, I may yet have the chance of throwing sixes upon the dice to save me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can save <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not if you whine and sigh, when you should be exerting every thing that is man about you. I have sent Sparkish, who is admitted at all hours in the house, to know how the land lies for you, and if she is not married already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cruel you are—you raise me up with one hand, and then knock me down with the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, she shan't be married. <STAGE>[knocking at the door.]</STAGE> This is Sparkish, I suppose; don't drop the least hint of your passion to him; if you do, you may as well advertise it in the publick papers.</P>
</SP>

<P>I'll be careful.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>An odd sort of a person, from the country I believe, who calls himself Moody, wants to see you, Sir; but as I did not know him, I said you were not at home, but would return directly; <HI>and so will I too,</HI> said he, very short and surly! and away he went, mum∣bling to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Will.—I'll see him when he comes. <STAGE>[Exit Servant.]</STAGE> Moody call to see me!—He has some∣thing more in his head than making me a visit—'tis to complain of you, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can he know me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must suppose the worst, and be prepared for him—tell me all you know of this ward of his, this Peggy—Peggy what's her name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thrift, Thrift, uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Sir Thomas Thrift's daughter, of Hampshire, and left very young, under the guardianship of my old companion and acquaintance, Jack Moody.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your companion!—he's old enough to be your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, nephew—he has greatly the ad∣vantage of me in years, as well as wisdom—When I first launched from the university, into this ocean of London—he was the greatest rake in it; I knew him well, for near two years, but all of a sudden he tooka freak (a very prudent one) of retiring wholly into the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>There he gain'd such an ascendency over the odd disposition of his neighbour, Sir Thomas, that he left him sole guardian to his daughter, who forfeits half her fortune, if she does not marry with his con∣sent—there's the devil, uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you so young, so foolish, and so much in love, that you would take her with half her value? ha, nephew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take her with any thing—with nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! such an unaccomplish'd, aukward, silly creature—he has scarce taught her to write—she has seen nobody to converse with, but the country people about 'em; so she can do nothing but dangle her arms, look gawky, turn her toes in, and talk broad Hampshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't abuse her sweet simplicity—had you but heard her talk, as I have done, from the garden-wall in the country, by moon-light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Romeo and Juliet, I protest, ha, ha, ha! <HI>Arise fair sun, and kill the envious</HI>—ha, ha, ha! How often have you seen this fair Capulet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw her three times in the country, and spoke to her twice; I have leap'd an orchard-wall, like Ro∣meo, to come at her, play'd the balcony-scene, from an old summer-house in the garden; and if I lose her, I
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
will find out an apothecary, and play the tomb-scene too, for I cannot bear to be cross'd in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Dick!—this spirit must produce something—but has the old dragon ever caught you sighing at her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never in the country; he saw me yesterday kissing my hand to her, from the new tavern-window that looks upon the back of his house, and immediately drove her from it, and fasten'd up the window-shut∣ters.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Sparkish without.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Will. I'll go up to 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear Sparkish coming up—take care of what I told you—not a word of Peggy;—hear his intelli∣gence, and make use of it, without seeming to mind it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mum, mum, uncle.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Sparkish.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, my dear Harcourt, I shall die with laugh∣ing—I have such news for thee—ha, ha, ha!—What, your nephew too, and a little dumpish or so—you have been giving him a lecture upon oeconomy, I suppose—you, who never had any, can best describe the evils that arise from the want of it.—I never mind my own affairs, not I.—I hear, Mr. Belville, you have got a pretty snug house, with a bow-window that looks into the Park, and a back-door that goes out into it.—Very convenient, and well imagin'd—no young handsome fellow should be without one—you may be always ready there, like a spider in his web, to seize upon stray'd women of quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you us'd to do—you vain fellow you—prithee don't teach my nephew your abandoned tricks—he is a modest young man, and you must not spoil him.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so; but his modesty has done some mischief at our house—my surly, jealous brother-in-law saw that modest young gentleman casting a wishful eye at his forbidden fruit from the new tavern window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake the person, Mr. Sparkish, I don't know what young lady you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain yourself, Sparkish, you must mistake—Dick has never seen the girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Spar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say he has; I only tell you what <HI>Moody</HI> says. Besides, he went to the tavern himself, and enquir'd of the waiter, who din'd in the back∣room,—No. 4,—and they told him it was Mr. Bel∣ville, your nephew—that's all I know of the matter, or desire to know of it—faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>He kiss'd his hand, indeed, to your lady, Ali∣thea, and is more in love with her than you are, and very near as much as I am; so look about you, such a youth may be dangerous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more danger the more honour, I defy you both—win her and wear her, if you can—<HI>Dolus an vir∣tus</HI> in love as well as in war—tho' you must be expedi∣tious, faith; for I believe, if I don't change my mind, I shall marry her to-morrow or the day after.—Have you no honest clergyman, Harcourt, no fellow-colle∣gian to recommend to me to do the business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing ever sure was so lucky. <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE> Why, faith, I have, Sparkish—my brother, a twin∣brother, Ned Harcourt, will be in town to day, and proud to attend your commands—I am a very generous rival, you see, to lend my brother to marry the woman I love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so am I too, to let your brother come so near us—But Ned shall be the man; poor Alithea grows impatient—I can't put off the evil day any longer—I fancy the brute, her brother, has a mind to marry his country ideot at the same time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, country idiot, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Taisez vous bete. <STAGE>[aside to <HI>Belv.</HI>]</STAGE> I thought he had been married already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he's not married, that's the joke of it.</P>

<P>No, no, he is not married.</P>

<P>Hold your tongue— <STAGE>[elbowing <HI>Belville.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not he—I have the finest story to tell you—by the by, he intends calling upon you, for he ask'd me where you liv'd, to complain of <HI>modesty</HI> there—He pick'd up an old raking acquaintance of his, as we came along together—Will. Frankly, who saw him with his girl, sculking and mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>led up, at the play last night—he plagu'd him much about matrimony, and his

being asham'd to shew himself; swore he was in love with his wife, and intended to cuckold him; do you, cry'd Moody, folding his arms, and scouling with his eyes thus—<HI>You must have more wit than you us'd to have—Besides, if you have as much as you think you have, I shall be out of your reach, and this profligate metropolis, in less than a week</HI>—Moody would feign have got rid of him, but the other held him by the sleeve, so I left 'em; rejoic'd most luxuriously to see the poor devil tormented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you said, just now, that he was not married—is not that a contradiction, Sir?</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Harcourt</HI> still makes signs to <HI>Belville.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is a kind of a one—but considering your modesty, and your ignorance of the young lady, you are pretty tolerably inquisitive methinks, ha, Har∣court! ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh, pooh! don't talk to that baby, tell me all you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, my boody of a brother-in-law hath brought up this ward of his (a good fortune let me tell you) as he coops up, and fattens his chick∣ens, for his own eating—he is plaguy jealous of her, and was very sorry that he could not marry her in the country, without coming up to town; which he could not do on account of some writings or other; so what does my gentleman, he persuades that poor silly girl by breaking a six-pence, or some nonsense or another, that they are to all intents married in heaven; but that the laws require the signing of articles, and the church service to compleat their union—so he has made her call him husband, and bud, which she constantly does, and he calls her wife, and gives out she is married, that she may not look after younger fellows, nor younger fellows after her, egad; ha, ha, ha! and all won't do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Sir—what heav'nly news, uncle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an ideot you are nephew! And so then you make but one trouble of it; and are both to be tack'd together the same day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>No▪ no, he can▪t be married this week; he damns the lawyers for keeping him in town;—besides
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
I am out of favour; and he is continually snarling at me, and abusing me, for not being jealous. <STAGE>[knocking at the door.]</STAGE> There he is—I must not be seen with you, for he'll suspect something; I'll go with your nephew to his house, and we'll wait for you, and make a visit to my wife that is to be, and, perhaps, we shall shew young Modesty here a sight of Peggy too.</P>

<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, here's the strange odd sort of a gentleman come again, and I have shewn him into the fore-parlour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must he Moody! well said, Will, an odd sort of a strange gentleman indeed; we'll step into the next room 'till he comes into this, and then you may have him all to yourself—much good may do you. <STAGE>[<HI>Sparkish</HI> going, returns.]</STAGE> Remember that he is married, or he'll suspect me of betraying him.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit <HI>Sparkish and Belville.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew him up Will. Now must I prepare my∣self to see a very strange, tho' a very natural meta∣morphosis—a once high-spirited, handsome, well∣dress'd, raking prodigal of the town, sunk into a surly, suspicious oeconomical, country sloven—le voila.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Moody.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Harcourt, your humble servant—have you forgot me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my old friend Jack Moody! by thy long absence from the town, the grumness of thy coun∣tenance, and the slovenlyness of thy habit, I should give thee joy—you are certainly married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>My long stay in the country will excuse my dress, and I have a suit of law, that brings me up to town, and puts me out of humour—besides, I must give Sparkish ten thousand pounds to-morrow to take my sister off my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sister is very much obliged to you—be∣ing so much older than her, you have taken upon you the authority of a father, and have engaged her to a coxcomb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, and to oblige her—nothing but cox∣combs, or debauchees are the favourites now-a-days, and a coxcomb is rather the more innocent animal of the two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has sense, and taste, and can't like him; so you must answer for the consequences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>When she is out of my hands, her husband must look to consequences. He's a fashionable fool, and will cut his horns kindly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is to secure your worship from con∣sequences—I did not expect marriage from such a rake—one that knew the town so well: fye, fye, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you my security—I have married no London wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all one—that grave circumspection in marrying a country wife, is like refusing a deceitful, pamper'd, Smithfield-jade, to go and be cheated by a friend in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish the devil had both him and his simile. <STAGE>[aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, never grumble about it; what's done can't be undone; is your wife handsome and young?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has little beauty but her youth, nothing to brag of but her health, and no attraction but her modesty—wholesome, homely, and housewifely—that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk as like a grazier, as you look, Jack—why did you not bring her to town before to be taught something?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which something I might repent as long as I live—No, no, women and private soldiers should beig∣norant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But prithee why wouldst thou marry her, if she be ugly, ill-bred, and silly? She must be rich then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>As rich, as if she had the wealth of the mo∣gul—she'll not ruin her husband, like a London bag∣gage, with a million of vices she never heard of—then because she's ugly, she's the likelier to be my own; and being ill-bred, she'll hate conversation; and since silly and innocent, will not know the difference between me and you; that is, between a man of thirty, and one of forty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifty, to my knowledge— <STAGE>[<HI>Moody</HI> turns off, and grumbles.]</STAGE> But see how you and I differ, Jack—wit to me is more necessary than beauty: I think no young woman ugly, that has it; and no handsome woman agreeable without it.</P>
</SP>

<P>'Tis my maxim—He's a fool that marries; but he's a greater that does not marry a fool.—I know the town, Mr. Harcourt; and my wife shall be virtuous in spite of you or your nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>My nephew!—poor sheepish lad—he runs a∣way from every woman he sees—he saw your sister Ali∣thea at the opera, and was much smitten with her—He always toasts her—and hates the very name of Spark∣ish; I'll bring him to your house—and you shall see what a formidable Tarquin he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no curiosity, so give yourself no trou∣ble.—You have heard of a wolf in sheep's cloathing, and I have seen your innocent nephew kissing his hands at my windows.</P>

<P>At your sister, I suppose; nor at her unless he was tipsy—How can you, Jack, be so outragiously suspicious? Sparkish has promis'd to introduce him to his mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sparkish is a fool, and may be, what I'll take care not to be—I confess my visit to you, Mr. Har∣court, was partly for old acquaintance sake, but chiefly to desire your nephew to confine his gallantries to the tavern, and not send 'em in looks, signs, or tokens, on the other side the way—I keep no brothel—so pray tell your nephew. <STAGE>[going.</STAGE></P>

<P>Nay, prithee, Jack, leave me in better hu∣mour—Well, I'll tell him, ha, ha, ha! poor Dick, how he'll stare. This will give him a reputation, and the girls won't laugh at him any longer. Shall we dine to∣gether at the tavern, and send for my nephew to chide him for his gallantry? ha, ha, ha! we shall have fine sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not to be laught out of my senses, Mr. Harcourt—I was once a modest, meek young gentle∣man myself, and I never have been half so mischievous before or since, as I was in that state of innocence—And so, old friend, make no ceremony with me—I have
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
much business, and you have much pleasure, and there∣fore, as I hate forms, I will excuse your returning my visit; or sending your nephew to satisfy me of his mo∣desty—and so your servant.</P>

<P><STAGE>[alone.]</STAGE> Ha, ha, ha! poor Jack! what a life of suspicion does he lead! I pity the poor fellow, tho' he ought, and will, suffer for his folly—Folly! 'tis treason, murder, sacrilege!

<P>What ails you, Miss Peggy? you are grown quite melancholy.</P>

<P>Would it not make any one melancholy to see your mistress Alithea go every day fluttering about abroad to plays and assemblies, and I know not what, whilst I must stay at home, like a poor lonely sullen bird in a cage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Miss Peggy, I thought you chose to be confin'd: I imagin'd that you had been bred so young to the cage, that you had no pleasure in flying about, and hopping in the open air, as other young ladies who go a little wild about this town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I confess, I was quiet enough, 'till somebody told me what pure lives the London ladies lead, with their dancing meetings, and junketings, and dress'd every day in their best gowns; and I war∣rant you play at nine-pins every day in the week, so they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Miss, you will lead a better life when join'd in holy wedlock with your sweet temper'd guardian, the chearful Mr. Moody.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't lead a worse, that's one good thing—but I must make the best of a bad market, for I can't marry nobody else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Miss? that's very strange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we have a contraction to one another—so we are as good as married, you know—</P>

<P>I know it! Heav'n forbid, Miss—</P>

<P>Don't sigh, Miss Peggy—if that young gen∣tleman, who was here just now, would take pity on me, I'd throw such a contract as yours behind the fire.</P>

<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord bless us, how you talk!</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young Mr. Belville would make you talk otherwise, if you knew him.</P>

<P>Mr. Belville!—where is he?—when did you see him?—you have undone me, Lucy—where was he? did he say any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say any thing! very little, indeed—he's quite distracted, poor young creature. He was talk∣ing with your guardian just now.</P>

<P>The duce he was! but where was it, and when was it?</P>

<P>In this house, five minutes ago, when your guardian turn'd you into your chamber, for fear of your being seen.</P>

<P>I knew something was the matter, I was in such a sluster—but what did he say to my Bud?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call him Bud for? Bud means husband, and he is not your husband yet—and I hope never will be—and if he was my husband, I'd bud him, a surly unreasonable beast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd call him any names, to keep him in good humour—if he'd let me marry any body else (which I can't do) I'd call him husband as long as he liv'd—But what said Mr. Belville to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what he said to him, but I'll tell you what he said to me, with a sigh, and his hand upon his breast as he went out of the door—If you ever were in love, young gentlewoman, (meaning me) and can pity a most faithful lover—tell the dear object of my affections—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meaning me, Lucy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you, to be sure. Tell the dear object of my affections, I live but upon the hopes that she is not married; and when those hopes leave me—she knows the rest—then he cast up his eyes thus—gnash'd his teeth—struck his forehead—would have spoke again, but could not—fetch'd a deep sigh, and vanish'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is really very fine—I'm sure it makes my heart sink within me, and brings tears into my eyes—O he's a charming sweet—but hush, hush, I hear my husband!</P>

<P>Yes, after nine-pins: you suffer none to give her those longings you mean, but yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Mrs. Elippant, good precepts are lost when bad examples are still before us: the liber∣ty your mistress takes abroad makes her hanker after it, and out of humour at home: poor wretch! she desired not to come to London; I would bring her.</P>

<P>Then if she ask you again, you are the cause of her asking, and not my mistress.</P>

<P>Come, have a little patience, and thou shalt go into the country next week.</P>

<P>Your tongue runs too glibly, Madam, and you have liv'd too long with a London lady, to be a proper companion for innocence—I am not overfond of you, mistress.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no love lost between us.</P>
</SP>

<P>AND the moment Moody left me, and be∣fore I left his lodgings, I took an opportu∣nity of conveying some tender sentiments thro' Lucy to Miss Peggy, and it was Lucy advis'd me to strole here this evening; and here I am in expectation of seeing my country goddess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so to blind Moody, and take him off the scent of your passion for this girl, and at the same time to give me an opportunity with Sparkish's mis∣tress, (and of which I have made the most) you hinted to him with a grave melancholy face, that you were dying for his sister—gad-a-mercy, nephew! I will back thy modesty against any other in the three king∣doms—It will do, Dick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could I do, uncle?—it was my last stake, and I play'd for a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me, Dick, I don't say you could do better—I only can't account for your modesty's doing so much; you have done such wonders, that I, who am rather bold than sheepish, have not yet ceas'd wondering at you. But do you think that you impos'd upon him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I can't say—I am rather doubtful, he said very little, grumbled much, shook his head, and shew'd me the door.—But what success have you had with Alithea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just enough to have a glimmering of hope, without having light enough to see an inch before my nose.—This day will produce something; Alithea is a woman of great honour, and will sacrifice her happiness to it, unless Sparkish's absurdity stand my friend, and does every thing that the fates ought to do for me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I can tho', thanks to my wit, and his want of it; a foolish rival, and a jealous husband, assist their rivals designs, for they are sure to make their women hate them, which is their first step to their love for another man.</P>

<P>But you cannot come near his mistress but in his company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Sir: no, I thank you. 'Gad I go to a play, as to a country treat: I carry my own wine to one, and my own wit to t'other, or else I'm sure I should not be merry at either: and the reason why we are so often louder than the players, is, be∣cause we hate authors damnably.</P>

<P>O yes, I despise writing. But women! wo∣men, that make men do all foolish things, make 'em write songs too. Every body does it: 'Tis e'en as common with lovers, as playing with fans; and you can no more help rhyming to your Phillis, than drink∣ing to your Phillis.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the poets damn'd your songs, did they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, damn the poets; they turn'd them into burlesque, as they call it: That burlesque is a hocus pocus trick they have got, which by the virtue of hictius doctius, topsey turvey, they make a clever witty thing absolute nonsense; do you know, Har∣court, that they ridicul'd my last song, <HI>twang, twang,</HI> the best I ever wrote?</P>

<P>That's his deceit, my sweet creature—He pretends to have married you, for fear of your liking any body else—You have a right to chuse for your∣self, and there is no law in heaven or earth that binds you before marriage to a man you cannot like.</P>

<P>WELL, Madam, now I have dress'd you, and set you out with so many ornaments, and spent so much time upon you, and all this for no other purpose but to bury you alive; for I look upon Mr. Sparkish's bed to be little better than a grave.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Twas because I was not hard-hearted.</P>

<P>No, no; 'twas stark love and kindness, I warrant?</P>

<P>Can there be a greater cheat or wrong done to a man, than to give him your person, without your heart? I should make a conscience of it.</P>

Come, let me lock you up in your chamber, till I come back; and be sure you come not within three strides of the window, when I am gone; for I have a spy in the street. <STAGE>[puts her into the chamber.]</STAGE> At least 'tis fit she thinks so; if we do not cheat women, they'll cheat us, and fraud may be justly used with secret enemies, of which a wife is the most dangerous; and he that has a handsome one to keep, and a frontier town, must pro∣vide against treachery rather than open force—Now I have secured all within, I'll deal with the foe with∣out, with false intelligence. This will dash all his im∣pudent hopes <STAGE>[holds up the letter]</STAGE> at once, and I shall sleep now securely in my garrison without fear of sur∣prize—But no time is to be lost—I'll steal a march upon him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I run great risques to be sure to serve the young lady, and you, Sir—but I know you are a gentleman of honour, and wou'd scorn to betray a friend who means you well, and is above being mer∣cenary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you are not mercenary, Mrs. Lucy, I ought to be the more generous—give me leave to pre∣sent you with this trifle, <STAGE>[gives a ring.]</STAGE> not as a re∣ward for services, but as a small token of friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I scorn to be brib'd in any cause, yet I am proud to accept it, as a mark of your regard, and as such shall keep it for your sake—and now to busi∣ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flatter me then, that Miss Peggy has the most rooted aversion for her guardian, and some preju∣dices in my favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has intrusted me with her very thoughts—and I have rais'd her disobedience to such a pitch,
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
that she would have open'd her whole heart to you in a letter, had we not been interrupted by her brutal guardian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>She told me in the Park, that you had con∣vinced her she was not married to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was not much difficulty in that; but if any thing could have frighten'd her into that belief, her filthy guardian had done it—He made her almost believe, that the saving her soul depended upon mar∣rying him—Did you ever hear of such a reprobate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>How I adore her bewitching simplicity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simplicity, Sir! she's able to make a fool of any of us—if I had half her wit, I would not conti∣nue long in service, as well as I love my mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Lucy, what can Miss Peggy pro∣pose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To run away from her guardian, and marry you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>She might have done both, and lost the op∣portunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will do both, and make an opportunity, if it does not come of itself. The thought of running away, or of being married, when taken separately, will put any maiden of us into great confusion; but when they come both together, are too much for the boldest of us—Miss Peggy was overpower'd with your pro∣posal, and no wonder she could not determine for the best; I should have been a little frighten'd myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But has the dear creature resolv'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has she—why, she will run away and mar∣ry you, in spite of your teeth, the first moment she can break prison—so you, in your turn, must take care not to have your qualms—I have known several bold gentlemen not able to draw their swords, when a chal∣lenge has come too quick upon 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Mrs. Lucy, that I am no bully in love, and Miss Peggy will meet with her match, come when she will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, so you all say, but talking does no busi∣ness—stay at home till you hear from us.</P>

<P>Sir, from the peculiarity of your character, and your intimacy with my uncle, I shall allow you great privileges: but you must consider, youth has its privileges too; and as I have not the honour of your acquaintance, I am not oblig'd to bear with your ill humours, or your ill manners.</P>

<P>Faith I don't know but I am, for I have lost your sister, and I shan't eat half an ounce the less at dinner for it; there's philosophy for you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insensibility, you mean—I hope you don't mean to use my sister ill, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, Sir, she has used me ill; she's in her tantrums—I have had a narrow escape, Sir.</P>

<P>If thou art endow'd with the smallest por∣tion of understanding, explain this riddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, prithee, Sparkish—condescend to be intelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know—we had settled to be married—it is the same thing to me, whether I am married or not—I have no particular fancy one way or another, and so I told your sister; off or on, 'tis the same thing to me; but the thing was fix'd, you know—You and my Aunt brought it about—I had no hand in it, and, to shew you, that I was as wil∣ling to marry your sister as any other woman, I suffer∣ed the law to tye me up to hard terms, and the church would have finish'd me still to harder—but she was taken with her tantrums!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn your tantrums—come to the point.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, you shall hear my story out.—She walk'd up within pistol-shot of the church—then twirl'd round upon her heel—call'd me every name she could think of; and when she had exausted her imagination, and tir'd her tongue—no easy mat∣ter, let me tell you—she call'd her chair, sent her footman to buy a monkey before my face, then bid me good morrow with a sneer, and left us with our mouths open in the middle of a hundred people, who were all laughing at us! If these are not tantrums, I don't know what are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! I thank thee, Sparkish, from my soul; 'tis a most exquisite story; I have not had such a laugh for this half year—Thou art a most ri∣diculous puppy, and I am infinitely oblig'd to thee; ha, ha, ha!</P>

<P>WELL, 'tis e'en so, I have got the Lon∣don disease they call love; I am sick of my guardian, and dying for Mr. Belville! I have heard this distemper call'd a fever, but methinks it is liker an ague; for, when I think of my guardian, I tremble, and am in a cold sweat; but when I think of my gallant, dear Mr. Belville, my hot fit comes, and I am all in a fever indeed: my own chamber is tedious to me, and I would fain be remov'd to his, and then methinks I shou'd be very well. Ah! poor Mr. Belville! Well, I cannot, will not stay here; therefore I'll make an end of my letter to him, which shall be a finer letter than my last, because I have studied it like any thing.

<P>Well, I resolve it, Belville shall have her: I'd rather give him my sister, than lend him my wife; and such an alliance will prevent his pretensions to my wife, sure—I'll make him of kin to her, and then he won't care for her.</P>

<P>Won't she come hither?</P>

<SP>

<P>No, no, she's a sham'd to look you in the face; she'll go directly to Mr. Belville, she says—She must speak with him, before she discovers all to you—or even sees you—She says too, that you shall know the reason by-and-by—Pray let her have her way, Bud—she won't be pacify'd if you don't—and will never for∣give me—For my part, Bud, I believe, but don't tell any body, they have broken a piece of silver between 'em—or have contracted one another, as we have

done, you know, which is the next thing to being mar∣ry'd.</P>

<P>Stay, stay, Peggy—let her have her own way—she shall go to Belville herself, and I'll follow her—that will be best—let her have her whim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're in the right, Bud—for they have certainly had a quarrel, by her crying and hanging her head so—I'll be hang'd if her eyes an't swell'd out of her head, she's in such a piteous taking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Belville shan't use her ill, I'll take care of that—if he has made her a promise, he shall keep to it—but she had better go first—a word or two by themselves will clear matters for my appearance—I will follow her at a distance, that she may have no in terruption; and I will wait in the Park before I see them, that they may come to a reconciliation before I come upon 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law, Bud, how wise you are! I wish I had half your wisdom; you see every thing at once—Stand a one side then—and I'll tell her you are gone to your room, and when she passes by, you may follow her.</P>

<P>My case is something better—for suppose the worst—should Belville use her ill—I had rather fight him for not marrying my sister, than for debauch∣ing my wife, for I will make her mine absolutely tomorrow; and of the two, I had rather find my sister too forward than my wife: I expected no other from her free education, as she calls it, and her passion for the town—Well, wife and sister are names which make us expect love and duty, pleasure and comfort but we find 'em plagues and torments, and are equally, tho' differently, troublesome to their keeper.

<P>If I can but meet with her, or any body that belongs to her, they will find me a match for 'em—When a man has wit, and a great deal of it—Champagne gives it a double edge, and nothing can with stand it—'tis a lighted match to gunpowder—the mine is sprung, and the poor devils are toss'd heels uppermost in an instant. I was right to consult my friends, and they all agree with Moody, that I make a damn'd ridiculous figure, as matters stand at present. I'll consult Belville—this is his house, he's my friend too—and no fool—It shall be so—damn it, I must not be ridiculous. <STAGE>[going to the door, sees <HI>Peggy</HI> coming.]</STAGE> Hold! hold! if the Cham∣pagne does not hurt my eye-sight, while it sharpens my wit, the enemy is marching up this way—Come on, Madam Alithea; now for a smart fire, and then let's see who will be ridiculous.</P>

You need not have been walking alone this evening, if you had been wiser yesterday—What, nothing to say for yourself?—Repentance, I suppose, makes you as aukward and as foolish, as the poor country girl your brother has lock'd up in Pall Mall.</P>
