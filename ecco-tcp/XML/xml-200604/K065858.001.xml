<P>WITH

<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>THE melancholy duty of examining the Papers of my
deceased Friend devolved upon me at a time when I
was depressed by severe afflictions.</P>
<P>In that state of mind, I hesitated to undertake the
task of selecting and preparing his Manuscripts for the
press. The warmth of my early and long attachment to
Mr. Gibbon made me conscious of a partiality, which
it was not proper to indulge, especially in revising
many of his juvenile and unfinished compositions. I
had to guard, not only against a sentiment like my
own, which I found extensively diffused, but also against
the eagerness occasioned by a very general curiosity to see
in print every literary relick, however imperfect, of so
distinguished a writer.</P>
<P>Being aware how disgracefully Authors of Eminence
have been often treated, by an indiscreet posthumous pub∣lication
of fragments and careless effusions; when I had
selected those Papers which to myself appeared the fittest
for the public eye, I consulted some of our common
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
friends, whom I knew to be equally anxious with myself
for Mr. Gibbon's fame, and fully competent, from their
judgment, to protect it.</P>
<P>Under such a sanction it is, that, no longer suspecting
myself to view through too favourable a medium the
compositions of my Friend, I now venture to publish
them: and it may here be proper to give some informa∣tion
to the Reader, respecting the Contents of these
Volumes.</P>
<P>The most important part consists of Memoirs of Mr.
Gibbon's Life and Writings, a work which he seems
to have projected with peculiar solicitude and atten∣tion,
and of which he left Six different sketches, all
in his own hand-writing. One of these sketches, the
most diffuse and circumstantial, so far as it proceeds,
ends at the time when he quitted Oxford. Another
at the year 1764, when he travelled to Italy. A
third, at his father's death, in 1770. A fourth, which
he continued to a short time after his return to Lau∣sanne
in 1788, appears in the form of Annals, much
less detailed than the others. The two remaining sketches
are still more imperfect. It is difficult to discover the
order in which these several Pieces were written, but
there is reason to believe that the most copious was the
last. From all these the following Memoirs have been
carefully selected, and put together.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5"/>
My hesitation in giving these Memoirs to the world
arose, principally, from the circumstance of Mr.
Gibbon's appearing, in some respect, not to have been
satisfied with them, as he had so frequently varied
their form: yet, notwithstanding this diffidence, the
compositions, though unfinished, are so excellent, that
they may justly entitle my Friend to appear as his
own biographer, rather than to have that task under∣taken
by any other person less qualified for it.</P>
<P>This opinion has rendered me anxious to publish the
present Memoirs, without any unnecessary delay; for I
am persuaded, that the Author of them cannot be made
to appear in a truer light than he does in the following
pages. In them, and in his different Letters, which
I have added, will be found a complete picture of
his talents, his disposition, his studies, and his attain∣ments.</P>
<P>Those slight variations of character, which naturally
arose in the progress of his Life, will be unfolded in a
series of Letters, selected from a Correspondence between
him and myself, which continued full thirty years, and
ended with his death.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that all the sketches of the Me∣moirs,
except that composed in the form of Annals, and
which seems rather designed as heads for a future Work,
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
cease about twenty years before Mr. Gibbon's death;
and consequently, that we have the least detailed ac∣count
of the most interesting part of his Life. His Cor∣respondence
during that period will, in great measure,
supply the deficiency. It will be separated from the
Memoirs and placed in an Appendix, that those
who are not disposed to be pleased with the repeti∣tions,
familiarities, and trivial circumstances of episto∣lary
writing, may not be embarrassed by it. By many,
the Letters will be found a very interesting part
of the present Publication. They will prove, how
pleasant, friendly, and amiable Mr. Gibbon was in
private life; and if, in publishing Letters so flatter∣ing
to myself, I incur the imputation of vanity, I
shall meet the charge with a frank confession, that
I am indeed highly vain of having enjoyed, for so
many years, the esteem, the confidence, and the affec∣tion
of a man, whose social qualities endeared him to
the most accomplished society, and whose talents, great
as they were, must be acknowledged to have been fully
equalled by the sincerity of his friendship.</P>
<P>Whatever censure may be pointed against the
Editor, the Public will set a due value on the Let∣ters
for their intrinsic merit. I must, indeed, be
blinded, either by vanity or affection, if they do
not display the heart and mind of their Author, in
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
such a manner as justly to increase the number of his
admirers.</P>
<P>I have not been solicitous to garble or expunge passages
which, to some, may appear trifling. Such passages will
often, in the opinion of the observing Reader, mark the
character of the Writer, and the omission of them would
materially take from the ease and familiarity of authentic
letters.</P>
<P>Few men, I believe, have ever so fully unveiled their
own character, by a minute narrative of their sentiments
and pursuits, as Mr. Gibbon will here be found to have
done; not with study and labour—not with an affected
frankness—but with a genuine confession of his little
foibles and peculiarities, and a good-humoured and na∣tural
display of his own conduct and opinions.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon began a Journal, a work distinct from
the sketches already mentioned, in the early part of his
Life, with the following declaration:</P>
<P><Q>I propose from this day, August 24th 1761, to
keep an exact Journal of my actions and studies, both
to assist my memory, and to accustom me to set a due
value on my time. I shall begin by setting down
some few events of my past life, the dates of which
I can remember.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
This industrious project he pursued occasionally in
French, under various titles, and with the minuteness,
fidelity, and liberality of a mind resolved to watch over
and improve itself.</P>
<P>The Journal is continued under different titles, and
is sometimes very concise, and sometimes singularly de∣tailed.
One part of it is entitled "My Journal," ano∣ther
"Ephemerides, or Journal of my Actions, Studies,
and Opinions." The other parts are entitled, "Ephe∣merides,
ou Journal de ma Vie, de mes Etudes, et de
mes Sentimens." In this Journal, among the most tri∣vial
circumstances, are mixed very interesting observations
and dissertations on a Satire of Juvenal, a Passage of
Homer, or of Longinus, or of any other author whose
works he happened to read in the course of the day; and
he often passes from a Remark on the most common
event, to a critical Disquisition of considerable learning,
or an Enquiry into some abstruse point of Philosophy.</P>
<P>It certainly was not his intention that this private and
motley Diary should be presented to the Public; nor
have I thought myself at liberty to present it, in the
shape in which he left it. But by reducing it to an ac∣count
of <HI>his literary occupations,</HI> it formed so singular
and so interesting a portrait of an indefatigable Stu∣dent,
that I persuade myself it will be regarded as a
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
valuable acquisition by the Literary World, and as an ac∣cession
of fame to the memory of my Friend. With the
Extracts from Mr. Gibbon's Journal will be printed,
his Dissertations entitled "Extraits raisonnés de mes
Lectures:" and "Recueil de mes Observations, et
Pieces détachées sur différens Sujets." A few other
passages from other parts of the Journals, introduced
in Notes, will make a curious addition to the Memoirs.</P>
<P>His First Publication, "Essai sur l'Etude de la
Litterature," with corrections and additions from an
interleaved copy which my Friend gave to me several
years ago, is reprinted as part of these volumes.</P>
<P>Three more of his smaller Publications are also re∣printed.
1. His masterly Criticism on the Sixth Book
of Virgil, in answer to Bishop Warburton. 2. His
own Vindication of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters
of his History, in answer to Mr. Davis and others. And
3. His "Reponse à l'Exposé de la Cour de France,"—an
occasional composition, which obtained the highest ap∣plause
in Foreign Courts, and of which he spoke to me
with some pleasure, observing that it had been trans∣lated
even into the Turkish language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Petersburgh and Vienna it was currently observed by the Corps Diplomatique, that the English Ministry had published a Memorial written not only with great ability, but also in French, so correct, that they must have employed a Frenchman.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of these various writings the Author has spoken him∣self,
in describing his own Life. I have yet to notice
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
some articles not mentioned in his Memoirs, and which
will be found in this Publication. 1. A juvenile sketch,
entitled, "Outlines of the History of the World."
2. A Dissertation, which he had shewn to a few friends,
on that curious subject, "L'Homme au Masque de Fer."
3. A more considerable work, "The Antiquities of the
House of Brunswick;" an historical discourse, com∣posed
about the year 1790. In this Work he intended
to appropriate separate books: 1. To the Italian descent;
2. To the Germanic reign: and, 3. To the British Suc∣cession
of the House of Brunswick. The Manuscript
closes in completing the Italian branch of his subject.</P>
<P>Among the most splendid passages of that unfi∣nished
work may be enumerated, the characters of Leib∣nitz
and Muratori: A sketch of Albert-Azo the Second,
a prince who retained his faculties and reputation
beyond the age of one hundred years: An account
of Padua and its university, and remarks on the epic
glory of Ferrara.</P>
<P>The last Paper of these Volumes has the mournful at∣traction
of being a sketch interrupted by death, and affords
an honourable proof that my Friend's ardour for the pro∣motion
of historical knowledge attended him to the last.
It is entitled merely, "An Address;" and expresses a
wish that our Latin memorials of the middle ages, the
"Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum," may be published in
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
England, in a manner worthy of the subject, and of the
country. He mentions Mr. John Pinkerton as a person
well qualified for the conduct of such a national under∣taking.</P>
<P>In the collection of writings which I am now send∣ing
to the press, there is no article that will so much
engage the public attention as the Memoirs. I will
therefore close all I mean to say as their Editor, by
assuring the Reader, that, although I have in some
measure newly arranged those interesting Papers, by
forming one regular narrative from the Six different
sketches, I have nevertheless adhered with scrupulous
fidelity to the very words of their Author; and I use
the letter S. to mark such Notes of my own, as it seemed
necessary to add.</P>
<P>It remains only to express a wish, that in discharging
this latest office of affection, my regard to the memory of
my Friend may appear, as I trust it will do, proportioned
to the high satisfaction which I enjoyed for many years in
possessing his entire confidence, and very partial attach∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF
MY LIFE AND WRITINGS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fifty-second year of my age, after the completion of an
arduous and successful work, I now propose to employ some
moments of my leisure in reviewing the simple transactions of a
private and literary life. Truth, naked, unblushing truth, the first
virtue of more serious history, must be the sole recommendation of
this personal narrative. The style shall be simple and familiar: but
style is the image of character; and the habits of correct writing
may produce, without labour or design, the appearance of art and
study. My own amusement is my motive, and will be my reward:
and if these sheets are communicated to some discreet and indulgent
friends, they will be secreted from the public eye till the author shall
be removed beyond the reach of criticism or ridicule<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This passage is found in one only of the six sketches, and in that which seems to have been the first written, and which was laid aside among loose papers. Mr. Gibbon, in his communications with me on the subject of his Memoirs, a subject which he had never mentioned to any other person, expressed a determination of publishing them in his lifetime; and never appears to have departed from that resolution, excepting in one of his letters annexed, in which he intimates a doubt, though rather carelessly, whether in his time, or at any time, they would meet the eye of the public.—In a conversation, however, not long before his death, it was suggested to him, that, if he should make them a full image of his mind, he would not have nerves to publish them in his lifetime, and therefore that they should be posthumous;—He answered, rather eagerly, that he was determined to publish them <HI>in his lifetime.</HI> S.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="27"/>
A lively desire of knowing and of recording our ancestors so gene∣rally
prevails, that it must depend on the influence of some common
principle in the minds of men. We seem to have lived in the per∣sons
of our forefathers; it is the labour and reward of vanity to ex∣tend
the term of this ideal longevity. Our imagination is always
active to enlarge the narrow circle in which Nature has confined us.
Fifty or an hundred years may be allotted to an individual, but we
step forwards beyond death with such hopes as religion and philo∣sophy
will suggest; and we fill up the silent vacancy that precedes
our birth, by associating ourselves to the authors of our existence.
Our calmer judgment will rather tend to moderate, than to suppress,
the pride of an antient and worthy race. The satyrist may laugh,
the philosopher may preach; but Reason herself will respect the pre∣judices
and habits, which have been consecrated by the experience of
mankind.</P>
<P>Wherever the distinction of birth is allowed to form a superior
order in the state, education and example should always, and will
often, produce among them a dignity of sentiment and propriety of
conduct, which is guarded from dishonour by their own and the
public esteem. If we read of some illustrious line so antient that it
has no beginning, so worthy that it ought to have no end, we sym∣pathize
in its various fortunes; nor can we blame the generous en∣thusiasm,
or even the harmless vanity, of those who are allied to
the honours of its name. For my own part, could I draw my pedi∣gree
from a general, a statesman, or a celebrated author, I should
study their lives with the diligence of filial love. In the investiga∣tion
of past events, our curiosity is stimulated by the immediate or
indirect reference to ourselves; but in the estimate of honour we
should learn to value the gifts of Nature above those of Fortune; to
esteem in our ancestors the qualities that best promote the interests of
society; and to pronounce the descendant of a king less truly noble
than the offspring of a man of genius, whose writings will instruct
<PB N="3" REF="28"/>
or delight the latest posterity. The family of Confucius is, in my
opinion, the most illustrious in the world. After a painful ascent of
eight or ten centuries, our barons and princes of Europe are lost in
the darkness of the middle ages; but, in the vast equality of the em∣pire
of China, the posterity of Confucius have maintained, above two
thousand two hundred years, their peaceful honours and perpetual
succession. The chief of the family is still revered, by the sovereign
and the people, as the lively image of the wisest of mankind. The
nobility of the Spencers has been illustrated and enriched by the tro∣phies
of Marlborough; but I exhort them to consider the <HI>Fairy Queen</HI>
as the most precious jewel of their coronet. I have exposed my pri∣vate
feelings, as I shall always do, without scruple or reserve. That
these sentiments are just, or at least natural, I am inclined to believe,
since I do not feel myself interested in the cause; for I can derive
from my ancestors neither glory nor shame.</P>
<P>Yet a sincere and simple narrative of my own life may amuse some
of my leisure hours; but it will subject me, and perhaps with justice,
to the imputation of vanity. I may judge, however, from the ex∣perience
both of past and of the present times, that the public are
always curious to know the men, who have left behind them any
image of their minds: the most scanty accounts of such men are
compiled with diligence, and perused with eagerness; and the student
of every class may derive a lesson, or an example, from the lives most
similar to his own. My name may hereafter be placed among the
thousand articles of a Biographia Britannica; and I must be conscious,
that no one is so well qualified, as myself, to describe the series of my
thoughts and actions. The authority of my masters, of the grave
Thuanus, and the philosophic Hume, might be sufficient to justify
my design; but it would not be difficult to produce a long list of
antients and moderns, who, in various forms, have exhibited their
own portraits. Such portraits are often the most interesting, and
sometimes the only interesting parts of their writings; and, if they
<PB N="4" REF="29"/>
be sincere, we seldom complain of the minuteness or prolixity of
these personal memorials. The lives of the younger Pliny, of Pe∣trarch,
and of Erasmus, are expressed in the epistles, which they
themselves have given to the world. The essays of Montagne and
Sir William Temple bring us home to the houses and bosoms of the
authors: we smile without contempt at the headstrong passions of
Benevenuto Cellini, and the gay follies of Colley Cibber. The con∣fessions
of St. Austin and Rousseau disclose the secrets of the human
heart: the commentaries of the learned Huet have survived his evan∣gelical
demonstration; and the memoirs of Goldoni are more truly
dramatic than his Italian comedies. The heretic and the churchman
are strongly marked in the characters and fortunes of Whiston and
Bishop Newton; and even the dullness of Michael de Marolles and
Anthony Wood acquires some value from the faithful representation
of men and manners. That I am equal or superior to some of these,
the effects of modesty or affectation cannot force me to dissemble.</P>
<P>MY family is originally derived from the county of Kent. The
southern district, which borders on Sussex and the sea, was formerly
overspread with the great forest Anderida, and even now retains the
denomination of the <HI>Weald,</HI> or Woodland. In this district, and in the
hundred and parish of Rolvenden, the Gibbons, were possessed of
lands in the year one thousand three hundred and twenty-six; and
the elder branch of the family, without much increase or diminution
of property, still adheres to its native soil. Fourteen years after the
first appearance of his name, John Gibbon is recorded as the Mar∣morarius
or architect of King Edward the Third: the strong and
stately castle of Queensborough, which guarded the entrance of the
Medway, was a monument of his skill; and the grant of an here∣ditary
toll on the passage from Sandwich to Stonar, in the Isle of
<PB N="5" REF="30"/>
Thanet, is the reward of no vulgar artist. In the visitations of the
heralds, the Gibbons are frequently mentioned: they held the rank
of Esquire in an age, when that title was less promiscuously assumed:
one of them, under the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was captain of the
militia of Kent; and a free school, in the neighbouring town of Be∣nenden,
proclaims the charity and opulence of its founder. But time,
or their own obscurity, has cast a veil of oblivion over the virtues
and vices of my Kentish ancestors; their character or station confined
them to the labours and pleasures of a rural life: nor is it in my power
to follow the advice of the Poet, in an inquiry after a name—
<Q><L>"Go! search it there, where to be born, and die,</L>
<L>"Of rich and poor makes all the history."</L></Q>
So recent is the institution of our parish registers. In the beginning
of the seventeenth century, a younger branch of the Gibbons of Rol∣venden
migrated from the country to the city; and from this branch
I do not blush to descend. The law requires some abilities; the
church imposes some restraints; and before our army and navy, our
civil establishments, and India empire, had opened so many paths of
fortune, the mercantile profession was more frequently chosen by
youths of a liberal race and education, who aspired to create their
own independence. Our most respectable families have not dis∣dained
the counting-house, or even the shop; their names are in∣rolled
in the Livery and Companies of London; and in England,
as well as in the Italian commonwealths, heralds have been com∣pelled
to declare, that gentility is not degraded by the exercise of
trade.</P>
<P>The armorial ensigns which, in the times of chivalry, adorned the
crest and shield of the soldier, are now become an empty decoration,
which every man, who has money to build a carriage, may paint ac∣cording
to his fancy on the pannels. My family arms are the same,
which were borne by the Gibbons of Kent in an age, when the
College of Heralds religiously guarded the distinctions of blood and
<PB N="6" REF="31"/>
name: a lion rampant gardant, between three schallop-shells Argent,
on a field Azure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The father of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke married an heiress of this family of Gibbon. The Chancellor's escutcheon in the Temple Hall quarters the arms of Gibbon, as does also that, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, of Charles York, Chancellor in 1770. S.</NOTE>. I should not however have been tempted to
blazon my coat of arms, were it not connected with a whimsical
anecdote.—About the reign of James the First, the three harmless
schallop-shells were changed by Edmund Gibbon esq. into three
<HI>Ogresses,</HI> or female cannibals, with a design of stigmatizing three
ladies, his kinswomen, who had provoked him by an unjust law-suit.
But this singular mode of revenge, for which he obtained the sanction
of Sir William Seagar, king at arms, soon expired with its author;
and, on his own monument in the Temple church, the monsters
vanish, and the three schallop-shells resume their proper and heredi∣tary
place.</P>
<P>Our alliances by marriage it is not disgraceful to mention. The
chief honour of my ancestry is James Fiens, Baron Say and Seale,
and Lord High Treasurer of England, in the reign of Henry the
Sixth; from whom by the Phelips, the Whetnalls, and the Cromers,
I am lineally descended in the eleventh degree. His dismission and
imprisonment in the Tower were insufficient to appease the popular
clamour; and the Treasurer, with his son-in-law Cromer, was be∣headed
(1450), after a mock trial by the Kentish insurgents. The
black list of his offences, as it is exhibited in Shakespeare, displays
the ignorance and envy of a plebeian tyrant. Besides the vague
reproaches of selling Maine and Normandy to the Dauphin, the
Treasurer is specially accused of luxury, for riding on a foot-cloth;
and of treason, for speaking French, the language of our enemies:
<Q>Thou hast most traiterously corrupted the youth of the realm,</Q> says
Jack Cade to the unfortunate Lord, <Q>in erecting a grammar-school;
and whereas before our forefathers had no other books than the
score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be used; and,
<PB N="7" REF="32"/>
contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou hast built a
paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face, that thou hast men
about thee, who usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abo∣minable
words, as no christian ear can endure to hear.</Q> Our dra∣matic
poet is generally more attentive to character than to history;
and I much fear that the art of printing was not introduced into
England, till several years after Lord Say's death: but of some of
these meritorious crimes I should hope to find my ancestor guilty;
and a man of letters may be proud of his descent from a patron and
martyr of learning.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the last century Robert Gibbon esq. of Rol∣venden
in Kent, (who died in 1618,) had a son of the same name of
Robert, who settled in London, and became a member of the Cloth-workers'
Company. His wife was a daughter of the Edgars, who
flourished about four hundred years in the county of Suffolk, and
produced an eminent and wealthy serjeant-at-law, Sir Gregory Edgar,
in the reign of Henry the Seventh. Of the sons of Robert Gibbon,
(who died in 1643,) Matthew did not aspire above the station of a
linen-draper in Leadenhall-street; but John has given to the public
some curious memorials of his existence, his character, and his family.
He was born on the 3d of November in the year 1629; his education
was liberal, at a grammar-school, and afterwards in Jesus College at
Cambridge; and he celebrates the retired content which he enjoyed
at Allesborough in Worcestershire, in the house of Thomas Lord Co∣ventry,
where John Gibbon was employed as a domestic tutor, the
same office which Mr. Hobbes exercised in the Devonshire family.
But the spirit of my kinsman soon immerged into more active life:
he visited foreign countries as a soldier and a traveller, acquired the
knowledge of the French and Spanish languages, passed some time
in the Isle of Jersey, crossed the Atlantic, and resided upwards of a
twelvemonth (1659) in the rising colony of Virginia. In this remote
province, his taste, or rather passion, for heraldry found a singular
<PB N="8" REF="33"/>
gratification at a war-dance of the native Indians. As they moved
in measured steps, brandishing their tomahawks, his curious eye con∣templated
their little shields of bark, and their naked bodies, which
were painted with the colours and symbols of his favourite science.
<Q>At which I exceedingly wondered; and concluded that heraldry
was ingrafted <HI>naturally</HI> into the sense of human race. If so, it
deserves a greater esteem than now-a-days is put upon it.</Q> His
return to England after the Restoration was soon followed by his
marraige—his settlement in a house in St. Catherine's Cloyster, near
the Tower, which devolved to my grandfather—and his introduc∣tion
into the Heralds' College (in 1671) by the style and title of
Blue-mantle Pursuivant at Arms. In this office he enjoyed near fifty
years the rare felicity of uniting, in the same pursuit, his duty and
inclination: his name is remembered in the College, and many of
his letters are still preserved. Several of the most respectable cha∣racters
of the age, Sir William Dugdale, Mr. Ashmole, Dr. John
Betts, and Dr. Nehemiah Grew, were his friends; and in the society
of such men, John Gibbon may be recorded without disgrace as the
member of an astrological club. The study of hereditary honours is
favourable to the Royal prerogative; and my kinsman, like most of
his family, was a high Tory both in church and state. In the latter
end of the reign of Charles the Second, his pen was exercised in the
cause of the Duke of York: the Republican faction he most cordially
detested; and as each animal is conscious of its proper arms, the
heralds' revenge was emblazoned on a most diabolical escutcheon.
But the triumph of the Whig government checked the preferment
of Blue-mantle; and he was even suspended from his office, till his
tongue could learn to pronounce the oath of abjuration. His life
was prolonged to the age of ninety; and, in the expectation of the
inevitable though uncertain hour, he wishes to preserve the blessings
of health, competence, and virtue. In the year 1682 he published
at London his <HI>Introductio ad Latinam Blafoniam,</HI> an original attempt,
<PB N="9" REF="34"/>
which Camden had desiderated, to define, in a Roman idiom, the
terms and attributes of a Gothic institution. It is not two years
since I acquired, in a foreign land, some domestic intelligence of my
own family; and this intelligence was conveyed to Switzerland from
the heart of Germany. I had formed an acquaintance with Mr.
<HI>Langer,</HI> a lively and ingenious scholar, while he resided at Lausanne
as preceptor to the Hereditary Prince of <HI>Brunswick.</HI> On his return
to his proper station of Librarian to the Ducal Library of Wolfen∣buttel,
he accidentally found among some literary rubbish a small old
English volume of heraldry, inscribed with the name of <HI>John Gibbon.</HI>
From the title only Mr. <HI>Langer</HI> judged that it might be an acceptable
present to his friend; and he judged rightly. His manner is quaint
and affected; his order is confused; but he displays some wit, more
reading, and still more enthusiasm; and if an enthusiast be often ab∣surd,
he is never languid. An English text is perpetually inter∣spersed
with Latin sentences in prose and verse; but in his own
poetry he claims an exemption from the laws of prosody. Amidst a
profusion of genealogical knowledge, my kinsman could not be for∣getful
of his own name; and to him I am indebted for almost the
whole of my information concerning the Gibbon family. From this
small work (a duodecimo of one hundred and sixty-five pages) the
author expected immortal fame: and at the conclusion of his labour
he sings, in a strain of self-exultation;</P>
<LG>
<L>"Usque huc corrigitur Romana Blasonia per me;</L>
<L>"Verborumque dehinc barbara forma cadat.</L>
<L>"Hic liber, in meritum si forsitan incidet usum,</L>
<L>"Testis rite meae sedulitatis erit.</L>
<L>"Quicquid agat Zoilus, ventura fatebitur aetas</L>
<L>"Artis quôd fueram non Clypearis inops."</L>
</LG>
<P>Such are the hopes of authors! In the failure of those hopes John
Gibbon has not been the first of his profession, and very possibly
may not be the last of his name. His brother Matthew Gibbon, the
<PB N="10" REF="35"/>
draper, had one daughter and two sons—my grandfather Edward,
who was born in the year 1666, and Thomas, afterwards Dean of
Carlisle. According to the mercantile creed, that the best book is a
profitable ledger, the writings of John the herald would be much less
precious, than those of his nephew Edward: but an author professes
at least to write for the public benefit; and the slow balance of trade
can be pleasing to those persons only, to whom it is advantageous.
The successful industry of my grandfather raised him above the level
of his immediate ancestors; he appears to have launched into various
and extensive dealings: even his opinions were subordinate to his
interest; and I find him in Flanders clothing King William's troops,
while he would have contracted with more pleasure, though not per∣haps
at a cheaper rate, for the service of King James. During his
residence abroad, his concerns at home were managed by his mother
Hester, an active and notable woman. Her second husband was a
widower, of the name of Acton: they united the children of their
first nuptials. After his marriage with the daughter of Richard
Acton, goldsmith in Leadenhall-street, he gave his own sister to Sir
Whitmore Acton, of Aldenham; and I am thus connected, by a
triple alliance, with that ancient and loyal family of Shropshire ba∣ronets.
It consisted about that time of seven brothers, all of gigan∣tic
stature; one of whom, a pigmy of six feet two inches, confessed
himself the last and least of the seven; adding, in the true spirit of
party, that such men were not born since the Revolution. Under
the Tory administration of the four last years of Queen Anne
(1710—1714) Mr. Edward Gibbon was appointed one of the Com∣missioners
of the Customs; he sat at that Board with Prior: but the
merchant was better qualified for his station than the poet; since Lord
Bolingbroke has been heard to declare, that he had never conversed
with a man, who more clearly understood the commerce and finances
of England. In the year 1716 he was elected one of the Directors
of the South Sea Company; and his books exhibited the proof that,
<PB N="11" REF="36"/>
before his acceptance of this fatal office, he had acquired an inde∣pendent
fortune of sixty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>But his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year
twenty, and the labours of thirty years were blasted in a single day.
Of the use or abuse of the South Sea scheme, of the guilt or inno∣cence
of my grandfather and his brother Directors, I am neither a
competent nor a disinterested judge. Yet the equity of modern times
must condemn the violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would
have disgraced the cause of justice, and would render injustice still
more odious. No sooner had the nation awakened from its golden
dream, than a popular and even a parliamentary clamour demanded
their victims: but it was acknolwedged on all sides that the South
Sea Directors, however guilty, could not be touched by any known
laws of the lands. The speech of Lord Molesworth, the author of the
State of Denmark, may shew the temper, or rather the intemperance,
of the House of Commons. <Q>Extraordinary crimes (exclaimed that
ardent Whig) call aloud for extraordinary remedies. The Roman
lawgivers had not foreseen the possible existence of a parricide:
but as soon as the first monster appeared, he was sown in a sack, and
cast headlong into the river; and I shall be content to inflict the
same treatment on the authors of our present ruin.</Q> His motion
was not literally adopted; but a bill of pains and penalties was intro∣duced,
a retroactive statute, to punish the offences, which did not
exist at the time they were committed. Such a pernicious violation
of liberty and law can be excused only by the most imperious neces∣sity;
nor could it be defended on this occasion by the plea of impend∣ing
danger or useful example. The legislature restrained the persons
of the Directors, imposed an exorbitant security for their appearance,
and marked their characters with a previous note of ignominy: they
were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the strict value of their estates;
and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any
part of their property. Against a bill of pains and penalties it is the
<PB N="12" REF="37"/>
common right of every subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar:
they prayed to be heard; their prayer was refused; and their op∣pressors,
who required no evidence, would listen to no defence. It
had been at first proposed that one-eighth of their respective estates
should be allowed for the future support of the Directors; but it was
speciously urged, that in the various shades of opulence and guilt such
an unequal proportion would be too light for many, and for some
might possibly be too heavy. The character and conduct of each
man were separately weighed; but, instead of the calm solemnity of
a judicial inquiry, the fortune and honour of three and thirty Eng∣lishmen
were made the topic of hasty conversation, the sport of a
lawless majority; and the basest member of the committee, by a ma∣licious
word or a silent vote, might indulge his general spleen or per∣sonal
animosity. Injury was aggravated by insult, and insult was em∣bittered
by pleasantry. Allowances of twenty pounds, or one shilling,
were facetiously moved. A vague report that a Director had for∣merly
been concerned in <HI>another</HI> project, by which some unknown
persons had lost their money, was admitted as a proof of his actual
guilt. One man was ruined because he had dropt a foolish speech, that
his horses should feed upon gold; another because he was grown so
proud, that, one day at the Treasury, he had refused a civil answer
to persons much above him. All were condemned, absent and un∣heard,
in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which swept away the greatest
part of their substance. Such bold oppression can scarcely be shielded
by the omnipotence of parliament: and yet it may be seriously
questioned, whether the Judges of the South Sea Directors were the
true and legal representatives of their country. The first parliament
of George the First had been chosen (1715) for thre years: the
term had elapsed, their trust was expired; and the four additional
years (1718—1722), during which they continued to sit, were de∣rived
not from the people, but from themselves; from the strong
measure of the septennial bill, which can only be paralleled by <HI>il serar
<PB N="13" REF="38"/>
di consiglio</HI> of the Venetian history. Yet candour will own that to the
same parliament every Englishman is deeply indebted: the septennial
act, so vicious in its origin, has been sanctioned by time, experience,
and the national consent. Its first operation secured the House of
Hanover on the throne, and its permanent influence maintains the
peace and stability of government. As often as a repeal has been
moved in the House of Commons, I have given in its defence a clear
and conscientious vote.</P>
<P>My grandfather could not expect to be treated with more lenity
than his companions. His Tory principles and connections rendered
him obnoxious to the ruling powers: his name is reported in a sus∣picious
secret; and his well-known abilities could not plead the ex∣cuse
of ignorance or error. In the first proceedings against the South
Sea Directors, Mr. Gibbon is one of the few who were taken into
custody; and, in the final sentence, the measure of his fine proclaims
him eminently guilty. The total estimate which he delivered on
oath to the House of Commons amounted to one hundred and six
thousand five hundred and forty-three pounds five shillings and six∣pence,
exclusive of antecedent settlements. Two different allow∣ances
of fifteen and of ten thousand pounds were moved for Mr.
Gibbon; but, on the question being put, it was carried without a
division for the smaller sum. On these ruins, with the skill and
credit, of which parliament had not been able to despoil him, my
grandfather at a mature age erected the edifice of a new fortune:
the labours of sixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have reason
to believe that the second structure was not much inferior to the first.
He had realized a very considerable property in Sussex, Hampshire,
Buckinghamshire, and the New River Company; and had acquired
a spacious house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since inhabited by Mr. Wood, Sir John Shelley, the Duke of Norfolk, &amp;c. S.</NOTE>, with gardens and lands, at Putney, in Surry,
where he resided in decent hospitality. He died in December 1736,
<PB N="14" REF="39"/>
at the age of seventy; and by his last will, at the expence of Edward,
his only son, (with whose marriage he was not perfectly reconciled,)
enriched his two daughters, Catherine and Hester. The former became
the wife of Mr. Edward Elliston, an East India captain: their daugh∣ter
and heiress Catherine was married in the year 1756 to Edward
Eliot esq. (now Lord Eliot), of Port Eliot, in the county of Cornwall;
and their three sons are my nearest male relations on the father's
side. A life of devotion and celibacy was the choice of my aunt, Mrs.
Hester Gibbon, who, at the age of eighty-five, still resides in a her∣mitage
at Cliffe, in Northamptonshire; having long survived her
spiritual guide and faithful companion Mr. William Law, who, at
an advanced age, about the year 1761, died in her house. In our
family he had left the reputation of a worthy and pious man, who
believed all that he professed, and practised all that he enjoined.
The character of a nonjuror, which he maintained to the last, is a
sufficient evidence of his principles in church and state; and the sa∣crifice
of interest to consicence will be always respectable. His the∣ological
writings, which our domestic connection has tempted me to
peruse, preserve an imperfect sort of life, and I can pronounce with
more confidence and knowledge on the merits of the author. His
last compositions are darkly tinctured by the incomprehensible visions
of Jacob Behmen; and his discourse on the absolute unlawfulness of
stage-entertainments is sometimes quoted for a ridiculous intempe∣rance
of sentiment and language.—<Q>The actors and spectators must
all be damned: the playhouse is the porch of Hell, the place of
the Devil's abode, where he holds his filthy court of evil spirits: a
play is the Devil's triumph, a sacrifice performed to his glory, as much
as in the heathen temples of Bacchus or Venus, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> But
these sallies of religious phrensy must not extinguish the praise, which
is due to Mr. William Law as a wit and a scholar. His argument
on topics of less absurdity is specious and acute, his manner is lively,
his style forcible and clear; and, had not his vigorous mind been
<PB N="15" REF="40"/>
clouded by enthusiasm, he might be ranked with the most agreeable
and ingenious writers of the times. While the Bangorian controversy
was a fashionable theme, he entered the lists on the subject of Christ's
kingdom, and the authority of the priesthood: against the plain ac∣count
of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper he resumed the com∣bat
with Bishop Hoadley, the object of Whig idolatry, and Tory ab∣horrence;
and at every weapon of attack and defence the nonjuror,
on the ground which is common to both, approves himself at least
equal to the prelate. On the appearance of the Fable of the Bees, he
drew his pen against the licentious doctrine that private vices are
public benefits, and morality as well as religion must join in his ap∣plause.
Mr. Law's master-work, the <HI>Serious Call,</HI> is still read as a
popular and powerful book of devotion. His precepts are rigid, but
they are founded on the gospel: his satire is sharp, but it is drawn
from the knowledge of human life; and many of his portraits are
not unworthy of the pen of La Bruyere. If he finds a spark of
piety in his reader's mind, he will soon kindle it to a flame; and a
philosopher must allow that he exposes, with equal severity and truth,
the strange contradiction between the faith and practice of the Chris∣tian
world. Under the names of Flavia and Miranda he has ad∣mirably
described my two aunts—the heathen and the christian
sister.</P>
<P>My father, Edward Gibbon, was born in October 1707: at the
age of thriteen he could scarcely feel that he was disinherited by act
of parliament; and, as he advanced towards manhood, new prospects
of fortune opened to his view. A parent is most attentive to supply
in his children the deficiencies, of which he is conscious in himself:
my grandfather's knowledge was derived from a strong under∣standing,
and the experience of the ways of men; but my father
enjoyed the benefits of a liberal education as a scholar and a gentle∣man.
At Westminster School, and afterwards at Emanuel College
in Cambridge, he passed through a regular course of academical dis∣cipline;
<PB N="16" REF="41"/>
and the care of his leanring and morals was entrusted to his
private tutor, the same Mr. William Law. But the mind of a saint
is above or below the present world; and while the pupil proceeded
on his travels, the tutor remained at Putney, the much-honoured
friend and spiritual director of the whole family. My father resided
some time at Paris to acquire the fashionable exercises; and as his
temper was warm and social, he indulged in those pleasures, for which
the strictness of his former education had given him a keener relish.
He afterwards visited several provinces of France; but his excursions
were neither long nor remote; and the slender knowledge, which he
had gained of the French language, was gradually obliterated. His
passage through Besançon is marked by a singular consequence in the
chain of human events. In a dangerous illness Mr. Gibbon was at∣tended,
at his own request, by one of his kinsmen of the name of
Acton, the younger brother of a younger brother, who had applied
himself to the study of physic. During the slow recovery of his pa∣tient,
the physician himself was attacked by the malady of love:
he married his mistress, renounced his country and religion, settled at
Besançon, and became the father of three sons; the eldest of whom,
General Acton, is conspicuous in Europe as the principal Minister of
the King of the Two Sicilies. By an uncle whom another stroke of
fortune had transplanted to Leghorn, he was educated in the naval
service of the Emperor; and his valour and conduct in the command
of the Tuscan frigates protected the retreat of the Spaniards from Al∣giers.
On my father's return to England he was chosen, in the
general election of 1734, to serve in parliament for the borough of
Petersfield; a burgage tenure, of which my grandfather possessed a
weighty share, till he alienated (I know not why) such important
property. In the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole and the Pelhams,
prejudice and society connected his son with the Tories,—shall I say
Jacobites? or, as they were pleased to style themselves, the country
gentlemen? with them he gave many a vote; with them he drank
<PB N="17" REF="42"/>
many a bottle. Without acquiring the fame of an orator or a states∣man,
he eagerly joined in the great opposition, which, after a seven
years chase, hunted down Sir Robert Walpole: and in the pursuit of an
unpopular minister, he gratified a private revenge against the oppressor
of his family in the South Sea persecution.</P>
<P>I was born at Putney, in the county of Surry, the 27th of April,
O. S. in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirty-seven; the
first child of the marriage of Edward Gibbon esq. and of Judith
Porten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The union to which I owe my birth was a marriage of inclination and esteem. Mr. James Porten, a merchant of London, resided with his family at Putney, in a house adjoining to the bridge and church-yard, where I have passed many happy hours of my childhood. He left one son (the late Sir Stanier Porten) and three daughters: Catherine, who preserved her maiden name, and of whom I shall hereafter speak; another daughter married Mr. Darrel of Richmond, and left two sons, Edward and Robert: the youngest of the three sisters was Judith, my mother.</NOTE>. My lot might have been that of a slave, a savage, or a
peasant; nor can I reflect without pleasure on the bounty of Nature,
which cast my birth in a free and civilized country, in an age of
science and philosophy, in a family of honourable rank, and decently
endowed with the gifts of fortune. From my birth I have enjoyed
the right of primogeniture; but I was succeeded by five brothers and
one sister, all of whom were snatched away in their infancy. My
five brothers, whose names may be found in the parish register of
Putney, I shall not pretend to lament: but from my childhood to
the present hour I have deeply and sincerely regretted my sister,
whose life was somewhat prolonged, and whom I remember to have
seen an amiable infant. The relation of a brother and a sister, espe∣cially
if they do not marry, appears to me of a very singular nature.
It is a familiar and tender friendship with a female, much about
our own age; an affection perhaps softened by the secret influence
of sex, but pure from any mixture of sensual desire, the sole species
of Platonic love that can be indulged with truth, and without
danger.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="43"/>
At the general election of 1741, Mr. Gibbon and Mr. Delmé stood
an expensive and successful contest at Southampton, against Mr. Dum∣mer
and Mr. Henly, afterwards Lord Chancellor and Earl of North∣ington.
The Whig candidates had a majority of the resident voters;
but the corporation was firm in the Tory interest: a sudden creation
of one hundred and seventy new freemen turned the scale; and a
supply was readily obtained of respectable volunteers, who flocked
from all parts of England to support the cause of their political friends.
The new parliament opened with the victory of an opposition, which
was fortified by strong clamour and strange coalitions. From the
event of the first divisions, Sir Robert Walpole perceived that he
could no longer lead a majority in the House of Commons, and pru∣dently
resigned (after a dominion of one and twenty years) the
guidance of the state (1742). But the fall of an unpopular minister
was not succeeded, according to general expectation, by a millenium
of happiness and virtue: some courtiers lost their places, some pa∣triots
lost their characters, Lord Orford's offences vanished with his
power; and after a short vibration, the Pelham government was fixed
on the old basis of the Whig aristocracy. In the year 1745, the
throne and the constitution were attacked by a rebellion, which does
not reflect much honour on the national spirit: since the English
friends of the Pretender wanted courage to join his standard, and his
enemies (the bulk of the people) allowed him to advance into the
heart of the kingdom. Without daring, perhaps without desiring,
to aid the rebels, my father invariably adhered to the Tory opposi∣tion.
In the most critical season he accepted, for the service of the
party, the office of alderman in the city of London: but the duties
were so repugnant to his inclination and habits, that he resigned his
gown at the end of a few months. The second parliament in which
he sat was prematurely dissolved (1747): and as he was unable or
unwilling to maintain a second contest for Southampton, the life of
the senator expired in that dissolution.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="44"/>
The death of a new-born child before that of its parents may seem
an unnatural, but it is strictly a probable, event: since of any given
number the greater part are extinguished before their ninth year,
before they possess the faculties of the mind or body. Without ac∣cusing
the profuse waste or imperfect workmanshiop of Nature, I shall
only observe, that this unfavourable chance was multiplied against my
infant existence. So feeble was my constitution, so precarious my
life, that, in the baptism of each of my brothers, my father's pru∣dence
successively repeated my christian name of Edward, that, in
case of the departure of the eldest son, this patronymick appellation
might be still perpetuated in the family.
<Q>—Uno avulso non deficit alter.</Q>
To preserve and to rear so frail a being, the most tender assiduity was
scarcely sufficient; and my mother's attention was somewhat diverted
by her frequent pregnancies, by an exclusive passion for her husband,
and by the dissipation of the world, in which his taste and authority
obliged her to mingle. But the maternal office was supplied by my
aunt, Mrs. Catherine Porten; at whose name I feel a tear of grati∣tude
trickling down my cheek. A life of celibacy transferred her
vacant affection to her sister's first child: my weakness excited her
pity; her attachment was fortified by labour and success: and if there
be any, as I trust there are some, who rejoice that I live, to that
dear and excellent woman they must hold themselves indebted.
Many anxious and solitary days did she consume in the patient trial
of every mode of relief and amusement. Many wakeful nights did
she sit by my bed-side in trembling expectation that each hour would
be my last. Of the various and frequent disorders of my childhood
my own recollection is dark; nor do I wish to expatiate on so dis∣gusting
a topic. Suffice it to say, that while every practitioner, from
Sloane and Ward to the Chevalier Taylor, was successively sum∣moned
to torture or relieve me, the care of my mind was too fre∣quently
neglected for that of my health: compassion always suggested
<PB N="20" REF="45"/>
an excuse for the indulgence of the master, or the idleness of the
pupil; and the chain of my education was broken, as often as I was
recalled from the school of learning to the bed of sickness.</P>
<P>As soon as the use of speech had prepared my infant reason for the
admission of knowledge, I was taught the arts of reading, writing,
and arithmetic. So remote is the date, so vague is the memory of
their origin in myself, that, were not the error corrected by analogy,
I should be tempted to conceive them as innate. In my childhood
I was praised for the readiness, with which I could multiply and di∣vide,
by memory alone, two sums of several figures: such praise en∣couraged
my growing talent; and had I persevered in this line of
application, I might have acquired some fame in mathematical
studies.</P>
<P>After this previous institution at home, or at a day-school at Put∣ney,
I was delivered at the age of seven into the hands of Mr. John
Kirkby, who exercised about eighteen months the office of my do∣mestic
tutor. His own words, which I shall here transcribe, inspire
in his favour a sentiment of pity and esteem.—<Q>During my abode
in my native county of Cumberland, in quality of an indigent
curate, I used now-and-then in a Summer, when the pleasantness
of the season invited, to take a solitary walk to the sea-shore, which
lies about two miles from the town where I lived. Here I would
amuse myself, one while in viewing at large the agreeable prospect
which surrounded me, and another while (confining my sight to
nearer objects) in admiring the vast variety of beautiful shells, thrown
upon the beach; some of the choicest of which I always picked up,
to divert my little ones upon my return. One time among the
rest, taking such a journey in my head, I sat down upon the de∣clivity
of the beach with my face to the sea, which was now come
up within a few yards of my feet; when immediately the sad
thoughts of the wretched condition of my family, and the un∣successfulness
of all endeavours to amend it, came crowding into
<PB N="21" REF="46"/>
my mind, which drove me into a deep melancholy, and ever and
anon forced tears from my eyes.</Q> Distress at last forced him to
leave the country. His learning and virtue introduced him to my
father; and at Putney he might have found at least a temporary
shelter, had not an act of indiscretion again driven him into the
world. One day reading prayers in the parish church, he most un∣luckily
forgot the name of King George: his patron, a loyal sub∣ject,
dismissed him with some reluctance, and a decent reward; and
<HI>how</HI> the poor man ended his days I have never been able to learn.
Mr. John Kirkby is the author of two small volumes; the Life of
Automathes (London, 1745), and an English and Latin Grammar
(London, 1746); which, as a testimony of gratitude, he dedicated
(November 5th, 1745) to my father. The books are before me:
from them the pupil may judge the preceptor; and, upon the whole,
his judgment will not be unfavourable. The grammar is executed
with accuracy and skill, and I know not whether any better existed
at the time in our language: but the life of Automathes aspires to
the honours of a philosophical fiction. It is the story of a youth, the
son of a shipwrecked exile, who lives alone on a desert island from
infancy to the age of manhood. A hind is his nurse; he inherits a
cottage, with many useful and curious instruments; some ideas re∣main
of the education of his two first years; some arts are bor∣rowed
from the beavers of a neighbouring lake; some truths are re∣vealed
in supernatural visions. With these helps, and his own in∣dustry,
Automathes becomes a self-taught thought speechless philoso∣pher,
who had investigated with success his own mind, the natural
world, the abstract sciences, and the great principles of morality and
religion. The author is not entitled to the merit of invention, since
he has blended the English story of Robinson Crusoe with the Ara∣bian
romance of Hai Ebn Yokhdan, which he might have read in the
Latin version of Pocock. In the Automathes I cannot praise either
the depth of thought or elegance of style; but the book is not devoid
<PB N="22" REF="47"/>
of entertainment or instruction; and among several interesting pas∣sages,
I would select the discovery of fire, which produces by acci∣dental
mischief the discovery of conscience. A man who had though
so much on the subjects of language and education was surely no or∣dinary
preceptor: my childish years, and his hasty departure, pre∣vented
me from enjoying the full benefit of his lessons; but they en∣larged
my knowledge of arithmetic, and left me a clear impression of
the English and Latin rudiments.</P>
<P>In my ninth year (January 1746), in a lucid interval of compa∣rative
health, my father adopted the convenient and customary mode
of English education; and I was sent to Kingston upon Thames, to
a school of about seventy boys, which was kept by Dr. Wooddeson
and his assistants. Every time I have since passed over Putney Com∣mon,
I have always noticed the spot where my mother, as we drove
along in the coach, admonished me that I was now going into the
world, and must learn to think and act for myself. The expression
may appear ludicrous; yet there is not, in the course of life, a more
remarkable change than the removal of a child from the luxury and
freedom of a wealthy house, to the frugal diet and strict subordina∣tion
of a school; from the tenderness of parents, and the obsequious∣ness
of servants, to the rude familiarity of his equals, the insolent ty∣ranny
of his seniors, and the rod, perhaps, of a cruel and capricious
pedagogue. Such hardships may steel the mind and body against the
injuries of fortune; but my timid reserve was astonished by the
crowd and tumult of the school; the want of strength and activity
disqualified me for the sports of the play-field; nor have I forgotten
how often in the year forty-six I was reviled and buffetted for the
sins of my Tory ancestors. By the common methods of discipline,
at the expence of many tears and some blood, I purchased the
knowledge of the Latin syntax: and not long since I was possessed
of the dirty volumes of Phaedrus and Cornelius Nepos, which I pain∣fully
construed and darkly understood. The choice of these authors
<PB N="23" REF="48"/>
is not injudicious. The <HI>lives</HI> of Cornelius Nepos, the friend of At∣ticus
and Cicero, are composed in the style of the purest age: his
simplicity is elegant, his brevity copious: he exhibits a series of men
and manners; and with such illustrations, as every pedant is not in∣deed
qualified to give, this classic biographer may initiate a young
student in the history of Greece and Rome. The use of fables or
apologues has been approved in every age from antient India to mo∣dern
Europe. They convey in familiar images the truths of morality
and prudence; and the most childish understanding (I advert to the
scruples of Rousseau) will not suppose either that beasts <HI>do</HI> speak, or
that men <HI>may</HI> lie. A fable represents the genuine characters of ani∣mals;
and skilful master might extract from Pliny and Buffon some
pleasing lessons of natural history, a science well adapted to the taste
and capacity of children. The Latinity of Phaedrus is not exempt
from an alloy of the silver age; but his manner is concise, terse, and
sententious: the Thracian slave discreetly breathes the spirit of a free∣man;
and when the text is found, the style is perspicuous. But his
fables, after a long oblivion, were first published by Peter Pithou,
from a corrupt manuscript. The labours of fifty editors confess the
defects of the copy, as well as the value of the original; and the
school-boy may have been whipt for misapprehending a passage,
which Bentley could not restore, and which Burman could not
explain.</P>
<P>My studies were too frequently interrupted by sickness; and after
a real or nominal residence at Kingston-school of near two years, I
was finally recalled (December 1747) by my mother's death, which
was occasioned, in her thirty-eighth year, by the consequences of
her last labour. I was too young to feel the importance of my loss;
and the image of her person and conversation is faintly imprinted in
my memory. The affectionate heart of my aunt, Catherine Porten,
bewailed a sister and a friend; but my poor father was inconsolable,
and the transport of grief seemed to threaten his life or his reason.
<PB N="24" REF="49"/>
I can never forget the seene of our first interview, some weeks after
the fatal event; the awful silence, the room hung with black, the
mid-day tapers, his sighs and tears; his praises of my mother, a saint
in heaven; his solemn adjuration that I would cherish her memory
and imitate her virtues; and the fervor with which he kissed and
blessed me as the sole surviving pledge of their loves. The storm of
passion insensibly subsided into calmer melancholy. At a convivial
meeting of his friends, Mr. Gibbon might affect or enjoy a gleam of
cheerfulness; but his plan of happiness was for ever destroyed: and
after the loss of his companion he was left alone in a world, of which
the business and pleasures were to him irksome or insipid. After
some unsuccessful trials he renounced the tumult of London and the
hospitality of Putney, and buried himself in the rural or rather rustic
solitude of Buriton; from which, during several years, he seldom
emerged.</P>
<P>As far back as I can remember, the house, near Putney-bridge and
church-yard, of my maternal grandfather appears in the light of my
prper and native home. It was there that I was allowed to spend
the greatest part of my time, in sickness or in health, during my
school vacations and my parents' residence in London, and finally
after my mother's death. Three months after that event, in the
spring of 1748, the commercial ruin of her father, Mr. James Por∣ten,
was accomplished and declared. He suddenly absconded: but as
his effects were not sold, nor the house evacuated, till the Christmas
following, I enjoyed during the whole year the society of my aunt,
without much consciousness of her impending fate. I feel a melan∣choly
pleasure in repeating my obligations to that excellent woman,
Mrs. Catherine Porten, the true mother of my mind as well as of
my health. Her natural good sense was improved by the perusal of
the best books in the English language; and if her reason was some∣times
clouded by prejudice, her sentiments were never disguised by
hypocrisy or affectation. Her indulgent tenderness, the frankness of
<PB N="25" REF="50"/>
her temper, and my innate rising curiosity, soon removed all distance
between us: like friends of an equal age, we freely conversed on
every topic, familiar or abstruse; and it was her delight and reward
to observe the first shoots of my young ideas. Pain and languor
were often soothed by the voice of instruction and amusement; and
to her kind lessons I ascribe my early and invincible love of read∣ing,
which I would not exchange for the treasures of India. I
should perhaps be astonished, were it possible to ascertain the date, at
which a favourite tale was engraved, by frequent repetition, in my
memory: the Cavern of the Winds; the Palace of Felicity; and the
fatal moment, at the end of three months or centuries, when Prince
Adolphus is overtaken by Time, who had worn out so many pair of
wings in the pursuit. Before I left Kingston school I was well ac∣quainted
with Pope's Homer and the Arabian Nights Entertainments,
two books which will always please by the moving picture of human
manners and specious miracles: nor was I then capable of discerning
that Pope's translation is a portrait endowed with every merit, except∣ing
that of likeness to the original. The verses of Pope accustomed my
ear to the sound of poetic harmony: in the death of Hector, and the
shipwreck of Ulysses, I tasted the new emotions of terror and pity; and
seriously disputed with my aunt on the vices and virtues of the heroes
of the Trojan war. From Pope's Homer to Dryden's Virgil was an
easy transition; but I know not how, from some fault in the author,
the translator, or the reader, the pious Aeneas did not so forcibly
seize on my imagination; and I derived more pleasure from Ovid's
Metamorphoses, especially in the fall of Phaeton, and the speeches of
Ajax and Ulysses. My grandfather's flight unlocked the door of a
tolerable library; and I turned over many English pages of poetry
and romance, of history and travels. Where a title attracted my eye,
without fear or awe I snatched the volume from the shelf; and Mrs.
Porten, who indulged herself in moral and religious speculations,
was more prone to encourage than to check a curiosity above the
<PB N="26" REF="51"/>
strength of a boy. This year (1748), the twelfth of my age, I shall
note as the most propitious to the growth of my intellectual statue.</P>
<P>The relies of my grandfather's fortune afforded a bare annuity for
his own maintenance; and his daughter, my worthy aunt, who had
already passed her fortieth year, was left destitute. Her noble spirit
scorned a life of obligation and dependence; and after revolving se∣veral
schemes, she preferred the humble industry of keeping a board∣ing-house
for Westminster-school<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said in the family, that she was principally induced to this undertaking by her affection for her nephew, whose weak constitution required her constant and unre∣mitted attention. S.</NOTE>, where she laboriously earned a
competence for her old age. This singular opportunity of blending
the advantages of private and public education decided my father.
After the Christmas holidays in January 1749, I accompanied Mrs.
Porten to her new house in College-street; and was immediately en∣tered
in the school, of which Dr. John Nicoll was at that time head∣master.
At first I was alone: but my aunt's resolution was praised;
her character was esteemed; her friends were numerous and active:
in the course of some years she became the mother of forty or fifty
boys, for the most part of family and fortune; and as her primitive
habitation was too narrow, she built and occupied a spacious man∣sion
in Dean's Yard. I shall always be ready to join in the common
opinion, that our public schools, which have produced so many emi∣nent
characters, are the best adapted to the genius and constitution
of the English people. A boy of spirit may acquire a previous and
practical experience of the world; and his playfellows may be the
future friends of his heart or his interest. In a free intercourse with
his equals, the habits of truth, fortitude, and prudence will insensibly
be matured. Birth and riches are measured by the standard of per∣sonal
merit; and the mimic scene of a rebellion has displayed, in
their true colours, the ministers and patriots of the rising generation.
Our seminaries of learning do not exactly correspond with the
<PB N="27" REF="52"/>
precept of a Spartan king, <Q>that the child should be instructed in the
arts, which will be useful to the man;</Q> since a finished scholar may
emerge from the head of Westminster or Eton, in total ignorance of
the business and conversation of English gentlemen in the latter end
of the eighteenth century. But these schools may assume the merit
of teaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek lan∣guages:
they deposit in the hands of a disciple the keys of two valu∣able
chests; nor can he complain, if they are afterwards lost or ne∣glected
by his own fault. The necessity of leading in equal ranks so
many unequal powers of capacity and application, will prolong to
eight or ten years the juvenile studies, which might be dispatched in
half that time by the skilful master of a single pupil. Yet even the
repetition of exercise and discipline contributes to fix in a vacant
mind the verbal science of grammar and prosody: and the private or
voluntary student, who possesses the sense and spirit of the classics, may
offend, by a false quantity, the scrupulous ear of a well-flogged critic.
For myself, I must be content with a very small share of the civil and
literary fruits of a public school. In the space of two years (1749,
1750), interrupted by danger and debility, I painfully climbed into
the third form; and my riper age was left to acquire the beauties of
the Latin, and the rudiments of the Greek tongue. Instead of auda∣ciously
mingling in the sports, the quarrels, and the connections of
our little world, I was still cherished at home under the maternal
wing of my aunt; and my removal from Westminster long preceded
the approach of manhood.</P>
<P>The violence and variety of my complaints, which had excused
my frequent absence from Westminster-school, at length engaged
Mrs. Porten, with the advice of physicians, to conduct me to Bath:
at the end of the Michaelmas vacation (1750) she quitted me with
reluctance, and I remained several months under the care of a trusty
maid-servant. A strange nervous affection, which alternately con∣tracted
my legs, and produced, without any visible symptoms, the
<PB N="28" REF="53"/>
most excruciating pain, was ineffectually opposed by the various
methods of bathing and pumping. From Bath I was transported to
Winchester, to the house of a physician; and after the failure of his
medical skill, we had again recourse to the virtues of the Bath waters.
During the intervals of these fits, I moved with my father to Buriton
and Putney; and a short unsuccessful trial was attempted to renew
my attendance at Westminster-school. But my infirmities could not
be reconciled with the hours and discipline of a public seminary; and
instead of a domestic tutor, who might have watched the favourable
moments, and gently advanced the progress of my learning, my
father was too easily content with such occasional teachers, as the dif∣ferent
places of my residence could supply. I was never forced, and
seldom was I persuaded, to admit these lessons: yet I read with a
clergyman at Bath some odes of Horace, and several episodes of
Virgil, which gave me an imperfect and transient enjoyment of the
Latin poets. It might now be apprehended that I should continue
for life an illiterate cripple: but, as I approached my sixteenth year,
Nature displayed in my favour her mysterious energies: my consti∣tution
was fortified and fixed; and my disorders, instead of growing
with my growth and strengthening with my strength, most wonder∣fully
vanished. I have never possessed or abused the insolence of
health: but since that time few persons have been more exempt from
real or imaginary ills; and, till I am admonished by the gout, the
reader will no more be troubled with the history of my bodily com∣plaints.
My unexpected recovery again encouraged the hope of my
education; and I was placed at Esher, in Surry, in the house of the
Reverend Mr. Philip Francis, in a pleasant spot, which promised to
unite the various benefits of air, exercise, and study (January 1752).
The translator of Horace might have taught me to relish the Latin
poets, had not my friends discovered in a few weeks, that he preferred
the pleasures of London, to the instruction of his pupils. My father's
perplexity at this time, rather than his prudence, was urged to em∣brace
<PB N="29" REF="54"/>
a singular and desperate measure. Without preparation or de∣lay
he carried me to Oxford; and I was matriculated in the univer∣sity
as a gentleman commoner of Magdalen college, before I had ac∣complished
the fifteenth year of my age (April 3, 1752).</P>
<P>The curiosity, which had been implanted in my infant mind, was
still alive and active; but my reason was not sufficiently informed to
understand the value, or to lament the loss, of three precious years
from my entrance at Westminster to my admission at Oxford. In∣stead
of repining at my long and frequent confinement to the cham∣ber
or the couch, I secretly rejoiced in those infirmities, which deli∣vered
me from the exercises of the school, and the society of my
equals. As often as I was tolerably exempt from danger and pain,
reading, free desultory reading, was the employment and comfort of
my solitary hours. At Westminster, my aunt sought only to amuse
and indulge me; in my stations at Bath and Winchester, at Buriton
and Putney, a false compassion respected my sufferings; and I was
allowed, without controul or advice, to gratify the wanderings of an
unripe taste. My indiscriminate appetite subsided by degrees in the
<HI>historic</HI> line: and since philosophy has exploded all innate ideas
and natural propensities, I must ascribe this choice to the assidu∣ous
perusal of the Universal History, as the octavo volumes succes∣sively
appeared. This unequal work, and a treatise of Hearne, the
<HI>Ductor historicus,</HI> referred and introduced me to the Greek and Roman
historians, to as many at least as were accessible to an English reader.
All that I could find were greedily devoured, from Littlebury's lame
Herodotus, and Spelman's valuable Xenophon, to the pompous
folios of Gordon's Tacitus, and a ragged Procopius of the beginning
of the last century. The cheap acquisition of so much knowledge
confirmed my dislike to the study of languages; and I argued with
Mrs. Porten, that, were I master of Greek and Latin, I must inter∣pret
to myself in English the thoughts of the original, and that such
extemporary versions must be inferior to the elaborate translations of
<PB N="30" REF="55"/>
professed scholars; a silly sophism, which could not easily be con∣futed
by a person ignorant of any other language than her own.
From the ancient I leaped to the modern world: many crude lumps
of Speed, Rapin, Mezeray, Davila, Machiavel, Father Paul, Bower,
&amp;c. I devoured like so many novels; and I swallowed with the same
voracious appetite the descriptions of India and China, of Mexico
and Peru.</P>
<P>My first introduction to the historic scenes, which have since en∣gaged
so many years of my life, must be ascribed to an accident. In
the summer of 1751, I accompanied my father on a visit to Mr.
Hoare's, in Wiltshire; but I was less delighted with the beauties of
Stourhead, than with discovering in the library a common book,
the Continuation of Echard's Roman History, which is indeed exe∣cuted
with more skill and taste than the previous work. To me
the reigns of the successors of Constantine were absolutely new;
and I was immersed in the passage of the Goths over the Da∣nube,
when the summons of the dinner-bell reluctantly dragged me
from my intellectual feast. This transient glance served rather to
irritate than to appease my curiosity; and as soon as I returned to
Bath I procured the second and third volumes of Howel's History of
the World, which exhibit the Byzantine period on a larger scale.
Mahomet and his Saracens soon fixed my attention; and some instinct
of criticism directed me to the genuine sources. Simon Ockley, an
original in every sense, first opened my eyes; and I was led from
one book to another, till I had ranged round the circle of Oriental
history. Before I was sixteen, I had exhausted all that could be
learned in English of the Arabs and Persians, the Tartars and Turks;
and the same ardour urged me to guess at the French of D'Herbelot,
and to construe the barbarous Latin of Pocock's Abulfaragius. Such
vague and multifarious reading could not teach me to think, to write,
or to act; and the only principle, that darted a ray of light into the
indigested chaos, was an early and rational application to the order
<PB N="31" REF="56"/>
of time and place. The maps of Cellarius and Wells imprinted in my
mind the picture of ancient geography: from Stranchius I imbibed
the elements of chronology: the Tables of Helvicus and Anderson,
the Annals of Usher and Prideaux, distinguished the connection of
events, and engraved the multitude of names and dates in a clear and
indelible series. But in the discussion of the first ages I overleaped
the bounds of modesty and use. In my childish balance I presumed
to weigh the systems of Scaliger and Petavius, of Marsham and New∣ton,
which I could seldom study in the originals; and my sleep has
been disturbed by the difficulty of reconciling the Septuagint with the
Hebrew computation. I arrived at Oxford with a stock of erudition,
that might have puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance, of which
a school-boy would have been ashamed.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of this first period of my life, I am tempted to
enter a protest against the trite and lavish praise of the happiness of
our boyish years, which is echoed with so much affectation in the
world. That happiness I have never known, that time I have never
regretted; and were my poor aunt still alive, she would bear testi∣mony
to the early and constant uniformity of my sentiments. It will
indeed be replied, that <HI>I</HI> am not a competent judge; that pleasure is
incompatible with pain; that joy is excluded from sickness; and that
the felicity of a school-boy consists in the perpetual motion of
thoughtless and playful agility, in which I was never qualified to
excel. My name, it is most true, could never be enrolled among
the sprightly race, the idle progeny of Eton or Westminster,
<Q><L>"Who foremost may delight to cleave,</L>
<L>"With pliant arm, the glassy wave,</L>
<L>"Or urge the flying ball."</L></Q>
The poet may gaily describe the short hours of recreation; but he
forgets the daily tedious labours of the school, which is approached
each morning with anxious and reluctant steps.</P>

A traveller, who visits Oxford or Cambridge, is surprised and edified
by the apparent order and tranquillity that prevail in the seats of the
English muses. In the most celebrated universities of Holland, Ger∣many,
and Italy, the students, who swarm from different countries,
are loosely dispersed in private lodgings at the houses of the burghers:
they dress according to their fancy and fortune; and in the intempe∣rate
quarrels of youth and wine, their <HI>swords,</HI> though less frequently
than of old, are sometimes stained with each other's blood. The use
of arms is banished from our English universities; the uniform habit
of the academics, the square cap, and black gown, is adapted to the
civil and even clerical profession; and from the doctor in divinity to
the under-graduate, the degrees of learning and age are externally
distinguished. Instead of being scattered in a town, the students of
Oxford and Cambridge are united in colleges; their maintenance is
provided at their own expence, or that of the founders; and the
stated hours of the hall and chapel represent the discipline of a regu∣lar,
and, as it were, a religious community. The eyes of the travel∣ler
are attracted by the size or beauty of the public edifices; and the
principal colleges appear to be so many palaces, which a liberal nation
has erected and endowed for the habitation of science. My own
introduction to the university of Oxford forms a new aera in my life;
and at the distance of forty years I still remember my first emotions
of surprise and satisfaction. In my fifteenth year I felt myself sud∣denly
raised from a boy to a man: the persons, whom I respected as my
superiors in age and academical rank, entertained me with every mark
of attention and civility; and my vanity was flattered by the velvet
cap and silk gown, which distinguish a gentleman commoner from a
plebeian student. A decent allowance, more money than a school-boy
had ever seen, was at my own disposal; and I might command,
among the tradesmen of Oxford, an indefinite and dangerous lati∣tude
of credit. A key was delivered into my hands, which gave me
<PB N="33" REF="58"/>
the free use of a numerous and learned library: my apartment con∣sisted
of three elegant and well-furnished rooms in the new building,
a stately pile, of Magdalen College; and the adjacent walks, had
they been frequented by Plato's disciples, might have been compared
to the Attic shade on the banks of the Ilissus. Such was the fair
prospect of my entrance (April 3, 1752) into the university of
Oxford.</P>
<P>A venerable prelate, whose taste and erudition must reflect honour
on the society in which they were formed, has drawn a very interest∣ing
picture of his academical life.—<Q>I was educated (says Bishop
Lowth) in the UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. I enjoyed all the ad∣vantages,
both public and private, which that famous seat of learn∣ing
so largely affords. I spent many years in that illustrious so∣ciety,
in a well-regulated course of useful discipline and studies, and
in the agreeable and improving commerce of gentlemen and of
scholars; in a society where emulation without envy, ambition
without jealousy, contention without animosity, incited industry,
and awakened genius; where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and
a genuine freedom of thought, was raised, encouraged, and pushed
forward by example, by commendation, and by authority. I
breathed the same atmosphere that the HOOKERS, the CHILLING∣WORTHS,
and the LOCKES had breathed before; whose benevo∣lence
and humanity were as extensive as their vast genius and
comprehensive knowledge; who always treated their adversaries
with civility and respect; who made candour, moderation, and
liberal judgment as much the rule and law as the subject of their
discourse. And do you reproach me with my education in this
place, and with my relation to this most respectable body, which
I shall always esteem my greatest advantage and my highest ho∣nour?</Q> I transcribe with pleasure this eloquent passage, without
examining what benefits or what rewards were derived by Hooker,
or Chillingworth, or Locke, from their academical institution; without
<PB N="34" REF="59"/>
inquiring, whether in this angry controversy the spirit of Lowth him∣self
is purified from the intolerant zeal, which Warburton had ascribed
to the genius of the place. It may indeed be observed, that the at∣mosphere
of Oxford did not agree with Mr. Locke's constitution, and
that the philosopher justly despised the academical bigots, who ex∣pelled
his person and condemned his principles. The expression of
gratitude is a virtue and a pleasure: a liberal mind will delight to
cherish and celebrate the memory of its parents; and the teachers of
science are the parents of the mind. I applaud the filial piety, which
it is impossible for me to imitate; since I must not confess an imagi∣nary
debt, to assume the merit of a just or generous retribution. To
the university of Oxford <HI>I</HI> acknowledge no obligation; and she will
as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her
for a mother. I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they
proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my
whole life: the reader will pronounce between the school and the
scholar; but I cannot affect to believe that Nature had disqualified me
for all literary pursuits. The specious and ready excuse of my ten∣der
age, imperfect preparation, and hasty departure, may doubtless
be alleged; nor do I wish to defraud such excuses of their proper
weight. Yet in my sixteenth year I was not devoid of capacity or
application; even my childish reading had displayed an early though
blind propensity for books; and the shallow flood might have been
taught to flow in a deep channel and a clear stream. In the disci∣pline
of a well-constituted academy, under the guidance of skilful
and vigilant professors, I should gradually have risen from trans∣lations
to originals, from the Latin to the Greek classics, from
dead languages to living science: my hours would have been oc∣cupied
by useful and agreeable studies, the wanderings of fancy
would have been restrained, and I should have escaped the tempta∣tions
of idleness, which finally precipitated my departure from
Oxford.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="60"/>
Perhaps in a separate annotation I may coolly examine the fabu∣lous
and real antiquities of our sister universities, a question which
has kindled such fierce and foolish disputes among their fanatic sons.
In the mean while it will be acknolwedged, that these venerable
bodies are sufficiently old to partake of all the prejudices and infirmi∣ties
of age. The schools of Oxford and Cambridge were founded in
a dark age of false and barbarous science; and they are still tainted
with the vices of their origin. Their primitive discipline was adapted
to the education of priests and monks; and the government still re∣mains
in the hands of the clergy, an order of men whose manners
are remote from the present world, and whose eyes are dazzled by
the light of philosophy. The legal incorporation of these societies
by the charters of popes and kings had given them a monopoly of
the public instruction; and the spirit of monopolists is narrow,
lazy, and oppressive: their work is more costly and less productive
than that of independent artists; and the new improvements so
eagerly grasped by the competition of freedom, are admitted with
slow and sullen reluctance in those proud corporations, above the fear
of a rival, and below the confession of an error. We may scarcely
hope that any reformation will be a voluntary act; and so deeply are
they rooted in law and prejudice, that even the omnipotence of par∣liament
would shrink from an inquiry into the state and abuses of
the two universities.</P>
<P>The use of academical degrees, as old as the thirteenth century, is
visibly borrowed from the mechanic corporations; in which an ap∣prentice,
after serving his time, obtains a testimonial of his skill, and
a licence to practise his trade and mystery. It is not my design to de∣preciate
those honours, which could never gratify or disappoint my
ambition; and I should applaud the institution, if the degrees of ba∣chelor
or licentiate were bestowed as the reward of manly and suc∣cessful
study: if the name and rank of doctor or master were strictly
<PB N="36" REF="61"/>
reserved for the professors of science, who have approved their title
to the public esteem.</P>
<P>In all the universities of Europe, excepting our own, the languages
and sciences and distributed among a numerous list of effective pro∣fessors:
the students, according to their taste, their calling, and their
diligence, apply themselves to the proper masters; and in the annual
repetition of public and private lectures, these masters are assiduously
employed. Our curiosity may inquire what number of professors has
been instituted at Oxford? (for I shall now confine myself to my own
university;) by whom are they appointed, and what may be the
probable chances of merit or incapacity? how many are stationed to
the three faculties, and how many are left for the liberal arts? what
is the form, and what the substance, of their lessons? But all these
questions are silenced by one short and singular answer, <Q>That in
the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors
have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence
of teaching.</Q> Incredible as the fact may appear, I must rest my
belief on the positive and impartial evidence of a master of moral and
political wisdom, who had himself resided at Oxford. Dr. Adam
Smith assigns as the cause of their indolence, that, instead of being
paid by voluntary contributions, which would urge them to increase
the number, and to deserve the gratitude of their pupils, the Oxford
professors are secure in the enjoyment of a fixed stipend, without the
necessity of labour, or the apprehension of controul. It has indeed
been observed, nor is the observation absurd, that excepting in expe∣rimental
sciences, which demand a costly apparatus and a dexterous
hand, the many valuable treatises, that have been published on every
subject of learning, may now supersede the ancient mode of oral in∣struction.
Were this principle true in its utmost latitude, I should
only infer that the offices and salaries, which are become useless, ought
without delay to be abolished. But there still remains a material
<PB N="37" REF="62"/>
difference between a book and a professor; the hour of the lecture
inforces attendance; attention is fixed by the presence, the voice,
and the occasional questions of the teacher; the most idle will carry
something away; and the more diligent will compare the instruc∣tions,
which they have heard in the school, with the volumes, which
they peruse in their chamber. The advice of a skilful professor will
adapt a course of reading to every mind and every situation; his
authority will discover, admonish, and at last chastise the negligence
of his disciples; and his vigilant inquiries will ascertain the steps of
their literary progress. Whatever science he professes he may il∣lustrate
in a series of discourses, composed in the leisure of his
closet, pronounced on public occasions, and finally delivered to the
press. I observe with pleasure, that in the university of Oxford
Dr. Lowth, with equal eloquence and erudition, has executed this
task in his incomparable <HI>Praelections</HI> on the Poetry of the Hebrews.</P>
<P>The college of St. Mary Magdalen was founded in the fifteenth
century by Wainfleet bishop of Winchester; and now consists
of a president, forty fellows, and a number of inferior students.
It is esteemed one of the largest and most wealthy of our acade∣mical
corporations, which may be compared to the Benedictine
abbeys of catholic countries; and I have loosely heard that the
estates belonging to Magdalen College, which are leased by those
indulgent landlords at small quit-rents and occasional sines, might
be raised, in the hands of private avarice, to an annual revenue of
nearly thirty thousand pounds. Our colleges are supposed to be schools
of science, as well as of education; nor is it unreasonable to
expect that a body of literary men, devoted to a life of celibacy,
exempt from the care of their own subsistence, and amply provided
with books, should devote their leisure to the prosecution of study,
and that some effects of their studies should be manifested to the
world. The shelves of their library groan under the weight of the
Benedictine folios, of the editions of the fathers, and the collections
<PB N="38" REF="63"/>
of the middle ages, which have issued from the single abbey of
St. Germain de Préz at Paris. A composition of genius must be the
offspring of one mind; but such works of industry, as may be di∣vided
among many hands, and must be continued during many
years, are the peculiar province of a laborious community. If I
inquire into the manufactures of the monks of Magdalen, if I ex∣tend
the inquiry to the other colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, a
silent blush, or a scornful frown, will be the only reply. The fel∣lows
or monks of my time were decent easy men, who supinely
enjoyed the gifts of the founder: their days were filled by a series
of uniform employments; the chapel and the hall, the coffee-house
and the common room, till they retired, weary and well satisfied,
to a long slumber. From the toil of reading, or thinking, or writing,
they had absolved their conscience; and the first shoots of learning
and ingenuity withered on the ground, without yielding any fruits
to the owners or the public. As a gentleman commoner, I was ad∣mitted
to the society of the fellows, and fondly expected that some
questions of literature would be the amusing and instructive topics of
their discourse. Their conversation stagnated in a round of college
business, Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal: their
dull and deep potations excused the brisk intemperance of youth;
and their constitutional toasts were not expressive of the most lively
loyalty for the house of Hanover. A general election was now ap∣proaching:
the great Oxfordshire contest already blazed with all the
malevolence of party-zeal. Magdalen College was devoutly attached
to the old interest! and the names of Wenman and Dashwood were
more frequently pronounced, than those of Cicero and Chrysostom.
The example of the senior fellows could not inspire the under-gra∣duates
with a liberal spirit or studious emulation; and I cannot de∣scribe,
as I never knew, the discipline of college. Some duties
may possibly have been imposed on the poor scholars, whose am∣bition
aspired to the peaceful honours of a fellowship (<HI>ascribi
<PB N="39" REF="64"/>
quietis ordinibus—Deorum</HI>); but no independent members were
admitted below the rank of a gentleman commoner, and our velvet
cap was the cap of liberty. A tradition prevailed that some of our
predecessors had spoken Latin declamations in the hall; but of this
ancient custom no vestige remained: the obvious methods of public
exercises and examinations were totally unknown; and I have never
heard that either the president or the society interfered in the private
oeconomy of the tutors and their pupils.</P>
<P>The silence of the Oxford professors, which deprives the youth
of public instruction, is imperfectly supplied by the tutors, as they
are styled, of the several colleges. Instead of confining themselves
to a single science, which had satisfied the ambition of Burman or
Bernoulli, they teach, or promise to teach, either history or ma∣thematics,
or ancient literature, or moral philosophy; and as it is
possible that they may be defective in all, it is highly probable that
of some they will be ignorant. They are paid, indeed, by private
contributions; but their appointment depends on the head of the
house: their diligence is voluntary, and will consequently be languid,
while the pupils themselves, or their parents, are not indulged in
the liberty of choice or change. The first tutor into whose hands
I was resigned appears to have been one of the best of the tribe:
Dr. Waldegrave was a learned and pious man, of a mild disposition,
strict morals, and abstemious life, who seldom mingled in the po∣litics
or the jollity of the college. But his knowledge of the world
was confined to the university; his learning was of the last, rather
than of the present age; his temper was indolent; his faculties, which
were not of the first rate, had been relaxed by the climate, and he
was satisfied, like his fellows, with the slight and superficial dis∣charge
of an important trust. As soon as my tutor had sounded the
insufficiency of his disciple in school-learning, he proposed that we
should read every morning from ten to eleven the comedies of Te∣rence.
<PB N="40" REF="65"/>
The sum of my improvement in the university of Oxford
is confined to three or four Latin plays; and even the study of an
elegant classic, which might have been illustrated by a comparison
of ancient and modern theatres, was reduced to a dry and literal in∣terpretation
of the author's text. During the first weeks I con∣stantly
attended these lessons in my tutor's room; but as they
appeared equally devoid of profit and pleasure, I was once tempted
to try the experiment of a formal apology. The apology was ac∣cepted
with a smile. I repeated the offence with less ceremony;
the excuse was admitted with the same indulgence: the slightest
motive of laziness or indisposition, the most trifling avocation at
home or abroad, was allowed as a worthy impediment; nor did my
tutor appear conscious of my absence or neglect. Had the hour of
lecture been constantly filled, a single hour was a small portion of
my academic leisure. No plan of study was recommended for my
use; no exercises were prescribed for his inspection; and, at the
most precious season of youth, whole days and weeks were suffered
to elapse without labour or amusement, without advice or account.
I should have listened to the voice of reason and of my tutor; his
mild behaviour had gained my confidence. I preferred his society to
that of the younger students; and in our evening walks to the top
of Heddington-hill, we freely conversed on a variety of subjects.
Since the days of Pocock and Hyde, Oriental learning has always
been the pride of Oxford, and I once expressed an inclination to
study Arabic. His prudence discouraged this childish fancy; but
he neglected the fair occasion of directing the ardour of a curious
mind. During my absence in the Summer vacation, Dr. Walde∣grave
accepted a college living at Washington in Sussex, and on my
return I no longer found him at Oxford. From that time I have
lost sight of my first tutor; but at the end of thirty years (1781)
he was still alive; and the practice of exercise and temperance had
entitled him to a healthy old age.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="66"/>
The long recess between the Trinity and Michaelmas terms
empties the colleges of Oxford, as well as the courts of West∣minster.
I spent, at my father's house at Buriton in Hampshire,
the two months of August and September. It is whimsical enough,
that as soon as I left Magdalen College, my taste for books began to
revive; but it was the same blind and boyish taste for the pursuit of
exotic history. Unprovided with original learning, unformed in
the habits of thinking, unskilled in the arts of composition, I re∣solved—to
write a book. The title of this first Essay, <HI>the Age of
Sesostris,</HI> was perhaps suggested by Voltaire's Age of Lewis XIV.
which was new and popular; but my sole object was to investigate
the probable date of the life and reign of the conqueror of Asia. I
was then enamoured of Sir John Marsham's Canon Chronicus; an
elaborate work, of whose merits and defects I was not yet qualified
to judge. According to his specious, though narrow plan, I settled
my hero about the time of Solomon, in the tenth century before the
Christian aera. It was therefore incumbent on me, unless I would
adopt Sir Isaac Newton's shorter chronology, to remove a formi∣dable
objection; and my solution, for a youth of fifteen, is not de∣void
of ingenuity. In his version of the Sacred Books, Manetho
the high priest has identified Sethosis, or Sesostris, with the elder
brother of Danaus, who landed in Greece, according to the Parian
Marble, fifteen hundred and ten years before Christ. But in my
supposition the high priest is guilty of a voluntary error; flattery is
the prolific parent of falsehood. Manetho's History of Egypt is
dedicated to Ptolemy Philadelphus, who derived a fabulous or ille∣gitimate
pedigree from the Macedonian kings of the race of Her∣cules.
Danaus is the ancestor of Hercules; and after the failure
of the elder branch, his descendants, the Ptolemies, are the sole re∣presentatives
of the royal family, and may claim by inheritance the
kingdom which they hold by conquest. Such were my juvenile
discoveries; at a riper age, I no longer presume to connect the
<PB N="42" REF="67"/>
Greek, the Jewish, and the Egyptian antiquities, which are lost in
a distant cloud. Nor is this the only instance, in which the belief
and knowledge of the child are superseded by the more rational
ignorance of the man. During my stay at Buriton, my infant-labour
was diligently prosecuted, without much interruption from
company or country diversions; and I already heard the music of
public applause. The discovery of my own weakness was the first
symptom of taste. On my return to Oxford, the Age of Sesostris
was wisely relinquished; but the imperfect sheets remained twenty
years at the bottom of a drawer, till, in a general clearance of papers,
(November 1772,) they were committed to the flames.</P>
<P>After the departure of Dr. Waldgrave, I was transferred, with his
other pupils, to his academical heir, whose literary character did not
command the respect of the college. Dr. *** well remembered that
he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to per∣form.
Instead of guiding the studies, and watching over the behaviour
of his disciple, I was never summoned to attend even the ceremony
of a lecture; and, excepting one voluntary visit to his rooms, during
the eight months of his titular office, the tutor and pupil lived in the
same college as strangers to each other. The want of experience,
of advice, and of occupation, soon betrayed me into some impro∣prieties
of conduct, ill-chosen company, late hours, and inconsider∣ate
expence. My growing debts might be secret; but my frequent
absence was visible and scandalous: and a tour to Bath, a visit into
Buckinghamshire, and four excursions to Lodon in the same winter,
were costly and dangerous frolics. They were, indeed, without a
meaning, as without an excuse. The irksomeness of a cloistered
life repeatedly tempted me to wander; but my chief pleasure was
that of travelling; and I was too young and bashful to enjoy, like
a Manly Oxonian in Town, the pleasures of London. In all these
excursions I eloped from Oxford; I returned to college; in a few
days I eloped again, as if I had been an independent stranger in a
<PB N="43" REF="68"/>
hired lodging, without once hearing the voice of admonition, with∣out
once feeling the hand of control. Yet my time was lost, my
expences were multiplied, my behaviour abroad was unknown; folly
as well as vice should have awakened the attention of my superiors,
and my tender years would have justified a more than ordinary de∣gree
of restraint and discipline.</P>
<P>It might at least be expected, that an ecclesiastical school should
inculcate the orthodox principles of religion. But our venerable
mother had contrived to unite the opposite extremes of bigotry and
indifference: an heretic, or unbeliever, was a monster in her eyes;
but she was always, or often, or sometimes, remiss in the spiritual
education of her own children. According to the statutes of the
university, every student, before he is matriculated, must subscribe his
assent to the thirty-nine articles of the church of England, which are
signed by more than read, and read by more than believe them.
My insufficient age excused me, however, from the immediate per∣formance
of this legal ceremony; and the vice-chancellor directed
me to return, as soon as I should have accomplished my fifteenth year;
recommending me, in the mean while, to the instruction of my col∣lege.
My college forgot to instruct: I forgot to return, and was
myself forgotten by the first magistrate of the university. Without
a single lecture, either public or private, either christian or protestant,
without any academical subscription, without any episcopal confirm∣ation,
I was left by the dim light of my catechism to grope my way
to the chapel and communion-table, where I was admitted, without
a question, how far, or by what means, I might be qualified to receive
the sacrament. Such almost incredible neglect was productive of the
worst mischiefs. From my childhood I had been fond of religious
disputation: my poor aunt has been often puzzled by the mysteries
which she strove to believe; nor had the elastic spring been totally
broken by the weight of the atmosphere of Oxford. The blind acti∣vity
of idleness urged me to advance without armour into the dan∣gerous
<PB N="44" REF="69"/>
mazes of controversy; and at the age of sixteen, I bewildered
myself in the errors of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The progress of my conversion may tend to illustrate, at least, the
history of my own mind. It was not long since Dr. Middleton's free
inquiry had sounded an alarm in the theological world: much ink
and much gall had been spilt in the defence of the primitive miracles;
and the two dullest of their champions were crowned with academic
honours by the university of Oxford. The name of Middleton was
unpopular; and his proscription very naturally led me to peruse his
writings, and those of his antagonists. His bold criticism, which ap∣proaches
the precipice of infidelity, produced on my mind a singular
effect; and had I persevered in the communion of Rome, I should
now apply to my own fortune the prediction of the Sybil,
<Q><L>—Via prima salutis,</L>
<L>Quod minimé reris, Graiâ, pandetur ab urbe.</L></Q>
The elegance of style and freedom of argument were repelled by a
shield of prejudice. I still revered the character, or rather the names,
of the saints and fathers whom Dr. Middleton exposes; nor could he
destroy my implicit belief, that the gift of miraculous powers was
continued in the church, during the first four or five centuries of
christianity. But I was unable to resist the weight of historical evi∣dence,
that within the same period most of the leading doctrines of
popery were already introduced in theory and practice: nor was my
conclusion absurd, that miracles are the test of truth, and that the
church must be orthodox and pure, which was so often approved by
the visible interposition of the Deity. The marvellous tales which
are so boldly attested by the Basils and Chrysostoms, the Austins and
Jeroms, compelled me to embrace the superior merits of celibacy, the
institution of the monastic life, the use of the sign of the cross, of
holy oil, and even of images, the invocation of saints, the worship
of relics, the rudiments of purgatory in prayers for the dead, and
<PB N="45" REF="70"/>
the tremendous mystery of the sacrifice of the body and blood of
Christ, which insensibly swelled into the prodigy of transubstantia∣tion.
In these dispositions, and already more than half a convert, I
formed an unlucky intimacy with a young gentleman of our college,
whose name I shall spare. With a character less resolute, Mr. ****
had imbibed the same religious opinions; and some Popish books, I
know not through what channel, were conveyed into his possession.
I read, I applauded, I believed: the English translations of two fa∣mous
works of Bossuet Bishop of Meaux, the Exposition of the Ca∣tholic
Doctrine, and the History of the Protestant Variations, at∣chieved
my conversion, and I surely fell by a noble hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon never talked with me on the subject of his conversion to popery but once; and then, he imputed his change to the works of Parsons the jesuit, who lived in the reign of Elizabeth, and who, he said, had urged all the best arguments in favour of the Roman catholic religion.</NOTE>. I have
since examined the originals with a more discerning eye, and shall
not hesitate to pronounce, that Bossuet is indeed a master of all the
weapons of controversy. In the Exposition, a specious apology, the
orator assumes, with consummate art, the tone of candour and sim∣plicity;
and the ten-horned monster is transformed, at his magic
touch, into the milk-white hind, who must be loved as soon as she
is seen. In the History, a bold and well-aimed attack, he displays,
with a happy mixture of narrative and argument, the faults and
follies, the changes and contradictions of our first reformers;
whose variations (as he dexterously contends) are the mark of histo∣rical
error, while the perpetual unity of the catholic church is the
sign and test of infallible truth. To my present feelings it seems in∣credible
that I should ever believe that I believed in transubstantia∣tion.
But my conqueror oppressed me with the sacramental words,
"Hoc est corpus meum," and dashed against each other the figura∣tive
half-meanings of the protestant sects: every objection was re∣solved
into omnipotence; and after repeating at St. Mary's the Atha∣nasian
<PB N="46" REF="71"/>
creed, I humbly acquiesced in the mystery of the real
presence.

of persecution, a clamour is raised of the increase of popery: and
they are always loud to declaim against the toleration of priests and
jesuits, who pervert so many of his majesty's subjects from their reli∣gion
and allegiance. On the present occasion, the fall of one or more
of her sons directed this clamour against the university; and it was
confidently affirmed that popish missionaries were suffered, under va∣rious
disguises, to introduce themselves into the colleges of Oxford.
But justice obliges me to declare, that, as far as relates to myself,
this assertion is false; and that I never conversed with a priest, or
even with a papist, till my resolution from books was absolutely
fixed. In my last excursion to London, I addressed myself to Mr.
Lewis, a Roman catholic bookseller in Russell-street, Covent Garden,
who recommended me to a priest, of whose name and order I am at
present ignorant. In our first interview he soon discovered that per∣suasion
was needless. After sounding the motives and merits of my
<PB N="47" REF="72"/>
conversion, he consented to admit me into the pale of the church;
and at his feet, on the eighth of June 1753, I solemnly, though pri∣vately,
abjured the errors of heresy. The seduction of an English
youth of family and fortune was an act of as much danger as glory; but
he bravely overlooked the danger, of which I was not then sufficiently
informed. <Q>Where a person is reconciled to the see of Rome, or
procures others to be reconciled, the offence (says Blackstone)
amounts to high treason.</Q> And if the humanity of the age would
prevent the execution of this sanguinary statute, there were other
laws of a less odious cast, which condemned the priest to perpetual
imprisonment, and transferred the proselyte's estate to his nearest re∣lation.
An elaborate controversial epistle, approved by my director,
and addressed to my father, announced and justified the step which I
had taken. My father was neither a bigot nor a philosopher; but
his affection deplored the loss of an only son; and his good sense was
astonished at my strange departure from the religion of my country.
In the first sally of passion he divulged a secret which prudence might
have suppressed, and the gates of Magdalen College were for ever shut
against my return. Many years afterwards, when the name of Gib∣bon
was become as notorious as that of Middleton, it was industri∣ously
whispered at Oxford, that the historian had formerly "turned
papist:" my character stood exposed to the reproach of inconstancy;
and this invidious topic would have been handled without mercy by
my opponents, could they have separated my cause from that of the
university. For my own part, I am proud of an honest sacrifice of
interest to conscience. I can never blush, if my tender mind was en∣tangled
in the sophistry that seduced the acute and manly understand∣ings
of CHILLINGWORTH and BAYLE, who afterwards emerged
from supersition to scepticism.</P>
<P>While Charles the First goverened England, and was himself go∣verned
by a catholic queen, it cannot be denied that the missionaries
<PB N="48" REF="73"/>
of Rome laboured with impunity and success in the court, the coun∣try,
and even the universities. One of the sheep,
<Q><L>—Whom the grim wolf with privy paw</L>
<L>Daily devours apace, and nothing said,</L></Q>
is Mr. William Chillingworth, Master of Arts, and Fellow of Tri∣nity
College, Oxford; who, at the ripe age of twenty-eight years,
was persuaded to elope from Oxford, to the English seminary at
Douay in Flanders. Some disputes with Fisher, a subtle jesuit, might
first awaken him from the prejudices of education; but he yielded to
his own victorious argument, <Q>that there must be somewhere an in∣fallible
judge; and that the church of Rome is the only christian
society which either does or can pretend to that character.</Q> After
a short trial of a few months, Mr. Chillingworth was again tormented
by religious scruples: he returned home, resumed his studies, unra∣velled
his mistakes, and delivered his mind from the yoke of autho∣rity
and superstition. His new creed was built on the principle, that
the Bible is our sole judge, and private reason our sole interpreter:
and he ably maintains this principle in the Religion of a Protestant,
a book which, after startling the doctors of Oxford, is still esteemed
the most solid defence of the Reformation. The learning, the virtue,
the recent merits of the author, entitled him to fair preferment: but
the slave had now bróken his fetters; and the more he weighed, the less
was he disposed to subscribe to the thirty-nine articles of the church
of England. In a private letter he declares, with all the energy of
language, that he could not subscribe to them without subscribing to his
own damnation; and that if ever he should depart from this immoveable
resolution, he would allow his friends to think him a madman, or an
atheist. As the letter is without a date, we cannot ascertain the num∣ber
of weeks or months that elapsed between this passionate abhor∣rence
and the Salisbury Register, which is still extant. <Q>Ego Gu∣lielmus
Chillingworth,...omnibus hisce articulis,...et sin∣gulis
<PB N="49" REF="74"/>
in iisdem contentis volens, et ex animo subscribo, et consensum
meum iisdem praebeo. 20 die Julii 1638.</Q> But, alas! the chan∣cellor
and prebendary of Sarum soon deviated from his own subscrip∣tion:
as he more deeply scrutinized the article of the Trinity, neither
scripture nor the primitive fathers could long uphold his orthodox
belief; and he could not but confess, <Q>that the doctrine of Arius is
either a truth, or at least no damnable heresy.</Q> From this middle
region of the air, the descent of his reason would naturally rest on
the firmer ground of the Socinians: and if we may credit a doubtful
story, and the popular opinion, his anxious inquiries at last subsided
in philosophic indifference. So conspicuous, however, were the can∣dour
of his nature and the innocence of his heart, that this appa∣rent
levity did not affect the reputation of Chillingworth. His fre∣quent
changes proceeded from too nice an inquisition into truth.
His doubts grew out of himself; he assisted them with all the strength
of his reason: he was then too hard for himself; but finding as little
quiet and repose in those victories, he quickly recovered, by a new
appeal to his own judgment: so that in all his fallies and retreats, he
was in fact his own convert.</P>
<P>Bayle was the son of a Calvinist minister in a remote province of
France, at the foot of the Pyrenees. For the benefit of education,
the protestants were tempted to risk their children in the catholic
universities; and in the twenty-second year of his age, young Bayle
was seduced by the arts and arguments of the jesuits of Thoulouse.
He remained about seventeen months (19th March 1669—19th Au∣gust
1670) in their hands, a voluntary captive; and a letter to his
parents, which the new convert composed or subscribed (15th April
1670), is darkly tinged with the spirit of popery. But Nature had
designed him to think as he pleased, and to speak as he thought: his
piety was offended by the excessive worship of creatures; and the
study of physics convinced him of the impossibility of transubstantia∣tion,
which is abundantly refuted by the testimony of our senses.
<PB N="50" REF="75"/>
His return to the communion of a falling sect was a bold and disin∣terested
step, that exposed him to the rigour of the laws; and a speedy
flight to Geneva protected him from the resentment of his spiritual
tyrants, unconscious as they were of the full value of the prize, which
they had lost. Had Bayle adhered to the catholic church, had he
embraced the ecclesiastical profession, the genius and favour of such
a proselyte might have aspired to wealth and honours in his native
country: but the hypocrite would have found less happiness in the
comforts of a benefice, or the dignity of a mitre, than he enjoyed at
Rotterdam in a private state of exile, indigence, and freedom. With∣out
a country, or a patron, or a prejudice, he claimed the liberty and
subsisted by the labours of his pen: the inequality of his voluminous
works is explained and excused by his alternately writing for him∣self,
for the booksellers, and for posterity; and if a severe critic would
reduce him to a single folio, that relic, like the books of the Sybil,
would become still more valuable. A calm and lofty spectator of the
religious tempest, the philosopher of Rotterdam condemned with
equal firmness the persecution of Lewis the Fourteenth, and the re∣publican
maxims of the Calvinists; their vain prophecies, and the in∣tolerant
bigotry which sometimes vexed his solitary retreat. In re∣viewing
the controversies of the times, he turned against each other
the arguments of the disputants; successively wielding the arms of the
catholics and protestants, he proves that neither the way of authority,
nor the way of examination can afford the multitude any test of reli∣gious
truth; and dexterously concludes that custom and education must
be the sole grounds of popular belief. The ancient paradox of Plu∣tarch,
that atheism is less pernicious than superstition, acquires a ten∣fold
vigor, when it is adorned with the colours of his wit, and pointed
with the acuteness of his logic. His critical dictionary is a vast repo∣sitory
of facts and opinions; and he balances the <HI>false</HI> religions in his
sceptical scales, till the opposite quantities (if I may use the language
of algebra) annihilate each other. The wonderful power which he
<PB N="51" REF="76"/>
so boldly exercised, of assembling doubts and objections, had tempted
him jocosely to assume the title of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the cloud-compelling
Jove; and in a conversation with the ingenious Abbé
(afterwards Cardinal) de Polignac, he freely disclosed his universal
Pyrrhonism. <Q>I am most truly (said Bayle) a protestant; for I
protest indifferently against all systems and all sects.</Q></P>
<P>The academical resentment, which I may possibly have provoked,
will prudently spare this plain narrative of my studies, or rather of
my idleness; and of the unfortunate event which shortened the term
of my residence at Oxford. But it may be suggested, that my father
was unlucky in the choice of a society, and the chance of a tutor. It
will perhaps be asserted, that in the lapse of forty years many im∣provements
have taken place in the college and in the university. I
am not unwilling to believe, that some tutors might have been found
more active than Dr. Waldgrave, and less contemptible than Dr. ****.
About the same time, and in the same walk, a Bentham was still
treading in the footsteps of a Burton, whose maxims he had adopted,
and whose life he had published. The biographer indeed preferred
the school-logic to the new philosophy, Bugursdicius to Locke; and
the hero appears, in his own writings, a stiff and conceited pedant.
Yet even these men, according to the measure of their capacity,
might be diligent and useful; and it is recorded of Burton, that he
taught his pupils what he knew; some Latin, some Greek, some
ethics and metaphysics; referring them to proper masters for the lan∣guages
and sciences of which he was ignorant. At a more recent
period, many students have been attracted by the merit and reputa∣tion
of Sir William Scott, then a tutor in University College, and
now conspicuous in the profession of the civil law: my personal ac∣quaintance
with that gentleman has inspired me with a just esteem for
his abilities and knowledge; and I am assured that his lectures on his∣tory
would compose, were they given to the public, a most valuable
treatise. Under the auspices of the present Archbishop of York,
<PB N="52" REF="77"/>
Dr. Markham, himself an eminent scholar, a more regular discipline
has been introduced, as I am told, at Christ Church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written on the information Mr. Gibbon had received, and the observa∣tion he had made, previous to his late residence at Lausanne. During his last visit to England, he had an opportunity of seeing at Sheffield-place some young men of the college above alluded to; he had great satisfaction in conversing with them, made many inquiries respecting their course of study, applauded the discipline of Christ Church, and the liberal attention shewn by the Dean, to those whose only recommend∣ation was their merit. Had Mr. Gibbon lived to revise this work, I am sure he would have mentioned the name of Dr. Jackson with the highest commendation. There are other colleges at Oxford, with whose discipline my friend was unacquainted, to which, without doubt, he would willingly have allowed their due praise, particularly Brazen Nose and Oriel Colleges; the former under the care of Dr. Cleaver, bishop of Chester, the latter under that of Dr. Eveleigh. It is still greatly to be wished that the general expence, or rather extravagance, of young men at our English universities may be more effectually restrained. The expence, in which they are permitted to indulge, is inconsistent not only with a necessary degree of study, but with those habits of mo∣rality which should be promoted, by all means possible, at an early period of life. An academical education in England is at present an object of alarm and terror to every thinking parent of moderate fortune. It is the apprehension of the expence, of the dissipation, and other evil consequences, which arise from the want of proper restraint at our own universities, that forces a number of our English youths to those of Scot∣land, and utterly excludes many from any sort of academical instruction. If a charge be true, which I have heard insisted on, that the heads of our colleges in Oxford and Cambridge are vain of having under their care chiefly men of opulence, who may be supposed exempt from the necessity of oeconomical controul, they are indeed highly censurable; since the mischief of allowing early habits of expence and dissipation is great, in various respects, even to those possessed of large property; and the most serious evil from this indulgence must happen to youths of humbler fortune, who certainly form the majority of students both at Oxford and Cambridge. S.</NOTE>; a course of
classical and philosophical studies is proposed, and even pursued, in
that numerous seminary: learning has been made a duty, a pleasure,
and even a fashion; and several young gentlemen do honour to
the college in which they have been educated. According to the
will of the donor, the profit of the second part of Lord Clarendon's
History has been applied to the establishment of a riding-school, that
the polite exercises might be taught, I know not with what success,
in the university. The Vinerian professorship is of far more serious
importance; the laws of his country are the first science of an Eng∣lishman
<PB N="53" REF="78"/>
of rank and fortune, who is called to be a magistrate, and
may hope to be a legislator. This judicious institution was coldly
entertained by the graver doctors, who complained (I have heard the
complaint) that it would take the young people from their books:
but Mr. Viner's benefaction is not unprofitable, since it has at least
produced the excellent commentaries of Sir William Blackstone.</P>
<P>After carrying me to Putney, to the house of his friend Mr. Mallet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of a life of Bacon, which has been rated above its value; of some forgotten poems and plays; and of the pathetic ballad of William and Margaret.</NOTE>,
by whose philosophy I was rather scandalized than reclaimed, it was
necessary for my father to form a new plan of education, and to de∣vise
some method which, if possible, might effect the cure of my
spiritual malady. After much debate it was determined, from the
advice and personal experience of Mr. Eliot (now Lord Eliot) to fix
me, during some years, at Lausanne in Switzerland. Mr. Frey, a
Swiss gentleman of Basil, undertook the conduct of the journey: we
left London the 19th of June, crossed the sea from Dover to Calais,
travelled post through several provinces of France, by the direct road
of St. Quentin, Rheims, Langres, and Besançon, and arrived the
30th of June at Lausanne, where I was immediately settled under
the roof and tuition of Mr. Pavilliard, a Calvinist minister.</P>
<P>The first marks of my father's displeasure rather astonished than
afflicted me: when he threatened to banish, and disown, and disin∣herit
a rebellious son, I cherished a secret hope that he would not be
able or willing to effect his menaces; and the pride of conscience
encouraged me to sustain the honourable and important part which I
was now acting. My spirits were raised and kept alive by the rapid
motion of my journey, the new and various scenes of the Continent,
and the civility of Mr. Frey, a man of sense, who was not ignorant
of books or the world. But after he had resigned me into Pavilliard's
hands, and I was fixed in my new habitation, I had leisure to con∣template
<PB N="54" REF="79"/>
the strange and melancholy prospect before me. My first
complaint arose from my ignorance of the language. In my child∣hood
I had once studied the French grammar, and I could imper∣fectly
understand the easy prose of a familiar subject. But when I
was thus suddenly cast on a foreign land, I found myself deprived of
the use of speech and of hearing; and, during some weeks, incapable
not only of enjoying the pleasures of conversation, but even of asking
or answering a question in the common intercourse of life. To a
home-bred Englishman every object, every custom was offensive;
but the native of any country might have been disgusted with the
general aspect of his lodging and entertainment. I had now ex∣changed
my elegant apartment in Magdalen College, for a narrow,
gloomy street, the most unfrequented of an unhandsome town, for
an old inconvenient house, and for a small chamber ill-contrived and
ill-furnished, which, on the approach of Winter, instead of a com∣panionable
fire, must be warmed by the dull invisible heat of a stove.
From a man I was again degraded to the dependance of a school-boy.
Mr. Pavilliard managed my expences, which had been reduced to
a diminutive state: I received a small monthly allowance for my
pocket-money; and helpless and awkward as I have ever been,
I no longer enjoyed the indispensable comfort of a servant. My
condition seemed as destitute of hope, as it was devoid of plea∣sure:
I was separated for an indefinite, which appeared an infinite
term from my native country; and I had lost all connection with
my catholic friends. I have since reflected with surprise, that as the
Romish clergy of every part of Europe maintain a close correspond∣ence
with each other, they never attempted, by letters or messages,
to rescue me from the hands of the heretics, or at least to confirm
my zeal and constancy in the profession of the faith. Such was my
first introduction to Lausanne; a place where I spent nearly five years
with pleasure and profit, which I afterwards revisited without com∣pulsion,
and which I have finally selected as the most grateful retreat
for the decline of my life.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="80"/>
But it is the peculiar felicity of youth that the most unpleasing ob∣jects
and events seldom make a deep or lasting impression; it forgets
the past, enjoys the present, and anticipates the future. At the
flexible age of sixteen I soon learned to endure, and gradually to
adopt, the new forms of arbitrary manners: the real hardships of my
situation were alienated by time. Had I been sent abroad in a more
splendid style, such as the fortune and bounty of my father might
have supplied, I might have returned home with the same stock of
language and science, which our countrymen usually import from the
Continent. An exile and a prisoner as I was, their example be∣trayed
me into some irregularities of wine, of play, and of idle ex∣cursions:
but I soon felt the impossibility of associating with them on
equal terms; and after the departure of my first acquaintance, I held
a cold and civil correspondence with their successors. This seclusion
from English society was attended with the most solid benefits. In
the <HI>Pays de Vaud,</HI> the French language is used with less imperfection
than in most of the distant provinces of France: in Pavilliard's fa∣mily,
necessity compelled me to listen and to speak; and if I was at
first disheartened by the apparent slowness, in a few months I was
astonished by the rapidity of my progress. My pronunciation was
formed by the constant repetition of the same sounds; the variety of
words and idioms, the rules of grammar, and distinctions of genders,
were impressed in my memory: ease and freedom were obtained by
practice; correctness and elegance by labour; and before I was re∣called
home, French, in which I spontaneously thought, was more
familiar than English to my ear, my tongue, and my pen. The first
effect of this opening knowledge was the revival of my love of read∣ing,
which had been chilled at Oxford; and I soon turned over,
without much choice, almost all the French books in my tutor's li∣brary.
Even these amusements were productive of real advantage:
my taste and judgment were now somewhat riper. I was introduced
to a new mode of style and literature: by the comparison of manners
<PB N="56" REF="81"/>
and opinions, my views were enlarged, my prejudices were corrected,
and a copious voluntary abstract of the <HI>Histoire de l'Eglise at de l'Em∣pire,</HI>
by le Sueur, may be placed in a middle line between my childish
and my manly studies. As soon as I was able to converse with the
natives, I began to feel some satisfaction in their company: my awk∣ward
timidity was polished and emboldened; and I frequented, for
the first time, assemblies of men and women. The acquaintance of
the Pavilliards prepared me by degrees for more elegant society. I
was received with kindness and indulgence in the best families of
Lausanne; and it was in one of these that I formed an intimate and
lasting connection with Mr. Deyverdun, a young man of an amiable
temper and excellent understanding. In the arts of fencing and
dancing, small indeed was my proficiency; and some months were
idly wasted in the riding-school. My unfitness to bodily exercise
reconciled me to a sedentary life, and the horse, the favourite of my
countrymen, never contributed to the pleasures of my youth.</P>
<P>My obligations to the lessons of Mr. Pavilliard, gratitude will not
suffer me to forget: he was endowed with a clear head and a warm
heart; his innate benevolence had assuaged the spirit of the church;
he was rational, because he was moderate: in the course of his studies
he had acquired a just though superficial knowledge of most branches
of literature; by long practice, he was skilled in the arts of teaching;
and he laboured with assiduous patience to know the character, gain
the affection, and open the mind of his English pupil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER></NOTE>. As soon as
<PB N="57" REF="82"/>
we began to understand each other, he gently led me, from a blind
and undistinguishing love of reading, into the path of instruction.
I consented with pleasure that a portion of the morning-hours should
be consecrated to a plan of modern history and geography, and to the
critical perusal of the French and Latin classics; and at each step I
felt myself invigorated by the habits of application and method. His
prudence repressed and dissembled some youthful fallies; and as soon
as I was confirmed in the habits of industry and temperance, he gave
the reins into my own hands. His favourable report of my beha∣viour
and progress gradually obtained some latitude of action and
expence; and he wished to alleviate the hardships of my lodging and
entertainment. The principles of philosophy were associated with
the examples of taste; and by a singular chance, the book, as well as
the man, which contributed the most effectually to my education, has
a stronger claim on my gratitude than on my admiration. Mr. De
Crousaz, the adversary of Bayle and Pope, is not distinguished by lively
fancy or profound reflection; and even in his own country, at the
end of a few years, his name and writings are almost obliterated.
But his philosophy had been formed in the school of Locke, his di∣vinity
<PB N="58" REF="83"/>
in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious
life, several generations of pupils were taught to think, and even to
write; his lessons rescued the academy of Lausanne from Calvinistic
prejudice; and he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit
among the clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud. His system of
logic, which in the last editions has swelled to six tedious and prolix
volumes, may be praised as a clear and methodical abridgment of the
art of reasoning, from our simple ideas to the most complex opera∣tions
of the human understanding. This system I studied, and medi∣tated,
and abstracted, till I have obtained the free command of an
universal instrument, which I soon presumed to exercise on my ca∣tholic
opinions. Pavilliard was not unmindful that his first task, his
most important duty, was to reclaim me from the errors of popery.
The intermixture of sects has rendered the Swiss clergy acute and
learned on the topics of controversy; and I have some of his letters
in which he celebrates the dexterity of his attack, and my gradual
concessions, after a firm and well-managed defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Pavilliard has described to me the astonishment with which he gazed on Mr. Gibbon standing before him: a thin little figure, with a large head, disputing and urging, with the greatest ability, all the best arguments that had ever been used in favour of popery. Mr. Gibbon many years ago became very fat and corpulent, but he had uncommonly small bones, and was very slight made.</NOTE>. I was willing,
and I am now willing, to allow him a handsome share of the honour
of my conversion: yet I must observe, that it was principally effected
by my private reflections; and I still remember my solitary transport
at the discovery of a philosophical argument against the doctrine of
transubstantiation: <HI>that</HI> the text of scripture, which seems to inculcate
the real presence, is attested only by a single sense—our sight; while
the real presence itself is disproved by three of our senses—the sight,
the touch, and the taste. The various articles of the Romish creed dis∣appeared
like a dream; and after a full conviction, on Christmas-day
1754, I received the sacrament in the church of Lausanne. It was
<PB N="59" REF="84"/>
here that I suspended my religious inquiries, acquiescing with im∣plicit
belief in the tenets and mysteries, which are adopted by the ge∣neral
consent of catholics and protestants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>J'espère que vous pardonnerez mon long silence en faveur des nouvelles que j'ai à vous apprendre. Si j'ai tant tardé, ce n'a été ni par oubli, ni par negligence, mais je croyois de semaine en semaine pouvoir vous annoncer que Monsieur votre sils avoit entierement renoncé aux fausses idées qu'il avoit embrassées; mais il a fallu disputer le terrein pié à pié, et je n'ai pas trouvé en lui un homme leger, et qui passe rapide∣ment d'un sentiment à un autre. Souvent après avoir detruit toutes ses idées sur un article de maniere qu'il n'avoit rien à repliquer, ce qu'il avouoit sans detour, il me disoit qu'il ne croioit pas, qu'il n'y eut rien à me repondre. La dessus je n'ai pas jugé qu'il fallut le pousser à bout, et extorquer de lui un aveu que son coeur desavoueroit; je lui donnois alors du tems pour réfléchir; tous mes livres etoient à sa disposition; je revenois à la charge quand il m'avouoit qu'il avoit etudié la matiere aussi bien qu'il l'avoit pu, et ensin j'etablissoit une verité.</P>
<P>Je me persuadois, que quand j'aurois detruit les principales erreurs de l'eglise Ro∣maine, je n'aurois qu'à faire voir que les autres sont des consequences des premières, et qu'elles ne peuvent subsister quand les fundamentales sont renversées; mais, comme je l'ai dit, je me suis trompé, il a fallu traitter chaque article dans son entier. Par la grace de Dieu, je n'ai pas perdu mon tems, et aujourdhui, si meme il conserve quelques restes de ses pernicieuses erreurs, j'ose dire qu'il n'est plus membre de l'eglise Romaine; voici dans où nous en sommes.</P>
<P>J'ai renversé l'infallibilité de l'eglise; j'ai prouvé que jamais St. Pierre n'a été chef des apôtres; que quand il l'auroit été, le pape n'est point son successeur; qu'il est dou∣teuse que St. Pierre a jamais été à Rome, mais supposé qu'il y ait été, il n'a pas été evêque de cette ville: que la transubstantiation est un invention humaine, et peu ancienne dans l'eglise; que l'adoration de l'Euchariste et le retranchement de la coupe sont contraires à la parole de Dieu: qu'il y a des saints, mais que nous ne savons pas que ils sont, et par consequent qu'on ne peut pas le prier; que le respect et le culte qu'on rend aux reliques est condamnable; qu'il n'y a point de purgatoire, et que la doctrine des indulgences est fausse: que la Careme et les jeunes du Vendredi et du Sa∣medi sont ridicules aujourdhui, et de la maniere que l'eglise Romaine les prescrit: que les imputations que l'eglise de Rome nous fait de varier dans notre doctrine, et d'avoir pour reformateurs des personnes dont la conduite et les moeurs ont été en scandale, sont entierement fausses.</P>
<P>Vous comprenez bien, Monsieur, que ces articles sont d'un longue discussion, qu'il a fallu du tems à Monsieur votre sils pour mediter mes raisons et pour y chercher des reponses. Je lui ai demandé plusieurs sois, si mes preuves et mes raisons lui parois∣soient convainquantes; il m'a toujours assuré qu'oui, de façon que j'ose assurer, aussi comme je le lui a dit à lui meme, il y a peu de tems qu'il n'étoit plus catholique Ro∣main. Je me flatte, qu'après avoir obtenu la victoire sur ces articles, je l'aurai sur le reste avec le secours de Dieu. Tellement que je compte de vous marquer dans peu que cette ouvrage est fini, je dois vous dire encore, que quoique j'ai trouvé M<SUP>r</SUP> votre fils très ferme dans ses idées, je l'ai trouvé raisonnable, qu'il s'est rendu à la lumière, et qu'il n'est pas, ce qu'on appelle, chicaneur. Par raport à l'article du jeune le Venredi et Sa∣medi, long tems apres que je vous eus ecrit qu'il n'avoit jamais marqué qu'il voulut l'ob∣server, environ le commencement du mois de Mars je m'aperçus un Vendredi qu'il ne mangeoit point de viande; je lui parlai en particulier pour en savoir la raison, craig∣nant que ce ne fut par indisposition; il me repondit qu'il l'avoit fait à dessein, et qu'il avoit cru être obligé de se conformer à la pratique d'un eglise dont il etoit membre: nous parlames quelques tems sur ce sujet; il m'assura qu'il n'invisageoit cela que comme une pratique bonne à la verité, et qu'il devoit suivre, quoiqu'il ne la crus pas sainte en elle meme, ni d'institution divine. Je ne crus pas devoir insister pour lors, ni le forcer à agir contre ses lumières: j'ai traitté cette article qu'est certainement un des moins importans, des moins fondés; et cependant il m'a fallu un tems considerable pour le detromper, et pour lui faire comprendre qu'il avoit tort de s'assujettir à la pra∣tique d'un Eglise qu'il ne reconnoissoit plus pour infaillible; que si meme cette pra∣tique avoit eu quelque utilité dans son institution, cependant elle n'en avoit aucune en elle meme, puis qu'elle ne contribuoit en rien à la pureté des moeurs; qu'ainsi il n'y avoit aucune raison, ni dans l'institution de cette pratique, ni dans la pratique en elle même, que l'autorisât à s'y soumettre: qu'aujourdhui ce n'etoit qu'une affaire d'interet, puis qu'avec de l'argent on obtennoit des dispenses pour manger gras, &amp;c. de manier que je l'ai ramené à la liberté Chretienne avec beaucoup de peine et seulement depuis quelques se maines.

Such, from my arrival at Lausanne, during the first eighteen or
twenty months (July 1753—March 1755), were my useful studies,
the foundation of all my future improvements. But every man who
rises above the common level has received two educations: the first
from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from
himself. He will not, like the fanatics of the last age, define the
moment of grace; but he cannot forget the aera of his life, in which
his mind has expanded to its proper form and dimensions. My
worthy tutor had the good sense and modesty to discorn how far he
could be useful: as soon as he felt that I advanced beyond his speed
and measure, he wisely left me to my genius; and the hours of lesson
<PB N="61" REF="86"/>
were soon lost in the voluntary labour of the whole morning, and
sometimes of the whole day. The desire of prolonging my time,
gradually confirmed the salutary habit of early rising; to which I have
always adhered, with some regard to seasons and situations: but it is
happy for my eyes and my health, that my temperate ardour has
never been seduced to trespass on the hours of the night. During the
last three years of my residence at Lausanne, I may assume the merit
of serious and solid application; but I am tempted to distinguish the
last eight months of the year 1755, as the period of the most extra∣ordinary
diligence and rapid progress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, December 1755.]—In finishing this year, I must remark how favour∣able it was to my studies. In the space of eight months, from the beginning of April, I learnt the principles of drawing; made myself complete master of the French and Latin languages, with which I was very superficially acquainted before, and wrote and translated a great deal in both; read Cicero's Epistles ad Familiares, his Brutus, all his Orations, his Dialogues de Amicitiâ, and De Senectute; Terence, twice; and Pliny's Epistles. In French, Giannone's History of Naples, and l'Abbé Bannier's Mythology, and M. de Boehat's Memoirs sur la Suisse, and wrote a very ample relation of my tour. I likewise began to study Greek, and went through the Grammar. I begun to make very large collections of what I read. But what I esteem most of all, from the perusal and meditation of De Crousaz's Logic, I not only understood the principles of that science, but formed my mind to a habit of thinking and reasoning I had no idea of before.</NOTE>. In my French and Latin
translations I adopted an excellent method, which, from my own suc∣cess,
I would recommend to the imitation of students. I chose some
classic writer, such as Cicero and Vertot, the most approved for
purity and elegance of style. I translated, for instance, an epistle of
Cicero into French; and after throwing it aside, till the words and
phrases were obliterated from my memory, I re-translated my French
into such Latin as I could find; and then compared each sentence of
my imperfect version, with the ease, the grace, the propriety of the
Roman orator. A similar experiment was made on several pages of
the Revolutions of Vertot; I turned them into Latin, returned them
<PB N="62" REF="87"/>
after a sufficient interval into my own French, and again scrutinized
the resemblance or dissimilitude of the copy and the original. By
degrees I was less ashamed, by degrees I was more satisfied with my∣self;
and I persevered in the practice of these double translations,
which filled several books, till I had acquired the knowledge of both
idioms, and the command at least of a correct style. This useful
exercise of writing was accompanied and succeeded by the more
pleasing occupation of reading the best authors. The perusal of the
Roman classics was at once my exercise and reward. Dr. Middle∣ton's
History, which I then appreciated above its true value, natu∣rally
directed me to the writings of Cicero. The most perfect edi∣tions,
that of Olivet, which may adorn the shelves of the rich, that of
Ernesti, which should lie on the table of the learned, were not in my
power. For the familiar epistles I used the text and English comment∣ary
of Bishop Ross: but my general edition was that of Verburgius,
published at Amsterdam in two large volumes in folio, with an in∣different
choice of various notes. I read, with application and plea∣sure,
<HI>all</HI> the epistles, <HI>all</HI> the orations, and the most important trea∣tises
of rhetoric and philosophy; and as I read, I applauded the ob∣servation
of Quintillian, that every student may judge of his own
proficiency, by the satisfaction which he receives from the Roman
orator. I tasted the beauties of language, I breathed the spirit of
freedom, and I imbibed from his precepts and examples the public
and private sense of a man. Cicero in Latin, and Xenophon in
Greek, are indeed the two ancients whom I would first propose to a
liberal scholar; not only for the merit of their style and sentiments,
but for the admirable lessons, which may be applied almost to every
situation of public and private life. Cicero's Epistles may in parti∣cular
afford the models of every form of correspondence, from the
careless effusions of tenderness and friendship, to the well-guarded
declaration of discreet and dignified resentment. After finishing this
<PB N="63" REF="88"/>
great author, a library of eloquence and reason, I formed a more
extensive plan of reviewing the Latin classics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, January 1756.]—I determined to read over the Latin authors in or∣der; and read this year, Virgil, Sallust, Livy, Velleius Paterculus, Valerius Maximus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Justin, Florus, Plautus, Terence, and Lucretius. I also read and meditated Locke upon the Understanding.</NOTE>, under the four divi∣sions
of, 1. historians, 2. poets, 3. orators, and 4. philosophers, in
a chronological series, from the days of Plautus and Sallust, to the
decline of the language and empire of Rome: and this plan, in the
last twenty-seven months of my residence at Lausanne (January
1756—April 1758), I <HI>nearly</HI> accomplished. Nor was this review,
however rapid, either hasty or supersicial. I indulged myself in a
second and even a third perusal of Terence, Virgil, Horace, Tacitus,
&amp;c. and studied to imbibe the sense and spirit most congenial to my
own. I never suffered a difficult or corrupt passage to escape, till I
had viewed it in every light of which it was susceptible: though often
disappointed, I always consulted the most learned or ingenious com∣mentators,
Torrentius and Dacier on Horace, Catrou and Servius on
Virgil, Lipsius on Tacitus, Meziriac on Ovid, &amp;c.; and in the ardour
of my inquiries, I embraced a large circle of historical and critical
erudition. My abstracts of each book were made in the French
language: my observations often branched into particular essays; and
I can still read, without contempt, a dissertation of eight folio pages
on eight lines (287-294) of the fourth Georgic of Virgil. Mr.
Deyverdun, my friend, whose name will be frequently repeated,
had joined with equal zeal, though not with equal perseverance, in
the same undertaking. To him every thought, every composition,
was instantly communicated; with him I enjoyed the benefits of a
free conversation on the topics of our common studies.</P>
<P>But it is scarcely possible for a mind endowed with any active cu∣riosity
to be long conversant with the Latin classics, without aspiring
<PB N="64" REF="89"/>
to know the Greek originals, whom they celebrate as their masters,
and of whom they so warmly recommend the study and imitation;</P>
<LG>
<L>—Vos exemplaria Graeca</L>
<L>Nocturnâ versate manu, versate diurnâ.</L>
</LG>
<P>It was now that I regretted the early years which had been
wasted in sickness or idleness, or mere idle reading; that I con∣demned
the perverse method of our schoolmasters, who, by first
teaching the mother-language, might descend with so much ease and
perspicuity to the origin and etymology of a derivative idiom. In
the nineteenth year of my age I determined to supply this defect;
and the lessons of Pavilliard again contributed to smooth the entrance
of the way, the Greek alphabet, the grammar, and the pronunci∣ation
according to the French accent. At my earnest request we
presumed to open the Iliad; and I had the pleasure of beholding,
though darkly and through a glass, the true image of Homer, whom
I had long since admired in an English dress. After my tutor had left
me to myself, I worked my way through about half the Iliad, and af∣terwards
interpreted alone a large portion of Xenophon and Hero∣dotus.
But my ardour, destitute of aid and emulation, was gra∣dually
cooled, and, from the barren task of searching words in a
lexicon, I withdrew to the free and familiar conversation of Virgil
and Tacitus. Yet in my residence at Lausanne I had laid a solid
foundation, which enabled me, in a more propitious season, to pro∣secute
the study of Grecian literature.</P>
<P>From a blind idea of the usefulness of such abstract science, my
father had been desirous, and even pressing, that I should devote
some time to the mathematics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER LANG="fre">

Je ne croiois pas qu'avec cette repugnance il y fit de grand progrés: je me suis trompé: il fait bien tout ce qu'il fait; il est exact à ses leçons, il s'applique à lire avant sa leçon, et il repasse avec soin, de maniere qu'il avance beaucoup, et plus que je ne me serois attendu: il est charmé d'avoir commencé, et je pense qu'il sera un petit cours de geometrie, ce que en tout ne lui prendra que sept à huit mois. Pendant qu'il fait ses leçons, il ne s'est point relaché sur ses autres études; il avance beaucoup dans le Grec, et il a presque lu la moieté de l'Iliade d'Homere; je lui fait regulierement des leçons sur cet auteur: il a aussi fini les Historiens Latins; il en est à present aux Poetes; et il a lu entierement Plaute et Terence, et bientôt il aura fini Lucrece. Au reste, il ne lit pas ces auteurs à la legere, il veut s'eclaircir sur tout; de façon, qu'avec le genie qu'il a, l'excellente memoire et l'application, il ira loin dans les sciences.</P>

Les Belles Lettres que sont son étude favorite ne l'occupent pas entierement; il continue les mathematiques, et son professeur m'assure qu'il n'a jamais vu personne avancer autant que lui, ni avoir plus d'ardeur et d'application qu'il en a. Son genie heureux et penetrant est secondé par un memoire de plus heureuse, tellement qu'il n'oublie presque rien de ce qu'il apprend.

</LETTER></NOTE>; nor could I refuse to comply with
<PB N="65" REF="90"/>
so reasonable a wish. During two winters I attended the private
lectures of Monsieur de Traytorrens, who explained the elements of
algebra and geometry, as far as the conic sections of the Marquis de
l'Hôpital, and appeared satisfied with my diligence and improve∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, January 1757.]—I began to study algebra under M. de Traytorrens, went through the elements of algebra and geometry, and the three first books of the Marquis de l'Hôpital's Conic Sections. I also read Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, Horace (with Dacier's and Torrentius's notes), Virgil, Ovid's Epistles, with Meziriac's Commentary, the Ars Amandi, and the Elegies; likewise the Augustus and Tiberius of Suetonius, and a Latin translation of Dion Cassius, from the death of Julius Caesar to the death of Augustus. I also continued my correspondence begun last year with M. Allemand of Bex, and the Professor Breitinger of Zurich; and opened a new one with the Professor Gesner of Gottingen.</P>
<P>N. B. Last year and this, I read St. John's Gospel, with part of Xenophon's Cy∣ropoedia; the Iliad, and Herodotus: but, upon the whole, I rather neglected my Greek.</P></NOTE>. But as my childish propensity for numbers and calculations
<PB N="66" REF="91"/>
was totally extinct, I was content to receive the passive impression
of my Professor's lectures, without any active exercise of my own
powers. As soon as I understood the principles, I relinquished for ever
the pursuit of the mathematics; nor can I lament that I desisted,
before my mind was hardened by the habit of rigid demonstration,
so destructive of the siner feelings of moral evidence, which must,
however, determine the actions and opinions of our lives. I listened
with more pleasure to the proposal of studying the law of nature and
nations, which was taught in the academy of Lausanne by Mr.
Vicat, a professor of some learning and reputation. But, instead of
attending his public or private course, I preferred in my closet the
lessons of his masters, and my own reason. Without being disgusted
by Grotius or Puffendorf, I studied in their writings the duties of a
man, the rights of a citizen, the theory of justice (it is, alas! a
theory), and the laws of peace and war, which have had some influ∣ence
on the practice of modern Europe. My fatigues were alleviated
by the good sense of their commentator Barbeyrac. Locke's Treatise
of Government instructed me in the knowledge of Whig principles,
which are rather founded in reason than experience; but my delight
was in the frequent perusal of Montesquieu, whose energy of style,
and boldness of hypothesis, were powerful to awaken and stimulate
the genius of the age. The logic of De Crousaz had prepared me to
<PB N="67" REF="92"/>
engage with his master Locke, and his antagonist Bayle; of whom
the former may be used as a bridle, and the latter applied as a spur,
to the curiosity of a young philosopher. According to the nature of
their respective works, the schools of argument and objection, I care∣fully
went through the Essay on Human Understanding, and occa∣sionally
consulted the most interesting articles of the Philosophic Dic∣tionary.
In the infancy of my reason I turned over, as an idle
amusement, the most serious and important treatise: in its maturity,
the most trifling performance could exercise my taste or judgment;
and more than once I have been led by a novel into a deep and in∣structive
train of thinking. But I cannot forbear to mention three
particular books, since they may have remotely contributed to form
the historian of the Roman empire. 1. From the Provincial Letters
of Pascal, which almost every year I have perused with new pleasure,
I learned to manage the weapon of grave and temperate irony, even
on subjects of ecclesiastical solemnity. 2. The Life of Julian, by
the Abbé de la Bleterie, first introduced me to the man and the
times; and I should be glad to recover my first essay on the truth
of the miracle which stopped the rebuilding of the Temple of Jeru∣salem.
3. In Giannone's Civil History of Naples, I observed with
a critical eye the progress and abuse of sacerdotal power, and the
revolutions of Italy in the darker ages. This various reading,
which I now conducted with discretion, was digested, according to
the precept and model of Mr. Locke, into a large common-place
book; a practice, however, which I do not strenuously recom∣mend.
The action of the pen will doubtless imprint an idea on
the mind as well as on the paper: but I much question whether
the benefits of this laborious method are adequate to the waste
of time; and I must agree with Dr. Johnson, (Idler, No. 74.)
<Q>that what is twice read, is commonly better remembered, than
what is transcribed.</Q></P>

During two years, if I forget some boyish excursions of a day or a
week, I was fixed at Lausanne; but at the end of the third sum∣mer,
my father consented that I should make the tour of Switzerland
with Pavilliard: and our short absence of one month (Septem∣ber

assiduous studies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><LETTER LANG="eng">

The voyage will be of about four weeks; so that <HI>I hope to find a letter from you waiting for me.</HI> As my father had given me leave to learn what I had a mind, I have learned to ride, and learn actually to dance and draw.

I told you that my father had promised to send me into France and Italy. I have thanked him for it; but if he would follow my plan, he won't do it yet a while. I never liked young travellers; they go too raw to make and great remarks, and they lose a time which is (in my opinion) the most precious part of a man's life. My scheme would be, to spend this winter at Lausanne: for though it is a very good place to acquire the air of good company and the French tongue, we have no good professors. To spend (I say) the winter at Lausanne; go into England to see my friends a couple of months, and after that, finish my studies, either at Cambridge (for after what has passed one cannot think of Oxford), or at an university in Holland. If you liked the scheme, <HI>could you not propose it to my father by Metcalf, or somebody</HI> who has <HI>a certain credit over him?</HI> I forgot to ask you whether, in case my father writes to tell me of his marriage, would you advise me to compliment my mother-in-law?

<PB N="69" REF="94"/>
reviewing the <HI>Glaciers,</HI> had not yet been introduced by foreign tra∣vellers,
who seek the sublime beauties of nature. But the political
face of the country is not less diversified by the forms and spirit of
so many various republics, from the jealous government of the <HI>few</HI>
to the licentious freedom of the <HI>many.</HI> I contemplated with plea∣sure
the new prospects of men and manners; though my conversa∣tion
with the natives would have been more free and instructive, had
I possessed the German, as well as the French language. We passed
through most of the principal towns of Switzerland; Neufchâtel,
Bienne, Soleurre, Arau, Baden, Zurich, Basil, and Bern. In
every place we visited the churches, arsenals, libraries, and all the
most eminent persons; and after my return, I digested my notes in
fourteen or fifteen sheets of a French journal, which I dispatched to
my father, as a proof that my time and his money had not been
mis-spent. Had I found this journal among his papers, I might be
tempted to select some passages; but I will not transcribe the printed
accounts, and it may be sufficient to notice a remarkable spot, which
left a deep and lasting impression on my memory. From Zurich
we proceeded to the Benedictine Abbey of Einfidlen, more com∣monly
styled Our Lady of the Hermits. I was astonished by the
profuse ostentation of riches in the poorest corner of Europe; amidst
a savage scene of woods and mountains, a palace appears to have
been erected by magic; and it was erected by the potent magic of
religion. A crowd of palmers and votaries was prostrate before the
altar. The title and worship of the Mother of God provoked my
indignation; and the lively naked image of superstition suggested
to me, as in the same place it had done to Zuinglius, the most
pressing argument for the reformation of the church. About two
years after this tour, I passed at Geneva a useful and agreeable
month; but this excursion, and some short visits in the Pais de
Vaud, did not materially interrupt my studious and sedentary life at
Lausanne.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="95"/>
My thirst of improvement, and the languid state of science at
Lausanne, soon prompted me to solicit a literary correspondence
with several men of learning, whom I had not an opportunity of
personally consulting. 1. In the perusal of Livy▪ (xxx. 44.) I had
been stopped by a sentence in a speech of Hannibal, which cannot be
reconciled by any torture with his character or argument. The
commentators dissemble, or confess their perplexity. It occurred to
me, that the change of a single letter, by substituting <HI>odio</HI> instead of
<HI>odio,</HI> might restore a clear and consistent sense; but I wished to
weigh my emendation in scales less partial than my own. I ad∣dressed
myself to M. Crevier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, N<SUP>o</SUP> I.</NOTE>, the successor of Rollin, and a pro∣fessor
in the university of Paris, who had published a large and va∣luable
edition of Livy. His answer was speedy and polite; he
praised my ingenuity, and adopted my conjecture. 2. I main∣tained
a Latin correspondence, at first anonymous, and afterwards
in my own name, with Professor Breitinger<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ditto, N<SUP>o</SUP> IV. and V.</NOTE> of Zurich, the learned
editor of a Septuagint Bible. In our frequent letters we discussed
many questions of antiquity, many passages of the Latin classics.
I proposed my interpretations and amendments. His censures, for
he did not spare my boldness of conjecture, were sharp and strong;
and I was encouraged by the consciousness of my strength, when
I could stand in free debate against a critic of such eminence
and erudition. 3. I corresponded on similar topics with the cele∣brated
Professor Matthew Gesner<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ditto, N<SUP>o</SUP> VI. VII. and VIII.</NOTE>, of the university of Gottingen;
and he accepted, as courteously as the two former, the invitation of
an unknown youth. But his abilities might possibly be decayed; his
elaborate letters were feeble and prolix; and when I asked his proper
direction, the vain old man covered half a sheet of paper with the
foolish enumeration of his titles and offices. 4. These Professors of
Paris, Zurich, and Gottingen, were strangers, whom I presumed to
<PB N="71" REF="96"/>
address on the credit of their name; but Mr. Allamand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, N<SUP>o</SUP> II. and III.</NOTE>, Minister
at Bex, was my personal friend, with whom I maintained a more
free and interesting correspondence. He was a master of language,
of science, and, above all, of dispute; and his acute and flexible
logic could support, with equal address, and perhaps with equal in∣difference,
the adverse sides of every possible question. His spirit
was active, but his pen had been indolent. Mr. Allamand had ex∣posed
himself to much scandal and reproach, by an anonymous letter
(1745) to the Protestants of France; in which he labours to per∣suade
them that <HI>public</HI> worship is the exclusive right and duty of the
state, and that their numerous assemblies of dissenters and rebels were
not authorised by the law or the gospel. His style is animated, his
arguments specious; and if the papist may seem to lurk under the
mask of a protestant, the philosopher is concealed under the disguise
of a papist. After some trials in France and Holland, which were
defeated by his fortune or his character, a genius that might have
enlightened or deluded the world, was buried in a country living,
unknown to fame, and discontented with mankind. <HI>Est sacrificulus
in pago, et rusticos decipit.</HI> As often as private or ecclesiastical business
called him to Lausanne, I enjoyed the pleasure and benefit of his
conversation, and we were mutually flattered by our attention to
each other. Our correspondence, in his absence, chiefly turned
on Locke's metaphysics, which he attacked, and I defended; the
origin of ideas, the principles of evidence, and the doctrine of
liberty;
<Q>And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.</Q>
By fencing with so skilful a master, I acquired some dexterity in the
use of my philosophic weapons; but I was still the slave of edu∣cation
and prejudice. He had some measures to keep; and I much
<PB N="72" REF="97"/>
suspect that he never shewed me the true colours of his secret
scepticism.</P>
<P>Before I was recalled from Switzerland, I had the satisfaction of
seeing the most extraordinary man of the age; a poet, an historian,
a philosopher, who has filled thirty quartos, of prose and verse, with
his various productions, often excellent, and always entertaining.
Need I add the name of Voltaire? After forfeiting, by his own
misconduct, the friendship of the first of kings, he retired, at the age
of sixty, with a plentiful fortune, to a free and beautiful country,
and resided two winters (1757 and 1758) in the town or neigh∣bourhood
of Lausanne. My desire of beholding Voltaire, whom I
then rated above his real magnitude, was easily gratified. He re∣ceived
me with civility as an English youth; but I cannot boast

<P>The ode which he composed on his first arrival on the banks of
the Leman Lake, <HI>O Maison d' Aristippe! O Jardin d'Epicure, &amp;c.</HI>
had been imparted as a secret to the gentleman by whom I was in∣troduced.
He allowed me to read it twice; I knew it by heart;
and as my discretion was not equal to my memory, the author was
soon displeased by the circulation of a copy. In writing this trivial
anecdote, I wished to observe whether my memory was impaired,
and I have the comfort of finding that every line of the poem is
still engraved in fresh and indelible characters. The highest grati∣fication
which I derived from Voltaire's residence at Lausanne, was
the uncommon circumstance of hearing a great poet declaim his own
productions on the stage. He had formed a company of gentle∣men
and ladies, some of whom were not destitute of talents. A
decent theatre was framed at Monrepos, a country-house at the end
of a suburb; dresses and scenes were provided at the expence of the
actors; and the author directed the rehearsals with the zeal and at∣tention
of paternal love. In two successive winters his tragedies of
Zayre, Alzire, Zulime, and his sentimental comedy of the Enfant
<PB N="73" REF="98"/>
Prodigue, were played at the theatre of Monrepos. Voltaire re∣presented
the characters best adapted to his years, Lusignan, Al∣varéz,
Benassar, Euphemon. His declamation was fashioned to the
pomp and cadence of the old stage; and he expressed the enthusiasm
of poetry, rather than the feelings of nature. My ardour, which
soon became conspicuous, seldom failed of procuring me a ticket.
The habits of pleasure fortified my taste for the French theatre, and
that taste has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic genius of
Shakespeare, which is inculcated from our infancy as the first duty
of an Englishman. The wit and philosophy of Voltaire, his table
and theatre, refined, in a visible degree, the manners of Lausanne;
and, however addicted to study, I enjoyed my share of the amuse∣ments
of society. After the representation of Monrepos I some∣times
supped with the actors. I was now familiar in some, and ac∣quainted
in many houses; and my evenings were generally devoted
to cards and conversation, either in private parties or numerous
assemblies.</P>
<P>I hesitate, from the apprehension of ridicule, when I approach
the delicate subject of my early love. By this word I do not mean
the polite attention, the gallantry, without hope or design, which
has originated in the spirit of chivalry, and is interwoven with
the texture of French manners. I understand by this passion the
union of desire, friendship, and tenderness, which is inflamed by
a single female, which prefers her to the rest of her sex, and which
seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our
being. I need not blush at recollecting the object of my choice;
and though my love was disappointed of success, I am rather proud
that I was once capable of feeling such a pure and exalted sentiment.
The personal attractions of Mademoiselle Susan Curchod were em∣bellished
by the virtues and talents of the mind. Her fortune was
humble, but her family was respectable. Her mother, a native of
France, had preferred her religion to her country. The profession
<PB N="74" REF="99"/>
of her father did not extinguish the moderation and philosophy of
his temper, and he lived content with a small salary and laborious
duty, in the obscure lot of minister of Crassy, in the mountains
that separate the Pays de Vaud from the county of Burgundy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

In the solitude of a sequestered village he bestowed a liberal, and
even learned, education on his only daughter. She surpassed his
hopes by her proficiency in the sciences and languages; and in her
short visits to some relations at Lausanne, the wit, the beauty, and
erudition of Mademoiselle Curchod were the theme of universal ap∣plause.
The report of such a prodigy awakened my curiosity; I
saw and loved. I found her learned without pedantry, lively in
conversation, pure in sentiment, and elegant in manners; and the
first sudden emotion was fortified by the habits and knowledge of
a more familiar acquaintance. She permitted me to make her two
or three visits at her father's house. I passed some happy days
there, in the mountains of Burgundy, and her parents honourably
encouraged the connection. In a calm retirement the gay vanity of
<PB N="75" REF="100"/>
youth no longer fluttered in her bosom; she listened to the voice
of truth and passion, and I might presume to hope that I had made
some impression on a virtuous heart. At Crassy and Lausanne I in∣dulged
my dream of felicity: but on my return to England, I soon
discovered that my father would not hear of this strange alliance,
and that without his consent I was myself destitute and helpless.
After a painful struggle I yielded to my fate: I sighed as a lover, I
obeyed as a son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Oeuvres de Rousseau, tom. xxxiii. p. 88, 89. octavo edition. As an author I shall not appeal from the judgment, or taste, or caprice of <HI>Jean Jaques:</HI> but that extraordinary man, whom I admire and pity, should have been less precipitate in con∣demning the moral character and conduct of a stranger.</NOTE>; my wound was insensibly healed by time, ab∣sence,
and the habits of a new life. My cure was accelerated by
a faithful report of the tranquillity and cheerfulness of the lady her∣self,
and my love subsided in friendship and esteem. The minister of
Crassy soon afterwards died; his stipend died with him: his daughter
retired to Geneva, where, by teaching young ladies, she earned a
hard subsistence for herself and her mother; but in her lowest
distress she maintained a spotless reputation, and a dignified behaviour.
A rich banker of Paris, a citizen of Geneva, had the good fortune
and good sense to discover and possess this inestimable treasure; and
in the capital of taste and luxury she resisted the temptations of
wealth, as she had sustained the hardships of indigence. The ge∣nius
of her husband has exalted him to the most conspicuous station
in Europe. In every change of prosperity and disgrace he has re∣clined
on the bosom of a faithful friend; and Mademoiselle Curchod
is now the wife of M. Necker, the minister, and perhaps the legi∣slator,
of the French monarchy.</P>
<P>Whatsoever have been the fruits of my education, they must be
ascribed to the fortunate banishment which placed me at Lausanne.
I have sometimes applied to my own fate the verses of Pindar, which
remind an Olympic champion that his victory was the consequence

have rolled away inactive or inglorious.</P>

<P>If my childish revolt against the religion of my country had not
stripped me in time of my academic gown, the five important years,
so liberally improved in the studies and conversation of Lausanne,
would have been steeped in port and prejudice among the monks of
Oxford. Had the fatigue of idleness compelled me to read, the
path of learning would not have been enlightened by a ray of phi∣losophic
freedom. I should have grown to manhood ignorant of
the life and language of Europe, and my knowledge of the world
would have been confined to an English cloister. But my religious
error fixed me at Lausanne, in a state of banishment and disgrace.
The rigid course of discipline and abstinence, to which I was con∣demned,
invigorated the constitution of my mind and body; poverty
and pride estranged me from my countrymen. One mischief, how∣ever,
and in their eyes a serious and irreparable mischief, was de∣rived
from the success of my Swiss education: I had ceased to be an
Englishman. At the flexible period of youth, from the age of six∣teen
to twenty-one, my opinions, habits, and sentiments were cast
<PB N="77" REF="102"/>
in a foreign mould; the faint and distant remembrance of Eng∣land
was almost obliterated; my native language was grown less
familiar; and I should have cheerfully accepted the offer of a
moderate independence on the terms of perpetual exile. By the
good sense and temper of Pavilliard my yoke was insensibly light∣ened:
he left me master of my time and actions; but he could
neither change my situation, nor increase my allowance, and with
the progress of my years and reason I impatiently sighed for the
moment of my deliverance. At length, in the Spring of the year
one thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight, my father signified his
permission and his pleasure that I should immediately return home.
We were then in the midst of a war: the resentment of the French
at our taking their ships without a declaration, had rendered that
polite nation somewhat peevish and difficult. They denied a passage
to English travellers, and the road through Germany was circuitous,
toilsome, and perhaps in the neighbourhood of the armies, exposed
to some danger. In this perplexity, two Swiss officers of my ac∣quaintance
in the Dutch service, who were returning to their gar∣risons,
offered to conduct me through France as one of their com∣panions;
nor did we sufficiently reflect that my borrowed name and
regimentals might have been considered, in case of a discovery, in a
very serious light. I took my leave of Lausanne on the 11th of
April 1758, with a mixture of joy and regret, in the firm resolu∣tion
of revisiting, as a man, the persons and places which had been
so dear to my youth. We travelled slowly, but pleasantly, in a
hired coach, over the hills of Franche-compté and the fertile pro∣vince
of Lorraine, and passed, without accident or inquiry, through
several fortified towns of the French frontier: from thence we en∣tered
the wild Ardennes of the Austrian dutchy of Luxemburg;
and after crossing the Meuse at Liege, we traversed the heaths of
Brabant, and reached, on the fifteenth day, our Dutch garrison of
Bois le Duc. In our passage through Nancy, my eye was gratified
by the aspect of a regular and beautiful city, the work of Stanislaus,
<PB N="78" REF="103"/>
who, after the storms of Polish royalty, reposed in the love and
gratitude of his new subjects of Lorraine. In our halt at Maestricht
I visited Mr. de Beaufort, a learned critic, who was known to me by
his specious arguments against the five first centuries of the Roman
History. After dropping my regimental companions, I stepped
aside to visit Rotterdam and the Hague. I wished to have observed
a country, the monument of freedom and industry; but my days
were numbered, and a longer delay would have been ungraceful. I
hastened to embark at the Brill, landed the next day at Harwich,
and proceeded to London, where my father awaited my arrival.
The whole term of my first absence from England was four years
ten months and fifteen days.</P>
<P>In the prayers of the church our personal concerns are judiciously
reduced to the threefold distinction of <HI>mind, body,</HI> and <HI>estate.</HI> The
sentiments of the mind excite and exercise our social sympathy.
The review of my moral and literary character is the most interest∣ing
to myself and to the public; and I may expatiate, without re∣proach,
on my private studies; since they have produced the publc
writings, which can alone entitle me to the esteem and friendship of
my readers. The experience of the world inculcates a discreet re∣serve
on the subject of our person and estate, and we soon learn
that a free disclosure of our riches or poverty would provoke the
malice of envy, or encourage the insolence of contempt.</P>
<P>The only person in England whom I was impatient to see was
my aunt Porten, the affectionate guardian of my tender years. I
hastened to her house in College-street, Westminster; and the even∣ing
was spent in the effusions of joy and confidence. It was not
without some awe and apprehension that I approached the presence
of my father. My infancy, to speak the truth, had been neglected
at home; the severity of his look and language at our last parting
still dwelt on my memory; nor could I form any notion of his cha∣racter,
or my probable reception. They were both more agreeable
than I could expect. The domestic discipline of our ancestors has
<PB N="79" REF="104"/>
been relaxed by the philosophy and softness of the age; and if my
father remembered that he had trembled before a stern parent, it was
only to adopt with his own son an opposite mode of behaviour.
He received me as a man and a friend; all constraint was banished
at our first interview, and we ever afterwards continued on the same
terms of easy and equal politeness. He applauded the success of
my education; every word and action was expressive of the most
cordial affection; and our lives would have passed without a cloud,
if his oeconomy had been equal to his fortune, or if his fortune had
been equal to his desires. During my absence he had married his
second wife, Miss Dorothea Patton, who was introduced to me with
the most unfavourable prejudice. I considered his second marriage
as an act of displeasure, and I was disposed to hate the rival of my
mother. But the injustice was in my own fancy, and the imaginary
monster was an amiable and deserving woman. I could not be mis∣taken
in the first view of her understanding, her knowledge, and
the elegant spirit of her conversation: her polite welcome, and her
assiduous care to study and gratify my wishes, announced at least
that the surface would be smooth; and my suspicions of art and
falsehood were gradually dispelled by the full discovery of her warm
and exquisite sensibility. After some reserve on my side, our minds
associated in confidence and friendship; and as Mrs. Gibbon had
neither children nor the hopes of children, we more easily adopted
the tender names and genuine characters of mother and of son.
By the indulgence of these parents, I was left at liberty to consult
my taste or reason in the choice of place, of company, and of
amusements; and my excursions were bounded only by the limits
of the island, and the measure of my income. Some faint efforts
were made to procure me the employment of secretary to a foreign
embassy; and I listened to a scheme which would again have trans∣ported
me to the continent. Mrs. Gibbon, with seeming wisdom,
exhorted me to take chambers in the Temple, and devote my leisure
to the study of the law. I cannot repent of having neglected her
<PB N="80" REF="105"/>
advice. Few men, without the spur of necessity, have resolution
to force their way through the thorns and thickets of that gloomy
labyrinth. Nature had not endowed me with the bold and ready
eloquence which makes itself heard amidst the tumult of the bar;
and I should probably have been diverted from the labours of lite∣rature,
without acquiring the fame or fortune of a successful pleader.
I had no need to call to my aid the regular duties of a profession;
every day, every hour, was agreeably filled; nor have I known,
like so many of my countrymen, the tediousness of an idle life.</P>
<P>Of the two years (May 1758—May 1760,) between my return
to England and the embodying of the Hampshire militia, I passed
about nine months in London, and the remainder in the country.
The metropolis affords many amusements, which are open to all.
It is itself an astonishing and perpetual spectacle to the curious eye;
and each taste, each sense may be gratified by the variety of objects
which will occur in the long circuit of a morning walk. I assiduously
frequented the theatres at a very propitious aera of the stage, when
a constellation of excellent actors, both in tragedy and comedy, was
eclipsed by the meridian brightness of Garrick in the maturity of
his judgement, and vigour of his performance. The pleasures of a
town-life are within the reach of every man who is regardless of his
health, his money, and his company. By the contagion of ex∣ample
I was sometimes seduced; but the better habits, which I had
formed at Lausanne, induced me to seek a more elegant and rational
society; and if my search was less easy and successful than I might
have hoped, I shall at present impute the failure to the disadvantages
of my situation and character. Had the rank and fortune of my
parents given them an annual establishment in London, their own
house would have introduced me to a numerous and polite circle of
acquaintance. But my father's taste had always preferred the highest
and the lowest company, for which he was equally qualified; and after
a twelve years retirement, he was no longer in the memory of the
great with whom he had associated. I found myself a stranger in
<PB N="81" REF="106"/>
the midst of a vast and unknown city; and at my entrance into life
I was reduced to some dull family parties, and some scattered con∣nections,
which were not such as I should have chosen for myself.
The most useful friends of my father were the Mallets: they re∣ceived
me with civility and kindness at first on his account, and af∣terwards
on my own; and (if I may use Lord Chesterfield's words)
I was soon <HI>domesticated</HI> in their house. Mr. Mallet, a name among
the English poets, is praised by an unforgiving enemy, for the ease
and elegance of his conversation, and his wife was not destitute of
wit or learning. By his assistance I was introduced to lady Hervey,
the mother of the present earl of Bristol. Her age and infirmities
confined her at home; her dinners were select; in the evening her
house was open to the best company of both sexes and all nations;
nor was I displeased at her preference and affectation of the manners,
the language, and the literature of France. But my progress in the
English world was in general left to my own efforts, and those efforts
were languid and slow. I had not been endowed by art or nature
with those happy gifts of confidence and address, which unlock
every door and every bosom; nor would it be reasonable to com∣plain
of the just consequences of my sickly childhood, foreign edu∣cation,
and reserved temper. While coaches were rattling through
Bond-street, I have passed many a solitary evening in my lodging
with my books. My studies were sometimes interrupted by a sigh,
which I breathed towards Lausanne; and on the approach of Spring,
I withdrew without reluctance from the noisy and extensive scene
of crowds without company, and dissipation without pleasure. In
each of the twenty-five years of my acquaintance with London
(1758—1783) the prospect gradually brightened; and this unfa∣vourable
picture most properly belongs to the first period after my
return from Switzerland.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="107"/>
My father's residence in Hampshire, where I have passed many
light, and some heavy hours, was at Buriton, near Peterssield, one
mile from the Portsmouth road, and at the easy distance of fifty-eight
miles from London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The estate and maner of Beriton, otherwise Buriton, were considerable, and were sold a few years ago to Lord Stawell. S.</NOTE> An old mansion, in a state of decay,
had been converted into the fashion and convenience of a modern
house: and if strangers had nothing to see, the inhabitants had little
to desire. The spot was not happily chosen, at the end of the vil∣lage
and the bottom of the hill: but the aspect of the adjacent
grounds was various and cheerful; the downs commanded a noble
prospect, and the long hanging woods in sight of the house could
not perhaps have been improved by art or expence. My father
kept in his own hands the whole of the estate, and even rented
some additional land; and whatsoever might be the balance of profit
and loss, the farm supplied him with amusement and plenty. The
produce maintained a number of men and horses, which were mul∣tiplied
by the intermixture of domestic and rural servants; and in
the intervals of labour the favourite team, a handsome set of bays
or greys, was harnessed to the coach. The oeconomy of the house
was regulated by the taste and prudence of Mrs. Gibbon. She
prided herself in the elegance of her occasional dinners; and from
the uncleanly avarice of Madame Pavilliard, I was suddenly trans∣ported
to the daily neatness and luxury of an English table. Our
immediate neighbourhood was rare and rustic; but from the verge of
our hills, as far as Chichester and Goodwood, the western district of
Sussex was interspersed with noble seats and hospitable families, with
whom we cultivated a friendly, and might have enjoyed a very fre∣quent,
intercourse. As my stay at Buriton was always voluntary, I
was received and dismissed with smilies; but the comforts of my retire∣ment
did not depend on the ordinary pleasures of the country. My
<PB N="83" REF="108"/>
father could never inspire me with his love and knowledge of farm∣ing.
I never handled a gun, I seldom mounted an horse; and
my philosophic walks were soon terminated by a shady bench, where
I was long detained by the sedentary amusement of reading or me∣ditation.
At home I occupied a pleasant and spacious apartment;
the library on the same floor was soon considered as my peculiar do∣main;
and I might say with truth, that I was never less alone than
when by myself. My sole complaint, which I piously suppressed,
arose from the kind restraint imposed on the freedom of my time.
By the habit of early rising I always secured a sacred portion of the
day, and many scattered moments were stolen and employed by my
studious industry. But the family hours of breakfast, of dinner,
of tea, and of supper, were regular and long; after breakfast Mrs.
Gibbon expected my company in her dressing-room; after tea my
father claimed my conversation and the perusal of the newspapers;
and in the midst of an interesting work I was often called down to
receive the visit of some idle neighbours. Their dinners and visits
required, in due season, a similar return; and I dreaded the period
of the full moon, which was usually reserved for our more distant
excursions. I could not refuse attending my father, in the summer
of 1759, to the races at Stockbridge, Reading, and Odiam, where
he had entered a horse for the hunter's plate; and I was not
displeased with the sight of our Olympic games, the beauty of
the spot, the fleetness of the horses, and the gay tumult of the
numerous spectators. As soon as the militia business was agi∣tated,
many days were tediously consumed in meetings of deputy-lieutenants
at Petersfield, Alton, and Winchester. In the close of
the same year, 1759, Sir Simeon (then Mr.) Stewart attempted
an unsuccessful contest for the county of Southampton, against
Mr. Legge, Chancellor of the Exchequer: a well-known contest,
in which Lord Bute's influence was first exerted and censured.
Our canvas at Portsmouth and Gosport lasted several days; but
<PB N="84" REF="109"/>
the interruption of my studies was compensated in some degree by
the spectacle of English manners, and the acquisition of some prac∣tical
knowledge.</P>
<P>If in a more domestic or more dissipated scene my application was
somewhat relaxed, the love of knowledge was inflamed and gratified
by the command of books; and I compared the poverty of Lausanne
with the plenty of London. My father's study at Buriton was
stuffed with much trash of the last age, with much high church
divinity and politics, which have long since gone to their proper
place: yet it contained some valuable editions of the classics and the
fathers, the choice, as it should seem, of Mr. Law; and many
English publications of the times had been occasionally added.
From this slender beginning I have gradually formed a numerous
and select library, the foundation of my works, and the best com∣fort
of my life, both at home and abroad. On the receipt of the
first quarter, a large share of my allowance was appropriated to my
literary wants. I cannot forget the joy with which I exchanged
a bank-note of twenty pounds for the twenty volumes of the Me∣moirs
of the Academy of Inscriptions; nor would it have been easy,
by any other expenditure of the same sum, to have procured so large
and lasting a fund of rational amusement. At a time when I most
assiduously frequented this school of antient literature, I thus ex∣pressed
my opinion of a learned and various collection, which since
the year 1759 has been doubled in magnitude, though not in merit—
<Q>Une de ces societés, qui ont mieux immortalisé Louis XIV. qu'un
ambition souvent pernicieuse aux hommes, commençoit deja ces
recherches qui réunissent la justesse de l'esprit, l'ameneté &amp; l'eru∣dition:
où l'on voit tant des dècouvertes, et quelquefois, ce qui
ne cede qu'à peine aux decouvertes, une <HI>ignorance</HI> modeste et
<HI>savante.</HI></Q> The review of my library must be reserved for the
period of its maturity; but in this place I may allow myself to ob∣serve,
that I am not conscious of having ever bought a book from a
<PB N="85" REF="110"/>
motive of ostentation, that every volume, before it was deposited on
the shelf, was either read or sufficiently examined, and that I soon
adopted the tolerating maxim of the elder Pliny, <Q>nullum esse
librum tam malum ut non ex aliquâ parte prodesset.</Q> I could not
yet find leisure or courage to renew the pursuit of the Greek lan∣guage,
excepting by reading the lessons of the Old and New Testament
every Sunday, when I attended the family to church. The series of
my Latin authors was less strenuously completed; but the acquisi∣tion,
by inheritance or purchase, of the best editions of Cicero,
Quintilian, Livy, Tacitus, Ovid, &amp;c. afforded a fair prospect, which
I seldom neglected. I persevered in the useful method of abstracts
and observations; and a single example may suffice, of a note which
had almost swelled into a work. The solution of a passage of Livy
(xxxviii. 38.) involved me in the dry and dark treatises of Greaves,
Arbuthnot, Hooper, Bernard, Eisenschmidt, Gronovius, La Barré,
Freret, &amp;c; and in my French essay (chap. 20.) I ridiculously send
the reader to my own <HI>manuscript</HI> remarks on the weights, coins, and
measures of the ancients, which were abruptly terminated by the
militia drum.</P>
<P>As I am now entering on a more ample field of society and
study, I can only hope to avoid a vain and prolix garrulity, by over∣looking
the vulgar crowd of my acquaintance, and confining myself
to such intimate friends among books and men, as are best entitled to
my notice by their own merit and reputation, or by the deep im∣pression
which they have left on my mind. Yet I will embrace this
occasion of recommending to the young student a practice, which
about this time I myself adopted. After glancing my eye over the
design and order of a new book, I suspended the perusal till I had
finished the task of self-examination, till I had revolved, in a solitary
walk, all that I knew or believed, or had thought on the subject
of the whole work, or of some particular chapter: I was then quali∣fied
to discern how much the author added to my original stock; and
<PB N="86" REF="111"/>
I was sometimes satisfied by the agreement, I was sometimes armed
by the opposition, of our ideas. The favourite companions of my
leisure were our English writers since the Revolution: they breathe
the spirit of reason and liberty; and they most seasonably contributed
to restore the purity of my own language, which had been corrupted
by the long use of a foreign idiom. By the judicious advice of Mr.
Mallet, I was directed to the writings of Swift and Addison; wit and
simplicity are their common attributes: but the style of Swift is sup∣ported
by manly original vigour; that of Addison is adorned by the
female graces of elegance and mildness. The old reproach, that no
British altars had been raised to the muse of history, was recently dis∣proved
by the first performances of Robertson and Hume, the his∣tories
of Scotland and of the Stuarts. I will assume the presumption
of saying, that I was not unworthy to read them: nor will I disguise
my different feelings in the repeated perusals. The perfect composi∣tion,
the nervous language, the well-turned periods of Dr. Robert∣son,
inflamed me to the ambitious hope that I might one day tread
in his footsteps: the calm philosophy, the careless inimitable beauties
of his friend and rival, often forced me to close the volume with a
mixed sensation of delight and despair.</P>
<P>The design of my first work, the Essay on the Study of Literature,
was suggested by a refinement of vanity, the desire of justifying and
praising the object of a favourite pursuit. In France, to which my
ideas were confined, the learning and language of Greece and Rome
were neglected by a philosophic age. The guardian of those studies,
the Academy of Inscriptions, was degraded to the lowest rank among
the three royal societies of Paris: the new appellation of Erudits
was contemptuously applied to the successors of Lipsius and Casau∣bon;
and I was provoked to hear (see M. d'Alembert Discours pre∣liminaire
à l'Encyclopedie) that the exercise of the memory, their
sole merit, had been superseded by the nobler faculties of the imagi∣nation
and the judgment. I was ambitious of proving by my own
<PB N="87" REF="112"/>
example, as well as by my precepts, that all the faculties of the mind
may be exercised and displayed by the study of ancient literature: I
began to select and adorn the various proofs and illustrations which
had offered themselves in reading the classics; and the first pages or
chapters of my essay were composed before my departure from
Lausanne. The hurry of the journey, and of the first weeks of my
English life, suspended all thoughts of serious application: but my
object was ever before my eyes; and no more than ten days, from
the first to the eleventh of July, were suffered to elapse after my
summer establishment at Buriton. My essay was finished in about
six weeks; and as soon as a fair copy had been transcribed by one of
the French prisoners at Peterssield, I looked round for a critic and
judge of my first performance. A writer can seldom be content with
the doubtful recompence of solitary approbation; but a youth igno∣rant
of the world, and of himself, must desire to weigh his talents in
some scales less partial than his own: my conduct was natural, my
motive laudable, my choice of Dr. Maty judicious and fortunate.
By descent and education Dr. Maty, though born in Holland, might
be considered as a Frenchman; but he was fixed in London by the
practice of physic, and an office in the British Museum. His repu∣tation
was justly founded on the eighteen volumes of the <HI>Journal
Britannique,</HI> which he had supported, almost alone, with perseverance
and success. This humble though useful labour, which had once
been dignisied by the genius of Bayle and the learning of Le Clerc,
was not disgraced by the taste, the knowledge, and the judgment of
Maty: he exhibits a candid and pleasing view of the state of litera∣ture
in England during a period of six years (January 1750—De∣cember
1755); and, far different from his angry son, he handles the
rod of criticism with the tenderness and reluctance of a parent. The
author of the <HI>Journal Britannique</HI> sometimes aspires to the character
of a poet and philosopher: his style is pure and elegant; and in his
virtues, or even in his defects, he may be ranked as one of the last
<PB N="88" REF="113"/>
disciples of the school of Fontenelle. His answer to my first letter
was prompt and polite: after a careful examination he returned my
manuscript, with some animadversion and much applause; and when
I visited London in the ensuing winter, we discussed the design and
execution in several free and familiar conversations. In a short ex∣cursion
to Buriton I reviewed my essay, according to his friendly ad∣vice;
and after suppressing a third, adding a third, and altering a
third, I consummated my first labour by a short preface, which is
dated February 3d, 1759. Yet I still shrunk from the press with
the terrors of virgin modesty: the manuscript was safely deposited in
my desk; and as my attention was engaged by new objects, the
delay might have been prolonged till I had fulfilled the precept of
Horace, <Q>nonumque prematur in annum.</Q> Father Sirmond, a
learned jesuit, was still more rigid, since he advised a young friend
to expect the mature age of fifty, before he gave himself or his writ∣ings
to the public (Olivet Histoire de l'Academie Françoise, tom. ii.
p. 143.). The counsel was singular; but it is still more singular that
it should have been approved by the example of the author. Sir∣mond
was himself fifty-five years of age when he published (in 1614)
his first work, an edition of Sidonius Apollinaris, with many valu∣able
annotations: (see his life, before the great edition of his works
in five volumes folio, Paris, 1696, é Typographiâ Regiâ).</P>
<P>Two years elapsed in silence: but in the spring of 1761 I yielded
to the authority of a parent, and complied, like a pious son, with
the wish of my own heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, March 8th, 1758.]—I began my Essai sur l'Étude de la Litterature, and wrote the 23 first chapters (excepting the following ones, 11, 12, 13. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) before I left Switzerland.</P>
<P>July 11th. I again took in hand my Essay; and in about six weeks finished it, from C. 23—55. (excepting 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. and note to C. 38.) besides a number of chapters from C. 55. to the end, which are now struck out.</P>
<P>Feb. 11th, 1759. I wrote the chapters of my Essay, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. the note to C. 38. and the first part of the preface.</P>
<P>April 23d, 1761. Being at length, by my father's advice, determined to publish my Essay, I revised it with great care, made many alterations, struck out a consider∣able part, and wrote the chapters from 57—78, which I was obliged myself to copy out fair.</P>
<P>June 10th, 1761. Finding the printing of my book proceeded but slowly, I went up to town, where I found the whole was finished. I gave Becket orders for the presents: 20 for Lausanne; copies for the Duke of Richmond, Marquis of Carnarvon, Lords Waldegrave, Litchfield, Bath, Granville, Bute, Shelbourn, Chesterfield, Hard∣wicke, Lady Hervey, Sir Joseph Yorke, Sir Matthew Featherstone, M. M. Mallet, Maty, Scott, Wray, Lord Egremont, M. de Bussy, Mademoiselle la Duchesse d'Aguil∣ion, and M. le Comte de Caylus:—great part of these were only my father's or Mallet's acquaintance.</P></NOTE>. My private resolves were influenced
<PB N="89" REF="114"/>
by the state of Europe. About this time the belligerent powers had
made and accepted overtures of peace; our English plenipotentiaries
were named to assist at the Congress of Augsbourg, which never met:
I wished to attend them as a gentleman or a secretary; and my father
fondly believed that the proof of some literary talents might introduce
me to public notice, and second the recommendations of my friends.
After a last revisal I consulted with Mr. Mallet and Dr. Maty, who
approved the design and promoted the execution. Mr. Mallet, after
hearing me read my manuscript, received it from my hands, and de∣livered
it into those of Becket, with whom he made an agreement in
my name; an easy agreement: I required only a certain number of
copies; and, without transferring my property, I devolved on the
bookseller the charges and profits of the edition. Dr. Maty under∣took,
in my absence, to correct the sheets: he inserted, without my
knowledge, an elegant and flattering epistle to the author; which is
composed, however, with so much art, that, in case of a defeat, his
favourable report might have been ascribed to the indulgence of a
friend for the rash attempt of a <HI>young English</HI> gentleman. The
work was printed and published, under the title of Essai sur l'Étude
de la Litterature, à Londres, chez T. Becket et P. A. de Hondt, 1761,
in a small volume in duodecimo: my dedication to my father, a
<PB N="90" REF="115"/>
proper and pious address, was composed the twenty-eighth of May:
Dr. Maty's letter is dated the 16th of June; and I received the first
copy (June 23d) at Alresford, two days before I marched with the
Hampshire militia. Some weeks afterwards, on the same ground, I
presented my book to the late Duke of York, who breakfasted in
Colonel Pitt's tent. By my father's direction, and Mallet's advice,
many literary gifts were distributed to several eminent characters in
England and France; two books were sent to the Count de Caylus,
and the Duchesse d'Aiguillon, at Paris: I had reserved twenty copies
for my friends at Lausanne, as the first fruits of my education, and
a grateful token of my remembrance: and on all these persons I
levied an unavoidable tax of civility and compliment. It is not sur∣prising
that a work, of which the style and sentiments were so totally
foreign, should have been more successful abroad than at home. I
was delighted by the copious extracts, the warm commendations,
and the flattering predictions of the Journals of France and Holland:
and the next year (1762) a new edition (I believe at Geneva) ex∣tended
the fame, or at least the circulation, of the work. In England
it was received with cold indifference, little read, and speedily for∣gotten:
a small impression was slowly dispersed; the bookseller mur∣mured,
and the author (had his feelings been more exquisite) might
have wept over the blunders and baldness of the English translation.
The publication of my History fifteen years afterwards revived the
memory of my first performance, and the Essay was eagerly sought
in the shops. But I refused the permission which Becket solicited of
reprinting it: the public curiosity was imperfectly satisfied by a
pirated copy of the booksellers of Dublin; and when a copy of the
original edition has been discovered in a sale, the primitive value of
half-a-crown has risen to the fanciful price of a guinea or thirty
shillings.</P>
<P>I have expatiated on the petty circumstances and period of my
first publication, a memorable aera in the life of a student, when he
<PB N="91" REF="116"/>
ventures to reveal the measure of his mind: his hopes and fears are
multiplied by the idea of self-importance, and he believes for a while
that the eyes of mankind are sixed on his person and performance.
Whatever may be my present reputation, it no longer rests on the
merit of this first essay; and at the end of twenty-eight years I may
appreciate my juvenile work with the impartiality, and almost with
the indifference, of a stranger. In his answer to Lady Hervey, the
Count de Caylus admires, or affects to admire, <Q>les livres sans
nombre que Mr. Gibbon a lus et tres bien lus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> See Appendix, Letter, No. X.</NOTE></Q>. But, alas! my
stock of erudition at that time was scanty and superficial; and if I
allow myself the liberty of naming the Greek masters, my genuine
and personal acquaintance was consined to the Latin classics. The
most serious defect of my Essay is a kind of obscurity and abruptness
which always fatigues, and may often elude, the attention of the
reader. Instead of a precise and proper definition of the title itself,
the sense of the word <HI>Litterature</HI> is loosely and variously applied: a
number of remarks and examples, historical, critical, philosophical,
are heaped on each other without method or connection; and if we
except some introductory pages, all the remaining chapters might
indifferently be reversed or transposed. The obscurity of many
passages is often affected, <HI>brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio;</HI> the desire
of expressing perhaps a common idea with sententious and oracular
brevity: alas! how fatal has been the imitation of Montesquieu!
But this obscurity sometimes proceeds from a mixture of light and
darkness in the author's mind; from a partial ray which strikes upon
an angle, instead of spreading itself over the surface of an object.
After this fair confession I shall presume to say, that the Essay does
credit to a young writer of two and twenty years of age, who had
read with taste, who thinks with freedom, and who writes in a fo∣reign
language with spirit and elegance. The defence of the early
History of Rome and the new Chronology of Sir Isaac Newton
<PB N="92" REF="117"/>
form a specious argument. The patriotic and political design of the
Georgies is happily conceived; and any probable conjecture, which
tends to raise the dignity of the poet and the poem, deserves to be
adopted, without a rigid scrutiny. Some dawnings of a philosophic
spirit enlighten the general remarks on the study of history and of
man. I am not displeased with the inquiry into the origin and na∣ture
of the gods of polytheism, which might deserve the illustra∣tion
of a riper judgment. Upon the whole, I may apply to the
first labour of my pen the speech of a far superior artist, when he
surveyed the first productions of his pencil. After viewing some
portraits which he had painted in his youth, my friend Sir Joshua
Reynolds acknowledged to me, that he was rather humbled than
flattered by the comparison with his present works; and that after
so much time and study, he had conceived his improvement to be
much greater than he found it to have been.</P>
<P>At Lausanne I composed the first chapters of my Essay in French,
the familiar language of my conversation and studies, in which it
was easier for me to write than in my mother-tongue. After my
return to England I continued the same practice, without any af∣fectation,
or design of repudiating (as Dr. Bentley would say) my
vernacular idiom. But I should have escaped some Anti-gallican
clamour, had I been content with the more natural character of an
English author. I should have been more consistent had I rejected
Mallet's advice, of prefixing an English dedication to a French book;
a confusion of tongues that seemed to accuse the ignorance of my
patron. The use of a foreign dialect might be excused by the hope
of being employed as a negociator, by the desire of being generally
understood on the continent; but my true motive was doubtless the
ambition of new and singular fame, an Englishman claiming a place
among the writers of France. The Latin tongue had been conse∣crated
by the service of the church, it was refined by the imitation of
the ancients; and in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the scholars
<PB N="93" REF="118"/>
of Europe enjoyed the advantage, which they have gradually re∣signed,
of conversing and writing in a common and learned idiom.
As that idiom was no longer in any country the vulgar speech, they
all stood on a level with each other; yet a citizen of old Rome
might have smiled at the best Latinity of the Germans and Britons;
and we may learn from the <HI>Ciceronianus</HI> of Erasmus, how difficult it
was found to steer a middle course between pedantry and barbarism.
The Romans themselves had sometimes attempted a more perilous
task, of writing in a living language, and appealing to the taste and
judgment of the natives. The vanity of Tully was doubly interested
in the Greek memoirs of his own consulship; and if he modestly
supposes that some Latinisms might be detected in his style, he is
confident of his own skill in the art of Isocrates and Aristotle;
and he requests his friend Atticus to disperse the copies of his work
at Athens, and in the other cities of Greece, (<HI>ad Atticum,</HI> i. 19. ii. 1.)
But it must not be forgotten, that from infancy to manhood Cicero
and his contemporaries had read and declaimed, and composed with
equal diligence in both languages; and that he was not allowed to
frequent a Latin school till he had imbibed the lessons of the Greek
grammarians and rhetoricians. In modern times, the language of
France has been diffused by the merit of her writers, the social
manners of the natives, the influence of the monarchy, and the
exile of the protestants. Several foreigners have seized the oppor∣tunity
of speaking to Europe in this common dialect, and Germany
may plead the authority of Leibnitz and Frederic, of the first of her
philosophers, and the greatest of her kings. The just pride and
laudable prejudice of England has restrained this communication of
idioms; and of all the nations on this side of the Alps, my country∣men
are the least practised, and least perfect in the exercise of the
French tongue. By Sir William Temple and Lord Chesterfield it was
only used on occasions of civility and business, and their printed letters
will not be quoted as models of composition. Lord Bolingbroke may
<PB N="94" REF="119"/>
have published in French a sketch of his Reflections on Exile: but his
reputation now reposes on the address of Voltaire, <Q>Docte sermones
utriusque linguae;</Q> and by his English dedication to Queen Caro∣line,
and his Essay on Epic Poetry, it should seem that Voltaire himself
wished to deserve a return of the same compliment. The exception
of Count Hamilton cannot fairly be urged; though an Irishman by
birth, he was educated in France from his childhood. Yet I am
surprised that a long residence in England, and the habits of do∣mestic
conversation, did not affect the ease and purity of his inimi∣table
style; and I regret the omission of his English verses, which
might have afforded an amusing object of comparison. I might
therefore assume the <HI>primus ego in patriam, &amp;c.;</HI> but with what suc∣cess
I have explored this untrodden path must be left to the decision
of my French readers. Dr. Maty, who might himself be questioned
as a foreigner, has secured his retreat at my expence. <Q>Je ne crois
pas que vous vous piquiez d'être moins facile à reconnoitre pour un
Anglois que Lucullus pour un Romain.</Q> My friends at Paris have
been more indulgent, they received me as a countryman, or at least
as a provincial; but they were friends and Parisians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The copious extracts which were given in the <HI>Journal Etranger</HI> by Mr. Suard, a judicious critic, must satisfy both the author and the public. I may here observe, that I have never seen in any literary review a tolerable account of my History. The manufacture of journals, at least on the continent, is miserably debased.</NOTE>. The defects
which Maty insinuates, <Q>Ces traits saillans, ces figures hardies, ce
sacrifice de la régle au sentiment, et de la cadence à la force,</Q> are
the faults of the youth, rather than of the stranger: and after the
long and laborious exercise of my own language, I am conscious
that my French style has been ripened and improved.</P>
<P>I have already hinted, that the publication of my Essay was de∣layed
till I had embraced the military profession. I shall now amuse
myself with the recollection of an active scene, which bears no
affinity to any other period of my studious and social life.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="120"/>
In the outset of a glorious war, the English people had been de∣fended
by the aid of German mercenaries. A national militia has
been the cry of every patriot since the Revolution; and this measure,
both in parliament and in the field, was supported by the country
gentlemen or Tories, who insensibly transferred their loyalty to the
house of Hanover: in the language of Mr. Burke, they have changed
the idol, but they have preserved the idolatry. In the act of offer∣ing
our names and receiving our commissions, as major and captain
in the Hampshire regiment, (June 12th, 1759,) we had not sup∣posed
that we should be dragged away, my father from his farm,
myself from my books, and condemned, during two years and a half,
(May 10, 1760—December 23, 1762,) to a wandering life of military
servitude. But a weekly or monthly exercise of thirty thousand pro∣vincials
would have left them useless and ridiculous; and after the
pretence of an invasion had vanished, the popularity of Mr. Pitt gave
a sanction to the illegal step of keeping them till the end of the war
under arms, in constant pay and duty, and at a distance from their
respective homes. When the King's order for our embodying came
down, it was too late to retreat, and too soon to repent. The South
battalion of the Hampshire militia was a small independent corps of
four hundred and seventy-six, officers and men, commanded by
lieutenant-colonel Sir Thomas Worsley, who, after a prolix and
passionate contest, delivered us from the tyranny of the lord lieute∣nant,
the Duke of Bolton. My proper station, as first captain, was
at the head of my own, and afterwards of the grenadier, company;
but in the absence, or even in the presence, of the two field officers,
I was entrusted by my friend and my father with the effective labour
of dictatig the orders, and exercising the battalion. With the help
of our original journal, I could write the history of my bloodless
and inglorious campaigns; but as these events have lost much of
their importance in my own eyes, they shall be dispatched in a few
words. From Winchester, the first place of assembly, (June 4, 1760,)
<PB N="96" REF="121"/>
we were removed, at our own request, for the benefit of a foreign
education. By the arbitrary, and often capricious, orders of the
War-office, the battalion successively marched to the pleasant and
hospitable Blandford (June 17); to Hilsea barracks, a seat of disease
and discord (September 1); to Cranbrook in the weald of Kent
(December 11); to the sea-coast of Dover (December 27); to Win∣chester
camp (June 25, 1761); to the populous and disorderly town
of Devizes (October 23); to Salisbury (February 28, 1762); to our
beloved Blandford a second time (March 9); and finally, to the
fashionable resort of Southampton (June 2); where the colours were
fixed till our final dissolution (December 23). On the beach at
Dover we had exercised in sight of the Gallic shores. But the most
splendid and useful scene of our life was a four months encampment
on Winchester Down, under the command of the Earl of Effing∣ham.
Our army consisted of the thirty-fourth regiment of foot
and six militia corps. The consciousness of our defects was stimu∣lated
by friendly emulation. We improved our time and opportu∣nities
in morning and evening field-days; and in the general re∣views
the South Hampshire were rather a credit than a disgrace to
the line. In our subsequent quarters of the Devizes and Blandford,
we advanced with a quick step in our military studies; the ballot of
the ensuing summer renewed our vigour and youth; and had the
militia subsisted another year, we might have contested the prize
with the most perfect of our brethren.</P>
<P>The loss of so many busy and idle hours was not compensated by
any elegant pleasure; and my temper was insensibly soured by the
society of our rustic officers. In every state there exists, however,
a balance of good and evil. The habits of a sedentary life were
usefully broken by the duties of an active profession: in the health∣ful
exercise of the field I hunted with a battalion, instead of a pack;
and at that time I was ready, at any hour of the day or night, to
fly from quarters to London, from London to quarters, on the
<PB N="97" REF="122"/>
slightest call of private or regimental business. But my principal
obligation to the militia, was the making me an Englishman, and a
soldier. After my foreign education, with my reserved temper, I
should long have continued a stranger in my native country, had I
not been shaken in this various scene of new faces and new friends:
had not experience forced me to feel the characters of our leading
men, the state of parties, the forms of office, and the operation of
our civil and military system. In this peaceful service, I imbibed the
rudiments of the language, and science of tactics, which opened a
new field of study and observation. I diligently read, and meditated,
the <HI>Memoires Militaires</HI> of Quintus Icilius, (Mr. Guichardt,) the
only writer who has united the merits of a professor and a veteran.
The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a
clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of
the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been use∣less
to the historian of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>A youth of any spirit is fired even by the play of arms, and in
the first sallies of my enthusiasm I had seriously attempted to em∣brace
the regular profession of a soldier. But this military fever
was cooled by the enjoyment of our mimic Bellona, who soon un∣veiled
to my eyes her naked deformity. How often did I sigh for my
proper station in society and letters. How often (a proud comparison)
did I repeat the complaint of Cicero in the command of a provincial
army: <Q>Clitellae bovi sunt impositae. Est incredibile quam me
negotii taedeat. Non habet satis magnum campum ille tibi non
ignotus cursus animi; et industriae meae praeclara opera cessat.
Lucem, <HI>libros,</HI> urbem, domum, vos desidero. Sed feram, ut
potero; sit modo annuum. Si prorogatur, actum est<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epist. ad Atticum, lib. v. 15.</NOTE></Q>. From
a service without danger I might indeed have retired without dis∣grace;
but as often as I hinted a wish of resigning, my fetters
were rivetted by the friendly intreaties of the colonel, the parental
authority of the major, and my own regard for the honour and
<PB N="98" REF="123"/>
welfare of the battalion. When I felt that my personal escape was
impracticable, I bowed my neck to the yoke: my servitude was
protracted far beyond the annual patience of Cicero; and it was not
till after the preliminaries of peace that I received my discharge, from
the act of government which disembodied the militia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, January 11th, 1761.]—In these seven or eight months of a most dis∣agreeably active life, I have had no studies to set down; indeed, I hardly took a book in my hand the whole time. The first two months at Blandford, I might have done some∣thing; but the novelty of the thing, of which for some time I was so fond as to think of going into the army, our field-days, our dinners abroad, and the drinking and late hours we got into, prevented any serious reflections. From the day we marched from Blandford I had hardly a moment I could call my own, almost continually in motion; if I was fixed for a day, it was in the guard-room, a barrack, or an inn. Our disputes consumed the little time I had left. Every letter, every memorial relative to them fell to my share; and our evening conferences were used to hear all the morning hours strike. At last I got to Dover, and Sir Thomas left us for two months. The charm was over, I was sick of so hateful a service; I was settled in a comparatively quiet situ∣ation. Once more I began to taste the pleasure of thinking.</P>
<P>Recollecting some thoughts I had formerly had in relation to the system of Paganism, which I intended to make use of in my Essay, I resolved to read Tully de Naturâ Deo∣rum, and finished it in about a month. I lost some time before I could recover my habit of application.</P>
<P>Oct. 23d.]—Our first design was to march through Marlborough; but finding on inquiry that it was a bad road, and a great way about, we resolved to push for the Devizes in one day, though nearly thirty miles. We accordingly arrived there about three o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Nov. 2d.]—I have very little to say for this and the following month. Nothing could be more uniform than the life I led there. The little civility of the neighbouring gentlemen gave us no opportunity of dining out; the time of year did not tempt us to any excursions round the country; and at first my indolence, and afterwards a violent cold, prevented my going over to Bath. I believe in the two months I never dined or lay from quarters. I can therefore only set down what I did in the literary way. De∣signing to recover my Greek, which I had somewhat neglected, I set myself to read Homer, and finished the four first books of the Iliad, with Pope's translation and notes; at the same time, to understand the geography of the Iliad, and particularly the cata∣logue, I read the 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th books of Strabo, in Casau∣bon's Latin translation: I likewise read Hume's History of England to the Reign of Henry the Seventh, just published, <HI>ingenious but superficial;</HI> and the <HI>Journals des Sçavans</HI> for August, September, and October 1761, with the <HI>Bibliotheque des Sciences,</HI> &amp;c. from July to October: Both these Journals speak very handsomely of my book.</P>
<P>December 25th, 1761.]—When, upon finishing the year, I take a review of what I have done, I am not dissatisfied with what I did in it, upon making proper allowances. On the one hand, I could begin nothing before the middle of January. The Deal duty lost me part of February; although I was at home part of March, and all April, yet electioneering is no friend to the Muses. May, indeed, though dissipated by our sea parties, was pretty quiet; but June was absolutely lost, upon the march, at Alton, and settling ourselves in camp. The four succeeding months in camp allowed me little leisure, and less quiet. November and December were indeed as much my own as any time can be whilst I remain in the militia; but still it is, at best, not a life for a man of letters. However, in this tumultuous year, (besides smaller things which I have set down,) I read four books of Homer in Greek, six of Strabo in Latin, Cicero de Naturâ Deorum, and the great philosophical and theological work of M. de Beau∣sobre: I wrote in the same time a long dissertation on the succession of Naples; re∣viewed, sitted for the press, and augmented above a fourth, my Essai sur l'Étude de la Litterature.</P>
<P>In the six weeks I passed at Beriton, as I never stirred from it, every day was like the former. I had neither visits, hunting, or walking. My only resources were my∣self, my books, and family conversations.—But to me these were great resources.</P>
<P>April 24th, 1762.]—I waited upon Colonel Harvey in the morning, to get him to apply for me to be brigade major to Lord Essingham, as a post I should be very fond of, and for which I am not unfit. Harvey received me with great good-nature and candour, told me he was both willing and able to serve me; that indeed he had already applied to Lord Essingham for * * * * *, one of his own officers, and though there would be more than one brigade major, he did not think he could pro∣perly recommend two; but that if I could get some other person to break the ice, he would second it, and believed he should succeed: should that fail, as * * * * * was in bad circumstances, he believed he could make a compromise with him (this was my desire) to let me do the duty without pay. I went from him to the Mallets, who pro∣mised to get Sir Charles Howard to speak to Lord Essingham.</P>
<P>August 22d.]—I went with Ballard to the French church, where I heard a most indifferent sermon preached by M. * * * * * *. A very bad style, a worse pronun∣ciation and action, and a very great vacuity of ideas, composed this excellent per∣formance. Upon the whole, which is preferable, the philosophic method of the English, or the rhetoric of the French preachers? The first (though less glorious) is certainly safer for the preacher. It is difficult for a man to make himself ridiculous, who proposes only to deliver plain sense on a subject he has thoroughly studied. But the instant he discovers the least pretensions towards the sublime, or the pathetic, there is no medium; we must either admire or laugh: and there are so many various talents requisite to form the character of an orator, that it is more than probable we shall laugh. As to the advantage of the hearer, which ought to be the great consideration, the dilemma is much greater. Excepting in some particular cases, where we are blinded by popular prejudices, we are in general so well acquainted with our duty, that it is almost superfluous to convince us of it. It is the heart, and not the head, that holds out; and it is certainly possible, by a moving eloquence, to rouse the sleeping sentiments of that heart, and incite it to acts of virtue. Unluckily it is not so much acts, as habits of virtue, we should have in view; and the preacher who is inculcating, with the eloquence of a Bourdaloue, the necessity of a virtuous life, will dismiss his assembly full of emotions, which a variety of other objects, the coldness of our northern con∣stitutions, and no immediate opportunity of exerting their good resolutions, will dissi∣pate in a few moments.</P>
<P>August 24th.]—The same reason that carried so many people to the assembly to-night, was what kept me away; I mean the dancing.</P>
<P>28th.]—To-day Sir Thomas came to us to dinner. The Spa has done him a great deal of good, for he looks another man. Pleased to see him, we kept bumperizing till after roll-calling; Sir Thomas assuring us, every fresh bottle, how infinitely soberer he was grown.</P>
<P>29th.]—I felt the usual consequences of Sir Thomas's company, and lost a morn∣ing, because I had lost the day before. However, having finished Voltaire, I re∣turned to Le Clerc (I mean for the amusement of my leisure hours); and laid aside for some time his <HI>Bibliotheque Universelle,</HI> to look into the <HI>Bibliotheque Choisie,</HI> which is by far the better work.</P>
<P>September 23d.]—Colonel Wilkes, of the Buckinghamshire militia, dined with us, and renewed the acquaintance Sir Thomas and myself had begun with him at Reading. I scarcely ever met with a better companion; he has inexhaustible spirits, infinite wit and humour, and a great deal of knowledge. He told us himself, that in this time of public dissension he was resolved to make his fortune. Upon this principle he has con∣nected himself closely with Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, commenced a public adversary to Lord Bute, whom he abuses weekly in the North Briton, and other political papers in which he is concerned. This proved a very debauched day: we drank a good deal both after dinner and supper; and when at last Wilkes had retired, Sir Thomas and some others (of whom I was not one) broke into his room, and made him drink a bottle of claret in bed.</P>
<P>October 5th.]—The review, which lasted about three hours, concluded, as usual, with marching by Lord Essingham, by grand divisions. Upon the whole, con∣sidering the camp had done both the Winchester and the Gosport duties all the summer, they behaved very well, and made a sine appearance. As they marched by, I had my usual curiosity to count their files. The following is my field return: I think it a curiosity; I am sure it is more exact than is commonly made to a reviewing general.</P>

<P>N. B. The Gosport detachment from the Lancashire consisted of two hundred and fifty men. The Buckinghamshire took the Winchester duty that day.</P>
<P>So that this camp in England, supposed complete, with only one detachment, had under arms, on the day of the grand review, little more than half their establishment. This amazing deficiency (though exemplified in every regiment I have seen) is an extraordinary military phoenomenon: what must it be upon foreign service? I doubt whether a nominal army of an hundred thousand men often brings fifty into the field.</P>
<P>Upon our return to Southampton in the evening, we found Sir Thomas Worsley.</P>
<P>October 21st.]—One of those impulses, which it is neither very easy nor very necessary to withstand, drew me from Longinus to a very different subject, the Greek Calendar. Last night, when in bed, I was thinking of a dissertation of M. de la Nauze upon the Roman calendar, which I read last year. This led me to consider what was the Greek, and finding myself very ignorant of it, I determined to read a short, but very excellent abstract of Mr. Dodwell's book de Cyclis, by the famous Dr. Halley. It is only twenty-five pages; but as I meditated it thoroughly, and verified all the calculations, it was a very good morning's work.</P>
<P>October 28th.]—I looked over a new Greek Lexicon which I have just received from London. It is that of Robert Constantine, Lugdun. 1637. It is a very large volume in folio, in two parts, comprising in the whole 1785 pages. After the great Thesaurus, this is esteemed the best Greek Lexicon. It seems to be so. Of a variety of words for which I looked, I always found an exact definition; the various senses well distinguished, and properly supported, by the best authorities. However, I still prefer the radical method of Scapula to this alphabetical one.</P>
<P>December 11th.]—I have already given an idea of the Gosport duty; I shall only add a trait which characterizes admirably our unthinking sailors. At a time when they knew that they should infallibly be discharged in a few weeks, numbers, who had con∣siderable wages due to them, were continually jumping over the walls, and risquing the losing of it for a few hours amusement at Portsmouth.</P>
<P>17th.]—We found old Captain Meard at Alresford, with the second division of the fourteenth. He and all his officers supped with us, and made the evening rather a drunken one.</P>
<P>18th.]—About the same hour our two corps paraded to march off. They, an old corps of regulars, who had been two years quiet in Dover castle. We, part of a young body of militia, two-thirds of our men recruits, of four months standing, two of which they had passed upon very disagreeable duty. Every advantage was on their side, and yet our superiority, both as to appearance and discipline, was so striking, that the most prejudiced regular could not have hesitated a moment. At the end of the town our two companies separated; my father's struck off for Petersfield, whilst I continued my rout to Alton; into which place I marched my company about noon; two years six months and fifteen days after my first leaving it. I gave the men some beer at roll-calling, which they received with great cheerfulness and decency. I dined and lay at Harrison's, where I was received with that old-fashioned breeding, which is at once so honourable and so troublesome.</P>
<P>23d.]—Our two companies were disembodied; mine at Alton, and my father's at Beriton. Smith marched them over from Petersfield: they fired three vollies, lodged the major's colours, delivered up their arms, received their money, partook of a dinner at the major's expence, and then separated with great cheerfulness and regularity. Thus ended the militia; I may say ended, since our annual assemblies in May are so very precarious, and can be of so little use. However, our serjeants and drums are still kept up, and quartered at the rendezvous of their company, and the adjutant remains at Southampton in full pay.</P>
<P>As this was an extraordinary scene of life, in which I was engaged above three years and a half from the date of my commission, and above two years and a half from the time of our embodying, I cannot take my leave of it without some few reflec∣tions. When I engaged in it, I was totally ignorant of its nature and consequences. I offered, because my father did, without ever imagining that we should be called out, till it was too late to retreat with honour. Indeed, I believe it happens through∣out, that our most important actions have been often determined by chance, caprice, or some very inadequate motive. After our embodying, many things contributed to make me support it with great impatience. Our continual disputes with the duke of Bolton; our unsettled way of life, which hardly allowed me books or leisure for study; and more than all, the disagreeable society in which I was forced to live.</P>
<P>After mentioning my sufferings, I must say something of what I found agreeable. Now it is over, I can make the separation much better than I could at the time. 1. The unsettled way of life itself had its advantages. The exercise and change of air and of objects amused me, at the same time that it fortified my health. 2. A new field of knowledge and amusement opened itself to me; that of military affairs, which, both in my studies and travels, will give me eyes for a new world of things, which before would have passed unheeded. Indeed, in that respect I can hardly help wishing our battalion had continued another year. We had got a fine set of new men, all our difficulties were over; we were perfectly well clothed and appointed; and, from the progress our recruits had already made, we could promise ourselves that we should be one of the best militia corps by next summer: a circumstance that would have been the more agreeable to me, as I am now established the real acting major of the battalion. But what I value most, is the knowledge it has given me of mankind in general, and of my own country in particular. The general system of our government, the methods of our several offices, the departments and powers of their respective officers, our pro∣vincial and municipal administration, the views of our several parties, the characters, connections, and influence of our principal people, have been impressed on my mind, not by vain theory, but by the indelible lessons of action and experience. I have made a number of valuable acquaintance, and am myself much better known, than (with my reserved character) I should have been in ten years, passing regularly my summers at Beriton, and my winters in London. So that the sum of all is, that I am glad the militia has been, and glad that it is no more.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="124"/>
When I complain of the loss of time, justice to myself and to the
militia must throw the greatest part of that reproach on the first
<PB N="100" REF="125"/>
seven or eight months, while I was obliged to learn as well as to
teach. The dissipation of Blandford, and the disputes of Portsmouth,
<PB N="101" REF="126"/>
consumed the hours which were not employed in the field; and
amid the perpetual hurry of an inn, a barrack, or a guard-room, all
<PB N="102" REF="127"/>
literary ideas were banished from my mind. After this long fast,
the longest which I have ever known, I once more tasted at Dover
<PB N="103" REF="128"/>
the pleasures of reading and thinking; and the hungry appetite with
which I opened a volume of Tully's philosophical works is still
present to my memory. The last review of my Essay before its pub∣lication,
had prompted me to investigate the <HI>nature of the gods;</HI> my
inquiries led me to the Histoire Critique du Manichèisme of Beau∣sobre,
<PB N="104" REF="129"/>
who discusses many deep questions of Pagan and Christian
theology: and from this rich treasury of facts and opinions, I de∣duced
my own consequences, beyond the holy circle of the author.
After this recovery I never relapsed into indolence; and my ex∣ample
might prove, that in the life most averse to study, some hours
may be stolen, some minutes may be snatched. Amidst the tumult
of Winchester camp I sometimes thought and read in my tent; in
the more settled quarters of the Devizes, Blandford, and South∣ampton,
I always secured a separate lodging, and the necessary books;
and in the summer of 1762, while the new militia was raising, I
enjoyed at Beriton two or three months of literary repose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, May 8th, 1762.]—This was my birth-day, on which I entered into the twenty-sixth year of my age. This gave me occasion to look a little into myself, and consider impartially my good and bad qualities. It appeared to me, upon this inquiry, that my character was virtuous, incapable of a base action, and formed for generous ones; but that it was proud, violent, and disagreeable in society. These qualities I must endeavour to cultivate, extirpate, or restrain, according to their dif∣ferent tendency. Wit I have none. My imagination is rather strong than pleasing. My memory both capacious and retentive. The shining qualities of my understanding are extensiveness and penetration; but I want both quickness and exactness. As to my situation in life, though I may sometimes repine at it, it perhaps is the best adapted to my character. I can command all the conveniencies of life, and I can command too that independence, (that first earthly blessing,) which is hardly to be met with in a higher or lower fortune. When I talk of my situation, I must exclude that temporary one, of being in the militia. Though I go through it with spirit and ap∣plication, it is both unfit for, and unworthy of me.</NOTE>. In
forming a new plan of study, I hesitated between the mathematics
and the Greek language; both of which I had neglected since my
return from Lausanne. I consulted a learned and friendly mathe∣matician,
Mr. George Scott, a pupil of de Moivre; and his map
of a country which I have never explored, may perhaps be more
serviceable to others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, N<SUP>o</SUP> XI. <HI>excellent,</HI> from Mr. Scott to Mr. Gibbon.</NOTE>. As soon as I had given the preference to
Greek, the example of Scaliger and my own reason determined me
<PB N="105" REF="130"/>
on the choice of Homer, the father of poetry, and the Bible of the
ancients: but Scaliger ran through the Iliad in one and twenty days;
and I was not dissatisfied with my own diligence for performing the
same labour in an equal number of weeks. After the first difficulties
were surmounted, the language of nature and harmony soon became
easy and familiar, and each day I sailed upon the ocean with a
brisker gale and a more steady course.</P>

<P>In the study of a poet who has since become the most intimate of
my friends, I successively applied many passages and fragments of
Greek writers; and among these I shall notice a life of Homer, in
the Opuscula Mythologica of Gale, several books of the geography
of Strabo, and the entire treatise of Longinus, which, from the title
and the style, is equally worthy of the epithet of <HI>sublime.</HI> My
grammatical skill was improved, my vocabulary was enlarged; and
in the militia I acquired a just and indelible knowledge of the first of
languages. On every march, in every journey, Horace was always in
my pocket, and often in my hand: but I should not mention his two
critical epistles, the amusement of a morning, had they not been accom∣panied
by the elaborate commentary of Dr. Hurd, now Bishop of Wor∣cester.
On the interesting subjects of composition and imitation of epic
and dramatic poetry, I presumed to think for myself; and thirty close-written
pages in folio could scarcely comprise my full and free discus∣sion
of the sense of the master and the pedantry of the servant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Vol. II. Miscellaneous Works.</NOTE>.</P>

youth I aspired to the character of an historian. While I served in
the militia, before and after the publication of my essay, this idea
ripened in my mind; nor can I paint in more lively colours the
feelings of the moment, than by transcribing some passages, under
their respective dates, from a journal which I kept at that time.</P>

<P>Having thought of several subjects for an historical composition,
I chose the expedition of Charles VIII. of France into Italy. I
read two memoirs of Mr. de Foncemagne in the Academy of In∣scriptions

likewise finished this day a dissertation, in which I examine the

<P>(In a week's excursion from Winchester camp.)</P>
<P>After having long revolved subjects for my intended historical
essay, I renounced my first thought of the expedition of Charles
VIII. as too remote from us, and rather an introduction to great
events, than great and important in itself. I successively chose
and rejected the crusade of Richard the First, the barons' wars
against John and Henry the Third, the history of Edward the
Black Prince, the lives and comparisons of Henry V. and the Em∣peror
Titus, the life of Sir Philip Sidney, and that of the Marquis
of Montrose. At length I have fixed on Sir Walter Raleigh for
<PB N="107" REF="132"/>
my hero. His eventful story is varied by the characters of the
soldier and sailor, the courtier and historian; and it may afford
such a fund of materials as I desire, which have not yet been pro∣perly
manufactured. At present I cannot attempt the execution
of this work. Free leisure, and the opportunity of consulting
many books, both printed and manuscript, are as necessary as
they are impossible to be attained in my present way of life.
However, to acquire a general insight into my subject and re∣sources,
I read the life of Sir Walter Raleigh by Dr. Birch, his
copious article in the General Dictionary by the same hand, and
the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James the First in Hume's
History of England.</P>

<P>(In a month's absence from the Devizes.)</P>
<P>During this interval of repose, I again turned my thoughts to
Sir Walter Raleigh, and looked more closely into my materials.
I read the two volumes in quarto of the Bacon Papers, published
by Dr. Birch; the Fragmenta Regalia of Sir Robert Naunton,
Mallet's Life of Lord Bacon, and the political treatises of that
great man in the first volume of his works, with many of his
letters in the second; Sir William Monson's Naval Tracts, and the
elaborate Life of Sir Walter Raleigh, which Mr. Oldys has prefixed
to the best edition of his History of the World. My subject opens
upon me, and in general improves upon a nearer prospect.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="journal extract">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Beriton, <DATE>July 26, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>(During my summer residence.)</P>
<P>I am afraid of being reduced to drop my hero; but my time
has not, however, been lost in the research of his story, and of a
memorable aera of our English annals. The Life of Sir Walter
Raleigh, by Oldys, is a very poor performance; a servile pane∣gyric,
or flat apology, tediously minute, and composed in a dull
<PB N="108" REF="133"/>
and affected style. Yet the author was a man of diligence and
learning, who had read every thing relative to his subject, and
whose ample collections are arranged with perspicuity and method.
Excepting some anecdotes lately revealed in the Sidney and Bacon
Papers, I know not what I should be able to add. My ambition
(exclusive of the uncertain merit of style and sentiment) must be
confined to the hope of giving a good abridgment of Oldys. I
I have even the disappointment of finding some parts of this
copious work very dry and barren; and these parts are unluckily
some of the most characteristic: Raleigh's colony of Virginia, his
quarrels with Essex, the true secret of his conspiracy, and, above
all, the detail of his private life, the most essential and important
to a biographer. My best resource would be in the circumjacent
history of the times, and perhaps in some digressions artfully in∣troduced,
like the fortunes of the Peripatetic philosophy in the
portrait of Lord Bacon. But the reigns of Elizabeth and James
the First are the periods of English history, which have been the
most variously illustrated: and what new lights could I reflect on
a subject, which has exercised the accurate industry of <HI>Birch,</HI> the
lively and curious acuteness of <HI>Walpole,</HI> the critical spirit of <HI>Hurd,</HI>
the vigorous sense of <HI>Mallet</HI> and <HI>Robertson,</HI> and the impartial
philosophy of <HI>Hume?</HI> Could I even surmount these obstacles,
I should shrink with terror from the modern history of England,
where every character is a problem, and every reader a friend
or an enemy; where a writer is supposed to hoist a flag of party,
and is devoted to damnation by the adverse faction. Such would
be <HI>my</HI> reception at home: and abroad, the historian of Raleigh
must encounter an indifference far more bitter than censure or
reproach. The events of his life are interesting; but his cha∣racter
is ambiguous, his actions are obscure, his writings are
English, and his fame is confined to the narrow limits of our
language and our island. I must embrace a safer and more ex∣tensive
theme.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="134"/>
There is one which I should prefer to all others, <HI>The History
of the Liberty of the Swiss,</HI> of that independence which a brave
people rescued from the House of Austria, defended against a
Dauphin of France, and finally sealed with the blood of Charles
of Burgundy. From such a theme, so full of public spirit, of
military glory, of examples of virtue, of lessons of government,
the dullest stranger would catch fire: what might not <HI>I</HI> hope,
whose talents, whatsoever they may be, would be inflamed with
the zeal of patriotism. But the materials of this history are in∣accessible
to me, fast locked in the obscurity of an old barbarous
German dialect, of which I am totally ignorant, and which I
cannot resolve to learn for this sole and peculiar purpose.</P>
<P>I have another subject in view, which is the contrast of the
former history: the one a poor, warlike, virtuous republic, which
emerges into glory and freedom; the other a commonwealth, soft,
opulent, and corrupt; which, by just degrees, is precipitated from
the abuse to the loss of her liberty: both lessons are, perhaps,
equally instructive. This second subject is, <HI>The History of the
Republic of Florence, under the House of Medicis:</HI> a period of one
hundred and fifty years, which rises or descends from the dregs of
the Florentine democracy, to the title and dominion of Cosmo de
Medicis in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. I might deduce a
chain of revolutions not unworthy of the pen of Vertot; singular
men, and singular events; the Medicis four times expelled, and
as often recalled; and the Genius of Freedom reluctantly yielding
to the arms of Charles V. and the policy of Cosmo. The cha∣racter
and fate of Savanerola, and the revival of arts and letters in
Italy, will be essentially connected with the elevation of the family
and the fall of the republic. The Medicis (stirps quasi fataliter
nata ad instauranda vel fovenda studia (Lipsius ad Germanos et
Gallos, Epist. viii.) were illustrated by the patronage of learning;
and enthusiasm was the most formidable weapon of their adver∣saries.
<PB N="110" REF="135"/>
On this splendid subject I shall most probably six; but
<HI>when,</HI> or <HI>where,</HI> or <HI>how</HI> will it be executed? I behold in a dark
and doubtful perspective.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<Q>Res altâ terrâ, et caligine mersas <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, July 27, 1762.]—The reflections which I was making yesterday I continued and digested to-day. I don't absolutely look on that time as lost, but that it might have been better employed than in revolving schemes, the execution of which is so far distant. I must learn to check these wanderings of my imagination.</P>
<P>Nov. 24.]—I dined at the Cocoa Tree with * * * * * *; who, under a great ap∣pearance of oddity, conceals more real honour, good sense, and even knowledge, than half those who laugh at him. We went thence to the play (the Spanish Friar); and when it was over, returned to the Cocoa Tree. That respectable body, of which I have the honour of being a member, affords every evening a sight truly English. Twenty or thirty, perhaps, of the first men in the kingdom, in point of fashion and for∣tune, supping at little tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a coffee-room, upon a bit of cold meat, or a Sandwich, and drinking a glass of punch. At present, we are full of king's counsellors and lords of the bedchamber; who, having jumped into the ministry, make a very singular medley of their old principles and language, with their modern ones.</P>
<P>Nov. 26.]—I went with Mallet to breakfast with Garrick; and thence to Drury∣lane House, where I assisted at a very private rehearsal, in the Green-room, of a new tragedy of Mallet's, called Elvira. As I have since seen it acted, I shall defer my opinion of it till then; but I cannot help mentioning here the surprising versatility of Mrs. Pritchard's talents, who rehearsed, almost at the same time, the part of a furious queen in the Green-room, and that of a coquette on the stage; and passed several times from one to the other with the utmost ease and happiness.</P>
<P>Dec. 30.]—Before I close the year I must balance my accounts—not of money, but of time. I may divide my studies into four branches: 1. Books that I have read for themselves, classic writers, or capital treatises upon any science; such books as ought to be perused with attention, and meditated with care. Of these I read <HI>the twenty last books of the Iliad twice, the three first books of the Odyssey, the Life of Homer,</HI> and <HI>Longinus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 2. Books which I have read, or consulted, to illustrate the former. Such as this year, <HI>Blackwall's Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer, Burke's Sublime and Beautiful, Hurd's Horace, Guichard's Memoires Militaires,</HI> a great va∣riety of passages of the ancients occasionally useful: large extracts from <HI>Mezeriac, Bayle,</HI> and <HI>Poter;</HI> and many memoirs and abstracts from the <HI>Academy of Belles Lettres:</HI> among these I shall only mention here two long and curious suites of dissertations—<HI>the one upon the Temple of Delphi, the Amphictyonic Council, and the Holy Wars, by M. M. Har∣dion and de Valois; the other upon the Games of the Grecians, by M. M. Burette, Gedoyne, and de la Barre.</HI> 3. Books of amusement and instruction, perused at my leisure hours, without any reference to a regular plan of study. Of these, perhaps, I read too many, since I went through the Life of Erasmus, by Le Clerc and Burigny, many extracts from <HI>Le Clerc's Bibliotheques, The Ciceronianus,</HI> and <HI>Colloquies of Erasmus, Barclay's Ar∣genis, Terasson's Sethos, Voltaire's Siecle de Louis XIV. Madame de Motteville's Memoirs,</HI> and <HI>Fontenelle's Works.</HI> 4. Compositions of my own. I find hardly any, except <HI>this Journal,</HI> and the <HI>Extract of Hurd's Horace,</HI> which (like a chapter of Montaigne) con∣tains many things very different from its title. To these four heads I must this year add a fifth. 5. Those treatises of English history which I read in January, with a view to my now abortive scheme of the <HI>Life of Sir Walter Raleigh.</HI> I ought indeed to have known my own mind better before I undertook them. Upon the whole, after making proper allowances, I am not dissatisfied with the year.</P>
<P>The three weeks which I passed at Beriton, at the end of this and the beginning of the ensuing year, are almost a blank. I seldom went out; and as the scheme of my travelling was at last entirely settled, the hurry of impatience, the cares of preparations, and the tenderness of friends I was going to quit, allowed me hardly any moments for study.</P></NOTE>.</Q>

The youthful habits of the language and manners of France had
left in my mind an ardent desire of revisiting the Continent on a
larger and more liberal plan. According to the law of custom, and
perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an
English gentleman: my father had consented to my wish, but I was
detained above four years by my rash engagement in the militia. I
eagerly grasped the first moments of freedom: three or four weeks in
Hampshire and London were employed in the preparations of my
journey, and the farewell visits of friendship and civility: my last
act in town was to applaud Mallet's new tragedy of Elvira<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, January 11th, 1763.]—I called upon Dr. Maty in the morning. He told me that the Duke de Nivernois desired to be acquainted with me. It was in∣deed with that view that I had written to Maty from Beriton to present, in my name, a copy of my book to him. Thence I went to Becket, paid him his bill, (fifty-four pounds,) and gave him back his translation. It must be printed, though very indif∣ferent. My comfort is, that my misfortune is not an uncommon one. We dined and supped at the Mallets.</P>
<P>12th. I went with Maty to visit the Duke in Albemarle Street. He is a little emaciated figure, but appears to possess a good understanding, taste and know∣ledge. He offered me very politely letters for Paris. We dined at our lodgings. I went to Covent Garden to see Woodward in Bobadil, and supped with the Mallets at George Scott's.</P>
<P>JOURNAL, Jan. 19th, 1763.]—I waited upon Lady Hervey and the Duke de Niver∣nois, and received my credentials. Lady Hervey's are for M. le Comte de Caylus, and Madame Geoffrin. The Duke received me civilly, but (perhaps through Maty's fault) treated me more as a man of letters than as a man of fashion. His letters are entirely in that style; for the Count de Caylus and M. M. de la Bleterie, de S<SUP>te</SUP> Palaye, Ca∣peronier, du Clos, de Forcemagne, and d'Alembert. I then undressed for the play. My father and I went to the Rose, in the passage of the play-house, where we found Mallet, with about thirty friends. We dined together, and went thence into the pit, where we took our places in a body, ready to silence all opposition. How∣ever, we had no occasion to exert ourselves. Notwithstanding the malice of party, Mallet's nation, connections, and, indeed, imprudence, we heard nothing but ap∣plause. I think it was deserved. The plan was borrowed from de la Motte, but the details and language have great merit. A sine vein of dramatic poetry runs through the piece. The scenes between the father and son awaken almost every sensation of the human breast; and the counsel would have equally moved, but for the inconve∣nience unavoidable upon all theatres, that of entrusting fine speeches to indifferent actors. The perplexity of the catastrophe is much, and I believe justly, criticised. But another defect made a stronger impression upon me. When a poet ventures upon the dreadful situation of a father who condemns his son to death, there is no medium, the father must either be a monster or a hero. His obligations of justice, of the public good, must be as binding, as apparent, as perhaps those of the first Brutus. The cruel necessity consecrates his actions, and leaves no room for re∣pentance. The thought is shocking, if not carried into action. In the execution of Brutus's sons I am sensible of that fatal necessity. Without such an example, the unsettled liberty of Rome would have perished the instant after its birth. But Alonzo might have pardoned his son for a rash attempt, the cause of which was a private in∣jury, and whose consequences could never have disturbed an established government. He might have pardoned such a crime in any other subject; and as the laws could exact only an equal rigour for a son, a vain appetite for glory, and a mad assectation of he∣roism, could alone have influenced him to exert an unequal and superior severity.</P></NOTE>; a post∣chaise

conveyed me to Dover, the packet to Boulogne, and such was
my diligence, that I reached Paris on the 28th of January 1763,
only thirty-six days after the disbanding of the militia. Two or
three years were loosely defined for the term of my absence; and I
was left at liberty to spend that time in such places and in such a
manner as was most agreeable to my taste and judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="138"/>
In this first visit I passed three months and a half, (January 28
—May 9,) and a much longer space might have been agreeably
filled, without any intercourse with the natives. At home we are
content to move in the daily round of pleasure and business; and a
scene which is always present is supposed to be within our know∣ledge,
or at least within our power. But in a foreign country, cu∣riosity
is our business and our pleasure; and the traveller, conscious
of his ignorance, and covetous of his time, is diligent in the search
and the view of every object that can deserve his attention. I de∣voted
many hours of the morning to the circuit of Paris and the
neighbourhood, to the visit of churches and palaces conspicuous by
their architecture, to the royal manufactures, collections of books
and pictures, and all the various treasures of art, of learning, and of
luxury. An Englishman may hear without reluctance, that in these
curious and costly articles Paris is superior to London; since the opu∣lence
of the French capital arises from the defects of its government
and religion. In the absence of Louis XIV. and his successors, the
Louvre has been left unfinished: but the millions which have been
lavished on the sands of Versailles, and the morass of Marli, could
not be supplied by the legal allowance of a British king. The splen∣dour
of the French nobles is confined to their town residence; that
of the English is more usefully distributed in their country feats;
and we should be astonished at our own riches, if the labours of
architecture, the spoils of Italy and Greece, which are now scattered
from Inverary to Wilton, were accumulated in a few streets between
Marybone and Westminster. All superfluous ornament is rejected
by the cold frugality of the protestants; but the catholic supersti∣tion,
which is always the enemy of reason, is often the parent of
the arts. The wealthy communities of priests and monks expend
their revenues in stately edifices; and the parish church of St. Sul∣pice,
one of the noblest structures in Paris, was built and adorned
<PB N="114" REF="139"/>
by the private industry of a late curé. In this outset, and still more
in the sequel of my tour, my eye was amused; but the pleasing
vision cannot be fixed by the pen; the particular images are darkly
seen through the medium of five-and-twenty years, and the nar∣rative
of my life must not degenerate into a book of travels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, 21 Fevrier 1763.]—Aujourdhui j'ai commencé ma tournée, pour voir les endroits dignes d'attention dans la ville. D'Augny m'a accompagné. Nous sommes allés d'abord à la bibliotheque de l'Abbayé de St. Germain des Prez, où tout le monde étoit occupé à l'arrangement d'un cabinet de curiosités, et à l'hòpital des in∣valides, où le dòme étoit fermé à cause des reparations qu'on y faisoit. Il faut donc differer la visite et la description de ces deux endroits. De là nous sommes allés voir l'école militaire. Comme ce bâtiment s'éleve à coté des Invalides, bien des gens y verroient un moyen assez facile d'apprecier les ames differentes de leurs fondateurs. Dans l'un tout est grand et fastueux, dans l'autre tout est petit et mesquin. De petits corps de logis blancs et assez propres, qui, au lieu de 500 gentilshommes, dont on a parlé, en con∣tiennent 258, composent tout l'etablissement; car le manége et les ecuries ne sont rien. Il est vrai qu'on dit que ces batimens ne sont qu'un échaffaudage, qu'on doit ôter, pour élever le véritable ouvrage sur ces débris. Il faut bien en effet qu'on n'ait pas bâti pour l'éternité, puisque dans vingt ans la plûpart des poutres se font pourries. Nous jettâmes ensuite un coup d'oeil sur l'église de St. Sulpice, dont la façade (le prétexte et le fruit de tant de lotteries) n'est point encore achevée.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the principal end of my journey was to enjoy the society
of a polished and amiable people, in whose favour I was strongly
prejudiced, and to converse with some authors, whose conversation,
as I fondly imagined, must be far more pleasing and instructive than
their writings. The moment was happily chosen. At the close of
a successful war the British name was respected on the continent.</P>

<L>Gentibus.</L></Q>
<P>Our opinions, our fashions, even our games, were adopted in
France, a ray of national glory illuminated each individual, and
every Englishman was supposed to be born a patriot and a philoso∣pher.
For myself, I carried a personal recommendation; my name and
my Essay were already known; the compliment of having written in
<PB N="115" REF="140"/>
the French language entitled me to some returns of civility and
gratitude. I was considered as a man of letters, who wrote
for amusement. Before my departure I had obtained from the
Duke de Nivernois, Lady Hervey, the Mallets, Mr. Walpole, &amp;c.
many letters of recommendation to their private or literary friends.
Of these epistles the reception and success were determined by
the character and situation of the persons by whom and to whom
they were addressed: the seed was sometimes cast on a barren
rock, and it sometimes multiplied an hundred fold in the pro∣duction
of new shoots, spreading branches, and exquisite fruit.
But upon the whole, I had reason to praise the national urbanity,
which from the court has diffused its gentle influence to the shop,
the cottage, and the schools. Of the men of genius of the age,
Montesquieu and Fontenelle were no more; Voltaire resided on his
own estate near Geneva; Rousseau in the preceding year had been
driven from his hermitage of Montmorency; and I blush at my
having neglected to seek, in this journey, the acquaintance of Buffon.
Among the men of letters whom I saw, D'Alembert and Diderot
held the foremost rank in merit, or at least in fame. I shall content
myself with enumerating the well-known names of the Count de
Caylus, of the Abbé de la Bleterie, Barthelemy, Reynal, Arnaud,
of Messieurs de la Condamine, du Clos, de S<SUP>te</SUP> Palaye, de Bougainville,
Caperonnier, de Guignes, Suard, &amp;c. without attempting to discri∣minate
the shades of their characters, or the degrees of our connec∣tion.
Alone, in a morning visit, I commonly found the artists and
authors of Paris less vain, and more reasonable, than in the circles
of their equals, with whom they mingle in the houses of the rich.
Four days in a week I had a place, without invitation, at the hos∣pitable
tables of Mesdames Geoffrin and du Bocage, of the cele∣brated
Helvetius, and of the Baron d'Olbach. In these symposia
the pleasures of the table were improved by lively and liberal con∣versation;
<PB N="116" REF="141"/>
the company was select, though various and volun∣tary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, Fevrier 23, 1763.]—Je sis une visite à l'Abbé de la Bleterie, qui veut me mener chez la Duchesse d'Aiguillon; je me fis ecrire chez M. de Bougainville que j'ai grande envie de connoitre, et me rendis ensuite chez le Baron d'Olbach, ami de M. Helvetius. C'etoit ma premiére visite, et le premier pas dans une fort bonne maison. Le Baron a de l'esprit et des connoissances, et surtout il donne souvent et fort bien à diner.</P>
<P>Fevrier 24.]—L'Abbé Barthelemy est fort aimable et n'a de l'antiquaire qu'une très grande érudition. Je finis la soirée par un souper très agréable chez Madame Bontems avec M. le Marquis de Mirabeau.

Je lui ai fait beau∣coup de questions sur les titres de la noblesse Francoise; mais tout ce que j'en ai pu com∣prendre, c'est que personne n'a là dessus des idées bien nettes.</P>
<P>Mai 1763.]—Muni d'une double lettre de recommandation pour M. le Comte de Caylus, je m'etois imaginé que je trouverois reunis en lui l'homme de lettres et l'homme de qualité. Je le vis trois ou quatre fois, et je vis un homme simple, uni, bon, et qui me temoignoit une bonté extrème. Si je n'en ai point profité, je l'attribue moins à son caractére qu'à son genre de vie. Il se leve de grand matin, court les atteliers des artistes pendant tout le jour, et rentre chez lui à six heurs du soir pour se mettre en robe de chambre, et s'enfermer dans son cabinet. Le moyen de voir ses amis?</P>
<P>Si ces recommendations etoient steriles, il y en eut d'autres que devìnrent aussi fécondes par leurs fuites, qu'elles etoient agréables èn elles mêmes. Dans une capitale comme Paris, il est necessaire, il est juste que des lettres de recommendation vous ayent distingué de la soule. Mais dèsque la glace est rompue, vos connoissances se multiplient, et vos nouveaux amis se font un plaisir de vous en procurer d'autres plus nouveaux encore. Heureux effet de ce caractere leger et aimable du François, qui a établi dans Paris une douceur et une liberté dans la société, inconnues à l'antiquité, et encore ignorées des autres nations. A Londres il faut faire son chemin dans les maisons que ne s'ouvrent qu'avec peine. Là on croit vous faire plaisir en vous rece∣vant. Ici on croit s'en faire à soi-meme. Aussi je connois plus de maisons à Paris qu'à Londres: le fait n'est pas vraisemblable, mais il est vrai.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The society of Madame du Bocage was more soft and moderate
than that of her rivals, and the evening conversations of M. de
Foncemagne were supported by the good sense and learning of the
principal members of the Academy of Inscriptions. The opera and
the Italians I occasionally visited; but the French theatre, both in
<PB N="117" REF="142"/>
tragedy and comedy, was my daily and favourite amusement. Two
famous actresses then divided the public applause. For my own
part, I preferred the consummate art of the Clairon, to the intem∣perate
sallies of the Dumesnil, which were extolled by her admirers,
as the genuine voice of nature and passion. Fourteen weeks in∣sensibly
stole away; but had I been rich and independent, I should
have prolonged, and perhaps have fixed, my residence at Paris.</P>
<P>Between the expensive style of Paris and of Italy it was prudent
to interpose some months of tranquil simplicity; and at the thoughts
of Lausanne I again lived in the pleasures and studies of my early
youth. Shaping my course through Dijon and Besançon, in the
last of which places I was kindly entertained by my cousin Acton, I
arrived in the month of May 1763 on the banks of the Leman
Lake. It had been my intention to pass the Alps in the autumn,
but such are the simple attractions of the place, that the year had
almost expired before my departure from Lausanne in the ensuing
spring. An absence of five years had not made much alteration in
manners, or even in persons. My old friends, of both sexes, hailed
my voluntary return; the most genuine proof of my attachment.
They had been flattered by the present of my book, the produce of
their soil; and the good Pavilliard shed tears of joy as he embraced
a pupil, whose literary merit he might fairly impute to his own
labours. To my old list I added some new acquaintance, and among
the strangers I shall distinguish Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg, the
brother of the reigning Duke, at whose country-house, near Lau∣sanne,
I frequently dined: a wandering meteor, and at length a
falling star, his light and ambitious spirit had successively dropped
from the firmament of Prussia, of France, and of Austria; and his
faults, which he stiled his misfortunes, had driven him into philoso∣phic
exile in the Pais de Vaud. He could now moralize on the va∣nity
of the world, the equality of mankind, and the happiness of
a private station. His address was affable and polite, and as he had
<PB N="118" REF="143"/>
shone in courts and armies, his memory could supply, and his elo∣quence
could adorn, a copious fund of interesting anecdotes. His
first enthusiasm was that of charity and agriculture; but the sage
gradually lapsed in the saint, and Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg is
now buried in a hermitage near Mayence, in the last stage of mystic
devotion. By some ecclesiastical quarrel, Voltaire had been pro∣voked
to withdraw himself from Lausanne, and retire to his castle
at Ferney, where I again visited the poet and the actor, without
seeking his more intimate acquaintance, to which I might now have
pleaded a better title. But the theatre which he had founded, the
actors whom he had formed, survived the loss of their master; and
recent from Paris, I attended with pleasure at the representation of
several tragedies and comedies. I shall not descend to specify par∣ticular
names and characters; but I cannot forget a private institu∣tion,
which will display the innocent freedom of Swiss manners.
My favourite society had assumed, from the age of its members, the
proud denomination of the spring (<HI>la société du printems</HI>). It
consisted of fifteen or twenty young unmarried ladies, of genteel,
though not of the very first families; the eldest perhaps about
twenty, all agreeable, several handsome, and two or three of ex∣quisite
beauty. At each other's houses they assembled almost every day,
without the controul, or even the presence, of a mother or an aunt;
they were trusted to their own prudence, among a crowd of young
men of every nation in Europe. They laughed, they sung, they
danced, they played at cards, they acted comedies; but in the midst
of this careless gaiety, they respected themselves, and were respected
by the men; the invisible line between liberty and licentiousness was
never trangressed by a gesture, a word, or a look, and their virgin
chastity was never sullied by the breath of scandal or suspicion. A
singular institution, expressive of the innocent simplicity of Swiss man∣ners.
After having tasted the luxury of England and Paris, I could not
have returned with satisfaction to the coarse and homely table of Ma∣dame
<PB N="119" REF="144"/>
Pavilliard; nor was her husband offended that I now entered my∣self
as a <HI>pensionaire,</HI> or boarder, in the elegant house of Mr. De Mesery,
which may be entitled to a short remembrance, as it has stood above
twenty years, perhaps, without a parallel in Europe. The house in
which we lodged was spacious and convenient, in the best street, and
commanding, from behind, a noble prospect over the country and the
Lake. Our table was served with neatness and plenty; the boarders
were select; we had the liberty of inviting any guests at a stated
price; and in the summer the scene was occasionally transferred to
a pleasant villa, about a league from Lausanne. The characters of
Master and Mistress were happily suited to each other, and to their
situation. At the age of seventy-five, Madame de Mesery, who
has survived her husband, is still a graceful, I had almost said a
handsome woman. She was alike qualified to preside in her kitchen
and her drawing-room; and such was the equal propriety of her con∣duct,
that of two or three hundred foreigners, none ever failed in
respect, none could complain of her neglect, and none could ever
boast of her favour. Mesery himself, of the noble family of De
Crousaz, was a man of the world, a jovial companion, whose easy
manners and natural fallies maintained the cheerfulness of his house.
His wit could laugh at his own ignorance: he disguised, by an air
of profusion, a strict attention to his interest; and in this situ∣ation,
he appeared like a nobleman who spent his fortune and enter∣tained
his friends. In this agreeable society I resided nearly eleven
months (May 1763—April 1764); and in this second visit to Lau∣sanne,
among a crowd of my English companions, I knew and
esteemed Mr. Holroyd (now Lord Sheffield); and our mutual at∣tachment
was renewed and fortified in the subsequent stages of our
Italian journey. Our lives are in the power of chance, and a slight
variation on either side, in time or place, might have deprived me
of a friend, whose activity in the ardour of youth was always

Point d'affaires, point d'assemblée; on s'interdit jusqu'au <HI>whist</HI> si nécessaire a l'existence d'un Lausannois.</P>
<P>Décembre 31<SUP>me</SUP>.]—Jettons un coup d'oeil sur cette année 1763. Voyons com∣ment j'ai employé cette portion de mon existence qui s'est écoulée et qui ne re∣viendra plus. Le mois de Janvier s'est passé dans le sein de ma famille à qui il falloit sacrifier tous mes momens, parcequ'ils étoient les derniers dans les soins d'un départ et dans l'embarras d'un voyage. Dans ce voyage cependant je trouvai moyen de lire les lettres de <HI>Busbequius,</HI> Ministre Imperial à la Porte. Elles sont aussi inté∣ressantes qu'instructives. Je restai à Paris depuis le 28 JANVIER jusqu'au 9 MAI. Pendant tout ce tems je n'étudiai point. Les amusements m'occupoient beaucoup, et l'habitude de la dissipation, qu'on prend si facilement dans les grandes villes, ne me per∣mettoient pas de mettre à prosit le tems qui me demeuroit. A la verité, si j'ai peu feuilleté les livres, l'observation de tous les objets curieux qui se presentent dans une grande capitale, et la conversation avec les plus grands hommes du siécle, m'ont instruit de beaucoup de choses que je n'aurois point trouvé dans les livres. Les sept ou huit derniers mois de cette année ont été plus tranquilles. Dès que je me suis vu etabli à Lausanne, j'ai entrepris une étude suivie sur la géographie ancienne de l'Italie. Mon ardeur s'est très bien foutenue pendant six semaines jusqu'à la fin du mois de Juin. Ce fut alors qu'un voyage de Geneve interrompit un peu mon assiduité, que le sejour de Mesery m'ossrit mille distractions, et que la société de Saussure acheva de me faire perdre mon tems. Je repris mon travail avec ce Journal au milieu <HI>d'Aout,</HI> et depuis ce tems, jusqu'au commencement de <HI>Novembre,</HI> j'ai mis a profit tous mes instans; j'avoue que pendant les deux derniers mois mon ardeur s'est un peu rallantie. I<SUP>reme•t</SUP>, Dans cette étude suivie j'ai lu: 1. Près de deux livres de la géographie de <HI>Strabon</HI> sur l'Italie deux fois. 2. Une partie du deuxiéme livre de l'histoire naturelle de <HI>Pline.</HI> 3. Le quatriéme chapitre du deuxiéme livre de <HI>Pomponius Mela.</HI> 4. Les Itineraires d'Antonin, et de Jerusalem pour ce qui regarde l'Italie. Je les ai lus avec les Commentaires de Wesseling, &amp;c. J'en ai tiré des tables de toutes les grandes routes de l'Italie, reduisant partout les milles Romains, en milles Anglois, et en lieues de France, selon les calculs de M. d'Anville. 5. L'Histoire des Grands Chemins de l'Empire Romain, par M. Bergier, deux volumes in 4<SUP>o</SUP>. 5. Quelques Extraits choisis de Ciceron, Tite Live, Velleius Paterculus, Tacite, et les deux Plines. La <HI>Roma Vetus</HI> de Nardini et plu∣sieurs autres opuscules sur le même sujet qui composent presque tout le quatriéme tome du Tresor des Antiquités Romaines de Graevius. 7. L'<HI>Italia Antiqua</HI> de Cluvier, en deux volumes in folio. 8. L'<HI>Iter</HI> ou le Voyage de Cl. Rutillius Numatianus dans les Gaules. 9. Les Catalogues de Virgile. 10. Celui de Silius Italicus. 11. Le Voyage d'Horace a Brundusium. N. B. J'ai lu deux fois ces trois deruiers morceaux. 12. Le Traité sur les Mesures Itineraires par M. d'Anville, et quelques Memoires de l'Academie des Belles Lettres. II<SUP>ment</SUP>, On me fit attendre Nardini de la Bibliotheque de Geneve. Je voulus remplir ce moment de vuide par la lecture de <HI>Juvenal,</HI> poëte qui je ne con∣noissois encore que de réputation. Je le lu deux fois avec plaisir et avec soin. III<SUP>ment</SUP>, Pendant l'année j'ai lu quelques journaux, entre autres le Journal Etranger depuis son commencement, un tome des Nouvelles de Bayle, et les xxxv premiers volumes de la Bibliotheque raisonnée. IV<SUP>ment</SUP>, J'ai beaucoup ecrit de mon Recueil Géographique de l'Italie qui est deja bien ample et assez curieux. V<SUP>ment</SUP>, Je ne dois point oublier ce journal même qui est devenu un ouvrage; 214 pages en quatre mois et demi et des pages des mieux fournies font un objet considerable. Aussi sans compter un grand nombre d'observations détachées, il s'y trouve des dissertations savantes et raisonées. Celle du passage d'Annibal contient dix pages, et celle sur le guerre sociale en a douze. Mais ces morceaux sont trop etendus, et le journal même a besoin d'une reforme qui lui retranche quantité de pieces qui sont assez étrangeres à son veritable plan. Après avoir un peu reflechi là dessus, voici quelques regles que je me suis faites sur les objets qui lui conviennent. I<SUP>ment</SUP>, Toute ma vie civile et privée, mes amusemens, mes liaisons, mes ecarts même, et toutes mes réfléxions qui ne roulent que sur des sujets qui me sont personels, je conviens que tout cela n'est interessant que pour moi, mais aussi ce n'est que pour moi que j'ecris mon journal. II<SUP>ment</SUP>, Tout ce que j'apprens par l'observation ou la conversation. A l'egard de celle-ci je ne rapporterai que ce que je tiens de per∣sonnes tout à la sois instruites et véridiques, lorsqu'il est question de faits, ou du petit nombre de ceux qui meritent le titre de grand homme, s'il s'agit de sentimens et d'opi∣nions. III<SUP>ment</SUP>, J'y mettrai soigneusement tout ce qu'on peut appeller la partie ma∣terielle de mes études; combien d'heures j'ai travaillé, combien de pages j'ai ecrit ou lu, avec une courte notice du sujet qu'elles contenoient. IV<SUP>ment</SUP>, Je serois faché de lire fans réfléchir sur mes lectures, sans porter des jugemens raisonnés sur mes auteurs, et sans éplucher avec soin leurs idées et leurs expressions. Mais toute lecture ne fournit pas egalement. Il y a des livres qu'on parcourt, et il y en a qu'on lit; il y en a enfin qu'on doit étudier. Mes observations sur ceux de la premiere classe no peuvent qu'etre courtes et detachées. Elles conviennent au journal. Celles qui re∣gardent la seconde classe n'y entreront qu'autant qu'elles auront le même caractère. V<SUP>ment</SUP>, Mes réfléxions sur ce petit nombre d'auteurs classiques, qu'on medite avec soin, seront naturellement plus approfondies et plus suivies. C'est pour elles, et pour des pieces plus etendues et plus originales, aux quelles la lecture ou la meditation peut donner lieu, que je serai un recueil séparé. Je conserverai cependant fa liaison avec le journal par des renvois constans qui marqueront le numero de chaque piece avec le tems et l'occasion de sa composition. Moyennant ces précautions mon journal ne peut que m'ètre utile. Ce compte exact de mon tems m'en sera mieux sentir le prix; il dissi∣pera par son detail, l'illusion qu'on se fait d'invisager seulement les années et les mois et de mepriser les heures et les jours. Je ne dis rien de l'agrément. C'en est un bien grand cependant de pouvoir repasser chaque epoque de sa vie, et de se placer, dès qu'on le veut, au milieu de toutes les petites scenes qu'on a joué, ou qu'on a vu jouer.</P>

If my studies at Paris had been consined to the study of the world,
three or four months would not have been unprofitably spent. My
<PB N="122" REF="147"/>
visits, however superficial, to the Academy of Medals and the public
libraries, opened a new field of inquiry; and the view of so many
<PB N="123" REF="148"/>
manuscripts of different ages and characters induced me to consult the
two great Benedictine works, the <HI>Diplomatica</HI> of Mabillon, and the
<HI>Palaeographia</HI> of Montfaucon. I'studied the theory without attain∣ing
the practice of the art: nor should I complain of the intricacy of
<PB N="124" REF="149"/>
Greek abbreviations and Gothic alphabets, since every day, in a fa∣miliar
language, I am at a loss to decypher the hieroglyphics of a
female note. In a tranquil scene, which revived the memory of my
first studies, idleness would have been less pardonable: the public
libraries of Lausanne and Geneva liberally supplied me with books;
and if many hours were lost in dissipation, many more were em∣ployed
in literary labour. In the country, Horace and Virgil, Ju∣venal
and Ovid, were my assiduous companions: but, in town, I
formed and executed a plan of study for the use of my Transalpine
expedition: the topography of old Rome, the ancient geography of
Italy, and the science of medals. 1. I diligently read, almost always
with my pen in my hand, the elaborate treatises of Nardini, Donatus,
&amp;c. which fill the fourth volume of the Roman Antiquities of
Graevius. 2. I next undertook and finished the <HI>Italia Antiqua</HI> of
Cluverius, a learned native of Prussia, who had measured, on foot,
every spot, and has compiled and digested every passage of the
ancient writers. These passages in Greek or Latin authors I perused
in the text of Cluverius, in two folio volumes: but I separately read
the descriptions of Italy by Strabo, Pliny, and Pomponius Mela, the
Catalogues of the Epic poets, the Itineraries of Wesseling's Anto∣ninus,
and the coasting Voyage of Rutilius Numatianus; and I studied
two kindred subjects in the Mesures Itineraires of d'Anville, and the
copious work of Bergier, <HI>Histoire des grands Chemins de l'Empire
Romain.</HI> From these materials I formed a table of roads and distances
reduced to our English measure; filled a folio common-place book
with my collections and remarks on the geography of Italy; and in∣ferted
in my journal many long and learned notes on the insulae and
populousness of Rome, the social war, the passage of the Alps by
Hannibal, &amp;c. 3. After glancing my eye over Addison's agreeable
dialogues, I more seriously read the great work of Ezechiel Spanheim
<HI>de Praestantiâ et Usù Numismatum,</HI> and applied with him the medals
<PB N="125" REF="150"/>
of the kings and emperors, the families and colonies, to the illustration
of ancient history. And thus was I armed for my Italian journey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>JOURNAL, Lausanne, Avril 17, 1764.]—Guise et moi, nous avons donné un diner excellent et beaucoup de vin à Dupleix, et à beaucoup d'autres.

<P>Je quitte Lausanne avec moins de regret que la première fois. Je n'y laisse plus que des connoissances. C'etoit la maitresse et l'ami dont je pleurois la perte. D'ail∣lieurs je voyois Lausanne avec les yeux encore novices d'un jeune homme, qui lui devoit la partie raisonable de fon existence, et qui jugeoit fans objets de compa∣raison. Aujourdhui j'y vois une ville mal batie, au milieu d'un pays delicieux, qui jouit de la paix et du repos, et qui les prend pour la liberté. Un peuple nombreux et bien élevé, qui aime la société, qui y est propre, et qui admet avec plaisir les étrangers dans ses cotteries, qui seroient bien plus agréables, si la conversation n'avoit pas cédé la place au jeu. Les semmes sont jolies, et malgré leur grande liberté, elles sont très sages. Tout au plus peuvent elles être un peu complaisantes, dans l'idée honnête, mais incertaine, de rendre un étranger dans leurs silets. L'affectation est le péché originel des Lausannois. Affectation de depense, affectation de noblesse, affectation d'esprit: les deux premiéres sont fort repandues, pendant que la troisiéme est fort rare. Comme ce vice se choque a tout instant avec celui des autres, Lausanne se trouve partagée dans un grand nombre d'etats, dont les principes et le langage varient a l'infini, et qui n'ont de commun que leur mepris reciproque les uns pour les autres. Leur gout pour la depense s'accorde mal avec celui de la noblesse. Ils périroient plutot que de renoncer a leurs grandeurs, ou d'embrasser la seule profession qui puisse les y soutenir. La maison de M. De Mesery est charmante: le caractére franc et genereux du Mari, les agrémens de la femme, une situation délicieuse, une chere ex∣cellente, la compagnie de ses compatriotes, et une liberté parfaite, font aimer ce séjour a tout Anglois. Que je voudrois en trouver un semblable a Londres! J'y regrette encore Holroyd, mais il nous suit de près.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I shall advance with rapid brevity in the narrative of this tour, in
which somewhat more than a year (April 1764—May 1765) was
agreeably employed. Content with tracing my line of march, and
slightly touching on my personal feelings, I shall wave the minute
investigation of the scenes which have been viewed by thousands,
and described by hundreds, of our modern travellers. ROME is the
<PB N="126" REF="151"/>
great object of our pilgrimage: and 1st, the journey; 2d, the resi∣dence;
and 3d, the return; will form the most proper and perspi∣cuous
division. 1. I climbed Mount Cenis, and descended into the
plain of Piedmont, not on the back of an elephant, but on a light
osier seat, in the hands of the dextrous and intrepid chairmen of the
Alps. The architecture and government of Turin presented the
same aspect of tame and tiresome uniformity: but the court was re∣gulated
with decent and splendid oeconomy; and I was introduced
to his Sardinian majesty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, No. XII.</NOTE> Charles Emanuel, who, after the incom∣parable
Frederic, held the second rank (proximus longo tamen inter∣vallo)
among the kings of Europe. The size and populousness of
Milan could not surprise an inhabitant of London: but the fancy is
amused by a visit to the Boromean Islands, an enchanted palace, a
work of the fairies in the midst of a lake encompassed with moun∣tains,
and far removed from the haunts of men. I was less amused
by the marble palaces of Genoa, than by the recent memorials of her
deliverance (in December 1746) from the Austrian tyranny; and I
took a military survey of every scene of action within the inclosure
of her double walls. My steps were detained at Parma and Modena,
by the precious relics of the Farnese and Este collections: but, alas!
the far greater part had been already transported, by inheritance or
purchase, to Naples and Dresden. By the road of Bologna and the
Apennine I at last reached Florence, where I reposed from June to
September, during the heat of the summer months. In the Gallery,
and especially in the Tribune, I first acknowledged, at the feet of
the Venus of Medicis, that the chissel may dispute the pre-eminence
with the pencil, a truth in the fine arts which cannot on this side of
the Alps be felt or understood. At home I had taken some lessons
of Italian: on the spot I read, with a learned native, the classics of
the Tuscan idiom: but the shortness of my time, and the use of the
<PB N="127" REF="152"/>
French language, prevented my acquiring any facility of speaking;
and I was a silent spectator in the conversations of our envoy, Sir
Horace Mann, whose most serious business was that of entertaining
the English at his hospitable table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOURNAL, Florence, Aout 9<SUP>me</SUP>, 1764.]—Cocchi à diné avec nous. Nous avons beaucoup causé, mais je ne lui trouve pas le genie qu'on lui attribue, c'est peutêtre, parceque les notres ne sont pas analogues. J'entrevois de l'extravagance dans ses idées, de l'affectation dans ses maniéres. Il se plaint à tout moment de sa pauvreté. Il connoit peu la veritable dignité d'un homme de lettres. S'il a beaucoup de science, elle est bornée à la physique. Il m'a demandé si Lord Spenser ne pouvoit pas faire des éveques, et m'a fait un conte de Lord Lyttelton (dont il ne peut souffrir le fils) ou il étoit question des Parlemens de Campagne.</NOTE>. After leaving Florence, I com∣pared
the solitude of Pisa with the industry of Lucca and Leghorn,
and continued my journey through Sienna to Rome, where I arrived
in the beginning of October. 2. My temper is not very susceptible
of enthusiasm; and the enthusiasm which I do not feel, I have ever
scorned to affect. But, at the distance of twenty-five years, I can
neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my
mind as I first approached and entered the <HI>eternal city.</HI> After a sleep∣less
night, I trod, with a lofty step, the ruins of the Forum; each
memorable spot where Romulus <HI>stood,</HI> or Tully spoke, or Caesar fell,
was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication
were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute in∣vestigation.
My guide was Mr. Byers, a Scotch antiquary of experi∣ence
and taste; but, in the daily labour of eighteen weeks, the
powers of attention were sometimes fatigued, till I was myself qua∣lified,
in a last review, to select and study the capital works of
ancient and modern art. Six weeks were borrowed for my tour of
Naples, the most populous of cities, relative to its size, whose luxu∣rious
inhabitants seem to dwell on the consines of paradise and hell∣sire.
I was presented to the boy-king by our new envoy, Sir William
Hamilton; who, wisely diverting his correspondence from the Se∣cretary
of State to the Royal Society and British Museum, has eluci∣dated
<PB N="128" REF="153"/>
a country of such inestimable value to the naturalist and anti∣quarian.
On my return, I fondly embraced, for the last time, the
miracles of Rome; but I departed without kissing the feet of Rezzo∣nico
(Clement XIII.), who neither possessed the wit of his prede∣cessor
Lambertini, nor the virtues of his successor Ganganelli. 3. In
my pilgrimage from Rome to Loretto I again crossed the Apennine;
from the coast of the Adriatic I traversed a fruitful and populous
country, which could alone disprove the paradox of Montesquieu,
that modern Italy is a desert. Without adopting the exclusive pre∣judice
of the natives, I sincerely admire the paintings of the Bologna
school. I hastened to escape from the sad solitude of Ferrara, which
in the age of Caesar was still more desolate. The spectacle of Ve∣nice
afforded some hours of astonishment; the university of Padua
is a dying taper: but Verona still boasts her amphitheatre, and his
native Vicenza is adorned by the classic architecture of Palladio:
the road of Lombardy and Piedmont (did Montesquieu find them
without inhabitants?) led me back to Milan, Turin, and the passage
of Mount Cenis, where I again crossed the Alps in my way to
Lyons.</P>
<P>The use of foreign travel has been often debated as a general
question; but the conclusion must be finally applied to the character
and circumstances of each individual. With the education of boys,
<HI>where</HI> or <HI>how</HI> they may pass over some juvenile years with the least
mischief to themselves or others, I have no concern. But after sup∣posing
the previous and indispensable requisites of age, judgment, a
competent knowledge of men and books, and a freedom from do∣mestic
prejudices, I will briefly describe the qualifications which I
deem most essential to a traveller. He should be endowed with
an active, indefatigable vigour of mind and body, which can seize
every mode of conveyance, and support, with a careless smile, every
hardship of the road, the weather, or the inn. The benefits of foreign
travel will correspond with the degrees of these qualifications; but,
<PB N="129" REF="154"/>
in this sketch, those to whom I am known will not accuse me of
framing my own panegyric. It was at Rome, on the 15th of Octo∣ber
1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the
bare-footed fryars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now the church of the Zoccolants, or Franciscan Friars.</NOTE>,
that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to
my mind. But my original plan was circumscribed to the decay of
the city rather than of the empire: and, though my reading and re∣flections
began to point towards that object, some years elapsed, and
several avocations intervened, before I was seriously engaged in the
execution of that laborious work.</P>
<P>I had not totally renounced the southern provinces of France, but
the letters which I found at Lyons were expressive of some impa∣tience.
Rome and Italy had satiared my curious appetite, and I was
now ready to return to the peaceful retreat of my family and books.
After a happy fortnight I reluctantly left Paris, embarked at Calais,
again landed at Dover, after an interval of two years and five months,
and hastily drove through the summer dust and solitude of London.
On the 25th of June 1765 I arrived at my father's house: and the
five years and a half between my travels and my father's death (1770)
are the portion of my life which I passed with the least enjoyment,
and which I remember with the least satisfaction. Every spring I
attended the monthly meeting and exercise of the militia at South∣ampton;
and by the resignation of my father, and the death of Sir
Thomas Worsley, I was successively promoted to the rank of major
and lieutenant-colonel commandant: but I was each year more dis∣gusted
with the inn, the wine, the company, and the tiresome repe∣tition
of annual attendance and daily exercise. At home, the oeco∣nomy
of the family and farm still maintained the same creditable ap∣pearance.
My connection with Mrs. Gibbon was mellowed into a
warm and solid attachment: my growing years abolished the distance
<PB N="130" REF="155"/>
that might yet remain between a parent and a son, and my beha∣viour
satisfied my father, who was proud of the success, however
imperfect in his own life-time, of my literary talents. Our soli∣tude
was soon and often enlivened by the visit of the friend of my
youth, Mr. Deyverdun, whose absence from Lausanne I had sincerely
lamented. About three years after my first departure, he had emi∣grated
from his native lake to the banks of the Oder in Germany.
The <HI>res angusta domi,</HI> the waste of a decent patrimony, by an impro∣vident
father, obliged him, like many of his countrymen, to con∣fide
in his own industry; and he was entrusted with the education
of a young prince, the grandson of the Margrave of Schavedt, of
the Royal Family of Prussia. Our friendship was never cooled, our
correspondence was sometimes interrupted; but I rather wished than
hoped to obtain Mr. Deyverdun for the companion of my Italian
tour. An unhappy, though honourable passion, drove him from his
German court; and the attractions of hope and curiosity were for∣tified
by the expectation of my speedy return to England. During
four successive summers he passed several weeks or months at Beri∣ton,
and our free conversations, on every topic that could interest
the heart or understanding, would have reconciled me to a desert or
a prison. In the winter months of London my sphere of know∣ledge
and action was somewhat enlarged, by the many new ac∣quaintance
which I had contracted in the militia and abroad; and I
must regret, as more than an acquaintance, Mr. Godfrey Clarke of
Derbyshire, an amiable and worthy young man, who was snatched
away by an untimely death. A weekly convivial meeting was esta∣blished
by myself and travellers, under the name of the Roman
Club<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members were Lord Mountstuart (now Earl of Bute), Colonel Edmonstone, Weddal, Palgrave, Lord Berkley, Godfrey Clarke, Holroyd (Lord Shesfield), Major Ridley, Sir William Guize, Sir John Aubrey, Lord Abingdon, Hon. Peregrine Bertie, Cleaver, Hon. John Damer, Hon. George Damer (Lord Milton), Sir Thomas Gas∣coygne, Sir John Hort, E. Gibbon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="156"/>
The renewal, or perhaps the improvement, of my English life
was embittered by the alteration of my own feelings. At the age
of twenty-one I was, in my proper station of a youth, delivered
from the yoke of education, and delighted with the comparative
state of liberty and affluence. My silial obedience was natural and
easy; and in the gay prospect of futurity, my ambition did not ex∣tend
beyond the enjoyment of my books, my leisure, and my pa∣trimonial
estate, undisturbed by the cares of a family and the duties
of a profession. But in the militia I was armed with power; in my
travels, I was exempt from controul; and as I approached, as I
gradually passed my thirtieth year, I began to feel the desire of
being master in my own house. The most gentle authority will
sometimes frown without reason, the most cheerful submission will
sometimes murmur without cause; and such is the law of our im∣perfect
nature, that we must either command or obey; that our
personal liberty is supported by the obsequiousness of our own de∣pendants.
While so many of my acquaintance were married or in
parliament, or advancing with a rapid step in the various roads of
honour and fortune, I stood alone, immoveable and insignificant;
for after the monthly meeting of 1770, I had even withdrawn my∣self
from the militia, by the resignation of an empty and barren
commission. My temper is not susceptible of envy, and the view
of successful merit has always excited my warmest applause. The
miseries of a vacant life were never known to a man whose hours
were insufficient for the inexhaustible pleasures of study. But I
lamented that at the proper age I had not embraced the lucrative
pursuits of the law or of trade, the chances of civil office or India
adventure, or even the fat slumbers of the church; and my repent∣ance
became more lively as the loss of time was more irretrievable.
Experience shewed me the use of grafting my private consequence
on the importance of a great professional body; the benefits of those
firm connections which are cemented by hope and interest, by grati∣tude
<PB N="132" REF="157"/>
and emulation, by the mutual exchange of services and favours.
From the emoluments of a profession I might have derived an ample
fortune, or a competent income, instead of being stinted to the same
narrow allowance, to be increased only by an event which I sincerely
deprecated. The progress and the knowledge of our domestic dis∣orders
aggravated my anxiety, and I began to apprehend that I
might be left in my old age without the fruits either of industry or
inheritance.</P>
<P>In the first summer after my return, whilst I enjoyed at Beriton
the society of my friend Deyverdun, our daily conversations expa∣tiated
over the field of antient and modern literature; and we freely
discussed my studies, my first Essay, and my future projects. The
Decline and Fall of Rome I still contemplated at an awful distance:
but the two historical designs which had balanced my choice were
submitted to his taste; and in the parallel between the Revolutions
of Florence and Switzerland, our common partiality for a country
which was <HI>his</HI> by birth, and <HI>mine</HI> by adoption, inclined the scale in
favour of the latter. According to the plan, which was soon con∣ceived
and digested, I embraced a period of two hundred years,
from the association of the three peasants of the Alps to the plenitude
and prosperity of the Helvetic body in the sixteenth century. I
should have described the deliverance and victory of the Swiss, who
have never shed the blood of their tyrants but in a field of battle;
the laws and manners of the confederate states; the splendid tro∣phies
of the Austrian, Burgundian, and Italian wars; and the wis∣dom
of a nation, who, after some sallies of martial adventure, has
been content to guard the blessings of peace with the sword of
freedom.</P>
<Q><L>—Manus haec inimica tyrannis</L>
<L>Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem.</L></Q>
<P>My judgment, as well as my enthusiasm, was satisfied with the
glorious theme; and the assistance of Deyverdun seemed to remove
<PB N="133" REF="158"/>
an insuperable obstacle. The French or Latin memorials, of which
I was not ignorant, are inconsiderable in number and weight; but
in the perfect acquaintance of my friend with the German language,
I found the key of a more valuable collection. The most necessary
books were procured; he translated, for my use, the folio volume of
Schilling, a copious and contemporary relation of the war of Bur∣gundy;
we read and marked the most interesting parts of the great
chronicle of Tschudi; and by his labour, or that of an inferior as∣sistant,
large extracts were made from the History of Lauffer and
the Dictionary of Lew: yet such was the distance and delay, that
two years elapsed in these preparatory steps; and it was late in the
third summer (1767) before I entered, with these slender materials,
on the more agreeable task of composition. A specimen of my
History, the first book, was read the following winter in a literary
society of foreigners in London; and as the author was unknown,
I listened, without observation, to the free strictures, and unfavour∣able
sentence, of my judges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hume seems to have had a different opinion of this work.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is but a few days ago since M. Deyverdun put your manuscript into my hands, and I have perused it with great pleasure and satisfaction. I have only one objec∣tion, derived from the language in which it is written. Why do you compose in French, and carry faggots into the wood, as Horace says with regard to Romans who wrote in Greek? I grant that you have a like motive to those Romans, and adopt a language much more generally diffused than your native tongue: but have you not remarked the fate of those two ancient languages in following ages? The Latin, though then less celebrated, and consined to more narrow limits, has in some measure outlived the Greek, and is now more generally understood by men of letters. Let the French, therefore, triumph in the present dissusion of their tongue. Our solid and increasing establishments in America, where we need less dread the inun∣dation of Barbarians, promise a superior stability and duration to the English lan∣guage.</P>
<P>Your use of the French tongue has also led you into a style more poetical and figurative, and more highly coloured, than our language seems to admit of in histo∣rical productions: for such is the practice of French writers, particularly the more recent ones, who illuminate their pictures more than custom will permit us. On the whole, your History, in my opinion, is written with spirit and judgment; and I ex∣hort you very earnestly to continue it. The objections that occurred to me on reading it, were so frivolous, that I shall not trouble you with them, and should, I believe, have a difficulty to recollect them. I am, with great esteem,</P>

I delivered my imperfect sheets to the flames<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He neglected to burn them. He left at Sheffield-Place the introduction, or first book, in forty-three pages folio, written in a very small hand, besides a considerable number of notes.

a design in which some expence, much labour, and more
time, had been so vainly consumed. I cannot regret the loss of a
slight and superficial essay; for such the work must have been in
the hands of a stranger, uninformed by the scholars and statesmen,
and remote from the libraries and archives of the Swiss republics.
My antient habits, and the presence of Deyverdun, encouraged me to
write in French for the continent of Europe; but I was conscious
myself that my style, above prose and below poetry, degenerated
into a verbose and turgid declamation. Perhaps I may impute the
failure to the injudicious choice of a foreign language. Perhaps I
may suspect that the language itself is ill adapted to sustain the
vigour and dignity of an important narrative. But if France, so
rich in literary merit, had produced a great original historian, his
genius would have formed and fixed the idiom to the proper tone,
the peculiar mode of historical eloquence.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="160"/>
It was in search of some liberal and lucrative employment that my
friend Deyverdun had visited England. His remittances from home
were scanty and precarious. My purse was always open, but it was
often empty; and I bitterly felt the want of riches and power,
which might have enabled me to correct the errors of his fortune.
His wishes and qualifications solicited the station of the travelling
governor of some wealthy pupil; but every vacancy provoked so
many eager candidates, that for a long time I struggled without
success; nor was it till after much application that I could even
place him as a clerk in the office of the secretary of state. In a
residence of several years he never acquired the just pronunciation
and familiar use of the English tongue, but he read our most dif∣ficult
authors with ease and taste: his critical knowledge of our
language and poetry was such as few foreigners have possessed; and
few of our countrymen could enjoy the theatre of Shakespeare and
Garrick with more exquisite feeling and discernment. The consci∣ousness
of his own strength, and the assurance of my aid, embold∣ened
him to imitate the example of Dr. Maty, whose <HI>Journal Bri∣tannique</HI>
was esteemed and regretted; and to improve his model, by
uniting with the transactions of literature a philosophic view of the
arts and manners of the British nation. Our Journal for the year
1767, under the title of <HI>Memoires Literaires de la Grand Bretagne,</HI>
was soon finished and sent to the press. For the first article, Lord
Lyttelton's History of Henry II. I must own myself responsible;
but the public has ratified my judgment of that voluminous work,
in which sense and learning are not illuminated by a ray of genius.
The next specimen was the choice of my friend, <HI>the Bath Guide,</HI>
a light and whimsical performance, of local, and even verbal, plea∣santry.
I started at the attempt: he smiled at my fears: his courage
was justified by success; and a master of both languages will ap∣plaud
the curious felicity with which he has transfused into French
<PB N="136" REF="161"/>
prose the spirit, and even the humour, of the English verse. It is
not my wish to deny how deeply I was interested in these Memoirs,
of which I need not surely be ashamed; but at the distance of more
than twenty years, it would be impossible for me to ascertain the
respective shares of the two associates. A long and intimate com∣munication
of ideas had cast our sentiments and style in the same
mould. In our social labours we composed and corrected by turns;
and the praise which I might honestly bestow, would fall perhaps on
some article or passage most properly my own. A second volume
(for the year 1768) was published of these Memoirs. I will pre∣sume
to say, that their merit was superior to their reputation; but it
is not less true, that they were productive of more reputation than
emolument. They introduced my friend to the protection, and
myself to the acquaintance, of the Earl of Chesterfield, whose age
and infirmities secluded him from the world; and of Mr. David
Hume, who was under-secretary to the office in which Deyverdun
was more humbly employed. The former accepted a dedication,
(April 12th, 1769,) and reserved the author for the future educa∣cation
of his successor: the latter enriched the Journal with a reply
to Mr. Walpole's Historical Doubts, which he afterwards shaped
into the form of a note. The materials of the third volume were
almost completed, when I recommended Deyverdun as governor to
Sir Richard Worsley, a youth, the son of my old Lieutenant-co∣lonel,
who was lately deceased. They set forwards on their travels;
nor did they return to England till some time after my father's
death.</P>
<P>My next publication was an accidental sally of love and resent∣ment;
of my reverence for modest genius, and my aversion for in∣solent
pedantry. The sixth book of the Aeneid is the most pleasing
and perfect composition of Latin poetry. The descent of Aeneas
and the Sybil to the infernal regions, to the world of spirits, expands
<PB N="137" REF="162"/>
an awful and boundless prospect, from the nocturnal gloom of the
Cumaean grot,
<Q>Ibant obscuri-solâ sub nocte per umbram,</Q>
to the meridian brightness of the Elysian fields;
<Q><L>Largior hic campos aether et lumine vestit</L>
<L>Purpureo—</L></Q>
from the dreams of simple Nature, to the dreams, alas! of Egyptian
theology, and the philosophy of the Greeks. But the final dis∣mission
of the hero through the ivory gate, whence
<Q>Falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes,</Q>
seems to dissolve the whole enchantment, and leaves the reader in a
state of cold and anxious scepticism. This most lame and impotent
conclusion has been variously imputed to the taste or irreligion of
Virgil; but, according to the more elaborate interpretation of Bishop
Warburton, the descent to hell is not a false, but a mimic scene;
which represents the initiation of Aeneas, in the character of a law-giver,
to the Eleusinian mysteries. This hypothesis, a singular
chapter in the Divine Legation of Moses, had been admitted by
many as true; it was praised by all as ingenious; nor had it
been exposed, in a space of thirty years, to a fair and critical dis∣cussion.
The learning and the abilities of the author had raised
him to a just eminence; but he reigned the dictator and tyrant of
the world of literature. The real merit of Warburton was degraded
by the pride and presumption with which he pronounced his infal∣lible
decrees; in his polemic writings he lashed his antagonists with∣out
mercy or moderation; and his servile flatterers, (see the base and
malignant Essay on the <HI>Delicacy of Friendship,</HI>) exalting the master
critic far above Aristotle and Longinus, assaulted every modest dis∣senter
who refused to consult the oracle, and to adore the idol. In
a land of liberty, such despotism must provoke a general opposition,
<PB N="138" REF="163"/>
and the zeal of opposition is seldom candid or impartial. A late
professor of Oxford, (Dr. Lowth,) in a pointed and polished epistle,
(August 31st, 1765,) defended himself, and attacked the Bishop;
and, whatsoever might be the merits of an insignificant controversy,
his victory was clearly established by the silent confusion of War∣burton
and his slaves. <HI>I</HI> too, without any private offence, was am∣bitious
of breaking a lance against the giant's shield; and in the be∣ginning
of the year 1770, my Critical Observations on the Sixth
Book of the Aeneid were sent, without my name, to the press. In
this short Essay, my first English publication, I aimed my strokes
against the person and the hypothesis of Bishop Warburton. I
proved, at least to my own satisfaction, <HI>that</HI> the antient lawgivers
did not invent the mysteries, and <HI>that</HI> Aeneas was never invested
with the office of lawgiver: <HI>that</HI> there is not any argument, any
circumstance, which can melt a fable into allegory, or remove the
seene from the Lake Avernus to the Temple of Ceres: <HI>that</HI> such a
wild supposition is equally injurious to the poet and the man: <HI>that</HI>
if Virgil was not initiated he could not, if he were he would not,
reveal the secrets of the initiation: <HI>that</HI> the anathema of Horace
(<HI>vetabo qui Cereris sacrum vulgarit, &amp;c.</HI>) at once attests his own
ignorance and the innocence of his friend. As the Bishop of
Gloucester and his party maintained a discreet silence, my critical
disquisition was soon lost among the pamphlets of the day; but the
public coldness was overbalanced to my feelings by the weighty ap∣probation
of the last and best editor of Virgil, Professor Heyne of
Gottingen, who acquiesces in my confutation, and stiles the un∣known
author, <HI>doctus—et elegantissimus Britannus.</HI> But I cannot
resist the temptation of transcribing the favourable judgment of Mr.
Hayley, himself a poet and a scholar: <Q>An intricate hypothesis,
twisted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argu∣ment,
the Dissertation on the Sixth Book of Virgil, remained
some time unrefuted.—At length, a superior, but anony∣mous,
<PB N="139" REF="164"/>
critic arose, who, in one of the most judicious and spirited
essays that our nation has produced, on a point of classical litera∣ture,
completely overturned this ill-founded edifice, and exposed
the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect.</Q> He even
condescends to justify an acrimony of style, which had been gently
blamed by the more unbiassed German; <Q><HI>Paullo acrius quam velis
—perstrinxit</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> The editor of the Warburtonian tracts, Dr. Parr, (p. 192.) considers the allego∣rical interpretation <Q>as completely refuted in a most clear, elegant, and decisive work of criticism; which could not, indeed, derive authority from the greatest name; but to which the greatest name might with propriety have been affixed.</Q></NOTE>. But I cannot forgive myself the contemptuous
treatment of a man who, with all his faults, was entitled to my
esteem<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Divine Legation of Moses is a monument, already crumbling in the dust, of the vigour and weakness of the human mind. If Warburton's new argument proved any thing, it would be a demonstration against the legislator, who left his people without the knowledge of a future state. But some episodes of the work, on the Greek philosophy, the hieroglyphics of Egypt, &amp;c. are entitled to the praise of learning, imagination, and discernment.</NOTE>; and I can less forgive, in a personal attack, the cowardly
concealment of my name and character.</P>
<P>In the fifteen years between my Essay on the Study of Literature
and the first volume of the Decline and Fall, (1761—1776,) this
criticism on Warburton, and some articles in the Journal, were my
sole publications. It is more especially incumbent on me to mark
the employment, or to confess the waste of time, from my travels
to my father's death, an interval in which I was not diverted by
any professional duties from the labours and pleasures of a studious
life. 1. As soon as I was released from the fruitless task of the
Swiss revolutions, (1768,) I began gradually to advance from the
wish to the hope, from the hope to the design, from the design to
the execution, of my historical work, of whose limits and extent I
had yet a very inadequate notion. The Classics, as low as Tacitus,
the younger Pliny, and Juvenal, were my old and familiar com∣panions.
<PB N="140" REF="165"/>
I insensibly plunged into the ocean of the Augustan his∣tory;
and in the descending series I investigated, with my pen
almost always in my hand, the original records, both Greek and
Latin, from Dion Cassius to Ammianus Marcellinus, from the reign
of Trajan to the last age of the Western Caesars. The subsidiary
rays of medals, and inscriptions of geography and chronology,
were thrown on their proper objects; and I applied the collections
of Tillemont, whose inimitable accuracy almost assumes the cha∣racter
of genius, to fix and arrange within my reach the loose and
scattered atoms of historical information. Through the darkness of
the middle ages I explored my way in the Annals and Antiquities of
Italy of the learned Muratori; and diligently compared them with
the parallel or transverse lines of Sigonius and Maffei, Baronius and
Pagi, till I almost grasped the ruins of Rome in the fourteenth cen∣tury,
without suspecting that this final chapter must be attained by
the labour of six quartos and twenty years. Among the books
which I purchased, the Theodocian Code, with the commentary of
James Godefroy, must be gratefully remembered. I used it (and much
I used it) as a work of history, rather than of jurisprudence: but
in every light it may be considered as a full and capacious repository
of the political state of the empire in the fourth and fifth centuries.
As I believed, and as I still believe, that the propagation of the
Gospel, and the triumph of the church, are inseparably connected
with the decline of the Roman monarchy, I weighed the causes
and effects of the revolution, and contrasted the narratives and apo∣logies
of the Christians themselves, with the glances of candour or
enmity which the Pagans have cast on the rising sects. The Jewish
and Heathen testimonies, as they are collected and illustrated by Dr.
Lardner, directed, without superseding, my search of the originals;
and in an ample dissertation on the miraculous darkness of the
passion, I privately withdrew my conclusions from the silence of an
unbelieving age. I have assembled the preparatory studies, directly
<PB N="141" REF="166"/>
or indirectly relative to my history; but, in strict equity, they must
be spread beyond this period of my life, over the two summers
(1771 and 1772) that elapsed between my father's death and my
settlement in London. 2. In a free conversation with books and
men, it would be endless to enumerate the names and characters of
all who are introduced to our acquaintance; but in this general ac∣quaintance
we may select the degrees of friendship and esteem, ac∣cording
to the wise maxim, <HI>Multum legere potius quam multa.</HI> I re∣viewed,
again and again, the immortal works of the French and
English, the Latin and Italian classics. My Greek studies (though
less assiduous than I designed) maintained and extended my know∣ledge
of that incomparable idiom. Homer and Xenophon were still
my favourite authors; and I had almost prepared for the press an
Essay on the Cyropoedia, which, in my own judgment, is not un∣happily
laboured. After a certain age, the new publications of merit
are the sole food of the many; and the most austere student will be
often tempted to break the line, for the sake of indulging his own
curiosity, and of providing the topics of fashionable currency. A more
respectable motive may be assigned for the third perusal of Blackstone's
Commentaries, and a copious and critical abstract of that English
work was my first serious production in my native language.
3. My literary leisure was much less complete and independent than
it might appear to the eye of a stranger. In the hurry of London I
was destitute of books; in the solitude of Hampshire I was not
master of my time. My quiet was gradually disturbed by our do∣mestic
anxiety, and I should be ashamed of my unfeeling philosophy,
had I found much time or taste for study in the last fatal summer
(1772) of my father's decay and dissolution.</P>
<P>The disembodying of the militia at the close of the war (1763)
had restored the Major (a new Cincinnatus) to a life of agriculture.
His labours were useful, his pleasures innocent, his wishes mode∣rate;
and my father <HI>seemed</HI> to enjoy the state of happiness which is
<PB N="142" REF="167"/>
celebrated by poets and philosophers, as the most agreeable to nature,
and the least accessible to fortune.</P>
<Q><L>Beatus ille, qui procul negotiis</L>
<L>(Ut prisca gens mortalium)</L>
<L>Paterna rura bubus exercet suis,</L>
<L>Solutus omni foenore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>Like the first mortals, blest is he,</L>
<L>From debts, and usury, and business free,</L>
<L>With his own team who ploughs the soil,</L>
<L>Which grateful once confess'd his father's toil.</L>
</LG></NOTE>.</L><BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL>
<BIBL>HOR. <HI>Epod.</HI> ii.</BIBL></Q>
<P>But the last indispensable condition, the freedom from debt, was
wanting to my father's felicity; and the vanities of his youth were
severely punished by the solicitude and sorrow of his declining age.
The first mortgage, on my return from Lausanne, (1758,) had af∣forded
him a partial and transient relief. The annual demand of
interest and allowance was a heavy deduction from his income; the
militia was a source of expence, the farm in his hands was not a
profitable adventure, he was loaded with the costs and damages of
an obsolete law-suit; and each year multiplied the number, and ex∣hausted
the patience, of his creditors. Under these painful circum∣stances,
I consented to an additional mortgage, to the sale of Putney,
and to every sacrifice that could alleviate his distress. But he was
no longer capable of a rational effort, and his reluctant delays post∣poned
not the evils themselves, but the remedies of those evils (<HI>re∣media
malorum potius quam mala differebat</HI>). The pangs of shame,
tenderness, and self-reproach, incessantly preyed on his vitals; his
constitution was broken; he lost his strength and his sight; the ra∣pid
progress of a dropsy admonished him of his end, and he sunk
into the grave on the 10th of November 1770, in the sixty-fourth
year of his age. A family-tradition insinuates that Mr. William
Law had drawn his pupil in the light and inconstant character of
<PB N="143" REF="168"/>
<HI>Flatus,</HI> who is ever confident, and ever disappointed in the chace of
happiness. But these constitutional failings were happily compen∣sated
by the virtues of the head and heart, by the warmest senti∣ments
of honour and humanity. His graceful person, polite ad∣dress,
gentle manners, and unaffected cheerfulness, recommended
him to the favour of every company; and in the change of
times and opinions, his liberal spirit had long since delivered him
from the zeal and prejudice of a Tory education. I submitted to
the order of Nature; and my grief was soothed by the conscious
satisfaction that I had discharged all the duties of filial piety.</P>
<P>As soon as I had paid the last solemn duties to my father, and
obtained, from time and reason, a tolerable composure of mind, I
began to form the plan of an independent life, most adapted to my
circumstances and inclination. Yet so intricate was the net, my ef∣forts
were so awkward and feeble, that nearly two years (November
1770—October 1772) were suffered to elapse before I could disen∣tangle
myself from the management of the farm, and transfer my
residence from Beriton to a house in London. During this interval
I continued to divide my year between town and the country; but
my new situation was brightened by hope; my stay in London was
prolonged into the summer; and the uniformity of the summer was
occasionally broken by visits and excursions at a distance from home.
The gratification of my desires (they were not immoderate) has been
seldom disappointed by the want of money or credit; my pride
was never insulted by the visit of an importunate tradesman; and
my transient anxiety for the past or future has been dispelled by the
studious or social occupation of the present hour. My conscience
does not accuse me of any act of extravagance or injustice, and the
remnant of my estate affords an ample and honourable provision for
my declining age. I shall not expatiate on my oeconomical affairs,
which cannot be instructive or amusing to the reader. It is a rule
of prudence, as well as of politeness, to reserve such confidence for
<PB N="144" REF="169"/>
the ear of a private friend, without exposing our situation to the
envy or pity of strangers; for envy is productive of hatred, and
pity borders too nearly on contempt. Yet I may believe, and even
assert, that in circumstances more indigent or more wealthy, I should
never have accomplished the task, or acquired the fame, of an his∣torian;
that my spirit would have been broken by poverty and con∣tempt,
and that my industry might have been relaxed in the labour
and luxury of a superfluous fortune.</P>
<P>I had now attained the first of earthly blessings, independence: I
was the absolute master of my hours and actions: nor was I deceived
in the hope that the establishment of my library in town would allow
me to divide the day between study and society. Each year the circle
of my acquaintance, the number of my dead and living companions,
was enlarged. To a lover of books, the shops and sales of London
present irresistible temptations; and the manufacture of my history
required a various and growing stock of materials. The militia, my
travels, the House of Commons, the fame of an author, contributed
to multiply my connections: I was chosen a member of the fashion∣able
clubs; and, before I left England in 1783, there were few per∣sons
of any eminence in the literary or political world to whom I
was a stranger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the mixed, though polite, company of Boodle's, White's, and Brooks's, I must honourably distinguish a weekly society, which was instituted in the year 1764, and which still continues to flourish, under the title of the Literary Club. (Hawkins's Life of Johnson, p. 415. Boswell's Tour to the Hebrides, p. 97.) The names of Dr. Johnson, Mr. Burke, Mr. Topham Beauclerc, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldsmith, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Colman, Sir William Jones, Dr. Percy, Mr. Fox, Mr. She∣ridan, Mr. Adam Smith, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Dunning, Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Warton, and his brother Mr. Thomas Warton, Dr. Burney, &amp;c. form a large and luminous constellation of British stars.</NOTE>. It would most assuredly be in my power to amuse
the reader with a gallery of portraits and a collection of anecdotes.
But I have always condemned the practice of transforming a private
memorial into a vehicle of satire or praise. By my own choice I
passed in town the greatest part of the year; but whenever I was
<PB N="145" REF="170"/>
desirous of breathing the air of the country, I possessed an hospitable
retreat at Sheffield-place in Sussex, in the family of my valuable
friend Mr. Holroyd, whose character, under the name of Lord
Sheffield, has since been more conspicuous to the public.</P>
<P>No sooner was I settled in my house and library, than I under∣took
the composition of the first volume of my History. At the
outset all was dark and doubtful; even the title of the work, the
true aera of the Decline and Fall of the Empire, the limits of the
introduction, the division of the chapters, and the order of the nar∣rative;
and I was often tempted to cast away the labour of seven
years. The style of an author should be the image of his mind, but
the choice and command of language is the fruit of exercise. Many
experiments were made before I could hit the middle tone between
a dull chronicle and a rhetorical declamation: three times did I com∣pose
the first chapter, and twice the second and third, before I was
tolerably satisfied with their effect. In the remainder of the way I
advanced with a more equal and easy pace; but the fifteenth and
sixteenth chapters have been reduced by three successive revisals, from
a large volume to their present size; and they might still be com∣pressed,
without any loss of facts or sentiments. An opposite fault
may be imputed to the concise and superficial narrative of the first
reigns from Commodus to Alexander; a fault of which I have never
heard, except from Mr. Hume in his last journey to London. Such
an oracle might have been consulted and obeyed with rational de∣votion;
but I was soon disgusted with the modest practice of read∣ing
the manuscript to my friends. Of such friends some will
praise from politeness, and some will criticise from vanity. The
author himself is the best judge of his own performance; no one has
so deeply meditated on the subject; no one is so sincerely interested
in the event.</P>
<P>By the friendship of Mr. (now Lord) Eliot, who had married my
first cousin, I was returned at the general election. for the borough
<PB N="146" REF="171"/>
of Leskeard. I took my seat at the beginning of the memorable
contest between Great Britain and America, and supported, with
many a sincere and silent vote, the rights, though not, perhaps, the
interest, of the mother country. After a fleeting illusive hope, pru∣dence
condemned me to acquiesce in the humble station of a mute.
I was not armed by Nature and education with the intrepid energy
of mind and voice.</P>
<Q>Vincentem strepitus, et natum rebus agendis.</Q>
<P>Timidity was fortified by pride, and even the success of my pen dis∣couraged
the trial of my voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French sketch of Mr. Gibbon's Life, written by himself, probably for the use of some foreign journalist or translator, contains no fact not mentioned in his English Life. He there describes himself with his usual candour. Depuis huit ans il a assisté aux deliberations les plus importantes, mais il ne s'est jamais trouvé <HI>le courage,</HI> ni <HI>le talent,</HI> de parler dans une assemblée publique. This sketch was written before the publication of his three last volumes, as in closing it he says of his History: Cette entreprise lui de∣mande encore plusieurs années d'une application soutenue; mais quelqu'en soit le succès, il trouve dans cette application même un plaisir toujours varié et toujours renaissant.</NOTE>. But I assisted at the debates of a
free assembly; I listened to the attack and defence of eloquence and
reason; I had a near prospect of the characters, views, and passions
of the first men of the age. The cause of government was ably
vindicated by <HI>Lord North,</HI> a statesman of spotless integrity, a con∣summate
master of debate, who could wield, with equal dexterity,
the arms of reason and of ridicule. He was seated on the Treasury-bench
between his Attorney and Solicitor General, the two pillars
of the law and state, <HI>magis pares quam similes;</HI> and the minister might
indulge in a short slumber, whilst he was upholden on either hand
by the majestic sense of <HI>Thurlow,</HI> and the skilful eloquence of <HI>Wedder∣burne.</HI>
From the adverse side of the house an ardent and powerful
opposition was supported, by the lively declamation of <HI>Barré,</HI> the
legal acuteness of <HI>Dunning,</HI> the profuse and philosophic fancy of
<HI>Burke,</HI> and the argumentative vehemence of <HI>Fox,</HI> who in the con∣duct
of a party approved himself equal to the conduct of an empire.
<PB N="147" REF="172"/>
By such men every operation of peace and war, every principle
of justice or policy, every question of authority and freedom, was
attacked and defended; and the subject of the momentous contest
was the union or separation of Great Britain and America. The
eight sessions that I sat in parliament were a school of civil pru∣dence,
the first and most essential virtue of an historian.</P>
<P>The volume of my History, which had been somewhat delayed
by the novelty and tumult of a first session, was now ready for
the press. After the perilous adventure had been declined by my
friend Mr. Elmsly, I agreed, upon easy terms, with Mr. Thomas
Cadell, a respectable bookseller, and Mr. William Strahan, an emi∣nent
printer; and they undertook the care and risk of the publica∣tion,
which derived more credit from the name of the shop than
from that of the author. The last revisal of the proofs was sub∣mitted
to my vigilance; and many blemishes of style, which had
been invisible in the manuscript, were discovered and corrected in
the printed sheet. So moderate were our hopes, that the original
impression had been stinted to five hundred, till the number was
doubled by the prophetic taste of Mr. Strahan. During this awful
interval I was neither elated by the ambition of fame, nor depressed
by the apprehension of contempt. My diligence and accuracy were
attested by my own conscience. History is the most popular species
of writing, since it can adapt itself to the highest or the lowest ca∣pacity.
I had chosen an illustrious subject. Rome is familiar to
the school-boy and the statesman; and my narrative was deduced
from the last period of classical reading. I had likewise flattered
myself, that an age of light and liberty would receive, without scan∣dal,
an inquiry into the human <HI>causes</HI> of the progress and establish∣ment
of Christianity.</P>
<P>I am at a loss how to describe the success of the work, without
betraying the vanity of the writer. The first impression was ex∣bausted
in a few days; a second and third edition were scarcely
<PB N="148" REF="173"/>
adequate to the demand; and the bookseller's property was twice
invaded by the pirates of Dublin. My book was on every table,
and almost on every toilette; the historian was crowned by the taste
or fashion of the day; nor was the general voice disturbed by the
barking of any <HI>profane</HI> critic. The favour of mankind is most freely
bestowed on a new acquaintance of any original merit; and the
mutual surprize of the public and their favourite is productive of
those warm sensibilities, which at a second meeting can no longer be
rekindled. If I listened to the music of praise, I was more seriously
satisfied with the approbation of my judges. The candour of Dr.
Robertson embraced his disciple. A letter from Mr. Hume overpaid
the labour of ten years; but I have never presumed to accept a
place in the triumvirate of British historians.</P>
<P>That curious and original letter will amuse the reader, and his
gratitude should shield my free communication from the reproach of
vanity.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>EDINBURGH, <DATE>18th March 1776.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As I ran through your volume of history with great avidity and
impatience, I cannot forbear discovering somewhat of the same impa∣tience
in returning you thanks for your agreeable present, and express∣ing
the satisfaction which the performance has given me. Whether
I consider the dignity of your style, the depth of your matter, or the
extensiveness of your learning, I must regard the work as equally
the object of esteem; and I own that if I had not previously had
the happiness of your personal acquaintance, such a performance
from an Englishman in our age would have given me some surprize.
You may smile at this sentiment; but as it seems to me that your
countrymen, for almost a whole generation, have given themselves
up to barbarous and absurd faction, and have totally neglected all
polite letters, I no longer expected any valuable production ever to
come from them. I know it will give you pleasure (as it did me)
<PB N="149" REF="174"/>
to find that all the men of letters in this place concur in their ad∣miration
of your work, and in their anxious desire of your con∣tinuing
it.</P>
<P>When I heard of your undertaking, (which was some time ago,)
I own I was a little curious to see how you would extricate yourself
from the subject of your two last chapters. I think you have ob∣served
a very prudent temperament; but it was impossible to treat
the subject so as not to give grounds of suspicion against you, and
you may expect that a clamour will arise. This, if any thing, will
retard your success with the public; for in every other respect your
work is calculated to be popular. But among many other marks of
decline, the prevalence of superstition in England prognosticates the
fall of philosophy and decay of taste; and though nobody be more
capable than you to revive them, you will probably find a struggle
in your first advances.</P>
<P>I see you entertain a great doubt with regard to the authenticity
of the poems of Ossian. You are certainly right in so doing. It is
indeed strange that any men of sense could have imagined it possible,
that above twenty thousand verses, along with numberless historical
facts, could have been preserved by oral tradition during fifty gene∣rations,
by the rudest, perhaps, of all the European nations, the
most necessitous, the most turbulent, and the most unsettled. Where
a supposition is so contrary to common sense, any positive evidence
of it ought never to be regarded: Men run with great avidity to
give their evidence in favour of what flatters their passions and their
national prejudices. You are therefore over and above indulgent to
us in speaking of the matter with hesitation.</P>
<P>I must inform you that we are all very anxious to hear that you
have fully collected the materials for your second volume, and that
you are even considerably advanced in the composition of it. I speak
this more in the name of my friends than in my own; as I cannot
<PB N="150" REF="175"/>
expect to live so long as to see the publication of it. Your ensuing
volume will be more delicate than the preceding, but I trust in your
prudence for extricating you from the difficulties; and, in all
events, you have courage to despise the clamour of bigots.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, with great regard,
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient, and most humble Servant,
DAVID HUME.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Some weeks afterwards I had the melancholy pleasure of seeing
Mr. Hume in his passage through London; his body feeble, his
mind firm. On the 25th of August of the same year (1776) he
died, at Edinburgh, the death of a philosopher.</P>
<P>My second excursion to Paris was determined by the pressing in∣vitation
of M. and Madame Necker, who had visited England in
the preceding summer. On my arrival I found M. Necker Director-general
of the finances, in the first bloom of power and popularity.
His private fortune enabled him to support a liberal establishment;
and his wife, whose talents and virtues I had long admired, was ad∣mirably
qualified to preside in the conversation of her table and
drawing-room. As their friend, I was introduced to the best com∣pany
of both sexes; to the foreign ministers of all nations, and to
the first names and characters of France; who distinguished me by
such marks of civility and kindness, as gratitude will not suffer me
to forget, and modesty will not allow me to enumerate. The
fashionable suppers often broke into the morning hours; yet I occa∣sionally
consulted the Royal Library, and that of the Abbey of
St. Germain, and in the free use of their books at home, I had
always reason to praise the liberality of those institutions. The so∣ciety
of men of letters I neither courted nor declined; but I was
<PB N="151" REF="176"/>
happy in the acquaintance of M. de Buffon, who united with a su∣blime
genius the most amiable simplicity of mind and manners.
At the table of my old friend, M. de Foncemagne, I was involved
in a dispute with the Abbé de Mably; and his jealous irascible spirit
revenged itself on a work which he was incapable of reading in the
original.</P>
<P>As I might be partial in my own cause, I shall transcribe the words
of an unknown critic, observing only, that this dispute had been
preceded by another on the English constitution, at the house of the
Countess de Froulay, an old Jansenist lady.</P>
<P><Q>Vous étiez chez M. de Foncemagne, mon cher Theodon, le jour
que M. l'Abbé de Mably et M. Gibbon y dinerent en grande com∣pagnie.
La conversation roula presque entièrement sur l'histoire.
L'Abbé etant un profond politique, la tourna sur l'administration,
quand on fut au desert: et comme par caractère, par humeur,
par l'habitude d'admirer Tite Live, il ne prise que le systême re∣publicain,
il se mit à vanter l'excellence des republiques; bien
persuadé que le savant Anglois l'approuveroit en tout, et admireroit
la profondeur de génie qui avoit fait deviner tous ces avantages à
un François. Mais M. Gibbon, instruit par l'experience des in∣conveniens
d'un gouvernement populaire, ne fut point du tout de
son avis, et il prit généreusement la défense du gouvernement mo∣narchique.
L'Abbé voulut le convaincre par Tite Live, et par
quelques argumens tirés de Plutarque en faveur des Spartiates.
M. Gibbon, doué de la memoire la plus heureuse, et ayant tous lès
faits presens à la pensée, domina bien-tot la conversation; l'Abbé se
facha, il s'emporta, il dit des choses dures; l'Anglois, conservant le
phlegme de son pays, prenoit ses avantages, et pressoit l'Abbé avee
d'autant plus de succès que la colere le troubloit de plus en plus.
La conversation s'echauffoit, et M. de Foncemagne la rompit en se
levant de table, et en passant dans le salon, où personne ne fut tenté
<PB N="152" REF="177"/>
de la renouer.</Q> <HI>Supplément de la Manière d' ecrire l' Histoire,</HI>

Mably was a lover of virtue and freedom; but his virtue was austere, and his freedom was impatient of an equal. Kings, magistrates, nobles, and successful writers, were the objects of his contempt, or hatred, or envy; but his illiberal abuse of Voltaire, Hume, Buffon, the Abbé Reynal, Dr. Robertson, and <HI>tutti quanti,</HI> can be injurious only to himself.</P>

Vol. ii. p. 261-263.)</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Nearly two years had elapsed between the publication of my first
and the commencément of my second volume; and the causes must
be assigned of this long delay. 1. After a short holiday, I indulged
my curiosity in some studies of a very different nature, a course of
anatomy, which was demonstrated by Doctor Hunter; and some
lessons of chymistry, which were delivered by Mr. Higgins. The
principles of these sciences, and taste for books of natural history,
contributed to multiply my ideas and images; and the anatomist and
chymist may sometimes track me in their own snow. 2. I dived,
perhaps too deeply, into the mud of the Arian controversy; and
many days of reading, thinking, and writing were consumed in the
pursuit of a phantom. 3. It is difficult to arrange, with order and
perspicuity, the various transactions of the age of Constantine; and
so much was I displeased with the first essay, that I committed to the
flames above fifty sheets. 4. The six months of Paris and pleasure
must be deducted from the account. But when I resumed my task
I felt my improvement; I was now master of my style and subject,
and while the measure of my daily performance was enlarged, I dis∣covered
<PB N="153" REF="178"/>
less reason to cancel or correct. It has always been my
practice to cast a long paragraph in a single mould, to try it by my
ear, to deposit it in my memory, but to suspend the action of the
pen till I had given the last polish to my work. Shall I add, that I
never found my mind more vigorous, nor my composition more
happy, than in the winter hurry of society and parliament?</P>
<P>Had I believed that the majority of English readers were so fondly
attached even to the name and shadow of Christianity; had I forescen
that the pious, the timid, and the prudent, would feel, or affect to
feel, with such exquisite sensibility; I might, perhaps, have sostened
the two invidious chapters, which would create many enemies, and
conciliate few friends. But the shaft was shot, the alarm was sounded,
and I could only rejoice, that if the voice of our priests was clamo∣rous
and bitter, their hands were disarmed from the powers of per∣secution.
I adhered to the wise resolution of trusting myself and
my writings to the candour of the public, till Mr. Davies of Oxford
presumed to attack, not the faith, but the fidelity, of the historian.
<HI>My Vindication,</HI> expressive of less anger than contempt, amused for
a moment the busy and idle metropolis; and the most rational part
of the laity, and even of the clergy, appear to have been satisfied
of my innocence and accuracy. I would not print this Vindication in
quarto, lest it should be bound and preserved with the history itself. At
the distance of twelve years, I calmly affirm my judgment of Davies,
Chelsum, &amp;c. A victory over such antagonists was a sufficient hu∣miliation.
They, however, were rewarded in this world. Poor
Chelsum was indeed neglected; and I dare not boast the making
Dr. Watson a bishop; he is a prelate of a large mind and liberal
spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, N<SUP>o</SUP> LXVIII. LXIX. and C.</NOTE>: but I enjoyed the pleasure of giving a Royal pension to
Mr. Davies, and of collating Dr. Apthorpe to an archiepiscopal living.
<PB N="154" REF="179"/>
Their success encouraged the zeal of Taylor the Arian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The stupendous title, <HI>Thoughts on the Causes of the grand Apostacy,</HI> at first agitated my nerves, till I discovered that it was the apostacy of the whole church, since the Council of Nice, from Mr. Taylor's private religion.

remember, and tedious to rehearse. The list of my adversaries, how∣ever,
was graced with the more respectable names of Dr. Priestley,
Sir David Dalrymple, and Dr. White; and every polemic, of either
university, discharged his sermon or pamphlet against the impe∣netrable
silence of the Roman historian. In his History of the
Corruptions of Christianity, Dr. Priestley threw down his two gaunt∣lets
to Bishop Hurd and Mr. Gibbon. I declined the challenge in a
letter, exhorting my opponent to enlighten the world by his philo∣sophical
discoveries, and to remember that the merit of his prede∣cessor
Servetus is now reduced to a single passage, which indicates the
smaller circulation of the blood through the lungs, from and to the
heart<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Astruc de la Structure du Coeur, tom. i. 77. 79. Appendix, Letters CXIX-CXXIV.</NOTE> Instead of listening to this friendly advice, the dauntless
philosopher of Birmingham continued to sire away his double bat∣tery
against those who believed too little, and those who believed too
much. <HI>From my</HI> replies he has nothing to hope or fear: but his
Socinian shield has repeatedly been pierced by the spear of Horsley,
and his trumpet of sedition may at length awaken the magistrates of
a free country.</P>
<P>The profession and rank of Sir David Dalrymple (now a Lord of
Session) has given a more decent colour to his style. But he scru∣tinized
<PB N="155" REF="180"/>
each separate passage of the two chapters with the dry mi∣nuteness
of a special pleader; and as he was always solicitous to
make, he may have succeeded sometimes in finding, a flaw. In his
Annals of Scotland, he has shewn himself a diligent collector and an
accurate critic.</P>
<P>I have praised, and I still praise, the eloquent sermons which were
preached in St. Mary's pulpit at Oxford by Dr. White. If he as∣saulted
me with some degree of illiberal acrimony, in such a place,
and before such an audience, he was obliged to speak the language
of the country. I smiled at a passage in one of his private letters to
Mr. Badcock; <Q>The part where we encounter Gibbon must be
brilliant and striking.</Q></P>
<P>In a sermon preached before the university of Cambridge, Dr. Ed∣wards
complimented a work, <Q>which can only perish with the
language itself;</Q> and esteems the author a formidable enemy. He
is, indeed, astonished that more learning and ingenuity has not been
shewn in the defence of Israel; that the prelates and dignitaries of
the church (alas, good man!) did not vie with each other, whose
stone should sink the deepest in the forehead of this Goliah.</P>
<P><Q>But the force of truth will oblige us to confess, that in the at∣tacks
which have been levelled against our sceptical historian, we
can discover but slender traces of profound and exquisite erudition,
of solid criticism and accurate investigation; but we are too fre∣quently
disgusted by vague and inconclusive reasoning; by unsea∣sonable
banter and senseless witticisms; by imbittered bigotry and
enthusiastic jargon; by futile cavils and illiberal invectives. Proud
and elated by the weakness of his antagonists, he condescends not
to handle the sword of controversy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monthly Review, Oct. 1790.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Let me frankly own that I was startled at the first discharge of
ecclesiastical ordnance; but as soon as I found that this empty noise
was mischievous only in the intention, my fear was converted into
<PB N="156" REF="181"/>
indignation; and every feeling of indignation or curiosity has long
since subsided in pure and placid indifference.</P>
<P>The prosecution of my history was soon afterwards checked by
another controversy of a very different kind. At the request of the
Lord Chancellor, and of Lord Weymouth, then Secretary of State,
I vindicated, against the French manifesto, the justice of the British
arms. The whole correspondence of Lord Stormont, our late am∣bassador
at Paris, was submitted to my inspection, and the <HI>Memoire
Justificatif,</HI> which I composed in French, was first approved by the
Cabinet Ministers, and then delivered as a state paper to the courts
of Europe. The style and manner are praised by Beaumarchais
himself, who, in his private quarrel, attempted a reply; but he
flatters me, by ascribing the memoir to Lord Stormont; and the
grossness of his invective betrays the loss of temper and of wit; he
acknowledged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Beaumarchais, tom. iii. p. 299. 355.</NOTE>, that <HI>le style ne seroit pas sans grace, ni la logique
sans justesse,</HI> &amp;c. if the facts were true which he undertakes to dis∣prove.
For these facts my credit is not pledged; I spoke as a
lawyer from my brief, but the veracity of Beaumarchais may be
estimated from the assertion that France, by the treaty of Paris
(1763), was limited to a certain number of ships of war. On the
application of the Duke of Choiseul, he was obliged to retract this
daring falsehood.</P>
<P>Among the honourable connections which I had formed, I may
justly be proud of the friendship of Mr. Wedderburne, at that time
Attorney General, who now illustrates the title of Lord Lough∣borough,
and the office of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. By
his strong recommendation, and the favourable disposition of Lord
North, I was appointed one of the Lords Commissioners of Trade
and Plantations; and my private income was enlarged by a clear
addition of between seven and eight hundred pounds a-year. The
fancy of an hostile orator may paint, in the strong colours of ridi∣cule,
<PB N="157" REF="182"/>
<Q>the perpetual virtual adjournment, and the unbroken sitting
vacation of the Board of Trade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> I can never forget the delight with which that diffusive and ingenious orator, Mr. Burke, was heard by all sides of the house, and even by those whose existence he proscribed. (See Mr. Burke's speech on the Bill of Reform, p. 72-80.) The Lords of Trade blushed at their insignificancy, and Mr. Eden's appeal to the two thousand five hundred volumes of our Reports, served only to excite a general laugh. I take this opportunity of certifying the correctness of Mr. Burke's printed speeches, which I have heard and read.</NOTE>.</Q> But it must be allowed that
our duty was not intolerably severe, and that I enjoyed many days
and weeks of repose, without being called away from my library to

was most unjustly accused of deserting a party, in which I had

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>2d July 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Yesterday I received a very interesting communication from my friend, whose kind and honourable behaviour towards me I must always remember with the highest gratitude. He informed me that, in consequence of an arrangement, a place at the Board of Trade was reserved for me, and that as soon as I signified my acceptance of it, he was satisfied no farther difficulties would arise. My answer to him was sincere and explicit. I told him that I was far from approving all the past measures of the ad∣ministration, even some of those in which I myself had silently concurred; that I saw, with the rest of the world, many capital defects in the characters of some of the pre∣sent ministers, and was sorry that in so alarming a situation of public affairs, the country had not the assistance of several able and honest men who are now in oppo∣sition. But that I had not formed with any of those persons in opposition any engage∣ments or connections which could in the least restrain or affect my parliamentary con∣duct; that I could not discover among them such superior advantages, either of mea∣sures or of abilities, as could make me consider it as a duty to attach myself to their cause; and that I clearly understood, from the public and private language of—, one of their leaders, that in the actual state of the country, he himself was seriously of opinion that opposition could not tend to any good purpose, and might be productive of much mischief; that, for those reasons, I saw no objections which could prevent me from accepting an office under the present government, and that I was ready to take a step which I found to be consistent both with my interest and my honour.</P>
<P>It must now be decided, whether I may continue to live in England, or whether I must soon withdraw myself into a kind of philosophical exile in Switzerland. My father left his affairs in a state of embarrassment, and even of distress. My attempts to dispose of a part of my landed property have hitherto been disappointed, and are not likely at present to be more successful: and my plan of expence, though moderate in itself, deserves the name of extravagance, since it exceeds my real income. The ad∣dition of the salary which is now offered will make my situation perfectly easy; but I hope you will do me the justice to believe that my mind could not be so, unless I were satisfied of the rectitude of my own conduct.</P>

<P><PB N="158" REF="183"/>
The aspect of the next session of parliament was stormy and pe∣rilous;
county meetings, petitions, and committees of correspond∣ence,
announced the public discontent; and instead of voting with
a triumphant majority, the friends of government were often ex∣posed
to a struggle, and sometimes to a defeat. The House of Com∣mons
adopted Mr. Dunning's motion, <Q>That the influence of the
Crown had increased, was increasing, and ought to be dimi∣nished:</Q>
and Mr. Burke's bill of reform was framed with skill,
introduced with eloquence, and supported by numbers. Our late
president, the American Secretary of State, very narrowly escaped
the sentence of proscription; but the unfortunate Board of Trade
was abolished in the committee by a small majority (207 to 199)
of eight votes. The storm, however, blew over for a time; a large
defection of country gentlemen eluded the sanguine hopes of the
patriots: the Lords of Trade were revived; administration reco∣vered
their strength and spirit; and the flames of London, which
were kindled by a mischievous madman, admonished all thinking
men of the danger of an appeal to the people. In the premature
dissolution which followed this session of parliament I lost my seat.
Mr. Elliot was now deeply engaged in the measures of opposition,
and the electors of Leskeard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The borough which Mr. Gibbon had represented in parliament.</NOTE> are commonly of the same opinion
as Mr. Elliot.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="184"/>
In this interval of my senatorial life, I published the second and
third volumes of the Decline and Fall. My ecclesiastical history still
breathed the same spirit of freedom; but protestant zeal is more
indifferent to the characters and controversies of the fourth and fifth
centuries. My obstinate silence had damped the ardour of the po∣lemics.
Dr. Watson, the most candid of my adversaries, assured me
that he had no thoughts of renewing the attack, and my impartial
balance of the virtues and vices of Julian was generally praised.
This truce was interrupted only by some animadversions of the Ca∣tholics
of Italy, and by some angry letters from Mr. Travis, who
made me personally responsible for condemning, with the best cri∣tics,
the spurious text of the three heavenly witnesses.</P>
<P>The piety or prudence of my Italian translator has provided an
antidote against the poison of his original. The 5th and 7th vo∣lumes
are armed with five letters from an anonymous divine to his
friends, Foothead and Kirk, two English students at Rome; and this
meritorious service is commended by Monsignor Stonor, a prelate of
the same nation, who discovers much venom in the <HI>fluid</HI> and nervous
style of Gibbon. The critical essay at the end of the third volume
was furnished by the Abbate Nicola Spedalieri, whose zeal has gra∣dually
swelled to a more solid confutation in two quarto volumes.—
Shall I be excused for not having read them?</P>
<P>The brutal insolence of Mr. Travis's challenge can only be excused
by the absence of learning, judgment, and humanity; and to that ex∣cuse
he has the fairest or foulest pretension. Compared with Arch∣deacon
Travis, Chelsum and Davies assume the title of respectable
enemies.</P>
<P>The bigotted advocate of popes and monks may be turned over
even to the bigots of Oxford; and the wretched Travis still smarts
under the lash of the merciless Porson. I consider Mr. Porson's
answer to Archdeacon Travis as the most acute and accurate piece of
criticism which has appeared since the days of Bentley. His stric∣tures
<PB N="160" REF="185"/>
are founded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened
with wit; and his adversary neither deserves nor finds any quarter at
his hands. The evidence of the three heavenly witnesses would now
be rejected in any court of justice: but prejudice is blind, authority
is deaf, and our vulgar bibles will ever be polluted by this spurious
text, <Q>sedet aeternumque sedebit.</Q> The more learned ecclesiastics will
indeed have the secret satisfaction of reprobating in the closet what
they read in the church.</P>
<P>I perceived, and without surprise, the coldness and even prejudice
of the town; nor could a whisper escape my ear, that, in the judg∣ment
of many readers, my continuation was much inferior to the
original attempts. An author who cannot ascend will always appear
to sink: envy was now prepared for my reception, and the zeal of
my religious, was fortified by the motive of my political, enemies.
Bishop Newton, in writing his own life, was at full liberty to declare
how much he himself and two eminent brethren were disgusted by
Mr. G.'s prolixity, tediousness, and affectation. But the old man
should not have indulged his zeal in a false and feeble charge against
the historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Extract from</HI> Mr. GIBBON's <HI>Common Place Book.</HI></P>
<P>Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol and Dean of St. Paul's, was born at Litchfield on the 21st of December 1703, O. S. (1 st January 1704, N. S.), and died the 14th of February 1782, in the 79th year of his age. A few days before his death he finished the memoirs of his own life, which have been prefixed to an edition of his posthu∣mous works, first published in quarto, and since (1787) re-published in six volume octavo.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 173, 174. Some books were published in 1781, which employed some of the Bishop's leisure hours, and during his illness. Mr. Gibbon's <HI>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Émpire</HI> he read throughout, but it by no means answered his expecta∣tion; for he found it rather a prolix and tedious performance, his matter uninteresting, and his style affected; his testimonies not to be depended upon, and his frequent scoffs at religion offensive to every sober mind. He had before been convicted of making false quotations, which should have taught him more prudence and caution. But, without examining his authorities, there is one which must necessarily strike every man who has read Dr. Burnet's Treatise <HI>de Statú Mortuorum.</HI> In vol. iii. p. 99. Mr. G. has the following note:—<Q>Burnet (<HI>de S. M.</HI> p. 56—84.) collects the opinions of the Fathers, as far as they assert the sleep or repose of human souls till the day of judg∣ment. He afterwards exposes (p. 91.) the inconveniences which must arise if they possessed a more active and sensible existence. Who would not from hence infer that Dr. B. was an advocate for the sleep or insensible existence of the soul after death? whereas his doctrine is directly the contrary. He has employed some chap∣ters in treating of the state of human souls in the interval between death and the resurrection; and after various proofs from reason, from scripture, and the Fathers, his conclusions are, that human souls exist after their separation from the body, that they are in a good or evil state according to their good or ill behaviour, but that neither their happiness nor their misery will be complete or perfect before the day of judgment. His argumentation is thus summed up at the end of the 4th chapter—<HI>Ex quibus constat primo, animas superesse extincto corpore; secundo, bonas bene, malas male se habituras; tertio, nec illis summam felicitatem, nec his summam miseriam, accessuram esse ante diem judicii.</HI></Q> (The Bishop's reading the whole was a greater compliment to the work than was paid to it by two of the most eminent of his brethren for their learn∣ing and station. The one entered upon it, but was soon wearied, and laid it aside in disgust: the other returned it upon the bookseller's hands; and it is said that Mr. G. himself happened unluckily to be in the shop at the same time.)</P>
<P>Does the Bishop comply with his own precept in the next page? (p. 175.) <Q>Old age should lenify, should soften men's manners, and make them more mild and gentle; but often has the contrary effect, hardens their hearts, and makes them more sour and crabbed.</Q> —He is speaking of Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>Have I ever infinuated that preferment-hunting is the great occupation of an eccle∣siastical life? (Memoirs passim); that a minister's influence and a bishop's patronage are sometimes pledged eleven deep? (p. 151.) that a prebendary considers the audit week as the better part of the year? (p. 127.) or that the most eminent of priests, the pope himself, would change their religion, if any thing better could be offered them? (p. 56.) Such things are more than insinuated in the Bishop's Life, which afforded some scandal to the church, and some diversion to the profane laity.</P></NOTE>, who had faithfully and even cautiously rendered Dr.
<PB N="161" REF="186"/>
Burnet's meaning by the alternative of sleep or repose. That philo∣sophic
divine supposes, that, in the period between death and the
resurrection, human souls exist without a body, endowed with in∣ternal
consciousness, but destitute of all active or passive connection
with the external world. <Q>Secundum communem dictionem sacrae
scripturae, mors dicitur somnus, et morientes dicuntur <HI>abdormire,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="187"/>
quod innuere mihi videtur statum mortis esse statum quietis, silentii,
et <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q> (<HI>De Statû Mortuorum,</HI> ch. v. p. 98.)</P>
<P>I was however encouraged by some domestic and foreign testimo∣nies
of applause; and the second and third volumes insensibly rose in
sale and reputation to a level with the first. But the public is seldom
wrong; and I am inclined to believe that, especially in the begin∣ning,
they are more prolix and less entertaining than the first: my
efforts had not been relaxed by success, and I had rather deviated
into the opposite fault of minute and superfluous diligence. On the
Continent, my name and writings were slowly diffused: a French
translation of the first volume had disappointed the booksellers of
Paris; and a passage in the third was construed as a personal reflec∣tion
on the reigning monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be generally known that Louis the Sixteenth is a great reader, and a reader of English books. On perusing a passage of my History which seems to compare him to Arcadius or Honorius, he expressed his resentment to the Prince of B *****, from whom the intelligence was conveyed to me. I shall neither disclaim the allusion, nor examine the likeness; but the situation of the late King of France excludes all suspicion of flattery; and I am ready to declare that the concluding observations of my third volume were written before his accession to the throne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before I could apply for a seat at the general election the list was
already full; but Lord North's promise was sincere, his recommend∣ation
was effectual, and I was soon chosen on a vacancy for the
borough of Lymington, in Hampshire. In the first session of the
new parliament, administration stood their ground; their final over∣throw
was reserved for the second. The American war had once
been the favourite of the country: the pride of England was irritated
by the resistance of her colonies, and the executive power was driven
by national clamour into the most vigorous and coercive measures.
But the length of a fruitless contest, the loss of armies, the accumu∣lation
of debt and taxes, and the hostile confederacy of France, Spain,
and Holland, indisposed the public to the American war, and the
<PB N="163" REF="188"/>
persons by whom it was conducted; the representatives of the people,
followed, at a slow distance, the changes of their opinion; and the
ministers who refused to bend, were broken by the tempest. As
soon as Lord North had lost, or was about to lose, a majority in the
House of Commons, he surrendered his office, and retired to a pri∣vate
station, with the tranquil assurance of a clear conscience and a
cheerful temper: the old fabric was dissolved, and the posts of go∣vernment
were occupied by the victorious and veteran troops of op∣position.
The lords of trade were not immediately dismissed, but
the board itself was abolished by Mr. Burke's bill, which decency
had compelled the patriots to revive; and I was stripped of a conve∣nient
salary, after having enjoyed it about three years.</P>
<P>So flexible is the title of my History, that the final aera might be
fixed at my own choice; and I long hesitated whether I should be
content with the three volumes, the fall of the Western empire,
which fulfilled my first engagement with the public. In this interval
of suspence, nearly a twelvemonth, I returned by a natural impulse
to the Greek authors of antiquity; I read with new pleasure the
Iliad and the Odyssey, the Histories of Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Xenophon, a large portion of the tragic and comic theatre of
Athens, and many interesting dialogues of the Socratic school. Yet
in the luxury of freedom I began to wish for the daily task, the
active pursuit, which gave a value to every book, and an object to
every inquiry: the preface of a new edition announced my design,
and I dropped without reluctance from the age of Plato to that of
Justinian. The original texts of Procopius and Agathias supplied the
events and even the characters of his reign: but a laborious winter
was devoted to the Codes, the Pandects, and the modern interpre∣ters,
before I presumed to form an abstract of the civil law. My
skill was improved by practice, my diligence perhaps was quickened
by the loss of office; and, excepting the last chapter, I had finished the
<PB N="164" REF="189"/>
fourth volume before I sought a retreat on the banks of the Leman
Lake.</P>
<P>It is not the purpose of this narrative to expatiate on the public or
secret history of the times: the schism which followed the death of
the Marquis of Rockingham, the appointment of the Earl of Shel∣burne,
the resignation of Mr. Fox, and his famous coalition with
Lord North. But I may assert, with some degree of assurance, that
in their political conflict those great antagonists had never felt any
personal animosity to each other, that their reconciliation was easy
and sincere, and that their friendship has never been clouded by the
shadow of suspicion or jealousy. The most violent or venal of their
respective followers embraced this fair occasion of revolt, but their
alliance still commanded a majority in the House of Commons; the
peace was censured, Lord Shelburne resigned, and the two friends
knelt on the same cushion to take the oath of secretary of state.
From a principle of gratitude I adhered to the coalition: my vote
was counted in the day of battle, but I was overlooked in the divi∣sion
of the spoil. There were many claimants more deserving and
importunate than myself: the board of trade could not be restored;
and, while the list of places was curtailed, the number of candidates
was doubled. An easy dismission to a secure seat at the board of
customs or excise was promised on the first vacancy: but the chance
was distant and doubtful; nor could I solicit with much ardour an
ignoble servitude, which would have robbed me of the most valu∣able
of my studious hours: at the same time the tumult of London,
and the attendance on parliament, were grown more irksome; and,
without some additional income, I could not long or prudently main∣tain
the stile of expence to which I was accustomed.</P>
<P>From my early acquaintance with Lausanne I had always cherished
a secret wish, that the school of my youth might become the retreat
of my declining age. A moderate fortune would secure the blessings
<PB N="165" REF="190"/>
of ease, leisure, and independence: the country, the people, the
manners, the language, were congenial to my taste; and I might in∣dulge
the hope of passing some years in the domestic society of a
friend. After travelling with several English<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Richard Worsley, Lord Chesterfield, Broderick Lord Midleton, and Mr. Hume, brother to Sir Abraham.</NOTE> Mr. Deyverdun was
now settled at home, in a pleasant habitation, the gift of his deceased
aunt: we had long been separated, we had long been silent; yet in
my first letter I exposed, with the most perfect confidence, my situ∣ation,
my sentiments, and my designs. His immediate answer was
a warm and joyful acceptance: the picture of our future life pro∣voked
my impatience; and the terms of arrangement were short
and simple, as he possessed the property, and I undertook the ex∣pence
of our common house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letters, No. CXXV. CXXVI. CXXVII. CXXVIII. CXXIX. CXXX.</NOTE> Before I could break my English
chain, it was incumbent on me to struggle with the feelings of my
heart, the indolence of my temper, and the opinion of the world,
which unanimously condemned this voluntary banishment. In the
disposal of my effects, the library, a sacred deposit, was alone ex∣cepted:
as my post-chaise moved over Westminster-bridge I bid a
long farewel to the <Q>fumum et opes strepitum{que} Romae.</Q> My jour∣ney
by the direct road through France was not attended with any
accident, and I arrived at Lausanne nearly twenty years after my
second departure. Within less than three months the coalition struck
on some hidden rocks: had I remained on board, I should have
perished in the general shipwreck<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, No. CL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Since my establishment at Lausanne, more than seven years have
elapsed; and if every day has not been equally soft and serene, not
a day, not a moment, has occurred in which I have repented of my
choice. During my absence, a long portion of human life, many
changes had happened: my elder acquaintance had left the stage;
<PB N="166" REF="191"/>
virgins were ripened into matrons, and children were grown to the
age of manhood. But the same manners were transmitted from one
generation to another: my friend alone was an inestimable treasure;
my name was not totally forgotten, and all were ambitious to wel∣come
the arrival of a stranger and the return of a fellow-citizen. The
first winter was given to a general embrace, without any nice discri∣mination
of persons and characters. After a more regular settlement,
a more accurate survey, I discovered three solid and permanent bene∣fits
of my new situation. 1. My personal freedom had been some∣what
impaired by the House of Commons and the Board of Trade;
but I was now delivered from the chain of duty and dependence,
from the hopes and fears of political adventure: my sober mind was
no longer intoxicated by the fumes of party, and I rejoiced in my
escape, as often as I read of the midnight debates which preceded the
dissolution of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Letter, No. CXLVI.</NOTE>. 2. My English oeconomy had been that
of a solitary bachelor, who might afford some occasional dinners. In
Switzerland I enjoyed at every meal, at every hour, the free and plea∣sant
conversation of the friend of my youth; and my daily table was
always provided for the reception of one or two extraordinary
guests. Our importance in society is less a positive than a relative
weight: in London I was lost in the crowd; I ranked with the first
families of Lausanne, and my style of prudent expence enabled me
to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities. 3. Instead of a
small house between a street and a stable-yard, I began to occupy a
spacious and convenient mansion, connected on the north side with
the city, and open on the south to a beautiful and boundless horizon.
A garden of four acres had been laid out by the taste of Mr. Deyver∣dun:
from the garden a rich scenery of meadows and vineyards de∣scends
to the Leman Lake, and the prospect far beyond the Lake is
crowned by the stupendous mountains of Savoy. My books and my
acquaintance had been first united in London; but this happy posi∣tion
<PB N="167" REF="192"/>
of my library in town and country was finally reserved for
Lausanne. Possessed of every comfort in this triple alliance, I could
not be tempted to change my habitation with the changes of the
seasons.</P>
<P>My friends had been kindly apprehensive that I should not be able
to exist in a Swiss town at the foot of the Alps, after having so long
conversed with the first men of the first cities of the world. Such lofty
connections may attract the curious, and gratify the vain; but I am
too modest, or too proud, to rate my own value by that of my asso∣ciates;
and whatsoever may be the fame of learning or genius, ex∣perience
has shewn me that the cheaper qualifications of politeness
and good sense are of more useful currency in the commerce of life.
By many, conversation is esteemed as a theatre or a school: but,
after the morning has been occupied by the labours of the library, I
wish to unbend rather than to exercise my mind; and in the interval
between tea and supper I am far from disdaining the innocent amuse∣ment
of a game at cards. Lausanne is peopled by a numerous
gentry, whose companionable idleness is seldom disturbed by the
pursuits of avarice or ambition: the women, though consined to a
domestic education, are endowed for the most part with more taste
and knowledge than their husbands and brothers: but the decent
freedom of both sexes is equally remote from the extremes of sim∣plicity
and refinement. I shall add as a misfortune rather than a
merit, that the situation and beauty of the Pays de Vaud, the long
habits of the English, the medical reputation of Dr. Tissot, and the
fashion of viewing the mountains and <HI>Glaciers,</HI> have opened us on
all sides to the incursions of foreigners. The visits of Mr. and Ma∣dame
Necker, of Prince Henry of Prussia, and of Mr. Fox, may from
some pleasing exceptions; but, in general, Lausanne has appeared
most agreeable in my eyes, when we have been abandoned to our
own society. I had frequently seen Mr. Necker, in the summer of
1784, at a country house near Lausanne, where he composed his
<PB N="168" REF="193"/>
Treatise on the Administration of the Finances. I have since, in
October 1790, visited him in his present residence, the castle and
barony of Copet, near Geneva. Of the merits and measures of that
statesman various opinions may be entertained; but all impartial men
must agree in their esteem of his integrity and patriotism.</P>
<P>In the month of August 1784, Prince Henry of Prussia, in his way
to Paris, passed three days at Lausanne. His military conduct has
been praised by professional men; his character has been vilified by
the wit and malice of a daemon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoire Secret de la Cour de Berlin.</NOTE>; but I was flattered by his affabi∣lity,
and entertained by his conversation.</P>
<P>In his tour of Switzerland (September 1788) Mr. Fox gave me
two days of free and private society<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Letter in the Continuation, October 1, 1788.</NOTE>. He seemed to feel, and even
to envy, the happiness of my situation; while I admired the powers
of a superior man, as they are blended in his attractive character
with the softness and simplicity of a child. Perhaps no human being
was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, va∣nity,
or falsehood.</P>
<P>My transmigration from London to Lausanne could not be ef∣fected
without interrupting the course of my historical labours. The
hurry of my departure, the joy of my arrival, the delay of my tools,
suspended their progress; and a full twelvemonth was lost before I
could resume the thread of regular and daily industry. A number
of books most requisite and least common had been previously
selected; the academical library of Lausanne, which I could use as
my own, contained at least the fathers and councils; and I have de∣rived
some occasional succour from the public collections of Berne
and Geneva. The fourth volume was soon terminated, by an ab∣stract
of the controversies of the Incarnation, which the learned
Dr. Prideaux was apprehensive of exposing to profane eyes. It had
been the original design of the learned Dean Prideaux to write the
<PB N="169" REF="194"/>
history of the ruin of the Eastern Church. In this work it would
have been necessary, not only to unravel all those controversies
which the Christians made about the hypostatical union, but also to
unfold all the niceties and subtle notions which each sect entertained
concerning it. The pious historian was apprehensive of exposing
that incomprehensible mystery to the cavils and objections of unbe∣lievers;
and he durst not, <Q>seeing the nature of this book, venture
it abroad in so wanton and lewd an age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See preface to the Life of Mahomet, p. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the fifth and sixth volumes the revolutions of the empire and
the world are most rapid, various, and instructive; and the Greek
or Roman historians are checked by the hostile narratives of the bar∣barians
of the East and the West<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have followed the judicious precept of the Abbé de Mably, (Manière d'ecrire l'Histoire, p. 110.) who advises the historian not to dwell too minutely on the decay of the eastern empire; but to consider the barbarian conquerors as a more worthy subject of his narrative. <Q>Fas est et ab hoste doceri.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was not till after many designs, and many trials, that I pre∣ferred,
as I still prefer, the method of grouping my picture by na∣tions;
and the seeming neglect of chronological order is surely com∣pensated
by the superior merits of interest and perspicuity. The
style of the first volume is, in my opinion, somewhat crude and ela∣borate;
in the second and third it is ripened into ease, correctness,
and numbers; but in the three last I may have been seduced by
the facility of my pen, and the constant habit of speaking one lan∣guage
and writing another may have infused some mixture of Gallic
idioms. Happily for my eyes, I have always closed my studies with
the day, and commonly with the morning; and a long, but tem∣perate,
labour has been accomplished, without fatiguing either the
mind or body; but when I computed the remainder of my time and
my task, it was apparent that, according to the season of publica∣tion,
the delay of a month would be productive of that of a year.
I was now straining for the goal, and in the last winter many even∣ings
<PB N="170" REF="195"/>
were borrowed from the social pleasures of Lausanne. I could
now wish that a pause, an interval, had been allowed for a serious
revisal.</P>
<P>I have presumed to mark the moment of conception: I shall now
commemorate the hour of my final deliverance. It was on the day,
or rather night, of the 27th of June 1787, between the hours of
eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page, in a
summer-house in my garden. After laying down my pen, I took
several turns in a <HI>berceau,</HI> or covered walk of acacias, which com∣mands
a prospect of the country, the lake, and the mountains. The
air was temperate, the sky was serene, the silver orb of the moon
was reflected from the waters, and all nature was silent. I will not
dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom,
and, perhaps, the establishment of my fame. But my pride was
soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by
the idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable
companion, and that whatsoever might be the future date of my
History, the life of the historian must be short and precarious. I
will add two facts, which have seldom occurred in the composition
of six, or at least of five, quartos. 1. My first rough manuscript,
without any intermediate copy, has been sent to the press. 2. Not a
sheet has been seen by any human eyes, excepting those of the author
and the printer: the faults and the merits are exclusively my own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Extract from</HI> Mr. GIBBON's <HI>Common-place Book.</HI></Q>

<P>These three volumes were sent to press August 15th, 1787, and the whole im∣pression was concluded April following.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I cannot help recollecting a much more extraordinary fact, which
is affirmed of himself by Retif de la Bretorme, a voluminous and
original writer of French novels. He laboured, and may still labour,
<PB N="171" REF="196"/>
in the humble office of corrector to a printing-house; but this office
enabled him to transport an entire volume from his mind to the
press; and his work was given to the public without ever having
been written with a pen.</P>
<P>After a quiet residence of four years, during which I had never
moved ten miles from Lausanne, it was not without some reluct∣ance
and terror that I undertook, in a journey of two hundred
leagues, to cross the mountains and the sea. Yet this formidable
adventure was atchieved without danger or fatigue; and at the end
of a fortnight I found myself in Lord Sheffield's house and library,
safe, happy, and at home. The character of my friend (Mr. Hol∣royd)
had recommended him to a seat in parliament for Coventry,
the command of a regiment of light dragoons, and an Irish peerage.
The sense and spirit of his political writings have decided the public
opinion on the great questions of our commercial interest with Ame∣rica
and Ireland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations on the Commerce of the American States, by John Lord Shessield, the 6th edition, London, 1784, in octavo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sale of his Observations on the American States was diffusive,
their effect beneficial; the Navigation Act, the palladium of Britain,
was defended, and perhaps saved, by his pen; and he proves, by
the weight of fact and argument, that the mother-country may sur∣vive
and flourish after the loss of America. My friend has never
cultivated the arts of composition; but his materials are copious and
correct, and he leaves on his paper the clear impression of an active
and vigorous mind. His "Observations on the Trade, Manufac∣tures,
and present State of Ireland," were intended to guide the
industry, to correct the prejudices, and to assuage the passions of a
country which seemed to forget that she could be free and pro∣sperous
only by a friendly connection with Great Britain. The con∣cluding
observations are written with so much ease and spirit, that
they may be read by those who are the least interested in the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="197"/>
He fell (in 1784) with the unpopular coalition; but his merit has
been acknowledged at the last general election, 1790, by the ho∣nourable
invitation and free choice of the city of Bristol. During
the whole time of my residence in England I was entertained at
Sheffield-Place and in Downing-Street by his hospitable kindness;
and the most pleasant period was that which I passed in the domestic
society of the family. In the larger circle of the metropolis I ob∣served
the country and the inhabitants with the knowledge, and
without the prejudices, of an Englishman; but I rejoiced in the ap∣parent
increase of wealth and prosperity, which might be fairly
divided between the spirit of the nation and the wisdom of the mi∣nister.
All party-resentment was now lost in oblivion: since I was
no man's rival, no man was my enemy. I felt the dignity of inde∣pendence,
and as I asked no more, I was satisfied with the general
civilities of the world. The house in London which I frequented
with most pleasure and assiduity was that of Lord North. After
the loss of power and of sight, he was still happy in himself and
his friends; and my public tribute of gratitude and esteem could no
longer be suspected of any intrested motive. Before my departure
from England, I was present at the august spectacle of Mr. Hastings's
trial in Westminster Hall. It is not my province to absolve or con∣demn
the Governor of India; but Mr. Sheridan's eloquence de∣manded
my applause; nor could I hear without emotion the per∣sonal
compliment which he paid me in the presence of the British
nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He said the facts that made up the volume of narrative were unparalleled in atro∣ciousness, and that nothing equal in criminality was to be traced, either in ancient or modern history, in the correct periods of Tacitus or the luminous page of Gibbon. <HI>Morning Chronicle, June</HI> 14, 1788.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this display of genius, which blazed four successive days,
I shall stoop to a very mechanical circumstance. As I was waiting
in the managers' box, I had the curiosity to inquire of the short∣hand
<PB N="173" REF="198"/>
writer, how many words a ready and rapid orator might pro∣nounce
in an hour? From 7000 to 7500 was his answer. The me∣dium
of 7200 will afford 120 words in a minute, and two words in
each second. But this computation will only apply to the English
language.</P>
<P>As the publication of my three last volumes was the principal ob∣ject,
so it was the first care of my English journey. The previous
arrangements with the bookseller and the printer were settled in my
passage through London, and the proofs, which I returned more
correct, were transmitted every post from the press to Sheffield-Place.
The length of the operation, and the leisure of the country, allowed
some time to review my manuscript. Several rare and useful books,
the Assises de Jerusalem, Ramusius de Bello C. P<SUP>aro</SUP>, the Greek Acts of
the Synod of Florence, the Statuta Urbis Romae, &amp;c. were procured,
and introduced in their proper places the supplements which they af∣forded.
The impression of the fourth volume had consumed three
months. Our common interest required that we should move with
a quicker pace; and Mr. Strahan fulfilled his engagement, which
few printers could sustain, of delivering every week three thousand
copies of nine sheets. The day of publication was, however, de∣layed,
that it might coincide with the fifty-first anniversary of my
own birth-day; the double festival was celebrated by a cheerful
literary dinner at Mr. Cadell's house; and I seemed to blush while
they read an elegant compliment from Mr. Hayley<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>OCCASIONAL STANZAS, <HI>by</HI> MR.

the invitation of the English Sparrow, who chirped in the
groves of Eartham, near Chichester. As most of the former pur∣chasers
were naturally desirous of completing their sets, the sale of
the quarto edition was quick and easy; and an octavo size was
printed, to satisfy at a cheaper rate the public demand. The con∣clusion
of my work was generally read, and variously judged. The
style has been exposed to much academical criticism; a religious cla∣mour
was revived, and the reproach of indecency has been loudly
echoed by the rigid censors of morals. I never could understand
the clamour that has been raised against the indecency of my three
last volumes. 1. An equal degree of freedom in the former part,
especially in the first volume, had passed without reproach. 2. I am
justified in painting the manners of the times; the vices of Theodora
form an essential feature in the reign and character of Justinian.
3. My English text is chaste, and all licentious passages are left in
the obscurity of a learned language. <HI>Le Latin dans ses mots brave
l'honnêteté,</HI> says the correct Boileau, in a country and idiom more
scrupulous than our own. Yet, upon the whole, the History of
the Decline and Fall seems to have struck root, both at home and
abroad, and may, perhaps, a hundred years hence still continue to
<PB N="177" REF="202"/>
be abused. I am less flattered by Mr. Porson's high encomium on
the style and spirit of my history, than I am satisfied with his ho∣nourable
testimony to my attention, diligence, and accuracy; those
humble virtues, which religious zeal had most audaciously denied.

<P>The French, Italian, and German translations have been executed
with various success; but, instead of patronizing, I should willingly
<PB N="178" REF="203"/>
suppress such imperfect copies, which injure the character, while
they propagate the name of the author. The first volume had been
feebly, though faithfully, translated into French by M. Le Clerc de
Septchenes, a young gentleman of a studious character and liberal
fortune. After his decease the work was continued by two manu∣facturers
of Paris, M. M. Desmuniers and Cantwell: but the former
is now an active member in the national assembly, and the un∣dertaking
languishes in the hands of his associate. The superior
merit of the interpreter, or his language, inclines me to prefer the Ita∣lian
version: but I wish that it were in my power to read the German,
which is praised by the best judges. The Irish pirates are at once
my friends and my enemies. But I cannot be displeased with the
two numerous and correct impressions which have been published
for the use of the continent at Basil in Switzerland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of their fourteen octavo volumes the two last include the whole body of the notes. The public importunity had forced <HI>me</HI> to remove them from the end of the volume to the bottom of the page; but I have often repented of my compliance.</NOTE>. The con∣quests
of our language and literature are not confined to Europe
alone, and a writer who succeeds in London, is speedily read on the
banks of the Delaware and the Ganges.</P>
<P>In the preface of the fourth volume, while I gloried in the name
of an Englishman, I announced my approaching return to the neigh∣bourhood
of the Lake of Lausanne. This last trial confirmed my
assurance that I had wisely chosen for my own happiness; nor did
I once, in a year's visit, entertain a wish of settling in my native
country. Britain is the free and fortunate island; but where is the
spot in which I could unite the comforts and beauties of my esta∣blishment
at Lausanne? The tumult of London astonished my eyes
and ears; the amusements of public places were no longer adequate
to the trouble; the clubs and assemblies were filled with new faces and
young men; and our best society, our long and late dinners, would
<PB N="179" REF="204"/>
soon have been prejudicial to my health. Without any share in the
political wheel, I must be idle and insignificant: yet the most splen∣did
temptations would not have enticed me to engage a second time
in the servitude of parliament or office. At Tunbridge, some weeks
after the publication of my History, I reluctantly quitted Lord and
Lady Sheffield, and, with a young Swiss friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Wilhelm. de Severy.</NOTE>, whom I had intro∣duced
to the English world, I pursued the road of Dover and Lau∣sanne.
My habitation was embellished in my absence, and the last
division of books, which followed my steps, increased my chosen
library to the number of between six and seven thousand volumes.
My seraglio was ample, my choice was free, my appetite was keen.
After a full repast on Homer and Aristophanes, I involved myself
in the philosophic maze of the writings of Plato, of which the dra∣matic
is, perhaps, more interesting than the argumentative part:
but I stepped aside into every path of inquiry which reading or re∣flection
accidentally opened.</P>
<P>Alas! the joy of my return, and my studious ardour, were soon
damped by the melancholy state of my friend Mr. Deyverdun. His
health and spirits had long suffered a gradual decline, a succession of
apoplectic fits anounced his dissolution; and before he expired, those
who loved him could not wish for the continuance of his life. The
voice of reason might congratulate his deliverance, but the feelings
of nature and friendship could be subdued only by time: his ami∣able
character was still alive in my remembrance; each room, each
walk, was imprinted with our common footsteps; and I should blush
at my own philosophy, if a long interval of study had not preceded
and followed the death of my friend. By his last will he left to me
the option of purchasing his house and garden, or of possessing them
during my life, on the payment either of a stipulated price, or of
<PB N="180" REF="205"/>
an easy retribution to his kinsman and heir. I should probably have
been tempted by the daemon of property, if some legal difficulties
had not been started against my title: a contest would have been
vexatious, doubtful, and invidious; and the heir most gratefully
subscribed an agreement, which rendered my life-possession more
perfect, and his future condition more advantageous. Yet I had
often revolved the judicious lines in which Pope answers the objec∣tions
of his long-sighted friend:</P>
<LG>
<L>Pity to build without or child or wife;</L>
<L>Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life:</L>
<L>Well, if the use be mine, does it concern one,</L>
<L>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</L>
</LG>
<P>The certainty of my tenure has allowed me to lay out a considerable
sum in improvements and alterations: they have been executed with
skill and taste; and few men of letters, perhaps, in Europe, are so desira∣bly
lodged as myself. But I feel, and with the decline of years I shall
more painfully feel, that I am alone in paradise. Among the circle
of my acquaintance at Lausanne, I have gradually acquired the solid
and tender friendship of a respectable family<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The family of de Severy.</NOTE>: the four persons of
whom it is composed are all endowed with the virtues best adapted
to their age and situation; and I am encouraged to love the parents
as a brother, and the children as a father. Every day we seek and
find the opportunities of meeting: yet even this valuable connection
cannot supply the loss of domestic society.</P>
<P>Within the last two or three years our tranquillity has been clouded
by the disorders of France: many families at Lausanne were alarmed
and affected by the terrors of an impending bankruptcy; but the re∣volution,
or rather the dissolution of the kingdom has been heard and
felt in the adjacent lands.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="206"/>
I beg leave to subscribe my assent to Mr. Burke's creed on the re∣volution
of France. I admire his eloquence, I approve his politics,
I adore his chivalry, and I can almost excuse his reverence for church
establishments. I have sometimes thought of writing a dialogue of
the dead, in which Lucian, Erasmus, and Voltaire should mutually
acknowledge the danger of exposing an old superstition to the con∣tempt
of the blind and fanatic multitude.</P>
<P>A swarm of emigrants of both sexes, who escaped from the public
ruin, has been attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the lan∣guage
of Lausanne; and our narrow habitations in town and coun∣try
are now occupied by the first names and titles of the departed
monarchy. These noble fugitives are entitled to our pity; they may
claim our esteem, but they cannot, in their present state of mind and
fortune, much contribute to our amusement. Instead of looking
down as calm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our do∣mestic
harmony is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party
spirit: our ladies and gentlemen assume the character of self-taught
politicians; and the sober dictates of wisdom and experience are
silenced by the clamour of the triumphant <HI>democrates.</HI> The fanatic
missionaries of sedition have scattered the seeds of discontent in our
cities and villages, which had flourished above two hundred and fifty
years without fearing the approach of war, or feeling the weight of
government. Many individuals, and some communities, appear to
be infested with the Gallic phrenzy, the wild theories of equal and
boundless freedom; but I trust that the body of the people will be
faithful to their sovereign and to themselves; and I am satisfied that
the failure or success of a revolt would equally terminate in the ruin
of the country. While the aristocracy of Bern protects the happiness,
it is superfluous to enquire whether it be founded in the rights, of
man: the oeconomy of the state is liberally supplied without the aid
of taxes; and the magistrates <HI>must</HI> reign with prudence and equity,
since they are unarmed in the midst of an armed nation.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="207"/>
The revenue of Bern, excepting some small duties, is derived from
church lands, tithes, feudal rights, and interest of money. The re∣public
has nearly 500,000l. sterling in the. English funds, and the
amount of their treasure is unknown to the citizens themselves. For
myself (may the omen be averted) I can only declare, that the first
stroke of a rebel drum would be the signal of my immediate de∣parture.</P>
<P>When I contemplate the common lot of mortality, I must acknow∣ledge
that I have drawn a high prize in the lottery of life. The far
greater part of the globe is overspread with barbarism or slavery: in
the civilized world, the most numerous class is condemned to igno∣rance
and poverty; and the double fortune of my birth in a free and
enlightened country, in an honourable and wealthy family, is the
lucky chance of an unit against millions. The general probability is
about three to one, that a new-born infant will not live to complete
his fiftieth year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Buffon, Supplement à l'Histoire naturelle, tom. vii. page 158—164. of a given number of new-born infants, one half, by the fault of nature or man, is extin∣guished before the age of puberty and reason.—A melancholy calculation!</NOTE>. I have now passed that age, and may fairly esti∣mate
the present value of my existence in the three-fold division of
mind, body, and estate.</P>
<P>1. The first and indispensable requisite of happiness is a clear con∣science,
unsullied by the reproach or remembrance of an unworthy
action.</P>
<LG>
<L>—Hic murus aheneus esto,</L>
<L>Nil conscire sibi, nullâ pallescere culpâ.</L>
</LG>
<P>I am endowed with a cheerful temper, a moderate sensibility, and
a natural disposition to repose rather than to activity: some mischie∣vous
appetites and habits have perhaps been corrected by philosophy
or time. The love of study, a passion which derives fresh vigour
from enjoyment, supplies each day, each hour, with a perpetual
source of independent and rational pleasure; and I am not sensible
<PB N="183" REF="208"/>
of any decay of the mental faculties. The original soil has been highly
improved by cultivation; but it may be questioned, whether some
flowers of fancy, some grateful errors, have not been eradicated with
the weeds of prejudice. 2. Since I have escaped from the long perils
of my childhood, the serious advice of a physician has seldom been re∣quisite.
<Q>The madness of superfluous health</Q> I have never known;
but my tender constitution has been fortified by time, and the ines∣timable
gift of the sound and peaceful slumbers of infancy may be
imputed both to the mind and body. 3. I have already described
the merits of my society and situation; but these enjoyments would
be tasteless or bitter if their possession were not assured by an annual
and adequate supply. According to the scale of Switzerland, I am a
rich man; and I am indeed rich, since my income is superior to my
expence, and my expence is equal to my wishes. My friend Lord
Sheffield has kindly relieved me from the cares to which my taste and
temper are most adverse: shall I add, that since the failure of my first
wishes, I have never entertained any serious thoughts of a matrimo∣nial
connection?</P>
<P>I am disgusted with the affectation of men of letters, who com∣plain
that they have renounced a substance for a shadow; and that
their fame (which sometimes is no insupportable weight) affords a
poor compensation for envy, censure, and persecution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. d'Alembert relates, that as he was walking in the gardens of Sans Souci with the King of Prussia, Frederic said to him, <Q>Do you see that old woman, a poor weeder, asleep on that sunny bank? she is probably a more happy being than either of us.</Q> The king and the philosopher may speak for themselves; for my part I do not envy the old woman.</NOTE>. My own
experience, at least, has taught me a very different lesson: twenty
happy years have been animated by the labour of my History; and
its success has given me a name, a rank, a character, in the world,
to which I should not otherwise have been entitled. The freedom
of my writings has indeed provoked an implacable tribe; but, as I
<PB N="184" REF="209"/>
was safe from the stings, I was soon accustomed to the buzzing of
the hornets: my nerves are not tremblingly alive, and my literary
temper is so happily framed, that I am less sensible of pain than of
pleasure. The rational pride of an author may be offended, rather
than flattered, by vague indiscriminate praise; but he cannot, he
should not, be indifferent to the fair testimonies of private and public
esteem. Even his moral sympathy may be gratified by the idea, that
now, in the present hour, he is imparting some degree of amusement
or knowledge to his friends in a distant land: that one day his mind
will be familiar to the grandchildren of those who are yet unborn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the first of antient or modern romances (Tom Jones), this proud sentiment, this feast of fancy, is enjoyed by the genius of Fielding.—<Q>Come, bright love of fame, &amp;c. fill my ravished fancy with the hopes of charming ages yet to come.

Do thou teach me not only to foresee but to enjoy, nay even to feed on future praise.

I cannot boast of the friendship or favour of princes; the patronage
of English literature has long since been devolved on our booksellers,
and the measure of their liberality is the least ambiguous test of our
common success. Perhaps the golden mediocrity of my fortune has
contributed to fortify my application.</P>
<P>The present is a fleeting moment, the past is no more; and our
prospect of futurity is dark and doubtful. This day may <HI>possibly</HI> be
my last: but the laws of probability, so true in general, so fallacious
in particular, still allow about fifteen years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon, from our disregard of the possibility of death within the four and twenty hours, concludes that a chance, which falls below or rises above ten thousand to one, will never affect the hopes or fears of a reasonable man.

by the judgment and experience of the sage Fontenelle. His choice
is approved by the eloquent historian of nature, who sixes our moral
happiness to the mature season in which our passions are supposed to
be calmed, our duties fulfilled, our ambition satisfied, our fame and
fortune established on a solid basis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Buffon.</NOTE>. In private conversation, that
great and amiable man added the weight of his own experience; and
this autumnal felicity might be exemplified in the lives of Voltaire,
Hume, and many other men of letters. I am far more inclined to
embrace than to dispute this comfortable doctrine. I will not suppose
any premature decay of the mind or body; but I must reluctantly
observe that two causes, the abbreviation of time, and the failure of
hope, will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="211"/>
WHEN I first undertook to prepare Mr. Gibbon's Memoirs for
the press, I supposed that it would be necessary to introduce
some continuation of them, from the time when they cease, namely,
soon after his return to Switzerland in the year 1788; but the exa∣mination
of his correspondence with me suggested, that the best con∣tinuation
would be the publication of his letters from that time to
his death. I shall thus give more satisfaction, by employing the
language of Mr. Gibbon, instead of my own; and the public will
see him in a new and (I think) an admirable light, as a writer of
letters. By the insertion of a few occasional sentences, I shall obviate
the disadvantages that are apt to arise from an interrupted narration.
A prejudiced or a fastidious critic may condemn, perhaps, some parts
of the letters as trivial; but many readers, I flatter myself, will be
gratified by discovering even in these my friend's affectionate feelings,
and his character in familiar life. His letters in general bear a strong
resemblance to the style and turn of his conversation; the charac∣teristics
of which were vivacity, elegance, and precision, with know∣ledge
astonishingly extensive and correct. He never ceased to be
instructive and entertaining; and in general there was a vein of
pleasantry in his conversation which prevented its becoming languid,
even during a residence of many months with a family in the
country.</P>
<P>It has been supposed that he always arranged what he intended to
say, before he spoke; his quickness in conversation contradicts this
<PB N="188" REF="212"/>
notion: but it is very true, that before he sat down to write a note
or letter, he completely arranged in his mind what he meant to ex∣press.
he pursued the same method in respect to other composi∣tion;
and he occasionally would walk several times about his apart∣ment
before he had rounded a period to his taste. He has pleasantly
remarked to me, that it sometimes cost him many a turn before he
could throw a sentiment into a form that gratified his own criticism.
His systematic habit of arrangement in point of style, assisted, in his
instance, by an excellent memory and correct judgment, is much to
be recommended to those who aspire to any perfection in writing.</P>
<P>Although the Memoirs extend beyond the time of Mr. Gibbon's
return to Lausanne, I shall insert a few Letters, written immediately
after his arrival there, and combine them so far as to include even the
last note which he wrote a few days previously to his death. Some
of them contain few incidents; but they connect and carry on the
account either of his opinions or of his employment.</P>

<P>SATURDAY is now arrived, and I much doubt whether I shall have
time to finish. I rose, as usual, about seven; but as I knew I should
have so much time, you know it would have been ridiculous to
begin any thing before breakfast. When I returned from my break∣fast-room
to the library, unluckily I found on the table some new
and interesting books, which instantly caught my attention; and
without injuring my correspondent, I could safely bestow a single
hour to gratify my curiosity. Some things which I found in them
insensibly led me to other books, and other enquiries; the morning
has stolen away, and I shall be soon summoned to dress and dine
with the two Severys, father and son, who are returned from the
country on a disagreeable errand, an illness of Madame, from which
she is however recovering. Such is the faithful picture of my mind
and manners, and from a single day <HI>disce omnes.</HI> After having been
so long chained to the oar, in a splendid galley indeed, I freely and
fairly enjoy my liberty as I promised in my preface; range without
<PB N="191" REF="215"/>
control over the wide expanse of my library; converse, as my fancy
prompts me, with poets and historians, philosophers and orators, of
every age and language; and often indulge my meditations in the
invention and arrangement of mighty works, which I shall probably
never find time or application to execute. My garden, berçeau, and
pavilion often varied the scene of my studies; the beautiful weather
which we have enjoyed exhilarated my spirits, and I again tasted the
wisdom and happiness of my retirement, till that happiness was inter∣rupted
by a very serious calamity, which took from me for above a fort∣night
all thoughts of study, of amusement, and even of correspondence.
I mentioned in my first letter the uneasiness I felt at poor Deyverdun's
declining health, how much the pleasure of my life was embittered by
the sight of a suffering and languid friend. The joy of our meeting
appeared at first to revive him; and, though not satisfied, I began
to think, at least to hope, that he was every day gaining ground;
when, alas! one morning I was suddenly recalled from my berçeau
to the house, with the dreadful intelligence of an apoplectic stroke;
I found him senseless: the best assistance was instantly collected; and
he had the aid of the genius and experience of Mr. Tissot, and of the
assiduous care of another physician, who for some time scarcely
quitted his bedside either night or day. While I was in momentary
dread of a relapse, with a confession from his physicians that such a
relapse must be fatal, you will feel that I was much more to be
pitied than my friend. At length, art or nature triumphed over the
enemy of life. I was soon assured that all immediate danger was
past; and now for many days I have had the satisfaction of seeing
him recover, though by slow degrees, his health and strength, his
sleep and appetite. He now walks about the garden, and receives
his particular friends, but has not yet gone abroad. His future
health will depend very much upon his own prudence: but, at all
events, this has been a very serious warning; and the slightest indis∣position
will hereafter assume a very formidable aspect. But let us
<PB N="192" REF="216"/>
turn from this melancholy subject.—The Man of the People escaped
from the tumult, the bloody tumult of the Westminster election,
to the lakes and mountains of Switzerland, and I was informed
that he was arrived at the Lyon d'Or. I sent a compliment; he
answered it in person, and settled at my house for the remainder of
the day. I have eat and drank, and conversed and sat up all night
with Fox in England; but it never has happened, perhaps it never
can happen again, that I should enjoy him as I did that day, alone,
from ten in the morning till ten at night. Poor Deyverdun, before
his accident, wanted spirits to appear, and has regretted it since.
Our conversation never flagged a moment; and he seemed thoroughly
pleased with the place and with his company. We had little politics;
though he gave me, in a few words, such a character of Pitt, as one
great man should give of another his rival: much of books, from my
own, on which he flattered me very pleasantly, to Homer and the
Arabian Nights: much about the country, my garden (which he
understands far better than I do), and, upon the whole, I think he
envies me, and would do so were he minister. The next morning
I gave him a guide to walk him about the town and country, and in∣vited
some company to meet him at dinner. The following day he
continued his journey to Bern and Zurich, and I have heard of him
by various means. The people gaze on him as a prodigy, but he
shews little inclination to converse with them, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Our friend
<HI>Douglas</HI> has been curious, attentive, agreeable; and in every place
where he has resided some days, he has left acquaintance who
esteem and regret him: I never knew so clear and general an im∣pression.</P>
<P>After this long letter I have yet many things to say, though none
of any pressing consequence. I hope you are not idle in the deliver∣ance
of Beriton, though the late events and edicts in France begin
to reconcile me to the possession of dirty acres. What think you of
Necker and the States Generales? Are not the public expectations

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>April 25, 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE your letter, which I received yesterday, I was in the
anxious situation of a king, who hourly expects a courier from his
general, with the news of a decisive engagement. I had abstained
from writing, for fear of dropping a word, or betraying a feeling,
which might render you too cautious or too bold. On the famous
8th of April, between twelve and two, I reflected that the business
was determined; and each succeeding day I computed the speedy
approach of your messenger, with favourable or melancholy tidings.
When I broke the seal, I expected to read, <Q>What a damned un∣lucky
fellow you are! Nothing tolerable was offered, and I in∣dignantly
withdrew the estate.</Q> I <HI>did</HI> remember the fate of poor
Lenborough, and I was afraid of your magnanimity, &amp;c. It is
whimsical enough, but it is human nature, that I now begin to think
of the deep-rooted foundations of land, and the airy fabric of the
funds. I not only consent, but even wish, to have eight or ten thou∣sand
pounds on a good mortgage. The pipe of wine you sent to me
was seized, and would have been confiscated, if the government of
Berne had not treated me with the most flattering and distinguished
civility: they not only released the wine, but they paid out of their own
pocket the shares to which the bailiff and the informer were entitled
by law. I should not forget that the bailiff refused to accept of his
part. Poor Deyverdun's constitution is quite broken; he has had
two or three attacks, not so violent as the first: every time the door
is hastily opened, I expect to hear of some fatal accident: the best or
worst hopes of the physicians are only that he may linger some time
longer; but, if he lives till the summer, they propose sending him to
some mineral waters at Aix, in Savoy. You will be glad to hear
that I am now assured of possessing, during my life, this delightful
house and garden. The act has been lately executed in the best
form, and the handsomest manner. I know not what to say of your
<PB N="195" REF="219"/>
miracles at home: we rejoice in the king's recovery, and its ministe∣rial
consequences; and I cannot be insensible to the hope, at least the
chance, of seeing in this country a first lord of trade, or secretary at
war. In your answer, which I shall impatiently expect, you will
give me a full and true account of your designs, which by this time
must have dropt, or be determined at least, for the present year. If
you come, it is high time that we should look out for a house—a
task much less easy than you may possibly imagine. Among new

<P>YOU are in truth a wise, active, indefatigable, and inestimable
friend; and as our virtues are often connected with our faults, if
you were more tame and placid, you would be perhaps of less use
and value. A very important and difficult transaction seems to be
nearly terminated with success and mutual satisfaction: we seem to
run before the wind with a prosperous gale; and, unless we should
strike on some secret rocks which I do not foresee, shall, on or
before the 31st July, enter the harbour of Content; though I cannot
pursue the metaphor by adding we shall <HI>land,</HI> since our operation is
of a very opposite tendency. I could not easily forgive myself for
shutting you up in a dark room with parchments and attornies, did
I not reflect that this probably is the last material trouble that you
will ever have on my account; and that after the labours and delays
of twenty years, I shall at last attain what I have always sighed for,
a clear and competent income, above my wants, and equal to my
wishes. In this contemplation you will be sufficiently rewarded. I
hope * * * * * will be content with our title-deeds, for I cannot furnish
<PB N="196" REF="220"/>
another shred of parchment. Mrs. Gibbon's jointure is secured on
the Beriton estate, and her legal consent is requisite for the sale.
Again and again I must repeat my hope that she is perfectly satis∣fied,
and that the close of her life may not be embittered by suspi∣cion,
or fear, or discontent. What new security does she prefer,—
the funds, the mortgage, or your land? At all events she must be
made easy. I wrote to her again some time ago, and begged that if
she were too weak to write, she would desire Mrs. Gould or Mrs.
Holroyd to give me a line concerning her state of health. To this
no answer; I am afraid she is displeased.</P>
<P>Now for the disposal of the money: I approve of the 8000l.
mortgage on Beriton; and honour your prudence in not shewing,
by the comparison of the rent and interest, how foolish it is to pur∣chase
land. * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.
There is a chance of my drawing a considerable sum into this coun∣try,
for an arrangement which you yourself must approve, but
which I have not time to explain at present. For the sake of dis∣patching,
by this evening's post, an answer to your letter which ar∣rived
this morning, I confine myself to the <HI>needful,</HI> but in the
course of a few days I will send a more familiar epistle. Adieu.
Ever yours.</P>

<P>POOR Deyverdun is no more: he expired Saturday the 4th instant;
and in his unfortunate situation, death could only be viewed by him∣self,
and by his friends, in the light of a consummation devoutly to
be wished. Since September he has had a dozen apoplectic strokes,
more or less violent: in the intervals between them his strength gra∣dually
decayed; every principle of life was exhausted; and had he
continued to drag a miserable existence, he must probably have sur∣vived
the loss of his faculties. Of all misfortunes this was what he
<PB N="197" REF="221"/>
himself most apprehended: but his reason was clear and calm to the
last; he beheld his approaching dissolution with the firmness of a
philosopher. I fancied that time and reflection had prepared me for
the event; but the habits of three-and-thirty years friendship are not
so easily broken. The first days, and more especially the first nights,
were indeed painful. Last Wednesday and Saturday it would not
have been in my power to write. I must now recollect myself, since
it is necessary for me not only to impart the news, but to ask your
opinion in a very serious and doubtful question, which must be de∣cided
without loss of time. I shall state the facts, but as I am on the
spot, and as new lights may occur, I do not promise implicit obe∣dience.</P>
<P>Had my poor friend died without a will, a female <HI>first</HI> cousin
settled somewhere in the north of Germany, and whom I believe he
had never seen, would have been his heir at law. In the next de∣gree
he had several cousins; and one of these, an old companion, by
name Mr. de Montagny, he has chosen for his heir. As this house
and garden was the best and clearest part of poor Deyverdun's
fortune; as there is a heavy duty or fine (what they call <HI>lods</HI>) on
every change of property out of the legal descent; as Montagny has
a small estate and a large family, it was necessary to make some pro∣vision
in his favour. The will therefore leaves me the option of en∣joying
this place during my life, on paying the sum of 250l. (I
reckon in English money) at present, and an annual rent of 30l.; or
else, of purchasing the house and garden for a sum which, including
the duty, will amount to 2500l. If I value the rent of 30l. at
twelve years purchase, I may acquire my enjoyment for life at about
the rate of 600l.; and the remaining 1900l. will be the difference
between that tenure and absolute perpetual property. As you have
never accused me of too much zeal for the interest of posterity, you
will easily guess which scale at first preponderated. I deeply felt the
advantage of acquiring, for the smaller sum, every possible enjoy∣ment,
<PB N="198" REF="222"/>
as long as I myself should be capable of enjoying: I rejected,
with scorn, the idea of giving 1900l. for ideal posthumous property;
and I deemed it of little moment whose name, after my death,
should be inscribed on my house and garden at Lausanne. How
often did I repeat to myself the philosophical lines of Pope, which
seem to determine the question:</P>
<LG>
<L>Pray Heaven, cries Swift, it last as you go on;</L>
<L>I wish to God this house had been your own.</L>
<L>Pity to build without or son or wife:</L>
<L>Why, you'll enjoy it <HI>only</HI> all your life.</L>
<L>Well, if the use be mine, does it concern one,</L>
<L>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</L>
</LG>
<P>In this state of self-satisfaction I was not much disturbed by all my
real or nominal friends, who exhort me to prefer the right of pur∣chase:
among such friends, some are careless and some are ignorant;
and the judgment of those, who are able and willing to form an opi∣nion,
is often biassed by some selfish or social affection, by some
visible or invisible interest. But my own reflections have gradually
and forcibly driven me from my first propensity; and these reflec∣tions
I will now proceed to enumerate:</P>
<P>1. I can make this purchase with ease and prudence. As I have
had the pleasure of <HI>not</HI> hearing from you very lately, I flatter myself
that you advance on a carpet road, and that almost by the receipt of
this letter (July 31st) the acres of Beriton will be transmuted into
sixteen thousand pounds: if the payment be not absolutely com∣pleted
by that day, * * * * * will not scruple, I suppose, depositing the
2600l. at Gosling's, to meet my draught. Should he hesitate, I can
desire Darrel to sell <HI>quantum sufficit</HI> of my short annuities. As soon
as the new settlement of my affairs is made, I shall be able, after
deducting this sum, to square my expence to my income, &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. On mature consideration, I am perhaps less selfish and less phi∣losophical
than I appear at first sight: indeed, were I not so, it
<PB N="199" REF="223"/>
would now be in my power to turn my fortune into life-annuities,
and let the Devil take the hindmost. I feel, (perhaps it is foolish,)
but I feel that this little paradise will please me still more when it is
absolutely my own; and that I shall be encouraged in every im∣provement
of use or beauty, by the prospect that, after my departure,
it will be enjoyed by some person of my own choice. I sometimes
reflect with pleasure that my writings will survive me; and that idea
is at least as vain and chimerical.</P>
<P>3. The heir, Mr. de Montagny, is an old acquaintance. My situa∣tion
of a life-holder is rather new and singular in this country: the
laws have not provided for many nice cases which may arise between
the landlord and tenant: some I can foresee, others have been sug∣gested,
many more I might feel when it would be too late. His
right of property might plague and confine me; he might forbid my
lending to a friend, inspect my conduct, check my improvements,
call for securities, repairs, &amp;c. But if I purchase, I walk on my
own terrace fierce and erect, the free master of one of the most deli∣cious
spots on the globe.</P>
<P>Should I ever migrate homewards, (you stare, but such an event
is less improbable than I could have thought it two years ago,) this
place would be disputed by strangers and natives.</P>
<P>Weigh these reasons, and send me without delay a rational ex∣plicit
opinion, to which I shall pay such regard as the nature of cir∣cumstances
will allow. But, alas! when all is determined, I shall
possess this house, by whatsoever tenure, without friendship or do∣mestic
society. I did not imagine, six years ago, that a plan of life
so congenial to my wishes, would so speedily vanish. I cannot write
upon any other subject. Adieu, your's ever.</P>

<P>AFTER receiving and dispatching the power of attorny, last Wed∣nesday,
I opened, with some palpitation, the unexpected missive
<PB N="200" REF="224"/>
which arrived this morning. The perusal of the contents spoiled
my breakfast. They are disagreeable in themselves, alarming in
their consequences, and peculiarly unpleasant at the present moment,
when I hoped to have formed and secured the arrangements of my
future life. I do not perfectly understand what are these deeds
which are so inflexibly required; the wills and marriage-settlements
I have sufficiently answered. But your arguments do not convince
* * * * *, and I have very little hope from the Lenborough search.
What will be the event? If his objections are only the result of
legal scrupulosity, surely they might be removed, and every chink
might be filled, by a general bond of indemnity, in which I boldly
ask you to join, as it will be a substantial important act of friend∣ship,
without any possible risk to yourself or your successors. Should
he still remain obdurate, I must believe what I already suspect, that
* * * repents of his purchase, and wishes to elude the conclusion.
Our case would be then hopeless, <HI>ibi omnis effusus labor,</HI> and the
estate would be returned on our hands with the taint of a bad title.
The refusal of mortgage does not please me; but surely our offer
shews some confidence in the goodness of my title. If he will not
take eight thousand pounds at <HI>four per cent.</HI> we must look out else∣where;
new doubts and delays will arise, and I am persuaded that
you will not place an implicit confidence in any attorney. I know
not as yet your opinion about my Lausanne purchase. If you are
against it, the present position of affairs gives you great advantage,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The Severys are all well; an uncommon circumstance for
the four persons of the family at once. They are now at Mex, a
country-house six miles from hence, which I visit to-morrow for
two or three days. They often come to town, and we shall contrive
to pass a part of the autumn together at Rolle. I want to change
the scene; and beautiful as the garden and prospect must appear to
every eye, I feel that the state of my own mind casts a gloom over
them; every spot, every walk, every bench, recals the memory of
<PB N="201" REF="225"/>
those hours, of those conversations, which will return no more. But
I tear myself from the subject. I could not help writing to-day,
though I do not find I have said any thing very material. As you
must be conscious that you have agitated me, you will not postpone
any agreeable, or even <HI>decisive</HI> intelligence. I almost hesitate, whe∣ther
I shall run over to England, to consult with you on the spot,
and to fly from poor Deyverdun's shade, which meets me at every
turn. I did not expect to have felt his loss so sharply. But six hun∣dred
miles! Why are we so far off?</P>
<P>Once more, What is the difficulty of the title? Will men of
sense, in a sensible country, never get rid of the tyranny of lawyers?
more oppressive and ridiculous than even the old yoke of the clergy.
Is not a term of seventy or eighty years, nearly twenty in my own
person, sufficient to prove our legal possession? Will not the records
of fines and recoveries attest that <HI>I</HI> am free from any bar of entails
and settlements? Consult some sage of the law, whether their pre∣sent
demand be necessary and legal. If your ground be firm, force
them to execute the agreement or forfeit the deposit. But if, as I
much fear, they have a right, and a wish, to elude the consummation,
would it not be better to release them at once, than to be hung up
for five years, as in the case of Lovegrove, which cost me in the
end four or five thousand pounds? You are bold, you are wise;
consult, resolve, act. In my penultimate letter I dropped a strange
hint, that a migration homeward was not impossible. I know not
what to say; my mind is all afloat; yet you will not reproach me with
caprice or inconstancy. How many years did you damn my scheme
of retiring to Lausanne! I executed that plan; I found as much
happiness as is compatible with human nature, and during four
years (1783—1787) I never breathed a sigh of repentance. On
my return from England the scene was changed: I found only a
faint semblance of Deyverdun, and that semblance was each day
fading from my sight. I have passed an anxious year, but my
<PB N="202" REF="226"/>
anxiety is now at an end, and the prospect before me is a melan∣choly
solitude. I am still deeply rooted in this country; the pos∣session
of this paradise, the friendship of the Severys, a mode of
society suited to my taste, and the enormous trouble and <HI>expence</HI> of
a migration. Yet in England (when the present clouds are dispelled)
I could form a very comfortable establishment in London, or rather
at Bath; and I have a very noble country-seat at about ten miles
from East Grinstead in Sussex<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to Sheffield-Place.</NOTE>. That spot is dearer to me than the
rest of the three kingdoms; and I have sometimes wondered how
two men, so opposite in their tempers and pursuits, should have im∣bibed
so long and lively a propensity for each other. Sir Stanier
Porten is just dead. He has left his widow with a moderate pension,
and two children, my nearest relations: the eldest, Charlotte, is
about Louisa's age, and also a most amiable sensible young creature.
I have conceived a romantic idea of educating and adopting her;
as we descend into the vale of years our infirmities require some do∣mestic
female society: Charlotte would be the comfort of my age,
and I could reward her care and tenderness with a decent fortune.
A thousand difficulties oppose the execution of the plan, which I
have never opened but to you; yet it would be less impracticable
in England than in Switzerland. Adieu. I am wounded; pour
some oil into my wounds: yet I am less unhappy since I have
thrown my mind upon paper.</P>
<P>Are you not amazed at the French revolution? They have the
power, will they have the moderation, to establish a good consti∣tution?
Adieu, ever yours.</P>

<P>WITHIN an hour after the reception of your last, I drew my
pen for the purpose of a reply, and my exordium ran in the following
words: <Q>I find by experience, that it is much more rational, as well
<PB N="203" REF="227"/>
as easy, to answer a letter of real business by the return of the
post.</Q> This important truth is again verified by my own ex∣ample.
After writing three pages I was called away by a very ra∣tional
motive, and the post departed before I could return to the
conclusion. A second delay was coloured by some decent pretence▪
Three weeks have slipped away, and I now force myself on a task,
which I should have dispatched without an effort on the first sum∣mons.
My only excuse is, that I had little to write about English
business, and that I could write nothing definitive about my Swiss
affairs. And first, as Aristotle says of the first,</P>
<P>1. I was indeed in low spirits when I sent what you so justly stile
my dismal letter; but I do assure you, that my own feelings con∣tributed
much more to sink me, than any events or terrors relative to
the sale of Beriton. But I again hope and trust, from your conso∣latory
epistle, that, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. My Swiss transaction has suffered a great alteration. I shall
not become the proprietor of my house and garden at Lausanne, and
I relinquish the phantom with more regret than you could easily
imagine. But I have been determined by a difficulty, which at first
appeared of little moment, but which has gradually swelled to an
alarming magnitude. There is a law in this country, as well as in
some provinces of France, which is styled <HI>le droit de retrait, le retrait
lignagere,</HI> (Lord Loughborough must have heard of it,) by which
the relations of the deceased are entitled to redeem a house or estate
at the price for which it has been sold; and as the sum fixed by
poor Deyverdun is much below its known value, a crowd of compe∣titors
are beginning to start. The best opinions (for they are di∣vided)
are in my favour, that I am not subject to <HI>le droit de retrait,</HI>
since I take not as a purchaser, but as a legatee. But the words of
the will are somewhat ambiguous, the event of law is always uncer∣tain,
the administration of justice at Bern (the last appeal) depends
too much on favour and intrigue; and it is very doubtful whether I
could revert to the life-holding, after having chosen and lost the
<PB N="204" REF="228"/>
property. These considerations engaged me to open a negociation
with Mr. de Montagny, through the medium of my friend the judge;
and as he most ardently wishes to keep the house, he consented,
though with some reluctance, to my proposals. Yesterday he signed
a covenant in the most regular and binding form, by which he
allows my power of transferring my interest, interprets in the most
ample sense my right of making alterations, and expressly renounces
all claim, as landlord, of visiting or inspecting the premises. I have
promised to lend him twelve thousand livres, (between seven and
eight hundred pounds,) secured on the house and land. The mort∣gage
is four times its value; the interest of four pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> will
be annually discharged by the rent of thirty guineas. So that I am
now tranquil on that score for the remainder of my days. I hope
that time will gradually reconcile me to the place which I have in∣habited
with my poor friend; for in spite of the <HI>cream</HI> of London,
I am still persuaded that no other place is so well adapted to my taste
and habits of studious and social life.</P>
<P>Far from delighting in the whirl of a metropolis, my only com∣plaint
against Lausanne is the great number of strangers, always of
English, and now of French, by whom we are infested in summer.
Yet we have escaped the <HI>damned</HI> great ones, the Count d'Artois, the
Polignacs, &amp;c. who slip by us to Turin. What a scene is France!
While the assembly is voting abstract propositions, Paris is an inde∣pendent
republic; the provinces have neither authority nor freedom,
and poor Necker declares that credit is no more, and that the people
refuse to pay taxes. Yet I think you must be seduced by the abo∣lition
of tithes. If Eden goes to Paris you may have some curious
information. Give me some account of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas. Do
they live with Lord North? I hope they do. When will parlia∣ment
be dissolved? Are you still Coventry-mad? I embrace my
Lady, the sprightly Maria, and the smiling Louisa. Alas! alas!
you will never come to Switzerland. Adieu, ever yours.</P>

<LG>
<L>Alas! what perils do environ</L>
<L>The man who meddles with cold iron.</L>
</LG>
<P>ALAS! what delays and difficulties do attend the man who meddles
with legal and landed business! Yet if it be only to disappoint your
expectation, I am not so very nervous at this new provoking ob∣stacle.
I had totally forgotten the deed in question, which was con∣trived
in the last year of my father's life, to tie his hands and regu∣late
the disorder of his affairs; and which might have been so easily
cancelled by Sir Stanier, who had not the smallest interest in it,
either for himself or his family. The amicable suit, which is now
become necessary, must, I think, be short and unambiguous, yet I
cannot help dreading the crotchets, that lurk under the chancellor's
great wig; and, at all events, I foresee some additional delay and
expence. The golden pill of the two thousand eight hundred pounds
has soothed my discontent; and if it be safely lodged with the Gos∣lings,
I agree with you, in considering it as an unequivocal pledge of
a fair and willing purchaser. It is indeed chiefly in that light I now
rejoice in so large a deposit, which is no longer necessary in its full
extent. You are apprised by my last letter that I have reduced
myself to the life-enjoyment of the house and garden. And, in
spite of my feelings, I am every day more convinced that I have
chosen the safer side. I believe my cause to have been good, but
it was doubtful. Law in this country is not so expensive as in
England, but it is more troublesome; I must have gone to Bern,
have solicited my judges in person; a vile custom! the event was
uncertain; and during at least two years, I should have been in a
state of suspense and anxiety; till the conclusion of which it would
have been madness to have attempted any alteration or improvement.
According to my present arrangement I shall want no more than
eleven hundred pounds of the two thousand, and I suppose you will
<PB N="206" REF="230"/>
direct Gosling to lay out the remainder in India bonds, that it may
not lie quite dead, while I am accountable to * * * * for the in∣terest.
The elderly lady in a male habit, who informed me that
Yorkshire is a register county, is a certain judge, one Sir William
Blackstone, whose name you may possibly have heard. After stating
the danger of purchasers and creditors, with regard to the title of
estates on which they lay out or lend their money, he thus con∣tinues:
<Q>In Scotland every act and event regarding the transmission
of property is regularly entered on record; and some of our own
provincial divisions, particularly the extended county of York
and the populous county of Middlesex, have prevailed with the
legislature to erect such registers in their respective districts.</Q>
(Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. ii. p. 343, edition of 1774, in
quarto.) If I am mistaken, it is in pretty good company; but I
suspect that we are all right, and that the register is confined to one
or two ridings. As we have, alas! two or three months before us, I
should hope that your prudent sagacity will discover some sound
land, in case you should not have time to arrange another mortgage.
I now write in a hurry, as I am just setting out for Rolle, where I
shall be settled with cook and servants in a pleasant apartment, till
the middle of November. The Severys have a house there, where
they pass the autumn. I am not sorry to vary the scene for a few
weeks, and I wish to be absent while some alterations are making in
my house at Lausanne. I wish the change of air may be of service to
Severy the father, but we do not at all like his present state of health.
How completely, alas, how completely! could I now lodge you:
but your firm resolve of making me a visit seems to have vanished
like a dream. Next summer you will not find five hundred pounds
for a rational friendly expedition; and should parliament be dis∣solved,
you will perhaps find five thousand for—. I cannot
think of it with patience. Pray take serious strenuous measures for
sending me a pipe of excellent Madeira in cask, with some dozens
<PB N="207" REF="231"/>
of Malmsey Madeira. It should be consigned to Messrs. Romberg
Voituriers at Ostend, and I must have timely notice of its march.
We have so much to say about France, that I suppose we shall never
say any thing. That country is now in a state of dissolution. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOU have often reason to accuse my strange silence and neglect in
the most important of <HI>my own</HI> affairs; for I will presume to assert,
that in a business of yours of equal consequence, you should not
find me cold or careless. But on the present occasion my silence is,
perhaps, the highest compliment I ever paid you. You remember
the answer of Philip of Macedon: <Q>Philip may sleep, while he
knows that Parmenio is awake.</Q> I expected, and, to say the
truth, I wished that my Parmenio would have decided and acted,
without expecting my dilatory answer, and in his decision I should
have acquiesced with implicit confidence. But since you will have
my opinion, let us consider the present state of my affairs. In the
course of my life I have often known, and sometimes felt, the dif∣ficulty
of getting money, but I now find myself involved in a more
singular distress, the difficulty of placing it, and if it continues much
longer, I shall almost wish for my land again.</P>
<P>I perfectly agree with you, that it is bad management to purchase
in the funds when they do not yield four pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> *
* * * * * * * * * * * *.
Some of this money I can place safely, by means of my banker
here; and I shall possess, what I have always desired, a command of
cash, which I cannot abuse to my prejudice, since I have it in my
power to supply with my pen any extraordinary or fanciful in∣dulgence
of expence. And so much, much indeed, for pecuniary
matters. What would you have me say of the affairs of France?
We are too near, and too remote, to form an accurate judgment of
that wonderful scene. The abuses of the court and government
<PB N="208" REF="232"/>
called aloud for reformation; and it has happened, as it will always
happen, tha an innocent well-disposed Prince has paid the forfeit of
the sins of his predecessors; of the ambition of Lewis the Fourteenth,
of the profusion of Lewis the Fifteenth. The French nation had a
glorious opportunity, but they have abused, and may lose their ad∣vantages.
If they had been content with a liberal translation of our
system, if they had respected the prerogatives of the crown, and the
privileges of the nobles, they might have raised a solid fabric on the
only true foundation, the natural aristocracy of a great country.
How different is the prospect! Their King brought a captive to
Paris, after his palace had been stained with the blood of his guards;
the nobles in exile; the clergy plundered in a way which strikes at
the root of all property; the capital an independent republic; the
union of the provinces dissolved; the flames of discord kindled by
the worst of men; (in that light I consider Mirabeau;) and the
honestest of the assembly, a set of wild visionaries, (like our Dr.
Price,) who gravely debate, and dream about the establishment of
a pure and perfect democracy of five-and-twenty millions, the vir∣tues
of the golden age, and the primitive rights and equality of
mankind, which would lead, in fair reasoning, to an equal partition
of lands and money. How many years must elapse before France
can recover any vigour, or resume her station among the Powers of
Europe! As yet, there is no symptom of a great man, a Richlieu
or a Cromwell, arising, either to restore the monarchy, or to lead the
commonwealth. The weight of Paris, more deeply engaged in the
funds than <HI>all</HI> the rest of the kingdom, will long delay a bank∣ruptcy;
and if it should happen, it will be, both in the cause and
the effect, a measure of weakness, rather than of strength. You
send me to Chamberry, to see a Prince and an Archbishop. Alas!
we have exiles enough here, with the Marshal de Castries and the
Duke de Guignes at their head; and this inundation of strangers,
which used to be confined to the summer, will now stagnate all the
<PB N="209" REF="233"/>
winter. The only ones whom I have seen with pleasure are
Mr. Mounier, the late president of the national assembly, and the
Count de Lally; they have both dined with me. Mounier, who is
a serious dry politician, is returned to Dauphine. Lally is an ami∣able
man of the world, and a poet: he passes the winter here. You
know how much I prefer a quiet select society to a crowd of
names and titles, and that I always seek conversation with a view
to amusement, rather than information. What happy countries
are England and Switzerland, if they know and preserve their
happiness.</P>
<P>I have a thousand things to say to my Lady, Maria, and Louisa,
but I can add only a short postscript about the Madeira. Good Ma∣deira
is now become essential to my health and reputation. May
your hogshead prove as good as the last; may it not be intercepted
by the rebels or the Austrians. What a scene again in that country!
Happy England! Happy Switzerland! I again repeat, adieu.</P>

the last this morning (the 27th); so that I answer by the first, or
at least by the second post. Upon the whole, your French method,
though sometimes more rapid, appears to me less sure and steady
than the old German highway, &amp;c. &amp;c. * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *
But enough of this. A new and brighter prospect seems to be break∣ing
upon us, and few events of <HI>that kind</HI> have ever given me more
pleasure than your successful negociation and * * * *'s satisfactory
answer. The agreement is, indeed, equally convenient for both
parties: no time or expence will be wasted in scrutinizing the title of
the estate; the interest will be secured by the clause of five <HI>per cent.</HI>
and I lament with you, that no larger sum than eight thousand
<PB N="210" REF="234"/>
pounds can be placed on Beriton, without asking (what might be
somewhat impudent) a collateral security, &amp;c. &amp;c. * * *
* * * * * * * * * * *.
But I wish you to choose and execute one or the other of these ar∣rangements
with sage discretion and absolute power. I shorten my
letter, that I may dispatch it by this post. I see the time, and I
shall rejoice to see it at the end of twenty years, when my cares will
be at an end, and our friendly pages will be no longer sullied with
the repetition of dirty land and vile money; when we may expatiate
on the politics of the world and our personal sentiments. Without
expecting your answer of business, I mean to write soon in a purer
style, and I wish to lay open to my friend the state of my mind,
which (exclusive of all worldly concerns) is not perfectly at ease.
In the mean while, I must add two or three short articles. 1. I am
astonished at Elmsley's silence, and the immobility of your picture,
Mine should have departed long since, could I have found a sure
opportunity, &amp;c. &amp;c. Adieu, yours.</P>

<P>SINCE the first origin (<HI>ab ovo</HI>) of our connection and correspond∣ence,
so long an interval of silence has not intervened, as far as I
remember, between us, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>From my silence you conclude that the moral complaint, which I
had insinuated in my last, is either insignificant or fanciful. The con∣clusion
is rash. But the complaint in question is of the nature of a slow
lingering disease, which is not attended with any immediate danger.
As I have not leisure to expatiate, take the idea in three words: <Q>Since
the loss of poor Deyverdun, I am <HI>alone;</HI> and even in Paradise, so∣litude
is painful to a social mind. When I was a dozen years
younger, I <HI>scarcely</HI> felt the weight of a single existence amidst the
crowds of London, of parliament, of clubs; but it will press more
<PB N="211" REF="235"/>
heavily upon me in this tranquil land, in the decline of life, and
with the increase of infirmities. Some expedient, even the most
desperate, must be embraced, to secure the domestic society of a
male or female companion. But I am not in a hurry; there is
time for reflection and advice.</Q> During this winter such siner
feelings have been suspended by the grosser evil of bodily pain. On
the ninth of February I was seized by such a fit of the gout as I had
never known, though I must be thankful that its dire effects have
been confined to the feet and knees, without ascending to the more
noble parts. With some vicissitudes of better and worse, I have
groaned between two and three months; the debility has survived
the pain, and though now easy, I am carried about in my chair,
without any power, and with a very distant chance, of supporting
myself, from the extreme weakness and contraction of the joints of
my knees. Yet I am happy in a skilful physician, and kind assidu∣ous
friends: every evening, during more than three months, has
been enlivened (excepting when I have been forced to refuse them) by
some cheerful visits, and very often by a chosen party of both sexes.
How different is such society from the solitary evenings which I
have passed in the tumult of London! It is not worth while fighting
about a shadow, but should I ever return to England, Bath, not the
metropolis, would be my last retreat.</P>
<P>Your portrait is at last arrived in perfect condition, and now oc∣cupies
a conspicuous place over the chimney-glass in my library. It
is the object of general admiration; good judges (the few) applaud
the work; the name of Reynolds opens the eyes and mouths of the
many; and were not I afraid of making you vain, I would inform
you that the original is not allowed to be more than five-and-thirty.
In spite of private reluctance and public discontent, I have honour∣ably
dismissed <HI>myself</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His portrait.</NOTE>. I shall arrive at Sir Joshua's before the end
of the month; he will give me a look, and perhaps a touch; and
<PB N="212" REF="236"/>
you will be indebted to the president one guinea for the carriage.
Do not be nervous, I am not rolled up; had I been so, you might
have gazed on my charms four months ago. I want some account
of yourself, of my Lady, (shall we never directly correspond?) of
Louisa, and of Maria. How has the latter since her launch sup∣ported
a quiet winter in Sussex? I so much rejoice in your divorce
from that b—Kitty Coventry, that I care not what marriage you
contract. A great city would suit your dignity, and the duties
which would kill me in the first session, would supply your activity
with a constant fund of amusement. But tread softly and surely;
the ice is deceitful, the water is deep, and you may be soused over
head and ears before you are aware. Why did not you or Elmsley
send me the African pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations on the Project for abolishing the Slave Trade, by Lord Sheffield.</NOTE> by the post? it would not have
cost much. You have such a knack of turning a nation, that I am
afraid you will triumph (perhaps by the force of argument) over
justice and humanity. But do you not expect to work at Belze∣bub's
sugar plantations in the infernal regions, under the tender go∣vernment
of a negro-driver? I should suppose both my Lady and
Miss Firth very angry with you.</P>
<P>As to the bill for prints, which has been too long neglected,
why will you not exercise the power, which I have never revoked,
over all my cash at the Goslings? The Severy family has passed a
very favourable winter; the young man is impatient to hear from a
family which he places above all others: yet he will generously write
next week, and send you a drawing of the alterations in the house.
Do not raise your ideas; you know <HI>I</HI> am satisfied with convenience
in architecture, and some elegance in furniture. I admire the cool∣ness
with which you ask me to epistolize Reynell and Elmsley, as if
a letter were so easy and pleasant a task; it appears less so to me
every day.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="237"/>
1790.</P>
<P>YOUR indignation will melt into pity, when you hear that for
several weeks past I have been again confined to my chamber and my
chair. Yet I must hasten, generously hasten, to exculpate the gout,
my old enemy, from the curses which you already pour on his head.
He is not the cause of this disorder, although the consequences have
been somewhat similar. I am satisfied that this effort of nature has
saved me from a very dangerous, perhaps a fatal, crisis; and I listen
to the flattering hope that it may tend to keep the gout at a more
respectful distance, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The whole sheet has been filled with dry selfish business; but I
must and will reserve some lines of the cover for a little friendly con∣versation.
I passed four days at the castle of Copet with Necker; and
could have wished to have shewn him, as a warning to any aspiring
youth possessed with the daemon of ambition. With all the means
of private happiness in his power, he is the most miserable of human
beings: the past, the present, and the future are equally odious to
him. When I suggested some domestic amusements of books, build∣ing,
&amp;c. he answered, with a deep tone of despair, <Q>Dans l'êtat ou
je suis, je ne puis sentir que le coup de vent qui m'a abbatû.</Q>
How different from the careless cheerfulness with which our poor
friend Lord North supported his fall! Madame Necker maintains
more external composure, <HI>mais le Diable n'y perd rien.</HI> It is true
that Necker wished to be carried into the closet, like old Pitt, on the
shoulders of the people; and that he has been ruined by the demo∣cracy
which he had raised. I believe him to be an able financier, and
know him to be an honest man; too honest, perhaps, for a minister.
His rival Calonne has passed through Lausanne, in his way from
Turin; and was soon followed by the Prince of Condé, with his son
and grandson; but I was too much indisposed to see them. They
have, or have had, some wild projects of a counter-revolution:
horses have been bought, men levied: such foolish attempts must
<PB N="214" REF="238"/>
end in the ruin of the party. Burke's book is a most admirable me∣dicine
against the French disease, which has made too much progress
even in this happy country. I admire his eloquence, I approve his
politics, I adore his chivalry, and I can forgive even his superstition.
The primitive church, which I have treated with some freedom, was
itself at that time an innovation, and I was attached to the old Pagan
establishment. The French spread so many lies about the sentiments
of the English nation, that I wish the most considerable men of all
parties and descriptions would join in some public act, declaring
themselves satisfied and resolved to support our present constitution.
Such a declaration would have a wonderful effect in Europe; and,
were I thought worthy, I myself would be proud to subscribe it.
I have a great mind to send you something of a sketch, such as all
thinking men might adopt.</P>
<P>I have intelligence of the approach of my Madeira. I accept with
equal pleasure the second pipe, now in the Torrid Zone. Send me
some pleasant details of your domestic state, of Maria, &amp;c. If my
Lady thinks that my silence is a mark of indifference, my Lady is a
goose. I <HI>must</HI> have you all at Lausanne next summer.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>August 7, 1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ANSWER at once your two letters; and I should probably have
taken earlier notice of the first, had I not been in daily expectation
of the second. I must begin on the subject of what really interests
me the most, your glorious election for Bristol. Most sincerely do I
congratulate your exchange of a cursed expensive jilt, who deserted
you for a rich Jew, for an honourable connection with a chaste and
virtuous matron, who will probably be as constant as she is disin∣terested.
In the whole range of election from Caithness to St. Ives,
I much doubt whether there be a single choice so truly honourable
to the member and the constituents. The second commercial city
invites, from a distant province, an independent gentleman, known
<PB N="215" REF="239"/>
only by his active spirit, and his writings on the subject of trade;
and names him, without intrigue or expence, for her representative:
even the voice of party is silenced, while factions strive which shall
applaud the most.</P>
<P>You are now sure, for seven years to come, of never wanting food;
I mean business: what a crowd of suitors or complainants will be∣siege
your door! what a load of letters and memorials will be heaped
on your table! I much question whether even you will not some∣times
exclaim, <HI>Ohe! jam satis est!</HI> but that is your affair. Of the
excursion to Coventry I cannot decide, but I hear it is pretty gene∣rally
blamed: but, however, I love gratitude to an old friend; and
shall not be very angry if you damned them with a farewel to all
eternity. But I cannot repress my indignation at the use of those
foolish, obsolete, odious words, Whig and Tory. In the American
war they might have some meaning; and then your Lordship was a
Tory, although you supposed yourself a Whig: since the coalition,
all general principles have been confounded; and if there ever was
an opposition to men, not measures, it is the present. Luckily both
the leaders are great men; and, whatever happens, the country must
fall upon its legs. What a strange mist of peace and war seems to
hang over the ocean! We can perceive nothing but secrecy and
vigor; but those are excellent qualities to perceive in a minister.
From yourself and politics I now return to my private concerns,
which I shall methodically consider under the three great articles of
mind, body, and estate.</P>
<P>1. I am not absolutely displeased at your firing so hastily at the
hint, a tremendous hint, in my last letter. But the danger is not so
serious or imminent as you seem to suspect; and I give you my
word, that, before I take the slightest step which can bind me either
in law, conscience, or honour, I will faithfully communicate, and
we will freely discuss, the whole state of the business. But at pre∣sent
there is not any thing to communicate or discuss; I do assure you
<PB N="216" REF="240"/>
that I have not any particular object in view: I am not in love with
any of the hyaenas of Lausanne, though there are some who keep
their claws tolerably well pared. Sometimes, in a solitary mood, I
have fancied myself married to one or another of those whose society
and conversation are the most pleasing to me; but when I have
painted in my fancy all the probable consequences of such an union,
I have started from my dream, rejoiced in my escape, and ejaculated
a thanksgiving that I was still in possession of my natural freedom.
Yet I feel, and shall continue to feel, that domestic solitude, how∣ever
it may be alleviated by the world, by study, and even by friend∣ship,
is a comfortless state, which will grow more painful as I de∣scend
in the vale of years. At present my situation is very tolerable;
and if at dinner-time, or at my return home in the evening, I some∣times
sigh for a companion, there are many hours, and many occa∣sions,
in which I enjoy the superior blessing of being sole master of
my own house. But your plan, though less dangerous, is still more
absurd than mine: such a couple as you describe could not be found;
and, if found, would not answer my purpose; their rank and position
would be awkward and ambiguous to myself and my acquaintance;
and the agreement of three persons of three characters would be still
more impracticable. My plan of Charlotte Porten is undoubtedly the
most desirable; and she might either remain a spinster (the case is not
without example), or marry some Swiss of my choice, who would
increase and enliven our society; and both would have the strongest
motives for kind and dutiful behaviour. But the mother has been
indirectly sounded, and will not hear of such a proposal for some
years. On my side, I would not take her, but as a piece of soft
wax which I could model to the language and manners of the
country: I must therefore be patient.</P>
<P>Young Severy's letter, which may be now in your hands, and
which, for these three or four last posts, has furnished my indolence
with a new pretence for delay, has already informed you of the
<PB N="217" REF="241"/>
means and circumstances of my resurrection. Tedious indeed was
my confinement, since I was not able to move from my house or
chair, from the ninth of February to the first of July, very nearly five
months. The first weeks were accompanied with more pain than I
have ever known in the gout, with anxious days and sleepless nights;
and when that pain subsided, it left a weakness in my knees which
seemed to have no end. My confinement was however softened by
books, by the possession of every comfort and convenience, by a suc∣cession
each evening of agreeable company, and by a flow of equal
spirits and general good health. During the last weeks I descended
to the ground floor, poor Deyverdun's apartment, and constructed a
chair like Merlin's, in which I could wheel myself in the house and
on the terrace. My patience has been universally admired; yet how
many thousands have passed those five months less easily than my∣self.
I remember making a remark perfectly simple, and perfectly
true: <Q>At present, (I said to Madame de Severy,) I am not posi∣tively
miserable, and I may reasonably hope a daily or weekly im∣provement,
till sooner or later in the summer I shall recover new
limbs, and new pleasures, which I do not now possess: have any
of you such a prospect?</Q> The prediction has been accomplished,
and I have arrived to my present condition of strength, or rather of
feebleness: I now can walk with tolerable ease in my garden and
smooth places; but on the rough pavement of the town I use, and
perhaps shall use, a sedan chair. The Pyrmont waters have per∣formed
wonders; and my physician (not Tissot, but a very sensible
man) allows me to hope, that the term of the interval will be in
proportion to that of the fit.</P>
<P>Have you read in the English papers, that the government of
Berne is overturned, and that we are divided into three democratical
leagues? true as what I have read in the French papers, that the
English have cut off Pitt's head, and abolished the House of Lords.
The people of this country are happy; and in spite of some mis∣creants,
<PB N="218" REF="242"/>
and more foreign emissaries, they are sensible of their hap∣piness.</P>
<P>Finally—Inform my Lady, that I am indignant at a false and here∣tical
assertion in her last letter to Severy, <Q>that friends at a distance
cannot love each other, if they do not write.</Q> I love her better
than any woman in the world; indeed I do; and yet I do not write.
And she herself—but I am calm. We have now nearly one hundred
French exiles, some of them worth being acquainted with; par∣ticularly
a Count de Schomberg, who is become almost my friend;
he is a man of the world, of letters, and of sufficient age, since in
1753 he succeeded to Marshal Saxe's regiment of dragoons. As to
the rest, I entertain them, and they flatter me: but I wish we were
reduced to our Lausanne society. Poor France! the state is dissolved,
the nation is mad! Adieu.</P>

<P>FIRST, of my health: it is now tolerably restored, my legs are still
weak, but the animal in general is in a sound and lively condition; and
we have great hopes from the fine weather and the Pyrmont waters.
I most sincerely wished for the presence of Maria, to embellish a ball
which I gave the 29th of last month to all the best company, natives
and foreigners, of Lausanne, with the aid of the Severys, especially of
the mother and son, who directed the oeconomy, and performed the ho∣nours
of the <HI>fête.</HI> It opened about seven in the evening; the assembly
of men and women was pleased and pleasing, the music good, the illu∣mination
splendid, the refreshments profuse: at twelve, one hundred
and thirty persons sat down to a very good supper: at two, I stole away
to bed, in a snug corner; and I was informed at breakfast, that the
remains of the veteran and young troops, with Severy and his sister
at their head, had concluded the last dance about a quarter before
seven. This magnificent entertainment has gained me great credit;
and the expence was more reasonable than you can easily imagine.
<PB N="219" REF="243"/>
This was an extraordinary event, but I give frequent dinners; and
in the summer I have an assembly every Sunday evening. What a
wicked wretch! says my Lady.</P>
<P>I cannot pity you for the accumulation of business, as you ought not
to pity <HI>me,</HI> if I complained of the tranquillity of Lausanne; we suffer or
enjoy the effects of our own choice. Perhaps you will mutter some∣thing,
of our not being born for ourselves, of public spirit (I have for∣merly
read of such a thing), of private friendship, for which I give you
full and ample credit, &amp;c. But your parliamentary operations, at
least, will probably expire in the month of June; and I shall refuse to
sign the Newhaven conveyance, unless I am satisfied that you will
execute the Lausanne visit this summer. On the 15th of June, sup∣pose
Lord, Lady, Maria, and maid, (poor Louisa!) in a post coach,
with Elienne on horseback, set out from Downing-Street, or Sheffield-Place,
cross the channel from Brighton to Dieppe, visit the National
Assembly, buy caps at Paris, examine the ruins of Versailles, and arrive
at Lausanne, without danger or fatigue, the second week in July; you
will be lodged pleasantly and comfortably, and will not perhaps
despise my situation. A couple of months will roll, alas! too hastily
away: you will all be amused by new scenes, new people; and
whenever Maria and you, with Severy, mount on horseback to visit
the country, the glaciers, &amp;c. my Lady and myself shall form a very
quiet tête-à-tête at home. In September, if you are tired, you may
return by a direct or indirect way; but I only desire that you will not
make the plan impracticable, by grasping at too much. In return, I
promise you a visit of three or four months in the autumn of ninety-two:
you and my booksellers are now my principal attractions in
England. You had some right to growl at hearing of my supple∣ment
in the papers: but Cadell's indiscretion was founded on a hint
which I had thrown out in a letter, and which in all probability will
never be executed. Yet I am not totally idle. Adieu.</P>

<P>I WRITE a short letter, on small paper, to inform you, that the va∣rious
deeds, which arrived safe and in good condition, have this
morning been sealed, signed, and delivered, in the presence of re∣spectable
and well-known English witnesses. To have read the afore∣said
acts, would have been difficult; to have understood them, im∣practicable.
I therefore signed them with my eyes shut, and in that
implicit confidence, which we freemen and Britons are humbly con∣tent
to yield to our lawyers and ministers. I hope however, most
seriously hope, that every thing has been carefully examined, and
that I am not totally ruined. It is not without much impatience
that I expect an account of the payment and investment of the
purchase-money. It was my intention to have added a new edition
of my will; but I hve an unexpected call to go to Geneva to-morrow
with the Severys, and must defer that business a few days
till after my return. On my return I may possibly find a letter from
you, and will write more fully in answer: my posthumous work,
contained in a single sheet, will not ruin you in postage. In the
mean while let me desire you either never to talk of Lausanne, or to
execute the journey this summer; after the dispatch of public and

do not go to war with Russia; it is very foolish. I am quite angry

<P>AT length I see a ray of sunshine breaking from a dark cloud.
Your epistle of the 13th arrived this morning, the 25th instant, the
day after my return from Geneva; it has been communicated to
Severy. We now believe that you intend a visit to Lausanne this
summer, and we hope that you will execute that intention. If you
are a man of honour, you shall find me one; and, on the day of
<PB N="221" REF="245"/>
your arrival at Lausanne, I will ratify my engagement of visiting the
British isle before the end of the year 1792, excepting only the fair
and foul exception of the gout. You rejoice me, by proposing the
addition of dear Louisa; it was not without a bitter pang that I
threw her overboard, to lighten the vessel and secure the voyage: I
was fearful of the governess, a second carriage, and a long train of
difficulty and expence, which might have ended in blowing up the
whole scheme. But if you can bodkin the sweet creature into the
coach, she will find an easy welcome at Lausanne. The first arrange∣ments
which I must make before your arrival, may be altered by
your own taste, on a survey of the premises, and you will all be com∣modiously
and pleasantly lodged. You have heard a great deal of
the beauty of my house, garden, and situation; but such are their
intrinsic value, that, unless I am much deceived, they will bear the
test even of exaggerated praise. From my knowledge of your Lord∣ship,
I have always entertained some doubt how you would get
through the society of a Lausanne winter: but I am satisfied that,
exclusive of friendship, your summer visits to the banks of the Leman
Lake will long be remembered as one of the most agreeable periods
of your life; and that you will scarcely regret the amusement of a
Sussex Committee of Navigation in the dog days. You ask for de∣tails:
what details? a map of France and a post-book are easy and
infallible guides. If the ladies are not afraid of the ocean, you are
not ignorant of the passage from Brighton to Dieppe: Paris will then
be in your direct road; and even allowing you to look at the Pan∣daemonium,
the ruins of Versailles, &amp;c. a fortnight diligently em∣ployed
will clear you from Sheffield Place to Gibbon Castle. What
can I say more?</P>
<P>As little have I to say on the subject of my worldly matters, which
seem now, Jupiter be praised, to be drawing towards a final conclu∣sion;
since when people part with their money, they are indeed
serious. I do not perfectly understand the ratio of the precise sum
<PB N="222" REF="246"/>
which you have poured into Gosling's reservoir, but suppose it will
be explained in a general account.</P>
<P>You have been very dutiful in sending me, what I have always
desired, a cut Woodfall on a remarkable debate; a debate, indeed,
most remarkable! Poor * * * * * is the most eloquent and rational mad∣man
that I ever knew. I love * * *'s feelings, but I detest the poli∣tical
principles of the man, and of the party. Formerly, you detested
them more strongly during the American war, than myself. I am
half afraid that you are corrupted by your unfortunate connections.
Should you admire the National Assembly, we shall have many an
altercation, for I am as high an aristocrat as Burke himself; and he
has truly observed, that it is impossible to debate with temper on the
subject of that cursed revolution. In my last excursion to Geneva
I frequently saw the Neckers, who by this time are returned to their
summer residence at Copet. He is much restored in health and
spirits, especially since the publication of his last book, which has
probably reached England. Both parties, who agree in abusing him,
agree likewise that he is a man of virtue and genius; but I much fear
that the purest intentions have been productive of the most baneful
consequences. Our military men, I mean the French, are leaving
us every day for the camp of the Princes at Worms, and support
what is called representation. Their hopes are sanguine;
I will not answer for their being well grounded: it is <HI>certain,</HI> how∣ever,
that the emperor had an interview the 19th instant with the
Count of Artois at Mantua; and the aristocrats talk in mysterious
language of Spain, Sardinia, the Empire, four or five armies, &amp;c.
They will doubtless strike a blow this summer: may it not recoil on
their own heads! Adieu. Embrace our female travellers. A short
delay!</P>

<P>I NOW begin to see you all in real motion, swimming from
Brighton to Dieppe, according to my scheme, and afterwards tread∣ing
the direct road, which you cannot well avoid, to the turbulent
capital of the late kingdom of France. I know not what more to
say, or what further instructions to send; they would indeed be use∣less,
as you are travelling through a country which has been some∣times
visited by Englishmen: only this let me say, that in the midst
of anarchy the roads were never more secure than at present. As
you will wish to assist at the national assembly, you will act pru∣dently
in obtaining from the French in London a good recommend∣ation
to some leading member; Cazales, for instance, or the Abbé
Maury. I soon expect from Elmsley a cargo of books; but you
may bring me any new pamphlet of exquisite flavour, particularly
the last works of John Lord Sheffield, which the dog has always
neglected to send. You will have time to write once more, and
you must endeavour, as nearly as possible, to mark the day of your
arrival. You may come either by Lyons and Geneva, by Dijon and
les Rousses, or by Dole and Pontarliere. The post will fail you
on the edge of Switzerland, and must be supplied by hired horses.
I wish you to make your last day's journey easy, so as to dine upon

<P>IN obedience to your orders I direct a flying shot to Paris, though
I have not any thing particular to add, excepting that our impatience
is increased in the <HI>inverse ratio</HI> of time and space. Yet I almost
doubt whether you have passed the sea. The news of the King of
France's escape must have reached you before the 28th, the day of
your departure, and the prospect of strange unknown disorder may
well have suspended your firmest resolves. The royal animal is
again caught, and all may probably be quiet. I was just going to
exhort you to pass through Brussels and the confines of Germany;
a fair Irishism, since if you read this, you are already at Paris.
The only reasonable advice which now remains, is to obtain, by
means of Lord Gower, a sufficiency, or even superfluity, of forcible
passports, such as leave no room for cavil on a jealous frontier. The
frequent intercourse with Paris has proved that the best and shortest
road, instead of Besançon, is by Dijon, Dole, Les Rousses, and
Nyon. Adieu. I warmly embrace the Ladies. It would be idle
now to talk of business.</P>

<P>IT has appeared from the foregoing Letters, that a visit from
myself and my family, to Mr. Gibbon at Lausanne, had been for
some time in agitation. This long-promised excursion took place
in the month of June 1791, and occasioned a considerable cessa∣tion
of our correspondence. I landed at Dieppe immediately after
the flight from, and return to, Paris of the unfortunate Lewis XVI.
During my stay in that capital, I had an opportunity of seeing the
extraordinary ferment of men's minds, both in the national assembly,
in private societies, and in my passage through France to Lausanne,
where I recalled to my memory the interesting scenes I had wit∣nessed,
by frequent conversations with my deceased friend. I might
have wished to record his opinions on the subject of the French re∣volution,
if he had not expressed them so well in the annexed Letters.
He seemed to suppose, as some of his Letters hint, that I had a ten∣dency
to the new French opinions. Never indeed, I can with truth
aver, was suspicion more unfounded; nor could it have been ad∣mitted
into Mr. Gibbon's mind, but that his extreme friendship for
me, and his utter abhorrence of these notions, made him anxious
and jealous, even to an excess, that I should not entertain them. He
was, however, soon undeceived; he found that I was full as averse
to them as himself. I had from the first expressed an opinion, that
such a change as was aimed at in France, must derange all the regular
governments in Europe, hazard the internal quiet and dearest in∣terests
of this country, and probably end in bringing on mankind
a much greater portion of misery, than the most sanguine reformer
<PB N="226" REF="250"/>
had ever promised to himself or others to produce of benefit, by the
visionary schemes of liberty and equality, with which the ignorant
and vulgar were misled and abused.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon at first, like many others, seemed pleased with the pro∣spect
of the reform of inveterate abuses; but he very soon discovered
the mischief which was intended, the imbecility with which con∣cessions
were made, and the ruin that must arise, from the want of re∣solution
or conduct, in the administration of France. He lived to
reprobate, in the strongest terms possible, the folly of the first re∣formers,
and the something worse than extravagance and ferocity of
their successors. He saw the wild and mischievous tendency of
those pretended reformers, which, while they professed nothing but
amendment, really meant destruction to all social order; and so
strongly was his opinion fixed, as to the danger of hasty innovation,
that he became a warm and zealous advocate for every sort of old
establishment, which he marked in various ways, sometimes rather
ludicrously; and I recollect, in a circle where French affairs were
the topic, and some Portuguese present, he, seemingly with serious∣ness,
argued in favour of the inquisition at Lisbon, and said he
would not, at the present moment, give up even that old esta∣blishment.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, not be quite uninteresting to the readers of these
Memoirs, to know, that I found Mr. Gibbon at Lausanne in pos∣session
of an excellent house; the view from which, and from the
terrace, was so uncommonly beautiful, that even his own pen would
with difficulty describe the scene which it commanded. This prospect
comprehended every thing grand and magnificent, which could be
furnished by the finest mountains among the Alps, the most extensive
view of the Lake of Geneva, with a beautifully varied and cul∣tivated
country, adorned by numerous villas, and picturesque build∣ings,
intermixed with beautiful masses of stately trees. Here my
friend received us with an hospitality and kindness which I can never
<PB N="227" REF="251"/>
forget. The best apartments of the house were appropriated to our
use; the choicest society of the place was sought for, to enliven our
visit, and render every day of it cheerful and agreeable. It was
impossible for any man to be more esteemed and admired than Mr.
Gibbon was at Lausanne. The preference he had given to that
place, in adopting it for a residence, rather than his own country,
was felt and acknowledged by all the inhabitants; and he may have
been said almost to have given the law to a set of as willing subjects
as any man ever presided over. In return for the deference shewn
to him, he mixed, without any affectation, in all the society, I
mean all the best society, that Lausanne afforded; he could indeed
command it, and was, perhaps, for that reason the more partial to
it; for he often declared that he liked society more as a relaxation
from study, than as expecting to derive from it amusement or in∣struction;
that to books he looked for improvement, not to living
persons. But this I considered partly as an answer to my expressions
of wonder, that a man who might choose the most various and
most generally improved society in the world, namely, in England,
that he should prefer the very limited circle of Lausanne, which he
never deserted, but for an occasional visit to M. and Madame Necker.
It must not, however, be understood, that in chusing Lausanne for his
home, he was insensible to the merits of a residence in England:
he was not in possession of an income which corresponded with his
notions of ease and comfort in his own country. In Switzerland,
his fortune was ample. To this consideration of fortune may be
added another, which also had its weight; from early youth Mr.
Gibbon had contracted a partiality for foreign taste and foreign
habits of life, which made him less a stranger abroad than he
was, in some respects, in his native country. This arose, per∣haps,
from having been out of England from his sixteenth to
his twenty-first year; yet, when I came to Lausanne, I found
him apparently without relish for French society. During the
<PB N="228" REF="252"/>
stay I made with him he renewed his intercourse with the prin∣cipal
French who were at Lausanne; of whom there happened to
be a considerable number, distinguished for rank or talents; many
indeed respectable for both<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marshal de Castries and several branches of his family, Duc de Guignes and daughters, Duc and Duchesse de Guiche, Madame de Grammont, Princesse d'Henin, Princesse de Bouillon, Duchesse de Biron, Prince de Salms, Comte de Schomberg, M. Lally Tolendal, M. de Mounier, Madame d'Aguesseau and family, M. de Mal∣herbes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. During my stay in Switzerland I was
not absent from my friend's house, except during a short excursion
that we made together to Mr. Necker's at Copet, and a tour to Geneva,
Chamouny, over the Col de Balme, to Martigny, St. Maurice, and
round the Lake by Vevay to Lausanne. In the social and singularly
pleasant months that I passed with Mr. Gibbon, he enjoyed his usual
cheerfulness, with good health. Since he left England, in 1788, he
had had a severe attack, mentioned in one of the foregoing letters, of
an Erysipelas, which at last settled in one of his legs, and left some∣thing
of a dropsical tendency; for at this time I first perceived a
considerable degree of swelling about the ancle.</P>
<P>In the beginning of October I left this delightful residence; and
some time after my return to England, our correspondence recom∣menced.</P>

<P>GULLIVER is made to say, in presenting his interpreter,
<Q>My tongue is in the mouth of my friend.</Q> Allow me to say,
with proper expressions and excuses, "My pen is in the hand of
my friend" and the aforesaid friend begs leave thus to continue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remainder of the letter was dictated by Mr. Gibbon, and written by M. With. de Severy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I remember to have read somewhere in Rousseau, of a lover quit∣ting
very often his mistress, to have the pleasure of corresponding
with her. Though not absolutely your lover, I am very much
your admirer, and should be extremely tempted to follow the same
example. The spirit and reason which prevail in your conversation,
appear to great advantage in your letters. The three which I have
<PB N="203" REF="254"/>
received from Berne, Coblentz, and Brussels have given me much
real pleasure; first, as a proof that you are often thinking of me;
secondly, as an evidence that you are capable of keeping a resolu∣tion;
and thirdly, from their own intrinsic merit and entertainment.
The style, without any allowance for haste or hurry, is perfectly
correct; the manner is neither too light, nor too grave; the dimen∣sions
neither too long, nor too short: they are such, in a word, as I
should like to receive from the daughter of my best friend. I attend
your lively journal, through bad roads, and worse inns. Your de∣scription
of men and manners conveys very satisfactory information;
and I am particularly delighted with your remark concerning the
irregular behaviour of the Rhine. But the Rhine, alas! after some
temporary wanderings, will be content to flow in his old channel,
while man—man is the greatest fool of the whole creation.</P>
<P>I direct this letter to Sheffield-Place, where I suppose you arrived
in health and safety. I congratulate my Lady on her quiet establish∣ment
by her fireside; and hope you will be able, after all your ex∣cursions,
to support the climate and manners of Old England. Before
this epistle reaches you, I hope to have received the two promised
letters from Dover and Sheffield-Place. If they should not meet
with a proper return, you will pity and forgive me. I have not yet
heard from Lord Sheffield, who seems to have devolved on his
daughter, the task which she has so gloriously executed. I shall pro∣bably
not write to him, till I have received his first letter of business
from England; but with regard to my Lady, I have most excellent
intentions.</P>
<P>I never could understand how two persons of such superior merit,
as Miss Holroyd and Miss Lausanne, could have so little relish for
one another, as they appeared to have in the beginning; and it was
with great pleasure that I observed the degrees of their growing inti∣macy,
and the mutual regret of their separation. Whatever you
may imagine, your friends at Lausanne have been thinking as fre∣quently
<PB N="231" REF="255"/>
of yourself and company, as you could possibly think of
them; and you will be very ungrateful, if you do not seriously re∣solve
to make them a second visit, under such name and title as you
may judge most agreeable. None of the Severy family, except per∣haps
my secretary, are inclined to forget you; and I am continually
asked for some account of your health, motions, and amusements.
Since your departure, no great events have occurred. I have made
a short excursion to Geneva and Copet, and found Mr. Necker in
much better spirits than when you saw him. They pressed me to
pass some weeks this winter in their house at Geneva; and I may
possibly comply, at least, in part, with their invitation. The aspect of
Lausanne is peaceful and placid; and you have no hopes of a revolution
driving me out of this country. We hear nothing of the proceedings
of the commission<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A commission, at the head of which was Monsieur Fischer, one of the principal members of the government of Berne, a very active and intelligent man, who would have distinguished himself in the administration of any country. This commission, which was accompanied by two or three thousand of the best of the German militia of the Canton of Berne, was sent for the purpose of examining into some attempts to in∣troduce the French revolutionary principles into the Pays de Vaud. Several persons were seized; the greater part were released; the examination was secret, but Rosset and La Motte were confined in the castle of Chillon; and being afterwards condemned, for correspondence with the French, to a long imprisonment, were transferred to the castle of Arbourg. S.</NOTE>, except by playing at cards every evening with
Monsieur Fischer, who often speaks of Lord Sheffield with esteem
and respect. There is no appearance of Rosset and La Motte being
brought to a speedy trial, and they still remain in the castle of
Chillon, which (according to the geography of the National Assem∣bly)
is washed by the sea. Our winter begins with great severity;
and we shall not probably have many balls, which, as you may ima∣gine,
I lament much. Angletine does not consider two French
words as a letter. Montrond sighs and blushes whenever Louisa's
name is mentioned: Philippine wishes to converse with her on men
<PB N="232" REF="256"/>
and manners. The French ladies are settled in town for the winter,
and they form, with Mrs. Trevor, a very agreeable addition to our
society. It is now enlivened by a visit of the Chevalier de Boufflers,
one of the most accomplished men in the <HI>ci devant</HI> kingdom of France.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madame de Silva.</NOTE>, who has miscarried, is about to leave us, I must
either cure or die; and, upon the whole, I believe the former will be
most expedient. You will see her in London, with dear Corea,
next winter. My rival magnificently presents me with an hogshead
of Madeira; so that in honour I could not supplant him: yet I do
assure you, from my heart, that another departure is much more
painful to me. The apartment below<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The apartment principally inhabited during the residence of my family at Lau∣sanne. S.</NOTE> is shut up, and I know not
when I shall again visit it with pleasure. Adieu. Believe me, one and
all, most affectionately yours.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD GIBBON Esq. to the Right Hon. Lord SHEFFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>December 28, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALAS! alas! the daemon of procrastination has again possessed me.
Three months have nearly rolled away since your departure; and
seven letters, five from the most valuable Maria, and two from your∣self,
have extorted from me only a single epistle, which perhaps
would never have been written, had I not used the permission of em∣ploying
my own tongue and the hand of a secretary. Shall I tell you,
that, for these last six weeks, the eve of every day has witnessed a
<HI>firm</HI> resolution, and the day itself has furnished some ingenious delay?
This morning, for instance, I determined to invade you as soon as
the breakfast things should be removed: they were removed; but
I had something to read, to write, to meditate, and there was time
<PB N="233" REF="257"/>
enough before me. Hour after hour has stolen away, and I finally
begin my letter at two o'clock, evidently too late for the post, as I
must dress, dine, go abroad, &amp;c. A foundation, however, <HI>shall be</HI> laid,
which will stare me in the face; and next Saturday I shall probably
be roused by the awful reflection that it is the last day in the year.</P>
<P>After realizing this summer an event which I had long considered
as a dream of fancy, I know not whether I should rejoice or grieve
at your visit to Lausanne. While I possessed the family, the senti∣ment
of pleasure highly predominated; when, just as we had sub∣sided
in a regular, easy, comfortable plan of life, the last trump
sounded, and, without speaking of the pang of separation, you left
me to one of the most gloomy, solitary months of October which I
have ever passed. For yourself and daughters, however, you have
contrived to snatch some of the most interesting scenes of this world.
Paris, at such a moment, Switzerland, and the Rhine, Strasburg,
Coblentz, have suggested a train of lively images and useful ideas,
which will not be speedily erased. The mind of the young damsel,
more especially, will be enlarged and enlightened in every sense. In
four months she has lived many years; and she will much deceive
and displease me, if she does not review and methodize her journal,
in such a manner as she is capable of performing, for the amusement
of her particular friends. Another benefit which will redound from
your recent view is, that every place, person, and object, about
Lausanne, are now become familiar and interesting to you. In our
future correspondence (do I dare pronounce the word correspond∣ence?)
I can talk to you as freely of every circumstance as if it
were actually before your eyes. And first, of my own improve∣ments.
—All those venerable piles of ancient verdure which you <HI>ad∣mired</HI>
have been eradicated in one fatal day. Your faithful substi∣tutes,
William de Severy and Levade, have never ceased to persecute
me, till I signed their death warrant. Their place is now supplied
<PB N="234" REF="258"/>
by a number of picturesque naked poles, the foster-fathers of as
many twigs of Platanusses, which may afford a grateful but distant
shade to the founder, or to his seris Nepotibus. In the mean while
I must confess that the terrace appears broader, and that I discover a
much larger quantity of snow than I should otherwise do. The
workmen admire your ingenious plan for cutting out a new bed∣chamber
and book-room; but, on mature consideration, we all una∣nimously
prefer the old scheme of adding a third room on the ter∣race
beyond the library, with two spacious windows, and a fire-place
between. It will be larger (28 feet by 21), and pleasanter, and
warmer: the difference of expence will be much less considerable
than I imagined: the door of communication with the library will
be artfully buried in the wainscot; and, unless it be opened by my
own choice, may always remain a profound secret. Such is the de∣sign;
but, as it will not be executed before next summer, you have
time and liberty to state your objections. I am much colder about
the staircase, but it may be finished, according to your idea, for
thirty pounds; and I feel they will persuade me. Am I not a very
rich man? When these alterations are completed, few authors of
six volumes in quarto will be more agreeably lodged than myself.
Lausanne is now full and lively; all our native families are re∣turned
from the country; and, praised be the Lord! we are infested
with few foreigners, either French or English. Even our demo∣crats
are more reasonable or more discreet; it is agreed, to wave
the subject of politics, and all seem happy and cordial. I have a
grand dinner this week, a supper of thirty or forty people on
Twelfth-day, &amp;c.; some concerts have taken place, some balls are
talked of; and even Maria would allow (yet it is ungenerous to say
even Maria) that the winter scene at Lausanne is tolerably gay and
active. I say nothing of the Severys, as Angletine has epistolized
Maria last post. She has probably hinted that her brother meditates a
<PB N="235" REF="259"/>
short excursion to Turin: that worthy fellow Trevor has given him
a pressing invitation to his own house. In the beginning of Febru∣ary
I propose going to Geneva for three or four weeks. I shall lodge
and eat with the Neckers; my mornings will be my own, and I shall
spend my evenings in the society of the place, where I have many
acquaintance. This short absence will agitate my stagnant life, and
restore me with fresh appetite to my house, my library, and my
friends. Before that time (the end of February) what events may
happen, or be ready to happen! The National Assembly (compared
to which the former was a senate of heroes and demi-gods) seem re∣solved
to attack Germany <HI>avec quatre millions de bayonettes libres;</HI> the
army of the princes must soon either sight, or starve, or conquer.
Will Sweden draw his sword? will Russia draw her purse? an empty
purse! All is darkness and anarchy: neither party is strong enough
to oppose a settlement; and I cannot see a possibility of an amicable
arrangement, where there are no heads (in any sense of the word)
who can answer for the multitude. Send me your ideas, and those
of Lord Guildford, Lord Loughborough, Fox, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, a word of my vexatious affairs.—Shall I never
sail on the smooth stream of good security and half-yearly interest?
will every body refuse my money? I had already written to Darrel
and Gosling to obey your commands, and was in hopes that you
had already made large and salutary evacuations. During your ab∣sence
I never expected much effect from the cold indifference of
agents; but you are now in England—you will be speedily in Lon∣don:
set all your setting-dogs to beat the field, hunt, enquire, why
should you not advertise? Yet I am almost ashamed to complain of
some stagnation of interest, when I am witness to the natural and
acquired philosophy of so many French, who are reduced from
riches, not to indigence, but to absolute want and beggary. A
Count Argout has just left us, who possessed ten thousand a-year in
<PB N="236" REF="260"/>
the island of St. Domingo; he is utterly burnt and ruined; and a
brother, whom he tenderly loved, has been murdered by the negroes.
These are real misfortunes. I have much revolved the plan of the
Memoirs I once mentioned; and, as you do not think it ridiculous,
I believe I shall make an attempt: if I can please myself, I am con∣fident
of not displeasing; but let this be a profound secret between
us: people must not be prepared to laugh; they must be taken by
surprise. Have you looked over your, or rather my, letters? Surely,
in the course of the year, you may find a safe and cheap occasion of
sending me a parcel; they may assist me. Adieu. I embrace my
Lady: send me a favourable account of her health. I kiss the Mar∣maille.
By an amazing push of remorse and diligence I have
finished my letter (three pages and a half) this same day since
dinner; but I have not time to read it.</P>

<P>I NOW most sincerely repent of my late repentance, and do almost
swear never to renounce the amiable and useful practice of pro∣crastination.
Had I delayed, as I was strongly tempted, another post,
your missive of the 13th, which did not reach me till this morning
(three mails were due), would have arrived in time, and I might
have avoided this second Herculean labour. It will be, however, no
more than an infant Hercules. The topics of conversation have
been fully discussed, and I shall now confine myself to the needful of
the new business. <HI>Felix faustumque sit!</HI> may no untoward accident
disarrange your Yorkshire mortgage; the conclusion of which will
place me in a clear and easy state, such as I have never known since
the first hour of property. * * * *</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="261"/>
The three per cents are so high, and the country is in such a
damned state of prosperity under that fellow Pitt, that it goes against
me to purchase at such low interest. In my visit to England next
autumn, or in the spring following, (alas! you <HI>must</HI> acquiesce in
the alternative,) I hope to be armed with sufficient materials to draw
a sum, which may be employed as taste or fancy shall dictate, in
the improvement of my library, a service of plate, &amp;c. I am not
very sanguine, but surely this is no uncomfortable prospect. This
pecuniary detail, which has not indeed been so unpleasant as it used
formerly to be, has carried me farther than I expected. Let us now
drink and be merry. I flatter myself that your Madeira, improved
by its travels, will set forwards for messrs. Romberg, at Ostend, early
in the spring; and I should be very well pleased if you could add a
hogshead of excellent Claret, for which we should be entitled to the
drawback: they must halt at Baste, and send notice to me for a safe∣conduct.
Have you had any intelligence from Lord Auckland about
the wine which he was to order from Bourdeaux, by Marseilles and
the Rhone? The one need not impede the other; I wish to have a
large stock. Corea has promised me a hogshead of his native Ma∣deira,
for which I am to give him an order on Cadell for a copy of
the Decline and Fall: he vanished without notice, and is now at
Paris. Could you not fish out his direction by Mrs. Wood, who by
this time is in England? I rejoice in Lally's prosperity. Have you
reconsidered my proposal of a declaration of constitutional principles
from the heads of the party? I think a foolish address from a body
of Whigs to the National Assembly renders it still more incumbent
on you. Atchieve my worldly concerns, <HI>et eris mihi magnus Apollo.</HI>

<P>FOR fear you should abuse me, as usual, I will begin the attack,
and scold at you, for not having yet sent me the long-expected
intelligence of the completion of my mortgage. You had positively
assured me that the second of February would terminate my worldly
cares, by a consummation so devoutly to be wished. The news,
therefore, might reach me about the eighteenth; and I argued with
the gentle logic of laziness, that it was perfectly idle to answer your
letter, till I could chaunt a thanksgiving song of gratitude and praise.
As every post disappointed my hopes, the same argument was re∣peated
for the next; and twenty empty-handed postilions have
blown their insignificant horns, till I am provoked at last to write
by sheer impatience and vexation. <HI>Facit indignatio versum. Cospetto
di Baccho;</HI> for I must ease myself by swearing a little. What is
the cause, the meaning, the pretence, of this delay? Are the York-shire
mortgagers inconstant in their wishes? Are the London lawyers
constant in their procrastination? Is a letter on the road, to inform
me that all is concluded, or to tell me that all is broken to pieces?
Had the money been placed in the three per cents last May; besides
the annual interest, it would have gained by the rise of stock nearly
twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> Your Lordship is a wise man, a successful writer,
and an useful senator; you understand America and Ireland, corn
and slaves, but your prejudice against the funds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be more correct if he had said, my preference of land. S.</NOTE>, in which I
am often tempted to join, makes you a little blind to their in∣creasing
value in the hands of our virtuous and excellent minister.
But our regret is vain; one pull more and we reach the shore; and
our future correspondence will be no longer tainted with business.
Shall I then be more diligent and regular? I hope and believe so;
for now that I have got over this article of worldly interest, my letter
<PB N="239" REF="263"/>
seems to be almost finished. <HI>A propos</HI> of letters, am I not a sad
dog to forget my Lady and Maria? Alas! the dual number has
been prejudicial to both. How happy could I be with either, were
t'other dear charmer away. I am like the ass of famous memory;
I cannot tell which way to turn first, and there I stand mute and
immoveable. The Baronial and maternal dignity of my Lady, sup∣ported
by twenty years friendship, may claim the preference. But
the sive incomparable letters of Maria!—Next week, however.—
Am I not ashamed to talk of next week?</P>
<P>I have most successfully, and most agreeably, executed my plan of
spending the month of March at Geneva, in the Necker-house, and
every circumstance that I had arranged turned out beyond my ex∣pectation;
the freedom of the morning, the society of the table and
drawing-room, from half an hour past two till six or seven; an even∣ing
assembly and card-party, in a round of the best company, and,
excepting one day in the week, a private supper of free and friendly
conversation. You would like Geneva better than Lausanne; there
is much more information to be got among the men; but though I
found some agreeable women, their manners and stile of life are,
upon the whole, less easy and pleasant than our own. I was much
pleased with Necker's brother Mr. De Germain, a good-humoured,
polite, sensible man, without the genius and fame of the statesman,
but much more adapted for private and ordinary happiness. Ma∣dame
de Stael is expected in a few weeks at Copet, where they re∣ceive
her, and where, <Q>the pleasing anxious being,</Q> she will
have leisure to regret <Q>to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</Q> which she en∣joyed
amidst the storms of Paris. But what can the poor creature
do? her husband is in Sweden, her lover is no longer secretary at war,
and her father's house is the only place where she can reside with the
least degree of prudence and decency. Of that father I have really a
much higher idea than I ever had before; in our domestic intimacy
he cast away his gloom and reserve; I saw a great deal of his mind,
<PB N="240" REF="264"/>
and all that I saw is fair and worthy. He was overwhelmed by the
hurricane, he mistook his way in the fog, but in such a perilous
situation, I much doubt whether any mortal could have seen or
stood. In the meanwhile, he is abused by all parties, and none of
the French in Geneva will set their foot in his house. He remem∣bers
Lord Sheffield with esteem; his health is good, and he would
be tranquil in his private life, were not his spirits continually
wounded by the arrival of every letter and every newspaper. His
sympathy is deeply interested by the fatal consequences of a revo∣lution,
in which he had acted so leading a part; and he feels as a
friend for the danger of M. de Lessart, who may be guilty in the
eyes of the Jacobius, or even of his judges, by those very actions
and dispatches which would be most approved by all the lovers of
his country. What a momentous event is the Emperor's death!
In the forms of a new reign, and of the Imperial election, the demo∣crats
have at least gained time, if they knew how to use it. But the
new monarch, though of a weak complexion, is of a martial temper;
he loves the soldiers, and is beloved by them; and the slow fluctu∣ating
politics of his uncle may be succeeded by a direct line of
march to the gates of Strasbourg and Paris. It is the opinion of the
master movers in France, (I know it most certainly,) that their troops
will not fight, that the people have lost all sense of patriotism, and
that on the first discharge of an Austrian cannon the game is up.
But what occasion for Austrians or Spaniards? the French are them∣selves
their greatest enemies; four thousand Marseillois are marched
against Arles and Avignon, the <HI>troupes de ligne</HI> are divided between
the two parties, and the flame of civil war will soon extend over the
southern provinces. You have heard of the unworthy treatment
of the Swiss regiment of Ernst. The canton of Berne has bravely
recalled them, with a stout letter to the King of France, which must
be inserted in all the papers. I now come to the most unpleasant
article, our home politics. Bosset and La Motte are condemned to
<PB N="241" REF="265"/>
fine and twenty years imprisonment in the fortress of Arbourg. We
have not yet received their official sentence, nor is it believed that
the proofs and proceedings against them will be published; an auk∣ward
circumstance, which it does not seem easy to justify. Some
(though none of note) are taken up, several are fled, many more are
suspected and suspicious. All are silent, but it is the silence of fear
and discontent; and the secret hatred which rankled against go∣vernment
begins to point against the few who are known to be well-affected.
I never knew any place so much changed as Lausanne,
even since last year; and though you will not be much obliged to
me for the motive, I begin very seriously to think of visiting Shef∣field-Place
by the month of September next. Yet here again I am
frightened, by the dangers of a French, and the difficulties of a
German, route. You must send me an account of the passage from
Dieppe to Brighton, with an itinerary of the Rhine, distances, ex∣pences,
&amp;c. As usual, I just save the post, nor have I time to read
my letter, which, after wasting the morning in deliberation, has
been struck off in a heat since dinner. No news of the Madeira.
Your views of S. P. are just received; they are admired, and shall be
framed. Severy has spent the carnival at Turin. Trevor is only
the best man in the world.</P>

<P>AFTER the receipt of your <HI>penultimate,</HI> eight days ago, I expected,
with much impatience, the arrival of your next-promised epistle.
It arrived this morning, but has not completely answered my ex∣pectations.
I wanted, and I hoped for a full and fair picture of the
present and probable aspect of your political world, with which, at
this distance, I seem every day less satisfied. In the slave question
you triumphed last session, in this you have been defeated. What
<PB N="242" REF="266"/>
is the cause of this alteration? If it proceeded only from an impulse
of humanity, I cannot be displeased, even with an error; since it is
very likely that my own vote (had I possessed one) would have
been added to the majority. But in this rage against slavery, in the
numerous petitions against the slave trade, was there no leaven of
new democratical principles? no wild ideas of the rights and natural
equality of man? It is these, I fear. Some articles in newspapers,
some pamphlets of the year, the Jockey Club, have fallen into my
hands. I do not infer much from such publications; yet I have
never known them of so black and malignant a cast. I shuddered at
Grey's motion; disliked the half-support of Fox, admired the firm∣ness
of Pitt's declaration, and excused the usual intemperance of Burke.
Surely such men as * * *, * * * *, * * * *, * * * *, * * *, have talents for mis∣chief.
I see a club of reform which contains some respectable names.
Inform me of the professions, the principles, the plans, the resources, of
these reformers. Will they heat the minds of the people? Does the
French democracy gain no ground? Will the bulk of your party stand
firm to their own interest, and that of their country? Will you not
take some active measures to declare your sound opinions, and se∣parate
yourselves from your rotten members? If you allow them
to perplex government, if you trifle with this solemn business, if
you do not resist the spirit of innovation in the first attempt, if you
admit the smallest and most specious change in our parliamentary
system, you are lost. You will be driven from one step to another;
from principles just in theory, to consequences most pernicious in
practice; and your first concessions will be productive of every sub∣sequent
mischief, for which you will be answerable to your country
and to posterity. Do not suffer yourselves to be lulled into a false
security; remember the proud fabric of the French monarchy. Not
four years ago it stood founded, as it might seem, on the rock of
time, force, and opinion, supported by the triple aristocracy of the
church, the nobility, and the parliaments. They are crumbled into
<PB N="243" REF="267"/>
dust; they are vanished from the earth. If this tremendous warning
has no effect on the men of property in England; if it does not
open every eye, and raise every arm, you will deserve your fate.
If I am too precipitate, enlighten; if I am too desponding, en∣courage
me.</P>
<P>My pen has run into this argument; for, as much a foreigner
as you think me, on this momentous subject, I feel myself an Eng∣lishman.</P>
<P>The pleasure of residing at Sheffield-Place is, after all, the first
and the ultimate object of my visit to my native country. But when
or how will that visit be effected? Clouds and whirlwinds, Austrian
Croats and Gallic cannibals, seem one very side to impede my passage.
You seem to apprehend the perils or dfficulties of the German road,
and French peace is more sanguinary than civilized war. I must
pass through, perhaps, a thousand republics or municipalities, which
neither obey nor are obeyed. The strictness of passports, and the
popular ferment, are much increased since last summer: aristocrate
is in every mouth, lanterns hang in every street, and an hasty word,
or a casual resemblance, may be fatal. Yet, on the other hand, it
is probable that many English, men, women, and children, will
traverse the country without any accident before next September;
and I am sensible that many things appear more formidable at a dis∣tance
than on a nearer approach. Without any absolute determina∣tion,
we must see what the events of the next three or four months
will produce. In the mean while, I shall expect with impatience
your next letter: let it be speedy; my answer shall be prompt.</P>
<P>You will be glad, or sorry, to learn that my gloomy apprehensions
are much abated, and that my departure, whenever it takes place,
will be an act of choice, rather than of necessity. I do not pretend
to affirm, that secret discontent, dark suspicion, private animosity,
are very materially assuaged; but we have not experienced, nor do
we now apprehend, any dangerous acts of violence, which may
<PB N="244" REF="268"/>
compel me to seek a refuge among the friendly Bears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Berne.</NOTE>, and to aban∣don
my library to the mercy of the democrats. The firmness and
vigour of government have crushed, at least for a time, the spirit of in∣novation;
and I do not believe that the body of the people, especially
the peasants, are disposed for a revolution. From France, praised be
the demon of anarchy! the insurgents of the Pays de Vaud could
not at present have much to hope; and should the <HI>gardes nationales,</HI>
of which there is little appearance, attempt an incursion, the country
is armed and prepared, and they would be resisted with equal num∣bers
and superior discipline. The Gallic wolves that prowled round
Geneva are drawn away, some to the south and some to the north,
and the late events in Flanders seem to have diffused a general con∣tempt,
as well as abhorrence, for the lawless savages, who fly before
the enemy, hang their prisoners, and murder their officers. The
brave and patient regiment of Ernest is expected home every day,
and as Berne will take them into present pay, that veteran and re∣gular
corps will add to the security of our frontier.</P>
<P>I rejoice that we have so little to say on the subject of worldly
affairs. * * * * This summer we are threatened with an inundation,
besides many nameless English and Irish; but I am anxious for the
Duchess of Devonshire and the Lady Elizabeth Foster, who are on
their march. Lord Malmsbury, the <HI>audacieux</HI> Harris, will inform
you that he has seen me: <HI>him</HI> I would have consented to keep.</P>
<P>One word more before we part; call upon Mr. John Nicholls,
bookseller and printer, at Cicero's Head, Red-Lion-Passage, Fleet-Street,
and ask him whether he did not, about the beginning of
March, receive a very polite letter from Mr. Gibbon of Lausanne?
To which, either as a man of business or a civil gentleman, he
should have returned an answer. My application related to a
domestic article in the Gentleman's Magazine of August 1788,
<PB N="245" REF="269"/>
(p. 698,) which had lately fallen into my hands, and concerning
which I requested some farther lights. Mrs. Moss delivered the
letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His letters to me for a certain period, which he desired me to send, to assist him in writing his Memoirs. S.</NOTE> into my hands, but I doubt whether they will be of much
service to me; the work appears far more difficult in the execution
than in the idea, and as I am now taking my leave for some time
of the library, I shall not make much progress in the memoirs of P. P.
till I am on English ground. But is it indeed true, that I shall eat
any Sussex pheasants this autumn? The event is in the book of
Fate, and I cannot unroll the leaves of September and October.
Should I reach Sheffield-Place, I hope to find the whole family in a
perfect state of existence, except a certain Maria Holroyd, my fair
and <HI>generous</HI> correspondent, whose annihilation on proper terms I
most fervently desire. I must receive a copious answer before the
end of next month, June, and again call upon you for a map of

<P>WHEN I inform you, that the design of my English expedition is
at last postponed till another year, you will not be much surprised.
The public obstacles, the danger of one road, and the difficulties of
another, would alone be sufficient to arrest so unwieldy and inactive a
being; and these obstacles, on the side of France, are growing every
day more insuperable. On the other hand, the terrors which might
have driven me from hence have, in a great measure, subsided; our
state-prisoners are forgotten: the country begins to recover its old
good humour and unsuspecting confidence, and the last revolution
<PB N="246" REF="270"/>
of Paris appears to have convinced almost every body of the fatal
consequences of democratical principles, which lead by a path of
flowers into the abyss of hell. I may therefore wait with patience
and tranquillity till the Duke of Brunswick shall have opened the
French road. But if I am not driven from Lausanne, you will ask,
I hope with some indignation, whether I am not drawn to England,
and more especially to Sheffield-Place? The desire of embracing you
and yours is now the strongest, and must gradually become the sole,
inducement that can force me from my library and garden, over
seas and mountains. The English world will forget and be for∣gotten,
and every year will deprive me of some acquaintance, who
by courtesy are styled friends: Lord Guildford and Sir Joshua Rey∣nolds!
two of the men, and two of the houses in London, on
whom I the most relied for the comforts of society.</P>

<P>THUS far had I written in the full confidence of finishing and
sending my letter the next post; but six post-days have unaccountably
slipped away, and were you not accustomed to my silence, you
would almost begin to think me on the road. How dreadfully, since
my last date, has the French road been polluted with blood! and
what horrid scenes may be acting at this moment, and may still be
aggravated, till the Duke of Brunswick is master of Paris! On every
rational principle of calculation he must succeed; yet sometimes,
when my spirits are low, I dread the blind efforts of mad and de∣sperate
multitudes fighting on their own ground. A few days or
weeks must decide the military operations of this year, and perhaps
for ever; but on the fairest supposition, I cannot look forwards to
any firm settlement, either of a legal or an absolute government. I
cannot pretend to give you any Paris news. Should I inform you,
as we believe, that <HI>Lally is still among the cannibals,</HI> you would pos∣sibly

answer, that he is now sitting in the library at Sheffield.
Madame de Stael, after miraculously escaping through pikes and
poignards, has reached the castle of Copet, where I shall see her be∣fore
the end of the week. If any thing can provoke the King of
Sardinia and the Swiss, it must be the foul destruction of <HI>his</HI> cousin
Madame de Lamballe, and of <HI>their</HI> regiment of guards. An extra∣ordinary
council is summoned at Berne, <HI>but resentment may be checked
by prudence.</HI> In spite of Maria's laughter, I applaud your modera∣tion,
and sigh for a hearty union of all the sense and property of
the country. The times require it; but your last political letter was
a cordial to my spirits. The Duchess of D. rather dislikes a coa∣lition:
amiable creature! The Eliza (we call her Bess) is furious
against you for not writing. We shall lose them in a few days; but
the motions of Bess and the Duchess for Italy or England, are doubt∣ful.
Ladies Spencer and Duncannon certainly pass the Alps. I live

propriety of writing to my Lady and Maria; but there is far
from the knowledge to the performance of a duty. Ever your's.</P>

<P>AS our English newspapers must have informed you of the inva∣sion
of Savoy by the French, and as it is possible that you may
have some trifling apprehensions of my <HI>being killed and eaten by those
cannibals,</HI> it has appeared to me that a short extraordinary dispatch
might not be unacceptable on this occasion. It is indeed true, that
about ten days ago the French army of the South, under the com∣mand
of M. de Montesquieu, (if any French army can be said to be
under any command,) has entered Savoy, and possessed themselves
of Chamberry, Montmelian, and several other places. It has always
been the practice of the king of Sardinia to abandon his transalpine
<PB N="248" REF="272"/>
dominions; but on this occasion the court of Turin appears to have
been surprised by the strange excentric motions of a democracy,
which always acts from the passion of the moment; and their infe∣rior
troops have retreated, with some loss and disgrace, into the passes
of the Alps. Mount Cenis is now impervious, and our English tra∣vellers
who are bound for Italy, the Duchess of Devonshire, An∣caster,
&amp;c. will be forced to explore a long circuitous road through
the Tirol. But the Chablais is yet intact, nor can our telescopes dis∣cover
the tricolor banners on the other side of the lake. Our ac∣counts
of the French numbers seem to vary from fifteen to thirty
thousand men; the regulars are few, but they are followed by a
rabble rout, which must soon, however, melt away, as they will find
no plunder, and scanty subsistence, in the poverty and barrenness of
Savoy. <HI>N. B.</HI> I have just seen a letter from Mr. de Montesquieu,
who boasts that at his first entrance into Savoy he had only twelve
battalions. Our intelligence is far from correct.</P>
<P>The magistrates of Geneva were alarmed by this dangerous neigh∣bourhood,
and more especially by the well-known animosity of an
exiled citizen, Claviere, who is one of the six ministers of the
French republic. It was carried by a small majority in the General
Council, to call in the succour of three thousand Swiss, which is sti∣pulated
by antient treaty. The strongest reason or pretence of the
minority, was founded on the danger of provoking the French, and
they seem to have been justified by the event; since the complaint
of the French resident amounts to a declaration of war. The forti∣fications
of Geneva are not contemptible, especially on the side of
Savoy; and it is much doubted whether Mr. de Montesquieu is pre∣pared
for a regular siege; but the malecontents are numerous within
the walls, and I question whether the spirit of the citizens will hold
out against a bombardment. In the mean while the diet has declared
that the first cannon fired against Geneva will be considered as an act
of hostility against the whole Helvetic body. Berne, as the nearest
and most powerful canton, has taken the lead with great vigour and
<PB N="249" REF="273"/>
vigilance; the road is filled with the perpetual succession of troops
and artillery; and, if some disaffection lurks in the towns, the
peasants, especially the Germans, are inflamed with a strong desire
of encountering the murderers of their countrymen. Mr. de Watte∣ville,
with whom you dined at my house last year, refused to accept
the command of the Swiss succour of Geneva, till it was made his
first instruction that he should never, in any case, surrender himself
prisoner of war.</P>
<P>In this situation, you may suppose that we have some fears. I
have great dependence, however, on the many chances in our
favour, the valour of the Swiss, the return of the Piedmontese with
their Austrian allies, eight or ten thousand men from the Milanese,
a diversion from Spain, the great events (how slowly they proceed)
on the side of Paris, the inconstancy and want of discipline of the
French, and the near approach of the winter season. I am not
nervous, but I will not be rash. It will be painful to abandon my
house and library; but, if the danger should approach, I will retreat
before it, first to Berne, and gradually to the North. Should I even
be forced to take refuge in England (a violent measure so late in the
year), you would perhaps receive me as kindly as you do the French
priests—a noble act of hospitality! Could I have foreseen this
storm, I would have been there six weeks ago; but who can foresee
the wild measures of the savages of Gaul? We thought ourselves
perfectly out of the hurricane latitudes. Adieu. I am going to bed,
and must rise early to visit the Neckers at Rolle, whither they have
retired, from the frontier situation of Copet. Severy is on horseback,
with his dragoons: his poor father is dangerously ill. It will be shock∣ing
if it should be found necessary to remove him. While we are

<P>Since my last of the 6th, our attack is not more eminent, and our
defence is most assuredly stronger, two very important circumstances,
at a time when every day is leading us, though not so fast as our im∣patience
could wish, towards the unwarlike month of November; and
we observe with pleasure that the troops of Mr. de Montesquieu,
which are chiefly from the Southern Provinces, will not cheerfully
entertain the rigor of an Alpine winter. The 7th instant, Mr. de
Chateauneuf, the French resident, took his leave with an haughty
mandate, commanding the Genevois, as they valued their safety and
the friendship of the republic, to dismiss their Swiss allies, and to
punish the magistrates who had traiterously proposed the calling in
these foreign troops. It is precisely the fable of the wolves, who
offered to make peace with the sheep, provided they would send
away their dogs. You know what became of the sheep. This de∣mand
appears to have kindled a just and general indignation, since it
announced an edict of proscription; and must lead to a democratical
revolution, which would probably renew the horrid scenes of Paris
and Avignon. A general assembly of the citizens was convened, the
message was read, speeches were made, oaths were taken, and it was
resolved (with only three dissentient voices) to live and die in the
defence of their country. The Genevois muster above three thou∣sand
well-armed citizens; and the Swiss, who may easily be in∣creased
(in a few hours) to an equal number, add spirit to the timo∣rous,
<PB N="251" REF="275"/>
and confidence to the well-affected: their arsenals are filled
with arms, their magazines with ammunition, and their granaries
with corn. But their fortifications are extensive and imperfect, they
are commanded from two adjacent hills; a French faction lurks in
the city, the character of the Genevois is rather commercial than
military, and their behaviour, lofty promise, and base surrender, in
the year 1782, is fresh in our memories. In the mean while, 4000
French at the most are arrived in the neighbouring camp, nor is
there yet any appearance of mortars or heavy artillery. Perhaps
an haughty menace may be repelled by a firm countenance. If it
were worth while talking of justice, what a shameful attack of a
feeble, unoffending state! On the news of their danger, all Swit∣zerland,
from Schassouse to the Pays de Vaud, has risen in arms;
and a French resident, who has passed through the country, in his
way from Ratisbon, declares his intention of informing and admo∣nishing
the National Convention. About eleven thousand Bernois
are already posted in the neighbourhood of Copet and Nyon; and
new reinforcements of men, artillery, &amp;c. arrive every day. Ano∣ther
army is drawn together to oppose Mr. de Ferrieres, on the side
of Bienne and the bishopric of Basle; and the Austrians in Swabia
would be easily persuaded to cross the Rhine in our defence. But
we are yet ignorant whether our sovereigns mean to wage an
offensive or defensive war. If the latter, which is more likely, will
the French begin the attack? Should Genoa yield to fear or force,
this country is open to an invasion; and though our men are brave,
we want generals; and I despise the French much less than I did two
months ago. It should seem that our hopes from the King of Sar∣dinia
and the Austrians of Milan are faint and distant; Spain sleeps;
and the Duke of Brunswick (amazement!) seems to have failed in his
great project. For my part, till Geneva falls, I do not think of a
retreat; but, at all events, I am provided with two strong horses, and
an hundred Louis in gold. Zurich would be probably my winter quar∣ters,
<PB N="252" REF="276"/>
and the society of the Neckers would make any place agreeable.
Their situation is worse than mine: I have no daughter ready to lie
in; nor do I fear the French aristocrats on the road. Adieu. Keep

Devonshire leaves us next week. Lady Elizabeth abhors you. Ever

<P>SINCE my last, our affairs take a more pacific turn; but I will not
venture to affirm that our peace will be either safe or honourable.
Mr. de Montesquieu and three commissioners of the Convention,
who are at Carrouge, have had frequent conferences with the magis∣trates
of Geneva; several expresses have been dispatched to and from
Paris, and every step of the negotiation is communicated to the de∣puties
of Berne and Zurich. The French troops observe a very
tolerable degree of order and discipline; and no act of hostility has
yet been committed on the territory of Geneva.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>My usual temper very readily admitted the excuse, that it would
be better to wait another week, till the final settlement of our affairs.
The treaty is signed between France and Geneva; and the ratifica∣tion
of the Convention is looked upon as assured, if any thing can be
assured in that wild democracy. On condition that the Swiss garri∣son,
with the approbation of Berne and Zurich, be recalled before
the first of December, it is stipulated that the independence of Ge∣neva
shall be preserved inviolate; that Mr. de Montesquieu shall im∣mediately
send away his heavy artillery; and that no French troops
shall approach within ten leagues of the city. As the Swiss have
acted only as auxiliaries, they have no occasion for a direct treaty; but
they cannot prudently disarm, till they are satisfied of the pacific
<PB N="253" REF="277"/>
intentions of France; and no such satisfaction can be given till they
have acknowledged the new republic, which they will probably do
in a few days, with a deep groan of indignation and sorrow; it has
been cemented with the blood of their countrymen! But when the
Emperour, the King of Prussia, the first general, and the first army
in Europe have failed, less powerful states may acquiesce, without
dishonour, in the determination of fortune. Do you understand this
most unexpected failure? I will allow an ample share to the badness
of the roads and the weather, to famine and disease, to the skill of
Dumourier, a heaven-born general! and to the enthusiastic ardour
of the new Romans; but still, still there must be some secret and
shameful cause at the bottom of this strange retreat. We are now
delivered from the impending terrors of siege and invasion. The
Geneva <HI>emigrés,</HI> particularly the Neckers, are hastening to their
homes; and I shall not be reduced to the hard necessity of seeking a
winter asylum at Zurich or Constance: but I am not pleased with
our future prospects. It is much to be feared that the present govern∣ment
of Geneva will be soon modelled after the French fashion; the
new republic of Savoy is forming on the opposite bank of the Lake;
the Jacobin missionaries are powerful and zealous; and the malecon∣tents
of this country, who begin again to rear their heads, will be
surrounded with temptations, and examples, and allies. I know not
whether the Pays de Vaud will long adhere to the dominion of
Berne; or whether I shall be permitted to end my days in this little
paradise, which I have so happily suited to my taste and circum∣stances.</P>
<P>Last Monday only I received your letter, which had strangely
loitered on the road since its date of the 29th of September. There
must surely be some disorder in the posts, since the Eliza departed
indignant at never having heard from you.</P>
<P>The case of my wine I think peculiarly hard: to lose my Madeira,
and to be scolded for losing it. I am much indebted to Mr. Nichols for
<PB N="254" REF="278"/>
his genealogical communications, which I am impatient to receive;
but I do not understand why so civil a gentleman could not favour
me, in six months, with an answer by the post: since he entrusts me
with these valuable papers, you have not, I presume, informed him
of my negligence and awkwardness in regard to manuscripts. Your
reproach rather surprises me, as I suppose I am much the same as I
have been for these last twenty years. Should you hold your resolu∣tion
of writing only such things as may be published at Charing-Cross,
our future correspondence would not be very interesting. But
I expect and require, at this important crisis, a full and confidential
account of your views concerning England, Ireland, and France.
You have a strong and clear eye; and your pen is, perhaps, the most
useful quill that ever has been plucked from a goose. Your protec∣tion
of the French resugees is highly applauded. Rosset and La

disagreeable demands from the republic. Adieu. Ever yours.</P>

<P>RECEIVED this day, November 9th, a most amiable dispatch
from the too humble secretary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miss Holroyd.</NOTE> of the family of Espee<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Meaning Sheffield-Place.</NOTE>, dated
October 24th, which I answer the same day. It will be acknow∣ledged,
that I have fulfilled my engagements with as much accuracy
as our uncertain state and the fragility of human nature would allow.
I resume my narrative. At the time when we imagined that all was
settled, by an equal treaty between two such unequal powers, as the
Geneva Flea and the Leviathan France, we were thunderstruck with
the intelligence that the ministers of the republic refused to ratify the
conditions; and they were indignant, with some colour of reason, at
<PB N="255" REF="279"/>
the hard obligation of withdrawing their troops to the distance of
ten leagues, and of consequently leaving the Pays de Gez naked,
and exposed to the Swiss, who had assembled 15,000 men on the
frontier, and with whom they had not made any agreement. The
messenger who was sent last Sunday from Geneva is not yet re∣turned;
and many persons are afraid of some design and danger in
this delay. Montesquieu has acted with politeness, moderation, and
apparent sincerity; but he may resign, he may be superseded, his
place may be occupied by an <HI>enragé,</HI> by Servan, or Prince Charles
of Hesse, who would aspire to imitate the predatory fame of Custine
in Germany. In the mean while, the General holds a wolf by the
ears; an officer who has seen his troops, about 18,000 men (with a
tremendous train of artillery), represents them as a black, daring, des∣perate
crew of buccaneers, rather shocking than contemptible; the
officers (scarcely a gentleman among them), without servants, or
horses, or baggage, lying <HI>higgledy piggledy</HI> on the ground with the
common men, yet maintaining a rough kind of discipline over them.
They already begin to accuse and even to suspect their general, and
call aloud for blood and plunder: could they have an opportunity of
squeezing some of the rich citizens, Geneva would cut up as sat as
most towns in Europe. During this suspension of hostilities they are
permitted to visit the city without arms, sometimes three or four
hundred at a time; and the magistrates, as well as the Swiss com∣mander,
are by no means pleased with this dangerous intercourse,
which they dare not prohibit. Such are our fears: yet it should seem
on the other side, that the French affect a kind of magnanimous justice
towards their little neighbour, and that they are not ambitious of an
unprofitable contest with the poor and hardy Swiss. The Swiss are
not equal to a long and expensive war; and as most of our militia
have families and trades, the country already sighs for their return.
Whatever can be yielded, without absolute danger or disgrace, will
<PB N="256" REF="280"/>
doubtless be granted; and the business will probably end in our owning
the sovereignty, and trusting to the good faith of the republic of France:
how that word would have sounded four years ago! The measure
is humiliating; but after the retreat of the Duke of Brunswick, and
the failure of the Austrians, the smaller powers may acquiesce with∣out
dishonour. Every dog has his day; and these Gallic dogs have
their day, at least, of most insolent prosperity. After forcing or
tempting the Prussians to evacuate their country, they conquer Sa∣voy,
pillage Germany, threaten Spain: the Low Countries are ere
now invaded; Rome and Italy tremble; they scour the Mediterra∣nean,
and talk of sending a squadron into the South Sea. The whole
horizon is so black, that I begin to feel some anxiety for England,
the last refuge of liberty and law; and the more so, as I perceive
from Lord Sheffield's last epistle that his firm nerves are a little shaken:
but of this more in my next, for I want to unburthen my conscience.
If England, with the experience of our happiness and French calami∣ties,
should now be seduced to eat the apple of false freedom, we
should indeed deserve to be driven from the paradise which we
enjoy. I turn aside from the horrid and improbable (yet not impos∣sible)
supposition, that, in three or four years' time, myself and my
best friends may be reduced to the deplorable state of the French
emigrants: they thought it as impossible three or four years ago.
Never did a revolution affect, to such a degree, the private existence
of such numbers of the first people of a great country: your ex∣amples
of misery I could easily match with similar examples in this
country and the neighbourhood; and our sympathy is the deeper,
as we do not possess, like you, the means of alleviating, in some
degree, the misfortunes of the fugitives. But I must have, from the
very excellent pen of the Maria, the tragedy of the Archbishop of
Arles; and the longer the better. Madame de Biron has probably
been tempted by some faint and (I fear) fallacious promises of cle∣mency
<PB N="257" REF="281"/>
to the women, and which have likewise engaged Madame
d'Aguesseau and her two daughters to revisit France. Madame de
Bouillon stands her ground, and her situation as a foreign princess is
less exposed. As Lord S. has assumed the glorious character of pro∣tector
of the distressed, his name is pronounced with gratitude and
respect. The D. of Richmond is praised, on Madame de Biron's
account. To the Princess d'Henin, and Lally, I wish to be remem∣bered.
The Neckers cannot venture into Geneva, and Madame de
Stael will probably lie in at Rolle. He is printing a defence of the
King, &amp;c. against their republican Judges; but the name of Necker
is unpopular to all parties, and I much fear that the guillotine will
be more speedy than the press. It will, however, be an eloquent
performance; and, if I find an opportunity, I am to send you one,
to you Lord S. by his particular desire: he wishes likewise to con∣vey
some copies with speed to our principal people, Pitt, Fox, Lord
Stormont, &amp;c. But such is the rapid succession of events, that it
will appear like the <HI>Pouvoir Executif,</HI> his best work, after the whole
scene has been totally changed. Ever yours.</P>

<P>The revolution of France, and my triple dispatch by the
same post to Sheffield-Place, are, in my opinion, the two most
singular events in the eighteenth century. I found the task so
easy and pleasant, that I had some thoughts of adding a letter
to the gentle Louisa. I am this moment informed, that our

<P>IN dispatching the weekly political journal to Lord S. my con∣science
(for I have some remains of conscience) most powerfully
urges me to salute, with some lines of friendship and gratitude, the
amiable secretary, who might save herself the trouble of a modest
apology. I have not yet forgotten our different behaviour after the
much lamented <HI>separation</HI> of October the 4th, 1791, your meritori∣ous
punctuality, and my unworthy silence. I have still before me
that entertaining narrative, which would have interested me, not only
in the progress of the <HI>carissima familia,</HI> but in the motions of a
Tartar camp, or the march of a caravan of Arabs; the mixture of
just observation and lively imagery, the strong sense of a man, ex∣pressed
with the easy elegance of a female. I still recollect with
pleasure the happy comparison of the Rhine, who had heard so much
of liberty on both his banks, that he wandered with mischievous
licentiousness over all the adjacent meadows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon alludes to letters written to him by Miss Holroyd, when she was returning from Switzerland, along the Rhine, to England. S.</NOTE>. The inundation,
alas! has now spread much wider; and it is sadly to be feared that
the Elbe, the Po, and the Danube, may imitate the vile example of
the Rhine: I shall be content, however, if our own Thames still
preserves his fair character, of</P>
<Q>Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.</Q>
<P>These agreeable epistles of Maria produced only some dumb in∣tentions,
and some barren remorse; nor have I designed, except by
a brief missive from my chancellor, to express how much I loved
the author, and how much I was pleased with the composition.
That amiable author I have known and loved from the first dawning
of her life and <HI>coquetry,</HI> to the present maturity of her talents; and as
<PB N="259" REF="283"/>
long as I remain on this planet, I shall pursue, with the same tender
and even anxious concern, the future steps of her establishment and
life. That establishment must be splendid; that life must be happy.
She is endowed with every gift of nature and fortune; but the ad∣vantage
which she will derive from them, depends almost entirely on
herself. You must not, you shall not, think yourself unworthy to
write to any man: there is none whom your correspondence would
not amuse and satisfy. I will not undertake a task, which my taste
would adopt, and my indolence would too soon relinquish; but I
am really curious, from the best motives, to have a particular account
of your own studies and daily occupation. What books do you read?
and how do you employ your time and your pen? Except some
professed scholars, I have often observed that women in general read
much more than men; but, for want of a plan, a method, a fixed
object, their reading is of little benefit to themselves, or others. If
you will inform me of the species of reading to which you have the
most propensity, I shall be happy to contribute my share of advice or
assistance. I lament that you have not left me some monument of
your pencil. Lady Elizabeth Foster has executed a very pretty
drawing, taken from the door of the green-house where we dined
last summer, and including the poor Acacia (now recovered from the
cruel sheers of the gardener), the end of the terrace, the front of the
Pavilion, and a distant view of the country, lake, and mountains. I
am almost reconciled to d'Apples' house, which is nearly finished.
Instead of the monsters which Lord Hercules Sheffield extirpated,
the terrace is already shaded with the new acacias and plantanes; and
although the uncertainty of possession restrains me from building, I
myself have planted a bosquet at the bottom of the garden, with such
admirable skill that it affords shade without intercepting prospect.
The society of the aforesaid Eliza, commonly called Bess, of the
Duchess of D. &amp;c. has been very interesting; but they are now flown
beyond the Alps, and pass the winter at Pisa. The Legards, who
<PB N="260" REF="284"/>
have long since left this place, should be at present in Italy; but I
believe Mrs. Grimstone and her daughter returned to England. The
Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ades are highly flattered by your remembrance. Since you still
retain some attachment to this delightful country, and it is indeed
delightful, why should you despair of seeing it once more? The
happy peer or commoner, whose name you may assume, is still con∣cealed
in the book of fate; but, whosoever he may be, he will cheer∣fully
obey your commands, of leading you from—Castle to
Lausanne, and from Lausanne to Rome and Naples. Before that
this event takes place, I may possibly see you in Sussex; and,
whether as a visitor or a fugitive, I hope to be welcomed with a
friendly embrace. The delay of this year was truly painful, but it
was inevitable; and individuals must submit to those storms which
have overturned the thrones of the earth. The tragic story of the
Archbishop of Arles I have now somewhat a better right to require
at your hands. I wish to have it in all its horrid details<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Answer to Mr. Gibbon's Letter is annexed, as giving the best account I have seen of the barbarous transaction alluded to. S.</P>

<P>YOUR three letters received yesterday caused the most sincere pleasure to each individual of this family; to none more than myself. Praise, (I fear, beyond my deserts,) from one whose opinion I so highly value, and whose esteem I so much wish to preserve, is more pleasing than I can describe. I had not neglected to make the collection of facts which you recommend, and which the great variety of unfortunate persons whom we see, or with whom we correspond, enables me to make.</P>
<P>As to that part of your letter which respects <HI>my studies,</HI> I can only say, the slightest hint on that subject is always received with the greatest gratitude, and attended to with the utmost punctuality; but I must decline that topic for the present, to obey your commands, which require from me the horrid account of the <HI>massacre aux Carmes.</HI>—Eight respectable ecclesiastics landed, about the beginning of October, from an open boat at Seaford, wet as the waves. The natives of the coast were endeavouring to get from them what they had not, (viz.) money, when a gentle∣man of the neighbourhood came to their protection; and, finding they had nothing, shewed his good sense, by dispatching them to Milord Sheffield: they had been pillaged, and with great difficulty had escaped from Paris. The reception they met with at this house, seemed to make the greatest impression on them; they were in extacy on finding M. de Lally living: they gradually became cheerful, and en∣joyed their dinner: they were greatly affected as they recollected themselves, and found us attending on them. Having dined, and drank a glass of wine, they began to discover the beauties of the dining-room, and of the chateau: as they walked about, they were overheard to express their admiration at the treatment they met, and <HI>from Protestants.</HI> We then assembled in the library, formed half a circle round the fire, M. de Lally and Milord occupying the hearth <HI>à l'Angloise,</HI> and questioning the priests concerning their escape. Thus we discovered, that two of these unfor∣tunate men were in the Carmelite Convent at the time of the massacre of the one hundred and twenty priests, and had most miraculously escaped, by climbing trees in the garden, and from thence over the tops of the buildings. One of them, a man of superior appearance, described, in the most pathetic manner, the death of the Archbishop of Arles, (and with such simplicity and feeling, as to leave no doubt of the truth of all that he said,) to the following purport.—On the second of Sep∣tember, about five o'clock in the evening, at the time they were permitted to walk in the garden, expecting every hour to be released, they expressed their surprise at seeing several large pits, which had been digging for two days past: they said, the day is almost spent; and yet Manuel told a person who interceded for us last Thurs∣day, that on the Sunday following not one should remain in captivity: we are still prisoners: soon after, they heard shouts, and some musquet-shots. An ensign of the national guard, some commissaries of the sections, and some Marseillois rushed in: the miserable victims, who were dispersed in the garden, assembled under the walls of the church, not daring to go in, lest it should be polluted with blood. One man, who was behind the rest, was shot. "<HI>Point de coup de fusils,</HI>" cried one of the chiefs of the assassins, thinking that kind of death too easy. These well-trained fusileers went to the rear; les piques, les haches, les poignards came forward. They demanded the Archbishop of Arles; he was immediately surrounded by all the priests. The worthy prelate said to his friends, <Q>Let me pass; if my blood will appease them, what signifies it, if I die? Is it not my duty to preserve your lives at the expence of my own?</Q> He asked the eldest of the priests to give him absolution: he knelt to receive it; and when he arose, forced himself from them, advanced slowly, and with his arms crossed upon his breast, and his eyes raised to heaven, said to the assassins, "<HI>Je suis celui que vous cherchez.</HI>" His appearance was so dignified and noble, that, during ten minutes, not one of these wretches had cou∣rage to lift his hand against him: they upbraided each other with cowardice, and advanced; one look from this venerable man struck them with awe, and they re∣tired. At last, one of the miscreants struck off the cap of the Archbishop with a pike; respect once violated, their fury returned, and another from behind cut him through the skull with a sabre. He raised his right hand to his eyes; with another stroke they cut off his hand. The Archbishop said, <HI>O! mon Dieu!</HI> and raised the other: a third stroke across the face left him sitting; the fourth extended him life∣less on the ground; and then all pressed forward, and buried their pikes and poignards in the body. The priests all agreed, that he had been one of the most amiable men in France; and that his only <HI>crime</HI> was, having, since the revolution, expended his private fortune, to support the necessitous clergy of his diocese. The second victim was the General des Benedictins. Then the national guards obliged the priests to go into the church, telling them, they should appear, one after another, before the Commissaires du section. They had hardly entered, before the people impatiently called for them; upon which, all kneeling before the altar, the Bishop of Beauvais gave them absolution: they were then obliged to go out, two by two; they passed before a commissaire, who did not question, but only counted, his victims; they had in their sight the heaps of dead, to which they were going to add. Among the one hundred and twenty priests thus sacrificed, were the Bishops of Zaintes and Beauvais (both of the Rochefoucauld family). I should not omit to remark, that one of the priests observed they were assassinated, because they would not swear to a constitution which their murderers had destroyed. We had (to comfort us for this melancholy story) the most grateful expressions of gratitude to∣wards the English nation, from whom they did not do us the justice to expect such a reception.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that the whole business of the massacres was concerted at a meeting at the Duke of Orleans's house. I shall make you as dismal as myself by this narration. I must change the style. * * * * * * * * * *</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>; and as you
<PB N="261" REF="285"/>
are now so much mingled with the French exiles, I am of opinion,
that were you to keep a journal of all the authentic facts which they
<PB N="262" REF="286"/>
relate, it would be an agreeable exercise at present, and a future
source of entertainment and instruction.</P>
<P>I should be obliged to you, if you would make, or find, some ex∣cuse
for my not answering a letter from your aunt, which was pre∣sented
to me by Mr. Fowler. I shewed him some civilities, but he
is now a poor invalid, confined to his room. By her channel and
yours I should be glad to have some information of the health, spirits,
and situation of Mrs. Gibbon of Bath, whose alarms (if she has any)
you may dispel. She is in my debt. Adieu; most truly yours.</P>

<P>I COULD never forgive myself, were I capable of writing by the
same post, a political epistle to the father, and a friendly letter to
the daughter, without sending any token of remembrance to the re∣spectable
matron, my dearest my Lady, whom I have now loved as a
sister for something better or worse than twenty years. No, indeed,
the historian may be careless, he may be indolent, he may always
intend and never execute, but he is neither a monster nor a statue;
he has a memory, a conscience, a heart, and that heart is sincerely
devoted to Lady S—. He must even acknowledge the fallacy of
a sophism which he has sometimes used, and she has always and
most truly denied; that, where the persons of a family are strictly
united, the writing to one is in fact writing to all; and that con∣sequently
all his numerous letters to the husband, may be considered
as equally addressed to his wife. He feels, on the contrary, that
separate minds have their distinct ideas and sentiments, and that
each character, either in speaking or writing, has its peculiar tone
of conversation. He agrees with the maxim of Rousseau, that
three friends who wish to disclose a common secret, will impart it
only <HI>deux à deux;</HI> and he is satisfied that, on the present memorable
occasion, each of the persons of the Sheffield family will claim a
peculiar share in this triple missive, which will communicate, how∣ever,
a triple satisfaction. The experience of what may be effected
by vigorous resolution, encourages the historian to hope that he
shall cast the skin of the old serpent, and hereafter shew himself as
a new creature.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="288"/>
I lament, on all our accounts, that the last year's expedition to
Lausanne did not take place in a golden period, of health and spirits.
But we must reflect, that human felicity is seldom without alloy;
and if we cannot indulge the hope of your making a second visit to
Lausanne, we must look forwards to my residence next summer at
Sheffield-Place, where I must find you in the full bloom of health,
spirits, and beauty. I can perceive, by all public and private intel∣ligence,
that your house has been the open hospitable asylum of
French fugitives; and it is a sufficient proof of the firmness of your
nerves, that you have not been overwhelmed or agitated by such a
concourse of strangers. Curiosity and compassion may, in some de∣gree,
have supported you. Every day has presented to your view
some new scene of that strange tragical romance, which occupies all
Europe so infinitely beyond any event that has happened in our
time, and you have the satisfaction of not being a mere spectator of
the distress of so many victims of false liberty. The benevolent
fame of Lord S. is widely diffused.</P>
<P>From Angletine's last letter to Maria, you have already some idea
of the melancholy state of her poor father. As long as Mr. de Se∣very
allowed our hopes and fears to fluctuate with the changes of
his disorder, I was unwilling to say any thing on so painful a sub∣ject;
and it is with the deepest concern that I now confess our ab∣solute
despair of his recovery. All his particular complaints are now
lost in a general dissolution of the whole frame; every principle
of life is exhausted, and as often as I am admitted to his bed-side,
though he still looks and smiles with the patience of an angel, I
have the heart-felt grief of seeing him each day drawing nearer to
the term of his existence. A few weeks, possibly a few days, will
deprive me of a most excellent friend, and break for ever the
most perfect system of domestic happiness, in which I had so large
and intimate a share. Wilhelm (who has obtained leave of ab∣sence
<PB N="265" REF="289"/>
from his military duty) and his sister behave and feel like
tender and dutiful children; but they have a long gay prospect of
life, and new connections, new families will make them forget, in
due time, the common lot of mortality. But it is Madame de Se∣very
whom I truly pity; I dread the effects of the first shock, and I
dread still more the deep perpetual consuming affliction for a loss
which can never be retrieved. You will not wonder that such re∣flections
sadden my own mind, nor can I forget how much my situation
is altered since I retired, nine years ago, to the banks of the Leman
Lake. The death of poor Deyverdun first deprived me of a do∣mestic
companion, who can never be supplied; and your visit has
only served to remind me that man, however amused and occupied
in his closet, was not made to live alone. Severy will soon be no
more; his widow for a long time, perhaps for ever, will be lost to
herself and her friends, the son will travel, and I shall be left a
stranger in the insipid circle of mere common acquaintance. The
revolution of France, which first embittered and divided the society of
Lausanne, has opposed a barrier to my Sussex visit, and may finally
expel me from the paradise which I inhabit. Even that paradise,
the expensive and delightful establishment of my house, library, and
garden, almost becomes an incumbrance, by rendering it more dif∣ficult
for me to relinquish my hold, or to form a new system of life
in my native country, for which my income, though improved and
improving, would be probably insufficient. But every complaint
should be silenced by the contemplation of the French; compared
with whose cruel fate, all misery is relative happiness. I perfectly
concur in your partiality for Lally; though Nature might forget
some meaner ingredients, of prudence, oeconomy, &amp;c. she never
formed a purer heart, or a brighter imagination. If he be with you,
I beg my kindest salutations to him. I am every day more closely
united with the Neckers. Should France break, and this country
<PB N="266" REF="290"/>
be over-run, they would be reduced, in very humble circumstances,
to seek a refuge; and where but in England? Adieu, dear Madam,
there is, indeed, much pleasure in discharging one's heart to a real
friend. Ever yours.</P>

<P>AFTER the triple labour of my last dispatch, your experience of
the creature might tempt you to suspect that it would again re∣lapse
into a long slumber. But, partly from the spirit of contradiction,
(though I am not a lady,) and partly from the ease and pleasure which
I now find in the task, you see me again alive, awake, and almost
faithful to my hebdomadal promise. The last week has not, how∣ever,
afforded any events deserving the notice of an historian. Our
affairs are still floating on the waves of the convention, and the rati∣fication
of a corrected treaty, which had been fixed for the twentieth,
is not yet arrived; but the report of the diplomatic committee has
been favourable, and it is generally understood that the leaders of
the French republic do not wish to quarrel with the Swiss. We are
gradually withdrawing and disbanding our militia. Geneva will be
left to sink or swim, according to the humour of the people; and our
last hope appears to be, that by submission and good behaviour we
shall avert for some time the impending storm. A few days ago an
odd accident happened in the French army; the defertion of the ge∣neral.
As the Neckers were sitting, about eight o'clock in the even∣ing,
in their drawing-room at Rolle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A considerable town between Lausanne and Geneva.</NOTE>, the door flew open, and they
<PB N="267" REF="291"/>
were astounded by their servant's announcing <HI>Monsieur le General
de Montesquieu?</HI> On the receipt of some secret intelligence of a
<HI>decret d'accusation,</HI> and an order to arrest him, he had only time to
get on horseback, to gallop through Geneva, to take boat for Copet,
and to escape from his pursuers, who were ordered to seize him alive
or dead. He left the Neckers after supper, passed through Lausanne
in the night, and proceeded to Berne and Basle, whence he intended
to wind his way through Germany, amidst enemies of every descrip∣tion,
and to seek a refuge in England, America, or the moon. He
told Necker, that the sole remnant of his fortune consisted in a
wretched sum of twenty thousand livres; but the public report, or
suspicion, bespeaks him in much better circumstances. Besides the
reproach of acting with too much tameness and delay, he is accused
of making very foul and exorbitant contracts; and it is certain that
new Sparta is infected with this vice, beyond the example of the
most corrupt monarchy. Kellerman is arrived, to take the com∣mand;
and it is apprehended that on the first of December, after the
departure of the Swiss, the French may <HI>request</HI> the permission of
using Geneva, a friendly city, for their winter quarters. In that
case, the democratical revolution, which we all foresee, will be very
speedily effected.</P>
<P>I would ask you, whether you apprehend there was any treason in
the Duke of Brunswick's retreat, and whether you have totally
withdrawn your confidence and esteem from that once-famed ge∣neral?
Will it be possible for England to preserve her neutrality
with any honour or safety? We are bound, as I understand, by
treaty, to guarantee the dominions of the King of Sardinia and the
Austrian provinces of the Netherlands. These countries are now
invaded and over-run by the French. Can we refuse to fulfil our
engagements, without exposing ourselves to all Europe as a per∣fidious
or pusillanimous nation? Yet, on the other hand, can we
assist those allies, without plunging headlong into an abyss, whose
<PB N="268" REF="292"/>
bottom no man can discover? But my chief anxiety is for our do∣mestic
tranquillity; for I must find a retreat in England, should I
be driven from Lausanne. The idea of firm and honourable union
of parties pleases me much; but you must frankly unfold what are the
great difficulties that may impede so salutary a measure: you write to
a man discreet in speech, and now careful of papers. Yet what can
such a coalition avail? Where is the champion of the constitution?
Alas, Lord Guildford! I am much pleased with the Manchester
Ass. The asses or wolves who sacrificed him have cast off the mask too
soon; and such a nonsensical act must open the eyes of many simple
patriots, who might have been led astray by the specious name of
reform. It should be made as notorious as possible. Next winter may
be the crisis of our fate, and if you begin to improve the constitution,
you may be driven step by step from the disfranchisement of old
Sarum to the King in Newgate, the Lords voted useless, the Bishops
abolished, and a House of Commons without articles (<HI>sans cu∣lottes</HI>). Necker has ordered you a copy of his royal defence, which
has met with, and deserved, universal success. The pathetic and
argumentative parts are, in my opinion, equally good, and his mild
eloquence may persuade without irritating. I have applied to this
gentler tone some verses of Ovid, (Metamorph. l. iii. 302, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>Quà tamen usque potest, vires sibi demere tentat.</L>
<L>Nec, quo centimanum dejecerat igne Typhoea,</L>

</LG></NOTE>)
which you may read. Madame de Stael has produced a second son.
She talks wildly enough of visiting England this winter. She is a
pleasant little woman. Poor Severy's condition is hopeless. Should
he drag through the winter, Madame de S. would scarcely survive
<PB N="269" REF="293"/>
him. She kills herself with grief and fatigue. What a difference
in Lausanne! I hope triple answers are on the road. I must write
soon; the <HI>times</HI> will not allow me to read or think. Ever yours.</P>

<P>OUR little storm has now completely subsided, and we are again
spectators, though anxious spectators, of the general tempest that
invades or threatens almost every country of Europe. Our troops
are every day disbanding and returning home, and the greatest part
of the French have evacuated the neighbourhood of Geneva. Mon∣sieur
Barthelemy, whom you have seen secretary in London, is most
courteously entertained, as ambassador, by the Helvetic body. He is
now at Berne, where a diet will speedily be convened; the language
on both sides is now pacific, and even friendly, and some hopes are
given of a provision for the officers of the Swiss guards who have
survived the massacres of Paris.</P>

<P>WITH the return of peace I have relapsed into my former indo∣lence;
but now awakening, after a fortnight's slumber, I have little
or nothing to add, with regard to the internal state of this country,
only the revolution of Geneva has already taken place, as I an∣nounced,
but sooner than I expected. The Swiss troops had no
sooner evacuated the place, than the <HI>Egaliseurs,</HI> as they are called,
assembled in arms; and as no resistance was made, no blood was
shed on the occasion. They seized the gates, disarmed the garrison,
imprisoned the magistrates, imparted the rights of citizens to all the
rabble of the town and country, and proclaimed a <HI>National</HI> Conven∣tion,
<PB N="270" REF="294"/>
which has not yet met. They are all for a pure and absolute
democracy; but some wish to remain a small independent state,
whilst others aspire to become a part of the republic of France; and
as the latter, though less numerous, are more violent and absurd
than their adversaries, it is highly probable that they will succeed.
The citizens of the best families and fortunes have retired from Ge∣neva
into the Pays de Vaud; but the French methods of recalling
or proscribing emigrants, will soon be adopted. You must have ob∣served,
that Savoy is now become <HI>le department du Mont Blanc.</HI> I
cannot satisfy myself, whether the mass of the people is pleased or
displeased with the change; but my noble scenery is clouded by
the democratical aspect of twelve leagues of the opposite coast, which
every morning obtrude themselves on my view. I here conclude the
first part of the history of our Alpine troubles, and now consider
myself as disengaged from all promises of periodical writing. Upon
the whole, I kept it beyond our expectation; nor do I think that
you have been sufficiently astonished by the wonderful effort of the
triple dispatch.</P>
<P>You must now succeed to my task, and I shall expect, during
the winter, a regular political journal of the events of your greater
world. You are on the theatre, and may often be behind the scenes.
You can always see, and may sometimes foresee. My own choice has
indeed transported me into a foreign land; but I am truly attached,
from interest and inclination, to my native country; and even as a
citizen of the world, I wish the stability of England, the sole great
refuge of mankind, against the opposite mischiefs of despotism and
democracy. I was indeed alarmed, and the more so, as I saw that
you were not without apprehension; but I now glory in the triumph
of reason and genuine patriotism, which seems to pervade the coun∣try;
nor do I dislike some mixture of popular enthusiasm, which
may be requisite to encounter our mad or wicked enemies with equal
<PB N="271" REF="295"/>
arms. The behaviour of Fox does not surprise me. You may re∣member
what I told you last year at Lausanne, when you attempted
his defence, that * * * * * * * * * * * * *

You have now crushed the daring subverters of the constitution;
but I now fear the moderate well-meaners, reformers. Do not, I
beseech you, tamper with parliamentary representation. The pre∣sent
house of commons forms, in <HI>practice,</HI> a body of gentlemen, who
must always sympathize with the interests and opinions of the people;
and the slightest innovation launches you, without rudder or com∣pass,
on a dark and dangerous ocean of theoretical experiment. On
this subject I am indeed serious.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I like the beginning of ninety-three better than
the end of ninety-two. The illusion seems to break away through∣out
Europe. I think England and Switzerland are safe. Brabant
adheres to its old constitution. The Germans are disgusted with the
rapine and insolence of their deliverers. The Pope is resolved
to head his armies, and the Lazzaroni of Naples have presented
St. Januarius with a gold fuzee, to fire on the Brigands François.
So much for politics, which till now never had such possession of
my mind. Next post I will write about myself and my own de∣signs.
Alas, your poor eyes! make the Maria write; I will speedily
answer her. My Lady is still dumb. The German posts are now
slow and irregular. You had better write by the way of France,
under cover. Direct to <HI>Le Citoien Rebours à Pontalier, France:</HI>

<P>THERE was formerly a time when our correspondence was a pain∣ful
discussion of my private affairs; a vexatious repetition of
losses, of disappointments, of sales, &amp;c. These affairs are decently
arranged: but public cares have now succeeded to private anxiety,
and our whole attention is lately turned from Lenborough and Be∣riton,
to the political state of France and of Europe. From these
politics, however, one letter shall be free, while I talk of myself and
of my own plans; a subject most interesting to a friend, and only
to a friend.</P>
<P>I know not whether I am sorry or glad that my expedition has
been postponed to the present year. It is true, that I now wish my∣self
in England, and almost repent that I did not grasp the opportu∣nity
when the obstacles were comparatively smaller than they are now
likely to prove. Yet had I reached you last summer before the
month of August, a considerable portion of my time would be now
elapsed, and I should already begin to think of my departure. If
the gout should spare me this winter, (and as yet I have not felt any
symptom,) and if the spring should make a soft and early appearance,
it is my intention to be with you in Downing-street before the end
of April, and thus to enjoy six weeks or two months of the most
agreeable season of London and the neighbourhood, after the hurry
of parliament is subsided, and before the great rural dispersion. As
the banks of the Rhine and the Belgic provinces are completely
overspread with anarchy and war, I have made up my mind to pass
through the territories of the French republic. From the best and
most recent information, I am satisfied that there is little or no real
danger in the journey; and I must arm myself with patience to sup∣port
<PB N="273" REF="297"/>
the vexatious insolence of democratical tyranny. I have even
a sort of curiosity to spend some days at Paris, to assist at the debates
of the Pandaemonium, to seek an introduction to the principal devils,
and to contemplate a new form of public and private life, which
never existed before, and which I devoutly hope will not long con∣tinue
to exist. Should the obstacles of health or weather confine
me at Lausanne till the month of May, I shall scarcely be able to
resist the temptation of passing some part at least of the summer in
my own little paradise. But all these schemes must ultimately de∣pend
on the great question of peace and war, which will indeed be
speedily determined. Should France become impervious to an Eng∣lish
traveller, what must I do? I shall not easily resolve to explore
my way through the unknown language and abominable roads of
the interior parts of Germany, to embark in Holland, or perhaps at
Hamburgh, and to be finally intercepted by a French privateer. My
stay in England appears not less doubtful than the means of trans∣porting
myself. Should I arrive in the spring, it is possible, and
barely possible, that I should return here in the autumn: it is much
more probable that I shall pass the winter, and there may be even a
chance of my giving my own country a longer trial. In my letter
to my Lady I fairly exposed the decline of Lausanne; but such an
establishment as mine must not be lightly abandoned; nor can I dis∣cover
what adequate mode of life my private circumstances, easy as
they now are, could afford me in England. London and Bath have
doubtless their respective merits, and I could wish to reside within a
day's journey of Sheffield-Place. But a state of perfect happiness is
not to be found here below; and in the possession of my library,
house, and garden, with the relicks of our society, and a frequent
intercourse with the Neckers, I may still be tolerably content.
Among the disastrous changes of Lausanne, I must principally
reckon the approaching dissolution of poor Severy and his family.
He is still alive, but in such a hopeless and painful decay, that we
<PB N="274" REF="298"/>
no longer conceal our wishes for his speedy release. I never loved
nor esteemed him so much as in this last mortal disease, which he
supports with a degree of energy, patience, and even cheerfulness,
beyond all belief. His wife, whose whole time and soul are devoted
to him, is almost sinking under her long anxiety. The children are
most amiably assiduous to both their parents, and, at all events, his
filial duties and worldly cares must detain the son some time at
home.</P>
<P>And now approach, and let me drop into your most private ear
a literary secret. Of the Memoirs little has been done, and with
that little I am not satisfied. They must be postponed till a mature
season; and I much doubt whether the book and the Author can
ever see the light at the same time. But I have long revolved in my
mind another scheme of biographical writing: the Lives, or rather
the Characters, of the most eminent Persons in Arts and Arms, in
Church and State, who have flourished in Britain from the reign of
Henry the Eighth to the present age. This work, extensive as it may
be, would be an amusement, rather than a toil: the materials are
accessible in our own language, and, for the most part, ready to my
hands: but the subject, which would afford a rich display of human
nature and domestic history, would powerfully address itself to the
feelings of every Englishman. The taste or fashion of the times
seems to delight in picturesque decorations; and this series of British
portraits might aptly be accompanied by the respective heads, taken
from originals, and engraved by the best masters. Alderman Boy∣dell,
and his son-in-law, Mr. George Nicol, bookseller in Pall∣mall,
are the great undertakers in this line. On my arrival in Eng∣land
I shall be free to consider, whether it may suit me to proceed
in a mere literary work without any other decorations than those
which it may derive from the pen of the Author. It is a serious
truth, that I am no longer ambitious of fame or money; that my
<PB N="275" REF="299"/>
habits of industry are much impaired, and that I have reduced my
studies, to be the loose amusement of my morning hours, the re∣petition
of which will insensibly lead me to the last term of exist∣ence.
And for this very reason I shall not be sorry to bind my∣self
by a liberal engagement, from which I may not with honour
recede.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, we must say a word or two of parliamentary
and pecuniary concerns. 1. We all admire the generous spirit with
which you damned the assassins * *. I hope that * * * * *
The opinion of parliament in favour of Louis was declared in a
manner worthy of the representatives of a great and a wise nation.
It will certainly have a powerful effect; and if the poor King be not
already murdered, I am satisfied that his life is in safety: but in such a
life worth his care? Our debates will now become every day more
interesting; and as I expect from you only opinions and anecdotes,
I most earnestly conjure you to send me Woodfall's Register as often
(and that must be very often) as the occasion deserves it. I now
spare no expence for news.</P>
<P>I want some account of Mrs. G.'s health. Will my Lady
never write? How can people be so indolent! I suppose this will
find you at Sheffield-Place during the recess, and that the heavy
baggage will not move till after the birth-day. Shall I be with you
by the first of May? The Gods only know. I almost wish that
I had accompanied Madame de Stael. Ever yours.</P>

<P>THE struggle is at length over, and poor de Severy is no more!
He expired about ten days ago, after every vital principle had
been exhausted by a complication of disorders, which had lasted
above five months: and a mortification in one of his legs, that gra∣dually
rose to the more noble parts, was the immediate cause of his
death. His patience and even cheerfulness supported him to the
fatal moment; and he enjoyed every comfort that could alleviate his
situation, the skill of his physicians, the assiduous tenderness of his
family, and the kind sympathy not only of his particular friends,
but even of common acquaintance, and generally of the whole town.
The stroke has been severely felt: yet I have the satisfaction to per∣ceive
that Madame de Severy's health is not affected; and we may
hope that in time she will recover a tolerable share of composure and
happiness. Her firmness has checked the violent sallies of grief;
her gentleness has preserved her from the worst of symptoms, a dry,
silent despair. She loves to talk of her irreparable loss, she descants
with pleasure on his virtues; her words are interrupted with tears,
but those tears are her best relief; and her tender feelings will insen∣sibly
subside into an affectionate remembrance. Wilhelm is much
more deeply wounded than I could imagine, or than he expected
himself: nor have I ever seen the affliction of a son more lively and
sincere. Severy was indeed a very valuable man: without any
shining qualifications, he was endowed in a high degree with good
sense, honour, and benevolence; and few men have filled with more
propriety their circle in private life. For myself, I have had the
misfortune of knowing him too late, and of losing him too soon.—
But enough of this melancholy subject.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="301"/>
The affairs of this theatre, which must always be minute, are now
grown so tame and tranquil, that they no longer deserve the histo∣rian's
pen. The new constitution of Geneva is slowly forming,
without much noise or any bloodshed; and the patriots, who have
staid in hopes of guiding and restraining the multitude, flatter them∣selves
that they shall be able at least to prevent their mad countrymen
from giving themselves to the French, the only mischief that would
be absolutely irretrievable. The revolution of Geneva is of less con∣sequence
to us, however, than that of Savoy; but our fate will de∣pend
on the general event, rather than on these particular causes.
In the mean while we hope to be quiet spectators of the struggle of
this year; and we seem to have assurances that both the Emperor and
the French will compound for the neutrality of the Swiss. The Hel∣vetic
body does not acknowledge the republic of France; but Bar∣thelemy,
their ambassador, resides at Baden, and steals, like Chauve∣lin,
into a kind of extra-official negotiation. All spirit of opposi∣tion
is quelled in the Canton of Berne, and the perpetual banishment
of the ****** family has scarcely excited a murmur. It will proba∣bly
be followed by that of ****** *****: the crime alleged in
their sentence is the having assisted at the federation-dinner at Rolle
two years ago; and as they are absent, I could almost wish that they
had been summoned to appear, and heard in their own defence. To
the general supineness of the inhabitants of Lausanne I must ascribe,
that the death of Louis the Sixteenth has been received with less
horror and indignation than I could have wished. I was much
tempted to go into mourning, and probably should, had the Duchess
been still here; but, as the only Englishman of any mark, I was
afraid of being singular; more especially as our French emigrants,
either from prudence or poverty, do not wear black, nor do even
the Neckers. Have you read his discourse for the King? It might
indeed supersede the necessity of mourning. I should judge from
your last letter, and from the Diary, that the French declaration of
<PB N="278" REF="302"/>
war must have rather surprised you. I wish, although I know not
how it could have been avoided, that we might still have continued
to enjoy our safe and prosperous neutrality. You will not doubt
my best wishes for the destruction of the miscreants; but I love
England still more than I hate France. All reasonable chances are
in favour of a confederacy, such as was never opposed to the ambi∣tion
of Louis the Fourteenth; but, after the experience of last year,
I distrust reason, and confess myself fearful for the event. The
French are strong in numbers, activity, enthusiasm; they are rich in
rapine; and, although their strength may be only that of a phrenzy
fever, they may do infinite mischief to their neighbours before they
can be reduced to a strait waistcoat. I dread the effects that may be
produced on the minds of the people by the increase of debt and
taxes, probable losses, and possible mismanagement. Our trade must
suffer; and though projects of invasion have been always abortive, I
cannot forget that the fleets and armies of Europe have failed before
the towns in America, which have been taken and plundered by a
handful of Buccaneers. I know nothing of Pitt as a war minister;
but it affords me much satisfaction that the intrepid wisdom of the
new chancellor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Loughborough.</NOTE> is introduced into the cabinet. I wish, not merely
on your own account, that you were placed in an active, useful
station in government. I should not dislike you secretary at war.</P>
<P>I have little more to say of myself, or of my journey to England:
you know my intentions, and the great events of Europe must deter∣mine
whether they can be carried into execution this summer. If
***** has warmly adopted <HI>your</HI> idea, I shall speedily hear from him;
but, in truth, I know not what will be my answer: I see difficulties
which at first did not occur: I doubt my own perseverance, and my
fancy begins to wander into new paths. The amusement of reading
and thinking may perhaps satisfy a man who has paid his debt to the
public; and there is more pleasure in building castles in the air than
<PB N="279" REF="303"/>
on the ground. I shall contrive some small assistance for your eorre∣spondent,
though I cannot learn any thing that distinguishes him
from many of his countrymen; we have had our full share of poor
emigrants: but if you wish that any thing extraordinary should be
done for this man, you must send me a measure. Adieu. I em∣brace

<P>MY dearest Friend, for such you most truly are, nor does there
exist a person who obtains, or shall ever obtain, a superior
place in my esteem and affection.</P>
<P>After too long a silence I was sitting down to write, when, only
yesterday morning (such is now the irregular slowness of the English
post), I was suddenly struck, indeed struck to the heart, by the fatal
intelligence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The death of Lady Sheffield.</NOTE> from Sir Henry Clinton and Mr. de Lally. Alas! what
is life, and what are our hopes and projects! When I embraced her
at your deparure from Lausanne, could I imagine that it was for
the last time? when I postponed to another summer my journey
to England, could I apprehend that I never, never should see her
again? I always hoped that she would spin her feeble thread
to a long duration, and that her delicate frame would survive
(as is often the case) many constitutions of a stouter appearance.
In four days! in your absence, in that of her children! But she
is now at rest; and if there be a future life, her mild virtues
have surely entitled her to the reward of pure and perfect feli∣city.
It is for you that I feel, and I can judge of your sentiments
by comparing them with my own. I have lost, it is true, an ami∣able
and affectionate friend, whom I had known and loved above
<PB N="280" REF="304"/>
three-and-twenty years, and whom I often styled by the endearing
name of sister. But you are deprived of the companion of your life,
the wife of your choice, and the mother of your children; poor
children! the liveliness of Maria, and the softness of Louisa, render
them almost equally the objects of my tenderest compassion. I do not
wish to aggravate your grief; but, in the sincerity of friendship, I
cannot hold a different language. I know the impotence of reason,
and I much fear that the strength of your character will serve to
make a sharper and more lasting impression.</P>
<P>The only consolation in these melancholy trials to which human
life is exposed, the only one at least in which I have any confidence,
is the presence of a real friend; and of that, as far as it depends on
myself, you shall not be destitute. I regret the few days that must
be lost in some necessary preparations; but I trust that to-morrow
se'nnight (May the fifth) I shall be able to set forwards on my jour∣ney
to England; and when this letter reaches you, I shall be con∣siderably
advanced on my way. As it is yet prudent to keep at a
respectful distance from the banks of the French Rhine, I shall in∣cline
a little to the right, and proceed by Schaffouse and Stutgard to
Frankfort and Cologne: the Austrian Netherlands are now open and
safe, and I am sure of being able at least to pass from Ostend to
Dover; whence, without passing through London, I shall pur∣sue
the direct road to Sheffield-Place. Unless I should meet with
some unforeseen accidents and delays, I hope, before the end of the
month to share your solitude, and sympathize with your grief. All
the difficulties of the journey, which my indolence had probably
magnified, have now disappeared before a stronger passion; and you
will not be sorry to hear, that, as far as Frankfort to Cologne, I shall
enjoy the advantage of the society, the conversation, the German
language, and the active assistance of Severy. His attachment to me
is the sole motive which prompts him to undertake this troublesome
journey; and as soon as he has seen me over the roughest ground,
<PB N="281" REF="305"/>
he will immediately return to Lausanne. The poor young man
loved Lady S. as a mother, and the whole family is deeply affected
by an event which reminds them too painfully of their own misfor∣tune.
Adieu. I could write volumes, and shall therefore break off
abruptly. I shall write on the road, and hope to find a few lines
<HI>à poste restante</HI> at Frankfort and Brussels. Adieu; ever yours.</P>

<P>I MUST write a few lines before my departure, though indeed I

since the first melancholy tidings, without my having received the
slightest subsequent accounts of your health and situation. Your
own silence announces too forcibly how much you are involved in
your feelings; and I can but too easily conceive that a letter to me
would be more painful than to an indifferent person. But that ami∣able
man Count Lally might surely have written a second time; but
your sister, who is probably with you; but Maria,—alas! poor Maria!
I am left in a state of darkness to the workings of my own fancy,
which imagines every thing that is sad and shocking. What can I
think of for your relief and comfort? I will not expatiate on those
common-place topics, which have never dried a single tear; but let
me advise, let me urge you to force yourself into business, as I would
try to force myself into study. The mind must not be idle; if it
be not exercised on external objects, it will prey on its own vitals.
A thousand little arrangements, which must precede a long journey,
have postponed my departure three or four days beyond the term
which I had first appointed; but all is now in order, and I set off
to-morrow, the ninth instant, with my <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> a courier
on horseback, and Severy, with his servant, as far as Frankfort. I

I will try to send you some later intelligence. I never found myself
stronger, or in better health. The German road is now cleared,
both of enemies and allies, and though I must expect fatigue, I
have not any apprehensions of danger. It is scarcely possible

<P>AND here I am in good health and spirits, after one of the easiest,
safest, and pleasantest journies which I ever performed in my

siege of Mayence, at the distance of twenty miles; and long, very
long, will it be heard. It is confessed on all sides, that the French
fight with a courage worthy of a better cause. The town of May∣ence
is strong, their artillery admirable; they are already reduced
to horse-flesh, but they have still the resource of eating the inhabit∣ants,
and at last of eating one another; and, if that repast could
to extended to Paris and the whole country, it might essentially
contribute to the relief of mankind. Our operations are carried
on with more than German slowness, and when the besieged are
quiet, the besiegers are perfectly satisfied with their progress. A

Prussians for courage and discipline is sunk lower than you can pos∣sibly

<PB N="284" REF="308"/>
<P>THE preceding Letters intimate that, in return for my visit to
Lausanne in 1791, Mr. Gibbon engaged to pass a year with
me in England; that the war having rendered travelling exceedingly
inconvenient, especially to a person who, from his bodily infirmities,
required every accommodation, prevented his undertaking so formi∣dable
a journey at the time he proposed.</P>
<P>The call of friendship, however, was sufficient to make him over∣look
every personal consideration, when he thought his presence
might prove a consolation. I must ever regard it as the most en∣dearing
proof of his sensibility, and of his possessing the true spirit
of friendship, that after having relinquished the thought of his in∣tended
visit, he hastened to England, in spite of encreasing impedi∣ments,
to soothe me by the most generous sympathy, and to alle∣viate
my domestic affliction; neither his great corpulency, nor his
extraordinary bodily infirmities, nor any other consideration, could
prevent him a moment from resolving on an undertaking that might
have deterred the most active young man. He, almost immediately,
with alertness by no means natural to him, undertook a great cir∣cuitous
journey, along the frontiers of an enemy, worse than savage,
within the found of their cannon, within the range of the light
troops of the different armies, and through roads ruined by the enor∣mous
machinery of war.</P>
<P>The readiness with which he engaged in this kind office of friend∣ship,
at a time when a selfish spirit might have pleaded a thousand
reasons for declining so hazardous a journey, conspired, with the pe∣culiar
<PB N="285" REF="309"/>
charms of his society to render his arrival a cordial to my
mind. I had the satisfaction of finding that his own delicate and
precarious health had not suffered in the service of his friend, a
service in which he disregarded his own personal infirmities. He
arrived in the beginning of June at my house in Downing-Street,
safe and in good health; and after we had passed about a month to∣gether
in London, we settled at Sheffield-Place for the summer;
where his wit, learning, and cheerful politeness delighted a great
variety of characters.</P>
<P>Although he was inclined to represent his health as better than it
really was, his habitual dislike to motion appeared to increase; his
inaptness to exercise confined him to the library and dining-room,
and there he joined my friend Mr. Frederick North, in pleasant ar∣guments
against exercise in general. He ridiculed the unsettled and
restless disposition that summer, the most uncomfortable, as he said,
of all seasons, generally gives to those who have the free use of their
limbs. Such arguments were little required to keep society within
doors, when his company was only there to be enjoyed; for neither
the fineness of the season, nor the most promising parties of pleasure,
could tempt the company of either sex to desert him.</P>
<P>Those who have enjoyed the society of Mr. Gibbon will agree
with me, that his conversation was still more captivating than his
writings. Perhaps no man ever divided time more fairly between
literary labour and social enjoyment; and hence, probably, he de∣rived
his peculiar excellence of making his very extensive knowledge
contribute, in the highest degree, to the use or pleasure of those with
whom he conversed. He united, in the happiest manner imagin∣able,
two characters which are not often found in the same person,
the profound scholar and the fascinating companion.</P>
<P>It would be superstuous to attempt a very minute delineation of a
character which is so distinctly marked in the Memoirs and Letters.
<PB N="286" REF="310"/>
He has described himself without reserve, and with perfect sincerity.
The Letters, and especially the extracts from the Journal, which could
not have been written with any purpose of being seen, will make the
reader perfectly acquainted with the man.</P>
<P>Excepting a visit to Lord Egremont and Mr. Hayley, whom he
very particularly esteemed, Mr. Gibbon was not absent from Shef∣field-Place
till the beginning of October, when we were reluctantly
obliged to part with him, that he might perform his engagement to
Mrs. Gibbon at Bath, the widow of his father, who had early de∣served,
and invariably retained, his affection. From Bath he pro∣ceeded
to Lord Spenser's at Althorp, a family which he always met
with uncommon satisfaction. He continued in good health during
the whole summer, and in excellent spirits (I never knew him enjoy
better); and when he went from Sheffield-Place, little did I imagine
it would be the last time I should have the inexpressible pleasure of
seeing him there in full possession of health.</P>
<P>The few following short letters, though not important in them∣selves,
will fill up this part of the narrative better, and more agree∣ably,
than any thing I can substitute in their place.</P>

at home in a very agreeable <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> with my friend Elmsley.
Yesterday I dined at Craufurd's with an excellent set, in which were
Pelham and Lord Egremont. I dine to-day with my Portuguese
friend, Madame de Sylva, at Grenier's; most probably with Lady
Webster, whom I met last night at Devonshire-House; a con∣stant,
though late, resort of society. The Duchess is as good, and
Lady Elizabeth as seducing, as ever. No news whatsoever. You
will see in the papers Lord Harvey's memorial. I love vigour, but
it is surely a strong measure to tell a gentleman you have <HI>resolved</HI> to
pass the winter in his house. London is not disagreeable; yet I shall
probably leave it Saturday. If any thing should occur, I will write.
Adieu; ever yours.</P>

My impatience to get away makes me think it better to devote

I am still aukward, though without any suspicions of gout, and
have some idea of having recourse to medical advice. Yet I creep

literally my first going down stairs, and as scarcely any one is ap∣prized

nothing to say. My present lodging, a house of Elmsley's, is cheer∣ful,
convenient, somewhat dear, but not so much as a hotel, a spe∣cies

Had you been stationary at Sheffield, you would have seen me before

that is to say, for your house. But whether I shall have courage to

<P>I MUST at length withdraw the veil before my state of health,
though the naked truth may alarm you more than a fit of the
gout. Have you never observed, through my inexpressibles, a
large prominency <HI>circa genitalia,</HI> which, as it was not at all pain∣ful,
and very little troublesome, I had strangely neglected for
many years? But since my departure from Sheffield-Place it has
<PB N="291" REF="315"/>
increased, (most stupendously,) is increasing, and ought to be dimi∣nished.
Yesterday I sent for Farquhar, who is allowed to be a very
skilful surgeon. After viewing and palping, he very seriously desired
to call in assistance, and has examined it again to-day with Mr. Cline,
a surgeon, as he says, of the first eminence. They both pronounce
it a <HI>hydrocele,</HI> (a collection of water,) which must be let out by the
operation of tapping; but, from its magnitude and long neglect,
they think it a most extraordinary case, and wish to have another
surgeon, Dr. Bayley, present. If the business should go off smoothly,
I shall be delivered from my burthen, (it is almost as big as a small
child,) and walk about in four or five days with a truss. But the
medical gentlemen, who never speak quite plain, insinuate to me
the possibility of an inflammation, of fever, &amp;c. I am not ap∣palled
at the thoughts of the operations, which is fixed for Wednes∣day
next, twelve o'clock; but it has occurred to me, that you might
wish to be present, before and afterwards, till the crisis was past; and
to give you that opportunity, I shall solicit a delay till Thursday, or
even Friday. In the mean while, I crawl about with some labour,
and much indecency, to Devonshire-House (where I left all the fine
Ladies making flannel waistcoats); Lady Lucan's, &amp;c. Adieu.

IMMEDIATELY on receiving the last letter, I went the same day
from Brighthelmstone to London, and was agreeably surprised to
find that Mr. Gibbon had dined at Lord Lucan's, and did not re∣turn
to his lodgings, where I waited for him, till eleven o'clock at
night. Those who have seen him within the last eight or ten
years, must be surprised to hear, that he could doubt, whether
his disorder was apparent. When he returned to England in
1787, I was greatly alarmed by a prodigious increase, which I
always conceived to proceed from a rupture. I did not understand
why he, who had talked with me on every other subject relative to
himself and his affairs without reserve, should never in any shape
hint at a malady so troublesome; but on speaking to his valet de
chambre, he told me, Mr. Gibbon could not bear the least allusion
to that subject, and never would suffer him to notice it. I con∣sulted
some medical persons, who with me supposing it to be a
rupture, were of opinion that nothing could be done, and said that
he surely must have had advice, and of course had taken all ne∣cessary
precautions. He now talked freely with me about his dis∣order;
which, he said, began in the year 1761; that he then con∣sulted
Mr. Hawkins the surgeon, who did not decide whether it was
the beginning of a rupture, or an hydrocele; but he desired to see
Mr. Gibbon again when he came to town. Mr. Gibbon not feel∣ing
any pain, nor suffering any inconvenience, as he said, never
returned to Mr. Hawkins; and although the disorder continued to
increase gradually, and of late years very much indeed, he never
mentioned it to any person, however incredible it may appear, from
1761 to November 1793. I told him, that I had always supposed
there was no doubt of its being a rupture; his answer was, that he
never thought so, and that he, and the surgeons who attended him,
<PB N="293" REF="317"/>
were of opinion that it was an hydrocele. It is now certain that
it was originally a rupture, and that an hydrocele had lately taken
place in the same part; and it is remarkable, that his legs, which had
been swelled about the ankle, particularly one of them, since he
had the erisipelas in 1790, recovered their former shape as soon as
the water appeared in another part, which did not happen till be∣tween
the time he left Sheffield-Place, in the beginning of October,
and his arrival at Althorpe, towards the latter end of that month.
On the Thursday following the date of his last letter, Mr. Gibbon
was tapped for the first time; four quarts of a transparent watery
fluid were discharged by that operation. Neither inflammation nor
fever ensued; the tumour was diminished to nearly half its size; the
remaining part was a soft irregular mass. I had been with him two
days before, and I continued with him above a week after the first
tapping, during which time he enjoyed his usual spirits; and the
three medical gentlemen who attended him will recollect his plea∣santry,
even during the operation. He was abroad again in a few
days, but the water evidently collecting very fast, it was agreed that
a second puncture should be made a fortnight after the first. Know∣ing
that I should be wanted at a meeting in the country, he pressed
me to attend it, and promised that soon after the second operation
was performed he would follow me to Sheffield-Place; but before
he arrived I received the two following Letters:</P>

<P>IT will not be in my power to reach Sheffield-Place quite so soon as

be spent there, and unless some extraordinary temptation should de∣tain
me another day, you will see me by four o'clock Sunday the ninth
of December. I dine to-morrow with the Chancellor at Hampstead,
and, what I do not like at this time of the year, without a proposal to
stay all night. Yet I would not refuse, more especially as I had de∣nied
him on a former day. My health is good; but I shall have a

<P><PB N="295" REF="319"/>
Mr. Gibbon generally took the opportunity of passing a night
or two with his friend Lord Auckland, at Eden-Farm, (ten miles
from London,) on his passage to Sheffield-Place; and notwith∣standing
his indisposition, he had lately made an excursion thither
from London; when he was much pleased by meeting the Arch∣bishop
of Canterbury, of whom he expressed an high opinion. He
returned to London, to dine with Lord Loughborough, to meet
Mr. Burke, Mr. Windham, and particularly Mr. Pitt, with whom
he was not acquainted; and in his last journey to Sussex, he re∣visited
Eden-Farm, and was much gratified by the opportunity of
again seeing, during a whole day, Mr. Pitt, who passed the night
there. From Lord Auckland's, Mr. Gibbon proceeded to Sheffield-Place;
and his discourse was never more brilliant, nor more entertain∣ing,
than on his arrival. The parallels he drew, and the comparisons
he made, between the leading men of this country, were sketched
in his best manner, and were infinitely interesting. However, this
last visit to Sheffield-Place became far different from any he had ever
made before. That ready, cheerful, various, and illuminating con∣versation,
which we had before admired in him, was not now always
to be found in the library or the dining-room. He moved with
difficulty, and retired from company sooner than he had been used
to do. On the twenty-third of December, his appetite began to fail
him. He observed to me, that it was a very bad sign <HI>with him</HI>
when he could not eat his breakfast, which he had done at all times
very heartily; and this seems to have been the strongest expression
of apprehension that the was ever observed to utter. A considerable
degree of fever now made its appearance. Inflammation arose, from
the weight and the bulk of the tumour. Water again collected very
fast, and when the sever went off, he never entirely recovered his ap∣petite
<PB N="296" REF="320"/>
even for breakfast. I became very uneasy indeed at his situation
towards the end of the month, and thought it necessary to advise him
to set out for London. He had before settled his plan to arrive
there about the middle of January. I had company in the house,
and we expected one of his particular friends; but he was obliged
to sacrifice all social pleasure to the immediate attention which his
health required. He went to London on the seventh of January,
and the next day I received the following billet; the last he ever
wrote:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>EDWARD GIBBON Esq. to Lord SHEFFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>ST. JAMES'S-STREET, <DATE>four o'clock, Tuesday.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS date says every thing. I was almost killed between Shef∣field-Place
and East-Grinsted, by hard, frozen, long, and cross
ruts, that would disgrace the approach of an Indian wig-wam.
The rest was something less painful; and I reached this place half∣dead,
but not seriously feverish, or ill. I found a dinner invitation
from Lord Lucan; but what are dinners to me? I wish they did
not know of my departure. I catch the flying post. What
an effort! Adieu, till Thursday or Friday.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="editorial note">
<P>By his own desire, I did not follow him till Thursday the ninth.
I then found him far from well. The tumour more distended than
before, inflamed, and ulcerated in several places. Remedies were
applied to abate the inflammation; but it was not thought proper to
puncture the tumour for the third time, till Monday the 13th of
January, when no less than six quarts of fluid were discharged. He
seemed much relieved by the evacuation. His spirits continued
good. He talked, as usual, of passing his time at houses which he
<PB N="297" REF="321"/>
had often frequented with great pleasure, the Duke of Devon∣shire's,
Mr. Craufurd's, Lord Spenser's, Lord Lucan's, Sir Ralph
Payne's, and Mr. Batt's; and when I told him that I should not re∣turn
to the country, as I had intended, he pressed me to go; know∣ing
I had an engagement there on public business, he said, <Q>you
may be back on Saturday, and I intend to go on Thursday to De∣vonshire-House.</Q>
I had not any apprehension that his life was
in danger, although I began to fear that he might not be restored to
a comfortable state, and that motion would be very troublesome to
him; but he talked of a radical cure. He said, that it was fortunate
the disorder had shewn itself while he was in England, where he might
procure the best assistance; and if a radical cure could not be obtained
before his return to Lausanne, there was an able surgeon at Geneva,
who could come to tap him when it should be necessary.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the fourteenth, when the risk of inflammation and
fever from the last operation was supposed to be over, as the medical
gentlemen who attended him expressed no fears for his life, I went
that afternoon part of the way to Sussex, and the following day
reached Sheffield-Place. The next morning, the sixteenth, I received
by the post a good account of Mr. Gibbon, which mentioned also
that he hourly gained strength. In the evening came a letter by ex∣press,
dated noon that day, which acquainted me that Mr. Gibbon
had had a violent attack the preceding night, and that it was not
probable he should live till I could come to him. I reached his
lodgings in St. James's-street about midnight, and learned that my
friend had expired a quarter before one o'clock that day, the sixteenth
of January 1794.</P>
<P>After I left him on Tuesday afternoon the fourteenth, he saw some
company, Lady Lucan and Lady Spenser, and thought himself well
enough at night to omit the opium draught, which he had been used
to take for some time. He slept very indifferently; before nine the
<PB N="298" REF="322"/>
next morning he rose, but could not eat his breakfast. However, he
appeared tolerably well, yet complained at times of a pain in his sto∣mach.
At one o'clock he received a visit of an hour from Madame
de Sylva, and at three, his friend, Mr. Craufurd, of Auchinames,
(whom he always mentioned with particular regard,) called, and
stayed with him till past five o'clock. They talked, as usual, on
various subjects; and twenty hours before his death, Mr. Gibbon
happened to fall into a conversation, not uncommon with him, on
the probable duration of his life. He said, that he thought himself
a good life for ten, twelve, or perhaps twenty years. About six,
he ate the wing of a chicken, and drank three glasses of Madeira.
After dinner he became very uneasy and impatient; complained
a good deal, and appeared so weak, that his servant was alarmed.
Mr. Gibbon had sent to his friend and relation, Mr. Robert Darell,
whose house was not far distant, desiring to see him, and adding,
that he had something particular to say. But, unfortunately, this
desired interview never took place.</P>
<P>During the evening he complained much of his stomach, and of
a disposition to vomit. Soon after nine, he took his opium draught,
and went to bed. About ten, he complained of much pain, and de∣sired
that warm napkins might be applied to his stomach. He almost
incessantly expressed a sense of pain till about four o'clock in the
morning, when he said he found his stomach much easier. About
seven, the servant asked, whether he should send for Mr. Farquhar?
he answered, no; that he was as well as he had been the day before.
At about half past eight, he got out of bed, and said he was "<HI>plus
adroit</HI>" than he had been for three months past, and got into bed again,
without assistance, better than usual. About nine, he said that he
would rise. The servant, however, persuaded him to remain in bed
till Mr. Farquhar, who was expected at eleven, should come.
Till about that hour he spoke with great facility. Mr. Farquhar
<PB N="299" REF="323"/>
came at the time appointed, and he was then visibly dying. When
the <HI>valet de chambre</HI> returned, after attending Mr. Farquhar out of
the room, Mr. Gibbon said, "<HI>Pourquoi est ce que vous me quittez?</HI>"
This was about half past eleven. At twelve, he drank some brandy
and water from a tea-pot, and desired his favourite servant to stay
with him. These were the last words he pronounced articulately.
To the last he preserved his senses; and when he could no longer
speak, his servant having asked a question, he made a sign, to shew
that he understood him. He was quite tranquil, and did not stir;
his eyes half-shut. About a quarter before one, he ceased to breathe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The body was not opened till the fifth day after his death. It was then sound, except that a degree of mortification, not very considerable, had taken place on a part of the <HI>colon;</HI> which, with the whole of the <HI>omentum,</HI> of a very enlarged size, had descended into the <HI>scrotum,</HI> forming a bag that hung down nearly as low as the knee. Since that part had been inflamed and ulcerated, Mr. Gibbon could not bear a trufs; and when the last six quarts of fluid were discharged, the <HI>colon</HI> and <HI>omentum</HI> descending lower, they, by their weight, drew the lower mouth of the stomach downwards to the <HI>os pubis,</HI> and this probably was the immediate cause of his death.</P>
<P>The following is the account of the appearance of the body, given by an eminent surgeon who opened it:</P><Q><P>Aperto tumore, qui ab inguine usque ad genu se extenderat, observatum est partem ejus inferiorem constare ex tunicâ vaginati testis continenti duas quasi libras liquoris serosi tincti sanguine. Ea autem fuit sacci illius amplitudo ut portioni li∣quoris longè majori capiendae susficeret. In posteriori parte hujus sacci testis situs fuit. Hunc omninò sanum invenimus.</P>
<P>Partem tumoris superiorem occupaverant integrum ferè omentum et major pars intestini coli.

<P>In omento et in intestino colo haud dubia recentis inflammationis signa vidimus, necnon maculas nonnullas lividi coloris hinc inde sparsas.</P>
<P>Aperto abdomine, ventriculum invenimus a naturali suo situ detractum usque ad annulum masculi obliqui externi. Pylorum retrorsùm et quasi sursùm a duodeno retractum.

<P><PB N="300" REF="324"/>
The <HI>valet de chambre</HI> observed, that Mr. Gibbon did not, at any
time, shew the least sign of alarm, or apprehension of death; and
it does not appear that he ever thought himself in danger, unless
his desire to speak to Mr. Darell may be considered in that light.</P>
<P>Perhaps I dwell too long on these minute and melancholy circum∣stances.
Yet the close of such a life can hardly fail to interest every
reader; and I know that the public has received a different and er∣roneous
account of my friend's last hours.</P>
<P>I can never cease to feel regret that I was not by his side at this
awful period: a regret so strong, that I can express it only by
borrowing (as the eloquent Mr. Mason has done on a similar oc∣casion)
the forcible language of Tacitus: <HI>Mihi praeter acerbitatem</HI>
amici <HI>erepti, auget moestitiam quod assidere valetudini, fovere deficien∣tem,
satiari vultu, complexu non contigit.</HI> It is some consolation to
me, that I have not, like Tacitus, by a long absence, anticipated the
loss of my friend several years before his decease. Although I had
not the mournful gratification of being near him on the day he ex∣pired,
yet during his illness I had not failed to attend him with that
assiduity which his genius, his virtues, and, above all, our long, un∣interrupted,
and happy friendship demanded.</P>

<P>MR. Gibbon's Will is dated the 1st of October 1791, just before
I left Lausanne; he distinguishes me, as usual, in the most
flattering manner:</P>
<P><Q>I constitute and appoint the Right Honourable John Lord Shef∣field,
Edward Darell Esquire, and John Thomas Batt Esquire,
to be the Executors of this my last Will and Testament; and as
the execution of this trust will not be attended with much dif∣ficulty

oppressing my heir, by too light or too weighty a testimony of
my gratitude. My obligations to the long and active friendship
of Lord Sheffield, I could never sufficiently repay.</Q></P>
<P>He then observes, that the Right Hon. Lady Eliot, of Port-Eliot,
is his nearest relation on the father's side; but that her three sons
are in such prosperous circumstances, that he may well be excused
for making the two children of his late uncle, Sir Stanier Porten, his
heirs; they being in a very different situation. He bequeaths an∣nuities
to two old servants, three thousand pounds, and his furni∣ture,
plate, &amp;c. at Lausanne, to Mr. Wilhelme de Severy; one
hundred guineas to the poor of Lausanne, and fifty guineas each
to the following persons: Lady Sheffield and daughters, Maria and
Louisa, Madame and Madamoiselle de Severy, the Count de Schom∣berg,
Mademoiselle la Chanoinesse de Polier, and M. le Ministre Le
Vade, for the purchase of some token which may remind them of
a sincere friend. The remains of Mr. Gibbon were deposited in

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="305" REF="327"/>
THE Letters of Mr. Gibbon, from the time of his return to
Switzerland in 1788, are annexed to his Memoirs, as the best con∣tinuation
of them. Among his Letters of an earlier date, I find
several which he has alluded to, and other which will illustrate the
account he has given of himself. These, I flatter myself, will
please the generality of readers; since, when he touches on matters
of private business, even subjects of the driest nature become inte∣resting,
from his mode of treating them. Many Letters from distin∣guished
persons to him will be introduced, and some that he received
at a very early period of life. Although we have not all his own
Letters to which these were answers, yet we have enough to testify
his ambition, even in youth, to be distinguished as a scholar.</P>
<P>It has been sometimes thought necessary to offer to the Public an
apology for the publication of private Letters. I have no scruple to
say, that I publish these, because I think they place my friend in
an advantageous point of view. He might not, perhaps, have ex∣pected

<P>JE ne puis qu'être très sensible aux témoignages d'estime dont vous
voulez bien me combler, quoique je sois fort éloigné de les pren∣dre
à la lettre, et de me regarder comme un oracle. Mais je suis homme
vrai, et par la même qui aime à profiter des lumières que l'on a la
bonté de me communiquer. Ainsi, Monsieur, je reçois avec toute la
satisfaction possible l'ingénieuse conjecture que vous proposez, pour
<PB N="308" REF="329"/>
l'éclaircissement d'un passage de Tite Live sur lequel je m'avois su
qu'être embarassé. J'adopte toutes vos observations, tous vos raison∣nemens.
Par le changement d'une seule lettre, vous substituez à un
sens louche et obscur, une pensée claire, convenable au caractère de
celui qui parle, et bien liée avec tout le reste du discours. Je ne
manquerai pas d'en faire une note, et de me servir de cette judi∣cieuse
correction, si l'occasion s'en présente, en prenant soin d'en
faire honneur à celui à qui je la dois.</P>
<P>J'ajouterai sculement une remarque de peu de conséquence, mais
qui me paroît nécessaire pour donner toute sa perfection à la phrase,
sur laquelle vous avez travaillé si heureusement. Voici la phrase
avec le changement que vous proposez. <HI>Nec esse in vos otio vestro
consultum ab Romanis credatis.</HI> Or <HI>in vos</HI> ne me paroît point s'ac∣corder
avec <HI>otio vestro.</HI> L'expression <HI>in vos</HI> semble marquer quelque
chose qui doit être contraire au bien des Carthaginois, et qui par
conséquence s'allie mal avec l'idée de leur repos. Ainsi au lieu de
ces mots <HI>in vos</HI> j'aimerois mieux lire <HI>in his.</HI> Alors la phrase sera
<PB N="309" REF="330"/>
completement bonne. <HI>Nec esse in his otio vestro consultum ab Romanis
credatis.</HI> <Q>Ne pensez pas que dans ces mesures que prennent les
Romains, pour vous ôter toutes vos forces, et en vous interdisant
la guerre avec l'étranger, ils aient eu pour objet votre tran∣quillité
et votre repos.</Q></P>
<P>Il ne me reste plus, Monsieur, qu'à vous remercier de la bonté
que vous avez eu de me faire part d'une idée aussi heureuse. Ce
seroit une grande joie pour moi si je reçevois souvent de pareils
secours sur tout ce que j'ai donné au public.</P>
<P>J'ai l'honneur d'être, avec bien de la reconnoissance et de respect,

<HEAD>Mr. CREVIER to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <DATELINE>PARIS, <DATE>7th August 1756.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely obliged by your expressions of esteem, without taking
them in the literal sense, and believing myself an oracle. But I am a lover
of truth and sincerity, and always ready to avail myself of the communica∣tions
of my learned friends. With the greatest pleasure, therefore, I received
<PB N="308" REF="329"/>
your ingenious conjecture illustrating a passage of Livy, by which I had
been puzzled. I adopt all your observations and reasonings. By changing
a single letter, you substitute, instead of an aukward and obscure meaning, a
thought perspicuous in itself, suitable to the character of the speaker, and
connected with the purport of his discourse. I shall not fail noticing this
judicious correction, when an opportunity occurs, and mentioning the name
of the person to whom I am indebted for it.</P>
<P>I will add only one remark, of small importance indeed, but necessary for
giving complete correctness to the passage with which your attention has been
so successfully occupied. With your emendation it runs thus: <HI>Nec esse in vos
otio vestro consultum ab Romanis credatis.</HI> The <HI>in vos</HI> does not appear to me
to correspond well with <HI>otio vestro;</HI> since it seems to indicate something
adverse to the interest of the Carthaginians, and therefore does not accord
well with the idea of their tranquillity. Instead of the words <HI>in vos</HI> I would
read <HI>in his;</HI> which would render the passage perfectly correct. <HI>Nec esse
<PB N="309" REF="330"/>
in his otio vestro consultum ab Romanis credatis.</HI> <Q>Do not believe that the
Romans, when they deprive you of your forces, and forbid you to make
war on foreign nations, mean thereby to promote your tranquillity.</Q></P>
<P>It remains only, Sir, that I should thank you for your goodness in com∣municating
to me so happy a thought. It would give me the greatest pleasure
to be frequently favoured with such assistance in my literary labours.</P>
<P>I have the honour to remain, with much gratitude and respect,</P>

<P>À PRESENT queme voilà échappé de l'orage des fonctions publiques
donc cette église est chargée en tems de fête, je saisis avec joie
quelques momens de repos pour m'entretenir, Monsieur, avec vous:
ce sera, s'il vous plait, sans faire de trop grands efforts sur l'article
des idées innées que vous me proposez. Outre que je risquerois de
dire comme je ne sais quelle des interlocutrices de Terence, <HI>Magno
conatu magnas nugas;</HI> il y a fort long tems que je n'ai relu
M. Locke, l'oracle moderne sur cette matière, et il faudroit trop de
tems et de papier pour tout éplucher. Ayez donc la bonté de vous
contenter des premières réflexions qui se présenteront sur quelques
endroits de son premier livre.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="332"/>
Je commence par le chap. i. § 5. où cet habile homme entreprend
de prouver que ces deux principes, <HI>Ce qui est, est; il est impossible
qu'une même chose soit, et en même temps ne soit pas,</HI> ne sont point
innées, puisqu'ils n'étoient point dans l'esprit pendant l'enfance; et
la preuve qu'ils n'y étoient pas, c'est que l'enfant n'y pensoit point,
et que bien des gens meurent, sans les avoir jamais apperçus; <Q>or, dit M. Locke, une idée ne sauroit être dans l'esprit, sans que l'esprit
ne s'en apperçoive,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Il est clair, Monsieur, que toute la force de ce raisonnement, est
dans cette dernière assertion; mais cette assertion n'est elle pas evi∣demment
détruite par l'expérience? Apperçevez vous actuellement
toutes les idées que vous avez dans l'esprit? N'y en a t'il point au∣quelles
vous ne prendrez peutêtre garde de plusieurs années? Et
dans les efforts que l'on fait souvent pour rappeller ce qu'on a confié
à sa mémoire; ne sent on pas qu'il peut y avoir des connoissances si
cachées dans ses replis, que loin de les apperçevoir sans cesse, il faut
bien de la peine pour les rattrapper? Je sais que M. Locke, qui a
<PB N="312" REF="333"/>
senti la difficulté, tache de la résoudre. Ch. iii. § 20. Mais en vé∣rité,
la longueur et l'embarras de cet article montre assez que M. L.
n'étoit par à son aise en l'écrivant; et comment y auroit il été?
Voici, autant que j'en puis juger, à quoi il se réduit. Il avoue, <Q>Que
nous avons dans l'esprit des idées que nous n'apperçevons point
actuellement; mais, dit-il, c'est dans la <HI>mémoire</HI> qu'elles sont: et
cela est si vrai, qu'on ne se les rappelle point sans se souvenir, en
même temps, qu'on les a déjà apperçues. Or, tel n'est point le
cas des <HI>idées</HI> qu'on pretend <HI>innées.</HI> Quand on les apperçoit pour
la première fois, ce n'est point avec réminiscence, comme on de∣vroit,
si ces idées là avoient été dans l'esprit avant cette première
apperception, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>De grâce, Monsieur, croyez vous que M. Locke s'entendit bien
lui même, quand il distinguoit <HI>etre dans l'esprit</HI> et <HI>etre dans la mé∣moire?</HI>
Et qu'importe à la question, qu'on se souvienne d'avoir
déjà su ce que l'on se rappelle, s'il n'en est pas moins vrai qu'on l'a
eu long temps dans l'esprit sans s'en apperçevoir; ce qui est le point
<PB N="313" REF="334"/>
dont il s'agit? Au reste, M. Locke auroit pu sentir que si l'on ne
se <HI>rappelle</HI> point les idées innées par <HI>réminiscence,</HI> e'est qu'elles ne
sont point entrées dans l'esprit d'une manière qui ait exigé, ou attiré
son attention. Et c'est aussi le cas de plusieurs idées acquises; car,
quoiqu'en dire M. Locke, chacun se trouve au besoin, nombre d'idées
qui ne peuvent s'être insinuées dans son esprit, qu'à la présence
de certains objets, auquels il n'a point pris garde, ou, en général,
par des moyens inconnus, qui l'ont enrichi sans qu'il sache com∣ment,
et sans qu'il crût les avoir jusques au moment qu'elles se
sont présentées.</P>
<P>Sur le fond même de la question, il me semble que M. Locke
confond perpétuellement deux choses très différentes. <HI>L'idée elle
même,</HI> qui est une connoissance dans l'esprit et un principe de rai∣sonnement;
et <HI>l'énoncé de cette idée</HI> en forme de proposition, ou de
définition. Il se peut, et il est même très probable, que bien des
gens n'ont jamais formé ou envisagé en eux mêmes cet énoncé,
<PB N="314" REF="335"/>
<HI>il est impossible qu'une chose soit, et ne soit pas en même tems.</HI> Voyez
Liv. 1. ch. i. § 12. Mais suit-il delà, qu'ils ne connoissent pas la
vérité qu'il exprime, et qu'ils n'en ont pas l'idée?—Nullement. Tout
homme qui assure, qui nie, tout homme qui parle, un enfant quand
il demande, quand il refuse, quand il se plaint, &amp;c. ne suppose t'il
pas, que dès qu'une chose est, il est impossible qu'en même tems.
elle ne soit pas? Ne trouvez vous pas, Monsieur, qu'on pourroit
soutenir la réalité des idées innées, précisément sur ce que M. Locke
allégue contre elles, que beaucoup de gens n'ont jamais pensé aux
propositions évidentes dont il parle; car, puisque sans y avoir
pensé, ils s'en servent, ils bâtissent là dessus, ils jugent de la vérité,
ou de l'absurdité d'un discours par ses rapports avec ces principes
là, &amp;c. D'où leur vient cette familiarité avec des principes qu'ils
n'ont jamais appercçus distinctement, si ce n'est de ce qu'ils en ont
une connoissance, ou si l'on veut, un sentiment naturel?</P>
<P>Aux § 17 et 18, M. Locke nei que le consentement que l'on
donne à certaines propositions, dès qu'on les entend prononcer, soit
<PB N="315" REF="336"/>
une preuve que l'idée qu'elles expriment soit innée; et il se fonde,
sur ce qu'il y a bien des propositions que l'on reçoit ainsi d'abord,
qui certainement ne sont point innées; et il en donne divers ex∣emples,
viz. <HI>deux &amp; deux sont quotre,</HI> &amp;c. Mais ne vous paroîtra
t'il pas qu'il confond içi de simples définitions de mots avec des
vérités évidentes par elles mêmes? Au moins, est il certain que
tous ses exemples sont de simples définitions des mots, <HI>deux et deux
sont quatre.</HI> L'idée qu'on exprime par <HI>deux et deux,</HI> est la même
que celle qu'on exprime par <HI>quatre,</HI> &amp;c. Or personne ne dit que
la connoissance d'une définition de mots soit innée, puisqu'elle sup∣pose
celle du langage. Mais cette proposition, <HI>le tout est plus grand
que chacune de ses parties,</HI> n'est point dans ce cas; et il est certain
que le plus petit enfant suppose la vérité de cette proposition
toutes les fois que non content d'une moitié de pomme, il veut la
pomme toute entière.</P>
<P>Prenez la peine, Monsieur, d'examiner le § 23; où M. Locke veut
convaincre de fausseté cette supposition, qu'il y a des principes tel∣lement
<HI>innés,</HI> que ceux qui en entendent pour la première fois, et
<PB N="316" REF="337"/>
qui en comprennent l'énoncé, n'apprennent rien de nouveau. <Q>Pre∣mièrement,
dit-il, il est clair qu'ils ont appris les <HI>termes</HI> de l'énoncé
et la <HI>signification</HI> de ces termes.</Q> Mais qui ne voit que M. Locke
sort de la question? Personne n'a jamais dit que des termes, qui ne
sont que des signes arbitraires de nos idées, fussent innés. Il ajoute,
<Q>Que les idées renfermées dans de pareils énoncés ne naissent pas
plus avec nous, que leurs expressions, et qu'on acquiert ces idées
dans la suite après en avoir appris les noms.</Q> Mais, 1. N'est ce
pas donner pour preuve de ce qu'on affirme, cette affirmation même?
Il n'y a point d'idées innées, car il n'y en a que d'acquises! M.
Locke riroit bien d'un pareil raisonnement, s'il le trouvoit dans ses
adversaires. 2. S'il est vrai qu'on apprend les mots avant que
d'avoir les idées qu'ils expriment, au moins s'il est vrai que cela soit
toujours ainsi, comme M. Locke l'entend, je voudrois bien savoir
comment la première langue a pu être formée? Et même comment
il est possible qu'on fasse comprendre à quelqu'un le sens d'un mot
nouveau pour lui? Tout homme qui n'a nulle idée de <HI>l'ordre,</HI> par
<PB N="317" REF="338"/>
exemple, doit aussi peu être capable d'entendre ce mot <HI>ordre,</HI> qu'un
aveugle né celui de <HI>couleur.</HI></P>
<P>Au § 27, M. Locke nie les idées innées, parcequ'elles ne paroîs∣sent
ni dans les enfans, ni dans les imbécilles, où elles devroient pa∣roître
le plus. Mais, 1. Ceux qui admettent les idées innées, ne les
croyent pas plus naturelles à l'ame, que ses facultes; puis donc que
l'état et la constitution du corps nuit à celles-ci dans les imbécilles,
elle sera aussi cause qu'on ne leur remarque point les autres. 2. Le
fait même n'est pas entièrement vrai; les enfans et les imbécilles ont
l'idée de leur existence, de leur individualité, de leur identité, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Dans le reste de ce §, M. Locke se divertit au depens de ceux qui
croyent que les énoncés des maximes abstraites sont innées: mais les
plus déterminés scholastiques n'ont jamais rien dit de semblable, et il
rit d'une chimère qu'il s'est faite lui même.</P>
<P>Je ne sais, Monsieur, comment il est arrivé qu'au lieu de trois ou
quatre courtes réflexions que j'aurois du vous donner sur tout ceci,
<PB N="318" REF="339"/>
je me suis engagé dans une critique longue et ennuyeuse, de quel∣ques
endroits d'un seul chapitre: c'est apparemment un reste de
lassitude: j'ai trouvé plus de facilité à suivre et à chicaner M. Locke
qu'à penser tout seul. Prenez patience et pardonnez. J'entrevois bien
des choses à dire sur le second chapitre, où il s'agit des principes innés
de pratique; mais je ne vous en fatiguerai qu'après en avoir reçu
l'aveu de vous même.</P>
<P>On écrit içi, que le Roi de Prusse vient de battre les Autrichiens et
de leur tuer 20 mille hommes, en ayant perdu 15 mille des siens.
Voilà donc où il alloit en passant par Leipsic. Si cette nouvelle est
vraie, la guerre ne fauroit manquer de devenir générale, et de l'air
qu'elle commence, elle sera terrible: mais je crains bien que sa M. P.
n'ait le sort de Charles XII. Qui le soutiendra contre la France,
l'Autriche, et peutêtre, la Russie reunies?</P>

<HEAD>Mr. ALLAMAND to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BEX, <DATE>12th September 1756.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER escaping from the tumult of public functions, in which the mi∣nisters
of this church are employed during the holydays, I sit down with
much pleasure to converse with you a few minutes on paper; without intend∣ing
to make any very violent exertion in answering the questions concerning
innate ideas, which you propose for my consideration. I am not willing to
risk the being obliged to say, with one of Terence's characters, <HI>Magno
conatu magnas nugas;</HI> besides, it is long since I looked into Locke, the
modern oracle on that subject; and too much time and paper would be re∣quisite
completely to canvass so intricate a subject. You will have the
goodness, therefore, to be contented with the first reflections that occur to
me on some passages of his first book.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="332"/>
In chapter. i. § 5. that able writer undertakes to prove that the axioms,
<Q>Whatever is, is;</Q> and <Q>It is impossible for the same thing to be and
not to be at the same time;</Q> are not innate; because children are to∣tally
ignorant of them, as appears from their never taking notice of them;
and many persons die without ever perceiving the truth of these axioms;
<Q>but it is impossible,</Q> Mr. Locke observes, <Q>for an idea to be in the
mind, which the mind never takes notice of.</Q> It is plain that the
whole weight of his reasoning rests on this last assertion; which assertion
itself seems to be manifestly contradicted by experience. Do you per∣ceive,
Sir, at this moment all the ideas that are in your mind? Are
there not some of them which you may not, perhaps, take notice of for
many years? In the efforts which we make to recall things to the me∣mory,
are we not sensible that some ideas may be so deeply hidden in its re∣cesses,
that instead of continually perceiving them, we have no small trouble
in bringing them back to our remembrance? I know that Mr. Locke,
<PB N="312" REF="333"/>
c. iii. § 20, endeavours to obviate these objections; but the length and per∣plexity
of that article shews that he was not at ease in writing it. How in∣deed
could he be so? since, as far as I am able to judge, the following is
the result of his argument: <Q>I confess that we have ideas in the mind, of
which we are not conscious; but then these ideas are in the memory; as
appears from this, that we never recall them without remembering that
they formerly were objects of our perception. But this is not supposed to
hold with regard to what are called innate ideas. When these are perceived
for the first time, it is not with reminiscence, which would certainly be the
case if they had been in the mind before this first perception of them,
&amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Be pleased to tell me, Sir, whether you think that Mr. Locke himself will
understood the distinction which he makes between <HI>being in the mind,</HI> and
<HI>being in the memory?</HI> And of what importance is it, that we remember
to have formerly had the recalled ideas, provided it be allowed that we had
<PB N="313" REF="334"/>
them long, without taking any notice of them, which is the point in question?
Besides, Mr. Locke ought to have known that innate ideas are not recalled
with reminiscence, because those ideas come originally into the mind in a
way that neither excites nor requires our attention; for whatever Mr. Locke
may say, every one may be sensible from his own experience, that many
even of his acquired ideas could not have come into his mind independ∣ently
of the presence of certain objects of which he had never taken any
notice; or, in general, independently of certain unknown causes, which
enriched him, without his being sensible of it, with ideas that he did not be∣lieve
himself possessed of, till they actually presented themselves to his un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>As to the main question, Mr. Locke seems to me perpetually to con∣found
two things extremely different; the idea itself, which is a perception
of the mind, and a principle of reasoning; and the expression of that idea
in the form of a proposition or definition. It is possible, nay, very probable,
that many persons have never formed, or thought of the proposition, <Q>It
<PB N="314" REF="335"/>
is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time.</Q>
See Locke, b. i. c. 1. § 12. But does it follow from this, that they are
ignorant of the truth expressed by these words? By no means. Every
man who affirms, denies, or speaks; a child who asks, refuses, or complains,
must know the truth of this proposition. Does it not appear to you, Sir,
that the doctrine of innate ideas may be defended on the same principle by
which Mr. Locke attacks it; namely, that many persons have never thought
of the propositions or descriptions by which they are expressed? For if with∣out
ever having thought of those propositions, they make use of them in
their reasonings, and employ them in judging of the justness or absurdity of
every discourse which they hear, how could they be so familiar with prin∣ciples
which they never distinctly took notice of, unless they had a natural
knowledge or innate perception of them?</P>
<P>In paragraphs 17 and 18, Mr. Locke denies that our consenting to certain
propositions at first hearing them, is a proof that the ideas expressed by them
<PB N="315" REF="336"/>
are innate; since many propositions, thus assented to, evidently express
ideas that had been acquired, for example, <HI>two and two make four,</HI> &amp;c.
But does it not appear to you, that he here confounds the definition of words
with self-evident truths? at least, all the examples which he gives are mere
definitions. The idea expressed by <HI>two and two</HI> is precisely the same with
the idea of <HI>four.</HI> Nobody says that our knowledge of the definitions of
words is innate, because that would imply language to be so. But the
knowledge of this truth, that the whole is greater than its part, does not
imply that supposition, since an infant shews itself acquainted with this
principle, when, dissatisfied with the half of an apple, it indicates its desire
to possess the whole.</P>
<P>Take the trouble, Sir, to examine § 23; in which Mr. Locke endeavours
to disprove the assertion, that there are some principles so truly innate, that
those who hear them expressed in words for the first time, immediately com∣prehend
<PB N="316" REF="337"/>
them without learning any thing new. <Q>First of all,</Q> he observes,
<Q>it is clear they must have learned the terms of the expression, and the
meaning of those terms.</Q> But here Mr. Locke manifestly departs from
the question. Nobody says that words, which are merely arbitrary signs of
our ideas, are innate. He adds, <Q>that the ideas denoted by these expressions
are no more born with us than the expressions themselves, and that we ac∣quire
the ideas after first learning the terms by which they are expressed.</Q>
But, 1. Is not this to take for granted the thing to be proved? There are
no innate ideas, for all ideas are acquired. Mr. Locke would laugh at his
adversaries, were they to make use of such an argument. 2. If words are
learned before ideas, at least if that is always the case, as Mr. Locke un∣derstands
it to be, I would be glad to know how the first language could
have been formed, or how it could be possible to communicate to any one
the meaning of a word altogether new to him? A person who had no idea
<PB N="317" REF="338"/>
of order, for example, would be no more capable of understanding the word
order, than a man born blind could understand the word colour.</P>
<P>In paragraph 27, Mr. Locke denies innate ideas, because they are not
found in children and idiots, in whom we ought most to expect meeting
with them. I answer, 1. Those who admit innate ideas, do not believe
them more natural to the mind than its faculties; and as the state and con∣stitution
of the body disturbs the faculties of idiots, the same cause may
hinder them from showing any signs of innate ideas. 2. The fact is not
strictly true. Even idiots and infants have the idea of their existence, in∣dividuality,
identity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the remainder of that paragraph, Mr. Locke diverts himself with the
absurdity of those who believe the expressions of abstract maxims to be in∣nate;
but the most determined scholastic never maintained any such opinion;
and he combats a chimera which is the work of his own fancy.</P>
<P>I know not how it has happened that, instead of a few general reflections
which I intended, I have sent you a long and tiresome criticism on some
<PB N="318" REF="339"/>
passages of a single chapter. The remains of lassitude, probably, made it
easier for me to follow and dispute with Mr. Locke, than to think and
reason alone. Have patience, and pardon me. There are many remarks
to make on the second chapter where he treats of innate practical principles.
But I will not tire you with that subject, unless you desire it.</P>
<P>Our newspapers say, that the King of Prussia has beat the Austrians, and
killed twenty thousand of their men; with the loss of fifteen thousand of his
own. This was the object he had in view when he passed through Leipsick.
If the news be true, the war must become general; and, according to ap∣pearances,
it will be terrible. But I much fear lest his Prussian Majesty
meet with the fate of Charles XII. What are his resources for defence
against the united strength of France and Austria, and perhaps of Russia?</P>
<P>I have the honour to be, with the most perfect consideration, yours, &amp;c.</P>

<P>JE suis charmé de l'exactitude et de la pénétration qui se disputent
le terrein dans la dernière lettre que vous avez pris la peine de
m'écrire: et comme vous, Monsieur, je crois que la question touche
à sa décision.</P>
<P>Vous avez sans doute raison de dire que les propositions évidentes
dont il s'agit, ne sont pas de simples idées, mais des jugemens. Mais
ayez aussi la complaisance de reconnoître que M. Locke les alleguant
en exemple d'idées qui passent pour innées et qui ne le sont pas selon
lui, s'il y a içi de la méprise, c'est lui qu'il faut relever là-dessus, et
non pas moi, qui n'avois autre chose à faire qu'à refuter sa manière
de raisonner contre l'innéïté de ces idées, ou jugmens là. D'ailleurs,
Monsieur, vous remarquerez, s'il vous plait, que dans cette dispute
il s'agit en esset, de savoir si certaines vérités évidentes et com∣munes,
et non pas seulement certaines idées simples, sont innées ou
<PB N="320" REF="341"/>
non. Ceux qui affirment, ne donnent guère pour exemple d'idées
simples qui le soyent, que celles de Dieu, de l'unité, et de l'existence:
les autres exemples sont pris de propositions completes, que vous
appellez jugemens.</P>
<P>Mais, dites vous, y aura t'il donc des jugemens innés? Le juge∣ment
est il autre chose qu'un acte de nos facultés intellectuelles dans
la comparaison des idées? Le jugement sur les vérités évidentes,
n'est il pas une simple vue de ces vérités là, un simple coup d'oeil que
l'esprit jette sur elles? J'accorde tout cela. Et de grace, qu'est ce
qu'<HI>idée?</HI> N'est ce pas <HI>vue,</HI> ou coup d'oeil, si vous voulez? Ceux
qui définissent l'idée autrement, ne s'éloignent ils pas visiblement du
sens et de l'intention du mot? Dire que les idées sont les especes
des choses imprimées dans l'esprit, comme l'image de l'objet sensible
tracée dans l'oeil, n'est ce pas jargonner plutôt que définir? Or c'est
la faute, qu'ont fait tous les metaphysiciens, et quoique M. Locke
l'ait bien sentie, il a mieux aimé se fâcher contre eux, et tirer contre
les girouettes de la place, que s'appliquer à démêler ce galimatias.

Que n'a-t'il dit: non seulement il n'y a point d'idées innées dans le
sens de ces Messieurs; mais il n'y a point d'idées du tout dans ce sens
là: toute idée est un acte, une vue, un coup d'oeil de l'esprit.
Dès lors demander s'il y a des idées innées, c'est demander s'il y a
certaines vérités si évidentes et si communes que tout esprit non
stupide puisse naturellement, sans culture et sans maître, sans dis∣cussion,
sans raisonnement, les reconnoître d'un coup d'oeil, et sou∣vent
même sans s'apperçevoir qu'on jette ce coup d'oeil. L'affirma∣tive
me paroît incontestable, et selon moi, le question est vuidée
par là.</P>
<P>Maintenant prenez garde, Monsieur, que cette manière d'entendre
l'affaire, va au but des partisans des idées innées, tout comme la
leur; et par la même, contredit M. Locke dans le sien. Car pour∣quoi
voudroit on qu'il y eu des idées innées? C'est pour en opposer
la certitude et l'évidence au doute universel des sceptiques, qui est
ruiné d'un seul coup, s'il y a des vérités dont la vue soit nécessaire
et naturelle à l'homme. Or vous sentez, Monsieur, que je puis
<PB N="322" REF="343"/>
leur dire cela dans ma façon d'expliquer la chose, tout aussi bien que
les partisans ordinaires des idées innées dans la leur. Et voilà ce
qui semble incommoder un peu M. Locke, qui, sans se declarer
pyrrhonien, laisse apperçevoir un peu trop de foible pour le pyrrho∣nisme,
et a beaucoup contribué à le nourrir dans ce siècle. A
force de vouloir marquer les bornes de nos connoissances, ce qui
étoit fort nécessaire, il a quelquefois tout mis en bornes.</P>
<P>Après ces remarques générales sur le fond de la question, il est peu
nécessaire de s'arrêter à quelques particulières, où vous ne me croyez
pas fondé. Cependant vous me permettrez de vous faire observer
sur celles que vous relevez: 1. Que dans ce § 5. du ch. 1. il est
bien vrai que M. Locke mêle ces deux choses, être actuellement dans
l'esprit, <HI>sans que l'esprit s'en apperçoive</HI>—et, y être, <HI>sans qu'il s'en soit
jamais apperçu.</HI>—Mais il est certain aussi, qu'à la conclusion de ce §,
il s'en tient au premier incognito, et donne lieu à ma critique en
s'exprimant en ces termes. Je suis la traduction Françoise n'ayant
pas l'original. <Q>De sorte, dit-il, que soutenir qu'une chose soit
dans l'entendement, et qu'elle n'est pas conçue par l'entendement,
<PB N="323" REF="344"/>
qu'elle est dans l'esprit, sans que l'esprit l'apperçoive, c'est autant
que si l'on disoit, qu'une chose est, et n'est pas dans l'esprit ou
dans l'entendement.</Q> N'est il pas clair, Monsieur, que ce grand
philosophe, écrivant cela, étoit dans l'erreur, ou la méprise de fait
que je prends la liberté de lui reprocher; c'est que l'esprit ne peut
avoir aucune connoissance qu'il ne l'apperçoive actuellement? Je
crois bien que si on l'avoit d'abord relevé là-dessus il auroit senti
sa méprise, mais il n'en est pas moins vrai, et qu'il y est tombé,
et qu'il s'en fait un principe contre ses adversaires.</P>
<P>2. Vous voulez qu'on lui passe sa distinction entre les idées qui
<HI>sont dans l'esprit</HI> et celles qui sont <HI>dans la mémoire:</HI> à moi ne tienne,
pourvu que vous preniez le mot d'idée comme moi; car, en ce sens,
une idée est dans l'esprit, lorsque l'esprit envisage actuellement la
proposition qui est l'objet de son idée, ou de son coup d'oeil; et
elle n'est que dans la mémoire, lorsque l'esprit ayant auparavant jetté
ce coup d'oeil sur elle, en a plus de facilité à la réitérer, et en le
réitérant, sent que ce n'est pas la première fois qu'il envisage cette
<PB N="324" REF="345"/>
proposition là.—Mais si par idées, vous entendez ces <HI>especes</HI> chi∣mériques,
supposées par les métaphysiciens, et autant qu'il m'en
souvient, pas assez nettement congédiées par M. Locke, j'en re∣viens,
s'il vous plait, à ma prétension, qu'on ne s'entend pas soi
même quand on distingue la mémoire de l'esprit.</P>
<P>Un violent mal de tête que j'ai apporté de notre vénérable classe,
ne me permet pas d'étendre davantage cette lettre, et m'empêche
de la faire moins courte et plus nette. Je vous prie, Monsieur, de
l'excuser telle qu'elle est. Peut être, pénétrant comme vous l'êtes,
ne laisserez vous pas d'y entrevoir dequoi prévenir toute difficulté
sur les principes innés de pratique: M. Locke me paroît plus fort
içi que sur les autres, mais il n'a pas laissé de s'y embarasser un
peu par-ci par-là.</P>
<P>Je me faisois une fête de vous voir un moment à Vevay, et j'ai
été capot d'être <HI>disappointed;</HI> si j'entends ce mot de votre langue,
le notre n'en a point qui peut dire si bien la même chose. Je n'ai

Si la marche de 120 mille Russes n'est pas une fable, que va

<HEAD>Mr. ALLAMAND to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BEX, <DATE>October 12, 1756.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am delighted with your last letter, equally distinguished by accuracy and
penetration; and with you, Sir, I believe that the question approaches to
its decision.</P>
<P>You are right in saying, that the self-evident propositions, which I men∣tioned,
are not merely ideas, but judgments: yet you will have the good∣ness
to observe, that Mr. Locke having given them as examples of ideas
which pass for being innate, but which he does not regard as such, the mis∣take
is chargeable on him, and not on me, who had nothing farther to do
than to refute his manner of reasoning. Besides, you will be pleased to re∣mark,
that the real question is, whether not only certain ideas, but also
<PB N="320" REF="341"/>
certain common and self-evident propositions be innate. The only ex∣amples
produced of innate ideas are those of God, unity, and existence;
the other examples are of innate propositions, which you call judgments.</P>
<P>You ask, whether it be possible that our judgments should be innate,
judgment being nothing else but the act of our intellectual faculties in
comparing our ideas, and our judgment concerning self-evident truths
being merely the perception of those truths by a simple glance of the
mind? I grant all that, but would ask, what else is an idea but a glance of
the mind? Those who define it otherwise, widely depart from the original
sense of the word; and talk unintelligibly, when they say that ideas are
species; that is, appearances of things impressed on the mind, as the images
of corporeal objects are impressed on the eye. All metaphysicians have
committed this mistake; and Mr. Locke, though sensible of it, has chosen
in his anger to direct his batteries against the weathercocks, rather than
against the building itself. According to the meaning of these metaphysicians,
<PB N="321" REF="342"/>
there are surely no innate ideas, because in their sense of the word there are no
ideas whatever. An idea is merely an act or perception of the mind: and
the question concerning innate ideas is merely to determine, whether certain
truths be not so common and so evident, that every mind, not absolutely
stupid, must recognize them at a single glance, without the assistance of any
teacher, and without the intervention of any discussion or reasoning; and
often without being sensible that this glance is cast on them? The affirm∣ative
appears to me incontrovertible; and the question thereby is solved.</P>
<P>You will please to remark, that this way of explaining the matter is as
favourable to innate ideas, and therefore as opposite to Mr. Locke's doctrine,
as the unintelligible hypothesis above mentioned. For what reason do we
contend in favour of innate ideas? To oppose evidence and certainty to
universal scepticism; whose cause is ruined by proving certain truths to be
so necessary and so natural to man, that they are universally recognized by
a single glance. This may be proved according to my meaning of the word
<PB N="322" REF="343"/>
idea, as well as according to the sense in which this word is vulgarly taken,
and the proof would not have been very pleasing to Mr. Locke, who, with∣out
professing himself a sceptic, yet shews a leaning to the sceptical side;
and whose works have contributed much to the diffusion of scepticism in the
present age. His too eager desire of fixing the limits of human knowledge,
a thing highly necessary, has made him leave nothing but limits.</P>
<P>After these general observations on the main question, it is not very ne∣cessary
to descend to the particulars in which you think me mistaken. Yet
you will permit me to answer your objections. 1. It is true, that Mr. Locke,
§ 5. c. 1. joins the two expressions, <Q>being in the mind, without being actu∣ally
perceived by the mind,</Q> and <Q>being in the mind, without having ever
been perceived by the mind;</Q> but at the conclusion of the paragraph he lays
himself open to my criticism, by expressing himself as follows: <Q>So that to
be in the understanding and not to be understood, to be in the mind and
<PB N="323" REF="344"/>
never to be perceived, is all one as to say, any thing is and is not in the
mind or understanding.</Q> It is clear, Sir, that this great philosopher
erred in writing this passage; maintaining, what I took the liberty to con∣tradict,
that nothing could be in the understanding without being perceived
to be there. I doubt not that he would have corrected this mistake had it
been pointed out to him; but the certainly falls into it, and employs it as a
principle of reasoning against his adversaries.</P>
<P>2. You think that we ought to admit his distinction between <Q>ideas in the
mind,</Q> and <Q>ideas in the memory.</Q> I admit the distinction with all my
heart, provided you take the word idea in the same acceptation as I do. In that
sense an idea is in the mind, when the mind actually considers the proposition
which is the object of its idea, that is, of its glance or perception; and an
idea is in the memory when the mind, having formerly cast that glance on
it, finds thereby a greater facility in recalling it, remembering at the same
time that it formerly was the object of its perception. But if you understand
<PB N="324" REF="345"/>
by ideas these chimerical species, the mere fictions of metaphysicians, and,
as it seems to me, not sufficiently disproved by Mr. Locke, I return to my
assertion, and maintain that the distinction is unintelligible between <Q>being
in the mind,</Q> and <Q>being in the memory.</Q></P>
<P>A violent headach, which I brought with me from our venerable class,
hinders me from continuing this letter, or rendering what I have already written
shorter and more perspicuous. I intreat you to excuse its imperfections.
Your penetration will perhaps discern how all difficulties may be solved con∣cerning
innate practical principles. Mr. Locke treats this subject better than
he does the others; but in several parts he is somewhat puzzled.</P>
<P>I rejoiced at the hopes of seeing you for a moment at Vevay, and was
surprised at being <HI>disappointed.</HI> If I rightly understand this word of your
language, it cannot be well translated into ours. I met with Mr. Pavillard
only in the assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="346"/>
If the march of an hundred and twenty thousand Russians is not a fable,
what must become of the King of Prussia? Does it not appear to you,
that we are threatened with great revolutions? I have long suspected a de∣sign
of reducing the general system of Europe to three great empires; that
of the French on the west of the Rhine, of Austria on the east, and of
Russia in the north. Yet we read of nothing of this kind in the Revelation.
But let the world be divided as it may, provided it be lawful for us to believe
that <Q>whatever is, is;</Q> and <Q>that two contradictory propositions can∣not
both at the same time be true.</Q> Those three empires will be great
only when measured on this earth; viewed but from the moon, they will be
small enough; and how far do philosophical eyes soar beyond that luminary!</P>
<P>I have the honour to be, with much consideration, yours, &amp;c. ALLAMAND.</P>
<Q><P>Mr. de N * * * writes to me that things go better and better, now
that his niece Madame D. is extremely ill; and that 200,000
men are ready to cut one another's throats at the rate of five <HI>sous</HI>

<P>EQUIDEM Davus sum, non Oedipus; dicam tamen quid de dubiis
e Justino propositis locis mihi videatur.</P>
<P>1. JUSTINUS, libr. ii. c. 3. <HI>His igitur Asia per mille quingentos
annos vectigalis fuit. Pendendi tributi finem Ninus rex Assyriorum im∣posuit.</HI>
Adeo manifestus est calculi error, ut mirum videri possit,
hanc lectionem unquam fuisse a quoquam in textum receptam; ita
enim Ninus Sesostre mille quingentis annis inferior esset aetate.
Orosius, qui Justinum per compendium summa cum fide expressit,
haec in hunc modum commemorat. Lib. i. c. 14. <HI>Universam quoque
Aegyptum (Scythoe) populassent; nisi paludibus impediti, repulsi fuissent.
Inde continuo reversi, perdomitam infinitis coedibus Asiam vectigalem
fecere: ubi per</HI> 15 <HI>annos sine pace immorati, tandem uxorum flagitatione
<PB N="327" REF="348"/>
revocantur, denunciantium, ni redeant, sobolem se a finitimis quaesituras.</HI>
Dubium ergo nullum est, quin pro MD. substituendum sit XV.
Tu inquiris in causam erroris satis argutè. Sed non potest habere
locum illa tua emendatio, <HI>per mille</HI> in <HI>permissa,</HI> si quidem notis
arithmeticis, quod admodum probabile est, in antiquis libris numeri
fuerunt expressi.</P>
<P>2. JUSTIN. libr. xii. c. 8. <HI>Itaque coesis hostibus, cum gratulatione
in eadem</HI> (castra) <HI>reverterunt.</HI> Frustra mihi sollicitare videris lec∣tionem
receptam: gratis enim a te assumitur quod Cuphites ne qui∣dem
aggredi fuerint ausi. Alia te docebit fidus <HI>Justini</HI> interpres
Orosius, lib. iii. cap. 19. <HI>Cumque ad Chosides ventum esset, ibi contra
CC millia equitum hostium pugnam CONSERUERUNT; et cum tam aetate
detriti, animo aegri, viribus lassi, difficile VICISSENT, castra ob memoriam
plus solito magnifica condiderunt.</HI> Itaque non priusquam manus con∣seruissent,
<PB N="328" REF="349"/>
nonnisi post hostes devictos ac caesos, in castra reverterunt.
Quid quod ipse Justinus idem haud obscurè innuit, quum ait:
<HI>Motus his tam justis precibus, velut in finem VICTORIAE, castra fieri
jussit quorum molitionibus et hostis TERRERETUR.</HI> Quod si vero statuas,
Macedonum exercitum infinitis Cuphitarum copiis territum a proelio
abstinuisse, atque hoc timore perculsum reditum maturandum esse
censuisse, nae ego non intelligo, quo sensu Justinus dixerit: <HI>Castra
posuisse velut in finem VICTORIAE: posuisse eadem solito magnificen∣tiora
ut hostis TERRERETUR: et cum GRATULATIONE in eo revertisse.</HI>
Ubi et hoc contra Sebisii emendationem notari velim, formulam illam
loquendi <HI>CUM GRATULATIONE</HI> alterum illud, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>caesis
hostiis,</HI> jam comprehendere. Adeoque illa tua emendatio <HI>omissis
hostibus</HI> et ab historiae fide et à Justini sententia multum abludit.</P>
<P>3. JUSTIN. lib. xxiii. c. 8. <HI>Terrae motu portio montis abrupta
Gallorum stravit exercitum, et confertissimi cunei, non sine vulneribus
hostium, dissipati ruebant.</HI> Ne te offendat durior, quae tibi videtur
<PB N="329" REF="350"/>
trajectio vocis <HI>hostium</HI> qua cum <HI>confertissimi cunei,</HI> conjungendam
censes, atque intelligis de cuneis hostium, sive Gallorum, militaribus.
Atque tu, re rite expensa, cognosces, nullam hic trajectionem locum
habere, sed omnia naturali ordine fluere: tantum <HI>cuneos</HI> exponas,
non per cohortes hostium militares, sed per <HI>moles conglobatas</HI> a monte
ac rupe avulsas, quae non <HI>confertim,</HI> sed postquam praecipiti cursu in
<HI>cuneos</HI> dissiluissent, <HI>dissipatae ruebant non sine vulneribus hostium,</HI> h. e.
<HI>Gallorum.</HI> Ita perspecta erit ac manifesta ratio, cur illud <HI>hostium</HI>
cum <HI>consertissimi cunei</HI> nec possit, nec debeat conjungi: ne scilicet
perperam ad cuneos militares traheretur, adeoque ad vitandam
omnem sermonis ambiguitatem.</P>
<P>4. JUSTIN. lib. xxviii. c. 2. <HI>Adversus Gallos urbem eos suam
tueri non potuisse: captamque non ferro defendisse, sed auro redemisse.</HI>
Si quidem iste locus medicam manum postularet aut admitteret, non
est altera qua uterer libentius quam tua, qua pro <HI>captamque</HI> restituis
<HI>capitoliumque.</HI> Et frustra Schefferus hic scrupulos movet quasi inep∣tum
fuerit dicere, <HI>captam</HI> urbem <HI>ferro defendi</HI> potuisse: id enim,
<PB N="330" REF="351"/>
quamvis ignave, factum fuisse memorant historici Romani uno quasi
convitio: in illis <HI>Orosius,</HI> lib. ii. c. 19. <HI>Patentem Galli urbem pene∣trant:</HI>
en captam urbem Romam! Universam reliquam juven∣tutem
<HI>in arce Capitolini Montis latitantem OBSIDIONE concludunt:
ubique infelices reliquias, fame, peste, desperatione, formidine tenent, sub∣igunt,</HI>
&amp;c. Vides urbe jam capta, defensioni tamen locum super∣fuisse;
neque profecto redimi urbem opus fuisset, nisi jam in
hostium potestate, <HI>h. e.</HI> capta fuisset. Non videris de eo emenda∣tionis
tuae incommodo cogitasse, quod capitolium solum auro fuisse
redemptum affirmaret, contra historiae fidem.</P>
<P>5. <HI>JUSTIN. lib. xxxi. c.</HI> 1. Legati primum a senatu Romano missi,
ut Antiocho Syriae regi persuaderent, ne bello invadat eas Caele-Syriae
civitates, quas Aegyptii priore bello occuparant, quae proinde Aegyptii
juris fuerunt, hoc usi sunt argumento, quod hae civitates ad regem
<HI>pupillum</HI> pertinerent, <HI>fidei suae traditum. Atque etiam supra Jus∣tinus,
lib. xxx. c.</HI> 3. <HI>memorat:</HI> Mittitur et M. Lepidus in Aegyptum,
<PB N="331" REF="352"/>
qui tutorio nomine regnum pupilli administret. <HI>Altera deinde legatio,
quae supervenit, postquam Antiochus has civitates in potestatem
suam jam redegerat, postulans, ut</HI> illae in integrum restituantur, omissa
pupilli persona, <HI>nunc alio praetextu utitur, nimirum quod istae civi∣tates</HI>
jure belli factae <HI>sint</HI> populi Romani. <HI>Quid</HI> jus belli <HI>sit, quatenus
ab ipso bello, sive eo quod bello partum est, distinguitur, declarabo
duobus locis Livii; altero ex Quinti Flaminini ad Nabidem oratione,
lib. xxxiv. c.</HI> 32. Quibus igitur amicitia violatur? nempe his duabus
rebus maxime: si socios meos pro hostibus habeas: si cum hostibus te con∣jungas.
Utrum non a te factum est? nam et Messenen uno atque
eodem jure faederis, quo et Lacedaemonem in amicitiam nostram ac∣ceptam,
socius ipse sociam nobis urbem vi atque armis cepisti: et cum
Philippo hoste nostro societatem... pepigisti. <HI>Altero Flori, lib. iii. c. v.</HI>
Quippe rex non jam quasi alienam, sed quia amiserat, quasi raptam,
<PB N="332" REF="353"/>
jure belli repetebat. <HI>Ut taceam illud</HI> jure belli <HI>ad utrumque, potiore
tamen sensu ad</HI> jubebat restitui in integrum <HI>referri posse; statim enim
subjicit: abnuenti bellum denunciatum.</HI></P>
<P>6. JUSTIN. libr. xxxi. c. 1. <HI>Igitur Senatus scripsit Flaminino,
si ei videatur, sicuti Macedoniam a Philippo, ita Graeciam a Nabide
liberet.</HI> Quid de gloria Flaminini ducis belli Macedonici statu∣endum
sit, docet formula S. C. apud Livium, lib. xxxiii. c. 32.
<HI>S. P. Q. R. et L. Quintius Imp. Philippo rege, Macedonibusque DEVIC∣TIS,
liberos, immunes suis legibus esse jubet Corinthios,</HI> &amp;c. Et Florus,
lib. ii. c. xii. <HI>Successerat Philippo filius Perses, qui SEMEL IN PERPE∣TUUM
VICTAM esse Macedoniam non putabat ex gentis dignitate.</HI>
Quaeritur jam an Quintius, qui Macedoniam vicit, ullo sensu dici
possit <HI>Macedoniam a Philippo liberasse,</HI> quamvis deinde ipsa Macedonia
<PB N="333" REF="354"/>
Philippo non fuerit adempta: et si Nabidem pari modo vinceret, an
non hoc ipso Graeciam liberasse censendus sit? At vero omnem rem
explicasse videtur ipse Justinus, qui, libr. xxx. cap. ult. haec habet:
<HI>Sed Macedonas Romana fortuna vicit: fractus itaque bello Philippus,
pace a Flaminino Cos. petita, nomen quidem regium retinuit; sed omnibus
Graeciae urbibus, velut REGNI (MACEDONICI) MEMBRIS, extra terminos
antiquae possessionis, amissis, SOLAM Macedoniam retinuit.</HI> In literis,
ergo, Senatus Rom. ad Cos. Flamininum per <HI>Macedoniam</HI> significatur,
non tantum Macedonia stricte sic dicta, et antiquis terminis com∣prehensa,
quae sola Philippo non fuit adempta; sed in primis ea
Graeciae pars (istae urbes), quae <HI>extra terminos antiquae possessionis,</HI>
veluti <HI>regni</HI> Macedonici <HI>membra</HI> accesserant, quaeque sub Philippo
ad Macedonicum regnum pertinebant; quibus, in senatus literis,
opponitur Graecia reliqua, a Nabide tentata, quae hactenus imperio
Macedonico nunquam fuerat subjecta. Hinc Senatus Rom. sen∣tentia
isthaec fuerit: sicuti Macedoniam a Philippo, ita <HI>reliquam</HI>
Graeciam a Nabide liberet. Vel, sicuti partem Graeciae, quae ad
<PB N="334" REF="355"/>
Macedoniam pertinebat a Philippo, ita nunc universam pene Graeciam
a Nabide liberet.</P>

locum habere, si, intactis hostibus, castra movere ac discedere fuerat

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 22, 1756.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am Davus, not Oedipus, I will give you my opinion concern∣ing
the difficulties in Justin, which you propose for my consideration.</P>
<P>1. In the third chapter of his second book he says, <Q>That Asia was tri∣butary
fifteen centuries to the Scythians, and that Ninus put an end to
those contributions.</Q> The number of years is so manifestly erroneous,
that it is astonishing such a reading should ever have been admitted into the
text; for it makes Ninus later than Sesostris by a period of fifteen hundred
years. Orosius, who abridged Justin with the greatest fidelity, speaks to the
following purpose: <Q>The Scythians would have ravished the whole of
Egypt, had they not been prevented by the marshes. When they re∣turned
from that country, they made a bloody conquest of Asia, and ren∣dered
it tributary. Having remained there fifteen restless years, they at
<PB N="327" REF="348"/>
length returned home, at the earnest intreaty of their wives; who said,
that unless their husbands came home to them, they would, for the sake
of having children, cohabit with their neighbours. <BIBL>Orosius, lib. i. c. 14.</BIBL></Q>
There cannot be any doubt, therefore, that "fifteen hundred" has been
substituted for "fifteen." You investigate very ingeniously the cause of the
error; but the emendation which you propose, by changing <HI>per mille</HI> into
<HI>permissa,</HI> cannot be well founded, if the number was expressed, as is most
probable, by arithmetical marks in the ancient copies.</P>
<P>2. In Justin, lib. xii. c. 8. we read, <Q>They (the Macedonians) returned,
after beating the enemy, with congratulations, or thanksgivings, into the
same camp.</Q> In this passage you seem to me needlessly to disturb the
ancient reading. You assume, without proof, that they did not venture to
attack the Cuphites. Orosius, Justin's faithful interpreter, declares the
direct contrary. <Q>When they came to the country of the Chosides, they
fought with two hundred thousand of the enemy's cavalry; and, having
conquered them with much difficulty, because they themselves were now
worn out with years and fatigue, and sunk in spirit, they formed a camp
more magnificent than usual, to commemorate their exploit. <BIBL>Orosius,
lib. iii. c. 19.</BIBL></Q> They did not, therefore, return into their camp until they had
<PB N="328" REF="349"/>
combated and conquered the enemy. Justin himself gives us to understand
as much, when he says, <Q>That Alexander, moved by such just prayers,
caused, at the end of his <HI>victory,</HI> a camp to be formed, whose walls might
<HI>inspire terror</HI> into the enemy.</Q> If the Macedonians, therefore, as you
imagine, had been frightened at the innumerable forces of the Cuphites, and
therefore returned hastily into their camp, I do not see why Justin should
say, <HI>at the end of his victory, inspire terror into the enemy,</HI> or <HI>that they
returned to their camp with thanksgivings.</HI> It may here be remarked, in
opposition to Sebisius' emendation, that the expression, <HI>cum gratulatione,</HI> if
translated "with thanksgivings," will include the <HI>caesis hostiis,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
that is, the <HI>sacrifice of thanks;</HI> so that your alteration of <HI>caesis hostiis</HI>
into <HI>omissis hostibus,</HI> is equally inconsistent with historical truth and the
words of Justin.</P>
<P>3. In Justin, lib. xxiv. c. viii. we read, <Q>Part of the mountain carried
away by the earthquake overwhelmed the army of the Gauls; and its
thick masses breaking in scattered pieces, fell down with great force, not
without wounding the enemy.</Q> You need not be offended with the harsh
<PB N="329" REF="350"/>
transposition of the word <HI>hostium,</HI> which you think ought to be joined with
<HI>confertissimi cunei;</HI> as if that last word meant, the military <HI>cunei,</HI> or wedges,
of the Gauls; whereas it really means the thick masses detached from the
rock or mountain, which, breaking into smaller fragments, fell down and
wounded the enemy, that is, the Gauls. There is no transposition therefore
in the case; the sentence flows in the most natural order; and the <HI>confertissimi
cunei</HI> ought not to be joined with <HI>hostium,</HI> lest the ambiguity of the word <HI>cunei</HI>
should make it be applied to the military <HI>cunei,</HI> or wedges of men.</P>
<P>4. In Justin, lib. xxviii. c. 2. we read <Q>That the Romans could not save
their city from the Gauls; and when it was taken, instead of defending it
by the sword, had ransomed it with money.</Q> If this passage required,
or admitted emendation, there is no correction I would adopt more willingly
than yours, which, instead of <HI>captamque,</HI> substitutes <HI>capitoliumque.</HI> Shef∣ferus
objects, without reason, that a city <HI>captam,</HI> taken, cannot properly be
said <HI>defendi serro,</HI> to be defended with the sword; for the Roman historians
<PB N="330" REF="351"/>
agree that their city, when taken, was defended, though in a cowardly man∣ner.
Orosius, among others, says, lib. xi. c. 19. <Q>The Gauls penetrated
into the open city; Rome was now taken; the rest of the youth were
shut up and <HI>besieged</HI> in the citadel of the Capitoline Mount; where they
were a prey to hunger, pestilence, terror, and despair.</Q> You may per∣ceive,
therefore, that though the city was taken, its defence was not en∣tirely
abandoned; and if it had not been taken, it needed not to have been
ransomed. It seems not to have occurred to you, that your correction im∣plies
the Capitol only to have been ransomed, which is not historically true.</P>
<P>5. In Justin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. we read, <Q>Ambassadors were first sent by the
Roman senate to persuade Antiochus, King of Syria, that he should not
make war on the cities of Caele-Syria, which the Egyptians had occupied
in the former war, and which were therefore subject to Egypt; using with
him this argument, that these cities belonged to a young prince, their
pupil, who had been committed by his father to the protection of the
Romans.</Q> This same Author, lib. xxx. c. iii. says, <Q>M. Lepidus was
<PB N="331" REF="352"/>
sent into Egypt to govern that kingdom, with the title of tutor to the
young king. A second embassy was sent, after Antiochus had taken
possession of these cities, demanding that they should be restored; and
without making any mention of the pupil king, merely on this ground,
that these cities belonged to the Romans by the right of war. <BIBL>Justin,
lib. xxxi. c. 1.</BIBL></Q> What this right of war is, in contradistinction both to war
itself, and to conquests made by war, appears from the two following pas∣sages,
the first of which is part of Quintus Flamininus's speech to the tyrant
Nabis, in Livy, lib. xxxiv. c. 32: <Q>By what measures is the friendship
between states violated? Principally by these two; when you treat with
hostility our allies, and when you make alliance with our enemies. Are
not you guilty of both, since you, through our ally, have seized, by arms
and violence, Messené, a city as much our ally as Lacedemon itself; and
since you have entered into an alliance with Philip our enemy?</Q> The
other passage is in Florus, lib. iii. c. 5. <Q>The King (Mithridates) did
not consider Asia as a country not belonging to him; but as it had been
formerly taken from him by violence, he sought to recover it by the law
<PB N="332" REF="353"/>
of war.</Q> I need not mention that "the law of war," in Justin, may have
a reference to both the circumstances by which friendship between states is
violated; but principally to the attack made on the dominions of Ptolemy,
an ally of the Romans, who desire him to be reinstated by Antiochus in
his possessions; for the author immediately adds, that when Antiochus refused
to comply, war was denounced against him.</P>
<P>6. In Justin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. we read, <Q>The senate, therefore, wrote to
Flamininus, that if it seemed expedient to him, as he had delivered Ma∣cedon
from Philip, so he should deliver Greece from Nabis.</Q> The glory
of Flamininus, the general in the Macedonian war, is sufficiently attested
by the words of the senate's decree, in Livy, lib. xxxiii. c. 32. <Q>The se∣nate
and Roman people, and L. Quintius the general, having conquered
king Philip and the Macedonians, declare free and independent republics,
the Corinthians,</Q> &amp;c. Florus, lib. ii. c. 12. says, <Q>Perseus succeeded his
father Philip, and did not think it becoming the dignity of Macedon, that it
should remain in subjection, in consequence of being defeated in one war.</Q>
You ask, whether Quintius, who conquered Macedon, can be said, in any
sense, to have delivered it from Philip, although it appears that Philip was
<PB N="333" REF="354"/>
really not deprived of that kingdom? and whether, if the Roman general con∣quered
Nabis, as he had already conquered Philip, he did not thereby free
Greece? These difficulties are solved by Justin, lib. xxx. c. 4. <Q>The
fortune of the Romans conquered the Macedonians; so that Philip, after
his defeat, having obtained peace from the consul Flamininus, preserved
indeed the name of king, but kept possession only of Macedon, having
lost all those cities of Greece, which, like scattered members of the Ma∣cedonian
kingdom, lay beyond its ancient boundaries.</Q> In the letters,
therefore, of the Roman senate to the consul Flamininus, Marcedon signifies
not the country strictly so called, which alone was not taken from Philip,
but that part of Greece which lay beyond the original limits of Macedon;
to which is opposed the rest of Greece, which was then harassed by Nabis,
but which had never been subject to Macedon. Hence the meaning of the
senate appears to have been, that Quintius, as he had delivered Macedonia,
that is, the part of Greece belonging to Macedon, from Philip, so he should
<PB N="334" REF="355"/>
deliver the rest of Greece from Nabis, who had actually made himself master
nearly of the whole of that country.</P>
<LG>
<L>This is not merely a conjecture sage,</L>
<L>But truth as certain as the Sibyl's page.</L>

<P>THOSE who apply themselves to criticism ought to be cautious in conjec∣tural
emendation, and diligent in classical study, that they may perceive
what vast application this critical art requires, and how rashly those behave,
who immediately alter a passage which they do not at first sight understand,
or which seems to them inconsistent with their rules of grammar or logic.
This rashness is justly reprehended by many, and particularly by the illustri∣ous
Burman, in his valuable preface to Phaedrus; which, as I have always
made it the rule by which my own critical labours have been directed, so I
would warmly recommend it to all those who pursue the same walk of litera∣ture.
<PB N="335" REF="356"/>
Having made this preparatory observation, I proceed to the diffi∣culties
in Justin, about which so much learning has been employed.</P>
<P>1. The emendation of the manifestly corrupt passage in lib. ii. c. 3. § 18.
(a corruption depending on numbers, and therefore as natural as frequent,)
which corrects the error by changing fifteen hundred into fifteen, must be
approved by all judicious critics. The cause which introduced the faulty
reading into the text is uncertain; and the question that has been so indus∣triously
agitated concerning it, appears to me more curious than useful, since
the error might have originated in a thousand different fources. The cor∣rupt
reading runs thus: "Asia was tributary to the Scythians fifteen hundred
years." We agree that it should be corrected thus: "Asia was tributary
to the Scythians fifteen years." But in the corrupt text you think that
obscure traces of the genuine reading may be discerned, and imagine that
<HI>per mille</HI> had crept into the text, instead of <HI>permissa;</HI> explaining the pas∣sage
as if "Asia had been permitted to be tributary to the Scythians for fif∣teen
years." I observed that this emendation, for which I see not any ne∣cessity,
is rendered highly improbable, because in ancient manuscripts the
<PB N="336" REF="357"/>
names of numbers are expressed, not by words, but by letters used as nu∣meral
marks; and though they are sometimes expressed by words, yet this
is not frequent, especially in works of history. This assertion is confirmed
by innumerable testimonies; I shall be contented with referring to that of
Galen de Antidot. I.—It is a subject indeed both of surprise and grief, that
this part of criticism, which consists in ascertaining exactly the rules of nu∣meral
notation, should not have met with due attention; although thereby
the rashness of wild conjecture would be greatly restrained, and more cer∣tainty
might be attained in determining the age and authenticity of manuscripts.
But let it be supposed that your correction were safe on this side, yet it
would be destroyed by the passage which you yourself quote from Justin;
<Q>That Sesostris being put to flight by the Scythians, left behind him his
<PB N="337" REF="358"/>
army and baggage.</Q> The historian having observed, in § 15, that the
Scythians, after returning from the pursuit of the king, rendered Asia,
which they had subdued, tributary; how is it possible that, in § 18, he
should say that this happened not in consequence of their own military suc∣cess,
but in consequence of the permission of Sesostris? We are not now
inquiring what is historically true, but what is Justin's report; which must
not be supposed inconsistent with itself.</P>
<P>2. If we here consult Arrian, he tells us merely that <Q>Alexander pro∣ceeded
to the river Hyphasis, with a view to conquer the Indians who
lived beyond it; but that the Macedonians, then perceiving there was
no end to their labours, refused to advance; and finally prevailed on
Alexander, through the earnest intreaty of Coenus, to prepare for his
return; since every thing seemed adverse to his farther progress. Then
Alexander erected twelve great altars, as monuments of his conquests.</Q>
Arrian says nothing about the Cuphites, the camp, or the two hundred
thousand horsemen, who so much terrified the Macedonians. Curtius
lib. ix. c. 2 and 3, relates, <Q>that Alexander, when he came to the Hy∣phasis,
<PB N="338" REF="359"/>
discovered that the farther bank was inhabited by the Gangaridae
and Pharrasii; that their king, with twenty thousand horse and two hun∣dred
thousand foot, meant to obstruct his passage; being furnished besides
with two thousand chariots and three thousand elephants; which last formed
the most alarming part of his strength. The Macedonians then refused
to follow the king farther; and obtained, through Coenus' entreaty, that
preparations should be made for their return home.</Q> He subjoins;
<Q>Alexander came forth on the third day, and ordered twelve altars of
square stone to be erected as a monument of his expedition, and the for∣tifications
of his camp to be enlarged, and beds of a gigantic size to be
constructed, that by diffusing an air of vastness on every object around
him, he might excite the credulous wonder of posterity.</Q> Plutarch,
in his treatise concerning the fortune of Alexander, speaks to the same
purpose. By comparing these authors with Justin, the reader will perceive
that he differs from them all in several essential circumstances; and parti∣cularly
in saying that Alexander had two motives for enlarging the fortifi∣cations
of his camp; one of which regarded the enemy, and the other had
<PB N="339" REF="360"/>
a relation to posterity. <Q>Moved by such just prayers, he ordered a camp to
be built more magnificent than usual, as at the end of his victory; that its
fortifications might be an object of terror to the enemy, and of admiration
to posterity. <BIBL>Justin, <HI>ibid.</HI> § 16.</BIBL></Q> The other historians are totally silent
as to what regards the enemy; which is favourable to that reading of Justin
which on the faith of manuscripts stands in his text, and extremely adverse
to your emendation. For "the end of his victory" must refer to some re∣cent
victory, and not to his victories in general; otherwise Justin, as you
acknowledge, would have said, "the end of his victories," as in § 10.
above, "wearied, not less by the number of his victories, than by his
toils." As to Alexander's second motive, concerning which all other
historians are silent, "that his fortifications might be an object of terror to
the enemy;" there would not surely be any room for it, on the supposition
that he had determined to move his camp, and leave the country, without
fighting a battle. The Cuphites could not be seized with alarm at seeing
the monuments of the exploits of a man who had not ventured to engage
with their army; nor, on that supposition, would there be any mention of
<PB N="340" REF="361"/>
victory, terror, or sacrifices of thanks; for that the word <HI>gratulatio</HI> refers
to the solemn victims sacrificed in gratitude for success, and frequently men∣tioned
by Arrian, cannot be doubtful to those conversant with ancient writers.
Besides, the word <HI>omissis</HI> including the idea of something begun or neglected,
does not please me, nor seem conformable with Justin's style. Your prolix
discussion concerning the age, design, and character of Orosius has but little
connection with the present subject. It is universally acknowledged, that he
so closely, or rather superstitiously, follows Justin's footsteps, that he fre∣quently
expresses himself in the same words and phrases; and it has long
ago been proved by good critics, that Justin's text, such as it stood in the
copy used by Orosius, may in innumerable places be restored by an attention
to the latter writer. He must be blind indeed, who does not perceive that
in the passage before us Orosius must have copied Justin. Whence could he
otherwise have derived the name <HI>Chosidum,</HI> or <HI>Cuphitum,</HI> which is not men∣tioned
by any other historian? and if that be the case, Orosius must have
<PB N="341" REF="362"/>
found in his original, not that "the enemy were omitted," but that "they
were beat;" in which sense Justin ought to be interpreted.</P>
<P>4. I grant that a town taken by a siege cannot be said to be defended by
its own walls. But may it not be defended by troops in the citadel? When
the enemy are obliged to raise the siege of the citadel, the town may thereby
be delivered from all danger. The expression, at least, might be used by
an author fond of antithesis and amplification.</P>
<P>5. Your new conjecture concerning the towns of Syria which the Romans
acquired by the law of war, would solve the difficulty, were not that con∣jecture
built on an anachronism. For the league entered into with the am∣bassadors
of Antiochus, who came to crave peace, which you find in Livy,
lib. xxxviii. c. 37. was not prior, but subsequent, to Antiochus's expedition
into Egypt, mentioned in Justin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. You may consider whether
the following words of Livy do not refer to this subject: <Q>After this,
Quintius and his ten lieutenants received the ambassadors of kings,
<PB N="342" REF="363"/>
nations, and cities. Those of king Antiochus were first introduced.
They said the same things as formerly, when at Rome, without gaining
belief; and they were now told, not in the ambiguous language which the
Romans had used before the defeat of Philip, and while their own for∣tune
was still doubtful, but in express terms, that Antiochus must evacuate
all the cities of Asia, which had belonged either to Philip or to Ptolemy.</Q>
Livy, lib. xxxiii. c. 34; with which compare c. 39 and 40. Be satisfied with
this authority. Farewell and prosper.</P>

Multus es in defendenda emendatione loci Justin. lib. xii. c. 8.
§ 17. ubi tu pro <HI>caesis hostibus,</HI> contra omnium codicum fidem ex
ingenio, substituendum censes <HI>omissis hostibus;</HI> quam ego emenda∣tionem,
in superioribus meis, variis inductis rationibus, oppugnave∣ram.
Equidem non est animus denuo in hanc disputationem de∣scendere,
aut singulatim ea quae ad diluendas meas rationes in me∣dium
abs te adlata sunt, sub incudem revocare. Strictim tantum
exponam, cur ego nec receptam lectionem sollicitandam, nec pro∣positam
abs te emendationem admittendam esse censeam. Nemo
est qui non fateri cogatur receptam ac codicum side et consensu pro∣batam
lectionem, in se spectatam, bonum et apertum sensum fun∣dere,
nec a stilo Justini, nec a Latini sermonis ratione abludere.
Quod vero recepta isthaec lectio, commissum cum Cuphitis praelium
memorat, de quo apud reliquos scriptores qui res Alexandri memoriae
prodiderunt, altum quidem silentium est; (quamquam nemo sit illorum
qui hoc praelium commissum esse negaverit;) an hoc, inquam, nos ad
sollicitandam constantem codicum lectionem inducere debeat, ut pro
<HI>commisso</HI> praelio illud <HI>omissum esse,</HI> Justinum diserte cogamus pro∣nuntiare?
Ego quidem necessitatem nullam video. Quod si haec
licentia daretur arti criticae, ut si quae in aliquo scriptore facta legi∣mus

commemorata, quae ab aliis silentio involvantur, illa statim ex∣pungenda,
aut per contortam emendationem in contrarium plane
sensum forent convertenda, nihil fere certum aut constans in histori∣corum
scriptorum commentariis reperiretur. Quo minus autem tuam,
vir nobilissime, emendationem admittere possim, duae potissimum
obstant rationes: altera est, quod admissa tua emendatione, reliquae
Justini orationi sua non amplius ratio constet: sed integrum illud
comma foret expungendum: quid enim sibi vellet <HI>omissis hostibus in
castra</HI> REVERTERUNT, quae cur unquam relinquerent, admissa tua
emendatione, nulla ratio aut necessitas fuit? Altera vero ratio, quae
istam tum emendationem respuere videtur, haec est, quod phrasis
<HI>omittere hostes, omissis hostibus,</HI> Justino admodum trita, nusquam
eodem sensu, quo tu adhibes, quantum quidem memini, apud Justi∣num
occurrit: nusquam enim MILITES dicuntur <HI>omittere hostes,</HI> sed
belli duces penes quos summum imperium est, non illi quorum est
imperata facere, et qui hoc ipso loco deprecati sunt, ne juberentur

<HEAD>Mr. BREITINGER to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH I had long dedicated myself, and had purposed to spend my
life, in more severe and sacred studies, yet it is not without pleasure that, at
the invitation of my friends, I occasionally descend into the pleasing fields
of literature; never losing an opportunity to stimulate the diligence of those
who delight in such pursuits, and to serve as a whetstone to others, though
myself unfit for carving. Nothing, therefore, could have been more agree∣able
to my wish, than to be called back to those studies, formerly my de∣light,
by you; anonymously at first, but now in open war. I cannot but
commend your sagacity and genius, which require rather the rein than the
spur; and I earnestly wish that you were accompanied in this literary walk by a
scholar of more cultivated taste, and more copious erudition, than myself.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="365"/>
You employ many arguments in defending your emendation of Justin,
lib. xii. c. 8. § 17; where, instead of "the enemy being bear," you substi∣tute
"the enemy being omitted." I formerly gave you my reasons for re∣jecting
this emendation, and shall not repeat them here, nor enter into a
particular discussion of the answers which you make to my objections. Thus
much only in general I will observe, that the reading in the text, which is
approved by the consenting authority of the manuscripts, must be acknow∣ledged
to contain a very natural meaning, conveyed in good Latin, and in
Justin's style. This reading, indeed, makes mention of a battle with the
Cuphites, concerning which the other historians of Alexander are silent.
But ought this silence to make us alter Justin's text, especially as none of
those historians deny such a battle to have happened? If such licence be
<PB N="345" REF="366"/>
indulged to critics, that they may expunge or alter the words of an his∣toriam,
because he is the sole relater of a particular event, we shall leave
few materials for authentic history. Two reasons strongly militate against
your correction: the first, that if it be admitted, there will no longer be any
consistency in Justin's narrative; and the whole clause must be expunged
which mentions the return of the Macedonians into their camp; which, if
they did not mean to fight, it was not necessary for them to leave. The
second reason is, that the phrase <HI>omittere hostes,</HI> though frequently used by
Justin, is never, that I know, applied by him in the sense which you give
to it. The generals entitled to direct military measures are said <HI>omittere
hostes;</HI> but never the soldiers, whose duty it is to obey orders; and who, in
the passage under consideration, request that they may not be ordered to
renew the engagement with the enemy. To this may be added, that where∣ever
this phrase, <HI>omissis hostibus,</HI> occurs in Justin, it denotes not an end, but
only a change, of the war. Turn to the passage which you formerly referred
<PB N="346" REF="367"/>
to, lib. xxvii. c. 3. § 6. <Q>They left off fighting against their foreign ene∣my,
and made war on each other:</Q> to which you will find a parallel in
lib. xxix. c. 2. § 7. <Q>By this oration he prevailed with Philip to leave
off fighting against the Etolians, and to make war on the Romans.</Q> But
it is sufficient that Orosius read <HI>caesis hostibus</HI> in the copies of Justin which
he made use of. If, by saying <HI>omissis hostibus,</HI> Orosius confirmed your con∣jecture,
the reading in the text would be doubtful indeed.</P>
<P>I have nothing farther to add to my observations concerning the cities of
Syria which the Romans acquired by the right of war.</P>
<P>That we may not harp on the old string, but have new matter for our
friendly contest, you raise a difficulty concerning the first consulship of Ju∣lius
Caesar; which happened on the first of January, in the six hundred and
ninety-fifth year of Rome, and in the forty-first of his age; although by
the laws ascertaining the age of candidates, no person was entitled to crave
that honour before his forty-third year. But this law, which was proposed
by Villius, appears not, any more than other laws appertaining to the same
object, to have been of perpetual authority; as we learn, both from the
<PB N="347" REF="368"/>
Roman historians and from the consular Fasti. Livy, lib. viii. c. 4, says, that
in the consulship of C. Marius Rutilus and Q. Servilius Ahala, it was pro∣vided
by a law of the people, that no person should bear the same magistracy
twice in the space of ten years. But this law seems either not to have been
confirmed, or not to have remained in force: for we afterwards find both in
the Falti and in Livy, that T. Manlius Torquatus was a second time consul
in the space of four years; M. Valerius Corvus, in eight; and L. Papirius
Crassus, in six: L. Papirius Cursor was four times consul in eight years:
which things are inconsistent with this law. To this subject may be referred
what Dio Cassius says concerning another law of the same kind, in his fortieth
book, sect. 56. <Q>Pompey restored the law of the Comitia, which prohi∣bited
any person from being elected into any office of magistracy in his
absence; a law which had fallen into total disuse; and confirmed another,
which had been a short time before enacted by the senate, forbidding any
man who had been a magistrate in the city to command in any foreign
province before the expiration of five years. Yet Pompey, who had just
past these laws, was not ashamed to accept his command in Spain for five
<PB N="348" REF="369"/>
years longer; and to grant, by the same decree, to Caesar (whose friends
impatiently brooked such regulations) the permission of being candidate
for the consulship in his absence, &amp;c.</Q> That the law proposed by Villius
was not uniformly observed, appears from Cicero's oration against Rullus;
where the orator boasts that he was the first man, not graced by ancient no∣bilty,
who had obtained the consulship in the year that he was entitled to
solicit it: but this passage does not inform us what was the force of Villius's
law, when the candidates were patricians of ancient family, or men of con∣sular
dignity. Dolabella certainly, after Caesar's murder, seized the consulship,
when only twenty-five years old, as we are informed by Appian: on which
subject Dio Cassius, lib. xliv. § 22, says, that Dolabella intruded himself
into the consulship, though in nowise belonging to him; and Suetone insi∣nuates,
that Julius obtained something to which he was not by law entitled.
<Q>As the Comitia were already proclaimed, his demand could not be at∣tended
to, unless he entered the city as a private person; and many op∣posing
<PB N="349" REF="370"/>
his being indulged with any favour to which he was not legally en∣titled,
he chose to postpone his claim to a triumph, lest he should be ex∣cluded
from the consulship. <BIBL>Sueton. lib. i. c. 18.</BIBL></Q> Nearly to the same
purpose Anthony, in Caesar's funeral oration, in the forty-fourth book of Dio
Cassius, says, <Q>For this reason, (his success in Spain,) you granted to him
a triumph, and immediately appointed him consul. In the urgency of
his affairs he postponed his triumph; and accepting the consulship,
thanked you for that honour, which he thought sufficient for his own glory.</Q>
It is therefore plain, that by deferring his claim to a triumph, he obtained
the consulship, though a year younger than the age required for holding
that office. Had the Romans intended to enforce against him the Villian
law, there would not have been any reason to withhold from him the honour
of a triumph.</P>
<P>I should willingly admit your remarks, though written in French, on
Salchlini's little work, into the <HI>Museum Helveticum,</HI> were not that publication
<PB N="350" REF="371"/>
interrupted at present; and it is uncertain when the printer will be allowed,
or will have inclination, to publish a new volume.</P>
<P>Farewell, my noble Sir, and prosper; and love me as a man devoted to
ever kind duty.</P>

<P>CHEZ les Romains, ce peuple généreux, qui nous a laissé tant de
choses à admirer et à imiter, les vieux jurisconsultes, que leurs
longs travaux avoient rendus les oracles du barreau, ne se croyoient
pas inutiles à la république, lorsqu'ils cherchoient à développer, à
former des talens naissans, et à se donner de dignes successeurs. Je
voudrois la rétablir cette coutume excellente, et la transporter même
dans les autres sciences. Quiconque cannoît tant soit peu vos
ouvrages et votre réputation, ne vous refusera pas, je pense, le titre
d'un des premières littérateurs du siecle, et je ne crois pas qu'une
folle présomption m'égare, lorsque je m'attribue quelques dispositions
à réussir dans les Belles Lettres. Votre commerce pourroit m'être
d'une grande utilité. Voilà mon seul titre pour vous le demander.
Dans l'espérance qu'il pourra vous engager à me l'accorder, je vais
<PB N="352" REF="373"/>
vous demander des éclaircissemens sur quelques difficultes, et des dé∣cisions
sur quelques conjectures qui se sont offertes à mon esprit.</P>
<P>1. Qui étoit ce Pison le Pere, à qui Horace addresse son art
poétique? M. Dacier croit que c'étoit ce L. Pison le pontife qui tri∣ompha
pour ses exploits en Thrace, et qui mourut préfet de la Ville
A. U. C. 785<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. vi. c. 10. Flor. Hist. Rom. L. iv. c. 12. T. Liv. Epitom. L. c.</NOTE>. Mais il est évident que ce ne fut point lui. Horace
écrivit son art poétique avant l'an 734, puisqu'il y parle de Virgile, qui
mourut dans cette année, d'une façon à faire bien comprendre qu'il
étoit encore vivant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horat. Art. Poet. v. 55.</NOTE>. Or dans un autre endroit du même art poé∣tique<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 366.</NOTE>,
il s'addresse à l'ainé des fils de ce Pison comme à un jeune
homme qui avoit l'esprit dejà formé.</P>
<LG>
<L>"O major juvenum, quamvis et voce paternâ</L>
<L>"Fingeris ad rectum et per te sapis."</L>
</LG>
<P>Ce qui ne peut guères convenir qu'à un jeune homme de dix huit, à
vingt ans. Mais ce L. Pison ne pouvoit point avoir dans ce tems la
un fils aussi agé. Il mourut en 785, agé de quatre vingt ans<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Tacit. ubi supra.</NOTE>. Il
<PB N="353" REF="374"/>
naquit donc en 705, et il n'avoit que trente ans tout au plus, quand
cette épitre fut écrite. Je vois assez clairement, que ce ne pouvoit pas
être là le Pison que nous cherchons; mais, parmi un assez grand
nombre de personnages du siecle d'Auguste qui portoient ce nom, je
voudrois qu'on m'aidat à trouver celui sur qui les soupçons peuvent
tomber avec quelque vraisemblance.</P>
<P>2. Vous savez combein les critiques se sont donnés de peine, pour
rechercher le vrai but qu'avoit Horace dans la troisième ode du troi∣sième
livre. La grandeur des idées, et la noblesse des expressions y
font sentir partout la main de maître: mais on est à la fois faché et
surpris d'y voir que le commencement ne se lie point avec la suite,
que la harangue de Junon paroît ne tenir à rien, et n'aboutir à rien;
et après avoir admiré cette ode par parties, on ne peut guères s'em∣pêcher
d'en condamner l'ensemble. Taneguy le Fevre l'avoit ex∣pliquée
par un systême que M. Dacier trouve mériter autant d'éloges
que l'ode elle même, et qui en effet me paroît des plus jolis. Vous
savez qu'il le fonde sur la crainte qu'il prête au peuple Romain de
<PB N="354" REF="375"/>
voir transférer à Ilium le siege de l'empire; et qu'il suppose qu'Horace
composa cette ode dans la vue de détourner Auguste de ce dessein, en
lui rappellant tout la part que les Dieux avoient eu à la destruction de
cette ville, et combien le mortel qui oseroit la rebâtir s'exposeroit à
tout le courroux de ces mêmes Dieux. Le peuple pouvoit d'autant
plus facilement supposer ce dessein à ce prince, que son pere adoptif
en avoit été soupcçonné<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 79.</NOTE>. Mais je doute que ce fystême puisse se
soutenir. Et on ne sauroit jamais prouver ces craintes prétendues du
peuple Romain, qui son mêmes sans vraisemblance; Auguste se
distingua toujours par les soins particuliers qu'il donna à la ville de
Rome, qui devoient rassurer le peuple contre toutes les craintes d'une
pareille espece. On peut en voir le dêtail dans la vie d'Auguste par
Suetone, c. 28, 29, 30. Je n'en marquerai que deux: il engagea la
plus part des grands à orner la ville, par des bâtimens superbes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vell. Paterculus, L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>, et il
bâtit un Temple à Mars le Vengeur, où il ordonna que le sénat s'as∣sembleroit
toutes les fois qu'il seroit question de guerres ou de tri∣omphes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 29.</NOTE>.
Sont ce la les actions d'un homme qui songe à se faire
<PB N="355" REF="376"/>
une nouvelle capitale? L'exemple de son oncle ne pouvoit con∣clure;
ce fut vers la fin de sa vie qu'il dut concevoir ce projet,
dans un tems où la prosperité l'avoit aveuglé et engagé dans mille
démarches folles et mal entendues, qu'Auguste se piqua toujours
d'éviter avec soin. La sage opiniâtreté avec laquelle il refusa tou∣jours
la dictature, peut servir de preuve à ce que je dis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 52. Vell. Patercul. L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>. Voila
les raisons qui m'empêchent d'acquiescer au systême de Taneguy le
Fevre. J'en suis faché, et je ne serai tout à fait content que lorsque
vous m'aurez fourni une autre explication de cette ode, plus solide
sans doute, et qui en applanira également les difficultés.</P>
<P>3. Antiochus, roi de Syrie, avoit pris plusieurs villes de la Coele∣Syrie
et de la Palestine au jeune Ptolémée, alors sous la tutelle des
Romains. Ceux ci prennent la défense de leur éleve, et ordonnent
au roi de Syrie de les rendre. Il méprise ces ordres, et les retient.
Sur quoi on lui envoye une seconde ambassade, laquelle laissant de
côté les prétensions du jeune prince, lui ordonna de rendre des villes,
<PB N="356" REF="377"/>
que le peuple Romain avoit acquises par le droit de la guerre, <HI>civitates
jure belli factas populi Romani.</HI> Ce sont la les termes de Justin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Justin. L. xxx. c. 1.</NOTE>,
qui nous jettent dans une difficulté embarassante. On ne conçoit pas
comment les Romains pouvoient avoir acquis des villes dans la Syrie,
et dans l'Egypte, puisque, bien loin d'y avoir fait des conquêtes,
ils ne porterent leurs armes en Asie que plusieurs années après cette
époque. On connoît bien un traité qu'ils avoient fait avec les Rois
d'Egypte avant ce tems<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. Epitom. L. iv. Eutrop. L. ii. Valer. Maxim. L. iv. c. 3.</NOTE> mais c'étoit un pur traité d'alliance et
d'amitié qui ne fut précédé ni suivi d'aucune guerre. J'ai cru que
l'examen des autres historiens, qui ont raconté ces mêmes évenemens,
pouvoit jetter quelques lumières sur un passage de Justin aussi obscur
que celui la. Mais Tite Live, qui parle plusieurs fois <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. L. xxxiii. c. 34. 39, 40.</NOTE> des négocia∣tions
par lesquelles les Romains tacherent de faire rendre à Ptolémée
les villes d'Asie, qu'on lui avoit prises, ne parle nulle part de ce droit
de la guerre en vertu duquel les Romains les demandoient. Le savant
M. Breitinger, professeur en langue Grec à Zurich, à qui j'ai com∣muniqué
<PB N="357" REF="378"/>
cette, difficulte, après avoir tenté en vain de la résoudre, a
été obligé ensin de la laisser sans explication.—Mais,</P>
<Q><L>"Nil desperandum, Teucro duce; et auspice Teucro."</L></Q>
<P>4. Un different que Scaliger et Isaac Vossius ont eu ensemble, sur
la veritable époque de la mort du poëte Catulle, a fait beaucoup de
bruit dans la republique des lettres. Je n'ai point eu en main les
pieces du procès, savoir les éditions de Catulle de ces deux hommes
célebres; mais Bayle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bayle Dictionnaire Critique, art. Catulle.</NOTE> nous a donné un extrait fort détaillé de leur
dispute, y ajoutant sés propres réflexiens. Je suis faché de ne pou∣voir
pas remonter aux sources; mais dans la nécessité de me servir de

<P>Quoique deux habiles littérateurs se soient exercés sur cette ques∣tion,
je suis bien loin de la regarder commé parfaitement éclaircie.
Vossius me paroît avoir trop avancé le mort du poëte, Scaliger l'a
certainement trop reculée. Catulle ne mourut pas bien surement
A. U. C. 696; mais il ne veçut pas non plus jusqu'aux jeux séculaires

autres. Il n'y a qu'à lire cette épigramme avec quelque attention
<PB N="359" REF="380"/>
pour voir que Catulle s'addresse toujours à César dans la seconde
personne:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Cinoede Romule, haec videbis et feres?</L>
<L>"Es impudicus, et vorax, et helluo."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Pendantque Mamurra y paroît toujours dans la troisième personne,
ce qui est le cas dans les lignes:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Parum expatravit? an parvum helluatus est?</L>
<L>"Paterna prima lancinata sunt bona.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Il n'y est donc nullement question des dissipations de César, mais
de celle de Mamurra; et toutes les conséquences qu'on en peut tirer
par rapport aux triomphes de celui la, sont illégitimes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cependant si l'on avoit la curiosité de rechercher l'époque précise de la composi∣tion de cette épigramme, un passage de Cicéron nous conduiroit à la fixer vers l'an 708. Car quoiqu'en dise Bayle, on ne peut guères entendre ce passage que d'une piece saty∣rique faite contre Mamurra; aussi bien le savant Dr. Middleton a t'il embrassé cette opi∣nion. Il est inutile de dire que Catulle n'auroit jamais osé composer cette épigramme contre César alors tout puissant. Le clémence de César envers ses ennemis étoit assez connue; la façon même, dont les anciens parlent de la modération dont César usa envers le satyrique, semble supposer qu'il avoit alors la puissance en main, puisqu'auparavant sa clé∣mence auroit eu peu de mérite. Tacite<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Annal. L. iv. c. 34.</NOTE> qui en parle, la fait considerer sur le même pied que celle de Bibalculus. Or on ne peut pas douter qu'Auguste ne fut souverain alors.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="381"/>
D'un autre côté, Catulle ne veçut pas jusqu'aux jeux séculaires
d'Auguste, puisqu'il mourut avant Tibulle. Ovide, dans l'élégie qu'il
sit exprès sur la mort de ce dernier, met Catulle parmi les poëtes, que
son ami devoit recontrer à sa descente dans les Champs Elysées:</P>
<LG>
<L>"Si tamen a nobis aliquid nisi nomen et umbra</L>
<L>"Restat: in Elysia Valle Tibullus erit.</L>
<L>"Obvius huic venias hederâ juvenilia cinctus</L>
<L>"Tempora, cum Calvo, docte Catulle tuo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovid. Eleg. L. iii. 9.</NOTE>."</L>
</LG>
<P>Mais dans quel tems Tibulle mourut il? Une petite épigramme
de Domitius Marius nous l'apprend: le même jour, ou du moins la
même année, que Virgile:</P>
<LG>
<L>"Te quoque Virgilio comitem non aequa, Tibulle,</L>
<L>"Mors juvenem Campos misit ad Elysios<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. Tibull. Carm. L. iv. c. 15.</NOTE>."</L>
</LG>
<P>Or personne n'ignore que Virgile mourut le 22 Septembre 734<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Vit. Virgil.</NOTE>.
Il est donc clair que Catulle, déja mort dans ce tems la, ne vit point
les jeux séculaires qui ne se célébrerent qu'en 736.</P>
<P>Avançons plus loin, et disons, que Catulle étoit déja mort avant
721. Je me fonde sur le témoignage d'un historien contemporain,
<PB N="361" REF="382"/>
ami de Cicéron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 55. Voss. de Hist. Latin. L. i. c. 24.</NOTE> et de Catulle lui même<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. i.</NOTE>; en un mot de Cornelius
Nepos. Il faut le développer ce témoignage. Dans la vie d'Atticus,
que cet écrivain nous a laissée, parlant d'un certain L. Julius Calidius,
à qui Atticus rendit de grands services, il ajoute pour le faire
mieux connoître, <HI>quem post Lucretii Catullique mortem, multo clegan∣tissimum
poetam, nostram tulisse aetatem vere videor posse contendere</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Attici, c. 12.</NOTE>.
Catulle étoit donc mort lorsque Nepos écrivit ce passage. Mais ne
pourroit on pas fixer le tems de sa composition? très facilement:
de vingt deux chapitres qui composent cette vie d'Atticus dix huit
furent publiés de son vivant. <HI>Hactenus Attico vivo haec a nobis edita
sunt</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Idem, c. 18.</NOTE> 'Le passage, où il est parlé de la mort de Catulle, se trouve
dans le douzième chapitre; d'où il s'ensuit que Catulle mourut avant
Atticus. Mais celui ci finit sa vie sous le consulat de Cn. Domitius
et de C. Sosius<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Idem, o. 21.</NOTE>. Si l'on vouloit pousser l'exactitude encore plus
loin, et qu'on eût envie de déterminer l'année précise de la mort
de notre poëte, on ne se tromperoit pas de beaucoup en prenant
<PB N="362" REF="383"/>
l'année moyenne entre A. U. C. 706 et 721; ce qui nous donnera
714, époque qui quadre fort bien avec tout ce que nous en savons
d'ailleurs.</P>
<P>Le seul argument de Scaliger, qui pourroit embarrasser, est celui
qu'il tire du poëme séculaire que Catulle doit avoir composé. La con∣jecture
de Vossius qu'on célébra des jeux au commencement du VII
siecle de Rome n'est pas soutenable. Je doute que celle de Bayle
vaille mieux. Le commencement de ce siecle étoit marqué par tant
de désordres, on negligeoit tellement les anciennes cérémoines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 37.</NOTE>,
qu'il n'y pas d'apparence qu'on ait conçu le dessein de célébrer de
pareils jeux, ni que le peuple s'y attendît. Mais quel besoin de
supposer que ce poëme avoit été composé pour les séculaires. N'est il
pas bien plus naturel de le croire destiné pour la fête de Diane qui se
célébroit tous les ans au mois d'Août; Bentley avoit déja fait cette
conjecture<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bentl. in Praefat. Edit. Horatian.</NOTE>. On peut la cofirmer par la comparaison du poëme
séculaire d'Horace avec ce morceau de Catulle. Dans celui ci les

<HEAD>Mr. GIBBON to Mr. GESNER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the Romans, that generous people, who had so many institutions
worthy of being admired and imitated, the most respectable old lawyers,
whose long labours had rendered them the oracles of the bar, did not think
their time useless to the community, when it was employed in forming the
talents of youth, and in providing for themselves worthy successors. This
excellent custom ought to be adopted, and extended to other sciences. Who∣ever
is acquainted with your reputation and your works, will not deny you
the title of one of the most learned men of the age; and I hope that my
foolish presumption does not deceive me, when I ascribe to myself some na∣tural
aptitude for succeeding in the pursuits of literature. Your correspond∣ence
would be highly useful to me. On this ground only I request it. In
the hope that it will not be refused, I proceed to beg your explanation of
<PB N="352" REF="373"/>
some difficulties that I have met with, and your opinion of some conjectures
that have occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>1. Who was that Piso, the father, to whom Horace addresses his Art of
Poetry? Mr. Dacier supposes him to have been the high-priest who ob∣tained
a triumph for his exploits in Thrace, and who died praefect of the city
in the seven hundred and eighty-fifth year of Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. vi. c. 10. Flor. Hist. Rom. L. iv. c. 12. T. Liv. Epitom. L. c.</NOTE>. But that could not be
the man; for Horace's Art of Poetry was written before the year seven hun∣dred
and thirty-four, since it makes mention of Virgil (who died that year)
in terms which shew that he was still alive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horat. Art. Poet. v. 55.</NOTE>: and in another part of the
poem<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 366.</NOTE>, Horace addresses the eldest of Piso's sons, as a young man of culti∣vated
talents; which implies that he was not less than eighteen or twenty
years of age. But L. Piso, the high-priest, could not surely have a son so old.
He himself died at the age of fourscore<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Tacit. ubi supra.</NOTE>, in the seven hundred and eighty-fifth
<PB N="353" REF="374"/>
year of Rome. He was born, then, in seven hundred and five; and was not
above thirty when the Art of Poetry was written. It is clear therefore, that he
is not the person to whom Horace writes; but, among the number of other
men who bore that name, I wish that you would help me to discover the
Piso to whom that poem was most probably addressed.</P>
<P>2. You know how much trouble it has cost the critics to find out Horace's
true design in the third ode of his third book. This masterly performance
is distinguished by greatness of thought and dignity of expression; but we
are surprised and grieved to find, that the end does not correspond with the
beginning; and that Juno's speech is totally unconnected with what precedes
or follows it; so that after admiring the detached parts of this ode, we are
forced to condemn it as a whole. Taneguy le Fevre explained it by a con∣jecture,
which Dacier thinks deserving of as high encomiums as the ode
itself; and which is, doubtless, very ingenious. You know that his expla∣nation
turns on the supposed dread of the Romans, lest the seat of their em∣pire
<PB N="354" REF="375"/>
should be removed to Troy; and that he fancies the ode to have been
written with a view to divert Augustus from such a design, by shewing him
how earnestly the Gods had co-operated towards the destruction of Troy,
and how much their refentment would be provoked by an attempt to rebuild
that ill-fated city. The people might the more naturally suspect Augustus
of such an intention, because it was thought to have been entertained by his
adoptive father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 79.</NOTE>. But this conjecture, I fear, will not bear examination. It
is impossible to prove those pretended fears of the Romans; which are ren∣dered
highly improbable, when we consider that Augustus was remarkable
for his affectionate partiality towards Rome; as may be seen in his Life, by
Suetonius, c. 28, 29, 30. I shall mention but two examples of it. He en∣couraged
almost all the great men of Rome to adorn the city by superb edi∣fices<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vell. Paterculus, L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>;
and himself erected a temple to Mars the Avenger, where the senate was
ordered to assemble during its deliberations concerning wars and triumphs<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 29.</NOTE>.
<PB N="355" REF="376"/>
These are not the actions of a man who wished to found a new capital. The ex∣ample
of his uncle is not applicable; that project was formed by him towards
the end of his life, when he was intoxicated by prosperity, and engaged in a
thousand wild enterprises, which the prudence of Augustus carefully avoided.
The cautious firmness with which the latter prince always refused the office
of dictator, confirms my remark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 52. Vell. Patercul. L. ii. c. 89.</NOTE>. Such are the reasons which hinder me
from acquiescing in Le Fevre's explanation. I am sorry for it, and will not
be easy till you supply me with another more solidly founded, and equally
well fitted to remove all difficulties.</P>
<P>3. Antiochus, king of Syria, had taken possession of several cities in
Coele-Syria and Judaea, belonging to young Ptolemy, then under the pro∣tection
of the Romans. That people undertake the defence of their pupil,
and order Antiochus to restore his towns. He despises their orders, and
keeps those towns in his possession; in consequence of which, the Romans
send to him a second embassy, which, without making any mention of young
Ptolemy's pretensions, <Q>claim those towns as belonging to the Romans by
<PB N="356" REF="377"/>
the right of war.</Q> These are Justin's words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Justin. L. xxx. c. 1.</NOTE>, which present us with a
very perplexing difficulty; because we do not perceive how the Romans
could have acquired those places by the right of war, since they were so far
from having made conquests in Asia then, that they did not carry their arms
into that country till a later aera. A treaty indeed subsisted between them
and the kings of Egypt<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. Epitom. L. iv. Eutrop. L. ii. Valer. Maxim. L. iv. c. 3.</NOTE>, but it was a treaty merely of friendship and alliance,
neither preceded nor followed by any war. I thought that an examination
of the other historians, who relate the same transactions, might throw light
on this obscure passage of Justin. But Livy, who mentions several times<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. L. xxxiii. c. 34. 39, 40.</NOTE> the
negociations by which the Romans endeavoured to recover for Ptolemy the
places taken from him by Antiochus, is altogether silent with regard to this
"right of war," in virtue of which they were demanded. I acquainted the
learned Mr. Breitinger, professor of Greek at Zurich, with my difficulty on
<PB N="357" REF="378"/>
this subject; which, after attempting in vain to resolve, he was obliged to
leave unexplained. But,</P>
<Q><L>"Nil desperandum, Teucro duce; et auspice Teucro."</L></Q>
<P>4. A difference of opinion between Scaliger and Isaac Vossius, concerning
the time of Catullus' death, made great noise in the republic of letters. I
have not at hand the original arguments of those learned men, which are
contained in their respective editions of Catullus; but Bayle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bayle Dictionnaire Critique, art. Catulle.</NOTE> has given us a
particular account of their dispute, with his own reflections on the subject.
I am sorry that I cannot draw from the fountain head; but Bayle's accuracy
as a compiler will not be disputed.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the labours of these great scholars, I am far from think∣ing
the question decided. Vossius seems to me to place Catullus' death too
early, and Scaliger certainly fixes it at too late an aera. That poet surely did
not die in the year of the city six hundred and ninety-six; but neither did
<PB N="358" REF="379"/>
he live to see the secular games of Augustus celebrated in seven hundred and
thirty-six. Let us prove these assertions, and endeavour to find out the
true aera in question, which must have been at an intermediate time between
the years just mentioned.</P>
<P>Catullus speaks of Great Britain and its inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Catull. Carm. xi. &amp;c.</NOTE>, with which Caesar first
made the Romans acquainted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tacit. in Vit. Agricol. C. 13.</NOTE>, by his expedition thither, in the year of Rome
six hundred and ninety-eight<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Caesar. Comm. L. iv. Dion. Hist. L. xxxix. p. 113.</NOTE>. Catullus also mentions the second consulship
of Pompey, which happened on that same year<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. cxi.</NOTE>. He lived so late as the
year seven hundred and six, since he speaks of the consulship of Vatinius<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Idem, lii.</NOTE>.
I will not make use of Scaliger's arguments to prove that the poet witnessed
Caesar's triumphs, because I do not believe them well-founded. I will not
particularly examine whether the words <HI>paterna prima lancinata sunt bona</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Idem, xxvii. ver. 29.</NOTE>,
best apply to the first or last victories of Caesar, because I do not believe
them to have any reference to the one or the other. We need only to read
<PB N="359" REF="380"/>
the epigram attentively, to perceive that Catullus always addresses Caesar
in the second person, and Mamurra in the third.</P>
<P>The poet alludes, therefore, not to Caesar's dissipation, but to that of Ma∣murra;
and all the consequences deduced from his applying his words to the
former, are built on a false hypothesis<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Were we curious to ascertain exactly the date of this epigram, a passage of Cicero would lead us to fix it at the year 708. For, notwithstanding Bayle's reasonings, we can∣not regard it in any other light than that of a satire written against Mamurra; an opinion embraced by the learned Dr. Middleton. There is no weight in the observation, that Ca∣tullus would not have ventured to write this epigram against Caesar in the plenitude of his power. Caesar's clemency towards his enemies is well known; and the terms in which historians speak of his lenity shewn to this satirist implies that he was then pos∣sessed of power to punish him; otherwise his moderation would have been of little value. Tacitus<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Annal. L. iv. c. 34.</NOTE> speaks of this affair as a parallel to that of Bibalculus, who sati∣rised Augustus when the latter was certainly invested with sovereign dominion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="381"/>
Catullus, on the other hand, did not live to see the secular games cele∣brated
by Augustus, since he died before Tibullus. Ovid, in an elegy
written on the death of the latter, places Catullus among the poets whom
his friend will meet with in the Elysian fields<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovid. Eleg. L. iii. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But when did Tibullus die? A little epigram of Domitius Marius in∣forms
us, that he died the same day, or at least in the same year, with Virgil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. Tibull. Carm. L. iv. c. 15.</NOTE>.
Now it is well known that Virgil died the twenty-second of September seven
hundred and thirty-four<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Vit. Virgil.</NOTE>. Catullus then could not see the secular games,
which were not celebrated till seven hundred and thirty-six.</P>
<P>We may go farther, and affirm, that Catullus was dead before the year
seven hundred and twenty-one. This is proved by a contemporary histo∣rian,
<PB N="361" REF="382"/>
the friend of Cicero<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. i. c. 55. Voss. de Hist. Latin. L. i. c. 24.</NOTE> and of Catullus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. i.</NOTE>; I mean Cornelius Nepos. In
his Life of Atticus, speaking of a certain Julius Calidius, to whom Atticus
had rendered very important services, he distinguishes him, <Q>as the most
elegant poet of that age, since the death of Lucretius and Catullus <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Attici, c. 12.</NOTE>.</Q>
The latter, therefore, was dead before Nepos wrote this passage; of which
it is not difficult to fix the date. Nepos' Life of Atticus consists of twenty-two
chapters; the first eighteen of which were, as he tells us, written while
the subject of them still lived<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Idem, c. 18.</NOTE>. The passage mentioning the death of Ca∣tullus
is in the twelfth chapter; from whence it follows, that Atticus sur∣vived
Catullus. But Atticus died during the consulship of Cn. Domitius
and C. Sosius<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Idem, o. 21.</NOTE>. Did we wish to ascertain still more accurately the precise
year of Catullus' death, we should not be much mistaken in fixing it at the
middle term between the years of Rome seven hundred and six, and seven
<PB N="362" REF="383"/>
hundred and twenty-one; which will give us the year seven hundred and
fourteen; which very well agrees with all other particulars known con∣cerning
him.</P>
<P>The only argument adduced by Scaliger, that can occasion any difficulty,
is, that Catullus composed a secular poem. Vossius' conjecture, that the
secular games were celebrated at the commencement of the seventh century
of Rome, is altogether unwarranted: that of Bayle, I fear, rests not on
much better authority. The beginning of that century was deformed by
so many disorders, and by such a marked neglect of ancient ceremonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. L. ii. c. 37.</NOTE>,
that there is not any probability that such games should then have been
either exhibited or expected. But it is not necessary to suppose that Ca∣tullus'
poem was written for the secular games. It might have been in∣tended
merely for Diana's festival, which was celebrated yearly in the month
of August; as Bentley conjectured<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bentl. in Praefat. Edit. Horatian.</NOTE>. This is confirmed by comparing this
poem with Horace's <HI>Carmen Seculare.</HI> In the former, both the boys and girls
<PB N="363" REF="384"/>
form but one chorus, which addresses itself to Diana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catull. Carm. xxxiv. ver. 1.</NOTE>. In Horace, the boys
address themselves to Apollo, and the girls to Diana<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horat. Carm. Secular. ver. 34.</NOTE>. This distinction had
been established by the oracle who commanded the celebration of the
games<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">V. Dissertat. Cl. Turretin de Ludis Secular. p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>

hominibus, esse illos innocentes, civiles, Romani populi studiis con∣formes?
Voluit eadem ode blandiri genti Juliae, quae origines Trojanos

<HEAD>Mr. GESNER to Mr. GIBBON.</HEAD>
<P>1. YOU inquire who were the Pisos, of whom Horace speaks in such ho∣nourable
terms in his Art of Poetry. Dacier and Sanadon would probably,
most learned Sir, have obtained more credit with you, had they cited the
authority on which their opinion rests; and independently of which, it seems
no better than a guess, which a slight argument is sufficient to overturn.
This authority is that of Porphyrio, an ancient writer, who treats of the
names mentioned in Horace, and who here perhaps copies from some author
more ancient than himself. In his corrected edition Porphyrio says, <Q>Ho∣race's
work, intitled the Art of Poetry, is addressed to L. Piso, who was
afterwards governor of Rome; for Piso was himself a poet, and a patron
of literary pursuits.</Q> But chronology, you say, does not warrant this
explanation. It does; for Tacitus tells us, in his Annals, (lib. vi. c. 10.)
that Piso died U. C. 785, at the age of eighty. He held his office twenty
<PB N="365" REF="386"/>
years; and therefore entered on it U. C. 765; before which period Horace
must have sent to him the Art of Poetry, (which I suspect once stood at the
third epistle of the second book,) because Porphyrio says, <Q>who was after∣wards
governor of Rome.</Q> Let us suppose that Piso's son was born
when the father was thirty years old; and that the son was sixteen when
Horace addressed him, <HI>O major juvenum;</HI> the Art of Poetry will then have
been written in the fifty-second year of Horace's age; which well agrees
with Bentley's computation; a subject which I remember to have exa∣mined
and approved when about the same time of life I published my edi∣tion
of Horace. If we think sixteen years too young for the praises be∣stowed
by the poet, we may add to them five, or even ten years more.
But to this mode of reckoning it is objected, that Virgil was alive when
Horace wrote his Art of Poetry; and as the latter died in the year of
Rome seven hundred and thirty-five, Piso, who was then but thirty years
old himself, could not have a son above ten or twelve at the utmost. But
some critics do not disapprove of the application of <HI>juvenis</HI> to a boy of ten
<PB N="366" REF="387"/>
years, and of a forward genius: Grotius and others were poets at that age;
and the Roman courtiers would naturally, I think, be prodigal in using the
term <HI>juvenis,</HI> after Cicero gave so much offence by applying the term <HI>puer</HI>
to Augustus.</P>
<P>But I see not any convincing argument to prove that Virgil was alive
when the Art of Poetry was written. For, in the passage alluded to, Horace
does not contrast living poets with those that were dead, but ancient poets
with the modern; and, according to the critics whom he mentions, not
death alone, but the being dead a certain number of years, was necessary for
the attainment of poetical same.</P>
<Q><L>"Est vetus atque probus, centum qui perficit annos."</L></Q>
<BIBL>See the first epistle of the second book.</BIBL>
<P>2. Concerning the third ode of the third book, I formerly gave my opi∣nion
in the observations accompanying my edition, which, as you have not
seen them, I shall here repeat and explain. Augustus sometimes represented
in sport the suppers of the gods. We know from Suetone, lib. ii. c. 70.
that he was blamed for his imitation of the supper of the twelve gods, which
<PB N="367" REF="388"/>
used to take place in the capitol, where pallets were spread for them; of
which we see an example in Livy, lib. xxii. c. 10. Is it not possible that
Horace, either with or without the orders of Augustus, might think proper
to write verses adapted to such a representation? Might he not endeavour to
remove the blame attached to it, by exhibiting an example in which it was
not only innocent, but conformable with the institutions and inclinations of
the Romans? At the same time his ode would be a compliment to the
Julian family? which had long boasted its descent from Aeneas and Iülus. For
entering on this subject, the poet ingeniously prepares the way, by showing
that men had attained divinity through justice and fortitude. Augustus is
entitled to our admiration and praise; and, as he sung in another ode, written
nearly about the same time, <HI>presens divus habebitur,</HI> being not less worthy of
divinity than Bacchus and Romulus; the latter of whom was not without dif∣ficulty
admitted to that honour, <Q>till Juno made her most pleasing and ac∣ceptable
speech in the council of the gods.</Q> This speech is of the same
purport with that in the Aeneid, lib. xii. v. 791. <HI>&amp; seq.;</HI> and might have
been pronounced with propriety, without supposing that Augustus ever seri∣ously
thought of changing the seat of his empire. That prince also must
<PB N="368" REF="389"/>
have been pleased with an attempt to persuade the people that he condemned
a design, said to have been entertained by Julius Caesar, but which was so
much detested by the Romans, and would, if carried into execution, have
been so calamitous to Rome. The speech indeed is longer, and more pa∣thetic
than might be expected from the beginning of the ode; but <HI>he</HI> must
be ignorant of the nature of lyric poetry, as illustrated in the writings of the
ancients, who finds fault with the length of this real or apparent digression.</P>
<P>3. The knot must be hard indeed, which not only baffles the exertions of
a learned and ingenious youth, but resists the strength of Breitinger, a ve∣teran
in the literary field, whose name I never pronounce but with the highest
respect. How could Roman ambassadors require that the cities taken by
Antiochus in Asia should be restored, according to the law of war, to Rome,
when the senate shortly before had declared those cities to belong to its
pupil Ptolemy? Or how could the Romans claim those cities by the law of
war, when Scipio, a few years afterwards, was the first Roman general that
passed into Asia with an army? Livy, lib. xxxvii. The knot, however,
may be untied, without having recourse to Alexander's sword, provided we
<PB N="369" REF="390"/>
follow the series of those transactions, as related by Justin and Livy. The
latter historian, lib. xxxi. c. 14, relates, <Q>that Philip's courage was in∣creased
by his league with Antiochus, king of Syria, with whom, as soon
as he learned Ptolemy's death, he purposed, according to the tenor
of that agreement, dividing the spoils of Egypt.</Q> Justin, again, lib. xxx.
c. 2, tells us, <Q>that the Alexandrians sent ambassadors to Rome, re∣questing
the senate to defend the cause of their pupil, threatened with the
partition of his dominions, in consequence of a treaty for that purpose be∣tween
Philip and Antiochus.</Q> This treaty indeed soon began to be car∣ried
into effect; for, according to Livy, lib. xxxii. c. 19. <Q>Antiochus,
while his ally was occupied in the war with Rome, conquered all the
cities belonging to Ptolemy in Coele-Syria; purposing next to invade
the coast of Caria and Cilicia, and at the same time to assist Philip with a
fleet and army.</Q> Meanwhile Philip is conquered by the Roman consul
Quintius; who then openly declared to Antiochus' ambassadors, <Q>that their
<PB N="370" REF="391"/>
master must evacuate (supply, "according to the law of war,") all those
cities to which either Philip or Ptolemy had any claims. <BIBL>Livy, lib. xxxiii.
c. 34.</BIBL></Q> Justin's narrative, therefore, though obscured by brevity, is yet
consistent with truth.</P>
<P>Do you not repent, learned Sir, the having written to an indolent old
man, who could delay two months sending an answer to a letter so obliging,
and so honourable to himself? I will not throw the blame on my advanced
age, though I begin to feel my former powers of exertion somewhat slacken
and abate under the weight of sixty-seven years. At this time of life most
old men are indulged with a diminution of labour; whereas I, on the con∣trary,
am continually burdened with an increase of occupations and cares.
I belong to several academies, particularly that of Berlin, and this here of
Gottingen; which last I am appointed to direct six months in the year; I
also preside weekly in the German society of this place, and frequently cor∣respond
with the Latin society of Jena. I am entrusted with the care of
the public library, consisting at least of fifty thousand volumes; with the in∣spection
<PB N="371" REF="392"/>
of the colleges in his majesty's German dominions; and with the
superintendance of about twenty youths, who are educated at the public ex∣pence.
The task also falls on me of writing whatever is inserted in the ar∣chives
of the university, in the name of the rector and senate: and it is my
duty to give daily three, four, and sometimes more prelections. To these
public offices must be added the avocations of private company, and of a
very extensive correspondence. Besides, I have always some work in hand,
which requires nicer attention to render it worthy of the public eye. At
present I am employed about an edition of Claudian; which, God willing!
shall be published in the course of this summer. Thus circumstanced, I
confess that I laid aside your letter, which seemed as if it would require more
pains to answer than were afterwards found necessary, until I should enjoy a
few hours of uninterrupted leisure. This opportunity occurred only yester∣day,
of which, you see, I made use.</P>
<P>It remains that I request you to receive favourably this attempt; and if it
does not fully answer your expectation, to ascribe the failure to any other
<PB N="372" REF="393"/>
cause rather than my want of inclination to oblige you. Brevity was my
aim, because it seemed unnecessary to repeat what you had so well said on
the subject. I write in Latin, a language familiar to me, lest I should com∣mit
a mistake similar to that of which you, though well-skilled in French, are
guilty, when you say, <HI>Un different que Scaliger &amp; Is. Vossius ont eu ensemble.</HI>
From which words it might be concluded, that a difference had subsisted be∣tween
these learned men, of whom the one died nine years before the other
was born. I remain sincerely, with much consideration, &amp;c.</P>

<P>4. As to the question concerning the age of Catullus, I am entirely of
your opinion; and lest you should think that I agree with you, merely be∣cause,
through laziness, I am unwilling to enter into an argument, I shall
transcribe the words of a thesis, which I defended in my youth forty years
<PB N="373" REF="394"/>
ago, (p. 43. Weimar, 1717,) concerning the secular years and games of
the Romans. <Q>There is nothing in the poem which might not have been
said, had it been written for any other festival in honour of Diana,</Q> &amp;c.
I assure you, that within this hour I have compared what is said in your
learned dissertation, with Is. Vossius' remarks on Catullus, (edit. 1684, 4to.
p. 81, <HI>&amp; seq.</HI>) and those of Jos. Scaliger, whom he refutes. I also exa∣mined
the passage of Cicero concerning Mamurra, with Middleton's ob∣servations
on it; and having examined and well weighed the whole matter,
I pronounce sentence, most excellent Gibbon, clearly in your favour.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Your letters will find me without any farther direction than that of my
name and place of abode, or addressed to Mr. Professor Gesner, coun∣sellor
of the Court of his Britannic Majesty, Gottingen. But if you
wish to see my titles expanded at full length after the German fashion,
here they are, copied from the French and German Title-book,
<PB N="374" REF="395"/>
printed at Nordhausen, 1752, 8vo. fifth edition, p. 164. <Q>To Mr.
Gesner, Counsellor of the Court of his Britannic Majesty, Professor in
the University of Gottingen, Inspector General of the Schools of the
Electorate of Hanover, Librarian of the University, Director of the
Philological Seminary, President of the Royal Society of German Elo∣quence,
Member of the Royal Society of Sciences at Gottingen,</Q> &amp;c.
There is not one of these titles but deprives me of some part of my
time; the only reason for which I here subjoin them; which I shall think
you believe, if your letter to me has as short a direction as possible.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MONSIEUR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LA multitude de vos occupations montrent à la fois votre mérite,
la justice qu'on lui rend, ma présomption, et votre bonté. Que
j'envie le sort de ce petit nombre d'esprits supérieurs dont les talens
toujours les mêmes, et toujours diversifiés, revêtissent avec une égale
facilité tous les caractères que l'utilité ou l'agrément des hommes
exige d'eux. J'applaudis encore au discernement de ces princes qui
osent écarter les nuages dont la frivolité, l'envie, et la calomnie en∣vironnent
leurs trones, qui rendent aux grands hommes de leurs
états, une justice que le public impartial leur rendoit depuis long tems
et qui savent récompenser leurs talens, en leur fournissant de nouvelles
occasions de les développer. Voila une petite partie des réflexions
qu'a fait naitre votre lettre; si j'en croyois mon inclination, elles
n'auroient point de bornes; mais la raison me dit que je dois me con∣tenter
<PB N="376" REF="397"/>
de vous assurer de toute la reconnoissance dont vous avez pé∣nétré
un homme qui se fera toujours gloire du titre de votre disciple.
Je vais dans peu de tems en Angleterre; je pourrois peut etre y
trouver l'occasion de vous prouver mes sentimens, ou du moins mon
commerce vous deviendra moins ennuyeux. Mon séjour dans une
capitale éclairée me donnera une sorte de mérite local. Incapable de
les imiter, je vous apprendrai de bonne-heure les travaux, et les dé∣couvertes
de nos savans. Gottingue mérite bien qu'à mon tour je
vous demande quelles sont les occupations de vos collegues et de vos
disciples. Un nouveau plaisir que j'envisage dans mon retour en Angle∣terre,
c'est la connoissance de tous vos ouvrages. Mon premier soin
sera de me les procurer, et de les étudier comme mes meilleurs mo∣dèles:
pour m'aider dans cette recherche, je prendrai la liberté de
vous demander une liste de tous ces morceaux curieux dont vous avez
enrichi la république des lettres. Mon ignorance de plusieurs d'entre
eux excite à la fois ma joye et ma honte. Ma jeunesse, et le lieu
d'où je datte mes lettres, sont mon unique excuse.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="398"/>
Si j'ose proposer quelques nouveaux doures, vous savez mieux
que personne qu'il n'y a que la raison, ou du moins son apparence
que soit absolue. Soyez persuadé que mon unique but en discutant
vos leçons, c'est de m'en rendre digne:</P>

</LG>
<P>Après cette explication, je vous avouerai qu'il me reste encore quel∣ques
nuages sur le Pison de l'Art Poétique. Vous ne croyez pas que
les paroles d'Horace touchant Virgile, prouvent que ce poëte fût en∣core
vivant, et que l'opposition est plutôt des anciens aux modernes,
que des mots aux vivans. J'ai relu l'endroit, mais cette nouvelle
lecture, et les réflexions aux quelles elle a donné lieu, n'ont fait que
me confirmer dans ma première opinion. Horace trouvoit la langue
<PB N="378" REF="399"/>
Latine pauvre et trop stérile, pour exprimer les idées abstraites que
les compagnons de Romulus, les pâtres, et les brigands ne connois∣soient
point: plusieurs de ses compatriotes lui avoient trouvé le
même défaut. Horace souhaite de l'enrichir. Il propose pour cet
effet aux Virgile, aux Varius, de travailler dans ce dessein, et d'em∣prunter
du Grec quantité de termes énergiques dont ils avoient
besoin. Il leur offre son secours. C'est un projet qu'il forme et non
une chose déja faite qu'il justifie. Par conséquent l'avenir qu'il envi∣sage
ne peut regarder que ceux d'entre les écrivains qui vivoient en∣core.
Par conséquent l'Art Poétique fut composé avant l'an 735.
Le point de vue sous lequel je considere ce passage, est si bien celui du
poëte lui même, que celui ci finit cette opposition par cette image
(une des plus vives et des plus justes, que je connoisse):</P>
<LG>
<L>"—licuit semperque licebit</L>
<L>Signatum praesenti notâ producere nomen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horat. de Art. Poet. ver. 59.</NOTE>."</L>
</LG>
<P>Le <HI>licuit,</HI> le passé, regarde les Terence, les Caecilius, morts depuis long
<PB N="379" REF="400"/>
tems; le <HI>licebit,</HI> le futur, les Varius, les Virgile, ceux qui étoient
encore en état d'en profiter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cette explication est d'autant plus vraisemblable, que dans ses ouvrages, Virgile s'est plutôt piqué de faire revivre de vieux mots, que d'en emprunter de nouveaux du Grec. Je doute même qu'on puisse trouver un seul endroit où il ait suivi le conseil d'Horace.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mais, dites vous, dans ce tems même le jeune Pison pouvoit
avoir dix ans; Grotius faisoit bien des vers à cet age. Je le
sais: mais les Grotius sont ils bien communs; combien d'enfans
trouverez vous de dix ans, qui ayent non-seulement assez de feu pour
faire des vers, mais encore assez de réflexion pour en juger sensé∣ment?
Il n'est pas même vraisemblable qu'à l'age de vingt ans
Pison le pere eût déja des enfans. Vous savez combien rares étoient
les mariages sous Auguste; combien l'exemple de Germanicus
paroissoit admirable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Suet. L. ii. c. 34.</NOTE>; combien la pauvreté<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. ii. c. 37.</NOTE>, la debauche, et l'orgueil,
<PB N="380" REF="401"/>
arretoient la noblesse dans le célibat, surtout pendant les guerres
civiles qui désolerent la terre, pendant la première jeunesse de Pison.
Les loix d'Auguste ne font qu'indiquer la grandeur du mal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hist. Rom. L. lvi. p. 570.</NOTE>, et les
premières de ces loix furent promulguées plus de trente ans aprés la
naissance de Pison<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horat. Carm. Secular. v. 17, &amp;c. Torrent de Lege Juliâ ad Calc. Horat. p. 75, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Si l'on compte une génération ordinaire <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> à
trente trois ans<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herodot. L. ii. Newton Chronol. Emendat. p. 41.</NOTE>, il paroît que sous le commencement de l'empire,
on devroit les pousser plutôt jusqu'à quarante ans, que de les réduire
à vingt. Je conviens que ce ne sont la que des probabilités, mais dans
la science de la critique, il paroît que les probabilités doivent faire
disparoître les possibilités, et céder à leur tour aux preuves. Je ne
crains rien de ce principe. L'autorité d'un Prophyrion n'a pas assez
de force parmi les savans, pour pouvoir jamais former un raisonne∣ment.
Tout ce qu'elle pourroit faire, ceseroit d'en appuyer un déja
prouvé. Les anciens ne donnoient point à Porphyrion la première
place parmi les commentateurs d'Horace<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vid. Vitam Horat. sine nomine Autoris.</NOTE>, et les modernes, Mon∣sieur
<PB N="381" REF="402"/>
Dacier surtout, lui ont trouvé beaucoup d' erreurs. Je ne
sens pas d'ailleurs la force de la première de vos hypothèses. Si
Pison avoit eu son fils à l'age de trente ans, celui ci pouvoit en
avoir seize, lorsque Horace lui écrivit, age, suivant vous, qui repond
aux conditions requises. Auriez vous oublié dans ce moment qu' Ho∣race
mourut en 745; quand Pison lui même n'avoit que 40 ans?</P>
<P>2. Je ne doute pas un instant qu'Horace n'ait eu en vue, dans la troi∣sième
Ode du troisième Livre, de faire voir aux Romains que si leur
prince aspiroit aux honneurs divins, <HI>Viamque affectat Olympo,</HI> il les mé∣ritoit
par ses exploits, dont la grandeur égaloit celle des plus fameux
héros, d'un Bacchus, d'un Hercule, d'un Romulus, héros, qui méprisant

nous savons toujours que puisque Marc Antoine la rapella dans les
lettres à son rival<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suet. L. ii. c. 70.</NOTE>. Elle arriva avant la dernière brouillerie des
triumvirs, ou avant l'an 721. Suivant Bentley<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bentley in Praefat. ad Horat.</NOTE> dont vous adoptez
les idées, Horace composa le troisième livre des Odes dans la qua∣rante
deuxième, et la quarante troisième année de son age, c'est à dire,
en 728 et 729. Une justification venue sept ou huit ans après coup,
bien loin de faire plaisir à Auguste n'auroit servi qu'à faire revivre
la mémoire de ces excès, que la politique du prince, et la reconnois∣sance
du peuple avoient plongé dans l'oubli. 2. Auguste soupa avec
onze hommes, ou femmes, pareillement equippés en divinités. Ho∣race
élevoit bien Auguste à la table des dieux, <HI>purpureo bibit ore
nectar;</HI> mais y placoit il aussi tous ses compagnon? L'honneur
seroit devenu bien banal, et un tel panégyrique n'eut pas été fort
éloigné de la satyre. Je conviens bien du reste avec vous, que trouver
le plan d'un morçeau de poësie Lyrique, est un but plus desirable
<PB N="383" REF="404"/>
que nécessaire. Les Lyriques ont toujours eu le privilege de prendre
un vol que l'imagination admire, et que la timide raison n'ose criti∣quer.
Dans l'ode dont nous parlons, que ce défaut, si c'en est un,
est racheté par de grandes beautés! Les deux premières strophes font
sentir quel effet, l'union de la philosophie avec la poësie, peut produire:
le <HI>justum et tenacem propositi virum</HI> est le sage des stoiciens, leur
roi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horat. Serm. L. i. Serm. iii. ver. 124.</NOTE>, leur seul heureux. La justice formoit toutes ses résolutions;
une constance inébranlable le rendoit ardent à les suivre<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cicero pro Murenae, c. 29. De la Mothe le Vayer, tom. i. p. 606, &amp;c. de la Vertu des Payens.</NOTE>. Un
tel homme au dessus des passions et des préjugés, n'y jettoit quelque∣fois
les yeux que pour s'écrier,
<Q><L>"O! curas hominum! O! quantum in rebus inane!"</L></Q>
S'il est honteux pour l'espece humaine de n'avoir jamais produit cet
homme; il lui est bien honorable d'avoir su en former un tableau.
Quelle gradation dans les images! son sage résisteroit aux clameurs
<PB N="384" REF="405"/>
d'une multitude forcenée. Mais la colère du peuple s'appaise avec la
même facilité qu'elle s'est allumée. Il mépriseroit les menaces d'un
tyran furieux; mais les coeurs des tyrans se sont quelquefois laissé
fléchir. Il entendroit sans fremir le bruit des tempêtes sourdes aux
cris des malheureux. Mais la fortune a souvent sauvé les victimes à
la fureur des flots. Egal à Jupiter, il n'en craindroit par la foudre.
Içi l'imagination s'arrete en tremblant. Elle craint pour le poëte
une chute foible ou outrée; elle ne sent point d'image supérieure au
courroux du maître des Dieux et des hommes. Avec quel étonne∣ment
admire t'elle le génie du poëte, quand elle lit, <Q>Il recevra sans
sourciller le choc de l'univers écroulé, où une même destruction de∣voit
envélopper, les hommes, les élémens, et les Dieux eux mêmes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. L. vi. Epist. 20.</NOTE>.</Q>
Je m'arrete. Peut etre ces réflexions vous ennuyent: en ce cas,
c'est ma faute. J'aurai cependant rempli mon but qui étoit de faire
voir le point de vue sous lequel je considere l'érudition la plus grande.

<P>3. Vous connoissez, Monsieur, ce sameux passage de Velleius Pater∣culus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vell. Patere. L. ii. c. 125.</NOTE>,
qui a donné tant de peine aux savans. Le voici: <HI>Ita Dru∣sus
qui a patre ad id ipsum plurimo pridem igne emicans incendium
militaris tumultus missus erat, priscâ antiquáque severitate usus, anci∣pitia
sibi tam rem quam exemplo perniciosa, et his ipsis militum gla∣diis,
quibus obsessus erat, obsidentes coercuit.</HI> Il ne paroît pas qu'on
en puisse tirer quelques sens raisonnable. Il faut absolument le sup∣poser, ou inutile, ou corrompu. Aussi tous les critiques, qui ont tra∣vaillé
sur cet auteur, ont ils essayé de le rétablir. Burerius, Acida∣lius,
Grutar, Boeclerus, Heinsius, Burman, ont tous fourni des con∣jectures
plus ou moins vraisemblables, mais que je ne me propose
pas de discuter. Il vaudra mieux, je crois, vous en offrir une de ma
façon, et vous laisser juge de son plus, ou moins de probabilité.
Au lieu de la leçon reçue, je lirai, <HI>Priscâ antiquâque severitate, FUSUS
ancipitia sibi tam re quam exemplo perniciosa.</HI> Il saute aux yeux com∣bien
ce léger changement présente un sens net. Il est aisé de faire
<PB N="386" REF="407"/>
voir qu'elle est des plus conformes à l'analogie de la langue, et à
la vérité de l'histoire. Les meilleurs grammairiens reconnoissent
aujourdhui, que les Latins, faute d'une forme moyenne à leurs
verbes, se sont souvent servi des participes d'une terminaison passive
dans un sens actif<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Burman ad Vell. Paterc. L. ii. c. 97. Perizon. ad Sanct. Minerv. L. i. c. 15. n. 4.</NOTE>. Qu'ainsi ils ont dit <HI>juratus, punitus,</HI> pour
dire <HI>qui juravit, qui punivit.</HI> On trouve mème <HI>peragratus</HI> dans ce
sens, dans Velleius lui même<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vell. Paterc. L. ii. c. 97.</NOTE>. Ainsi <HI>fusus,</HI> pour exprimer l'action
de Drusus, ne doit pas étonner. L'histoire est également favorable
à notre correction. Drusus (suivant Tacite) arrive au camp des
rebelles<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. i. c. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Ses ordres sont méprisés, ses offres deviennent sus∣pectes.
Les soldats le tiennent prisonnier dans le camp, ils outragent
ses amis, ils ne cherchent qu'un prétexte pour commencer le carnage;
quel danger pour sa personne! <HI>Sibi ancipitia tam re.</HI> On connoit
la sévérité de la discipline Romaine. Les chefs étoient pour les
soldats, des dieux; leurs ordres, des oracles. Quel renversement de
toutes ces maximes! Quel funeste exemple pour l'avenir, que
<PB N="387" REF="408"/>
la sédition des légions Pannoniennes! Le fanatisme, qui a fait tant
de maux, fit cette fois du bien: une éclipse de lune étonna les
soldats, et sauva le prince.</P>
<P>J'ai lu avec plaisir, Monsieur, votre explication de la difficulté de

lumière dans un même foyer. Si vous n'y avez pas pu porter toute
la netteté desirable, je crois qu'on doit s'en prendre uniquement aux
ténebres de l'antiquité et à la briéveté de Justin lui même.</P>
<P>Rassuré par votre suffrage, je n'ai plus de crainte sur mon idée
touchant la mort de Catulle. Auparavant je la trouvois vraisemblable;

<HEAD>Mr. GIBBON to Mr. GESNER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE multitude of your employments affords at once the proof of your
own merit, of the justice done to it by the public, of my presumption, and
of your goodness. How enviable is the lot of that small number of supe∣rior
minds whose talents are equally adapted to promote the purposes either
of pleasure or utility? The discernment surely of those princes is worthy
of much applause, who, having ventured to dissipate the clouds of envy, ca∣lumny,
and frivolity, that usually surround thrones, render to the truly great
men among their subjects a justice which had been long done to them by
the impartial public, and reward their talents, by affording them new oppor∣tunities
to display them. These are but a small part of the reflections occa∣sioned
by your letter, and which, were I to consult my inclination only,
would extend to a great length; but my reason tells me, that I must be
<PB N="376" REF="397"/>
contented with assuring you, that you have filled with gratitude a man who
will always be proud of being called your scholar. I go shortly to England;
where, perhaps, I may find an opportunity of proving to you the sincerity
of my sentiments, at least of rendering my correspondence less tiresome.
My residence in London will give me a sort of local merit. I will send you
early intelligence of the labours and discoveries of our learned men, whose
example I am unable to imitate; and will expect to learn, in return, what
is so proper an object of curiosity, the occupations and studies of your col∣leagues
and disciples at Gottingen. At my return to London I propose to
myself a new pleasure in collecting all your works, which I will make it my
first business to procure; and for assisting me in this matter, must request that
you would give me the titles of all the curious pieces with which you have
enriched the republic of letters. My ignorance of many of them causes
both joy and shame. It can only be excused in consideration of my youth,
and the place from which this letter is dated.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="398"/>
If I venture to propose some new doubts, it is because you know better
than any one, that absolute submission is due only to reason, either real or
apparent. You will believe that my only motive for discussing your lessons
is to render myself worthy of them:</P>
<Q><L>"Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amorem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lucret. de Rer. Natur. L. iii. ver. 5. <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE>."</L></Q>
<P>After this apology, I must confess that I have still some remaining doubts
concerning the Piso to whom Horace addresses his Art of Poetry. You
think that the manner in which that poet speaks of Virgil does not prove the
latter to be still alive; because Horace does not oppose the dead to the living,
but the ancients to the moderns. I examined the passage again, and that
new perusal excited reflections which confirmed me more strongly in my
former opinion. Horace thought the Latin tongue too poor and barren, and
<PB N="378" REF="399"/>
deficient in words expressive of abstract ideas, which were unknown to Ro∣mulus'
companions, consisting of shepherds and robbers. This imperfection
had been remarked by others. Horace, wishing to remedy it, proposes
to the Virgils and Variuses, to co-operate with him in this design, by bor∣rowing
from the Greek many energetic terms and phrases which were want∣ing
in Latin. He does not justify a thing already done, but proposes a new
enterprise. The futurity which he looks to can only have a reference to
authors still alive. The Art of Poetry was therefore written before the year
of Rome seven hundred and thirty-five. This explanation agrees so well
with the poet's thought, that his opposition between the dead and living
poets, concludes with one of the justest and liveliest images that I ever
remember to have met with:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"—licuit semperque licebit</L>
<L>"Signatum praesenti notâ producere nomen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horat. de Art. Poet. ver. 59.</NOTE>."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The <HI>licuit</HI> has a reference to the Terences and the Ceciliuses, who were long
<PB N="379" REF="400"/>
dead; the <HI>licebit,</HI> in the future, to the Variuses and Virgils, who were still
alive, and might avail themselves of the maxim<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This explanation is the more probable, because Virgil appears in his works to value himself rather on reviving old words, than on borrowing new ones from the Greek. I doubt whether a single passage can be pointed out, in which he followed Horace's advice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>You say that Piso's eldest son might be ten years old when the Art of
Poetry was published; an age at which Grotius wrote verses. Grotius did
so; but how few boys of that age have not only the fire to write, but the
judgment to criticise poetry? It is not likely that Piso the father should
have children at the age of twenty. You well know the paucity of mar∣riages
under Augustus, which rendered the conjugal felicity of Germanicus
an example so much admired<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Suet. L. ii. c. 34.</NOTE>; pride, poverty<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. ii. c. 37.</NOTE>, and debauchery, deterred
<PB N="380" REF="401"/>
the Roman nobles from marriage, especially amidst the civil wars, which,
during Piso's youth, desolated the earth. Augustus' laws on that subject
only prove the greatness of the evil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hist. Rom. L. lvi. p. 570.</NOTE>; and Piso was thirty years old, before
the first of those laws was enacted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horat. Carm. Secular. v. 17, &amp;c. Torrent de Lege Juliâ ad Calc. Horat. p. 75, &amp;c.</NOTE>. If an ordinary generation is computed
at thirty-three years<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herodot. L. ii. Newton Chronol. Emendat. p. 41.</NOTE>, the generations under the first emperors ought rather
to be extended to forty, than reduced to twenty years. These, I acknow∣ledge,
are but probabilities; but in the science of criticism probabilities de∣stroy
possibilities, and are themselves destroyed by proofs. This principle
is not to be controverted. The authority of Porphyrio is of too little weight
among the learned to be the foundation of an argument; it might at best
help to prop an argument, otherwise well supported. The ancients do not
assign to him the first rank among Horace's commentators<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vid. Vitam Horat. sine nomine Autoris.</NOTE>; and the mo∣derns,
<PB N="381" REF="402"/>
particularly Mr. Dacier, find in him many errors. I do not see any
ground for your first hypothesis. If Piso had a son when he was thirty years
old, this son might be sixteen when Horace wrote his Art of Poetry; an age
which you think agrees with every quality required in him. Did you not
forget, in writing this sentence, that Horace died in seven hundred and forty-five,
when Piso himself was only forty years old?</P>
<P>2. I think it certain that Horace, in the third ode of his third book,
meant to show the Romans, that if their prince aspired to divine honours,
<HI>Viamque affectat Olympo,</HI> he well merited them by his exploits, which rivalled
those of the greatest heroes, Bacchus, Hercules, and Romulus, who, after
trampling on their human enemies, and appeasing the jealousy of the gods,
had opened for themselves a road to the palace of the immortals. But did
the poet also intend, by this ode, to resist and destroy the clamours of the
people concerning the infamous supper of the twelve gods? I think he did
not. 1. This design does not agree with chronology. Suetonius does not
tell us the date of this supper; but since Mark Antony mentioned it, in his
<PB N="382" REF="403"/>
letters to Augustus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suet. L. ii. c. 70.</NOTE>, it must have happened before the last quarrel of the tri∣umvirs.
According to Bentley<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bentley in Praefat. ad Horat.</NOTE>, whose opinion you adopt, Horace wrote
the third book of his odes in the forty-second and forty-third years of his
age; that is, in the seven hundred and twenty-eighth and seven hundred and
twenty-ninth years of Rome. An apology for Augustus' debaucheries,
written seven years after they happened, could have only served to revive the
memory of enormities, which the policy of that prince and the gratitude of
the Romans had long consigned to oblivion. 2. Augustus supped with
eleven men and women, who, as well as himself, were adorned with the
emblems of divinities. The poet seated Augustus at the table of the gods,
<HI>purpureo bibit ore nectar;</HI> but can we reasonably suppose that he meant to
place there the companions of his feast? This would have been no render
the honour too common; and his panegyric would have degenerated into a sa∣tire.
I agree with you, that it is rather desirable than necessary to discover the
<PB N="383" REF="404"/>
plan of an ode; the writers of Lyric poetry having always enjoyed the pri∣vilege
of soaring to heights, which, if admired by fancy, must not be
criticised by reason. This fault, if it be one, is compensated by great
beauties. The two first stanzas prove the wonderful efficacy of poetry
when combined with philosophy. The <HI>justum &amp; tenacem propositi virum</HI> is the
sage of the Stoics, their king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horat. Serm. L. i. Serm. iii. ver. 124.</NOTE>, and only happy man; all whose designs are
just, and inflexibly pursued<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cicero pro Murenae, c. 29. De la Mothe le Vayer, tom. i. p. 606, &amp;c. de la Vertu des Payens.</NOTE>. Such a being, exempt from passions and
prejudices, never casts his eyes on the tumults of human life, without ex∣claiming,
<Q><L>"O! curas hominum! O! quantum in rebus inane!"</L></Q>
To the disgrace of mankind, such a character never existed; but it is not
a small honour for the species, that such perfect virtue has been described and
relished. The climax is beautiful. The sage would resist the clamorous
<PB N="384" REF="405"/>
fury of a mad multitude; but this popular rage is often appeased as easily as
it is kindled. He would despise the threats of a furious tyrant: but the
hearts of tyrant sometimes relent with compassion. He would hear without
terror the raging tempest, which overpowers the cries of the wretched; but
fortune has often rescued victims from the boisterous waves. He would not
dread the thunder of Jupiter: here the trembling imagination pauses, fear∣ing
left the poet should either sink into meanness, or swell into bombast; be∣cause
it seems impossible to conceive a bolder image than the enraged master
of gods and men. But our fear is converted into admiration, when we
read <Q>he would sustain unterrified the crashing shock of the universe,
by which the elements, men, and gods are involved in one common
ruin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. L. vi. Epist. 20.</NOTE>.</Q> I stop here, lest my reflections should tire you; which, if they
do, it must be my fault. I shall have attained, however, my purpose,
which was to show the point of view under which I consider the most pro∣found
erudition. Regarded as a mean or instrument, it merits our highest
<PB N="385" REF="406"/>
admiration; but considered as an ultimate end, it is entitled to nothing but
contempt.</P>
<P>3. You remember, Sir, that famous passage of Velleius Paterculus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vell. Patere. L. ii. c. 125.</NOTE> which
has given so much trouble to the learned. It is as follows: * * * *
It seems unsusceptible of any meaning, and must be supposed either defec∣tive
or corrupt. All the critics, therefore, who have examined it, endeavour
to restore the text. Burerius, Acidalius, Gruter, Boeclerus, Heinsius, Bur∣man,
have, all of them, given conjectures more or less probable, which
I shall not here discuss. I shall rather submit an emendation of my own to
your judgment. Instead of the common reading, I would substitute <HI>Prisâ
antiquâque severitate,</HI> FUSUS <HI>ancipitia sibi tam re quam exemplo perniciosa.</HI> We
see at once that this small alteration produces a clear and distinct sense; and
<PB N="386" REF="407"/>
the correction may be proved to be equally conformable to the analogy of
the Latin tongue, and agreeable to the truth of history. The best gram∣marians
acknowledge that the Latin, not having a middle voice, admits of a
passive participle in an active signification<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Burman ad Vell. Paterc. L. ii. c. 97. Perizon. ad Sanct. Minerv. L. i. c. 15. n. 4.</NOTE>. Thus, <HI>juratus, punitus,</HI> some∣times
denote <HI>qui juravit, qui punivit.</HI> We find <HI>peragratus</HI> used in this
meaning by Velleius himself<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vell. Paterc. L. ii. c. 97.</NOTE>. <HI>Fusus</HI> may therefore, without impropriety,
denote the action of Drusus. History also favours this correction. Ac∣cording
to Tacitus, when Drusus arrived in the camp of the rebels, his or∣ders
were disobeyed, his offers suspected, the soldiers made him prisoner,
they insulted his friends, and waited only for a pretence to begin the slaughter.
Such were the dangers that threatened his person! <HI>Sibi ancipitia tam re.</HI> The
severity of the Roman discipline is well known. The generals were the gods
of the soldiers, and their orders received as oracles. But ancient maxims
were now overturned; and the sedition of the Pannonian legions created an
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. i. c. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="387" REF="408"/>
example most pernicious to posterity. Superstition, which does so much
evil, here did good: an eclipse of the moon frightened the soldiers, and
saved the life of the general.</P>
<P>I read with much pleasure your solution of the difficulty in Justin; and
admire your skill in extracting a regular narrative, by bringing the scattered
lights in authors to one focus. If any uncertainty still remains, it must be
ascribed to the darkness of antiquity and Justin's brevity.</P>
<P>Your suffrage removes all fear about the solidity of my conjecture con∣cerning
the death of Catullus. I formerly thought it probable, but begin
now to regard it as certain. I have the honour to remain, with the highest
consideration and most perfect esteem, yours, &amp;c.</P>

<P>This Letter, in the early hand-writing of Mr. GIBBON, (probably about
the time of his first leaving Lausanne,) seems to be under the assumed
character of a Swedish traveller, writing to a Swiss friend, delineating
the defects he discovered in the government of Berne. In pointing
out those defects he seems to have had the intention of suggesting
remedies; but, as he is entering on this topic, the manuscript ends
abruptly. The excellence of this curious paper will apologize for
its great length.</P>
<LETTER LANG="fre">
<P>NON, mon cher ami, je ne veux point etre cosmopolite. Loin de
moi ce titre fastueux, sous lequel nos philosophes cachent une
égale indifférence pour tout le genre humain. Je veux aimer ma
patrie, et pour aimer, il me faut des preférences: mais ou je me
trompe, ou mon coeur est susceptible de plus d'une. Quand j'aurois
tout sacrifié pour la Suede, mon pays natal, je ne me serois point
encore acquitté envers elle; je lui dois la vie et la fortune: mais
que cette vie seroit triste, que cette fortune me seroit à charge,
si, expatrié des ma tendre jeunesse, votre pays n'eut pas formé mon
<PB N="389" REF="410"/>
gout et ma raison à des moeurs moins grossières que les notres! Je
me montrerois indigne de ces bienfaits, s'il ne m'avoient pas inspiré la
plus vive reconnoissance. Aujourd'hui que la Suede, tranquille à l'abri
des loix, n'exige de ses enfans que de sentir leur bonheur, je puis,
sans l'offenser, jetter un regard sur le pays de Vaud, mon autre
patrie, me rejouir avec vous de ses avantages, et compatir à ses
maux.</P>
<P>Votre climat est beau, votre terroir fertile; vous avez pour le
commerce intérieur des facilités, dont il ne tient qu'à vous de pro∣siter.
Mais je considere plutôt les habitans, que l'habitation. On
va chercher les philosophes à Londres. Paris attire dans son sein
tous ceux qui n'aiment que la douceur de la société. Votre pays le
cede à ces deux capitales, la ou elles brillent; mais cependant il
réunit tous leurs avantages respectifs; il est le seul où tout à la fois
on ose penser, et on sache vivre. Que vous manque t'il? la liberté:
et privés d'elle, tout vous manque.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="411"/>
Cette vérité vous surprend, elle vous blesse. Pouvoir dire que
nous ne sommes pas libres, me repondez vous, prouve que nous le
sommes. Il le prouveroit peut être, si j'écrivois à Lausanne, ou plutôt
là même il ne prouveroit rien. Vos maîtres connoissent la maxime
du Cardinal Mazarin, de vous laisser parler, pourvu que vous les
laissiez agir. Ainsi le procès n'est point encore jugé.</P>
<P>Si j'écrivois pour le peuple je m'addresserois à ses passions; je le
ferois souvenir de cette maxime de tous les tems, que dans les repub∣liques,
ceux qui sont libres, sont plus libres, et ceux qui sont
esclaves, plus esclaves que partout ailleurs. Mais avec un ami tel
que vous, je ne dois chercher que la vérité, et n'employer que la
raison. Quand je compare votre état avec celui de vos voisins, c'est
avec plaisir que je le prononce heureux. Traversez votre lac et vos
montagnes, vous trouverez partout un peuple digne d'un meilleur
sort; sa raison abrutie par la superstition, le patrimoine de ses
peres, et le fruit de son industrie, en proye au partisan, ou au
<PB N="391" REF="412"/>
hussard. Sa vie sacrifiée à tout moment au caprice d'un seul
homme, qui, lorsqu'il entend parler de vingt milles de ses sem∣blables,
morts dans le service de son ambition, dira froidement, qu'ils
ont fait leur devoir.</P>
<P>Vous au contraire professez un Christianisme, ramené à la divine
pureté de son institution, enseigné par de dignes pasteurs, à qui on
permet de se faire aimer, de se faire respecter, mais non de se faire
craindre. Votre union avec le Corps Helvetique vous a assuré
depuis deux siecles une paix unique dans l'histoire. Vos impots
sont petits, l'administration douce. On n'entend point parler parmi
vous de ces sentences sans procès, sans crime, sans accusateur, qui
arrachent un citoyen du milieu de sa famille. L'on ne voit jamais
le souverain, on le sent rarement. Cependant si la liberté consiste
à n'être soumis qu'à de loix, dont l'objet est le bien commun de la
société, vous n'etes point libre.</P>

Quand la violence des uns, et la foiblesse des autres, ont rendu
nécessaires les sociétés civiles, il a fallu renoncer à cette indépendance
si chere, et si pernicieuse. Il a fallu que toutes les volontés particu∣lières
se fondissent dans une volonté générale; à laquelle des punitions
réglées obligeassent chaque citoyen de conformer ses actions. Qu'il
est délicat, ce pouvoir de fixer la volonté générale! En quelles mains
doit on le remettre? Sera-ce à un monarque dès-lors absolu. Je
sais que l'intérêt bien entendu du prince ne se peut séparer d'avec
celui de son peuple, et qu'en travaillant pour lui, il travaille pour
soi même. Tel est le langage de la philosophie. Mais ce langage
n'est pas un de ceux que les précepteurs font étudier aux rois; et si
un heureux naturel leur en donne quelque idée, leurs passions, ou
celles d'un ministre, d'un confesseur, d'une maîtresse, l' effacent bien∣tot.
Le peuple gémit, mais il faut qu'il ait gémi long tems, avant
que son maître s'apperçoive qu'il est de l'intérêt d'un berger de con∣server
son troupeau. Il faut donc que le pouvoir législatif soit par∣tagé.

Un conseil dont les membres s'éclairent et se contiennent les
uns les autres, paroît en être un dépositaire bien choisi. Mais la
liberté attache à ce conseil une condition fondamentale. Elle veut
que chaque ordre des citoyens, chaque partie de l'état, y ait ses re∣présentans
intéressés à s'opposer à toute loi qui seroit nuisible à ses
droits, ou contraire à son bonheur, puisqu'eux mêmes en sentiroient
les premiers, les mauvais effets. Une telle assemblée fera rarement
des fautes grossières, et si elle paye quelquefois le tribut à l'humanité,
elle peut rougir de ses erreurs, et les réparer aussi tot. Ce portrait
est il le votre? J'entre dans votre pays, je vois deux nations dis∣tinguées
par leurs droits, leurs occupations, et leurs moeurs. L'une,
composée de trois cens familles, est née pour commander; l'autre, de
cent mille, n'est formée que pour obéir. Toutes les prétensions hu∣miliantes
des monarques héréditaires se renouvellent à votre égard,
et deviennent encore plus humiliantes de la part de vos égaux. La
comparaison de vos deux états, vous est trop facile. Rien ne vous
aide à l'éloigner.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="415"/>
Un conseil de trois cens personnes décide de tous vos intérêts en
dernier ressort, et si ses intérêts et les votres ne sont pas d'accord, quì
doit l'emporter? Non seulement ce sénat est législateur, mais il exé∣cute
ses propres loix. Cette union de deux puissances qu'on ne devoit
jamais réunir, les rend chacune plus formidables. Quand elles sont
séparées, la puissance législative redoute les résolutions violentes; elles
seroient inutiles, si l'on n'armoit pas les mains de la puissance qui les
doit exécuter, et cette puissance est toujours sa rivale, et son contre∣poids.
Mais ce n'est pas assez que cette union aiguise le glaive de
de l'autorité publique, elle le remet encore dans un plus petit nombre
de mains: dans le dernier siecle le grand conseil de Berne se renouvel∣loit
lui même; c'étoit déja un pas vers l'oligarchie: pourquoi ex∣clure
des élections le corps de la Bourgeoisie? Alors même le gou∣vernement
s'appuyoit sur un fondement assez étroit. Bientot des
inconveniens se firent sentir; la brigue, la vénalité, la débauche, sig∣naloient
l'entrée des citoyens dans le conseil souverain, et les riches
<PB N="395" REF="416"/>
ambitieux donnoient tout, pour pouvoir tout invahir. Une députa∣tion
révocable de vingt six conseillers, établie dès l'enfance de la ré∣publique,
pour veiller à l'exécution des loix, devint chargée du soin
de remplir les places de ce grand conseil dont elle-même tiroit son
origine. On y ajoutoit seize sénateurs choisis de la manière la
plus favorable aux factieux. Ils possedoient d'abord leur pouvoir
collectivement, mais peu à peu l'intérêt particulier leur sit entendre
qu'il valoit mieux permettre à chacun de nommer son fils, son
gendre, et son parent. Les familles puissantes qui dominoient alors
dans le sénat, y dominent encore. Les de Wattevilles, et les
Steiguers, y remplissent une trentaine de places. Le commerce inté∣ressé
de bienfaits, où l'on passe dans le petit conseil par les suffrages de
ses parens, pour faire entrer de nouveaux parens dans le grand conseil,
à déja reduit le nombre dans familles qui siegent dans celui-ci, à en∣viron
quatre vingt. Ces maisons souveraines ont un égal mépris pour
ceux que le droit naturel auroit du rendre leurs concitoyens, et
<PB N="396" REF="417"/>
pour ceux qui le sont par la constitution de l'état. Il manque même
aux premiers une ressource que les monarques les plus absolus, n'ont
pas osé ôter à leurs sujets; je veux parler de ces tribunaux reconnus
du souverain, et révérés du peuple, pour etre l'organe de la patrie, et
les dépositaires des loix. Toutes les volontés du prince, qui doivent
être obéies, le sont plus facilement, quand les sujets voyent combien
elles sont raisonnables, puisqu'elles ont passé par l'examen de ces
magistrats, qu'on ne peut ni tromper, ni séduire, ni intimider.
Aussi répondent ils à cette considération, par une résistance respectu∣euse,
mais déterminée contre l'oppression, où ils étalent tout ce que
la raison, la liberté, et l'éloquence peuvent inspirer à des citoyens
zelés. C'est principalement dans ces tribunaux paisibles que je trouve
ces qualités. Privés d'armes, ils ne doivent leur pouvoir qu'à leur
probité, et à leur éloquence. Est il étonnant que ceux, qui n'ont que
cette instrument, s'appliquent le plus à le cultiver? Quelles leçons
pour les rois, que les remontrances du Parlement de Paris? Quels
modeles pour le peuple que la conduite des Mandarins de la Chine?
Frappé par un tribunal de cette espece, le monarque ne peut mécon∣noître
<PB N="397" REF="418"/>
les gémissemens de la patrie. Les citoyens y apprennent qu'ils
ont une patrie; ils attachent à l'aimer, à étudier ses loix, à se former
à toutes les vertus publiques. Elles mûrissent dans le silence, l'occa∣sion
les développe, ou elles se font l'occasion. Les états du Pays de
Vaud, respectables sous les Rois de Bourgogne, et sous les Ducs de
Savoye, étoient ce tribunal. Composés de la noblesse, du clergé, et
des députés des villes principales, ils s'assembloient tous les ans à
Moudon. C'étoit le conseil perpétuel du prince. Sans leur con∣sentement,
il ne pouvoit, ni faire de nouvelles loix, ni établir de nou∣veaux
impots. Si j'étois sur les lieux j'établirais ces droits, par vos
monumens les plus authentiques. Tout éloigné que j'en suis, je ne
erains pas d'appeller à leur témoignage. Il me reste toujours une
preuve moins sensible pour le peuple, mais aussi décisive pour les gens
de lettres: c'est l'analogie. Les Barbares du cinquième siecle jette∣rent
par toute l'Europe, les racines de ce gouvernement que Charle∣magne
établit dans les Pays Bas, la France, l'Italie, la Suisse, et
<PB N="398" REF="419"/>
l'Allemagne. Quelques évenemens, les degrés, et les tems ou les
arrière-fiefs se formerent des fiefs, ou le' clergé acquit des terres sei∣gneuriales,
ou les villes acheterent leurs affranchissemens, y appor∣terent
de légères différences. Mais le fond de cette constitution est
demeuré dans toutes les révolutions, et rien de plus libre que ce
fonds. Ces états, leurs membres, et leurs droits se conserverent
toujours, et partout ils étoient les mêmes.</P>
<P>Je vous entends, mon ami, qui m'interrompez. Je vous ai écouté,
me dites vous, avec patience: mais que voulez vous conclure de ce
tableau de notre gouvernement? Bien ou mal construit, nous n'en
ressentons que des effets salutaires, et vos conseils, vos états, auroient
de la peine à nous dégouter de nos magistrats anciens, pour nous faire
essayer des nouveautés.</P>
<P>Arretez, Monsieur; je vous ai parlé en homme libre, et vous me
répondez dans le langage de la servitude. Arretez. En convenant
pour un moment de votre bonheur, de qui le tenez vous? de la con∣stitution?
<PB N="399" REF="420"/>
Vous n'osez pas le dire. C'est done du prince? Les
Romains en devoient un plus grand à Titus. Ils étoient cependant
de vils esclaves. Brutus vous auroit appris que, dans un état despo∣tique,
le prince peut quelquefois vouloir de bien: mais que dans les
états libres, il ne peut que le vouloir. La félicité actuelle du citoyen
et de l'esclave, est souvent égale, mais celle du dernier est précaire,
puisqu'elle est fondée sur les passions des hommes, pendant que celle
du premier est assurée. Elle est liée avec les loix qui contiennent
également ces mêmes passions dans le souverain et dans le paysan.</P>
<P>Mais malheureusement on ne trouve que trop de choses à re∣prendre
dans votre administration politique. Je vais détailler des
sautes, des negligences, des oppressions. Vous vous récrierez sur
ma malignité, mais en secret votre esprit grossira le catalogue de
cent articles que j'aurai ou ignorés ou oubliés. Il est du devoir du
souverain de faire jouir son peuple de tous les avantages de la société
civile. Des guerres entreprises pour sa défense, l'en détourneront
<PB N="400" REF="421"/>
quelquefois; mais dèsque le calme renait dans ses états, des établisse∣mens
utiles, et de sages loix, la religion, les moeurs, les sciences, le
commerce, les manufactures, l'agriculture, et la police, méritent toute
son attention, et l'en récompenseront avec usure. Sur ces principes
jugeons le sénat de Berne. Il a été maître du Pays de Vaud de∣puis
l'an 1536. Quand je considere ce qu'étoient alors la France,
l'Angleterre, la Hollande, ou l'Allemagne, j'ai de la peine à me per∣suader
qu'elles étoient les mêmes pays que ceux qui portent aujourd'∣hui
ces noms. De barbares, ils sont devenus civilisés; d'ignorans,
éclairés; et de pauvres, riches. Je vois des villes où il y avoit des
déserts, et les forêts défrichées se sont converties en champs fer∣tiles.
Leurs princes, et leurs ministres, un Henri quatre, un Sully,
un Colbert, une Elizabeth, un de Wit, un Frederic-Guillaume, ont
opéré ces merveilles. La perspective du Pays de Vaud n'est point
aussi riante. Les arts languissent, faute de ces récompenses que le
prince seul peut donner; nul commerce, nulles manufactures, nuls
<PB N="401" REF="422"/>
projets utiles pour le pays; un engourdissement général qui regne
partout. Cependant les princes dont je viens de parler n'avoient
que des momens pour ces objets, où les Bernois ont eu des siecles.
Que n'auroient ils pas fait, ces grands hommes, rarement tranquilles
sur le trône, si pendant deux cens douze ans, ils n'eussent eu que
des voisins pacifiques, et des peuples soumis? Je m'en rapporte à
vous même. Indiquez moi quelque établissement vraiment utile que
vous deviez au souverain. Mais ne m'indiquez pas l'académie de
Lausanne, fondée par des vues de dévotion, dans la chaleur d'une
réformation, negligée depuis, et toujours académie, quoique un digne
magistrat de cette ville, proposàt de l'ériger en université.</P>
<P>Non ce n'est point une politique peu eclairée qui fait agir vos
maîtres. Je connois trop leur habileté. Mais un monarque aime
également tous ses sujets. Les citoyens d'une ville capitale voyent
au contraire d'un oeil jaloux l'agrandissement des provinces. Si elles
s'élevent, disent ils, nous tombons. Nos égales pour les lumières et
<PB N="402" REF="423"/>
les richesses, elles voudroient bientôt l'être en pouvoir. Rappellez
vous l'an 1685. La mauvaise politique de Louis XIV. expatria la
partie la plus industrieuse de ses sujets; une multitude se réfugia
dans le Pays de Vaud. Il etoit prochain, il etoit François. Ils ne∣demandoient
qu'un azile, et l'auroient payé au poids de l'or par les
richesses, et les arts plus précieux que les richesses, qu'ils vous appor∣toient.
Mais ici la politique partiale des Bernois s'épouvanta. <Q>Si
nous faisons participer ces fugitifs à notre droit de Bourgeoisie,
la fortune nous sera commune; mais comment élever des mortels
au rang des dieux? Si nous les laissons confondus parmi nos
sujets, nos sujets recueilleront le fruit de leur industrie.</Q> Ils con∣clurent
enfin avec l'ambassadeur de Porsenna—</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"—Qu'il vaut mieux, qu'un roi sur le trône affermi</L>
<L>"Commande à des sujets, malheureux, mais soumis,</L>
<L>"Que d'avoir à dompter, au sein de l'abondance</L>
<L>"D'un peuple trop heureux l'indocile arrogance."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="403" REF="424"/>
Ces exilés las d'essuyer des refus, où ils devoient s'attendre à des
prières, passerent en Hollande, en Prusse, et en Angleterre, où les
souverains savoient mieux profiter de cette occasion unique. Il en
resta une partie dans le Pays de Vaud, mais c'étoit la partie la plus
pauvre, et la plus fainéante, qui n'avoit ni le moyen, ni la vo∣lonté
d'aller plus loin.</P>
<P>`A peine ces malheureux commençoient ils à oublier leurs souf∣frances
passées, que l'expérience leur sit sentir, que pour fuir les
persécutions, il faut fuir les hommes. La partie souveraine de l'état
avoit succé avec le lait, toute la dureté du systême de Calvin, théo∣logien
atrabilaire qui aimoit trop la liberté, pour souffrir que les Chré∣tiens
portassent d'autres fers que les siens. D'ailleurs sa conformité
avec les idées d'un célebre philosophe, intéressoit l'honneur du nom
Allemand à le soutenir. Comme les sentimens s'étoient adoucis dans
le Pays de Vaud, en proportion avec les moeurs, il falloit y envoyer
des formulaires, et des inquisiteurs, destinés à faire autant d'hypo∣crites
<PB N="404" REF="425"/>
qu'ils pourroient, non à la vérité par le fer et le feu, mais par
les menaces et les privations d'emploi.</P>
<P>En soutenant les droits de l'humanité, je n'outre point les maxi∣mes
de la tolérance. Je veux bien que le magistrat ne distribue
les récompenses du public, qu'à ceux qui enseignent la religion du
public. Je ne lui défens pas même de contenir dans le silence ces
novateurs trop hardis qui voudroient éclairer le peuple sur cer∣tains
objets où l'erreur fait son bonheur. Mais que le souverain se
prêtant avec chaleur aux minuties théologiques, décide des questions
qu'on ne peut décider, assurement il est absurde. Qu'imposant des
confessions de foi, il ne laisse à des pasteurs vieillis, dans le ministere, et
qui ne demandoient qu'à se taire, que le choix du mensonge ou de
la mendicité, assurement il est injuste. Mais la persécution cessa.—
Qui la fit cesser? Un sentiment de honte? les larmes des sujets? ou
bien la crainte qu'inspira l'entreprise d'un Davel, enthousiaste il est
vrai, mais enthousiaste pour le bien public? Encore même il regne à
Lausanne une inquisition sourde. Les noms d'Arminien, et de Soci∣nien
<PB N="405" REF="426"/>
remplissent encore ces lettres ou de tres honnêtes gens rendent
compte à leurs protecteurs des sentimens de leurs concitoyens; et c'est
suivant ces indices que les places se distribuent.</P>
<P>Je viens, non pas d'épuiser, mais d'indiquer quelques défauts qui
se trouvent dans votre puissance législative. Passons à l'exécutrice.
Celle-ci est la force publique, comme l'autre est la volonté publique.
Mais un seul corps, un seul homme, peut délibérer et décider pour
toute une nation. Il ne peut tout seul agir pour elle. L'administra∣tion
politique, composée d'un nombre infini de branches, veut qu'un
grand nombre d'officiers, soumis les uns aux autres, s'employent à
faire jouer la machine à laquelle le maître ne peut que donner le
mouvement général. Les honneurs, et les avantages, que les loix
attachent à ces emplois, doivent être ouverts à tous les citoyens, que
leurs talens et leur éducation ont mis en état de les remplir. Les
fardeaux leur sont communs à tous, les recompenses doivent l'etre
aussi. Un gouvernement monarchique satisfait aisement à ces justes
<PB N="406" REF="427"/>
prétensions. `Al'exception de quelques courtisans, qui approchent la
personne du prince d'assez près, pour substituer la flatterie aux ser∣vices,
tous ses sujets lui sont égaux. Dèsqu'un homme a du mérite,
ou, si l'on veut de la faveur, on ne lui demande point s'il est Nor∣mand
ou Provençal. D'Epernon étoit Gascon; Richelieu, Champe∣nois;
Mazarin, Romain. Mais dans les républiques aristocratiques,
les souverains composés de toute une ville veulent être législateurs en
corps, et partager entre eux en détail tous les emplois considérables.
Les talens, les lumières, dans votre Pays, sont inutiles pour quicon∣que
n'est pas né Bernois, et dans un autre sens ils sont également
inutiles pour qui l'est. Le sujet se voit condamné par sa naissance à
ramper dans un honteuse obscurité. Le désespoir le saisit; il neglige
ce qui ne le peut mener à rien, et le grand homme ne devient qu'un
homme agréable. Si je parlais de faire participer les sujets aux
Bailliages, les Bernois crieroient au sacrilege; les Bailliages sont le
<PB N="407" REF="428"/>
patrimoine de l'état, et nous sommes l'état. Il est vrai qu'on vous
laisse les Lieutenances Baillivales; mais vous savez assez qu'on y mêle
certaines stipulations, de façon que, si le nouveau magistrat ne vit
pas quelque tems, sa famille perd au marché.</P>
<P>Privés de ressources, que reste il aux gentilhommes du Pays de
Vaud? le service étranger. Mais on n'a pas manqué de leur
rendre cette carrière des plus épineuses, et de leur y fermer l'accès des
grades un peu élevés. Je ne dirai rien du brilliant service de France.
Les dépenses sont inévitables, et la paye si modique que l'enseigne se∣ruine,
le capitaine vit à peine, et même le colonel ne peut amasser.
Ainsi vous devez bénir le soin paternel du souverain qui a dressé
toutes les capitulations, de manière à ne vous point introduire en ten∣tation.
Ne parlons que du service des Etats Généraux, service plus
utile que riant, ou l'on s'ennuye et s'enrichit. Par le traité de 1712,
le Canton de Berne accorda vingt quatre compagnies à leurs Hautes
<PB N="408" REF="429"/>
Puissances, et promit de permettre qu'on en sit toujours des recrues
dans leurs états. Seize compagnies étoient destinées aux Bernois, et
les souverains partageoient avec leurs sujets les huit autres com∣pagnies,
dont on daignoit laisser l'entrée ouverte à ceux ci: ainsi
à ne supposer le crédit des Bernois qu'égal à celui des sujets, pour
parvenir à ces huit dernières compagnies, ce peuple roi en possede∣roit
toujours vingt, sur vingt quatre. La proportion est honnête, si
l'on fait attention qu'il y a dans le Canton près de cent mille
hommes en état de porter les armes, dont il n'y en a pas huit cens,
bourgeois de Berne. D'ailleurs les petits bourgeois, à qui ce nom
seul inspire de la fierté, aiment mieux croupir dans la misère à
Berne, que de se faire par leur travail un état vraiment respectable.
Ainsi dans toutes ces troupes, je doute qu'on puisse trouver cinquante
Bernois qui ne soient par officiers.</P>
<P>Ces malheurs, me dites vous, ne sont que pour les gentilhommes;
c'est à dire, pour la partie la plus respectable, mais la moins nom∣breuse,
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
des citoyens. Ils s'évanouissent dans ces maximes générales
et égales que vous venez d'établir. La tyrannie de vos Baillis s'y
évanouit elle aussi? Le peuple, nom si cher à l'humanité, en sent
tout le joug. Je ne vous conterai point des histoires de leurs op∣pressions.
Vous me chicaneriez sur la vérité des faits, et puis vous
me diriez, qu'il ne faut jamais conclure du particulier au général,
et vous auriez raison. Il vaut mieux faire sentir l'étendue de leur
pouvoir, et laisser à votre connoissance du coeur humain, à juger de
l'usage qu'ils en font. Chaque Bailli est à la fois chef de la justice,
de la milice, des finances, et de la réligion. Comme juge, il décide
sans appel jusqu'à la somme de cent francs, somme tres modique
pour vous, mais qui fait la fortune d'un paysan; et il décide seul,
car ses assesseurs, n'ont pas voix pondérative. Il donne, ou plutôt
il vend, presque tous les emplois dans son bailliage. Si l'on veut
appeller de ses sentences, il n'y a plus de tribunal à Moudon; il faut
aller à Berne, et quel paysan veut se ruiner à la poursuite de la
<PB N="410" REF="431"/>
justice? S'il cherche encore à faire punir son tyran, il demande
l'entrée en conseil. L'Avoyer l'accorde, peut être avec beaucoup
de difficulté, et à force de fatigues et de dépenses il parvient à pouvoir
plaider devant un tribunal lié avec son baillif par le sang, et plus
encore par une conformité de forfaits, ou d'intérêts.</P>
<P>Votre pays est épuisé par les impots, tout modiques qu'ils sont.
Dévelopons cette idée. Pendant que les pays le plus riches de
l'Europe s'abyment de dépenses et de dettes, et mettent en oeuvre des
moyens qui feroient trembler le plus hardi dissipateur, le Canton de
Berne est le seul qui amasse des trésors. Le secret de l'état est si bien
gardé, qu'il est difficile de le deviner. Stanian, ambassadeur d'Angle∣terre
à Berne, qui avoit un esprit d'observation et de grandes facilités
pour se bien informer, estimoit, il y a quarante ans, les sommes qu'il
avoit dans les fonds publics de Londres à trois cens milles livres ster∣ling,
ou sept millions, et tout ce qui étoit resté dans le trésor de
Berne, ou dispersé dans les autres banques de l' Europe, à dix huit
<PB N="411" REF="432"/>
cens mille livres sterling, ou quarante trois millions. On peut
croire que ces trésors n'ont pas diminués depuis l'an 1722. Le
moyen que le Canton employe pour s'enrichir est très simple. Il
dépense beaucoup moins qu'il ne reçoit. Mais que reçoit il? Je
l'ignore; mais je vais tacher de le deviner. Les douze bailliages du
Pays de Vaud rendent dans leurs six ans, à peu pres cinq cens mille
livres de Suisse, les uns portant les autres. Le revenu de douze,
peut donc monter à un million de livres de rente. J'ai toujours
entendu dire que les Baillis prennent le dix pour cent sur les
revenus du souverain. Le voilà donc ce revenu d'un million par
année. En rabattant les cent mille livres des Baillis, je compterais
encore cent mille écûs pour les charges de l'état, ce qui n'est point une
supposition batie en l'air. Les autres deux cens mille ecûs, qui dans
un autre pays, fourniroient à l'entretien d'une cour et d'une armée,
dont les dépenses feroient retomber sur la terre la rosée qui en étoit
tirée, vont ici s'enfouir dans les coffres du souverain, ou se disperser
<PB N="412" REF="433"/>
dans les banques publiques, et précaires de l'Europe, pour etre un
jour une proye à l'infidélité d'un commis, ou à l'ambition d'un con∣querant.
Cette peste continuelle des especes éteint l'industrie, em∣pêche
tout effort, qui ne se peut faire sans argent, et appauvrit in∣sensiblement
le pays.</P>
<P>Tels sont vos maux, Monsieur. Eh bien! me repondez vous,
n'avez vous sondé, nos playes que pour en aigrir la douleur? Quel
conseil nous donnez vous? Aucun, si vous ne m'avez pas déja
prévenu. Il y a une voye que je puis vous conseiller, c'est celle de
la remontrance. Mais il y a des maux tellement enracinés dans la
constitution d'un état, que Platon lui même n'eut pas espéré du succès
pour une pareille députation. Ne tiendront ils pas contre les remon∣trances,
eux qui ont pu tenir contre deux cens and de fidélité et de
services? Il y a un autre remede plus prompt, plus entier, plus
glorieux: Guillaume Tell vous l'eût conseillé; mais je ne vous le con∣seille
point. Je sais que l'esprit du citoyen, comme celui de la cha∣rité,
souffre beaucoup, et espere longtems. Il a raison. Il connoit
<PB N="413" REF="434"/>
les malheurs attachés à la soumission. Il ignore ceux que la résis∣tance
pourroit entrainer. Vous, qui me connoissez, Monsieur, vous
savez combien je respecte ces principes amis de la paix et des
hommes. Tribun séditieux, je ne chercherai jamais à faire secouer au
peuple le joug de l'autorité, pour le conduire du murmure, à la sedi∣tion;
de la sedition, à l'anarchie; et de l'anarchie, peut être, au
despotisme.</P>
<P>Cependant avec la franchise, qui a partout conduit ma plume, je
vais détruire quelques monstres de Romans, qui vous peuvent effrayer.
Que vous préfériez le parti de l'entreprise ou celui du répos, je vou∣drois
que ce fut la raison, et non le préjuge, qui vous dictât ce parti.</P>
<P>Les Bernois ont les droits sur votre obéissance; vous craignez de
leur faire une injustice en la retirant.</P>
</LETTER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 LANG="eng" TYPE="translation">
<PB N="388" REF="409"/>
<P>No; my dear friend, I will not be a citizen of the world; I reject with
scorn that proud title, under which our philosophers conceal an equal indif∣ference
for the whole human race. I will love my country; and to love it
above all others, there must be reasons for my preference: but, if I am not
mistaken, my heart is susceptible of affection for more countries than one.
Did I sacrifice all to Sweden, I should only pay my debt of gratitude to the
land in which I was born, and to which I owe my life and fortune. Yet
life and fortune would have been but melancholy burthens, if, after my ba∣nishment
from home in early youth, your country had not formed my taste
<PB N="389" REF="410"/>
and reason, and taught me more refined morals than our own. I should
prove myself unworthy of this goodness, did it not inspire me with the live∣liest
gratitude: and now that Sweden, enjoying tranquillity under the pro∣tection
of laws, requires nothing from its subjects but a just sense of their
happiness, I may direct my attention, without offence, to the Pais de Vaud,
my second country; rejoicing with you in its advantages, or commiserating
its misfortunes.</P>
<P>You enjoy a fine climate, a fertile soil, and have conveniencies for internal
commerce, from which great benefit might be derived. But I consider the
people rather than their territory. Philosophy flourishes in London; Paris
is the centre of those attracted by the allurements of polished society. Your
country, though inferior to those capitals, yet unites in some measure their
respective advantages: since it is the only country whose inhabitants, while
they think freely and boldly, live politely and elegantly. What then is
wanting? Liberty; and deprived of it, you have lost your all.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="411"/>
This truth surprises and offends you. The right of complaining, you
answer, that we are not free, is a proof of our liberty. If I wrote at Lau∣sanne,
the argument would have weight; yet even there, it would not be
convincing; for your masters are not ignorant of Cardinal Mazarine's maxim,
and are willing to allow you to talk, provided you allow them to act; so that
the process is not yet determined.</P>
<P>If I wrote for the people I would speak to their passions, and hold a lan∣guage
repeated in all ages, that under republics, those who are free are more
free, and those who are enslaved, more enslaved, than under any other form
of government. But with a friend like you I would seek only the maxims
of truth, and employ only the arguments of reason. When I compare
your condition with that of surrounding nations, I can sincerely congratulate
you on your happiness. Whenever we quit the neighbourhood of your lake
and mountains, we find men who, though worthy of a better fate, are
plunged in the most abject superstition; whose property and industry are the
<PB N="391" REF="412"/>
spoils of a licentious soldiery; and whose lives are ready every moment to
be sacrificed to the caprice of one man, who, when he hears that twenty
thousand of his fellow-creatures have fallen sacrifices to his ambition, is
contented with saying coldly, "they have done their duty."</P>
<P>You, on the contrary, enjoy a Christianity brought back to the purity of
its original principles, taught publicly by worthy ministers, who are loved
and respected, but who have it not in their power to become the objects of
fear. Your connection with the Swiss cantons has preserved to you the
blessings of peace two centuries; a thing unexampled in history. Your
taxes are moderate; and the public administration is gentle. You have not
to complain of those arbitrary sentences, which, without any form of legal
procedure, without an accuser, and without a crime, have been known to
tear citizens from the bosoms of their families. The sovereign is never
seen; the weight of his authority is rarely felt: yet if liberty consists in
being subject to laws, which impartially consult the interests of all the mem∣bers
of the community, you do not enjoy that blessing.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="413"/>
When the injustice of some, and the weakness of others, showed the ne∣cessity
for civil society, individuals were obliged to renounce their beloved,
but pernicious, independence. All particular wills were melted down into
the general will of the public; by which, under the sanction of definite pu∣nishments,
men became bound to regulate their conduct. But it is a matter
of the utmost delicacy to determine with whom that general will ought to
be deposited. Shall it reside in the breast of a prince, who thereby be∣comes
absolute? I know that the true interests of a prince can never be
separated from those of his people, and that in exerting himself for their be∣nefit,
he labours for his own. This is the language of philosophy, but it is
seldom spoken by the preceptors of princes; and if the latter sometimes
read it in their own hearts, the impression is speedily effaced by contrary
passions, in themselves, their confessors, their ministers, or mistresses. The
groans of the people are not soon heard; and their master learns only by a
fatal experience, that it is the interest of a shepherd to preserve his flock.
The legislative power, therefore, cannot safely be entrusted to a single per∣son.
<PB N="393" REF="414"/>
A council, whose members mutually instruct, and mutually check
each other, appears to be its proper depository. But in this council one
condition is essentially requisite. It must consist of deputies from every or∣der
in the state, interested by their own safety in opposing every regulation
inconsistent with the happiness of that order to which they belong. Such a
council will rarely be guilty of gross errors; and should this sometimes hap∣pen,
it will soon blush for, and repair them. Is this the picture of your
legislature? When I survey your country, I behold two nations, distinctly
characterised by their rights, employments, and manners: the one, con∣sisting
of three hundred families, born to command; the other, consisting of
an hundred thousand, doomed to submission. The former are invested, as a
body, with all the prerogatives of hereditary monarchs, which are the more
humiliating to you their subjects, because they belong to men apparently
your equals. The comparison between yourselves and them is made every
moment; no circumstance tends to conceal it from your fancy.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="415"/>
A council of three hundred persons is the sovereign umpire of your dearest
interests, which will always be sacrificed when they clash with their own.
This council is invested with the executive, as well as the legislative, power;
two branches of authority which can never be united, without rendering each of
them too formidable to the subject. When they belong to different persons,
or assemblies, the legislature will not venture to form violent resolutions,
because these would be of no avail, unless they were carried into execution
by another power, always its rival, and often its antagonist. The sword of
authority is not only sharpened by this union, but is thereby confined to a
smaller number of hands. In the last century the great council of Bern be∣gan
to elect its own members; which was a great step towards oligarchy,
since it excluded from elections the citizens at large, and thereby narrowed the
basis of the government. But this arrangement was liable to other inconve∣niencies.
Intrigue, venality, and debauchery signalised the admission of citi∣zens
into the sovereign council; and ambitious men squandered their wealth,
<PB N="395" REF="416"/>
that they might purchase a right to indulge their rapacity. A committee of
six counsellors, established in the infancy of the republic, to watch the exe∣cution
of the laws, and whose offices were held at pleasure, became entrusted
with the power of naming the members of the grand council, by which this
committee itself was appointed. Its number was augmented by sixteen se∣nators,
chosen in the manner most favourable to the designs of faction. They
exercised their power at first collectively, but by degrees they came to un∣derstand
that their particular interests would be better promoted by each
naming his son, son-in-law, or kinsman. The powerful families which then
commanded the senate, still rule in it at present. Thirty places are filled by
the Wattevilles and Steiguers. This selfish traffic, by which the members of
the little council are elected by the great council, consisting of their own rela∣tions,
that they may name other relations to seats in the great council, has re∣duced
the number of families, which have a right to sit in the latter, to nearly
fourscore. These princely families look down with equal contempt on those
who are their fellow-citizens by the law of nature, and those who were ren∣dered
<PB N="396" REF="417"/>
such by the constitution of their country. The former class is deprived
of a resources which the most absolute princes have seldom ventured to wrest
from their subjects; I mean those courts of justice acknowledged by the
prince, and revered by the people, as the organs of public opinion, and the
depositories of the laws. The commands of the sovereign are obeyed with
cheerfulness only when their propriety is confirmed by the approbation of
those tribunals, whose members it has been found difficult either to deceive,
to seduce, or to intimidate. Their resistance to oppression is respectful, but
firm; and in exerting it, they display that warmth of eloquence with which
reason and liberty inspire good citizens. In the members of those peaceful
tribunals, such qualities appear in their greatest lustre. Destitute of arms,
their whole strength lies in their talents and their probity. What noble
lessons to kings have been given by the parliament of Paris? What excel∣lent
examples to subjects are set by the Mandarines of China? Monarchs
<HI>must</HI> hear the groans of their people, when such respectable bodies of men
<PB N="397" REF="418"/>
are their organs. The people too learn that they have a country, which
they will begin to love, to study its laws, and to form themselves to public
virtues. These virtues ripen silently; they are exerted when an opportunity
offers; and sometimes they will make an opportunity for their own exhibi∣tion.
In the Païs de Vaud, which was equally respectable under the kings
of Burgundy and the dukes of Savoy, the states formed such a tribunal.
They were composed of the nobility, clergy, and deputies from the principal
cities, which annually assembled at Moudon, and formed the perpetual
council of the prince, without whose consent he could neither enact new
laws, nor impose new taxes. Were I on the spot, I could prove the exist∣ence
of those rights by your most authentic records. At a distance I can
only appeal to their testimony, and employ an analogical proof, which will
be sufficiently convincing to men of letters. The Barbarians, who over∣flowed
Europe in the fifth century, every where laid the foundation of that
form of government which Charlemagne established in the Low Countries,
France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. The different modes of tenure
<PB N="398" REF="419"/>
which were at different times introduced, the various degrees of dependance
which one fief came to have on another, the acquisition of lordships by the
clergy, and the purchase of franchises by cities; all these circumstances occa∣sioned
but slight differences in the ground-work of the constitution, which
remained unalterably founded on a firm basis of liberty. The states, their
members, and their rights, were invariably maintained; remaining uniformly
the same at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P>I think that I hear you, my friend, interrupting me. Hitherto, you say,
I have listened to you with patience; but what is your conclusion from this
picture of our government? Whatever defects there may be in its prin∣ciples,
we have experienced its salutary consequences; and the states and
assemblies which you so much commend, will not easily make us abolish our
ancient magistracies, in order to try innovations.</P>
<P>It is time, Sir, to pause; I spoke to you as became a freeman, and you
answer me in the language of slavery. Let us admit for a moment your
prosperity; to whom do you owe it? You will not answer, to the constitu∣tion.
<PB N="399" REF="420"/>
It is due then to your rulers. The Romans owed a prosperity yet
greater to Titus; but still remained the basest of slaves. Brutus would have
taught you that a despot may sometimes choose to promote the public hap∣piness;
but that the magistrates of a free people can have no other wish.
The advantages actually enjoyed by a citizen and a slave may be the same;
but those of the latter are precarious, having no other foundation than the
changeable passions of men; whereas those of the former are secure, being
solidly supported on those laws which curb guilty passions in the prince as
well as in the peasant.</P>
<P>But unfortunately too many faults may be sound in your public admini∣stration.
I shall give you the black list of omissions and oppressions, which,
notwithstanding that you will exclaim against my malignity, your own me∣mory
will augment by an hundred articles, which I may be either ignorant
of, or forget to mention. It is the duty of a sovereign to procure for
his people all the happiness of which their condition is susceptible. His
public spirited exertions may be suspended by the exigencies of defensive
<PB N="400" REF="421"/>
war; but as soon as peace is restored, he will be continually and usefully
occupied with the interests of religion, laws, morals, sciences, police, com∣merce,
and agriculture. Let us try the merits of the senate of Bern by
these maxims. The members of this senate have been masters of the Païs
de Vaud since the year one thousand five hundred and thirty-six. When we
consider the deplorable condition in those days of France, England, Hol∣land,
and Germany, we can scarcely imagine that they were the same coun∣tries
with those respectively known at present by the same names. Their
barbarism has been civilized, their ignorance enlightened, their poverty en∣riched;
their deserts have become cities, and their forests now wave with
yellow harvests. These wonders have been effected by their princes and
ministers: a Henry the Fourth, a Sully, a Colbert, an Elizabeth, a de Witt,
and a Frederick William. The comparative condition of the Païs de Vaud
at those two remote aeras, does not present so pleasing a picture. There
the arts still languish, for want of those encouragements which princes
only can bestow: the country is still destitute of commerce and manufac∣tures:
we hear not of any projects for promoting the public prosperity: we
<PB N="401" REF="422"/>
see nothing but the marks of an universal lethargy. Yet the princes above
mentioned had but moments for executing their great designs; the senators
of Bern have had ages. What benefits might not those patriotic kings
have conferred on their subjects, if, instead of having their thrones conti∣nually
shaken by war and sedition, they had enjoyed during two centuries
the advantage of having loyal subjects and pacific neighbours? I appeal to
yourself; point out a single useful establishment which the Païs de Vaud owes
to the sovereignty of Bern: but do not tell me of the academy of Lausanne,
founded on motives of religion during the zeal of reformation, but since
totally neglected, though a worthy magistrate of that city proposed the laud∣able
design of erecting it into an university.</P>
<P>Your masters err not through ignorance. They are not deficient, I
know, in political abilities. But while a prince treats with impartial bounty
all his subjects, the citizens of an aristocratical capital are apt to behold with
jealousy the improvement of the provinces. Their elevation, they think,
must pave the way for their own downfal; and if they become their equals
in point of knowledge and riches, they will soon be tempted, they imagine,
<PB N="402" REF="423"/>
to aspire at an equality with themselves in power. Recal to memory the
year one thousand six hundred and eighty-five; when the wretched policy of
Louis the Fourteenth drove from their country the most industrious portion
of his subjects, many of whom sought refuge in the Païs de Vaud; a neigh∣bouring
district, and speaking their own language. They requested only
an asylum, the benefits of which they would richly have repaid by the wealth
which they carried with them, and their skill in manufactures, still more va∣luable.
But the narrow policy of Bern took the alarm. <Q>If we make
these men citizens of Bern, their interests will coincide with our own.
But is it fit that mortals should be raised to the rank of gods? If they
are mixed with the mass of our subjects, our subjects will be enriched by
their industry.</Q> They concluded therefore, with the ambassadors of Por∣senna—
<Q>that it was more desirable for a prince to govern a poor but sub∣missive
people, than to contend with the unruly passions of men pam∣pered
by prosperity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="424"/>
The emigrants, disgusted at being repeatedly refused what they ought to
have been requested to accept, travelled to Holland, Prussia, and England,
whose rulers had the good sense to avail themselves of an emergency as fa∣vourable
as it was singular. A part of them indeed remained in the Païs
de Vaud, but the poorest and the idlest, who had neither money nor spirit
to travel farther.</P>
<P>These unhappy fugitives had no sooner begun to forget their past suffer∣ings,
than they learned by fatal experience that, in order to avoid perse∣cution,
it was necessary to fly from the society of men. The sovereigns of
the country in which they had settled had imbibed the severe system of Cal∣vin,
a stern theologian, who loved liberty too well, to endure that Christians
should wear any other chains than those imposed by himself. His near con∣formity
in opinion with a celebrated German philosopher, interested the ho∣nour
of the German name in supporting his doctrines. But in the Païs
de Vaud the asperity of religious opinions had softened with the improve∣ment
of society. It became necessary, therefore, to send thither formulas
<PB N="404" REF="425"/>
and inquisitors, designed to make as many hypocrites as possible, not indeed
by fire and sword, but by threats and deposition from office.</P>
<P>In supporting the rights of man, I would not carry too far the maxims
of toleration. It is just that public rewards should be bestowed only on those
who teach the religion of the public; and those bold innovators, who would
impart a dangerous light to the people, may very properly be restrained by
the arm of the magistrate. But it surely is absurd, that the sovereign should
interfere in theological minutiae, and take part warmly in questions which
are incapable of being decided. It is particularly unjust, that he should
impose confessions of saith on old ministers, who wish to avoid disputation;
leaving them the miserable alternative of falsehood or beggary. But this
persecution has now ceased. What put an end to it? It was not shame,
nor the tears of the people, but the boldness of Davel, that meritorious en∣thusiast.
Even to the present day, a secret inquisition still reigns at Lau∣sanne;
where the names of Arminian and Socinian are often mentioned in
<PB N="405" REF="426"/>
the letters written by very honest people to their patrons of Bern; and
offices are often given or withheld according to the reports made of the reli∣gious
tenets of the candidates.</P>
<P>Having made these strictures on your legislature, which by no means ex∣haust
the subject, I proceed to consider the defects of your executive power;
which is the public force, as the legislature ought to be the public will. But
a single council, or a single man, may deliberate and resolve for a whole
nation; the executive power, on the contrary, requires the exertions of many:
as it is composed of a great variety of branches, many officers, subordinate
one to the other, must actuate the different parts of the machine, to which
the chief magistrate can only communicate the first general movement. The
honours and emoluments legally attached to such offices, ought to be open
to all those citizens who are properly qualified for discharging them. Each
individual, as he bears a share of the public burdens, is entitled also to a
share of the public rewards. This just arrangement is easily maintained in
monarchies; where, with the exception of a few courtiers, who, by being
<PB N="406" REF="427"/>
continually about the prince's person, have an opportunity of substituting
flattery instead of real services, all the inhabitants of the kingdom are treated
with comparative equity. In France, provided a man has court-favour
or merit, the question is never asked whether he comes from Provence or
Normandy. D'Epernon was born in Gascony; Richelieu, in Champagne;
Mazarine, in Rome. But in aristocratical republics, the citizens of one
town are not contented with being sovereigns collectively, unless they indi∣vidually
appropriate all offices of honour or emolument. In the canton of
Bern talents and information are not of the smallest use to any one who is
not born in the capital; and in another sense they are useless to those born
there; because they <HI>must</HI> make their way without them. Their subjects in
the Païs de Vaud are condemned, by the circumstances of their birth, to a
condition of shameful obscurity. They naturally become, therefore, a prey
to despair; and neglecting to cultivate talents which they can never enjoy an
opportunity to display, those who had capacities for becoming great men are
contented with making themselves agreeable companions. Should I propose
that the subjects obtained a right to hold the lucrative employments of
<PB N="407" REF="428"/>
<HI>Baillis,</HI> or governors of districts, the aristocratical families of Bern would
think me guilty of a crime little less than sacrilege. <Q>The emoluments of
these offices form the patrimony of the state; and we are the state.</Q> It
is true, that you in the Païs de Vaud may be deputies to the Baillis; but the
advantages belonging to that subordinate magistracy are obtained on certain
conditions, which, unless the holder of the office lives a certain number of
years, renders his bargain a very bad one for his family.</P>
<P>What encouragement is then left for the gentlemen of the Païs de Vaud?
That of foreign service. But to them, even this road to preferment is ex∣tremely
difficult, and to attain the higher ranks is impossible. I speak not
of the brilliant service of France: in that country, expence is unavoidable;
the ensign is ruined, the captain can scarcely live, and the colonel cannot
save money. You are therefore obliged to the paternal care of the magi∣strates
of Bern, whose treaties for supplying troops to France do not lead
you into temptation. Let us only consider the service of Holland, a service
more profitable than showy, where officers have nothing to do but to grow
rich. By the treaty of 1712, the Canton of Bern granted the use of twenty-four
<PB N="408" REF="429"/>
companies to their High Mightinesses, and promised that they should al∣ways
be allowed to recruit them in their territories. But the command of
sixteen of those companies was appropriated by the citizens of Bern, and the
remaining eight were left common between them and their subjects in the
Païs de Vaud. On the supposition, then, that the interest of both classes of
candidates for those companies is equal, the sovereign people will obtain
four out of the eight, and twenty out of the whole twenty-four. This pro∣portion
appears the more unreasonable, when it is considered that in the can∣ton
there are above an hundred thousand men sit to bear arms, of whom
scarcely eight hundred are citizens of Bern. Besides, the poorer classes of
citizens, proud merely of this title, prefer living in idleness at Bern to ho∣nourable
exertions abroad, by which they might better their condition.
I doubt, therefore, whether fifty citizens of Bern, who are not officers, will
be found in the whole of the Swiss Dutch troops.</P>
<P>These inconveniencies, you will tell me, are only felt by men of family;
that is to say, by the most respectable, but least numerous, portion of the
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
community; and they disappear amidst the general equity and impartiality
of the public administration. But does the tyranny of the <HI>bailiffs</HI> disappear
also? The people, a name so dear to humanity, feel the full weight of
their oppression. I will not have recourse to particular examples; because
you might call in question the authenticity of facts, or object with reason,
that general conclusions are not to be drawn from particular principles. I
shall be contented with pointing out the extent of their power, and leave to
your own knowledge of human nature to infer the abuses with which it must
be accompanied. In his own district every bailiff is at the head of religion,
of the law, the army, and the finances. As judge, he decides, without appeal,
all causes to the amount of an hundred franks; a sum of little importance
to a gentleman, but which often makes the whole fortune of a peasant; and
he decides alone, for the voice of his assessors has not any weight in the
scale. He confers, or rather he sells, all the employments in his district.
When the injured party wishes to appeal from his sentence, as there is no
court of justice at Moudon, he is obliged to remove the cause to Bern; and
<PB N="410" REF="431"/>
how few peasants can bear this expence? But if his eagerness to punish his
tyrant carries him thither, it is not without many difficulties on his part that
the Avoyer, or chief magistrate, grants him admission into the council; where,
after all his trouble and expence, he is finally allowed to plead his cause be∣fore
a tribunal, the members of which are connected with his oppressor by
the ties of blood, and still more by a conformity of interests and crimes.</P>
<P>Your taxes, moderate as they are, exhaust the country. This observation
requires to be explained. While the great kingdoms of Europe, loaded
with expences and debts, are driven to expedients which would alarm the
wildest prodigal, Bern is the only state which has amassed a large treasure.
The secret has been so well kept, that it is not easy to ascertain its amount.
Stanyan, the British envoy at Bern, a man inquisitive and possessed of
good means of information, estimated forty years ago the money belonging
to that republic, in the English funds, at three hundred thousand pounds, or
seven millions of Swiss livres; and the sums remaining in the treasury of
Bern, or dispersed through the other funds or banks of Europe, at eighteen
<PB N="411" REF="432"/>
hundred thousand pounds sterling, or forty-three millions Swiss. These trea∣sures
have not probably diminished since the year 1722. The Canton en∣riches
itself by the simple means of receiving much and expending little.
But what is the amount of its receipts? I know not, but I will try to dis∣cover
it. The twelve bailiwics, or districts, of the Païs de Vaud pay, one
with another, during the six years that they are governed by the same ma∣gistrate,
five hundred thousand Swiss livres. The contributions, therefore
of all the twelve amount to a million of livres annually, I have always
been told that the bailiffs, or governors, retain ten <HI>per cent.</HI> on the reve∣nues
raised within their respective jurisdictions. The million of revenue,
diminished by an hundred thousand livres consumed in the appointments of
the <HI>bailiffs,</HI> is reduced to three hundred thousand crowns; of which one
hundred thousand may be allowed for the expences of the state, a sum not
chosen at random; and the other two hundred thousand crowns, which in
other countries would be employed in the maintenance of a court and army,
whose incomes would circulate through the general mass of the people on
whom they had been raised, are here buried in the coffers of the sovereignty,
<PB N="412" REF="433"/>
or dispersed through the precarious banks of Europe, to become one day
a prey to the knavery of a clerk, or the ambition of a conqueror. This con∣tinual
absorption of specie extinguishes industry, deadens every enterprise
that requires the aid of money, and gradually impoverishes the country.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are your hardships. But I think you will say to me, <Q>Have
you thus probed our wounds merely to make us feel their smart? What
advice do you give us?</Q> None, unless you have already anticipated
it. I would indeed advise you to remonstrate. But there are evils so deeply
rooted in governments, that Plato himself would despair of curing them.
What could you expect to obtain from those masters by remonstrances, who
have remained during two centuries insensible to the merit of your faithful ser∣vice?
There is another remedy, more prompt, more perfect, and more glori∣ous.
William Tell would have prescribed it; I do not. I know that the spirit
of a good citizen is, like that of charity, long-suffering, and hoping all things.
The citizen is in the right; since he knows the evils resulting from his sub∣mission,
<PB N="413" REF="434"/>
but knows not the greater evils which might be produced by his
resistance. You know me too well to be ignorant how much I respect those
principles, so friendly to the interests of peace and of human kind. I will
never, in the language of a seditious tribune, persuade the people to shake
off the yoke of authority, that they may proceed from murmur to sedition,
from sedition to anarchy, and from anarchy perhaps to despotism.</P>
<P>Yet, with the freedom which has hitherto guided my pen, I will endea∣vour
to destroy some giants of romance, which might otherwise inspire you
with vain terror. Whether you prefer the road of bold enterprise or cautious
repose, I wish that reason, not prejudice, should dictate your choice.</P>
<P>The magistrates of Bern have a right to expect your obedience: you fear
to do them wrong in withholding it.</P>

<P>FEAR no reproaches for your negligence, however great; for your
silence, however long. I love you too well to make you any.
Nothing, in my opinion, is so ridiculous as some kind of friends,
wives, and lovers, who look on no crime as so heinous as the letting
slip a post without writing. The charm of friendship is liberty; and
he that would destroy the one, destroys, without designing it, the
better half of the other. I compare friendship to charity, and letters
to alms; the last signifies nothing without the first, and very often
the first is very strong, although it does not shew itself by the other.
It is not good-will which is wanting, it is only opportunities or
means. However, one month—two months—three months—four
months—I began not to be angry, but to be uneasy, for fear some
accident had happened to you. I was often on the point of writing,
but was always stopped by the hopes of hearing from you the next
post. Besides, not to flatter you, your excuse is a very bad one.
<HI>You cannot entertain me by your letters.</HI> I think I ought to know
that better than you; and I assure you that one of <HI>your plain sincere
letters</HI> entertains me more than the most polished one of Pliny or
Cicero. 'Tis your heart speaks, and I look on your heart as much
better in its way than either of their heads.</P>
<P>Out of pure politeness I ought to talk of **** ********
before myself. I was some hours with him in this place, that is to
say, almost all the time he was here. I find him always ***
****, always good-natured, always amusing, and always trifling.
I asked him some questions about Italy; he told me, he hurried out
<PB N="415" REF="436"/>
of it as soon as he could, because there was no French comedy, and
he did not love the Italian opera. I let slip some words of the
pleasure he should have of seeing his native country again, on
account of the services he could render her in parliament. <Q>Yes
(says he), I want vastly to be at London; there are three years
since I have seen Garrick.</Q> He spoke to me of you, and indeed
not only with consideration, but with affection. Were there nothing
else valuable in his character, I should love him, because he loves
you. He told me he intended to see you as soon as he should be in
England; I am glad he has kept his word. I was so taken up with
my old friend, that I could not speak a word to * * *.
He appeared, however, a good, sensible, modest young man. Poor
Minorca indeed thus lost! but poor Englishmen who have lost it!
I think the second exclamation still stronger than the first. Poor
Lord Torrington! I can't help pitying him. What a shameful
uncle he has! I shall lose all my opinion of my countrymen, if the
whole nation, Whigs, Tories, Courtiers, Jacobites, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
are not unanimous in detesting that man. Pray, is there any truth
in a story we had here, of a brother of Admiral Byng's having
killed himself out of rage and shame? I did not think he had any
brothers alive. It is thought here that Byng will be acquitted. I
hope not. Though I do not love rash judgments, I cannot help
thinking him guilty.</P>
<P>You ask me, when I shall come into England? How should I know
it? The 14th of June I wrote to my father, and saying nothing of
my return, which I knew would have been to no purpose, I de∣sired
him to give me a fixed allowance of 200l. a-year, or, at least,
to allow me a servant. No answer. About a fortnight ago I re∣newed
my request; and I cannot yet know what will be my success.
I design to make a virtue of necessity, to keep quiet during this win∣ter,
and to put in use all my machines next spring, in order to come

over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Letter is a curious specimen of the degree in which Mr. Gibbon had lost the
English language in a short time.</NOTE>. I shall write the strongest, and at the same time the most
dutiful letter I can imagine to my father. If all that produces no
effect, I don't know what I can do.</P>
<P>You talk to me of my cousin Ellison's wedding; but you don't
say a word of who she is married to. Is it Elliot? Though you
have not seen my father yet, I suppose you have heard of him.
How was he in town? His wife, was she with him? Has marriage
produced any changement in his way of living? Is he to be always
at Beriton, or will he come up to London in winter? Pray have
you ever seen my mother-in-law, or heard any thing more of her
character? Compliments to every body that makes me compliments:
to the Gilberts, to the Comarques, to Lord Newnham, &amp;c. When
you see the Comarques again, ask them if they did not know, at
Putney, Monsieur la Vabre, and his daughters; perhaps you know
them yourself. I saw them lately in this country; one of them very
well married.</P>
<P>The Englishman who lodges in our house, is little sociable at least
for a reasonable person. My health always good, my studies pretty
good. I understand Greek pretty well. I have even some kind of
correspondence with several learned men, with Mr. Crevier of Paris,
with Mr. Breitinger of Zurick, and with Mr. Allamand, a clergy∣man
of this country, the most reasonable divine I ever knew. Do
you never read now? I am a little piqued that you say nothing of
Sir Charles Grandison; if you have not read it yet, read it for my
sake. Perhaps Clarissa does not encourage you; but, in my opinion,
it is much superior to Clarissa. When you have read it, read the
letters of Madame de Sevigné to her daughter; I don't doubt of
their being translated into English. They are properly what I called
<PB N="417" REF="438"/>
in the beginning of my letter, letters of the heart; the natural ex∣pressions
of a mother's fondness; regret at their being at a great dis∣tance
from one another, and continual schemes to get together again.
All that, won't it please you? There is scarce any thing else in six
whole volumes: and notwithstanding that, few people read them
without finding them too short. Adieu: my paper is at an end.
I don't dare to tell you to write soon. Do it, however, if you

<P>AN address in writing, from a person who has the pleasure of

least, let him know at the same time, that however reasonable, how∣ever
eligible, my scheme may appear to me, I would rather forget
it for ever, than cause him the slightest uneasiness.</P>
<P>When I first returned to England, attentive to my future interest,
you were so good as to give me hopes of a seat in parliament. This
seat, it was supposed would be an expence of fifteen hundred pounds.
This design flattered my vanity, as it might enable me to shine
in so august an assembly. It flattered a nobler passion; I promised
myself that by the means of this seat I might be one day the instru∣ment
of some good to my country. But I soon perceived how little
a mere virtuous inclination, unassisted by talents, could contribute
towards that great end; and a very short examination discovered to
me, that those talents had not fallen to my lot. Do not, dear Sir,
impute this declaration to a false modesty, the meanest species of
pride. Whatever else I may be ignorant of, I think I know myself,
and shall always endeavour to mention my good qualities without
vanity, and my defects without repugnance. I shall say nothing of
the most intimate acquaintance with his country and language, so ab∣solutely
<PB N="419" REF="440"/>
necessary to every senator. Since they may be acquired, to
alledge my deficiency in them, would seem only the plea of laziness.
But I shall say with great truth, that I never possessed that gift of
speech, the first requisite of an orator, which use and labour may
improve, but which nature alone can bestow. That my temper,
quiet, retired, somewhat reserved, could neither acquire popularity,
bear up against opposition, nor mix with ease in the crowds of public
life. That even my genius (if you will allow me any) is better
qualified for the deliberate compositions of the closet, than for the
extemporary discourses of the parliament. An unexpected objection
would disconcert me; and as I am incapable of explaining to others,
what I do not thoroughly understand myself, I should be meditating,
while I ought to be answering. I even want necessary prejudices of
party, and of nation. In popular assemblies, it is often necessary to
inspire them; and never orator inspired well a passion, which he did
not feel himself. Suppose me even mistaken in my own character;
to set out with the repugnance such an opinion must produce, offers
but an indifferent prospect. But I hear you say, it is not necessary
that every man should enter into parliament with such exalted hopes.
It is to acquire a title the most glorious of any in a free country, and
to employ the weight and consideration it gives, in the service of
one's friends. Such motives, though not glorious, yet are not dis∣honourable;
and if we had a borough in our command, if you
could bring me in without any great expence, or if our fortune en∣abled
us to despise that expence, then indeed I should think them
of the greatest strength. But with our private fortune, is it worth
while to purchase at so high a rate, a title, honourable in itself, but
which I must share with every fellow that can lay out fifteen hundred
pounds? Besides, dear Sir, a merchandise is of little value to the
owner, when he is resolved not to sell it.</P>
<P>I should affront your penetration, did I not suppose you now see
the drift of this letter. It is to appropriate to another use the sum
<PB N="420" REF="441"/>
with which you destined to bring me into parliament; to employ it,
not in making me great, but in rendering me happy. I have often
heard you say yourself, that the allowance you had been so indulgent
as to grant me, though very liberal in regard to your estate, was yet
but small, when compared with the almost necessary extravagancies
of the age. I have indeed found it so, notwithstanding a good deal
of oeconomy, and an exemption from many of the common ex∣pences
of youth. This, dear Sir, would be a way of supplying
these deficiencies, without any additional expence to you.—But I
forbear.—If you think my proposals reasonable, you want no en∣treaties
to engage you to comply with them; if otherwise, all will
be without effect.</P>
<P>All that I am afraid of, dear Sir, is, that I should seem not so
much asking a favour, as this really is, as exacting a debt. After
all I can say, you will still remain the best judge of my good, and
your own circumstances. Perhaps, like most landed gentlemen,
an addition to my annuity would suit you better, than a sum of
money given at once; perhaps the sum itself may be too consider∣able.
Whatever you shall think proper to bestow upon me, or in
whatever manner, will be received with equal gratitude.</P>
<P>I intended to stop here; but as I abhor the least appearance of art,
I think it will be better to lay open my whole scheme at once. The
unhappy war which now desolates Europe, will oblige me to defer
seeing France till a peace. But that reason can have no influence
upon Italy, a country which every scholar must long to see; should
you grant my request, and not disapprove of my manner of em∣ploying
your bounty, I would leave England this Autumn, and
pass the Winter at Lausanne, with M. de Voltaire and my old
friends. The armies no longer obstruct my passage, and it must be
indifferent to you, whether I am at Lausanne or at London during
the Winter, since I shall not be at Beriton. In the Spring I would
cross the Alps, and after some stay in Italy, as the war must then
<PB N="421" REF="442"/>
be terminated, return home through France; to live happily with
you and my dear mother. I am now two-and-twenty; a tour must
take up a considerable time, and though I believe you have no
thoughts of settling me soon, (and I am sure I have not,) yet so
many things may intervene, that the man who does not travel early,
runs a great risk of not travelling at all. But this part of my
scheme, as well as the whole, I submit entirely to you.</P>
<P>Permit me, dear Sir, to add, that I do not know whether the com∣plete
compliance with my wishes could increase my love and gra∣titude;
but that I am very sure, no refusal could diminish those sen∣timents
with which I shall always remain, dear Sir,</P>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> XIV. GEO. LEWIS SCOTT Esquire to EDWARD GIBBON junior.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSING you settled in quarters, dear Sir, I obey your com∣mands,
and send you my thoughts, relating to the pursuit of your
mathematical studies. You told me, you had read Clairaut's Alge∣bra,
and the three first books of l'Hopital's Conic Sections. You
did not mention the Elements of Geometry you had perused. What∣ever
they were, whether Euclid's, or by some other, you will do
well, if you have not applied yourself that way for some time
past, to go over them again, and render the conclusions familiar to
your memory. You may defer, however, a very critical inquiry
into the principles and reasoning of geometers, till Dr. Simpson's
new edition of Euclid (now in the press) appears. I would have
you study that book well; in the mean time recapitulate Clairaut
and l'Hopital, so far as you have gone, and then go through the re∣mainder
of the marquis's books with care. The fifth book will be
an Introduction to the <HI>Analyse des Infiniment petits;</HI> to which I
would advise you to proceed, after finishing the Conic Sections. The
<HI>Infiniment petits</HI> may want a comment; Crousaz has written one, but
it is a wretched performance: he did not understand the first prin∣ciples
of the science he undertook to illustrate; and his geometry
shews, that he did not understand the first principles of geometry.
There is a posthumous work of M. Varignon's, called <HI>Eclaircissemens
sur l' Analyse des Infiniment petits.</HI> Paris, 1725, 4to. This will be often
of use to you. However, it must be owned, that the notion of the
<HI>Infiniment petits,</HI> or <HI>Infinitesimals,</HI> as we call them, is too bold an as∣sumption,
and too remote from the principles of the ancients, our
masters in geometry; and has given a handle to an ingenious author
<PB N="425" REF="446"/>
(Berkeley, late bishop of Cloyne) to attack the logic of modern
mathematicians. He has been answered by many, but by none so
clearly as by Mr. Maclaurin, in his Fluxions, (2 vols. in 4to,) where
you will meet with a collection of the most valuable discoveries
in the mathematical and physico-mathematical sciences. I recom∣mend
this author to you; but whether you ought to read him
immediately after M. de l'Hopital, may be a question. I think you
may be satisfied at first with reading his introduction, and chap. 1.
book I. of the grounds of the Method of Fluxions, and then pro∣ceed
to chap. 12. of the same book, § 495 to § 505 inclusive, where
he treats of the Method of Infinitesimals, and of the Limits of Ratios.
You may then read chap. 1. book II. § 697 to § 714 inclusive; and
this you may do immediately after reading the first section of the
<HI>Analyse des Infiniment petits:</HI> or if you please, you may postpone a
critical inquiry into the principles of Infinitesimals and Fluxions, till
you have seen the use and application of this doctrine in the drawing
of Tangents, and in finding the Maxima and Minima of Geometrical
Magnitudes. <HI>Annal. des Infin. pet.</HI> § 2 <HI>and</HI> 3.</P>
<P>When you have read the beginning of l'Hopital's 4th sect. to
sect. 65 inclusive, you may read Maclaurin's chap. 2, 3, and 4;
where he fully explains the nature of these higher orders of Fluxions,
and applies the notion to geometrical figures. Your principles being
then firmly established, you may finish M. de l'Hopital.</P>
<P>Your next step must be to the inverse method of Fluxions, called
by the French <HI>calcul integral.</HI> Monsieur de Bougainville has given
us a treatise upon this subject, Paris, 1754, 4to. under the title
<HI>Traité du calcul integral pour servir de suite a l' Analyse des Infiniment
petits.</HI> You should have it; but though he explains the methods
hitherto found out for the determination of Fluents from given
Fluxions, or in the French style, <HI>pour trouver les integrales des dif∣ferences
donneés;</HI> yet as he has not shewn the use and application of
this doctrine, as de l'Hopital did, with respect to that part which he
<PB N="426" REF="447"/>
treats of, M. de Bougainville's book is, for that reason, not so well
suited to beginners as could be wished. You may therefore take
Carré's book in 4to, printed at Paris, 1700, and entitled, <HI>Methode
pour la Mesure des Surfaces,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>par l' Application du Calcul integral.</HI>
Only I must caution you against depending upon him in his fourth
section, where he treats of the centre of oscillation and percussion;
he having made several mistakes there, as M. de Mairan has shewn,
p. 196. <HI>Mem. de l' Acad. Royale des Sciences,</HI> edit. Paris, 1735. After
Carré, you may read Bougainville.</P>
<P>I have recommended French authors to you, because you are a
thorough master of that language, and because, by their studying
style and clearness of expression, they seem to me best adapted to
beginners. Our authors are often profound and acute, but their la∣conisms,
and neglect of expression, often perplex beginners. I
except Mr. Maclaurin, who is very clear; but then he has such a
vast variety of matter, that a great part of his book is, on that ac∣count,
too difficult for a beginner. I might recommend other au∣thors
to you, as a course of elements; for instance, you might
read Mr. Thomas Simpson's Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, and
Fluxions; all which contain a great variety of good things. In his
Geometry he departs from Euclid without a sufficient reason. How∣ever,
you may read him after Dr. Robert Simson's Euclid, or
together with it, and take notice of what is new in Thomas Simpson.
His Algebra you may join with Clairaut; and the rather that Clairaut
has been sparing of particular problems, and has, besides, omitted se∣veral
useful applications of Algebra. Simpson's Fluxions may go hand
in hand with l'Hopital, Maclaurin, Carré, and Bougainville. If you
come to have a competent knowledge of these authors, you will be
far advanced, and you may proceed to the works of Newton, Cotes,
the Bernoulli's, Dr. Moivre, &amp;c. as your inclination and time will
permit. Sir Isaac Newton's treatise of the Quadrature of Curves has
been well commented by Mr. Stewart, and is of itself a good in∣stitution
<PB N="427" REF="448"/>
of Fluxions. Sir Isaac's Algebra is commented in several
places by Clairaut, and in more in Maclaurin's Algebra; and New∣ton's
famous Principia are explained by the <HI>Minims Jacquirs et le
Seur,</HI> Geneva, 4 vols. 4to. Cotes is explained by Don Walmesley,
in his <HI>Analyse des Mesures,</HI> &amp;c. Paris, 4to. You see you may find
work enough. But my paper bids me subscribe myself, dear Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>LEICESTER-SQUARE,
<DATE>May 7, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient servant, GEO. LEWIS SCOTT.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> But I recollect, a little late, that the books I have men∣tioned,
excepting Newton's Principia, and the occasional problems in
the rest, treat only of the abstract parts of the Mathematics; and
you are, no doubt, willing to look into the concrete parts, or what is
called Mixed Mathematics, and the Physico-mathematical Sciences.
Of these the principal are, mechanics, optics, and astronomy. As to
the principles of mechanics, M. d'Alembert has recommended M.
Trabaud's <HI>Principes du Mouvement et de l'Equilibre,</HI> to beginners;
and you cannot do better than to study this book. In optics we
have Dr. Smith's Complete System, 2 vols. 4to. I wish though, we
had a good institution, short and clear; the Doctor's book entering
into too great details for beginners. However, you may consider his
first book, or popular Treatise, as an Institution, and you will from
thence acquire a good deal of knowledge. In astronomy I recom∣mend
M. le Monnier's <HI>Institutions Astronomiques,</HI> in 4to. Paris, 1746.
It is a translation from Keil's Astronomical Lectures, but with con∣siderable
additions. You should also have Cassini's <HI>Elemens d' Astro∣nomie,</HI>
2 vols. 4to. As to the physical causes of the celestial mo∣tions,
after having read Maclaurin's account of Sir Isaac Newton's
philosophical Discoveries, and Dr. Pemberton's View of Sir Isaac's
Philosophy, you may read the great author himself, with the com∣ment.
But if you read Maclaurin's Fluxions throughout, you will
find many points of Sir Isaac's philosophy well explained there.
<PB N="428" REF="449"/>
They theory of light and colours should be studied in Sir Isaac him∣self,
in the English edition of his Optics, 8vo. there is a branch
of the optical sciences which I have not mentioned, that is, Per∣spective.
Dr. Brook Taylor's is the best system, but his style and
expression is embarrassed and obscure. L'Abbé de la Caille has also
given a good treatise of Perspective, at the end of his <HI>Optique:</HI> these
are of use to painters; but the theory of mathematical projection
in general is more extensive, and has been well treated of by old
writers, Clavius, Aguillonius, Tacquet, and De Chules: and lately
M. de la Caille has given a memoir among those of the <HI>Acad. Roy.
des Sciences</HI> of Paris, <HI>anno</HI> 1741, <HI>sur le calcul des projections en ge∣neral.</HI>
This subject is necessary for the understanding of the theory
of maps and planispheres. Mathematicians have also applied their
art to the theory of sounds and music. Dr. Smith's Harmonics is
the principal book of the kind.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you some account of the principal elementary
authors in the different branches of mathematical knowledge, and
it were much to be wished that we had a complete institution, or
course, of all these things of a moderate size, which might serve as
an introduction to all the good original authors. Wolfius attempted
this; his intention was laudable, but his book is so full of errors of
the press, besides some of his own, that I cannot recommend him
to a beginner. He might be used occasionally for the signification
of terms, and for many historical facts relating to mathematics;
and, besides, may be considered as a collector of problems, which
is useful.</P>
<P>Besides the books I have mentioned, it might be of use to you to
have M. Montucla's <HI>Histoire des Mathematiques,</HI> in 4to. 2. vols. You
will there find a history of the progress of the mathematical sciences,
and some account of the principal authors relating to this subject.</P>
<P>I mentioned to you in conversation, the superior elegance of the
antient method of demonstration. If you incline to examine this
<PB N="429" REF="450"/>
point, after being well versed in Euclid, you may proceed to Dr.
Simson's Conic Sections; and to form an idea of the antient analysis
or method of investigating the solution of geometrical problems, read
Euclid's Data, which Dr. Simson will publish, together with his new
edition of Euclid; and then read his <HI>Loci Plani,</HI> in 4to. The elegance
of the method of the ancients is confessed; but it seems to require the
remembrance of a great multitude of propositions, and in complicated
problems it does not seem probable that it can be extended so far as
the algebraic method.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS, <DATE>February the 12th, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU remember our agreement,—short and frequent letters. The
first part of the treaty you have no doubt of my observing. I
think I ought not to leave you any of the second. <HI>A propos</HI> of
treaty: our definitive one was signed here yesterday, and this morn∣ing
the Duke of Bridgewater and Mr. Neville went for London
with the news of it. The plenipotentiaries sat up till ten o'clock
in the morning at the ambassador of Spain's ball, and then went to
sign this treaty, which regulates the fate of Europe.</P>
<P>Paris, in most respects, has fully answered my expectations. I
have a number of very good acquaintance, which increase every
day; for nothing is so easy as the making them here. Instead of
complaining of the want of them, I begin already to think of mak∣ing
a choice. Next Sunday, for instance, I have only three invita∣tions
to dinner. Either in the houses you are already acquainted,
<PB N="430" REF="451"/>
you meet with people who ask you to come and see them, or some
of your friends offer themselves to introduce you. When I speak of
these connections, I mean chiefly for dinner and the evening. Sup∣pers,
as yet, I am pretty much a stranger to, and I fancy shall con∣tinue
so; for Paris is divided into two species, who have but little
communication with each other. The one, who is chiefly con∣nected
with the men of letters, dine very much at home, are glad to
see their friends, and pass the evenings till about nine, in agreeable
and rational conversation. The others are the most fashionable, sup
in numerous parties, and always play, or rather game, both before
and after supper. You may easily guess which sort suits me best.
Indeed, Madam, we may say what we please of the frivolity of the
French, but I do assure you, that in a fortnight passed at Paris, I
have heard more conversation worth remembering, and seen more
men of letters among the people of fashion, than I had done in two
or three winters in London.</P>
<P>Amongst my acquaintance I cannot help mentioning M. Helvetius,
the author of the famous book <HI>de l' Esprit.</HI> I met him at dinner at
Madame Geoffrin's, where he took great notice of me, made me a
visit next day, has ever since treated me, not in a polite but a
friendly manner. Besides being a sensible man, an agreeable com∣panion,
and the worthiest creature in the world, he has a very pretty
wife, an hundred thousand livres a year, and one of the best tables
in Paris. The only thing I dislike in him is his great attachment to,
and admiration for, * * * *, whose character is indeed at Paris
beyond any thing you can conceive. To the great civility of this
foreigner, who was not obliged to take the least notice of me, I must
just contrast the behaviour of * * * * * *.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS, <DATE>February 24, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter about twelve days after its date, owing, as
I apprehend, to Mr. Foley's negligence. My direction is, <HI>à

Monsieur Monsieur</HI> Gibbon, <HI>Gentilhomme Anglois à l' Hotel de Lon∣dres,
rue de Columbier, Fauxbourg St. Germains, à Paris.</HI> You see I am
still in that part of the town; and indeed from all the intelligence I
could collect, I saw no reason to change, either on account of cheap∣ness
or pleasantness. Madame Bontems, Mrs. Mallet's friend, and
a Marquis de Mirabeau, (I got acquainted with at her house,) have
acted a very friendly part; though all their endeavours have only
served to convince me that Paris is unavoidably a very dear place. I
am sorry to find my English cloaths look very foreign. The French
are now excessively long-waisted. At present we are in mourning
for the Bishop of Liege, the king's uncle; and expect soon another
of a singular nature, for the old Pretender, who is very ill. They
mourn for him, not as a crowned head, but as a relation of the
king's. I am doubtful how the English here will behave; indeed
we can have no difficulties, since we need only follow the example
of the Duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>I have now passed nearly a month in this place, and I can say with
truth, that it has answered my most sanguine expectations. The
buildings of every kind, the libraries, the public diversions, take up
a great part of my time; and I have already found several houses,
where it is both very easy and very agreeable to be acquainted.
Lady Harvey's recommendation to Madame Geoffrin was a most
excellent one. Her house is a very good one; regular dinners there
every Wednesday, and the best company of Paris, in men of letters
and people of fashion. It was at her house I connected myself with
<PB N="432" REF="453"/>
M. Helvetius, who, from his heart, his head, and his fortune, is a
most valuable man.</P>
<P>At his house I was introduced to the Baron d'Olbach, who is a
man of parts and fortune, and has two dinners every week. The
other houses I am known in, are the Duchess d' Aiguillon's, Madame
la Comtesse de Froulay's, Madame du Bocage, Madame Boyer,
M. le Marquis de Mirabeau, and M. de Foucemagn. All these
people have their different merit; in some I meet with good din∣ners;
in others, societies for the evening; and in all, good sense,
entertainment, and civility; which, as I have no favours to ask, or
business to transact with them, is sufficient for me. Their men of
letters are as affable and communicative as I expected. My letters
to them did me no harm, but were very little necessary. My book
had been of great service to me, and the compliments I have re∣ceived
upon it would make me insufferably vain, if I laid any stress
on them. When I take notice of the civilities I have received, I must
take notice too of what I have seen of a contrary behaviour. You
know how much I always built upon the Count de Caylus: he has
not been of the least use to me. With great difficulty I have seen
him, and that is all. I do not, however, attribute his behaviour to
pride, or dislike to me, but solely to the man's general character,
which seems to be a very odd one. De la Motte, Mrs. Mallet's
friend, has behaved very drily to me, though I have dined with
him twice. But I can forgive him a great deal, in consideration of
his having introduced me to M. d'Augny (Mrs. Mallet's son). Her
men are generally angels or devils; but here I really think, without
being very prone to admiration, that she has said very little too much
of him. As far as I can judge, he has certainly an uncommon degree
of understanding and knowledge, and, I believe, a great fund of
honour and probity. We are very much together, and I think our
intimacy seems to be growing into a friendship. Next Sunday we
go to Versailles; the king's guard is done by a detachment from
<PB N="433" REF="454"/>
Paris, which is relieved every four days; and as he goes upon this
command, it is a very good occasion for me to see the palace. I
shall not neglect, at the same time, the opportunity of informing
myself of the French discipline.</P>
<P>The great news at present is the arrival of a very extraordinary
person from the Isle of France in the East Indies. An obscure
Frenchman, who was lately come into the island, being very ill, and
given over, said, that before he died he must discharge his conscience
of a great burden he had upon it, and declared to several people, he
was the accomplice of Damien, and the very person who held the
horses. Unluckily for him, the man recovered after this declaration,
was immediately sent prisoner to Paris, and is just landed at Port
l'Orient, from whence he is daily expected here, to unravel the
whole mystery of that dark affair. This story (which at first was
laughed at) has now gained entire credit, and I apprehend must be

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> XVII. Mr. GIBBON to Mr. HOLROYD at Lausanne.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BOROMEAN ISLANDS, <DATE>May the 16th, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR HOLROYD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HURRY of running about, time taken up with seeing places, &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c. are excellent excuses; but I fancy you will guess
that my laziness and aversion to writing to my best friend are the
real motives, and I am afraid you will have guessed right.</P>
<P>We are at this minute in a most magnificent palace, in the middle
of a vast lake; ranging about suites of rooms without a soul to
interrupt us, and secluded from the rest of the universe. We shall
sit down in a moment to supper, attended by all the Count's house∣hold.
This is the fine side of the medal: turn to the reverse. We
are got here wet to the skin; we have crawled about fine gardens
which rain and fogs prevented our seeing; and if to-morrow does
not hold up a little better, we shall be in some doubt whether we
can say we have seen these famous islands. Guise says yes, and I
say no. The Count is not here; we have our supper from a paultry
hedge alehouse, (excuse the bull,) and the servants have offered us
beds in the palace, pursuant to their master's directions.</P>
<P>I hardly think you will like Turin; the court is old and dull;
and in that country every one follows the example of the court.
The principal amusement seems to be, driving about in your coach
in the evening, and bowing to the people you meet. If you go
while the Royal Family is there, you have the additional pleasure
of stopping to salute them every time they pass. I had that advan∣tage
fifteen times one afternoon. We were presented to a lady who
keeps a public assembly, and a very mournful one it is; the few
women that go to it are each taken up by their cicisbeo; and a poor
Englishman, who can neither talk Piedmontois nor play at Faro,
<PB N="435" REF="456"/>
stands by himself without one of their haughty nobility doing him
the honour of speaking to him. You must not attribute this account
to our not having staid long enough to form connections. It is a
general complaint of our countrymen, except of Lord ***, who
has been engaged for about two years in the service of a lady,
whose long nose is her most distinguishing fine feature. The most
sociable women I have met with are the king's daughters. I chatted
for about a quarter of an hour with them, talked about Lausanne,
and grew so very free and easy, that I drew my snuff-box, rapped
it, took snuff twice (a crime never known before in the presence
chamber), and continued my discourse in my usual attitude of my
body bent forwards, and my fore singer stretched out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This attitude continued to be characteristic of Mr. Gibbon. The engraving in
the frontispiece of the Memoirs is taken from the figure of Mr. Gibbon cut with
scissars by Mrs. Brown thirty years after the date of this letter. The extraordinary
talents of this lady have furnished as complete a likeness of Mr. Gibbon, as to person,
face, and manner, as can be conceived; yet it was done in his absence.</NOTE>. As it might
however have been difficult to keep up this acquaintance, I chiefly
employ my time in seeing places, which fully repaid me in pleasure
the trouble of my journey. What entertained me the most, was the
museum and the citadel. The first is under the care of a M. Bartoli,
who received us, without any introduction, in the politest manner
in the world, and was of the greatest service to us, as I dare say he
will be to you. The citadel is a stupendous work; and when you
have seen the subterraneous part of it, you will scarcely think it pos∣sible
such a place can ever be taken. As it is however a regular one,
it does not pique my curiosity so much as those irregular fortifica∣tions
hewn out of the Alps, as Exiles, Fenestrelles, and the Brunette
would have done, could we have spared the time necessary. Our
next stage from Turin has been Milan, where we were mere specta∣tors,
as it was not worth while to endeavour at forming connections
for so very few days. I think you will be surprised at the great
church, but infinitely more so at the regiment of Baden, which is in
the citadel. Such steadiness, such alertness in the men, and such
<PB N="436" REF="457"/>
exactness in the officers, as exceeded all my expectations. Next Friday
I shall see the regiment reviewed by General Serbelloni. Perhaps
I may write a particular letter about it. From Milan we proceed
to Genoa, and thence to Florence. you stare—But really we find
it so inconvenient to travel like mutes, and to lose a number of
curious things for want of being able to assist our eyes with our
tongues, that we have resumed our original plan, and leave Venice
for next year. I think I should advise you to do the same.</P>

<P>THE next morning was not fair, but however we were able to
take a view of the islands, which, by the help of some imagination,
we conclude to be a very delightful, though not an enchanted place.
I would certainly advise you to go there from Milan, which you
may very well perform in a day and half. Upon our return, we
found Lord Tilney and some other English in their way to Venice.
We heard a melancholy piece of news from them: Byng died at
Bologna a few days ago of a fever. I am sure you will be all very
sorry to hear it.</P>
<P>We expect a volume of news from you in relation to Lausanne,
and in particular to the alliance of the Duchess with the Frog. Is it
already concluded? How does the bride look after her great revo∣lution?
Pray embrace her and the adorable, if you can, in both our
names; and assure them, as well as all the <HI>Spring</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The society of young ladies mentioned in the Memoirs.</NOTE>, that we talk of
them very often, but particularly of a Sunday; and that we are so
disconsolate, that we have neither of us commenced cicisbeos as yet,
whatever we may do at Florence. We have drank the Duchess's
health, not forgetting the little woman on the top of Mount Cenis, in
the middle of the Lago Maggiore, &amp;c. &amp;c. I expect some account
of the said little woman. Who is my successor? I think ****
had began to supplant me before I went. I expect your answer at
Florence, and your person at Rome; which the Lord grant. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> XVIII. Mr. GIBBON to Mr. HOLROYD at Berlin.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BERITON, <DATE>October 31st, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR HOLROYD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHY did I not leave a letter for you at Marseilles? For a very
plain reason: because I did not go to Marseilles. But, as you
have most judiciously added, why did not I send one? Humph. I
own that nonplusses me a little. However, hearken to my history.
After revolving a variety of plans, and suiting them as well as
possible to time and finances, Guise and I at last agreed to pass from
Venice to Lyons, swim down the Rhone, wheel round the south of
France, and embark at Bourdeaux. Alas! At Lyons I received
letters which convinced me that I ought no longer to deprive my
country of one of her greatest ornaments. Unwillingly I obeyed,
left Guise to execute alone the remainder of our plan, passed about
ten delicious days at Paris, and arrived in England about the end of
June. Guise followed me about two months afterwards, as I was
informed by an epistle from him, which, to his great astonishment,
I immediately answered. You perceive there is still some virtue
amongst men. <HI>Exempli gratiâ,</HI> your letter is dated Vienna, October
12th, 1765; it made its appearance at Beriton, Wednesday evening,
October the 29th. I am at this present writing, sitting in my library,
on Thursday morning, between the hours of twelve and one. I
have ventured to suppose you still at Berlin; if not, I presume you
take care that your letters should follow you. This ideal march to
Berlin is the only one I can make at present. I am under command;
and were I to talk of a third fally as yet, I know some certain people
who would think it just as ridiculous as the third sally of the re∣nowned
Don Quixote. All I ever hoped for was, to be able to take
<PB N="438" REF="459"/>
the field once more, after lying quiet a couple of years. I must
own that your executing your tour in so complete a manner gives
me a little selfish. If I make a summer's escape to Berlin, I
cannot hope for the companion I flattered myself with. I am sorry
however I have said so much; but as it is difficult to encrease your
Honour's proper notions of your own perfections, I will e'en let it
stand. Indeed I owed you something for your account of the fa∣vourable
reception my book has met with. I see there are people of
taste at Vienna, and no longer wonder at your liking it. Since the
court is so agreeable, a thorough reformation must have taken place.
The stiffness of the Austrian etiquette, and the haughty magnificence
of the Hungarian princes, must have given way to more civilized
notions. You have (no doubt) informed yourself of the forces and
revenues of the empress. I think (however unfashionably) we
always esteemed her. Have you lost or improved that opinion.
Princes, like pictures to be admired, must be seen in their proper
point of view, which is often a pretty distant one. I am afraid you
will find it peculiarly so at Berlin.</P>
<P>I need not desire you to pay a most minute attention to the Austrian
and Prussian discipline. You have been bit by a mad serjeant as well
as myself; and when we meet, we shall run over every particular
which we can approve, blame, or imitate. Since my arrival, I
have assumed the august character of Major, received returns, issued
orders, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not intend you shall have the honour of
reviewing my troops next summer. Three fourths of the men will
be recruits; and during my pilgrimage, discipline seems to have been
relaxed. But I summon you to fulfil another engagement. Make
me a visit next summer. You will find here a bad house, a pleasant
country in summer, some books, and very little <HI>strange</HI> company.
Such a plan of life for two or three months must, I should imagine,
suit a man who has been for as many years struck from one end of
Europe to the other like a tennis-ball. At least I judge of you by
<PB N="439" REF="460"/>
myself. I always loved a quiet, studious, indolent life; but never
enjoyed the charms of it so truly, as since my return from an agree∣able
but fatiguing course of motion and hurry. However I shall
hear of your arrival, which can scarcely be so soon as January 1766,
and shall probably have the misfortune of meeting you in town soon
after. We may then settle any plans for the ensuing campaign.</P>
<P><HI>En attendant,</HI> (admire me, this is the only scrap of foreign lingo I
have imported into this epistle—if you had seen that of Guise to
me!) let me tell you a piece of Lausanne news. Nanette Grand is
married to Lieutenant-colonel Prevot. Grand wrote to me; and by
the next post I congratulated both father and daughter. There is
exactness for you. The Curchod (Madame Necker) I saw at Paris.
She was very fond of me, and the husband particularly civil. Could
they insult me more cruelly? Ask me every evening to supper; go
to bed, and leave me alone with his wife—what an impertinent secu∣rity!
it is making an old lover of mighty little consequence. She is
as handsome as ever, and much genteeler; seems pleased with her
fortune rather than proud of it. I was (perhaps indiscreetly enough)
exalting Nanette d'Illens's good luck and the fortune. What fortune?
(said she, with an air of contempt)—not above twenty thousand
livres a-year. I smiled, and she caught herself immediately.—
<Q>What airs I give myself in despising twenty thousand livres a-year,
who a year ago looked upon eight hundred as the summit of my
wishes.</Q></P>
<P>I must end this tedious scrawl. Let me hear from you: I think
I deserve it. Believe me, Dear Holroyd, I share in all your pleasures,
and feel all your misfortunes. Poor Bolton! I saw it in the news∣paper.
Is Ridley with you? I suspect not: but if he is, assure him
I do not forget him though he does me. Adieu; and believe me,
most affectionately yours,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>BERITON, <DATE>April 29, 1767.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR HOLROYD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAPPENED to-night to stumble upon a very odd piece of intel∣ligence
in the St. James's Chronicle; it related to the marriage
of a certain Monsieur Olroy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name was so spelt in the newspapers.</NOTE>, formerly Captain of Hussars. I do
not know how it came into my head that this Captain of Hussars
was not unknown to me, and that he might possibly be an acquaint∣ance
of yours. If I am not mistaken in my conjecture, pray give
my compliments to him, and tell him from me, that I am at least as
well pleased that he is married as if I were so myself. Assure him,
however, that though as a philosopher I may prefer celibacy, yet as
a politician I think it highly proper that the species should be propa∣gated
by the usual method; assure him even that I am convinced,
that if celibacy is exposed to fewer miseries, marriage can alone pro∣mise
real happiness, since domestic enjoyments are the source of
every other good. May such happiness, which is bestowed on few,
be given to him; the transient blessings of beauty, and the more
durable ones of fortune, good sense, and an amiable disposition.</P>
<P>I can easily conceive, and as easily excuse you, if you have
thought mighty little this winter of your poor rusticated friend. I
have been confined ever since Christmas, and confined by a succession
of very melancholy occupations. I had scarcely arrived at Beriton,
where I proposed staying only about a fortnight, when a brother of
Mrs. Gibbon's died unexpectedly, though after a very long and painful
illness. We were scarcely recovered from the confusion which such
an event must produce in a family, when my father was taken dan∣gerously
<PB N="441" REF="462"/>
ill, and with some intervals has continued so ever since.
I can assure you, my dear Holroyd, that the same event appears in
a very different light when the danger is serious and immediate; or
when, in the gaiety of a tavern dinner, we affect an insensibility that
would do us no great honour were it real. My father is now much
better; but I have since been assailed by a severe stroke—the loss of
a friend. You remember, perhaps, an officer of our militia, whom
I sometimes used to compare to yourself. Indeed, the comparison
would have done honour to any one. His feelings were tender and
noble, and he was always guided by them: his principles were just
and generous, and he acted up to them. I shall say no more, and
you will excuse my having said so much, of a man with whom you
were unacquainted; but my mind is just now so very full of him,
that I cannot easily talk, or even think, of any thing else. If I know
you right, you will not be offended at my <HI>weakness.</HI></P>
<P>What rather adds to my uneasiness, is the necessity I am under of
joining our militia the day after to-morrow. Though the lively
hurry of such a scene might contribute to divert my ideas, yet
every circumstance of it, and the place itself, (which was that of his
residence,) will give me many a painful moment. I know nothing
would better raise my spirits than a visit from you; the request may
appear unseasonable, but I think I have heard you speak of <HI>an uncle</HI>
you had near Southampton. At all events, I hope you will snatch a
moment to write to me, and give me some account of your present
situation and future designs. As you are now fettered, I should ex∣pect
you will not be such a <HI>hic et ubique</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The motto of the regiment called Royal Foresters, in which Mr. Holroyd had
been Captain.</NOTE>, as you have been since
your arrival in England. I stay at Southampton from the first to
the twenty-eighth of May, and then propose making a short visit to
town: if you are any where in the neighbourhood of it, you may
depend upon seeing me. I shall then concert measures for seeing a
<PB N="442" REF="463"/>
little more of you next winter, than I have lately done, as I hope to
take a pretty long spell in town. I suppose Guise has often fallen in
your way: he has never once written to me, nor I to him: in the
country we want materials, and in London we want time. I ought
to recollect, that you even want time to read my unmeaning scrawl.
Believe, however, my dear Holroyd, that it is the sincere expression
of a heart entirely yours.</P>

Our quantity has disappointed us very much; but I think,
that besides hops for the family, there will not be less than 500 l.;—
no contemptible sum off thirteen small acres, and two of them planted

that state of solitude; but, on sounding her, I am convinced that
she would think it unkind were I to leave her at present. I know

engross the conversation. She died without a will; and as her
savings were generally disposed of in charity, the small remains of
her personal fortune will make a trifling object when divided
among her children. Her favourite the Princess of B. very properly
insisted on the king's immediately sealing up all the papers, to
secure her from the idle reports which would be so readily swal∣lowed
by the great English monster. The business of Lord and

common hangman, as containing arbitrary, tory, high-flown doc∣trines.

<OPENER><DATELINE>THURCASTON, <DATE>August 29th, 1772.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very elegant letter on the antiquity and authenticity of the
book of Daniel, (just now received,) finds me here, if not without
leisure, yet without books, and therefore in no condition to enter far
into the depths of this controversy; which indeed is the less necessary,
as every thing that relates to the subject will come of course to be
considered by my learned successors in the new lecture. For as the
prophecies of Daniel make an important link in <HI>that chain, which,</HI> as
you say, <HI>has been let down from heaven to earth,</HI> (but not by the
author of the late sermons, who brought into view only what he
had not invented,) the grounds on which their authority rests will,
without doubt, be carefully examined, and, as I suppose, firmly
established.</P>
<P>But in the mean time, and to make at least some small return for
the civility of your address to me, I beg leave to trouble you with
two or three short remarks, such as occur to me on reading your
letter.</P>
<P>Your main difficulties are these two: 1. That the author of the
book of Daniel is too clear for a prophet; as appears from his pre∣diction
of the Persian and Macedonian affairs: and, 2. too fabulous
for a contemporary historian; as is evident, you suppose, from his
mistakes, particularly in the sixth chapter.</P>
<P>1. The first of these difficulties is an extraordinary one. For
why may not prophecy, if the inspirer think fit, be as clear as
history? Scriptural prophecy, whence your idea of its obscurity is
<PB N="456" REF="477"/>
taken, is <HI>occasionally</HI> thus clear, I mean after the event; and Daniel's
prophecy of the revolutions in the Grecian empire, would have been
obscure enough to Porphyry himself before it.</P>
<P>But your opinion, after all, when you come to explain yourself,
really is, as one should expect, that, as a prophet, Daniel is not
clear enough; for you enforce the old objection of Porphyry, by
observing, that where a pretended prophecy is clear to a certain
point of time, and afterwards obscure and shadowy, there common
sense leads one to conclude that the author of it was an impostor.</P>
<P>This reasoning is plausible, but not conclusive, unless it be taken for
granted, that a prophecy must, in all its parts, be equally clear and
precise: whereas, on the supposition of real inspiration, it may be
fit, I mean it may suit with the views of the inspirer, to predict some
things with more perspicuity, and in terms more obviously and
directly applicable to the events in which they were fulfilled, than
others. But further, this reasoning, whatever force it may have,
has no place here; at least you evidently beg the question when
you urge it; because the persons you dispute against maintain, that
the subsequent prophecies of Daniel are equally distinct with those
preceding ones concerning the Persian and Macedonian empires, at
least so much of them as they take to have been fulfilled; and that
to judge of the rest, we must wait for the conclusion of them.</P>
<P>However, you admit that the suspicion arising from the clearest
prophecy may be removed by direct positive evidence that it was
composed before the event. But then you carry your notions of
that evidence very far, when you require, <Q>that the existence of
such a prophecy, prior to its accomplishment, should be proved
by the knowledge of its being generally diffused amongst an en∣lightened
nation previous to that period, and its public existence
attested by an unbroken chain of authentic writers.</Q></P>
<P>What you here claim as a matter of <HI>right,</HI> is, without question, very
desirable, but should, I think, be accepted, if it be given at all, as a
<PB N="457" REF="478"/>
matter of <HI>favour.</HI> For what you describe is the utmost evidence that
the case admits: but what right have we in this, or any other sub∣ject
whatever of natural or revealed religion, to the utmost evidence?
Is it not enough that the evidence be sufficient to induce a reasonable
assent? and is not that assent reasonable, which is given to real
evidence, though of an inferior kind, when uncontrolled by any
greater? And such evidence we clearly have for the authenticity of
the book of Daniel, in the reception of it by the Jewish nation down
to the time of Jesus, whose appeal to it supposes and implies that
reception to have been constant and general: not to observe, that
the testimony of Jesus is further supported by all the considerations
that are alleged for his own divine character. To this evidence,
which is positive so far as it goes, you have nothing to oppose but
surmise and conjectures; that is, nothing that deserves to be called
evidence. But I doubt, Sir, you take for granted that the claim of
inspiration is never to be allowed, so long as there is a possibility of
supposing that it was not given.</P>
<P>II. In the second division of your letter, which is longer, and
more elaborate, than the first, you endeavour to shew that the <HI>his∣torical</HI>
part of the book of Daniel, chiefly that of the sixth chapter,
is false and fabulous, and as such, confutes and overthrows the <HI>pro∣phetical.</HI>
What you advance on this head, is contained under <HI>five</HI>
articles:</P>
<P>1. You think it strange that Daniel, or any other man, should be
promoted to a secret office of state, <HI>for his skill in divination.</HI></P>
<P>But here, first, you forget that Joseph was thus promoted for the
same reason. Or, if you object to this instance, what should hinder
the promotion either of Joseph or Daniel, (when their skill in divina∣tion
had once brought them to the notice and favour of their sove∣reign,)
for what you call <HI>mere human accomplishments?</HI> For such
<PB N="458" REF="479"/>
assuredly both these great men possessed, if we may believe the plain
part of their story, which asserts of Joseph, and indeed proves, that
he was in no common degree <HI>discreet and wise;</HI> and of Daniel,
that <HI>an excellent spirit was found in him;</HI> nay, that <HI>he had knowledge
and skill in all learning and wisdom,</HI> over and above his <HI>understanding
in all visions and dreams.</HI> In short, Sir, though princes of old might
not make it a rule to chuse their ministers out of their soothsayers,
yet neither would their being soothsayers, if they were otherwise
well accomplished, prevent them from being ministers. Just as in
modern times, though churchmen have not often, I will suppose,
been made officers of state, even by bigotten princes, because they
were churchmen; yet neither have they been always excluded from
serving in those stations when they have been found eminently qua∣lified
for them.</P>
<P>2. Your next exception is, that a combination could scarce have
been formed in the court of Babylon against the favourite minister,
(though such factions are common in other courts,) because the
courtiers of Darius <HI>must have apprehended that the piety of Daniel
would be asserted by a miraculous interposition;</HI> of which they had
seen a recent instance. And here, Sir, you expatiate with a little
too much complacency on the strange indifference which the ancient
world shewed to the gift of miracles. You do not, I dare say, ex∣pect
a serious answer to this charge; or if you do, it may be enough
to observe, what I am sure your own reading and experience must
have rendered very familiar to you, that the strongest belief, or con∣viction
of the mind, perpetually gives way to the inflamed selfish
passions; and that, when men have any scheme of interest or re∣venge
much at heart, they are not restrained from pursuing it, though
the scaffold and the axe stand before them in full view, and have
perhaps been streaming but the day before with the blood of other
state-criminals. I ask not, whether miracles have ever <HI>actually</HI>
<PB N="459" REF="480"/>
existed, but whether you do not think that multitudes have been
firmly <HI>persuaded</HI> of their existence; and yet their indifference about
them, is a fact which I readily concede to you.</P>
<P>3. Your third criticism is directed against what is said of <HI>the law
of the Medes and Persians, that it altereth not;</HI> where I find nothing to
admire, but the extreme rigour of Asiatic despotism. For I con∣sider
this irrevocability of the law, when once promulgated by the
sovereign, not as contrived to be a check on his will, but rather to
shew the irresistible and fatal course of it. And this idea was so
much cherished by the despots of Persia, that, rather than revoke
the iniquitous law, obtained by surprize, for exterminating the Jews,
Ahasuerus took the part, as we read in the book of Esther, (and as
Baron Montesquieu, I remember, observes,) to permit the Jews to
defend themselves against the execution of it; whence we see how
consistent this law is with the determination of the judges, quoted
by you from Herodotus, <Q>that it was lawful for the king to do
whatever he <HI>pleased:</HI></Q> for we understand that he did <HI>not</HI> please that
this law, when once declared by him, should be altered.</P>
<P>You add under this head, <Q>May I not assert that the Greek
writers, who have so copiously treated of the affairs of Persia,
have not left us the smallest vestige of a restraint, equally inju∣rious
to the monarch and prejudicial to the people.</Q> I have not
the Greek writers by me to consult, but a common book I chance
to have at hand refers me to one such vestige, in a very eminent
Greek historian, Diodorus Siculus. <HI>Lowth's Comment. in loc.</HI></P>
<P>4. A fourth objection to the historic truth of the book of Daniel is
taken, with more plausibility, from the matter of this law, which, as
you truly observe, was very strange for the king's counsellor to ad∣vise,
and for any despot whatever to enact.</P>
<P>But, 1. I a little question whether prayer was so constant and
considerable a part of Pagan worship as is supposed; and if it was
not, the prejudices of the people would not be so much shocked by
<PB N="460" REF="481"/>
this interdict as we are ready to think. Daniel indeed prayed three
times a day; but the idolaters might content themselves with pray∣ing
now and then at a stated solemnity. It is clear, that when you
speak of <HI>depriving men of the comforts, and priests of the profits, of
religion,</HI> you have Christian, and even modern principles and man∣ners
in your eye: perhaps in the <HI>comforts,</HI> you represented to your∣self
a company of poor inflamed Huguenots under persecution; and
in the <HI>profits,</HI> the lucrative trade of popish masses. But be this as
it may, it should be considered, 2. That this law could not, in the
nature of the thing, suppress all prayer, if the people had any great
propensity to it. It could not suppress <HI>mental</HI> prayer; it could not
even suppress <HI>bodily</HI> worship, if performed, as it easily might be, in
the night, or in secret. Daniel, it was well known, was used to
pray in open day-light, and in a place exposed to inspection, from
his usual manner of praying; which manner, it was easily concluded,
so zealous a votary as he was, would not change or discontinue, on
account of the edict. Lastly, though the edict passed for thirty
days, to make sure work, yet there was no doubt but the end pro∣posed
would be soon accomplished, and then it was not likely that
much care would be taken about the observance of it.</P>
<P>All this put together, I can very well conceive that extreme envy
and malice in the courtiers might suggest the idea of such a law, and
that an impotent despot might be flattered by it. Certainly, if what
we read in the third chapter be admitted, that <HI>one</HI> of these despots re∣quired
all people, nations, and languages, to worship his image on
pain of death, there is no great wonder that <HI>another</HI> of them should
demand the exclusive worship of himself for a month; nay, per∣haps,
he might think himself civil, and even bounteous to his gods,
when he left them a share of the other eleven. For as to the pre∣sumption,
<Q><L>"Nihil est quod credere de se</L>
<L>Non possit, cum laudatur diis aequa potestas.—</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="482"/>
5. A fifth, and what you seem to think the strongest, objection
to the credit of the book of Daniel is, that <Q>no such person as
Darius the Mede is to be found in the succession of the Babylonish
princes,</Q> (you mean as given in Ptolemy's canon and the Greek
writers,) <Q>between the time of Nebuchadnezzar and that of Cyrus.</Q>
In saying this, you do not forget or disown what our ablest chrono∣logers
have said on the subject; but then you object that Xenophon's
Cyaxares (to serve a turn) has been made to personate Darius the
Mede; and yet that Xenophon's book, whether it be a romance or
a true history, overturns the use which they have made of this
hypothesis.</P>
<P>I permit myself perhaps to be too much flattered by your civility
in referring me to my own taste, rather than to the authority of
Cicero: but the truth is, I am much disposed to agree with you,
that, <Q>if we unravel with any care the sine texture of the Cyro∣poedia,
we shall discover in every thread the Spartan discipline
and the philosophy of Socrates.</Q> But then, as the judicious
author chose to make so recent a story as that of Cyrus, and one so well
known, the vehicle of his political and moral instructions, he would
be sure to keep up to the truth of the story as far as might be; espe∣cially
in the leading facts, and in the principal persons, as we may
say, of the drama. This obvious rule of decorum such a writer as
Xenophon could not fail to observe; and therefore, on the supposi∣tion
that his Cyropoedia is a romance, I should conclude certainly
that the outline of it was genuine history. But,</P>
<P>2. If it be so, you conclude that there is no ground for thinking
that Darius the Mede ever reigned at Babylon, because Cyaxares
himself never reigned there.</P>
<P>Now, on the idea of Xenophon's book being a romance, there
might be good reason for the author's taking no notice of the short
reign of Cyaxares, which would break the unity of his work, and
divert the reader's attention too much from the hero of it: while yet
<PB N="462" REF="483"/>
the omission could hardly seem to violate historic truth, since the
lustre of his hero's fame, and the real power, which, out of question,
he reserved to himself, would make us forget or overlook Cyaxares.
But, as to the fact, it seems no way incredible that Cyrus should
concede to his royal ally, his uncle, and his father-in-law, (for he
was all these,) the <HI>nominal</HI> possession of the sovereignty; or that he
should <HI>share</HI> the sovereignty with him; or, at least, that he should
leave the <HI>administration,</HI> as we say, in his hands at Babylon, while
he himself was prosecuting his other conquests at a distance. Any
of these things is supposable enough; and I would rather admit any
of them than reject the express, the repeated, the circumstantial
testimony of a not confessedly fabulous historian.</P>
<P>After all, Sir, I should forfeit, I know, your good opinion, if I
did not acknowledge that some, at least, of these circumstances are
such as one should not, perhaps, expect at first sight. But then such
is the condition of things here; and what is true in human life, is
not always, I had almost said, not often, that which was previously
to be expected; whence an ordinary romance is, they say, more
<HI>probable</HI> than the best history.</P>
<P>But should any or all of these circumstances convince you per∣fectly,
that some degree of error or fiction is to be found in the book
of Daniel, it would be too precipitate to conclude that therefore the
whole book was of no authority: for, at most, you could but infer,
that the historical part, in which those circumstances are observed,
namely, the 6th chapter, is not genuine; just as you know has been
judged of some other historical tracts which had formerly been in∣serted
in the book of Daniel. For it is not with these collections,
which go under the names of the Prophets, as with some regularly
connected system, where a charge of falsehood, if made good against
one part, shakes the credit of the whole. Fictitious histories may
have been joined to true prophecies, when all that bore the name of
the same person, or any way related to him, came to be put together
<PB N="463" REF="484"/>
in the same volume: but the detection of such misalliance could
not affect the prophecies; certainly not those of Daniel, which
respect <HI>the latter times;</HI> for these have an intrinsic evidence in them∣selves,
and assert their own authenticity, in proportion as we see, or
have reason to admit the accomplishment of them.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have only to commit these hasty reflections to
your candour; a virtue which cannot be separated from the love of
truth, and of which I observe many traces in your agreeable letter;
and if you should indulge this quality still further, so as to conceive
the possibility of that being <HI>true and reasonable,</HI> in matters of religion,
which may seem strange, or, to so lively a fancy as yours, even ridi∣culous,
you would not hurt the credit of your excellent understand∣ing,
and would thus remove one, perhaps a principal, occasion of
those mists which, as you complain, <HI>hang over these nice and difficult
subjects.</HI></P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<HEAD>The following Fragment was found with the foregoing Letter, in
Mr. GIBBON's handwriting.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR answers to my five objections against the 6th chapter of
Daniel come next to be considered.</P>
<P>1. With regard to Daniel's promotion, I consent to withdraw my
opposition, and to allow the eases of Ximenes, Wolsey, and Richlieu
as parallel instances; though there is surely some difference between
a young foreign soothsayer being <HI>suddenly</HI> rewarded, for the inter∣pretation
of a dream, with the government of Babylon, and a priest
of the established church, rising gradually to the great offices of
state.</P>
<P>2. You apprehend, Sir, that my second objection scarcely deserves
a serious answer; and that it is quite sufficient to appeal to my own
reading and experience, whether <HI>the strongest conviction of the mind
<PB N="464" REF="485"/>
does not perpetually give way to the inflamed and selfish passions.</HI> Since
you appeal to me, I shall fairly lay before you the result of my ob∣servations
on that subject. 1. It must be confessed that the drunkard
often sinks into the grave, and the prodigal into a gaol, without a
possibility of deceiving or of checking themselves. But they sink by
slow degrees; and, whilst they indulge the ruling passion, attend
only to the trifling moment of each guinea, or of each bottle, with∣out
calculating their accumulated weight, till they feel themselves
irretrievably crushed under it. 2. In most of the hazardous inter∣prizes
of life there is a mixture of chance and good fortune; what is
called good fortune, is often the effect of skill: and as our vanity
flatters us into an opinion of our superior merit, we are neither sur∣prised
nor dismayed by the miscarriage of our rash predecessors.
<HI>The conspirator turns his eyes from the axe and scaffold, perhaps still
streaming with blood,</HI> to the successful boldness of Sylla, of Caesar,
and of Cromwell; and convinces himself that on such a golden pur∣suit
it is even <HI>prudent</HI> to stake a precarious and insipid life. We may
add, that the most daring flights of ambition are as often the effects
of necessity as of choice. The princes of Hindostan must either
reign or perish; and when Caesar passed the Rubicon, it was scarcely
possibly for him to return to a private station. 3. You think, Sir,
we may learn from our own experience, that an indifference con∣cerning
miracles is very compatible with a full conviction of their
truth; and so it undoubtedly is with such a conviction as we have
an opportunity of observing.</P>

<P>I AM just arrived, as well as yourself, at my <HI>dii penates,</HI> but with
very different intention. You will ever remain a bigot to those
rustic deities; I propose to abjure them soon, and to reconcile myself
to the catholic church of London.</P>
<P>I am so happy, so exquisitely happy, at feeling so many mountains
taken off my shoulders, that I can brave your indignation, and even
the three-forked lightning of Jupiter himself. My reasons for taking
so unwarrantable a step (approved of by Hugonin) were no unmanly
despondency, (though it daily became more apparent how much
the farm would suffer, both in reality and in reputation, by another
year's management). *.
I see pleasure but not use in a congress, therefore decline it. I know
nothing as yet of a purchaser, and can only give you full and un∣limited
powers. If you think it necessary, let me know when you
sell; but, however, do as you please.</P>
<P>I am sincerely glad to hear Mrs. H. is better. Still think Bath
would suit her. She, and you too, I fear, rather want the physic
of the mind, than of the body. Tell me something about yourself.
If, among a crowd of acquaintances, one friend can afford you any
comfort, I am quite at your service. Once more, adieu.</P>

<P>BY this time, I suppose you returned to the Elysian fields of Shef∣field.
The country (I do not mean any particular reflections on
Sussex) must be vastly pleasant at this time of the year! For my
own part, the punishment of my sins has at length overtaken me.
On Thursday the third of December, in the present year of our
Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two, between the
hours of one and two in the afternoon, as I was crossing St. James's
church-yard, I stumbled, and <HI>again sprained my foot;</HI> but, alas!
after two days pain and confinement, a horrid monster, <HI>ycleped the
gout,</HI> made me a short visit; and though he has now taken his leave,
I am full of apprehensions that he may have liked my company well
enough to call again.</P>
<P>The parliament, after a few soft murmurs, is gone to sleep, to
awake again after Christmas, safely folded in Lord North's arms.
The town is gone into the country, and I propose <HI>visiting Sheffield</HI>
about Sunday se'nnight, if by that time I can get my household
preparations (I have as good as taken Lady Rous's lease in Bentinck∣street)
in any forwardness. Shall I <HI>angle for Batt?</HI> No news
stirring, except the Duchess of G.'s pregnancy certainly declared.
* called on me the other day, and has taken my plan with
him to consider it; he still wishes to defer to spring; talks of bad
roads, &amp;c. and is very absolute. I remonstrated, <HI>but want to know
whether I am to submit.</HI> Adieu. <HI>Godfrey Clarke,</HI> who is writing

<P>MY schemes with regard to you have been entirely disappointed.
The business that called me to town was not ready before the
20th of last month, and the same business has kept me here till now.
I have however a very strong inclination to eat a Christmas mince
pie with you; and let me tell you that inclination is no small com∣pliment.
What are the trees and waters of Sheffield-Place, compared
with the comfortable smoke, lazy dinners, and inflammatory Junius's,
which we can every day enjoy in town? You have seen the last
Junius? He calls on the distant legions to march to the Capitol,
and free us from the tyranny of the Praetorian guards. I cannot
answer for the ghost of the <HI>hic et ubique,</HI> but the Hampshire militia
are determined to keep the peace for fear of a broken head. After
all, do I mean to make you a visit next week? Upon my soul, I
cannot tell. I tell every body that I shall: I know that I cannot
pass the week with any man in the world with whom the pleasure
of seeing each other will be more sincere or more reciprocal. Yet,
<HI>entre nous,</HI> I do not believe that I shall be able to get out of this
town before you come into it. At all events I look forwards, with

<P>LENBOROUGH is no more! * acted like a Jew, and I
dare say now repents it. In his room * found me a
better man, a rich, brutish, honest horse-dealer, who has got a great
fortune by serving the cavalry. On Thursday he saw Lenborough,
on Friday came to town with *, and this morning at nine
o'clock we struck at 20,000 l. after a very hard battle. As times go,
I am not dissatisfied. * and the new Lord of Lenborough
(by name *) dined with me; and though we did not speak
the same language, yet by the help of signs, such as that of putting
about the bottle, the natives seemed well satisfied.</P>
<P>The whole world is going down to Portsmouth, where they will
enjoy the pleasures of smoke, noise, heat, bad lodgings, and ex∣pensive
reckonings. For my own part, I have firmly resisted im∣portunity,
declined parties, and mean to pass the busy week in the
soft retirement of my <HI>bocage</HI> de Bentinck-street. Yesterday the East
India Company positively refused the loan: a noble resolution, could
they get money any where else. They are violent; and it was
moved, and the motion heard with some degree of approbation,
that they should instantly abandon India to Lord North, Sujah
Dowlah, or the Devil, if he chose to take it.</P>

<P>I BEG ten thousand pardons for not being dead, as I certainly ought
to be. But such is my abject nature, that I had rather live in
Bentinck-street, attainted and convicted of the sin of laziness, than
enjoy your applause either at old Nick's or even in the Elysian Fields.
After all, could you expect that I should honour with my corre∣spondence
a wild barbarian of the Bogs of Erin? Had the natives
intercepted my letter, the terrors occasioned by such unknown magic
characters might have been fatal to you. But now you have escaped
the fury of their hospitality, and are arrived among a cee-vi-leezed
nation, I may venture to renew my intercourse.</P>
<P>You tell me of a long list of dukes, lords, and chieftains of re∣nown
to whom you are introduced; were I with you, I should
prefer one <HI>David</HI> to them all. When you are at Edinburgh, I hope
you will not fail to visit the stye of that fattest of Epicurus's hogs,
and inform yourself whether there remains no hope of its reco∣vering
the use of its right paw. There is another animal of <HI>great,</HI>
though not perhaps of <HI>equal,</HI> and certainly not of <HI>similar</HI> merit,
one Robertson; has he almost created the new world? Many other
men you have undoubtedly seen, in the country where you are at
present, who must have commanded your esteem: but when you
return, if you are not very honest, you will possess great advantages
over me in any dispute concerning Caledonian merit.</P>
<P>Boodle's and Atwood's are now no more. The last stragglers,
and Godfrey Clarke in the rear of all, are moved away to their
<PB N="471" REF="492"/>
several castles; and I now enjoy, in the midst of London, a delicious
solitude. My library, Kensington Gardens, and a few parties with
new acquaintance who are chained to London, (among whom I
reckon Goldsmith and Sir Joshua Reynolds,) fill up my time, and
the monster <HI>Ennui</HI> preserves a very respectful distance. By the bye,
your friends Batt, Sir John Russell, and Lascelles, dined with me one
day before they set off; for I sometimes give the prettiest little dinner
in the world. But all this composure draws near its conclusion.
About the sixteenth of this month Mr. Eliot carries me away, and after
picking up Mrs. Gibbon at Bath, sets me down at Port Eliot: there
I shall certainly remain six weeks, or, in other words, to the end of
September. My future motions, whether to London, Derbyshire,
or a longer stay in Cornwall, (pray is not "motion to stay" rather
in the Hibernian style?) will depend on the life of Port Eliot, the
time of the meeting of parliament, and perhaps the impatience of
Mr. *, Lord of Lenborough. One of my pleasures in
town I forgot to mention, the unexpected visit of Deyverdun, who
accompanies his young lord (very young indeed!) on a two months
tour to England. He took the opportunity of the Earl's going
down to the Duke of *, to spend a fortnight (nor do
I recollect a more pleasant one) in Bentinck-street. They are now
gone together into Yorkshire, and I think it doubtful whether I
shall see him again before his return to Leipsic. It is a melancholy
reflection, that while one is plagued with acquaintance at the corner
of every street, real friends should be separated from each other by
unsurmountable bars, and obliged to catch at a few transient mo∣ments
of interview. I desire that you and my Lady (whom I
most respectfully greet) would take your share of that very new
and acute observation, not so large a share indeed as my Swiss friend,
since nature and fortune give <HI>us</HI> more frequent opportunities of being
together. You cannot expect news from a desart, and such is
<PB N="472" REF="493"/>
London at present. The papers give you the full harvest of public
intelligence; and I imagine that the eloquent nymphs of Twicken∣ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miss Cambridges.</NOTE>
communicate all the transactions of the polite, the amorous,
and the marrying world. The great pantomime of Portsmouth was
universally admired; and I am angry at my own laziness in ne∣glecting
an excellent opportunity of seeing it. Foote has given us
the Bankrupt, a serious and sentimental piece, with very severe
strictures on the licence of scandal in attacking private characters.
Adieu. Forgive and epistolize me. I shall not believe you sincere
in the former, unless you make Bentinck-street your inn. I fear
I shall be gone; but Mrs. Ford<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His housekeeper.</NOTE> and the parrot will be proud to
receive you and my Lady after your long peregrination, from
which I expect great improvements. Has she got the brogue upon

<P>BY this time you have surely finished your tour, touched at Edin∣burgh,
where you found a letter, which you have not answered,
and are now contemplating the beauties of the Weald of Sussex. I
shall demand a long and particular account of your peregrina∣tions,
but will excuse it till we meet; and for the present ex∣pect
only a short memorandum of your health and situation, to∣gether
with that of my much-honoured friend Mrs. Abigail Hol∣royd.
A word too, if you please, concerning father and sister; to
<PB N="473" REF="494"/>
the latter I enclose a receipt from Mrs. G. who is now with me at
Port Eliot.</P>
<P>Blind as you accuse me of being to the beauties of nature, I am
wonderfully pleased with this country. Of her three dull notes,
<HI>ground, plants,</HI> and <HI>water,</HI> Cornwall possesses the first and last in
very high perfection. Think of a hundred solitary streams peace∣fully
gliding between amazing cliffs on one side, and rich meadows
on the other, gradually swelling by the aid of the tide into noble
rivers, successively losing themselves in each other, and all at length
terminating in the harbour of Plymouth, whose broad expanse is
irregularly <HI>dotted</HI> with two-and-forty line of battle ships. In plants
indeed we are deficient; and though all the gentlemen now attend
to posterity, the country will for a long time be very naked. We
have spent several days agreeably enough in little parties; but in
general our time rolls away in complete uniformity. Our landlord
possesses neither a pack of hounds, nor a stable of running horses,
nor a large farm, nor a good library. The last only could interest
me; but it is singular that a man of fortune, who chooses to
pass nine months of the year in the country, should have none of
them.</P>
<P>According to our present design, Mrs. G. and myself return to
Bath about the beginning of next month. I shall probably make
but a short stay with her, and defer my Derbyshire journey till ano∣ther
year. Sufficient for the summer is the evil thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> one
distant country excursion. Natural inclination, the prosecution of
my great work, and the conclusion of my Lenborough business,
plead strongly in favour of London. However I desire, and one
always finds time for what one really desires, to visit Sheffield-Place
before the end of October, should it only be for a few days.
I know several houses where I am invited to think myself at home,
but I know no other where I seem inclined to accept of the invita∣tion.
<PB N="474" REF="495"/>
I forgot to tell you, that I have declined the publication of
Lord Chesterfield's Letters. The public will see them, and upon
the whole, I think, with pleasure; but the family were strongly
bent against it; and especially on Deyverdun's account, I deemed
it more prudent to avoid making them my personal enemies.</P>

<P>AT length I am a little more at liberty. Godfrey Clarke went
out of town this morning. Instead of going directly into Der∣byshire,
where he would have been overwhelmed with visits, &amp;c.
he has taken his sister, brother, and aunts to a villa near Farnham,
in which he has the happiness of having no neighbourhood. If my
esteem and friendship for Godfrey had been capable of any addition,
it would have been very much increased by the manner in which he
<PB N="480" REF="501"/>
felt and lamented his father's death. He is now in very different
circumstances than before; instead of an easy and ample allowance,
he has taken possession of a great estate, with low rents and high
incumbrances. I hope the one may make amends for the other:
under your conduct I am sure they would, and I have freely offered
him your assistance, in case he should wish to apply for it.</P>
<P>In the mean time I must not forget my own affairs, which seem
to be covered with inextricable perplexity. * * *, as I men∣tioned
about a century ago, promised to see * * * and his at∣torney,
and to oil the wheels of the arbitration. As yet I have not
heard from him. I have some thoughts of writing <HI>myself</HI> to the
jockey, stating the various steps of the affair, and offering him, with
polite firmness, the <HI>immediate</HI> choice of Chancery or arbitration.</P>
<P>For the time, however, I forgot all these difficulties, in the pre∣sent
enjoyment of Deyverdun's company; and I glory in thinking,
that although my house is small, it is just of a sufficient size to hold
my real friends, male and <HI>female;</HI> among the latter my Lady holds
the very first place.</P>
<P>We are all quiet.—American business is suspended and almost for∣got.
The other day we had a brisk report of a Spanish war. It
was said they had taken one of our Leward Islands. It since turns
out, that we are the invaders, but the invasion is trifling.</P>

<P>I BEGIN to flag, and though you already reproach me as a bad
correspondent, I much fear that I shall every week become a
more hardened sinner. Besides the occasional obstructions of Clarke
and Deyverdun, I must intreat you to consider, with your usual
candour, 1. The aversion to epistolary conversation, which it has
pleased the daemon to implant in my nature. 2. That I am a very
fine gentleman, a subscriber to the masquerade, where you and my
Lady ought to come, and am now writing at Boodle's, in a fine velvet
coat, with ruffles of my lady's choosing, &amp;c. 3. That the aforesaid
fine gentleman is likewise an historian; and in truth, when I am
writing a page, I do not only think it a sufficient reason for delay, but
even consider myself as writing for you, and that, much more to the
purpose than if I were sending you the little tattle of the town, of
which indeed there is none stirring. With regard to America, the
Minister seems moderate, and the House obedient.</P>
<P>* * *'s last letter, by some unaccountable accident, had never
reached me; so that your's, in every instance, amazed me. I imme∣diately
dispatched to him groans and approbation. * * *, however,
gives me very little uneasiness. I see that he is a bully, and that I
have a stick. But the cursed business of Lenborough, in the midst
of study, dissipation, and friendship, at times almost distracts me. I
am surely in a worse situation than before I sold the estate, and what
distresses me is, that</P>

<P>LAST night was the triumph of Boodle's. Our masquerade cost
two thousand guineas; a sum that might have fertilised a pro∣vince,
(I speak in your own style,) vanished in a few hours, but
not without leaving behind it the fame of the most splendid and ele∣gant
<HI>féte,</HI> that was perhaps ever given in a seat of the arts and opu∣lence.
It would be as difficult to describe the magnificence of the
scene, as it would be easy to record the humour of the night. The
one was above, the other below, all relation. I left the Pantheon
about five this morning, rose at ten, took a good walk, and returned
home to a more rational entertainment of Batt, Sir John Russell, and
Lascelles, who dined with me. They have left me this moment; and
were I to enumerate the things said of Sheffield, it would form a
much longer letter than I have any inclination to write. Let it
suffice, that Sir John means to pass in Sussex the interval of the two
terms. Every thing, in a word, goes on very pleasantly, except
the terrestrial business of Lenborough. Last Saturday se'nnight I
wrote to * * * *, to press him to see * * *, and urge the ar∣bitration.
He has not <HI>condescended</HI> to answer me. All is a dead
calm, sometimes more fatal than a storm. For God's sake send me

<P>DO you remember that there exists in the world one Edward
Gibbon, a housekeeper in Bentinck-street? If the standard
of writing and of affection were the same, I am sure he would ill-deserve
it. I do not wish to discover, how many days (I am afraid
I ought to use another word) have elapsed since the date of my last,
or even of your last letter, and yet such is the sluggish nature of the
beast, that I am afraid nothing but the arrival of Mrs. Bonfoy, and
the expectation of Mr. Eliot, could have roused me from my le∣thargy.
The Lady gave me great satisfaction, by her general ac∣count
of your health and spirits, but communicated some uneasiness,
by the mention of a little encounter, in the style of one of Don
Quixote's, but which proved, I hope, as trifling as you at first ima∣gined
it. For my own part, I am well in mind and body, busy
with my books, (which may perhaps produce something next year,
either to tire or amuse the world,) and every day more satisfied with
my present mode of life, which I always believed was calculated to
make me happy. My only remaining uneasiness is Lenborough,
which is not terminated. By Holroyd's advice, I rather try what
may be obtained by a little more patience, than rush at once into
the horrors of Chancery. But let us talk of something else. Mrs.
Porten grows younger every day. You remember, I think, in New∣man-street,
an agreeable woman, Miss W ****. The Under-secre∣tary
is seriously in love with her, and seriously uneasy that his preca∣rious
situation precludes him from happiness. We shall soon see which
will get the better, love or reason. I bet three to two on love.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="505"/>
Guess my surprise, when Mrs. Gibbon of Northamptonshire sud∣denly
communicated her arrival. I immediately went to Surrey∣street,
where she lodged, but though it was no more than half
an hour after nine, the Saint had finished her evening devotions,
and was already retired to rest. Yesterday morning (by appoint∣ment)
I breakfasted with her at eight o'clock, dined with her to∣day
at two in Newman-street, and am just returned from setting her
down. She is, in truth, a very great curiosity: her dress and figure
exceed any thing we had at the masquerade: her language and ideas
belong to the last century. However, in point of religion she was
rational; that is to say, silent. I do not believe that she asked a
single question, or said the least thing concerning it. To me she
behaved with great cordiality, and <HI>in her way</HI> expressed a great
regard.</P>
<P>Mrs. Porten tells me, that she has just written to you. She ought
to go to a masquerade once a year. Did you think her such a girl?</P>

<P>SOMETIMES people do not write because they are too idle, and
sometimes because they are too busy. The former was usually
my case, but at present it is the latter. The fate of Europe and
America seems fully sufficient to take up the time of one man; and
especially of a man who gives up a great deal of time for the pur∣pose
of public and private information. I think I have sucked
Mauduit and Hutcheson very dry; and if my confidence was equal
to my eloquence, and my eloquence to my knowledge, perhaps I
might make no very intolerable speaker. At all events, I fancy I
shall try to expose myself.</P>

both our trade and empire. We expect next Thursday or Friday to

reading papers, and rejecting petitions. Petitions were brought from
London, Bristol, Norwich, &amp;c. framed by party, and designed to
delay. By the aid of some parliamentary quirks, they have been all
referred to a separate inactive committee, which Burke calls a com∣mittee

<P>I AM not d—d, according to your charitable wishes, because I

Lord George Germaine nor myself could find room for a single
word. The principal men both days were Fox and Wedderburne,
on the opposite sides; the latter displayed his usual talents; the for∣mer,
taking the vast compass of the question before us, discovered
powers for regular debate, which neither his friends hoped, nor his
enemies dreaded. We voted an address, (three hundred and four to
one hundred and five,) of lives and fortunes, declaring Massachussets
Bay in a state of rebellion. More troops, but I fear not enough,
go to America, to make an army of ten thousand men at Boston;
three generals, Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton. In a few days we
stop the ports of New England. I cannot write volumes; but I am
more and more convinced, that with firmness all may go well; yet I
sometimes doubt. I am now writing with ladies, (Sir S. Porten

<P>I HARDLY know how to take up the pen. I talked in my last of

many have elapsed. I will endeavour for the future to be less scan∣dalous.
Only believe that my heart is innocent of the laziness of
my hand. I do not mean to have recourse to the stale and absurd
excuse of business, though I have really had a very considerable
hurry of new parliamentary business: one day, for instance, of se∣venteen
hours, from ten in the morning till between three and four
the next morning. It is, upon the whole, an agreeable improve∣ment
in my life, and forms just the mixture of business, of study,
and of society, which I always imagined I should, and now find I
do like. Whether the House of Commons may ever prove of be∣nefit
to myself or country, is another question. As yet I have been
mute. In the course of our American affairs, I have sometimes had
a wish to speak, but though I felt tolerably prepared as to the matter,
I dreaded exposing myself in the manner, and remained in my seat
safe, but inglorious. Upon the whole, (though I still believe I shall
try,) I doubt whether Nature, not that in some instances I am un∣grateful,

came into parliament much too late to exert them. Do you hear of

The <HI>head</HI> is now printing: true, but it was written last year and the

to the friendly critic, it is very difficult to find one who has leisure,
candour, freedom, and knowledge sufficient. However, Batt and
Deyverdun have read and observed. After all, the public is the best
critic. I print no more than five hundred copies of the first edition;
and the second (as it happens frequently to my betters) may receive
many improvements. So much for Rome. We have nothing new
from America. But I can venture to assure you, that administration
is now as unanimous and decided as the occasion requires. Some∣thing
will be done this year; but in the Spring the force of the

Papists, Hanoverians, Canadians, Indians, &amp;c. will all in various

<P>I SEND you two pieces of intelligence from the best authority, and
which, unless you hear them from some other quarter, I do not
wish you should talk much about. 1st, When the Russians arrive,
(if they refresh themselves in England or Ireland,) will you go and
see their camp? We have great hopes of getting a body of these
Barbarians. In consequence of some very plain advances, King
George, with his own hand, wrote a very polite epistle to sister
Kitty, requesting her friendly assistance. Full powers and instruc∣tions
were sent at the same time to Gunning, to agree for any force
between five, and twenty thousand men, <HI>carte blanche</HI> for the terms;
on condition, however▪ that they should serve, not as auxiliaries,
but as mercenaries, and that the Russian general should be absolutely
under the command of the British. They daily and hourly expect
a messenger, and hope to hear that the business is concluded. The
worst of it is, that the Baltic will soon be frozen up, and that it must
be late next year before they can get to America. 2. In the mean
time we are not quite easy about Canada; and even if it should be
safe from an attack, we cannot flatter ourselves with the expectation
of bringing down that martial people on the Back Settlements. The
priests are ours; the gentlemen very prudently wait the event, and
are disposed to join the stronger party; but the same lawless spirit
and impatience of government which have infected our Colonies, are
gone forth among the Canadian peasants, over whom, since the
conquest, the noblesse have lost much of their ancient influence.
Another thing which will please and surprise, is the assurance which
<PB N="496" REF="517"/>
I received from a man who might tell me a lie, but who could not
be mistaken, that no arts, no management whatsoever, have been
used to procure the addresses which fill the Gazette, and that Lord
North was as much surprised at the first that came up, as we could
be at Sheffield. We shall have, I suppose, some brisk skirmishing
in parliament, but the business will soon be decided by our superior
weight of fire. `<HI>A propos,</HI> I believe there has been some vague but
serious conversation about <HI>calling out the militia.</HI> The new levies go

<P>HOW do you do? Are you alive? Are you buried under mountains
of snow? I write merely to triumph in the superiority of my own
situation, and to rejoice in my own prudence, in not going down to
Sheffield-place, as I seriously, but foolishly, intended to do last week.
We proceed triumphantly with the Roman Empire, and shall certainly
make our appearance before the end of next month. I have nothing
public. You know we have got eighteen thousand Germans from
Hesse, Brunswick, and Hesse Darmstadt. I think our meeting will
be lively; a spirited minority, and a desponding majority. The
higher people are placed, the more gloomy are their countenances, the
more melancholy their language. You may call this cowardice, but
I fear it arises from their knowledge (a late knowledge) of the dif∣ficulty
and magnitude of the business. Quebec is not <HI>yet</HI> taken. I
hear that Carleton is determined never to capitulate with rebels. A
glorious resolution, if it were supported with fifty thousand men!
Adieu. I embrace my Lady and Maria. Make my excuses to the
latter, for having neglected her birth-day.</P>

<P>* * * * SINCE my last I have read Mr. Gibbon's His∣tory
with much attention, and great pleasure.
It is a work of very high merit indeed. He possesses that industry
<PB N="499" REF="520"/>
of research, without which no man deserves the name of an Historian.
His narrative is perspicuous and interesting; his style is elegant and
forcible, though in some passages I think rather too laboured, and in
others too quaint. But these defects are amply compensated by the
beauty of the general flow of language, and a very peculiar hap∣piness
in many of his expressions. I have traced him in many of
his quotations, (for experience has taught me to suspect the accuracy
of my brother pen-men,) and I find he refers to no passage but what
he has seen with his own eyes. I hope the book will be as successful
as it deserves to be. I have not yet read the two last chapters, but
am sorry, from what I have heard of them, that he has taken such
a tone in them as will give great offence, and hurt the sale of the
book.</P>

with great deference, and join with every one else, in applauding
the extent of your plan, in hands so well able to execute it. Some

but am told that many doubt of your orthodoxy. I wish to be always
of the charitable side, while I own you have proved that the clearest

<P>***** I AM very much taken with Mr. Gibbon's
Roman History, which came from your
press, and am glad to hear of its success. There will no books of
reputation now be printed in London but through your hands and Mr.
Cadell's. The Author tells me, that he is already preparing a second
edition. I resolved to have given him my advice with regard to the
manner of printing it; but as I am now writing to you, it is the
same thing. He ought certainly to print the number of the chapter
at the head of the margin; and it would be better if something of
the contents could also be added. One is also plagued with his notes,
according to the present method of printing the book: when a note
is announced, you turn to the end of the volume; and there you
<PB N="501" REF="522"/>
often find nothing but a reference to an authority. All these autho∣rities
ought only to be printed at the margin, or the bottom of the
page. I desire a copy of my new edition should be sent to Mr.
Gibbon; as wishing that gentleman, whom I so highly value, should
peruse me in a form the least imperfect to which I can bring my
work.</P>
<P>***** Dr. Smith's performance is another excellent
work that has come from your press this winter; but I have ven∣tured
to tell him, that it requires too much thought to be as popular
as Mr. Gibbon's.</P>

<P>I SHOULD make some apology for not writing you sooner an an∣swer
to your obliging letter: but if you should honour me fre∣quently
with such requests, you will find, that, with very good in∣tentions,
I am a very dilatory and irregular correspondent. I am
sorry to tell you, that our respectable friend<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hume.</NOTE> is still declining in his
health; he is greatly emaciated, and loses strength. He talks fami∣liarly
of his near prospect of dying. His mother, it seems, died
under the same symptoms; and it appears so little necessary, or
proper, to flatter him, that no one attempts it. I never observed
his understanding more clear, or his humour more pleasant and
lively. He has a great aversion to leave the tranquillity of his own
house, to go in search of health among inns and hostlers. And his
friends here gave way to him for some time; but now think it
necessary that he should make an effort to try what change of place
and air, or any thing else Sir John Pringle may advise, can do for
<PB N="502" REF="523"/>
him. I left him this morning in the mind to comply in this article,
and I hope that he will be prevailed on to set out in a few days. He
is just now sixty-five.</P>
<P>I am very glad that the pleasure you give us recoils a little on
yourself, through our feeble testimony. I have, as you suppose,
been employed, at any intervals of leisure or rest I have had for
some years, in taking notes, or collecting materials, for a History
of the distractions that broke down the Roman Republic, and
ended in the establishment of Augustus and his immediate successors.
The compliment you are pleased to pay, I cannot accept of, even to
my subject. Your subject now appears with advantages it was not
supposed to have had; and I suspect that the magnificence of the
mouldering ruin will appear more striking, than the same building
when the view is perplexed with scaffolding, workmen, and disor∣derly
lodgers, and the ear is stunned with the noise of destructions
and repairs, and the alarms of fire. The night which you begin
to describe is solemn, and there are gleams of light superior to what
is to be found in any other time. I comfort myself, that as my
trade is the study of human nature, I could not fix on a more inte∣resting
corner of it, than the end of the Roman Republic. Whether
my compilations should ever deserve the attention of any one besides
myself, must remain to be determined after they are farther advanced.
I take the liberty to trouble you with the inclosed for Mr. Smith,
whose uncertain stay in London makes me at a loss how to direct for
him. You have both such reason to be pleased with the world just
now, that I hope you are pleased with each other.</P>

<P>I AM angry that you should impede my noble designs of visiting

Wilful had not, that of understanding your foreign lingos. With
regard to Mrs. Gibbon, her intended visit, to which I was not to∣tally
a stranger, will do me honour; and, though it should delay
my emigration till the end of July, there will still remain the months
of August, September, and October. Above all, abstain from giving
the least hint to any Bath correspondent, and perhaps, if I am not
provoked by opposition, the thing may not be absolutely certain.
At all events, you may depend on a previous visit. At present, I
am very busy with the Neckers. I live with her, just as I used to do
twenty years ago, laugh at her Paris varnish, and oblige her to be∣come
a simple reasonable Suissesse. The man who might read
English husbands' lessons of proper and dutiful behaviour, is a sensible
good-natured creature. In about a fortnight I launch again into the

never remembered so eager and impatient a demand for a second

people do not even know what lies to invent. The news from Ame∣rica
have indeed diverted the public attention into another, and far
greater, channel. All that you see in the papers, of the repulse at
Quebec, as well as the capture of Lee, rests on the authority (a
very unexceptionable one) of the provincial papers, as they have
been transmitted by Governor Tryon from New York. Howe is
well, and eats plentifully; and the weather seems to clear up so fast,
that, according to the English custom, we have passed from the lowest
despondency to a full assurance of success. My new birth happened

<P>YES, yes, I am alive, and well; but what shall I say? Town
grows empty, and this house, where I have passed very agree∣able
hours, is the only place which still unites the flower of the
English youth. The stile of living, though <HI>somewhat</HI> expensive, is
exceedingly pleasant, and, notwithstanding the rage of play, I have
found more entertaining, and even rational society here, than in
any other club to which I belong. Mrs. Gibbon still hangs in sus∣pense,
and seems to consider a town-expedition with horror. I think,
however, that she will be soon in motion; and when I have her in
Bentinck-street, we shall perhaps talk of a Sheffield excursion. I am
now deeply engaged in the reign of Constantine, and, from the spe∣cimens
which I have already seen, I can venture to promise, that the
second volume will not be less interesting than the first. The fifteen
hundred copies are moving off with decent speed, and the obliging
Cadell begins to mutter something of a third edition for next year.

and you will believe that I was not the less pleased to discover,
in an historian of so much learning and penetration, so great a co∣incidence

<P>MR. Gibbon takes the earliest opportunity of presenting his com∣pliments

of the liberal treatment which he has received from so candid an
adversary. Mr. Gibbon entirely coincides in opinion with Dr. Wat∣son,
that as their different sentiments, on a very important period
of history, are now submitted to the Public, they both may employ
their time in a manner much more useful, as well as agreeable, than
they could possibly do by exhibiting a single combat in the amphi∣theatre
of controversy. Mr. Gibbon is therefore determined to resist
the temptation of justifying, in a professed reply, any passages of
his History, which might perhaps be easily cleared from censure
and misapprehension; but he still reserves to himself the privilege
of inserting in a future edition some occasional remarks and expla∣nations
of his meaning. If any calls of pleasure or business should
bring Dr. Watson to town, Mr. Gibbon would think himself happy
in being permitted to solicit the honour of his acquaintance.</P>

some faint idea of Mr. Gibbon's difficulty in resisting the temptation
he speaks of, from having been of late in a situation somewhat
similar himself. It would be very extraordinary, if Mr. Gibbon did
not feel a parent's partiality for an offspring which has justly excited
the admiration of all who have seen it; and Dr. Watson would be

Things go on very prosperously in America. Howe is himself in

and Washington, who wishes to cover Philadelphia, has not
more than six or seven thousand men with him. Clinton designs to
conquer Rhode Island in his way home. But, what <HI>I</HI> think of much
greater confequence, a province made its submission, and desired to
be reinstated in the peace of the King. It is indeed only poor little
Georgia; and the application was made to Governor Tonyn of Flo∣rida.
Some disgust at a violent step of the Congress, who removed
the President of their Provincial Assembly, a leading and popular
man, co-operated with the fear of the Indians, who began to amuse
themselves with the exercise of scalping on their Back Settlements.
Town fills, and we are mighty agreeable. Last year, on the Queen's

<P>YOUR dispatch is gone to * * *, and I flatter myself that by

Lenborough before I return from Paris. The day of my departure
is not absolutely fixed; Sunday seven-night, the twenty-seventh in∣stant,
is talked of: But if any India business should come on after
the Civil List, it will occasion some delay, otherwise things are in
great forwardness. Mrs. Gibbon is an enemy to the whole plan;
and I must answer, in a long letter, two very ingenious objections
which she has started. 1st, That I shall be consined, or put to
death by the priests; and, 2dly, That I shall fully my <HI>moral</HI> cha∣racter,

Newton, about a power of attorney for you. By the bye, I wish you
would remember a sort of promise, and give me one day before I go.
We talk chiefly of the Marquis de la Fayette, who was here a few
weeks ago. He is about twenty, with an hundred and thirty
thousand livres a year; the nephew of Noailles, who is ambassador
here. He has bought the Duke of Kingston's yatch, and is gone

direct you and my Lady to appear in town to-morrow seven-night.

of changing on my arrival; and, though I immediately secured a
vessel, it has been impossible to make the least use of it during the
whole of this tedious day. It seems doubtful, whether I shall get out
to-morrow morning; and the Captian assures me, that the passage
will have the double advantage of being both cold and rough. Last
night a small privateer, fitted out at Dunkirk, with a commission
from Dr. Franklin, attacked, took, and has carried into Dunkirk Road,
the Harwich Packet. The King's messenger had just time to throw
his dispatches over-board. He passed through this town about four
o'clock this afternoon, in his return to London. As the alarm is now
given, our American friend will probably remain quiet, or will be

<P>I HAVE desired Mr. Strahan to take the liberty of sending you, in
my name, a copy of the History of America, which I hope you
will do me the honour of accepting, as a testimony, not only of my
respect, but of my gratitude, for the instruction which I have re∣ceived

from your writings, as well as the credit you have done me,
by the most obliging manner in which you have mentioned my
name. I wish the present work may not diminish sentiments so
flattering to me. I have taken much pains to obtain the approbation
of those whose good opinion one ought to be solicitous to secure,
and I trust that my industry at least will be applauded.</P>
<P>An unlucky indisposition prevented me from executing a scheme
which I had formed, of passing two months of last spring in London.
The honour of being made known to you, was one of the pleasures
with which I had flattered myself. But I hope to be more fortunate
next year; and beg that you will believe that I am, with great re∣spect,
Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.</P>

<P>WHEN I ventured to assume the character of Historian, the first,
the most natural, but at the same time the most ambitious,
wish which I entertained, was to obtain the approbation of Dr. Ro∣bertson
and of Mr. Hume; two names which friendship united, and
which posterity will never separate. I shall not therefore attempt to
dissemble, though I cannot easily express, the pleasure which I re∣ceived
from your obliging letter, as well as from the intelligence of
your most valuable present. The satifaction which I should other∣wise
have enjoyed, in common with the public, will now be height∣ened
by a sentiment of a more personal and flattering nature; and
I shall frequently whisper to myself, that I have in some measure:
deserved the esteem of the writer whom I admire.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="541"/>
A short excursion which I have made to this place, during the
summer months, has occasioned some delay in my receiving your
letter, and will prevent my possessing, till my return, the copy of
your History, which you so politely desired Mr. Strahan to send me.
But I have already gratified the eagerness of my impatience; and
although I was obliged to return the book much sooner than I could
have wished, I have seen enough to convince me, that the present
publication will support, and, if possible, will extend the fame of
the Author; that the materials are collected with diligence, and ar∣ranged
with skill; that the first book contains a learned and satisfac∣tory
account of the progress of discovery; that the achievements,
the dangers, and the crimes, of the Spanish adventures are related
with a temperate spirit; and that the most original, perhaps the
most curious, portion of the history of human manners is at length
rescued from the hands of sophists and declaimers. Lord Stormont,
and the few in this Capital, who have had an opportunity of per∣using
the History of America, unanimously concur in the same
sentiments. Your work is already become a favourite topic of public
conversation; and Mr. Suard is repeatedly pressed, in my hearing,
to fix the time when his translation will appear.</P>
<P>I flatter myself you will not abandon your design of visiting Lon∣don
next winter; as I already anticipate, in my own mind, the ad∣vantages
which I shall derive from so pleasing and so honourable a
connection. In the mean while, I should esteem myself happy, if
you could think of any literary commission, in the execution of
which I might be useful to you at Paris, where I propose to stay till
very near the meeting of Parliament. Let me, for instance, suggest
an enquiry, which cannot be indifferent to you, and which might
perhaps be within my reach. A few days ago I dined with Bagni∣ousky,
the famous adventurer, who escaped from his exile at Kam∣schatska,
and returned into Europe by Japan and China. His nar∣rative
<PB N="521" REF="542"/>
was amusing, though I know not how far his veracity, in point
of circumstances, may safely be trusted. It was his original design
to penetrate through the North East Passage; and he actually fol∣lowed
the coast of Asia as high as the latitude of 67° 35′, till his
progress was stopped by the ice, in a Streight between the two
Continents, which was only seven leagues broad. Thence he de∣scended
along the coast of America, as low as Cape Mendocin; but
was repulsed by contrary winds, in his attempts to reach the port of
Acapulco. The Journal of his Voyage, with his original Charts, is
now at Versailles, in the <HI>Depót des Affaires Etrangers;</HI> and if you
conceived that it would be of any use to you for a second edition, I
would try what might be obtained; though I am not ignorant of
that mean jealousy which you yourself have experienced, and so
deservedly stigmatised. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of your obliging Letter, and I should be a very
proud man indeed, if I were not vain of the approbation which
you are pleased to bestow upon me. As you will now have had an
opportunity to peruse the book, which you had only seen when you
wrote to me, I indulge myself in the hopes, that the favourable opi∣nion
you had formed of it, is not diminished. I am much pleased
with your mentioning my friendship with Mr. Hume; I have al∣ways
considered that as one of the most fortunate and honourable
circumstances of my life. It is a felicity of the age and country in
which we live, that men of letters can enter the same walk of science,
and go on successfully, without feeling one sentiment of envy or
<PB N="522" REF="543"/>
rivalship. In the intercourse between Mr. Hume and me, we always
found <HI>something to blame,</HI> as well as <HI>something to commend.</HI> I have
received frequently very valuable criticisms on my performances
from him; and I have sometimes ventured to offer him my strictures
on his works. Permit me to hope for the same indulgence from
you. If, in reading the History of America, any thing, either in
the matter or style, has occurred to you as reprehensible, I will deem
it a most obliging favour if you will communicate it freely to me.
I am certain of profiting by such a communication.</P>
<P>I return you thanks for your frank offer of executing any literary
commission for me. I accept of it without ceremony, and am flat∣tered
with the idea of receiving such aid from your hands. I know
nothing of Bagniouski's Adventures, but what was published in some
Newspaper. If one can rely on his veracity, what he relates must
be very interesting to me. If you had been writing the History of
America, the question concerning the mode of peopling it, might
not perhaps have occupied your attention very much. But it was
proper for me to consider it more fully. Bagniouski (if he may be
credited) has seen what it may be useful for me to know. I can see
no reason why the Court of France should be shy about communi∣cating
his Journal, and the Charts which illustrate it; possibly my
name may operate somewhat towards obtaining a copy of both;
your interposition, I am confident, will do a great deal. It will be
very illiberal indeed, if such a communication were refused. My Lord
Stormont (by whose attention I have been much honoured) would
not decline to give his aid, were that necessary. But if your Court
resembles that of Spain, I am afraid every proposal from an am∣bassador
is received with some degree of jealousy. Your own private
application will, I apprehend, be more effectual. As it is pro∣bable
that a second edition may go to press early in the winter, it
will add to the favour, if you can soon inform me concerning the
success of your negociation. As this is something in the style of
<PB N="523" REF="544"/>
the <HI>Corps Diplomatique,</HI> allow me to recommend one of its members
to you. Mr. Fullarton, the new secretary of the embassy, is a par∣ticular
friend of mine. He is a young man of such qualities both of
head and heart, that I am sure you will esteem and love him. Please
remember me to him. I have the honour to be, with great respect,</P>

<P>I TOLD you what would infallibly happen, and you know enough
of the nature of the beast not to be surprised at it. I have now
been at Paris exactly five weeks; during which time I have not
written to any person whatsoever within the British dominions, ex∣cept
two lines of notification to Mrs. Gibbon. The daemon of pro∣crastination
has at length yielded to the genius of friendship, assisted
indeed by the powers of fear and shame. But when I have seated
myself before a table, and begin to revolve all that I have seen
and tasted during this busy period, I feel myself oppressed and
confounded; and I am very near throwing away the pen, and re∣signing
myself to indolent despair. A complete history would re∣quire
a volume, at least, as corpulent as the Decline and Fall; and if
I attempt to select and abridge, besides the difficulty of the choice,
there occur so many things which cannot properly be entrusted to
paper, and so many others of too slight a texture to support the
journey, that I am almost tempted to reserve for our future conver∣sations
the detail of my pleasures and occupations. But as I am sen∣sible
that you are <HI>rigid</HI> and impatient, I will try to convey, in a few
words, a general idea of my situation as a man of the world, and as
<PB N="524" REF="545"/>
a man of letters. You remember that the Neckers were my princi∣pal
dependance; and the reception which I have met with from them
very far surpassed my most sanguine expectations. I do not indeed
lodge in their house, (as it might incite the jealousy of the husband,
and procure me a lettre de cachet,) but I live very much with them,
and dine and sup whenever they have company, which is almost
every day, and whenever I like it, for they are not in the least <HI>exi∣geans.</HI>
Mr. Walpole gave me an introduction to Madame du Def∣fand,
an agreeable young lady of eighty-two years of age, who has
constant suppers, and the best company in Paris. When you see the
Duke of Richmond, he will give you an account of that house, where
I meet him almost every evening. Ask him about Madame de Cam∣bis.
I have met the Duke of Choiseul at his particular request,
dined by <HI>accident</HI> with Franklin, conversed with the Emperor, been
presented at court, and gradually, or rather rapidly, I find my
acquaintance spreading over the most valuable parts of Paris. They
pretend to like me, and whatever you may think of French profes∣sions,
I am convinced that some at least are sincere. On the other
hand, I feel myself easy and happy in their company, and only regret
that I did not come over two or three months sooner. Though Paris
throughout the summer promises me a very agreeable society, yet I
am hurt every day by the departure of men and women whom I begin
to know with some familiarity, the departure of officers for their go∣vernments
and garrisons, of bishops for their dioceses, and even of
country gentlemen for their estates, as a rural taste gains ground in
this country. So much for the general idea of my acquaintance;
details would be endless, yet unsatisfactory. You may add, to the
pleasures of society those of the spectacles and promenades, and you
will find that I lead a very agreeable life; let me just condescend to
observe, that it is not extravagant. After decking myself out with
silks and silver, the ordinary establishment of coach, lodging, servants,
eating, and pocket expences, does not exceed sixty pounds <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="525" REF="546"/>
month. Yet I have two footmen in handsome liveries behind my
coach, and my apartment is hung with damask. Adieu for the pre∣sent:
I have more to say, but were I to attempt any farther progress,
you must wait another post; and you have already waited long
enough, of all conscience.</P>
<P>Let me just in two words give you an idea of my day. I am now
going (nine o'clock) to the King's library, where I shall stay till twelve;
as soon as I am dressed, I set out to dine with the Duke de Nivernois;
shall go from thence to the French comedy, into the Princess de
Beauveau's loge grillée, and cannot quite determine whether I shall
sup at Madame du Deffand's, Madame Necker's, or the Sardinian
Ambassadress's. Once more adieu.</P>
<P>I embrace my Lady and <HI>Bambini.</HI> I shall with cheerfulness exe∣cute
any of her commissions.</P>

<P>WELL, and who is the culprit now?—Thus far had I written in
the pride of my heart, and fully determined to inflict an epistle
upon you, even before I received any answer to my former; I was
very near a bull. But this forward half line lay ten days barren and
inactive, till its generative powers were excited by the missive which
I received yesterday. What a wretched piece of work do we seem to
be making of it in America? The greatest force which any European
power ever ventured to transport into that continent, is not strong
enough even to attack the enemy; the naval strength of Great Britain
is not sufficient to prevent the Americans (they have almost lost the
appellation of Rebels) from receiving every assistance that they
<PB N="526" REF="547"/>
wanted; and in the mean time you are obliged to call out the militia
to defend your own coasts against their privateers. You possibly may
expect from me some account of the designs and policy of the French
court, but I choose to decline that task for two reasons: 1st, Because
you may find them laid open in every newspaper; and 2dly, Because
I live too much with their courtiers and ministers to know any thing
about them. I shall only say, that I am not under any immediate
apprehensions of a war with France. It is much more pleasant as
well as profitable to view in safety the raging of the tempest, occa∣sionally
to pick up some pieces of the wreck, and to improve their
trade, their agriculture, and their finances, while the two countries
are <HI>lento collisa duello.</HI> Far from taking any step to put a speedy end
to this astonishing dispute, I should not be surprised if next summer
they were to lend their cordial assistance to England, as to the weaker
party. As to my personal engagement with the D. of R. I recollect
a few slight skirmishes, but nothing that deserves the name of a ge∣neral
engagement. The extravagance of some disputants, both
French and English, who have espoused the cause of America, some∣times
inspires me with an extraordinary vigour. Upon the whole, I
find it much easier to defend the justice than the policy of our mea∣sures;
but there are certain cases, where whatever is repugnant to
sound policy ceases to be just.</P>
<P>The more I see of Paris, the more I like it. The regular course
of the society in which I live is easy, polite, and entertaining;
and almost every day is marked by the acquisition of some new
acquaintance, who is worth cultivating, or who, at least, is worth re∣membering.
To the great admiration of the French, I regularly
dine and regularly sup, drink a dish of strong coffee after each meal,
and find my stomach a citizen of the world. The spectacles, (parti∣cularly
the Italian, and above all the French Comedies,) which are
open the whole summer, afford me an agreeable relaxation from com∣pany;
and to shew you that I frequent them from taste, and not from
<PB N="527" REF="548"/>
idleness, I have not yet seen the Colisee, the Vauxhall, the Boul∣vards,
or any of those places of entertainment which constitute Paris
to most of our countrymen. Occasional trips to dine or sup in some
of the thousand country-houses which are scattered round the envi∣rons
of Paris, serve to vary the scene. In the mean while the sum∣mer
insensibly glides away, and the fatal month of October approaches,
when I must change the house of Madame Necker for the House of
Commons. I regret that I could not choose the winter, instead of the
summer, for this excursion: I should have found many valuable per∣sons,
and should have preserved others whom I have lost as I began
to know them. The Duke de Choiseul, who deserves attention both
for himself, and for keeping the best house in Paris, passes seven
months of the year in Touraine; and though I have been tempted, I
consider with horror a journey of sixty leagues into the country.
The Princess of Beauveau, who is a most superior woman, has been
absent above six weeks, and does not return till the 24th of this
month. A large body of recruits will be assembled by the Fontain∣bleau
journey; but in order to have a thorough knowledge of this
splendid country, I ought to stay till the month of January; and if
I could be sure that Opposition would be as tranquil as they were last
year—I think your life has been as animated, or, at least, as tumul∣tuous,
and I envy you Lady Payne, &amp;c. much more than either the
Primate, or the Chief-justice. Let not the generous breast of my Lady
be torn by the black serpents of envy. She still possesses the first place
in the sentiments of her slave: but the adventure of the fan was a
mere accident, owing to Lord Carmarthen. Adieu. I think you

from the knowledge of some hidden resources, which will enable
us to open the next campaign with new armies of fifty or sixty thou∣sand
men. But I believe you will find yourself obliged to carry on

<P>DREADFUL news indeed! You will see them partly in the papers,
and we have not yet any particulars. An English army of nearly
ten thousand men laid down their arms, and surrendered prisoners of
war, on condition of being sent to England, and of never serving
against America. They had fought bravely, and were three days
without eating. Bourgoyne is said to have received three wounds.
General Fraser, with two thousand men, killed. Colonel Ackland
likewise killed. A general cry for peace. Adieu. We have con∣stant

<P>YOU do not readily believe in praeternatural miscarriages of letters;
nor I neither. Listen, however, to a plain and honest narra∣tive.
This morning after breakfast, as I was ruminating on <HI>your</HI>
silence, Thomas, my new footman, with confusion in his looks and
stammering on his tongue, produced a letter reasonably soiled, which
he was to have brought me the day of his arrival, and which had
lain forgotten from that time in his pocket. To shorten as much
as possible the continuance, I immediately enquired, whether any
method of conveyance could be devised more expeditious than the
post, and was fortunately informed of your coachman's intentions.
You probably know the heads of the plan; an Act of Parliament to
declare, that we never <HI>had</HI> any intention of taxing America: another
Act, to empower the Crown to name Commissioners, authorised to
suspend hostilities by sea and land, as well as all obnoxious Acts;
and, in short, to grant every thing, except independence. Oppo∣sition,
after expressing their doubts whether the lance of Achilles
could cure the wound which it had inflicted, could not refuse their
assent to the principles of conduct which they themselves had always
recommended. Yet you must acknowledge, that in a business of
this magnitude there may arise several important questions, which,
without a spirit of faction, will deserve to be debated: whether Par∣liament
ought not to name the Commissioners? whether it would
not be better to repeal the obnoxious Acts ourselves? I do not find
that the world; that is, a few people whom I happen to converse
with; are much inclined to praise Lord N.'s ductility of temper.
In the service of next Friday you will, however, take notice of the
injunction given by the Liturgy: <Q>And all the People shall say
<PB N="532" REF="553"/>
after the <HI>Minister,</HI> Turn us again, O Lord, and so shall we be
turned.</Q> While we consider whether we shall negociate, I fear
the French have been more diligent. It is positively asserted, both
in private and in Parliament, and not contradicted by the Ministers,
that on the fifth of this month a Treaty of Commerce (which na∣turally
leads to a war) was signed at Paris with the independent
States of America. Yet there still remains a hope that England may
obtain the preference. The two greatest countries in Europe are
fairly running a race for the favour of America.</P>

<P>As business thickens, and you may expect me to write sometimes,
I shall lay down one rule; totally to avoid political argument,
conjecture, lamentation, declamation, &amp;c. which would fill pages,
not to say volumes; and to confine myself to short, authentic pieces
of intelligence, for which I may be able to afford moments and lines.
Hear then—The French Ambassador went off yesterday morning,
not without some slight expressions of ill-humour from John Bull.
Lord Stormont is probably arrived to-day. No <HI>immediate</HI> declaration,
except on our side. A report (but vague) of an action in the Bay,
between La Motte Piquet and Digby; the former has five ships
and three frigates, with three large store-ships under convoy; the
latter has eleven ships of the line. If the Frenchman should sail to
the mouth of the Delawar, he may possibly be followed and shut
up. When Franklin was received at Versailles, Deane went in the
same character to Vienna, and Arthur Lee to Madrid. Notwith∣standing
the reports of an action in Silesia, they subside; and I have
seen a letter from Eliot at Berlin of the tenth instant, without any
<PB N="533" REF="554"/>
mention of actual hostilities, and even speaking of the impending
war as not absolutely inevitable. Last Tuesday the first payment
of the loan of six hundred thousand pounds was certainly made;
and as it would otherwise be forfeited, it is a security for the re∣mainder.
I have not yet got the intelligence you want about former
prices of stock in critical times. There are surely such. <HI>Dixi.
Vale.</HI> Send me some good news from Bucks; in spite of the war, I
must sell. We want you in town. Simon Fraser is impatient: but
if you come without my Lady, every door will be shut.</P>

<P>***'s Letter gave me that sort of satisfaction which one
may receive from a good physician, who, after a careful examina∣tion,
pronounces your case incurable. But no more of that. I
take up the pen, as I suppose by this time you begin to swear at my
silence. Yet literally (a bull) I have not a word to say. Since
D'Estaing's fleet has passed through the Gut (I leave you to guess
where it must have got out) it has been totally forgotten, and the
most wonderful lethargy and oblivion, of war and peace, of Europe
and of America, seems to prevail. Lord Chatham's funeral was meanly
attended, and Government ingeniously contrived to secure the double
odium of suffering the thing to be done, and of doing it with an ill
grace. Their chief conversation at Almack's is about tents, drill∣serjeants,
subdivisions, firings, &amp;c. and I am revered as a veteran.

necessity obliges me to think of Beriton, and I feel something of a

against him. He is ordered out again with three or four large
ships; two of ninety, two of seventy-four, and the fiftieth regiment,
as marines. In the mean time the French, with a superior fleet,
are masters of the sea; and our outward-bound East and West

<P>I DELAYED writing, not so much through indolence, as because I
expected every post to hear from you. The state of Beriton is
uncertain, incomprehensible, tremendous. It would be endless to
send you the folios of Hugonin, but I have inclosed you one of his
most picturesque epistles, on which you may meditate. Few offers;
one, promising enough, came from a gentleman at Camberwell. I
detected him, with masterly skill and diligence, to be only an attorney's
Clerk, without money, credit, or experience. I have written as yet
in vain to Sir John Shelley, about Hearsay; perhaps you might get
intelligence. I much fear that the Beriton expedition is necessary;
but it has occurred to me, that if I <HI>met,</HI> instead of <HI>accompanying</HI> you,
it would save me a journey of above one hundred miles. That re∣flection
led to another of a very impudent nature; <HI>viz.</HI> that if I
did not accompany you, I certainly could be of no use to you or
myself on the spot; that I had much rather, while you examined
the premises, pass the time in a horse-pond; and that I had still rather
pass it in my library with the Decline and Fall. But that would be
an effort of friendship worthy of Theseus or Perithous: modern
<PB N="537" REF="558"/>
times would hardly credit, much less imitate, such exalted virtue.
No news from America; yet there are people, large ones too, who
talk of conquering it next summer with the help of twenty thousand
Russians. I fancy you are better satisfied with private than public
war. The Lisbon packet in coming home met above forty of our
privateers. Adieu. I hardly know whether I direct right to you,

<P>YOU are quiet and peaceable, and do not bark, as usual, at my

<P>I SHOULD have long since returned you thanks for the pamphlet
you took the trouble of sending to me. I hope you are not one
of those who estimate kindness by punctuality in correspondence. I
read your little performance with much eagerness, and some solici∣tude.
The latter soon ceased. The tone you take with your adver∣sary
in this <HI>impar congressus</HI> appears to me perfectly proper; and,
though I watched you with some attention, I have not observed any
expression which I should, on your own account, wish to be altered.
Davis's book never reached us here. Our distance from the Capital
operates somewhat like time. Nothing but what has intrinsic value
comes down to us. We hear sometimes of the worthless and vile
things that float for a day on the stream, but we seldom see them.
I am satisfied, however, that it was necessary for you to animadvert
on a man who had brought accusations against you, which no
gentleman can allow to be made without notice. I am persuaded,
that the persons who instigated the man to such an illiberal attack,
will now be ashamed of him. At the same time I applaud your re∣solution,
of not degrading yourself, by a second conflict, with such
antagonists.</P>

of private friendship than of public spirit, that I am very

the town and neighbourhood, which I still maintain to be the best
society and the best retirement; the latter, however, has been sometimes

unrelenting tyrant, called the gout; and though my feet were the
part on which he chose to exercise his cruelty, he left me neither
strength nor spirits to use my hand in relating the melancholy tale.
At present, I have the pleasure of informing you, that the fever and
inflammation have subsided: but the absolute weakness and monstrous
swelling of my two feet confine me to my chair and flannels; and
this confinement most unluckily happens at a very <HI>nice</HI> and important
moment of parliamentary affairs. Col. H. pursues those affairs with
eager and persevering zeal; and has the pleasure of undertaking more
business than any three men could possibly execute. He is much

but I am quite ignorant. (not more so than they are themselves) of
their intentions. I will write again very soon. I am, dear Madam,

<P>AS a Member of Parliament, I cannot be exposed to any danger,
since the House of Commons has adjourned to Monday
se'nnight; as an individual, I do not conceive myself to be ob∣noxious.
I am not apt, without duty or necessity, to thrust myself
into a mob: and our part of the town is as quiet as a country village.
So much for personal safety; but I cannot give the same assurances
of public tranquillity: forty thousand Puritans, such as they might
be in the time of Cromwell, have started out of their graves; the
tumult has been dreadful; and even the remedy of military force
and martial law is unpleasant. But Government, with fifteen thousand
regulars in town, and every gentleman (but one) on their side, must
extinguish the flame. The execution of last night was severe; per∣haps
it must be repeated to-night: yet, upon the whole, the tumult
subsides. Colonel Holroyd was all last night in Holborn among the
flames, with the Northumberland Militia, and performed very bold
and able service. I will write again in a post or two.</P>

<P>I BELIEVE we may now rejoice in our common security. All

The measures of Government have been seasonable and

military power was applied and regulated with the utmost propriety.
Our danger is at an end, but our disgrace will be lasting, and the
month of June 1780, will ever be marked by a dark and diabolical
fanaticism, which I had supposed to be extinct, but which actually
subsists in Great Britain, perhaps beyond any other country in Eu∣rope.
Our parliamentary work draws to a conclusion; and I am

<P>I AM ashamed of having deferred so long to thank you for the
agreeable presents of your two new volumes; but just as I had
finished the first reading of them, I was taken ill, and continued, for
two or three weeks, nervous, deaf, and languid. I have now re∣covered
<PB N="551" REF="572"/>
covered as much spirit as to tell you, with what perfect satisfaction I
have not only perused, but studied, this part of your work. I knew
enough of your talents and industry to expect a great deal, but you
have gone far beyond my expectations. I can recollect no historical
work from which I ever received so much instruction; and, when I
consider in what a barren field you had to glean and pick up ma∣terials,
I am truly astonished at the connected and interesting story
you have formed. I like the style of these volumes better than that
of the first; there is the same beauty, richness, and perspicuity of
language, with less of that quaintness, into which your admiration of
Tacitus sometimes seduced you. I am highly pleased with the reign of
Julian. I was a little afraid that <HI>you</HI> might lean with some partiality to∣wards
him; but even bigots, I should think, must allow, that you have
delineated his most singular character with a more masterly hand than
ever touched it before. You set me a reading his works, with which
I was very slenderly acquainted; and I am much struck with the
felicity wherewith you have described that odd infusion of Heathen
fanaticism and philosophical coxcombry, which mingled with the
great qualities of a hero, and a genius. Your chapter concerning
the pastoral nations is admirable; and, though I hold myself to
be a tolerably good general historian, a great part of it was new to
me. As soon as I have leisure, I purpose to trace you to your sources
of information; and I have no doubt of finding you as exact there,
as I have found you in other passages where I have made a scrutiny.
It was always my idea that an historian should feel himself a witness
giving evidence upon oath. I am glad to perceive by your minute
scrupulosity, that your notions are the same. The last chapter in
your work is the only one with which I am not entirely satisfied.
I imagine you rather anticipate, in describing the jurisprudence and
institutions of the Franks; and should think that the account of
private war, ordeals, chivalry, &amp;c. would have come in more in its
place about the age of Charlemagne, or later: but with respect
<PB N="552" REF="573"/>
to this, and some other petty criticisms, I will have an opportunity
of talking fully to you soon, as I propose setting our for London on
Monday. I have, indeed, many things to say to you; and, as my
stay in London is to be very short, I shall hope to find your door
(at which I will be very often) always open to me. I cannot con∣clude
without approving of the caution with which the new volumes
are written; I hope it will exempt you from the illiberal abuse the
first volume drew upon you. I ever am, yours, faithfully and
affectionately,</P>

<P>I HAVE more than once sought, without having been so fortunate
as to obtain, a proper opportunity of thanking you very sincerely
for the elegant compliment which you pay me, in a work abounding
in elegance of all kinds.</P>
<P>My <HI>Seven Arabian Poets</HI> will see the light before next winter,
and be proud to wait upon you in their English dress. Their wild
productions will, I flatter myself, be thought interesting, and not
venerable merely on account of their antiquity.</P>
<P>In the mean while, let me request you to honour me with accept∣ing
a copy of a Law Tract, which is not yet published: the subject
is so generally important, that I make no apology for sending you
a professional work.</P>
<P>You must pardon my inveterate hatred of C. Octavianus, basely
surnamed Augustus. I feel myself unable to forgive the death of
Cicero, which, if he did not promote, he might have prevented.
Besides, even Mecaenas knew the cruelty of his disposition, and
ventured to reproach him with it. In short, I have not <HI>Christian</HI>
charity for him.</P>
<P>With regard to Asiatic letters, a necessary attention to my profession
will compel me wholly and eternally to abandon them, <HI>unless</HI> Lord
North (to whom I am already under no small obligation) should think
me worthy to concur in the <HI>improved</HI> administration of justice in
Bengal, and should appoint me to supply the vacancy on the India
Bench. Were that appointment to take place this year, I should
<PB N="554" REF="575"/>
probably travel, for speed, through part of Egypt and Arabia, and
should be able, in my way, to procure many Eastern tracts of lite∣rature
and jurisprudence. I might become a good <HI>Mahomedan</HI>
lawyer before I reached Calcutta, and, in my vacations, should find
leisure to explain, in my native language, whatever the Arabs,
Persians, and Turks, have written on science, history, and the sine
arts.</P>
<P>My happiness by no means depends on obtaining this appoint∣ment,
as I am in easy circumstances without my profession, and
have flattering prospects in it; but if the present summer and the
ensuing antumn elapse without my receiving any answer, favourable
or unfavourable, I shall be forced to consider that silence as a polite
refusal, and, having given sincere thanks for past favours, shall en∣tirely
drop all thoughts of <HI>Asia,</HI> and <Q>deep as ever plummet
sounded, shall drown my <HI>Persian</HI> books.</Q> If my politics have
given offence, it would be manly in Ministers to tell me so. I shall
never be <HI>personally</HI> hostile to them, nor enlist under partly banners
of any colour; but I will never resign my opinions for <HI>interest,</HI> though
I would cheerfully abandon them on <HI>conviction.</HI> My reason, such
as it is, can only be controlled by better reason, to which I am ever
open. As to my freedom of thought, speech, and action, I shall
ever say what Charles XII. wrote under the map of Riga, <Q><HI>Dieu me
l'a donnee; le diable ne me l' otera pas.</HI></Q> But the fair answer to this
objection is, that my system is purely speculative, and has no relation
to my seat on the bench in India, where I should hardly think of
instructing the Gentoos in the maxims of the Athenians. I believe
I should not have troubled you with this letter, if I did not fear
that your attendance in Parliament might deprive me of the pleasure
of meeting you at the Club next Tuesday; and I shall go to Oxford
a few days after. At all times, and in all places, I shall ever be,

Mr. Smith, in which I stated to him every particular you men∣tioned

you know, are both prompt and vigorous; and he would not allow
that you ought to hesitate a moment in your choice. He promised
to write his sentiments to you very fully. But as he may have ne∣glected
to do this, for it is not willingly that he puts pen to paper,
I thought it might be agreeable to you to know his opinion, though I
imagine you could hardly entertain any doubt concerning it. I hope
you have brought such a stock of health and spirits from Bright∣helmstone,
that you are set seriously at your desk, and that in two
winters or so, you will display the crescent of Mahomet on the
dome of St. Sophia. I met t'other day, in a work addressed to
yourself, a sensible passage from F. Paul, which perfectly removes
one of your chief difficulties, as to the barrenness of some parts of
your period. Hayley's Essay on History, p. 133. By the bye,

<P>I RETURNED to this place with Lord and Lady Sheffield, with the
design of passing two or three weeks in a situation which had
so highly delighted me. But how vain are all sublunary hopes! I
had forgot that there is some difference between the sunshine of
August and the cold fogs (though we have uncommon good weather)
of November. Instead of my beautiful sea-shore, I am confined to
a dark lodging in the middle of the town; for the place is still full,
and our time is now spent in the dull imitation of a London life.
To complete my misfortunes, Lord Sheffield was hastily ordered to
Canterbury and Deal, to suppress some disturbances, and I was left
almost alone with my Lady, in the servile state of a married man.
But he returns to-day, and I hope to be seated in my own library
by the middle of next week. However, you will not be sorry to
hear that I have refreshed myself by a very <HI>idle</HI> summer, and indeed
a much idler and more pleasant winter than the House of Commons
will ever allow me to enjoy again. I had almost forgot Mr. Hayley;
ungratefully enough, since I really passed a very simple, but enter∣taining
day with him. His place, though small, is elegant as his
mind, which I value much more highly. Mrs. ** wrote a
melancholy story of an American mother, a friend of her friend,
who in a short time had lost three sons; one killed by the savages,
one run mad from the fright at that accident, and the third taken at

sea, now in England, a prisoner in Forton hospital. For <HI>him</HI> some∣thing
might perhaps be done. Your humanity will prompt you to

he might be a minister: his successor is not yet named, and divi∣sions

with him before Christmas. At all events, I foresee much tumult
and strong opposition, from which I should be very glad to extricate
myself, by quitting the House of Commons with honour. What∣ever

Parliament, which would indeed be a rash and dangerous

subject, and since Pope's death, I am satisfied that England has not

seen so happy a mixture of strong sense and flowing numbers. Are
you not delighted with his address to his mother? I understand

under the veil of Hampton Court I may lurk ten days or a fortnight
at Sheffield, if the enraged Lady does not shut the doors against me.

<P>ON the approach of winter, my paper house at Hampton be∣comes
less comfortable; my visits to Bentinck-street grow longer
and more frequent, and the end of next week will restore me to
the town, with a lively wish, however, to repeat the same, or a
similar experiment, next summer. I admire the assurance with
which you propose a month's residence at Sheffield, when you
are not sure of being allowed three days. Here it is currently re∣ported,
that camps will not separate till Lord Howe's <HI>return</HI> from
Gibraltar, and as yet we have no news of his arrival. Perhaps in∣deed
you may have more intimate correspondence with your old
friend Lord Shelburne, and already know the hour of your deliver∣ance.
I should like to be informed. As Lady S. has entirely for∣gotten
me, I shall have the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.
I have often thought of writing, but it is now too late to repent.</P>
<P>I am at a loss what to say or think about our parliamentary state.
A certain late Secretary of Ireland reckons the House of Commons
thus: Minister one hundred and forty, Reynard ninety, Boreas one
hundred and twenty, the rest unknown, or uncertain. The last of
the three, by self or agents, talks too much of absence, neutrality,
moderation. I still think he will discard the game.</P>

I am not in such a fury with the letter of American independence;
but I think it seems ill-timed and useless; and I am much enter∣tained
with the metaphysical disputes between Government and Se∣cessin
about the meaning of it. Lord Loughborough will be in
town Sunday seven-night. I long to see him and Co. I think he
will take a very decided part. If he could throw aside his gown,
he would make a noble leader. The East India news are excellent.

<P>I HAVE designed writing every post. The air of London is ad∣mirable;
my complaints have vanished, and the gout still respects

very well satisfied with his Irish expedition, and found the barbarous
people very kind to him. The castle is strong, but the volunteers
are formidable. London is dead, and all intelligence so totally ex∣tinct,
that the loss of an army would be a favourable incident. We
have not even the advantage of shipwrecks, which must soon, with

<P>AS I arrived about seven o'clock on Wednesday last, we were
some time in town in mutual ignorance. Unluckly enough;
yet our loss will be speedily repaired. Your reason for not writing
is worthy of an Irish Baron: you thought Sarah might be at Bath,
because you directed letters to her at Clifton near Bristol; where
indeed I saw her in a delightful situation, swept by the winter winds,
and scorched by the summer sun. A nobler reason for your silence
would be the care of the public papers, to record your steps, words,
and actions. I was pleased with your Coventry oration: a pane∣gyric
on ** is a subject entirely new, and which no orator
before yourself would have dared to undertake. You have acted
with prudence and dignity in casting away the military yoke. This
next summer you will, sit down (if you can sit) in the long lost cha∣racter

<P>For my own part, my late journey has only confirmed me in the
opinion, that Number Seven in Bentinck-street is the best house in
the world. I find that peace and war alternately, and daily, take
their turns of conversation, and this (Friday) is the pacific day.

<P>AS a mark of your esteem, I should have accepted with pleasure
your History of the Corruptions of Christianity. You have been
careful to inform me, that it is intended, not as a gift, but as a
challenge, and such a challenge you must permit me to decline. At
the same time you glory in outstripping the zeal of the Mufti and
the Lama, it may be proper to declare, that I should equally refuse
the defiance of those venerable divines. Once, and once only, the
just defence of my own veracity provoked me to descend into the
amphitheatre; but as long as you attack opinions which I have never
maintained, or maintain principles which I have never denied, you
may safely exult in my silence and your own victory. The
difference between us, (on the credibility of miracles,) which you
chuse to suppose, and wish to argue, is a trite and antient topic
of controversy, and, from the opinion which you entertain of your∣self
and of me, it does not appear probable that our dispute would
either edify or enlighten the Public.</P>
<P>That Public will decide to whom the <HI>invidious</HI> name of Unbe∣liever
more justly belongs; to the Historian, who, without interposing
his own sentiments, has delivered a simple narrative of authentic
facts, or to the disputant who proudly rejects all natural proofs
of the immortality of the soul, overthrows (by circumscribing)
<PB N="565" REF="586"/>
the inspiration of the evangelists and apostles, and condemns the
religion of every Christian nation, as a fable less innocent, but not
less absurd, than Mahomet's journey to the third Heaven.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, since you assume a right to determine the objects
of my past and future studies, give me leave to convey to your ear
the almost unanimous, and not offensive wish, of the philosophic
world:—that you would confine your talents and industry to those
sciences in which real and useful improvements <HI>can</HI> be made. Re∣member
the end of your predecessor Servetus, not of his life, (the
Calvins of our days are restrained from the use of the same fiery
arguments,) but, I mean, the end of his reputation. His theological
writings are lost in oblivion; and if his book on the Trinity be still
preserved, it is only because it contains the first rudiments of the
discovery of the circulation of the blood.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, <DATE>3<SUP>d</SUP> February 1783.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would have been impertinent in me, especially considering the
object of my <HI>History,</HI> to have sent you a copy of it as a mark of
my <HI>esteem</HI> or <HI>friendship.</HI> What I meant was to act the part of a fair
and open <HI>adversary,</HI> and I am truly sorry that you decline the dis∣cussion
I proposed: for though you are of a different opinion, I do
not think that either of us could be better employed; and, should
the Mufti and the Lama, whose challenge, you say, you would also
decline, become parties in the business, I should rejoice the more.
I do not well know what you can mean by intimating, that I am a
greater Unbeliever than yourself; that I attack opinions which you
never maintained, and maintain principles which you never denied
<PB N="566" REF="587"/>
If you mean to assert, that you are a believer in Christianity, and
meant to recommend it, I must say, that your mode of writing has
been very ill adapted to gain your purpose. If there be any certain
method of discovering a man's real object, yours has been to dis∣credit
Christianity in fact, while in words you represent yourself as
a friend to it: a conduct which I scruple not to call highly unworthy
and mean; and insult on the common sense of the Christian world;
as a method of screening you from the notice of the law, (which is
as hostile to me as it is to you,) you must know that it could avail
you nothing; and, though that mode of writing might be deemed
ingenious and witty in the first inventor of it, it has been too often
repeated to deserve that appellation now.</P>
<P>According to your own rule of conduct, this charge ought to pro∣voke
you to descend into the amphitheatre once more, as much as
the accusation of Mr. Davis: for it is a call upon you to defend, not
your <HI>principles</HI> only, but also your <HI>honour.</HI> For what can reflect
greater dishonour on a man, than to say one thing and mean another?
You have certainly been very far from consining yourself, as you
pretend, to a simple narrative of authentic facts, without interposing
your own sentiments. I hold no opinions, obnoxious as they are,
that I am not ready both to <HI>avow</HI> in the most explicit manner, and
also to defend with any person of competent judgment and ability.
Had I not considered you in this light, and also as fairly open, by
the strain of your writings, to such a challenge, I should not have
called upon you as I have done. The Public will form its own
judgment both of that and of your silence on the occasion; and
finally decide between you, the <HI>humble historian,</HI> and me, the <HI>proud
disputant.</HI></P>
<P>As to my <HI>reputation,</HI> for which you are so very obligingly con∣cerned,
give me leave to observe, that, as far as it is an object with
any person, and a thing to be enjoyed by himself, it must depend
upon his particular notions and feelings.—Now, odd as it will appear to
<PB N="567" REF="588"/>
you, the esteem of a very few rational Christian friends (though I know
that it will ensure me the detestation of the greater part of the present
nominally Christian world that happen to hear me) given me more
real satisfaction, than the applause of what you call the philosophic
world. I admire Servetus, by whose example you wish me to take
warning, more for his courage in dying for the cause of important
truth, than I should have done if, besides the certain discovery of
the circulation of the blood, he had made any other the most cele∣brated
discovery in philosophy.</P>
<P>However, I do not see what my philosophical friends (of whom
I have many, and whom I think I value as I ought,) have to do with
my metaphysical or theological writings. They may, if they please,
consider them as my particular whims or amusements, and accord∣ingly
neglect them. They have, in fact, interfered very little with
my application to philosophy, since I have had the means of doing
it. I was never more busy, or more successfully so, in my philosophi∣cal
pursuits, than during the time that I have been employed about
the History of the Corruptions of Christianity. I am at this very
time, <HI>totus in illis,</HI> as my friends know; and as the Public will
know in due time; which with me is never long, and if you had
thought proper to enter into the discussion I proposed, it would not
have made me neglect my laboratory, or omit a single experiment
that I should otherwise have made.</P>

<P>I NEITHER requested nor wished to have any <HI>private correspondence</HI>
with you. All that my MS. card required, was a simple ac∣knowledgment

<P>As this correspondence, from the origin and nature of it, cannot

judging of the propriety of my answer to your first extraordinary

<P>IF Dr. Priestley consults his friends, he will probably learn, that a
single copy of a paper, addressed under a seal to a single person,
and not relative to any public or official business, must always be
considered as <HI>private</HI> correspondence; which a man of honour is not
at liberty to print without the consent of the writer. That consent
in the present instance, Mr. Gibbon thinks proper to with-hold; and,
as he desires to escape all further altercation, he shall not trouble
Dr. Priestley or himself with explaining the motives of his refusal.</P>

<P>DR. Priestley is as unwilling to be guilty of any real impropriety
as Mr. Gibbon can wish him to be: but, as the correspondence
between them relates not to any <HI>private,</HI> but only to a <HI>public matter,</HI>
he apprehends that it may, according to Mr. Gibbon's own distinction,
at the pleasure of either of the parties be laid before the Public; who,
in fact, are interested to know, at least, the result of it. Dr. Priestley's
<PB N="570" REF="591"/>
conduct will always be open to animadversion, that of Mr. Gibbon,
or of any other person. His appeal is to men of honour, and even
men of the world; and he desires no favour.</P>
<P>Dr. Priestley has sent a single copy of the correspondence to a
friend in London, with leave to shew it to any other common friends,
but with a prohibition to take any other copy: but between this and
<HI>printing</HI> there is no difference, except in <HI>mode</HI> and <HI>extent.</HI> In the
eye of the law and of reason both are equally publications; and has
Mr. Gibbon never thought himself at liberty to shew a copy of a
letter to a third person?</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon may easily escape all further altercation by discon∣tinuing
this mutually disagreeable correspondence, by leaving Dr.
Priestley to act as his own discretion or indiscretion may dictate;
and for this, himself only, and not Mr. Gibbon, is responsible.</P>

<P>QUE j'aime la douce et parfaite confiance de nos sentimens réci∣proques!
Nous nous aimons dans l'éloignement et le silence, et
il nous suffit à l'un et à l'autre, de savoir de tems en tems, des nou∣velles
de la santé et du bonheur de son ami. Aujourd'hui j'ai besoin
de vous écrire' je commence sans excuses et sans reproches, comme
si nous allions reprendre la conversation familière du jour précédent.
Si je proposois de faire un <HI>compte rendu</HI> de mes études, de mes occu∣pations,
de mes plaisirs, de mes nouvelles liaisons, de ma politique
toujours muette, mais un peu plus rapprochée des grands évenemens,
je multiplierois mes <HI>in quarto,</HI> et je ne sais pas encore votre avis sur
ceux que je vous ai dejà envoyés. Dans cette histoire moderne, il
<PB N="571" REF="592"/>
seroit toujours question de la décadence des empires; et autant que
j'en puis juger sur mes réminiscences et sur le rapport de l'ami
Bugnon, vous aimez aussi peu la puissance de l'Angleterre que celle
des Romains. Notre chute, cependant, a été plus douce. Apres une
guerre sans succès, et une paix assez peu glorieuse, il nous reste de
quoi vivre contens et heureux; et lorsque je me suis dépouillé du
rôle de Membre du Parlement, pour redevenir homme, philosophe,
et historien, nous pourrions bien nous trouver d'accord sur la plus part
des scênes étonnantes qui viennent de se passer devant nos yeux, et
qui fourniront une riche matière aux plus habiles de mes suc∣cesseurs.</P>
<P>Bornons nous à cette heure à un objet moins illustre sans doute,
mais plus intéressant pour tous les deux, et c'est beaucoup que le
même objet puisse intéresser deux mortels qui ne se sont pas vûs, qui
a peine se sont écrit depuis—oui ma foi—depuis huit ans. Ma
plume, très paresseuse au commencement, ou plutôt avant le com∣mencement,
marche assez vite, lorsqu'elle s'est une fois mise en train;
mais une raison qui m'empêcheroit de lui donner carrière, c'est l'es∣pérance
de pouvoir bientôt me servir avec vous d'un instrument
encore plus commode, la langue. Que l'homme, l'homme Anglois,
l'homme Gibbon, est un sot animal! Je l'espere, je le desire, je le
puis, mais je ne sais pas si je le veux, encore moins si j'exécuterai
cette volonté. Voici mon histoire, autant qu'elle pourra vous
éclairer, qu'elle pourra m'éclairer moi-même, sur mes véritables in∣tentions,
qui me paroîssent tres obscures, et tres équivoques; et vous
aurez la bonté de m'apprendre qu'elle sera ma conduite future. Il
vous souvient, Seigneur, que mon grand pere a fait sa fortune, que
mon pere l'a mangée avec un peu trop d'appétit, et que je jouis
actuellement du fruit, ou plutêt du reste de leurs travaux. Vous
n'avez pas oublié que je suis entré au Parlement sans patriotisme,
sans ambition, et que toutes mes vues se bornoient à la place com∣mode
et honnête d'un <HI>Lord of Trade.</HI> Cette place, je l'ai obtenue
<PB N="572" REF="593"/>
enfin; je l'ai possédée trois ans, depuis 1779 jusqu' à 1782, et le
produit net, qui se montoit à sept cens cinquante livres sterling, aug∣mentoit
mon revenu, au niveau de mes besoins, et de mes desirs.
Mais au printems de l'année précédente, l'orage a grondé sur nos
têtes: Milord North a été renversé, votre serviteur chassé, et le
<HI>Board</HI> même, dont j'étois membre, aboli et cassé pour toujours, par la
réformation de M. Burke, avec beaucoup d'autres places de l'Etat, et
de la maison du Roi. Pour mon malheur, je suis toujours resté
Membre de la Chambre basse: à la fin du dernier Parlement (en
1780) M. Eliot à retiré sa nomination; mais la faveur de Milord
North a facilité ma rentrée, et la reconnoisance m'imposoit le devoir
de faire valoir, pour son service, les droits que je tenois en partie
de lui. Cet hyver nous avons combatu sous les étendards réunis
(vous savez notre histoire) de Milord North, et de M. Fox; nous
avons triomphé de Milord Shelburne et de la paix, et mon ami (je
n'aime pas à profaner ce nom) a remonté sur sa bête en qualité de
Secretaire d'Etat. C'est à présent qu'il peut bien me dire: <Q>C'étoit
beaucoup pour moi; ce n'étoit rien pour vous;</Q> et malgré les as∣surances
les plus fortes, j'ai trop de raison, pour avoir de la foi.
Avec beaucoup d'esprit, et des qualités très respectables, il n'a plus ni le
titre, ni le crédit de premier ministre; des collegues plus actifs lui en∣levent
les morceaux les plus friands, qui sont aussitôt dévorés par la
voracité de leurs créatures; nos malheurs et nos réformes ont diminué
le nombre des graces; par orgueil ou par paresse, je sollicite aussi mal,
et si je parviens enfin, ce sera peut être à la veille d'une nouvelle
révolution, qui me fera perdre dans un instant, ce qui m'aura coûté
tant de soins et de recherches. Si je ne consultois que mon coeur
et ma raison, je romprois sur le champ cette indigne chaine de la
dépendance; je quitterois le Parlement, Londres, l'Angleterre; je
chercherois sous un ciel plus doux, dans un pays plus tranquille, le
repos, la liberté, l' aisance, et une société éclairée et aimable. Je coule∣rois
quelques années de ma vie sans espérance, et sans crainte,
<PB N="573" REF="594"/>
j'acheverois mon histoire, et je ne rentrerois dans ma patrie qu'en
homme libre, riche, et respectable par sa position, aussi bien que
par son caractère. Mes amis, et surtout Milord Sheffield, ne
veulent pas me permettre d'être heureux suivant mon goût et mes
lumières. Leur prudence exige que je fasse tous mes efforts, pour
obtenir un emploi très sur à la vérité, qui me donneroit mille guinées
de rente, mais qui m'enleveroit cinq jours par semaine. Je me
prête à leur zele, et je leur ai promis de ne partir qu'en automne,
après avoir consacré l'été à cette dernière tentative. Le succès, cepen∣dant,
est très incertain, et je ne sais si je le desire de bonne foi.</P>
<P>Si je parviens à me voir exilé, mon choix ne sera pas douteux
Lausanne a eu mes prémices; elle me sera toujours chere par le doux
souvenir de ma jeunesse. Au bout de trente ans, je me rappelle les
polissons qui sont aujourd'hui juges, les petites silles de la société du
printems, qui sont devenues grand-meres. Votre pays est charmant,
et, malgré le dégoût de Jean Jacques, les moeurs, et l'esprit de ses
habitants, me paroissent très assortis aux bords du lac Léman. Mais
un trésor que je ne trouverois qu'à Lausanne; c'est un ami qui me
convient également par les sentimens, et les idées, avec qui je n'ai
jamais connu un instant d'ennui, de sécheresse, ou de réserve. Au∣trefois
dans nos libres épanchemens, nous avons cent fois fait le
projet de vivre ensemble, et cent fois nous avons épluché tous les
détails du Roman, avec une chaleur qui nous étonnoit nous memes.
A présent il demeure, ou plutôt vous demeurez, (car je me lasse de ce
ton étudié,) dans une maison charmante et commode; je vois d'ici mon
appartement, nos salles communes, notre table, et nos promenades;
mais ce mariage ne vaut rien, s'il ne convient pas également aux
deux époux, et je sens combien des circonstances locales, des goûts
nouveaux, de nouvelles liaisons, peuvent s'opposer aux desseins, qui
nous ont paru les plus agréables dans le lointain. Pour fixer mes
idées, et pour nous épargner des regrets, il faut me dévoiler avec
la franchise dont je vous ai donné l'exemple, le tableau extérieur et
intérieur de George Deyverdun. Mon amour est trop délicat, pour
<PB N="574" REF="595"/>
supporter l'indifférence et les égards, et je rougirois d'un bonheur
dont je serois redevable, non à l'inclination, mais à la fidélité de mon
ami. Pour m'armer contre les malheurs possibles, helas! peut ètre
trop vraisemblables, j'ai essayé de me détacher de la pensée de ce
projet favori, et de me représenter à Lausanne votre bon voisin, sans
être précisement votre commensal. Si j'y étois réduit, je ne voudrois
pas tenir maison, autant par raison d'économie, que pour éviter l'en∣nui
de manger seul. D'un autre côté, une pension ouverte, fut elle
montée sur l'ancien pied de celle de Mesery, ne conviendroit plus
à mon age, ni à mon caractère? Passerois je ma vie au milieu
d'une foule de jeunes Anglois échappés du college, moi qui aimerois
Lausanne cent fois davantage, si j'y pouvois ètre le seul de ma
nation? Il me faudroit donc une maison commode et riante, un
état au dessus de la bourgeoisie, un mari instruit, une femme qui ne
resembleroit pas à Madame Pavilliard; et l'assurance d'y être reçu
comme le fils unique, ou plutôt comme le frere de la famille. Pour
nous arranger sans gêne, je meublerai très volontiers un joli apparte∣ment
sous le même toit, ou dans le voisinage, et puisque le ménage
le plus foible, laisse encore de l'étoffe pour une forte pension, je ne
serois pas obligé de chicaner sur les conditions pécuniaires. Si je
me vois déchu de cette derniére espérance, je renoncerois en soupi∣rant
à ma seconde patrie, pour chercher un nouvel asyle, non pas
à Geneve, triste séjour du travail et de la discorde, mais aux-bords du
lac de Neufchatel, parmi les bons Savoyards de Chamberry, ou sous
le beau climat des Provinces Méridionales de la France. Je finis
brusquement, parceque j'ai mille choses à vous dire. Je pense que
nous nous ressemblons pour la correspondance. Pour le bavardage
savant, ou même amical, je suis de tous les hommes le plus pares∣seux,
mais des qu'il s'agit d'un objet réel, d'un service essentiel, le
premier Courier emporte toujours ma réponse. A la sin d'un mois,
je commencerai à compter les semaines, les jours, les heures. Ne me

Je ne suis pas dégoûté d'une ambition que je ne connus
jamais; mais par d'autres circonstances, je me trouve dans la même
situation d'embarras et d'incertitude où vous êtes aussi à cette
époque. Il y a un an que votre lettre, mon cher ami, m'auroit fait
plaisir sans doute, mais en ce moment, elle m'en fait bien davantage:
elle vient en quelque façon à mon secours.</P>
<P>Depuis mon retour d'Italie, ne pouvant me déterminer à vendre
ma maison, m'ennuyant d'y être seul (car je suis comme vous, Mon∣sieur,
et je déteste de manger sans compagnie) ne voulant pas louēr
à des étrangers, j'ai pris le parti de m'arranger assez joliment au
premier étage, et de donner le second à une famille de mes amis,
qui me nourrit, et que je loge. Cet arrangement a paru pendant
long tems contribuer au bonheur des deux parties. Mais tout est
transitoire sur cette terre. Ma maison sera vuide, selon tout appa∣rence,
sur la sin de l'été, et je me vois d'avance tout aussi embarassé
et incertain, que je l'étais il y a quelques années, ne sachant quelle
nouvelle société choisir, et assez disposé à vendre enfin cette pos∣session
qui m'a causé bien des plaisirs, et bien des peines. Ma
maison est donc à votre disposition pour cet automne, et vous y
<PB N="576" REF="597"/>
arriveriez comme un Dieu dans une machine qui finit l'embroglio
Voilà quant à moi; parlons de vous maintenant avec la même sin∣cérité.</P>
<P>Un mot de préambule. Qulque intéressé que je sois à votre
résolution, convaincu qu'il faut aimer ses amis pour eux mêmes,
sentant d'ailleurs combien il seroit affreux pour moi de vous voir des
regrets, je vous donne ici ma parole d'honneur, que mon intérêt n'in∣flue
en rien sur ce que je vais écrire, et que je ne dirai pas un mot
que je ne vous disse, si l'hermite de la grotte etoit un autre que moi.
Vos amis Anglais vous aiment pour eux mêmes: je ne veux moi
que votre bonheur. Rappellez vous, mon cher ami, que je vis
avec peine votre entrée dans le Parlement, et je crois n'avoir été que
trop bon prophete; je suis sur que cette carrière vous a fait éprouver
plus de privations que de jouissances, beaucoup plus de peines que
de plaisirs; j'ai cru toujours, depuis que je vous ai connu, que vous
étiez destiné à vivre heureux par les plaisirs du cabinet et de la société,
que tout autre marche était un écart de la route du bonheur, et que
ce n'etait que les qualités réunies d'homme de lettres, et d'homme
aimable de société, qui pouvoient vous procurer gloire, honneur,
plaisirs, et un suite continuelle de jouissances. Au bout de quelques
tours dans votre salle, vous sentirez parfaitement que j'avois bien vu,
et que l'évenement a justifié mes idées. Lorsque j'ai appris que vous
étiez <HI>Lord of Trade,</HI> j'en ai été faché; quand j'ai su que vous aviez
perdu cette place, je m'en suis réjouis pour vous; quand on m'a
anoncé que Milord North étoit remonté sur sa bête, j'ai cru vous
voir très mal à votre aise, en croupe derrière lui, et je m'en suis af∣fligé
pour vous. Je suis donc charmé, mon cher ami, de vous savoir
à pied, et je vous conseille très sincèrement de rester dans cette posi∣tion,
et bien loin de solliciter la place en question, de la refuser, si elle
vous était offerte. Mille guinées vous dédommageront elles de cinq
jours pris de la semaine? Je suppose, ce que cependant j'ai peine à
<PB N="577" REF="598"/>
croire, que vous me disiez que oui: et la variété et l'inconstance con∣tinuelle
de votre ministère, vous promettent elles d'en jouir long tems
constamment, et n'est il pas plus désagréable, mon cher Monsieur, de
n'avoir plus 1000 livres sterl. de rente, qu'il n'a été agréable d'en
jouir? D'ailleurs ne pourrez vous pas toujours rentrer dans la car∣rière,
si l'ambition ou l'envie de servir la patrie, vous reprennent; ne
rentrerez vous pas avec plus d'honneur, lorsque vos rentes étant aug∣mentées
naturellement, vous serez libre et indépendant?</P>
<P>En faisant cette retraite en Suisse, outre la beauté du pays, et les
agrémens de la société, vous acquererez deux biens que vous avez
perdus, la liberté et la richesse. Vous ne serez d'ailleurs point
inutile; vos ouvrages continueront à nous éclairer, et independam∣ment
de vos talens, l'honnête homme, le galant homme, n'est jamais
inutile.</P>
<P>Il me reste à vous présente le tableau que vous trouveriez. Vous
aimiez ma maison et mon jardin, c'est bien autre chose à présent.
Au premier étage qui donne sur la descente d'Ouchy, je me suis ar∣rangé
un appartement qui me suffit, j'ai une chambre de domestique,
deux sallons, et deux cabinets. J'ai au plein pied de la terrasse,
deux autres sallons dont l'un sert en été de salle à manger, et l'autre
de sallon de compagnie. J'ai fait un nouvel appartement de trois
pièces dans le vuide entre la maison et la remise, en sorte que j'ai à
vous offrir tout le grand appartement, qui consiste actuellement en
onze pièces, tant grandes que petites, tournées au Levant et au Midi,
meublées sans magnificence déplacée, mais avec une sorte d'élégance
dont j'espère que vous seriez satisfait. La terrasse a peu changé;
mais elle est terminée par un grand cabinet mieux proportionné que le
précédent, garnie tout du long, de caisses d'orangers, &amp;c. La treille,
qui ne vous est pas indifférente, a embelli, prospéré, et regne pres∣qu'entièrement
jusqu'au bout; parvenu à ce bout, vous trouverez un
petit chemin qui vous conduira à une chaumière placée dans un coin;
et de ce coin, en suivant le long d'une autre route à l'Anglaise, le
<PB N="578" REF="599"/>
mur d'un manége. Vous trouverez au bout, un chalet avec écurie,
vacherie, petite porte, petit cabinet, petite bibliothèque, et une galerie
de bois doré, d'où l'on voit tout ce qui sort et entre en ville par la porte
du Chêne, et tout ce qui se passe dans ce Faubourg. J'ai acquis la
vigne au-dessous du jardin; j'en ai arraché tout ce qui étoit devant
la maison; j'en ai fait un tapis vert, arrosé par l'eau du jet d'eau; et
j'ai fait tout autour de ce petit parc, une promenade très variée par
les différens points de vue et les objets même intérieurs, tantot
jardin potager, tantot parterre, tantot vigne, tantot près, puis chalet,
chaumiere, petite montagne; bref, les étrangers viennent le voir et
l'admirent, et malgré la description pompeuse que je vou en fais,
vous en serez content.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> J'ai planté une quantité d'excellens arbres fruitiers.</P>
<P>Venons à moi; vous comprenez bien que j'ai vieilli, excepté pour
la sensibilité; je suis à la mode, mes nerfs sont attaqués; je suis plus
mélancolique, mais je n'ai pas plus d'humeur; vous ne souffrirez
de mes maux que tout au plus négativement. Ensemble, et séparés
par nos logemens, nous jouirons vis-à-vis l'un de l'autre, de la plus
grande liberté. Nous prendrons une gouvernante douce et entendue,
plutôt par commoditè que par nécessité; car je me chargerois sans
crainte de la surintendance. J'ai fait un ménage de quatre, pen∣dant
quelque tems; j'ai fait le mien, et j'ai remarqué que cela mar∣choit
tout seul, quand c'étoit une fois en train. Les petites gens qui
n'ont que ce mérite, font grand bruit pour rien. Mon jardin nous
fournira avec abondance de bons fruits et d'excellens légumes.
Pour la reste de la table et de la dépense domestique, je ne demanderais
pas mieux que de vous reçevoir chez moi, comme vous m'avez reçu
chez vous; mais nos situations sont différentes à cet egard; cepen∣dant
si vous etiez plus ruiné, je vous l'offrirois sans doute, et je
devrois le faire; mais avec les rentes que vous aviez, quand j'étois
chez vous, en les supposant même diminuées, vous vivrez très agré∣ablement
<PB N="579" REF="600"/>
ablement à Lausanne. Enfin à cet égard nous nous arrangerons,
comme il vous sera le plus agréable, et en proportion de nos revenus.
Toujours serez vous ainsi, à ce qui j'espère, plus décemment et plus
comfortablement, que vous ne seriez par tout ailleurs au même prix.</P>
<P>Quant à la société, quoique infiniment agréable, je commence ce
chapitre par vous dire que j'éviterois de vous y inviter, si vous étiez
entièrement désoeuvré; les jours sont longs alors, et laissent bien
du vuide; mais homme de lettres, comme vous êtes, je ne connois
point de société qui vous convienne mieux. Nous aurona autour de
nous un cercle, comme il seroit impossible d'en trouver ailleurs dans
un aussi petit espace. Madame de Corcelles, Mademoiselle Sulens, et
M. de Montolieu (Madame est morte), Messrs. Polier et leurs fem∣mes,
Madame de Severy, et M. et Madame de Nassau, Mademoiselle
de Chandieu, Madame de St. Cierge, et M. avec leurs deux filles
jolies et aimables, Madames de Crousaz, Polier, de Charrieres, &amp;c.
font un fonds de bonne compagnie dont on ne se lasse point, et dont
M. de Servan est si content qu'il regrette toujours d'être obligé de re∣tourner
dans ses terres, et ne respire que pour s'établir tout à fait à
Lausanne. Il passa tout l'hyver de 1782 avec nous, et il fut, on ne
peut plus, agréable. Vous trouverez les moeurs changées en bien,
et plus conformes à nos ages, et à nos caractères; peu de grandes
assemblées, de grands repas, mais beaucoup de petits soupers, de
petites assemblées, où l'on fait ce qu' on veut, où l'on cause, lit, &amp;c.
ct dont on écarte avec soin les facheux de toute espece. Il y le
Dimanche un société, où tout ce qu'il y a d'un peu distingué en
étrangères et étrangers, est invité. Cela fait des assemblées de 40 à 50
personnes, où l'on voit ce qu'on ne voit gueres le reste de la semaine,
et ces especes de <HI>rout</HI> font quelquefois plaisir. Nous sommes fort
dégoutés des étrangers, surtout des jeunes gens, et nous les écartons
avec soin de nos petits comités, à moins qu'ils n'ayent du mérite, ou
quelques talens. A cet égard un de nos petits travers, c'est l'en∣gouement;
mais vous en profiterez, mon cher Monsieur, comme
<PB N="580" REF="601"/>
Edward Gibbon, et comme mon ami; vous ferez d'abord l'homme à
la mode, et je vois d'ici que vous soutiendrez fort bien ce rôle, sans
vous en fàcher, dût on un peu vous surfaire. <HI>Je sens que tu me
flattes, mais tu me fais plaisir,</HI> est peut être le meilleur vers de Des∣touches.
Voilà donc l'hyver; l'étude le matin, quelques conversa∣tions,
quand vous serez fatigué, avec quelque homme de lettres, ou
amateur, ou du moins qui aura vu quelque chose; à l'heure qu'il
vous plaira un diner, point de sermier général, mais l'honnête épi∣curien,
avec un ou deux amis quand vous voudrez; puis quelques
visites, une soirée, souvent un souper. Quant à l'été, vu votre manière
d'aimer la campagne, on diroit que ma remise a été faite pour vous;
pendant que vous vous y promenerez en sénateur, je serai souvent en
bon paysan Suisse, devant mon chalet, ou dans ma chaumière; puis
nous nous rencontrerons tout à coup, et tâcherons de nous remettre
au niveau l'un de l'autre. Nous fermerons nos portes à l'ordinaire,
excepté aux étrangers qui passent leur chemin; mais quand nous
voudrons, nous y aurons tous ceux que nous aimerons à y voir:
car on ne demande pas mieux que d'y venir se rejouir. J'ai eu, un
beau jour d'Avril ce printems, un déjeûner, qui m'a coûté quelques
Louis, ou il y avait plus de 40 personnes, je ne sais combien de
petites tables, une bonne musique au milieu du verger, et une quan∣tité
de jeunes et jolies personnes dansant des branles, et formant des
chifres en cadence; j'ai vu bien des fètes, j'en ai peu vu de plus
jolies. Quand mon pare vous ennuyera, nous aurous, ou nous
louerons ensemble (et ce sera ainsi un plaisir peu cher) un cabriolet
léger, avec deux chevaux gentils, et nous irons visiter nos amis
dispersés dans les campagnes, qui nous recevront à bras ouverts. Vous
en serez content de nos campagnes; toujours en proportion vous
comprenez, et vous trouverez en général un heureux changement
pour les agrémens de la société, et une sorte de recherche simple,
mas élégante. Les bergères du <HI>printems,</HI> excepté Madame de Van∣berg,
ne sont sans doute plus présentables, mais il y en a d'autres assez
<PB N="581" REF="602"/>
gentilles, et quoiqu'elles ne soyent pas en bien grand nombre, il y
en aura toujours assez pour vous, mon cher Monsieur. Peu à peu
mon imagination m'a emporté, et mon style s'égaye, comme cela
nous arrivait quelquefois dans nos chateaux en Espagne. Il est bien
tems de finir cet article, résumons nous plus sérieusement.</P>
<P>Si vous exécutez le plan que vous avez imaginé, j'aimerois même
à dire que vous embrassez, surtout d'après ce que vous marquez
vous même, <HI>Si je ne consultatis que mon coeur et ma raison, je romprois
sur le champ cette indigne chaine,</HI> &amp;c. Eh! que voulez vous consulter,
si ce n'est votre coeur et votre raison? Si, dis-je, vous exécutez
ce plan, vous retrouverez une liberté et une indépendance, que vous
n'auriez jamais du perdre, et dont vous méritez de jouir, une aisance
qui ne vous coûtera qu'un voyage de quelques jours, une tranquil∣lité
que vous ne pouvez avoir à Londres, et enfin un ami qui n'a peut
être pas été un jour sans penser à vous, et qui malgré ses défauts,
ses foiblesses et son infériorité, est encore un des compagnons qui
vous convient le mieux.</P>
<P>Il me reste à vous apprendre pourquoi je vous réponds si tard:
vous savez dejà actuellement que ce n'est pas manque d'amitié et de
zele pour la chose; mais votre lettre m'a été renvoyée de Lausanne
ici, à Strasbourg, et je n'ai passé qu'une poste sans y répondre, ce qui
n'est pas trop, vous l'avouerez, pour un pareil bavardage. Je suis
parti de Lausanne la veille de Pâques pour venir voir un M. Bour∣card
de Basle, fort de mes amis; il est ici auprès du Comte de
Cagliostro, pour prositer de ses remédes. Vous aurez entendu parler
peut être de cet homme extraordinaire à tous égards. Comme j'ai
été assez malade tout l'hyver, je profite aussi de ses remèdes; mais
comme le tems du séjour du Comte ici n'est rien moins que sur, le
mieux sera que vous m'écriviez <HI>à M. D. chez M. Bourcard du Kirsh∣garten,
à Basle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="582" REF="603"/>
Vous comprenez combien à tous égards, il est nécessaire m'écrire
sans perte de tems, dèsque vous aurez pris une résolution. Adieu,
mon cher ami.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="152" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> CLII. M. GIBBON à M. DEYVERDUN.</HEAD>
<P>JE reçois votre lettre du 10 Juin, le 21 de ce mois. Aujourd'hui
Mardi 24th, je mets la main à la plume (comme dit M. Fréron)
pour y répondre, quoique ma missive ne puisse partir par arrange∣ment
des postes, que Vendredi prochain, 27 du courant. O merveille,
de la grace efficace! Elle n'agit pas moins puissamment sur vous,
et moyennant le secours toujours prêt, et toujours prompt de nos
couriers, un mois nous suffit pour la demande et la réponse. Je
remercie mille fois le génie de l'amitié, qui m'a poussé, après mille
efforts inutiles, à vous écrire enfin au moment le plus critique et le
plus favorable. Jamais démarche n'a répondu si parfaitement à tous
mes voeux et à toutes mes espérances. Je comptois sans doute sur
la durée et la vérité de vos sentimens; mais j'ignorois (telle est la
foiblesse humaine) jusqu'à quel point ils avoient pu être attiédis par le
tems et l'éloignement; et je savois encore moins l'état actuel de
votre santé, de votre fortune et de vos liaisons, qui auroient pu
opposer tant d'obstacles à notre réunion. Vous m'écrivez, vous
m'aimez toujours; vous désirez avec zele, avec ardeur, de réaliser nos
anciens projets; vous le pouvez, vous le voulez; vous m'ossrez dès
l'automne votre maison, et quelle maison! votre terrasse, et quelle
terrasse! votre société, et quelle société! L'arrangement nous con∣vient
à tous les deux; je retrouve à la fois le compagnon de ma
jeunesse, un sage conseiller, et un peintre qui sait représenter et
<PB N="583" REF="604"/>
exagérer même les objets les plus rians. Ces exagérations me font
pour le moins autant de plaisir, que la simple vérité. Si votre
portrait étoit tout à fait ressemblant, ces agrémens n'existeroient
que hors de nous mêmes, et j'aime encore mieux les trouver dans
la vivacité de votre coeur et de votre imagination. Ce n'est pas que
je ne reconnoisse un grand fond de vérité dans le tableau de Lau∣sanne;
je connois le lieu de la scêne, je me transporte en idée sur
notre terrasse, je vois ces côteaux, ce lac, ces montagnes, ouvrages
favoris de la nature, et je conçois sans peine les embellissemens que
votre goût s'est plu y ajouter. Je me rappelle depuis vingt ou trente
ans les moeurs, l'esprit, l'aisance de la société, et je comprends que∣ce
véritable ton de la bonne compagnie se perpétue, et s'épure de pere
en fils, ou plutôt de mere en fille; car il m'a toujours paru qu'à Lau∣sanne,
aussi bien qu'en France, les femmes sont très supérieures aux
hommes. Dans un parcil séjour, je craindrois la dissipation bien
plus que l'ennui, et le tourbillon de Lausanne étonneroit un phi∣losophe
accoutumé, depuis tant d'années à la tranquillité de Lon∣dres.
Vous êtes trop instruit pour regarder ce propos, comme
une mauvaise plaisanterie; c'est dans les détroits qu'on est en∣trainé
par la rapidité des courans: il n'y en a point en pleine
mer. Dèsqu'on ne recherche plus les plaisirs bruyans, et qu'on
s'affranchit volontiers des devoirs pénibles, la liberté d'un simple
particulier se fortifie par l'immensité de la ville. Quant à moi,
l'application à mon grand ouvrage, l'habitude, et la récompense
du travail, m'ont rendu plus studieux, plus sédentaire, plus ami de
la retraite. La chambre des communes et les grands dìners exigent
beaucoup de tems; et la tempérance d'un repas Anglois, vous permet
de goûter de cinq ou six vins différens, et vous ordonne de boire une
bouteille de claret après le désert. Mais enfin je ne soupe jamais, je
me couche de bonne heure, je reçois peu de visites, les matinées sont
longues, les étés sont libres, et dèsque je ferme ma porte; je suis oublié
du Monde entier. Dans une société plus bornée et plus amicale, les
<PB N="584" REF="605"/>
démarches sont publiques, les droits sont réciproques, l'on dine
de bonne heure, on se goûte trop pour ne pas passer l'après-midi
ensemble; on soupe, on veille, et les plaisirs de la soirée ne laissent
pas de déranger le repos de la nuit, et le travail du lendemain Quel
est cependant le résultat de ces plaintes? c'est seulement que la mariée
est trop belle, et que j'ose me servir de l'excuse honnête de la santé
et du privilege d'un homme de lettres; il ne tiendra qu'à moi de
modérer un peu l'excès de mes jouissances. Pour cet engouement
que vous m'annoncez, et qui a toujours été le défaut des peuples les
plus spirituels, je l'ai dejà éprouvé sur un plus grand théâtre. Il y a
six ans que l'ami de Madame Necker fut reçu à Paris, comme celui
de George Deyverdum pourroit l'être à Lausanne. Je ne connois
rien de plus flateur que cet accueil favorable d'un public poli et
éclairé. Mais cette faveur, si douce pour l'étranger, n'est-elle pas
un peu dangereuse pour l'habitant exposé à voir flétrir ses lauriers,
par sa faute ou par l'inconstance des ses juges? Non; on se soutient
toujours, peut être pas précisement, au même point d'élévation.
À l'abri de trois gros volumes in quarto en langue étrangère, encore
ce qui n'est pas un petit avantage, je conserverai toujours la réputa∣tion
littéraire, et cette réputation donnera du relief aux qualités
sociales, si l'on trouve l'historien sans travers, sans affectation et
sans prétensions. Je serai donc charmé et content de votre société,
et j'aurois pu dire en deux mots, ce qui j'ai bavardé en deux pages;
mais il y a tant de plaisir à bavarder avec un ami! car ensin je
possède à Lausanne un véritable ami; et les simples connoissances
remplaceront sans beaucoup de peine, tout ce qui s'appelle liaison, et
même amitié, dans ce vaste désert de Londres. Mais au moment ou
j'écris, je vois de tous côtés une foule d'objets dont la perte sera bien
plus difficile à réparer. Vous connossiez ma bibliothèque; mais je
suis en état de vous rendre le propos de votre maison <HI>c'est bien
autre chose à cette heure;</HI> formée peu à peu, mais avec beaucoup de
soin et de dépense, elle peut se nommer aujourd'hui un beau cabinet de
<PB N="585" REF="606"/>
particulier. Non content de remplir à rangs redoublés la meilleure
piece qui lui étoit destinée, elle s'est débordée dans la chambre sur la
rue, dans votre ancienne chambre à coucher, dans la mienne, dans
tous les recoins de la maison de <HI>Bentinck-street,</HI> et jusques dans une
chaumière que je me suis donnée à <HI>Hampton Court.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>J'ai mille courtisans rangés autour de moi:</L>
<L>Ma retraite est mon Louvre, et j'y commande en roi.</L>
</LG>
<P>Le fonds est de la meilleure compagnie Grecque, Latine, Italienne,
Françoise, et Angloise, et les auteurs les moins chers à l'homme de goût,
des ecclésiastiques, des Byzantins, des Orientaux, sont les plus nécessaires
à l'historien de la décadence et de la chute, &amp;c. Vous ne sentez que
trop bien le désagrément de laisser, et l'impossibilité de transporter
cinq ou six milles volumes, d'autant plus que le ciel n'a pas voulu
faire de la Suisse, un pays maritime. Cependant mon zele pour la
réussite de nos projets communs, me fait imaginer que ces obstacles
pourront s'applanir, et que je puis adoucir ou supporter ces privations
douloureuses. Les bons auteurs classiques, la bibliotheque des nations,
se retrouvent dans tous les pays. Lausanne n'est pas dépourvu de
livres, ni de politesse, et j'ai dans l'esprit qu'on pourroit acquérir pour
un certain tems, quelque bibliotheque d'un vieillard ou d'un mineur,
dont la famille ne voudroit pas se défaire entièrement. Quant aux
outils de mon travail, nous commencerons par examiner l'état de
nos richesses; apres quoi il faudroit faire un petit calcul du prix, du
poids et de la rareté de chaque ouvrage, pour juger de ce qu'il
seroit nécessaire de transporter de Londres, et de ce qu'on acheteroit
plus commodément en Suisse; à l'égard de ces frais, on devroit les
envisager comme les avances d'une manufacture transplantée en pays
étranger, et dont on espere retirer dans la suite un profit raisonnable.
Malheureusement votre bibliotheque publique, en y ajoutant même
celle de M. de Bochat, est assez piteuse; mais celles de Berne et de
<PB N="586" REF="607"/>
Basle sont très nombreuses, et je compterois assez sur la bonhommie
Helvétique, pour espérer que, moyennant des recommandations et
des cautions, il me seroit permis d'en tirer les livres dont j'aurois
essentiellement besoin. Vous êtes très bien placé pour prendre les
informations, et pour fixer les démarches convenables; mais vous
voyez du moins combien je me retourne de tous les côtés, pour
esquiver la difficulté la plus formidable.</P>
<P>Venons à present à des objets moins relevés, mais très importans
à l'existence et au bien être de l'animal, le logement, les domestiques,
et la table. Pour mon appartement particulier, une chambre à
coucher, avec un grand cabinet et une antichambre, auroient suffi à
tous mes besoins; mais si vous pouvez vous en passer, je me pro∣menerai
avec plaisir dans l'immensité de vos onze pieces, qui s'ac∣commoderont
sans doute aux heures et aux saisons différentes. L'article
des domestiques renferme une assez forte difficulté, sur la quelle je
dois vous consulter. Vous connoissez, et vous estimez Caplin mon
valet de chambre, maitre d'hotel, &amp;c. qui a été nourri dans notre
maison, et qui comptoit y finir ses jours. Depuis votre départ,
ses talens et ses vertus se sont développés de plus en plus, et je le
considere bien moins sur le pied d'un domestique, que sur celui
d'un ami. Malheureusement il ne sait que l'Anglois, et jamais il
n'apprendra de langue étrangère. Il m'accompagna, il y a six ans,
dans mon voyage à Paris, mais il rapporta fidelement à Londres
toute l'ignorance, et tous les préjugés d'un bon patriote. À Lau∣sanne
il me coûteroit beaucoup, et à l'exception du service personel,
il ne nous seroit que d'une très petite utilité. Cependant je sup∣porterois
volontiers cette dépense, mais je suis très persuadé que, si
son attachement le portoit à me suivre, il s'ennuyeroit à mourir dans
un pays où tout lui seroit étranger et désagréable. Il faudroit donc
me détacher d'un homme dont je connois le zele, la fidélité, rompre
tout d'un coup de petites habitudes qui sont liées avec le bien être
journalier et momentané, et se resoudre à lui substituer un visage
<PB N="587" REF="608"/>
nouveau, peut être un mauvais sujet, toujours quelque avanturier
Suisse pris sur le pavé de Londres. Vous rappellez vous un certain
Georges Suisse qui a fait autrefois avec moi, le voyage de France et
d'Italie? Je le crois marié et établi à Lausanne; s'il vit encore, si
vous pouvez l'engager à se rendre ici, pour me ramener en Suisse,
la compagnie d'un bon et ancien serviteur ne laisseroit pas d'adoucir
la chute, et il resteroit peut être aupres de moi, jusqu'à ce que nous
eussions choisi un jeune homme du pays, adroit, modeste et bien
élevé, à qui je ferois un parti avantageux. Les autres domestiques,
gouvernantes, laquais, cuisinière, &amp;c. se prennent et se renvoyent
sans difficulté. Un article bien plus important, c'est notre table, car
enfin nous ne sommes pas assez hermites, pour nous contenter des
légumes et des fruits de votre jardin, tout excellens qu'ils sont; mais
je n'ai presque rien à ajouter à l'honnêteté de vos propos, qui me
donnent beaucoup plus de plaisir que de surprise. Si je me trouvois
sans fortune, au lieu de rougir des bienfaits de l'amitié, j'accepterois
vos offres aussi simplement que vous les faites. Mais nous ne som∣mes
pas réduits à ce point, et vous comprenez assez qu'une décon∣siture
Angloise laisse encore une fortune fort décente au Pays de Vaud,
et pour vous dire quelque chose de plus précis, je dépenserois sans
peine et sans inconvenient cinq ou six cens Louis. Vous connoissez
le résultat aussi bien que les détails d'un ménage; en supposant une
petite table de deux philosophes Epicuriens, quatre, cinq, ou six
domestiques, des amis assez souvent, des repas assez rarement, beau∣coup
de sensualité, et peu de luxe, à combien estimez vous en gros
le dépense d'un mois et d'une année? Le partage que vous avez dejà
fait, me paroît des plus raisonnables; vous me logez, et je vous
nourris. À votre calcul, j'ajouterois mon entretien personnel, habits,
plaisirs, gages de domestiques, &amp;c. et je verrois d'une manière assez
nette, l'ensemble de mon petit établissement.</P>
<P>Apres avoir essuyé tant de détails minutiex, le cher lecteur s'ima∣gine
sans doute que la résolution de me sixer pendant quelque tems
<PB N="588" REF="609"/>
aux bords du Lac Léman, est parfaitement décidée. Helas! rien
n'est moins vrai; mais je me suis livré au charme délicieux de
compter, de sonder, de palper ce bonheur, dont je sens tout le prix,
qui est à ma portée, et auquel j'aurai peut être la bêtise de renoncer.
Vous avez raison de croire, mais vous ignorez jusq à quel point
vous l'avez, que ma carrière politique a été plus semée épines que de
roses. Eh! quel objet, quel mortel, pourroit me con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ler de l'ennui

personnel?</HI> Les ministres sont rarement dignes de l'inspirer;
jusqu'à present Lord North m'a pas eu à se plaindre de moi, et si je
me retire du Parlement, il lui sera très aise d'y substituer un autre
muet, tout aussi affidé que son ancien ferviteur. Je suis intimement
convaincu, et par la raison, et par le sentiment, qu'il n'y a point de
parti, qui me convienne aussi bien que de vivre avec vous, et auprès
de vous à Lausanne; et si je parviens à la place (<HI>Commissioner of the
Excise or Customs</HI>) ou je vise, il y aura toutes les semaines cinq
longues matinées, qui m'avertiront de la folie de mon choix. Vous
vous trompez à la vérité à l'égard de l'instabilité de ces emplois; ils
sont presques les seuls qui ne se ressentent jamais des révolutions du
ministère. Cependant si cette place s'offroit bientôt, je n'aurois pas le
bon sens et le courage de la refuser. Quels autres conseillers veux je
prendre, si non mon coeur et ma raison? Il en est de puissans et
toujours écoutés: les égards, la mauvaise honte, tous mes amis, ou
soi disant tels, s'écrieront que je suis un homme perdu, ruiné, un
fou qui se dérobe à ses protecteurs, un misanthrope qui s'exile au
bout du monde, et puis les exagérations sur tout ce qui seroit
fait en ma faveur, si surement, si promptement, si libéralement.

Milord Sheffield opinera à me faire interdire et enfermer; mes deux
tantes et ma belle mere se plaindront que je les quitte pour jamais,
&amp;c. Et l'embarras de prendre mon bonnet de nuit, comme disoit
le sage Fontenelle, lorsqu'il n'etoit question que de se coucher, com∣bien
de bonnets de nuit ne me faudra-t-il pas prendre, et les prendre
tout seul, car tout le monde, amis, parens, domestiques, s'opposera
à ma suite. Voila à la vérité des obstacles assez peu redoutables, et
en les décrivant, je sens qu'ils s'affoiblissent dans mon esprit. Grace
à ce long bavardage vous connoissez mon intérieur, comme moi
même, c'est à dire assez mal; mais cette incertitude, très amicale pour

<P>ME voilà un peu embarrassé actuellement; je ne dois vous appeller
ni Monsieuer, ni ami. Eh bien! vous saurez qu'étant parti
Samedi de Strasbourg, pendant que je venois içi, votre seconde lettre
alloit là, et qu'ainsi je reçus, votre troisième, Dimanche, et votre
seconde, hier. La mention que vous y faisiez du Suisse George, dont
je n'ai pu rien trouver dans la première, m'a fait comprendre qu'il y en
avoit une seconde, et j'ai cru devoir attendre un courier, la troisième
n'exigeant pas de réponse.</P>
<P>Pour votre parole, permettez que je vous en dispense encore, et
même jusqu'au dernier jour, je sens bien qu'un procédé contraire,
<PB N="590" REF="611"/>
vous conviendroit; mais certes il ne me convient pas du tout. Ceci,
comme vous le dites, est une espèce de mariage, et pensez vous que
malgré les engagemens les plus solemnels, je n'eusse pas reconduit
chez elle, du pied des autels, la femme la plus aimable qui m'eut
temoigné des regrets. Jamais je ne me consolerois, si je vous voyois
mécontent dans la suite, et dans le cas de me faire des reproches.
C'est à vous à faire, si vous croyez nécessaire, des démarches de votre
côté, qui fortifient votre résolution; pour moi, je n'en ferai point d'es∣sentielles,
jusqu'à ce que j'aye reçu encore une lettre de vous. Après
ce petit préambule, parlons toujours comme si l'affaire étoit décidée,
et repassons votre lettre. Tout ce que vous dites des grandes et
petites villes, est très vrai, et votre comparaison des détroits et de la
pleine mer, est on ne peut pas plus juste et agréable; mais enfin,
<HI>comme on fait son lit, on se couche,</HI> disoit Sancho Pancha d'agréable
mémoire, et qui peut mieux faire son lit à sa guise qu'un étranger,
qui, n'ayant ni devoirs d'état ni de sang à remplir, peut vivre en∣tièrement
isolé, sans que personne y puisse trouver à redire? Moi
même, bourgeois et citoyen de la ville, je suis presqu'entièrement
libre. L'été, par exemple, je déteste de m'enfermer le soir dans des
chambres chaudes, pour faire une partie. Eh bien! on m'a persé∣cuté
un peu la première année; à present on me laisse en repos. Il y
aura sans doute quelque changement dans votre manière de vivre;
mais il me semble qu'on se fait aisement à cela. Les diners, surtout
en femmes, sont très rares; les soupers peu grands; on reste plutôt
pour être ensemble, que pour manger, et plusieurs personnes ne s'as∣seyent
point. Je crois, tout compté et rabaitu, que vous aurez en∣core
plus de tems pour le cabinet qu'à Londres; on sort peu le
matin, et quand nos amis communs viendront chez moi, et vous
demanderont, je leur dirai; <Q>ce n'est pas un oisif comme vous autres,
il travaille dans son cabinet,</Q> et ils se tairont respectueusement.</P>
<P>Pour les bibliotheques publiques, votre idée ne pourroit, je pense,
se réaliser pour un lecteur, ou même un écrivain ordinarie, mais un
<PB N="591" REF="612"/>
homme qui joue un rôle dans la république des lettres, un homme
aimé et considéré, trouvera, je m'imagine, bien des facilités; d'ailleurs,
j'ai de bons amis à Berne, et je prendrai ici des informations.</P>
<P>Passons à la table. Si j'étois à Lausanne, cet article seroit plus sur,
je pourrois revoir mes papiers, consulter; j'ai une chienne de mé∣moire.
À vue de pays cela pourra aller de 20 à 30 Louis par mois,
plus ou moins, vous sentez, suivant la friandise, et le plus ou moins
de convives. Marquez moi dans votre première combien vous coûte
le votre.</P>
<P>Je sens fort bien tous les bonnets de nuit: point de grands change∣mens
sans embarras, même sans regrets; vous en aurez quelque∣fois
sans doute: par exemple, si votre salle à manger, votre salle de
compagnie, sont plus riantes, vous perdrez pour le vase de la bibli∣otheque.
Pour ce qui est des représentations, des discours au moins
inutiles, il me semble que le mieux seroit de masquer vos grandes
opérations, de ne parler que d'une course, d'une visite chez moi, de
six mois ou plus ou moins. Vous feriez bien, je pense, d'aller chez
mon ami Louis Teissier; c'est un brave et honnête homme, qui m'est
attaché, qui aime notre pays; il vous donnera tout plein de bons
conseils avec zele, et vous gardera le secret.</P>
<P>Vous aurez quelquefois à votre table un poëte;—oui, Monsieur, un
poëte:—nous en avons un enfin. Procurez vous un volume 8vo.
<HI>Poësies Helvetiennes, imprimés l'année passee chez Mouser, à Lausanne.</HI>
Vous trouverez entr'autres dans l'épitre au jardinier de la grotte,
votre ami et votre parc. Toute la prose est de votre très humble

<P>Le Comte de Cagliostro a fait un séjour à Londres. On ne sait qui il

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 10th, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will read the following lines with more patience and attention
than you would probably give to an hasty conference, perpe∣tually
interrupted by the opening of the door, and perhaps by the
quickness of our own tempers. I neither expect nor desire an an∣swer
on a subject of extreme importance to myself, but which
friendship alone can render interesting to you. We shall soon meet
at Sheffield.</P>
<P>It is needless to repeat the reflections which we have sometimes
debated together, and which I have often seriously weighed in my
silent solitary walks. Notwithstanding your active and ardent spirit,
you must allow that there is some perplexity in my present situation,
and that my future prospects are distant and cloudy. I have lived
too long in the world to entertain a very sanguine idea of the friend∣ship
or zeal of ministerial patrons; and we are all sensible how much
the powers of patronage are reduced. * * *.
At the end of the Parliament, or rather
long before that time, (for their lives are not worth a year's pur∣chase,)
our Ministers are kicked down stairs, and I am left their dis∣interested
friend, to fight through another opposition, and to expect
the fruits of another revolution. But I will take a more favourable
supposition, and conceive myself in six months firmly seated at the
board of customs; before the end of the next six months I should
infallibly hang myself. Instead of regretting my disappointment, I
rejoice in my escape; as I am satisfied that no salary could pay me
for the irksomeness of attendance, and the drudgery of business so
<PB N="594" REF="615"/>
repugnant to my taste, (and I will dare to say,) so unworthy of my
character. Without looking forwards to the possibility, still more
remote, of exchanging that laborious office for a smaller annuity,
there is surely another plan, more reasonable, more simple, and more
pleasant; a temporary retreat to a quiet and less expensive scene.
In a four years residence at Lausanne, I should live within my in∣come,
save, and even accumulate, my ready money; finish my
History, an object of profit, as well as fame, expect the contin∣gencies
of elderly lives, and return to England at the age of fifty,
to form a lasting independent establishment, without courting the
smiles of a Minister, or apprehending the downfal of a party. Such
have been my serious sober reflections. Yet I much question,
whether I should have found courage to follow my reason and
my inclination, if a friend had not stretched his hand to draw me
out of the dirt. The twentieth of last May I wrote to my friend
Deyverdun, after a long interval of silence, to expose my situation,
and to consult in what manner I might best arrange myself at Lau∣sanne.
From his answer, which I received about a fortnight ago,
I have the pleasure to learn, that his heart and his house are both
open for my reception; that a family which he had lodged for some
years is about to leave him, and that at no other time my company
could have been so acceptable and convenient. I shall step, at my
arrival, into an excellent apartment and a delightful situation; the fair
division of our expences will render them very moderate, and I shall
pass my time with the companion of my youth, whose temper and
studies have alwayes been congenial to my own. I have given him
my word of honour to be at Lausanne in the beginning of October,
and no power or persuasion can divert me from this IRREVOCABLE
resolution, which I am every day proceeding to execute.</P>
<P>I wish, but I scarcely hope, to convince you of the propriety of
my scheme; but at least you will allow, that when we are not able to
prevent the <HI>follies</HI> of our friends, we should strive to render them as
<PB N="595" REF="616"/>
easy and harmless as possible. The arrangement of my house, fur∣niture,
and books will be left to meaner hands, but it is to your zeal
and judgment alone that I can trust the more important disposal of
Lenborough and * * *. On these subjects we may go
into a committee at Sheffield-Place, but you know it is the rule of a
committee, not to hear any arguments against the <HI>principle</HI> of the
bill. At present I shall only observe, that neither of these negocia∣tions
ought to detain me here; the former may be dispatched as well,
the latter much better, in my absence. <HI>Vale.</HI></P>

<P>VOTRE papier s'est furieusement rappetisé; vous avez si bien re∣tranché
le superflu, que vous oubliez l'essentiel, et ce n'est que
par des conjectures sines et savantes que je devine la date du tems et du
lieu. Quant à moi je suis actuellement au château de Milord Sheffield,
à quarante milles de Londres, ce qui ajoute deux jours pour l'arrivée
et le départ du courier. Je reçois votre lettre (je ne sais du quan∣tième)
le 30 Juillet de l'an de grace 1783, je réponds du 31 du dit mois
et de la dite année. Le zele ne se rallentit point pour la consumma∣tion
du grand oeuvre. Je sens votre procédé délicat et généreux, et
quoique je n'eusse pas été faché de trouver dans votre fermeté, un
appui à la mienne, mon inclination est si bien affermie sur la base
inébranlable de l'inclination et de la raison, que je ne crains plus les
obstacles extérieurs ni intérieurs. Dèsque j'ai osé sixer mon départ,
les nuages qui le couvroient, se sont évanouis; les montagnes s'ap∣lanissoient
devant moi, et les dragons qui s'étoient présentés sur
ma route, se sont apprivoisés. La semaine passée, je frappai le
<PB N="596" REF="617"/>
grand coup par la cassation du bail de ma maison de <HI>Bentinck-street;</HI>
et après le mois de Septembre, si je ne couche pas à Lausanne, je
coucherai dans la rue. Mes différens bonnets de nuit s'arrangent
tous les jours, avec beaucoup d'ordre et de facilité. Lord Sheffield
lui même, ce terrible St. George, vrai champion de l'Angleterre, s'est
rendu à mes raisons, ou plutôt aux votres. Il est charmé du tableau
de votre première lettre, et malgré l'activité de son ame, au lieu de
me condamner, il me porte envie; et nous disputons (un peu en
l'air) sur le projet d'une visite que lui, son amiable compagne et sa
fille ainée, se proposent de nous faire dans deux ans aux bords du
Lac Léman. Bien loin de combattre mon dessein, il me conseille,
il me seconde dans l'exécution, et je n'aurai pas besoin de recourir
aux lumières de votre ami Louis Teyssier, d'autant plus que pour les
menus détails de la correspondence étrangère, je trouve dans le
libraire Elmsly un conseiller sage, instruit et discret. * * *
Votre calcul de la dépense de la maison surpasse, non pas absolument
mes moyens, mais un peu mes espérances et mes conjectures. La
consummation en Suisse n'est point chargée d'impots; le vin y coule
comme l'eau de fontaine; votre jardin produit des fruits et des
légumes. Se peut il que vingt ou trente Louis se dépensent tous les
mois pour le pain, la viande, le bois, la chandelle, quelque peu de
vin étranger, les domestiques de la cuisine, &amp;c.? Je me flatte que
dans l'incertitude, vous avez cavé au plus fort; mais enfin tout ce
détail se réglera suivant nos goûts et nos facultés; et un mois d'ex∣périence
sera plus instructif que cent pages de raisonnemens. La
comparaison que vous me demandez de mon ménage de Londres, ne
meneroit à rien. À la riguerur je ne tiens pas maison; je ne donne
presque jamais à manger: en hyver je dine assez rarement chez moi;
je ne soupe jamais; et une partie assez considérable de la dépense
(celle des clubs et des <HI>tavernes</HI>) n'entre point dans le compte de la
<PB N="597" REF="618"/>
maison. Ma nourriture domestique n'excede pas toutefois votre
calcul Lausannois; mais je sens la différence entre le petit couvert
triste et mesquin d'un garçon, et la table honnête et hospitalière de
deux amis, qui auront d'autres amis, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Votre idée de masquer mes grands opérations est de la plus pro∣fonde
politique; mais les déclarations, et même les démarches qui
seront nécessaires pour me retirer de la Chambre des Communes, dé∣clareront
un peu trop tot l'étendue de mes projets. Cependant on
peut tirer quelque parti de cette honnête dissimulation, pour calmer
un peu les scrupules, et les regrets des dames agées que vous con∣noissez,
et que vous ne connoissez pas. Mais le moyen le plus effi∣cace
pour arrêter, ou pour ne pas écouter les mauvais discours, c'est
de s'y dérober par une prompte fuite, et depuis que ma résolution a
été prise, je compte les jours et les momens. Le 10 du mois prochain
je retournerai à Londres, où je travaillerai vivement à préparer ce
grand changement d'état. J'attends tous les jours la réponse de Ma∣dame
Gibbon, à qui j'ai tâché de persuader qu'une entrevue de trois
ou quatre jours à Bath, seroit moins douce qu'amère à tous les deux.
Si elle se rend, ou fait semblant de se rendre à mes raisons, je
compte que tout fini la première, ou du moins la seconde se∣maine
de Septembre, et comme je couperai droit par la Champagne,
et la Franche-Comté, je pourrois fort bien me trouver à Lausanne
vers le 20 ou le 25 de ce mois là, supposé toujours que cette prompti∣tude
vous convienne, que votre maison sera libre, et que vous y
serez rendu vous même. J'avois quelque idée de me détourner par
Strasbourg, de vous prendre à Basle, et de passer avec vous par
Berne, &amp;c. mais, tout bien considéré, j'aime mieux abréger le grand
voyage et réserver cette promenade (si nous avions envie de la faire)
pour une saison plus tranquille. J'attends votre réponse dans une
trentaine de jours; mais sans l'attendre je vous écrirai de Londres,
pour continuer le fil de l'histoire, et peut être pour vous charger de
<PB N="598" REF="619"/>
quelques achats de livres, qui se feront plus commodément à Basle
qu'à Lausanne. Vous ne me donnez point de commissions. Ce∣pendant
ce pays n'est pas sans industrie. Milord et Milady Shef∣field
vous embrassent très amicalement. Ce sera pour mois la perte
la plus sensible.</P>

<P>IL y long tems que je n'ai été aussi mécontent de moi que je le suis
dans ce moment; j'ai fait par l'événement une grande étourderie;
j'ai manqué à ceux qui me quittent, et à celui qui vient me joindre;
enfin je me suis très mal conduit. M. * * *, qui loge chez moi,
me paroîssoit si disposé à quitter ma maison, quand je partis au printems,
que ne doutant pas qu'il ne trouvât à s'arranger pendant tout l'été,
je la regardois dejà d'avance comme vacante. Le plaisir extrême
que j'avois à vous l'offrir, n'a pas peu contribué à soutenir cette il∣lusion;
ensin n'entendant parler cependant de rien, je lui ai écrit,
après avoir reçu il y a six jours votre dernière, et il vient de me
<PB N="600" REF="621"/>
répondre qu'il n'à rien trouvé encore, mais qu'il n'épargnera ni soins
ni dépenses, pour déloger, je ne lui ai au reste point marqué de quoi
il étoit question; mais je l'ai prié de me dire à quelle époque il
croyoit que ma maison pourroit être vacante. Je lui récrirai demain,
car il me paraît qu'il est piqué, et tel que je le connois, malgré ce
que je pourrai lui marquer, il sera fort empressé à décamper; mais
malgré cela, il ne faut plus compter sur la maison entière pour votre
arrivée.</P>
<P>Je vous demande mille pardons, mon cher ami, je me mets à
votre merci; et en vérité si vous me voyiez en ce moment, vous
auriez pitié de moi. Que nous reste-t-il à faire? car enfin il ne faut
pas perdre la tête. J'ai un appartement de deux chambres sans lit, et
deux petits cabinets, où vous pourriez être passablement, en attend∣ant
que la maison fût tout à fait libre; le tout est à plein pied de la
terrasse, je me procurerois un logement au bout de mon jardin, et nous
pourrions nous faire apporter à manger, chose pratiquée par nombre
de Grands Seigneurs, entr'autres par Monseigneur le Margrave
d'Anspach. 2. Ou bien louer un appartement garni que nous occu∣perons
ensemble. Ou ensin 3. passer l'hyver dans quelle autre ville
du Continent qu'il vous plaira choisir, ou j'irai vous joindre et vous
porter mes excuses. Une réflexion que je fais dans ce moment ci, et
qui me console un peu, c'est que dans votre première lettre, votre réso∣lution
ne tenoit point à ma maison, ni même à l'idée de loger et vivre
avec moi. Ce second article aura toujours lieu, s'il vous convient, et le
premier ne sera que différé; ainsi appaisez vous, mon cherami, pardonnez
moi, et écrivez moi tout de suite lequel de ces partis vous convient le
mieux, pour que je m'y conforme; ou si vous en imaginez un nouveau,
annoncez le moi. Une réflexion qui contribue encore à me consoler,
c'est que pendant le tems que nous camperons ainsi en quelque manière,
nous aurons le tems de bien voir autour de nous, et de nous arranger
à notre aise, d'une manière stable et commode pour notre établisse∣ment.
Encore une fois cependant, mon cher ami, mille pardons.</P>
<P><PB N="601" REF="622"/>
Milord Sheffield s'est montré plus raisonnable que je ne l'aurais
cru; diantre! n'allez pas dire cela à sa seigneurie; mais dites-lui, je
vous prie, combien me plait l'espoir d'avoir l'honneur de le con∣noitre;
je vois encore d'ici son beau pare et le charmant ruisseau.
Son suffrage dans des circonstances qui doivent sans doute le prévenir
contre moi, me fait le plus grand plaisir, parceque je le regarde comme
une bien forte preuve que vous prenez un parti convenable à votre
bonheur. Des commissions, je ne saurais trop que vous dire dans
ce moment; comme vous avez une maison montée, voyez s'il n'y
auroit pas des choses Anglaises auxquelles vous êtes accoutumé, et
qui vous feroient plaisir, on en pourroit remplir une caisse. Un ser∣vice
de cette porcelaine de Bath, par exemple, nous conviendroit, ce
me semble, assez.</P>
<P>Une de mes craintes maintenant, c'est que cette lettre ne vous
parvienne peut être point avant votre départ; cela serait très
facheux. Toujours aurai-je soin de me trouver à Lausanne, au moins
vers le milieu de mois prochain. Des couriers, comme celui que
vous amenez, sont ordinairement de vrais domestiques de Grands
Seigneurs, chers et importans; mais vous les connoitrez en route.
Ne soyez pas trop faché contre moi, du contretems que je vous annonce,
et pensez qu'il y a enfin un appartement honnête de garçon, ma

dreaming of your arrival, I thought it unnecessary to apprize you,
that I delayed Hampton to this day; on Monday I shall return, and
will expect you Tuesday evening, either in Bentinck or Downing-street,
as you like best. You have seen the piles of learning accu∣mulated
in your parlour; the transportation will be atchieved to-day,

which I shall inhabit till about the first of September; four days
must be allowed for clearing and packing; these I shall spend in
Downing-street, and after seeing you a moment on your return,
I shall start about Saturday the sixth. London is a desert, and
life, without books, business, or society, will be somewhat tedious.
From this state, you will judge that your plan coincides very well,
only I think you should give me the whole of Wednesday in Ben∣tinck-street.
With regard to Bushy, perhaps as a compliment to Lord

<OPENER><DATELINE>BENTINCK-STREET, <DATE>August 30th, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR the names of Sheffelina, &amp;c. are too playful for the serious
temper of my mind. In the whole period of my life I do not
recollect a day which I felt more unpleasant sensations, than that on
which I took my leave of Sheffield-Place. I forgot my friend Deyver∣dun,
and the fair prospect of quiet and happiness which awaits me at
<PB N="603" REF="624"/>
Lausanne. I lost sight of our almost certain meeting at the end of
a term, which, at our age, cannot appear very distant; nor could I
amuse my uneasiness with the hopes, the more doubtful prospect, of
your visit to Switzerland. The agitation of preparing every thing
for my departure has, in some degree, diverted these melancholy
thoughts; yet I still look forwards to the decisive day (to-morrow
se'nnight) with an anxiety of which yourself and Lord S. have the
principal share.</P>
<P>Surely never any thing was so unlucky as the unseasonable death of
Sir John Russel on his passage to his friend at Sheffield-Place, which
so strongly reminded us of the instability of human life and human
expectations. The inundation of the assizes must have distressed
and overpowered you; but I hope and I wish to hear from yourself,
that the air of your favourite Brighton, the bathing, and the quiet
society of two or three friends have composed and revived your
spirits. Present my love to Sarah, and compliments to Miss Carter,
&amp;c. Give me a speedy and satisfactory line. I am most truly yours.</P>

<P>AS we are not unconscious of each other's feelings, I shall only
say, that I am glad you did not go alone into Sussex; an Ame∣rican
rebel to dispute with gives a diversion to uneasy spirits, and I
heartily wished for such a friend or adversary during the remainder
of the day. No letter from Deyverdun; the post is arrived, but
two Flanders mails are due. Aeolus does not seem to approve of my
designs, and there is little merit in waiting till Friday. I should
wait with more reluctance, did I think there was much chance
of success. I dine with Craufurd, and if any thing is decided,
<PB N="604" REF="625"/>
will send an extraordinary Gazette. You have obliged me beyond
expression, by your kindness to aunt Kitty; she will drink her after∣noon
tea at Sheffield next Friday. For my sake Lady S. will be
kind to the old lady, who will not be troublesome, and will vanish
at the first idea of Brighton. Has not that salubrious air already
produced some effects? Peace will be proclaimed to-morrow; odd!
as war was never declared. The buyers of stock seem as indifferent
as yourself about the definitive treaty. Tell Maria, that though you
had forgotten the <HI>Annales de la Vertu,</HI> I have directed them to be sent,
but know nothing of their plan on merit. Adieu. When you see my
Lady, say every thing tender and friendly to her. I did not know
how much I loved her. She may depend upon my keeping a
separate, though not perhaps a very frequent account with her
<HI>A propos,</HI> I think aunt Kitty has a secret wish to sleep in my room;
if it is not occupied, she might be indulged. Once more, adieu.</P>

<P>SELON ma diligence ordinaire je répondis le 31 Juillet à votre lettre

m'apportent rien de votre part, je serai très étonné, et pas moins

ma vive impatience se fortifie tous les jours, et depuis que
j'ai abandonné ma maison et ma bibliotheque, l'ennui a prêté des

de votre part, car je ne saurois entreprendre ma course, sans être
assuré de la réception qui m'attend au bout. Je me ferai toujours
précéder par un mot de billet; mais la saison est tellement orageuse,
qu'il me sera impossible d'arrêter le jour de mon arrivée à Lausanne,

is not yet declared, and I am ignorant of the name and
merits of my successful competitor. Is it not wonderful that I am
still in suspence, without a letter from Deyverdun? No, it is not
wonderful, since no Flanders mail is arrived: to-morrow three will
be due. I am therefore in a miserable state of doubt and anxiety;
in a much better house indeed than my own, but without books, or
business, or society. I send or call two or three times each day to
Elmsly's, and cna only say that I shall fly the next day, Saturday,

Sunday, &amp;c. after I have got my <HI>quietus.</HI> Aunt Kitty was delighted
with my Lady's letter; at her age, and in her situation, every kind
attention is pleasant. I took my leave this morning; and as I did
not wish to repeat the scene, and thought she would be better at
Sheffield, I suffer her to go to-morrow. Your discretion will com∣municate
or withhold any tidings of my departure or delay as you
judge most expedient. Christie writes to you this post; he talks, in
his rhetorical way, of many purchasers. Do you approve of his
fixing a day for the auction? To us he talked of an indefinite ad∣vertisement.
No news, except that we keep Negapatnam. The
other day the French Ambassador mentioned that the Empress of
Russia, a precious—, had proposed to ratify the principles of
the armed neutrality, by a definitive treaty; but that the French,
obliging creatures! had declared, that they would neither propose
nor accept an article so disagreeable to England. Grey Elliot was
pleased with your attention, and says you are a perfect master of
the subject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American commerce.</NOTE>. Adieu. If I could be sure that no mail would arrive
to-morrow, I would run down with my aunt. My heart is not
light. I embrace my Lady with true affection, but I need not re∣peat

day, by the caprice of the winds. <HI>Three</HI> Flanders Mails are now
due. I know not how to move without the final letter from Dey∣verdun,
which I expected a fortnight ago, and my fancy (perfectly

unreasonable) begins to create strange phantoms. A state of suspence
is painful, but it will be alleviated by the short notes which I mean to
write, and hope to receive, every post. A separation has some ad∣vantages,
though they are purchased with bitter pangs; among them
is the pleasure of knowing how dear we are to our friends, and how
dear they are to us. It will be a kind office to sooth aunt Kitty's
sorrows, and "to rock the cradle of declining age." She will be
vexed to hear that I am not yet gone; but she is reasonable and
cheerful. Adieu. Most truly yours.</P>

<P><HI>ENFIN la bombe a crevé.</HI>—The three Flanders mails are arrived
this day, but without any letters from Deyverdun. Most in∣comprehensible!
After many adverse reflections, I have finally re∣solved
begin my journey on Monday; a heavy journey, with
much apprehension, and much regret. Yet I consider, first, That
if he is alive and well, (an unpleasant <HI>if,</HI>) scarcely any event can have
happened to disappoint our mutual wishes; and, 2dly, That, suppos∣ing
the very worst, even that worst would not overthrow my general
plan of living abroad, though it would derange my hopes of a quiet
and delightful establishment with my friend. Upon the whole,
without giving way to melancholy fears, my reason conjectures that
his indolence thought it superfluous to write any more, that it was
my business to act and move, and his duty to sit still and receive me
with open arms. At least he is well informed of my operations, as
I wrote to him (since his last) July thirty-first, from Sheffiield-Place;
August nineteenth; and this week, September ninth. The two first
have already reached him.</P>
<P><PB N="608" REF="629"/>
As I shall not arrive ar, or depart from, Dover till Tuesday night,
(alas! I may be confined there a week,) you will have an opportunity,
by dispatching a parcel <HI>per</HI> post to Elmsly's, to catch the Monday's
post. Let us improve these last short moments: I want to hear
how poor Kitty behaves. I am really impatient to be gone. It is
provoking to be so near, yet so far from, certain persons. London
is a desert. I dine to-morrow with the Paynes, who pass through.
Lord Loughborough was not returned from Buxton yesterday. Sir
Henry Clinton found me out this morning: he talks with rapture of
visits to be made at Sheffield, and returned at Brighton. I envy
him those visits more than the red ribbon. Adieu.</P>

<HI>per</HI> Sunday's post is not arrived, (as its fate is uncertain and

great-grandfather; but you will cope with one, and would not
have been much afraid of the other. Last night the wind was so
high, that the vessel could not stir from the harbour; this day it is
brisk and fair. We are flattered with the hope of making Calais
harbour by the same tide, in three hours and a half; but any delay
will leave the disagreeable option of a tottering boat or a tossing
night. What a cursed thing to live in an island, this step is more
awkward than the whole journey! The triumvirate of this memo∣rable
embarkation will consist of the grand Gibbon, Henry Laurence
Esquire, President of Congress, and Mr. Secretary, Colonel, Admiral,
Philosopher, Thompson, attended by three horses, who are not the

symptom of sea-sickness, while my companions were spewing round
me. Laurence has read the pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Sheffield's Observations on the Commerce of the American States.</NOTE>, and thinks it has done
much michief. A good sign! Adieu. The Captain is impatient.

I recovered my road,) Aire, Bethune, Douay, Cambray, St. Quintin,
La Fere, Laon, Rheims, Chalons, St. Dizier, and Langres, where I
have just finished my supper. The Inns, in general, more agreeable
to the palate, than to the sight or smell. But, with some short ex∣ceptions
of time and place, I have enjoyed good weather and good
roads, and at the end of the ninth day, I feel so little fatigued, that
the journey appears no more than a pleasant airing. I have gene∣rally

conversed with Homer and Lord Clarendon, often with Caplin
and Muff<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His dog.</NOTE>; sometimes with the French postillions, of the above-mentioned
animals the least rational. To-morrow I lie at Besançon,

either sup at Lausanne on Friday, or dine there Saturday. I feel
some suspence and uneasiness with regard to Deyverdun; but in the
scale both of reason and constitution, my hopes preponderate very
much above my fears. From Lausanne I will immediately write.
I embrace my Lady. If aut Kitty's gratitude and good-breeding
have not driven her away upon the first whisper of Brighton, she will

<P>I ARRIVED safe in harbour last Saturday, the 27th instant, about
ten o'clock in the morning; but as the post only goes out twice
a week, it was not in my power to write before this day. Except
one day, between Langres and Besançon, which was laborious
enough, I finished my easy and gentle airing without any fatigue,
either of mind or body. I found Deyverdum well and happy, but
much more happy at the sight of a friend, and the accomplishment
of a scheme which he had so long and impatiently desired. His
garden, terrace, and <HI>park,</HI> have even exceeded the most sanguine of
my expectations and remembrances; and you yourself cannot have
<PB N="611" REF="632"/>
forgotten the charming prospect of the lake, the mountains, and the de∣clivity
of the Pays de Vaud. But as human life is perpetually chequered
with good and evil, I have found some disappointments on my arrival.
The easy nature of Deyverdun, his indolence, and his impatience,
had promted him to reckon too positively that his house would be
vacant at Michaelmas; some unforeseen difficulties have arisen, or
have been discovered when it was already too late, and the consum∣mation
of our hopes is (I am much afraid) postponed to next
spring. At first I was knocked down by the unexpected thunder∣bolt,
but I have gradually been reconciled to my fate, and have
granted a free and gracious pardon to my friend. As his own apart∣ment,
which afforded me a temporary shelter, is much too narrow
for a settled residence, we hired for the winter a convenient ready-furnished
apartment in the nearest part of the Rue de Bourg, whose
back door leads in three steps to the terrace and garden, as often as
a tolerable day shall tempt us to enjoy their beauties; and this ar∣rangement
has even its advantage, of giving us time to deliberate
and provide, before we enter on larger and more regular establish∣ment.
But this is not the sum of my misfortunes; hear, and pity!
The day after my arrival (Sunday) we had just finished a very tem∣perate
dinner, and intended to begin a round of visits on foot,
<HI>chapeau sous le bras,</HI> when, most unfortunately, Deyverdun proposed
to shew me something in the court; we boldly and successfully
ascended a flight of stone steps, but in the descent I missed my foot∣ing,
and strained, or sprained, my ancle in a painful manner. My
old latent enemy, (I do not mean the Devil,) who is always on the
watch, has made an ungenerous use of his advantage, and I much
fear that my arrival at Lausanne will be marked with a fit of the
gout, though it is quite unnecessary that the intelligence or suspicion
should find its way to Bath. Yesterday afternoon I lay, or at least
sat, in state to receive visits, and at the same moment my room was
filled with four different nations. The loudest of these nations
<PB N="612" REF="633"/>
was the single voice of the Abbé Raynal, who, like your friend,
has chosen this place for the asylum of freedom and history. His
conversation, which might be very agreeable, is intolerably loud,
peremptory, and insolent; and you would imagine that he alone
was the monarch and legislator of the world. Adieu. I embrace
my Lady, and the infants. With regard to the important transac∣tions
for which you are constituted plenipotentiary, I expect with
some impatience, but with perfect confidence, the result of your la∣bours.
You may remember what I mentioned of my conversation
with * * * about the place of Minister at Bern: I have
talked it over with Deyverdun, who does not dislike the idea, pro∣vided
this place was allowed to be my villa, during at least two-thirds
of the year; but for my part, I am sure that * * * are
worth more than ministerial friendship and gratitude; so I am in∣clined
to think, that they are preferable to an office which would be
procured with difficulty, enjoyed with constraint and expence, and
lost, perhaps, next April, in the annual revolutions of our domestic
Government. Again adieu.</P>

<P>THE progress of my gout is in general so regular, and there is
so much uniformity in the History of its Decline and Fall, that
I have hitherto indulged my laziness, without much shame or re∣morse,
without supposing that you would be very anxious for my
safety, which has been sufficiently provided for by the triple care of
my friend Deyverdun, my humbler friend Caplin, and a very con∣versable
physician, (not the famous Tissot,) whose ordinary fee is ten
batz, about fifteen pence English. After the usual increase and de∣crease
<PB N="613" REF="634"/>
of the member (for it has been confined to the injured part)
the gout has retired in good order, and the remains of weakness,
which obliged me to move on the rugged pavement of Lausanne
with a stick, or rather small crutch, are to be ascribed to the sprain,
which might have been a much more serious business. As I have
now spent a month at Lausanne, you will enquire with much cu∣riosity,
more kindness, and some mixture of spite and malignity,
how far the place has answered my expectations, and whether I do
not repent of resolution which has appeared so rash and ridiculous
to my ambitious friends? To this question, however natural and
reasonable, I shall not return an immediate answer, for two reasons:
1. <HI>I have not yet made a fair trial.</HI> The disappointment and delay with
regard to Deyverdun's house, will consine us this winter to lodgings,
rather convenient than spacious or pleasant. I am only beginning
to recover my stength and liberty, and to look about on persons and
things; the greatest part of those persons are in the country taken
up with their vintage; my books are not yet arrived, and, in short,
I cannot look upon myself as settled in that comfortable way which
you and I understand and relish. Yet the weather has been hea∣venly,
and till this time, the end of October, we enjoy the bright∣ness
of the fun, and somewhat gently complain of its immoderate
heat. 2. If I should be too sanguine in explaining my satisfaction
in what I have done, you would ascribe that satisfaction to the no∣velty
of the scene, and the inconstancy of man; and I deem it far
more safe and prudent to postpone any positive declaration, till I am
placed by experience beyond the danger of repentance and recanta∣tion.
Yet of one thing I am sure, that I possess in this country, as
well as in England, the best cordial of life, a sincere, tender, and
sensible friend, adorned with the most valuable and pleasant qualities
both of the heart and head. The inferiour enjoyments of leisure
and society are likewise in my power; and in the short excursions
which I have hitherto made, I have commenced or renewed my ac∣quaintance
<PB N="614" REF="635"/>
with a certain number of persons, more especially wo∣men,
(who, at least in France and this country, are undoubtedly su∣perior
to our prouder sex,) of rational minds and elegant manners.
I breakfast alone, and have declared that I receive no visits in a
morning, which you will easily suppose is devoted to study. I find
it impossible, without inconvenience, to defer my dinner beyond two
o'clock. We have got a very good woman cook. Deyverdun,
who is somewhat of an Epicurean philosopher, understands the ma∣nagement
of a table, and we frequently invite a guest or two to
share our luxurious, but not extravagant repasts. The afternoons
are (and will be much more so hereafter) devoted to society, and I
shall sind it necessary to play at cards much oftener than in London:
but I do not dislike that way of passing a couple of hours, and I
shall not be ruined at shilling whist. As yet I have not supped, but
in the course of the winter I must sometimes sacrifice an evening
abroad, and in exchange I hope sometimes to steal a day at home,
without going into company * * *.
I have all this time been talking to Lord Sheffield; I hope that he has
dispatched my affairs, and it would give me pleasure to hear that I
am no longer member for Lymington, nor Lord of <HI>Lenborough.</HI>
Adieu. I feel every day that the distance only to make me
think with more tenderness of the persons whom I love.</P>

<P>LAST Tuesday, November eleventh, after plaguing and vexing
yourself all the morning, about some business of your fertile
creation, you went to the House of Commons, and passed the after∣noon,
<PB N="615" REF="636"/>
the evening, and perhaps the night, without sleep or food,
stifled in a close room by the heated respiration of six hundred po∣liticians,
inflamed by party and passion, and tired of the repetition
of dull nonsense, which, in that illustrious assembly, so far out∣weighs
the proportion of reason and eloquence. On the same day,
after a studious morning, a friendly dinner, and a cheerful assembly
of both sexes, I retired to rest at eleven o'clock, satisfied with the
past day, and certain that the next would afford me the return of the
same quiet and rational enjoyments. <HI>Which has the better bargain?</HI>
Seriously, I am every hour more grateful to my own judgment and
resolution, and only regret that I so long delayed the execution of
a favourite plan, which I am convinced is the best adapted to my
character an inclinations. You conjecture of the revolutions of
my face, when I heard that the house was for this winter inacessible,
is probable, but false. I bore my disappointment with the temper of
a sage, and only use it to render the prospect of next year still more
pleasing to my imagination. You are likewise mistaken, in imput∣ing
my fall to the awkwardness of my limbs. The same accident
might have happened to Slingsby himself, or to any <HI>hero</HI> of the age;
the most distinguished for his <HI>bodily activity.</HI> I have now resumed
my entire strength, and walk with caution, yet with speed and
safety, through the streets of this mountainous city. After a month
of the finest autumn I ever saw, the <HI>bise</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The North East wind.</NOTE> made me feel my old
acquaintance; the weather is now milder, and this present day is
dark and rainy, not much better than what you probably enjoy in
England. The town is comparatively empty, but the Noblesse are
returning every day from their chateaux, and I already perceive that
I shall more reason to complain to complain of dissipation than of dulness,
As I told Lady S. I am afraid of being too rash and hasty in ex∣pressing
my satisfaction; but I must again repeat, that appearances
<PB N="616" REF="637"/>
are extremely favourable. I am sensible that general praise conveys
no distinct ideas, but it is very difficult to enter into particulars
where the individuals are unknown, or indifferent to our corre∣spondent.
You have forgotten the <HI>old</HI> generation, and in twenty years
a new one is grown up. Death has swept many from the world,
and chance or choice has brought many to this place. If you en∣quire
after your old acquaintance Catherine, you must be told, that
she is solitary, ugly, blind, and universally forgotten. Your later
flame, and our common goddess, the Eliza, passed a month at the
inn. She came to consult Tissot, and was acquainted with Cerjat.
And now to business. * * *
With regard to meaner cases, these are two, which you can and
will undertake. 1. As I have not renounced my country, I should
be glad to hear of your parliamentary squabbles, which may be
done with small trouble and expence. After an interesting debate,
my Lady in due time may cut the speeches from Woodfall. You
will write or dictate any curious anecdote, and the whole, inclosed
in a letter, may be dispatched to Lausanne. 2. A set of Wedge∣wood
china, which we talked of in London, and which would be
most acceptable here. As you have a <HI>sort</HI> of a taste, I leave to
your own choice the colour and the pattern; but as I have the in∣clination
and means to live very handsomely <HI>here,</HI> I desire that the
size and number of things may be adequate to a plentiful table. If
you see Lord North, assure him of my gratitude; had he been a
more successful friend, I should now be drudging at the Board of
Customs, or vexed with business in the amiable society of—.
To Lord Loughborough present an affectionate sentiment; I am sa∣tisfied
of his intention to serve me, if I had not been in such a
fidget. I am sure you will not fail, while you are in town, to visit
and comfort poor aunt Kitty. I wrote to her on my first arrival,
and she may be assured that I will not neglect her. To my Lady I
<PB N="617" REF="638"/>
say nothing; we have now our private correspondence, into which
the eye of an husband should not be permitted to intrude. I am
really satisfied with the success of the pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations on the Commerce with the American States.</NOTE>; not only because
I have a sneaking kindness for the author, but as it shews me that
plain sense, full information, and warm spirit, are still acceptable in
the world. You talk of Lausanne as a place of retirement, yet,
from the situation and freedom of the Pays de Vaud, all nations,
and all extraordinary characters, are astonished to meet each other.
The Abbé Raynal, the grand Gibbon, and Mercier, author of the
<HI>Tableau de Paris,</HI> have been in the same room. The other day the
Prince and Princess de Ligne, the Duke and Duchess d'Ursel, &amp;c.
came from Brussels on purpose (literally true) to act a comedy at
* * *, in the country. He was dying, and could not
appear; but we had comedy, ball, and supper. The event seems to
have revived him; for that great man is fallen from his ancient
glory, and his nearest relations refuse to see him. I told you of
poor Catherine's deplorable state; but Madame de Mesery, at the age
of sixty-nine, is still handsome. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>December 20th, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received both your epistles; and as any excuse will serve a
man who is at the same time very busy and very idle, I patiently
expected the second, before I entertained any thoughts of answering
the first. * * *
I therefore conclude, that on every principle of common sense, be∣fore
this moment your active zeal has already expelled me from the
<PB N="618" REF="639"/>
house, to which, without regret, I bid an everlasting farewel. The
agreeable hour of five o'clock in the morning, at which you com∣monly
retire, does not tend to revive my attachment; but if you add
the soft hours of your morning Committee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A select Committee for inquiring into frauds committed in respect to the revenue.</NOTE>, in the discussion of taxes,
customs, frauds, smugglers, &amp;c. I think I should beg to be released
and quietly sent to the gallies, as a place of leisure and freedom.
Yet I do not depart from my general principles of toleration. Some
animals are made to live in the water, others on the earth, many in
the air, and some, as it is now believed, even in fire. Your present
hurry of Parliament I perfectly understand; when opposition make
the attack,
<Q><L>—Horae</L>
<L>Momento cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta.</L></Q>
But when the Minister brings forward any strong and decisive mea∣sure,
the at length prevails; but his progress is retarded at every step,
and in every stage of the bill, by a pertinacious, though unsuccessful,
minority. I am not sorry to hear of the splendour of Fox; I am
proud, in a foreign country, of his fame and abilities, and our little
animosities are extinguished by my retreat from the English stage.
With regard to the substance of the business, I scarcely know what
to think: the vices of the Company<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">East India Company.</NOTE>, both in their persons and their
constitution, were manifold and manifest; the danger was imminent,
and such an empire, with thirty millions of subjects, was not to be
lost for trifles. Yet, on the other hand, the faith of charters, the
rights of property! I hesitate and tremble. Such an innovation
would at least require that the remedy should be as certain as the
evil, and the proprietors may perhaps insinuate, that <HI>they</HI> were as
competent guardians of their own affairs, as either * * *
or * * *. Their acting without a salary, seems
childish, and their not being removable by the Crown, is a strange
<PB N="619" REF="640"/>
and dangerous precedent. But enough of politics, which I now be∣gin
to view through a thin, cold, distant cloud, yet not without a
reasonable degree of curiosity and patriotism. From the papers
(especially when you add an occasional slice of the Chronicle) I shall
be amply informed of facts and debates. From you I expect the
causes, rather than the events, the true springs of action, and those
interesting ancedotes which seldom ascend the garret of a Fleet-street
editor. You say that many friends (alias acquaintance) have ex∣pressed
curiosity and concern; I should not wish to be immediately
forgotten. That others (you once mentioned Gerard Hamilton) con∣demn
Government, for suffering the departure of a man who might
have done them some credit and some service, perhaps as much as
* * * himself. To you, in the confidence of friendship,
and without either pride or resentment, I will fairly own that I am
somewhat of Gerards's opinion; and if I did not compare it with
the rest of his character, I should be astonished that * * *
suffered me to depart, without even a civil answer to my letter.
Were I capable of hating a man, whom it is not easy to hate, I should
sind myself amply revenged by * * *. But the happy souls in
Paradise are susceptible only of love and pity, and though Lausanne is
not a Paradise, more especially in winter, I do assure you, in sober
profe, that it has hitherto fulfilled, and even surpassed, my warmest
expectation. Yet I often cast a look toward Sheffield-Place, where
you now repose, if you can repose, during the Christmas re∣cess.
Embrace my Lady, the young Baroness, and the gentle
Louisa, and insinuate to your silent Consort, that separate letters re∣quire
separate answers. Had I an air balloon, the great topic of
modern conversation, I would call upon you till the meeting of Par∣liament.

<P>THE unfortunate are loud and loquacious in their complaints, but
real happiness is content with its own silent enjoyment; and if
that happiness is of a quiet uniform kind, we suffer days and weeks
to elapse without communicating our sensations to a distant friend.
By you, therefore, whose temper and understanding have extracted
from human life on every occasion the best and most comfortable in∣gredients,
my silence will always be interpreted as an evidence of
content, and you would only be alarmed (the danger is not at
hand) by the too frequent repetition of my letters. Perhaps I
should have continued to slumber, I don't know how long, had I
not been awakened by the anxiety which you express in your last
letter. * * *</P>
<P>From this base subject I ascend to one which more seriously and
strongly engages your thoughts, the consideration of my health
and happiness. And you will give me credit when I assure you
with sincerity, that I have not repented a single moment of the step
which I have taken, and that I only regret the not having executed
the same design two, or five, or even ten years ago. By this time
I might have returned independant and rich to my native country;
I should have escaped many disagreeable events that have happened
in the meanwhile, and I should have avoided the parliamentary life,
which experience has proved to be neither suitable to my temper, nor
conducive to my fortune. In speaking of the happiness which I
enjoy, you will agree with me, in giving the preference to a sincere
and sensible friend; and though you cannot discern the full extent
of his merit, you will easily believe that Deyverdun is the man.
<PB N="621" REF="642"/>
Perhaps two persons so perfectly fitted to live togethe, were never
ormed by Nature and education. We have both read and seen a
great variety of objects; the lights and shades of our different cha∣racters
are happily blended, and a friendship of thirty years has
taught us to enjoy our mutual advantages, and to support our un∣avoidable
imperfections. In love and marriage, some harsh sounds
will sometimes interrupt the harmony, and in the course of time,
like our neighbours, we must expect some disagreeable moments;
but confidence and freedom are the two pillars of our union, and I
am much mistaken, if the building be not solid and comfortable.
One disappointment I have indeed experienced, and patiently sup∣ported.
The family who were settled in Deyverdun's house started
some unexpected difficulties, and will not leave it till the spring; so
that you must not yet expect any poetical, or even historical, de∣scription
of the beauties of my habitation. During the dull months
of winter we are satisfied with a very comfortable apartment in the
middle of the town, and even derive some advantage from this de∣lay;
as it gives us time to arrange some plans of alteration and fur∣niture,
which will embellish our future and more elegant dwelling.
In this season I rise (not at four in the morning) but a little before
eight; at nine, I am called from my study to breakfast, which I al∣ways
perform alone, in the English stile, and, with the aid of
Caplin, I perceive no difference between Lausanne and Bentinck-street.
Our mornings are usually passed in separate studies; we
never approach each other's door without a previous message, or
thrice knocking, and my apartment is already sacred and formidable
to strangers. I dress at half past one, and at two (an early hour, to
which I am not perfectly reconciled,) we sit down to dinner. We have
hired a female cook, well-skilled in her profession, and accustomed to
the taste of every nation; as for instance, we had excellent mince-pies
yesterday. After dinner, and the departure of our company, one
two, or three friends, we read together some amusing book, or
<PB N="622" REF="643"/>
play at chess, or retire to our rooms, or make visits, or go to the
coffee-house. Between six and seven the assemblies begin, and I am
oppressed only with their number and variety. Whist, at shillings
or half-crowns, is the game I generally play, and I play three rub∣bers
with pleasure. Between nine and ten we withdraw to our bread
and cheefe, and friendly converse, which sends us to bed at eleven;
but these sober hours are too often interrupted by private or nume∣rous
suppers, which I have not the courage to resist, though I practise
a laudable abstinence at the best furnished tables. Such is the ske∣leton
of my life; it is impossible to communicate a perfect idea of
the vital and substantial parts, the characters of the men and women
with whom I have very easily connected myself in looser and closer
bonds, according to their inclination and my own. If I do not de∣ceive
myself and if Deyverdun does not flatter me, I am already a
general favourite; and as our likings and dislikes are commonly
mutual, I am equally satisfied with the freedom and elegance of man∣ners,
and (after proper allowances and exceptions) with the worthy
and amiable qualities of many individuals. The autumn has been
beautiful, and the winter hitherto mild, but in January we must
expect some severe frost. Instead of rollings in a coach, I walk the
streets, wrapped up in a fur cloak; but this exercise is wholesome,
and except an accidental fit of the gout of a few days, I never en∣joyed
better health. I am no longer in Pavillard's house, where I
was almost starved with cold and hunger, and you may be assured
that I now enjoy every benefit of comfort, plenty, and even decent
luxury. You wish me happy; acknowledge that such a life is more
conducive to happiness, than five nights in the week passed in the
House of Commons, or five mornings spent at the Custom-house.
Send me, in return, a fair account of your own situation in mind
and body. I am satisfied your own good sense would have recon∣ciled
you to inevitable separation; but there never was a more suit∣able
diversion than your visit to Sheffield-Place. Among the innu∣merable
<PB N="623" REF="644"/>
proofs of friendship which I have received from that family,
there are none which affect me more sensibly than their kind civilities
to you, though I am persuaded that they are at least as much on
your account as on mine. At length Madame de * * *
is delivered by her tyrant's death; her daughter, a valuable woman
of this place, has made some enquiries, and though her own cir∣cumstances
are narrow, she will not suffer her father's widow to be
left totally destitute. I am glad you derived so much melancholy
pleasure from the letters, yet had I known it, I should have withheld

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>January 24th, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WITHIN two or three days after your last <HI>gracious</HI> epistle, your
complaints were silenced, and your enquiries were satisfied,
by an ample dispatch of four pages, which overflowed the inside of
the cover, and in which I exposed my opinions of things in general,
public as well as private, as they existed in my mind, in my state
of ignorance and error, about the eighteenth or twentieth of last
month. Within a week after that date I epistolished, in the same rich
and copious strain, the two venerable females of Newman-street and
Bath, whose murmurings must now be changed into songs of gra∣titude
and applause. My correspondence with the holy matron of
Northamptonshire has been less lively and loquacious. You have
not forgotten the author's vindication of himself from the foul ca∣lumnies
of pretended Christians. Within a fortnight after his arrival
at Lausanne, he communicated the joyful event to Mrs. Esther Gibbon.
She answered, <HI>per</HI> return of post, both letters at the same time, and
in very dutiful language, almost excusing her advice, which was in∣tended
<PB N="624" REF="645"/>
for my spiritual, as well as temporal good, and assuring me,
that <HI>nobody should be able to injure me with her.</HI> Unless the saint is
an hypocrite, such an expression must convey a favourable and im∣portant
meaning. At all events, it is worth giving <HI>ourselves</HI> some
trouble about her, without indulging any sanguine expectations of
inheritance. So much for my females; with regard to my male
correspondents, you are the only one to whom I have given any
signs of my existence, though I have formed many a generous reso∣lution.
Yet I am not insensible of the kind and friendly manner in
which Lord Loughborough has distinguished me. He could have
no inducements of interest, and now that I veiw the distant picture
with impartial eyes, I am convinced that (for a statesman) he was
sincere in his wishes to serve me. When you see <HI>him,</HI> the Paynes,
Eden, Crauford, &amp;c. tell them that I am well, happy, and ashamed.
On your side, the zeal and diligence of your pen has surprised and
delighted me, and your letters, at this interesting moment, are ex∣actly
such as I wished them to be—authentic anecdotes, and rational
speculations, worthy of a man who acts a part in the great theatre,
and who fills a seat, not only in the general Pandaemonium, but in
the private council of the princes of the infernal regions. With
regard to the detail of parliamentary operations, I must repeat my
request to you, or rather to my Lady, who will now be on the spot,
that she will write, not with her pen, but with her scissars, and that
after every debate which deserves to pass the sea and mountains,
she will dissect the faithful narrative of Woodfall, and send it off by
the next post, as an agreeable supplement to the meagre accounts of
our weekly papers. The wonderful revolutions of last month have
sounded to my ear more like the shifting scenes of a comedy, or
comic-opera, than like the sober events of real and modern history;
and the irregularity of our winter posts, which sometimes retarded,
and sometimes hastened, the arrival of the dispatches, has increased
the confusion of our ideas. Surely the Lord has blinded the eyes
<PB N="625" REF="646"/>
of Pharoah and of his servants; the obstinacy of last spring was
nothings compared to the headstrong and headlong madness of this
winter. I expect with much impatience the first days of your
meeting; the purity and integrity of the coalition will suffer a fiery
trial; but if they are true to themselves and to each other, a ma∣jority
of the House of Commons must prevail; the rebellion of the
young gentlemen will be crushed, and the masters will resume the
government of the school. After the address and answer, I have
no conception that Parliament can be dissolved during the session;
but if the present Ministry can outlive the storm, I think the death-warrant
will infallibly be signed in the summer. <HI>Here</HI> I blush for
my country, without confessing her shame. Fox acted like a man
of honour, yet surely his union with Pitt affords the only hope of
salvation. How miserably are we wasting the season of peace!</P>
<P>I have written three pages before I come to my own business and
feelings. In the first place, I most sincerely rejoice that I left the
ship, and swam ashore on a plank: the daily and hourly agitation
in which I must have lived would have made me truly miserable;
and if I had obtained a place during pleasure, * * *, for
instance? On the first news of the dissolution, I considered my seat
as so totally and irrecoverably gone, that I have been less afflicted
with * * *'s obstinacy. * * *
On this occasion remember you are acting for a <HI>poor</HI> friend; dismiss
a little of the spirit of faction and patriotism, and stoop to a pru∣dential
line of conduct, which in your own case you might possibly
disdain. * * *
Perhaps you will abuse my prudence and patriotism, when I inform
you, that I have already vested a part (thirty thousand livres, about
one thousand three hundred puunds) in the new loan of the King of
France. I get eight <HI>per cent.</HI> on the joint lives of Deyverdun and
<PB N="626" REF="647"/>
myself, besides thirty tickets in a very advantageous lottery, of which
the highest prize is an annuity of forty thousand livres (one thousand
seven hundred pounds) a year. At this moment, the beginning of
a peace, and probably a long peace, I think (and the world seems
to think) the French funds at least as solid as our own, I have em∣powered
my agent, M. de Lessart, a capital banker at Paris, to draw
upon Gosling for the money two months hence; and to avoid all
accidents that may result from untoward delays, and mercantile
churlishness, I expect that you will support my credit in Fleet-street
with you own more respectable name. * * *
What say you now? Am I not a wise man? My letter is enormous,
and the post on the wing. In a few days I will write to my Lady
herself, and enter something more into the details of domestic life.
Suffice it to say, that the scene becomes each day more pleasant
and comfortable, and that I complain only of the dissipation of
Lausanne. In the course of March or April we shall take pos∣session
of Deyverdun's house. My books, which, by some strange
neglect, did not leave Paris till the third of this month, will arrive
in a few weeks; and I shall soon resume the continuation of my
History, which I shall prosecute with the more vigour, as the com∣pletion
affords me a distant prospect of a visit to England. Adieu.
Ever yours.</P>

<P>AFTER my last enormous dispatch, nothing can remain, except
some small gleanings, or occasional hints; and thus in order:
I am not conscious that any of your valuable MSS. have miscarried,
or that I have omitted to answer any essential particulars. They
<PB N="627" REF="648"/>
stand in my bureau carefully arranged, and docketed under the fol∣lowing
dates; September twenty-three, October twenty-three, No∣vember
eighteen, December two, December fifteen, December nine∣teen,
December twenty-three, December twenty-nine, January sixteen,
which last I have received this day, February 2d. For greater per∣spicuity,
it will not be amiss (on either side) to number our future
epistles, by a conspicuous Roman character inscribed in the front, to
which we may at any time refer. But instead of writing by Ostend,
the shorter and surer way, especially on all occasions that deserve cele∣rity,
will be to inclose them to my banker, M. de Lessart at Paris, who
will forward them to me. Through Germany the passage by sea is
more uncertain, the roads worse, and the distance greater: we
often complain of delay and irregularity at this interesting moment.
By your last I find that you have boldly and generously opened a
treaty with the enemy, which I proposed with fear and hesitation.
I impatiently expect the result; and again repeat, that <HI>whatever</HI> you
can obtain for * * *, I shall consider it as so much saved
out of the fire, &amp;c. &amp;c. Do you remember Dunning's motion (in
the year 1780) to address the Crown against a dissolution of Par∣liament;
a simple address we rejected, as an infringement on the
prerogative? yet how far short of these strong democratical mea∣sures,
for which you have probably voted, as I should probably have
done: such is the contagion of party. Fox drives most furiously,
yet I should not be surprised if Pitt's moderation and character
should insensibly win the nation, and even the House, to espouse
his cause. * * *
Unless when I look back on England with a selfish or a tender re∣gard,
my hours roll away very pleasantly, and I can again repeat
with truth, that I have not regretted one single moment the step
which I have taken. We are now at the height of the winter
dissipation, and I am peculiarly happy when I can steal away from
<PB N="628" REF="649"/>
great assemblies, and suppers of twenty or thirty people, to a more
private party of some of those persons whom I begin to call my
friends. Till we are settled in our house little can be expected on
our side; yet I have already given two or three handsome dinners;
and though every thing is grown dearer, I am not alarmed at the
general view of my expence. Deyverdun salutes you; and we are
agreed that few married couples are better entitled to the flitch of
bacon than we shall be at the end of the year. When I had written
about half this epistle my books arrived: at our first meeting all was
rapture and confusion, and two or three posts, from the second to
this day, the fourteenth, have been suffered to depart unnoticed.
Your letter of the twenty-seventh of January, which was not re∣ceived
till yesterday, has again awakened me, and I thought the
surest way would be to send off this single sheet without any farther
delay.</P>
<P>I sincerely rejoice in the stability of Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This supposition was founded on Mr. Banks's declaration in the name of Mr. Pitt.</NOTE>; and the first
faint dawn of reconciliation, which must however be effected by
the equal balance of parties, rather than by the wisdom of the
country gentlemen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At the St. Alban's Tavern.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>My Lady!—But it would be highly incongruous to begin my
letter at the bottom of the page. Adieu, therefore, till next post.</P>

<P>ALAS! alas! alas! We may now exchange our mutual condo∣lence.
Last Christmas, on the change of administration, I was
struck with the thunderbolt of the unexpected event, and in the ap∣proaching
<PB N="629" REF="650"/>
dissolution I soresaw the loss of * * *.
The long continuance and various changes
of the tempest rendered me by degrees callous and insensible; when
the art of the mariners was exhausted I felt that we were sinking▪
I expected the ship to founder, and when the fatal moment arrived,
I was even pleased to be delivered from hope and fear, to the calm∣ness
of despair. I now turn my eyes, not on the past, but on the
present and the future; what is lost I try to consider as if it never
had existed; and every day I congratulate my own good fortune,
let me say my prudence and resolution, in migrating from your noisy
stage to a scene of repose and content. But even in this separate
state, I was still anxious for my friend upon English earth, and at
first was much delighted with your hint, that you were setting off
for Coventry, without any prospect of an opposition. Every post,
Wednesdays and Saturdays, I eagerly looked for the intelligence of
your victory; and in spite of my misbehaviour, which I do not
deny, I must abuse <HI>my Lady,</HI> rather than you, for leaving me in so
painful a situation. Each day raised and increased my apprehension;
the <HI>Courier de l' Europe</HI> first announced the contest, the English papers
proclaimed your defeat, and your last letter, which I received four
days ago, shewed me that you exerted first the spirit, and at last the
temper of an hero. I am not much surprised that you should have
been swept away in the general unpopularity, since even in this
quiet place, your friends are considered as a factious crew, acting in
direct opposition both to the King and people. For yourself I am
at a loss what to say. If this repulse should teach you to renounce
all connection with Kings and Ministers, and Patriots and Parties,
and Parliaments; for all of which you are by many degrees too
honest; I should exclaim, with Teague of respectable memory,
<Q>By my shoul, dear joy, you have <HI>gained</HI> a loss.</Q> Private life,
whether contemplative or active, has surely more solid and inde∣pendent
charms; you have <HI>some</HI> domestic comforts; Sheffield-Place
<PB N="630" REF="651"/>
is still susceptible of useful and ornamental improvements, (alas!
how much better might even the last * * * have been laid out!)
and if these cares are not sufficient to occupy your leisure, I can
trust your restless and enterprising spirit to find new methods to pre∣serve
you from the insipidity of repose. But I much fear your dis∣content
and regret at being excluded from that Pandaemonium which
we have so often cursed, as long as you were obliged to attend it.
The leaders of the party will flatter you with the opinion of their
friendship and your own importance; the warmith of your temper
makes you credulous and unsuspicious; and, like the rest of our
species, male and female, you are not absolutely deaf to the voice of
praise. Some other place will be suggested, easy, honourable, cer∣tain,
where nothing is wanted but a man of character and spirit to
head a superior interest; the opposition, if any, is contemptible, and
the expence cannot be large. You will go down, find almost every
circumstance falsely stated, repent that you had engaged yourself,
but you cannot desert those friends who are firmly attached to your
cause; besides, the money you have already spent would have been
thrown away; another thousand will complete the business: deeper
and deeper will you plunge, and the last evil will be worse than the
first. You see I am a free-spoken counsellor; may I not be a true
prophet! Did I consult my own wishes, I should observe to you,
that as you are no longer a slave, you might soon be transported, as
you seem to desire, to one of the Alpine hills. The purity and
calmness of the air is the best calculated to allay the heat of a poli∣tical
fever; the education of the two Princesses might be successfully
conducted under your eye and that of my Lady; and if you had
resolution to determine on a residence, not a visit, at Lausanne, your
worldly affairs might repose themselves after their late fatigues. But
you know that <HI>I</HI> am a friend to toleration, and am always disposed to
make the largest allowance for the different natures of animals; a lion
and a lamb, an eagle and a worm. I am afraid we are too quiet for
<PB N="631" REF="652"/>
you; here it would not be easy for you to create any business; you
have for some time neglected books, and I doubt whether you would
not think our suppers and assemblies somewhat trifling and insipid.
You are far more difficult than I am; you are in search of knowledge,
and you are not content with your company, unless you can derive
from them information or extraordinary amusement. For my part,
I like to draw information from books, and I am satisfied with
polite attention and easy manners. Finally, I am happy to tell, and
you will be happy to hear, that this place has in every respect ex∣ceeded
my best and most sanguine hopes. How often have you
said, as often as I expressed any ill-humour against the hurry, the
expence, and the precarious condition of my London life, <Q>Ay,
that is a nonsensical scheme of retiring to Lausanne that you have
got into your head, a pretty fancy; you remember how much you
liked it in your youth, but you have now seen more of the world,
and if you were to try it again, you would find yourself woefully
disappointed?</Q> I had it in my head, in my heart, I have tried it,
I have not been disappointed, and my knowledge of the world has
served only to convince me, that a capital and a crowd may contain
much less real society, than the small circle of this gentle retirement.
The winter has been longer, but, as far as I can learn, less rigorous
than in the rest of Europe. The spring is now bursting upon us,
and in our own garden it is displayed in all its glory. I already oc∣cupy
a temporary apartment, and we live in the lower part of the
house; before you receive this we shall be in full possession. We
have much to enjoy and something to do, which I take to be the
happiest condition of human life. Now for business, the kind of
subject which I always undertake with the most reluctance, and leave
with the most pleasure. * * *
Adieu.</P>
<P><PB N="632" REF="653"/>
And now, my Lady,</P>
<P>LET me approach your gentle, not grimalkin, presence, with
deep remorse. You have indirectly been informed of my state of
mind and body; (the whole winter I have not had the slightest re∣turn
of the gout, or any other complaint whatsoever;) you have
been apprised, and are now apprised, of my motions, or rather of
my perfect and agreeable repose; yet I must confess (and I <HI>feel</HI>)
that something of a direct and personal exchange of sentiment has
been neglected on my side, though I still <HI>persuade</HI> myself that when
I am settled in my new house I shall have more subject, as well
as leisure, to write. Such tricks of laziness your active spirit is
a stranger to, though Mrs. * * * complains that she has never
had an answer to her last letters. Poor Lady Pembroke! <HI>you</HI> will
feel for her; after a cruel alternative of hope and fear, her only
daughter, Lady Charlotte, died at <HI>Aix en Provence;</HI> they have per∣suaded
her to come to this place, where she is intimately connected
with the Cerjat family. She has taken an agreeable house, about
three miles from the town, and lives retired. I have seen her; her
behaviour is calm, but her affliction—. I accept with gratitude
your friendly proposal of Wedgewood's ware, and should be glad to
have it bought and packed, and sent without delay through Ger∣many;
and I shall only say, that I wish to have a very complete
service for two courses and a desert, and that our suppers are nu∣merous,
frequently fifteen or twenty persons. Adieu. I do not
mean this as your letter. You are very good to poor Kitty. With
you I do not condole about Coventry.</P>

I have often wondered why we are not fonder of letter-writing.
We all delight to talk of ourselves, and it is only in letters,
in writing to a friend, that we can enjoy that conversation, not only
without reproach or interruption, but with the highest propriety
and mutual satisfaction; sure that the person whom we address feels
an equal, or at least a strong and lively interest in the consideration
of the pleasing subject. On the subject therefore of <HI>self</HI> I will en∣tertain
a friend, to whom none of my thoughts or actions, none of
my pains or pleasures, can ever be indifferent. When I first che∣rished
the design of retiring to Lausanne, I was much more appre∣hensive
of wounding your tender attachment, than of offending
Lord Sheffield's manly and vehement friendship. In the abolition
of the Board of Trade the motives for my retreat became more
urgent and forcible; I wished to break loose, yet I delayed above a
year before I could take my final resolution; and the letter in which
I disclosed it to you cost me one of the most painful struggles of my
life. As soon as I had conquered that difficulty, all meaner obstacles
fell before me, and in a few weeks I found myself at Lausanne,
astonished at my firmness and my success. Perhaps you still blame
or still lament the step which I have taken. If on your own ac∣count,
I can only sympathize with your feelings, the recollection
of which often costs me a sigh: if on mine, let me fairly state what
<PB N="634" REF="655"/>
I have escaped in England, and what I have found at Lausanne.
Recollect the tempests of this winter, how many anxious days I
should have passed, how many noisy, turbulent, hot, unwholesome
nights, while my political existence, and that of my friends, was at
stake; yet these feeble efforts would have been unavailing; I should
have lost my seat in parliament, and after the extraordinary expence of
another year, I must still have pursued the road of Switzerland, unless
I had been tempted by some selfish patron, or by Lord S.'s aspiring
spirit, to incur a most inconvenient expence for a new seat; and
once more, at the beginning of an opposition, to engage in new
scenes of business. As to the immediate prospect of any thing like
a quiet and profitable retreat, I should not know where to look; my
friends are no longer in power. With * * * and his party I
have no connection; and were he disposed to favour a man of
letters, it is difficult to say what he could give, or what I would ac∣cept;
the reign of pensions and sinecures is at an end, and a com∣mission
in the Excise or Customs, the summit of my hopes, would
give me income at the expence of leisure and liberty. When I re∣volve
these circumstances in my mind, my only regret, I repeat it
again and again, is, that I did not embrace this salutary measure
three, five, ten years ago. Thus much I thought it necessary to
say, and shall now dismiss this unpleasing part of the subject.
For my situation here, health is the first consideration; and on that
head your tenderness had conceived some degree of anxiety. I
know not whether it has reached you that I had a sit of the gout
the day after my arrival. The deed is true, but the cause was acci∣dental;
carelessly stepping down a flight of stairs, I sprained my
ancle; and my ungenerous enemy instantly took advantage of my
weakness. But since my breaking that double chain, I have enjoyed
a winter of the most perfect health that I have perhaps ever known,
without any mixture of the little flying incommodities which in my
best days have sometimes disturbed the tranquillity of my English
<PB N="635" REF="656"/>
life. You are not ignorant of Dr. Tissot's reputation, and his merit
is even above his reputation. He assures me, that in his opinion, the
moisture of England and Holland is most pernicious; the dry pure
air of Switzerland most favourable to a gouty constitution: that ex∣perience
justifies the theory; and that there are fewer martyrs of that
disorder in this, than in any other country in Europe. This winter
has every where been most uncommonly severe: and you seem in
England to have had your full share of the general hardship: but in
this corner, surrounded by the Alps, it has rather been long than
rigorous; and its duration stole away our spring, and left us no
interval between furs and silks. We now enjoy the genial influence
of the climate and the season; and no station was ever more calcu∣lated
to enjoy them than Deyverdun's house and garden, which are
now become my own. You will not expect that the pen should de∣scribe
what the pencil would imperfectly delineate. A few circum∣sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, however, be mentioned. My library is about the same
size <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in Bentinck-street, with this difference, however, that
instead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>king on a paved court, twelve feet square, I command
a boundles prospect of vale, mountain, and water, from my three
windows. My apartment is completed by a spacious light closet, or
store-room, with a bed-chamber and dressing-room. Deyverdun's
habitation is pleasant and convenient, though less extensive: for our
common use we have a very handsome winter apartment of four
rooms; and on the ground-floor, two cool saloons for the summer,
with a sufficiency, or rather superfluity, of offices, &amp;c. A terrace,
one hundred yards long, extends beyond the front of the house, and
leads to a close impenetrable shrubbery; and from thence the circuit
of a long and various walk carries me round a meadow and vine∣yard.
The intervals afford abundant supply of fruit, and every sort
of vegetables; and if you add, that this villa (which has been much
ornamented by my friend) touches the best and most sociable part of
the town, you will agree with me, that few persons, either princes
<PB N="636" REF="657"/>
or philosophers, enjoy a more desirable residence. Deyverdun,
who is proud of his own works, often walks me round, pointing out,
with acknowledgment and enthusiasm, the beauties that change with
every step and with every variation of light. I share, or at least I sym∣pathize
with his pleasure. He appears contented with my progress,
and has already told several people, that he does not despair of making
me a gardener. Be that as it may, you will be glad to hear that I am,
by my own choice, infinitely more in motion, and in the open air,
than I ever have been formerly; yet my perfect liberty and leisure
leave me many studious hours; and as the circle of our acquaintance
retire into the country, I shall be much less engaged in company and
diversion. I have seriously resumed the prosecution of my History;
each day and each month adds something to the completion of the
great work. The progress is slow, the labour continual, and the
end remote and uncertain; yet every day brings its amusement, as
well as labour; and though I dare not fix a term, even in my own
fancy, I advance, with the pleasing reflection, that the business of pub∣lication
(should I be detained here so long) must enforce my return
to England, and restore me to the best of mothers and friends. In
the mean while, with health and competence, a full independence of
mind and action, a delightful habitation, a true friend, and many
pleasant acquaintance; you will allow, that I am rather an object of
envy than of pity; and if you were more conversant with the use of the
French language, I would seriously propose to you to repose yourself
with us in this fine country. My indirect intelligence (on which
I sometimes depend with more implicit faith than on the kind dissimu∣lation
of your friendship) gives me reason to hope that the last winter
has been more favourable to your health than the preceding one.
Assure me of it yourself honestly and truly, and you will afford me
one of the most lively pleasures.</P>

<P>SINCE my retreat to Lausanne our correspondence has never re∣ceived
so long an interruption; and as I have been equally taci∣turn
with the rest of the English world, it may now be a problem
among that sceptical nation, whether the Historian of the Decline
and Fall be a living substance or an empty name. So tremendous
is the sleepy power of laziness and habit, that the silence of each
post operated still more strongly to benumb the hand, and to freeze the
<HI>epistolary</HI> ink. How or when I should have naturally awakened, I can∣not
<PB N="638" REF="659"/>
tell; but the pressure of my affairs, and the arrival of your last
letter, compel me to remember that you are entrusted with the final
amputation of the best limb of my property. The subject is in
itself so painful, that I have postponed it, like a child's physic, from
day to day; and losing whole mornings, as I walked about my
library, in useless regret and impotent resolution, you will be amazed
to hear that (after peeping to see if you are all well, and returned
from Ireland) I have not yet had the courage to peruse your letter,
for fear of meeting with some gloomy intelligence; and I will now
finish what I have to say of pecuniary matters, before I know whe∣ther
its contents will fortify or overthrow my unbiassed sentiments.
* * *
To what purpose (will you say) are these
tardy and useless repinings? To arraign your manager? No, I am
satisfied with the skill and firmness of the pilot, and complain only
of the untoward violence of the tempest. To repent of your re∣treat
into Switzerland? No, surely, every subsequent event has
tended to make it as necessary as it has proved agreeable. Why
then these lamentations? Hear and attend—It is to interest (if
possible more strongly) your zeal and friendship, to justify a sort of
avarice, a love of money, very soreign to my character, but with
which I cling to these last fragments of my fortune. * * *
As far as I can judge from the experience of a year, though I find
Lausanne much more expensive than I imagined, yet my stile of
living (and a very handsome stile it is) will be brought <HI>nearly</HI> within
my ordinary revenues. I wish our poor country could say as much!
But it was always my favourite and rational wish, that at the wind∣ing
up of my affairs I might possess a sum, from one to two thou∣sand
pounds, neither buried in land, nor locked up in the funds, but
free, light, and ready to obey any call of interest, or pleasure, or
virtue; to defray any extraordinary expence, support any delay, or
<PB N="639" REF="660"/>
remove any obstacle. For the attainment of this object, I trust in
your assistance. * * *
Thus much for this
money transaction; to you I need add no other stimulative, than
to say that my ease and comfort very much depend on the success of
this plan.</P>
<P>As I thought every man of sense and fortune in Ireland must be
satisfied, I did not conceive the cloud so dark as you represent it.
I will seriously peruse the 8vo. and in due time the 4to. edi∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of Observations on the Commerce with the American States.</NOTE>.
it would become a classic book, if you could find leisure
(will you ever find it?) to introduce order and ornament. You
must negociate <HI>directly</HI> with Deyverdun; but the state will not hear
of parting with their only Reynolds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Alluding to his portrait.</NOTE> I embrace my Lady; let
her be angry, provided she be well. Adieu. Yours.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> The care of Ireland may have amused you in the summer;
but how do you mean to employ the winter? Do you not cast a long∣ing,
lingering look at St. Stephen's chapel? With your fiery spirit,
and firm judgment, I almost wish you there; not for your benefit,
but for the public. If you resolve to recover your seat, do not
listen to any fallacious and infinite projects of interest, contest, re∣turn,
petition, &amp;c. but limit your expence.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>October 22d, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A FEW weeks ago, as I was walking on our terrace with M. Tissot,
the celebrated physician; M. Mercier, the author of the <HI>Tableau
de Paris;</HI> the Abbé Raynal; Monsieur, Madame, and Mademoiselle
<PB N="640" REF="661"/>
Necker; the Abbé de Bourbon, a natural son of Lewis the Fifteenth,
the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, Prince Henry of Prussia, and a
dozen Counts, Barons, and extraordinary persons, among whom was
a natural son of the Empress of Russia—Are you satisfied with this
lift? which I could enlarge and embellish, without departing from
truth; and was not the Baron of Sheffield (profound as he is on
the subject of the American trade) doubly mistaken with regard to
Gibbon and Lausanne? Whenever I used to hint my design of retir∣ing,
that illustrious Baron, after a proper effusion of d—d fools,
condescended to observe, that such an obscure nook in Switzerland
might please me in the ignorance of youth, but that after tasting for
so many years the various society of Paris and London, I should
soon be tired with the dull and uniform round of a provincial town.
In the winter, Lausanne is indeed reduced to its native powers; but
during the summer, it is possibly, after Spa, one of the most fa∣vourite
places of general resort. The tour of Switzerland, the Alps,
and the Glaciers, is become a fashion. Tissot attracts the invalids,
especially from France; and a colony of English have taken up the
habit of spending their winters at Nice, and their summers in the
Pays de Vaud. Such are the splendour and variety of our summer
visitors; and <HI>you</HI> will agree with me more readily than the Baron,
when I say that this variety, instead of being a merit, is, in my
opinion, one of the very few objections to the residence of Lau∣sanne.
After the dissipation of the winter I expected to have en∣joyed,
with more freedom and solitude, myself, my friend, my
books, and this delicious paradise; but my position and character
make me here a sort of a public character, and oblige me to see and
be seen. However, it is my firm resolution for next summer to
assume the independence of a philosopher, and to be visible only to the
persons whom I like. On the principle I should not, most assuredly,
have avoided the Neckers and Prince Henry. The former have
purchased the barony of Copet near Geneva; and as the buildings
<PB N="641" REF="662"/>
were very much out of repair, they passed this summer at a country∣house
at the gates of Lausanne. They afford a new example, that
persons who have tasted of greatness can seldom return with plea∣sure
to a private station. In the moments when we were alone he
conversed with me freely, and I believe truly, on the subject of his
administration and fall; and has opened several passages of modern
history, which would make a very good figure in <HI>the</HI> American
book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observation on the Commerce with the American States.</NOTE> If they spent the summers at the castle of Copet, about
nine leagues from hence, a fortnight or three weeks visit would be a
pleasant and healthful excursion; but, alas! I fear there is little ap∣pearance
of its being executed. <HI>Her</HI> health is impaired by the agi∣tation
of her mind: instead of returning to Paris, she is ordered to
pass the winter in the southern provinces of France, and our last
parting was solemn; as I very much doubt whether I shall ever
see her again. They have now a very troublesome charge, which
you will exeprience in a few years, the disposal of a Baroness; Ma∣demoiselle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Now Madame de Staal.</NOTE>
Necker, one of the greatest heiresses in Europe, is now
about eighteen, wild, vain, but good-natured, and with a much larger
provision of wit than of beauty: what increases their difficulties is
their religious obstinacy of marrying her only to a protestant. It
would be an excellent opportunity for a young Englishman of a great
name and a fair reputation. Prince Henry must be a man of sense;
for he took more notice, and expressed more esteem for me, than
any body else. He is certainly (without touching his military
character) a very lively and entertaining companion. He talked
with freedom, and generally with contempt, of most of the princes
of Europe; with respect of the Empress of Russia, but never men∣tioned
the name of his brother, except once, when he hinted that
it was <HI>he himself</HI> that won the battle of Rosbach. His nephew, and
<PB N="642" REF="663"/>
our nephew, the hereditary Prince of Brunswick is here for his edu∣cation.
Of the English, who live very much as a national colony,
you will like to hear of Mrs. Fraser and <HI>one</HI> more. Donna Cathe∣rian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Mrs. Fraser.</NOTE>
pleases every body, by the perfect simplicity of her state of
nature. You know she has had resolution to return from England
(where she told me she saw you) to Lausanne, for the sake of Miss
Bristow, who is in bad health, and in a few days they set off for
Nice. <HI>The other</HI> is the Eliza; she passed through Lausanne, in her
road from Italy to England; poorly in health, but still adorable,
(nay, do not frown!) and I enjoyed some delightful hours by her
bed-side. She wrote me a line from Paris, but has not executed her
promise of visiting Lausanne in the month of October. My pen
has run much faster, and much farther, than I intended on the sub∣ject
of other; yet, in describing them, I have thrown some light
over myself and my situation. A year, a very short one, has now
clapsed since my arrival at Lausanne; and after a cool review of my
sentiments, I can sincerely declare, that I have never, during a single
moment, repented of having executed my <HI>obsurd</HI> project of retiring to
Lausanne. It is needless to dwell on the fatigue, the hurry, the vexa∣tion
which I must have felt in the narrow and dirty circle of English
politics. My present life wants no foil, and shines by its own na∣tive
light. The chosen part of my library is now arrived, and ar∣ranged
in a room full as good as that in Bentinck-street, with this
difference indeed, that instead of looking on a stone court, twelve
feet square, I command, from three windows of plate-glass, an un∣bounded
prospect of many a league of vineyard, of fields, of wood,
of lake, and of mountains; a scene which Lord Sheffield will tell
you is superior to all you can imagine. The climate, though severe
in winter, has perfectly agreed with my constitution, and the year
is accomplished without any return of the gout. An excellent
<PB N="643" REF="664"/>
house, a good table, a pleasant garden, are no contemptible ingre∣dients
in human happiness. The general style of society hits my
sancy; I have cultivated a large and agrecable circle of acquaintance,
and I am much deceived if I have not laid the foundations of two
or three more intimate and valuable connections; but their names
would be indifferent, and it would require pages, or rather volumes,
to describe their persons and characters. With regard to my stand∣ing
dish, my domestic friend, I could not be much disappointed,
after an intimacy of eight-and-twenty years. His heart and his
head are excellent; he has the warmest attachment for me, he is sa∣tisfied
that I have the same for him: some slight imperfections must be
mutually supported; two bachelors, who have lived so long alone and
independent, have their peculiar fancies and humours, and when the
mask of form and ceremony is laid aside, every moment in a family-life
has not the sweetness of the honey-moon, even between the
husbands and wives who have the truest and most tender regard for
each other. Should you be very much surprised to hear of my
being married? Amazing as it may seem, I do assure you that the
event is less improbable than it would have appeared to myself a
twelvemonth ago. Deyverdun and I have often agreed, in jest and
in earnest, that a house like ours would be regulated, and graced,
and enlivened, by an agreeable female companion; but each of us
seems desirous that his friend should sacrifice himself for the public
good. Since my residence here I have lived much in women's com∣pany;
and, to your credit be it spoken, I like you the better the
more I see of you. Not that I am in love with any particular per∣son.
I have discovered about half-a-dozen <HI>wives</HI> who would please
me in different ways, and by various merits: one as a mistress (a
widow, vastly like <HI>the</HI> Eliza; if she returns I am to bring them to∣gether);
a second, a lively entertaining acquaintance; a third, a sin∣cere
good-natured friend; a fourth, who would represent with grace
and dignity at the head of my table and family; a fifth, an excel∣lent
<PB N="644" REF="665"/>
oeconomist and housekeeper; and a sixth, a very useful nurse.
Could I find all these qualities united in a single person, I should dare
to make my addresses, and should deserve to be refused. You hint in
some of your letters, or rather postscripts, that you consider me as
having renounced England, and having sixed myself for the rest of
my life in Switzerland, and that you suspect the sincerity of my
vague or insidious schemes of purchase or return. To remove, as
far as I can, your doubts and suspicions, I will tell you, on that in∣teresting
subject, fairly and simply as much as I know of my own
intentions. There is little appearance that I shall be suddenly re∣called
by the offer of a place or pension. I have no claim to the
friendship of your young minister, and should he propose a Com∣missioner
of the Customs, or Secretary at Paris, the supposed ob∣jects
of my low ambition, Adam in Paradise would refuse them with
contempt. <HI>Here</HI> therefore I shall certainly live till I have finished
the remainder of my History; an arduous work, which does not
proceed so fast as I expected, amidst the avocations of society, and
miscellaneous study. As soon as it is completed, most probably in
three or <HI>four</HI> years, I shall infallibly return to England, about the
month of May or June; and the necessary labour of printing with
care two or three quarto volumes, will detain me till their publi∣cation,
in the ensuing spring. Lord Sheffield and yourself will be
the loadstone that most forcibly attracts me; and as I shall be a va∣gabond
on the face of the earth, I shall be the better qualified to
domesticate myself with you, both in town and country. Here
then, at no very extravagant distance, we have the certainty (if we
live) of spending a year together, in the peace and freedom of a
friendly intercourse; and a year is no very contemptible portion of
this mortal existence. Beyond that period all is dark, but not
gloomy. Whether, after the final completion of my History, I
shall return to Lausanne, or settle in England, must depend on a
thousand events which lie beyond the reach of human foresight, the
<PB N="645" REF="666"/>
state of public and private affairs, my own health, the health and
life of Deyverdun, the various changes which may have rendered
Lausanne more dear, or less agreeable, to me than at present. But
without losing ourselves in this distant futurity, which perhaps we
may never see, and without giving any positive answer to Maria's
parting question, whether I shall be buried in England or Switzer∣land,
let me seriously and earnestly ask you, whether you do not
mean to visit me next summer? The defeat at Coventry would, I
should think, facilitate the project; since the Baron is no longer de∣tained
the whole winter from his domestic affairs, nor is there any
attendance on the House that keeps him till Midsummer in dust and
dispute. I can send you a pleasant route, through Normandy, Paris,
and Lyons, a visit to the Glaciers, and your return down the Rhine,
which would be commodiously executed in three or four months, at
no very extravagant expence, and would be productive of health
and spirits to you, of entertainment to you both, and of instruction
to <HI>the</HI> Maria. Without the smallest inconvenience to myself, I am
able to lodge yourselves and family, by arranging you in the winter
apartment, which in the summer season is not of any use to us. I
think you will be satisfied with your habitation, and already see you
in your dressing-room; a small pleasant room, with a delightful
prospect to the west and south. If poor aunt Kitty (you oblige me
beyond expression by your tender care of that excellent woman) if
she were only ten years younger, I would desire you to take her
with you, but I much fear we shall never meet again. You will
not complain of the brevity of this epistle; I expect, in return, a
full and fair account of yourself, your thoughts and actions, soul
and body, present and future, in the safe, though unreserved, con∣fidence
of friendship. The Baron in two words hinted but an in∣different
account of your health; you are a fine machine; but as he
was absent in Ireland, I hope I understand the cause and the remedy.
<PB N="646" REF="667"/>
Next to yourself, I want to hear of the two Baronesses. You must
give me a faithful picture (and though a mother you can give it)
of their present external and internal forms; for a year has now
elapsed, and in <HI>their</HI> lives a year is an age. Adieu. Ever yours.</P>

<P>MY long silence (and it has been long) must not, on this occasion,
be imputed to laziness, though that little devil may likewise
have been busy. But you cannot forget how many weeks I re∣mained
in suspence, expecting every post the final sentence, and not
knowing what to say in that passive uncertainty. It is now some∣thing
more than a fortnight since your last letter, and that of Gosling
informed me of the event. I have intended every day to write, and
every day I have started back with reluctance and disgust, from the
consideration of the wretched subject. Lenborough irrecoverably
gone, for three-fourths of its real, at least of its ancient, value; my
seat in parliament sunk in the abyss of your cursed politics, and a
balance neatly cyphered and summed by Gosling, which shews me
a very shallow purse, in which others have a clearer right to dip
than myself.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>March 21st.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Another week is now elapsed, and though nothing is changed in
this too faithful state of my affairs, I feel myself able to encounter
them with more spirit and resolution; to look on the future, rather
than the past, on the fair, rather than on the foul side of the pro∣spect.
I shall speak in the confidence of friendship, and while you
listen to the more doleful tale of my wants and wishes, you will
<PB N="647" REF="668"/>
have the satisfaction of hearing some circumstances in my present
situation of a less unpleasing nature. 1. In the first place, I most
heartily rejoice in the sale, however unfavourable, of the Bucks
estate. Considering the dullness of the times, and the high interest
of money, it is not a little to obtain even a tolerable price, and I am
sensible how much your patience and industry have been exercised
to extort the payment. 2. Your resistance to my Swiss expedition
was more friendly than wise. Had I yielded, after eighteen months
of suspence and anxiety, I should now, a still poorer man, be driven
to embrace the same resource, which has succeeded according to, or
even beyond, my most sanguine expectations. I do not pretend to
have discovered the terrestrial paradise, which has not been known
in this world since the fall of Adam; but I can truly declare, (now
the charms of novelty are long since faded,) that I have found the
plan of life the best adapted to my temper and my situation. I am
now writing to you in a room as good as that in Bentinck-street,
which commands the country, the lake, and the moun∣tains,
and the opening prospect of the spring. The aforesaid
room is furnished without magnificence, but with every conve∣niency
for warmth, ease, and study, and the walls are already
covered with more than two thousand volumes, the choice of a
chosen library. I have health, friends, an amusing society, and
perfect freedom. A Commissioner of the Excise! the idea makes me
sick. If you ask me what I have saved by my retreat to Lausanne?
I will fairly tell you (in the two great articles of a carriage and a
house in town, both which were indispensable, and are now anni∣hilated,
with the difference of clubs, public places, servants wages,
&amp;c.) about four hundred pounds, or guineas, a year; no inconsider∣able
sum, when it must be annually found as addition to an expence
which is somewhat larger than my present revenue. 3. <HI>What is then,
you will ask, my present-establishment? This</HI> is not by any means a
cheap country; and, except in the article of wine, I could give a
<PB N="648" REF="669"/>
dinner, or make a coat, perhaps for the same price in London as at
Lausanne. My chief advantage arises from the things which I do
not want; and in some respects my style of living is enlarged by the
increase of my relative importance, an obscure bachelor in England,
the master of a considerable house at Lausanne. Here I am expected
to return entertainments, to receive ladies, &amp;c. and to perform
many duties of society, which, though agreeable enough in them∣selves,
contribute to inflame the housekeeper's bills. From the dis∣bursements
of the first year I cannot form any just estimate; the ex∣traordinary
expences of the journey, carriage of heavy goods from
England, the acquisition of many books, which it was not expe∣dient
to transport, the purchase of furniture, wine, fitting up my
library, and the irregularity of a new menage, have consumed a
pretty large sum. But in a quiet, prudent, regular course of life, I
think I can support, myself with comfort and honour for six or seven
hundred pounds a year, instead of a thousand or eleven hundred in
England.</P>
<P>Besides these uncertainties, (uncertain at least as to the time,) I
have a sure and honourable supply from my own pen. I continue
my History with pleasure and assiduity; the way is long and labo∣rious,
yet I see the end, and I can almost promise to land in England
next September twelvemonth, with a manuscript of the current
value of about four thousand pounds, which will afford either a
small income or a large capital. 5. It is in the meanwhile that my
situation is somewhat difficult. * * *
Such are the services and revenues of the year; proceed we now, in
the style of the budget, to the ways and means of extraordinary
supplies. * * *
I will not affront your friendship,
by observing that you will incur little or no risk on this occasion.
Read, consider, act, and write.</P>
<P><PB N="649" REF="670"/>
It is the privilege of friendship to make our friend a patient hearer,
and active associate in our own affairs; and I have now written five
pages on my private affairs, without saying a word either of the pub∣lic,
or of yourself. Of the public I have little to say; I never was a
very warm patriot, and I grow every day a citizen of the world. The
scramble for power or profit at Westminster or St. James's, and the
names of Pitt and Fox, become less interesting to me than those of Caesar
and Pompey. You are not a friend of the young Minister, but he
is a great favourite on the continent, as he appears to be still; and you
must own that the fairness of his character, his eloquence, his ap∣plication
to business, and even his youth, must prepossess at least the
ignorant in his favour. Of the merit or defects of his administra∣tion
I cannot pretend to speak; but I find, from the complaints of
some interested persons, that his restraints on the smuggling of tea
have already ruined the East India Companies of Antwerp and
Sweden, and that even the Dutch will scarcely find it worth their
while to send any ships to China. Your Irish friends appear to be
more quiet, at least the volunteers and national congress seem to
subside. How far that tranquillity must be purchased on our side,
by any pernicious sacrifices, you will best decide; and from some
hint in your last letters, I am inclined to think that you are less af∣fected
than might be supposed with national or local prejudice.
Your introduction I have attentively read; the matter, though most
important in itself, is out of the line of my studies and habits, and
the subordinate beauties of style you disclaim. Yet I can say with
truth, that I never met with more curious and diligent investigation,
more strong sense, more liberal spirit, and more cool and impartial
temper in the same number of pages. By this time you have pro∣bably
read Necker's book on the finances. Perhaps for you there is
too much French enthusiasm and paint; but in many respects you
must have gained a knowledge of his country; and on the whole,
you must have been pleased with the picture of a great and bene∣volent
<PB N="650" REF="671"/>
mind. In your attack on Deyverdun for my picture I cannot
promise you much success; he seems resolved to maintain his right
of possession, and your only chance would be a personal assault. The
next summer (how time slips away!) was fixed for your visit to
Lausanne. We are prepared at all points to receive <HI>you,</HI> my Lady,
and a princess or two, with their train; and if you have a proper
contempt for St. Stephen's chapel, you are perfectly free, and at
leisure (can you ever be at leisure?) for the summer season. As
you are now in a great measure disengaged from any affairs, you
may find time to inform me of your proceedings and your projects.
At present I do not even know whether you pass the winter at Shef∣field-Place
or in Downing-street. My Lady revenges herself of my
long silence; yet I embrace her and the infants. Adieu. You
have deranged the Decline and Fall this morning. I have finished
my epistle since dinner, and am now going to a pleasant party and
good supper.</P>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> CLXXXII. EDWARD GIBBON Esquire to the Right Honourable Lord SHEFFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>September 5th, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EXTRACT from a weekly English Paper, September 5th, 1785.
<Q>It is reported, but we hope without foundation, that the ce∣lebrated
Mr. Gibbon, who had retired to Lausanne in Switzer∣land
to finish his valuable History, lately died in that city.</Q></P>
<P>The hope of the Newspaper-writer is very handsome and obliging
to the Historian; yet there are several weighty reasons which would
incline me to believe that the intelligence may be true. <HI>Primo,</HI> It
must one day be true; and therefore may very probably be so at
present. <HI>Secundo,</HI> We may always depend on the impartiality, ac∣curacy,
and veracity of an English Newspaper. <HI>Tertio,</HI> which is
<PB N="651" REF="672"/>
indeed the strongest argument, We are credibly informed that for a
long time past the said celebrated Historian has not written to any
of his friends in England; and as that respectable personage had
always the reputation of a most exact and regular correspondent, it
may be fairly concluded from his silence, that he either is, or ought
to be dead. The only objection that I can foresee, is the assurance
that Mr. G—himself read the article as he was eating his break∣fast,
and laughed very heartily at the mistake of his brother Histo∣rian;
but as he might be desirous of concealing that unpleasant
event, we shall not insist on his apparent health and spirits, which
might be affected by that subtle politician. He affirms, however,
not only that he is alive, and was so on the fifth of September, but
that his head, his heart, his stomach, are in the most perfect state,
and that the climate of Lausanne has been congenial both to his mind
and body. He confesses indeed, that after the last severe winter, the
gout, his old enemy, from whom he hoped to have escaped, pur∣sued
him to his retreat among the mountains of Helvetia, and that
the siege was long, though more languid than in his precedent at∣tacks;
after some exercise of patience he began to creep, and gra∣dually
to walk; and though he can neither run, nor fly, nor dance,
he supports himself with firmness on his two legs, and would will∣ingly
kick the impertinent Gazetteer; impertinent enough, though
more easily to be forgiven than the insolent <HI>Courier du Bas Rhin,</HI>
who about three years ago amused himself and his readers with a
fictitious epistle from Mr. Gibbon to Dr. Robertson.</P>
<P>Perhaps now you think, Baron, that I shall apologize in humble
style for my silence and neglect. But, on the contrary, I do
assure you that I am truly provoked at your Lordship's not conde∣scending
to be in a passion. I might really have been dead, I might
have been sick; if I were neither dead nor sick, I deserved a volley of
curses and reproaches for my infernal laziness, and you have desrauded
me of my just dues. Had I been silent till Christmas, till dooms∣day,
<PB N="652" REF="673"/>
you would never have thought it worth your while to abuse
me. Why then (let me ask in your name) did you not write be∣fore?
That is indeed a very curious question of natural and moral
philosophy. Certainly I am not lazy; elaborate quartos have proved,
and will abundantly prove my diligence. I <HI>can</HI> write; spare my
modesty on that subject. I like to converse with my friends by pen
or tongue, and as soon as I can set myself a going, I know no mo∣ments
that run off more pleasantly. I am so well convinced of that
truth, so much ashamed of forcing people that I love to forget
me, that I have now resolved to set apart the first hour of each
day for the discharge of my obligations; beginning, <HI>comme de raison,</HI>
with yourself, and regularly proceeding to Lord Loughborough and
the rest. May Heaven give me strength and grace to accomplish
this laudable intention! Amen. Certainly (yet I do not know
whether it be so certain) I should write much oftener to you if we
were not linked in business, and if my business had not always been
of the unpleasant and mortifying kind. Even now I shove the ugly
monster to the end of this epistle, and will confine him to a page by
himself, that he may not infect the purer air of our correspondence.
Of my situation here I have little new to say, except a very comfort∣able
and singular truth, that my passion for my wife or mistress (Fanny
Lausanne) is not palled by satiety and possession of two years. I
have seen her in all seasons, and in all humours, and though she is
not without faults, they are infinitely overbalanced by her good
qualities. Her face is not handsome, but her person, and every
thing about her, has admirable grace and beauty: she is of a very
cheerful sociable temper; without much learning, she is endowed
with taste and good sense; and though not rich, the simplicity of
her education makes her a very good oeconomist; she is forbid by
her parents to wear any expensive finery; and though her limbs are
not much calculated for walking, she has not yet asked me to keep
her a coach. Last spring (not to wear the metaphor to rags) I saw
<PB N="653" REF="674"/>
Lausanne in a new light, during my long fit of the gout, and must
boldly declare, that either in health or sickness I find it far more
comfortable than your huge metropolis. In London my confine∣ment
was sad and solitary; the many forgot my existence when they
saw me no longer at Brookes's; and the few, who sometimes cast a
thought or an eye on their friend, were detained by business or
pleasure, the distance of the way, or the hours of the House of
Commons, and I was proud and happy if I could prevail on Elmsly
to enliven the dulness of the evening. Here the objects are nearer,
and much more distinct, and I myself am an object of much larger
magnitude. People are not kinder, but they are more idle, and it
must be confessed that, of all nations on the globe, the English are
the least attentive to the old and infirm; I do not mean in acts of
charity, but in the offices of civil life. During three months I have
had round my chair a succession of agreeable men and women, who
came with a smile, and vanished at a nod; and as soon as it was agree∣able
I had a constant party at cards, which was sometimes dismissed
to their respective homes, and sometimes detained by Dyverdun to
supper, without the least trouble or inconvenience to myself. In a
word, my plan has most completely answered; and I solemnly pro∣test,
after two years trial, that I have never in a single moment re∣pented
of my transmigration. The only disagreeable circumstance
is the increase of a race of animals with which this country has been
long infested, and who are said to come from an island in the
Northern Ocean. I am told, but it seems incredible, that upwards
of forty thousand English, masters and servants, are now absent on
the continent; and I am sure we have our full proportion, both in
town and country, from the month of June to that of October.
The occupations of the closet, indifferent health, want of horses,
in some measure plead my excuse; yet I do too much to please my∣self,
and probably too little to satisfy my countrymen. What is still
more unlucky is, that a part of the colony of this present year are
<PB N="654" REF="675"/>
really good company, people one knows, &amp;c.; the Astons, Hales,
Hampdens, Trevors, Lady Clarges and Miss Carter, Lord North∣ington,
&amp;c. I have seen Trevor several times, who talks of you, and
seems to be a more exact correspondent than myself. <HI>His wife</HI> is
much improved by her diplomatic life, and shines in every company,
as a woman of fashion and elegance. But those who have repaid
me for the rest, were Lord and Lady Spencer. I saw them almost
every day, at my house or their own, during their stay of a month;
for they were hastening to Italy, that they might return to Lon∣don
next February. He is a valuable man, and where he is fami∣liar,
a pleasant companion; she a charming woman, who, with
sense and spirit, has the simplicity and playfulness of a child. You
are not ignorant of her talents, of which she has left me an
agreeable specimen, a drawing of the Historic Muse, sitting in a
thoughtful posture to compose. So much of self and Co. let us
now talk a little of your house and your two countries. Does my
Lady ever join in the abuse which I have merited from you? Is she
satisfied with her own behaviour, her unpardonable silence, to one of
the prettiest, most obliging, most entertaining, most, &amp;c. epistles
that ever was penned since the epistles of * * *?
Will she not <HI>mew</HI> one word of reply? I want some account of her
spirits, health, amusements, of the elegant accomplishments of Maria,
and the opening graces of Louisa: of yourself I wish to have some
of those details which she is most likely to transmit. Are you patient
in your exclusion from the House? Are you satisfied with legis∣lating
with your pen? Do you pass the whole winter in town?
Have you resumed the pursuits of farming, &amp;c.? What new con∣nections,
public or private, have you formed? A tour to the conti∣nent
would be the best medicine for the shattered nerves of a soldier
and politician. By this expression you will perceive that your letter
to Deyverdun is received; it landed last post, after I had already
written the two first pages of this composition. On the whole my
<PB N="655" REF="676"/>
friend was pleased and flattered; but instead of surrendering, or ca∣pitulating,
he seems to be making preparations for an obstinate de∣fence.
He already talks of the right of possession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His portrait, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds.</NOTE>, of the duties
of a good citizen, of a <HI>writ ue exeat regnum,</HI> and of a vote of the
two hundred, that whomsoever shall, directly or indirectly, &amp;c. is
an enemy to his country. Between you be the strife, while I sit
with my scales in my hand, like Jupiter on Mount Ida. I begin to
view with the same indifference the combat of Achilles Pitt, and Hector
Fox; for such, as it should now seem, must be the comparison of
the two warriors. * * *
At this distance I am much less angry with bills, taxes, and propo∣sitions,
than I am pleased with Pitt for making a friend and a deserv∣ing
man happy, for releasing Batt from the shackles of the law, and
for enhancing the gift of a secure and honourable competency, by
the handsome manner in which it was conferred. This I under∣stand
to be the case, from the unsuspicious evidence of Lord North∣ington
and Chief Baron Skinner; and if I can find time, (<HI>resolution,</HI>)
I will send him a hearty congratulation; if I fail, you may at least
communicate my intentions. Of Ireland I know nothing, and while
I am writing the Decline of a great Empire, I have not leisure to
attend to the affairs of a remote and petty province. I see that your
friend Foster has been hooted by the mob, and unanimously chosen
Speaker of the House of Commons. How could Pitt expose him∣self
to the disgrace of withdrawing his propositions after a public
attempt? Have Ministers no way of computing beforehand the
sense or nonsense of an Irish Parliament? I am quite in the dark;
your pamphlet, or book, would probably have opened my eyes; but,
whatever may have been the reason, I give you <HI>my word of honour,</HI>
that I have never seen nor heard of it. Here we are much more
engaged with continental politics. In general we hate the Emperor,
<PB N="656" REF="677"/>
as the enemy of peace, without daring to make war. The old lion
of Prussia acts a much more glorious part, as the champion of public
tranquillity, and the independence of the German states.</P>
<P>And now for the bitter and nauseous pill of pecuniary business,
upon which I shall be as concise as possible in the two articles of my
discourse, land and money. * * *
It is impossible to hate more than I do this odious necessity of
owing, borrowing, anticipating, and I look forwards with impatience
to the happy period when the supplies will always be raised within
the year, with a decent and useful surplus in the treasury. I now
trust to the conclusion of my History, and it will hasten and secure
the principal comforts of my life. You will believe I am not lazy;
yet I fear the term is somewhat more distant than I thought. My
long gout lost me three months in the spring; in every great work
unforeseen dangers, and difficulties, and delays will arise; and I
should be rather sorry than surprised if next autumn was postponed
to the ensuing spring. If my Lady (a good creature) should write
to Mrs. Porten, she may convey news of my life and health, without
saying any thing of this <HI>possible</HI> delay. Adieu. I embrace, &amp;c.

<P>HEAR, all ye nations! An epistle from Sheffield-Place, received the
seventeenth of January, is answered the same day; and to say
the truth, this method, which is the best, is at the same time the
most easy and pleasant. Yet I do not allow that on the last past
silence and delay you have any more reason to swear than myself.
Our letters crossed each other, our claims were equal, and if both
<PB N="657" REF="678"/>
had been stiffly maintained, our mutual silence must have continued
till the day of judgment. The balance was doubtless in my favour,
if you recollect the length, the fullness, the variety of pleasant and in∣structive
matter of my last dispatch. Even at present, of myself, my
occupations, my designs, I have little or nothing to add; and can
only speak dryly and briefly to very dry and disagreeable business.
* * * But we shall both agree,
that the true criminal is my Lady; and though I do suppose that a
letter is on the road, which will make some amends, her obstinate,
contumacious, dilatory silence, so many months or years since my
valuable letter, is worthy a royal tigress. * * *
Notwithstanding your gloomy politicians, I do love the funds; and
were the next war to reduce them to half, the remainder would be
a better and pleasanter property, than a similar value in your dirty
acres. We are now in the height of our winter amusements; balls,
great suppers, comedies, &amp;c. and, except St. Stephen's, I certainly
lead a more gay and dissipated life here, among the Alps, (by the
bye, a most extraordinary mild winter,) than in the midst of Lon∣don.
Yet my mornings, and sometimes an afternoon, are diligently
employed. My work advances, but much remains, indeed much
more than I imagined; but a great book, like a great house, was
never yet finished at the given time. When I talk of the spring of
eighty-seven, I suppose all my time well bestowed; and what do you
think of a fit of the gout, that may disqualify me for two or three
months? You may growl, but if you calmly reflect on my pecu∣niary
and sentimental state, you will believe that I most earnestly
desire to complete my labour, and <HI>visit</HI> England. Adieu.</P>

<P>BY the difference, I suppose, of the posts of France and Germany,
Sir Stanier's letter, though first written, is still on the road,
and your's, which I received yesterday morning, brought me the
first account of poor Mrs. Porten's departure. There are few events
that could afflict me more deeply, and I have been ever since in a
state of mind more deserving of your pity than of your reproaches. I
certainly am not ignorant that we have nothing better to wish for our∣selves
than the fate of that best-humoured woman, as you very justly
style her; a good understanding and an excellent heart, with health,
spirits, and a competency, to live in the midst of her friends till the
age of fourscore, and then to shut her eyes without pain or remorse.
Death can have deprived her only of some years of weakness, per∣haps
of misery; and for myself, it is surely less painful to lose her
at present, than to find her in my visit to England next year sinking
under the weight of age and infirmities, and perhaps forgetful of
herself and of the persons once the dearest to her. All this is per∣fectly
true: but all these reflections will not dispel a thousand sad
and tender remembrances that rush upon my mind. To her care I
am indebted in earliest infancy for the preservation of my life and
health. I was a puny child, neglected by my mother, starved by
my nurse, and of whose being very little care or expectation was
entertained; without her maternal vigilance I should either have
been in my grave, or imperfectly lived a crooked ricketty monster,
a burden to myself and others. To her instructions I owe the first
rudiments of knowledge, the first exercise of reason, and a taste for
books, which is still the pleasure and glory of my life; and though
she taught me neither language nor science, she was certainly the
<PB N="659" REF="680"/>
most useful preceptor I ever had. As I grew up, an intercourse of
thirty years endeared her to me, as the faithful friend and the agree∣able
companion. You have seen with what freedom and confidence
we lived together, and have often admired her character and conver∣sation,
which could alike please the young and the old. All this is
now lost, finally, irrecoverably lost! I will agree with my Lady,
that the immortality of the soul is at some times a very comfortable
doctrine. A thousand thanks to her for her constant kind attention
to that poor woman who is no more. I wish I had as much to ap∣plaud,
and as little to reproach, in my own behaviour towards Mrs.
Porten since I left England; and when I reflect that my letters would
have soothed and comforted her decline, I feel more deeply than I
can express, the real neglect, and seeming indifference, of my silence.
To delay a letter from the Wednesday to the Saturday, and then
from the Saturday to the Wednesday, appears a very slight offence;
yet in the repetition of such delay, weeks, months, and years will
clapse, till the omission may become irretrievable, and the conse∣quence
mischievous or fatal. After a long lethargy, I had rouzed
myself last week, and wrote to the three old Ladies; my letter for
Mrs. Porten went away last post, Saturday night, and yours did not
arrive till Monday morning. Sir Stanier will probably open it, and
read the true picture of my sentiments for a friend who, when I
wrote, was already extinct. There is something sad and awful in
the thought, yet, on the whole, I am not sorry that even this tardy
epistle preceded my knowledge of her death: but it did not precede
(you will observe) the information of her dangerous and declining
state, which I conveyed in my last letter, and her anxious concern
that she should never see or <HI>hear</HI> from me again. This idea, and
the hard thoughts which you must entertain of me, press so much
on my mind, that I must frankly acknowledge a strange inexcusable
supineness, on which I desire you would make no comment, and
<PB N="660" REF="681"/>
which in some measure may account for my delays in corresponding
with you. The unpleasant nature of business, and the apprehension
of finding something disagreeable, tempted me to postpone from day
to day, not only the answering, but even the opening, your penulti∣mate
epistle; and when I received your last, yesterday morning, the
seal of the former was still unbroken. Oblige me so far as to make
no reflections; my own may be of service to me hereafter. Thus
far (except the last sentence) I have run on with a sort of melan∣choly
pleasure, and find my heart much relieved by unfolding it to
a friend. And the subject so strongly holds me, so much disqualifies
me for other discourse, either serious or pleasant, that here I would
willingly stop, and reserve all miscellaneous matter for a second vo∣lunteer
epistle. But we both know how frail are promises, how
dangerous are delays, and there are some pecuniary objects on which
I think it necessary to give you an immediate, though now tardy,
explanation.</P>
<P>I do not return you any formal thanks for * * *
I have really a hundred things to say of myself, of you and Co. of
your works, of mine, of my books in Downing-street, of Lausanne,
of politics, &amp;c. &amp;c. After this, some epistolary debts must and
SHALL be paid; and to proceed with order, I have fixed this day
fortnight (May twenty-fifth) for the date and dispatch of your se∣cond
epistle. Give me credit once more. Pray does my Lady
think herself absolved from all obligation of writing to me? To
her at least I am not in arrear. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>May 12th, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE melancholy event which you have communicated, in your
last obliging letter of the twenty-fourth of April, might indeed
be too naturally feared and expected. If we consult our reason, we
can wish nothing better for ourselves than the lot of that dear and
valuable friend whom we have now lost<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His aunt, Mrs. Catherine Porten.</NOTE>. A warm heart, a strong
and clear understanding, a most invaluable happiness of temper,
which shewed her the agreeable or comfortable side of every object,
and every situation; an easy competency, the reward of her own
attention; private friendship, general esteem, a mature age, and a
placid decline. But these rational motives of consolation are insuf∣ficient
to check a thousand soft and sad remembrances that rush into
my mind; the intimacy of a whole life; of mine, at least, from the
earliest dawn of my infancy; the maternal and assiduous care of my
health, and afterwards of my mind; the freedom and frequency of
our conversations; the regret which I felt in our last separation, and
the hope, however faint and precarious, of seeing her again. Time
alone can reconcile us to this irreparable loss, and to his healing
power I must recommend your grief, as well as my own. I sin∣cerely
applaud her very proper and natural disposal of her effects,
and am proud of the pre-eminence which she has allowed me in a
list of dear and worthy relations.</P>
<P>I am too full of a single idea to expatiate, as I should otherwise
do, on indifferent matters; yet not totally indifferent to my friends,
since they relate to my present situation. My health is in general
<PB N="662" REF="683"/>
perfectly good, and the only drawbacks some occasional visits of the
gout, which abate, however, in strength, and are grown, I think
less frequent and lasting. The life which I lead is temperate and
tranquil, and the distemper itself is not common in the purity and
dryness of the climate. After a long trial, I can now approve my
own choice of retiring to Switzerland. My delightful habitation, at
once in town and country; my library, and the society of agreeable
men and women, compose a very eligible plan of life, which is
shaded with very few, and very slight exceptions. I prosecute with
ease, and regular diligence, the conclusion of my History; and, as
far as I can judge, I may hope to deliver it to the press in the course
of next year. That important business will recal me to England,
and detain me there some months; and I shall rejoice in the oppor∣tunity
of revisiting my country and my friends; among them those
of Kensington-Palace hold a high and distinguished place.</P>
<P>I truly sympathize, my dear Sir, in your paternal feelings, in the
health and progress of your very promising children. May that,
and every other blessing, attend both yourself and Lady Porten.
My friend M. Deyverdun desires to assure you of his respect and
good wishes. I am, dear Sir, most affectionately yours.</P>

<P>* * *
Since I have another page, and some leisure moments,
we may as well employ it in friendly converse; the more so, as the
great letter to which I alluded is wonderfully precarious and uncer∣tain:
the more so likewise, as our correspondence for some time past
has been of an abrupt and disagreeable cast. Let us first talk of Shef∣field's
<PB N="663" REF="684"/>
works: they are of two sorts: <HI>Primo,</HI> Two nymphs, whom I
much desire to see; the sprightly Maria and the gentle Louisa. I
perfectly represent them both in the eye of fancy; each of them
accomplished according to her age and character, yet totally different
in their external and internal forms. <HI>Secundo,</HI> Three pamphlets;
pamphlets! I cry you mercy; three weighty treatises, almost as
useful as an inquiry into the state of the primitive church. And
here let me justify, if I have not before, my silence on a subject
which we authors do not easily forgive. The first, whose first edi∣tions
had seen the light before I left England, followed me here in
a more complete condition; and that Treatise on the American Trade
has been read, judged, approved, and reported. The second, on
Ireland, I have seen by accident the copy you sent to Mr. Trevor, who
passed last summer (eighty-five) here. The third, and in my pre∣sent
situation the most interesting, on the French Commerce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mistake—Lord Sheffield did not PUBLISH any tract on French Commerce.</NOTE>, I
have not yet seen by any means whatsoever, and you who know
what orders you have given to Elmsly or others, will best discern on
whom should be laid the fault and the blame. By the bye, Mrs.
Trevor is now here, without her husband, and I am just going to
see her, about a mile out of town: she is judged elegant and ami∣able.
But to return to your books, all that I have seen must do you
honour, and might do the public service; you are above the trifling
decorations of style; but your sense is strong, your views im∣partial,
and your industry laudable. I find that your American
Tract is just translated into German. Do you still correspond with
* * *? If he could establish a beneficial intercourse between
the two first nations in the world, I would excuse him some little
political tergiversation. At some distance of time and place, those
domestic squabbles loss much of their importance; and though I
should not forgive him any breach of private friendship or confi∣dence,
<PB N="664" REF="685"/>
I cannot much blame him if he chose rather to serve his fa∣mily
and his country, than to persevere in a hopeless and, as I sus∣pect,
an unpopular opposition. You have never told me clearly
and correctly how you support your inactive retreat from the House
of Commons; whether you have resumed your long forgotten taste
for rural and domestic pleasures, and whether you have never cast a
look towards Coventry, or some other borough equally pure and
respectable. In the short space that is left I will only repeat more
distinctly, that in the present contemplation of my work, June or
July of next year is the earliest term at which I can hope to see Eng∣land;
and if I have a fit of the gout? I have indeed been free from
the monster this last twelvemonth; but he is most arbitrary and ca∣pricious.
Of my own situation let me say with truth that it is tran∣quil,
easy, and well adapted to my character. All enthusiasm is
now at an end; I see things in their true light, and I applaud the
judgment and choice of my retirement. I am well, happy, and
diligent; but your kind hint of the London house is perfectly super∣fluous;
as instead of the <HI>spring,</HI> we must already read the <HI>summer</HI> of
next year. Do not be childish or passionate; trust me, I wish to
appear in England; but it must be with my book in my hand; and
a book takes more time in making than a pudding. Adieu. Will
my Lady never write?</P>
<P>You see why I have left a blank in the first page; and when I
begun I had no design of going beyond it; and now, unless I have
some extraordinary fit of diligence and zeal, shall probably wait till
the return of your epistle. A word before we part, about the least
unpleasant of my business; my library in Downing-street. Excuse
the accidental derangement; I shall send for no more books, and
only beg you to give them shelter in your uninhabited parlour till
my arrival. Two or three mornings will suffice for personal review,
and the subsequent steps of sale or travel will most properly be exe∣cuted
under my own eye. Once more adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>December 16th, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter this morning (the 16th instant), and an∣swer
it the same day. I am a sad correspondent, but it has been
my constant endeavour that my negligence should never affect the
interest or happiness of my friends.</P>
<P>The report you so kindly mention is somewhat incorrect. I
never could fix a particular day for dining with Lord Sheffield, nor
should I think of performing the journey in the winter month of
February. The last autumn was the term which I had fixed in my
hopes, and long since in my letters to him. It has been changed
to next spring, and by the spring I must now understand the
middle of the summer, which I can at present ascertain with some
confidence, from a nearer prospect of the end of my work, which I
shall bring over for the press. It will consist of three more quarto
volumes, somewhat thinner, perhaps, than their predecessors; but as
that difference cannot be enough to affect the price, it will be so
much saved on the author's pains, and the printer's expences. I am
happy to understand the public entertain the same opinion of the
past, and the same impatience for the remainder; and, unless I am
strangely deceived, their expectation will not be disappointed. The
three last volumes are laboured at least with equal diligence; they
contain a longer period of time, and a far greater variety of events;
and the whole will comprise a general series of history, from the
reign of Trajan and the Antonines, to the taking of Constantinople
by Mahomet the Second; with a review of Mahomet and his suc∣cessors,
the Crusades and the Turks, as far as in their utmost latitude
they are connected with the fate of the Eastern or Western Empire.
With regard to our pecuniary arrangements, I persuade myself that
<PB N="666" REF="687"/>
we shall have no more difficulties now than heretofore; that you
will cheerfully assign the same value to the three younger as to the
three elder brothers; and that so important a transaction will have
been concluded in the first instance by three minutes of conversa∣tion,
and in the second by three lines of a letter; a memorable ex∣ample
in the annals of authors and booksellers. If you agree with
me on this subject, you may provide paper, &amp;c. as soon as you
please in the spring, in the full confidence of seeing me with my
book in the summer; and I should not be sorry to learn what time
(in using the utmost expedition) would be sufficient for printing,
and how late you would consent to publish in the ensuing spring.
At this moment, when I am straining every nerve to conclude my
living labours, I am ill-disposed to lose any time in the dull dead
work of correcting a new edition. When I am in England, quiet
in the country, there would be room and leisure for a complete re∣vision;
and I should have no objection to place at the end of the
sixth volume a string of amendments and improvements, which
hereafter might be inserted in their proper places. We shall like∣wise
have occasion for a good and general index to the whole.</P>
<P>I sincerely condole with you in your various losses: Rose and
Strahan were indeed valuable men. For myself, you will rejoice to
hear that I am satisfied with my Swiss retirement; and that, except
some mild and transient fits of the gout, I enjoy as much health and
happiness as is compatible with the lot of man. I expect with much
impatience Dr. Robertson's improved edition. There are three or
four books which I should like to have without delay: that work,
Pennant's Arctic Zoology, White's Sermons (the Arabic professor),
the Annual Registers since the year 1782. With Elmsley's assist∣ance
(he is a sad dog, but I will write to him soon) could you not
inclose them in a small box, with any other recent publications of
merit, and dispatch them instantly by some more costly and expedi∣tious
mode of conveyance? I am, most faithfully yours.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>January 20th, 1787.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER some sallies of wrath, you seem at length to have subsided
in sullen silence, and I must confess not totally without reason.
Yet if your mind be still open to truth, you will confess that I am
not so black as I appear. 1. Your Lordship has shewn much less
activity and eloquence than formerly, and your last letter was an
answer to mine, which I had expected some time with impatience.
Bad examples are dangerous to young people. 2. Formerly I have
neglected answering your epistles on essential, though unpleasant,
business; and the <HI>res-publica</HI> or <HI>privata</HI> may have suffered by
my neglect. Supposing therefore we had no transactions, why
should I write so often? To exchange sentimental compliments, or
to relate the various and important transactions of the republic of
Lausanne. As long as I do not inform you of my death, you have
good grounds to believe me alive and well. You have a general,
and will soon have a more particular idea of my system and arrange∣ment
here. One day glides away after another in tranquil uni∣formity.
Every object must have sides and moments less luminous
than others; but, upon the whole, the life and the place which I have
chosen are most happily adapted to my character and circumstances;
and I can now repeat, at the end of three years, what I soon and
sincerely affirmed, that never, in a single instant, have I repented of
my scheme of retirement to Lausanne; a retirement which was
judged by my best and wisest friend a project little short of insanity.
The place, the people, the climate, have answered or exceeded my
warmest expectations. And though I truly rejoice in my approach∣ing
visit to England, Mr. Pitt, were he your friend and mine, would
not find it an easy task to prevent my return. 3. And now let me add
<PB N="668" REF="689"/>
a third reason, which often diverted me from writing; namely, my
impatience to see you this next summer. I am building a great
book, which, besides the three stories already exposed to the public
eye, will have three stories more before we reach the roof and
battlements. You too have built or altered a great Gothic castle
with baronial battlements. Did you finish it within the time you
intended? As that time drew near, did you not find a thousand
nameless and unexpected works that must be performed; each of
them calling for a portion of time and labour? and had you not de∣spised,
nobly despised, the minute diligence of finishing, fitting up,
and furnishing the apartments, you would have discovered a new
train of indispensable business. Such, at least, has been my case.
A long while ago, when I contemplated the distant prospect of my
work, I gave you and myself some hopes of landing in England last
autumn; but, alas! when autumn grew near, hills began to rise on
hills, Alps on Alps, and I found my journey far more tedious and
toilsome than I had imagined. When I look back on the length of
the undertaking, and the variety of materials, I cannot accuse, or
suffer myself to be accused of idleness; yet it appeared that unless I
doubled my diligence, another year, and perhaps more, would elapse
before I could embark with my complete manuscript. Under these
circumstances I took, and am still executing, a bold and meritorious
resolution. The mornings in winter, and in a country of early
dinners, are very concise; to them, my usual period of study, I
now frequently add the evenings, renounce cards and society, refuse
the most agreeable evenings, or perhaps make my appearance at a
late supper. By this extraordinary industry, which I never prac∣tised
before, and to which I hope never to be again reduced, I see the
last part of my History growing apace under my hands; all my
materials are collected and arranged; I can exactly compute, by the
square foot, or the square page, all that remains to be done; and af∣ter
concluding text and notes, after a general review of my time
<PB N="669" REF="690"/>
and my ground, I now can decisively ascertain the final period of
the Decline and Fall, and can boldly promise that I will dine with
you at Sheffield-Place in the month of August, or perhaps of July,
in the present year; within less than a twelvemonth of the term
which I had loosely and originally fixed; and perhaps it would not
be easy to find a work of that size and importance in which the
workman has so tolerably kept his word with himself and the public.
But in this situation, oppressed with this particular object, and steal∣ing
every hour from my amusement, to the fatigue of the pen, and
the eyes, you will conceive, or you might conceive, how little sto∣mach
I have for the epistolary style; and that instead of idle, though
friendly, correspondence, I think it far more agreeable to employ
my time in the effectual measures that may hasten and exhilarate our
personal interview. About a month ago I had a voluntary, and not
unpleasing, epistle from Cadell; he informs me that he is going to
print a new octavo edition, the former being exhausted, and that the
public expect with impatience the conclusion of that excellent work,
whose reputation increases every day, &amp;c. I answered him by the
return of the post, to inform him of the period and extent of my
labours, and to express a reasonable hope that he would set the same
value on the three last as he had done on the three former volumes.
Should we conclude in this easy manner a transaction so honourable
to the author and bookseller, my way is clear and open before me;
in pecuniary matters I think I am assured for the rest of my life of
never troubling my friends, or being troubled myself; a state to
which I aspire, and which I indeed deserve, if not by my manage∣ment,
at least by moderation.</P>
<P>In your last, you talk more of the French treaty than of yourself
and your wife and family; a true English <HI>quid nunc!</HI> For my part,
in this remote, inland, neutral country, you will suppose, that after
a slight glance on the papers, I have neither had the means nor the
inclination to think very deeply about it. As a citizen of the world,
<PB N="670" REF="691"/>
a character to which I am every day rising or sinking, I must rejoice
in every agreement that diminishes the separation between neigh∣bouring
countries, which softens their prejudices, unites their in∣terests
and industry, and renders their future hostilities less frequent
and less implacable. With regard to the present treaty, I hope both
nations are gainers; since otherwise it cannot be lasting; and such
double mutual gain is surely possible in fair trade, though it could
not easily happen in the mischievous amusements of war and gaming.
* * *
What a delightful hand have these great
statesmen made of it since my departure! without power, and, as
far as I can see, without hope. When we meet I shall advise you
to digest all your political and commercial knowledge, (England, Ire∣land,
France, America,) and, with some attention to style and order,
to make the whole a classic book, which may preserve your name
and benefit your country. I know not whether you have seen Sir
Henry Clinton since his return: he passed a day with me, and
seemed pleased with my reception and place. We talked over you
and the American war. I embrace the <HI>silent my Lady</HI> and the two
honourable Misses, whom I sigh to behold and admire. Adieu.
Ever yours.</P>
<P>Though I can part with land, you find I cannot part with books:
the remainder of my library has so long embarrassed your room,
that it may now await my presence and final judgment. Has my
Lady read a novel intitled Caroline de Litchfield, of our home ma∣nufacture;
I may say of ours, since Deyverdun and myself were
the judges and patrons of the manuscript. The author, who is since
married a second time, (Madame de Crousaz, now Montolieu,) is a
charming woman. I was in some danger. Once more, bar a long
fit of the gout, and the Historian will land at Dover before the end
of July. Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>February 24th, 1787.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM perfectly satisfied with your's and Mr. Strahan's cheerful and
liberal assent to my proposal, and am glad to find that your part∣ner
has not degenerated from his worthy father, whose loss I sin∣cerely
lament. The sole remaining difficulty (of the volumes falling
below the guinea price) it is unnecessary for the present to discuss,
as I think it unlikely to happen. As I am resolved to finish and revise
the work before I leave Lausanne, it will depend on yourself to ar∣range
your preparations of paper, &amp;c. in such a manner that we
may lose no time, but go to press the first week after my arrival.
But in the mean while I wish you to reflect and inquire; 1st, In
how many months the impression of the three volumes may be com∣pleted,
either with ordinary or extraordinary diligence. And,
2dly, How late in next year you would be desirous or willing to
publish. On my revisal I may find more alterations and improve∣ments
to make than I at present foresee; I may be disabled by a fit
of the gout; and your speedy answer will inform me of the utmost
latitude in which I may be indulged, without totally disconcerting our
common interest. You probably agree with me in the necessity of
a good general index for the six volumes. If you are posssessed of
an intelligent workman, he might without delay take in hand the
first three volumes; but in that case I must desire him to send me as
soon as possible a <HI>short</HI> specimen by the post. I have thought on the
subject of index-making, and can give him some advice, which will
abridge the size, without impairing the use and value of his alpha∣betical
table. By a letter of the thirteenth instant, Elmsley informs
me that he is on the point of sending the books; and I hope to
<PB N="672" REF="693"/>
have them here before the end of next month. I propose writing
to him very soon; but as the events of life are uncertain, it may be
safer to answer his question through your channel: <Q>The author of
Caroline (Madame de Crousaz) is now become Madame la Ba∣ronne
de Montolieu by second marriage, and has other cares and
pleasures besides those of writing. Her pen is not idle, but her
new schemes of romance are not in any degree of forwardness
or maturity. Perhaps an handsome proposal from an English
bookseller might stimulate her diligence.</Q> I am sincerely yours.</P>
<P>In our style of negociation it is almost superfluous to say that I
reserve about a score of copies for myself and my friends.</P>

<P>I BEGIN to discover that if I wait till I could atchieve a just and
satisfactory epistle, equally pleasant and instructive, you would
have a poor chance of hearing from me. I will therefore content
myself with a simple answer to a question, which (I love to believe)
you repeat with some impatience: "When may we expect you in
England?" My great building is, as it were, completed, and
some slight ornaments, the painting and glazing of the last finished
rooms may be dispatched without inconvenience in the autumnal
residence of Sheffield-Place. It is therefore my sincere and peremp∣tory
intention to depart from Lausanne about the twentieth of July,
and to find myself (<HI>me trouver</HI>) in London on or before the glorious
first of August. I know of nothing that can prevent it but a fit of
the gout, the capricious tyrant, who obeys no laws either of time
or place; and so unfortunately are we circumstanced, that such a fit,
<PB N="673" REF="694"/>
if it came late and lasted long, would effectually disable me from
coming till next spring; since thereby I should lose the season, the
monsoon, for the impression of three quarto volumes, which will
require nine months (a regular parturition), and cannot advantage∣ously
appear after the beginning or middle of May. At the same
time do not be apprehensive that I mean to play you a dog's trick.
From a thousand motives it is my wish to come over this year: the
desire of seeing you, and the <HI>silent sullen</HI> my Lady; the family ar∣rangements,
discharge of servants, which I have already made; the
strong wish of settling my three youngest children in a manner
honourable to them and beneficial to their parents. Much miscella∣neous
matter rises to my pen, but I will not be tempted to turn the
leaf. Expect me therefore at Sheffield-Place, with strong probability,
about the fifteenth of August. Adieu. Yours.</P>

<P>THE twentieth of July is past, and I am still at Lausanne; but
the march of heavy bodies, such as armies and historians, can
seldom be foreseen or fixed to a precise day. Some particular rea∣sons
have engaged me to allow myself another week; and the day
of my departure is now (<HI>I believe</HI>) determined for Sunday the twenty-ninth
instant. You know the road and the distance. I am no rapid
English traveller, and my servant is not accustomed to ride post. I
was never fond of deeds of darkness, and if the weather be hot, we
must repose in the middle of the day. Yet the roads are in general
good: between sun and sun the interval is long; and, barring the
accidents of winds and waves, I think it possible to reach London
in ten or twelve days; <HI>viz.</HI> on or before the ninth of August. With
<PB N="674" REF="695"/>
your active spirit, you will scarce understand how I can look on this
easy journey with some degree of reluctance and apprehension; but
after a tranquil sedentary life of four years, (having lain but a single
night out of my own bed,) I see mountains and monsters in the
way; and so happy do I feel myself <HI>at home,</HI> that nothing but the
strongest calls of friendship and interest could drag me from hence.
You ingeniously propose that I should turn off at Sittingbourn, and
seem to wonder what business I can find, or make, for an immediate
residence in the capital. Have you totally forgot that I bring over
three quarto voumes for the press? and are you ignorant that not a
moment must be lost, if we are desirous of appearing at a proper season;
and that I must set the machine in motion before I can secede to Shef∣field-Place with an easy mind, and for a reasonable term? Of this be
assured, that I shall not be less impatient than yourself, and that, of hu∣man
two-legged animals, yourself and yours are the first whom I shall
wish to see in England. For myself, I do not regret the occupancy
of Downing-street; in my first visit to London, a lodging or hotel
in the Adelphi will be more convenient; but I have some anxiety
about my books, and must try whether I can approach those holy
relics, without offending the delicacy of an amiable Duchess. Our
interview is so near, that I have little more to add, except a caution
about my own concerns, in which you will confess, that from—,
and—, to—, I have been generally unlucky. If any thing
remains, present or future, it must be agitated and decided; but all
retrospects are useless and painful, and we have so many pleasant
subjects of conversation, that all such odious matters may be buried
in oblivion. Adieu. I embrace my Lady and Louisa, but I no
longer presume, even on paper, to embrace the blooming Maria.
Ever yours.</P>

<P>INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY. This day (August the seventh)
the celebrated E. G. arrived with a numerous retinue (one ser∣vant).
We hear that he has brought over from Lausanne the re∣mainder
of his History for immediate publication. The post had
left town before my arrival. I am pleased, but indeed astonished, to
find myself in London, after a journey of six hundred miles, and
hardly yet conceive how I had resolution to undertake it. I find
myself not a little fatigued, and have devoted this hot day to pri∣vacy
and repose, without having seen any body except Cadell and
Elmsley, and my neighbour Batt, whose civility amounts to kind∣ness
and real friendship. But you may depend on it, that instead of
sauntering in town, or giving way to every temptation, I will dis∣patch
my necessary work, and hasten with impatience to the groves
of Sheffield-Place; a project somewhat more rational than the hasty
turbulent visit which your vigour had imagined. If you come up
to quicken my diligence we shall meet the sooner; but I see no ap∣pearance
of my leaving town before the end of next week. I em∣brace,

<P>ALAS! alas! alas! How vain and fallacious are all the designs of
man. This is now the eighteenth of December, precisely one
month since my departure from Sheffield-Place; and it was firmly
my wish, my hope, my resolution, that after dispatching some need∣ful
business in London, and accomplishing a pious duty at Bath, I
<PB N="677" REF="698"/>
should by this day be restored to the tranquil leisure, and friendly
society, of Sheffield-Place. A cruel tyrant has disconcerted all my
plans; my business in town has been neglected, my attendance at
Bath is just begun, and my return is yet distant. I was not a little
edified to hear of some expressions of regret and discontent on my
departure; and though I am not able to produce as good evidence,
you will perhaps believe that in the solitude of a London lodging I
often railed at the gout for maliciously delaying his attack till I was
removed from a place where my sufferings would have been allevi∣ated
by every kind and comfortable attention. I grew at last so
desperately impatient, as to resolve on immediate flight, without
waiting till I had totally expelled the foe, and recovered my strength.
I performed the journey with tolerable ease, but the motion has agi∣tated
the remains of the humour. I am very lame, and a second
fit may possibly be the punishment of my rashness.</P>
<P>As yet I have seen nothing of Bath except Mrs. G—; and weak∣ness,
as well as propriety, will confine me very closely to her. Lord
Sheffield, with Mrs. Holroyd and Maria, dined with us yesterday.
We begin to throw out hints of the shortness of our stay, and in∣dispensable
business; and, unless I should be confined by the gout,
it is resolved in our cabinet to leave Bath on Thursday the twenty-sixth,
and passing through Lord Loughborough's and town, to settle
at Sheffield-Place, most assuredly, before the end of the year. For
my own part I can say with truth, that did not the press loudly de∣mand
my presence, I could, without a sigh, allow the Duchess to
reign in Downing-street the greatest part of the winter, and should
be happy in the society of two persons (no common blessing) whom
I love, and by whom I am beloved.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>COLLEGE of EDINBURGH, <DATE>February 27th, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH you have now been some time in London, yet as I heard
of your welfare by different channels, and as I know from expe∣rience
how much a man has to do who is printing three quartos, even
after he thinks they are altogether ready for the press, I have hitherto
forborne to interrupt you by any letter or inquiry of mine. But
there is such a general impatience to see your new publication among
people of letters here; and, as your friend, I am so frequently in∣terrogated
about the length it has advanced, and the time when it
will appear, that I begin to be ashamed of knowing nothing more
about it than other people. I must request of you then to furnish
me with such information as may both preserve my credit, and gra∣tify
my own curiosity. My expectations from this part of your
work are, indeed, very high. Your materials begin to improve, and
are certainly much more copious than during a great part of the pe∣riod
you have gone through. You have three or four events as
great, and splendid, and singular, as the heart of an historian could
wish to delineate. The contemporary writers will furnish you with
all the necessary facts. To adorn them as elegant writers, or to ac∣count
for them as philosophers, never entered into their heads. This
they have left to you.</P>
<P>Since you went to the continent I have not done so much as I
wished. My health, until lately, has been more shattered; and as
I advance in life, (I am now sixty-six,) though my faculties, I ima∣gine,
are still entire, yet I find my mind less active and ardent. I
have, however, finished a very careful revise of all my works, and
have given them the last polish they will receive from my hand. I
<PB N="679" REF="700"/>
have made some additions to each of them, and in the History of
Scotland pretty considerable ones. I have desired Mr. Strahan to
send to you a copy of them uniformly bound, and hope you will

at least as orthodox as he himself, yet he rails against me with all
the asperity of theological hatred. I shall adhere to my fixed
maxim of making no reply. May I hope that when you see Lord
Loughborough you will remember me to him with kindness and re∣spect.

<P>INSTEAD of the Historian you receive a short letter, in your eyes
an indispensable tribute. This day, at length, after long delay
and frequent expostulation, I have received the writings, which I
am now in the act of signing, sealing, and delivering, according to
the lawyer's directions. * * *
I long to be at Sheffield-Place. You
see my departure is not postponed a moment by idleness or pleasure,
but the precise day still hangs on contingencies, and we must all be
patient, if our wishes should be thwarted. I say our wishes, for I
sincerely desire to be with you. I have had many dinners, some
splendid and memorable, with Hastings last Thursday, with the
Prince of Wales next Tuesday at Craufurd's. But the town empties,
Texier is silent, and in an evening, I <HI>desiderate</HI> the resources of a
<PB N="680" REF="701"/>
family or a club. Caplin has finished the Herculean labour, and
seven majestic boxes will abdicate on Monday your hall. Severy
has likewise dispatched his affairs, and secured his companion Clarke,
who is arrived in town; but his schemes are abridged by the inexo∣rable
rigour of Lord Howe, who has assured our great and fair in∣tercessors,
that by the King's order the dock-yards are shut against
all strangers. We therefore give up Portsmouth, and content our∣selves
with two short trips; one to Stowe and Oxford, the other to
Chatham; and if we can catch a launch and review, <HI>encore vit on.</HI>
He (Severy, not Lord Howe,) salutes with me the family. Adieu.

Homer's admirable precept:

Spare me, therefore, spare yourself, the trouble of a fruitless contest,

closed for this year. Sheridan surpassed himself; and though I am
far from considering him as a perfect orator, there were many beau∣tiful
passages in his speech, on justice, filial love, &amp;c.; one of
the closest chains of argument I ever heard, to prove that Hastings
was responsible for the acts of Middleton; and a compliment, much
admired, to a certain Historian of your acquaintance. Sheridan, in
the close of his speech, sunk into Burke's arms; but I called this
morning, he is perfectly well. I fear that I shall not be able to dine
at home a single day. To-morrow Severy and myself go to Bushy.

<OPENER><DATELINE>COLLEGE of EDINBURGH, <DATE>July 30th, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LONG before this I should have acknowledged the receipt of your
most acceptable present; but for several weeks I have been af∣flicted
with a violent fit of deafness, and that unsocial malady is always
<PB N="682" REF="703"/>
accompanied with such a degree of languor, as renders even the
writing of a letter an effort. During my solitude the perusal of your
book has been my chief amusement and consolation. I have gone
through it once with great attention, and am now advanced to the
last volume in my second reading. I ventured to predict the superior
excellence of the volumes lately published, and I have not been a
false prophet. Indeed, when I consider the extent of your under∣taking,
and the immense labour of historical and philosophic re∣search
requisite towards executing every part of it, I am astonished
that all this should have been accomplished by one man. I know
no example, in any age or nation, of such a vast body of valuable
and elegant information communicated by any individual. I feel,
however, some degree of mortification mingled with my astonish∣ment.
Before you began your historic career, I used to pride myself
in being at least the most industrious historian of the age; but now,
alas! I can pretend no longer even to that praise, and must say, as
Pliny did of his uncle, <HI>Si comparer illi sum desidiosissimus.</HI> Your
style appears to me improved in these new volumes; by the habit
of writing, you write with greater ease. I am sorry to find that our
ideas on the effects of the Crusades do not altogether coincide. I
considered that point with great care, and cannot help thinking still
that my opinion was well founded. I shall consult the autho∣rities
to which I refer; for when my sentiments differ from yours,
I have some reason to distrust them, and I may possibly trouble you
with a letter on the subject. I am much flattered with the manner
in which you have so often mentioned my name. <HI>Laetus sum lau∣dari
a te landato viro.</HI> I feel much satisfaction in having been di∣stinguished
by the two historians of my own times, whose favour∣able
opinion I was most ambitious of obtaining.</P>
<P>I hope this letter may find you still in England. When you re∣turn
to Lausanne, permit me to recommend to your good office my
youngest son, who is now at Yverdun on account of his health, and
lives with M. Herman, a clergyman there. You will find the
<PB N="683" REF="704"/>
young man (if you can rely on the partial testimony of a father)
sensible, modest, and well-bred, and though no great scholar, he
has seen much; having returned from India, where he served last
war, by Bassora, Bagdat, Moussul, and Aleppo. He is now a Cap∣tain
in the twenty-third regiment. If you have any friend at Yver∣dun,
be so good as to recommend him. It will do him credit
to have your countenance. I have desired him to pay his respects
to you at Lausanne. Farewell, my dear Sir. I ever am yours most

<P>I SHOULD be much more ashamed of my silence, were I not satis∣fied
that you have received a recent and favourable account of me
from some of our friends who have visited this place since my re∣turn.
<PB N="684" REF="705"/>
But I should be inexcusable, did I not thank you for your
kind and seasonable wishes, which I can return with equal sincerity.
I do not propose making any improvements or corrections in the
octavo edition which you meditate: some slight alterations would give
me more trouble than pleasure. A thorough revision of the whole
work would be the labour of many months; it may be the amuse∣ment
of my old age, and will be a valuable legacy, to renew your
copy-right at the expiration of the last fourteen years. In the mean
while, some expedition may be useful to guard your property from
the unexpected invasion of <HI>foreign</HI> pirates. Eight volumes in octavo
are already printed at Basil, and the remainder is expected every day.
I am both glad and sorry to inform you, that the type is neat, the
paper tolerable, and the text <HI>wonderfully</HI> correct. I hear of another
English edition in Saxony, and of two French translations advancing
with speed and emulation at Paris. Of the success of the work at
home you are best qualified, and most interested, to judge; and I
am happy to find that you express yourself, with some reserve, satis∣fied
with the sale. From some reports of angry criticisms, and from
the use and abuse of my name in the papers, I perceive that I am
not forgotten. Before a year has elapsed from the time of publica∣tion,
my History will have been perused by some thousand readers
of various characters and understandings. Each will probably find
something to blame, and I hope something to commend; and the
balance of their private judgments will fix the public estimate of its
merit and reputation. Since my return I have been, as I promise
in the preface, very busy an very idle in my library: several ideal
works have been embraced and thrown aside; but if the warm
weather should ripen any project to form and maturity, you may
depend on the earliest intelligence. I have received a very friendly
and flattering letter from Dr. Robertson, and have had the pleasure
of shewing some civilities to his son during his residence in this
place. If you can, send me a good account of Adam Smith; there
<PB N="685" REF="706"/>
is no man more sincerely interested in his welfare than myself. I
beg you will present my compliments to all our friends, particularly to
Mr. Strahan and Dr. Gillies. Tell Elmsley, that I have received with
due contrition, his <HI>third</HI> letter: unless you are speedy, my answer

<P>I RECEIVED with more concern than surprize, your kind notification
of my poor uncle's departure. My own knowledge of his many
valuable qualities teaches me to sympathize in your loss; but his long
infirmities and gradual decay must have prepared you for the melan∣choly
event, and your own reason will suggest the best and strongest mo∣tives
of consolation; among these is your regard for the amiable chil∣dren
whom he has left behind. Your labours for their future happiness
will be assisted by all your friends, who are attached to his memory;
and for my own part, I beg leave to assure you, that on every occa∣sion
I shall consider them as my near and dear relations. When I
had last the pleasure of seeing Charlotte at Kensington, I was de∣lighted
with her innocent cheerfulness, with her assiduous care of
her poor father, and with an appearance of sense and discretion far
beyond her years. How happy should I think myself, if I had a

qualified to govern my family, and to be my companion and comfort
in the decline of life!</P>
<P>You will, I am sure, be pleased to hear that my situation at Lau∣fanne

<P>I SHOULD indeed be inexcusable for my long neglect of your
last obliging letter, had it not reached me in a moment of pain
and weakness, in a sit of the gout, the longest and most severe that
I have ever known. A letter with me is no trifling enterprize;
and before I could find strength, and time, and resolution, the oc∣casion
on which you so handsomely consulted me was already past.
I suppose that the abridgment of my History is now freely circu∣lated,
either with or without your name; nor can I foresee any
possible mischief, either for <HI>my</HI> reputation or <HI>your</HI> interest. A trans∣lation,
an abridgment, or even a criticism, always proves the success,
and consequently extends the sale, of any popular work.</P>
<P>As I am inclined to flatter myself that you have no reason to be
displeased with your purchase, I now wish to ask you whether you
feel yourself disposed to add a seventh, or supplemental volume to
my History? The materials of which it will be composed will
naturally be classed under the three following heads: 1. A series
of fragments, disquisitions, digressions, &amp;c. more or less connected
with the principal subject. 2. Several tables of geography, chro∣nology,
coins, weights and measures, &amp;c.; nor should I despair of
obtaining from a gentleman at Paris some accurate and well-adapted
maps. 3. A critical review of all the authors whom I have used
and quoted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon soon became tired of this plan, and expressed a wish it had not been mentioned. He said his History was a critical review of the authors he had used. S.</NOTE>. I am convinced such a supplement might be rendered
entertaining, as well as useful; and that few purchasers would refuse
<PB N="687" REF="708"/>
to <HI>complete</HI> their Decline and Fall. But as the writer could not derive
either fame or amusement from these obscure labours, he must be
encouraged by other motives; and, in plain English, I should expect
the same reward for the seventh, as for any of the preceding vo∣lumes.
You think and act with too much liberality, to confound
such a large original supplement with the occasional improvements
of a new edition, which are already your property by the terms of
our former convenant. But as I am jealous of standing clear, not
only in law and equity, but in your esteem and my own, I shall
instantly renounce the undertaking, if it appears by your answer
that you have the shadow of an objection. Should you tempt me
to proceed, this supplement will be only the employment of my
leisure hours; and I foresee that full two years will elapse before I
can deliver it into the hands of the printer.</P>
<P>Our friend Elmsley, who possibly thinks me dead and buried, will
be, or will not be, surprized when you inform him that I have now
a letter of two pages in my bureau addressed to him, dated the twenty-sixth
of May, and not yet finished. Hunger, literary hunger, will
soon, however, compel me to write; as I have many questions to
ask, and many commissions to give. In the mean while I thirst for
Mr. Burke's Reflections on the Revolutions of France. Intreat
Elmsley, in my name, to dispatch it to Lausanne with care and
speed, by <HI>any</HI> mode of conveyance less expensive than the post. He
may add to the parcel the new edition of Adam Smith's Theory of
Moral Sentiments. I heard of his death with more concern than
surprize. What a loss to letters, philosophy, and mankind!</P>
<P>I beg you would remember me to Mr. Strahan and all our friends.
In my happy exile, my public and private affections remind me that
I am an Englishman. Pray thank Dr. Moore, in my name, for the
pleasure which I have received from Zeluco, the best philosophical
romance of the age. If he cultivates his talents by any similar
publications, I only wish that he would place the scene at home;
<PB N="688" REF="709"/>
we may describe the characters, but we can never paint the <HI>manners</HI>
of foreigners; and the quarrel of the two Scotchmen is doubtless
the best chapter in the book. I am, dear Sir, most faithfully
yours.</P>

<P>TOO many posts have slipped away since my receipt of your last
letter, without my assuring you that every shadow of misap∣prehension
has vanished from my mind, and that I am perfectly sa∣tisfied
with the liberality of your sentiments and conduct. But I am
every day more inclined to believe that on the present occasion they
will not be put to the trial. On a closer inspection, I discover more
difficulty and less advantage than I had at first imagined in the plan
of a supplement; and I feel the objection, which you so handsomely
decline, against encreasing the weight and price of so voluminous a
work. Perhaps it would have been better if my crude idea had not
been so hastily announced to the public; but even this venial indis∣cretion
is a proof of your zeal and regard. The intelligence of any
new designs shall be delayed till they are ripe for execution; but
you may be assured that I am now awake.</P>
<P>I am very happy to hear that our respectable friend Dr. Robertson
is not asleep; and much do I expect from the subject and the pen.
I had once a design not totally unconnected with his own, but it is
now in far abler hands. Boswell's book will be curious, or at least
whimsical: his hero, who can so long detain the public curiosity,
must be no common animal. I see you now advertise an octavo
edition of Dr. Henry's History of England. Is not the author
dead? His plan is excellent, and I wish you could engage some
<PB N="689" REF="710"/>
diligent and sensible man to undertake the continuation. Alas! if
Dr. Campbell were still alive! I have desired Elmsley to ask you for
three octavo copies of my own work. Whenever he sends me a box
of books, I should be glad if you would enrich it with any of your own
valuable publications. Your name is a recommendation; but the
chastity of that name cannot be too religiously preserved. My health
and spirits are now remarkably good, and it will give me great plea∣sure
to receive as favourable an account of yourself. I am most

<P>AS much as I am accustomed to my own sins, I am shocked,
really shocked, when I think of my long and most inex∣cusable
silence; nor do I dare to compute how many months I have
suffered to elapse without sending a single line (Oh shame! shame!)
to the best and dearest of my friends, who indeed has been very
seldom out of my thoughts. I have sometimes imagined that if the
opportunities of writing occurred less frequently, they would be
seized with more diligence; but the unfortunate departure of the
post twice every week encourages procrastination, and each short
successive delay is indulged without seruple, till the whole has swelled
to a tremendous account. I will try, alas! to reform; and, although
I am afraid that writing grows painful to you, I have the confidence
to solicit a <HI>speedy line,</HI> to say that you love and forgive me. After a
long experience of the unfeeling doubts and delays of the law, you will
probably soon hear from Lord Sheffield that the Beriton transaction
is at last concluded, and I hope that you will be satisfied with the
full and firm security of your annuity. That you may long con∣tinue
to enjoy it is the first and most sincere wish of my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="690" REF="711"/>
In the placid course of our lives, at Lausanne and Bath, we have
few events to relate, and fewer changes to describe; but I indulge
myself in the pleasing belief that we are both as well and as happy
as the common order of nature will allow us to expect. I should be
satisfied, had I received from time to time some indirect, but agree∣able,
information of your health. For myself, I have no complaint,
except the gout; and though the visits of my old enemy are some∣what
longer, and more enfeebling, they are consined to my feet and
knees; the pain is moderate, and my imprisonment to my chamber,
or my chair, is much alleviated by the daily kindness of my friends.
I wish it were in my power to give you an adequate idea of the con∣veniency
of my house, and the beauty of my garden; both of
which I have improved at a considerable expence since the death of
poor Deyverdun. But the loss of a friend is indeed irreparable.
Were I ten years younger, I might possibly think of a female com∣panion;
but the choice is difficult, the success doubtful, the engage∣ment
perpetual, and at fifty-four a man should never think of alter∣ing
the whole system of his life and habits. The disposal of Beri∣ton,
and the death of my aunt Hester, who has left me her estate
in Sussex, makes me very easy in my worldly affairs: my income is
equal to my expence, and my expence is adequate to my wishes.
You may possibly have heard of literary projects which are ascribed
to me by the public without my knowledge: but it is much more
probable that I have closed the account; and though I shall never
lay aside the pleasing occupations of study, you may be assured that
I have no serious settled thoughts of a new work. Next year I
shall meditate, and I trust shall execute, a visit to England, in which
the Belvidere is one of my powerful loadstones. I often reflect
with a painful emotion on the imperious circumstances which have
thrown us at such a distance from each other.</P>
<P>In the moving picture of the world, you cannot be indifferent
to the strange revolution which has humbled all that was high, and
exalted all that was low, in France. The irregular and lively spirit
<PB N="691" REF="712"/>
of the nation has disgraced their liberty, and instead of building a
free constitution, they have only exchanged despotism for anarchy.
This town and country are crowded with noble exiles; and we
sometimes count in an assembly a dozen Princesses and Duchesses.
Burke, if I remember right, is no favourite of yours; but there is
surely much eloquence and much sense in his book. The prosperity
of England forms a proud contrast with the disorders of France; but
I hope we shall avoid the folly of a Russian war. Pitt, in this in∣stance,
seems too like his father. Mr. Helrard, a sensible man, and
his pupil have left us. They found, as your friends will always
find, the weight of your recommendation with me. I am, dearest
Madam, ever most affectionately yours.</P>

<P>SOME time before the publication of my Historical Disquisition
concerning India I desired our friend Mr. Cadell to send a copy
of it to you in my name. I hope you received it long ago, and
will allow it to remain in your library, as a memorial of my respect
and friendship. No man had formed a more decided resolution of
retreating early from public view, and of spending the eve of life in the
tranquillity of professional and domestic occupations; but, directly in
the face of that purposs, I step forth with a new work, when just on
the brink of threescore and ten. The preface of the book gives a fair
and simple account how this happened. Hitherto I have no cause to
repent of a step which I took with hesitation and anxiety. My book
has met with a reception beyond what the <HI>spe lenius, pavidusque
futuri,</HI> dared to expect. I find, however, like other parents, that I
have a partial fondness for this child of my old age; and cannot set
<PB N="692" REF="713"/>
my heart quite at ease, until I know your opinion of it. I need
not say with what perfect confidence I rest upon your judgment, and
how happy it will make me to find that this production meets with
your approbation. Nothing will add so much to that pleasure, as
your communicating to me any remarks that occurred to you in per∣using
it. While I was engaged in composing the Disquisition it often
occurred to me, that I was more upon your ground than in any of my
former works; and I often wished that I had been so near to you as
to profit by your advice and information. Next to that will be the
benefit I may derive from your friendly strictures. Be so kind then
as to mention to me any error or omission you have observed; every
criticism of yours will be instructive.</P>
<P>Permit me to request another favour. You allowed me to hope,
that as soon as you fixed upon a new subject you would let me
know, and give me the satisfaction of indulging the hopes of living
until you finished it. I trust that you are not idle still. I may now
tell you with authority, that you are yet far from that period of life
when you should lay down your pen. I can say from experience,
that the busiest season of life is the most happy; and I have no doubt
that you will concur with me in this sentiment. Let me know then,
my dear Sir, how you are, what you are doing, and what progress
you make. As for my part, I enjoy good health; and, except some
fits of deafness, am little troubled with the infirmities of old age. I
write this at my son-in-law's, Mr. Brydone, who, if he had not a

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the arts of our great enemy, the daemon
of procrastination, I should not have postponed for so many
months a pleasing duty, which may at any time be performed in a
single hour, had I not for some time past entertained a lively and
probable hope of visiting you this autumn in person; had I not
flattered myself, that the very next post I might be able to fix the
day of my departure from Lausanne, and almost of my arrival at
the Belvidere. That hope is now vanished, and my journey to
England is unavoidably delayed till the spring or summer of next
year. The extraordinary state of public affairs in France opposes an
insuperable bar to my passage; and every prudent stranger will
avoid that inhospitable land, in which a people of slaves is suddenly
become a nation of tyrants and cannibals. The German road is in∣deed
safe, but, independent of a great addition of fatigue and ex∣pence,
the armies of Austria and Prussia now cover that frontier;
and though the generals are polite, and the troops well disciplined,
I am not desirous of passing through the clouds of hussars and pan∣dours
that attend their motions. These public reasons are fortified
by some private motives, and to this delay I resign myself, with a
sigh for the present, and a hope for the future.</P>
<P>What a strange wild world do we live in! You will allow me to
be a tolerable historian, yet, on a fair review of ancient and modern
times, I can find none that bear any affinity with the present. My
knowledge of your discerning mind, and my recollection of your
political principles, assure me, that you are no more a <HI>democrat</HI> than

erect a free constitutional monarchy on the ruins of arbitrary power
and the Bastille, I should applaud their generous effort; but this
<PB N="694" REF="715"/>
total subversion of all rank, order, and government could be produc∣tive
only of a popular monster, which, after devouring every thing
else, must finally devour itself. I was once apprehensive that this
monster would propagate some imps in our happy island, but they
seem to have been crushed in their cradle; and I acknowledge with
pleasure and pride the good sense of the English nation, who seem
truly conscious of the blessings which they enjoy: and I am happy
to find that the most respectable part of Opposition has cordially
joined in the support of "things as they are." Even this country
has been somewhat tainted with the democratical infection; the vigi∣lance
of government has been exerted, the malecontents have been
awed, the misguided have been undeceived, the fever in the blood
has gradually subsided, and I flatter myself that we have secured the
tranquil enjoyment of obscure felicity, which we had been almost
tempted to despise.</P>
<P>You have heard, most probably, from Mrs. Holroyd, of the long∣expected
though transient satisfaction which I received from the
visit of Lord Sheffield's family. He appeared highly satisfied with
my arrangements here, my house, garden, and situation, at once in
town and country, which are indeed singular in their kind, and
which have often made me regret the impossibility of shewing them
to my dearest friend of the Belvidere. Lord Sheffield is still, and
will ever continue, the same active being; always employed for
himself, his friends, and the public, and always persuading himself
that he wishes for leisure and repose. There are various roads
to happiness; but when I compare his situation with mine, I do not,
upon the whole, repent that I have given the preference to a life of
celibacy and retirement. Although I have been long a spectator of
the great world, my unambitious temper has been content with the
occupations and rewards of study; and although my library be still
my favourite room, I am now no longer stimulated by the prosecution
of any literary work. The society of Lausanne is adapted to my
taste; my house is open to many agreeable acquaintance, and some
<PB N="695" REF="716"/>
real friends; the uniformity of the natives is enlivened by travellers of
all nations; and this summer I am happy in a familiar intercourse
with Lady Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire, Lady Elizabeth
Foster, and Lady Duncannon, who seems to be gradually recovering
from her severe complaints. My health is remarkably good. I
have now enjoyed a long interval from the gout; and I endeavour
to use with moderation Dr. Cadogan's best remedies, temperance,
exercise, and cheerfulness. Adieu, dear Madam; may every bless∣ing
that nature can allow be attendant on your latter season. Your
age and my habits will not permit a very close correspondence;
but I wish to hear, and I <HI>presume</HI> to ask, a speedy <HI>direct</HI> account of
your own situation. May it be such as I shall hear with pleasure!
Once more adieu; I live in hopes of embracing you next summer at
the Belvidere, but you may be assured that I bring over nothing for
the press.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LAUSANNE, <DATE>November 8th, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I REMEMBER it has been observed of Augustus and Cromwell, that
they should never have been born, or never have died; and I
am sometimes tempted to apply the same remark to certain beings
of a softer nature, who, after a short residence on the banks of the
Leman Lake, are now flown far away over the Alps and the Ap∣penines,
and have abandoned their votaries to the insipidity of com∣mon
life. The remark, however, would be unreasonable, and the
sentiment ungrateful. The pleasures of the summer, the lighter and
the graver moments of the society of <HI>petit Ouchy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A beautiful villa near the lake, about a mile from Lausanne.</NOTE>, are indeed past,
<PB N="696" REF="717"/>
perhaps never to return; but the remembrance of that delightful
period is itself a pleasure, and I enjoy, I cherish the flattering per∣suasion
that it is remembered with some satisfaction in the gallery of
Florence, as well as in <HI>the library</HI> of Lausanne. Long before we
were reduced to seek a refuge from the savages of Gaul, I had se∣cretly
indulged the thought, or at least the wish, of asking leave to
attend <HI>mes bonnes amies</HI> over Mount Cenis, of basking once more in
an Italian sun, and of paying once more my devotions to the Apollo
of the Vatican. But my aged and gouty limbs would have failed
me in the bold attempt of scaling St. Bernard, and I wanted patience
to undertake the tedious circumitineration of the Tirol. Your re∣turn
to the Pays de Vaud next summer I hold to be extremely doubt∣ful;
but my anxiety on that head is somewhat diminished by the
sure and certain hope of our all meeting in England the ensuing
winter. I flatter myself that the Porter of Devonshire-house will
not be inexorable; yet I am afraid of losing you amidst the smoke
and tumult of fashionable London, in which the night is devoted to
pleasure and the morning to sleep. My ambition may perhaps aspire
to pass some hours in the palladian Chiswick, or even some days at
Chatsworth; but these princely mansions will not recal the freedom,
the ease, the <HI>primitive</HI> solitude of dear little Ouchy. Indeed! indeed!
your fair friend was made for something better than a Duchess.</P>
<P>Although you most magnanimously abandoned us in the crisis of
our fate, yet as you seem to interest yourself in the hopes and fears
of this little country, it is my duty to inform you, that we still
hang in a state of suspense; inclining, however, to the side of hope,
rather than of despair. The garrison, and even the bourgeoisie, of
Geneva shewed a vigorous resolution of defending the city; and our
frontiers have been gradually covered with fifteen thousand intrepid
Swiss. But the threats of a bombardment, the weight of expence,
and, above all, the victorious ascendant of the French republic, have
abated much of the first heroic ardour. Monsieur de Montesquiou
<PB N="697" REF="718"/>
displayed a pacific, and even yielding, temper; and a treaty was
signed, dismissing the Swiss garrison from Geneva, and removing
the French troops to the distance of ten leagues. But this last con∣dition,
which is indeed objectionable, displeased the convention,
who refused to ratify the agreement. New conferences were held,
new messengers have been dispatched; but unless they are deter∣mined
to find or to make a subject of quarrel, it is probable that we
shall purchase peace by submission. As Geneva has a very dangerous
democratical party within her walls, and as the national guards are
already allowed to enter the city, and to tamper with the inhabitants
and the garrison, I will not ensure that poor little republic from one
week to another. For ourselves, the approaches of danger must be
more gradual. I think we are now safe for this winter, and I no
longer run to the window to see whether the French are coming.
But with so many enemies without, and so many within, the go∣vernment
of Bern, and the tranquillity of this happy country, will
be suspended by a very slender twig; and I begin to fear that Satan
will drive me out of the possession of Paradise. My only comfort
will be, that I shall have been expelled by the power, and not seduced
by the arts, of the blackest daemon in hell, the daemon of demo∣cracy.
Where indeed will this tremendous inundation, this con∣spiracy
of numbers against rank and property, be finally stopped.
Europe seems to be universally tainted, and wherever the French
can light a match, they may blow up a mine. Our only hope is
now in their devouring one another; they are furious and hungry
monsters, and war is almost declared between the convention and
the city of Paris, between the moderate republicans and the absolute
levellers. A majority of the convention wishes to spare the royal
victims, but they must yield to the rage of the people and the thirst
of popularity, and a few hours may produce a trial, a sentence, and
a guillotine. Mr. Necker is publishing a pamphlet in defence of thé
august sufferers; but his feeble and tardy efforts will rather do credit
<PB N="698" REF="719"/>
to himself, than service to his clients. You kindly ask after the
situation of poor Severy. Alas! it is now hopeless; all his com∣plaints
are increased, all his resources are exhausted; where nature
cannot work, the effect of art is vain, and his best friends begin to wish
him a quiet release. His wife, I had almost said his widow, is truly
an object of compassion. The dragoon is returned for a few days;
and if his domestic sorrows gave him leave, he would almost regret
the want of an occasion to deserve his feather and cockade. Your
note has been communicated to Madame de Montelieu; but as she
is engaged with a dying aunt, I have not yet seen her. Madame
Dagaisseau has hastily left us; the last decrees seemed to give the <HI>emi∣grés</HI>
only the option of starving abroad or hanging at home; yet she
has ventured into France, on some faint glimpse of clemency for the
women and children. Madame de Bouillon does not appear to move.
Madame de Stael, whom I saw last week at Rolle, is still uncertain
where she shall drop her burthen; but she must soon resolve, for the
young lady or gentleman is at the door;
<Q>—Demanding life, impatient for the skies.</Q>
By this time you have joined the Ladies Spencer and Duncannon,
whom I beg leave to salute with the proper shades of respect and
tenderness. You may, if you please <HI>be, belle comme un ange;</HI> but
I do not like your comparison of the archangel. Those of Milton,
with whom I am better acquainted at present than with Guido, are
all masculine manly figures, with a great sword by their side, and
six wings folding round them. The heathen goddesses would please
me as little. Your friend is less severe than Minerva, more decent
than Venus, less cold than Diana, and not quite so great a vixen as
the ox-eyed Juno. To express that infallible mixture of grace,
sweetness, and dignity, a new race of beings must be invented, and
I am a mere prose narrator of matter of fact. Bess is much nearer
the level of a mortal, but a mortal for whom the wisest man, his∣toric
<PB N="699" REF="720"/>
or medical, would throw away two or three worlds, if he had
them in his possession. From the aforesaid Bess I have received
three marks of kind remembrance, from the foot of St. Bernard,
with an exquisite monument of art and friendship, from Turin,
and finally from Milan, with a most valuable insertion from the
Duchess. At birds in the air it is difficult to take aim, and I fear
or hope that I shall sustain some reproaches on your not finding this
long epistle at Florence. I will mark it N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.; and why should
I despair of my future since I can say with truth, that since
your departure I have not spent so agreeable a morning. To each
of the dear little Caro's pray deliver nine kisses for me, which shall
be repaid on demand. My best compliments to Mr. Pelham, if he
is with you.</P>

<P>HAD I not given previous notice of my own unworthiness, the
plea of being an old incorrigible offender would serve only to
aggravate my guilt; it is still sufficiently black, and I can patiently
hear every reproach, except the cruel and unjust imputation of hav∣ing
forgotten my fair friends of the Arno and the Tyber. They
would indeed have been less present to my thoughts, had I main∣tained
a regular <HI>weekly</HI> correspondence; since, by the effect of my
negligence, not a <HI>day</HI> has elapsed without a serious, though fruitless,
resolution of writing by the very next post. What may have some∣what
contributed, besides original sin, to this vile procrastination, is
the course of events that has filled this abominable winter. As long
as the poor King's fate was on suspense, one waited from post to post,
<PB N="700" REF="721"/>
between hope and fear, and when the blow was struck, even Shake∣speare's
language was inadequate to express our grief and indigna∣tion.
I have never approved the execution of Charles the First; yet
Charles had invaded, in many respects, the ancient constitution of
England, and the question had been judged in the field of Naseby
before it was tried in Westminster-hall. But Louis had given and
suffered every thing. The cruelty of the French was aggravated by
ingratitude, and a life of innocence was crowned by the death of a
saint, or, what is far better, of a virtuous prince, who deserves our
pity and esteem. He might have lived and reigned, had he pos∣sessed
as much active courage as he was endowed with patient forti∣tude.
When I read the accounts from home, of the universal grief
and indignation which that fatal event excited, I indeed gloried in
the character of an Englishman. Our national fame is now pure
and splendid; we have nobly stood forth in the common cause of
mankind; and although our armaments are somewhat slow, I still
persuade myself that we shall give the last deadly wound to the Gallic
hydra. The King of Prussia is likewise slow, and your poor friend,
the Duke of Brunswick, is now not censured but forgotten. We
turn our eyes to the Prince of Cobourg and his Austrians, and it
must be confessed, that the deliverance of Holland and Brabant from
such a dragon as Dumourier is a very tolerable employment for the
month of March. These blossoms of the spring will be followed,
it may be fairly hoped, by the fruits of summer; and in the mean∣while
the troubles of Paris, and the revolt of the provinces, may
promote, by the increase of anarchy, the restoration of order. I
see that restoration through a dark cloud; but if France be lost, the
rest of Europe, I believe and trust, will be saved. But amidst the
hurricane, I dare not fix my eyes on the <HI>Temple.</HI> So much for po∣litics,
which now engross the waking and sleeping thoughts of every
feeling and thinking animal. In this country we are tranquil, and I
believe safe, at least for this summer; though peace has been pur∣chased
<PB N="701" REF="722"/>
chased at some expence of national honour, of the old reputation of
Swiss courage, we have crouched before the tiger, and stroked him
till he has sheathed his claws, and ceased for a moment to roar.
My journey to England this year must depend on the events of the
campaign; as I am fully resolved rather to remain quiet another
autumn and winter in my sweet habitation, than to encounter the
dangers of the sea and land. I envy the pleasures which you and
your companions have enjoyed at Florence and Rome; nor can I
decide which have tasted the most perfect delight, those to whom
such beauties were new, or those to whom they were familiar.
A fine eye, correct judgment, and elegant sensibility, are requisite
to qualify the studious traveller; and these gifts have been liberally
dispensed among the Ouchy caravan. But when you have been
gratified, though not satiated, with the Hesperian prospect, to what
fortunate clime will you direct your footsteps? Have we any hopes
of meeting (for my journey, at all events, would be late) in the
shades, or rather in the sunshine, of Ouchy? Should Mount Cenis
be still imperious, you have trampled on St. Bernard in a more ri∣gorous
season; and whatsoever may be the state of the world, the
Pays de Vaud will afford you a secure asylum, or a pleasant station.
I rejoice to hear of Lady Besborough's improvement. Will that
new title make any difference in the plan? Is the Duchess very
impatient to revisit England? Except some trifling considerations
of children, &amp;c. all countries may be indifferent to her; as she is
sure of being loved and admired in all. I am anxious and impatient
to learn the result of your counsels; but I feel myself unworthy of
a regular correspondence, and am not desirous of heaping fresh coals
of fire on my head.</P>
<P>I am happy to find that you forgive and pity my friend Necker,
against whom you all entertained some Versailles prejudices. As his
heart has been always pure, he cannot feel remorse; but as his con∣duct
<PB N="702" REF="723"/>
has been unsuccessful, he is penetrated with grief and regret.
Madame de Stael has written to me from England; she likes the
country, but means to fly over again in May.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>ROLLE, <DATE>February 23d, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not merely congratulate your Lordship's promotion to an office
which your abilities have long deserved. My satisfaction does
not arise from an assurance of the wisdom and vigour which admi∣nistration
will derive from the support of so respectable an ally. But
as a friend to government in general, I most sincerely rejoice that
you are now armed in the common cause against the most dangerous
fanatics that have ever invaded the peace of Europe; against the
new barbarians, who labour to confound the order and happiness of
society; and who, in the opinion of thinking men, are not less the
enemies of subjects than of kings. The hopes of the wise and
good are now fixed on the success of England; and I am persuaded
that my personal attachment to your Lordship will be amply gra∣tified
by the important share which your counsels will assume in that
success. I could wish that some of your former associates possessed
sufficient strength of mind to extricate themselves from the toils of
prejudice and party. But I grieve that a man, whom it is im∣possible
for me not to love and admire, should refuse to obey the
voice of his country; and I begin to fear that the powerful genius
of Mr.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A town between Lausanne and Geneva, where M. Necker then resided.</NOTE>, instead of being useful, will be adverse to the public
service. At this momentous crisis we should enlist our whole force
<PB N="703" REF="724"/>
of virtue, ability, and spirit; and without any view to his private
advantage, I could wish that * * * might be properly
stationed in some part of the line.</P>
<P>Mr. Necker, in whose house I am now residing on a visit of
some days, wishes me to express the sentiments of esteem and con∣sideration
which he entertains for your Lordship's character. As a
friend to the interest of mankind, he is warmly attached to the wel∣fare
of Great Britain, which he has long revered as the first, and
perhaps as the last asylum of genuine liberty. His late eloquent
work, <HI>Du pouvoir executif,</HI> which your Lordship has assuredly read,
is a valuable testimony of his esteem for our constitution; and the
testimony of a sagacious and impartial stranger may have taught
some of our countrymen to value the political blessings which they
have been tempted to despise.</P>
<P>I cherish a lively hope of being in England, and of paying my
respects to your Lordship before the end of the summer: but the
events of the year are so uncertain, and the sea and land are encom∣passed
with so many difficulties and dangers, that I am doubtful
whether it will be practicable for me to execute my purpose.</P>
<P>I am, my Lord, most respectfully, and your Lordship will permit
me to add most affectionately, your most faithful humble servant.</P>
