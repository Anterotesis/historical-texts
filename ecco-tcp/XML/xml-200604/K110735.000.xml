<P>PARDON me, Mighty Prince, that in the Crowd of Your Joy∣ful and Devoted <HI>Britons,</HI> one of an obscure Fame presumes to lay his <HI>Humble Offering</HI> at Your Feet.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>MOST NOBLE ORDER of the GARTER;</HI> which, from its first Institution, has been constantly worn by Persons of the highest Birth, and most illustrious Merit.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
IF the <HI>Stile</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> in which it is treated, were proportionable to the Dig∣nity of the Subject, there would need no Apology for this Dedication. For to whom, next to the <HI>Great Sovereign</HI> of the <HI>Garter,</HI> whose true <HI>Heir</HI> You are, in all manner of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> could this Treatise have re∣course for Protection, but to Your Royal Highness, who are the Premier <HI>Knight of this Most Noble Order,</HI> and the standing <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Or∣nament</HI> of it.</P>

<PB REF="5"/>
Every <HI>Briton</HI> seems new Born, and to have borrow'd fresh Influence from its Glorious Presence.</P>
<P>THE Godlike Virtues of Your Royal Father, are not to be excelled; and should we venture to express an Equality, it can only be the Appearance of Your Royal Highnes's imitating so Great a Pattern.</P>
<P>AS He is Wise and Good beyond Praise, so has He a Title to the Hearts of His People beyond Question; which stands Confirmed by the highest Instances of Di∣vine Providence, as well as the incontestible Authori∣ties of Temporal Laws: On these Foundations, what glo∣rious Prospects may we not

<P>IT were easy to dwell on this Subject, were it not wasting Moments of much more concern to Your Roy∣al Highness, than what I am able to Express.</P>
<P>MAY Your Royal High∣ness long Live to Adorn this <HI>MOST NOBLE ORDER,</HI> and to support the Crown, by a bountiful and flourishing Issue, that there may never want one of Your Royal Line to sit on the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THose who are acquainted with Mr. <HI>Ashmole</HI>'s <HI>History of the most Noble Order of the Garter,</HI> will easily satisfy themselves; that no Pains or Industry was wanting to Perfect and Complete so Vo∣luminous a Work: He had the Encourage∣ment of a very gracious Prince, and the use of publick Records, more particularly the se∣veral Books of the <HI>Order,</HI> with the As∣sistance of several MSS wrote by the Offi∣cers of Arms, who bore Part in the Cere∣monies, or went on Embassies to Stranger Kings, Princes, &amp;c. and by their constant Observations, were familiarly versed in all its Laws and Customs.</P>
<P>These were very great helps to him, and it must be confessed his own elaborate Study had not less owing to it. There is nothing that has relation to this <HI>most Noble Or∣der,</HI> which he has not touched on; and indeed
<PB REF="8"/>
it is a Work so very copious, that he does himself acknowledge he has inserted some things of little importance; which he desires may be considered to be done, to gratify some few, who have a more immediate concern therein.</P>
<P>The Reader will in this Treatise find little else omitted: A very painful and exact A∣bridgment has been made, many Corrections of the Author's, which he saw before his Death, and left among his other Books in his Li∣brary at <HI>Oxford,</HI> are here carefully al∣tered; some Additions are made, a List continued, of the several <HI>Knights-Com∣panions,</HI> as well as Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> for above forty Years; and the Coats of Arms of abundance of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> visibly corrected from good Authorities; and every distinct Chapter treated of at large; so that this Work has not been compleated but at great Labour as well as Expence, which could not have been supported, but for the Encouragement some of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> of the <HI>most Noble Order</HI> were pleased to give it; as well in their Subscriptions, as in the good Opinion they seemed to Express of the Design.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was, undoubtedly, a good Sentiment in the first Collector of this Learned Work, to introduce, as well as a Discourse of <HI>Knighthood</HI> in general, a Treatise of all the several <HI>Orders</HI> that have prevail'd in other Parts of the World; for these in their Rise and Institutions, having a relative Sense to the particular Subject he was to illustrate, seemed to afford him a very good Opportunity of doing it, by building on so convenient a Foundation.</P>
<P>I shall therefore, (tho' much more confin'd to bre∣vity) follow the same Method, making it serve as a proper Introduction; there being many Things in the voluminous Original, which I conceive may with less Inconveniency be dispenc'd with.</P>
<P>IT was a constant Maxim in all well-regulated Go∣vernments, to give a just Encouragement to Merit, and this by proportioning Rewards to the Service done; for Merit must be suppos'd to consist in the Performance
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
of some Vertuous or Heroick Action, directed for the publick Good: And as Vertue is either Mili∣tary or Civil, so the Distribution of Rewards is diffe∣rent; either by bestowing Degrees and Titles of Ho∣nour, or by Donations of Wealth; so that in either Construction, Vertue may have its proper and suitable Reward.</P>
<P>BUT the proper Reward of Military <HI>Vertue,</HI> is Ho∣nour: (to which distinct Head this Work is confin'd.) Honour, which <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls the <HI>Greatest of exteriour Goods:</HI> And being an Object of a nobler Ambition than the Accumulation of Wealth, is principally the Aim of that <HI>Vertue</HI> we understand by <HI>Valour;</HI> which springs from more generous Spirits, and hath been the constant Foundation of raising Men to the highest Eminence of Glory, and superiour Dignity.</P>
<P>BUT that Fame might not lose it self in an unbounded Notion, it was at length thought fit to reduce Honour into Form and Order, by investing the Person meriting with some particular Title or Appellation of Excellence, (the Original of all Nobility;) of which Knighthood, as it hath been accounted the most suitable Reward to the greatest Vertue, so it hath been esteemed the chief and primary Honour among many Nations.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> held Honour and Vertue in that Esteem, that they deify'd, and dedicated Temples to them: They made them so contiguous in their Situation, that there was no other Passage to that of Honour, but thro' the Temple of Vertue, mystically admonishing, that Honour was not to be attained by any other Way.</P>
<P>IN several of the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins we see Honour and Vertue represented together in one Reverse, and in one Medal; the Face of Honour so shadows that of Vertue, that but a little of it appears, <HI>Honour being the more illustri∣ous of the two; and where we behold any Person outwardly adorned with it, we are to judge him inwardly endued with Vertue, inasmuch as Honour is his due, and justly bestowed upon him.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. IN tracing the Original of Knighthood, we are not so vain to say, with the <HI>French,</HI> that S. <HI>Michael</HI> was the <HI>premier Chevalier;</HI> yet thus much we may assert, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tis near as ancient as Valour and Heroic Vertue, not∣withstanding the Ceremonies and Circumstances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have varied according to several Ages and Nations: And therefore, with much Probability, we may derive the
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
Original of Military Honour from the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Greeks;</HI> among whom, as Knights of great Renown, were <HI>Hector, Troilus, Aene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Antenor, Agamemnon, Me∣nelaus, Pel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, Tydeus,</HI> &amp;c. And thus <HI>Homer</HI> uses the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the same Sense as <HI>Eques</HI> was afterwards among the <HI>Latins.</HI></P>

<P>'Mong whom thus <HI>Nestor</HI> spake, that honour'd Knight.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. UPON a more substantial Basis we shall descend to the <HI>Romans;</HI> among whom, in the very Infancy of their Military Glory, a Society of Knights was instituted, immediately after their Union with the <HI>Sabines. Romulus</HI> inrolled <HI>Centuriae tres Equitum,</HI> three Centuries of Knights, out of the chiefest Families, whom he ap∣pointed to be his Life-guard, and called them <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leres,</HI> from their Activity and Dispatch in Martial Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> made an Addition to these Centu∣ries; the like did <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> who ordained, that those who should succeed in that Body, should be elected <HI>ex censu, viz.</HI> from a considerable and certain Valuation of their Estates, who had the greatest Cens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and were of the most Noble Families, says <HI>Dyonys. Ha∣licarn.</HI> And soon after, the Equestrian Class began to be formed and constituted one of the three Orders of the Commonwealth, which were thus rank'd, according to <HI>Livy: Senatus, Ordo Equestris &amp; Plebs;</HI> which in the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Literal Notes is set down after this Manner: CON. SEN. E. ORD. P. Q. R. And forasmuch as this Degree is placed between the <HI>Patricians,</HI> or Senators, and the <HI>Plebeians,</HI> it answers exactly the State of our Knights between the Nobility and Commonalty: And from this Order, to the Height of Nobility which resided in the Senators, was the Way prepared; <HI>Junius Brutus</HI> being the first who was raised to a Senator from the Equestrian Order.</P>
<P>IT was a Constitution, as old as <HI>Tib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rius</HI>'s Reign, that none should be admitted, unless Free-born, or a Gentle∣man for three Generations; and, indeed, for a long Time none were elected Knights but the best Sort of Gentlemen, and Persons of Extraction, as was the il∣lustrious <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cenas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avis regibus ortns eques, <HI>Mart.</HI></P>
<P>who aspired no higher, not out of any Incapacity of attaining greater Honours, but that he desired them not, says <HI>Paterculus:</HI> Yet at length, thro' Corruption of Times, <HI>Plebeians</HI> and Freedmen being too frequently re∣ceived into this Degree (too near a Parallel among the Knights of this Age) occasion'd their Power to grow less and less, 'till it shrunk to nothing; so that the Pla∣ces and Offices of Judges which they before had execu∣ted, became conferrable upon the <HI>Publicans.</HI> And when <HI>Cicero</HI> was Consul, <HI>anno ab urbe conditi</HI> 690, the Equestrian Order stood in need of Re-establishment, whereupon they were then incorporated into that Commonwealth in the third Degree, all Acts passing <HI>in the Name of the Senate, the People of</HI> Rome, <HI>and the Equestrian Order.</HI></P>
<P>They often enjoy'd Abroad the Government of several Provinces, whereof <HI>Egypt</HI> had this peculiar to itself, that none of the Senators were admitted, but only those of the Equestrian Order, whose Decrees <HI>Augustus</HI> com∣manded to be had in like Regard, as if the Magistrates of <HI>Rome,</HI> or Kings, Consuls, or Praetors, had pronoun∣ced them.</P>
<P>AS a Mark of Eminence, they had the Titles of <HI>Splendidi</HI> and <HI>Illustres</HI> bestowed upon them, and some∣times have been called <HI>most sacred</HI> Knights.</P>
<P>AND besides other Privileges, they had Seats with the Senators in the <HI>Circus Maximus;</HI> and by the <HI>Roscian</HI> Law, sat next them in the Theatres: They had likewise a College called <HI>Collegium Equitum;</HI> and Temples were dedicated to the Goddess <HI>Fortune,</HI> under the Title of <HI>Equestri Fortunae.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING shewn the Dignity and Honours of the E∣questrian Order among the <HI>Romans,</HI> we shall now touch upon the Degrees of Knighthood which have been Personal, and may be comprehended under the Modern Title of <HI>Equites Aurati,</HI> or <HI>Milites Simplices,</HI> (as distin∣guish'd from the several Orders of Chivalry, instituted in Christendom.) In the Circumstance of whose Crea∣tion we confess, nothing in the <HI>Roman Ordo Equestris</HI> hath place, tho' that might be the Ground and Original of the Dignity, and one common End in both, namely, the Pursuit of Military Exploits, and Service in the Wars.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
<P>§. 4. OF the Degrees of Knighthood. We shall first of the <HI>Monozons, i. e.</HI> Knights begirt with the Military Girdle, a Custom devolved to the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI> from ancient Times, and from them to After-Ages.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> notes, <HI>That the late Emperors conferred the Dignity af Knighthood with the Military Girdle instead of all other Arms, because that Part more eminent amongst them girdeth, supporteth, and adorneth the rest;</HI> whence <HI>Selden</HI> calls this Girding the most essential part of the Cere∣mony. Nor do we find among the various Ceremonies of <HI>Knighthood</HI> any that have continued so constant in Practice as the endowing with Girdle and Sword, Or∣naments proper to the Dignity and Marks of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> with which the Statues and Portraitures of <HI>Knights,</HI> on their Grave-stones have been adorned.</P>
<P>FOR as at this Day <HI>Knights</HI> are styled <HI>Equites Aurati,</HI> from the Golden Spurs, heretofore put on at their Creation, so were they more anciently <HI>Singulo Miletari donati,</HI> in respect, when any one was <HI>Knighted,</HI> he was not only smitten with the Sword, but invested with Sword and Belt, yet retain'd at the creating our Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> as the old Formulary thus hath it; Then shall the King of great Favour take the Sword, and gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quire therewith.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Baccalaurei</HI> or Knights Batchelors, are to be consider'd, who are indifferently styled <HI>Chevaliers, Milites, Equites Aurati,</HI> and <HI>Knights.</HI> This Degree is truly accounted the first of all Military Dignity, and the Foundation of all Honours in our Nation, and is deri∣ved from, if not the same with that immediately pre∣ceding. For as the Ceremony of a gentle Touch on the Shoulder with the flat Side of the Sword hath been since used, instead of girting with the Sword and Belt, (especially in Times of War, or in Haste) as an Initia∣tion into the Military Order; so on the contrary, it is not unusual now-adays, for the Prince, at least <HI>Gladi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> if not <HI>Cingulo donare;</HI> for he oftentimes bestows the Sword upon the Person he <HI>Knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Miraeus</HI> gives them the Epithet <HI>Aurati,</HI> from the Pri∣vilege of wearing Gold upon their Swords and Spurs, omitting <HI>Tiraquel</HI>'s fanciful Distinction between <HI>Miles</HI> and <HI>Eques Auratus,</HI> who allows the former to signify a Knight Noble before, and the other to deno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e one whom we call a Knight and no Gentleman, or applicable to the <HI>Neapo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an</HI> Gentlemen, (usually called <HI>Cavali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri)</HI> who
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
are all styled <HI>Equites,</HI> tho' they never have attained the Knightly Dignity.</P>
<P>THE third Sort were <HI>Knights Banerets,</HI> who so well de∣serv'd in the Wars, that they were afterwards permitted to use <HI>Vexillum quadratum,</HI> a square Banner, whence they were called <HI>Equites vexillarii,</HI> or <HI>Chevaliers a Buniere</HI> from the Dutch <HI>Banerheere,</HI> Lord or Master of the Banner.</P>
<P><HI>Camden</HI> conceives this Title first devis'd by K. <HI>Edward</HI> 3. in Recompence of Martial Prowess; a Recital of which Dignity is mention'd in a Patenr 20 <HI>E.</HI> 3. to <HI>John Coup∣land,</HI> for his Service, in taking <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> Pri∣soner. But it was much more ancient with us, as well as in <HI>France;</HI> and they had particular Robes, and other Ornaments given them from the Crown, <HI>ad apparatum suum pro militia, tanquam pro Baneretto, a Rege suscipienda,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>viz. ad unum Tunicam,</HI> &amp;c. after which is set down the particular Robes, and other Ornaments appointed for his Creation.</P>
<P>To shew this Dignity yet more ancient, there is the Evidence of a Writ in K. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d's Time, for furnishing <HI>Thomas Bardolf</HI> with the Robes of a <HI>Baneret.</HI> It is an Ho∣nour esteemed the last among the Greatest, <HI>viz. Nobilitum Majorum,</HI> or the First of the Second Rank; and is placed in the Middle between the <HI>Barons</HI> and the other <HI>Knights;</HI> in which respect the <HI>Baneret</HI> may be called <HI>Vexillarius minor,</HI> as if he were the lesser <HI>Banner-Bearer;</HI> to the End he might be so differenced from the Greater, namely the <HI>Baron,</HI> to whom the Right of bearing a square Banner doth belong.</P>
<P>BUT there are some remarkable differences between these Knights and Knights-Batchelors; as in the Occa∣sions and Circumstances of their Creations, the <HI>Baneret</HI> being not Created, unless at a Time when the King's Standard is erected, and that he bears his own Banner in the Field; whilst the <HI>Knight-Batchelor</HI> follows that which is anothers.</P>
<P>THIS farther difference is observed between them, that the <HI>Knight-Baneret</HI> had so many Gentlemen his Ser∣vants at Command, as that he could raise a Banner, and make up a Company of Soldiers to be maintained at his Table, and with his own Pay: But the <HI>Knight-Batchelor</HI> had not sufficient for this, and therefore marched under the Banner of another; and the Wages of the <HI>Baneret</HI> were double.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="15"/>
N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>XT to these, we are to mention Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> which is a Degree that hath the Investiture and Title of Knight, with an additional Denomination, derived from Part of the Ceremony of his Creation. It is the general receiv'd Opinion, that our K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. first instituted these Knights, which is justify'd by Sir <HI>John Froisard,</HI> who says he created 46 of them at his Coronation, chusing them from such, as were either his Favorites, or had pretensions to it from their per∣sonal Merits, or Services.</P>
<P>BUT if the Ceremonies and Circumstances of their Creation be well consider'd, it may be inferr'd, that he rather restor'd the ancient way of making Knights, than Instituted them; and consequently that the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> are really no other than <HI>Knights-Batchelors;</HI> that is, such as are created with those Ceremonies, wherewith <HI>Knights-Batchelors</HI> were formerly created by Ecclesiasticks: But some of them having been laid aside, were then brought again into Use, and made peculiar to this Degree, and since continued to them upon some solemn and great Occasion.</P>
<P>AT the first View they look like a distinct Order of Knighthood; but cannot be so accounted, because they have no Statutes assigned them, nor are in Case of Va∣cancy, supply'd, (the Essentials of distinct Orders) nor do they wear their Robes beyond the Time of that Oc∣casion upon which they were created; as chiefly, the Coronation of a King or Queen, the Creation of a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the like; whereas also their Number is uncertain, and always at the Pleasure of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Favine</HI> calls them Knights of the Crown, because, to distinguish them from Esquires, they wore upon their Left Shoulder an Escutcheon of Black Silk embroider'd with three Crowns of Gold; but therein he mistakes, for they never used only a Silk Lace, and the Jewel they wore was made of Gold, containing three Crowns, with this Motto <HI>Tria juncta in una,</HI> hanging down under the left Arm at a Carnation Ribbon worn cross the Body.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to the Degree of Baronets, who seem allied to Knighthood, by having granted them the Ad∣dition of <HI>Sir</HI> to be set before their Names: But this gives them not the Dignity of Knighthood; nor can they properly be flyled Knights, until they be actually Knighted.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
IT is a Degree erected <HI>Anno</HI> 9. <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. and the Grant made by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> It is Hereditary to them, and the Heirs Male of their Bodies lawfully begotten, for ever; and by a subsequent Decree of the said King, Precedence is granted to them before all Banerets, except such as should be made by the King under his Standard, dis∣play'd in an Army Royal in open War, and the King personally present, and next to and immediately after the younger Sons of Viscount and Barons.</P>
<P>THE Ground for erecting this Degree was partly Martial; for tho' themselves were not enjoined personal Service in the Wars, yet each Baronet was to maintain thirty Foot Soldiers for three Years in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the rate of Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Day, for the Defence of that Kingdom, and chiefly to secure the Plantation of <HI>Ulster.</HI></P>
<P>THEY were at least to be descended from a Grand∣father, on the Father's Side, that bore Arms, and had a Revenue of 1000 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> or Lands of old Rents of equal Value with 1000 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI> of improv'd Lands, or at least two Parts of three of such Estate in Possession; the other third in Reversion Expectant upon one Life held only in Jointure.</P>
<P>THE Year after, King <HI>James</HI> I. added some new Pri∣vileges and Ornaments, <HI>viz.</HI> to Knight those already made that were no Knights; and the Heirs hereafter of every Baronet should, at the Age of One and Twenty Years, receive Knighthood; likewise that all Baronets might bear in Canton, or in an Inescutcheon, the Arms of <HI>Ulster;</HI> and farther, to have place in the Armies of the King in the Gross, near about the Royal Standard.</P>
<P>SINCE the Institution of Baronets in <HI>England,</HI> there have been made divers in <HI>Ireland</HI> after the like Form: And the Knights of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> were ordained in Imitation of Baronets in <HI>England</HI> by the said King <HI>James, A. D.</HI> 1622. for the Planting that Coun∣try by <HI>Scotch</HI> Colonies, and the Degree made likewise Hereditary.</P>
<P>THESE latter wear an Orange Tawny Ribbon as their Badge, to distinguish them from other Knights; and it appears, there was an Intention, 1627. to move his then Majesty, that all Baronets and Knights Bachelors might wear Ribbons of several Colours, some Badge or Jewel, in such Sort as did the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> to distinguish the one from the other: But that Matter dropt.</P>

<P>§. 5. WE shall now observe the Etymology of <HI>Eques, Miles, Chevalier, Ritter,</HI> and <HI>Sir.</HI> The <HI>Grecians</HI> had a Title of Honour equivalent to the Signification of <HI>Eques</HI> in the <HI>Latin,</HI> from <HI>Equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> an Horse, because one Part of the Ceremony, whereby this Honour became confer∣red, was the giving of an Horse; or because having an Horse at the Publick Charge, they received the Stipend of an Horseman to serve in the Wars, Horses being Symbols of War, <HI>Bello armantur equi.</HI> It is to be noted, That the Degree of Knighthood in the Dia∣lects of other Nations hath rhe same Derivation: For in the <HI>French,</HI> a Knight is called <HI>Chevalier;</HI> in the <HI>Ger∣man, Ridder,</HI> or <HI>Ritter, q. d. Rider;</HI> so the <HI>Gheslagen Ridder</HI> is interpreted, <HI>The dubbed Knight;</HI> in the <HI>Italian,</HI> it is <HI>Cavagliero;</HI> in the old <HI>British, Morchog;</HI> concerning which, hear one of <HI>Jeffery Chaucer</HI>'s Scholars.</P>
<LG>
<L>Eques ab Equo is said of very right,</L>
<L>And Chevalier is said of Chevalrie,</L>
<L>In which a Rider called is a Knight;</L>
<L>Arragoners done also specifie</L>
<L>Caballiero through all that Partie,</L>
<L>Is Dame of Worship, and so took his 'ginning</L>
<L>Of Spurs of Gold, and chiefly Riding.</L>
</LG>
<P>AND tho' the Word <HI>Miles</HI> signified at first any legally inrolled for the War, which Inrolment was twofold, <HI>Honoraria</HI> and <HI>Vulgaris;</HI> yet upon the Decay of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire, upon the Irruption of the innumerable Forces of the <HI>Alani, Goths, Vandals,</HI> &amp;c. which consisted in Horse, their Foot was rendred useless. <HI>Miles</HI> was no longer said of him that served on Foot in the Wars, but began to be properly spoken of the Horseman; whence it came into Vogue, That among the Titles of Nobili∣ty, he who had that of <HI>Miles</HI> bestowed on him, was un∣derstood to be Horseman, or <HI>Eques,</HI> that is, of the E∣questrian Dignity.</P>
<P><HI>Selden</HI> observes <HI>Miles</HI> to be equivocal: and that in the old feodal Laws of the Empire it signify'd a Gentleman, as the Word Gentleman is signify'd in <HI>Nobilis;</HI> and with us it hath been frequently used to denote both Gentle∣men, and Knights; for <HI>Milites</HI> denotes Gentlemen, or great Freeholders, and not dubbed Knights, <HI>viz.</HI> such who hold by Knights Service from a Lord of
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
a Mannour, and such who are chosen from the several Counties to serve in the High Courts of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Miles,</HI> even in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times, denoted sometimes a Dignity. But about the Year 1046, becoming a Title of Honour, it is since most generally appropriated to Persons who have received Knighthood correspondent to <HI>Eques</HI> and <HI>Chevalier,</HI> tho' indeed less proper; in regard Knighthood is the Dignity of Horsemanship, and the Tenure of Lands by Knights Fees here in <HI>England,</HI> anciently called <HI>Regale Servitium,</HI> is in truth Horse Ser∣vice; and the Tenants such as served the King on Horseback in Wars, are Gentlemen at least (if not of Noble Extraction.)</P>
<P><HI>Minshew</HI> says, the <HI>Equites,</HI> which heretofore followed and accompanied the Emperor, are, in the <HI>German</HI> Tongue, called <HI>Knechtes,</HI> that is, Servitors, or Ministers; but <HI>Camden</HI> says, <HI>Knecht,</HI> in <HI>Saxon Cniht,</HI> was in far more ancient Times accepted as an honorary Title; and, among the old <HI>Germans,</HI> signify'd a Person arm'd with Spear and Lance, (the Ensigns of their Knighthood) as in After-Times such were, among other Nations, adorned with a Girdle and Belt, since called <HI>Equites aurati,</HI> and sometimes simply <HI>Milites.</HI></P>
<P>THE Addition <HI>Sir</HI> to the Names of all Knights Bane∣rets, Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> and Batchelor Knights, pro∣nounced at the Time when they are created, with this Compellation: <HI>Arise, Sir John,</HI> or <HI>Sir Thomas,</HI> &amp;c. is accounted Parcel of their Style, which the Banerets en∣joy by virtue of a Clause in their Patent. It is a Con∣traction of the Old <HI>French</HI> Sire, taken for Seigneur, or Lord, from the <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But how it came to be first given, we cannot find; nevertheless, our <HI>English</HI> Writers have bestowed it upon the major Part of the Nobility, after they had been received into the Order of Knighthood; and in the Life of St. <HI>Thomas Becker,</HI> written about the Time of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. we meet with the Title prefix'd to the Names of the four Knights, who slew the said St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>

<P>§. 6. THE Ensigns of the Equestrian Order among the <HI>Romans,</HI> by which they were made, was a Publick Horse, or a Gold Ring; yet still, to those who had Equestrian Cense, the Horse was the ancienter Badge of the two; but when thro' the Multitude of these Knights no Publick Horses were assigned, but to such who were ready to enter upon Military Service, and to
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
fight in the Legions, such were called <HI>Legionary Knights,</HI> to distinguish them from the rest, who had only receiv'd the Honour of a Gold-Ring; for they were not all employ'd in Wars.</P>
<P>THE Censor (after the Institution of that Offiee <HI>ab urbe condita,</HI> 310.) and afterwards the Emperor, were the Persons who bestowed this <HI>Equus Militaris,</HI> or <HI>Pub∣licus,</HI> as it was called from the Annual Allowance, to keep him, which they gave unto those of known Ver∣tue and approv'd Life, compelling him to serve in the Wars, tho' against his Will; (but in the more ancient Method of Election, Constraint was not used.) And upon Negligence in the Care of these Horses, or any Blemish, Reproach, or Infamy, or Loss of Patrimony in the Knights, the Horses were not only taken away, but the Knights wholly disfranchis'd. <HI>Rosinus</HI> laying down the Manner and Order used in ejecting such Knights, adds, <HI>A Recital being made of all the Knights that were inrolled, those whose Names he omitted, were thereby un∣derstood to be depriv'd of that Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN they had served in the Wars the Time appoint∣ed by Law, it was the Custom to lead their Horses by the Bridle into the Forum, before the <HI>Duumvirs</HI> [Cen∣sors,] and giving an Account under whom and what Generals or Captains they had served; they were thereupon dismissed from farther Service in the Wars: An Example whereof <HI>Plutarch</HI> relates to have been given by <HI>Pompey</HI> himself.</P>
<P>BUT whereas among the <HI>Roman</HI> Inscriptions we find <HI>Equo publico honoratus donatus, ornatus,</HI> and <HI>exornatus,</HI> such is not to be construed to be of Equestrian Dignity, but only to have received the <HI>praemia militaria,</HI> with which the Emperors used to recompense some particular Ex∣ploit, by the Honour of such a Gift, according to <HI>Sal∣masius. Equus Publicus,</HI> by a wondrous, nevertheless an accustom'd Speech, among the <HI>Romans,</HI> is the Knight, <HI>qui equo publico meret.</HI> And <HI>qui equo publico donatus,</HI> the other deserving Person.</P>
<P>AS to the Ring: In <HI>Genesis</HI> we read of <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s taking off his Ring, and putting it upon <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Hand. When they came in Fashion with the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Senators at first wore Iron ones, which were accounted the Ensign of Military Vertue, received upon a Publick Account. Howbeit, in Process of Time, when Gold Rings were drawn into Use, none but Senators and Knights had
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
them. The Difference among the Rings of the three Orders in the State were, as <HI>Licetus</HI> observes, Gold Rings set with precious Stones were given to the Senators on∣ly; Plain Rings without Stones to the Knights, and Iron Rings to the <HI>Plebeians,</HI> or Free-born-men; inso∣much that <HI>Equestri dignitate donare,</HI> and <HI>annulo honorare,</HI> is a promiscuous Phrase in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> to give the Dignity of Knighthood; and at the Battle of <HI>Cannae,</HI> by the two Measures or Bushels of Gold Rings sent to <HI>Carthage,</HI> the Number of the <HI>Roman</HI> Knights there slain was computed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 7. AT length Freed-Men being created Knights, the <HI>Jus annulorum,</HI> the Right of wearing Gold Rings, became promiscuous.</P>
<P>AMONG the <HI>Germans,</HI> the Shield and Lance were ac∣counted the grand Badges of Military Honour, or Knighthood. This the <HI>Lombards,</HI> the <HI>Franks,</HI> and our Country-men, all descending out of <HI>Germany,</HI> used, and was to us (in the Opinion of Sir <HI>Hen. Spelman)</HI> the Foundation of the Knightly Order. Much like the ancient <HI>Germans</HI> was the Custom of making Knights among the <HI>Irish:</HI> And <HI>Favine</HI> notes the Shield and Lance were the proper Arms appertaining to a <HI>French</HI> Knight, which Esquires, <HI>Armigers,</HI> carried always after their Masters, Shields and Scutes (as they are vulgarly called) <HI>i. e.</HI> Equestrian Targets, inclining to an Oval, not Shields or Bucklers of Foot Soldiers.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Ensign and Ornament of Knightly Honour is, the <HI>Cingulum militare.</HI> or <HI>Balteus,</HI> which, <HI>Varro</HI> says, is <HI>Tuscan,</HI> signifying a military Girdle, which were garnished with great Buckles, Studs, and Rings of pure Gold, to shew their Dignity and Power in military Com∣mands; and with such a Belt, set with Pearls and precious Stones, young <HI>Athelstan</HI> was girded, when he receiv'd <HI>Knighthood</HI> from his Grandfather King <HI>Alfred.</HI> Our Knights were no less anciently known by these Belts, than by their gilt Swords, Spurs, &amp;c. Howbeit the Use now only appears in Knights of the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>To this Belt was also added a Sword, not of Ordinary Use; and therefore termed the Sword of a <HI>Knight,</HI> which was hallowed with great Ceremony.</P>
<P>ANOTHER eminent Badge is the Golden Spurs, where∣with, at the Time of their Creation, Knights Spurs were wont to be adorned; and to these, a little after the Conquest, were added far more and greater Oruaments. They were usually put on after the Person had been
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
presented to the Prince who gave the Honour, to signify, that the new-made Knight should not only declare his Valour by his Sword, but also by the Management of his Horse, which he should encourage and excite with his Spurs, to the carrying on his valiant Designs. These Spurs have been of that Esteem, that Knight Batchelors are latinized <HI>Equites aurati;</HI> among the <HI>Germans, Ritter dess Gulden Sporns;</HI> and with us heretofore, <HI>Knights of the Spurs:</HI> And several Families by the Name of <HI>Knight,</HI> bear for their Arms the Spurs on a Canton.</P>
<P>IT is farther certify'd among the Rights of a Knight Baneret, that upon the Account of his Knighthood he may wear gilt Spurs, as well as a gilt Sword; and that the Spurs are essential, may be collected from the De∣gradation of a Knight, where his gilt Spurs are first cut off with an Hatchet, the Case of Sir <HI>Andra Harcla.</HI> In the last Place is the Collar, an Ensign of Knightly Dig∣nity among the <HI>Germans, Gauls, Britons, Danes</HI> and <HI>Goths,</HI> among whom it was customary to wear them, as deno∣ting such as were remarkable for their Valour. But in lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Times, it was the peculiar Fashion of <HI>Knights</HI> among us to wear Golden Collars composed of <HI>S S.</HI> or other various Devices; so that those <HI>Monuments</HI> are known to be erected for <HI>Knights</HI> on whose Portraitures such Ornaments are found.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 8. THE Qualifications for Knighthood are princi∣pally three. 1. Merit, the bare mentioning whereof shall suffice here. 2. Birth, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Parties who enter thereinto ought first to make appear they be Gentlemen of three Paternal Descents, bearing Coat Armour; and much the same was the Law of the Em∣pire under <HI>Frederick</HI> 2. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1212. Some think it also insufficient, unless descended so by the Mother's Side; at least she must be a freed Woman. And, 3. Estate, which also serves to support the Dignity.</P>
<P>THUS Wealth was so much regarded among the <HI>Cha∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>donians,</HI> that those who were rich, bore the Name of Knights. It was Estate that entitled a Man to this Honour among the <HI>Romans;</HI> for the Censor might compel any Citizen equal to the Equestrian Cense, whom he thought fit to take that Order: And this consisted of 400000 Sesterces, <HI>i. e.</HI> 3025 l. of our Money.</P>
<P>AND as in <HI>Old Rome,</HI> so here in <HI>England,</HI> not long after the Conquest, they who held a Knights Fee, <HI>viz.</HI> 680 Acres of Land might claim it, says <HI>Camden.</HI> But it ap∣pears from <HI>Selden,</HI> that no certain Number, or Extent
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
of Acres, made a Knight's Fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>Temp. Hen.</HI> 3. and <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. and 1 <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. the <HI>Census militis</HI> was measured by 20 l. by the Year, or more; and by the Royal Pre∣rogative, some who held 15, then 20, at other times 30, then 40, and sometimes 50 l. Lands, were required to accept this Honour by Writs directed to the Sheriffs of the Counties, and were excused only by Reason of old Age, irrecoverable Weakness, Loss of Limbs, or being in Holy Orders; and upon all other Causes (if exempted) they paid a Fine, estimated according to the Nature of the Excuse, or length of Time given.</P>
<P>BUT in the promiscuous Course of Knighthood, where the Men of Wealth and Estate (whether otherwise worthy or not) became dignify'd; yet the Gate of Honour was not then shut against those, who wanting Riches, deserved well of their Country; for when Princes conferr'd such Dignities upon Men of narrow Fortunes, they usually bestowed with them annual Pen∣sions, or Lands, agreeable to the Judgment of the Au∣thor of the <HI>Division du monde,</HI> who saith that the Ho∣nour of Knighthood is not to be given any Person who hath not a considerable Estate, unless sufficient Means to support the Honour of the Order be also given with it.</P>
<P>THESE Pensions are frequently mention'd in our Rolls<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sometimes during Pleasure, and sometimes during the Life of the Knight, or till better Provision should be made for their Supports: Examples whereof are, Sir <HI>John Atte Lee,</HI> Sir <HI>Nele Loring,</HI> Sir <HI>John Walsh,</HI> Knights. The like Rewards our Kings gave to such whose Merit raised them to the Degree of a <HI>Ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ret,</HI> express'd in their Patents, <HI>ad manutenendum statum Baneretti, Pro sustentatione sua, ut ipse statum Baneretti melius manutenere possit, Pro statu suo manutenendo;</HI> or Words to the like Effect: Examples where of are, Sir <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas de Rokeley,</HI> Sir <HI>John Lysle,</HI> and Sir <HI>Roger de Swynerton,</HI> Banerets.</P>
<P>IT may be next consider'd who can make <HI>Knights;</HI> wherein it is apparent, that they who never were, and others who never could be <HI>Knights,</HI> have conferr'd this Dignity; yet 'tis to be understood, that Necessity and Custom hath in this Case the Force of a Law: For anci∣ently, <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> made <HI>Knights;</HI> so also do the <HI>Popes,</HI> and some Commonwealths; likewise our <HI>Queens.</HI> For the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> or the <HI>Heir apparent,</HI> tho' they be no <HI>Knights,</HI> may nevertheless do it, by reason they possess the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> and are therefore the Head and Chief of <HI>Chevalry,</HI> and consequent all the Power thereof is contained
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
in their Command. To conclude this Point<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Knighthood</HI> was always received from the Hands of another Person, either by Ceremony, or Diploma, except only the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> who Time out of Mind made them∣selves <HI>Knights;</HI> and this by Vertue of an old Law written in the <HI>Arragonian</HI> Tongue, as <HI>Ambrosias Morales</HI> repotts. <HI>And, to shew that no Man upon Earth hath any Power over him, he shall gird himself with the Sword made after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm of a Cross; and that Day can no other Man be Knighted.</HI></P>

<P>§. 9. Of the Ceremonies and Formalities used at the Conferring of Knighthood, the most ancient was per∣form'd by putting the Belt Ioose over the Shoulder, or girding it close about the Waste. The <HI>Bend</HI> in <HI>Armoury</HI> represents the one, and the <HI>Fess</HI> the other. The first Christian Kings at giving this Belt kissed the new Knight on the Left Cheek, saying, <HI>In the Honour of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I make you a Knight.</HI> It was called <HI>Osculum pacis,</HI> the Kiss of Favour, or Bro∣therhood, and is presumed to be the Accollade, or Cere∣mony of Imbracing, which <HI>Charles</HI> the Great used when he Knighted his Son <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bonair.</HI> It was in the Time of the same Emperor, the Way of Knighting by the <HI>Colaphum,</HI> or Blow on the Ear, used in Sign of sustaining future Hardships, which is thought to have been deriv'd from the Manner of Manumission of a Slave among the <HI>Romans;</HI> a Custom long after retained in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> Thus <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who was to be Knighted before he could be <HI>Emperor,</HI> at his being elected King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> received Knighthood by the Box of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ear, &amp;c. from <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia, A. D.</HI> 1247.</P>
<P>IN the Time of the <HI>Saxons</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> Knights re∣ceived their Institutions at the Hands of Great <HI>Prelates</HI> or <HI>Abbots;</HI> which, according to their Opinion, render'd them more auspicious. In the accomplishing of which Solem∣nity, they added many religious Ceremoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as Watch∣ing, Fasting, Bathing, and Consecrating the Sword; an Instance of which we have in <HI>Heward</HI> Lord of <HI>Brune,</HI> in in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> who received this Honour from <HI>Brand, Abbot</HI> of St. <HI>Edmundsbury.</HI> But not long after the Con∣quest, this Custom was restrained by a Synod a, <HI>Westmin∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, A.

<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
<HI>Whitsontide, anno</HI> 34 <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. cited by <HI>Selden</HI> and <HI>Camden.</HI> And these Formalities the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> not only here in <HI>England,</HI> but the <HI>French, Spaniards,</HI> and other Nations, observ'd, concluding from it, that decency of Habit was as well expected from them, as Integrity of Life, and purity of Manners. And the like religious Ceremony was heretofore observ'd in <HI>Spain</HI> at the Crea∣tion of Knights, whether <HI>Cavelleros de Espuela d' Orada,</HI> or <HI>Amados</HI> [our Knights Batchelors,] In this Form, the Person to be Knighted was bathed in the Evening, and presently laid in Bed; then cloathed in rich Robes, and led to the Church to perform his Vigils: That being over, and Mass heard, his Spurs were put on, and his Sword girt about him, then drawn out, and put into his Right Hand; whereupon the Oath was forthwith administred to him; which taken, he that bestowed the Dignity gave him <HI>una Pesconade,</HI> a Blow, or Stroke on the Neck, saying, God assist you in the Performance of your Promise.</P>
<P>THE Oath or Vow the Knights professed, was in ge∣neral, to relieve and protect Widows, the Fatherless, Oppressed and Miserable, and to defend the Church of God; which to keep and perform was esteem'd as meri∣torious, as to do all that a Monk, Frier, or Canon Regular should.</P>
<P>THERE is also mention (by Mr. <HI>Selden)</HI> of consecrating the Sword, offering it at the Altar, and receiving it again from thence, as an implicit Kind of taking an Oath. But as in Peace and great Leisure these tedious Ceremo∣nies were used, yet it was otherwise in Times of War, or on a Day of Battle, where Hurry and Throng of Affairs would not permit; and therefore, as well be∣fore the joining of Battle, as after Victory obtained, it was usual for the Prince or General in the Field, on Sight of the Army, to give those whom he thought fit to advance to that Honour (they humbly kneeling be∣fore him) a Stroke with a naked Sword flatwise upon their Shoulders, or else to touch their Heads or Shoul∣ders lightly, without any other Ceremony, except pronouncing <HI>Sis Eques in nomine Dei;</HI> to which he adds, <HI>Rise, Sir—Knight,</HI> or in the <HI>French, Sus,</HI> or <HI>Sois, Che∣valier, au nom de Dieu,</HI> which we commonly call Dubbing, the old <HI>English</HI> Word used for Creating [Consecrating] a Knight, from <HI>doopen</HI> to dip, by Bathing.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Manner of creating Knights Abroad was, by Royal Codicils, or Letters Patents (these the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
call <HI>Privilegios de Cavelleria)</HI> whereupon such Knights are intitled <HI>Equites Codicellares;</HI> and these were sent to such as dwelt in remote Countries, and sometimes, but rarely, extended so as to make the Degree heredi∣tary. There is one Example, that by the bare signi∣fication of Letter, without any Ceremonies or Patents under Seal; <HI>Philip</HI> IV. of <HI>Spain, Jan.</HI> 15. 1633. con∣ferr'd upon all the Captains that behav'd themselves valiantly in Defence of <HI>Mastricht</HI> (then lately besieg'd by the <HI>Hollanders)</HI> to those that were Gentlemen, the Title of Knights; and to others, that of Gentlemen.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly shew'd the various Forms of Crea∣tion of <HI>Knights Batchelors,</HI> I shall remark what <HI>Seld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> has observ'd of <HI>Knights Bannerets</HI> in later Times, wherein he that was advanc'd to that Honour in the Field, was in∣ducted between two Senior Knights with Trumpets be∣fore them, and the Heralds carrying a long Banner of his Arms, call'd a <HI>Penon;</HI> in which Manner being brou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht to the King or Lieutenant, who bidding him good Suc∣cess, the Tip of the Banner is cut off, that of an Obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it might become a Square, like the Banner of a Baron: This done, he returns to his Tent, conducted as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fore.

<HEAD>CAP. II. Of the Religious Orders of Knight∣hood in Christendom.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 1. THE Grounds and Causes of founding <HI>Socie∣ties</HI> or <HI>Knightly Orders,</HI> were several and different, tho' all terminated in one End. Among which, principally were these, <HI>First,</HI> A sincere Love to <HI>Honour,</HI> and therein chiefly to excite and pro∣mote <HI>Vertue</HI> by suitable Rewards; such was the Design of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> when he formed himself and other Martial Men into a Fellowship, which he stiled <HI>Knights of the Round Table. Secondly,</HI> To repress the Incursions and Robberies of the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> to vindicate the Oppressed, redeem the Enslaved, and to entertain and relieve Pilgrims and Strangers, which were Part of the Duties the <HI>Knights Hospitallers</HI> and <HI>Templars,</HI> &amp;c. stood engag'd in. A <HI>third</HI> Reason was, To Fight in Defence of the Christian Faith, against Pagans and Infidels; to enlarge the Christian Territories, and promote the Service of the Catholick Church: And indeed their Zeal very much advanced Christianity. <HI>Lastly,</HI> When Sovereign Princes perceived themselves embroiled in Wars or dangerous Factions, the erecting such an Order or Society was, that they might by such a Tye restore Peace, quiet all Jealousies, unite Affecti∣ons, and secure a lasting Friendship and powerful Assi∣stance, both for their own and their Country's Safety. And to this End were Badges of several Orders devised, as Pledges of Remembrance to quicken and establish their Friendship.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 2. THESE Orders are of Two Kinds, 1. <HI>Religious,</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastical;</HI> and, 2. <HI>Military,</HI> or <HI>Secular.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 3. THE Institutions of the latter Sort were after a while thought too weak to continue, if not sustained
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
by Religion and Piety; and too defective without ad∣joyning Ecclesiastical Persons thereunto. Therefore the Founders, considering Divine Assistance should con∣cur with Military Industry, began to dedicate these Or∣ders to the Honour and Worship of God, or to our Saviour, or to the blessed Virgin, or some other of the Saints, to gain the Protection and Favour of Heaven, more easily, as they thought, obtainable by the Prayers and Offices of the Clergy. Whereupon some in their Institution joyned Sacred Orders to their Military, and made Provision for Sacred Persons to pray for their Pro∣sperity at home, while they were engaged abroad. Hence King <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> III. at the first Institution of the <HI>Gar∣ter,</HI> appointed Thirteen Secular Canons, and Thirteen Vicars to attend the Celebration of Divine Offices. Up∣on the same Account certain Foundations of Divine Service were erected at <HI>Bug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> for the Order of the <HI>An∣nunciads;</HI> at <HI>Dijon,</HI> for the Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece;</HI> and at <HI>Mont St. Michael</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> for the Order of St. <HI>Michael.</HI></P>

redeem Christian Captives, hear Mass every Day, recite the Hours of the Cross, and to bear the five red Crosses in memory of our Saviour's Wounds. Their Rule was confirm'd by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> III. Upon the loss of the Holy Land, these Knights retired to <HI>Perugia</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> but retaining their white Habit, chang'd their Arms to a double <HI>red Cross. A.

<P>BEFORE the taking of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from the <HI>Saracens,</HI> certain Christian Merchants of <HI>Naples</HI> obtain'd leave from the Caliph of <HI>Egypt</HI> to erect a small and conve∣nient House, for the Entertainment of themselves and Countrymen, which they built before the Church of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre,</HI> together with a small Oratory. To them repair'd certain Canons of the Order of St. <HI>Augu∣stin,</HI> who built another Oratory; but the Confluence of Pilgrims growing great, they erected a large Ho∣spital, in the Place where our Saviour celebrated his last Supper, for the better accommodating devout Travellers, who for want of a Place to lodge in were often robb'd and murder'd: So that at length from their Charity and Hospitality, as also for that they took St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> for their Patron, they obtain'd that Title. It was instituted <HI>A. D.</HI> 1092. or according to others 1099. by <HI>Gerard,</HI> a Native of <HI>Thoulouse,</HI> who came to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the Time of <HI>Codsry</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> and built this Hospital (which became the first Seat of this Order) dedicated to St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> Bp. of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>

D.</HI> 1104. Their Duty was to fight against the Infidels, and they acknowledged Obedience to the Patriarch of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> but growing rich, they obtained from <HI>Rome</HI> to be absolved from that Obedience. Pope <HI>Gelasius</HI> II. or <HI>Calixtus</HI> II. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1120. confirmed their Rule of li∣ving; and <HI>Adrian</HI> IV. receiv'd them under the Protection of the Papal See, being likewise endowed with ample Privileges, and exempted from Payment of Tithes, by succeeding Popes, chiefly by <HI>Pius</HI> IV.</P>
<P>THEY took the black Habit of Hermits of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> and lived under his Rule by Grant of <HI>Honorius</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 1125. vowing Obedience, Poverty, and Chastity; and on the Breast of their Habit wore at first a plain Cross of White Cloth, which was after changed to one with Eight Points; but in time of War they used a Red Cassock, bearing the White Cross upon it.

<P>The Founder was <HI>Arthur</HI> King of <HI>Britain,</HI> crown'd in the Year of our Lord 516, at the Age of 15 Years; of whose incredible Courage and Gallantry, tho' some have stretch'd too far, yet <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> is of Opinion, he was worthy to have been celebrated by true and faithful Historians, and not false and spurious Tales. He it was that long prop'd up his declining Country, and inspir'd Martial Courage into his Sub∣jects, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> in twelve pitch'd Battles having over∣come, and conquer'd divers Countries. He liv'd in so great Repute and Renown, that worthy Knights came from all Parts to his Court, as a Seminary of Mi∣litary Discipline, to demonstrate their Valour in point of Arms. This gave him Occasion to select out of these, and his own Subjects, some say Twenty Four of the most Valiant, which he united in a Fellowship; and to avoid all Controversy upon Precedency, caus'd a Round Table to be made, whence the Order had its Appellation. He admitted not only <HI>Britains,</HI> but Stran∣gers; and their Qualifications were to be Persons of Nobility, Dignity, and renown'd for Vertue and Va∣lour. The Place where they were instituted was <HI>Wind∣sor;</HI> and those others of Note, where he and his Knights assembled, were at <HI>Caerleon</HI> in <HI>Monmouthshir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Winchester,</HI> and <HI>Camelot</HI> in <HI>Com' Somerset;</HI> and their time of convening was <HI>Whitsuntide.</HI> In <HI>Winchester</HI> Castle was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> large Round Table, call'd (and affirm'd to be) King

His Sword and Lance had also their Names, one being call'd <HI>Caliburne,</HI> the other <HI>Irone</HI> or <HI>Rone.</HI> It's not remember'd that this Order sur∣viv'd the Founder, but rather that it expir'd with him, most of these Knights perishing with him at the Battle of <HI>Kamblan,</HI> now <HI>Camelsford,</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where tho' he kill'd his Enemy <HI>Mordred,</HI> yet he dy'd <HI>A.

The Gallantry of the Action the Earl ac∣knowledged by granting them several Privileges, and to perpetuate the Memory instituted this Order, somewhat like a Military one, and none were to be ad∣mitted, only those brave Women, and the Honour to de∣rive to their Descendants, and assigned them for a Badge a Thing like a <HI>Fryer's Capouche,</HI> sharp at the Top, after the Form of a Torch, of a Crimson Colour, to be worn upon their Head-Cloaths; that at all publick Meetings the Women should have Precedence of the Men, and should be exempted from all Taxes, and that all the Apparels and Jewels left by their dead Husbands should be theirs.</P>
<P>A more general Ornament of Honour peculiar to the Fair Sex is the <HI>Cordon,</HI> which some will have to be an Order, or Equivalent thereunto.

Short∣ly after, in a Charter of Peace between King <HI>Stephen</HI> and Duke <HI>Henry,</HI> (King <HI>Henry</HI> II. afterwards) this Castle was called <HI>Mola de Windesor,</HI> the Fortress of <HI>Windesor.</HI> Within this Castle was King <HI>Edward</HI> III. born, (com∣monly called <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Windsor)</HI> and was baptized in the old Chapel; and so great was his Affection to that Place, that he constituted it the Seat of the most noble Order of the <HI>Garter;</HI> and to embellish it the more, he founded the College of the Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> and much enlarged, and beautified the Castle.</P>
<P>For this Work he appointed several Surveyors, whom he assigned to press Hewers of Stone, Carpenters, and such other Artificers as were thought useful and neces∣sary, as also to provide Stone, Timber, and all other Materials for them. <HI>William de Wyckham</HI> (who attained to be Bishop of <HI>Winchester)</HI> was one of these Supervisors, and had that Place conferr'd on him by Letters Patent, <HI>October</HI> 30. <HI>Ed.</HI> III. And a Grant of the same Fee was likewise allowed to <HI>Robert de Bernham,</HI> viz. One Shilling a Day, while he was at <HI>Windsor,</HI> Two Shillings when he went elsewhere about that Affair, and Three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week to his Clerk; afterwards he was chief Custos and Surveyor of this Castle, of the Mannors of Old and New <HI>Windsor,</HI> and of other Castles, Mannors, &amp;c. be∣longing to the King, to provide Workmen, and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k after the Repairs, and in those Mannors to hold Leets and other Courts, Pleas of Trespass and Misdemeanours.</P>
<P>About the 34<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Ed.</HI> III. it is presumed the most con∣siderable Enlargement of the Castle was made, seeing there was then great Store of the ablest Diggers and Masons impress'd, by virtue of Writs directed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣veral Sheriffs, with Command under 100 <HI>l.</HI> Penalty to send them to <HI>Windsor</HI> the <HI>Sunday</HI> after the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> to work at the King's Charge, from whence they were not to depart without <HI>Wyckham</HI>'s License, Se∣curity having been first taken by the Sheriffs, and re∣turned into <HI>Chancery. London</HI> found Forty; <HI>Essex,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford,</HI> Forty; <HI>Wilts, Leicester,</HI> with

<HI>Worcester, Cambridge,</HI> with <HI>Huntington</HI> Forty, <HI>Kent, Gloucester, Somerset,</HI> with <HI>Devon,</HI> and <HI>Northampton,</HI> one with another, found also Forty a-piece. And be∣cause divers of these Workmen, for Gain and Advantage, clandestinely left <HI>Windsor</HI> to the Hindrance of the Work, all Persons were forbid to employ or retain them under Forfeiture of all they had, and likewise to arrest those that withdrew themselves from the Work, and commit them to <HI>Newgate. A.</HI> 36. <HI>Ed.</HI> III. many of them being swept away by the Pestilence, the like Writs were directed to other Sheriffs, under a Hundred Pound Pe∣nalty, to send able Men; whereupon the Counties of <HI>York</HI> sent Sixty, <HI>Derby</HI> Twenty Four, <HI>Salop</HI> Sixty, <HI>Here∣ford</HI> Fifty, <HI>Nottingham</HI> Twenty Four, <HI>Lancaster</HI> Twenty Four, and <HI>Devon</HI> Sixty. <HI>A.</HI> 37. <HI>Ed.</HI> III. The noble Edifice was ready for Glazing, and of Twenty Four of that Occupation impress'd for the King's Service, Twelve were to be employed at <HI>Windsor.</HI> In this Year and the next a great Proficiency was made, and vast Quantities of Stone were amassed, dug out of the Quarries of <HI>Wellesfor, Newel,</HI> and <HI>Carby,</HI> and other Places. From the 37th to the 43d, the Building of the Castle was diligently pursued. We find no Addition to this august Pile till his 48th Year, and after that Time nothing more during his Reign, so that it is supposed this Fa∣mous Piece for Magnificence and Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngth was then chiefly finished, <HI>viz.</HI> the Great Hall of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Lodgings on the East and South side of the Upper Ward, the Keep or Tower in the Middle Ward, the Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Houses for the Custos and the Canons in the Lower Ward, with the whole Circumference of the Walls, their several Towers and Gates, as in the pre∣sent Posture they remain.</P>
<P>IN succeeding Times King <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. added that state∣ly Fabrick adjoining to the King's Lodgings, in the Upper Ward. King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. re-edified the great Gate at the Entrance into the Lower Ward. King <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. began, and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> perfected the Conveying the Water, from <HI>Blackmore-Park</HI> in <HI>Wingfield</HI> Parish, into a Fountain of curious Workmanship erected in the Mid∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Ward, which supplied all the Castle. Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> made a Terrace Work on the North side of the
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
Castle; from whence there is a pleasant Prospect down upon <HI>Eaton-bridge,</HI> the <HI>Thames,</HI> and the adjacent Coun∣try. King <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1636. built the Gate at the East end of the Terrace, which leads into the Park. And lastly, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. greatly beautified and re∣pair'd the Fabrick, and furnish'd it with a curious Ar∣mory; and, in fine, every Thing is so fitly disposed and ordered, that they are worthy of the Notice of every nice and curious Traveller.</P>
<P><HI>CAMDEN elegantly describes its Situation in Prose in this manner:</HI> From an Hill <HI>(says he)</HI> that rises with a gentle Ascent, it enjoyeth a most delightful Prospect round about; foreright, in the Front, it ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rlooketh a Vale, lying out far and wide, garnish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with Corn Fields, flourishing with Meadows, deck'd with Groves on either side, and watered with the most mild and calm River <HI>Thames.</HI> Behind it arise Hills every where, neither rough nor over high, attired, as it were with Woods, and even dedicated, as one would say, by Nature, to hunting Game.</P>

This Castle is under the Government of a Constable, s<SUP>o</SUP> call'd in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and has bore that Deno∣mination ever since: The Office is of great Antiquity, Honour and Power, but of small Revenue, for it is partly Military and Civil; as Military he commands the Castle and any Garrison placed therein, and is obliged to defend it against all Enemies whatsoever; all the Prisoners brought hither are committed to his Charge, and is answerable for all that is in the Castle to the King, un∣der whom he is Commander, as a Civil Officer. He is Judge of a Court of Record held there by Prescription, for determining, by way of Common Law, all Pleas between Party and Party, arising within the Precincts of the Forest of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and Liberties thereof, which compriseth many Towns, and all legal Processes issue out in his Name. He is allowed a Deputy learned in the Law, who is called the Steward of the Court of Record, and is Keeper of the Constable's Seal of Office. This Officer supplies the Constable's Place as a Judge of the Court of <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> from whose Judgment the Appeal is by Writ of Error returnable in the <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> or <HI>Common Pleas</HI> at <HI>Westminster.</HI> The Constable is likewise Forester and Warden of the Forest of <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> which is an 120 Miles in compass.

pulled down the old Chapel erected there by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. and dedicated to King <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> to raise a more stately Structure in its stead; to bring which Marter to Perfection, in the 24th Year of his Reign, <HI>John de Spoulee</HI> had the Office of Master of the Stone-Hewers, and had Power to provide Masons, and other Artificers, to whose Care they were entrusted. In <HI>Anno</HI> 25. <HI>Ed.</HI> I. <HI>John de Dorchester,</HI> Sub-Constable of the Castle, was appointed to keep a Controul upon all the Provisions bought for the Works of the Chapel, as well as on the Payments, and all other Affairs relating thereunto. To this Fabrick he erected several Houses adjoining, for the Custos and Canons to reside in; and afterwards King <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. gave them the void Place in the Castle call'd the <HI>Woodhall,</HI> nigh the great Hall, for building of Houses and Apartments for the Vicars, Clerks, and Choristers, and the other Ministers, assigned for the Service of the Chapel; but King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. ob∣serving the Walls and Foundation of the Chapel sapped and consumed, and esteeming the Fabrick not stately or sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cious enough, designed another more noble and ex∣cellent in its Room: In order to it <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> was constituted Master and Survey∣or of the Work, who had Power from the King to re∣move all Impediments, demolished divers of the Offi∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Houses, and other irregular Piles and decay'd Walls, and dug up their Foundations, particularly those ancient Buildings on the East side of the Chapel, which extended unto the Walls on the North side of the Castle, where the Towers, <HI>viz.

How well the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop discharged this Office, appears from the Preamble of his Patent, whereby that King conferred o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him the Chancellorship of the <HI>Carter,</HI> in which is set forth, <HI>That out of meer Love towards the Order, he had given himself the Leisure daily to attend the Advancement and Pro∣gress of this goodly Fabrick.</HI></P>

Henry</HI> VII. Sir <HI>Reginald Bray,</HI> Knight of the <HI>Garter,</HI> be∣came a liberal Benefactor, finishing the Body of the Chapel, and rearing the Middle Chapel on the South thereof, which still retains his Name, and where his Body lies interred, as is manifest by his Arms, Badges, &amp;c. cut in Stone, and by his last Will. <HI>Anno</HI> 21. <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. <HI>John Hylmer</HI> and <HI>William Vertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Free Ma∣sons, undertook the Vaulting the Roof of the Choir (a curious Piece of Architecture) for 700 <HI>l.</HI> and finish'd it by <HI>Christmas,</HI> 1508. <HI>Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Rood Loft, and Lanthorn, were erected, with the Contributions raised by the Knights Companions. Near to the East end of this Chapel, was a little Fabrick of Free-Stone, raised by Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> call'd the <HI>Tomb House,</HI> in the Middle whereof he designed to erect a Monument for King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and had almost finished it before he died; but this was demolished, 1646. by command of the <HI>Long Parliament;</HI> and all the Copper Figures, ex∣ceedingly enriched by Art, carry'd thence. This Place King <HI>Charles</HI> I. intended to enlarge, for the Interment of his own Royal Body, and those of his Successors; but those villainous Times drawn on, they with much ado afforded him but a mean obscure Place near the first high Place in the Choir of this Chap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, in the same Vault where the Bodies of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and his last Queen yet remain.</P>

OVER this Arch hung this King's Coat of Mail, co∣ver'd over with Crimson Velvet, and thereon the Arms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> quarter'd and richly embroider'd with Pearl and Gold, interwoven with divers Rubies; which Trophy had remain'd over his Monument ever since his Interment, till plunder'd by Captain <HI>Fogg,</HI> 1642. who at the same time sacrilegiously robb'd the Chapel of all its Altar-Plate.</P>
<P>WITHIN this Chapel were several Chantries en∣dow'd with Lands and other Revenues, for Chaplains and Priests to sing Masses for the Souls of their Foun∣der's Kindred.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> in 3 <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. gave Two Hundred Marks to the Dean and Chapter, to buy Twenty Marks <HI>per Annum</HI> to maintain one Chaplain.</P>

<P N="22">22 <HI>Ed.</HI> IV.

<P>To these we shall add the Foundation of the new Commons, erected over against the North Door of the Body of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel, by <HI>James Denton</HI> one of the Canons, <HI>Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. for the Lodging and Diet∣ing such of the Chantry Priests, Choristers and stipen∣diary Priests, who had before no certain Place where to hold Commons in, which he furnish'd with all proper Utensils, the Charge amounting to 489 l. 7 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> in lieu of which the Choristers were to say certain Prayers when they enter'd the Chapel, commemorate his Death, and pray for his and the Souls of all the Faithful de∣parted.</P>
<P>IN this Chapel of St. <HI>George</HI> there were heretofore several Anniversaries or Obits held and celebrated, which we pass over. And as it was usual for some of the military Profession to spend the Remains of their Lives in pious Speculations, for their King and Coun∣try, and the Salvation of their own Souls, Permission was allow'd to the well-dispos'd <HI>Knights of the Garter,</HI> who retir'd from the Noise and Bustle of the World, to make their Abode there; yet so as to maintain them∣selves out of their own Revenues. King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. ordain'd that the Sovereign should assign them conve∣nient Appartments within the Castle; and the like Fa∣vour he granted to other Knights, tho' not of the Or∣der; but the Lodgings to be such as the Sovereign and Knights Companions should decree: However, we do not find the Knights Companions made use of the Benefit, but only for their better Accommodation at the grand Feast of the Order, &amp;c. A Motion was made, 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. that they might have Lodgings assign'd them in the great Court, which they offer'd to repair at their own Charge, since all the Officers had Conveni∣encies in the Castle, but the Knights Companions none, which the King did not dissent to, provided it be without Exclusion of the great Officers of State.</P>

<P>§ 3. WITHIN the Chapel of the Castle, erected by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. was founded a College for Eight Canons, to be maintain'd by an annual Pension out of the Ex∣chequer. King <HI>Edw.</HI> II. founded here a Chantry for

<P>THE Foundation we treated of here was confirm'd by Letters Patent, dated at <HI>Westminster, Aug.</HI> 6. 22 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. three Quarters of a Year before he erected <HI>The Order of the Garter,</HI> when he laid the Foundation of the ancient Chapel a-fresh, in honour of God, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> St. <HI>George</HI> and St. <HI>Edward the Confessor;</HI> and or∣dain'd, that to King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Eight Canons there should be annex'd One Custos, Fifteen more Canons, and Twenty Four Alms-Knights, together with other Mi∣nisters, all under the Power of the Custos, and these to be supported out of the Revenues wherewith this Chapel should be endow'd: Upon which Pope <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> VI. 1351. by his Bull directed to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> approved in part the King's Intention.</P>

<P>THE Authority of the Custos or Dean consists in being President over the rest of the College; to go∣vern, direct and order them their Goods and Estates.

Sowers of Discord, Backbiters and Whisperers, that are below the Degree of a Canon. And that there be no defect of Government, when the Dean has Occasion to be absent above Eight Days, he shall appoint One of the Canon Residents for his Deputy, in whose absence he has the Title of Lieutenant, and on all Occasions to exercise his Office; for the Statutes allow him Sixty Days in a Year for Non-residence; which space the Royal Visitation, 1552. enlarg'd to One Hundred and Ten Days; and the Lord Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> granted him Liberty of Six Weeks absence. But in the Vacancy of the Custos, the Chapter has all his Power conferr'd on them; which Chapter ought, within Two Days after the Vacancy made known, elect one of the Resident Canons, under the Title of President, to govern the College until they be provided of another Custos.</P>

<P>THE principal Duty of these Canons (and of all the other Ministers of the College) is continually to attend upon the Service of God in the Chapel of St. <HI>George;</HI> and the Statutes run upon each Day's Omission of a Canon Resident, to be mulcted his <HI>quotidian</HI> Distribu∣tion 12 <HI>d.</HI> And tho' we find no License of Non-Resi∣dence granted them by their Founder, yet there is mention of Canons Resident and Non-Resident, for whom great Defalcations are appointed to be made, to prevent such Neglects, because the residentiary Canons bear not only the Burden of that Duty belonging to the Chapel, but the Expence of Hospitality and other Works of Charity, occasion'd from their residing at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> obtain'd Pow∣er from <HI>Sextus</HI> IV. to make new Statutes, and dispens'd with the old Ones; and in 1478. he gave to the Dean and every Canon Fourteen Days of Non-Residence in every Term, to wit, Fifty Six Days in the Year. By the Visitation, 1552. they obtain'd a Dispensation for Eighty Days; and the Lord Chancellor <HI>Hatton</HI> yet gave them a further Permission to Two Hundred and Two Days, which the Lord Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> confirm'd; so that there remains One Hundred and Sixty Three Days in the Year, in which the Canons ought to be resident with Hospitality, to be consonant to their Statutes.</P>
<P>THE Canons are particularly oblig'd to pray for the Sovereign, and for the happy Estate of the Order. If any Knight Companion, or other Person, should be∣stow Ten Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> in order to be Partaker of the Prayers appointed for the Benefactors of the

<P>THE civil Obligations of these Canons are to attend the Sovereign (or his Deputy) and the Knights Com∣panions at their grand Feast, and at the Feasts of the Installation, or when the Sovereign or Knights Compa∣nions shall come to the Chapel of St. <HI>George</HI> upon a Re∣ligious Account.

<P>§. 5. The Alms Knights we shall treat of in a three∣fold Estate: 1. Under the Foundation; 2. When dis∣jointed thence by Act of Parliament; and, 3. As esta∣blished anew by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THEN, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. out of the great Regard he had to military Honour, and those who had bravely behav'd themselves in his Wars, yet after chanced to fall in decay, made a Provision for their Relief and com∣fortable Subsistence in old Age, by providing for them in this his Foundation, and making a Coalition in one joint Body with the Custos and Canons; these he call'd <HI>Milites Pauperes,</HI> and we Poor or Alms-Knights. The stated Number at first were Twenty Four, equal to the Custos and Canons at the first Erection. But shortly after, up∣on his instituting the Order of the <HI>Garter,</HI> Two more were added (as there was to the first Canons) to make the compleat Number of the Knights-Companions of that Order, which were Twenty Six, as we find stated at the Ordination of the College by the Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> the Pope's Delegate.</P>
<P>THE Intention of the Founder was for those that were real Objects of Charity, as he describes them, <HI>viz.</HI> poor Knights, infirm in Body, indigent and decay'd, or as the Statutes of the <HI>Garter</HI> qualifies them, such as thro' adverse Turns of Fortune were reduced to that Extremity that they had not wherewithal to sustain themselves, to live so genteelly as was suitable for a Military Condition, which for greater Caution was rei∣terated in the Statutes of King <HI>Hen.</HI> V. King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and in the Orders of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for it was ex∣press'd, in case any Estate of 20 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> devolved on them, such Knights were to be discharged the Col∣lege, and they were to proceed to a new Election.</P>
<P>AT the first each Knight-Companion of the Order presented his Alms-Knight, but ever after their Election was to be at the Disposal of the Sovereign. Their Habit
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
was a Red Mantle, with the Escutcheon of St. <HI>George,</HI> without any Garter to surround it. Their Exhibition, after their first Election was 12 <HI>d.</HI> a-piece every Day they were at Service in the Chapel, or resident in the College, besides 40 <HI>s. per Annum</HI> for other Contin∣gencies, it being the stated Allowance appointed to each of the Canons Residents.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Beginning of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VI's Reign, their <HI>quotidian</HI> Distributions and Annual 40 <HI>s.</HI> had been un∣paid upon the Account of some Dissentions risen between them and the Dean and Canons; but upon Complaint of <HI>John</HI> Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Visitor of the College, 10 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. they were re∣dressed, and their Arrears of both discharged, without any Deduction, and likewise obtained this Clause, That if the Treasurer of the College became negligent in future Payments, he should lose his own <HI>Quotidians,</HI> from the Time of his voluntary Omission, and the same to be divided among the Alms-Knights. Their Duty was to pray for the Sovereign and the Knights Companions, to be every Day present at High Mass, the Masses of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> at Vespers and Compline, and in default to be mulcted their 12 <HI>d. toties quoties,</HI> which was to be converted to the Use of the other Alms-Knights, then residing in the Castle of <HI>Windsor;</HI> notwithstanding which Decree, the Dean did afterwards break in upon them, and disposed of these Forfeitures at his Pleasure, till 2 <HI>Rich.</HI> II. <HI>Adam,</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>David</HI>'s, then Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Visitor of the College, re∣dress'd it, and another Complaint of like Nature being made of the Deans disposing of Donations and other Liberalities of the Knights Companions in wrong of the Alms-Knights, this Chancellor decreed an equal Di∣stribution between the Alms-Knights and Canons, till the King and Council should otherwise determine.</P>
<P>These and other Differences between the Dean and Canons and Alms Knights, grew up to that height, that they became irreconcileable, insomuch as in the Act of Parliament, 22 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. for incorporating of the Cu∣stos and Canons, by the Name of Dean and Canons, the Alms-Knights were not only omitted; but this Clause inserted, <HI>That the Dean and Canons, and their Successors,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
<HI>should for ever more be utterly quit and discharged from all manner of Exhibition or Charge of or for any of the said Knights.</HI> And this under the Cover, That the King has greatly augmented the Number of the Ministers of the Chapel, that the Revenue was insufficient to main∣tain both them and the Alms-Knights; but in the Dean and Canons Answer to the Knights Petition to repeal this Act, the Cause is alledged, For that some of these Knights used their utmost Endeavours before this Act, to incorporate themselves, and to be exempt from the Obedience and Rule of the Dean and Canons.</P>
<P>AFTER this Act, which struck off their Quotidian Portions and Fees assigned by King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Foundati∣on, how the Alms Knights subsisted we find not; but so soon as King <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. came to the Crown, they pe∣titioned the King and Parliament for Repeal of the Act, 22 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. and alledged it was obtained without their Knowledge, or being called thereunto, which Plea a∣vailed not at all; but on the contrary, the Dean and Canons, some Years after, got an Exemplification there∣of under the great Seal, dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 4. 18 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII.</P>
<P>AND it is very evident from King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Letter to the College, that what they did in this Nature after this Act commenced, was merely upon Courtesie; for he returns them Thanks for a Pension of Twenty Marks conferred upon <HI>Peter Narbone,</HI> whom he had recom∣mended to an Alms-Knights Place, and Promises to burthen them no more with Requests of this sort, but that he would settle Lands for their Maintenance. So great was their Caution, <HI>Narbone</HI> was by Covenants in∣dented between him and the Dean and Canons, to re∣linquish his Pension upon that King's settling Lands on the College, for the Provision of such Knights. In the Interval between the Disunion of the College and Alms-Knights, to their Establishment by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> their Habit and Badge continued the same, and was so confirmed by <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Statutes. It may be collected by his last Will, there was an Intention to draw the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about the Escutcheon of St. <HI>George,</HI> which Pro∣jection came to nothing, and expired. In this Interval it is observ'd that several Persons of considerable Rank and Distinction became Alms<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Knights; some of which
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
were rendred great Objects of Charity; among which Number was Sir <HI>Robert Champlayne,</HI> a valiant Knight, an Honour to our Nation, for his renowned and martial Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces abroad. He was of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI's Party in the Civil Wars against King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. Immediately after whose coming to the Crown he left <HI>England,</HI> and travel∣led into <HI>Hungary,</HI> (with an Equipage of Three Servants and Four Horses) where in the Assistance of <HI>Mathou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Corvinius</HI> King of <HI>Hungary</HI> against the <HI>Turks,</HI> he beha∣ved himself very gallantly; but prosperous Fortune not always attending him with Success, he receiv'd many Wounds; and at length was taken Prisoner, lost all, and forced to pay 1500 Ducats for his Ransom; for the Attestation of which he had the Great Seals of the King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Crete,</HI> Legate <HI>de Latere</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> the Count <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bur∣gundy;</HI> and lastly, a Declaration thereof under the Privy Seal of King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV.

<P>IT is evident King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. designed a R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-esta∣blishment of half the ancient Number of Alms-Knights, <HI>viz.</HI> Thirteen; for which purpose he appointed by his Will 600 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> in Mannors, Lands, and Spiritual Promotions, settled upon the Dean and Canons, and their Successors for ever, upon the Proviso's that they should find Two Priests to say Mass at his Tomb, to commemorate yearly Four Obits for him, and at every Obit distribute 12 <HI>l.</HI> in Alms, likewise to pay 12 <HI>d.</HI> a Week to those Thirteen Alms-Knights, who were to have once a Year a long Gown of White Cloth, and a Mantle of Red, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sides Five Marks annually, to such one among them as should be constituted their Go∣vernor, and so much for a Sermon every <HI>Sunday</HI> throughout

<P>§ 6. THE other Ministers of the College and Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> call'd <HI>Ministers</HI> in the Foundation Patent, are the superior Officers, <HI>viz.</HI> The Chantor, Steward and Treasurer.</P>
<P>THE Chantor is elected from among the Canons, whose Office is chiefly to govern those that sing in the Choir, and such as are employ'd about Divine Service. Before the Reformation he appointed who should be∣gin the Antiphones, celebrate Masses, and read the Les∣sons, Epistles and Gospels. To his Care was commit∣ted all the Books, Crosses, Chalices, Vestments, and all the Sacred Ornaments of the Chapel. He receives the Offerings there made, and Accounts for them; for all which Services an annual Pension of 5 <HI>l.</HI> is allow'd him.</P>
<P>THE Steward and Treasurer are annually chosen on the Morrow after <HI>Michaelmas-day</HI> from out of the Canons Resident. To the Steward's Office appertains the Go∣vernment of all the Revenues of the College, the Rents and Profits whereof he is to pay the Treasurer. In his Custody are repos'd all the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naments, Jewels, and o∣ther Treasure of the Chapel, not committed to the
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
Chantor, under the Obligation of rendring an Account; and his yearly Pension is 5 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>THE Treasurer is to distribute to the Custos, Ca∣nons, Vicars, &amp;c. their Pensions and Allowances, which if he fail Eight Days after their prefix'd Times of Payment, he is debar'd of his own <HI>quotidians,</HI> as Ca∣non Resident, until such Arrears be discharg'd; as like∣wise the Steward, if he be found delinquent. His Pension is also 5 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> There is one Treasurer to receive the Rents of the old Lands, and another cho∣sen from the Canons to receive the new, who have been allow'd the like annual Pensions. The former is term'd <HI>Seneschallus veteris,</HI> the latter <HI>Seneschallus novae Do∣tationis.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, there is a Steward of the Courts, and Clerk of the Lands, which is an Officer under both the before-mention'd Stewards. He keeps the Courts by himself or Deputy, and is a Barrester at Law, and the standing Council for the College. His yearly Pen∣sion is 20 Nobles. But the Council <HI>in Spiritualibus</HI> is usually a Graduate in the Law.</P>
<P>THE Chapter-Clerk enters and registers all Acts of the Chapter-House; he draws and engrosses all Inden∣tures, Patents, Grants, Leases, &amp;c. which pass the com∣mon Seal of the Dean and Canons. His Pension is 3 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per Annum.</HI> The Under Stewardship and Chapter Clerkship heretofore were enjoy'd by one Person, but of late they are divided, and now he must be a Bar∣rester at Law.</P>
<P>OF the Virgers Institution the Statutes of the College make mention, that in Procession and other Solemni∣ties, they were to go before the Dean and Canons, bearing their Rods, for which Service they were to have annually a Robe, and 6 <HI>d. per Diem.</HI> And besides these, there are Two Sextons, Two Bell-ringers, a Clock∣keeper, and a Porter who attends the shutting and open∣ing of the Gates.</P>

Another such License, 28th of <HI>January,</HI> 24 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. was given to <HI>William de Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> for assigning to the Custos and Chaplains the Advowson of <HI>Dodyngton</HI> in <HI>Com.

of <HI>Northampton,</HI> to be paid by the Bailiff of the Town at <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas</HI> by equal Allotments: And it was at the Founder's Instance (therefore worthy to be inserted) that the Town of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> 26 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. un∣der their Common Seal, granted them a Last of Red Herrings yearly, well dry'd and cleans'd, to take the Corporation into their Prayers; tho' some say it was a Penance enjoyn'd them for murdering a Magistrate.</P>
<P>IN the 26 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. the Founder granted them and their Successors the Mannor of <HI>Eure</HI> near <HI>Weybrigg,</HI> in <HI>Com.

He gave to the Custos and College soon after the Seisin thereof, as also of a Wood call'd <HI>Temple-Wood</HI> in <HI>Stoke-Pogeys,</HI> convey'd to the King by <HI>John de Molyns:</HI> But deeming all the Lands too small for the End he in∣tended, 28 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. the King granted the Custos and College, by Letters Patent, a Pension of 100 <HI>l. per An∣num</HI> out of the Exchequer; and upon the vacating the same, 34 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. he gave them yearly Lands of 101 <HI>l.</HI> 11 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> out of the Possessions of religious Aliens, which fell into his Hands by Occasion of the <HI>French</HI> Wars: But lest these Possessions should be again re∣stor'd upon a Treaty of Peace, they were to receive the annual Sum of 101 <HI>l.</HI> 11 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> out of the Ex∣chequer, till they were provided of Lands of the like Value.

Lastly, 39 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. the Founder bestow'd on them a Piece of Ground in <HI>New Windsor,</HI> (whereon had stood an House of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>London)</HI> in lieu of the great Garden
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
South of the Castle, formerly given them by him; and also a Garden opposite thereunto on the other side of the Way. Besides these Largesses of the Founders, there were others made by pious and devout Persons, said to be incorporated into the first Foundation, and made up that Revenue which <HI>William</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester</HI> adjudg'd sufficient for the Support of the Col∣lege, which we shall silently pass over with the bare mention only.</P>
<P>THE Mannor of <HI>Dodyngton</HI>-Castle; two Pastures call'd <HI>Frith</HI> and <HI>Ashcroft;</HI> the Chapel of <HI>Langeley;</HI> the Parso∣nages of <HI>Estriton, Langeley-Maries, Wantynge, Shaldeborne, Wedonbeek, Glynde</HI> and <HI>Ryslepe;</HI> the Pensions of the Vi∣carages of <HI>Wantynge, Clyffe, Tylthey</HI> and <HI>Gottesford;</HI> and the Portions of <HI>Bassyngborne</HI> and <HI>Prestwyke,</HI> in <HI>Haseley</HI> magna, <HI>Chalgrave, Adewelle, Aston, Rowhand, Sevyndon, Kyngeston</HI> and <HI>Henton,</HI> in <HI>Stoke-Basset,</HI> and <HI>Clopecote</HI> in <HI>Gatehampton; Whytechyrche, Maplederham, Retherfeld, E∣sthenreth Stretham;</HI> of <HI>Thornecroft</HI> in <HI>Letherhed;</HI> of <HI>To∣tynbeek</HI> in <HI>Wodesdon; Evington, Woodmershthorne;</HI> of <HI>Fordham, Ethrope, Newenham,</HI> and in <HI>Tollesworth.</HI></P>

all these Premises, the King granted them Court Leets, or Views of Frankpledge, and to levy Fines, Amercia∣ments, Free Warrens, Waifs, and Felons Goods, and all other Profits, &amp;c. whatsoever, and the said Rectories, Tithes, Pensions, Rents, and all other Gifts and Grants in the Possession of the Dean and Chapter, were confirmed to them by Act of Parliament, 2 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>
<P>THE ancient Rate of these New Lands in the King's Books was 661 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> and 8 <HI>d. per Annum;</HI> but accord∣ing to the improved Rents, as they were then turned over to the College, 812 <HI>l.</HI> 12. 9 <HI>d.</HI> out of which 160 <HI>l.</HI> 2 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> was yearly allowed them in Requital of their Lands passed to King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and 600 <HI>l. per An∣num,</HI> for accomplishment of his Will; but the remain∣ing Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> 52 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI> was reserved in lieu of Tenths, to be paid into the Court of <HI>Augmentation;</HI> ne∣vertheless, this last reserved Sum was not assented un∣to by the Dean and Canons to be so paid, because the Charges issuing out of the Lands were larger than were expressed in the Rental. And we find that, shortly af∣ter, the Rents of St. <HI>Germains, Northam, Ilsington,</HI> &amp;c. part of the New Lands, were received and accounted for, according to the old Rate in the King's Books, to wit, 162 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d. per Annum,</HI> in Recompence for the Lands conveyed to King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and out of which they paid a yearly Surplusage of 2 <HI>l.</HI> 2 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> This Sum, together with the Rents of the rest of the New Lands, being upon the said Improvement accounted to be 597 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> made in all 600 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> and this was laid out by the Dean and Canons for some time towards erecting the Alms-Knights Apartments.</P>

<P>§. 8. THE Privileges of the Chapel and College are Ecclesiastical and Temporal: As to the first, Pope <HI>Cle∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI> VI. exempted the Chapel, College, Canons, Priests, Clerks, Alms-Knights and Officers, from all ordinary Jurisdiction of Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, and all Judges and Officers, and received them within the Protection of the Papal-See; and granted a farther Privilege, That the Custos should have Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over the Canons, Priests, &amp;c. as also the Cure of their Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, notwithstanding any Papal Constitution
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
Provincial, or Synodical, yet allowing that the Custos should receive that Cure from the Diocesan of the Place. In Consideration of this Exemption, the Custos was to pay annually, on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, a Mark in Sil∣ver, to the Pope's Chamber. Two Years preceding, the Chapel was called the King's Free Chapel, which Title it still enjoys; for it owes S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bjection to none but the Sovereign of <HI>England,</HI> the Supream of the Church, as heretofore it stood divided between the King and See of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Privilege of Exemption included in the Confirmation of Liberties, made by the Founder in his Charter, dated <HI>Anno Regni sui</HI> 47. and all other E∣moluments granted by him, are confirmed by Act of Parliament, 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. As the College has its sole De∣pendance on the Crown, it is visitable only by the Lord-Chancellor, whose Visitations and Power are re∣served to him by the Statutes of the College, and him∣self called in the King's Commission for Visitation, 2 <HI>Rich.</HI> II. Governor of the said Chapel, as well in Spi∣rituals as Temporals, and, under the King, immediate Custos. And so jealous were the Dean and Canons, left the Power of the said Exemption should be infringed, that when <HI>Sixtus</HI> IV. had granted the Bishop of <HI>Salis∣bury,</HI> and themselves, to make new and interpret the ancient Statutes, they soon obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Revocation of that Authority, left the said Bishop (in whose Diocess the College is situate) being so unpowered, might by Degrees bring them under his Jurisdicton, in prejudice to their Exemption. And, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1485. to prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch design, the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> &amp;c. were commission'd to see the Bull revoked, and <HI>Salisbury</HI> en∣joyned not to intermeddle further in the College Affairs. Moreover other Bishops, and the Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> were to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>new, alter, or new make such Statutes as might accrue to the Advantage of the College.</P>
<P>IF the Archbishop of <HI>Cant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbury</HI> be present in the Chapel, he sits below the Dean, nor can he consecrate there, without his License. And this is very remark∣able, that at the ratifying the Peace between King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wis</HI> XIII. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1629. in the Chapel at <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sor,</HI> Dr <HI>Wren,</HI> then Dean of the College, gave the
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
Oath to the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, and not the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> tho' he was then present.</P>
<P>THE Dean and Chapter are to weigh well and debate at their yearly Chapters all things fit to be dispatched in reference to the College Affairs, and whatsoever Deter∣mination they come to, not repugnant to their Statutes, all Persons are firmly obliged to observe.</P>
<P>THE Deans have no Institution from any Bishop, but his Institution, Investiture, and Installation into the Custos-ship, Canonship, and Prebendship, is conferred from such of the Canons Resident, to whom the King (who collates) doth recommend him. Other Marks of Exemption appear in the constant proving of Wills be∣fore him, or in his Absence before his Lieutenant. In using the Power of Excommunication within their Ju∣risdiction (the Precincts of the College) granting a Dis∣pensation for eating Flesh in <HI>Lent,</HI> a farther Mark of their Privilege appears, that the Ordination for the Chantry Priests were confirmed by the Dean and Chap∣ter, and not the Bishop of the Diocess, as were the Statutes of the new Commons. The Dean is exemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from paying all Synodals, or Procurations, nor can any of the King's Chaplains preach in the Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> unless he be a Canon there, or have License from the King, or from the Dean and Canons. They send no Delegates to the Synod, and when the Point was debated, 1640. it was carried in the Negative, as being against their Liberties, and might intitle them to the Paym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of Subsidies; nor are they intitled to any Share in the Government of the Church, more than the Colleges in the Universities, where there are many no∣minal Deans. In short, when by the Act of <HI>Uniformi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> II. every Clergyman was bound to subscribe be∣fore the Arch bishop or his Ordinary, the Canons sub∣scribed before the Dean; and tho' some of them sub∣scribed before the Bishop, yet was it with a Salvo, saving the Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hts and Privileges of this Free Chapel.</P>

<P>WE come now to treat of the most Noble and Il∣lustrious <HI>Order of the Garter;</HI> which, if we consi∣der either its Antiquity, or the Nobleness of the Personages, that have been enroll'd, it excels and outvies all other Institutions of Honour in the whole World. It owes its Original, as is confessed on all Hands, to <HI>Edward</HI> III. King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> yet as to the Occasion, there are several Opinions which we shall rectifie. The vulgar and more general is, that the Garter of <HI>Joan,</HI> Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> dropping casually off as she danced in a solemn Ball, King <HI>Edward</HI> stoop∣ing took it up from the Ground, whereupon some of his Nobles smiling, as at an amorous Action, and he observing their sportive Humour, turned it off with a Reply in <HI>French, Honi soit qui mal y pense;</HI> but withal added, in disdain of their Laughter, <HI>That shortly th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y should see that Garter advanced to so high an Honour and Re∣nown as to account themselves happy to wear it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT upon Examination of this Tradition, let others judge what Credit it bears to establish its Belief; for Sir <HI>John Froissart,</HI> the only Writer of the Age that treats
<PB N="120" REF="128"/>
of this Institution, assigns no such Original, nor for 200 Years after is there any thing to the Purpose in our other Historians, till <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> took occasion to say something of it; but had it been Fact, some <HI>French</HI> Historian or other, would not have neglected to register it at a convenient Time with a Scoff and Ridicule, since that Nation was so ready to deride King <HI>Henry</HI> V's Design of invading them with a Return of Tennis Balls.</P>
<P>IN the Original Statutes of this Order, there is not the least Conjecture to countenance the Conceit of such a Feminine Institution, no not so much as laying an Obligation on the Knights-Companions to defend the Quarrels of Ladies (as some Orders then in being en∣joyned;) nor doth the Author of that Tract entitled <HI>In∣stitutio clarissimi Ordinis Militaris a praenobili subligaculo nun∣cupati,</HI> prefaced to the Black Book of the <HI>Garter,</HI> let fall the manifest Passage to ground it on.</P>
<P>As to what <HI>Polydore</HI> says, he is not so confident to ascertain the Person whose Garter it was; but cautiously declining that, says, it was either the Queen's, or the King's Mistress's; and if it were the latter, yet doth he o∣mit her Name and Title, both which (on what Authority we find not) are supplied by modern Historians, who call her <HI>Joan</HI> Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the same elsewhere cele∣brated by the Name of the <HI>Fair Maid</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> (whom <HI>Edward</HI> the Black Prince, afterward married) whereas no Historian ever gave the least Inuendo that King <HI>Edward</HI> III. ever courted her as a Mistress. <HI>Selden</HI> points at her when he calls the Lady, from whom the Garter slipp'd, Countess of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Salisbury:</HI> But about the Time when this Order was founded she in truth was dignified with neither Honour; for altho' she was Daughter to <HI>Tho.</HI> of <HI>Woodstock,</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and had been sometime the re∣puted Wife of <HI>William Mountague,</HI> second Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> yet then she cou'd not properly be accounted Countess of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> She was actually Wife to Sir <HI>Thomas Hol∣land,</HI> (one of the First Founders of the Order.) Nor was she yet (tho' afterwards) Countess of <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt,</HI> because her Brother <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> at the Institution of this Order, survived, and died not till 26 <HI>Edw.</HI> III.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="129"/>
THAT there was a Countess of <HI>Salisbury</HI> with whom King <HI>Edward</HI> III. became greatly enamour'd, <HI>Froissart</HI> re∣ports after this manner, <HI>That this King having relieved a Castle of that Earl's in the North, wherein his Countess had been besieged by the</HI> Scots <HI>(the Earl himself being at that time Prisoner in</HI> France;) <HI>upon sight of her extraordinary Beauty he fell in love with her; but she so virtuously demeaned her self, during his Abode there, that he declined further Solicita∣tion.</HI> However, some time after, the King out of De∣sire to see her, proclaim'd solemn Justs in <HI>London,</HI> whi∣ther this Countess and other Ladies being invited, came up. This Castle it seems was <HI>Wark</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> in <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> which King <HI>Edward</HI> had formerly bestowed on her Husband, for his good Service past, when he first espoused her, being then but a Knight.</P>
<P>ALTHO' it should be admitted that this Countess of <HI>Salisbury</HI> was the King's Mistress, yet must it be re∣mark'd, That she was Wife to <HI>William Mountague,</HI> Kt. created Earl of <HI>Salisbury, Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. Mother to <HI>William</HI> the before-mention'd second Earl, that her Christian Name was <HI>Catherine,</HI> not <HI>Alice,</HI> as <HI>Froissart,</HI> not <HI>Joan,</HI> as others call her, Daughter to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Granston,</HI> and that she expired 28 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. But that the whole may appear, what indeed it is, a meer Fable, we shall insert the Judgment of Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> who took great Pains in this Particular. <HI>This,</HI> says he, <HI>I take to be a vain and idle Romance, derogatory both to the Founder and the Order first published by</HI> Pol. Virgil, <HI>a Stranger to the Affairs of</HI> England, <HI>and by him taken upon no better ground than</HI> Fama Vulgi, <HI>the Tradition of the common People, too tri∣fling a Foundation to so great a Building.</HI></P>
<P><HI>OF the same Contexture with the former is another Tradition in</HI> Andrew du Chesne, That the Queen departing from the King to her own Apartments, and he following soon after, chanced to espy a Blue Garter lying on the Ground (sup∣posed to have slipp'd from her Leg) whilst some of his Atten∣dants carelesly passed by it, as disdaining to stoop at such a Trifle; but he knowing the Owner, commanded it to be gi∣ven him; at the Receipt of which he said, You make but small account of this Garter; but within few Months, I'll cause the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of you all to reverence it alike. <HI>Some suppose that the Motto was the Queen's Answer, when the King asked</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
<HI>her,</HI> What Men would conjecture of her, upon her losing her Garter in such a manner?</P>
<P>BOTH Relations are far distant from Fact; never∣theless it has thus far'd with other Orders of Sove∣reign Foundation, and an amorous, instead of an ho∣nourable Account, has been falsly render'd of their Institution; as for Instance, <HI>The Order of the</HI> Annun∣ciade, and that of <HI>The Golden Fleece.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a third Opinion grounded on a Relation made of King <HI>Rich.</HI> I. who, whilst his Forces were employ'd against <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Acon,</HI> and extremely tir'd and harrass'd with the Siege, he, by the Assistance and Mediation of St. <HI>George</HI> (as imagin'd) was inspir'd with fresh Courage, and bethought himself of a new Device, which was to tie about the Legs of a Number of Knights, a Leathern Thong Garter, for such had he then at hand, whereby they being emulated to future Glory, with Assurance of Reward if they prov'd victo∣rious, they might be excited to behave themselves in∣trepidly and well, much after the Examples of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> among whom were distributed various Crowns for several Causes, to adorn the Soldiers: But if King <HI>Richard</HI> I. did make use of this Device in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> as a Signal or Mark of Distinction of a Party, upon some warlike Exploit, yet that he took Occasion to create a distinct Order of Knighthood thereupon, there is not sufficient warrant to believe; (for it is only put down in the Preface of the <HI>Black Book,</HI> but not in any Part of the Annals of the Order; nor can it plead higher Antiquity than the Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. when written.) All the Advantage that can be made of it, is, to heighten the Reputation of that Saint among the <HI>English,</HI> by which Means the Garter came to be dedicated to him, and not that it contributed to its Institution.</P>

<P>§ 2. THE true Motive was therefore, neither the Ladies Garter, or King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Leathern Thong, that it owes it Original to: But King <HI>Edward,</HI> being a Person of consummate Vertue, gave himself up to military Affairs; and being engag'd in War for reco∣vering his Right to <HI>France,</HI> made use of the best Martialists
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
of the Age, did thereupon first design (in∣duc'd by its ancient Fame) the Restoration of King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Round Table,</HI> to invite hither the Gallant Spi∣rits from abroad, and endear them to himself; and ad∣judging no Place more requisite than <HI>Windsor,</HI> upon <HI>New-Year's-Day, A. D.</HI> 1344. he issu'd out Letters of Protection for the safe going and return of Foreign Knights, to try their Valour at the Solemn Justs to be held there on <HI>Monday</HI> after the Feast of St. <HI>Hilary</HI> fol∣lowing (which happen'd <HI>Jan.</HI> 19.) And these Letters of Safe-Conduct continu'd in force until the <HI>Octaves</HI> of the Purification of our blessed Virgin ensuing, being the 18th Year of his Reign. At the Time appointed, he provided a great Supper to begin the Solemnity, and then ordain'd this Festival to be annually at <HI>Whit∣sontide;</HI> and immediately after these first Exercises were over, for a future and better Accommodation, he im∣press'd Workmen and Carriages for erecting a particu∣lar Building in the Castle, and therein plac'd a Table of Two Hundred Foot Diameter, where the Knights should have their Entertainment of Diet, at his Ex∣pence of 100 <HI>l. per</HI> Week; to which Building he gave the Name of <HI>The Round Table.</HI> And as at these great Conventions the Days were spent in all Kinds of no∣ble Feats of Arms, Justs and Turnaments, so were a great Part of the Nights consum'd in publick Balls and dancing with the Ladies that attended the Queen thither; and perhaps it was hence conjectur'd, that at some of these Balls the Queen's Garter, or the Garter of <HI>Catherine,</HI> Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> might slip off, and the King's taking it up occasion Smiles in the By∣standers; and afterwards, when the King had modell'd his intended Order, a Garter offering it self for its chief Ensign, might add to the Conjecture; but that it was the principal Cause, is a groundless Imagination. And tho' King <HI>Edward</HI> advanc'd the Honour of the Garter, as to denominate the Order, yet was it not to enhance Reputation to, or perpetuate an effeminate Occasion, but to adorn Martial Prowess, with Ho∣nours, Rewards and Splendor; to increase Vertue and Valour in the Hearts of his Nobility, that so true Worth, after long and hazardous Exploits, should not
<PB N="124" REF="132"/>
enviously be depriv'd of that Glory which it hath in∣trinsically deserv'd, and that active and hardy Youths might not want a Spur in their Progression in the Paths of Vertue, which is to be esteem'd glorious and eternal.</P>
<P>IT is further observable, that the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Phi∣lip de Valoys,</HI> in Emulation of this Seminary at <HI>Windsor,</HI> set up a <HI>Round Table</HI> at his Court, and invited Knights and valiant Men of Arms out of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Almaine</HI> thi∣ther, left they should repair to our King <HI>Edward</HI> III. which meeting with Success, prov'd a Countermine to his main Design; who perceiving that his Hospitality towards strange Knights, upon Account of reviving King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s <HI>Round Table</HI> was too general, nor did suf∣ficiently ingratiate them to his Person, but being un∣constrain'd and at Liberty, did after their Departure take what Side they pleas'd in the ensuing Wars, he at length resolv'd upon a Projection more particu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar and select, and such as might oblige those whom he thought fit to make his Associates, in a lasting Bond of Friendship and Honour: And having issu'd forth his own Garter for the Signal of a Battle, that was crown'd with Success, (which is conceiv'd to be the Battle of <HI>Cressy,</HI> fought about Three Years after his erecting the <HI>Round Table;)</HI> upon so remarkable a Victory, he thence took Occasion to institute this Order, and gave the Garter Preheminence among the Ensigns of it, whence that select Number, whom he incorporated into a Fra∣ternity, are styl'd <HI>Equites Aureae Periscelidis,</HI> and vulgarly <HI>Knights of the Garter.</HI> By this Symbol he design'd to bind the Knights and Fellows of it mutually unto one anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and all of them joyntly to himself, as Sove∣reign of the Order; nor was his Expectation frustra∣ted, for it did not serve only as a vehement Spur and Incentive to Honour and martial Vertue, but also as a golden Bond of Unity and internal Society; and for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Consideration <HI>Cambden</HI> aptly calls it a Badge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nity and Concord.</P>
<P>BY the Symbols of this Garter the Knights are re∣minded, with all Religiousness, Sincerity, Friendliness, Faithfulness and Dexterity, not to leave the Pursuit of whatsoever they take in hand, nor to enterprize any
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>
Thing contrary to the Statutes of the Order; neither to frustrate the Rights of Peace and Friendship, nor vilify the Law of Arms, or proceed in any Thing far∣ther than Faith and Compact, or the Bond of Friend∣ship will admit. Moreover, in the binding of the Leg with this enobled Ensign, there was given this Caveat and Exhortation, that the Knights should not pusilla∣nimously (by running away from Battle) betray the Valour and Renown which is ingrafted in Constancy and Magnanimity. Nay, so exactly did the Founder contrive the whole Habit into the Signification of the Garter, that he ordain'd his and the Knights-Compa∣nions Robes and Ornaments to be all alike, both for Materials and Fashion, intimating thereby, That they ought to conserve brotherly Affection among them∣selves. The great Collar of the Order was made of equal Weight, and like Number of Knots and Links, in Token of the like Bond of Faith, Peace and Amity inviolably to be observ'd and retain'd amongst them: In fine, all Things were so design'd, that every one might plainly perceive how much these Things tended to the Maintenance of Amity and Concord.</P>
<P>IN further reference to the establishing this Order, the aforesaid King calling together the Earls, Barons, and principal Knights of his Kingdom, <HI>Freely,</HI> says <HI>Froissart, and obligingly declar'd his Mind to them concerning this Affair:</HI> To which <HI>all of them being well inclin'd, en∣tertain'd the Motion with equal Joy and Applause, deeming it would prove a very great Advancement to Piety, Nobility and Vertue, and likewise an excellent Expedient for the uni∣ting not only his Subjects one with another, but all Foreigners conjunctively with them, in the Bonds of Amity and Peace.</HI> And 'tis very improbable the prudent Founder should summon his Nobles to consult about the Grandeur of an Order, that had taken its Rise from so slight an Occasion as the dropping of a Garter from a Lady's Leg. Now, to draw the Tye of Friendship more close, the King caused those who were (or should be) of the Order, to be call'd <HI>Fellows, Associates, Colleagues, Brethren,</HI> and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and the Order it self a <HI>Society, Fellowship, College of Knights,</HI> and <HI>Knight-Companionship;</HI> and their Habits to be all alike, to represent how they
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>
ought to be united in all Chances and various Turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Fortune; Co-partners both in Peace and War, assi∣stant to one another in all serious and dangerous Ex∣ploits; and thro' the whole Course of their Lives to shew Fidelity and Friendliness one towards another. There are other Reasons assign'd, much to the same Effect, That the Order was instituted <HI>to fortifie the Con∣fidence of the King, the Kingdom and Martial Vertue;</HI> that is to say, <HI>to strengthen the Faith of the Subjects towards them, and for their greater Security,</HI> and <HI>because the Garter carries with it a Bond or Tye of Fellowship, and is a Symbol of Amity between Princes, being Companions of the same Order.</HI></P>
<P>IN the last Place, if we look upon the Statutes of its Institution, we shall find the Injunctions wholly Mili∣tary, and so are the Words of Admonition pronounc'd at the putting on the Ensigns of the Order: And the Ground of the Institution (in the Preamble to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's <HI>Exemplar)</HI> is said to be <HI>for the Honour of God and Exaltation of the Catholick Faith, joyn'd both with Piety and Charity, in establishing a College of religious Men to pray for the Prosperity of the Sovereign of the Order and the Knights-Companions, and to perform other holy Duties;</HI> as also <HI>or∣daining a Maintenance for a Company of Alms-Knights, who have not otherwise wherewith to support themselves;</HI> but not one Word relating to the Engagement on behalf of the feminine Sex.</P>
<P>AND whereas King <HI>Edw.</HI> III. had laid Claim by his Title to the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and in Right thereof assum'd its Arms, he from the Colour of them, 'tis said, caus'd the Garter to be made Blue, and the Circum∣scription Gold: And it may, without straining, be in∣ferr'd from the Motto, <HI>Honi soit qui mal y pense,</HI> that he retorted Shame and Defiance upon him that should dare to think amiss of so just an Enterprize, as he had undertaken for recovering of his lawful Right to that Crown; and that the Magnanimity and Bravery of those Knights, whom he had elected into this Or∣der, was such as would impower and enable them to maintain the Quarrel against all who thought ill of it. Consonant to this is the Conjecture of <HI>Harpsfield,</HI> that this Apophthegm was design'd to put the Knights-Companions
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>
in mind, <HI>Not to admit any Thing in their Actions, or among their Thoughts, derogatory to themselves and their Honour.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Age did exceedingly abound with Impresses, Motto's and Devices, and particularly King <HI>Edw.</HI> III. was so excessively given up to them, that his Apparel, Plate, Bed, Houshold-Furniture, Shields, and even the Harness of his Horses, and the like, were not without them, many of which now to descant upon would be a fruitless Attempt, seeing the Occasion of the Inven∣tion, and the Circumstances are lost, that should illu∣strate them; and others, by reason of their Brevity, seem'd insignificant, in regard something was design∣edly omitted, and left to be understood, which cannot now be rightly supply'd, so as to arrive at the Mind of the Inventor. Of this Number may be this Motto, <HI>It is as it is,</HI> which was embroider'd upon a Doublet of that King; tho' there are others which seem more easy to be decypher'd; as that daring Motto wrought upon his Surcoat and Shield provided to be used at a Tur∣nament,</P>

<P>§ 3. THE time when the Order was instituted, Hi∣storians differ widely about; <HI>Selden, Cowper,</HI> and others, from <HI>Froissart</HI> (who wrote <HI>temp. Rich.</HI> II.) would have it in the 18th of King <HI>Edw.</HI> III. But since <HI>Frois∣sart</HI> errs, in making the Number of Knights-Compa∣nions no fewer than Forty, which is a grand Mistake, Why might not he trip in Point of Time, and con∣found the Year of its Erection, with that wherein the Founder renew'd the Order of <HI>The Round Table, Wind∣sor</HI> being the Place for both. For should we admit, that during some Part of the Solemnity held in this King's 18th Year, when the Accident of the Lady's Garter slipping off happen'd, what other Inference can be made, but that he had only an Intention to put in Execution somewhat afterwards? Not that an Order was actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rected at that Time: Besides, the Jollity of the Season, the Greatness of the Concourse, and
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
the Splendidness of the Festivity, it was too busy a Time to suffer much Consultation tending thereunto; or at least to mould and model a Design so compleat and substantial, as it appears to have been even at first. If we joyn <HI>Fabian,</HI> he is plain, that tho' the King de∣sign'd the Institution at the End of the Festival, (which he places between <HI>Candlemas</HI> and <HI>Lent,</HI> in the 19th, and not 18th Year of that King) <HI>Yet was it not then,</HI> saith he, <HI>but afterwards establish'd by him.</HI> Never∣theless, Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> elsewhere observes, it had its Ori∣ginal in the 24th Year of the said King. And our in∣dustrious <HI>Stow</HI> (with whom <HI>Lily, Speed,</HI> and <HI>Segar</HI> agree) tells us, <HI>That the first Feast of the Order was celebrated</HI> A. D. 1350. which exactly agrees to the 24th of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. But <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> places it after the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> III. We must therefore have recourse to some other Proofs for elucidating this Point, since this Chro∣nological <HI>Aera</HI> of the true Time of its Institution hath wonderfully slipp'd the Pens of all Writers.</P>
<P>ADMITTING then that the erecting this Order was first thought of by King <HI>Edward,</HI> at some of those grand Assemblies of <HI>The Round Table,</HI> held after the <HI>French</HI> King had set up the like; yet was it not ma∣ture, or brought to any Perfection, till after his glorious Victories and Triumphs over the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> in the Battles of <HI>Cressy</HI> and <HI>Nevil</HI>'s Cross, (in the last of which the <HI>Scotch</HI> King, <HI>David,</HI> was taken Prisoner) and until King <HI>Edward</HI> had <HI>Calais</HI> surrendred to him, as will appear very conspicuous.</P>
<P>AMONG the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, is one containing the Account of all the King's Liveries, from <HI>Michaelmas Anno</HI> 21, to the 31st of <HI>Jan.</HI> 23 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. In the same are divers Things mention'd to be adorn'd with Garters, which were provided against the first grand Feast of St. <HI>G orge;</HI> and among the rest, the Royal Robes, <HI>viz.</HI> his Mantle, Surcoat and Hood; likewise a Bed of Blue Taffaty was bedeck'd with Gar∣ters, containing the Motto, <HI>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</HI> There were made for the Sovereign Three Harnesses, whereof Two were of White Velvet, wrought over with Garters <HI>de blu &amp; d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i per totum compedmein cum Woodhouses;</HI> and the Third <HI>de Velve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to Ynde cont.

<HI>quisseux &amp; caligas,</HI> wrought over likewise with Garters. Had the Roll been divided into Years, or had distinguishing Marks of Time upon it, we might have been guided with more Certainty as to the true Year of the Institution. However, we may thence conclude it was not founded in the 18th of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. because that the Sovereign's Robes were not made until the 22d Year of his Reign at soonest; perhaps not till the Beginning of the 23d. But to put the Matter beyond dispute, the Founder's Statutes fix the Time of Institution to his 23d Year; so do the Sta∣tutes of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. and the Preface to the <HI>Black Book, Leland, Mills</HI> and Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI> To conclude, when he had fix'd upon the Day and Place for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elebrating the first grand Feast of this Order, he sent his Heralds into <HI>Germany, France, Scotland, Burgundy, Hainault, Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> to invite all Knights and Esquires, (with Assurance of Safe-Conduct and Liberty for Fifteen Days, both before and after the grand Solemnity) to shew their military Prowess and other publick Exer∣cises there to be perform'd, proper to the Place and Occasion; agreeable to which Invitation, sundry Knights and Gallant Men came over to signalize their Valour; and what made the Solemnity more glorious, King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Queen was there present, attended with Three Hundred of the fairest Ladies, in all imaginable Splendor and Gaity.</P>

<P>§ 4. THE Patrons of the Order were several, under whose Protection (according to the Custom of the Age) King <HI>Edw.</HI> III. put himself and all the Knights-Compa∣nions, that the Affairs of the Order might be defended, preserved and govern'd.</P>
<P>THE <HI>first</HI> and chiefest which he elected, was the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> which in a more especial Manner was in∣vocated to the Aid and Assistance of this Order.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> St. <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> a most choice Cham∣pion of Christ and famous Martyr, was also elected one of the Patrons to this Order by King <HI>Edward</HI> III. not so much as he was a Professor of the Christian Faith, or for that he was an armed Soldier or Knight of Christ, but so much the more because in those Wars, which were waged by the Christians against the Infi∣dels, he by several Appearances manifested his Pre∣sence as a most certain Encourager and Assistant to the Christians; the Relations whereof may be seen in Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s History, who hath laboriously and judiciously maintain'd the History of this Saint, against those that will not allow him a Place in Heaven, or a Being in the Church. In like manner the learned <HI>Selden</HI> hath avouch'd him to be the special Patron, Protector, De∣fender, and Advocate of this Realm of <HI>England;</HI> and has made it plainly appear in what Veneration he hath been honour'd abroad, especially among the Eastern Nations.

<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> The Founder added a fourth Patron, whose Name himself bore, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> his Predecessor, King of <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and;</HI> and we find he was wont to be invocated by this Founder, as well as St. <HI>George,</HI> in any great Difficulties and Streights. <HI>Wal∣singham</HI> gives an Instance at the Skirmish of <HI>Calais, A. D.</HI> 1349. when King <HI>Edward,</HI> in great Anger and Grief, drew out his Sword, and most passionately cry'd out, <HI>Ha St.</HI> Edward, <HI>Ha St.</HI> George; which his Soldiers hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, ran presently to him, and rushing violently upon the Enemy, put many of them to the Sword. These Four Patrons we find recorded together in the Preamble of the Foundation of <HI>Windsor</HI> College by King <HI>Edward</HI> III. tho' in the Preamble to his Statutes of the Order, and to King <HI>Henry</HI> V's Statutes, St. <HI>Edward the Confessor</HI> is omitted; nevertheless he is enumerated with the rest in the Preamble to King <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry</HI> VIII's.</P>

<P>§ 5. As to the Honour and Reputation of this Noble Order, either in Comparison with others, or in Refe∣rence to it self, it challenges the Precedency of Anti∣quity, before the eldest Rank of Honour of that Kind any where establish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Second<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> The Statutes of the Foundation were so ex∣quisitely and judiciously devised and compacted, upon such solid Foundations of Honour and Nobleness, that they afterwards became a Precedent to other Orders; and gave the Plan to those Two of <HI>The Golden Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ece</HI> and
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
of Monsieur St. <HI>Michael,</HI> as is manifest by comparing their Statutes.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is no small Honour that accrues to this Order, that the Number of these Knights-Companions were never encreas'd, but as they were Twenty Six with the Sovereign, so they now thus continue, <HI>ut Pretium faciat raritas;</HI> for the infringing this Article hath split several other military Orders into Contempt and Ruin, as nothing more tarnishing, or throwing a fully on the Worth of Glory and Honour, than when render'd so vulgar, and indifferently disposed without Distinction and Merit, as is exemplify'd in <HI>The Order of the</HI> Star, and the now declining <HI>Order of St.</HI> Mi∣chael.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It has receiv'd more additional Lustre by being honour'd with the Companionship of divers Em∣perors, Kings and Sovereign Princes, who esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it the Summit of their Glory, and the highest Trophy of additional Honour, to be enroll'd in the Number. In∣somuch that some of them with Impatience courted the Election. For we find recorded in the Register, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1672. Eight Emperors of <HI>Germany,</HI> Three Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> Five <HI>French</HI> Kings, Two Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Five Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> Five Kings of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Two Kings of <HI>Sweden,</HI> One King of <HI>Poland,</HI> One King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> Two Kings of <HI>Naples,</HI> besides divers Dukes and other free Princes; as One Duke of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> One Duke of <HI>Holland,</HI> Two Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> Two Dukes of <HI>Bruns∣wick,</HI> One Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> Two Dukes of <HI>Urbin,</HI> One Duke of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> One Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Two Dukes of <HI>Holstein,</HI> One Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and One Duke of <HI>Wertem∣berg,</HI> Seven Count Palatines of the <HI>Rhin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Four Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> and One Marquis of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> It entitles those Knights and Noblemen, whose Vertue hath rais'd them to this Pitch of Greatness, to be Companions and Associates with Emperors and Kings, a Prerogative of an high Nature, and a suffici∣ent Recompence for the greatest Merit.

<HEAD>CAP. VI. The Statutes and Annals of the Order.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>ORDER and Regularity is not only the Beauty and Symmetry of Government and Societies, but also greatly contributes to their Establishment and Perpetuity. Statutes and Rules are as well the Bounds to determine, as Bonds to unite Fellowship and Societies together; and if either fall into difuse, or be unadvisedly broken, they open a Field to Disso∣lution and Ruin.</P>
<P>SUCH like Considerations mov'd and excited the vi∣ctorious King <HI>Edward</HI> III. (after he had determin'd the Erection of this most renown'd <HI>Order of the Garter)</HI> to <HI>devise and institute several laudable Statutes and Ordinances, to be duly observ'd and kept within the said Order;</HI> which being collected into one Body, are call'd <HI>The Statutes of Institution.</HI></P>
<P>THE Original of these was ordain'd to be kept with∣in the Treasury of the College of <HI>Windsor,</HI> but hath long since wholly perish'd; yet a Transcript of them is recorded in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. in an old Book call'd <HI>Registrum Ordinis Chartaceum.</HI> Two more ancient <HI>Exemplars</HI> of this Body of Statutes are also in being; the one in the Library of the Lord <HI>Hatton,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Black Book</HI> of the Order; and comparing them together, I shall here give from the <HI>Latin</HI> the Heads they consist of.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE King of <HI>England,</HI> his Heirs and Successors, are to be Sovereigns or Superiors of this Order.</P>
<P N="2">2. NONE are to be admitted, unless he be a Gen∣tleman of Blood, and that he be a Knight and without Reproach.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Knights-Companions were to be Twenty Six, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach to have at <HI>Windsor</HI> a Mantle and Garter for the better Splendor of the Order; to wear the said
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
Habit whensoever they go to the Chapel of St. <HI>George</HI> or Chapter-House, to hold a Chapter, or do any thing relating to their Order. In like manner they are to wear the Habit upon the Vigils of St. <HI>George,</HI> in their Procession from the King's Lodgings to the Chapel or Chapter-House, and returning back, and during Sup∣per, continue so habited till it be over, and likewise on the Morrow of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, at Chapel, Dinner-time, Supper-time, and afterwards all the said Day, until the Sovereign or his Deputy shall deposite the Ensigns of the Order, and decree their Departure.</P>
<P N="4">4. THERE were to be Thirteen Canons Secular, who at the Time of their Institution, or within a Year, were to be Priests, and as many Vicars already Priests, or to be made so at the next Ordination, answerable to the number of the Knights-Companions; these religious Persons to be presented by the several Founders each one, and upon the Death or Vacancy of such presented, the Sovereign of the Order ever afterwards to have the Nomination of them, who were bound to pray for the good Estate of the Sovereign and his Kingdom, and particularly for this Order.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE Canons were to wear a Purple Mantle, with the Arms of St. <HI>George</HI> in a Roundle upon their right Shoulder.</P>
<P N="6">6. THERE were to be Twenty Six poor veterane Knights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach to have a competent Subsistence, their Election to be after the manner of the Canons afore∣said.</P>
<P N="7">7. THESE Knights were to have a Red Mantle, with the Arms of St. <HI>George;</HI> but without any Circle of the Garter about it.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF the Sovereign could not be present at the solemn Festival of St. <HI>George,</HI> his Deputy was to supply his Place at the Charge of the Sovereign; but such Depu∣ty was not to make any new Ordinances, tho' he has License to correct or amend the old Ones.</P>
<P N="9">9. EVERY Year, upon the Vigils of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Knights-Companions within the Realm, or elsewhere, if conveniently, are to assemble, at <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, and be present there at the Celebration of Divine Service, in the Habit of the Order, where placed regularly in
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
their Stalls or Seats, directly over their Heads their Helmets and Swords, &amp;c. are to be hung up, and re∣main as long as such Knights live, in Honour of them, and to signify the Defence of the Church, to which they are obliged as a Military Order; but in case the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> happens to fall within the Quin∣dene or Fifteen Days after the Feast of <HI>Easter,</HI> then it was to be prorogued to the <HI>Sunday</HI> next following, ac∣counting Fifteen Days from <HI>Easter</HI> Day, that every Knight-Companion might have reasonable time to come, nor be forced to ride upon any of the Three <HI>Easter</HI> Holy-days.</P>
<P N="10">10. THAT they meet in St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel yearly, on the Eve of St. <HI>George,</HI> at the Hour of Three in the Af∣ternoon; and if they come not at the Time assigned, without a just Excuse, which the Sovereign or his De∣puty allows, their Penalty is to be according to the Ordinance of the Chapter; which is, That they shall not enter into the Chapter Door for that time, but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay without, and shall have no Voice in any thing that is done in the said Chapter; and if they come not before the Beginning of Vespers, they shall not enter into their Stalls, but shall tarry below before the said Stalls in the Choiristers Places during Vespers. The like Penalty is ordain'd for not coming to the Mass or Morn∣ing-Service betime, and at Vespers, on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day; and whosoever shall absent himself wholly from this Solemnity, without sufficient Excuse and Leave from the Sovereign or Deputy, he is not to enter within his Stall the next Feast after, but shall stay below, and be∣fore his Stall, as it is said at Vespers, and in the Mor∣rows Procession must walk before the Three processional Crosses, [now the Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risters,] and at Mass [Service] shall sit below until the Offering, and he to offer last. After which he is to come before the Sove∣reign, or his Deputy's Stall, and ask Pardon, which re-instates him in his Stall. Absenting the next second Time upon the Feast, without Leave, he has no Stall allowed him until he hath given and offered a Jewel upon St. <HI>George</HI>'s Altar, to the Value of Twenty Marks, which is to be double every Year until a Reconci∣liation.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="136" REF="144"/>
11. WHERESOEVER they be, they must wear their Blue Robes from the Beginning of the first Vespers, on the Eve of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, to the second Vespers on the Morrow inclusive, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="12">12. IF any Knight-Companion appears publickly without his dignifying Garter, upon challenging the same, is to pay half a Mark to the Custos and College.</P>
<P N="13">13. AT the Times of Offering, each associated with the other who holds the opposite Stall, are to march in Procession together to make their Offerings; but a∣lone, when his Consort is absent, and so that in all Pro∣cessions the Sovereign goes last.</P>
<P N="14">14. IN the Morrow after the Solemnity of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast is over, before their separating, a Mass <HI>de Requie</HI> or Office <HI>de Defunctis</HI> was to be used, at which the Knights-Companions were all entirely to be present, without necessary Impediment shown to the Sovereign or Deputy for Liberty to depart.</P>
<P N="15">15. THEY were to leave their Robes at <HI>Windsor</HI> al∣ways, to be ready for them there upon any sudden Oc∣casions that might evene.</P>
<P N="16">16. JOURNYING near <HI>Windsor,</HI> in Honour of the Place, unless lawful Cause obstructs, they must take it in their Way, and assuming the Habit of the Order the Canons wore, devoutly to meet and conduct them into the Chapel; where, if it happens to be time of Divine Service, they are to hear the same; if not, they are to be detained no longer than while the Canons shall say the Psalm <HI>de profundis</HI> for the Defunct, and during their own Offering: But if any had riden thro' the Town, without visiting the Chapel and offering there, for every Neglect he must go one Mile on Foot from the said Chapel, to shew his Obedience, and offer an Half-Penny in Honour of St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. UPON first Notice of the Death of any of the Or∣der, the Sovereign shall ordain a Thousand Masses, every Foreign Prince shall cause Eight Hundred, a Prince of Wales Seven Hundred, a Duk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Six Hun∣dred, an Earl Three Hundred, every Baron Two Hundred, and every Knight Batchellor One Hundred Masses to be celebrated for the Good of the Soul departed;
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
which neglected for a Quarter of a Year after notice of such Death, the Masses are to be doubled; upon half a Year's Neglect, again doubled; and so from Time to Time in like Form till the End of the Year, and then the Year's to be doubled.</P>
<P N="18">18. UPON sure Notice of the Death of a Knight-Companion, the Sovereign, or his Deputy, is to con∣verse by Letters, the Remainder [not Strangers] that are within the Kingdom, to meet him within Six Weeks in some convenient Place, and elect another; which as∣sembled, at least Six, with the Sovereign or Deputy, e∣very of them present is to name Nine of the worthiest and sufficientest Knights without Reproof that he knows, whether native Subjects or Foreigners, sobeit they hold no contrary Party, or be against the Sove∣reign, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Earls, or of sublimer Title; Three Barons, and Three Knights Batchellors, which Names the Bishop of <HI>Windsor,</HI> for the Time being, was to write, or, in his Absence, the Dean or Register, and, in their Absence, the oldest Residencer in the College, and after shew them to the Sovereign, who is to chuse out of them him that has the most Voices, and whom he esteems the most beneficial to the Crown and King∣dom. Every Knight failing to appear at an Election, without an approved Cause, was to pay to the Custos and College the Penalty of a Mark, and at his next coming to the Chapter shall kneel upon the Ground, in the midst of the Chapter, before the Sovereign or De∣puty, until Reconciliation.</P>
<P N="19">19. SOON after Election, the Knight-Companion elect is to have a Garter, in token of his Election, and that he is a Fellow of the Order; and as soon as decreed to take Possession of his Stall, but not before, is to have a Mantle, which, if he dies before he receiv'd, he was not to be accounted as one of the Order, because he wanted Possession; nevertheless he was to have one half of the Masses abovesaid, because he had the Gar∣ter deliver'd to him and nothing beside. If he was not installed within a Year after his receiving the Garter, and especially if within the Realm, and without rea∣sonable Excuse to be allowed of by the Sovereign or Deputy, his Election became void, and they might proceed
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
to a new one: Moreover, neither the Sword nor Helmet was to be put upon his Stall within the Castle, before his coming; to the End, that if the Knight elect came not, his Atchievements might not be unhandsomly taken down and abused, but honourably removed in∣to the Choir for the publick Use and Profit of the said College.</P>
<P N="20">20. EVERY Foreigner elected was to have Certifica∣tion of such his Election from the Sovereign, at the Sovereign's Charge, who was to send him the Garter and the Mantle, and a Copy of the Statutes of the Or∣der, under the Common Seal of the said Order, with∣in Four Months after the Election, the better for him to advise on; which being accepted, of whatsoever Con∣dition he be, he was obliged within Eight Months after to send a sufficient Proxy, according to his State and Dignity, a Knight irreprehensible to be installed in his Room, and who was to bring with him a Silk Mantle of the Blue Colour of the Order, also a Sword and Helmet to remain at <HI>Windsor,</HI> which Mantle was be put upon the right Shoulder of the Proxy, by the Sove∣reign or Deputy at the time of Installment, when he is introduced to take the Stall in the Name of his Lord and Master; neither was he to deposite the same till the End of Divine Service; after which he was not to wear it, nor be admitted in the Chapter-House, or have any Suffrage, by virtue of any Powers vested in him; but this Favour Foreigners elected by Proxy were to have, that could not personally come themselves, they were to be Partakers of the whole Masses and Orisons of the Order; whereas, if they died before the Installation, they were to have but a Moity of them.</P>
<P N="21">21. UPON the Death of any Earl, [or of Superior Dignity] Baron, or Knight Batchellor, his Successor, whether Earl, [or of Superior Dignity] Baron, or Knight, was to have a vacant Stall of his Pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssor, without any changing of Places, except the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> alone, who was to have always the next Stall, and opposite to the Sovereign; so that it may happen for a Knight to have an Earl's Place, or an Earl a Knight's Place; and this because the first Founders might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nown.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="139" REF="147"/>
22. EVERY Knight-Companion at his first Entrance, was to give a certain Alms, according to their Eminence and Degree, for the perpetual Maintenance of the Ca∣nons and Poor Knights, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sovereign Forty Marks, a Foreign King Twenty Pounds, a Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> Twenty Marks, a Duke Ten Pounds, an Earl Ten Marks, a Baron a Hundred Shillings, and a Knight Batchellor Five Marks, that by these pious Don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions they might justly entitle themselves to the Name and Privileges of the Order; wherefore, before these Pay∣ments were rightly performed, their Sword and Helmet [Atchievements] were not to be hung up, and for Fo∣reigners the Sovereign was obliged to pay himself.</P>
<P N="23">23. UPON the Death of any of the Founders his Arms, in a Plate of Metal, was to be fixed upon the Back of his Stall, and their Successors were to have the like, but to be placed underneath their Predecessors, and not to be so great as those of the first Founders.</P>
<P N="24">24. AT Admission every Knight-Companion must promise and swear personally, or by Proxy, faithfully to observe the Statutes of the Order, and none are to be installed by Proxy but Foreigners only, which can∣not conveniently come in Person.</P>
<P N="25">25. IF the Sovereign be out of <HI>England</HI> at the Instal∣lation of any Knight-Companion, or could not attend himself to do what appertains to him in that Point, he might impower and authorize any of the Fellows to of∣ficiate for him.</P>
<P N="26">26. THAT there be a Common Seal or Signet Keeper, whom the Sovereign was to assign.</P>
<P N="27">27. EVERY Knight-Companion was to have a Copy of the Statutes under the Seal of the Order, the Ori∣ginal sealed likewise with the said Seal, to remain for evermore within the Treasury of the College, and upon the Death of any Knight-Companion, his Executors were to send back such Copy to be deliver'd to the Cu∣stos or Warden.</P>
<P N="28">28. NO Knight-Companion was to go out of the Realm and Dominion of <HI>England,</HI> without the Know∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge and Licence of the Sovereign, who of Grace and Favour is bound to grant it upon a Military Expedition, or other notable Act appertaining to the Honour of
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
Knighthood, in Preference and Advancement of this Order of St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. THEY were not to arm themselves against each other, but in the Wars of their Sovereign Lord, in his right and just Quarrel; and if it happen'd that any of the Order should be retain'd in the Cause and Quarrel of any Lord, and the adverse Party desir'd another Knight-Companion on his Side, that latter Knight isby no means to agree but to excuse himself in all Things, because his Fellow was armed on the other Side, and was retain'd before him. And every Knight was bound to except and agree, at his being retain'd, that he may have his Discharge from the Wars, upon any of the Order's being engaged in Arms before him for the con∣trary Party; and if the second retained knows not of it, upon notice that any of his Fellows were retained be∣fore him, and armed on the contrary Side, the second retained Knight was to excuse himself to his Master, and relinquish the Quarrel.</P>
<P N="30">30. ALL Licences given to the Knight-Companions to travel in quest of Honour by Military Exploits; also all Certificates, mandatous Letters, Certificates, and o∣ther Writings whatsoever relating to the Order, were to be issued out by the Sovereign, under the Seal of the Order, to remain in the keeping of one of the Order, during the Sovereign's Pleasure. And if the Keeper of the Seal absent himself upon reasonable Cause, he was to leave the Seal with another of the Fellowship that the Sovereign should appoint, to the Intent that the Seal at no time be out of the Presence of the Sove∣reign, he being within his Dominion. And in like manner concerning the Seal in the Absence of the Sove∣reign or the Deputy.</P>
<P N="31">31. IF any Knight-Companion for Devotion sake should desire to dwell at <HI>Windsor,</HI> he was to maintain himself at his own, and not at the College Charge.</P>
<P N="32">32. ANY other Knight, not of the Order, upon the Account of Devotion, that would reside there, was to be provided for at the Appointment of the Sovereign, and the Fellowship also. Any Knight or other Person giving 10 <HI>l.</HI> yearly Rents or Lands, or more, to the College, to participat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their Prayers and Suffrages,
<PB N="141" REF="149"/>
he was to be registred in the Calendar of Benefactors, and continually be pray'd for by the Canons and Poor Knights.</P>
<P N="33">33. UPON the Death of any Canon, the Custos or Warden is to certify the same by Letters to the Sove∣reign, if beyond Sea, to know whom he pleases to pre∣sent to the Canonship.</P>
<P N="34">34. THERE was to be a Register appointed by the Sovereign and Fellowship, the most intelligent Person of the College, who was to be present at the Chapters, to record their Elections and the Electors, their Punish∣ments, and Causes of them, with their Reconciliations, all Acts whatsoever administred in their Council, from Chapter to Chapter yearly; for the faithful Execution of which Office he was to be sworn at his Admission therein; and whatsoever had been register'd was in the Beginning of the following Chapter, on the Vigils of St. <HI>George,</HI> to be publickly recited before the Sovereign and the whole Fellowship, that what was amiss and incorrect might be mended and reduced to due Form.</P>

This was a Task of Three Years compleat before it rose to Perfection, <HI>viz. April</HI> 23. <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. for then the Sovereign, out of right singular Love, well-temper'd Zeal, and entire Affection to this most noble Order, to the Estate of Chivalry, and the Continuance and Encrease thereof; as also at the humble Request and instant Importunity of the then Knights-Companions, and by their Ad∣vice, Counsel and Consent, did interpret and eluci∣date all the Obscurities, Doubts and Ambiguities of the former Statutes and Ordinances. Divers Affairs contain'd in Fifty of them being explain'd and amended; he made likewise necessary Additions, the Original whereof being sign'd and seal'd, were commanded to be carefully laid up in the Treasury of <HI>Windsor</HI> Col∣lege, to remain as a Standard to succeeding Times; yet they have not been seen there these many Years past.</P>

<P>§ 3. THERE have been several Endeavours since the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. for reforming the Statutes. As first, King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. who as Sovereign, by the Orders themselves, had an undoubted Prerogative set him to alter and reform many Things which seem'd inconsistent with the Religion he establish'd. To which Purpose, at a Chapter at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> held <HI>April</HI> 23. in the Third Year of his Reign, the Lord <HI>St. John,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Paget,</HI> were to peruse and make them agreeable to the King's other Proceed∣ings, by the Assistance and Advice of the Protector, the Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and other Companions. This was follow'd by a subsequent Order pass'd in the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter at <HI>Greenwich</HI> the Year after, that the Statutes should be reform'd and corrected as they thought expedient: And for the better Accomplishment of their Design, at the next Feast, <HI>April</HI> 24. 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. another Order commenc'd, impowering the Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> the Mar∣quess of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Warwick, Arundel, Bedford</HI> and <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> to peruse and amend the Statures and other Books of the Order, which were brought to some tolerable Degree of Perfection; for thereupon a new Body was collected (in general very much alter∣ing the Laws of the Order) and publish'd <HI>March</HI> 17. <HI>Anno</HI> 7 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. But this King within Four Months after expiring, Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> his Sister and Successor, the very first Thing she transacted was to abrogate and make them void; wherefore we need not mention them, as never in use and unrevived. For the Execu∣tion of which Purpose, she conven'd a Chapter at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, the 27th of <HI>September</HI> following; and it was then decreed, that the said Laws and Ordinances, as inconvenient, impertinent, and tending to Novelty,
<PB N="146" REF="154"/>
should be disannulled, and no Account to be made of them for the future; and for the quicker Execution, Sir <HI>William Petre</HI> (that Day admitted Chancellor) had Or∣ders to see them speedily expung'd out of the Book of Statutes, and forthwith defac'd, lest any Memory of them should remain to Posterity; and only those of her Father, <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and his Royal Predecessors, should be retain'd.</P>
<P>IN this Affair King <HI>Philip,</HI> her Husband, appear'd no less zealous; for on the 5th of <HI>August,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> (which was the 3d Day after he had been invested with the Habit) himself being present at a Chapter at <HI>Windsor,</HI> it was ordain'd, That all Acts and Decrees in the Great Book, [<HI>i.e.</HI> the <HI>Black Book</HI> afore∣said] which were repugnant and disagreeable, either with the ancient and receiv'd Statutes of the Order, or else with the Laws of the Realm, should clearly be abolish'd and erased, by the Marquis of <HI>Winchester,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Arund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, Pembroke,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Paget.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner was Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> fix'd on the Throne, but soon after, <HI>viz.</HI> on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, in the second Year of her Reign, a View of the Statutes was com∣mitted, by Commission, to Four of the Knights-Com∣panions, <HI>viz.</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Effing∣ham,</HI> who were thereby impower'd to peruse and con∣sider those Statutes with the utmost Care and regard, if any of them were repugnant to the Religion, Laws and Statutes of the Realm; and if any such were re∣corded, to represent them faithfully to the Sover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign, that she, in Conjunction with the Knights-Companions, might establish such Decrees concerning them as she should think sit; but that any thing was done in pur∣suance hereunto, doth not appear; for the Transcripts of her Father's Body of the Statutes, throughout the Time of her Reign, were presented to the Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts-Companions at their Instailations; and the Practice of her Time was pursuant to the Direction therein, except in some few Things now and then added or alter'd at future Chapters, when there arose fresh Matters for such Expedients.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="155"/>
KING <HI>James</HI> I. her Successor, revolv'd something to∣wards a new Regulation; and in order to put it in Execution, the 14th of <HI>May,</HI> in the 9th Year of his Reign, decreed, That Commissionary Letters should be granted to the Earls of <HI>Nottingham, Worcester, Pem∣broke</HI> and <HI>Northampton,</HI> to empower them to examine the Registers and other Monuments which pertained to that Order; and where any Passage should be found obsolete or obscure, to make it conspicuous and clear; where Contrariety appear'd, fitly to reconcile it; yet with no Design of innovating any Thing, but an Inten∣tion of renewing all, as near as might be, to the first Standard and most ancient Institution of the Order; saving always Power to himself, as Sovereign of the Order, to add or diminish any Matter (according to the Occasion) as it should seem agreeable to his Pru∣dence for the Honour of this Most Noble Order. What Progress they made in this Commission, the Memoirs of that Time are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>silent in; but some few Years after, this Affair was reviv'd, and another was issu'd forth, to the Earls of <HI>Nottingham, Worc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster, South∣ampton, Arundel</HI> and <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and the Viscount <HI>Lisle,</HI> all Knights-Companions, dated <HI>April</HI> 26. in the 16th Year of his Reign; which Six, or any Four of them, were thereby constituted to take an exact Survey of all the ancient Statutes and Articles of the said Order; and authoriz'd to call before them all such Persons, whe∣ther Officers of the said Order, or others, as could give any Light or Information concerning that Affair; and after a serious Deliberation, to pen down what in them they conceiv'd meet to be explain'd, and what to be added, whereby to render the Order more illustri∣ous, that the same being presented to the Sovereign and the Society, at a Chapter holden, might be resolv'd on in part, or in all, to be put in Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cution, if it seem'd so good to that King.</P>
<P>THIS Affair mov'd very slowly; but towards the latter End of his Reign, the Earls of <HI>Worcester, Mont∣gomery, Arundel, Surry</HI> and <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester,</HI> Five of the Six Commissioners above-nam'd, having held divers Con∣ferences, and debated several Matters represented to them, and at a Chapter convened at <HI>Whitehall</HI> the 19th
<PB N="148" REF="156"/>
of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 20 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. did present to the Sovereign certain Articles, subscribed with their Hands, which, for the Honour of the Order, they thought requisite to be duly observ'd.</P>
<P>BY the first of which they made Provision for a fur∣ther Progression and Advancement of the illustrious In∣stitution, in proposing, that every Year a Commission from the Sovereign should be granted, or continu'd to such Knights of the Order as the Chapter should pitch on, to deliberate and weigh all Affairs that fell under the Order, and that the Year after, an Estimate, by the Knights in Chapter, should be exhibited, of their Re∣solutions and Proceedings by Virtue of the said Com∣mission. This, with Eight other Articles, were con∣firm'd by the Sovereign and Twelve of the Knights-Companions, the 22d of <HI>May</HI> following, in a Chapter held at <HI>Whitehall;</HI> and so prosperously their Endeavours succeeded, that on the Feast-day of St. <HI>George,</HI> at <HI>Windsor</HI> in the ensuing Year, the Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> (being then the Sovereign-Deputy) with Ten Knights-Companions more, gave their assent to Eight other Articles (most of them concerning the Alms-Knights) which the Morning after had the Approbation of the Sovereign; and before the Celebration of Divine Service, by his Deputy and Companions assembled in the Chapter-House, the Observation thereof was duly decreed.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Charles</HI> I. design'd and endeavour'd the most compleat and absolute Reformation of any of his Pre∣decessors; and at the Solemnity of St. <HI>George,</HI> held at <HI>Windsor</HI> the 6th of <HI>October,</HI> in the 6th Year of his Reign, He commission'd Nine Knights-Companions, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earls of <HI>Mulgrave, Pembroke, Montgomery, Arund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, Surry, Salisbury, Carlisle, Dorset, Holland, Berkshire</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> with command to assemble Four Times in a Year, to take into their Consideration the Affairs of the Order; all which, but the Earls of <HI>Mulgrave</HI> and <HI>Dorset,</HI> met at <HI>Whitehall</HI> the 2d of <HI>January</HI> following, where some few Matters fell under their Consultation. This Commis∣sion was seconded by one of a larger extent about Three Months after, and directed to the said Knights-Companions, or to any Eight, Seven, Six, Five or Four of them, empowering them to meet and devise,
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
and exactly preponderate all the Statutes and Ordinan∣ces of the Order, as well such as were established at the Foundation, as those that had been since made, by Explanation or Addition, and to weigh advisedly whe∣ther any Thing had been enacted, that had caused Doubt or Ambiguity, or stood in need of any Change or Amendment; and if upon mature Deliberation by them thus conven'd, there should appear any Contrariety or Defect, for want of plain Expression, or other Omissi∣on, fit to be supplied, tending to the Honour of the Order, That then the Sovereign might, upon Return of their Proceedings, resolve upon some general Decla∣ration in Chapter, to reform and reduce into one Body all the Statutes and Ordinances thereof, that the same being compil'd and settled in one perfect Model, might be so consign'd to Posterity, free from all future Questi∣ons and Doubts.</P>
<P>NEVER THELESS not any thing was done upon this Commission, tho' it stood in force even from the 6th to the 13th Year of this King's Reign; but where the Neglect lay History does not fully inform us, tho' it may be conjectur'd by what follows.</P>
<P>AT the Feast of St. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orge,</HI> celebrated by Prorogation at <HI>White-hall,</HI> for the Year 1636. upon the 17th, 18th, and 19th Days of <HI>April,</HI> 1637. divers Petitions for Re∣formation, and reducing of Matters to their pristine Constitution, were presented to the Sovereign by the Chancellor, and read; some of which, more especial∣ly, tending to set off and encrease the Honour of the Order, were received and decreed by the Sovereign, and the rest referr'd to the said Knights-Commissioners. The first of those Decrees which at that time had its Sanction, was to revive and renew the Powers given in the former Commission; and thereupon a new one, dated the 7th of <HI>May</HI> following, was issued under the Great Seal of the Order, and directed to the Earls of <HI>Mulgrave, Darby, Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Montgomery, Arundel,</HI> and <HI>Surry, Kelly, Salisbury, Dorset, Holland, Barkshire, Suffolk, Lyndsey, Exeter,</HI> Marquiss <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Darby, Moreton,</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> or to Three or more of them, to meet and consult of any Matters contain'd in the Statutes, or for Honour of
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
the Order. These Knights-Commissioners were en∣dow'd with all the plenary Powers given in the foresaid Commission, dated 6 <HI>Car.</HI> I. unto which was granted a further Addition, for the better effecting the Sovereign's Care: That Three or more of them should meet at the Sovereign's Court, and begin to put the said Com∣mission in execution in <HI>Whitson</HI> Week next ensuing, at∣tended and assisted by the Chancellor of the Order, and all, or any other Officers, or such of them as they should fix on, or find serviceable. And being assem∣bled, to have free Liberty to hear, propound, and de∣bate of whatsoever shall fall under their Cognisance, or that they should conceive conducible to the Honour and perfect Establishment of so Illustrious and Noble a Body. And to prepare all Matters of such their Re∣solutions and Debates to be laid before the Sovereign at the next Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> and so successively at e∣very Chapter so appointed by him, to receive his full Determination, Approbation, and Royal Assent, with further Power to adjourn from time to time, after the first Opening and Reading of the said Commission; their Meetings to be in such Places, and on such Days as should seem most convenient to them.</P>
<P>NOW who wou'd suppose, that after so Noble an In∣tention of the Sovereign, and his earnest Solicitude to issue forth a second Commission, his hearty recom∣mending and exciting their Deligence for a speedy Dis∣patch, and lastly, his expecting an Account of their Transactions the next Feast, these honourable Persons, Companions of the Order, should need a Spur to ac∣complish so laudable a Design; but it was so.</P>
<P>FOR altho' the Commission was opened at <HI>White-hall</HI> the 30th of <HI>May</HI> following, in the Presence of the Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Montgomery, Salishury, Holland,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> Commissi∣oners; yet Sir <HI>Thomas Row</HI> Chancellor, in his Letter to Dr. <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> dated the 4th of <HI>June,</HI> 1637. sad∣ly complained, That it was much as he could do to draw together Five of the Knights-Companions, to o∣pen and read the Commission, and this <HI>quasi in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ransi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> was in Confusion and Hurry, and all that was transacted was to appoint another Convention at Court in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>summer</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
Week then next ensuing, and charge the Chan∣cellor to prepare Matter (for Propositions and Observa∣tions upon the Statutes) fit for their Consultations a∣gainst that Appointment, according to the Tenor of the Commission. And in another Place writes, That he found such Difficulty to procure Meetings, and as cer∣tain <HI>non Chalance</HI> in every one, as if it were but a cere∣monious Affair, and so few hearty in it, that he feared he and the Officers should wait to little Purpose: And so indeed it fell out; for albeit he att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded in <HI>Midsummer</HI> Week, according to their Direction, yet there was no∣thing dispatch'd, save only the adjourning of their Meeting to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>SOME little Progress was afterwards made in this Af∣fair at <HI>White-hall</HI> the 8th of <HI>February</HI> following, where Three of them were present, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earls of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk∣shire, Lindsey,</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who order'd the Chancellor, Register, and Garter, to prepare an Abbre∣viation of the Statutes, and reduce every thing of one Head into an Act, to keep up to Method, and avoid Confusion.</P>
<P>THE 1st of <HI>February</HI> after, another Assembly of Seven of the Knights-Commissioners was held at <HI>White-hall,</HI> in whose Presence a few Points were debated; but little or nothing concluded.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 4. As concerning the Annals of the Order, or the Books wherein the several Resolutions and Decrees oc∣casionally made in Chapters, and wherein other histo∣rical and ceremonial Matters relating to it are recorded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will not be amiss to give some Account of them in this Place.</P>
<P>THE first, in Order of time, is an old Paper Book written in <HI>French,</HI> call'd <HI>Registrum Chartaceum,</HI> hitherto fortunately preserv'd in the Paper Office at <HI>White-hall,</HI> which probably was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gun by <HI>John Coningham;</HI> for we find him, 1414. (a little before the Annals commenced) made Canon of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and Register of the Or∣der, and in regard the same Hand-Writing is carry'd on from the Beginning of the Book down to 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. inclusive, where follows an <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI> till <HI>Anno</HI> 23 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. that the Annals began to be set down with another
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
Hand; and that he shortly after died in 1445. Hence∣forward these Annals are entred with promiscuous Hands, which may be presumed the proper Hand-Writings of the Registers of this Noble Order, as they succeeded each other in the Office.</P>
<P>AFTER we find <HI>Richard Sidnor</HI> mention'd in the Register <HI>Anno</HI> 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. (who subscribed his Name at the foot of every Leaf) the Annals were pen'd in one Hand until <HI>Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. that <HI>Robert A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>drydge,</HI> D. D. and one of the Canons of <HI>Windsor</HI> succeeded him; and then 'tis evident the Writing also was changed to an old set <HI>Roman</HI> Hand, which ran on to the End of 29 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. in which Year he was advanced to the Bishoprick of <HI>Carlisle;</HI> and this Book breaks off in the 31st of his Reign.</P>
<P>BESIDES this there is another Book that goes by the Name of the <HI>Black Book,</HI> wherein the Annals of the Order are transcribed in <HI>Latin,</HI> concerning which there pass'd a Decree, <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. that it should be fairly copy'd out, and afterwards that the Sovereign should be put in Remembrance of it; but neither of these De∣crees was put in execution, nor was this confirm'd till towards the End of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. This Book differs very little from the <HI>Registrum Chartaceum,</HI> for therein is nothing enrolled relating to the Order (except one of the Exemplars of the Founders Statutes, and a Catalogue of the first Twenty-five Knights-Companions) before the 4th Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. the Annals of the Order, until that time, be∣ing entirely lost. It hath the same Hiatus or Intervals from 16 to 23 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. from 7 to 10 of <HI>Edw.</HI> 4. from 4 to 7 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. and from 10 to 14 <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. It also runs parallel therewith for the most part, and that it was compil'd by Dr. <HI>Aldrydge,</HI> whilst he continu'd Register, is collected from some Passages in the Preface of all the Sovereigns, ending with King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The Tran∣scription of this Book was finish'd <HI>Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. for so far is written, as also the Appendix, with one and the same Hand; (in a middle-siz'd Text) but <HI>Anno</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. another Hand appears, which, with some Variation, is continu'd to the End of 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. where this Book breaks off.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="161"/>
THE Register of the Order was oblig'd to provide Two Books, and therein to enter the Ordinances, Statutes, and Acts of this Noble Corporation, one to be lodg'd at the Chapter House at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and call'd, <HI>Index Windesoriensis,</HI> and the other being a Duplicate of the former, to remain in his own Custody, ready to expose to the View of the Sovereign, whensoever he should demand it; this latter was called <HI>Aulae Registrum.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the general Directions for Compiling these Books, and the Particulars they are to consist of, we are inform'd from the said Statutes and Constitutions; for besides the Entry of all the Scrutinies taken in Chapter and Elections made thereupon, it is his Office to record the Penalties inflicted on Knights-Compa∣nions, and the Reconciliation of all Delinquents with other Acts, and their Causes appertaining to the Order, all which are decreed to be recited before the Sove∣reign and Knights-Companions at the Beginning of the Chapter yearly, if Occasion be, to correct and reduce into Method. Moreover he is to record all the Policies in War, Exploits, Transactions, and memorable Atchievements, both of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, according as he can best attain the Know∣ledge of them, by his own diligent Search, or the As∣sistance of Mr. Garter, which having consign'd to Wri∣ting from Year to Year, is to be perused at the next Chapter by the Knights-Companions, for their Appro∣bation and Correction; and being reiterated the second time in the Chapter, he is to see that they be fairly en∣grossed in the said Book, for a perpetual Remem∣brance.</P>
<P>AND because the time perfix'd for Rehearsal of these Particulars in Chapter, had in succeeding Years been imploy'd in other Affairs. In one of those Articles which the Knights-Companions exhibited to King <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the 19th of <HI>May, Anno Jac.</HI> R. 20. and rati∣fied the 22d of <HI>May</HI> following, it was decreed that no∣thing of this Nature, or any other Act in Chapter, should be registred before it had been perus'd and pass'd the Consideration of the then Knights-Companions, or at least Four of them, who when they should set Times apart to consult of the Affairs of this Order (for which
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
they were chiefly commission'd) might then also make Use of such Opportunities as should give this Business Dispatch with more Conveniency. Upon mature Consi∣deration had of those Injunctions, the then Register at a Chapter held 19 <HI>Nov.</HI> 22 <HI>Car.</HI> II. presented the Conti∣nuation of the Annals of this Order, which he had ranged in order to register in the <HI>Liber Carolinus,</HI> and submitted them to the Approbation of the Knights-Companions, whom the Sovereign had commission'd to inspect the Affairs of the Order; which Tender, when they declin'd, he propos'd that it might pass the Exa∣mination of the Prelate; but they not giving the ir As∣sent to it, in regard the Register himself was under the Obligation of an Oath, to deal with the utmost Fi∣delity in his Reports, it was decreed, That the said Annals should be fairly recorded in the Book, without any further Inspection.</P>
<P>BESIDES the abovemention'd Particulars, there were Materials of another Nature, decreed to be collected by the Chancellor of the Order and Garter King of Arms, to be digested first, and after entred by the Re∣gister; for whereas one part of the Chancellor's Duty was to make a Narration every Year in Chapter, at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> of the illustrious Exploits of the Knights-Companions, as well as the Actions that tend to eclipse their Glory; so the Register was to note these, and record them from a perpetual Aera or Memorial of their Honour or Disgrace.</P>
<P>AND it is part of Garter's Duty diligently to enquire after the Valiant, Fortunate, and Renown'd Acts, both of the Sovereign and the rest of the Knights-Compani∣ons, and relate them with all Exactness to the Register, for his Engrossing: But how sparingly these are put in execution, the Annals themselves bear witness. How∣ever, Sir <HI>Edward Walker</HI> Garter-King has drawn up an Account of the shining Actions and Characters of the Knights-Companions, beginning with <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and continuing it down to his Son, which he deliver'd Dr. <HI>Ryves</HI> the Register, for the Use afore∣directed.</P>
<P>AMONG the Articles establish'd at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the last is, That the then Register

<P>For the Safety and Preservation of the <HI>Annals,</HI> the Knights-Commissioners determined the 22d of <HI>May, An. Jac.</HI> I. 20.

<HEAD>CAP. VII. The <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the Order.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE Habit and Ensigns of this most Noble Order are most eminently distinguishable and magnifi∣cent, and consist of these Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> Garter, Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, George, and Collar; for as the <HI>Romans</HI> were very exact and particular in assigning each Degree a peculiar Habit and Vesture, by which the Qua∣lity and Rank of their Citizens might be discernable, the Distinction of Apparel was afterwards taken up by divers other Nations, whence every Military, as well as Eccle∣siastick Order of Knighthood, did appropriate to it self a peculiar Dress, Ensign, or Badge, as a Mark of Distin∣ction one from another, to set off the Lustre and Honour of their several Societies.</P>
<P>The four first, <HI>viz.</HI> the Garter, Mantle, Surcoar, and Hood, were assigned the Knights Companions, by the Founder, and the George and Collar by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and all these together are called the whole Habit or En∣signs of the Order, which we shall treat of succinctly, beginning with the Garter.</P>
<P>The Royal Garter challengeth the Preheminence, for from it this famous Order receiv'd its Denomination: It is the first part of the Habit presented to Foreign Princes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Absent Knights, and that wherewith they, and all other elect Knights, are first adorn'd; and of so great Honour and Grandeur, that by the bare Investiture with this Noble Ensign, the Knights are esteem'd Companions of the greatest Military Order in the World.</P>

the Leg; but there's no doubt but it was wrought with rich Embroidery, and the Motto rais'd with Gold, Pearl, and sundry Sorts of Silk, as may be guess'd from the Garters anciently plac'd on the left side of the Knights-Companions Mantles, and those other little embroider'd Garters, wherewith their Surcoats and Hoods were heretofore embellish'd.</P>
<P>BUT of those wrought in the last Age, we have more particular Satisfaction; for we find the Garter sent to <HI>Emanuel</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy, Anno</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> was set with Letters of Goldsmith's Work, the Buckle and Pendant of the same, and on the Pendant a Ruby, and a Pearl hanging at the End. The Garter made for <HI>Francis</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 6 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was richly wrought with Letters of Gold, set off and garnish'd with Stones, the Buckle and Pendant weighing Three Ounces and an half-quarter, was richly set with Rubies and Dia∣monds. The <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. had a Garter of Purple Velvet embroider'd with Letters of Gold, and deck'd out with Diamonds and Rubies. And the Gar∣ter of <HI>Christian</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> was embroider'd with Gold and Pearls: But that Garter sent to <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> outvied all others conferr'd by former Sovereigns, each Letter of the Motto being compos'd of small Diamonds; and for every Stop, a Diamond within a Range of Diamonds, above and be∣low, on the sides of the Garter, and besides other Dia∣monds on the Buckle, and about the same, to the Num∣ber in all of 411.</P>
<P>THE Garter which King <HI>Charles</HI> I. wore upon his Leg at the Time of his Martyrdom, had the Letters of the Motto compos'd likewise of Diamonds, which amount∣ed to the Number of 412. It came to the Hands of Captain <HI>Preston</HI> (one of the Usurper's Captains) from whom the Trustees, for Sale of the King's Goods, re∣ceiv'd it, and sold it to <HI>Ireton,</HI> sometimes Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> for 205 <HI>l.</HI> But after the Restoration, the King's Attorney-General proceeding upon an Action of <HI>Trover</HI> and <HI>Conversion,</HI> Verdict was given for the King against him for 205 <HI>l.</HI> and 10 <HI>l.</HI> costs of Suits, in <HI>Trinity</HI> Term, 16 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="167"/>
THE Motto of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was set with Dia∣monds upon Blue Velvet, and the Borders wrought with fine Gold Wire; the Diamonds which framed the Letters of the Motto, were Rose Diamonds, much of a Size or Proportion; but those which framed the Stops, Table-Diamonds; the Total which set each Let∣ter, compos'd the Stops, Ilot Holes, and adorn'd the Buckle; the Table was Two Hundred and Fifty; the Hinge of the Buckle was pure Gold, and on it the So∣vereign's Picture to the Breast, curiously cut in Flat∣stitch, crown'd with a Laurel and the military Garb of the first <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors; the Table or Pendant was Gold, and on the back-side thereof engrav'd St. <HI>George</HI> on Horse-back encountring the Dragon.</P>
<P>THIS noble Ensign, the Garter, was at the Erection of the Order appointed to be wore on the left Leg, a little beneath the Knee, which Usage still presides: And the placing it thus, on the Sepulchral Portraictures of Knights-Companions, was an early Custom; for on the Alabaster Monument of Sir <HI>William Fitz-warin,</HI> who was interr'd in the North-side of the Chancel at <HI>Wan∣tage</HI> in <HI>Com. Berks,</HI> 35 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. he lies there with his Surcoat of Arms upon his Breast, and the Representa∣tion of a Garter (but without Motto) carv'd upon his left Leg. In the same Posture lies Sir <HI>Richard Pem∣bridge,</HI> elected a Knight-Companion, <HI>temp. Edw.</HI> III. and is portraicted on his Monument in the South-side of the Cathedral of <HI>Hereford,</HI> below the Pulpit, and en∣compass'd with a Rail of Iron-Spikes.</P>
<P>THE next Monument whereon the Garter was de∣picted, was that erected for Sir <HI>Simon Burley,</HI> (beheaded <HI>A. D.</HI> 1388.) and rear'd in the North-Wall near the Choir of St. <HI>Paul's, London.</HI> Thence-forward the Pra∣ctice became more frequent, and then the Motto began to be cut thereon; insomuch that it is now the con∣stant and just Practice to do it, whensoever the Knights-Companions are exhibited in Effigies.</P>
<P>AND altho' this Ensign was first design'd in Orna∣ment to the left Leg, yet it was not confin'd so solely thereto, but was anciently us'd to incircle the Escut∣cheon of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Arms, worn by the Sovereign and Knights-Companions on their Mantles, who within a
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
small space after us'd it to surround their own proper Coat of Arms, which their Successors have retain'd as their peculiar Privilege, permitting it to none but to their principal Officer, the Prelate of the Order.</P>
<P>THE first Example that occurs, is the before-menti∣on'd of Sir <HI>Francis Burley,</HI> where, on the Front, to∣wards the Head, is his own Arms empaling his first Wife's, set within a Garter, (wanting the Impress;) but another having the same Empalement, (plac'd be∣low the Feet) is surrounded with a Collar of SS. of the same Form with that about his Neck.</P>
<P>THE Monument also of <HI>Joan,</HI> Wife of <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> on the South-side of the Choir, in the Cathedral of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> bears the Arms of <HI>Nevil,</HI> empaling those of <HI>Joan,</HI> his Wife, (who dy'd <HI>A. D.</HI> 1410.) Incircled within a Garter, and fix'd on this Lady's Monument, Daughter to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gount,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> is there such a Collar of SS. placed about a Square; but the Paint being faded, was render'd un∣intelligible.</P>
<P>ANOTHER antique Instance is that Escutcheon, <HI>Sable, Three Ostrich Feathers Argent,</HI> surrounded with the Gar∣ter, affix'd in the Glass-Windows of <HI>Greenwich</HI>-Church in <HI>Kent,</HI> by <HI>Humfrey,</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and supported with a Greyhound and an Antelope. It is reported, these Three Feathers were the Ensign of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. which were conferr'd by <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> his Father, who bore them for his Device, and placed in a <HI>Field Sable,</HI> as here, but the Pens were powder'd with <HI>Ermin,</HI> for a difference from the Black Prince's Feather, which were <HI>Argent,</HI> as the King's Pen was <HI>Or,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI>'s Compony <HI>Argent</HI> and <HI>Azure.</HI></P>
<P>THE Arms of Sir <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wis Robessart,</HI> Lord <HI>Bourchier,</HI> Knight-Companion, <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en.</HI> V. we find encompass'd with a Garter on each side his Monument, in <HI>Westmin∣sier-Abbey.</HI></P>
<P>AT the Interment of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Father to King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. at every Corner of the Majesty-Es∣cutcheon (set over the Image of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sunct) was an Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utcheon of the Arms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gland quart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gels Gold,</HI> holding the same within a Garter.

<HI>Wells,</HI> (who dy'd 14 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII.) were surrounded with the Garter, as others bearing his Lady's Arms.</P>
<P>AT the Interment of <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in <HI>Thet∣ford-Abbey,</HI> (who dy'd 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII.) there was pro∣vided a Shield of his Arms within a Garter, and a Coronet affix'd over it; a Target also of the Arms of <HI>George,</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> within a Garter, was born at his Funural, <HI>Anno</HI> 33 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>IT was the Custom, (begun about the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> VII.) when the Obsequies of any Foreign Prince were celebrated in <HI>England,</HI> to paint an Escutcheon of such Prince's Arms within the Collar of the Order, whereof he was Sovereign or a Fellow-Companion; as those of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. celebrated at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, <HI>London,</HI> had Escutcheons of the Arms of <HI>France,</HI> within the Collar of the Order of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> at each End of the Hearse; and when the Obsequies of <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> were solemniz'd at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, there was, among others, one large Escutcheon of his Arms within the Collar of the <HI>Golden Fleece.</HI> The Fu∣neral Rites of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. being perform'd in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> 22 and 23 <HI>Dec.</HI> 1558. there were Ten great Escutcheons compass'd with Garters, to shew he was a Fellow of this Order: And upon the same Account, where Princes were Sovereigns of one, and Companions of another Order, their Hearses were hung with Escutcheons of their Arms, surrounded with the Collars or principal Badges of both those Orders; as at the Interment of <HI>Francis</HI> I. the <HI>French</HI> King, cele∣brated at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, <HI>London,</HI> 1 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. the Escutcheons were the Arms of <HI>France,</HI> encompass'd within the Gar∣ter of St. <HI>George,</HI> and Collar of St. <HI>Michael.</HI> At the Ob∣sequies of <HI>Hen.</HI> II. of <HI>France, Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s also, there were some Escutcheons of his Arms, incir∣cled both with the Garter and Collar of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> having been a Knight-Companion of both these Orders: Under the Joysts was a Majesty Escutcheon of Black Taffaty of this King's Arms, within a Garter crown'd with an Imperial Crown, and in several Places of the Hearse were fasten'd other Escutcheons of his Arms within this principal Ensign of the Garter.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="170"/>
KING <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. was the first that introduc'd into his Great S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al the Eschutcheon of his Arms incircled with∣in a Garter, as may be seen placed on either side his Portraicture si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting on his Royal Throne; since him, all succeeding Sovereigns have born their Arms after that Manner. not only in their great and Privy-Seals, but in those other appertaining to their Courts of Ju∣stice, and generally in all Matters where their Arms were visible (except Coins); in Imitation of whom, the Knight-Companions have don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the like.</P>
<P>BUT there were <HI>An.</HI> 21 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. certain Half Crowns stamp'd in the West of <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and,</HI> containing the Sove∣reigns Arms, so encompassed, regally crowned and supported; and this was the first Money whereon the Royal Garter appeared. After him King <HI>Charles</HI> II. having an Eye to the Advancement of the Honour of this Order, caused the irradicated Cross of St. <HI>George</HI> en∣compass'd about with the Royal Garter to be publickly stamp'd in the Center of his Silver Coin, struck upon the Recoinage of it, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no</HI> 14. <HI>Car.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>THERE were other Medals heretofore stamp'd upon several Occasions, wherein the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rter was designedly express'd, and enclosing Shields of their Arms; as that in the Year 1619. <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was crowned King of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> and <HI>Robert Cecil</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> created Lord Treasurer, both Knights Compa∣nions of this Noble Order: Moreover, Gold Rings have been cast into the Figures of Garters; the Ground on the outside enamell'd with a deep Blue, through which the golden Letters of the Motto appearing, set them off with an admirable Beauty. And it seems such Rings were in vogue since the Preface to the black Book of the Order makes mention of wearing the Garter on the Leg and Shoulder, and sometimes likewise sub∣o ins the Thumb, <HI>interdum Pollice gestare;</HI> by which we may naturally conjecture, that Gold Rings were formed into the Fashion of Garters, and bestowed by some new installed Knights upon their Relations and Friends to wear in Memorial of so great an Honour conferred up∣on them.</P>
<P>AMONG the Officers belonging to the Order the Pre∣late is permitted to bear h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s proper Arms (impaled with

those of his See) within the Garter, and the rest only to wear the Badges of their Offices, surrounded with the same to express their peculiar Relation.</P>
<P>BESIDES the Manner of bearing Arms, within the Gar∣ter of this Order, the Garter either in whole or part, hath been by Way of Armory, but without the Motto; as in the Seal belonging to the Office of Garter King of Arms, where the Garter (enclosing a Crown) is placed on a Chief, between a <HI>Lyon</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and a <HI>Flower de Lys</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> And to instance in Family, we find Argent Three <HI>Demy-Garters Azure,</HI> buckled and garnished, <HI>Or,</HI> granted by King <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. to his Servant <HI>Peter Nerborne,</HI> and sable a Garter, <HI>Or,</HI> between Three Buckles of the Second, to be born by <HI>Buckland</HI> or <HI>Bowland in Com.

<P>§. 2. THE second Ensign of the Order is the <HI>Mantle,</HI> which is the Chief of those Vestments which the Sove∣reign and Knights-Companions make use of upon all solemn Occasions relating to the Order. That this Pattern was derived to us from the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> is not at all to be disputed, since it so little va∣ries in Fashion from their <HI>Pallium</HI> or <HI>Toga;</HI> for the <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Pallium was a sort of long Cloak, which only wanted a Collar or Cape, and the <HI>Roman Toga</HI> as pro∣per to them, as the <HI>Pallium</HI> to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and the Custom as Antique as <HI>Romulus</HI> himself; for he is recited by <HI>Plutarch</HI> to have worn it. The Pallium is more fully described to be a kind of upper Robe that covered the whole Body, made fast on the right Shoulder with a Fibula or Clasp. It was usually worn over the Tunica or short Coat, whence the Proverb <HI>Tunica Pallio propior,</HI> and is more particularly observed to have been a Gar∣ment fashioned without Sleeves, that reached down to the Ancles.</P>
<P>IN describing this upper Robe, called the <HI>Mantle,</HI> (the Sovereigns being distinguished from the Knights-Companions, only by a long Train) we shall first set down its various Appellations it is mentioned by in the Records of the Order; Secondly, the Materials where∣of it consists; Thirdly, the Colour; Fourthly, the Quantity; and last of all the Ornamental Trimmings, that nothing be omitted to satisfy any curious Enquirer.</P>

<P>IN the Founder's Statutes it is called <HI>Mantellum,</HI> and in <HI>Hen.</HI> V. <HI>Manteau,</HI> both which we render <HI>Mantle.</HI> But the Exemplar of the Founder's Statutes entred in the black Book, and the Statutes of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. call it <HI>Trabea,</HI> which <HI>Rosinus</HI> reckons among the different Kinds of <HI>Mantles</HI> or <HI>Gow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> And in 20 <HI>Art.</HI> of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth's Statutes, it is applied both to the <HI>Mantle</HI> and <HI>Surcoat;</HI> sometime it is stiled <HI>Chlamyda;</HI> sometime <HI>Stola;</HI> but in other Places more pertinently, <HI>Pallium</HI> and <HI>Toga.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MATERIALS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Mantle prepared for the Founder against the first Feast of this Order, appears to be fine Woollen Cloth, and it is not improbable this Material was chosen, rather than any other richer, to the Intent the Founder might give the Preference to our native Commodity, altho' there's permitted in the Statutes of Institution a permis∣sion for the Proxies of Foreign Princes to bring over with them Mantle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Silk and Velvet when they came to receive possession of their Principal Stalls, either be∣cause other Countries were better stored with such Commodities than our <HI>English</HI> Cloth, or that it might be more agreeable to represent the State and Grandeur of Foreign Princes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as accounting Silk or Velvet the nobler Representation.</P>
<P>WHAT Duration the wearing Cloth had, is not di∣rectly set down, but the first time we discover their Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les to be of Velvet, is about the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> VI. which Sort of Silk hath thence remained until this Day. About this Period, 'tis ob∣served, that the Mantles of Foreign Princes were made here of Velvet, for so was that tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsmitted to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> elected <HI>Anno</HI> 1346. Concerning the Man∣tles of the Knights-Companions, there is no doubt but they were of the same Materials with those made for the Sovereign, <HI>viz.</HI> at first of fine Woollen Cloth, and when the Sovereign exchanged it for Velvet, they followed his Example; but we cannot meet with equal Satisfaction in this Point, because the Knights-Compa∣nions provided this Robe at their own Expence; and
<PB N="160" REF="173"/>
their private Accounts herein passing thro' so many Con∣tingences, were of no great Durability. But their Surcoats were of the Sovereigns Donation, and conse∣quently the Particulars of them remain on Record in the Rolls and Accounts of the great Wardrobe.</P>
<P>THE Colour of these Mantles is appointed by the Statutes to be Blue, and of this Colour was the Found∣ers; by which, as by the Ground-work of the Royal Garter, it is not improbable he alluded to the Colour of the Field in the <HI>French</HI> Arms, which a few Years be∣fore he began to Quarter with those of <HI>England.</HI> But the Colour of the Surcoat was changed every Year, as will appear by and by. Of the same Colour were the Velvet Mantles, made <HI>temp. Hen.</HI> VI. who tho' he al∣tered the Stuff, did not vary the Dye. It is apparent, that the blue Colour was retained to King <HI>Edw.</HI> IVth's Reign, for when this Sovereign transmitted the Habit and Ensigns of the Order to <HI>Julian de Medicis,</HI> the Mantle was of blue Velvet.</P>
<P>BUT in King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth's Statutes there's no menti∣on at all of the Colour of this upper Robe, save only of the <HI>Mantle,</HI> which the Proxy of a Foreign Prince was enjoined to bring with him when he came to assume the Stall of his Principal; which, tho' it does not come di∣rectly up to the Poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet it is to be observed to be of blue Velvet. And it's highly probab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that the blue Colour remained still to be used; for within a few Months after the compiling the said Statut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, it's plain, the Mantle sent to <HI>James</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was of blue Velvet, and in the ancient Form of Admoniti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and Signification ap∣pointed to be spoke at the Investiture of Foreign Princes, and then in Plea it is called <HI>the Mantle of celest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur.</HI> Likewise the Mantle sent to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> was of the same Composur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>IN Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, upon what Ground History is silent, the Colour of Foreign Prince's Mantles was changed from Blue to Purple, for of that Colour were the Mantles sent to the <HI>French</HI> Kings, <HI>Charles</HI> IX. <HI>Anno.</HI> 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and <HI>Hen.</HI> III. <HI>Ann.</HI> 27 <HI>Eliz.</HI> So also to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> 9 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to <HI>Fredrick</HI> II.

<PB N="161" REF="174"/>
King of <HI>Denmark, An. J. R.</HI> IV. But that sent to <HI>Fre∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruk</HI> Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> in the same Year, was a mix'd Co our of Purple and Violet.</P>
<P>THUS the Purple Colour came in Request, and con∣tinued till about the 12 of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. when he deter∣mining to restore the Colour of the Mantle to the pri∣mitive In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>titution, gave Directions to Mr. <HI>Peter Richaut,</HI> Merchant, to provide himself with a Quantity of rich blue Velvets from <HI>Genoa;</HI> and upon their arrival into <HI>England,</HI> signify'd his Pleasure by Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> the Chancellor, That all Knights-Companions should pur∣chase as much of the said Velvet as would furnish them with new Robes against St. <HI>George</HI>'s-Day next ensu∣ing; compliance to whose Will, all the Knights paid Obedience, at the Rate of Thirty seven Shillings a Yard, being the Price the Sovereign paid to Mr. <HI>Richaut</HI> for the Velvet of his own Robes. And the first Essay of these Mantles was to honour the Installation of the Prince, afterwards King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>AND because there were many Knights-elect to be in∣stalled after the Restoration, it was ordained at the Chapter held at <HI>Whitehall</HI> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>14<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Jan. Anno</HI> 12. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> 2. (called to consider of the Preparations of the grand Feast then at hand), That Directions should be given to the Master of the Wardrobe to negotiate Abroad for excellent Velvets of Skie Colour, and Crim∣son, and other Materials agreeable for the Mantles and Surcoats, both of the old Knights-Companions, and those that were then to be installed; which was accordingly effected, and they were transmitted in time to accom∣mod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te them at the said Feast.</P>
<P>THO' the just Number of Ells of Cloth for the Sove∣reigns Mantle at the first Institution are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et down, yet in the Total for his Mantle, Hood, and Surcoat, there was allowed ten Ells of long Cloth. The Mantle of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. took up one Piece, five Ells and three Quarters of blue Velvet; and those sent to <HI>Frede∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck</HI> II. and <HI>Christian</HI> IV. Kings of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> III. contained each twenty Yards of Velvet.</P>
<P>THIS we find to be the Allowance for Foreign Princes, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the more full and extensive, by reason of their
<PB N="162" REF="175"/>
long Train, which being more scanty in the Mantles of Knights-Subjects, eig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teen Yards was sufficient to make one of them. The full Length of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. from the Collar behind to the end of the Train, was three Yards the Length of the foreside, one Yard and three Quarters from the Foot along the bottom to the fixing on of the Train, was two Yards, and from thence the Length or Compass of the Train, two Yards.</P>
<P>THE left Shoulder of each of these Mantles have from the Institution been adorned with a large fair Garter, containing this Motto, <HI>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</HI> These were distinguished from the lesser Garters, an∣ciently embroider'd upon the Surcoats and Hoods of the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, by the Name of <HI>Garters Gross.</HI></P>
<P>WITHIN this Garter was the Arms of St. <HI>George, viz.</HI> Argent a <HI>Cross Gules,</HI> and was heretofore wrought in Sat∣tin, with Gold, Silver and Silk; but in descending Times greater Expence and Magnificence became the Practice of the Order, for it was embordered upon Velvet with Damask, Gold, and sundry Sorts of Purls, Plates, <HI>Venice</HI> Twists and Silks, and the Letters of the Motto and Borders of the Garter composed of fair Oriental Pearl. The Garter fix'd upon the Mantle of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was encircled with large Oriental Pearl, so were the Letters of the Motto and the Cross within the Garter, the Diameter of which was seven Inches, but the Depth from the upper Part to the end of the Pendant, ten Inches.</P>
<P><HI>Temp. Hen.</HI> VI. it seems to have been the Mode to embellish the Mantle with three or four Velts drawn down the sides, and round the bottom, as it appears by the Monument of <HI>John Tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Earl</HI> of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> in the South-wall of the Chancel of <HI>Whitechurch in Com. Salop.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT that Time the Lining of this Robe was white Damask, and afterwards white Sattin; but of later Date it was lined with white Taffaty, which continues yet in vogue.</P>
<P>FOR exemplary Ornament, the Mantle had fixed to its Collar a pair of long Strings, anciently woven of blue Silk only (called <HI>Cordons,</HI> Robe-strings or Laces); but
<PB N="163" REF="176"/>
of later Days, twisted round and made of <HI>Venice</HI> Gold and Silk of the Colour of the Robe, at each end of which hung a great Knob or Button, wrought over and raised with a rich Caul of Gold, and Tassels there∣unto of like Silk and Gold.</P>
<P>AND at the Collar was usually fixed an Hook and Eye of Gold for its firmer affixing of it to the Shoulders.</P>

<P>§. 3. The Third Ensign of the Order is the <HI>Surcoat</HI> or <HI>Kirtle,</HI> which altho' we find no Place for it in the Founder's Statutes, is nevertheless as ancient as the Man∣tle or upper Robe, that is only taken Notice of there, for such a Vesture King <HI>Edward</HI> III. then made, to∣gether with his Mantle and a Hood to celebrate the first Feast of the Order in.</P>
<P>ITS Original it owes to the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> a∣mongst whom this Garment had its determinated <HI>Tu∣nica,</HI> and was worn next under the <HI>Toga,</HI> but amongst them was both narrower and shorter; it was girt close to the Body with a Girdle, and so fitted, that the Hem of it reached a little below the Knee, or to the middle of the Ham. It was the proper Mode of the <HI>Roman</HI> Citi∣zens, and by its trimming were the three Degrees among them known; for the Senators Tunicks were embroi∣dered or purfled over with broad purple Studs, the Knights with narrow ones, and the Plebeians plain.</P>
<P>IN setting forth the Surcoat, which was heretofore annually bestowed by the Sovereign or the Knights-Companions, and therefore called his <HI>Livery,</HI> we shall, as in the Description of the Mantle, treat somewhat of the Name, Materials, Colour, Quantity and Garnish∣ing of it.</P>
<P>AS to the Name in the old Rolls of the great Ward∣robe, it is stiled <HI>Roba,</HI> but more properly as the Founder's first Surcoat is called <HI>Tunica,</HI> which Name it bears in the red Book of the Order.

But since, and very lately, it hath been bestowed also on the Surcoats of Knights-Companions; and that of <HI>Kirtle</HI> sometimes given to those sent to Foreign
<PB N="164" REF="177"/>
Princes, as appears by the Books of Warrants in the great Wardrobe, but the rest are Terms of a later Date: As the first Mantles, so the first Surcoats were composed of Woollen Cloth, and tho' the Cloth of the Mantles was in some space after changed for Velvet, yet the Surcoats continued afterwards to be of Cloth, at least till after the Office of Chancellor of the Garter was erected by King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. as is manifest by the Precedent of this Livery in the Sovereigns great Ward∣robe; but in process of Time they became Velvet, which sort of Silk is yet retained.</P>
<P>THE Colour of this Vesture was anciently changed every Year, commonly into Blue, Scarlet, Sanguine in Grain, or White. But the Colour of the Mantles re∣mained the same as at the Institution, until Queen <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣zabeth</HI>'s Reign, and then it commenced Blue: And 'tis remarkable, that the Surcoats of the Knights-Compani∣ons, were always of the same Colour with the Sove∣reigns.</P>
<P>THE Founder's first Surcoat was of the same Cloth and Colour with the Mantle, <HI>viz.</HI> Blue, but in the 34th Year of his Reign he altered it to Black, and of the same Colour were those he conferred that Year upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se following Knights-Companions, <HI>viz.</HI> the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack Prince, the Earls of <HI>Ulster, Richmond</HI> and <HI>Sali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury, Edmund</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angly,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard la Vacle,</HI> Sir <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh Wrot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly,</HI> Sir <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> Sir <HI>Bartholomew Burghest,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> Sir <HI>Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Manney,</HI> Sir <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Loring,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Pavel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> Sir <HI>William Fitz Warin,</HI> Sir <HI>Miles Stapleton,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Stafford, Warwick</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Ughtred:</HI> The Motive that induced him to pitch upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Colour, was conceived to be a kind of Humiliation, because the Pestilence began again to spread its Male∣volence, which had furiously raged Eleven Years be∣fore. The Surcoats which the Sovereign gave the Dukes of <HI>Lancasier</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Fourteen other Knights, <HI>Anno</HI> 37. <HI>Edward</HI> III. were of Cloth, Sanguine in Grain.

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Richard</HI> II. there were ordered against St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast Twenty three Surcoats of white Cloth for the Sovereign, and Twenty two Knights-Companions; and the 12 and 19 Year of the same King, the Sove∣reign bestowed on the same Persons Surcoats of long blue Cloth, after the Original Model. The Twenty two Surcoats made up for the Feast of St. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orge, Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> V. were of white Cloth; <HI>Anno</HI>—<HI>Henry</HI> VI. the Sovereigns Gown or Surcoat was of Scarlet, as was that sent to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> in the 13th Year of the same King. <HI>Anno</HI>—<HI>Henry</HI> VI. the Sovereign had white Cloth; and so were the Surcoats given to Twenty Knights-Companions more in the—Year of his Reign. Afterwards the beforementioned Four Colours began to be disused, for the Surcoat presented to <HI>Julian de Medi∣cis, temp. Edward</HI> IV. was purple Velvet, and towards the latter end of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and since, it is upon Record, the Surcoats of the Sovereign and all the Knights-Companions were Crimson Velvet, nor did the Colour suffer a Mutation in the Surcoat, tho' King <HI>Charles</HI> I. restored the Mantle to its first pri∣mitive Colour, <HI>Anno</HI> 12 <HI>Regni sui.</HI></P>
<P>THERE has been some disproportion in the Quan∣tity of the Cloth allowed in the Provision against one and the same Feast, for <HI>Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Edward</HI> III. the Earls of <HI>Stafford, Warwick</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> as also Sir <HI>Thomas Ughtred</HI> had then for each of their Surcoats fix Ells of Cloth (perhaps the tallness of their Stature required it) when the other Fifteen Knights were allowed but five Ells, being the same Quantity the Sovereign's Surcoat had contained in it at the same time.</P>
<P>THE Dukes of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Clarence, Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> V. with the Earls of <HI>Arundel,</HI> were allowed Eight Ells a∣piece, the Dukes of <HI>Bedford, Gloucester</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Westmorland</HI> and <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Lords <HI>Grey,</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="179"/>
<HI>Fitz Hugh</HI> and <HI>Roos,</HI> six Ells apiece; the Earls of <HI>Dorset<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> with six Barons and five Knights Batchelors, but five Ells apiece. Afterwards, when the Number of Ells of Cloth, Garters and Furrs came to be ascertained for each Degree, all the Knights-Companions (even the Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of <HI>Wales)</HI> were not to exceed five Ells: But since Vel∣vet came in Plea, the Allowance for Surcoat and Hood hath been eighteen Yards, when the Surcoat reached down to the Feet; but now it being the Fashion to wear if shorter, the Allowance is stinted to Ten. The Length of King <HI>Charles</HI> II's Surcoat was one Yard and an half, and of the Sleeve one Yard wanting a Nail.</P>
<P>THE Ornamental Trimmings of these Garments are next worthy of Note, especially at the Time of Insti∣tuting this Order, for they were then, and a long time after, powdered all over with little Garters, embroi∣dered with Silk and Gold-Plate, in each of which was neatly wrought the Motto, <HI>Honi soit,</HI> &amp;c. Besides, the Buckles and Pendants to those small Garters, were Silver gilt; of these Garters there were no less than 160 upon the first Surcoat and Hood made for the Founder.</P>
<P>IN King <HI>Richard</HI> II's Reign, the little Garters that a∣dorned the Surcoats of the Sovereign, and the other Knights were wrought in Embroidery upon blue Taffa∣ty with Cyprus, and Soldat Gold and Silk of divers Colours, and the Letters Gold. And as the Sovereign was not limited in the Proportion of Cloth or Velvet for his Surcoat, no more was he confined to the Num∣ber of Garters, wherewith to adorn it; nor do I find that any of the Knights-Companions were, until the Precedent of the Livery of the Garter was settled, for <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> V. the Dukes of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Claren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI> had each of their Surcoats adorned with 120 Garters, but the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and the rest wore but 100. The Settlement in the Precedent of the Livery was, in re∣lation to Degrees of Honour, a greater or less Number of Garters: Thus,</P>

<P>ABOUT the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. the Sovereigns Number of Garters did not much exceed those which the Founder allow'd to himself at the Institution; for the Surcoat and Hood of the said King consisted of 173; and the King of <HI>Portugal, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. 120 Garters. But this Drapery of their Robes became at length quite obsolete, perhaps when Cloth was altered to Velvet, and the plain Surcoat hath to this Day continued in Use.</P>
<P>WHILE these Surcoats remained of Cloth, they were lined with Bellies of pure Minever Fur, only the Sovereigns was purfled with Ermin; and of these, it seems, a like Proportion was at first stated to all the Knights-Companions, <HI>viz.</HI> 200 Bellies. Yet in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> II. some Difference began in the Allowance to the Knights-Companions, for a Baron, and all Degrees upward had 200 Bellies; but under a Ba∣ron 120 only. However, <HI>Anno</HI> 1. <HI>Henry</HI> V. the Barons were tantamount to the Knights-Batchelors, for all De∣grees above a Baron were allow'd, a Fur of 200 Bellies. But the Barons and Knights-Batchelors Furs were on∣ly 120 Bellies.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS, by the Precedent of the Garter, there was another Proportion limited, the Prince, a Duke, a Marquis, an Earl, had each of them Five Timber of pure Minever allowed to a Surcoat; but the Viscount, Baron, Baronet and Batchelor-Knights but Three Timber apiece. In time these Furs were disused, and the Surcoats came to be lined with white Sarcenet, to which, <HI>temp. Eliz.</HI> white Taffaty succ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded, and that still continues.</P>
<P>WHAT became of the old Surcoats, since the Knights-Companions had new ones every Year, the Black Book of the Order informs us, That on the Eve of the Feast
<PB N="168" REF="181"/>
of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Knights wore to Vespers, the Sove∣reigns Livery or Surcoats, used by them the preceding Year, which after that Night they threw off, (for the new Surcoats were worn on the Feast-Day); but the Ensigns and Ornaments of this Kind were disposed of to the Use of the Colledge.</P>
<P>THE Hood and Cap comes in the next Place to be spoken of, which Hood in King, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statu∣tes, and the Black Book of the Order is called <HI>Hu∣merale;</HI> but in the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, <HI>Capu∣cium.</HI> In the <HI>French</HI> it is <HI>Chaperon,</HI> a Word used in the Statute, <HI>Anno</HI> 1. <HI>Richard</HI> II. <HI>C.</HI> 7. and also retained in the Old <HI>English</HI> Copy of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes made of his Reign, and annexed to this Treatise. They were anciently wore for Defence of the Head against the In∣clemencies of Weather, but of later Times Caps and Hats have supplied their place. How they sat upon the Head, may be observed in the Portraitures of the first Founders; as also with some Variety of Fashion in suc∣ceeding Ages: Yet is not the Hood quite thrown by, since 'tis still kept reclining upon the Back, almost like a Pilgrim's Hat.</P>
<P>THIS Hood was ordained, and is yet retained as part of the Habit of this most Noble Order. And tho' neither it nor the Surcoat is mentioned in the Statutes of Institution, or in either its Exemplars, nor doth King <HI>Henry</HI> V. lay any Stress upon it, yet it is of equal Antiquity with the rest, as appears from the Rolls of the great Wardrobe, and <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes have made re∣markable Observation of it, for the Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, and Collar are called the Habit of the Order: And in the Black Book, <HI>Anno</HI> 22. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. at the Investiture of <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> the Mantle, Kirtle, Hood and Collar are expresly called <HI>Whole Habit.</HI></P>
<P>IT was heretofore, and now is generally made of the same Materials as the Surcoat, and was anciently trim∣med and set off with a small Proportion of Garters lined with Cloth of a different Colour, and such as would best strike the Sight; but now with Taffaty, as is the Lining of the Surcoat.</P>
<P>AS to the Cap, which was instituted to succeed the Hood; it hath been, and yet is, fashioned of black
<PB N="169" REF="182"/>
Velvet lin'd with Taffaty; but the Figure hath several Times varied; for <HI>Temp. Henry</HI> VIII. it was flat, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign it was a little raised in the Head; but in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time they were much more high-crown'd. This Cap hath been usually adorn'd with Plumes of White Feathers, and Spriggs, and bound a∣bout with a Band set thick with Diamonds; so was the Cap for the Installation of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and sometimes the Brims have been tack'd up with a large and costly Jewel.</P>
<P>THIS Custom of wearing Caps and Feathers at the Grand Solemnities of the Order, had, for some Time, about the Beginning of King <HI>James</HI> I. Reign, been omitted, and thereupon, in a Chapter held the 13th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 10. <HI>Jac.</HI> I. this commendable Custom was re-establish'd.</P>
<P>To these may be added the Cross of the Order en∣compass'd with a Garter, which by the Sovereign was ordain'd the 27th of <HI>April,</HI> 2 <HI>Car.</HI> I. to be worn upon the Left Side of the Cloaks, Coats, and riding Cassocks of the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, of the Prelate and Chancellor at all Times, when they were not adorn'd with their Robes, and in all Places and Assemblies (but not embellish'd with Pearls and Stones) that the wearing thereof might be a sufficient Indication to the World, of that Height of Honour they arriv'd to from the said most Noble Order, instituted for Persons of the greatest Merit and Worth.</P>
<P>AND it was not long after e'er the Glory or Star, as it was usually call'd, having certain Beams of Silver, that shot out in Form of a Cross, was introduc'd and annex'd to it, in Imitation (as thought) of the <HI>French,</HI> who after the same manner wore the chief Ensign of the Order of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> being the Representation of a Dove irradiated with such like Beams.</P>
<P>AND whereas some Painters affirm the Symbol of the Holy Ghost to be thus adorn'd congruous enough, yet censure it improper for a Garter, let them consider that King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. erected his White Rose with the like Glory, whereof both the Stone Work and Wood Work of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel in <HI>Windsor,</HI> manifestly illustrate, whose Antiquity makes a Precedent for it long before
<PB N="170" REF="183"/>
the Institution of the Order of the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> but this King assum'd this Device upon appearance of three Suns, which suddenly united together into one immediately, before his successful Victory at <HI>Mortimer</HI>'s-<HI>Cross,</HI> a happy <HI>Aera</HI> he thought himself oblig'd to perpetuate. And they mistake who suppose it to be the Garter that is thus irradiated, whereas it is something else more worthy of the Glory, for from it, not the Garter, do the Rays diffuse, <HI>viz.</HI> the inclos'd Cross of the Order, cele∣brated as glorious, since it darted its bright Beams from Heaven, when it appear'd to <HI>Constantine the Great;</HI> as the same is represented on a Silver Medal: On the one Side whereof was a <HI>Bust in profile,</HI> or side Face of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and on the Reverse, this Badge of the Order, within a Garter, inscrib'd, <HI>Honi,</HI> &amp;c. a Cross irradiated, dispersing its Beams in a Rhombular Form of Eight Angles, beyond the Orbit or bounding Lines of the said Garter, having for Circumscription, <HI>Prisci decus Ordmis Auctum,</HI> 1629.</P>

<P>§ 5. HAVING finish'd our Discourse concerning the Robes of the Order, we shall speak of the robes and Hoods assign'd to the Queen, Knights-Companions Wives, and other great Ladies, by the Donation of the Sovereigns, set off and embellished with Minute Gar∣ters, and lin'd with Rich Furs, which Robes they were adorn'd with during the Solemnity of the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> a Custom almost as ancient as its Institution. The first Mention we find recorded of the Feminine Habit occurs, <HI>Anno</HI> 7. <HI>R.</HI> II. when the Queen, the Sovereign's Mother, the Dutchess of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the Countesses of <HI>Cambridge, Buckingham, Pembroke, Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the Ladies <HI>Philippa</HI> and <HI>Catherine,</HI> Daughters to the Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Mohun</HI> had such kind of Robes and Hoods provided for them. They were made of Cloth, Violet in Grain, like as the Sovereign and Knights-Companions that Year, the Robes lin'd with Fur, but the Hoods with Scarlet, and both embroidered over with little Garters, and the Proportion of Cloth, Furs, and Garters, were stated according to their several Ranks and Degrees; for the Queen had Eight Ells, and Half an Ell of
<PB N="171" REF="184"/>
Scarlet for the Lining of her Hood. The Sovereign's Mother had allow'd her one whole Piece, and a double Proportion of Scarlet; but from the large Quantity it is conceiv'd she had Two Robes and Hoods made at this time: Besides, the particular Number are but Eleven Persons, and cannot else reach the Total of the Robes that were made up and expresly set down to be Twelve. The Dutchess of <HI>Lancaster</HI> had the Allowance of Half a Piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet; the Countess of <HI>Cambridge</HI> Seven Ells of Cloth and Half an Ell of Scarlet, and the rest of the Ladies the same Proportion of Cloth with the Knights-Companions, <HI>i. e.</HI> each Five Ells a-piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet. According to their Cloth was also their Proportion of Minever; the Queen's Allowance was Two Furs, each containing Three Hundred Bellies of pure Minever; the Sove∣reign's Mother had twice that Proportion, the Dutchess of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and Countess of <HI>Cambridge</HI> had the same Allowance as the Queen; but all the rest of the Ladies had only one Fur of Two Hundred Bellies. Besides the embroidered Garters to deck out the Twenty-four Surcoats of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, and the Twelve Robes for the Queen, and other Ladies, amounted to the Number of 2900.</P>
<P>AGAINST the Feast of St. <HI>George, Anno.</HI> II. <HI>R.</HI> II. there were prepared Fifteen Robes and Hoods for the Queen and other Ladies, of the same Livery and suit with the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, <HI>viz.</HI> White long Cloth, and Blue Cloth for the Lining of their Hoods, bearing the same Proportion in all Things as the former, <HI>Anno</HI> 13. <HI>Rich.</HI> II. the Ladies Robes and Hoods were Sanguine Cloth, and the Lining of their Hoods Cloth in Grain. And in the 19th <HI>Rich.</HI> II. they were Blue Cloth, and long Cloth in Grain for Lining their Hoods. In both these Years we find the Dutchess of <HI>Aquitaine</HI> had double the Proportion of Cloth allow'd her (as had also the Dutchess of <HI>York) viz.</HI> Fourteen Ells, (the Queen having then but the former Allowance of Eight Ells) and yet her Proportion of Lining, both for the Robe and Hood, was no more than allow'd the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="185"/>
BUT <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> V. the same Quantities of Cloth, Minevers, and Garters, were the same to Ladies of all Degrees, and that was to each Five Ells of White Woollen Cloth, only the Queen-Mother had Eight Ells of White Cloth and Eight Ells of Black Cloth, a Fee containing Two Hundred Bellies of Minever, and an Hundred embroidered Garters, and 12 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. the Master of the great Wardrobe was commanded to make ready the like Livery, both for Colour of Cloth, number of Ells, Bellies of Minever, and Garters, for the Countess of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> against the approaching Feast of St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>A plainer Narrative is made of these Liveries, <HI>Anno</HI> 16 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. when at the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windesor,</HI> the Queen, the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the King's Daughter, and Dutchess of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> the King's Sister, had for their Livery Murrey Gowns embroidered with Garters.</P>
<P>BESIDES these Robes worn by the Ladies at the Fe∣stivals of the Order, there seems to be some Imitation of wearing a Garter also on their Left Arms, as the Knights did on their Left Leg, as it is observ'd on the Countess of <HI>Tankervile</HI>'s Monument, where she is so pourtray'd.</P>
<P>AFTER a long Disuse of these Robes, <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. there was an endeavour to restore it; for the Deputy Chancellor sollicited the Sovereign in Chapter, That the Ladies of the Knights-Companions might be granted the Privilege to wear a Garter of the Order a∣bout their Arms, and an upper Robe at Festival Times, according to ancient Usage, upon which Motion the Sovereign gave Order that the Queen's Pleasure should be known herein, and the Affair left to the Ladies particular Request, and the Year ensuing, upon the Deputy Chancellor's Report at another Chapter at <HI>Windesor,</HI> it was then left to a Chapter to be called by the Knights-Companions, to preponderate of every Circumstance, how it were fittest to be effected for the Honour and Lustre of the Order; which was ap∣pointed to be held at <HI>London</HI> about <HI>All-hollantide</HI> next; But the unhappy War breaking out, this Matter en∣tirely broke off.</P>

<P>§ 6. THERE remains now the Collar and <HI>George,</HI> brought in by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. And first, of Collars in general, which is an Ornament not of late, but ancient Invention, and the wonderful Consent of most Nations plead for it: Sacred Writ sets down the Collar of Gold for one of the Ornaments <HI>Pharaoh</HI> conferr'd upon <HI>Joseph.</HI> The Images of <HI>Isis</HI> and <HI>Osiris</HI> were represented with such like Collars, in a manner, extending to their Shoulders, as <HI>Kircher</HI> informs us. Their Workmanship seems won∣derfully curious, being intersected with various Lines, and divided with Tablets and precious Stones. The Collar was of an illustrious Original among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and gave Denomination to the Family of <HI>Torquati,</HI> de∣scended from <HI>L. Manlius,</HI> whom the Soldiers surnam'd <HI>Torquatus,</HI> because he fought with a Champion of the <HI>Gauls, Anno V. C.</HI> 392. and, having foil'd him in fight, cut off his Head, and then pluck'd off his Collar, bloody as it was, and put it about his own Neck. In further Memory of which Action were found several <HI>Roman</HI> Coins referring to <HI>L. Torquatus,</HI> Consul with <HI>L. Cotta, Anno V. C.</HI> 688. And it's remarkable that when one of another Tribe was adopted into this Fa∣mily, he did also assume this Badge of Honour, as in the Coin of <HI>D. Junius Silanus,</HI> tho' the Fashion of the Work some what differ'd from the former.</P>
<P>IN pristine Times none but Kings and Princes wore Collars, and therefore their Use seems of Dignity and Power, as is evident from <HI>Daniel,</HI> where the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Kings used this Ornament. Afterwards Men famous for Wisdom and Council, had them as a distinguishing Badge, as in the Example of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and from the Pro∣clamation of <HI>Belshazzar</HI> King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who proposed it as a Praemium to him that could interpret the Hand-Writing upon the Wall. And Men famous for Milita∣ry Atchievements had it conferr'd upon them, in Re∣compence of their Merits; thus Collars were of the Number of the <HI>Dona &amp; Praemia Militaria</HI> among the the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the Honour of receiving them thought wor∣thy to be consign'd to Posterity in Marble Inscriptions. From them the later Emperors receiv'd it, and we read of investing a Knight of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre</HI> with a
<PB N="174" REF="187"/>
Collar at his Creation; where, as soon as the Ceremony of his Ordination is over, the Padre Guardian Kisses the new Made Knight, and puts about his Neck (according to the mode of the Ancients) a Golden Collar, with a Cross hanging at it.</P>
<P>MOST aptly therefore have the Sovereigns of Military Orders annex'd this Ornament of the Collar to their Habit, and conferr'd it on the Fellows and Companions, many of whom have meritoriously deserv'd it for their great Wisdom and valorous Exploits, and for this rea∣son it was instituted in additional Glory to the Ensigns of the Garter, compos'd in a peculiar manner, in Rela∣tion to the Name and Title; to the wearing of which the Sovereign oblig'd both himself and Knights-Com∣panions, and his and their Successors.</P>
<P>THIS Collar was ordain'd to be of Gold Thirty Ounces Troy weight, but not to exceed it; howbeit that Collar sent to <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> weigh'd Thirty-four Ounces and a Quarter, and that of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. 35 Ounces and an Half; which, after his Sufferings, fell into the Hands of <HI>Thomas Harrison,</HI> one of <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Major-Generals, and was by him deli∣vered to the Trustees for Sale of the King's Goods: They, 1649. sent it to the <HI>Mint,</HI> with divers of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> to set the Stamp on work for the first Gold that the upstart Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on-wealth coin'd.</P>
<P>IT was appointed by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, that this Collar should be compos'd of Pieces of Gold in Fashion of Garters, the Ground enamelled Blue, and the Letters of the Motto Gold; in the midst of each Garter, Two Roses plac'd, the innermost enamei∣led Red, and the outermost White, contrarily in the next Garter, the innermost Rose enamelled White, and the outermost Red, and so alternately; but of lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Times these Roses are wholly Red.</P>
<P>THE Number of these Garters are so many as be the ordain'd Number of the Sovereign and Knights-Com∣panions; at the Institution they were Twenty-six, be∣ing fasten'd together with as many Knots of Gold, and this Mode hitherto has continu'd invariable; nor ought the Collar to be adorn'd or enrich'd with pre∣cious Stones, (as the <HI>George</HI> may be) such being prohi∣bited by the Law of the Order.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="188"/>
AT the Middle of the Collar before pendant, at the Table of one of the Garters in the Collar is to be fix'd the Image of St. <HI>George</HI> arm'd sitting on Horseback, who having thrown the Dragon on his Back encounters him with a Tilting-Spear. This Jewel is not encompass'd with a Garter or Row of Diamonds, as in the lesser <HI>George;</HI> but in round Relief. It is allow'd to be beauti∣fied and sett off with Diamonds and other Enrichments, at the Pleasure of the Knight-Companion who possessed it, and upon that Score it hath been frequently adorn'd with Variety of costly Work, whereon the Diamonds, and other precious Stones, being set to that Advantage as might, upon its Motion and Agitation, dart forth a resplendent Lustre.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Establishment of this Article by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. it appears that the Knights-Companions were invested with Collars at their Installations, for the Black Book makes mention of a Collar among the Ensigns of the Garter, wherewith <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Castile</HI> was invested, <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. but whether a Collar of SS's, or of another Model, is not specifi'd: Neverthe∣less this Scruple is in part clear'd up by an old Memo∣rial of the Ceremonies, at the Creating <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> Earl of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. where it is said in the Annals, that after he was invested with the Robes of his State and Dignity, the Collar of the Garter was put about his Neck at constituting him a Knight of the Order. And to make it more conspicuous in a Vellum Book of the Statutes sent to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor, sign'd 1508. by the Register <HI>T. Rowthale,</HI> and in another of <HI>Edward Stanley</HI> Lord <HI>Monteagle,</HI> elected <HI>ann.</HI> 6. <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. the Forty First Article, enjoins a Collar to be worn by each Knight-Companion expresly called the Collar of the Order, which tho' it be not in all Respects consentient to that prescribed by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Sta∣tutes, yet there is not much Variation, and 'tis reported to be a <HI>Gold Collar coupled together by several Pieces of Links, in Fashion of Garters, with a Vermilion Rose, and the Image of St.</HI> George <HI>hung thereat.</HI> The Reason of the Knights-Companions wearing it at the Times appointed, the License for putting it to mending, the Command not
<PB N="176" REF="189"/>
to enrich the Collar, but the <HI>George</HI> only; and under a Penalty not to sell, pawn or alienate it upon any Necessity whatsoever, are wholly the same as was afterwards en∣joyn'd by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. So that he did but only annex to his Body of Statutes a Decree, which for the greatest part had been put in practise before. In the 11th <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. upon Interpretation of the Eleventh Article of the Statutes, the Collar is there enumerated as part of the entire Robes that a Knight-Companion is oblig'd to wear, for a more convincing Proof, That the Collar of Garters was used before King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Reign, the Monument of Sir <HI>Giles Daubeny</HI> plainly De∣lineates (who departed 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII.) in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> where his Portraicture in the Robes of the Or∣der is adorned with such a Collar as King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes do afterwards describe.</P>
<P>AS the Garter sent to <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Swed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> so the great <HI>George</HI> (pendant at his Collar weighing Seven Ounces) was set with large and resplendent Dia∣monds, to the Number of Eighty-Four.</P>
<P>IN what Regard this Noble Ensign of Honour the Colla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, hath been with the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, not only of the Order of the <HI>Garter,</HI> but other Military Orders, may be collected from the Pictur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of some of them, as well as from their Seals, Coins, and Medals, for in these they have been pleased to exhibit their Effigies and Escutcheons of Arms; and omitting Foreign Examples, the Collars, both of the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>Thistle,</HI> were express'd in the Coronation Me∣dal of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in <HI>Scotland,</HI> 1633. tho' in that of his Coronation at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and afterwards in that of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. 1661. the Collar of the Order of the <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> are only put over their Royal Robes.</P>
<P>THESE Ornaments of the Collars, have been affix'd sometimes encircling the Shields of their Arms; and in a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of <HI>Charles the Bold.</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> Sovereign of the Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> plac'd to an Instru∣ment dated, 1470. it is worthy of Remark, that Collar adorns the Neck of the Lyon of <HI>Flanders;</HI> but the Sovereigns of the <HI>Garter</HI> usually encompass'd their Arms, not within the Collar of the Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, but the Royal Garter, that being its principal Ensign; and
<PB N="177" REF="190"/>
sometimes, having no Shield of Arms, the void Space within the Garter, exhibits their Arms.</P>
<P>OBSERVABLE is the Seal of <HI>Charles</HI> Count <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> wherein is a Shield quarterly of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> obscuring the Lyon Guardant its Supporter, his Four SS's only appearing quadrangularly, and his Head a top ensign'd with an Electoral Crown; this Shield is encircled both within the Garter and Collar of the Order, and is the first Example wherein both these Ensigns are jointly together. It is very frequent to ex∣press the Collars of different Orders together: Thus I have seen the Arms of <HI>Robert Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> entour'd within the Garter, and a Collar of the Order of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> having been Knight of these Orders, and the Funeral Atchievement of the late <HI>James Hamil∣ton Douglas</HI> Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> had the Garter and a Collar of the Thistle about it. And in a Plate under the Effi∣gies of the Duke of <HI>Aspernons,</HI> a Shield of his Arms quarter'd, is encompass'd with the chiefest Ensigns of those Three Orders, whereof he was a Brother and Companion, <HI>viz.</HI> with the Garter and the Collars of St. <HI>Michael</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> And the older the Order is in the Roll of Antiquity, whose chief Ensign is there represented, the nearer ought it to be plac'd to the Escutcheon of Arms, being the more Honourable Post. A Mistake was committed in the marshalling these Col∣lars, when the Duke of <HI>Chevereux</HI> affixed it over his Stall at <HI>Windsor,</HI> the Collars of St. <HI>Mithael</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> are plac'd nearer to his Escutcheon than that of the Garter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 8. AND whereas we have spoke of another kind of Collar, call'd a Collar of SS's, worn as Badges of lower and inferior Honour, it will not be amiss to inform our Judgment in other Affairs concerning them, <HI>Wicelius</HI> informs us from a Book in the Library of <HI>Fulda,</HI> where (in the Life of the Two Brothers <HI>Simplicius</HI> and <HI>Faustinus,</HI> both Senators, and suffer'd Martyrdom under <HI>Dioclesian)</HI> there is a Description of the Society of St. <HI>Simplicius,</HI> consisting of Noble Personages in their own Families, and describing the Collar wore as the Badge of it says, thus: <HI>It was the Custom of those Persons to wear about</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="191"/>
<HI>their Necks Silver Collars, compos'd of double SS</HI>'s, <HI>which denote the Name of Saint</HI> Simplicius, <HI>between these double SS's. The Collar consisted of Twelve small Plates of Silver, in which were engraven the Twelve Articles of the Creed, toge∣ther with a single Trefoil: The Image of St.</HI> Simplicius <HI>hung at the Collar, and from it Seven Plates, representing the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost. As to the manner of their Martyrdom, they were bound together by the Neck to a Stone, and thrown over the Bridge into the River</HI> Tyber.</P>
<P>AT what Time the Collar of SS<HI>'s</HI> came into <HI>England</HI> is not fully determin'd, but it will appear at least Three Hundred Years since, and worn as an Ornament for Women, as well as Men; for on a Monument in the Collegiate Church of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Figure of <HI>Margaret,</HI> Wife to Sir <HI>William Peito</HI> (said to be interr'd <HI>Temp. Edw.</HI> III.) hath a Collar of SS<HI>'s</HI> drawn about, and set close to her Neck, which the Sculpture in <HI>The Antiqui∣ties of</HI> Warwickshire, by mistake, represented like a Ruff. There was also a Collar of SS<HI>'s</HI> about the Neck of Sir <HI>Simon Burley</HI>'s Statue in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>IN the ancient Creation of an Esquire in <HI>England,</HI> part of the Ceremony was the King's putting about his Neck a Silver Collar of SS<HI>'s.</HI> And <HI>Selden,</HI> in his Titles of Honour contemns not the old Ballad, <HI>The Tanner of</HI> Tamworth, to prove the Creation of Esquires in King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV's Reign, by conferring such Collars on them. But that the Golden one was the undoubted Badge of a Knight, as may be instanc'd by many undeniable Ex∣amples, deduc'd from the Monuments of such Persons, <HI>Temp. Hen.</HI> VI. <HI>Ed.</HI> IV. <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and since, and so legally appropriate thereto, that in the Act 24 <HI>H.</HI> VIII. made for Reformation of Apparel, there is a Proviso entred, That Knights, notwithstanding, might pub∣lickly wear a Gold Collar of SS<HI>'s,</HI> tho' since it is grown obsolete and useless. <HI>Favin</HI> tells us that our <HI>Hen.</HI> V. in∣stituted an Order surnam'd Knights of the SS<HI>'s,</HI> on the Day of the Martyrs St. <HI>Crispine</HI> and <HI>Crispianus;</HI> which tho' he found nothing of it in our <HI>English</HI> Historians, yet from the Chronicle of <HI>Juvenal des Ursins,</HI> where he treats of the Battle of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> he collected this fol∣lowing Relation.</P>
<Q><PB N="179" REF="192"/>
THE King of <HI>England</HI> exhorted his Men, and commanded, That if any had trespass'd against ano∣ther, they should be reconcil'd and confess'd to the Priests, otherwise no good Success wou'd accrew to them in their Attempts. He advis'd them to be civil in their March, and to do their Duty well, and agreed upon these Conditions, That those of their Company who were not of gentle Extraction he wou'd make so from the Fountain of Honour, and give them Warrants, that for the future they should enjoy the Privileges the Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> had; and to the End they might be distinguish'd from o∣thers, he granted them leave to wear a Collar powder'd with the Letter S.</Q>
<P>AMONG the Variety of Collars of SS's now in vogue, there are these following: The Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI>'s Collar is compos'd of Gold, having a Knot (like one of those that tye the Garters together in the great Col∣lar of the Order) inserted between Two SS<HI>s,</HI> and they again situated between Two Roses, <HI>viz.</HI> a White Rose within a Red, and in the Middle before the Breast is a large Portcullis, whereat hangs a most rich Jewel sett with large Diamonds.</P>
<P>THE Collars of the Lords Chief Justices of both the Benches, and the chief Baron of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> are (in Memory of the said St. <HI>Simplicius,</HI> a Senator, and consequently a Gownman) form'd of the Letter S, and a Knot alternately, having a Rose set in that part of it which falls out to be in the Middle of their Breasts, and another on their Backs; the Five Flowers of these Roses are constituted of Five large Pearls.</P>
<P>THOSE Collars, which appertain to the Kings and Heralds of Arms, as well as to Serjeants at Arms, ha∣ving been bestow'd by former Kings, and renew'd to them by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to be worn upon Days of so∣lemn Attendance, are compos'd of SS's link'd together. In the Middle of the Breast is a Rose, at each of which hangs Three small Drops of Silver; but the SS's in the Collars worn by the Kings of Arms are made somewhat larger than the other, and in that part lying on either Shoulder, is a Portcullis taken in between the SS's, which are wanting in the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="193"/>
THE general difference of the Collars appropriate to the before-named Degrees, is this; Knights have allow'd them Collars of Silver gilt, but Esquires only Silver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and therefore in the Creating of an Herald, in part of that Ceremony, he is made an Esquire, by putting on him a Collar of SS's of Silver; and so is a Serjeant at Arms.</P>
<P>THE Kings of <HI>England</HI> have sometimes been pictured with a Collar of SS's about their Arms, in like manner as the Garter doth surround them, as appears from an Impression of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Privy Signet; whereon his Royal Arms crown'd are encircled with a Collar of SS's, to the lower End of which are affix'd Two Port∣cullisses.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 9. WE come now to the lesser <HI>George</HI> of the Order; and we do not find that the Effigies of St. <HI>George</HI> was at any time worn by the Sovereign or Knights-Compa∣nions, before the Breast or under the Arm, as now used till the 13th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. But then that King decreed in a Chapter held at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> the Morrow after St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, That every Knight should wear loosely before his Breast the Image of St. <HI>George</HI> in a Gold Chain, or otherwise, in a Ribband, the same to be fasten'd within the ennobled Garter, for a manifest Distinction between the Knights-Companions, and o∣thers of the Nobility and Knights, who, according to the Mode of those Times, wore large Gold Chain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the ordinary Ensigns of Knighthood. And thus the wearing the Medal or Jewel, usually call'd the lesser <HI>George,</HI> to distinguish it from the other Work at the Collar of the Order, first receiv'd the Injunction, and hath since been frequently used.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>George</HI> was, for the most part, pure Gold curi∣ously wrought, but divers of them were exquisitely graved in Onyx's and Agats, and with such a happy Collection of the Stones, that heightned and received their Beauty by the Skill of the Artificer, in contriving the Figures and History, the natural Tincture of the Stones have so fitted them with Colours for Flesh, Hair, and every thing else, even to Surprize and Admiration. In this Jewel is St. <HI>George</HI> represented in a Riding
<PB N="181" REF="194"/>
Posture encountring the Dragon with his drawn Sword.</P>
<P>BY the last Article of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's. Statutes, it was allowed to be enriched at the Pleasure of the Pos∣sessor, (as is the great George) which for the most Part hath been curiously enamell'd, and the Garter about it sett with Diamonds. And of what weight and bigness these lesser <HI>George</HI>'s were, may be gather'd from that sent to the French King <HI>Charles</HI> IX. being an Ounce and an half and half quarter Weight. The Variety of Workmanship in those Gold Chains whereat this Jewel hung, was usually great, according to the Fancy and Pleasure of the Persons for whom they were wrought. But within a short Space, wearing the lesser George in Silk-Ribbands, as well as Gold-Chains, was promiscu∣ously us'd and <HI>ad Libitum.</HI> (So were the Symbols of Fo∣reign Orders, as divers Coins and Medals declare.) But the Colour of these Ribbands when they came first to be wore, was black. <HI>John Dudley</HI> Viscount <HI>Lisle,</HI> the Lords St. <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Parr,</HI> so used them at their Investiture, 35 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and several Pictures of other Knights-Companions about that time confirm the same. That small Chain whereat hung the lesser <HI>George</HI> transmitted to <HI>Emanuel</HI> of <HI>Savoy, Ann.</HI> 1 &amp; 2 <HI>Ph. &amp; Mar.</HI> was formed of twelve Pieces of Gold, in every of which was sett three small Diamonds, and of twelve other like Pieces, wherein were three Rubies and twenty four Pearls.</P>
<P>IT appears by a Letter of Sir <HI>Richard</HI> St. <HI>George,</HI> Kt. <HI>Clarencieux,</HI> dated <HI>July</HI> 10th, 1627. that the blue Ribband had some Years before been additional to the Ornament of the Order; and 'tis reported, that <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> observing in <HI>France</HI> the Jewels of the Order of St. <HI>Michael</HI> and St. <HI>Esprit</HI> worn in blue Ribbands, upon his return was the principal motive those Ribbands whereat the <HI>George</HI> hung, were exchanged into that Colour. And in a Picture of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> drawn towards the Declension of her Reign, her lesser George is represented hanging before her Breast in a blue Rib∣band. And this Colour was more caressed, and grew in great repute, by reason it was the Ground of the Gar∣ter, and nearest the Colour of the Mantle of the Order: So that toward the latter End of the Reign of King
<PB N="182" REF="195"/>

<P>THE George King <HI>Charles</HI> I. had at his Martyrdom, was curiously Engraved in an Onyx set about with twenty One large Table-Diamonds in the Fashion of a Garter. On the reverse of the said George was the Picture of the Queen set in a Case of Gold, the Lid neatly enamell'd with Goldsmith's Work, and surrounded with another Garter adorned with an equal Number of Diamonds, as
<PB N="183" REF="196"/>
was that of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. also sett with fair Diamonds; and after the Defeat given to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Forces at <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> II. was strangely preserved by Colonel <HI>Blague,</HI> one of that King's dispersed Attendants, who re∣signed it for safety to the Wife of Mr. <HI>Barlow</HI> of <HI>Blare-Pipe-House</HI> in <HI>Stafford-shire,</HI> where he took Sanctuary; from whom <HI>Robert Milward</HI> Esq; receiv'd and gave it into-the Hands of Mr. <HI>Isaac Walton,</HI> (all Loyalists.) It came again to <HI>Blague</HI>'s Possession, then Prisoner in the Tower; whence making his escape, he restor'd it to King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of Remark, that besides the Sovereign of the most Noble Order of the Garter, other Princes of Christendom have assumed the bearing St. <HI>George</HI> en∣countring the Dragon in like Posture, tho' not so an∣ciently, nor upon the same Grounds and Foundation as they; probably having elected him Patron and Guar∣dian of their Countries or Families; such as the Em∣perors of <HI>Russia,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and the Counts <HI>Mansfield</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> as their Seals and Coins plainly demonstrate.</P>

<P>§ <HI>10.</HI> When the Habit or part of it ought to be worn is the next thing we shall speak of.</P>
<P>THE more solemn Days and Occasions which require a fuller conformity, and the wearing the whole Habit, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Garter, Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, Collar, Great George, and Cap, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first, The High Festival of the Order, commonly called St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast, whether it be solemnized on the 22d, 23d or 24th of <HI>April,</HI> annually, or any other Days within the Year by Prorogation, as is apparent by all the Bodies of the Statutes.</P>
<P>FOR, First it is ordained, That the Knights-Compa∣nions should be Arrayed in the whole Habit on the Eve of St. <HI>George,</HI> before the Sovereign proceeded to the Chapter to hear Divine Service, and being so Robed, should attend on the Sovereign to the Chapter-House, thence to the Chapel, and return with him back in the same manner, until after Supper, as well those that minded to Sup, as those that should not Sup; nor might they disrobe, until the Sovereign or his Deputy had put off his, or declar'd it seasonable for his or their doing so.</P>
<P>BY the same Statute they were enjoined to wear the whole Habit on the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> both at their Progression in the Morning to the Chapter-House or Chapel, at their return to Dinner from thence to the Second Vespers, and back to Supper, as also till Supper was over, and until the Sovereign or his Lieutenant took leave of the rest of the Knights-Companions.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="198"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> IT is manifest from King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Sta∣tutes, That the Eve, the Day of St. <HI>George,</HI> and Mor∣row following, were to be observed with solemn Ser∣vice, and holding of Chapters wheresoever the Sove∣reign was resident; tho' the Grand Feast were Prorogued to a longer Duration; and when by reason of such Pro∣rogation, they should convene in any Place besides <HI>Windsor</HI> to attend the Sovereign for the Solemnization of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, they then must Adorn themselves with the whole Habit from beginning of the first Ves∣pers, until the last Evening Service of the same Day.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> ON such other Days of the Year whereon the Grand Feast is held by Prorogation, and during such Part of the Eve and Day of the Feast, as is before ap∣pointed when it is held on its proper Day.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> BY absent Knights, whensoever the Grand Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> should be celebrated, and whereso∣ever they should happen at that time to reside, (if at Liberty, and not under restraint) to keep it in like manner as if then present with the Sovereign, or his Deputy in the Place where he should Celebrate the Feast. The time of wearing the whole Habit in this Point extends but to the End of the second Vespers, as in the second Instance above.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE Knights-Companions are to wear the entire Habit at the Feasts of Installation when they assist at that Ceremony; where, if it commence in the Evening, they are not to disrobe themselves till after Supper; and being the next Morning habited as be∣fore, then to proceed to the Chapter-House or Cha∣pel, and not to devest themselves till Dinner is ended.</P>
<P>THE less solemn Occasions are those, which require the wearing the Mantle or Collar of the Order only.</P>
<P>AND they are first, upon the Morrow after the Grand Feast-Day, when the Sovereign and Knights-Companions proceed to the Chapel, and make their Offering; then it sufficeth, that they barely put on the Mantle, which, Service being Finished, they were wont to leave it at the Chapter-House-Door as they retired out of the Chapel.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> AS often as Chapters are called, and in what Place soever assembled, either for Elections, or other Causes, as it shall please the Sovereign to nominate:
<PB N="186" REF="199"/>
And as often as it is requisite for the Sovereign, or any of the Knights-Companions to enter into the Chapel of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor;</HI> and in reference hereunto, is the Article 15 <HI>E.</HI> 3. was that their Mantles should remain in the Vestry at <HI>Windsor,</HI> that upon any sudden emergency, they might be in readiness: for in the Inventory of the Chapel taken 8 <HI>R.</HI> 2. we find remaining at that time in the Vestry, a Mantle appertaining to the Sove∣reign, another to <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Britain,</HI> a third to <HI>John Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> another to <HI>Edmund Langley</HI> Earl of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and one to <HI>Thomas Holland,</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> all of them then surviving<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And by a Decree past at the Grand Feast 1 <HI>H.</HI> 6. the Mantle of the young Sovereign was appointed to be left at <HI>Windsor,</HI> as the Statutes required; and this Article was confirmed by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. by Virtue whereof, the Mantles of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. and <HI>Anna</HI> Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> were left in the Custody of the Dean and Canons of <HI>Windsor.</HI> And heretofore in the Bill of drawing up Matters neces∣sary for the Installation of a Knight-Companion, there were usually two Mantles set down; one expressed to be left in the College, and the other for all other Occa∣sions that might intervene.</P>
<P>THESE Mantles thus ordered to be reposed in the College upon emergent Occasions, were anciently com∣mitted to the Custody of the Black-Rod, as granted by Letters Patent with the Office 1 <HI>H.</HI> 5. And after the Death of the Owners, devolved to the Dean and Canons of <HI>Windsor,</HI> either for the publick Use of the Knights-Companions when they casually came to <HI>Windsor,</HI> or else sold sometimes to the Heirs of the Deceased, or others who succeeded in the Order, as that of <HI>Charles</HI> V. was to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and that of the Constable of <HI>France</HI> lent to the Earl of <HI>Warwick, Ann.</HI> 7 <HI>Eliz.</HI> which appears from the Accounts of the Chanter of the College, <HI>temp. H.</HI> 4. <HI>H.</HI> 5. <HI>H.</HI> 8. Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> and <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. who in all times answered the full Benefit thereof to the College, as being a certain Perquisite to the Dean and Canons, which they accordingly had and enjoyed.</P>
<P>AND yet we find some of the College made over∣bold with the Robe of <HI>Sigismond</HI> the Emperour, and sold it while he surviv'd. But the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> who,
<PB N="187" REF="200"/>
as Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> visited the College, 1431. secured the Money from being distributed among those that sold it, and reserved the Dividend to the Dean and Chapter that should chance to be living at that Emperour's Expiration; and commanded for the Future under Pain of Excommunication, That no Dean and Canon should imbezil or aliene any Knights-Com∣panion's Mantle while he was alive, but the same should be decently and faithfully kept and preserved. But we are informed, that this Statute was altered, <HI>Ann.</HI> 9 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and one drawn up to this effect, <HI>That the Knights-Com∣panions should be bound by Oath to take care by their Wills, that after their Decease, all the Ornaments which they had received should be restored, the Robes to the College, and the Jewels to the Sovereign that gave them.</HI></P>
<P>IN the last Place, the Times of wearing the Collar of the Order, with the Great <HI>George</HI> appendant, which is not only enjoined to be worn (as part of the Habit) at the grand Feasts and Feasts of Installation, but also at other times when not any of the rest of the Habit is ordered (saving the Garter) is to be worn, as in spe∣cial, <HI>at the principal and solemn Feasts of the Year,</HI> and o∣ther Feast-Days: To which a particular Order in Chap∣ter, <HI>Ann.</HI> 4 <HI>Eliz.</HI> thus directs, <LIST>

<P>BESIDES these, the Sovereigns and Knights-Compa∣nions have been accustomed to wear this Ensign upon the Anniversary of the Sovereign's Coronation, of the <HI>Gun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Powder Treason,</HI> and, of later Times, on the Sove∣reign's Birth-day: So formerly upon some occasional Ceremonies not relative to the Order; as when a Knight-Companion hath been created into Titles of Dignity and Honour, he had the Collar of the Garter added to his
<PB N="188" REF="201"/>
Investiture, as appears in the Case of <HI>Henry Stafford,</HI> cre∣ated Earl of <HI>Wiltshire, Ann.</HI> 1 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. And at a Chapter held <HI>May</HI> 22d. 1622. That such Knights-Companions as should afterwards assist at the Funeral of any Knight-Companion, should wear the Collar <HI>apert</HI> at the said Funeral. And it was so observed by the Dukes of <HI>Or∣mond</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Manchester</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI> at the Obsequies of <HI>George Monk</HI> Duke of <HI>Albemarle.</HI></P>
<P>Howbeit, the Custom is otherwise as to wearing the Garter, the principal Ensign of the Order; for tho' it be injoyned to be wore at the grand Festivals, &amp;c. yet it does not imply that it might be left off: For indeed it ought daily to be worn both by the Sovereign and Knights Companions. And therefore was it decreed even in its Institution, That if any Knight-Companion should in publick be found without one buckled about his Leg, upon Challenge he should be mulct a Noble to the Dean and College of <HI>Windsor.</HI> By King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Fine was raised a Mark, payable as before to any of the five Officers of the Order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or to the Dean; besides which Fine, the Knight lies liable to a Check. But to alleviate the Strictness, and obviating other Inconveni∣encies, King <HI>Henry</HI> V. admitted of a Qualification; and in case of riding with Boots, ordained, That it might suffice if the Knight-Companion wore some Ribband or Silk-Lace to represent the Garter; tho' in this very Article there is a Proviso, That no Knight-Companion should enter into Chapter, without his Garter buckled about the Leg.</P>
<P>In short, King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. ordained, That the Gold-Chain whereat the lesser <HI>George</HI> (in that Age) hung, should be worn all other days in the Year, except the Principal and Solemn Feasts, whereon the great Collar was ordained to be worn, and except in time of War, Sickness, or long Voyage, in any of which Cases, a Silk-Lace or Ribband, with the Image of St. <HI>George</HI> thereat, was sufficient; and the blue Ribband having since suc∣ceeded in Place of the Cold Chain, the Injunction of this Statute extends to it in all particulars.</P>

<P>§ 1.

<P>AS the Knights-Companions had their Surcoats be∣stowed on them, at the Sovereigns charge, and there∣fore called the Kings Livery, so had the Officers of the Order their Liveries or Robes out of the Sove∣reign's Wardr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be, and in particular the Prelate of the Order: For in the Rolls of the great Wardrobe, we find that <HI>William de Edyngton</HI> had allow'd him for his Robe of the Sovereign's Livery, against the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> Anno 37. <HI>Ed.</HI> III. one Cloth of Sanguine grain, and a large quantity of Furs for trimming it up: And we find this Robe so assigned the Prelate to be of the sute or colour of the Knights-Companions Sur∣coats the same Year, <HI>viz.</HI> Sanguine in grain, and that he had a great allowance of Furr; for his being a Man∣tle was l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rger than any of the Knights Surcoats, tho' they are both call'd by the same name <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> in the Rolls of the Wardrobe. <HI>Anno</HI> 7. <HI>Rich.</HI> II. <HI>William de W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI>

then Prelate had the same allowance, one Cloth of Vio∣let in grain and other Materials. But the Discrimina∣tion was in the Bellies of Minevers, whose Number was now much encreased, and that the same allowance was bestowed on him in the 11th and 19th Years of the said King. But in these three Instances the Colour of the Cloth was different, and suitable to the Knights-Companions Surcoats, those very Years, <HI>viz.</HI> Violet in grain, White and Blue, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1 2. <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the Robe of <HI>Henry Beaufort,</HI> Cardinal and Prelate was White, as then were the Surcoats of the Knights-Com∣panions, whence it is evident the Livery formerly allowed the Prelate annually varied in Colour, as did the Knights-Companions Surcoats.</P>

<P>ABOUT 12 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Prelate and Chancellor Pe∣tition'd the Sovereign to restore them their ancient Rights and Privileges of Honour, in relation to their Ensigns and Robes upon their outward Garments, whereupon 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. it was Ordered in Chapter, that the Knights-Commissioners (newly Established by that Chapter) should take into their consideration the Robes the Prelate and Chancellor were to be invested with, and certify the Sovereign the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cient Colour and Fashion; but nothing was effected untill after the Restoration, and then by Warrant under the Signet of the Order, Dated <HI>February</HI> 19. 13. <HI>Car.</HI> II. the Prelate had assigned him for his Livery of the Order, one Robe of Purple Velvet, containing 18 Yards, and 10 Yards of white Taffaty for Lining, as also the Arms of St. <HI>George</HI> within a Garter, wrought with Letters, and Purls of Damask, Gold and Pearls, having Laces, Buttons and Tassels of purple Silk, and <HI>Venice</HI> Gold; but what inducements the Sovereign had for so changing the Murray Colour for Purple, has not reached our Intelligence.

of the Constitutions, to be Yearly on the Vigil and Day of St. <HI>George,</HI> wheresoever he is at liberty, whether it be in Parliament, or any other solemn Occasion, or Festival whatsoever.</P>
<P>THE Honours conferred on this Officer, are, that his Post in all Proceedings and Ceremonies of the Order, is on the right Hand of the Chancellor; that he hath the Privilege of Marshalling his Arms within the ennobled Garter, and accordingly hath it been custo∣mary to surround them, impaling his See.

<P>§ 2. THE institution of the Chancellors Office, his Oath, Robe, Badge, and Pension next follows to be han∣dled. At the Erecting this Noble Order, the common Seal was ordained to remain in the custody of whomso∣ever the Sovereign should please to lodge it, but expresly to be one of the Knights-Companions; among whom in after times, Sir <HI>John Robertsack</HI> is Stiled <HI>Custos Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illi Or∣dinis,</HI> having the custody of it by Decree, 1. <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. by a Prolepsis of Speech, Styled Chancellor in the Black Book. But King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. finding it requisite to fix the Office of Chancellor of the Garter, in a Person distinct from the Knights-Companions, and subservient to them, Decreed in a Chapter at <HI>Westminister,</HI> 16 <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gni sui,</HI> That the Seal of the Order should be resigned to <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI> to keep
<PB N="194" REF="208"/>
during pleasure, and he to be called Chancellor of this most noble Order; not long after by Letters Patent, under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> Dated the 10th of <HI>Oct.</HI> 15. <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. this King declared, that tho' this Office was not expressed by the Founder's Statutes, yet was it nevertheless very useful, and therefore for the Advance∣ment, and good of the Order, he constituted an Of∣ficer named Chancellor: And forasmuch as this Office was of great Import and Concern, and required an ex∣pert and able Person, it was His further Pleasure, that none but a Bishop should Execute it; moreover con∣sidering the Chapel of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> was Found∣ed within the Diocess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and having regard to the prudence and diligence of the said <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> who out of meer love to the Order, attended daily the progress of the Work, wherewith the King was then in hand for enlarging the Chapel at <HI>Windsor;</HI> he did therefore Ordain the said Bishop for the Term of his Life, Chancellor of the Order, and after his decease, his Successors, Bishops of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> should always have and hold the said Chancellor-ship; Nevertheless, pro∣vided that the King's Concession should be put in exe∣cution, by the Advice of the Knights-Companions, and without prejudice to the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> in those things which ought by the Statutes of Institution to belong unto him.</P>
<P>THIS Office thus conferred upon <HI>Beauchamp</HI> perso∣nally for Life, and perpetually to his Successors, Bi∣shops of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> by vertue of this Grant continued Chancellors, nor doth it appear that any other Person had been invested therein, until <HI>Ann.</HI> 7. <HI>E.</HI> VI. that Sir <HI>William Cecil,</HI> then principal Secretary of State, was made Chancellor.</P>
<P>FOR upon Reformation of the Order by that King, his Statutes wholly excluded the Ecclesiasticks, and ap∣pointed that the Chancellors-Office should be executed by a Knight qualified, with Honour and Reputation to manage a Post of that Care and Fidelity; he there∣upon appointed Sir <HI>William Cecil,</HI> Chancellor; And here first entred a secular Person, notwithstanding which in a Charter to the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> 4 <HI>Eliz.</HI> (containing the Charters of Queen <HI>Mary, H.</HI> VIII. and
<PB N="195" REF="209"/>
<HI>H.</HI> VII. and in another 4. <HI>Car.</HI> I. the forementioned Letters Patents, made to <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> by King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. are therein recited <HI>totidem verbis,</HI> and confirmed as a Tacit Reservation of the Right and Title of those Bishops, whensoever the Sovereign should have a benign and propitious Aspect towards that See. The first of these Bishops who concerned himself for re∣covering this high Station to that See, was Bishop <HI>Cotton,</HI> who upon the Death of Sir <HI>Edward Dyer,</HI> sometime Chancellor, Petitioned the Sovereign, 6. <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and pray∣ed Restitution thereof to the Church of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> but be∣fore any determination, the two chief Justices, and chief Baron was advised withal, who were of Opinion, that this Office was not compleatly or sufficiently annexed to the Bishoprick of <HI>Salisbury</HI> by King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. But <HI>Cook</HI> in his Institutes, reports the point Void, upon the incertainty of the Grant, for that a new Office was Erected, and not defined what Jurisdiction or Authority the Officer should Exercise; and there's assigned a third Reason, That the Grant was in the Sovereign's disposal, because the Patent was obtained without Fee; with one or more of these Opinions, the Sovereign's judg∣ment being swayed, He forthwith nominated Sir <HI>John Herbert,</HI> one of His privy Council to the Chancellor∣ship, and so this affair remained Silent, until <HI>Anno</HI> 12. <HI>Car.</HI> I. when <HI>John Davenant,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> upon Sir <HI>Francis C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anes</HI> decease, remonstrated to the So∣vereign his Claim to this Office, whereupon at a Chapter held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 5th of <HI>Dec.</HI> that Year, the Sovereign propos'd to the Knights-Companions present, that tho' he had made Election of Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> for his Chancellor that time, yet understanding a Claim made by the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> that the Place was annexed to that See, he commanded the Lords-Companions to take the pretence of right into their considerations; to which proposition of the King's, they answered that they thought it not their duty to search for the Title of any Person, but that if the Bishop did produce his Evidence and Proofs, he might present it in Chapter to be considered.</P>
<P>UPON this Encouragement, the Bishop presented a Petition, which was read in the Chapter at <HI>Windsor,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="210"/>
the 18th of <HI>April</HI> ensuing, to this effect, That King <HI>Edw.</HI> IV, by Letters Patent, had Erected this Office of Chan∣cellor, and did then grant the same to <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and his Successors for ever, in con∣sideration that the Chapel of St. <HI>George</HI> was within their Diocess; that those Bishops had enjoyed the same, according to the Charter, which Charter had been con∣firmed under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by some other Kings and Queens, and lastly by the King himself. But that the use and exercise of that Office had for many Years been discontinued from them, praying therefore an Hearing, and Examination, that the right of the said Church might be preserved and restored. To the substance of which it was objected.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THAT the Great Seals of <HI>England</HI> did not work within, or upon the Statutes and Rules of the Order of the Garter.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> THAT no Grant could prescribe the present Sovereign, it being a Law Fundamental within the Or∣der, <HI>Suprema Lex</HI> was <HI>Suprema Voluntas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> THAT it did not appear by the Records of the Order, that the Office of the Chancellor was any other∣wise conferred upon <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salis∣bury,</HI> than <HI>quam diu Regiae celsitudini complaceret.</HI></P>
<P>TO the <HI>First,</HI> It was answered by way of Exception, as to the Grant of Offices, forasmuch as the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> was took into, and became legal within the Order in like cases; and not any Patent for an Office, had past under the Seal of the Order, but under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and in particular the Office of the Chancellor-ship, which had not been transacted, if any legal defect had been therein.</P>
<P>TO the <HI>Second,</HI> granting it was so as was Objected, it appeared that the Sovereign was as much at liberty to restore this Office to the See of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> as continue it to secular Dignities.</P>
<P>TO the <HI>Third,</HI> what was alledged out of the Records of the Order, related only to the time of delivering the Seals to Bishop <HI>Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>champ:</HI> But afterwards when the Office was Erected by Letters Patent, it was then granted to him during Life. Something was replied from the Judges Opinions, even in this case, <HI>Ann. Jac.</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="211"/>
R. VI. But the Sovereign thought it was not then well canvass'd and weighed, to permit the Chapter Acts of this Order, wholly independant from other Laws, to receive construction and determination from the com∣mon Law, and therefore declared that the Bishop ought to be heard; and to that purpose, gave him Orders to prepare the Vouchers and Proofs of his pretensions in vindication of his Petition, and to send them to be delivered to the Knights-Commissioners, elected for the affairs of the Order, for their consideration at the next Chapter, which was accordingly put in execution, and then refierred to them again to be considered, prepar∣ed and abbreviated, to be perused by the Sovereign, for his final determination. But the <HI>Scotch</HI> War shortly af∣ter breaking forth, and troubles running high at Home, the further Prosecution was laid aside, and not revived until the 19th of <HI>Nov. Anno</HI> 21. <HI>Car.</HI> II. When <HI>Seth Ward,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> took encouragement upon the former grounds, and the Sovereign's favour, to set on foot this Claim, by a Petition presented to the Chap∣ter then held at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where, after a full debate and mature deliberation had of its equity and just Foun∣dation, he obtained a Decree for Re-establishment of this Office on the Bishops of that See, upon the first vacancy, Dated the 19th of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1669. and present his Majesty the Sovereign, the Dukes of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> Earls of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Manchester,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Earls of <HI>Bristol</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the OATH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Oath the <HI>Chancellor</HI> takes at his Admission which we find to be the same with the Prelates, and in the like humble Posture upon the Knee, and usually Administred by the Register of the Order. As to his Robe, it was at first the same with the Prelates, both for Cloth and Colour, but his proportion of Cloth far less, having allowed him but 5 Yards, when the Pre∣late had 24, nor but 3 Timber of Minever gross, where the Prelate had 19, beside a large quantity of o∣ther Furs; nor was the Colour confined to one kind, until the constitutions of this Office appointed it to be
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
Crimson, as was the Prelates, for no doubt it was be∣fore annually changed, as his was to the Colour of the Knights-Companions Surcoats; however by the Picture of the ancient Habits of the Officers, it is conspicuous, it was debared the Royal Badges, wherewith the Pre∣lates Rose was Embroidred; when the Colour of the Prelates Robe was changed to Murray, the Chancellors had the same Alteration and was Trim'd alike in all other particulars. The proportion allowed to Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> for his Livery, <HI>Anno</HI> 14. <HI>Eliz.</HI> was 18 Yards of Murray Velvet, 12 Yards of Sarcenet for the Lining, one Garter wrought with Pearls of Damask Gold for the Shoulder, one Lace (or Cordon) with But∣tons, and Tassels of blue Silk and <HI>Venice</HI> Gold, and the same Materials and Quantities were afterwards distri∣buted out of the Sovereigns great Wardrobe, to the succeeding Chancellors.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Anno</HI> 13. <HI>Car.</HI> I. The Prelate and Chancellor en∣deavouring a Reformation in this Habit, the Dye both of the Prelates and this Officers Robe was changed into Purple.</P>
<P>BESIDES this Robe, the Chancellor of the Order hath an honourable Badge of Distinction assigned him to wear, first granted to Sir <HI>William Peters</HI> and his Successors, the 9th of <HI>October,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar. viz.</HI> a golden Rose enclosed within a Garter, which he and his Successors, Chancellors of the Order, have ever since worn daily about their Necks; at first it was Pendant in a Gold-Chain, but since in a Purple Ribband. It seems some∣thing of this Design had been in Agitation a little be∣fore, so soon as the Chancellorship became vested in a Layman; for King <HI>Edward</HI> VI's Statutes did Ordain, <HI>That the Chancellor should wear about his Neck a Cross of the Order, with a red Rose, in a white, of Gold, all compassed within a Garland of red and white Roses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND because it was suggested to King</HI> Charles <HI>I. That there were different Accounts and Uncertainties con∣tained in some Books concerning the Wearing of this Badge, He, by Warrant dated at</HI> Oxford <HI>the 16th of</HI> De∣cember <HI>in the 21st Year of his Reign, 1645. ordained Sir</HI> James Palmer <HI>Kt. and Bart. Chancellor of the said Order, (and his Successors)</HI> should wear about his Neck at
<PB N="199" REF="213"/>
all times in Honour of his said Place, (that thereby he may be known to be of that Office and Dignity, as hath been accusto∣med) a Medal or Jewel of Gold enamelled with a red Rose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (within a Garter of Blue enamel, with this Sentence inscribed, <HI>Hony soit qui mal y pense)</HI> or such an one as we or the rest of the Knights-Companions of the said Most Noble Order of the Garter do or shall from time to time hereafter wear in our Col∣lars of the said Order in particular Reference to us or them. And in the Reverse thereof, he shall bear the Escutcheon of St. <HI>George</HI> enamelled within a Garter also in reference to the Order it self, which he only shall wear hanging by a light purple Ribband, or in a gold Chain, as hath been accustomed.</P>
<P>AMONG the Officers of the Order, the Chancellor is seated next beneath the Prelate, and in all Proceedings and Sessions, goeth, and sitteth, on his left Hand: And as it was ordered by the Constitutions of the Offi∣cers, That if the Chancellor hapned to be a Layman, he should be also a Knight, and have other personal Endowments. So did King <HI>Charles</HI> I. conceive it requi∣site to confer some further Mark of Distinction upon this Officer, in relation to Place and Precedence without the Order; to which effect, there passed a Decree in a Chapter assembled by the Sovereign at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> 1623. present, the Earls of <HI>Mulgrave, Mont∣gomery, Rutland, Carlisle, Holland, Suffolk, Pembroke, Arundel</HI> and <HI>Surrey, Salisbury, Dorset, Bark-shire</HI> and <HI>Northampton, That Sir</HI> Francis Crane, <HI>the present Chancellor, and all others that should succeed him in that Place hereafter, shall, in right of that Place, in all Assemblies, and upon all Occasions, be ranked and placed immediately aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Knights-Privy-Councellors, and before the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Persons holding both Places, being in</HI> Pari gradu, <HI>and consequently before all others, whom the said Chancellor is to precede,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>AND to the intent the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Place may be certainly known,</HI> May <HI>the 20th, 21</HI> Jac. <HI>I. it was thus established,</HI> That the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the Privy-Councellors, the Master of the Courts of <HI>Wards</HI> and <HI>Liveries,</HI> the Chancellor and Under Treasurer of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> Chancellor of the <HI>Dutchy,</HI> the Chief Justice of the Court of <HI>King's Bench,</HI> the Master of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> the Chief Justice of the Court of <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> the Chief Baron of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and all other Judges and Barons
<PB N="200" REF="214"/>
of the Degree of the Coif, should have Place and Precedency in all Places, and upon all Occasions before the younger Sons of Viscounts and Barons, and before all Baronets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE aforesaid Constitutions provide the Chancellor of the Order an Habitation within the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> as well as the Prelate, which is the South-West Tower in the lower Ward of the Castle, call'd the <HI>Chancellor's Tower.</HI> The Possession thereof had been for some time in the Power of others; and therefore by a Chapter convened at <HI>White-hall, Nov.</HI> 5th, 5 <HI>Car.</HI> I. it was resto∣red unto Sir <HI>Francis Crane,</HI> then Chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellor of the Order, and after his Decease, to descend to his Successors. These Constitutions also ordained him the like Live∣ries at the Table and Court of the Sovereign, as were allowed to the Prelate.</P>
<P>AT the first Erection of this Office, the Chancellor had no Pension awarded him, until the Constitutions in reference to the Officers were Established. At that time there was conferr'd on him a Pension of 100<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> in consideration of his Employment, or else an allowance proportionate in Fees, Offices or other Pro∣motions, over and above his Lodgings in the Castle, and Liveries at Court. But as to Fees and Perquisites, there are none to be Claimed by this Officer; and for that Reason, he not only possesses the said Pension, but all his disbursements allowed him, even to Paper, Wax, and Wafers; and indeed those who enjoyed the Office esteem'd it as a degradation of their Post, to re∣ceive either fee, or gratuity for any affair Transacted within the Order; and Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe,</HI> sometime Chancellor, affirmed <HI>That his Office was an Office of Hon∣our, and not of Fees, and that he had always excepted against Fees, for the disbursement of the Sovereign's Money:</HI> Tho' he acknowledged some had bestowed on his Clerk a small gratuity, for the bare Ingrossing of an Alms Knights Pa∣tent, but nothing farther.</P>
<P>AND because the Custody of the Seals of the Order, appertains to this Officer; it will be here the fittest Place to mention something of them. By the Statutes of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. they were to have a Common Seal. This is confirmed by the Statutes of King <HI>Hen.</HI> V. and since named the Great Seal of the Order. The use of this is
<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
not only to Seal the Original Statutes, appointed to re∣main perpetually within the Treasury of <HI>Windsor</HI> College, as also those Copies of which each Knight-Companion is obliged to conserve one, but likewise all Letters of Licence to any of the Knights-Companions desirous of winning Honour abroad, and all Mandates and Certifi∣cates, relating to the Order.</P>
<P>AFTER what Model the first Seal was compos'd, we have no exact Relation. <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> tells us, That when the Founder of the Order had fixed Choice of St. <HI>George</HI> for its Patron, he represented him Armed, and Mounted on an Horse, bearing a Silver Shield, and thereon a Red Cross, but whether St. <HI>George</HI> thus de∣signed, was on the first Seal, or only a Scutcheon of his Arms, as in latter times, is uncertain. But his Author observes that the Founder Habited his Soldiers in white Jackets or Coats, and on their Breasts and Backs sowed Red Crosses, parallel to the Arms assigned to St. <HI>George,</HI> as well as to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> put under his Patronage, which Arms the Sovereigns of the Order, have ever since exhibied in their Standards. But be∣sides this Common Seal King <HI>Hen.</HI> V. in the 9th Year of his Reign, Instituted a privy Signet, in case the Sove∣reign should be called out of this Kingdom upon weighty Affairs. The intent thereof was to affix it to all Acts passed by the Sovereign beyond Sea, to distinguish them from those of his Deputies in <HI>England.</HI> King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Statutes, Ordain the making both of a Com∣mon Seal and Signet, and direct that the Arms of the Order should be Engraven upon each of them. The Common Seal used in his Reign was a Garter, within it a Shield having the Cross of St. <HI>George,</HI> impaling the National Arms, the said Shield encompassed with two Branches hanging from the Regal Crown, which debruses part of the Garter; the Signet being designed after the same manner, but less: <HI>Temp. Jac.</HI> I. it suf∣fered no other alteration, but only in the National Arms, by admitting the Quarterings of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and new-fashioning the Crown, omitting the sus∣pension of the Shield.</P>
<P>THERE was a Seal made at the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Cha.</HI> I. which being esteemed too little for the Grandure and Honour of the Sovereigns Commissions,
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
it was afterwards Decreed in Chapter, held 18th of <HI>April.</HI> 13. Car. I. <HI>That a new one should be made of a larger Size, with the accustomed Arms and Motto, and the care thereof commited to Sir</HI> Thomas Rowe, <HI>Chancellor;</HI> which Command he Executed with all due care and re∣gard, as is manifestly evident by the nobleness of the design: One Representation being St. <HI>George,</HI> in Ar∣mour, adorned with a waveing Mantle, his Bever open, his Helmet plumed, holding a Shield of his Arms in his left Hand, and striking with a Sword in his right, his Body mounted on a bold Horse, Trampling over a Dragon, which Assails the Champion, the whole Figure is well contracted, and the Sun, a Rock, the Bones of devoured Men, and a Mountain in <HI>Lointon,</HI> in it is Circumscribed, <HI>Magnum sigillum Nobilis Or∣dinis Garterij;</HI> having the enrichments of festons be∣tween every Word placed pentagonally: The other Representation, is the Royal Garter imperially Crown∣ed, enclosing a Shield of the Arms of St. <HI>George,</HI> im∣paling the Sovereign's Arms, the same Bordered with Fret-work, and other Ornaments in Cartouche. In the same decree, direction was given also for a new Signet, the former being thought too big for Letters, and this was an Oval shaped so from its Impression, which was the Garter Crowned, wherein was St. <HI>George,</HI> and the Sovereigns Arms impaled.</P>
<P>IT was at the same Chapter further 'decreed; <Q>That all Legations to deliver this Order to Foreign Princes, all other Acts, bearing the Stile of Com∣missions, all Patents of Offices and Fees, all Grants or Licences sent out of the Kingdom, should be Sealed with this Seal, which should be henceforward called the Great Seal of the Order; so also the Book of Statutes, sent to Elect Knights or Foreign Princes, being fixed to a Label of Blue Silk, and held ac∣cording to antient Custom; and that all Letters con∣cerning the Order, whether of signification of Electi∣on, or Lieutenancy, or Summons upon prorogation, or other Directions from the Sovereign, should only be Sealed with the Signet: Moreover, these Seals were appointed to be thenceforth Born before the Sovereign in all Publick Assemblies, during the
<PB N="203" REF="217"/>
Celebration of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast, or in other its So∣lemnities by the Chancellor of the Order, in a Purse of blue Velvet,</Q> and Command given to Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe,</HI> to provid one a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cordingly; on the foreside of which Purse was richly Embroidred (by a Gold-Smith) with <HI>Venice</HI> Gold and Silver, Gold and Silver Purls and Plates, and variety of <HI>Naples</HI> Silks, the Arms of St. <HI>George</HI> impaling the Sovereign, surrounded with a Garter Crowned, having a very fair Running Work, or Com∣partment round about it, the charge of which amount∣ed to 13 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>BY the Statutes of Institution, it was ordained, That in case the Knights-Companions, to whose care the Sovereign did commit the Seal of the Order, should upon lawful Occasions, be absent from Court, it be∣hoves him to leave it behind him, with some other Knight-Companion to present, to the Sovereign, to the intent it might be always in readiness; but if the Sovereign be out of His Kingdom, then the dispo∣sal of it, was commited to the Deputies, and the Signet of the Order should have a Warrant for all such Acts and Decrees as should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confirmed there.</P>
<P>THE distance from Court was by the Constitutions, restricted to 10 Miles, and by the Statutes of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. to 20. upon consideration whereof we find Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> Chancellor, having some occasions, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. to be absent above 20 Miles, tendred the Seals to the Sovereign, who was pleased to dispence with the Statutes, and permitted him to keep them nevertheless.</P>

<P>§ 3.

The Sovereign thought it conveni∣ent that the Office of Dean and Register should concen∣ter in one and the same Person, as formerly, and there∣fore commanded this his Pleasuer to be Enrolled among the Annals of the Order, that so it might pass in the future Times, from Example into Rule.</P>
<P>BY the Constitutions of the Office, a secular Person is made capable of it, no less than an Ecclesiastick, how be it, <HI>He is to be a Man of singular integrity,</HI> eminent quality, a Knight, and signalized for Experience and Learning; but if an Ecclesiastick, then must he be a Per∣son of consummate Erudition, <HI>a professor of Divinity or Law, either Canon, or Civil,</HI> and a Dignitarian in some Cathedral Church, or else a Canon at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>THE substance of his Oath in the Statute of the Institutions was, <HI>That he should enter upon the Registry, with all Fidelity, the Scrutinies, Elections, Penalties, Reconciliations, and all other Acts relating to the Order,</HI> to which was ad∣ded, that he shall faithfully Discharge his Duty in all things. But in King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth Days, the Oath en∣joyned him, differs nothing from that of the Prelates and Chancellors.</P>
<P>AT his Admission, he takes this Oath Kneeling, while the Prelate used to pronounce the Words as <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Mar.</HI> 5. and 6. <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> but in his absence, as <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Chancellor administred it. <HI>Anno</HI> 4. <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Prelate, Chancellor, and Register, took their Oaths at one time, and then it was thus Ordered; first the Register took it Kneeling between the Sovereign's Knees, the Black Rod holding the Evangelists, and the <HI>Garter</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="219"/>
read the Words out of the black Book; this done, the Register read the Words of the Prelates Oath, when he was Sworn; and in the last place, did the like to the Chancellor; after this manner did Garter read the Words to the Registers, admitted 11 <HI>Car.</HI> I. and 12 <HI>Car.</HI> II. We cannot trace the Habit this Officer had assigned him at the Erection of the Order; but it af∣terwards appears, that his Allowance was the same with the Chancellors, consisting of 5 Yards of Woollen Cloth, and 3 Timber of Minever gross, equalent to what those Knights-Companions had allotted, who were under the degree of an Earl: The Habit he is pourtrayed in, at a proceeding of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth Reign, shews it to be Ecclesiastical, a black Gown, a Surplice over that, reaching to his Ancles, and thereon a Mantle of Furs; but the Constitutions of his Office restricted him to none, wherein there seems a defect, since they have assignd Habits to the Garter, and black Rod. Notwithstanding by a Draught of the Officers in their ancient Dress, it is plainly demonstrable to be a Mantle, somewhat of a Russel colour, Faced with a Pane of blue, whereon is Embroidred a Flower-de∣luce Crowned Gold, then another Pane red, thereon a Lyon Passant gardant Crowned Gold, and so they are al∣ternately placed to the bottom; to this Mantle belong Cordons of Silk, blue and yellow.</P>
<P>SINCE that time, not only the Registers, but also Gar∣ters and Black Rods, Robes, underwent some Altera∣tions; for by a Decree in Chapter, called at St. <HI>James, Jun.</HI> 1. 4 and 5. <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> these Officers were assign∣ed Mantles of crimson Satin, Lined with Taffaty, and a Scutcheon of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Arms, Embroidred on the left Shoulder, but not encircled with a Garter, having the same Buttons and Tassels as wereappointed to the Pre∣late and Chancellor; the proportion of Satin assign∣ed to each Mantle, was 14 Yards, and as many Yards of white Taffaty.</P>
<P>AND tho' the Registers Mantle was <HI>Ann.</HI> 27 <HI>Eliz.</HI> com∣posed of the preceeding Materials, and had like Trim∣ming, yet they agree not in their Proportions, here be∣ing allowed 18 Yards of crimson Satin, and but 12 of Taffaty; from hence these Mantles continued immutable
<PB N="206" REF="220"/>
until the 20th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. when there Issued a Warrant to the Master of the great Wardrobe, to prepare for this Officer, as also for Garter, and the Black Rod, for their Liveries Mantles of scarlet Satin, each containing 18, and 10 Yards of white Taffaty for Li∣ning, but consonant in all other Punctilio's with the former; yet why the colour was altered, is not ex∣pressed.</P>
<P>THE Register seems to have been represented with a Scrowle in his Hand, for his Badge, and by the pro∣ceedings in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, Pictured with a Book, both proper Symbols of his Office. In Dr. <HI>Chri∣stopher Wren</HI>'s Registership, the Sovereign Commanded him to cover the red Book of the Order with crim∣son Velvet, and assigned for the Garter, two Pens in Saltire, interlacing the Garter above with these two Letters <HI>C R</HI> Crowned, all being richly Embroidred, (as also the Border) with <HI>Venice</HI> Gold and Silver, and various colours of <HI>Naples</HI> Silk, by <HI>Harrison</HI> the Sove∣reign's Embroiderer, with a Clasp, in Imitation of the Garter, surrounding the Representation of St. <HI>George,</HI> which cost 12 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> This Book he was Ordered to bear before his Breast, on all Solemn Occasions when he wore his Mantle, and for his better Conveni∣ence, he made a Belt and an Ouch to hang it by.</P>
<P>So high a Regard had the Sovereigns of this Order, not only to this Officer, but likewise to Garter and Black Rod, that they took them into a particular Pro∣tection, and by the Constitutions of their Offices granted them, <Q>That they, their Goods and Servants should severally remain under the Safe-guard of the Sovereign; and if any Injury or Violence should chance to be offered them either by Subjects or For∣reigners, whensoever they should exhibit their Com∣plaint to the Sovereign, either himself or the Knights-Companions should afford them Justice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but if the adverse Party should refuse to submit his Cause to the Sovereign, then the Sovereign and Knights-Companions should shew themselves so far inclinable towards these Officers, as to be ready to allow them all favour, countenance, &amp;c.</Q> consistent with Justice and Equity.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="221"/>
UPON the strength and Security of this ancient Pri∣vilege, to avoid the prolongation of a Law Suit, Dr. <HI>Christopher Wren</HI> Register, Petitioned the Sovereign in Chapter, held at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 19th of <HI>April,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. against one <HI>Thornhill,</HI> who under Pretence of Digging for Salt-Peter, had so Undermined his Pigeon∣house, Built on the Rectory of <HI>Kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Magna</HI> in <HI>Wiltsh.</HI> that it fell down; and upon reading of the Petition, it was resolved by the Sovereign, and Knights-Compani∣ons, <Q>That they would confider the Grant in the Con∣stitutions, and, until it was farther declared, the Chan∣cellor of the Order should have Power upon Infor∣mation of any rigour upon Controverse begun in any other Court, to write Letters under the Signet of the Order, that all vexation against them should be superseded until Information of the cause were gi∣ven to and determination in the Cause resumed by the Sovereign, or leave of him obtained to Proceed.</Q> Af∣ter this it is set down, that <HI>Thornhill</HI> was Summoned before the Lords Commissioners of the Navy, and his ne∣gative Answer given in, and represented to the Sovereign in another Chapter, conven'd the 4th of <HI>October</HI> ensu∣ing; whereupon it was ordered, <Q>That the Chancellor should write to the same Lords Commissioners, and another to the Earls of <HI>Pembroke, Arundel</HI> and <HI>Dorset,</HI> three of the Knights-Companions, to Empower them, that they or any three of them, should cause the said <HI>Thornhill</HI> to be brought before them, and like∣wise write to any of the Inhahitants of <HI>Knoil,</HI> to view and testifie the Truth, to hear any further proof on the behalf of either Party, and to give Sentence ac∣cording to Justice, that so a tedious Suit of Law might be prevented, and the Dignity of this most noble Or∣der protected.</Q> These Commands of the Chancellor being Executed, and Certificates returned from the Country, the Knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Companions, in a Chapter held the 23th of <HI>May,</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. were moved to peruse them; but before they could meet, <HI>Thornhill</HI> fled, and the Pro∣secution of this business ceased.

<P>THIS Officer by the Constitutions hath a Pension of 50 l. <HI>per Annum,</HI> or proportionable in Fees, Offices, or other Emoluments; and <HI>Ann.</HI> 1. and 2 <HI>Ph.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> the same numerical Pension was conferred on <HI>Owen Oglethorp,</HI> Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> out of the Exchequer, un∣til some Ecclesiastical Preferment of like value should devolve on him.

<P>§ 4. THE <HI>fourth Officer of the Order is Garter.</HI> He was ordain∣ed by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. with the advice and consent of all the Knights-Companions, who for the Honour of the Order, was pleased he should be the principal Officer within the College of Arms, and chief of the Heralds. The Services enjoyned him, relating to the Order, were in preceding Times, performed by the <HI>Windsor</HI> Herald of Arms, an Officer created with that Title by K. <HI>Edward</HI> III. much about the time of his Erecting this Order, and an Annual Pension of 20 Marks, payable out of the Exchequer, by Letters Patent for Life, which was confirmed by King R.

<P>SIR <HI>William Brugges</HI> was the Person first created Gar∣ter, and called in the Institution of his Office, <HI>Jartier Roy d'armys des Anglois,</HI> but elsewhere stiled <HI>Willielmus Brugges, alias Dictus, Gartier Rex Armorum.</HI> This Sir <HI>William</HI> became a great Benefactor to St. <HI>George</HI>'s Church at <HI>Stamford,</HI> and in the Windows of the Chancel caused to be Represented King <HI>Edward</HI> III. with his twenty five Knights-Companions kneeling, Habited in their Mantles and Surcoats of Arms, but now much shat∣tered and defaced; <HI>John Smert</HI> his Successor had this Office conferred on him by Letters Patents, under this Title <HI>Rex Armorum de Garteria,</HI> and <HI>John Wrythe</HI> was stiled

<P>THE substance of his Oath administred by the Re∣gister at his admission, whilst he humbly kneeleth at the Sovereign's Feet, in the Chapter House; is,</P>

<P>AND such an Oath Sir <HI>Christopher Barker</HI> took at a Chapter held at <HI>Greenwich</HI> 28 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. when he was made Garter.</P>
<P>AS for a particular Habit, we do not find any inserted in the Great Wardrobe, whence it is presu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, he was at first distinguished from the rest of the Officers of the Order, by his Coat Embroidred with the Sove∣reign's Arms, like as the Provincial King's then wore. But after the Constitutions of the Officers were Esta∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished, there was assigned him a Habit or Mantle in all respects, resembling the Register, (saving that the Ground whereon the Lyons and flower-de-luces were Embroidred, was entirely Red) and this to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wore only at the publick Solemnities of the Order.

THIS Officer is appointed to bear a white Rod or Scepter at every Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Sovereign being present, gilded at both ends, and at the top the Arms of the Order impaling the Sovereign's Arms pourtray'd on an oblong Cube Crowned, but no directions are given in the Constitutions for this Crown, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that Ducal one on his Head wherewith his Effigies has been represented, and yet at all great Solemnities is never used that we can discover.

<P>THERE is an House appointed for his Habitation within <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, called Garters Tower. It was by Chapter annexed for ever to the Office of Gar∣ter, and restored to Sir <HI>William Segar</HI>'s Possession, 2d of <HI>May,</HI> 1630.

<P>HE hath the like Habit with the Register and Garter before described, but his Ensign and Badge is somewhat different from Garter's; for first, it was ordained, <HI>That he or his Deputy should carry a Black-Rod</HI> (whence he hath his Title) <HI>before the Sovereign, or his Deputy, at the Feast of St.</HI> George, <HI>within the Castle of</HI> Windsor, <HI>and at other So∣lemnities and Chapters of the Order.</HI> On the Top of which there ought to be set a Lyon of <HI>England.</HI> This Rod serves instead of a Mace, and has the same Authority to
<PB N="215" REF="229"/>
apprehend Delinquents, and such have offended a∣gainst the Statutes of this Most Noble Order. And where he apprehends any one of the Order, as Guilty of some Crime for which he is to be expell'd the Order, the manner of it is by touching them with this Black-Rod, and his Fee for it, is 5 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>HE has assigned him a Golden Badge to be openly worn in a Gold Chain, or Ribband, before his Breast, composed of one of the Knots in the Collar of the Or∣der which tye the Roses together, and encompassed with a Garter, being alike on both sides; which was conferred on him and his Successors, by Decree in Chapter, held the 24th of <HI>April,</HI> 8 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS as ancient as <HI>Hen.</HI> Vth's Reign, for there's a House in <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle granted to this Officer by Let∣ters-Patent, during Life. And the same Provision is made for him by the Constitutions of his Office. It is situate on the South-side of the Castle in the middle Ward. The said Constitutions give him Baron-Service at Court, and Livery thereto appertaining; and besides these, the keeping of the said Castle, and the two Parks adjacent.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Charles</HI> I. having taken into his Hands the little Park of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and bestow'd it upon <HI>James Maxwell,</HI> then Usher of the Black-Rod, He, at a Chap∣ter held at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 5th of <HI>November,</HI> 1629. de∣creed, That as the Custody of the said Park was con∣ferr'd on <HI>Maxwell</HI> in right of his Office; so the same should for ever after be annex'd thereto, and not to be disposed of but under the Great Seal of the Order, and that only to the Usher of the Order for the time being.</P>
<P>LASTLY, this Officer had anciently a Fee of 12 <HI>d. per diem,</HI> which we find continu'd down in the Letters-Patents, whereby this Office was granted. Besides which, the Constitutions of his Office allow him an annual Pension of 30 <HI>l.</HI> heretofore paid him out of the Exchequer, but by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. assigned him out of 1200 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> settled upon the Order; touching which, and the Payment of the Officers Pensions upon the new Establishment, is the next Section.</P>

<P>§. 6. KING <HI>James</HI> I. taking into his Royal Breast, the Constitution of this Most Noble Order, that it was in the Nature of a Distinct Sovereignty, govern'd by Laws and Conventions proper to the Body, and him∣self as Sovereign in Matters immediately relating thereunto, had the sole and uncontroulable Authority of revising, adding, or explaining; and finding that the Pensions paid to the Officers of the Order (as those to the Alms-Knights) and some other Expences, had been anciently made payable out of his Exchequer by vertue of the Great Seals of <HI>England,</HI> or otherwise by Privy-Seals; and conceiving it incongruous, that the Officers should claim their Pensions by vertue of any other Seal than that of the Order, for it is in some kind derogatory to the Honour of the Order, to per∣mit other Seals to be used within the same: He there∣upon with twelve Knights-Companions in a Chapter held at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 22d of <HI>May,</HI> 20 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. passed a Decree, <HI>That all things concerning the Order should here∣after be ratify'd under the Seal of the Order only, and in par∣ticular, that the Grants of poor Knights Places, after their being Signed by the Sovereign, should be passed under the Seal of the Order only, and none other.</HI> And the Year following, the Chancellor was ordered, <HI>That he should take Advice of the Sovereign's</HI> Attorney-General <HI>how by Vertue of the Seal of the Order, the Pensions,</HI> (given to the Poor Knights) <HI>might be paid and receiv'd,</HI> His Majesty's further Pleasure being, <HI>That all Grants and Payments concerning the Order, should afterwards be confirmed under the Seal of the Order only, and by Vertue thereof.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the Alms-Knights Patents, this Decree was of Force and Validity, but in the other Generals, how far it was pursu'd we know not; for in some of them it grew obsolete and useless. But in a Chapter called at <HI>Windsor,</HI> the 22d of <HI>April,</HI> 10 <HI>Car.</HI> I. a Debate arose about setting a Part of the Annual Summ of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> out of the Re∣ceipts of his Majesty's Exchequer, to be employ'd par∣ticularly in discharge of Expences towards the Feasts of the Order, Legations to Foreign Princes, Payment of the Officers Pensions, &amp;c. disbursed for the Necessity and Reputation of this Noble Order. Afterwards at a
<PB N="217" REF="231"/>
Chapter held the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. that Sove∣reign ratify'd his Royal Assignation, and increased his Bounty to 1200 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> setling it for those designs in a Perpetuity for ever, and making it payable out of the Customs in the Port of <HI>London,</HI> but to be received by the Chancellor of the Order for the time being, as Trea∣surer of this Money, of which he was to give up an Ac∣count to the Sovereign and Knights-Companions yearly at St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast. And in pursuance of this Ratification, the Attorney-General had Instructions to draw up a Book for his Royal Signature to Warrant its passing under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> which was dispatch'd, the Let∣ters-Patent bearing <HI>teste</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the 23d of <HI>Janu∣ary,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. Immediately after, Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe,</HI> the Chancellor of the Order, presented a List of the ordinary Fees and Charges of the Order, upon which it was a∣greed to, <HI>That there should issue out a standing Commission to the Chancellor under the Great Seal of the Order to warrant the Yearly Payments, and he to be discharged according as the said Patent had provided.</HI> This Commission passing the Great Seal the 3d of <HI>May,</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Sovereign there∣by impower'd the Chancellor to make payable out of the yearly Revenue of 1200 <HI>l.</HI> all and every the yearly Fees, Pensions, Salaries, and other Payments due and payable to the Officers of the Order, Alms-Knights, or others, appertaining to the Order, either by Charter, Grant, or Assignation under the Seal and Signet of the Order, or by any other Lawful way whatsoever, and in particular,</P>

<P>THE Manner of the Chancellor's passing his Account, as directed by the said Commission, was thus done by Sir <HI>James Palmer,</HI> He humbly moved the Sovereign in Chapter held the 10th of <HI>October,</HI> 15 <HI>Car.</HI> I.

<P>§. 7. THE Executions of these Offices is the last thing here to be described: For tho' all the Officers are strictly obliged to give personal Attendance to their Offices; yet, in case of Sickness, Absence out of the Kingdom, or other emergent Reasons, the Sovereign is pleased to dispence with them, and constitute others to Officiate in their stead, who on such Occasions wear the Robe of that Officer whom they represent, so in case of Vacancy, the Absence of the Prelate at the Grand Feast celebrated at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 31 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. is noted in the <HI>Black Book</HI> to have been upon just Cause, and the Bishop of <HI>Bangor</HI> officiated Divine Service, and next Morning ce∣lebrated the Mass <HI>pro defunctis.</HI> The following Year, his Place in these religious Duties was supply'd by the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> as <HI>Ann.</HI> 36 and 37 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. and at all times of the Prelates absence, the Sovereign hath made known his Will what Bishop should supply for him. The Office of Chancellor hath been executed by Proxies, and to this may first be referred a Passage in the <HI>Black Book,</HI> where Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> hath the Title of <HI>Vice-Chancellor.</HI> Of later times, when Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> was employ'd in an Embassy into <HI>Germany,</HI> Sir <HI>James Pal∣mer,</HI> Kt. (one of the Gentlemen-Ushers of the Privy-Chamber) was deputed by the Sovereign to the Chan∣cellor-ship during his Absence, having the Purse with the Seals deliver'd to him the 4th of <HI>May,</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. be∣ing sworn by the Register of the Order <HI>durante deputatione &amp; beneplacito Regis,</HI> which Clause was likewise annex'd in the Deputy <HI>Chancellor</HI>'s Oath, 12 <HI>Car.</HI> II.

Sir <HI>James</HI> was again deputed <HI>Chancellor,</HI> and a third time, 18 <HI>Car.</HI> I. continu'd Deputy <HI>Chancellor</HI> unto the Death of Sir <HI>Thomas Rowe,</HI> of which the Sovereign being inform'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> 1644. reserved the disposal of this Office 'till Sir <HI>James</HI>'s return to Court, and then commanded him to wear the Badge and Ribband about his Neck, 'till a Chapter of the <HI>Order</HI> compleated his admittance.</P>
<P>IN the Vacancy of the Register-ship, <HI>Ann.</HI> 2 H. VIII. <HI>Thomas Ruthall</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> supply'd it: And <HI>Ann.</HI> 18 and 19 <HI>Eliz.</HI> Dr. <HI>Day,</HI> Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> execu∣ted the Office, and attended at the Feasts of St. <HI>George,</HI>

as Deputy-Register; Dr. <HI>George Carew</HI> then Register, having Licence by his Patent to execute it by himself or Deputy, being dispenc'd with by the Queen in case of Sickness, or other Impediment. After his Decease, Dean <HI>Day</HI> was commanded to execute the Office during its Vacancy (being 14 Years) which he effected 'till he was advanced to the Bishoprick of <HI>Winchester, An.</HI> 38 <HI>Eliz.</HI> upon which, Dr. <HI>Robert Bennet</HI> (who succeeded him in his Deanry) was the same Year admitted Register. Afterwards, Dr. <HI>Beaumont,</HI> being much broken with Age, and other Diseases, Dr. <HI>John King,</HI> the junior Canon, supplied his Place.</P>
<P>THE Office of Garter hath been supplied by Depu∣tation: For in those Embassies with the Ensigns of the Order to Foreign Princes, where special Occasions de∣tained Garter at home, some of the Kings or Heralds of Arms, have been order'd upon those Employments, upon the Recommendation of Garter to the Sovereign; where of there are several Instances; the last of <HI>Gregory King,</HI> Esq. <HI>Lancaster</HI>-Herald, who lately carried over the Habit to the Elector of <HI>Hanover.</HI> So also in case of Vacancy; for we find that <HI>Clarencieux,</HI> King of Arms, executed this Office after Sir <HI>Gilbert Dethick</HI>'s Death, in <HI>January,</HI> 27 <HI>Eliz.</HI> being then sent with the Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> III.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 1. WE come now to treat of the Election of a Knight into the Order, according to the Statutes of Institution, which Or∣dains, That whensoever any Knight-Companion hap∣pens to depart this Life, <HI>The Sovereign (or his Deputy) after certain Notice had thereof, should forthwith by his Let∣ters, Summon all the Knights-Companions then within the Realm (who were able to come) to meet him within six Weeks after such Notice, in what convenient Place soever he pleased to assign for the Electing a new Companion into the Society.</HI> Thus did the Law of this Most Noble Order, in case of Death, and to prevent Vacancies, at first provide; wherewith we evidently find the Practice of elder Times did pun∣ctually concur: For as soon as Garter, in Discharge of his Duty, had made Certificate to the Sovereign of a Knight-Companion's Decease, or otherwise to the Re∣gister of the Order, all fitting Diligence was used to fill up the vacant Stall, within the Space limited by this Statute, or immediately after, and for the quicker Dis∣patch, Letters of Summons were issued to the Knights-Companions, to give personal Attendance at the Election. In an ancient one upon the Death of Sir <HI>Henry Fitz Hugh,</HI> Knight-Companion, <HI>Temp. Henry</HI> V. these particulars were no less pursuant to the Statutes, than worthy Ob∣servation.</P>
<Q><P>I. The Day whereon the defunct Knight-Compa∣nion died is therein set down.</P><P>II. Direction is given for celebrating Masses, ac∣cording to the Tenor of the Statutes.</P><P>III. Intimation that a Stall is become void by the Knight's Decease.</P><P>IV. The Law of the Order vouched, which ap∣points an Election of another Knight within six Weeks after Certificate made of the Death of the former, to avoid as much as may be an interval in Succession.</P><P><PB N="226" REF="236"/>
V. The Sovereign's Power asserted where he sees Cause to Prorogue the Election.</P><P>VI. An Injunction to attend personally at the E∣lection, under a Penalty express'd in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atutes.</P><P>VII. The Day, Place, and Hour for Appearance is with certainty appointed, to the End all might Ac∣commodate themselves to be present.</P><P>VIII. The End of coming is mention'd with full Disposition and Preparation <HI>to perform what the Sta∣tutes in this Case requir'd.</HI></P><P>IX. Lastly, Direction is there given to the Knight summoned, that in case his coming to the Chapter was impeded, he should certifie the Reason of his Default against the time of his Appearance, of the Validity whereof the Sovereign was to be sole Umpire.</P></Q>
<P>AND generally of these Topicks, and to this Purport were the Letters of Summons in succeeding times com∣posed.</P>
<P><HI>THE before-mention'd Branch of the Statutes of In∣stitution hath been sufficiently enforced by Incorpora∣ting it into the Statutes,</HI> temp. H. <HI>V. and</HI> H. <HI>VIII. no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath it since undergone any Alteration; howbeit some further Addition and Explanation were annexed to them, 21</HI> Jac. <HI>I. at a Chapter held at</HI> Windsor <HI>the 24th of</HI> April <HI>that year, where it was decreed,</HI> That the So∣vereign being advertised of the Death of a Knight-Companion, the Knights-Companions remaining at Court should move him to declare his Pleasure whether h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would that Letters should be sent to all the Knights-Companions within the Realm to attend his Person for the Choice of a new Knight, at a Day by the said Sovereign appointed, according to the ancient Statutes of the Order, or be pleas'd to def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Election until the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> at what time Elections have been most usually made; and according as he resolv'd in what Place it should be, so it ought <HI>(by Letters directed to the Knights-Companions within the Realm)</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made known unto them.</P>
<P>This Deferring, or Prorogation of the Election, was no new thing, tho' not indulged by the Statutes, or de∣clared Law, before this 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. as is evident by the Letter of Summons sent after the Death of Sir <HI>Robert D'U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frevil,</HI> Knight Companion, <HI>temp. H.</HI> 4. wherein Notice
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
is taken of the Limitation given by the Statutes, af∣ter Certificate of Death, <HI>viz.</HI> Six Weeks, within the Space whereof a new Election was to commence; yet where a Chapter for Election could not conveniently be summo∣ned within that limited Time, it was sufficient if the Soveraign declared as he did in the said Placart and entered in the Black Book, <HI>That being then involved in other Business, he could not well attend this Affair, and there∣fore deferr'd the time for Election, unto the Eve of St.</HI> George <HI>next following.</HI></P>
<P>But of later Date, this formal Way of Summons by Letter, hath been discontinued, and only remained to such as are remote, and warned only by a verbal Message. For the Chancellor of the Order having consulted the Soveraign's Pleasure, as to the Day and Place, usually acquaints Garter therewith, who thereupon goes imme∣diately to the Knights Companions then at Court, and desires their Attendance at the Chapter, according to the Soveraign's Designation.</P>
<P>And here it is to be remarked, that no Knight Elect ought to be summoned to a Chapter of Election, or are rendered sufficient of giving their Votes therein, until they be compleatly installed, either in Person, or by Proxy. Nor indeed did any Necessity intervene, or re∣quire it till the late rebellious times, when the Castle of <HI>Windsor</HI> being Garrison'd by the Parliament's Forces, it was not possible for the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> to take Possession of their Stalls, as the Law of the Or∣der enjoined. Therefore the then Soveraign, whose Right it is, did, 17 <HI>Jan.</HI> 1644, dispense with their In∣stallations in St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel, for the present, and invested them with the Privileges of the Order, among which the Power of voting in Chapter, was one: Pro∣vided those Princes should first take the Oath given at Installations, and afterwards perform the accustomed Ceremonies, so soon as it should be thought convenient, and the Castle was restored to the Possession of his Ma∣jesty. In compliance to which Proviso they both then took the Oath, and on the Eve of the first F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast of St. <HI>George</HI> after the Restoration, the Duke was installed; and on the Eve of the second Feast, 15 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. by the
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
Earls of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Berk-shire;</HI> and the Prince by the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> and Earl of <HI>Linds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</HI></P>

<P>BUT for the most Part since the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the Sovereign's almost con∣stant Court and Abode, hath been the usual Place whereunto all the Knights Companions have been spe∣cially Summon'd, and peculiar Chapters assembl'd for Ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion in the Intervals between the Vacancy and St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast. However, while King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was in Exile, and wanted the compleat Number of Knights to constitute a full Chapter, he was necessitated not only to dispence with the Ceremony of Election in Chapter, but also in supplying the Defect of a Scrutiny, by making his own Election; yet after his Restoration, <HI>Whitehall</HI> recover'd her wonted Honour, and <HI>April</HI> the 1st. 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. at a Chapter call'd and held in the <HI>Bed-Chamber</HI> there, the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Lindsey, Man∣chester,</HI> and <HI>Strafford</HI> were elected.</P>

King of <HI>Scotland</HI> was elected into the Fellowship of this illustrious Order, but from that Time to the Rebellion, there occurs not any thing of this Nature; but the Wickedness of those Days created new Exigencies and Projections, which occasion'd, or rather inforc'd the Sovereign, King <HI>Charles</HI> I. most un∣willingly to awaken and rouse up this dormant Preroga∣tive, which he put in Execution at a Chapter purposely assembl'd for the Election of <HI>Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> held at the City of <HI>York</HI> the 12th of <HI>September,</HI> 16 <HI>Car.</HI> I. where at that Time and Place he dispenc'd with the Defect of Number of Six Knights-Companions, having then with him Four only, some of the rest being engag'd in his Service against the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>AFTERWARDS when several of the Knights-Compa∣nions so much adhered to the <HI>Long Parliament,</HI> that all Summons were ineffectual to draw them to their At∣tendance upon their Sovereign, tho' but to celebrate the Grand Festival of their Patron (much less to the com∣pleating Chapters of Election) to which they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obliged by the Oath taken at their Installment, the So∣vereign was constrain'd to extend further his Suprem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Authority; and thereupon at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> ce∣lebrated at <HI>York,</HI> the 18th, 19th and 20th of <HI>April, Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 18. <HI>Regnisui,</HI> in a Chapter held on the Eve of the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Feast by himself and but four other Knights Companions, It was Order'd, <HI>That Letters of Dispensation should be drawn up for the insufficient Number</HI> (as wanting Six Knights) <HI>to hold a Chapter of Election, and for Authorizing the Knights then present to deliver in their Votes according to Custom in other Scrutinies, that so the Sovereign might proceed to the Election design'd.</HI> By vertue of which Dispensation, the Duk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="232" REF="242"/>
of <HI>York</HI> and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> were elected Fellows of this noble Society.</P>
<P>THE like Dispensation was made at <HI>Oxford</HI> upon the 2d of <HI>March, Anno</HI> 20. <HI>Car.</HI> I. there being but five Knights-Companions present with the Sovereign; at which Chapter, <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and <HI>Bernard de Foix,</HI> Duke of <HI>Espernon,</HI> were elected.</P>
<P>LAST of all, in reference to the holding three several Chapters preparatory to the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> and grand Installation celebrated at <HI>Windsor</HI> the 15th, 16th, and 17th of <HI>April,</HI> 13. <HI>Car.</HI> II (one of which Chapters was held for the Election of Four Knights, and to de∣liberate with the surviving Knights-Companions) the Sovereign was pleas'd the 29th of <HI>March</HI> preceeding, to pass the like Dispensation under the Signet of the Orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and his own Sign Manual, for this defect; and thereby made those three Chapters as legal as if the Number of Knights-Companions had been compleat.</P>

<P>§. 5. WE are now arriv'd at opening the Chapter, whereinto neither the Sovereign, nor any of the Knights-Companions are to be admitted without the Ornament, both their Mantles and Garters, as the Statutes ordain, and the Law is still in force, tho' the Chapter hath been assembl'd elsewhere than at <HI>Windsor.</HI> As for instance, one call'd at <HI>Whitehall</HI> for the Election of <HI>John</HI> Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine, Anno</HI> 20. <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Earl of <HI>Hunting∣don,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wilton,</HI> not having their Mantles then at Court, were not permitted to enter in∣to the Chapter to give their Votes.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Charles</HI> I. determining to call a Chapter for electing the foresaid <HI>Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> at <HI>York,</HI> where neither he nor any of the Knights-Companions then attending his Person, had the Robes of the Order with them; and taking into his Royal Consideration, the Statutes now mention'd, did by his Authority, as Sovereign of the Order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dispence with those Knights then present for coming into the Chapter without their Mantles.</P>
<P>AFTERWARD<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon other Emergencies that ow'd their Origin to the late Rebellion, the Sovereign did the like in some subsequent Chapters held at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="243"/>
AFTER the Restoration, a Dispensation passed the Signet of the Order, dated the 10th of <HI>January,</HI> 12 <HI>Car.</HI> II. (the Great Seal being under the Hand of the Graver but not finish'd) He was necessitated to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use of his Supreme Authority for holding a Chapter the 14th of <HI>January</HI> following, in regard the Knights-Com∣panions then in being were not as yet provided of new Robes.</P>
<P>PRESUMING then, that a full Number of Knights, (in Obedience to their Summons) are attending their Sovereign habited in their Mantles and Garters, and entred into the Chapter-House at <HI>Windsor,</HI> or other Place appointed for this Assembly, the Sovereign having taken his Seat at the upper End of the Table, and given leave to the Knights-Companions to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, the Occasion of their being call'd together is first declar'd either by the Sovereign himself, or the Chancellor of the Order by his Command.</P>
<P>THE next thing in Course, is to exhibit to the Sove∣reign Information of all the vacant Stalls; and if the Sovereign chance to be in Foreign Parts, an Information ought to be transmitted to him by his Deputy or Lieu∣tenant; but if in <HI>England,</HI> and present in the Chapter, then to be presented him by the Chancellor, or in his Absence by the Register, or other Officer of the Order.</P>
<P>AFTER this they singly debate how the Place of the defunct Knight shall be supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd, and sometimes (where two or more Stalls are found void) whether they shall be all fill'd up at that time, or if not, how many Knights shall be elected <HI>pro hac vice.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when the Scrutiny is intended to be taken in the Choir of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel at <HI>Windsor,</HI> these or the like particulars (referring to Election) are commonly con∣sider'd of on the Feast-Day in the Chapter held imme∣diately before Vespers, wherein it is most usually order'd, That the Scrutiny shall be taken in the Chapel that fol∣lowing Afternoon. And so it was decreed on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, <HI>Anno</HI> 5. <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. <HI>viz. That the Elections of Knights should be taken that Even-song in the Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>THIS being effected, the Chancellor begins to col∣lect the Knights-Companions Votes, and this is fre∣quently term'd the taking the Scrutiny: For the ampler
<PB N="234" REF="244"/>
View of the Nature of which Action and Ceremony, we shall proceed to certain Considerationspreparatory there∣unto, beginning with what concerns the Nomination of the Persons to be proposed to the Election.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 6. AND first, That Knights-Companions only present in Chapter, have the sole Right inherent in themselves, to nominate and propose Persons to the Sovereign's E∣lection, consentaneous to the Bodies of the Statutes, that even from the Institution of this Most Noble Order, it hath not ever suffer'd any deviations.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of Remark, that <HI>Anno</HI> 26. <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> being Cel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brated at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and Lord <HI>Burleigh</HI> were seized with a Fit of the Gout, upon the Feast Day, which retarded them from Evening Prayer, whilst the Scrutiny was ta∣ken; whereupon we find their Indisposition of Body, and Absence, noted in that Scrutiny, where their Nomina∣tions should else have been set down, had they been pre∣sent. And upon the same Occasion was what <HI>Robert Cook,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Clarenceux,</HI> King at Arms, informs us, <HI>That as for those Knights Companions who happen to be absent</HI> when the Scrutiny is taken, altho' this Absence is <HI>occasioned</HI> by Ac∣cident of Sickness, or with the Soveraign's Licence, ne∣vertheless, <HI>in regard of this their Absence at that very time, their Votes may not be received.</HI></P>
<P>Those Knights Companions that come late to the Chapter, forfeit likewise the Privilege of giving their Votes for that time, which so happened to Prince <HI>Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> at the Chapter held for the Ele∣ction of <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in the Privy Cham∣ber at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> 29 <HI>Mar.</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>Altho' none of the absent Knights-Companions can give a Proxy to vote, or otherwise send their Suffrages into the Chapter or Chapel, there to pass in Nomination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet formerly, <HI>circa temp. H.</HI> 5. &amp; <HI>H.</HI> 6. when divers of the Knights Companions were frequently employed in the Wars of <HI>France,</HI> and consequently so fixed to their Commands, that they could not personally attend the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> it was usual for the Com∣mander there in Chief, with Consent of those Knights Companions, to make a formal Certificate, or Presentment
<PB N="235" REF="245"/>
(but not to pass it by way of Nomination or Vote, for that the Law of the Order did not permit) to the Soveraign, or his Lieutenant and Knights Companions assembled at the Feast, of such Persons famous for mar∣tial Valour and Virtue, with an Account of their gallant Acts and Atchievements, (attested by other Persons of Honour) as were at that time, and in that Kingdom, in the Sovereign's Service, and seemed worthy Candidates for the Honour of the Election, to the intent victorious and brave Persons might be preferr'd to so noble and sublime a Post; an Example whereof we find preserved by the Industrious and Learned <HI>Dugdale.</HI></P>

<P>BUT lest it may be suppos'd by some, that the Knights-Companions present in Chapter, can at their
<PB N="237" REF="247"/>
pleasures nominate or propose to elect such Persons as they deem meet, so they be qualify'd according to the Statutes, this Privilege is to be understood of Knights Subjects only: For in all Cases concerning Strangers, the Sovereign doth but barely grant them Sufferance, and may direct and confine the Knights-Companions to the Nomination of such as he at any time intends to Honour with Election, which Prerogative was particularly Asser∣ted, 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and 3 <HI>Car.</HI> I.</P>
<P>IN the First of these Instances, the <HI>Blue Book</HI> of the Order recordeth, That at a Chapter held immediately before Vespers on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, the Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> then Lieutenant for the Sovereign, made known to the Knights-Companions, <HI>That the Sovereign did permit them, or leave it to their Pleasure to chuse into the Order whatsoever Foreign Prince they should by their Votes approve of.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we have two Points that offer themselves to our Consideration. <HI>First,</HI> That the Knights-Companions have not the Liberty to nominate what Foreign Prince they please, but the same is derivative from the Sove∣reign, and only by his Permission. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To weigh the Paragraph well, that <HI>Nominare</HI> ought to be ren∣der'd or understood here by the Word <HI>Eligere,</HI> and that the Power delegated to the Knights-Companions from the Sovereign, was only to nominate, not elect; For it immediately follows, <HI>That the Knights-Companions went from the Chapter to the Second Vespers; and while the Divine Offices were celebrating, the Prelate receiv'd their Nominations, and that very Evening the Lieutenant presented them to the Sovereign for her to consider of;</HI> which had been insignifi∣cant and useless, if the Knights-Companions had been impower'd by her Licence to have made the Choice themselves. But the contrary is evident; for the next Morning, all the Knights-Companions attending the Sovereign in Chapter, she herself confirm'd there the Election not of any Foreign Prince, but of the Earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Buckhurst.</HI></P>
<P>IN the other Instance, <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Sovereign in a Chapter held before Vespers on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, sig∣nify'd it to be his Pleasure (Three Stalls being then vacant) that <HI>out of Foreign Princes, the Nomination of whom,</HI> (saith the Annals in that very Place) <HI>belongs only to the</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="248"/>
<HI>Sovereign,</HI> i. e. The Sovereign has the Prerogative to di∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct the Knights-Companions to name, or impose upon them the Nomination of such Foreign Prince he plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth they, the Knights-Companions, should pitch upon; which must undoubtedly be understood to Nominate, or enter down into the Scrutiny, (not elect) <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> For a little after, it is evident, when the Scrutiny was presented to the Sovereign, that himself, not the Knights-Companions, made Election of them.</P>
<P>AND it is further manifest, by the Scrutiny there in∣serted, that both those Princes were named by every of the Knights-Companions then present, according to the Sovereign's signification (which has been usually done at all other Times upon the like Occasions.) But concerning the third Person then to be Elected, the Sovereign, (intending him to be a Knight-Subject) left it entirely to their Pleasure to Nominate whomsoever they thought worthy of their Votes. Since this Time, the Nominations in like Cases, have been sufficiently acknowledg'd by the Knights-Companions themselves, to be a Prerogative belonging solely to the Sovereign. For to the End they might more expeditiously and clearly shew their Compliance, it was moved in a Chap∣ter held at <HI>Oxford, March</HI> the 2d. 19 <HI>Car.</HI> I. <HI>That it might become a Custom for the Sovereign to declare before-hand, whether he would<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elect any Foreign Prince, and whom, that so the Knights-Companions might be there to name him in the Scrutiny.</HI></P>

ANOTHER Consideration in our Progress towards the Act of Election, is appertaining to the Number<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Qualifications and Dignities of the Persons nominated, which may be more conspicuously resolved from another Branch of the before-mention'd Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That every one of the Knights-Companions present at the Election should nominate for himself nine very sufficient Persons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he should judge free from all Reproach and Scandal, whether Subjects to the Sovereign, or Fo∣reigners, Provided they are known not to Favour or Abet any Party at enmity with him; that is to say, three Earls, or others of higher Degree, three Barons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="239" REF="249"/>
and three Knights. Wherein the Things chiefly ob∣servable, we rank under five Heads.</P>
<P>For the First of these, their Number. Every Knight-Companion assembl'd in Chapter, is injoin'd to name Nine, neither more nor less. So also faith King <HI>Henry</HI> V's Statutes. Nor are King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's. any ways disso∣nant. And in this particular, the Statutes have been hitherto inviolably observed, except in one Case. As to Numbers, and the Mysteries wrapt up in them, we shall not further insist upon. But why our Royal Founder selected this particular Number above all other, unless he had some Eye, and tacit Reflection on the Nine Worthies, or a treble threefold Cord and Symbol of perfect Stability and solid Amity, the Number Nine is accounted to signifie, can with no great Facility or Certainty be decypher'd.</P>
<P>As to the Second Point, they ought to be of un∣spotted Character. The Injunction in the Statutes of Institution takes Order, that the Persons designed for Election, should be <HI>free from all Reproach, and of untaint∣ted Reputation;</HI> and according to those of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. are to be <HI>the best and most sufficient Knights, and freest from Reproach.</HI> To the same purpose the Exemplar in the Black-Book, <HI>Such as are fittest,</HI> and whom they who Nominate <HI>believe to be free from Ignominy and Dishonour.</HI> And to this Act of Nomination belongs part of the Second Article in <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Statutes, <HI>That no Knight-Companion should name any Person whom he thinks or esteems in his Conscience to have upon him any Spot of Reproach.</HI> But on the Contrary in another Place of the same Sta∣tutes it is Provided, That they be nominated and pro∣posed <HI>out of the Number of the most worthy and select Knights.</HI></P>
<P>How tender the Knights-Companions were in pri∣stine Times of infringing this particular, is proved from a notable Passage which happen'd <HI>Ann.</HI> 39 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. at a Scrutiny taken the 8th of <HI>February,</HI> in the Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Palace, where <HI>John de Foix</HI> Earl of <HI>Kendal,</HI> a <HI>Gas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oigner</HI> by birth, (which makes the Example more eminent, that a Stranger should have so great Regard to the Honour of the Order) not being acquainted with the Quality and Merit of Knights and Honourable Persons
<PB N="240" REF="250"/>
amongst us so well and demonstrably as to nomi∣nate such whom he was confident were irreprehensible, forbore to mention any Persons at all. And certainly, seeing the Statutes put very considerable Qualifications upon the Deputies and Proxies, made choice for the Installation of Strangers (as elsewhere shown) much more C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution and Regard ought to be used both in the Nomination and Election of Knights into this radiant and illustrious Society.</P>
<P>THE third Head the Statutes render indifferently capable of being nominated or elected, either Knights Subjects, or Strangers, [Free Princes or their Subjects.] And it was so even at the Election upon the first Choice, where among the Twenty five E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected Knights, Twenty three of them were Subjects. And this was the constant Custom not only in the remaining Part of the Founders Reign, and during those of his three Successors, but has continued ever since, as appears from the Scrutinies taken and entred throughout the Annals of the Order.</P>
<P>OF those who have gain'd admission into this Noble Order by Election, we shall in the last Chapter give an Account in a compleat Catalogue of them, and likewise insert the Names of such as have missed their Election, yet are not to be buried in Oblivion, out of this very re∣spect, that by their standing Candidates, have the Fame of being enrolled in the Principal Register of Honour now in the Christian World. It cannot be supposed we should give a List of all, (for that were a Task too laborious, and wou'd prove too numerous) but only of those of eminent Quality in foreign Parts, with the Aera when the Scrutinies were taken.</P>

<P>THOSE Persons were render'd incapable of Nomination who were known to Act in contrary Interest to the Sove∣reign; as the <HI>Exemplar</HI> in the <HI>Black-Book</HI> expresseth more copiously, <HI>Such as are not his Adversaries, or Abet∣tors, or willing Defenders of his Adversaries.</HI> Sometimes the Knights-Companions being more wary and discreet in Nominating them, to put either disrespect upon the Sovereign, or offer Violation to the Statutes.</P>
<P>IN the last Place, concerning the Degree, Rank and Dignity of the Nine Knights proposed to be Elected, the Statutes of the Institution set forth, That they be, <HI>First,</HI> Three<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Earls,</HI> or Persons of great Dignity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Three <HI>Barons.</HI> And, <HI>Third<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> Three <HI>Knights:</HI> Or, as it
<PB N="238" REF="252"/>
is in <HI>Henry</HI> V's Statutes, <HI>Trois Contes ou de greegnear estat, trois Baner ets, &amp; trois Batchelers.</HI> These Degrees are to be ranked in Three Classes, and they distinguish'd by Three Divisions, all including the Three Degrees aforesaid.</P>
<P>WHEREAS all other Bodies and Exemplars of the Statutes make positive mention of Earls only, yet the Statutes of <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. in this Point are more ample, by expressing the first Class, <HI>Dukes, Marquesses,</HI> and <HI>Earls,</HI> or <HI>Persons superior</HI> to these in Degree, wherein the highest Dignity is comprehended.</P>
<P>WE may observe the different Title, <HI>viz. Baner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> that <HI>Henry</HI> V's Statutes hath given us instead of <HI>Baron;</HI> and not only in this Article, but in all other where there is Occasion to treat of Barons; and yet the Re∣cord intends by it no other than the Person it mentions: For tho' a Banneret had its Denomination <HI>a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xillo,</HI> it usually signify'd a Degree of Honour next below a Ba∣ron, both in a later and a modern Date; yet formerly among our Records, it is expressedly Synonymous to Ba∣ron, as is sufficiently clear'd up by our most Learned <HI>Selden;</HI> and in this Sense is to be taken here, and not as a distinct Title of lower Degree, because we observe the Bannerets rank'd in all Scrutinies before King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> VIII. establish'd his Statutes (except one) with the Knights-Batchelors, not with Barons.</P>
<P>THE Title of the third and lowest Rank in this Classis in the Statutes of their Institution, are called <HI>Milites Bachalauri,</HI> and in those of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. <HI>Batche∣lors,</HI> and elsewhere <HI>Bachalauri &amp; Bachelauri Equites,</HI> which in common Acceptation are the same with <HI>Milites,</HI> tho' thus render'd to evince their difference from Knights-Bannerets, who are of a superior Degree of Honour. And here we may observe, that there is no Place in a Scrutiny for any under the Degree of a Knight-Batche∣lor. And tho' Three of the Nine mentioned are set down to be Barons, and Three other Earls, or of higher Degree, yet must these Six be such as have had confer∣red on them the Order of Knighthood, else their Names are rejected, and neither given or taken in Nomination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Words of the Statute expresly are, <HI>That each of the Knights assembl'd at the Election shall name nine Kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts.</HI></P>

<P>YET the Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mony of Knighting the Person designed to be elected, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not so strictly regarded, but some∣times this Branch of the Statute was either wholly pas∣sed, or else confounded with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cond Article through∣out the several Bodies of the Statutes, which prohibits the Choice or Election of any Person into the Society, as this doth the Proposal or Nomination. And there∣upon perhaps it was conceiv'd, that altho' the Nomina∣tion, Election, and sometimes Delivery of the Ensigns of the Order was first dispatch'd and past, yet it was sufficient if the Honour of Knighthood was conferr'd afterwards; as in the Cases of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Burleig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Anno</HI> 43. <HI>Eliz.</HI> where the Regi∣ster obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rves, That as soon as their Election was over, and they Usher'd into the Chapter, the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> (who it seems had not been Knighted before) was dub∣bed Knight with a drawn Sword, according to Custom, after which they had the Garter and George put on by the Sovereign her self.</P>
<P>IN like manner, <HI>Ulrick</HI> Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> immediately after their Election, (the last Day of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast, <HI>Ann.</HI> 3. <HI>Jac.</HI> I.) and before they receiv'd the Ensigns of the Order, had the Dignity of Knighthood conferr'd on them by the Sove∣reign; and in like manner the Earl of <HI>Sussex, Ann.</HI> 3 <HI>C.</HI> I. which the <HI>Red-Book</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Order recites, <HI>That as soon as it was und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rstood that the Earl had not receiv'd the Order of Knighthood befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Sovereign immediately drawing his Sword, Knighted him;</HI> which was not done till after his Election and Investiture with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the George and Garter.</P>
<P>THUS did the Ceremony of Knighthood succeed the Election of <HI>Charles</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> the 21st of <HI>May, Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. for after h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been elected, and in∣vested with the Ensigns of the Order by the two Senior
<PB N="240" REF="254"/>
Knights (the Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Surry)</HI> were intreated by the rest of the Knights-Companions, to present his Highness to the Sovereign in the Name of all the rest, to be initiated a Knight-Batchelor. He was conducted by the said Earls (his Supporters) into the Presence-Chamber in <HI>Windsor-Castle,</HI> where before the Chair of State, he most So∣lemnly receiv'd the Order of Knighthood from his Fa∣ther King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>TO Honour which Knighthood, and the Memory thereof, Four of the chief Nobility then present were Knighted, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earls of <HI>Essex, St. Alban</HI>'s and <HI>Elgin,</HI> and Viscount <HI>Grandison,</HI> being conducted from the Great Chamber to the Sovereign's State, each between two Batchelor-Knights.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS the Law in this Point began again to be more rightly understood; and by that Time <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> came to be elected (which was the 20th of <HI>April,</HI> 18 <HI>Car.</HI> I. at the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> celebrated at <HI>York)</HI> the Sovereign appointed, and accordingly con∣ferr'd Knighthood upon him the Day before, which he receiv'd upon his Knees, being conducted into the Pre∣sence-Chamber between two of the Nobility, who were also Knights, the Marquess of <HI>Hertford</HI> and Viscount <HI>Grandison.</HI> In Honour and Commemoration whereof, Four other Noblemen receiv'd the Honour of Knight∣hood at that time, the Earl of <HI>Carnarvan,</HI> the Lords <HI>George D' Aubignie, John Stewart,</HI> and <HI>Bernard Stewart,</HI> each supported by two Knights.</P>
<P>AND thus Prince <HI>Edward</HI> Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> being designed by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to be admitted into this Noble Order, were both first Knighted at St. <HI>Germains</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> 1649. and afterwards had the Ensigns of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Order sent unto them, by the Hands of Sir <HI>Edward Walker,</HI> Kt. Garter, who, in right of his Office, invested them therewith.</P>
<P>YET in the Case of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was elected with <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York, Ann.</HI> 18. <HI>Car.</HI> I. His want of Knighthood became no impediment, because he was a Prince in another Country, <HI>viz.</HI> Count <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and Duke of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avaria,</HI> and might therefore justly challen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a Privilege to come within the Rule of foreign Princes.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="255"/>
BUT the Sovereign, to arrive as near to the Intention and Observance of the Statute as he could, (where there was a possibility to do it, and the Honour would be well accepted by the Prince) thought it requisite by Commission under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> to im∣power <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Surry,</HI> and <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> both being then in <HI>Holland,</HI> or either of them, to Knight the said Prince before putting on the Garter (seeing it could not possibly be done before his Election) which was intended to be sent by him by the Hands of Sir <HI>John Burrough,</HI> Garter. But Death intervening, the Sovereign's Intention was frustrated; altho' the Prince, upon his coming afterwards into <HI>England,</HI> receiv'd both the Garter and the George from the Sovereign himself at <HI>Nottingham</HI> nevertheless without Knighthood, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o excuse, it may well be alledg'd, that the Sovereign might not recollect this Part of the Ceremony, it being a Time of so great Turmoil and Fatigue, occasion'd by the then setting up of his Standard.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, upon the 17th of <HI>January,</HI> 1644. when a Decree past in Chapter then assembl'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> That both the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and the Prince, should enjoy all Emoluments and Privileges of the Order, tho' they were not as yet Install'd (which Ceremony was to be compleated assoon as <HI>Windsor</HI> was out of the Power of the Rebels.) The Prince, before he receiv'd his Oath, was conducted by the Earl of <HI>Berk-shire</HI> and Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Lenox,</HI> unto the Sovereign, and had con∣ferr'd on him the Honour of Knighthood, there being at the same Time two of the Nobility Knighted in Me∣morial of that Solemnity, the Lord <HI>Henry Seymour,</HI> Se∣cond Son to the Marquess of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capell,</HI> conducted each between two Knights.</P>

<P>§. 8. WE are now come to speak of the Scrutiny it self, in reference to which, we shall consider by whom it ought, or hath been usually taken, and the Manner and Form thereof.</P>
<P>BY the Statutes of the Institution, the Collecting the Knights-Companions Votes, and entring them in the Scrutiny, solely appertains to the Prelate of the Order; and upon him is this Office devolved, not only by the
<PB N="242" REF="256"/>
other Bodies of the Statutes, but by the Constitutions of his Post, and the Obligation of his Oath, whose right we find duly asserted upon this Persons taking a Scruti∣ny, <HI>Anno</HI> 29 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>THE Statutes likewise provided, That if the Prelate was at any Time absent, then the Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> or the Register, or the Senior Residentiary of the College, or the Secretary, or Scribe of the Order, should under∣take the Employment; and elsewhere it is mention'd expressly, <HI>In the absence of the Prelate, whose particular Duty otherwise it was.</HI> And among the various Examples en∣roll'd in the Annals of the Order, these Examples a∣bundantly confirm it. The Prelate of the Order col∣lected the Suffrages from the Knights-Companions, <HI>An∣no</HI> 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. when <HI>John</HI> Earl-Marshal, and Four othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Knights were elected. The like did <HI>Henry Beaufort,</HI> Lord-Cardinal, Prelate of the Order, upon the Election of <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. And when the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI> was chose, <HI>Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the Prelate then also gather'd the Suffrages; which he likewise did upon the Feasts of St. <HI>George,</HI> Celebrated in the 12th, 13th, 14th, 27th, 28th, 30th, 31th, 34th and 35th Years of Queen <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zabeth</HI>'s Reign. Sometimes the Scru∣tinies have been gathered both by the Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and the Register of the Order jointly; as we find by the Election of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Talbot, Ann.</HI> 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. of Sir <HI>John Falstaff, Ann.</HI> 6 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. and the Duke of <HI>Quinbery, Ann.</HI> 5 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. all receiv'd at the Feasts of St. <HI>Georg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> celebrated at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>IT is more than a bare Conjecture, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Dean at those Times receiv'd the Votes from the Knights-Com∣panions on the Sovereign's side, while the Register col∣lected those on the Prince's; for 'tis observ'd, that in King <HI>Henry</HI> Vth's Reign, in Posts of different Nature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, one whereof was to signifie the Sovereign's Pleasure to the Knights-Companions about their paying due Reve∣rence, first to GOD, and afterwards to himself; and the other in a Ceremonia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which directs the Manner and Order of Mulcting the Knights-Companions; in both which, the Dean perform'd the Service on the right Hand the Choir (the Sovereign's side) and the Register on the left<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="257"/>
SOMETIMES the Register of the Order took them alone, as at the Election of <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel, Anno</HI> 10 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. and those of the Earl of <HI>Morteyn</HI> and Sir <HI>John Grey, Ann.</HI> 14 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. Moreover it's plain, that when the Office of Register was not fill'd, and <HI>Thomas Ruthall,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Duresme,</HI> executed it during its Va∣cancy, the Bishop himself, <HI>Ann.</HI> 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. collected the Suffrages. The like did <HI>William Day,</HI> Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> in the Absence of <HI>George Carew,</HI> Dean of the Chapel and Register of the Order, at the Feasts of St. <HI>George</HI> held at <HI>Whitehall, Anno</HI> 18 and 19 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Duty was executed by the Register from the 15th Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the Period of his and his Son's Reign, as the <HI>Black-Book</HI> of the Order fully evinces; as also on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1. <HI>Eliz.</HI> by <HI>John Boxhall;</HI> and at the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> held <HI>Ann.</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. by <HI>Giles Thompson,</HI> who in the several Times were Registers, yet we must not mistake that what they officiated was on their own behalf, but supply'd the Place of the Prelate.</P>
<P>IN the Beginning of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, we find the Chancellor of the Order began to perform this Ser∣vice, being by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Statutes adjoined to those other Offices before describ'd, to collect the Scru∣tinies in absence of the Prelate, and thereby made ca∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble of the Employment, which afterwards is tacitly remark'd to be perform'd as if in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own right, when the Register has only effected it in the Chancellor's ab∣sence, tho' in reality it was no other, than as in the Instance of the Bishop of <HI>Duresme</HI> and Dr. <HI>Day</HI> aforesaid, who took the Scrutiny in the Vacancy of the Office, and absence of the Register.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Register in the Absence of the Chan∣cellor (who was sick,) upon the Feast Day of St. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orge,</HI> collected the Suffrages. And <HI>Ann.</HI> 8. <HI>Eliz. G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orge Carew,</HI> then Register of the Order, <HI>took the Votes of the Knights-Companions in absence of Sir</HI> William Petre, <HI>Chancellor of the Order.</HI> So also <HI>Ann.</HI> 4. <HI>Jac.</HI> I. where the Cause of the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncellor's Absence is noted to be Sickness, and <HI>Ann.</HI> 6. <HI>Jac.</HI> I. to be Death.</P>
<P>IN the first of these Instances, we find the Prelate ex∣pressly set down to be there; in the two following, his
<PB N="244" REF="258"/>
presence is implyed, for it is said, that the FourOfficers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Order did attend both Feasts, whereof, (the Chan∣cellor being wanting) the Prelate must needs be one.</P>
<P>NOW all these Passages seem to relate to the Right of the Chancellors rather than the Prelates by this Re∣mark, That every of the Scrutinies were taken in the Absence of the Chancellor, which looks something like a cautionary Remark that denoted the Right of Execu∣ing this Office to the Chancellor, rather than the Prelate.</P>
<P>WHEN a Deputy-Chancellor hath been admitted to Officiate in the Chancellor's absence, he, and not the Prelate, hath taken the Scrutiny, (tho' present) as at the Election of <HI>Charles</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. and at another taken the 22d of <HI>May</HI> following, and the same when the Suffrages were col∣lected for the Election of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at <HI>York, Anno</HI> 17 <HI>Car.</HI> I.</P>
<P>BUT there is one Passage more (upon taking a Scru∣tiny <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.) which seems Advantageous to the Chancellor in this Point, where it is said, <HI>That when the Knights-Companions had given their Votes</HI> (as say the <HI>An∣nals) THE CHANCELLOR WHO, ACCORDING TO HIS OFFICE, was to receive them, presented them to the Sovereign.</HI> Howbeit, in truth there is no sufficient Foundation for the Register to insert this as done by the Chancellor, <HI>by Virtue of his Office,</HI> or any one Act or Chapter that hath suspended or made void, the Right of the Prelate, which is reserved by him, even by the Patent, for erect∣ing the Office of Chancellor; especially in those Af∣fairs, which, respecting the Order, ought by the Statute of the Institution to appertain to him. But since the stated Time of performing this Ceremony in the Cha∣pel, the Prelate (if present) is presumed to be Offici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing at the Altar, in discharge of another part of his Duty, upon this consideration hath the Service been then imposed upon the Chancellor, and others.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> WE find the Scrutiny to be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce taken by Garter, <HI>Ann.</HI> 16. <HI>Car.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Election of <HI>Thomas</HI> Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of <HI>Strafford.</HI> But this was at a Time, when not only the Prelate, but all the other Officers of the Order, ex∣cepting Sir <HI>John Burrough,</HI> Garter, were absent, and co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sequently
<PB N="245" REF="259"/>
this Service so executed, ought rather to be judged to have been done in the Prelate's than Chancel∣lor's Right.</P>

<P>§. 9. BUT whosoever gather'd the Suffrages, the Time when they enter'd upon this Duty (in the Inter∣vals of Feasts, where the Occasion requir'd a peculiar Chapter for an Election) was usually after the Chapter had been open'd, and the Matter of Election proposed by the Sovereign; after which he proceeded with all possible Reverence and Respect.</P>
<P>HOWBEIT upon an extraordinary Occasion (in the Interval of the Grand Feasts) the Sovereign hath some∣times called an Assembly of the Knights, Companions, to be convened at the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> who in the Choire of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel (not Chapter-House) after the more solemn Manner, have deliver'd in their No∣minations, and returning thence into the Chapter-House, he there continu'd the Election. Thus did King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> VIII. upon the 7th of <HI>June</HI> in the 17th Year of his Reign, in reference to the Election of the Lord <HI>Henry Fitz Roy,</HI> (so stil'd in the Scrutiny, and rank'd among the Barons; for as yet he was not created Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> and <HI>Richmond)</HI> and <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmorland.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 20th of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. being <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> the Sovereign caus'd a Chapter to be held that Afternoon in the Chapter-House at <HI>Windsor,</HI> for the Nomination and Election of <HI>Charles</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> at the Breaking up whereof, the Sove∣reign and Knights-Companions proceeded immediately to St. <HI>Georges</HI>'s Chapel, where at Evening-Prayer, (which was not within the Compass of the Feast, for that began not 'till next Day) the Scrutiny was taken.</P>
<P>AND besides those Examples which shew the No∣minations have been collected (upon peculiar Occasions) in the Choire at <HI>Windsor,</HI> there are one or two Instances they have been also taken in the Chapel at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> as on the 15th of <HI>May, Ann.</HI> 1 <HI>Car.</HI> I. at the Choice of <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Dors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> Viscount <HI>Andover,</HI> as on the 4th of <HI>July</HI> the same Year, whereat the Duke of <HI>Chevereux</HI> was pitch'd upon.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="260"/>
THE Suffrages have commonly been collected at the Second Vespers, or in the Time of Evening-Prayer on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, or on that Day whereon the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> hath been celebrated by Prorogation; and with this Distinction of Time, the taking of divers Scru∣tinies are mark'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER there occurs one Scrutiny gather'd in the Chapter-House at <HI>Windsor</HI> on the Eve of the Grand-Feast, at which the person immediately elected, was sent for in, and had the Ensigns of the Order conferr'd upon him, when immediately the Sovereign made his Progression to the Chapel, and after some small Interval, the Elect proceeded to his Installation. And this was the Case of <HI>James</HI> Marquess <HI>Hamilton, Ann.</HI> 6 <HI>Car.</HI> I. who lying under an Obligation to commence his Voy∣age next Morning towards <HI>Germany</HI> (whither he had the Commission of General of 6000 Foot in Assistance of the King of <HI>Sweden)</HI> occasion'd this his Sovereign's Indulgence, and quick dispatch.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scrutiny first began to be collected in the Chapel, is treated of somewhat general and indefinite. <HI>Ann.</HI> 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 <HI>Eliz.</HI> it was during the time of <HI>Evening-Prayer.</HI> And in like manner, <HI>Ann.</HI> 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. And when the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> was solem∣niz'd at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the <HI>An∣nals</HI> say, <HI>That the Sovereign recreated himself with the Melody of Evensong, during which the Chancellor collected the Votes of the Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BUT in some other Places, the Time when this Matter was transacted is restricted to a precise Time, or some particular Part of Evening Prayer, as</HI> Anno <HI>26 and 27 Eliz.</HI> whilst the Choire sung the Service, <HI>and the like</HI> Anno <HI>14</HI> Jac. <HI>I. but 4</HI> Car. <HI>I.</HI> while the Anthem was sung after the second Lesson, <HI>but more frequently after the first Lesson, as in the 2 and 9</HI> Car. <HI>I.</HI> while the Anthem was sing∣ing, <HI>or whilst they were hymning the Anthem of the blessed</HI> Virgin called the Magnificat, <HI>and which is all one with that,</HI> Anno <HI>14</HI> Car. <HI>I. viz.</HI> assoon as the first Lesson was read, <HI>or</HI> at the first Lesson, <HI>which is remembred to be</HI> the usual Part of the Service, in which the nomination ought to begin.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">

<P>§. 10. THE manner of the Order the Knight-Compa∣nions Votes ought to be collected when the <HI>Scrutiny is tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in the Choir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> when the Register informs us, upon the Celebration of St. <HI>Georges</HI>'s Feast at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> 28 <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> VIII. as entred into the Black Book; <Q>That he used his Diligence in going to and fro from one Side to the other, to demand and redemand the Suffrages from the Knights-Companions, according to the Variety and Disposition of their Stalls,</Q> which same Me∣thods <HI>in eisdem terminis</HI> the Chancellor observed, <HI>Anno</HI> 24 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and without question was generally performed at other Seasons, for the annals describe it to be per∣form'd <HI>de more</HI> 5 Eliz. or <HI>juxta Ordines Constitutionis</HI> Anno 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the Officer who collects the Scrutiny, is obliged to begin at the youngest Knight-Companion, and so proceed upward towards the Eldest, is evident from the Order mentioned to be in Vogue, <HI>An.</HI> 2 and 20 <HI>Eliz.</HI> as also 15 <HI>Car.</HI> I. But to give a more particular Account of this Ceremony, as it stood <HI>temp. Car.</HI> I. and doubt∣les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long before, tho' not Recorded <HI>in Script<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> is as fol∣lows.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THE Officer arose and went into the Middle of the Choire; directly over against his own Seat, he made two Reverences, first towards the high Altar, and next to the Sovereign, then he proceeded up to the Choire near the <HI>hault pace</HI> against the Stall of the junior Knight-Companion, and there made like Reverence; this done he went up to the Stall of the said junior Knight, and with a singular Reverence to him, only de∣manded whom he pleased to nominate, which having taken, (making to him a second Reverence,) he descend∣ed into the Choire, and thence passed to the next senior Knight on the other Side, (unless by reason of the va∣cancy of the Stall he Sits on the same Side with the juni∣or) and having received his nomination from the second Knight-Companion, he again crossed the Choire to the Third, and in like mannner he ascended according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Seniority of the Knights-Companions present, (al∣ways crossing the Choire where there was occasion) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntil he arrived at the senior Kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht-Companion; and
<PB N="248" REF="262"/>
having thus received all their Nominations, he returned into the Middle of the Choire, and after accustomed Reverences, took his Seat.</P>
<P>THIS Method in collecting the Votes as to the general, and in the Choire, ought likewise to be observed when they are taken from the Knights-Companions in Chap∣ter, they being ranked in due order on either Side of the Table, according to the Seniority of their Elections and situations of Stalls in the Choire; the Officer be∣ginning with the junior and thence gradually ascending to the senior Knight.</P>
<P>AND that we may rightly apprehend after what form every Knight-Companion Ranketh the Names of those Persons he proposeth, and how each Classis is distinguish∣ed and divided, the following Scrutiny will manifest which was taken off, <HI>May, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. upon the Vacancy of one Stall hapning by the death of Sir <HI>Henry Tanke Clux</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> and the first Scrutiny found Mar∣shalled among the Annals of this most noble Order.</P>

<P>IN the first Column each Knight-Companion hath his own Name per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt to those Persons for whom he conde∣scends his Vote, to the intent it may appear by whom the Knights candidates are nominated, and these are Ranked in three several Divisions.</P>
<P>THE first contains, The Degrees of Earls, Mar∣quesses, Dukes, Princes, Kings and Emperors; yet at a Scrutiny taken <HI>Anno</HI> 24 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. in a Chapter held at <HI>Brainford, Albro Vasquez d'almadea,</HI> (who immediately fol∣lowing, is Stiled <HI>Comes Averentiae)</HI> is by a mistake Rank∣ed; but in the second Division among the Barons, and twice among the Knights Votes of the Marquess of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> but this Error perhaps owes its original for want of due knowledge, either of the Law in the Statutes or his Degree, the latter of which is the most feasible to conjecture; for being a Stranger, his Title might not be so generally divulged, nor is it taken notice of in the Scrutiny it self, tho' in the annals immediately after it was rectified.</P>
<P>AND to shew the probability of this Point, the Earls of <HI>Oxford, Devonshire,</HI> and <HI>Arundel,</HI> (whose degrees were sufficiently known) at a Scrutiny taken <HI>Anno</HI> 24 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. are ranked in the second Division among the Barons, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. the Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> is three Times so placed, and again 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the Earl of <HI>Devonshire</HI> twice; but this happened not thro oversight or neglect of the Statutes, but because at these Nominations wherein they are so Ranked, the first Division to which they appertained, happened to be fill'd up with those other higher Dignities belonging to the same Class, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="250" REF="264"/>
Kings or Dukes, as when the beforementioned Earls of <HI>Oxford, Devonshire,</HI> and <HI>Arundel,</HI> were set down in the Place of Barons; the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> were put in the Class of Princes, and so it happened in many other instances.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, <HI>Anno</HI> 15 and 16 <HI>Eliz.</HI> IV. the Lord <HI>Rich. Grey</HI> one of the Queen's Sons, by her former Hus∣band, Sir <HI>John Grey</HI> of <HI>Groby</HI> Knight; in respect of his Alliance to the Royal Family, is Ranked in the first Di∣vision among the Princes, under the Title <HI>Dominus Richardus filius Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nae,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Anno</HI> 19 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. set only among the Barons, as well with the former Title as this <HI>Richardus Dominus Grey,</HI> but <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. he is thrice register'd among the Princes, and as often with the Barons, whence it is observable that to be Enrolled in the Rank of Princes, may be afforded of courtesie to Persons of high Eminency and Blood; but then as they can lay no claim to it by their Merit, so such of the Knights-Companions as Rank them lower, suffer no diminution in their Honour.</P>
<P>WHEREIN the second Division are Ranked the Barons and Viscounts, for Viscounts in all Scrutinies, after the first Erection of that Dignity, were on the same level with the Barons, until the 3 of <HI>Jac.</HI> I. (excepting only <HI>John Dudley</HI> Viscount <HI>Lisle, Anno</HI> 35 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. who by every Knight, the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> excepted, is Ranked in the first Division of Princes) and in a Scru∣tiny then taken, <HI>Robt. Cecil</HI> Viscount <HI>Craneborne</HI> is the se∣cond Viscount in the List that has been Ranked with Princes, whence it became the frequent Practice in succeeding Scrutinies, until <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. And then (upon a Question put in Chapter convened at <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI> 23 <HI>May</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I.) whether Earls Sons and Viscounts were eligible with Barons, it passed in the affirmative, and that by general usage except in the two cases just mentioned; and about the same time we find it reiterat∣ed near that Time, for in two Scrutinies taken the 19th and 21st of that Instant <HI>May,</HI> the Viscounts are therein reduced to the second Division, and Ranked with the Barons.</P>
<P>THE Knights-Batchelors and Bannerets held the same
<PB N="251" REF="265"/>
Rank in King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Statutes, in all Scrutinies with Barons.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the word in King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIth's late Sta∣tutes is <HI>Baronettus</HI> instead of <HI>Banerettus,</HI> yet is this fre∣quently obvious in some ancient Books and Records, as well as in those ancient Writers, long before the Title of Baronet was conceived or brought into use.</P>
<P>IN the last place he who demands those Suffrages) the Knights-Companions present) is by the Statutes of In∣stitution to receive them in writing; for in a Scrutiny taken <HI>Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. at the Election of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Talbote</HI> and <HI>Turnival,</HI> the Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and the Register of the Order, <HI>wrote down the Votes and Nomina∣tions of every singular Knight present at the Day of Election.</HI></P>
<P>AND at another Scrutiny <HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. to fill up that which by an Error in the Black Book is set down Sir <HI>Henry Fitzhugh,</HI> 'tis inserted, <HI>That the Dean and Regi∣ster wrote down in Order,</HI> (according to their Seniority) <HI>the Votes of the Knights-Companions.</HI> And after the Scrutinies began to be entred in the Annals, it is evident the general Practice kept pace with the Injunction of the Statutes; only there are two instances of an Election confirmed without taking a Scrutiny in writing, one in the case of the Princes <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Christiern</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the Knights-Companions in a Chapter convened at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> 14 of <HI>July</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. gavein their Votes <HI>viva voce,</HI> and immediately the Sovereign admitted them both into the Illustrious Society; the other was the Case of <HI>James</HI> Marquis <HI>Hami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton,</HI> Elected the 2d of <HI>Feb.</HI> 20 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. with the vocal consent of all the Knights-Companions.</P>
<P>IT is worthy observation, that this Method, and the omission of taking the Scrutiny in writing, is not on∣ly contrary to the Law of the Order expressly set down for a more stable consignation of the Action, and more faithful transmission of it to Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terity, but exceeding prejudicial to Persons of Honour, and Distinction, whose Names would otherwise survive with great veneration among the candidates of this Illustrious Order, and of which Honour many deserving Persons will be hereaf∣ter deprived, if the Injunctions of the Statutes be not observed in this particular respect.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. The Presentation of it to the Sovereign.</HEAD>
<P>THE Knights-Companions, having delivered their Suffrages, the Officer by whom they are Collected, humbly presents to the Sovereign the Nominations, for so it is recorded the Prelate of the Order acted in the 9th of <HI>Hen.</HI> the Vth. If these Votes were taken in Chapter, the Paper usually was immediately presented to the Sovereign who made his Election, before the Chapter broke up; but if gathered in the Chapel, tho' it was given to the Sovereign, yet the choice was not made then, but the Morning after, and this was the manner in the 2d and 5th Years of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> Ano∣ther time it hath not been presented till the Vespers were finished, but in the Practice of latter Days the Scrutiny hath not been given up to the Sovereign till the next Day at the opening of the Chapel before Morn∣ing-Prayer, as in the 13, 15, 20, 30 Years of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> demonstrates, and was the accustomed Practice of the 17th Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the first of ever sacred Me∣mory; the last presentation was transcribed in a little Book, and with all due Reverence offered upon the Knee, before any other Affair was transacted in the Chapter.</P>
<P>THIS has been the general Use as we are ascertain'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and the Register of the Order, having Collected the Vote of every Knight, they were immediately given into the Hands of the Sovereign's Deputy; and in the same nature were they presented on the 4th <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. when <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI> was Lieutenant, in the 20th of Queen <HI>Eliz.;</HI> when the Suffrages were Collected by Sir <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Walsingham</HI> the Chancellor, he gave them up to the Earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> then Lieutenant to the Sovereign.</P>
<P>BUT it's evident from several Passages in the Blue Book of the Order, that the Lieutenant afterward de∣livered them to the Sovereign, as is apparent from the Records of the 30th, 34th, 38th, and the 40th Year of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>

In the 12th Year of K. <HI>James</HI> I. some Exceptions arose upon the Chancellor's not presenting the Scrutiny to the Prince, (who at that time was the Sovereign's Lieute∣nant) but to the Sovereign himself, which was an Error he fell into, as well as some of his Predecessor's; as the 2d, 3d, and 25th of <HI>Eliz.</HI> demonstrate.</P>
<P>The Sovereign's Considerations upon the Qualifications of those to be elected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 12. As the Knights-Companions are under an Obli∣gation, by the Statutes, to nominate no Person, but who can bear the Test of the afore-mention'd Qualifications, there's a Standard of Honour provided for the Sovereign, to measure the Extraction, Quality, and Merit of the Per∣son proposed to be elected, least it might chance, thro' the Indulgence of the Sovereign, this Fountain of Honour might be mudded by the Choice of inferior and undeser∣ving Persons, for the Statutes run—because this <HI>Order consists of Goodness, and honourable Virtue, doth not admit Unworthiness and Villany,</HI> and so by Consequence secludes all Persons of mean Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raction and Merit.</P>
<P>The Qualifications for <HI>Election</HI> are exhibited in the 2d Article, as in the 18th are included those of <HI>Nomination:</HI> The Words of the <HI>Institution</HI> are, <HI>That none shall be ele∣cted into the Order;</HI> and refer only to the Act of Election: For if we consult the rest of the Statutes, and compare them with this Passage, they run according to this Te∣nor. <HI>That none shall be elected and chosen a Companion of this Order.</HI> These refer more principally to the Time of the Election<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and not to the <HI>Investiture</HI> with <HI>Garter,</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> and <HI>Installation,</HI> from the Expressions of <HI>admitting</HI> and <HI>receiving</HI> Knights into this <HI>Order,</HI> as the <HI>Examplars</HI> of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of <HI>Institution</HI> set forth. And this is farther illustrated, from another Passage in the 2d Article of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII's Statutes, where the Word <HI>Reproach</HI> is menti∣oned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith. <HI>The Guilt thereof so incapacitates a Man's Ele∣ction, that for the future it's a Bar, and utterly disqualifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im for that Honour.</HI></P>
<P>There are Two Points requisite for <HI>Qualifications and Endowments;</HI> first, to be a <HI>Gentleman of Blood;</HI> and, 2dly, a <HI>Knight</HI> without <HI>Reproach.</HI> By the Statutes of <HI>Henry</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Institutions,</HI> no Man ought to be elected, <HI>unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>
<PB N="258" REF="268"/>
<HI>be a Gentleman born.</HI> The <HI>Examplar</HI> in the <HI>Black Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> saith, <HI>Unless he be worthy upon the Account of Birth and Arms:</HI> And in another Passage, <HI>That he be one eminent for his Demeanour and good Report;</HI> which intimates the Conjunction of Blood and Virtue, which make up the noblest Composition. The Statutes of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. are more extensive than those, and say, <HI>He must be a Gen∣tleman by Name, Arms, and Blood;</HI> and least this Character might seem intricate and perplex'd, <HI>A Gentleman of Blood</HI> is defin'd to be, <HI>One descended of three Descents of Nobles,</HI> viz. <HI>of Name and Arms, both by his Father and Mo∣ther's side.</HI></P>
<P>It's certain <HI>Gentility</HI> does not receive its Perfection in the Person it was first devolv'd on, but is rather compleat∣ed by Succession: For, among the <HI>Romans,</HI> tho' the Fa∣ther was Free-born, and of the <HI>Equestrian Cense;</HI> yet it was farther requisite, that the Grand-father should be the same, or else they could not obtain the Ring, one of the <HI>Symbols</HI> of the <HI>Equestrian Order,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> informs us. <HI>Gen∣tility</HI> hath its beginning in the Grand-father, its increase in the Father, and full ripeness in the Son; and conse∣quently in the Constitution of <HI>Gentility,</HI> the Father and Grand-father conveying a Lustre to the Son, make it entire and compleat; for its incongruous to suppose a ripeness in the Son, unless there had been a former en∣crease in the Father, and a longer Series from the Grand∣father.</P>
<P>The memorable Instance of the Lord <HI>William Paget,</HI> who was divested of the <HI>Garter</HI> five Years after his Ele∣ction, upon Pretence of his not being a Gentleman of Blood by either Father or Mother, proceeded not wholly from the defect in Point of Extraction, as <HI>Haward</HI> re∣lates, but rather from the Prevalence and Practice of <HI>John Dudley,</HI> Duke of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rthumberland,</HI> by whose means he was most unjustly deprived of the <HI>Garter;</HI> repenting, perhaps, at the great Honours he had done this Lord, by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Character of him to King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. when he procured him a new Grant of those Arms, under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> when he was <HI>Earl Marshal,</HI> which he had some time before received from the Garter Principal King of Arms.</P>
<P>But, admit the defect of <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> for three D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣cents, were the true Cause of the recal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>

that it might be conferred upon the Earl of <HI>Warwick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> el∣dest Son of the said Duke, who, out of courtesie, is called so, in which Relation both <HI>Haward</HI> and <HI>Stow</HI> have mista∣ken, for they were bestowed upon Sir <HI>Andrew Dudley,</HI> Brother to the Duke; for tho' he was put in the Scrutiny enter'd among the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in the Sixth Year of his Reign, upon S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, yet was the Earl neither then, nor at any other time, elected.</P>
<P>The Ensigns of this most Noble Order, as soon as Queen <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> ascended the Throne, were with as much Honour restored to the Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> and with as great and absolute an Authority, as they were disgracefully taken from him. And in Confirmation of this Lord's Restaura∣tion, he had the <HI>Garter</HI> buckled on his Leg, and the <HI>Col∣lar</HI> and the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der</HI> put about his Shoulders, with the <HI>George</HI> depending, by two of the Knights-Companions present; and the Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er King at Arms was order'd, That he should take Care his <HI>Atchievements</HI> should be replaced over his <HI>Stall</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> which is the 9th on the Sovereign's side. It is observable, that the very Records of the Order brand his Degradation as Injustice; as if it were infera∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, That when Honour is conferred, upon the Account of Virtue and exquisite Endowments, the Consideration of these supplies the defect and obscurity of Extraction. The Sovereign, whose Prerogative it was to declare and interpret the Statutes, being present in Chapter, thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to qualifie the Law, and gave him this honourable Commendation, <HI>That he had highly deserved of the Nation, by his Prudence and Counsel.</HI></P>
<P>And though there's only inserted in the <HI>Examplar</HI> of the <HI>Black Book, Virtue</HI> and <HI>good Report</HI> for a Qualification, yet the same was observed by the Sovereigns and Lieute∣nants in foregoing Time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with great Circumspection; and that the <HI>Magnanimity, Fortitude, Prudence, Generosity, Fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Reputation,</HI> and other Virtues and Excellencies, whet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er innate or acquired, of the Person proposed to Election, have by prudent Inquisition been inspected, and brought to the To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chstone, before they have been admitted into so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oble and illustrious a Body.</P>
<P>Those Qualities were chiefly consider'd and esteemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>Henry</HI> V. for which Reason, at an Election in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Year of his Reign, he gave the Preference, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nominated and presented unto him, to

<P><HI>Humphry,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> Deputy to K. <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od in the same Steps, and did weigh, by the strict Rules of Fortitude and Prudence, the gallant and noble Actions and Deserts of <HI>John<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Lord <HI>Talb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> before the Electio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and gave in an Appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation worthy of his own Judgment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that Candidate's Merit.

<P>The 2d Point to treat on is, That no one is qualified for Election, unless he be a <HI>Knight;</HI> or as it is expressed in one of the <HI>Examplars</HI> in the <HI>Hatton Library, Unless girded with the unstained Girdle of Knighthood;</HI> so singular a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egard the Law of the Order ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to this particular Qua∣lification above the rest: And least Chance or Inadverten∣cy might let slip a Person not Knighted into the Scrutiny, were the Words inserted <HI>ut minimum,</HI> that he be at least a <HI>Knight</HI> before he be elected, when the Sovereign come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to make his Choice.

it was ordained, That if a Knight-Companion should hap∣pen to be reta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned in the Service of a Foreign Prince, to take up Arms in his Quarrel; and after his Adversary desired to entertain another <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> on his Side also; he that was last invited, was bound to wave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Offer, and in no wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to give his Consent. And upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the <HI>Knight-Companions</HI> were obliged to make special Pre∣cautions in that their Engagements; that if any of his Fellows were retained on the other Side, and that if he knew not that another of his <HI>Fellows</HI> had been engaged with the Adversary, so soon as it came to his Know∣lege, he was obliged to relinquish the Service he before had undertaken.</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these three Points of <HI>Reproach</HI> we have set down, we find in a Manuscript, that belonged to <HI>Heny G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey,</HI> third Muqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> a four<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h added to these other three <HI>Points</HI> of <HI>Reproach;</HI> in these Words:</P>
<P>That if any Knight of the Order, from henceforth, by Prodigality or Riot, wilfully or negligently, Dispend, Sell, Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens, or do away his Patrimony or Livelihood, by rea∣son whereof, he shall not be able Honoura∣bly to maintain himself, and his Estate, in such H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nourable Manner, as may Conserve the Honour of the said Order, and of him∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf; in this Case he shall be Summoned by the Usher of Arms of the Order, called the black Rod, by Commandment of the <HI>Soveraign,</HI> his <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> or <HI>Deputy;</HI> to ap∣pear before his Majesty, or his Commissi∣oners, and the Knights of the Order, at the next <HI>Chapter</HI> ensuing; there to be examin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d before the Soveraign, or his said Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sioners, and the Knights and Companions of the said Order; and if he be found in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch great default of <HI>Prodigality, insolent Riot, or wilf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Negligence;</HI> that then the Sov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣raign, with the advice of the Company of

the said Order, may deprive and degrade him of the said Order, at the said Chapter, if it be their Pleasure.</P>
<P>Though this fourth Point is not inserted into King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, yet the Substance thereof seems to be approved of before; for we find among some <HI>Orders,</HI> prepared by the Marquiss of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and other Knights-Companions, at a Chapter at <HI>Windsor,</HI> the twenty fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h and twenty sixth Days of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. one of them was something to this Purpose.</P>

<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 13. Amongst the Number of these Candidates, the Sovereign is chiefly to regard those who have <HI>most Voices,</HI> or whom he conceives most requisite to contribute to the <HI>Honour of the Garter,</HI> and most Beneficial to himself, and of most Advantage to his Crown and Kingdom. We find the Law hath not always reserved the greatest Num∣ber of Voices, as will appear from the Annals; yet it has sometimes confirmed the Election, as in the Case of the Duke of <HI>Queenberry An.</HI> 5 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. where, after a due and sufficient Examination taken of the <HI>Scrutiny,</HI> the Duke, by the consent of most Voices, was E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected into the Stall of <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Exeter;</HI> and so was the Election of Sir <HI>Nicholas Carew,</HI> the twenty fourth of <HI>April,</HI> in the 28 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in a singular Instance, that when two Knights had on either Side equal <HI>Voices;</HI> which was the Case of Sir <HI>John Fastolf,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Radcliff;</HI> the first being esteemed more Worthy, by the Sovereign's Lieu∣tenant, obtained the Election.</P>
<P>The second Inducement relates to such as, in all Ap∣pearance, may bring most Renown to the <HI>Order,</HI> and ad∣vance it to a higher pitch of Greatness; and these have in a great Measure been effected, by enrolling Foreign Princes into this <HI>illustrious Society,</HI> whose Valour and great Merit have proclaimed them deserving both of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mination and Election.</HI> And upon this Consideration, K. <HI>Clarles</HI> I. of blessed Memory, <HI>upon Consideration had of the glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Atchievements, and high Renown, of</HI> Gustavus Adolphus <HI>King of</HI> Sweden; <HI>judged it a Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of his Re∣spect, not only to render him all Offices of Kindness and</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="276"/>
<HI>Friendship, as to a Prince nearly allied, and his most special Friend; but also to impart to him, as far as in him lay, the greatest and highest Honour that might be, and especially such, wherewith the military Virtue of so great a Captain was wont to be adorned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the principal Motive thought requisite to Elect Foreign Princes into this Society of Honour, hath been expressed in the</HI> Commissions <HI>of</HI> Legations, to be in Respect of their glorious Merits, ennobled by the lustre and grace of their Heroick Virtues, their eminent Nobleness, Grandeur, Prowess, and Magnificence; the renown of which, Fame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad divulged and spread Abroad throughout the World.</P>
<P>Where the Advantage of the Sovereign's Service was thrown into the Ballance, no Consideration could outvie its Pretensions, as in 2 <HI>H.</HI> 6. justifies; whose eminent Service for his King and Country, was the sole Motive that crowned his Election: And the great Zeal and Af∣fection, which <HI>John Jaspar Ferdinand de Marchin</HI> shewed for the Cau7s;e and Service, and the recovery of the just Rights of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was the strongest Inducement that swayed that Sovereign to chuse him, in the tenth Year of his Reign, a Knight-Companion of this most no∣ble Order. But the last inducement is of the greatest La∣titude, for the <HI>Sovereign</HI> has a Power to reject whosoever he pleases, though they do exceed in multiplicity of <HI>Voices,</HI> and in other <HI>Qualifications;</HI> and even to Elect a Person that's but once mentioned, as was shewn in the Person of <HI>Casimire,</HI> the fourth King of <HI>Poland, An.</HI> 28 <HI>Henr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> VI. who having only the single Vote of the Lord <HI>Scales;</HI> yet upon respect to the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> how advantageous he might be for his, and his Kingdom's Interest, obtained the Election.</P>
<P>And of later Date, (as the Preambles for the carrying the Ensigns to Foreign Princes set forth) the Advantages the Sovereign has conceived to possess himself of, in the improving, confirming, and establishing, of a most strict and <HI>inviolable Bond of</HI> Friendship, and fair Correspondence, between him and Foreign Princes, their Realms and Sub∣jects, hath been a grand Inducement to Elect such Princes into this most noble Order.</P>

<P>§ 14. Upon the vacancy of any of the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> Stalls, the <HI>Election</HI> of others to supply those, is a
<PB N="267" REF="277"/>
Prerogative of the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and in some Cases to his Lieu∣tenant; for it's recorded in the <HI>Black Book of the Order,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes: That <HI>if any Stalls fall Vacant, it should belong to the Sovereign, to Elect new Knights, where∣soever he was Resident;</HI> upon Condition, the Chapter con∣sisted of six compleat <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> but if he chan∣ced to be out of his Realms, and the Number was de∣ficient, and that his Lieutenant held the <HI>Feast of St. George</HI> at <HI>Windsor;</HI> in such a Case the <HI>Election</HI> belongs to the <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> who is first to be certified of his <HI>Sovereign</HI>'s Pleasure, and what Esteem <HI>he</HI> has for the Candidates, to the intent such Information may guide, or direct his Election.</P>
<P><HI>This Power of</HI> Election <HI>is fully acknowledged, by the</HI> Knights-Companions <HI>themselves, to be in the Sovereign; as the fragment of a Letter demonstrates, sent from</HI> the Chapter, <HI>convened at</HI> Windsor, <HI>upon the</HI> Feast of St. George, <HI>to</HI> Henry <HI>V. then in</HI> France; <HI>viz.</HI> That the Sovereign, in what Place soever residing, may, as is most fitting, Elect into a vacant Stall, (there being a sufficient Number of Knights called to this Election) such as he shall judge serviceable to his Crown, or do exceed others in deserts, and nobleness of descent: <HI>And at publishing the</HI> Election <HI>of</HI> Duke Emanuel <HI>of</HI> Savoy, <HI>in the Reign of</HI> Philip <HI>and</HI> Mary, <HI>who were</HI> joint Sovereigns <HI>of the</HI> Order; <HI>it's styled, The Election of the</HI> King and the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>This grand Prerogative of the</HI> Sovereign <HI>being not duly weighed by</HI> Polydore Virgil, <HI>occasioned his tripping in this Affa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and drew in</HI> Claudius Coteraeus <HI>into the same pal∣pable mistake; for writing of this</HI> Order, <HI>and the Suc∣cession of new Knights, reports in his History of</HI> England, <HI>That</HI> one Knight is received in the room of another deceased, by the Choice and Election of all the rest; <HI>and</HI> Erhard Celly <HI>in his</HI> Anglo-Wirtemb <HI>does as falsely affirm,</HI> That no Per∣son may be received into this Order, not so much as by the Sovereign, unless with the common Consent and Suffrage of all the Knights-Companions.</P>
<P>But these Passages are altogether erroneous, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> only <HI>nominate</HI> the <HI>Persons,</HI> but the right of <HI>Election</HI> remains solely in the <HI>Sovereign</HI> of the Order; for whosoever is honoured with his Choice, is immediately admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted; and pronouncing barely the Name of the Per∣son in Chapter, constitutes the Election. After the Scrutiny
<PB N="268" REF="278"/>
hath been taken, and presented to the Sovereign, he peruseth it himself, or the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> or some other Officer of the <HI>Order</HI> that gathered it, reads it over to him; after∣wards the Sovereign resolves forthwith, upon some one or more of the Knights, contained in the Scrutiny; and then publickly declareth the <HI>Name</HI> of him, or them, he does <HI>Elect;</HI> and by the bare Act of his <HI>Pronunciation,</HI> they Commence Elected Knights; except now and then the Sovereign is pleased to give his Reasons, why the Knight is Elected by him.</P>
<P>But though this Act of <HI>Election</HI> be solely in the <HI>Sove∣reign,</HI> yet the Consent of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> is fre∣quently recorded in the <HI>Annals,</HI> and sometimes mentioned in the <HI>Commissions</HI> of <HI>Legations</HI> to <HI>Foreign Princes;</HI> not that the single Act of <HI>Election</HI> is, in truth, the Act of the whole Chapter, or is made invalid, witho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the joynt Consent of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> present at the Election; but their Consent so expressed, is to be taken as an honorary Respect given them by the Register, intimating rather an Applause, or Commendation of their <HI>Sovereign's Choice,</HI> as being in their Opinions Just and Right, according to the Merit of the Elected, than a material Circumstance, tending to the Ratification of the Election made by the Sovereign, as if defective without it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 15. Among other Duties incumbent on the <HI>Register,</HI> and expressed in the Statutes of the <HI>Order,</HI> this is one: That the Register<HI>'s Office is to set down, and record for a Memorial, the Elections (or Scrutinies,) and Names of the Knights Elected:</HI> But in succeeding Times a Scruple arose, if this was not needless, when the <HI>Scrutiny</HI> should be taken, yet no <HI>Election</HI> made; to clear up which doubt, in a Chapter held in 5 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> on St. <HI>George</HI>'s-<HI>Day,</HI> it's recorded as the Sovereign's Will and Pleasure, that thence∣forward it should be Enacted, and received as the San∣ction of a <HI>Law,</HI> within this Order; <HI>That if any Nomi∣nations were taken from the Knights-Companions, the same should be entered into the Annals, though there were no Ele∣ction made of any Person into the Order at that Time:</HI> Which we presume was so Decreed, out of great defe∣rence to those Princes and noble Personages, who, in de∣scending Times, should, by the glory of their Exploits, appear but worthy of a <HI>bare Nomination</HI> into so resplendent
<PB N="269" REF="279"/>
and illustrious an Order. And in pursuance of this <HI>Decree,</HI> there is frequent mention made of the delivery of the <HI>Scrutiny</HI> into the Hands of the Register, in order to be Recorded.</P>
<P>The Blue Book says, <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Elizabeth; That the Chancellor himself</HI> delivered the <HI>Knights-Companions Votes to the Register, to be committed to Writing, for a perpetual Memorial; and accordingly the Register, as his Duty obliged him, transcribed them, and put them in their proper Place, with all Care and Fidelity. Anno</HI> 34 of the same Queen, 'tis said, <HI>the Votes were delivered to the Register, who took care to Record them, according to usual Order.</HI> Yet mau∣gre this Law, the Entry of Scrutinies hath been some∣times omitted, either by the <HI>Register</HI>'s forgetfulness of the Decr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or some accidental Miscarriages. In some Places of the Annals, in the room of <HI>Scrutinies,</HI> we find Ex∣cuses entered, as it's said, <HI>Anno</HI> 28 <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> that the <HI>Prelate,</HI> immediately after <HI>Vespers,</HI> presented the Scrutiny to the Sovereign; but because there was no Election made of any new <HI>Knights,</HI> in regard of hurry, or weighty and pressing Affairs, it was laid aside, and <HI>through Neglect lost,</HI> or at least came not into the <HI>Register</HI>'s Hands, to be inserted in its proper Place. And when the Dean of <HI>Wind∣sor</HI> collected the Scrutiny at <HI>Vespers, Anno</HI> 18 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it's said, <HI>No Election was made, nor any thing else done:</HI> The like Excuse is made, <HI>Anno</HI> 5 <HI>Charles</HI> I. but the Fault is thrown upon the Chancellor; for though the Scrutiny had been taken by him, during the <HI>Vesper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Feast-Day, yet would he not suffer it to be entered.</HI> In some Places we find, <HI>Anno</HI> 31 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the <HI>Votes</HI> being presented, <HI>they were left with her.</HI> And <HI>Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Scru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ny of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gernoon</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> never came to the Register's Hands.</P>
<P>But the Law yet remains in force, that all <HI>Nominations</HI> and <HI>Votes</HI> of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> ought to be enter'd among the <HI>Annals,</HI> whether Election be made or not, un∣less it shall please the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> upon some Emergency, to forbid it: As appears but by one Example of such a Pro∣hibition, <HI>viz. Anno</HI> 40 <HI>Eliz.</HI> where, by the Queen's spe∣cial Command, the <HI>Scrutiny then taken was not recorded among the Acts of this most Noble Order.</HI> But then it is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣clared, That <HI>the Register took care to set down all the Pas∣sages as they happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned, the Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s only excepted.</HI> And
<PB N="270" REF="280"/>
why the <HI>Scrutiny</HI> is not inserted in the <HI>Registry, An.</HI> 44 of <HI>Eliz.</HI> gives this Account: That upon assembling the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> it seemed good to the Sovereign, for several urgent Reasons, best known to her self, to give Commandment, That for that time, <HI>they would wholly forbear all Scrutiny of Votes, and Nominations of Persons;</HI> except which, there was nothing wanting to heighten the Solemnity of that Assembly: But this in the <HI>Annals</HI> is said to be <HI>praeter morem,</HI> contrary to the usual Custom.</P>

<P>§ 16. <HI>Anno</HI> 27 of <HI>Eliz.</HI> there is a remarkable Occur∣rence, not to be passed over; for the Earls of <HI>Rutland</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> the morrow after St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, were desirous to have seen the <HI>Scrutiny,</HI> which was committed into the Custody of the Dean of <HI>Windsor,</HI> to be registred, in pur∣suance of the before-mentioned Decree, <HI>Anno</HI> 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> but he returned a modest denial, and said, <HI>It ought not to be seen before it was register'd.</HI> The Earls, not satisfied with this Answer, requested the Opinions of the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions,</HI> present at the Feast, on this Affair; who, upon mature Deliberation, adjudged the Point against them; and since it has been a standing Rule, that no Knight-Companion ought to see whom the other hath named.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 17. It hath chanced, that tho' the <HI>Nominations</HI> for <HI>Ele∣ction</HI> have been received, presented and perused, yet the Sovereign hath thought expedient to defer it, upon seve∣ral Considerations, and principally where an intent was to keep an open Stall; but we must understand this of such <HI>Scrutinies</HI> as are taken of Course, at the <HI>Vespers</HI> on the Feast-day.</P>
<P>And the most memorable Example of this Kind, is that of the Emperor <HI>Sigismond,</HI> who expired in the 16th Year of K. <HI>Henry</HI> VI. whose Stall was reserved Twenty One Years, and then determined, that Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> the So∣vereign's only Son, should fill it up, being at that time about Six Years of Age. This is the first Emperor, whose Election we find register'd in the <HI>Annals,</HI> being abcu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the 7th of <HI>May,</HI> in the 4th Year of <HI>Henry</HI> V. styled <HI>Sigismun∣dus Imperator Almanicus.</HI></P>
<P>And keeping a vacant Stall was sometimes given as a Reason by the Sovereign for his deferring an Election, as is plain from <HI>An.</HI> 13. <HI>Car.</HI> I. when the Scrutiny taken
<PB N="271" REF="281"/>
the Day before was read over in the Chapter-House, the Sovereign declared, <HI>That he would receive no Man into the Order before his Son</HI> Charles. Whereupon all the Knights-Companions gave their Opinions, <HI>That this Resolution was rather the effect of Justice, than Fatherly Indulgence; since they all acknowledged him, to be more a Prince by Merit, and towardliness of his Youth, than by the Fortune of his Birth.</HI> At which the Sovereign expressed his Satisfaction no otherwise than by Silence.</P>
<P>And in like manner, <HI>Anno</HI> 15 <HI>Charles</HI> I. when the Chan∣cellor of the Order gave up the Scrutiny to the Sovereign, he declared—<HI>That he had a purpose to have Chosen Prince</HI> Rupert, <HI>his Nephew, a Knight of the Order; but being then a Prisoner with the Emperor, he would not Elect any at that Time;</HI> whereupon, a vacancy of a <HI>Stall</HI> was reserved. It has sometimes been the Sovereign's Pleasure to defer Elections, without expressing the Cause, as in the 13 of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> though she perused the Scrutiny in Chapter, yet the <HI>Blue Book</HI> informs us; That the <HI>said So∣vereign made no Election, though two Stalls were vacant.</HI> Thus was it in the 2, 3, 11, and 12, of K. <HI>James</HI> I. where no other mention is made than this; <HI>none were admitted into the Order this Year.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes we find these <HI>Prorogations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Elections</HI> re∣corded, as solely done by the Will of the <HI>Sovereign;</HI> and at other Times by the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and the approbation of the <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> to the first of these we find a Memorial, in the 22 of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> on the 24 of <HI>April;</HI> that the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> had a Message sent to their Chapter, held before Morning-Prayer; <HI>That it was the Pleasure of the Sovereign to pror<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue the Election to the follow∣ing Year.</HI> And so it was, in the 10th of <HI>Charles</HI> I. though the Nomination was taken by the Chancellor, and pre∣sented to the Sovereign in Chapter, <HI>the Sovereign did not think fit to make any Election at all.</HI> And for a Test<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mony of the second, we meet with this Instance, in the 27th of <HI>Elizabeth; that with the concurrent Approbation and Assent of all the Knights-Companions then assisting, the Sovereign tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght fit to put off the Election to another Time.</HI> As to the seeming difference of the <HI>Sovereign's ab∣solute Authority,</HI> and yet the <HI>Knights-Companions Appro∣bation,</HI> we have cleared up that Point in the <HI>Act of Ele∣ction;</HI> for though it is <HI>his</HI> unquestionable Authority and
<PB N="272" REF="282"/>
Prerogative, to Prorogue <HI>Elections ad libitum,</HI> yet out of Respect, and Honour to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> their Approbation hath been sometimes exprest.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 18. When any Knight-Companion hath received a Summons, to appear at a Chapter of Election, and doth wilfully refuse, or withdraw himself, he was to be mulct a Mark for his Disobedience, which King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes inlarged to twenty Shillings, payable to the Dean and College of <HI>Windsor,</HI> to pray for defunct Souls. And at his next appearance in Chapter, he was to remain kneeling in the midst of them, before the Sovereign, or Deputy, till he was restor'd to their Favour: Yet upon a just Cause signified to the <HI>Sovereign</HI> some time before, under the Seal of his Arms, he was excused, if it was found just and feasible; if not, it was rejected, and he re∣mained Punishable.</P>
<P>And for greater Caution, this Clause was formerly in∣serted, in the <HI>Letters of Summons;</HI> where, after the Time and Place for Election was certified, and command given to observe both, the Letter concludes thus, <HI>et se estre ny poues nous Signifies soubz,</HI> &amp;c. and if it cannot be accom∣plished, that is, if the Knight-Companion could not meet at the time assigned, to perform what the Statutes oblige, he should then <HI>signify to the Sovereign, under his Seal, the cause of his Impediment; so that he might perceive by his Excuse,</HI> whether it was worthy of Acceptance, or he in Fault or not.</P>

<P>Our most dear and entirely beloved Son, having, to our great Comfort, seen and considered the ripeness of your Youth, and conceived joyful and pregnant Hopes of your manly Virtue, in which we are assured you will increase, to your own Honour, both in Prowess, Wisdom, Justice, and all Princely Endowments; and that the Emulation of Chevalry will, in your tender Years, provoke and encourage you, to pursue the Glory of Heroick Actions, befitting your Royal Birth, and our Care and Education. We with the Companions of our most Noble Order of the Garter, assembled in Chap∣ter, holden this present Day, at our Castle of <HI>Windsor;</HI> have Elected and Chosen you one of the Companions of our Order. In Signification whereof, we have sent unto you, by our Trusty and Well-Beloved Servant, Sir <HI>John Burrough</HI> Knight-Garter, and our principal King of Arms, these our <HI>Royal Letters,</HI> requiring you to make your speedy repair unto us, to receive the En∣signs of our most Noble Order, and to be ready for your Installation, upon the 21st Day of this present Month. </P>

This is the only Instance we have met with, where a Letter was sent to an Elect Knight, and he at the same time present at Court; but when an Election is confirm∣ed, and the Person remote from the Court, then the gene∣ral Tenure of the Letter is, both to signify his Election, and Summon him to his Investure, with the Garter and George, as was performed by the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Strafford,</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But where the Sovereign is pleased to mention particu∣lar Services, to recommend the Election of a Knight, the Preamble of the Letter is worded accordingly; and as this is a Case not very frequent, it will not be amiss to exemplify it in the Choice of Sir</HI> John Falstoff, <HI>where the Letter runs thus</HI>—We considering the virtuous Fidelity you have shown, and the honourable Exploits you have done, in the Service of our thrice renowned Father, and that in our Ser∣vice also, you (as many others) have given Proof of that Honour, and those Deserts, wherewith God hath endowed you, always suffering, as is the part of a good Subject, the Pains and Toils of War, for the vindicating and maintaining of our just Right, Claim, and Title, have Chosen you one of our Companions of our Order.</P>
<P>When the Letter barely signifies Election, that is, when the Sovereign does not design a present investure with the Garter and George, but defers it till he takes Possession of his Stall, the Day of his Installation is inserted towards the end of the Letter; and upon his appearance at <HI>Windsor,</HI> so soon as he appears in the Chapter-House, the Garter is first buckled about his left Leg, then follows his Investure with the rest of the Ornaments of the Order, and lastly his Installation. And this was the Case of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland, Anno</HI> 29 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. whose Investure of the Garter was deferr'd till his appearance at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and then the whole Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mony was performed at once.</P>

<P>§ 3. The Knight elect being thus introduced to the So∣vereign, bows with all Reverence, and formerly a short gratulatory Speech was the vogue, that set forth his ac∣knowledgment of his Sovereign's Royal Favour, and the grateful Respect he bore to the Knights-Companions for his Election.</P>

were read. The <HI>Admonition,</HI> upon the buckling of the Garter, in the <HI>English</HI> Statutes of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. is set down on this manner:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The loving Brethren of the Order of the Garter, have re∣ceived you their Brother and Fellow; and in Token of this, they give and present you this present Garter, which God grant that you receive and wear from henceforth to his Praise and Glory, and to the Exaltation and Honour of the said Noble Order, and your self.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Afterwards it was decreed, at a Chapter held at <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> the 5th of <HI>August, Anno</HI> 1 &amp; 2 <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il.</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> to this effect: <Q>That not only the same Advertisements, which were wont to be given to Strangers at their Investitures, should be likewise given to Knights-Subjects, that for the future should be elected and install'd;</Q> and with a farther Proviso, <Q>That among the Knights-Companions there should not be any difference either in Ceremony or Habit.</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon the aforesaid Tenure ceased to be used upon the fixing of the Garter, and one Form remained at the Investiture of Strangers and Knights-Subjects, which is pronounced by the Chancellor, if the Sovereign or his Lieutenant be present, otherwise by the Register.</P>
<Q>To the Laud and Honour of Almighty God, his im∣maculate Mother, and St. <HI>George</HI> the holy Martyr, tye or gird your Leg with this noble Garter, wearing it to the increase of your Honour, and in Token and Re∣membrance of this most noble Order; remembring that thereby you being admonished and encouraged, in all just Battels and Wars, which only you shall take in Hand, both strongly to fight, valiantly to stand, and honourably to have Victory.</Q>
<P>But against the Investiture of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Words of the Signification being better weighed and considered, were thus methodized:</P>
<Q>To the Honour of God Omnipotent, and in Memo∣rial of the blessed Martyr St. <HI>George,</HI> tye about thy Leg.
<PB N="278" REF="288"/>
for thy Renown, this noble Garter; wear it as the Sym∣bol of the most illustrious Order, never to be forgotten or laid aside; that thereby thou may'st be admonished to be couragious; and having undertaken a just War, into which only thou shalt be engaged, thou may'st stand Firm, valiantly Fight, and successfully Conquer.</Q>
<P>The Princely Garter being thus buckled on, and the Words of the Signification pronounced, the Elect Knight is brought before the Sovereign, who puts about his Neck the <HI>George,</HI> pendant at a Sky-colour'd Ribband, at which part of the Ceremony, the Admonition used at the adorn∣ing of an installed Knight with the Collar of the Order, (only changing the Word Collar for Ribband) is pro∣no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ced; but were alter'd upon the Occasion assign'd before.</P>
<Q>Wear this Ribband about thy Neck, adorn'd with the Image of the blessed Martyr, and Soldier of Christ, St. <HI>George;</HI> by whose Imitation provok'd, thou may'st so overpass both prosperous and adverse Adventures, that having stoutly vanquished thy Enemies, both of Body and Soul, thou may'st not only receive the Praise of this transient Combat, but be crown'd with the Palm of e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal Victory.</Q>
<P>Greater Respect is conferr'd upon foreign Princes, who receive their Election here, than abroad; because the So∣vereign most usually performs the Investiture himself; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was solemniz'd upon <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> when the Sovereign took the Garter from the King at Arms, and sixed it on his Leg, and Prince <HI>Henry</HI> fasten'd the Buckle.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> her self buckled the Garter about the Leg of <HI>John C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>simier,</HI> Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and hung about his Neck a Gold Chain with the <HI>George</HI> at i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And the like Honour did King <HI>James</HI> I. confer upon the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> in the 3d Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>Sometimes it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pens, tho' very rarely, for the Sove∣reign, out of his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecial Grace and Favour, to condesc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to Hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur a Knight-Subject this way; tho', when Queen <HI>Eliz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beth</HI> was pleased to adorn the Lord <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leigh</HI> with the Garter, the <HI>Annals</HI> record it to be done as it were <HI>by the by.</HI> The same Favours she b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stow'd, tho' at different

times, upon <HI>Henry,</HI> Earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Shrews∣bury.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> I. invested <HI>Henry,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northamp∣ton,</HI> with the principal Ensigns of the Order, as a Person worthy of so great an Honour: And the <HI>Blessed Martyr</HI> placed both the <HI>Garter</HI> and the <HI>George,</HI> with his own Hands, upon King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Sovereign hath but performed part of the Investiture, and laid his Commands on the senior Knight to do the rest. Thus, <HI>Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Sovereign reached out the Garter to the Marquis of <HI>Dor∣set,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d commanded him to buckle it about the Leg of the Earl of <HI>Devonshire;</HI> which, whilst he was about, the Duke of <HI>Norfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> gave him his Assistance, and the Sove∣reign put on the Gold Chain. At the Investiture of <HI>Chri∣stian,</HI> Duke of <HI>Brunswick, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the Sovereign put about his Neck the Blue Ribband, whereat hung the Effigies of St. <HI>George;</HI> and the Earls, who introduc'd him to the Sovereign's Presence, buckled on the Garter. Thus did the Sovereign to <HI>William,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton, Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I. and the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> fasten'd the Garter about his left Leg.</P>
<P>This Order of Investiture began to be inverted <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the <HI>George</HI> and the Ribband being first put on, and the Garter last. And so was it performed when the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> Dukes of <HI>Monmouth, Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Albemarle,</HI> received their Investiture in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. The Garter, as it was the first, so is the prin∣cipal and most worthy Ensign of the Order; and, in the Practice of all former Times, had always the Preference given to it. The Investiture with these two Ensigns, hath generally been performed by the two senior Knights, at the Command of the Sovereign; but always in his Presence, the Chapter sitting; but if absent, then by his Lieutenant. For, in 31 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Lord <HI>Buckhurst</HI> being elected at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and coming to Court wholly igno∣rant of the Affair, and after the Sovereign was risen, (yet leaving the Chapter sitting) her Lieutenant invested him both with the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George.</HI> After the Solemnity is compleated, the elect Knight renders most humble Thanks to the Sovereign, and with due Respects salutes the Knights-Companions, who re-salute the elect Knight, and joyfully receive him into their Society. If two or more elect Knights receive this Investiture at one time,
<PB N="280" REF="290"/>
as soon as the Senior is invested, and his humble Thanks presented, he moves downwards towards the Chapter-House Door, and there stands till the next Junior Knight is invested; and if there be more, so on until the Chapter break up.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 4. Where a Knight-Subject, at the time of his Ele∣ction, is far distant from Court, or beyond Sea, and the Sovereign determines to send him the Two principal En∣signs of the Order, the Charge of this Employ does of right belong to the <HI>Garter.</HI> For the Proof of which there are divers Precedents.</P>
<P>The Letters heretofore sent from the Sovereign, along with the Ensigns of the Order, to the elect Knights, have, for the most part, been drawn after the Form of those that certify the Election, and differs only in the last Clause, which requires the elect Knight to repair to the Sove∣reign: The difference lay not in the Body, but in the Direction of the Letter, which was always worded ac∣cording to the Quality of the Person to whom it was sent. As to a Knight-Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chelor, the Direction was, <HI>To our tru∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and well-beloved;</HI> and to an Earl, <HI>Right trusty, and rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t well-beloved Cousin;</HI> to a Duke, <HI>Right trusty, and right en∣tirely beloved Cousin,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Forms of those Letters, sent upon like Occasions to Knights-Subjects, when King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was beyond Sea, were penn'd after another Model, and contained other additional particular Clauses; as, 1. Power to wear the <HI>Star</HI> of Silver about St. <HI>George</HI>'s Cross; 2. The Great Collar of the Order; and, 3. To style themselves <HI>Knights, and Companions of the Order of the Garter,</HI> in as ample a Manner, as if they had been installed at <HI>Windsor;</HI> with an Assurance of receiving the whole Habit there, when the Sovereign was restored to the Possession thereof.</P>
<P>And it appears from some of these Letters, that by rea∣son Sir <HI>Edward Walker,</HI> Garter, was otherwise employ'd in the Service of the Sovereign, when they were trans∣mit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, the Sovereign pitch'd upon other Persons, to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ry both the Letters and Ensigns of the Order, and yet continued the Garter in the Rights of his Office. How∣ever, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> esteeming this devolving his Employ∣ment on others, as an Invasion on the Rights of his Office; and having a just regard for the Interest of his Successors,
<PB N="281" REF="291"/>
no less than his own, humbly petitioned King <HI>Charles</HI> II. for Redress, and obtained his gracious Reference there∣upon, to several <HI>Knights</HI> of the Order, to examine the Matter, and to give in their Report, what they found, and what they thought proper to be effected therein; and up∣on whose Report the Sovereign did him full Right by his gracious <HI>Declaration.</HI> For the Dukes of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> to whom this Affair was referr'd, gave in their Report to the <HI>King</HI> at <HI>Breda, May</HI> 27. 1650.</P>

And we do therefore make this Report to your Majesty, to the end you may be pleased to mantain the Petitioner in his just Rights; and that no Example late∣ly made may be brought in Precedent against him, or his Suc∣cessors in the said Office.</P>

<P>It was formerly the Practice, to send the Book of Sta∣tutes, under the common Seal of the Order, together with the Letters signifying an Election, and the Ensigns of the Order, no less to a Knight Subject than to a Stranger, that he might peruse and advise thereupon, whether he would accept of the Election, or not; for so it appears, <HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. by the Letters sent to Sir <HI>John Falstoff.</HI></P>
<P>Within a few Days after Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was elected into this Order, (being then in <HI>Holland)</HI> a Commission of Le∣gation was prepared to be sent thither, with the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> by Sir <HI>John Burrough,</HI> Kt. to perform the In∣vestiture with them; but Sir <HI>John</HI> dying, prevented the Ceremony.

his Highness, to declare the Reason why the said Com∣mission was not sent and executed, as was designed, as well as to deliver him the Commission it self; to the in∣tent (being prevented of receiving his Installation at <HI>Windsor,</HI> because that Castle continued in the Possession of the Rebels) it might remain with him as a Memorial of his Sovereign's Princely Favour, and Respect to his Quality and Merits, and for a farther Evidence of his be∣ing admitted into this most Noble Order, since there was no other Memorial thereof, but the Minutes of his Ele∣ction, and this Commission. And accordingly on <HI>Mon∣day,</HI> the 14th of <HI>January,</HI> 1644. the Chancellor, accom∣panied with Dr. <HI>Christopher Wren,</HI> Register, and Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Walker,</HI> newly made Garter, attended the Prince at his Lodgings in <HI>Oxford;</HI> who, having notice of their De∣sign, receiv'd them with all obliging Civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity; and the Chancellor, in an eloquent Speech, made known to his Highness his Sovereign's Commands, and the Intent of his coming; which was no sooner finished, but Sir <HI>James Palmer</HI> presented his Petition to the Prince, who gave his Majesty many humble Thanks for this gracious Message; and acknowledged his Majesty's Favours beyond his De∣sert; but promised he would study to be more worthy by his Actions, than in return of Words; with many Thanks to the Chancellor, and other Officers of the Or∣der, for their Trouble: Whereupon they took their Leave, and the Chancellor went immediately to his Majesty, and gave him a Narrative of what they had done.</P>

<P>§ V. It was an ancient Custom, and part of the Ce∣remony belonging to the Investiture with the Garter, to give him an Oath, whether he was a Stranger or a Sub∣ject-Knight, which we find styled, <HI>The Oath in such Cases accustomed to be taken;</HI> and which was to this effect; <HI>That the Knight should well and faithfully keep and observe, so far as God should enable him, all that was contained in the Statutes of the Order:</HI> But this of late hath been disused, and not imposed, unless upon foreign Princes.</P>
<P>It is observable, that <HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. a particular Commission was issued, to the Earls of <HI>Warwick, Salis∣bury,</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> with Power, to any Two, or One of them, to receive this Oath from Sir <HI>John Falstoff,</HI> upon his Investiture; which was besides the Oath his Proctor
<PB N="283" REF="293"/>
was afterwards to take at the Installation, which Sir <HI>John</HI> empowered him to do on his behalf; which was, <HI>Such Oath as should be required at the time of Installation.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' we have fully treated of the Ceremony and Man∣ner of investing a Knight elect, with the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> we shall subjoin Two or Three considerable Instances, as most proper to this Place.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip,</HI> Prince of <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Mariae,</HI> had these Ensigns of the Order sent him, the Sovereign joyn'd Gar∣ter King of Arms, with the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> to perform the Investiture; who, upon notice of his arrival on the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> set forward on their Journey to <HI>South∣ampton;</HI> where, on <HI>Friday</HI> the 20th of <HI>July,</HI> they took Water, and meeting the Prince before he landed, entered his Barge, and gave him notice of his Election in a short Speech; which being ended, <HI>Garter</HI> having the Garter in his Hand, kissed it, and so presented it to the Earl, who forthwith fasten'd it about the Prince's Leg; and after <HI>Garter</HI> had presented the Earl with the <HI>George,</HI> hang∣ing at a Chain of Gold, he put it likewise about the Prince's Neck. The Ceremony of Investiture being thus perform∣ed, the Prince came on s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore at <HI>Southampton;</HI> and on the uppermost Stair were ready attending his landing, the Marquis of <HI>Winchester,</HI> Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> with divers other Lords: The Prince gave the Lord <HI>Williams</HI> his White Staff, and made him Lord Chamber∣lain of his Houshould; and Sir <HI>Anthony Brown,</HI> Master of his Horse, presented him, from the Queen, a Horse with a Foot-cloth of Crimson Velvet, richly embroider'd with Gold and Pearls, having the Bridle and all other Furni∣ture suitable, whereon he rode to the Cathedral, and after Prayers to the Lodging prepared for him.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Garter</HI>'s Investitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Earl of <HI>War∣wick,</HI> at <HI>Newhaven</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> the first of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> is as follows: The <HI>Garter</HI> repairing first to the Earl's Lodg∣ings, put on his Mantle in the next Chamber to the Earl's, and proceeded into the Earl's Chamber; where, having made Three Reverences, he buckled the Garter about his left Leg, and after put on the <HI>George</HI> and the Ribband about his Neck; reading to the Earl the Words of the Signification, appointed to be pronounced at the Investi∣ture; which being concluded, <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> retir'd into the Room
<PB N="284" REF="294"/>
where he had put on his Mantle, and there disrobed him∣self, and so the Ceremony ended.</P>
<P>It was the Custom about these Times, for the Nobi∣lity, Allies, or Friends, to the elect Knight, to send hin by the <HI>Garter,</HI> several <HI>Garters</HI> and <HI>Georges,</HI> as Marks of Congratulation for the Honour he was to receive, which the <HI>Garter</HI> delivered to him when the Investiture was fi∣nished, and he had put off his Robe, with the particular Services and Respects of those Friends who had bestow'd them. For thus was it with the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> at <HI>New∣haven,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Scroop</HI> at <HI>Carlis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI> At the <HI>Garter</HI>'s return to Court, he is obliged to deliver an Account to the Sovereign, how he hath discharged h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Employment; and by special Directions from the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect Knight, who presents the highest Respects he can express, as well to the Sovereign as to the rest of the Knights-Companions, for honouring him with a Reception into so illustrious a Body.</P>
<P>We shall close this Section with a brief Account of the Investiture of the Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> on <HI>Easter-day</HI> in the Morning, being the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> 1653. In reference to which Ceremony there was provided:</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Garter</HI> with the Motto, to be tyed about his le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Leg.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>George</HI> in a Ribband, to be put about his Neck.</P>
<P N="3">3. An embroider'd <HI>Cross</HI> of St. <HI>George,</HI> with a <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>Star,</HI> to be sew'd on the left Shoulder of the Duke's Cloak.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Velvet Cushion, whereon the <HI>Ensigns</HI> and <HI>Orna∣ments</HI> of the Order were to be laid.</P>
<P>For the Honour of the Order, and his said Highness, Sir <HI>Edward Walker,</HI> Garter, humbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proposed, That he might be assisted by Two or Four Knights in performing his Duty.</P>
<P>That his Highness the Duke might receive the Ensigns of the Order, in the Presence-Chamber of the Princess Royal, or in his own, accompanied with the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> her Royal Highness, and some other Persons of Honour and Quality.</P>
<P>That his Highness having placed himself under the State, <HI>Garter</HI> should take the Cushion upon his Arms, on which
<PB N="285" REF="295"/>
were to be laid all the particular Ornaments just now mentioned; being assisted with the Knights, and a Pas∣sage left for him to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke his Three Obeysances, he should proceed up towards the Duke, and lay the Cushion with the Ornaments upon a Stool set near his Highness for that purpose.</P>
<P>That he should signifie to his Higness, in few Words, the Cause of his coming, and then deliver into his Hands the Sovereign's Letter.</P>
<P>That his Highness having receiv'd it, should break it open, and deliver it back to the <HI>Garter</HI> to be read; which he having done, should return it to his Highness.</P>
<P>That, after this, he should proceed to the Investiture of his Highness with the Ensig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Order.</P>
<P>Which being done, he briefly represented unto his Highness, in a Speech, somewhat of the Quality and Splendor of the Order.</P>
<P>And, lastly, to kiss his Highness Hand, and so depart. And according to those Proposals, and in the same Order, were all Things performed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 6. The Sovereign of this most Noble Order defrays the Charges of the <HI>Garter,</HI> whens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever, and as often as he is dispatch'd to any elect Knight-Subject, either with Letters to signifie his Election, or to invest him with the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George;</HI> and this is commonly proportioned ac∣cording to the length or the shortness of the Journey. The Allowance for the Journey which Sir <HI>Gilbert Dithick,</HI> Gar∣ter, made into the Counties of <HI>Lincoln</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> first to the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> and then to the Lord <HI>Scroop,</HI> when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was Sovereign, appears to have been 20 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the Sovereign's Allowance to the <HI>Garter,</HI> he re∣ceives honourable Gratuities and Rewards from the elect Knight himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, after he has performed the Investiture; and these have usually been proportioned, according to the estimate of the Honour he receives, and the particular affection he has for the Garter, and the service done by him. Among whom, <HI>Anno</HI> 17 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. we find the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> bestow'd on <HI>Thomas W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sley,</HI> Garter, ten Pounds in Angel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, being then at his Mannor of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wnley;</HI> and <HI>Ral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> Earl of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eland,</HI> elected at the same Time with the aforesaid Earl, being at <HI>Mile-end,</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="296"/>
gave to him six Pounds thirteen Shillings and four Pence. The Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in the 23 of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. bestow'd on the Garter, for the verbal certifying him of his Election, four Pounds, though he went no farther than the Chapter-House Door.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> honou∣rably received the Garter at <HI>Newark,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Scroop</HI> gave him thirty Pounds in Gold, a Velvet Cloak, and a <HI>Gallaway Nag,</HI> and to <HI>William Dethick, York Herald,</HI> who accompanied Garter to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> ten Pounds.</P>
<P>But since these Times, the Knights elect have enlarged their gratuities to Garter, for his Service upon this Oc∣casion.</P>

<HEAD>CAP. XI. Of Preparations for the Personal Installa∣tion of a Knight.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 1. THE Inauguration of a Knight of this most Noble Order, consists in a Conjunction of many Ceremonies, and contains the most solemn part of those, which compleateth all the rest; and till this great Solemnity be regularly and duly per∣formed, the Person elected hath not the Honour to be enrolled among the Number of Founders, but barely passes for an elect Knight, and no other: For the Sta∣tute expresly says, That in Case a Knight elect die be∣fore his Installation, He shall not be named one of the Founders; and the reason assigned for it is, because he hath not had the full Possession of his Estate, and in this Point do the other Bodies of the Statutes agree. But when the Ceremonies of Installation are compleatly fini∣shed, without all doubt the Knight is amply vested, in Possession of all Honours and Privileges appertaining to the Founder of this most Noble Order. But to spur up each elect Knight, who is either a Subject to his Sove∣reign, or resides within the Realm, (and consequently i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better able to provide for Installment, than one remaining
<PB N="287" REF="297"/>
in Foreign Parts,) for the completion of his Honour, or else to wave the Act of Election, he has the space of one Year allowed him by the Statutes for Installation, otherwise his Election is ordained to be absolutely null and void: Nor can there be any Motive sufficient to retard the Sovereign from proceeding to a new Election, unless the elect Knight send or produce an Extenuation or Excuse for such his delay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to be excepted by the Sovereign or his Deputy, and the whole of that resplendent Body, or that the Sovereign himself think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to defer the Ceremony of Installation for some time longer. For which reason, when certain Articles, tending to the Honour of the Or∣der, had been prepared by the Sovereign's Lieutenant and ten Knights-Companions, in a Chapter held the 24th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 21 <HI>Jacobus</HI> I. ratified by the Sovereign, and ordered to be observed; one of them was for acce∣lerating the Installation, after the Knight had been ele∣cted, yet qualified with this Exception: <HI>Unless for some special Cause the Sovereign shou'd think fit to defer the same until the Eve or Day of St.</HI> George <HI>next following, the Time of Election.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 2. The Feast of Installation hath not been hitherto assigned to any certain Period of Time, but has always depended upon the Will and Pleasure of the Sovereign, to affix a convenient Day, which hath been granted upon the request of the Knights elect, or some other of the Knights-Companions, whose Favour and Esteem with the Sovereign was best able to prevail; such a one do we find <HI>Anno</HI> 35 <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> who, on the behalf of the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> obtained the 19th of <HI>June</HI> the said Year, to be appointed for the Installation. It sometimes happens, that though the Day of Installation be prefixed, yet something extraordinary intervening, it hath been prorogued to a farther and more convenient Season for the Sovereign's Affairs. And the most remarkable In∣stance is set down, <HI>Anno</HI> 3 and 4 <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> when the Earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> the Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Rochester,</HI> Knights elect, had their Installation, together with the Feast of St. <HI>Georg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> prorogued to the 10th of <HI>May</HI> in the Year aforesaid. But many urgent Affairs, relating both to the King and the Queen, fell out about that time; not only the Grand Feast, but the Solemnity of their Installation
<PB N="288" REF="298"/>
were prorogued to the 5th of <HI>December,</HI> and stood so by several Prorogations, to the 20th of <HI>February</HI> next ensuing; yet it was ordered that the Earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> shou'd be immediately installed, which was performed on the 8th of <HI>January,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> the 20th of <HI>April</HI> fol∣lowing; but Sir <HI>Robert Rochester</HI> never obtained that Ho∣nour.</P>
<P>Though the time of Installation be arbitrary and uncer∣tain, yet hath the Place, from the first Institution of the Order, been appointed only to the Sovereign's Free Chapel of St. <HI>George,</HI> within whose Choice are erected the So∣vereigns and Knights-Companions Stalls, and under its sacred Roof their Banners and Atchievements are affixed, as Monuments of their high Merit, and so great Honour. For though the Celebration of the Grand Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> happened to be removed from <HI>Windsor,</HI> by a Decree of the 1 <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> yet the Feast of the Installation was ex∣cepted, and ordered to be Solemniz'd in that Place: For <HI>Anno</HI> 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. it was provided among the Orders, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at after an Election made of a Knight of the Order, his Installation shou'd be performed at</HI> Windsor, <HI>according to the ancient Customs and Statutes of the Order.</HI> When the So∣vereign hath been pleased to prefix a certain Day for this Solemnity of Installation, there are several things to be obtained, previous to it. (1.) A Commission to admit and instal the elect Knight. (2.) Letters to each of the Commissioners, and the elect Knight, to repair to <HI>Wind∣sor.</HI> (3.) Warrants for the Sovereign's Livery. (4.) A Bill or Warrant for the removal of Stalls and Atchieve∣ments, all signed by the Chancellor of the Order, with the Sign Manual of the Sovereign: And lastly, the Knights own Preparations; among which his Atchievements are to be ready to be hung up, as soon as he is installed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 3. No elect Knight can be installed, unless by the Sovereign of the Order himself, or by his Commission drawn up in Writing, and passed under the Great-Seal of the Order, directed e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther to his Lieutenant or Knights-Commissioners. There is but one Instance to be found, where the Sovereign hath been pleased to Honour a Knight by installing of him himself; and that was <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. yet it is feasible enough that <HI>Sigismond</HI> the Emperor, and some other Foreign
<PB N="289" REF="299"/>
Princes of Rank and Eminence, might be installed by other Sovereigns, though there's no Memorial le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon Record. <HI>In reference to Installation by Commission, it was ordained by the Statutes of Institution; That in Case the So∣vereign shou'd be absent out of the Kingdom, at the Time of Installation of any of the Knights, so as he could not per∣sonally perform those things his Office obliged him to, it shou'd be Lawful for him to Constitute, as his Deputy in this Affair, whomsoever of the Society he shou'd think fit; and he to have Power and Authority, in the Sovereign's Name, to Perform and Execute these Things, which it wou'd have been in his own part to have done, had he been Present.</HI> By Vir∣tue of this Article, the Sovereign's Deputy, or Lieutenant, performed the Ceremony before the Reign of King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> VIII. which was usually done at the Feast of St. <HI>George;</HI> but in the Commission given out for Installation, formerly the Lieutenant was first mentioned, and the Knights-Com∣panions appointed for his Assistance at the said Feast, were joined with him in the Commission for Installation; but of late, the Commission hath passed to the Lieute∣nant alone. King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. by his Statutes, enlarged the Power of his Deputy, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d they run to two or more of the Knights-Companions, that shou'd Exercise the same by the Sovereign's Letters of Commission. And by the Privilege of this Article, whensoever after, the Sove∣reign's did Constitute an Installation, otherwise than at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> they then delegated their Authority to such of the Knights-Companions as were judged most proper to perform this Ceremony. The Year after the enacting this Statute, there's a Commission recorded to be issued out to the Marquiss of <HI>Dorset,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> to Instal the Lords <HI>Ferrers</HI> of <HI>Chart∣ley,</HI> the substance of which is in our Annals. The par∣ticular Powers these Commissions have granted to them, are to accept and admit the Knight into the Order, to re∣ceive the Oath, and to Instal him; And their general Power is, to effect and accomplish every Point which be∣longs to his due Admittance, and plenary Instalment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 4. Besides, the Commission impowering the Sove∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign's Lieutenant, or Knights-Commissioners, therein nominated to the Installation of an elect Knight, it hath been a matter frequent with the Sovereign, to Issue out
<PB N="290" REF="300"/>
Letters of Summons under his privy Signet, both to the Commissioners for Installation, and elect Knights, under the Signet of the Order; those to the Commissioners are directed severally to each, nominated in the Commission; who are to give them notice of the Instalment, and to re∣quire their repair to <HI>Windsor,</HI> against the Day assigned, that they may proceed to their Installation. Those di∣rected to the elect Knights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ass likewise under the So∣vereign's Sign Manual, and Signet of the Order; and if there be two or more Knights appointed to be Installed on the same Day, the like Letter is sent to each of them, the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fference being only in the Direction.</P>
<P>Besides these Letters sent from the Sovereign, the Chancellor (if the Sovereign be absent,) in his circular Letter to the Knights-Companions, gives them an intima∣tion of the designed Installation, upon the Feast of St. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> And if the Feast be held either by the Sov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eign or his Lieutenant, he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spatcheth a Letter to the Prelate of the Order, intimating the Sovereign's Commands for his attend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce at the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y appointed; and if it be per∣formed by Commissioners, he issues h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Letters to the three inferior Officers of the Order, purporting the same Command; the conveyance of which appertains to the Garter, and are left to his Care, and Trust, by the Con∣stituti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns relating to the Order, whose allowances and rewa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on these and such like Services, in their due P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be considered.</P>

<P>Over and above these, there is a Warrant and Scheme prepared for the Sovereign to Sign, wherein is described the Order of the Stalls of <HI>Windsor,</HI> as he wou'd have them stand at the ensuing Election; by the Virtue of which, the Garter is impowered to shift or remove the Plates and Atchievements of the present Knights-Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anions, so that room may be made for the elect Knight, or Knights, and to fix the new Plates and Atchieveme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and over the Stalls, in such order as they are rank'd in the Scheme. As soon as the Sovereign's Pleasure is known concerning an Insta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation, Garter brings to the Chancellor of the Order, the Names of the present Knights-Compa∣nions, placed in the order they then sit in their Stalls, to the intent he may pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent them to the Sovereign; who, upon observing the series wherein they stand already, he may easier determine how to alter and place both them, and the new elect Knights. <HI>Anno</HI> 27 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fice of the Garter being vacant, this employ was put upon the Clarenceux, and the Sovereign's Warrant for removal and placing of Plates and Atchievement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, was delivered to him, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Days before the Installation of the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> the Lords <HI>Cobham</HI> and <HI>Scroop,</HI> who thereupon fixed them according to the direction given; upon what Ground this alteration and removal came to be made, and continues still in Vogue, though it was otherwise at the Institution of the Order, wherein we must have re∣course to the Statutes, and the antique Practice grounded upon them: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong the Statutes, those of the Institution did ordain, That if any Earl, Baron, or Knight-Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chellor, shou'd depart this Life, he that succeeded in his Place, of what Condition or State soever, shou'd possess the same Stall which his Predecessor held before, without changing: So that it might happen for an Earl, or a Duke, to suc∣ceed a Knight, and<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>vice versa,</HI> it was thus at first constituted by <HI>Edward</HI> III. <HI>that it might be known who were the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Founders of this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Noble Order.</HI></P>
<P>Now how pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctually this Article of the Statutes hath been observed, that none Chosen along time after the In∣stitution of the Order, shou'd interrupt or change this course, we shall demonstrate, conceiving it very material to eye those Tables, yet preserved in the Chapter-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>

in <HI>Windsor,</HI> wherein are collected the Names of all those Knights-Companions who succeeded one another in each Stall, until the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> VII's Reign.</P>
<P>From which Series of Succession, we shall remark how exactly the Law in this Point hath been observed, even to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Reign, when it received some altera∣tion in this Point. For we find in the Annals several Knights designed for the Stall of their immediate Prede∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssors, by the Honour only of Election, although pre∣vented of Installation by Death, or other accidents; and the Statutes do not only bind him who shall chance to attain the Honour of Installation, <HI>but him who shall succeed or come after the Defunct Knight.</HI> First therefore we shall Instance in Foreign Kings, among whom we find <HI>Ericus</HI> King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> to have received <HI>Installation</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> V's Reign, not according to the State and Dignity of a King, but into the Stall of that Knight-Companion whom he succeeded, <HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bavaria. John</HI> the first King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> a Knight and Companion, likewise in <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> V's Time, was installed in the second Stall on the So∣vereign's Side, which belong'd to <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> his first Predecessor: And to this King did succeed, in the same Stall, his Son <HI>Edward</HI> King of <HI>Portugal, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to whose Successor <HI>Humphry, Anno</HI> 34, and <HI>Casimir</HI> King of <HI>Poland</HI> were elected, <HI>Anno</HI> 28 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. into the sixth Stall on the Prince's side, at that Time vacant by the Death of the Duke <HI>Conimbero,</HI> whose first Founder was Sir <HI>John Mohun. Alphonsus</HI> King of <HI>Arragon</HI> and <HI>Na∣ples, Anno</HI> 38 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was elected into the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of <HI>Don Altro Vasques Dalmed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt d' Averence,</HI> being the seventh on the Sovereign's side, Sir <HI>Hugh Courtney</HI> first pos∣sessing it. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Niples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> elected <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Edward</HI> IV. was installed on the third on the Prince's side, <HI>Ralph</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford</HI> having been first i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stalled therein. And lastly, we find <HI>Alphonsus</HI> King of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> being elected by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. received his Installation on the Prince's side, whose Predecessor was <HI>Thomas Beauchamp</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>In the second Place, if we descend to Foreign Princes, it is remarkable, that <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> elected by <HI>Richard</HI> II. was installed in that which Sir <HI>John Beau∣champ</HI> poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed, and <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland, Haynal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>

and <HI>Zealand,</HI> in that which appertained to Sir <HI>John Chan∣dos. Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> V. into the Stall of Sir <HI>John Clifford.</HI> And <HI>Anno</HI> 28 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> was elected into the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI>'s Stall.</P>
<P>And as the Statute was carefully observed, with refe∣rence to the Election and Installation of Foreign Prin∣ces, so no less in relation to the Princes of the Blood at Home; among whom let us observe, in the third Place, the ranking the Sons of the Founder of this most Noble Order; where we see <HI>Lyonel</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> his third Son, to have been installed in the sixth Stall on the Sovereign's side, whose immediate Predecessor was Sir <HI>John Beauchamp:</HI> In like manner <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> his fourth Son was instal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the seventh Stall on the Prince's side, having S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>Thomas Holland</HI> for his Predecessor and a Founder: His fifth Son <HI>Edmund Langley,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> possess'd the Stall Sir <HI>Hugh Courtney</HI> did before: And the sixth Son, <HI>Thomas Woodstock,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> enjoy'd the Stall Sir <HI>John Grey</HI> did before: This Rule was likewise observed strictly in relation to the Sons of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII.</P>
<P>If we review the aforesaid Tables, we shall find, that as the Knights-Companions of higher Dignity assumed the Stalls, (when they became vacant) though often of the lower sort, so some of the inferior rank among them have had the Honour to be installed in Seats of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uperior Class, and this by the virtue and due of the Law.</P>
<P>Amongst these Knights-Companions we shall enumerate Sir <HI>Philip la Vache,</HI> a <HI>Gascon,</HI> who, in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> II. was first installed in the Prince's Stall, (being vacant by the Death of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,)</HI> though af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards removed to the third Stall on the Sovereign's side. Sir <HI>Nicholas Sarnesfield,</HI> Standard-bearer to the Founder, who succeeded <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> and after him Sir <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il∣liam Arundel,</HI> immediate Successor to Sir <HI>Nich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>las,</HI> were both installed in the second Stall on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sovere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn's side: As likewise Sir <HI>John Robsart,</HI> Sir <HI>Gilbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Talbot,</HI> and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>John Grey,</HI> &amp;c. were installed in the second or third Stalls on the Sovereign's side.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="304"/>
These Instances already asserted, are sufficient to mani∣fest the Usage and Practice, how the Knights-Compani∣ons have succeeded in the Stalls of their immediate Pre∣decessors, down to the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and was consonant and agreeable to the ancient Law of the Order.</P>
<P>But we are to observe, that tho' each Knight was, by the before-mentioned Article, constituted to succeed his immediate Predecessor, in the Stall void by his Death, yet there's an excep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion as to that of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> This Stall is the first on the left Hand, at the entrance into the Choir of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Chappel</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and where n <HI>Edward</HI> the Black Prince was installed; from this Stall does the whole range of Stalls on the same side take their De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omination, and to which the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> as soon as he is elected into the Order, hath a due Title. Though this Stall <HI>de Jure</HI> appertains to that Prince, yet heretofore, when the Sovereign had no Heir, then was it for the present disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed to some other Knight, otherwise a defect in the full Number of Knights-Companions would have ensued.</P>
<P>The first that obtained that Honour, (besides the Prince of <HI>Wales,)</HI> was <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> decreed him by K. <HI>Richard</HI> II. who never had Issue, and removed from the seventh Stall thither. But the first Companion that happened to be instal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in it, was Sir <HI>Philip la Vache</HI> just mentioned, which was a great Honour done to one of his Rank: But it fell to him by the then Law of the Order, being elected into the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om of the said Duke, who di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d possessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it. But King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. coming to the Crown, and his eldest Son being created Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> laid claim to the Stall by Virtue of that Statute, and had it as∣signed to him.

<PB N="296" REF="306"/>
him the second Stall on the Sovereign's side, (wherein him∣self sat whilst Prince of <HI>Wales,)</HI> and where hitherto his Plate remains as a fixed Memorial of his Installation therein.</P>
<P>Although it has been made apparent, that the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> at their Election or Installation, succeeded the immediate <HI>defunct Knight</HI> in his Stall, yet we may ob∣serve, that sometimes after Installation, as an especial sig∣nal of Favour and Indulgence, the Sovereign hath been pleased, though very rarely, to advance a <HI>Knight-Com∣panion</HI> to a higher Stall than that wherein he was first placed; and though there be no such Permission granted by the Law of the Order, yet we find <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> removed from the seventh Stall on the Prince's side, to the Prince's Stall it self, and it's said to be done by the Decree of the Sovereign and the <HI>Knights-Compa∣nions.</HI> And no doubt but as this was done by so good Authority, and so upon no less enducements to the Sove∣reign, and the whole Society. We shall here mention a few of these extraordinary Cases. <HI>William Henalt,</HI> Earl of <HI>Ostervant,</HI> was advanced by King <HI>Richard</HI> II. from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's side, to the Duke of <HI>Britain</HI>'s, being the second on the Prince's side. <HI>Humphry</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was removed from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's side, to the second on the same side; and <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by the Consent of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> in Chapter, <HI>Anno</HI> 39 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. was translated to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Stall; the Lord <HI>Bonvil,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Scales</HI>'s Seat; Sir <HI>Thomas Kyriell,</HI> to the Place of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wenlock,</HI> to the Stall of Viscount <HI>Beaumont.</HI> But King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. thinking it requisite for the Sovereign of this most Noble Order, to be impow∣ered by a General, how to Act that at Pleasure, which the former Sovereigns did not, but by the Power of par∣ticular Acts, or Orders, in the Chapter; after he had confirmed the ancient Law of succeeding in the Stall of the immediate Predecessor, and not to suffer an alteration without the Sovereign's Licence, in the next Article he estab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished this Privilege upon Himself and Successors: <HI>That if there were any Place or Stall void, the Sovereign, at his own Pleasure, might Advance and Translate any Knight</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="307"/>
<HI>of the Society into the void Stall, so that it were higher than that, wherein he sate before.</HI></P>
<P>This in Effect did vacat the ancient Law of succeeding in Stalls, though at the same Time he seem'd to Confirm it to the <HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> for afterwards Translations pre∣ceeding to Installations, became so frequent, that the Right an <HI>elect Knight</HI> had to his Predecessor's Stall, was seldom enjoyed. However, hereby he confirmed a Power to gratify such of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> as he shou'd think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to advance, without having recourse to a Chapter; and from hence began the Custom to Issue out Warrants, under the Sovereign's <HI>Sign Manual,</HI> for the Translation of Stalls, and consequently the alteration and removal of such of the <HI>Knights-Companions Helms, Crests, Banners,</HI> and <HI>Plates,</HI> who shou'd receive a higher Exaltation.</P>
<P>Besides the Power established upon the Sovereigns of this most Noble Order, of translating Stalls, when a va∣cancy happened, they farther added this larger Preroga∣tive: That the Sovereign, once in his Life, might, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t pleased him, make a general Translation of all the Stalls at his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easure, except of Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Dukes, who shou'd keep their Stalls and Places, unless advanced to a higher Room and Stall. In which Trans∣lation, the long continuance in the Order, and the Praises, Worthiness, and Merits of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> were to be considered and remembred.</P>
<P>But this Branch of the Sovereign's Prerogative, as far as we can find, was never put in Execution, though the Translation, <HI>Anno</HI> 27 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. border'd something u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on it, perhaps left it might raise too great Feuds among the <HI>Knights-Subjects;</HI> forasmuch as that of translating only, (when there happened a vacancy,) begot great Emulations, which at length introduced a Change, to which we shall pass, after we have taken notice of a Clause added in the twenty second Article of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, re∣lating to Princes.</P>
<P>It is observable the ancient Law of succeeding in Stalls, in relation to them, was wholly altered. For King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. upon the Establishment of his Body of Sta∣tutes, not only appointed those Strangers, then present of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der, to be seated next himself; but that all Empe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Kings, and Princes, should hold their Stalls after their Estates, and the very next unto the Sovereign, tho'
<PB N="298" REF="308"/>
<HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> upon vacancy, become removable at Pleasure.</P>
<P>For this reason, the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> II. and after him <HI>Rudolph</HI> II. his Son, had the Prince's Stalls assigned them after their Election into the Order; and several of the Kings of <HI>France</HI> were placed in the next below, be∣ing the second on the Sovereign's side. And when there chanced to be more than one King at a time in the Or∣der, the second Stall on the Prince's side was assigned him; for Precedency was measured now by Dignity and State, and not by the Antiquity of the Order; As appears from the King of <HI>Bohemia, Anno</HI> 19 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and the King of <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Princes Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gers, accor∣ding to their regality, and illustrious extraction, had their Scituation next to Kings, as is manifest from the Dukes of <HI>Savoy, Montmorency,</HI> and <HI>Holstein, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince <HI>Palatine,</HI> and <HI>Maurice</HI> Prince of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ange, Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>
<P>But notwithstan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng these Assignments of Stalls to Stran∣gers, they were nevertheless subject to removal, sometimes to Stalls higher than their own, upon the Death of a Stranger, who died possessed of a superior one; and some∣times again to others lower, for the advancing a Knight of greater Degree and Distinction, where the upper Stalls were already supplied; else they could not be so ranked, according to their respective Quality, as the Statut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s en∣joyn; nor indeed wou'd any Stranger King have accep∣ted of an Election, unless he was placed in a distinguish∣able Stall, suitable to his Dignity. <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> is an instance of Advancement in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ansla∣tion of Stalls; for after the Death of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. his Brother, he was advanced from the second Stall on the Prince's side, into the Prince's Stall. And <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> from the second on the Sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> side, to the Prince's Stall, and <HI>Christierne</HI> IV. King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Denmark, Anno</HI> 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>
<P>Among Princes Strangers, we find <HI>Emanuel</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> advanced from the third on the Prince's side, to the second on the same side, <HI>Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederick</HI> Prince Palatine, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Charles</HI> I. was advanced f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the second of the Prince's, to the second on the side of the Sovereign; likewise <HI>Henry Frederick,</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince of <HI>Ora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge,</HI> was advanced from the third of the Sovereign's, to the
<PB N="299" REF="309"/>
second of the Prince's, upon the Death of the King of <HI>Sweden, Anno</HI> 10 <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>When the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> IX. was elected, <HI>Anno</HI> 6 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the superior Stalls were already filled with Strangers, and there was no Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edient left to give him the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all the Sovereign design'd him, but by the removal of some of those <HI>Knights-Strangers</HI> lower; and upon this, <HI>Emanuel</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was displaced to the third on the Sovereign's side.</P>
<P>But the <HI>French</HI> King was not installed, until the 16th of <HI>January, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and before that it was con∣cluded to remove the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Stall, as void before, and to instal the <HI>French</HI> King in the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s, which was accordingly done; so that upon this occasion, there were four Strangers, and five <HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> removed lower, to make way for the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
<P>The 20th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. The Duke of <HI>Wir∣temberg</HI> was installed in the third Stall on the Prince's side, and the Year following advanced to a higher.</P>
<P>The 26th of <HI>May</HI> ensuing, <HI>Ulerick</HI> Duke <HI>Holst,</HI> had as∣signed unto him that Stall from which the Duke of <HI>Wir∣tembe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g</HI> was advanced: But against the Installation of <HI>Christierne,</HI> the fourth King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Duke was removed back to his Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, wherein he was installed, and the Duke advanced into the vacant one.

<P>In this last Scheme, we find Prince <HI>Henry</HI> removed from the second on the Sovereign's, to the second on the Prince's side, to make room for the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI> And tho' the Duke <HI>Chevereux, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Charles</HI> I. was advanced from the third Stall on the Sovereign's side, to the second on the Prince's side, that became vacant by the Death of the Duke of <HI>Brunswick;</HI> yet the Year after, upon the ad∣mission of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> he was re∣moved two Stalls lower, and the Prince Elector Palatine one.</P>
<P>We pass on now from the removal and translation of a <HI>Knight-Subject,</HI> after he had been installed, to the assign∣ment of his Stall, at the Time of the Installation it self; where it is worthy of Remark, That on the 24th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 6 <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izabeth,</HI> in lieu of the ancient Law, which ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted each elect Knight to succeed in the Stall of his Predecessor, a new one was introduced, being composed, as was conceived, upon a more just level than the former, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as far as was possible, to extinguish all danger that might ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se from Emulation.

<P>Upon which it chanced, that when a <HI>Knight-Subject</HI> elect was to be installed, all the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een him and the vacant Stall, were removed higher, that the space might be supplied: And if two or more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere to be installed together, they possessed the lowest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, according to the Seniority of their Election.

<HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Reign, the <HI>Knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s-Subjects</HI> Helms were parcel gilt with fine Gold in Oil, wrought with curious Works, and burnished with fine Gold. But in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and since that Time, it hath been the Custom to gild their Helms all over, and place the Arms of St. <HI>George</HI> in the Middle before the Vizors.</P>
<P>The Mantlings that hang down on either side of the Helm, together with the Wreath, are in some places cal∣led Appendixes, and are all of Tissue, or Cloth of Gold, and formerly lined with Sarcenet; but in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> they were exchanged for white Satin, for so were the Mantlings of <HI>Anthony B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own,</HI> Viscount <HI>Monta∣gue,</HI> and <HI>William Howard,</HI> Lord Admiral, lined.</P>
<P>At the bottom of these Mantlings hang a pair of gilt Knobs burnished with Gold, from which spring out Tos∣sels either of Gold or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lver, (consentaneous to the Metal in the Knights Court of Armour) mixed with Silk of the chief Colour in his Arms.</P>
<P>Upon the Helm and Mantlings, is placed a Wreath of corded Silk, of the Knight's Colou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which was formerly of Sarcenet, but now of Taffety.</P>
<P>The Crest of the Knight is placed either upon these W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaths, or Issuant out of a Crown, or Ducal Cap, turn∣ed with Ermin; and of what kind s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever the Crest is, the same is neatly carved in Wood, and either gilt, or wrought in; Directly before the Helm, an armed Sword hangs down, the Pomel, Cross, and Chape are gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; the Scabbard is made of the same Tissue or Cloth of Gold as the Mantlings are, as is the Girdle that belongs to it; but the Buckles and Pendants are of Copper Gilt.</P>
<P>The Custom of setting up the He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, Crest, and Sword, over the Stall of the Knights, is as ancient as the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stitu∣tion of the Order; but when the Banners were first hung up, we have not so clear a Conviction; for neither the Statutes of Institution, nor those of <HI>Henry</HI> V. make men∣tion of them.</P>
<P>The first time they occur to us, we find to be in <HI>Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. in the black Book of the Order, where the Banners of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> is particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poke of, among the Atchievements then set over the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all: But they are more particularly mentioned in the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="322"/>
The Fashion of the Sovereign's and all the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Banners are square; yet it does no where ap∣pear what the exact Standard was; yet we find them in the Reign of Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to be two Yards and a Quar∣ter Long, and a Yard and three Quarters Broad, besides the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inge, which is composed of Gold, or Silver and Silk, of the Colours in the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath; and on them are wrought, upon Taffety-Sarcenet, double Sarcenet, or rich Taffety, with fine Gold Colours on both sides, the Pate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nal Coat of the <HI>Knights-Companion,</HI> toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her with his Quartering, or so many of them as he pleases to use, and the Garter is to take care they be warrantably Marshalled.</P>
<P>And because a si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gle Coat was not conceived to stand fair enough in a Banner of this proportion, the Sovereign hath been pleased to grant a new Coat, to bear in Quar∣ters his Paternal one, if he wanted it; as King <HI>James</HI> I. did to <HI>Robert Carr,</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochester;</HI> to who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Pater∣nal Coat he fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st added a Lion Passant, Gardant Or, in the dexter Part, as an especial Gift of his Favour, and then invented a new C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, to be born in Quarter there∣with, <HI>viz.</HI> Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arterly Or and Gules, a Lyon Rampant Sab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e over all, <HI>June</HI> 8. <HI>Anno</HI> 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>
<P>These Banners of Arms are fixed to the End of long S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aves, painted in Oil, formerly of the Colour of the Wreaths, but now Red; their Ends are put into Socke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Iron, well fixed in the Wall, directly over the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Helms and Crests, and frequently lined with Fustian to preserve them.</P>
<P>There is moreover to be provided a Copper Plate Gilt, whereupon are engraved, the Escutcheon of the Knights elect Arms in Colours Enamilled, with his Quartering, Helm, Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and Supporters, and underneath, his Style and Titles of Honour, enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cled with a Garter. Which Plate the Garter usually takes Care to provide, and is to be fixed on the back of the Knights Stall, assigned for his Installat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</P>
<P>A Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>et Cushion is likewise to be provided, to carry the Knight's el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct Mantle, Collar, Hood, and Book of Statutes, before h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, in the Progress into the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, in order to his Installation. At the Installation of the Lord Treasurer <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ston,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Exeter</HI> and <HI>Lindsey,</HI> who were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stalled, <HI>Anno</HI> 6 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the mater<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als and gar∣nishing of these Cushions are recited severally, to contain
<PB N="313" REF="323"/>
one Yard and a Half of Crimson Velvet, one Ell of rich Taffety for their Lining, four Yards of Fringe, and four great Tossels.</P>
<P>Lastly, There have frequently been made ready a con∣venient Number of Lodging Escutcheons of the elect Knights Arms, invironed with a Garter, and his Stile and Titles placed underneath; it having been an ancient Cu∣stom, for the Knights to distribute these Escutcheons at the Inns, in their Passage to, and at <HI>Windsor,</HI> as a Me∣morial of their Installation.</P>
<P>What falls under the Care of the Garter to prepare and make ready, the Expence sometimes has been cast up, and the Account stated and defraid before-hand; by which means, he was in a better capacity to furnish out the Ce∣remony, for so did the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumber∣land, Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these mentioned to be prepared and provided either by the Chancellor of the Order, or the Garter, the Knight elect must take care of other Affairs more par∣ticularly relating to himself and his retinue; such as are Apparel, the Number of his Attendants and Servants, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th their Cloaths and Liveries, his Coach and Saddle Horses, both for himself and them, with other material Circumstances, to set off his Cavalcade and Proceeding with greater Pomp and Gallantry. The Provisions for Dyet at <HI>Windsor</HI> (if the Feast be kept at the elect Knight's Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge and Expence,) are to be considered of, and very o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten some Clark of the Sovereign's Kitchin is to be con∣sulted, in the management of that Affair.</P>
<P>The Hall or Room where the grand Dinner is to be kept, as well as the Chapter-House and Chappel, ought chiefly to be decked and adorned with rich and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umptuous Fur∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture, against this Solemnity, over and above what is commonly used. The Hall or Dining-Room is to be set off with rich Hangings; and if the Sovereign or his Lieu∣tenant hold the Feast, there must be placed a Cloth of State at the upper End of it. The Chapter-House is also to be hung, and a rich Carpet spread upon the Table, set about with Velvet Chairs and Cushions; and because in the late Times of Rebellion and Plunder, this Place was not exempr. and nothing was found there upon the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uration; King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in a Chapter convened the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>January, Anno</HI> 14th of his Reign, caused Directions

<P>Against the Installation of <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. The Table in the Chapter-House was covered with Cloth of Gold, and the Forms with Baudkin; before the Sovereign was laid a Cushion of Cloth of Gold, whereupon a Crucifix lay, and the Evangelist turned open to a place of the Cannon, with several Tapers burning on either Side. At the upper End of the Table, towards the Right Hand, was set a Chair for the Sovereign, under a golden Canopy, with Cushions of Cloth of Gold, and on the Left Hand a Stool with like Embellishments, for the King of <HI>Castile.</HI></P>
<P>In St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Chappel,</HI> the High Altar is to be richly adorned with Plate, the Sovereign's Stall with a Canop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and other usual Ornaments, and the Stalls of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> present at the Ceremony, with Velvet Cush∣ions.

<HEAD>CAP. XII. The Personal Installation of a Knight-Subject.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§ 1. FOrmerly the Knights elect proceeded from <HI>London</HI> to their Installation at <HI>Windsor,</HI> in the nature of a Solemn and stately Cavalcade, which was performed on Horse-back, with the greatest Grandeur, and exceeding Pomp, whether we refer to the great Number of their Honourable Friends, who, on gallant Coursers, rode along with them; or the multitude of their own Attendants well mounted, the magnificence of whose Apparel, Jewels, Gold Chains, rich Embroi∣deries, and Plumes of Feathers, of their Lord's Colours, struck Amazement, and even dazled the Eyes of the Spectators.</P>
<P>Equivalent to this Pompous Show was the Feast, which contained in it all manner of Stateliness and Plenty, as well of Provision, as other Incidents that might increase its Glory, in which the elect Knights, who kept it at their own Expence, strove not only to out-vie their Predecessor, but to Excel one another; That all Embas∣sadors and Strangers esteemed it one of the goodliest and noblest Sights, that was to be exhibited in Christendom.</P>
<P>But to make the splendor of the Cavalcade no less conspicuous to the City of <HI>London,</HI> than to the Town and Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> the Knights elect have taken up their Lodgings, sometimes in the <HI>Strand,</HI> sometimes in <HI>Salis∣bury-Court,</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> or within the City; and for intent they chose to pass through some Eminent Streets, that the People might the better Survey them, and receive the

greater Satisfaction. To illustrate which Matter, we shall descend to some Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz. Gilbert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> in order to his Cavalcade, was lodged in Mr. <HI>Gresham</HI>'s House, (now known by the Name of <HI>Gresham-College,)</HI> whence he Rode through the City, accompanied with many of his Honou∣rable Friends, and a numerous and gallant Train of At∣tendants and Servants, to <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> where he met <HI>George,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> (his Companion elect) and thence both Rode together towards <HI>Windsor;</HI> within a Mile or two of which Place, Garter King of Arms me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, and Marshalled their Attendants in Order; and then the elect Knights proceeded with their gallant Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n through the Town into the Castle in this Order.</P>

<P>Custom and Peace contributed to make the Cavalcades more glorious, during the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> I. and especially that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> Viscount <HI>Bindon, May</HI> 21st, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no</HI> 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. who arrived at <HI>Windsor</HI> honourabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣nied, with a great appearance of Nobility, Knights, and Gentlemen of Figure.</P>
<P>But the Fate of this Solemnity, much like that glorious Body of the Sun, (whose Lustre at such times it stro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to outshine) had now and then its interpositions, and in∣termitting Clouds, at other times long Nights, and the Splendor and Glory thereof but struck the Sight now and then; when the Pleasure of the Sovereign grew au∣spicious, or the Honour of the Order became fixed upon more generous S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irits. But to speak im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artially, there may grow an Excess in such Solemnities, even to Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me and Surfeit; and the best Cure to prescribe for it, is a long Abstinence.

from this Distemper, but then a quick Application of the Sovereign's soon rectified it by taking away the Cause, and prohibiting Excess in their Attendants.</P>
<P>For this reason it was that King <HI>James</HI> I. observing those Excesses the elect Knights run in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o upon this Oc∣casion, and willing to cheque the growing Inconveniencies, at the Installation, of <HI>Francis,</HI> Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> Sir <HI>George Villars,</HI> Kt.

</LETTER>
<P>When this Letter was issued out, the Sovereign in∣tended to create the Prince Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> which Ceremonies were intended to begin at the old <HI>Palace-yard</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> upon the 21st Day of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Car</HI> I. and to Solemnize the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> upon the 23d of the same Month at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and to take the Scru∣tiny that Evening for his Election into this Order: The next Day was designed to invest him with the Garter and George, and the Day after to set forward the Caval∣cade towards <HI>Windsor,</HI> wherein also the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> (intended to be created with the Prince,) were to Ride with their Robes. But this Resolution being alter∣ed, stop'd the Progression of the Cavalcade, and in the room of a Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> he was created a <HI>Knight-Batchellor</HI> at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly it was the manner for the Sovereign's Lieu∣tenant to Ride to <HI>Windsor,</HI> attended with a gallant and glittering Train, and no small Number of his own Gen∣tlemen and Yeomen richly attired, and in every Punctilio
<PB N="321" REF="331"/>
lio fifty set out, as was seen in the Cavalcade of the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> Earl Marshal of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gland,</HI> and Lieutenant for the Sovereign, for St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast, <HI>Anno</HI> 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> who had attending him twenty of his own Gentlemen and Yeomen, at the Time the Earls of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> were to be installed; but this was never put in Practice, but when the Sovereign appointed the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stalla∣tion and the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> to be celebrated toge∣ther.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant, and his Assistants, or sometimes the <HI>Knights-Commissioners,</HI> (if the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> be not then Solemnized,) being arrived in the Castle, imme∣diately retire to their Lodgings, which for the most part have been prepared at the <HI>Dean's House,</HI> whose Rooms are the fairest in the Castle, and the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tted for Ac∣commodation, next to tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Sovereign's in the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per Ward; and for the Knights elect, they were at all Times furnished with Lodgings in some of the Prebends Houses.</P>

<P>§ 2. If it so chanced that the Installation was performed by Commissioners, and the Cavalcade proceeded from <HI>London,</HI> in the Morning of the Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>receeding the Instal∣lation, and arrived at the Castle of <HI>Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sor</HI> early that Afternoon; then the <HI>Knights-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmissioners</HI> have been ac∣customed only to put on their Mantles, and ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r St. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rge</HI>'s Chappel to offer; but without the Attendance of Heralds, or any solemn Procession into the Choir, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e one of the Prebends; where having placed themselves in their Stalls with usual Reverences, and heard an Anth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y passed up to the Altar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the Verger and Garter befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them, and there made their Offeri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, both of Gold and Silver, according to the usual Custom. As soon as <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spers</HI> were finished, after the same manner they descend∣ed from their Stalls, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arted to their Lodgings; and in this case the <HI>Knights-Commissioners</HI> did not lay by their Mantles till Supper was ended.</P>
<P>In this nature was the Ceremony of Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring (on the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Insta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation) perform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Lord Adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ral and Earl of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mond,</HI> Commissioners for the Inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion

of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumberland, Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> But at the Installation of the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> others, <HI>Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Lord <HI>Hunsdon</HI> (one of the Com∣missioners for that Solemnity,) refused to make h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fering alone, though he arrived timely enough, on the Eve o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Feast at <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, because he wanted the Company of Viscount <HI>Mountague,</HI> who was a joynt Com∣missioner with him, that arrived not till the Morning after.</P>
<P><HI>This Offering of the</HI> Knights-Commissioners, <HI>coming to the Castle on the Eve of the Installation, is founded upon an Article of</HI> Edward <HI>III. which runs to this Effect:</HI> That if any of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> being upon a Journey, shou'd accident<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly pass by <HI>Windsor-Castle,</HI> he is to turn in thither, in Honour of the Place, and prepare himself to enter into the Chappel to Offer; first putting on his Mantle, without which he must never presume to enter into it; <HI>but upon Emergencies, and allowable Causes, he is to be ex∣cused.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> had entered the Castle, the Canons Resident were, by the aforesaid Article, ap∣pointed to meet and recieve him, and with due Reve∣rence conduct him into the Choir. If it was at the Celebration of High Mass, the Knight was obliged to stay and hear it, in Honour of God and St. <HI>George;</HI> but if he arrived in the Afternoon, he was to stay till the Canons, and the rest of the Choir, had sung the Anth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <HI>de Pro∣fundis,</HI> which no s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oner was ended, but he proceeded to the High Altar and Offered, and returned to his Stall with u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual Reverences, and then departed.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> passed through the Town of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indsor,</HI> and neglected to Offer at the Chappel, as of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en as he o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he was bound, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on his Obedience, to walk a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e on F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pel, in Honour of St. <HI>Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on defailure, to offer a Peny, which by King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> VIII's Statutes is inlarged to a Croat. Upon the Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cation of this Article, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere arose a Dis∣pute about the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Distance intended from the Castle; and that the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights-Companions might be sensible o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of the Inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nction, it was thought requisite by King <HI>Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> VIII. to set down a certain Bound, which in his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utes is declared to be two Miles; within which, if any of the <HI>Knights-Compani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> come, and do not repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r

to the Chappel and Offer, he is liable to the Mulct be∣fore specified.</P>
<P>Upon Hunting, or other Pastimes the Forest afforded, they used to send their Offering in Money to the Canons, which being received, the Knights took it for a Dispen∣sation of the Ceremony enjoined by the Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</P>
<P>Endeavours were used to have this Article interpreted with greater Latitude, which so far took Effect, that at a Chapter called at <HI>Windsor</HI> the 10th of <HI>October, Anno</HI> 15 <HI>Car</HI> I. it was ordered, that some Expedient might be found out, to save the Knights from the Breach of their Oath, if they came within the limited Distance of the Place, and passed thence without Offering. But no far∣ther Progress being made in that Affair, the Law stands as it did.</P>

<HEAD>The Supper of the Eve.</HEAD>
<P>§ 3. The Supper, after their arrival at <HI>Windsor,</HI> is but in the Nature of a private Meal, and prepared for the Lieutenant (or Commissioners) or Knights elect, most commonly at the Dean's House. <HI>Anno</HI> 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI> on the Eve of the Installation of the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> and Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> the Commissioners su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ped together with such Lords and Gentlemen of Figure as came along with them; and no Nobleman had above one Servant to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tend him at the Table, and the rest provided for them∣selves at their proper Inns. Sometimes they have been permitted to Sup in some Appartments of the Sovereign's Lodgings; for so it was at the Installation of the Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> and other elect Knights, <HI>Anno</HI> 31 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and likewise of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and Lord <HI>Hunsd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Lieutenant and Knights supped in the great Chamber there, in the same Regularity that was used at other Times.

<HEAD>The Order in proceeding to the Chapter-House.</HEAD>
<P>§ 4. Before we come to the particular Ceremonies of the Installation, transacted either by the Sovereign, (or in his absence by his Lieutenant or Commissioners,) we shall premise this general Remark: That since neither the Statutes of <HI>Institution,</HI> nor those of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. afford us a Formulary for the Personal Installation of a Knight elect; yet those enacted by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. do briefly exhibit the Order and Method of it. And we must farther observe, that if the Installation be appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether with the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> then either the So∣vereign, or else his Lieutenant and Assistants are present; but if at any other Season, then it passeth by Commis∣sioners only.</P>
<P>After such time therefore as the Sovereign, his Lieute∣nant, or Commissioners, have prefixed the Hour wherein to proceed to the Chapter House, in Order to the Instal∣lation, (which has generally been dispatched in the Even∣ing,) all the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and elect Knights, the Officers of the Order, and of Arms, the Prebends of the College, and Alms-Knights, are to give their Attendance, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knights-Companions, and elect Knights, and Officers, of the Order, on the Sovereign, in his inward Lodging; the elect Knights, and Officers of Arms, in the Presence Chamber, the Prebends and Alms-Knights, in the Great Chamber, where they waited the Sovereign's coming forth.</P>
<P>The Attendance to be given upon the Sovereign's Lieu∣tenant, and such of the Knights-Companions as are appoin∣ted for his Assistants, is by the Officers of the Order and of Arms, the Prebends and Alms-Knights, either at his Lodgings, or elsewhere he shall deem meet to appoint; from which the Knights-Companions are exempt. For though the Knights-Companions have sometimes pro∣ceeded to the Chappel before the Sovereign's Lieutenant, at an Installation, yet hath it been at such time only, as they accompanied their Sovereign to <HI>Windsor,</HI> to hold the Feast of St. <HI>George;</HI> and if the Sovereign, through any In∣dispositio<SUP>n</SUP>, or weighty Affair, cou'd not pass down to the Chappel on the Eve of the Feast, yet they being obliged

by the Statutes to celebrate <HI>Vespers,</HI> did upon this Oc∣casion proceed thither, though not upon the Account of Installation; as it fell out at the Installation of Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> and four other Knights, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. when the Progression began from the Presence Chamber, and thence passed to the Chappel in the following Order.</P>

<P>If the Progression was begun on Horse-back at the be∣ginning of the Feast, so it continued, as often as the Sove∣reign (his Lieutenant or Commissioner) went to the Chap∣ter-House, or Chappel, and their returns were marshalled in the like Order at their setting out.</P>
<P>The Servants and Attendants belonging to the Knights elect, (if they be taken into the Procession,) pass on first two and two in a Rank, according to their Quality; and those who are the most inferior, the foremost: Next the Alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Knights in their Habits and usual Order.</P>

be present at the same time, he is to proceed between the Knight-Subject's Proctor, and the Knights-Subject elect. But Prince <HI>Henry</HI> at his Installation, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. moved in a Place Superior to all the Knights-Companions, and was paired with the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Sove∣reign's Lieutenant for that Occasion. Where two or more elect Knights prepare for their Installation at the same time, they take Place according to the Seniority of their Election, going two and two together; and if the Num∣ber be odd, the Junior elect Knight pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth alone. For∣merly the elect Knight passed in his ordinary Apparel, wearing over it in Days of Yore a short Gown, after∣wards a Cloak, and of latter Times a Coat, as did the Earl of <HI>Northumberland, Anno</HI> 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Pembrook</HI> and <HI>Derby, Anno</HI> 16 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and the Annals of the Order make this remark upon the Earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Buckhurst, Anno</HI> 31 of <HI>Eliz.</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>York, An.</HI> 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. But this was before any peculiar under Habi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, was appointed to the Knights-Companions, for now there being a Cloth of Silver Doublet, and Trunk Hose, esta∣blished to be worn at the Feast of Installation, and of St. <HI>George,</HI> the elect Knight proceeds in this Dress, as did the Duke of <HI>Albermarle, Anno</HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>
<P>In this proceeding to the Chapter-House, he wears only the Garter about his Leg, and the George and the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b∣bond wherewith he was invested, either about his Neck, or as of late drawn under his right Arm, which being o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted by Sir <HI>George Villars,</HI> and Viscount <HI>Lisle,</HI> is noted to be contrary to order.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> with his Fellow elect Knights, <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. proceeded Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-headed, as did the Duke of <HI>Lenox, Anno</HI> 9 <HI>Car.</HI> I. as well as the Duke of <HI>Alber∣marle, Anno</HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>
<P>The elect Knight does not always make one in this Proceeding, but sometimes stays at his Lodgings in the Castle, as did the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumberland, Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> or else at some other convenient Station adjoining to the Chapter-House, till he be sent for in thi∣ther, to receive Investiture with the Surcoa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Montmorency</HI> did, and other elect Knights, <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Eliz.</HI> who went privately from the Sovereign's Lodgings, down to the House of Mr. <HI>French,</HI> (then one of the Pre∣bends,) and rested in the Parlour, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il they were sent

<P>If the Sovereign be present at the Installation, the Knights-Companions proceed next after the Knights elect, according to the order of their Stalls; but if the Sovereign's Lieutenant, then his Assistants go in their Places; as at the Installation of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and Lord <HI>Hunsdon, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> makes plain, the proceeding being ordered after this manner.</P>

<P>Yet <HI>Anno</HI> 16 <HI>Eliz.</HI> at t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Installation of the Earls of <HI>Pembrook</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> we find the Officers did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>recede the elect Knights, but it was through inadvertency; at the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stallation of the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> some Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estion and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate arose, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncerning the precedency of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e three Officers, in this proceeding, where it was at length concluded, that from the Castle to the Chappel, they shou'd proceed before the Commissioners; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut in return∣ing from the Chappel to the Castle, they shou'd follow.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="339"/>
We presume the Question, (whatsoever it was) chanced not to be propounded, till the proceeding was ready to pass on, and then started on a sudden, because the Heralds (as the Annals note,) did not quickly discypher the mat∣ter, that it proceeded more from surprize, than want of Ability to resolve.</P>
<P>This determination which took Place, was barely grounded upon Conjecture, and if seriously considered, will appear disconsonant to Precedents and Practice, both before and since; where all returns are marshalled an∣swerable to their setting forth, unless the Condition of any Person in the mean time suffer a Mutation.</P>
<P>It's observable, that when Installation pass by Com∣missioners only, these three inferior Officers wear their Robes, but bear not the Ensigns of their Office in the Proceeding. And this seems to be deduced from par∣ticular Injunctions, laid down in the Constitutions be∣longing to the Officers of the Order, which appoint Gar∣ter an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Black-Rod to bear the Ensigns of their Offices at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> when the Sovereign or his De∣puty shall be present; whence it may be inferred, that if either chance to be absent, they are under no obligation to bear th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m: For at the Installations of <HI>Frederick,</HI> King of <HI>Denma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> and <HI>John Casimire,</HI> Count Palatine of the Rhine, <HI>Anno</HI> 25 <HI>Eliz.</HI> no Ensigns were born by the Of∣ficers; and so was it practised the Year after, at the In∣stallations of the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> and Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> as the Red-B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok of Order plainly sets forth. But if the Sove∣reign hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self be present, or that he constitute a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eute∣nant in his stead, the Register then carries the Red-Book, and the Garter and the Black-Rod bear each of them their R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds. It is remarkable, that in every proceeding to In∣stallati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lieutenant, or Commissioners, the Garter c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es the Sovereign's Commission in his Hand before them to the Chapter-Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.

At this Solemnity of Installation, the Sovereign proceeds in full Robes, having the Sword of State bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n before him by a Nobleman not of the Order, his Train∣bearers, &amp;c. following the Sovereign's Lieutenant and his Assistants, as also the Commissioners proceed in full Robe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which is mention'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 31 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> and his Assistants installed the Lord <HI>Russel</HI> and two other elect Knights, but the Sovereign's Lieutenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

only hath his Train carried up, which is usually per∣form'd by some of his own Gentlemen.</P>
<P>The Processional way (if beginning in the Presence-Chamber,) is from thence in the upper Ward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Castle, and through the other Wards in at the Cloyster D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, and so to the Chapter-House; but if from the Dean's House, they go only through the Cloysters, into which there is an immediate Passage from the Deanry: The proceeding having entred the East Door of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Chapel, and past by the Chapter-House Door, makes a stand in the North Isle; while first the Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of the Order, next the Knights-Commissioners, or else the Knights-Assistants, and the Sovereign's Lieutenant; or lastly the Knights-Companions, and the Sovereign with the Sword born be∣fore him, pass into the Chapter-House, but the Knight or Knights elect do not enter, but as they come in at the Chapel-Door, they fall off on the left Hand into the East Isle behind the high Altar, and there repose themselves, (on Chairs or Stools, with Cushions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urposely prepared,) until they are called into the Chapter-House. This hath generally been the Custom, of which many Examples might be produced, but in respect to great Personages they have been sometimes (though rarely) admitted into the Chap∣ter-House, with the Sovereign or his Lieutenant, among whom <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and Prince <HI>Henry, Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the latter was led in by the Sovereign's Lieutenant, when four other elect Knights insta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with him sat till they receiv'd their Summons to enter.</P>

<P>§ 5. After the Lieutenant's entrance into the Chapter-House, and opening the Chapter; Garter, with three Reverences, presents first the Commissioners of Lieute∣nancy to hold the Feast, next that of Installation, to the Lieutenant, (or if the Installation pass'd by Commissioners, then only the Commission of Installation to the Senior Commissioner,) which being receiv'd, he delivers it to the Register of the Order, who forthwith Reads it; for to him this Duty belongs, as is recorded in the Black-Book of the Order, on occasion of Garter's reading the Com∣mission for Installation of Sir <HI>Thomas Brandon, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. the Register being then absent.</P>
<P>When the Register hath read the Commissions, he re∣turns them to the Lieutenant, (or Commissioners,) and he again to the Garter, as at the Installation of the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumberland, Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> If the Sove∣reign be present, the Chancellor acquaints him the Knights elect are without, otherwise the Lieutenant, and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sist∣ants, (or Commissioners) consult touching the calling in, and receiving them, and Garter is usually employed in this Service; who, with all due respect, compliments and con∣ducts him to the Chapter-House Door: But in the in∣stance of the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumberland</HI> aforesaid, Garter went to their Lodgings, and having delivered his Message, they forthwith repaired to the Chapter-House, their Train attending them to the Door: At the Instal∣lation of <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> then the Sovereign's Lieutenant, as an evidence of singular respect, sent from the Chapter two of the four Assistants assigned him, who taking Garter, and the Of∣ficers of Arms before them, led him thence between them to the Chapter-House.</P>
<P>When there are two or more elect Knights, that wait in the East Isle, expecting to be called i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Garter first c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ducts the Senior by Election to the Chapter-House Door, and so the rest in their several Orders, as in 14 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. by the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> Sir <HI>George Villars,</HI> and the Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣count <HI>Lisle;</HI> and so again 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II.

Door, two of the Commissioners, (when the Installation is performed by Commissioners,) or two of the Knights-Assistants, (when by the Sovereign's Lieutenant,) or two of the Senior Knights, (if the Sovereign himself be pre∣sent,) receive him without, who is immediately conducted from the Chapter-House Door, up to the Sovereign, (his Lieutenant, or Commissioners,) to whom he makes hum∣ble Reverence; when the Lieutenant, (or Senior Com∣missioners,) in a short Speech, publishes the effect of his Commission, and declares to him the Sovereign's bounty and ready kindness, in a full admittance into this Honou∣rable Society, which the elect Knight very humbly ac∣knowledges and accepts. When <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon</HI> was installed in Person, <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. the Sovereign being present rose from his Throne, and gave him Information of the Statutes and Ceremonies of the Order, and how he was bound by them; to all which he freely and readily assented.</P>
<P>These Ceremonies of receiving an elect Knight being over, he disrobes himself of his upper Garment, then the Surcoat and Kirtle is taken from the Table, with which he is invested; and during this Ceremony, the following Words of Admonition, entred at the end of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Book of English Statutes, are read or spoken.</P>
<P>Take this Robe of Purple, to the encrease of your Honour, and in Token, or Sign, of the most Honourable Order you have receiv'd; wherewith you being defended, may be bold not only strong to Fight, but also to offer your self to shed your Blood f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Christ's Faith, the Liberties of the Church, and the just and necessary defence of them that are oppressed and needy.</P>
<P>After this, his Sword is close girt about him over his Surcoat, by the Commissioners, (or the Assistants to the Lieutenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or some of the Knights-Companions,) and sometimes in the way of assistance, Garter hath done this Service; and as soon as the Ceremony is over, the Sove∣reign, or his Lieutenant, proceeds into the Choir, leaving the elect Knights behind them: The Hood was hereto∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore put on in the Chapter-House, (for so the Statutes of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. do appoint,) after the elect Knight hath been invested with his Surcoat, and before he pro∣ceeded to his Installation; but of late, because it must be
<PB N="334" REF="344"/>
taken off again in the Choir, and laid aside, that the Mantle may be put on, it hath been esteemed a sort of di∣minution in the Investiture to take off any part of the Habit before the whole Investiture be compleated; so that in the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. it was judged more convenient that the Hood should be carried on the Cushion by Garter into the Choir, together with the Man∣tle and Collar, and not be put on till after Investiture with the Mantle; and thus it was observed at the Feasts of St. <HI>George,</HI> 13, 15, and 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. And though anti∣ently it was laid over the left Shoulder, and so worn upon all Occasions, yet <HI>Anno</HI> 2 and 3 <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> the wear∣ing it so being taken notice of to obscure the Escutcheon of St. <HI>George,</HI> embroidered on the same Shoulder of the Mantle, it was decreed in a Chapter held the same Year, 22 of <HI>April,</HI> that for the future the Knights-Companions should wear their Hoods on their right Shoulders, to the end that the Escutcheon might be the better seen and ap∣pear.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there was a Question moved 12 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. whether the usage of wearing the Hood should not be re∣stored to the left Shoulder, but it seems it was over-ruled; and 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. some of the Knights-Companions ima∣gining it most proper to wear their Hoods on their left Shoulders, ran into that error, but upon better informa∣tion the next Morning, altered them to the right. To Foreign Princes, there is liberty given by King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII's Statutes to receive, if they please, their Habit wholly within the Chapter-House, before they enter their Stalls; by which it appears that this was the Custom in times past; an instance whereof we have in <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Castile, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who was entirely invested in the Chapter-House with the Garter, Surcoat, Mantle, Hood, and Collar; the Sovereign himself putting his Hand to his Investiture with the Mantle. Hence King <HI>Philip,</HI> Grandson to the aforesaid King of <HI>Castile,</HI> was invested with the whole Habit of the Order before he assumed the Stall; in <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI>'s proceeding to the Chapel, he receiv'd his Investiture within the West Door, and there the Register delivered the Mantle to the Earls of <HI>Derby</HI> and <HI>Pembrook,</HI> who kissing it, presented it to the Queen, who, assisted by the said Earls, personally invested the King therewith: Next Garter gave the Collar to the

Earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Pembrook,</HI> who likewise presented it to the Queen, and she thereon put it about King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Neck; and immediately the Knights-Companions, hav∣ing robed themselves within the Chapel Door, proceeded before the King and Queen, who with joined Hands pas∣sed into the Choir, where the Queen led him to the So∣vereign's Stall, which ascending, they both sat therein. But as the aforesaid Statute leaves this to the pleasure of the Stranger Prince, and was permitted only for gaining Time, so none, who have receiv'd personal Installation at <HI>Windsor</HI> since, have been fully invested before they entered the Choir. For instance, <HI>Francis,</HI> Duke <HI>de Montmorency,</HI> 14 <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz.</HI> and <HI>Frederick,</HI> Prince Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 10 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. were both invested with their Surcoats only in the Chapter-House, but they receiv'd their Mantles, Hoods, and Collars, in their Stalls, after they had taken their Oaths.</P>

<HEAD>The proceeding into the Choir.</HEAD>
<P>§ 6. The Knight elect, habited as before, proceeds from the Chapter-House along the North Isle, and enters the West Door of the Choir in solemn Order; but his Place in this proceeding is changed, for here he is led be∣tween two Knights-Companions. This is noted in the Black-Book to be the Order wherein <HI>Albra Vasques d'Al∣madea,</HI> Earl of <HI>Averence,</HI> and two others, proceeded to their Installations, 24 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. And notwithstanding the Statutes of Institution, and those made by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. are silent in the Order of this Proceeding; yet for an elect Knight to be led to his Stall between two fellow Knights, is no modern Ceremony; since we likewise find, that the Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>count <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urchier,</HI> 30 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. past to his Instalment between the Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> and Lord <HI>Beauchamp.</HI> But the Order of proceeding is precisely set down in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes, <HI>viz. That the elect Knight, at∣tended by his Gentlemen and Servants, shall be led between two other Knights-Companions, the Officers of the Order going before them.</HI> And this has been the constant Pra∣ctice at all Installations since; the Knight elect pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeding, either between two of the Knights-Commissioners, when there hath been no Lieutenant, or between two of the
<PB N="336" REF="346"/>
Knights Assistants, where a Lieutenant was constituted; or lastly between the two Senior Knights-Companion<SUP>s</SUP>, the Sovereign being present: But when there hath bee<SUP>n</SUP> three Commissioners named, then the two Senior Com∣missioners take the Knight elect between them, and the Junior Knight-Commissioner proceeds before them; which was observed at the Instalment of the Earls of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Ormond,</HI> and Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton,</HI> 30 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>In all cases where the Sovereign is present at an Instal∣lation, after the custom of investing with the Collar in the Chapter-House was left off, it is generally to be ob∣served, that as soon as the Investiture with the Surcoat is finished, the Sovereign passes from the Chapter-House into the Choir, with the whole proceeding before him, leaving the elect Knight behind; and when he and the Knights-Companions have taken their Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, the two Senior Knights-Companions, by the Sovereign's verbal Directions, descend from their Stalls, and stand under their Banners, whilst the Alms-Knights, but not the Pre∣bends, Officers of Arms, and the three inferior Officers of the Order, pass out of the Choir, and proceed before them to the Chapter-House, from whence they introduce the elect Knight into the Choir to his Installation; but if there be more than one Knight installed, then the two next Senior Knights descend, and so the next, till all the elect Knights are conducted in: And this course is like∣wise observed when a Lieutenant is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstituted, and hath been generally so practised since the Investiture with the Collar was performed in the Choir; and particularly at the Installations of the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <HI>Pem∣brook, Marr,</HI> and <HI>Southamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and of the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> 3 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. In this proceeding to Installation, the Register usually carries a Book of the New Testament, for the elect Knight to take his Oath on, as likewise the Oath it self, fairly written on Parchment: Garter bears his Mantle till he arrives at his Stall; and King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes place this Ser∣vice upon some of the Knights-Companio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s likewise; but it never appears that it was ever performed by any of them. 'Tis probable, that about the time when this In∣junction passed, it was the Custom for Garter to bear the Mantle on his Arm; for so it was at the Installation of the Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> and others, 31 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. but it was
<PB N="337" REF="347"/>
not long after, that the laying it on a Velvet Cushion be∣gan. The great Collar of the Order was likewise laid upon the Cushion, at the Installation of Sir <HI>Henry Sidney<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and in this man∣ner born before the Knights e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect, 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. before the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II. and before the Duke of <HI>Albermarle,</HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. with these the Hood, heretofore put on in the Chapter-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use, hath of late been laid on the Cushion, and also the Book of Statut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and so born by Garter before Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and <HI>Frederick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Elect or Palatine, 10 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and before the Knights In∣stallation, 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. and since.</P>
<P>And here it is to be observed, that when Garter bears the Ornaments and Ensig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s on the Cushion before an elect Knight, or a Proctor, he is always placed betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Register and Black-Rod in the proceeding: Lastly, in this proceeding the Knight elect goe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Bare-headed, hold∣ing his Cap in his Hand; and so did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Duke of <HI>Alber∣marle,</HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. for it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h been thought incongr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous to the Order of Investiture, as is before observed of the Hood, to put on any part of the Habit, or other Orna∣men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that must be taken off again, before the Investitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is compleated; and the proper P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace for putting on the Cap is not till all the other is finished.</P>

<HEAD>The Ceremonies of Installation.</HEAD>
<P>§ 7. When the proceeding hath entered the Choir, the Alms-Knights, and Officers of Arms, make their Obeysances toward the High Altar, and the Sovereign's Royal Stall, in the manner hereafter described; then they proceed to the Steps before the Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> divide them∣selves; next the Officers of the Order make the same Reverence; and lastly, the two Commissioners, or Knights Assistants, or Knights-Compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and Knights-elect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all three together. After this the Officers of the Order turn aside toward the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> designed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the elect Knight, and approaching near it, stand below in the Choir, whilst the Commissioners, or Assistant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or Knights-Companion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, pass into the lower Row of Stalls, sometimes called the midd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Row, directly under the designed Stall, leading the elect Knight with them, who in this Place takes his
<PB N="338" REF="348"/>
Oath, called in the Annals, the sacred Oath of the Order of the Garter; during which time he ought to stand be∣tween the two Knights-Companions who brought him thither, as at the Installation of Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and when the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> was installed, 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 'tis observed, that the Senior Commissioner first entered the lower row of Stalls; but 31 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. at the Installa∣tion of the Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> and others, the Junior Assistant went up first. The Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght elect being thus placed, the Register of the Order standing before them, but below in the Choir, reads the Oath; for it is part of his Duty to administer the same: And in this solemn Ceremony, the New Testament, whereon the Oath is taken, gene∣rally opened in some Place of the Gospels, is indifferently held by one of the three inferior Officers of the Order, or sometimes the Register hath held it, as at the Instal∣lation of the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> 16 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> and Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI> At other times the Garter hath held it, as 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> when the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> took his Oath; and 10 <HI>Car.</HI> I. at the Installa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the Earl of <HI>Moreton:</HI> But when the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> was Sworn, 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Usher of the Black Rod performed this Office.</P>
<P>Whilst the Oath is administring, the elect Knight holds his right Hand on the Holy Evangelists; and when the Register hath pronounced the Words, he immediately Responses, <HI>I will, so help me God,</HI> and then takes off his Hand reveren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, kissing the Book; and by this Ceremony seals his Obligation to the Statutes of this most Noble Order. The Ceremony used when <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Ca∣stile</HI> and <HI>Leon,</HI> took the Oath, which was done in the Chapter-House at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. he laid h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Hand on the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non, under which was placed the Book of Statutes of the Order by the Prelate, to whom it was delivered b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Register, and having repeated the Words of the Oath, and reverentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed all those things by which he Swore, he took a Pen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Prelate's Hand, and Signed the Oath he had taken, and deliver'd it to the Sovereign then present.</P>
<P>The Form of the ancient Oath app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted by the Statutes of Institution, to be taken by a Knight-Subject, was very short, but comprehensive: <HI>That he should well and faithfully observe, to the utmost of his Power, all the</HI>
<PB N="339" REF="349"/>
<HI>Statutes of the Order;</HI> and this was all the Oath taken by the first Founders, and to which they also affixed their Seals; and so it continued without alteration or addition, till towards the End of King <HI>Edward</HI> IV's Reign; and then, at a Chapter held at the King's Wardr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be in <HI>London,</HI> it was decreed, That all the Knights-Companions then alive, and all such as should afterwards be admitted into the Order, should be obliged to su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>join the Words fol∣lowing: <HI>That they wou'd aid, support, and defend, with all their Power,</HI> the Royal College of St. <HI>George,</HI> within the Castle of <HI>Windsor, as well in its P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions, as all other things whatsoever;</HI> which being drawn in form, was en∣ter'd in the Black Book; but has since receiv'd many alterations: And there is an instance, 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> when the Oath has been dispensed with; as by the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Nor∣folk,</HI> and others, in regard the Rites and Ceremon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Religion were then altered, and no new form of an Oath settled, so that they only obliged themselves by Promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to observe such Statutes and Orders as should be decreed in the next Council of the Order, which was soon after settled, and recorded in the Red Book of the Order, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d is the Oath taken by a Knight-Subject at this Day.</P>
<P>You being Chosen to be one of the Honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Company of this most Noble Order of the Garter, shall P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omise and Swear, by the Holy E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angelists, by you here touched, that, wittingly or willingly, you shall not break any Statute of the said Order, or any Articles in them contained; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e same being agreeable, and not repugnant to the Laws of Almighty God, and the Laws of this Realm, as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r forth as to you belongeth and appertaineth: So help you God, and this Holy Word.</P>
<P>As soon as the Knight elect hath t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken the Oath, he is led to his appointed S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all, through the Entrance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext beneath it, and there placed before it. In the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, Garter advancing into the lower row of Stalls, to the Place where the elect Knight stood when he took the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, presents from thence the Mantle, Collar, and Book of Statutes, to those who led him, who invest the Knight elect first with the Mantle, by putting it on his Shoulders. There are some Examples where the elect Knight hath been invested before he went up to his Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>In the Red Book it is observed, that the Investiture with the Mantle and Collar, hath been sometimes per∣formed by the Black Rod; as at the Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allation of the Earl of <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thampton,</HI> 5 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Lord Treasurer <HI>Weston,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Exeter</HI> and <HI>Lindsey,</HI> and the Marquiss of <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> 6 <HI>Car.</HI> I. Nevertheless, this is to be understood as this Officers Assistance to the Knights-Companions, whose Office it only is, and no otherwise. Whilst the Ceremo∣ny of Investiture with the Mantle is performing, the Words of Admonition proper thereto, are pronounced as follows.</P>
<P>Take this Mantle of Heavenly Colours, in Sign and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken of the most Honourable Order you have receiv'd, and to the increase of your Honour, signed and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked as you see, with a red Escutcheon of our Lord's Cross, to the intent that yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, being always defended by the Virtue and Strength there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may pass through your Enemies, and them also overcome and vanquish, so that at the last, for you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy and app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved Acts, you may, after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Temporal Chivalry, come to Eternal Triumphant Joys in Heaven.</P>
<P>But at the Installation of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. they receiv'd some alteration, and were put in the following Form.</P>
<P>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be of Heavenly Colour, the Livery of this m st excellent Order, in augmentation of thy Honour, enobled with the Shield and Red C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss of our Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, by wh se Power thou may'st safely pierce T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oops of thy Enemies, and be over them ever Victorious; and being in this t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Glorious in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gregious and her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick Actions, thou may'st ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Eternal and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iumphant J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>

<P>Antiently at the Solemnity of Installation, when the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant was present, the elect Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, after he had been invested with the Mantle in his Stall, was immediately conducted out of the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, back to the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter-House, where the Sovereign, or Lieutenant, used to remain till his return, there to receive the Collar of the Order from one of them, which done, he is said to have receiv'd the entire Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of his Ha∣bit.

<P>The Knight, or Knights, having now receiv'd a com∣pleat Installation, the Knights-Commissioners, Assistants<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Knights-Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anions, with marks of Respect, take their leave of the last installed Knight, and descending into the Choi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, take their own Stalls; but the Senior Knight-Companion ascends first: But observe, that if the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls of the Knights-Commissioners, Assistants, or Knights-Com∣panions, be on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame side with the last installed Knight, then they descend not into the Choir, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s directly to them along the Stalls, as in the 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> The Ceremonies of Installation being finished, the Officers of Arms fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, next the Alms-Knights, descend from the Steps of the Altar, and take their several S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations in the Choir; then one of the Prebends of the Coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, or, if the Sovere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn be present, the Prelate, with the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the Vestry before him, is conducted to the Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar by the Verger of the Chappel, and there begins the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e appointed by the Church, which being ended, the Pro∣ceeding passes out of the Choir in usual Order, either to the Presence-Chamber, or the Lieutenants, or Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sioners Lodgings, as the Occasion is.</P>

<P>§ 9. But if the Installation be solemnized in the Morn∣ing, the Service of the Church having proceeded as far as the Offertory, two of the Prebends, appointed to re∣cieve the Offering, are conducted to the Altar by their Verger, and first the Alms-Knights, then the Officers of Arms, ascend the Steps of the Altar again, and stand in order as before. After which, Garter Summons down the Knights-Companions to the Offering, who descend into the Choir under their proper Stalls, as does the Sovereign's Lieutenant, who offers fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st for the Sovereign, he re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eiv∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the Bezant from the Senior Knight, and then retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns to h s Stal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: And at this instant, was the usual time here∣tofore for offering the Defunct Knights Atchievements, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich was altered by King <HI>James</HI> I. as will be seen here∣after.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant, after a short stay in his Stall, descends again, and proceeds up to the Altar, to make his own Of∣fering of Gold and Silver, and then returns, as do the rest of the Knights-Companions, includ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣led, in their due order. But when the Installation passes by Commissioners, there is then no Offering made for the Sovereign, but the Commissioners offer first, and after them the other Knights in due order.</P>
<P>The Ceremony of Offering at the Installation of <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stile,</HI> 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. is remarkable.

<HEAD>Of the grand Dinner at the Installation.</HEAD>
<P>§ 10. On the Day of Installation, there hath, from an∣cient Time, been appointed a Noble and Sumptuous Feast,
<PB N="348" REF="358"/>
and though it was agreed on in a Chapter, 3 <HI>Edward</HI> VI <HI>That the Knights elect might, from thenceforth, be installed by Commission without a Feast;</HI> yet after his Reign, we find the old custom of a Feast at this Solemnity restored.</P>
<P>If the Sovereign appoint the Installation to be when the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> is also celebrated, and is himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f per∣sonally present, the Feast is then kept at the Sovereign's Charge; and if in such case he constitute a Lieutenant, then the Installation Dinner is kept at the Charge of the Lieutenant; and is usually prepared in some of the Sove∣reign's Lodgings in the Castle, but seldom in St. <HI>Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge</HI>'s Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l; as was done by the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> at the Instal∣lation of the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> But when the Installation is kept at any other time of the Year, than that of St <HI>George</HI>'s Feast, then the new instal∣led Knights are at all the Expence; who generally have had the Dinner prepared in the Dean's Lodgings; how∣ever, be it where it will, the Sovereign, or his Lieute∣nant, Commissioners, or Assistants, together with the new installed Knights, proceed thither in full Robes; which is observed in the Installation of 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> above, to be according to the ancient Custom. At the Installation, 31 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Sovereign's Lieutenant walked alone, after him his two Assistants, and lastly the new installed Knights.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant's Place at the Table is somewhat on the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Hand the Cloath of State, there sat the Earl of <HI>Arun∣del,</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> but the other four Knights-Companions, his two Assistants, and the two new installed Knights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at toward the Table's End on both Sides, for that they could not well sit all on a side. But of late Years, as at the Installation, 5 <HI>Car.</HI> I. a Question arose, whether the Lieu∣tenant or Commissioners should sit at Dinner in their Habits, since the Power given them seemed to expire when the Knights were elected; (though unanimously al∣lowed the new installed Knights ought to do so,) and like∣wise Precedents quoted, as 29 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. at the Instal∣lation of the Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI> where the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights put off their Habits, and dined in their ordinary Apparel; and so of the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> 26 <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz.</HI> where the Commissioners did the same, and the new in∣stalled Knights kept on only their Surcoats: But what followed on this Debate is not mention'd; but the general
<PB N="349" REF="359"/>
Practice at other Times hath been of keeping on the Habit till the Dinner is ended.</P>
<P>At the second Course, called also second Mess, or se∣cond Service, Garter, accompanied with the Officers of Arms, Proclaims the Stiles and Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les of Honour of the Sovereign (if he be personally, or by his Lieutenant, pre∣sent,) in <HI>Latin, French,</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> and cries Largess thrice; next the Stiles of the new installed Knights in <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>English</HI> only, with two Largesses, and in that Order they were installed. And thus it was at the Installation of <HI>Charles,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. of <HI>Frederick,</HI> Prince Palatine, 10 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. and the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> and others, 14 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> Dined with the Sovereign in his Privy-Chamber, 22 <HI>Henry</HI> VII. whose Stile was Pro∣claimed by Garter, not in the same Room, but at the So∣vereign's great Chamber-Door, and in St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Hall,</HI> after Largess had been thrice cryed. When the Sovereign constitutes a Lieutenant, then is the Lieutenant's Stile also Proclaimed, and to his other Honours is added this of his Lieutenancy, and afterwards the Stiles of the new installed Knights, as 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> But the Order of this Cere∣mony is more particularly observed at the Installation of the Duke <HI>de Montmorency,</HI> and others, 14 <HI>Eliz.</HI> where fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Garter cried Largess, and next Proclaimed the So∣vereign's Stile, &amp;c. in three Languages, then stepping two Foot back, Proclaims the Lieutenant's Stile in <HI>French</HI> only, with two Largesses; and after that, he cried one La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gess for the Duke; and lastly, for all the other new installed Knights, only two Largesses, and the Officers of Arms did the like; and still as Garter had finished his Proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amation, the Heralds joined with him in crying Largess, and so with Reverence departed the Hall.</P>
<P>But lastly, it is proper to observe, that when neither the Sovereign, nor his Lieutenant, are present, then the Sover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign's Stile is not Proclaimed, nor those of the Com∣missioners, but only of the new installed Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts.</P>
<P>As soon as Dinner is ended, the Knights-Companions rise from Table, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thdraw to disrobe themselves, and therewith the Solemnity of Installation ends: And if at any time the Solemnity continues that Evening, and the following Day, it is only because the Sovereign (or his Lieutenant,) is present, on account of celebrating St. <HI>Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Feast, and not with reference to the Installa∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>Of setting up the Knight's Atchievements.</HEAD>
<P>§ 11. The last thing to be done at this great Solemnity, is setting up the <HI>Helm, Crest, Sword, Banner,</HI> and <HI>Plate,</HI> of the new installed Knight, over his Stall in the Chappel of St. <HI>George;</HI> to which purpose they are to be provided, according to the Directions before given.</P>
<P>By the Statutes of Institution it is ordained, that the time for setting up the Atchievements shall be when the elect Knight comes to <HI>Windsor-Castle,</HI> that is, to his In∣stallation, and not before; and the reason is there like∣wise given, lest it should happen, he not coming for his Installation within the time limitted, and consequently the vacating his Election ensuing, that a new Election being made, those military Ensigns might not seem to be dis∣gracefully withdrawn, and an occasion of Dishonour given, which otherwise could not be avoided, if they should be suddenly taken down from a Place so high; which de∣monstrates, that the intention of this Article extends to the finishing the Ceremonies of Installation, before the At∣chievements ought to be set up, by so carefully providing against the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shonour of taking them down, in case the Election should become void; which must infallibly hap∣pen, if the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight elect died but an Hour before he were compleatly installed. Accordingly, in the ancient Depu∣tations both to Sir <HI>William Philip,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Falstaff,</HI> Power is given their Proctors first to demand, receive, and obtain their principal Stalls, and next to tender their Helms, and Swords, to be hung up in the Choir of <HI>Windsor,</HI> according to Custom: And for clearer Informa∣tion of the course of this Ceremony, that the Sovereign impowered his Commissi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers, first to give the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uty Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of his Principal's Stall, and after to receive the Atchievements, and place them over it: This is to be considered as a Memorial of the Knights being installed a Companion of the Order, and 'tis incongruous in the Rules of Honour to have the Sign or a Memorial of an Action precede the Action it se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f.</P>
<P>Again, the Statutes expresly provide, that the Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Atchievements shall not be hung up, till the Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es and Fees enjoined are first discharged; and 'tis certain, there
<PB N="351" REF="361"/>
are no Fees due, nor can be claimed, till the Ceremonies on which they become due are entirely finished. But to clear all Doubts which may arise upon this Point, it was at a Chapter held at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> the fourth of <HI>February,</HI> 22 <HI>Car.</HI> II. ordained, <HI>That not any of the Atchievements of an elect Knight's Stall be set up in the Chappel at</HI> Wind∣for, <HI>before he be installed, and the Fees of Installation paid.</HI></P>
<P>And though this was the Practice anciently, yet were the Atchievements always prepared and brought to <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> and set before the elect Knight's Stall; and in case of his not coming to receive Installation, then, being no otherwise placed, they might be the easier removed with∣out the Choir, in as decent manner as could be, so that the Honour of Knighthood might be preserved entire; ne∣vertheless, to be retained for publick Use, and the Be∣nefit of the College.</P>
<P>Where mention is made in the Annals of any Person employed to set up the Atchievements of a Knight, it is to be understood that he was his Proctor, and installed on his behalf: And there appears but one single Instance where one Person hath hung up a Knight's Atchievements, when another was installed for him; and this happen'd 14th of <HI>August, Anno</HI> 29 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. where the Lord <HI>Rivers</HI> having been elected to the Stall of the Lord <HI>Hungerford,</HI> his Sword and Helm were soon after (sent) hung up by <HI>William Bobden,</HI> his Esq; and <HI>Guyen Herald,</HI> and he installed the 30 <HI>October</HI> following, by Sir <HI>William Craf∣ford</HI> his Proctor; but this was contrary to the Law of the Order.</P>
<P>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the setting up of a Knight's Atchievements is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned, without taking notice of the Installation, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erstood, that such Knight's Installation was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o solem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z'd at that Time: As in the case of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> of whom the Annals only note, that he had taken care to set over his Stall, Helm, Sword, and Ban∣ner, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l things belonging thereto, at the Feast at <HI>Windsor,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Henry</HI> VI.

<HEAD>CAP. XIII. The Installation of a Knight-Subject by Proxy.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Original Cause of making Proxies.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. THere was no liberty given at the Institution of the Order, for a Knight-Subject to be in∣stalled by his Proctor or Deputy; but on the contrary, in the Founder's Statutes was inserted this express Prohibition. <HI>That none of the Knights elect should be permitted to be installed by</HI> Proxy, <HI>unless he were a Stranger.</HI> And this Law continued unaltered till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. when <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> the So∣vereign's Deputy for holding the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 7 <HI>Henry</HI> V. and other the Knights-Companions then present, took it into Consideration; that where a Knight-Subject, elected into the Order, was at that Time employed beyond Sea, in the Service of his Prince, and likely to continue in that Service some time, it was agreed, that the said Duke should make an Address to the Sove∣reign, by Letters under the Seal of the Order, (he being then employed in the War against <HI>France,)</HI> that in the like cases his Majesty would Ordain, <HI>That</HI> Knights-Sub∣jects <HI>might, as well as</HI> Strangers, <HI>be admitted into the</HI> Order, <HI>notwit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>standing the Clause in the Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>It likewise appears from that <HI>Letter,</HI> as well as from the Blue-Book, that Sir <HI>John Grey,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Bour∣chier,</HI> had been installed at the aforesaid Feast, by their several Proxies; which the Sovereign's Deputy concurr'd with, out of great Respect to their Persons; left by a too rigid Observance of the Statutes, by their absence in the Wars, where they were then loyally employed, and might meet their Deaths, they should want the desired Suffrages of those Masses, ordained to be Sung for a de∣funct Knight; as had happen'd to several by unsuspected delays. But to clear this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, for the future it was Decreed, 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. That where any elect Knight was
<PB N="353" REF="363"/>
actually in the Sovereign's Wars, or otherwise employed Abroad on his Sovereign's Affairs, he should possess the Privilege of a Stranger in this particular; which Decree was added to King <HI>Henry</HI> Vth's Statutes. And it was so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n after enjoined the elect Knight, on notice of his Election, to take care timely to appoint his Proctor, that he might enjoy the Rights and Privileges of a Founder: Such an Obligation was laid on Sir <HI>John Falstaff,</HI> who, at the reception of the Garter, was in <HI>France,</HI> employed in the Sovereign's Service.</P>
<P>But King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. besides his Confirmation of this Decree, for allowance of a Proxy in the aforesaid two Cases, farther enlarged it, to such as the Sovereign should either Command, or permit Licence to be installed by Proxy, which is to be understood of Knights elect within the Kingdom, as well as those beyond Sea: By Virtue of which Clause, the elect Knight, the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> be∣ing Sick, 1 <HI>Car.</HI> I. obtained the Sovereign's Licence to be installed by his Deputy Sir <HI>Richard Young.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Letters of Procuration.</HEAD>
<P>§ 2. It is observed before, out of the <HI>Registrum Char∣taceum,</HI> that Sir <HI>John Robesart,</HI> elected into the Order by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. was installed by Virtue of his Let∣ter Missive, sent to Sir <HI>Thomas Barr</HI> his Proxy; but the same Register calls it, in another Place, a sufficient Pro∣curation under his Seal of Arms, enabling him to perform the Ceremony of his Installation.</P>
<P>The Copy of this Instrument is not extant; but that Letter Missive Sir <HI>John Grey</HI> directed to Sir <HI>John Lisle,</HI> to take Possession of his Stall, and by Virtue of which he was installed, <HI>tells him he had Chosen him for his Proxy, and to take his Stall for him in his Name,</HI> &amp;c. And omitting other Precedents, doubtless, in the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a Knight-Subject, the Sovereign may, if he pleases, nomi∣nate and appoint a Proxy for Installation, where the elect Knight hath not done it himself; for here, all those Con∣siderations of grand Respect, Forms of the Oath, &amp;c. con∣stantly afforded to Strangers, have no Place; which is evident from the Sovereign's Letters of Summons to the Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioners named for Installation of the Lord <HI>Grey,</HI>

<P>The first Precedent of Letters of Procuration, or De∣pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, drawn into a solemn Form, is that made by Sir <HI>William Phelip,</HI> 5 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. by which, having obtained the Sover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign's Licence, he impowers two Knights, Sir <HI>Andrew Butrely,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Henington,</HI> or ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her of them, as their Business would p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmit, to supply his Place, and take Possession of his Stall, in the Choir at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>

thereto all usual Ceremonies. 6. Lastly, an Injanction to all the Knights to permit all the Solemnity punctu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly to be performed: An ancient Precedent of this is found 5 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. in the case of Sir <HI>John Falstaff:</HI> Also 2 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. at the Installation of the Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d other elect Knights, by their Proxies.</P>
<P>Of later Times, the Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions granted on such Oc∣casions differ from those made for the Personal Installa∣tion of the Knights themselves, only by premising the Cause of their Principal's Absence, and Service he is then employed on; authorizing the Commissioners to admit the Proxy into his Stall: Likewise where the Installation is performed by two or more Commissioners, the Sovereign dir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts Letters to each of them, giving notice of the intend∣ed Solemnity, and requiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them to attend at a Day prefix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to the end the Proxy may be put into Possession of his Principal's Stall.</P>
<P>And as there is, upon adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of an elect Knight, in∣stalled by Proxy, the same ground for removal of Stalls, as in personal Installations; so the Sovereign issues out Warrants to <HI>Garter,</HI> some time bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Solemnity, to remove the Atchievements and Plates, as usual, and place them in the Order such Warrants direct.

<P>The rest of the Particulars to be provided against the Day of Installation, are at the Knight's own Charge, and are agreeable with those in Personal Installations.</P>

<HEAD>Proceeding to the Chapter-House.</HEAD>
<P>§ 5. The next thing to be consider'd, is the Proxies Place in proceeding to the Chapter-House, and this is immediately after the Provincial <HI>King of Arms,</HI> because as yet he hath not taken Possession of his Princi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al's Stall; which done, it gives him a Place in his return according to its Dignity. In this Order the Proctors of the Marqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> proceeded (Bare-headed,) 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>

<P>§ 6.

<P>The Oath being taken in this solemn manner, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roctor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> led up to the Stall of his Principal, where both

the Knights, who conducted him into the Choir, first take the <HI>Mantle,</HI> and lay it on his Arm, next laying their Hands on him, in the Name of his Lord and Master, from whom he received his Deputation, set him down therein: And so the Ceremony of Installation being fully ended, the Service of the Church begins.</P>
<P>If the Installation be performed in the Morning, there is an Offering of Gold and Silver; at which time the Proxy in his turn comes from his Principal's Stall, and stands before it, and when the Sovereign, or the Lieu∣tenant for him, and for himself, or else the Commis∣sioners, and the rest of the Knights-Companions present, have offered, then the Proxy (being joined to the Knight, sitting in the opposite Stall, if present at the Solemnity, and having two Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of Arms before them,) proceeds to the High Altar, and there offers both Gold and Silver; and then returns, and takes his Stall as the rest do. In this manner the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Proxy, joining with the Earl of <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thumberland,</HI> installed at the same time, pro∣ceeded to the Offering, 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> As likewise the Proctor to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CAP. XIV. The Signification of Election to Strangers.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Within what time, and in what manner, Certificate is made of their Election.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. IN regard that Strangers elect, are for the most part Sovereign Princes, whose Affairs obliged them to abide in their own Dominions, and very rarely permitted them to receive Personal Installation, it was thought fit to allow them several Privileges, by the Founder of this most <HI>Noble Order,</HI> and principally, that of giving previous and timely Notice of their Elections, and convenient time of consideration for Acceptance; aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rding Investiture in their own Countries, and permit∣ting their Installations to be performed at <HI>Windsor</HI> by their Proxies or Deputies.</P>
<P>It was therefore by the <HI>Statutes</HI> ordained: That when any such should be chosen into the <HI>Order,</HI> they should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertified of their Elections by the Sovereign; and besides, that, at his Charge, the <HI>Garter</HI> should be sent over to them, with the <HI>Mantle</HI> and <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> Sealed with the common Seal; so that they might have notice, at¦least within four Months from the time of Election, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd they might advise and determine with themselves, fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the Tenor of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> whether they would re∣ceive the Honour of this most <HI>Noble Order.</HI></P>
<P>In Pursuance of these Directions, it became cust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mary for the Sovereign, when he sent his Letters, to send also, and that by way of solemn Embassy, the Habit and Ensign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or the <HI>Order,</HI> with a Book of the <HI>Statutes;</HI> and in case the Election were accepted, Investiture might be re∣ceived before the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turn of the Persons, by whom the
<PB N="361" REF="371"/>
Habit was sent. As upon the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ections of <HI>Edward,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the Duke of <HI>Urbin,</HI> 14 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. and several others.</P>
<P>The right of bearing these Letters signifying Election, and returning the Strangers Answer, belongs to <HI>Garter,</HI> by the Constitutions of his Office. And though Certi∣ficate of Election was to be made within f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Months from the time of Election, yet King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. added this necessary Clause: <HI>That when the Sovereign had any great or high Impediment, he might defer certifying the Election till a more convenient Time.</HI> As may be seen in the case of <HI>Frederick</HI> III. Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> in the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who having been elected 35 of that King, had not Letters sent him to signify it till the next Year. It likewise appears, that Letters to the same Effect were then likewise dispatched to the King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> and King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who had been elected eight Years before.</P>
<P>And yet we find it recorded, that the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>En∣signs</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> were sent by special Ambassadors to all three, 34 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. two Years before: But perhaps this ought to be understood of their being but then design'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ordered to be sent, and on second Thoughts might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e stopped, or if sent, by some accident might have miscar∣ried; otherwise it seems needless to have sent other Let∣ters to give notice of their Election two Years after: But to clear this matter, we after find a second mention of sending the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Ensigns</HI> to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> 37 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. by which it is demonstrable, that the first Embassy took no Effect.</P>
<P>It does not appear that King <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. or any of his Successors, ever made use of that Liberty granted by the aforesaid Article of his <HI>Statutes,</HI> for deferring the signifi∣catory Letters of El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction beyond the time appointed by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Statutes</HI> of Institution, as we find by the many In∣stances of that kind. <HI>Francis</HI> the first King of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance</HI> was elected <HI>Oct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber</HI> 21. 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and was installed the 25 <HI>January</HI> following; so that 'tis plain, the Letters of No∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must needs have been dispatched within the limited Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes</HI> V. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was elected 20 <HI>Jan.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. had notice of Election immediately sent him; and <HI>Hen.</HI> II. of <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> having been elected 24

<P>§ 4. After delivering the Sovereign's Letter, signifying Election by the Ambassador, and the <HI>elect Stranger</HI> do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="365" REF="375"/>
readily accept the <HI>Order,</HI> he is obliged, by the Statutes, to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turn the Sovereign a Certificate of such his Accep∣tance, and desire of Ratification. And 'tis observable, before the additional Clause made by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. this ceremonious Course had been the Practice of an∣cient Times; and both expected from, and observed by the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who having been elected, 6 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. was the eighth of the same King taken notice of for not returning, before that Time, an Answer, whether he accepted the Honour or no: And it appears, before the next Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> he sent over his ready Accep∣tance, both of the Honour of Election, and of the En∣signs of the <HI>Order;</HI> and thereupon Directions were given for his Installation by the Lord <HI>Fitz Hugh,</HI> his Proxy.</P>
<P>But for an instance, after the said additional Clause, there is one remarkable enough, in the Preamble of the Sovereign's <HI>Credential Letters</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> sent with the Habit and Ensigns of the <HI>Order;</HI> in which it appears: <HI>That the Sovereign having given notice of his Election into this most Noble</HI> Order, <HI>he had returned back his cheerful and ready Acceptance of, and singular Satisfaction in the said Choice; and therefore cor∣dially wished it might attain its due Effect.</HI></P>
<P>In succeeding Times it was thought necessary, where the whole <HI>Habit</HI> was sent to a <HI>Stranger,</HI> together with the Sovereign's Letters of notice, to make a provisional De∣cree, (which passed, 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I.) <HI>That Garter, and all others, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pleased to join in Commission with him, should be most punctually careful, that they delivered not the</HI> Ensigns <HI>of the</HI> Order <HI>to any</HI> elect Stranger, <HI>till they were satisfied, by his</HI> Letters Patent, <HI>of his kind and grate∣ful Acceptance thereof;</HI> or in case of refusal, to forbear their Presentation.</P>
<P>And the same care was also taken, where only the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> and <HI>George</HI> were sent; as appears by the Instru∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, 19 <HI>Car.</HI> I. to Sir <HI>William Boswel,</HI> then ap∣pointed by the Sovereign to present those two principal Ensigns to <HI>William,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> where, among other things, he is expresly commanded, <HI>To take a Testi∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nial from the said Prince, of his kind Acceptation t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereof, before he should deliver those Ensigns of Honour to him:</HI> So likewise in the Institutions of the same Date, for delivery

<HEAD>Of an Election not accepted.</HEAD>
<P>§ 5. That sometimes this Honour hath not been accept∣ed, appears in the single case of <HI>Philip</HI> II. Duke of <HI>Bur∣gundy,</HI> who having been elected by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. then in <HI>France,</HI> had not, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. sent his Answer. It was therefore concluded on at the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> held at <HI>Windsor</HI> the said Year, by <HI>Humphry,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> then Deputy to the Sovereign, and by, and with the unanimous consent of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> present, to send Letters to the said elect Duke, by which he was desired to know, whether he gave his Accep∣tance or no? The Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> it seems, made no Answer to this Letter: It was therefore again debated at the next Year's Feast, and then thought fit, to send Per∣sons over to him with the Nomination, who should press him for his final Answer. And then it appears, that the said Duke weighing the Statutes, and reflecting on the Quarrels between the Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> his Unckle, made a plausible Excuse, refusing the Election, lest he should be forced e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther dishonou∣rably to violate the pious Constitutions of the <HI>Order,</HI> or the obligations of Alliance; and upon this they proceeded to a new E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction.</P>
<P>But this is the only instance of this kind; and it hath been the constant way of all elect Strangers, not only to accept, but to receive with the highest Marks of Satis∣faction, the notice of their Election, and the Inveititure of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CAP. XV. The Investiture of Strangers, with the Habit and Ensigns of the Order.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Time for sending the Habit and Ensigns un∣limitted.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. THough the Statutes of the <HI>Order</HI> appoint and prefix a time, wherein the Sovereign's Letters of notice to an elect Knight ought to be sent, yet as to the sending a solemn Embassy with the Habit and Ensigns, they do not limit any certain time, but leave it wholly to the Sovereign's Pleasure, wherein his own In∣terest and Conveniency, as well as that of the <HI>elect Stran∣ger,</HI> is to be considered.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the Statutes of Institution direct, that this Legation shall be dispatched with convenient speed; which must be interpreted to refer both to the Sovereign's conveniency of sending, and the <HI>Stranger's</HI> capacity of re∣ceiving.</P>
<P>And therefore we find it six Years after the Election of the Kings of <HI>Arragon</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bruns∣wick,</HI> e'er we meet with the first notice of the Sovereign's determination of sending over the Habit: For they having been elected 4 <HI>August,</HI> 28 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the preparations for the <HI>Legation</HI> were not made till the thirty fourth Year of the same King; and doubtless some cause, within the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of that conveniency allowed to the Sovereign by the aforesaid Article of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> or the accident of Miscarriage might fall out; particularly in respect to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> because three Years after the former Order of <HI>Legation,</HI> we find new Directions issued for sending the Ensigns of the <HI>Order</HI> to him.</P>
<P>But in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Body of <HI>Statutes,</HI> this Clause of sending the Legation with convenient speed, is wholly omitted, and the Sovereign is not limitted as to the Time; so that the Habit and Ensigns have happen'd to be sent sometimes sooner, sometimes later; as the Sovereign
<PB N="368" REF="378"/>
has thought convenient; of which sufficient hath been said already; and we find in two Elections of <HI>Stran∣gers</HI> in the two late Reigns, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the present So∣vereign and Prince; that the Legation was sent only a very few Days after their Election.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Preparations made for the Legation.</HEAD>
<P>§ 2. In reference to this solemn Embassy, there are several things to be provided, before the Ambassadors, or Commissioners, take their Journey. As, (1.) Creden∣tial Letters. (2.) Commission of Legation. (3.) War∣rants for the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Ensigns.</HI> And (4.) other Neces∣saries.</P>
<P>The Credential Letters are, as to particulars, drawn suitable to the present Occasion, by the <HI>Chancellor</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> and directed to the <HI>Stranger elect;</HI> but the Sub∣stance, in general, is, <HI>That the Sovereign having e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected him into the Society of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> Order, <HI>hath sent his Ambassa∣dors with full Power to present the</HI> Habit, <HI>and perform the Ceremonies due and accustomed, as if himself were present.</HI> And farther, to desire him, <HI>To give Credit to all that his Ambassadors shall say, or perform, on his behalf, in reference to their Commission, as he would do to himself.</HI></P>
<P>These Letters pass under the Sign Manual of the Sove∣reign, and Signet of the <HI>Order;</HI> but it is observable, that these to <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> were sign'd both by King <HI>Philip</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Commission</HI> of <HI>Legation</HI> is likewise to be pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared by the <HI>Chancellor</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> fairly engrossed on V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lom, and Sealed with the <HI>Great Seal</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> the Sub∣stance of which, for the most part, hath been as follows.</P>
<P>First, The Merits and Worthiness of the <HI>elect Stranger,</HI> to deserve the Honour of <HI>Election,</HI> and the reasons of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ducing the Sovereign to confer the same upon him, are elegantly set forth.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns nominated for this Honourable Employment, are ordained, authorized, and deputed, and therein Stiled, Ambassadors, Procurators, and spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Messengers, and so are acknowledged to be by the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ger el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct,</HI> in their C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtificates of the Receipt of the Habit.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="379"/>
Thirdly, Their Power, Authority, and special Com∣mand, is to address themselves to the <HI>Stranger elect,</HI> and present, and deliver him from the Sovereign, the <HI>Garter, Mantle,</HI> and other Ensigns of the Order: Where ob∣serve, that there were four or fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined in a Com∣mission, as it has sometimes hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ened, then any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, four, three, or two, were of the Quorum; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eof the Principal of the Embassy was always one.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They were impowered to require from the <HI>Stranger elect,</HI> his Oath, according to the Form prescri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the <HI>Statutes;</HI> but this was a special case, and only in∣serted in the Commissions of Legation to <HI>Charles,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> 9 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chdeacon of <HI>Austria,</HI> 15 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and omit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in all Commissions since that time.</P>
<P>And lastly, To perform, and dispatch those things, which they should judge necessary, in the same mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r as if the Sovereign were present in Person; and this Power it was thought fit to allow the Ambassadors, in case any thing should want to be performed which their Instructions had not sufficiently provided for.</P>
<P>The first Embassy on this occasion, recorded in the <HI>Blue-Book,</HI> is that to <HI>Edward,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. to whom, for the greater Dignity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Order,</HI> G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rter was thought fit, by the <HI>Chapter,</HI> to be sent alone with the <HI>Habit</HI> of the <HI>Order:</HI> And hence is the original of <HI>Garter's</HI> Claim to this Employment.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, in succeeding times, as the Order grew into Esteem, some one of the Knights-Companions was made choice of by the Sovereign to be Principal in these Legations; as were <HI>Galliard Sieur de Duras,</HI> sent to <HI>Charles,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> 9 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. <HI>Arthur Plantage∣net,</HI> Viscount <HI>Lisle,</HI> to <HI>Francis</HI> the first King of <HI>France,</HI> 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and others.</P>
<P>Sometimes other Noblemen, or Persons of Quality though not Knights-Companions, (yet c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondent to the Degree of the <HI>Stranger elect,</HI> or to the Esteem the present Interest begat in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vereign,) were emplo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed chief in these Embassies; among whom Sir <HI>Charles Somer∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> after Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> was sent to the Emperor <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣imilian,</HI> 6 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. <HI>Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> Lord <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ley,</HI> to <HI>Don Fer∣dinand,</HI> Prince of <HI>Spain,</HI> 15 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and others.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="380"/>
In Embassies of this nature, it was heretofore usual, to join some Persons of Rank and Quality, or Office near the Sovereign, in the Commission; as Sir <HI>John Scot,</HI> Comp∣troller of the Houshold, and Sir <HI>Thomas Vaughan,</HI> Treasurer of the Houshold, both joined with the <HI>Sieur de Duras</HI> aforesaid: And Sir <HI>Nicholas Carew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Anthony Brown,</HI> with the Visc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt <HI>Lisle.</HI></P>
<P>To these Persons, the Sovereign thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it sometimes to add a Doctor of the Law, or a dignified Clergyman, and such as had the Language of the Country, not only the better to make such Answers to Questions as the <HI>Stranger elect</HI> might start, on perusal of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> but likewise to inform him touching the Institution of the <HI>Order,</HI> or other Passages relating to the Founder, or matters touching the Honour of the Garter. Besides, a dignified Clergyman was in those Times thought proper to Administer the Oath, and pronounce the Words of Signification, at the Investiture with the Habit and Ensigns of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>And for these reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, was <HI>John Russel,</HI> Doctor of the Civil Law, and Archdeacon of <HI>Berkshire,</HI> joined in Com∣mission with the aforesaid <HI>Sieur de Dura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Edward Lee,</HI> Doctor in Divinity, Archdeacon of <HI>Colchester,</HI> and the Sovereign's Almoner, sent over with the Lord <HI>Morley;</HI> and others.</P>
<P>But of later Years the Sovereign's Ambassador, Resident with the <HI>Stranger elect,</HI> hath supplied this Place; as did Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> in the Legation sent over to <HI>Charles</HI> IX. and Sir <HI>Edward Stafford,</HI> in that of the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> III. and Sir <HI>Anthony Mildmay,</HI> to that of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.</P>
<P>Besides the aforementioned Persons, <HI>Garter</HI> was always j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined in these Commissions of Leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, not only to keep on Foot his Right, but to manage the Ceremonious Part; and of this there are so many numerous Instances as are sufficient to justify the Privilege of his Office, and main∣tain the interest of an ancient Right. Besides which, if it were any way disputed, we find it decreed in a <HI>Chapter</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. <HI>That the carrying the Ensigns of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der to</HI> Stranger Princes, <HI>doth properly belong to</HI> Garter.</P>
<P>Besides those Persons joined in the Commission of Le∣gation, there has frequently been appointed, either <HI>Nor∣roy,</HI> King of Arms, or s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me one of the <HI>Heralds,</HI> to go in Quality of an Attendant in this Service, not only for the
<PB N="371" REF="381"/>
Honour of the Sovereign, but of the Stranger who is to receive the <HI>Habit,</HI> in regard the Ceremonies of Investiture with the whole <HI>Habit,</HI> require the Assistance of two Of∣ficers of Arms, of which there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me Precedents.</P>
<P><HI>Lancaster Herald</HI> attended the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bassy to <HI>Charles</HI> IX. King of <HI>France: Chester Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld,</HI> and <HI>Rouge Dragon,</HI> Pursuivant at Arms, on that of <HI>Henry</HI> III. of <HI>France.</HI> A Herald likewise attended the Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assy to <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy: York Herald,</HI> that of <HI>Maximilian,</HI> the Emperor: And <HI>Somerset Herald,</HI> to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas there went only <HI>Norroy</HI> to <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istian</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> it was because no more of the Of∣ficers of Arms could then be spared from their necessary Attendance on the Sovereign's Coronation; so in the Em∣bassy to <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> one Herald sufficed, because the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George</HI> only were sent him, and consequently there was but little Service then to be per∣formed.</P>
<P>Concerning other Companions, and Attendan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, in these Legations, they are both for Quality and Number such, and so many, as the chief in the Legation judges sufficient for the Honour of the Sovereign, and the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Embassy; and with these have usually gone several Noble∣men, Knights, and Gentlemen.</P>
<P>In the third Place, there is to be prepared for these Le∣gations, Warrants for the Habit and Ensigns of the <HI>Order;</HI> and these are also to be drawn up by the Chancellor of the <HI>Order,</HI> who is to attend the Sovereign for his Sign Manu∣al thereto.</P>
<P>One Warrant is to be directed to the Master of the <HI>Great Wardrobe,</HI> to deliver to Garter the Mantle, with the Escutcheon of St. <HI>George</HI> within a Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, embroidered on the left Shoulder, and Tossels belonging; and also the <HI>Surcoat</HI> and <HI>Hood.</HI></P>
<P>There is also another Warrant drawn up, for the de∣livery of the Ensigns of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der</HI> to <HI>Garter, viz.</HI> the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch <HI>Garter,</HI> and great <HI>Collar</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> with a George Pend∣ant, and another George ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g in a blue Ribbond; together with Cases for them, lined with purple Velvet, and gilt on the outside.</P>
<P>And sometimes these Ensigns have been delivered out of the <HI>Jewel-House,</HI> to the Herald of Arms. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oined in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egation in <HI>Garter's</HI> stead, as were those sent to <HI>Charles,</HI>

King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> 20 <HI>Car.</HI> II. but those provided for <HI>John George,</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Higgons,</HI> the Prin∣cipal in the Legation; for which they gave their several Receipts.</P>
<P>The Sovereign's Warrant for the delivery of the En∣signs sent to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor, was directed to the Lord Treasurer, for which <HI>Garter</HI> gave his Receipt. But for those sent to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> IV. the Warrant was directed to the Master of the <HI>Jewel-House;</HI> and out of this Office have all the <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> been since delivered.</P>
<P>There are several other necessaries to be provided, which may pass as Appurtenances to the former, and are sometimes incerted in the Sovereign's Warrants for the Habit of the <HI>Order,</HI> and at other times issued by particular Warrants: As a black Velvet Cap with white Feathers and a Heron Sprig, a Girdle and Hangers with the same coloured Velvet, with the Surcoat. A Yard of purple Vel∣vet hath usually been allowed out of the <HI>Great Wardrobe,</HI> for covering the Book of <HI>Statutes,</HI> sent to the <HI>elect Stranger:</HI> And for the Velom, Writing and Binding the said Book, there is a Fee paid by the Sovereign to the <HI>Register</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> which hath generally been proportioned to the Dig∣nity of the Receiver; for this Officer had allowed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m for the Book sent,</P>

<P>This Book of <HI>Statutes</HI> ought to be Sealed with the com∣mon Seal of the <HI>Order,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich not only the Institution, but all the other succeding Bodies of <HI>Statutes</HI> appoint. Besides, at a Chapter held at <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite-Hall,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Law was confirmed; and thereupon it was again decreed, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t the Book of <HI>Statutes</HI> sent to any <HI>Stranger Prince,</HI> should be Sealed with the Great Seal of the <HI>Order,</HI> af∣fixed to a Label of blue Silk and Gold.</P>
<P>There is also to be provided a large purple Velvet Cushion, to carry the Robes on, when they are to be pre∣sented; this is likewise put into the Sovereign's Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rant, and provided by the Master of the <HI>Great Wardrobe;</HI> usually containing one Yard and quarter in length, ador∣ned with Fringe, Canl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Tossels of Gold and purple Silk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and within it a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow of Fustian filled with Down.</P>
<P>There were two Velvet Cushions prepared for the Ser∣vice of the Duke of <HI>Wirtembergh</HI>'s Investiture, 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. one of Purple, for the Sovereign's State; and another of Crimson, for the Duke; so the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Year to <HI>Christian</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>Two <HI>Majesty Escutcheons</HI> are likewise to be provided<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> painted in <HI>Oil,</HI> and gilt with Gold; one to have the Arms of the Sovereign surrounded with a Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, under an Im∣perial Crown; the other of the <HI>Stranger's</HI> Arms, within a Garter also, and such a Crown as is proper to his Dig∣nity. Both these are to be put in Frames, painted and gilt, with their several Stiles fairly Written under the Arms, and set on the back of the Sovereign's Stall, under the State, as also on the back of the Stall of the <HI>Stranger elect:</HI> But there were three <HI>Majesty Escutcheons</HI> sent over in the Legation to <HI>Henry,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in regard that at his Investiture, <HI>Frederick,</HI> Elector Palatine, was present.
<PB N="374" REF="384"/>
In case the chief Person in the Legation be a Knight of the <HI>Order,</HI> then he is to have a like Escutcheon of his own Arms, set over his own Stall; for so had the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> provided for him at the Sovereign's Charge, when he was sent with the Habit to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> III.</P>
<P>The remaining Necessaries, are such as relate to the Transportation of the Habit of the <HI>Order, viz.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>One Pair of fine Holland Sheets to fold the Habit in.</L>
<L>Two sweet Bags of Taffaty to lay amongst them.</L>
<L>Two Trunks to put the said Parcels in.</L>
<L>One Sumpter Saddle.</L>
</LG>
<P>All which are to be provided at the Sovereign's Charge, and is also his Gift to the elect <HI>Prince.</HI></P>
<P>What farther Warrants are to be obtained from the Sovereign, relate to <HI>Garter,</HI> and such other Officers of Arms, as are appointed to attend the Legation; as first a Warrant, whereby the Sovereign ascertains a Warrant for their Diet, and Reward, during their Journey, and till their return; and on which, most commonly, for greater certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of its Payment, the Sovereign's Privy Seal is obtained.</P>
<P>The Allowance to <HI>Garter</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. was ten Shillings a Day for his Diet, and Ten Shillings a Day more as a Reward: And this we find allowed to Sir <HI>Gilbert Dethick,</HI> in the Embassy to <HI>Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>France,</HI> 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. and the like in his Legation to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor; and to <HI>Frederick</HI> II. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> 24 <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz.</HI></P>
<P>And when <HI>Clarenceux</HI> was sent in the Place of <HI>Garter</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Office bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g void by the Death of the said Sir <HI>Gilbert)</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> III. the same was also allowed him, and commenced nine Days before his setting out; and of which there are other Precedents.</P>
<P>Of this daily Allowance, <HI>Garter</HI> hath usually obtained an advance before-hand, for his better support by the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>When any of the Heralds were sent in <HI>Garter's</HI> Place, the same Allowances were made them, as if <HI>Garter</HI> had gone in Person; as had <HI>Henry St. George,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Richmond He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ald,</HI> sent with the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> to <HI>Charles,</HI> King of

<HI>Sweden,</HI> 21 <HI>Car.</HI> I. As also to <HI>Thomas St. George,</HI> Esq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Somerset Herald,</HI> sent with Sir <HI>Thomas Higgins,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> soon after.</P>
<P>As to the Allowance to such Officers of Arms, as are not joined in, but appointed to at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d any of these Le∣gations; it was usually, if a Herald, the Moie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of what was given to <HI>Garter:</HI> And if a Pursuivant at A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, half as much as a Herald.</P>
<P>Agreeable to whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, was the Allowance given to <HI>Chester Herald,</HI> and <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge Dragon</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsuivant, in the Embassy to <HI>Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>France,</HI> 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there called the <HI>old Rate;</HI> so also to <HI>Some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Herald,</HI> to <HI>F ederick</HI> II. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> III. and IV. And both the Herald and Pursuivant had a so a pro∣portionable part of their daily Allowances before-hand.</P>
<P>Besides which Allowances men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioned, <HI>Garter</HI> hath also Allowance for Postage, both Outward and Homeward, for Himself and Servants; and for Transportation of the Habit, and other Things necessary for the Voyage. And this by a Clause added in the Sovereign's Warrant, is left to <HI>Garter</HI> at his return, when he gives in a Bill of particulars, subscribed with his Hand, to the Treasurer or Chamberlains of the Exchequer, to have been disbursed by him.</P>
<P>The Warrant to furnish <HI>Garter,</HI> or the <HI>Herald,</HI> with Post Horses, and convenient Shipping to carry them over, is usually had of the Privy Council, or Secretary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f State; either before, or after the Lord Ambassador; and is not provided for in the same Ship.</P>

<HEAD>The Ceremonies of Investiture.</HEAD>
<P>§ 3. The Ceremonies performed at a Stranger Prince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Receipt of the whole Habit and Ensigns of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der, are highly Solemn, whether we consider the manner of Investiture performed by the Sovereign's Ambassadors, on the <HI>Festivity</HI> and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iumphs,</HI> added by the new invested Prince.</P>
<P>First, the Commissions joined in the Legation, receiving notice of their first Audience, are to present themselves in the accustomed manner of Ambassad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, Gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, or his Deputy, going in breast wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the chief of the Legation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="376" REF="386"/>
if there be only himself joined in Commission with the Lord Ambassador, and in this Place <HI>William Segar,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Norroy</HI> King of Arms, (sent in the room of <HI>Garter)</HI> proceed∣ed with the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> at their first Audience before <HI>Christian,</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>Being arrived near the <HI>elect Stranger,</HI> they present the Letters, certifying Election, or their Credential Letters from the Sovereign; and after some short general Com∣pliment by the Ambassador, he makes known to him, his Election in the usual Form, which is before sufficiently spoke of.</P>
<P>After the Formality of this Address is over, and that the Stranger hath by his Answer accepted of his Election, and consented to the Reception of the <HI>Order;</HI> the Ambas∣sador immediately delivers him the Book of <HI>Statutes,</HI> that he may, if he pleases, peruse them before he assume the Habit, and desires his Consideration thereon. Next, both the Commissioners in the Legation present him with the <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Ribbond,</HI> and put it about his Neck, as in several Instances hath been shown.</P>
<P>In the interim, before the Day of Investiture, Time is usually set apart for Conference between the Sovereign's Ambassador, and some of the elect Prince's Council, touching the ordering of the Ceremonies, and wording the Oath to be by him taken. <HI>Garter</HI> is likewise to con∣sider what Places in the elect Prince's Court are fit to per∣form the Ceremony, and to see them made ready, and to instruct his Officers, what Duties and Services they are to undertake.</P>
<P>If the great Hall, or other large Room, be appointed, there ought to be prepared a Table, with a rich Carpet, whereon the Habit and Ensigns of the <HI>Order</HI> are to be laid, while the Sovereign's Commission of Legation is read; another Table should be prepared for the Stranger who receives the <HI>Order;</HI> and a third for the Sovereign's Am∣bassador.</P>
<P>In the Church or Chappel where they are to proceed to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Divine Service, a Stall is to be erected under a Cloth of State, on the Right Hand Entrance of the Choir, for the Sovereign of the <HI>Order,</HI> wherein is to be fixed the <HI>Majesty Escutcheon</HI> of the Sovereign's Arms; another Stall is also to be placed on the same side of the Choir for the invested Stranger, at the same distance from the Sovereign's
<PB N="377" REF="387"/>
Stall, as is that for the elect Stranger in the Choir at <HI>Windsor;</HI> in which is to be fixt the <HI>Majesty Escutcheon</HI> of his own Arms, brought likewise over by <HI>Garter</HI> or his Deputy; a third Stall is to be erected for the Lord Am∣bassador, who (if a <HI>Knight-Companion)</HI> hath an <HI>Escutcheon</HI> of his own Arms within a <HI>Garter</HI> set over it; for so had the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiss of <HI>Northampton,</HI> at the Investiture of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. and the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> at that of <HI>Henry</HI> III. under all these <HI>Escutcheons of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms,</HI> the Stiles and Titles (fairly Written) of the <HI>Sove∣reign,</HI> and each <HI>Knight-Companion,</HI> are to be affix'd.</P>
<P>Where there is no solemn Proceeding to Church, the Sovereign's <HI>Escutcheon of Arms,</HI> with his Titles, have been set up at the upper end of the Room, where the Investi∣ture is performed; so also the Stranger Knight's at due distance, as at the Investiture of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> in his Tent at the <HI>Leaguer,</HI> near <HI>Darshaw,</HI> in <HI>Prussia,</HI> 23 <HI>September, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Car.</HI> I.</P>
<P>Besides the before-mentioned Preparations; the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>Chappel,</HI> into which the new invested Stranger proceeds, is to be richly adorned, as we find by several Instances; as at the Investiture of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. when the Church of <HI>Augustine Fryars</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> was hung with rich <HI>Arras,</HI> and all the <HI>Choir</HI> and <HI>Stalls</HI> with <HI>Cloth of Gold.</HI> On the Day the Solemnity of Investiture is celebrated, the elect Stranger sends his Coach, and some Persons of Quality, to Accompany the Sovereign's Ambassadors to his Court. At the Investiture of <HI>Henry,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange, Frederick,</HI> Prince Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> sat with the Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>count <HI>Charle∣ton,</HI> in one Boot of the Prince's Coach, and Sir <HI>William Segar</HI> in the other; and were met by the said Prince at the Foot of the Stairs of his Court, and conducted thence into his great Chamber.</P>
<P>After such time as the elect Stranger, and the Sove∣reign's Ambassadors, have a while retired; the Stranger usually first enters the Room appointed for the Ceremony, and stands under his own S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, expecting the coming in of the Ambassadors, and notice thereof being given them, they (reposing in a Room near) proceed in manner following.</P>
<P>Servants to the Lord Ambassador, two and two.</P>

<P>Lastly, The Lord Ambassador, or chief in the Embassy, who, if a <HI>Knight-Companion,</HI> proceedeth in his compleat Habit.</P>
<P>If any other <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> is present, he also wears his whole Habit of the <HI>Order,</HI> as did the Constable of <HI>France,</HI> at the Investiture of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> II. The said Constable al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o pair'd in the Proceeding with the Sovereign's Ambassador.</P>
<P>In going up to the Sovereign's State, they all make three Reverences, and drawi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g near, the Ambassadors Servants fall off on either side for the <HI>Herald</HI> to pass up to the Table, set before the Sovereign's State; whereon (with a single Reverence) he lays the Robes.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Garter</HI> draws near the Table also, and with a like Reverence towards the Sovereign's State deposites the <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Ambassador follows, and makes his Reve∣rence towards the Sovereign's State, and after turning to the Stranger elect, and doing him Reverence, he (or some other fit Person) delivers himself in a short, but grave, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arned Oration; <Q>in which he not only sets forth the Prai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of the illustrious <HI>Order,</HI> and of the King the So∣vereign, but also the Virtues, the memorable and praise-worthy Actions of the elect Stranger, to whom the Habit and Ensigns of the <HI>Order</HI> are sent: Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther are his Ancestors (if any of them have attain'd the Honour of this <HI>Order,)</HI> past over in Silence, that thereby his Heart (already breathing impatience and desire,) m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be so much the more inflamed with an Earnestne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to obtain the Honour and Favour of this so great a Dig∣nity.</Q></P>
<Q><P>He adds besides, that the Sovereign having well weigh'd these and the like things in his Mind, and maturely advis'd thereof with his <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI>
<PB N="379" REF="389"/>
they were perswaded and well satisfied in themselves, to nominate and chuse him before others; to the end that he might both himself be honoured by the Choice of such a Person, and also thereby give an increase and addition of Lustre to those renowned Actions and Vir∣tues, which already were a chief Ornament to him.</P><P>Lastly, He points towards the <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> which he declares to have been sent by the Sovere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn, out of great Love, and singular Affection, to dignify him therewith, as to a Person to whom he wish'd as well and honourably as to any other Prince whatsoever, and withall intreats him kindly to accept thereof, and wear them in remembrance of the Sovereign and his <HI>Order.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This or the like Oration being ended, the Ambassadors present the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Commission of <HI>Legation</HI> to the elect S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranger, who delivers it to his Secretary, and he publickly Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it.</P>
<P>At the before-mentioned Investiture of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> II. the Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> one of the Commissioners of the <HI>Legation,</HI> made the Speech, to which the Cardinal of <HI>Lorrain</HI> returned Answer in the said King's behalf, with all thankful Acknowledgments of the Honour of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>After the Commission is read, <HI>Garter</HI> presents the Oath fairly Written, which is administred to the elect Stran∣ger, where, if any Exceptions were before made and ad∣mitted, they must be rehears'd, as we find it directed in the instructions given for the Investiture of <HI>James</HI> V. King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Ceremony of the Oath being finish'd, <HI>Garter</HI> takes from off the Cushion the Garter, and having k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss'd it, presents it to the Lord Ambassador, who kneel∣ing d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn, puts it with all Reverence on the Stranger's left Leg, being assisted by <HI>Garter,</HI> who pronounces these W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds of <HI>Signification.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="380" REF="390"/>
This being said, <HI>Garter</HI> takes the <HI>Surcoat,</HI> and with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ceremony of a Kiss, delivers it to the Lord Ambassa∣dor, who (after the Stranger elect hath put off h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cloak or upper Garment, and Sword,) puts it upon him in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner: First, The Lord Ambassador begins at the Stranger's Right Arm, and <HI>Garter</HI> (or the <HI>Leiger Ambas∣sador</HI> if present,) assists at the left Shoulder. The Stran∣ger being thus vested with the <HI>Surcoat,</HI> both the Lord <HI>Ambassador</HI> and <HI>Garter</HI> gird his Sword about him, with a Velvet Girdle of the same Colour, at the doing where∣of <HI>Garter</HI> saith these Words.</P>

<P>After this, <HI>Garter</HI> takes up the <HI>Mantle</HI> and <HI>Hood,</HI> which, in like manner kissing, he delivers to the Lord Ambas∣sador, who invests the Stranger therewith, and lays the Hood upon his right Shoulder; (the Train being given into the Hands of some Noble Personage to be born u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>Garter</HI> also pronouncing these Words.</P>

<P>When the Ceremony of Investiture is finished, the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Ambassador</HI> congratulateth the new invested Stranger in the
<PB N="381" REF="391"/>
Sovereign's Name, and in the Name of all the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and then delivers him his Velvet Cap, adorn∣ed with white Plumes, and the Book of <HI>Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>The Stranger being thus invested, stayeth a while in the Room, where he received this Honour, with the Am∣bass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dor, and after Complements of Congratulation be∣tween them, he goeth to the Church in a solemn manner, having the Train of his <HI>Mantle</HI> born up; at the Entrance into the Church, all in the Procession make three Reve∣rences, the first towards the <HI>High Altar,</HI> the next to∣wards the Sovereign's Stall, and the third towards the new invested Stranger's Stall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Ambassador</HI> proceedeth towards the Seat assign'd for him, and stands before it till the Stranger hath a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cended his Stall, and after making his Reverences, (as before) takes his; then <HI>Garter</HI> making the like Reveren∣ces, sits down on a Chair, plac'd for him before the So∣vereign's Stall.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Herald at Arms</HI> ought to be often near the Stranger, or else the <HI>Lord Ambassador,</HI> to inform them of the <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Ceremony,</HI> because <HI>Garter</HI> is obliged to attend the Sovereign's Royal Stall.</P>
<P>After a solemn Anthem, <HI>Garter</HI> passeth in the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> and by a Reverence, first to the invested Stranger, and next to the <HI>Lord Ambassador,</HI> gives them the Signal for descending, and being both come down, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a ter</HI> passeth up before the Stranger to the <HI>High Altar,</HI> where he makes his Offering of Gold and Silver, being accompanied with the <HI>Lord Ambassador,</HI> the <HI>Herald</HI> laying the Cushion whereon he kneels when he Offers.</P>
<P>But if a <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> be sent on this <HI>Legation,</HI> then he proceeds first up to the <HI>Altar,</HI> preceeded by <HI>Gar∣ter,</HI> and Offers for the Sovereign, which done, he returns to his own Stall: Next, the invested Stranger proceeds up, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>receeded as before,) Offers, and returns back to his own Stall; afterwards the aforesaid <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds up again, and Offers for himself: And in this <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der</HI> was the Offering made when the Emperor <HI>Max∣imilian</HI> was invested at <HI>Vienna, January</HI> 4. <HI>Anno</HI> 10 <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz.</HI></P>
<P>The new invested Stranger having offered, returns to his Stall, and the <HI>Lord Ambassador,</HI> with three Reverences, takes his Seat, the <HI>Organs,</HI> &amp;c. playing all the while
<PB N="382" REF="392"/>
When the solemn Service is finish'd, the Stranger descends again from his Stall, and with the Proceeding before him, returns in the same Order he came to the Room, where he received his Investiture.</P>
<P>It's observable, that the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> out of a compliance with the Protestant Religion, caused, on the Day of his Investiture, all Prayers to Saints incensing, and other Matters and Ceremonies not used by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be wholly omitted at the Service in his Chappel.</P>
<P>At these great Solemnities, the invested Strangers have heretofore held most magnificent Feasts, but of late they are not so much in Use: And when Dinner was ready, they proceeded thither in their whole Habit, which they wore all Dinner time.</P>
<P>At the Investiture of <HI>Christian</HI> IV. King of <HI>Denmark, Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the Sovereign's Stiles and Titles of Ho∣nour were proclaimed thrice, (before they sat down to Dinner,) and the said King's twice; but when <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> received Investiture, the Stiles were proclaimed immediately after they were in∣vested, and in the same Room, the Ceremony being per∣form'd to both in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>At the Feast made by <HI>Maximilian</HI> I. (King of the <HI>Ro∣mans,)</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Somerset,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iothesley,</HI> sent on the Embassy, was admitted to his Table, and sat on his left Hand: On the Day of Investiture of <HI>Don Fer∣dinand,</HI> Prince of <HI>Spain,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> the Lord <HI>Morley,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Hussey,</HI> sat on his right Hand at Dinner, and Dr <HI>Lee,</HI> and the said Sir <HI>Thomas Wriothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey,</HI> on his left; these four being join'd in the Commission of <HI>Legation.</HI></P>
<P>At a Feast on the like Occasion by the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> II. he admitted to his Table (beside the Marqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the principal Person in the <HI>Legation,)</HI> the before-mentioned Constable of <HI>France;</HI> and all three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at in their full Robes of the <HI>Garter,</HI> which they put not off till after Dinner. The Cardinal of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sat also at the King's Table, but it was on the other side.</P>
<P>When the Investiture was performed in the Afternoon, then was the Grand Dinner turn'd into a Supper; as it was at the Investiture of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor, and two of the <HI>French</HI> Kings; but when <HI>Henry,</HI> Prince of
<PB N="383" REF="393"/>
<HI>Orange,</HI> receiv'd the <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> there was no Feast at all, but purposely omitted, to prevent the dif∣ference which might have been occasioned by the Prece∣dency and Place, between Ambassadors drinking of Healths, and other Complements.</P>
<P>On this Solemnity, and the Honour they deriv'd from it, some have thought fit to transmit the Memory to Posterity, by Medals, with Inscriptions relating thereto; such were those of Gold and Silver, which <HI>Frederick,</HI> Duke of <HI>Wir∣temberg,</HI> caused to be made; as also those made by <HI>Charles,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>

<P>§ 4. The magnificent Solemnity of Investiture, &amp;c. being compleatly finish'd, and the Ambass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dors having fully performed their Duties therein; they are yet fur∣ther to obtain from the new invested Stranger, before their departure, a publick Instrument, testifying the reception of the said Habit and Ensigns, Sign'd with his Hand, and Sealed with his Great Seal; this we find anciently done in several Instances, and is generally demanded and ob∣tain'd.</P>
<P>Hereupon a Clause to this Effect is usually added, in Instructions given to Ambassadors; as appears from those to the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> and <HI>Garter,</HI> in the Embassy to <HI>James</HI> V. King of <HI>Scotland;</HI> namely, that <HI>Garter should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emember</HI> (after the Investiture was performed,) <HI>to Purchase, and Sollicit a Certificate from the said King, of his re∣ception of the Order, and taking the Oath, both under his Seal.</HI></P>
<P>The Form and Substance of these Certificates are much alike; for after a reci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of all the Powers given to the Ambassadors nam'd in the Commission of <HI>Legation,</HI> the Stranger Prince first makes Certificate of his receiving, and Investiture with the <HI>Mantle, Surcoat, Collar,</HI> and other Ornaments of the <HI>Order;</HI> and that they receiv'd them from the Sovereign's Ambassador, with the accu∣stom'd Solemnities.</P>
<P>In some of these Certificates, namely from <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> Prince of <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 15 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. from <HI>Francis</HI> I.
<PB N="384" REF="394"/>
the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Anno</HI> 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and from <HI>Gustavus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden, Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Car.</HI> I. we find the taking the Oath appointed by the Statutes to be also certified. Of the return of these Certificates, the Annals of the <HI>Order</HI> sometimes take notice, and by a Decree, 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. care was taken to oblige the Ambassadors to produce these Cer∣tificates to the Sovereign at their return.</P>
<P>The Stranger Prince hath been pleas'd sometimes, to give with the Certificate, a particular Testimonial of <HI>Gar∣ter</HI>'s punctual discharge of his Duty in the <HI>Legation,</HI> or of the Officer of Arms employed in his stead; as did <HI>Gusta∣vus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the preamble of his <HI>Diploma,</HI> whereby he testifies the bestowing upon <HI>Henry St. George, Richmond Herald,</HI> the Honour of Knighthood; they have also usually given <HI>Garter</HI> Gratuities, either in Money, Diamonds, or some other Present of great value, of which several Instances might be produced.</P>

<HEAD>CAP. XVI. The Installation of a Stranger by Proxy.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Touching the Choice and Nomination of a Proxy.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. AFter the Stranger is invested, he is enjoin'd by the Statutes (be he of what State or Condition soever,) to send in eight Months after his Investiture, either a <HI>Proctor</HI> or <HI>Deputy</HI> to be in∣stalled in his behalf, in the Seat assign'd him within the Chappel of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>The Time limited for send<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in <HI>Henry</HI> Vth's Statutes, is but seven Months; and those of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. allow no more; and that not only after Investiture, but after the Stranger hath certified the Sovereign of his reception of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By King</HI> Henry <HI>VIIIth's Statutes, it's also provided;</HI> That in case a Stranger do not send his <HI>Deputy</HI> or <HI>Proct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> within seven Months<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out having a reasonable Excuse, and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s should be allowed by the Sovereign or his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="385" REF="395"/>
the Election <HI>(notwithstanding his former Acceptation,)</HI> should be also void, except so it be, that the Stranger be hindred or disturbed by great Affairs, and then might he send his Excuse to the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vereign, or his Deputy, within one Month after; and according as the Sovereign or his Deputy should allow or disallow of his Excuse, that then the Sove∣reign or his Deputy might give unto him four Months of res∣pite more; within which time, if he neither come, nor send his Deputy to be installed for him, then the said Election should be void for that time.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Francis</HI> I. was so earnest for com∣pleating this Honour, that he dispatch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his Proctor hither with all the speed he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld, and most of the Stranger Princes have sent their <HI>Deputies</HI> within the limited time, there being very few Instances to the contrary, and those were occasioned through the multiplicity of Affairs.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George</HI> only have been sent to a Stranger, the Ceremony of In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tallation hath been dispenc'd with, till a more convenient time, as appears from the Instructions of <HI>March</HI> 4. <HI>Anno</HI> 19 <HI>Car.</HI> I. given at the sending these two principal <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> to <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> Prince of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nard de Foix,</HI> Duke <HI>d'Es∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non,</HI> (in regard of the Interruptions then given by the Rebellion here,) such dispensations, and for the same rea∣son, was King <HI>Charles</HI> II. necessitated to give those S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ran∣gers whom he honoured with Election, while he remain'd in Foreign Parts.</P>
<P>Upon the said King's happy Restauration, among many other things relating to the <HI>Order,</HI> this particular was taken into consideration, in reference not only to the Duke <HI>de Espernon</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> who were dead, but those Strangers also then living; and at two <HI>Chapters</HI> held at <HI>White-Hall, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. directions were given to <HI>Garter</HI> to place the <HI>Banners</HI> and <HI>Atchievements</HI> of the sur∣viving Strangers over their respective Stalls; and the So∣vereign, by his supream Power, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c'd by the impos∣sibilities of the late Troubles to pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>form the Installation, and by reason of the time elaps'd si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce their Elections,) di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>penc'd wholly and absolutel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with their Installa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, but at the same time declar'd, that as the like ne∣cessity and conjuncture could never happen again, so he would not, on any motion or pretence whatsoever, give the like dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensation.</P>

It seems to rest in the pleasure of the Stranger, whe∣ther he will chuse to send over any Person of his own Court, or give his Procuration to some one of the So∣vereign's S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bjects, to receive his Stall, and in his Name to take Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssion of it; the latter of which hath been done several times, out of desire to favour some of our Nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity with this Honour, of which many instances might be given.</P>
<P>It ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h sometimes happned, that a <HI>Proctor</HI> for the In∣stallation of a Stranger, hath been appointed and nomina∣ted by the Sovereign of the <HI>Order,</HI> though the Principal had nam'd another before: Thus it fell out in the case of <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange, Anno</HI> 10 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. who having deputed Count <HI>Henry</HI> his Brother, to be installed for him, and he having put to Sea in Order thereto, but by reason of contrary Winds not arriving in <HI>England</HI> before the Day appointed for his Installation, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> ordered that <HI>Lodowick</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> Kinsman to the elect Prince, should take Possession of his Stall on his behalf: A case somewhat like, was that of <HI>John George,</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who sent over his Procuration to <HI>John,</HI> Earl of <HI>Bath;</HI> and he being detained in the West on ex∣traordinary Occasions, when St. <HI>George</HI>'s F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast was held at <HI>Windsor, Anno</HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. wrote to the <HI>Chanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llor</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> to obtain the Sovereign's Dispensation, for not appearing in the Name of his Principal; who repre∣senting his humble request to the Sovere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn, in a <HI>Chapter</HI> held on the Eve of the said Feast, he was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas'd to grant it, and appointed <HI>Heneage,</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> who per∣form'd the Service. There is also an ancient Example of this kind, <HI>Anno</HI> 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. where the Sovereign n mi∣nated the Lord <HI>Fitz Hugh, Proct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> for the King of <HI>Den∣mark;</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et was not done, till after the Sovereign had been certified that the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vested, and obliged himself by Oath to the observation of the <HI>Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner it is recorded, that the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI> was by the Sovereign appointed Deputy for the Instal∣lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and yet not unlike, but this might be with con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of the said King, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh the Annals herein are silent.</P>

<P>The Warrants for removing of Stalls, and for the Strangers Atchievements, are all to be obtain'd by the Chancellor of the Order, under the Sovereign's Sign Ma∣nual, to which the Signet of the Order is to be affixt.</P>
<P>The Strangers Atchievements (as mention'd in the Warrant,) are to be provided at the Sovereign's Charge; namely, his <HI>Helm, Crest, Mantlings,</HI> and <HI>Sword,</HI> together with a <HI>Banner</HI> of his <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Quarterings;</HI> and these the Proctor is enjoin'd to bring along with him to <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes a Warrant hath been directed to the Master of the <HI>Wardrobe,</HI> to provide but some part of these A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣chievements; and another Warrant to the Lord Treasu∣rer of <HI>England,</HI> to deliver <HI>Garter</HI> Money to provide the other part; in each of which, the particulars relating to either are enumerated; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o were the Warrants drawn up for the Atchieveme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> II.

<P>Sometimes particular Warrants have been directed to the Master of the <HI>Wardrobe,</HI> to deliver several Parcels of the Materials, for the making up these Atchievements; as were those Warrants, to deliver the Sovereign's Em∣broiderer, and to <HI>Garter,</HI> so much Velvet, Cloth of Gold, &amp;c. for making the great Banner, and other the At∣chievements of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arles</HI> IX. and <HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>French</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>It also appears that <HI>Garter</HI> hath sometimes laid out the Money for all, or part of the Atchievements, and then de∣livered his Bill of disbursements into the <HI>Wardrobe;</HI> as is manifest from those Bills for the Atchievements of <HI>Frede∣rick</HI> II.

<P>Besides the Atchievements, some other things used at the Solemnity are commonly included in the forelaid War∣rants; the <HI>Mantle</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> is not prepared at the So∣vereign's Charge, for the Statutes of Insti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution appoint the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oxy to bring one with him, not that the Sovereign shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d provide it, having done that before, at the Lega∣tion with the whole <HI>Habit;</HI> nor is it found in the Rolls or Books of the Sovereign's great <HI>Wardrobe,</HI> that any Account

'Tis observed, that the Proxies of Strangers have not always gone in the Proceeding, but sometimes staid at their Lodging, till the Commissioners were ready to send for them to the <HI>Chapter-House.</HI> As at the Installation of <HI>Charles</HI> IX.

<HEAD>The Ceremonies perform'd therein.</HEAD>
<P>§ 9. When the Proceeding hath arrived at the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door, the Sovereign, and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> or the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utenant, &amp;c. with the Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, enter to hold their Consultation; the Stranger's <HI>Proxy</HI> being first requested to stay without, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll his Depu∣tation, or Letters of Procuration are read, to the end they may understand the effect thereof.</P>
<P>To this purpose we find it directed, by an ancient Hand, that where any Knight is installed by his Deputy, he ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to stay without the Vestry, or <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll he be introduced by two <HI>Knights-Companions:</HI> So the Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> one of the Commissioners for Installation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> when the Proceeding was come to the
<PB N="395" REF="405"/>
<HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door, acquainted his <HI>Proxy</HI> with this Cu∣stom and Injunction, which he complied with.</P>
<P>The East-Isle, behind the High Altar, is the usual Place for <HI>Proxies</HI> to stay, till they are called into the <HI>Chapter,</HI> as it is also for the <HI>Deputies</HI> of <HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> where Chairs and Cushions are prepared for this occasion.</P>
<P>The first thing done after the <HI>Chapter</HI> is opened, is reading the Commission for <HI>Installation,</HI> by the <HI>Register</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> (but if the Sovereign be present, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommis∣sion issues,) and next, the Letters of Procuration; this be∣ing the most usual and proper Place for this Ceremony</P>
<P>However, at the <HI>Installation</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Fran∣cis</HI> I. by a very unusual compliance, the Commissioners went from the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> after they had called in and invested the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> with his <HI>Surcoat</HI> and <HI>Hood,</HI> to the <HI>Dean's</HI> House, where the <HI>Proctor</HI> was lodg'd, and in a great Chamber there, shewed him the Sovereign's Commission, and in it the Authority for admitting him into the Stall of his Lord and Master: Upon which the <HI>Proctor</HI> presented them with his Procuration, which im∣powered him to take Possession of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and to perform what Ceremonies related to it; which Instrument the <HI>Register</HI> read before them. This being done, they all proceeded to the Chappel; where entering, they waved their return to the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and passed directly into the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>After some time of Consultation in the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> the <HI>Proxy</HI> is sent for in thither by <HI>Garter,</HI> who conducts him to the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door, and his Reception there by the Commissioners is after the same manner as is u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to the <HI>Knight elect,</HI> or to his <HI>Proxy:</HI> But whether he ought to enter the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> or be admitted any farther than the Door, or Porch thereof, and to pass thence immediately into the <HI>Choir,</HI> hath been some Question; because the Practice seems to have been sometimes one way, sometimes another.</P>
<P>All that we find to prohibit his Entrance therein, is an Expression in the short Ceremonial of <HI>Installation</HI> of Strangers by <HI>Proxy,</HI> entered in the <HI>Black-Book;</HI> where it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays—That the <HI>Mantle</HI> is to be laid on the <HI>Proctor's</HI> right Shoulder, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orch of the <HI>Chapter-House, because he is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to enter into it.</HI></P>
<P>And there are two Instances where the <HI>Mantle</HI> was deli∣vered to the <HI>Proctor</HI> at the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door; from
<PB N="396" REF="406"/>
whence some may infer, that the Practice of those Times was also agreeable to the aforesaid direction; namely, that of the <HI>Proctor</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Francis</HI> I. 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. where <HI>Garter</HI> stood at the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, with the <HI>Mantle,</HI> and as the Proceeding passed by, pre∣sented it to the two Senior <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who placed it upon the <HI>Proctor's</HI> right Arm; and so of the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣ctor</HI> of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> who entered not into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> but had the <HI>Mantle</HI> discussed at the Door.</P>
<P>But these Instances, if duly weighed, cannot properly, or with any Advantage, be alledged to prove the Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on; because the Affairs relating to both, receiv'd dispa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch in the <HI>Proctors</HI> Lodging a little before, and where the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>octor</HI> himself was present, where the meeting of the Commis∣sioners and Proctor cannot be deemed less than a <HI>Chapter,</HI> tho' not held in the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> from the Transactions that passed there, <HI>viz.</HI> producing the Sovereign's Warra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and the <HI>Proctor's</HI> Instrument of Deputation, which were both read before them by the <HI>Register,</HI> and the <HI>Proctor</HI> accordingly admitted, which being finished, nothing re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣ting to the present purpose required their passing into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> or remained to be done till they came into the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>But the general Practice runs strong on the contrary side; for we find that the <HI>Proctor</HI> for <HI>Charles</HI> IX. King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>France,</HI> 8 <HI>Eliz.</HI> was met at the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, by the Earls of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Leicester,</HI> who took him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> between them, where, after the <HI>Register</HI> had read, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sovereign's Commission for Installation, as his Letters of Procuration, and the Commissioners had admitted him <HI>Deputy</HI> for the said King, they all came forth, and laid his Principal's <HI>Mantle</HI> on his right Arm and Shoulder, the Train whereof was born by the Earl of <HI>Southamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sisted by the Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> of <HI>Cardiff.</HI></P>
<P>Again it is remarkable, 25 <HI>Eliz.</HI> that <HI>Garter</HI> cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted the <HI>Proxy</HI> of <HI>Frederick</HI> II. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ter-House,</HI> and at that Place the Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> received and led him in: So a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Christian</HI> IVth's <HI>Proxy</HI> led thither, by the Earls of <HI>N <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in∣gham</HI> and <HI>Dorset.</HI> And in <HI>Jac.</HI> I. <HI>Lodowick,</HI> Count <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Proctor</HI> to <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was called into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and there lest, while the Sovereign, and
<PB N="397" REF="407"/>
<HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> proceeded into the <HI>Choir:</HI> Also in like manner was Sir <HI>George Cartaret, Proctor</HI> to <HI>Christian,</HI> Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II. and the <HI>Proctors</HI> to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>
<P>Nor are these Instances, and the Practice in this latter case, really derogatory to the Statutes, which, though they prohibit the <HI>Proxies</HI> Entrance into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> yet do not extend to any thing previous to the Installation, but what may happen after; for the Article of the <HI>Statutes</HI> having first dire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the delivery of the <HI>Mantle</HI> to the <HI>Proxy,</HI> and next the assumption of his <HI>Principal's Stall,</HI> in these Words, <HI>Dictus Procurator Installatus,</HI> it immediately subjoins, <HI>that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om thenceforth,</HI> that is, from the time of Installation, <HI>he shall neither wear the</HI> Mantle, <HI>nor enter into the</HI> Chapter, <HI>nor have Voice there, by virtue of any Power g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anted him.</HI> All which are Prohibitions, plainly relating to future Examples, and arising after the Ceremonies of In∣stallation are past, and not at all refering to what preceeds it.</P>
<P>And it seems the Law hath been thus understood, in regard the greater prevalence of Practice hath generally attended it; for not only the <HI>Proxies</HI> of Strangers, as is observed, but generally <HI>Knights-Subjects,</HI> have been cal∣led into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and there received the <HI>Mantle,</HI> before they proceeded into the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>The Ceremony of delivering the <HI>Mantle</HI> to the <HI>Proctor,</HI> is performed by the Sovereign, his Deputy, or the Com∣missioners, <HI>Garter</HI> presenting it to them; and the manner of it was anciently, by putting it on the <HI>Proxies</HI> right Arm or Shoulder, in the Name of his Lord and Master, there to hold it till the End of Divine Service.</P>
<P>But as there hath arisen some dispute, touching the <HI>Proctor's</HI> entry into the <HI>Chapter-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use</HI> before Installation, so it hath happened in this P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int of receiving the <HI>Mantle, viz.</HI> whether in the <HI>Chapter,</HI> or <HI>Stall</HI> allotted their <HI>Prin∣cipal,</HI> of which there are Exam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les.</P>
<P>That part of the Article in the <HI>Statutes</HI> of <HI>Institution,</HI> relating to this Point, runs thus:—<HI>That the</HI> Mantle, <HI>tem∣pore Install<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tionis Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curatoris,</HI> shall be laid on his Arm, &amp;c. but whether this shall be construed to that instant of time, when the <HI>Proctor</HI> is brought to the <HI>Stall</HI> of his <HI>Prin∣cipal,</HI> or to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me greater Latitude, as during the time of I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stallation, including the very first Action, or beginning of the Ceremony, namely, the being called to the <HI>Chapter-Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="398" REF="408"/>
Door, and entrance into it, is the Question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be∣cause there are Instances in both, but the latter is most wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>antable by the <HI>Statutes</HI> and general Practice.</P>
<P>The Article in <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's <HI>Statutes</HI> being much more clear in describing and explaining the Ceremonies of <HI>In∣stallation,</HI> than any of the former; (the particulars of which in every Point seems to be excellently regulated,) having mentioned the Sovereign, or his <HI>Deputies,</HI> laying the <HI>Mantle</HI> on the <HI>Proxies</HI> Arm, it immediately follows, as the very next thing to be performed in course of time; <HI>That afterwards he shall be led by two Knights, from the</HI> Chapter-House <HI>Door to the</HI> Stall, <HI>and there being, shall make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Oath, and be installed;</HI> it gives no Account of laying the <HI>Mantle</HI> on the Arm of the <HI>Proctor</HI> at the in∣stant of <HI>Installation</HI> in the <HI>Choir,</HI> that being directed to be done before. It is also recorded in the <HI>Black-Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> where this Ceremony is more fully treated; <HI>That</HI> Garter <HI>shall take the</HI> Mantle <HI>upon his Arms, and deliver it to both the</HI> Knights-Commissioners, <HI>and that they</HI> (according to the Tenour of the Statutes,) <HI>shall lay it on the</HI> Proctor's <HI>right Shoulder, in the Porch of the</HI> Chapter-House.</P>
<P>Besides, the ancient usage of receiving the <HI>Mantle</HI> in the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> or at the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door, either before, or in the Proceeding to the <HI>Choir,</HI> of which many instances may be given, there are several modern instances where the <HI>Mantle</HI> was born to the <HI>Choir,</HI> (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d sometimes the <HI>Collar</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> with it,) not by the <HI>Proctor,</HI> but by <HI>Garter,</HI> before him, and delivered in his <HI>Principal's Stall;</HI> as in the Proceeding of the <HI>Proxy</HI> for the Duke of <HI>Wir∣tembergh, Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. when, after he had taken the Oath, and was led into the Duke's <HI>Stall,</HI> (not before) was the Robe laid on his Arm; and so was it done in many more <HI>Installations;</HI> which manner hath so far prevail'd as to be the continu'd Practice, <HI>Garter</HI> carrying the <HI>Mantle</HI> on a Cushion before the <HI>Proctors</HI> into the <HI>Choir,</HI> and laying it (after they have taken their Oaths<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) on their Arms in such manner, that the <HI>Cross</HI> of St. <HI>George</HI> may be con∣spicuous.</P>

<P>Since the Custom of receiving the <HI>Collar</HI> in the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> was laid aside, the Sovereign, (or his Lieutenant,) with the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> (so soon as the <HI>Mantle</HI> is de∣livered the <HI>Proctor,</HI> or (as of late) that he hath been ad∣mitted according to the purport of his Deputation,) pro∣ceed to the <HI>Choir,</HI> leaving the <HI>Proxy</HI> behind them in the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and after they have taken their <HI>Stalls,</HI> the Sovereign directs two of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to de∣scend; who taking the <HI>Alms-Knights, Officers of Arms,</HI> and the three inferior Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> before them, pass to the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and bring thence the <HI>Proxy</HI> to his <HI>Installation.</HI> In this Proceeding the <HI>Proxy</HI> goes Bare∣headed, as did the Earl of <HI>Dover, Proctor</HI> to <HI>Charles,</HI> Prince Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Cartaret, Proctor</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Denmark, Anno</HI> 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>

<P>§ 4.

<P>To this purpose Privy-Seals were issued to the Lord T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easurer for the time being, to pay the Fees to the <HI>Re∣gister</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> out of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which was the constant Custom, till King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in the 13th Year of his Reign, settled an Annual Pension of 1200 <HI>l.</HI> upon the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der;</HI> and by a Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion in the said Year, im∣power'd the Chancellor of the <HI>Order,</HI> and his Successors, to pay out of the same, not only the ordinary, but also ex∣traordinary Charges of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der;</HI> wherein the Fees for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstallation</HI> of Strangers are included.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Grand Feast appointed to be celebrated Annu∣ally on St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§ 1. BY the <HI>Statutes</HI> of <HI>Institution,</HI> it's ordain'd, That a solemn Festival should be Annually celebrated on the 23d Day of <HI>April,</HI> or St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> in Honour of the Patron of the <HI>Order,</HI> as is observed in other military Orders, erected since this of the <HI>Garter,</HI> to which this seems to give Rules of holding their Festi∣vals on the Anniversary of their Patrons. Thus <HI>Philip,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> on his erecting the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> taking St. <HI>Andrew</HI> for its Patron, appointed the Festival on St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s <HI>Day.

<HEAD>St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day</HI> kept apart from the Grand Feast, and how then observed.</HEAD>
<P>§ 5. How this Noble <HI>Order</HI> flourished from its Foun∣dation to the time of <HI>Henry</HI> V. no Account can be given, since the Annals thereof are wanting to his Reign; but then it appears to have been in considerable S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lendor; but the Civil Wars toward the end of <HI>Henry</HI> VIth's Reign, eclipsed it for a while. Under King <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ward</HI> IV. when things were a little settled, it seem'd to recover; and in K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's time, was at a greater heighth than e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er. However, though the several Branches of the <HI>Order</HI> receiv'd some Augmentation from the influence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this
<PB N="412" REF="422"/>
Monarch, yet the Grand Feast began to decline, by a re∣moval of the observation of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day</HI> from <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI> and a prorogatory Celebration of the Grand Feast to other times.</P>
<P>The Article of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> causing this great alteration from the original design of the first Institution, gives the Sovereign Power to prorogue the Grand Feast at his Plea∣sure; but then 'tis evident from the same Statute, that St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day</HI> was nevertheless ordained to be duly obler∣ved by it self, in what Place soever the Sovereign (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h∣in the Realm) should then reside; <HI>Windsor</HI> hereby being not excluded.</P>
<P>It farther implies, the sacred <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> to be per∣formed, with other Matters concerning the <HI>Order;</HI> for be∣sides the particulars therein enumerated, this general Clause is observable: That what other urgent Affair s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ever, relating to the <HI>Order,</HI> should offer it self to be per∣formed, the same might be treated of, and receive dis∣patches, in the <HI>Chapter</HI> held where the Sovereign then should be, as fully as if he were at <HI>Windsor Castle.</HI></P>
<P>So that henceforward, all things began to be ordered, both on the Eve the Day of St. <HI>George,</HI> and the Morrow after, with as great State; all Affairs as legally dispatched, and all Ceremonies as magnificently performed, except that of offering up of Atchie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ements, which is peculiar to the Chappel of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor</HI> only, as cou'd be observed at the <HI>Grand Festival</HI> it self.</P>
<P>And how, by Virtue of this Article, and with what Ceremonies St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day</HI> was held, when the Grand Feast was prorogued, is evident from a full and ample Pre∣cedent, 22 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. now remaining in the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms.</HI></P>
<P>For though the Sovereign with 13 <HI>Knights-Compani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> were at <HI>Windsor</HI> that Year, upon the 22, 23 and 24 of <HI>April,</HI> yet at that time they observed only the Feast Day of St. <HI>George,</HI> with the Eve and Morrow after, but de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣red, by Order in <HI>Chapter,</HI> the Celeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation of the Grand Feast, to the 8th of <HI>May</HI> ensuing.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Grand Feast neglected by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.</HEAD>
<P>§ 6. From the Accession of this Prince, the Sovereignty of this <HI>Order</HI> became more neglected, so that during his
<PB N="413" REF="423"/>
no Anniversary of St. <HI>George</HI> was kept at <HI>Windsor,</HI> y a <HI>Grand Festival.</HI></P>
<P>This is supposed to be owing to the common Calamity of that Age, wherein most Ceremonies, solemn or splen∣did, especially such as related to Divine Services, came under the denomination of being either Superstitious or Idolatrous. Insomuch, that at a <HI>Chapter</HI> held at <HI>Green∣wich,</HI> 2 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. an Abolition being intended for such Ceremonies as were not consonant to the King's Injun∣ctions, lately prescribed, it was then decreed, that then, and for ever from thenceforth, at the Feast of this most Noble <HI>Order,</HI> no other Ceremonies should be observed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han such as were appointed by his Majesties Letter.</P>
<P>That no Procession should be made with going about the Church, or Church-yard, but the King's Majesty's Procession, lately set forth in <HI>English</HI> to be used. His Majesty and other <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> sitting in their Stalls, at the Entry, such Reverences to be made to the King's Majesty only as was heretofore. The Offering to be in the Box for the Poor, with∣out any other Reverence, or kissing any Paten, or other thing; but only at the return, due Reverence to the King, as was used before. The Mass of <HI>Requiem</HI> to be left undone, but yet, both on St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> and for next Day, a Mass to be S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng with great Reverence; in which, immediately after the Words of Consecration is said, the Priest shall say the <HI>Pater Noster,</HI> and so turn and Communicate to all, or so many of the <HI>Order,</HI> or other, after they have done, as shall be disposed to receive the Communion, according to the <HI>Order</HI> prescribed by his Majesty's Book of Communion, and without any other Rite or Ceremony after the said Communion to be used; ex∣cept some godly Psalm or Hymn to be Sung in <HI>English,</HI> and so to end the said Service. All <HI>Chapters,</HI> and other Rites concerning the <HI>Order,</HI> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> being cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary to these, to remain as they have been used.</P>
<P>This Decree seemed to mean nothing less than a Prohi∣bition to the holding the Grand Feast at <HI>Windsor,</HI> at least the neglect of its Celebration there, whilst King <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. lived: And though toward the End of his Reign, some care was taken for a Permission to hold the said Feast, ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her on St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> or some other appointed by Prorogation; yet it was without any regard to the ancient and usual Place; for when the Act passed, commanding the Days therein mentioned to be kept Holy, and no other,
<PB N="414" REF="424"/>
whereby this was involved among many other Saints Days then prohibited to be kept, as not being found among the Feasts then Establish'd; it was considered, that a Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iso and Allowance should be entered in the aforesaid Act, for the Celebration of this Feast, particularly by the <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> which Act, though it suffered a Repeal by Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> yet stands in force at this Day, being re∣vived by King <HI>James</HI> I. his repealing that <HI>Statute</HI> of 1 <HI>Mar. Cap.</HI> 2.</P>

<HEAD>Removed from <HI>Windsor</HI> by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§ 7. But the most fatal Blow given to the growing Honour of the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> was a Decree in <HI>Chap∣ter</HI> held 9 <HI>Eliz.</HI> with the consent of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> then present, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That if on the Vigil and Day of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Feast was not held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> according to the usual Custom, it should nevertheless be sufficient, if the Observation thereof were kept at the same Place where the Sovereign should then happen to be, where also the rest of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> were obliged to be present, no less than if the Feast had been held at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>And so severe was the latter part of this Decree against the flourishing condition of that Place, that it commanded also,</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at no other Solemnity, under the notion of St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast, should thenceforth be celebrated at <HI>Windsor,</HI> except upon occasion of the <HI>Installation</HI> of some illustrious Person, and then also, not without express leave of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>And to say truth, this <HI>Statute</HI> was but too strict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y ob∣served during her Reign; for we meet but with one Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> held there, till 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. (unless we mi∣stake the Feasts of <HI>Installation</HI> for those of St. <HI>George,)</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut then the Sovereign, who was yet in <HI>Scotland,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Commission, dated 5 <HI>April,</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> his <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> to prorogue the Festival to the 3d <HI>July</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣lowing, and after constituted him to hold the Feast, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch was performed the 2, 3 and 4 Days of the said Month, with all Pomp and Ceremony. The King himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng then at <HI>Windsor,</HI> was prevented from being present by some occasion not mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="425"/>
Thus, after a long Interval, the Honour of the Feast was restored, which had this effect, toward the End of King <HI>James</HI> I. Reign, and that of his Son and Successor, King <HI>Charles</HI> I. that it begat a Re-union of the Feast and Place, whereby the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> famous for the <HI>Institution</HI> of this most Noble <HI>Order,</HI> retrieved its ancient Honour, of having its Solemnities celebrated there.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Prorogation of the Grand Feast.</HEAD>
<P>§ 8. Having thus noted, that from the beginning of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's Reign, till of late Years, the Grand Feast was seldom observed upon the precise Day of St. <HI>George;</HI> and that the occasion how both Day and Feast came to be celebrated apart, took its rise from the indulgence of the <HI>Statutes</HI> in point of Prorogation: 'Tis necessary farther to observe, that this Prorogation is of two sorts, either Absolute, as being enjoined by the <HI>Statutes;</HI> or else A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bitrary, at the Sovereign's Pleasure, upon inter∣vening Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>In the first of these the Founder's</HI> Statutes <HI>enjoin,</HI> That if the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> shall happen within fifteen Days next after <HI>Easter Day,</HI> it shall be prorogued to the Sunday F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtnight, or fifteen Days after <HI>Easter Day. And the reason is there given,</HI> That every of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> might have opportunity of coming thereto, without being constrained to ride upon any of those three Holy Days preceedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g <HI>Easter Day.

<P>And when the Grand Feast, in this ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Easter,</HI> has been kept before the expiration of the said fifteen Days, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> then absent, to avoid the Penalty for their not appearing, have made Excuse; that the an∣cient <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> were violated in keeping the Feast within fifteen Days after <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster,</HI> as was al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edged when Sir <HI>John Denham,</HI> Lord Treasurer, as President, held the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 24 <HI>April,</HI> 8 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> VII.</P>

<P>And as the <HI>Knights-Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions</HI> had Prohibitions put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the Solemnization of their Feast, in case of its inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ering with <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster,</HI> so had the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in their Ob∣servation of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> in reference to several other Festivals; and this continued till the time of the Refor∣mation begun by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. but since the Grand Feast has been celebrated upon any of them indifferently the Feast of <HI>Easter</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>The second sort of Prorogations, which are meerly Arbitrary, and wholly dependent on the Sovereign's Plea∣sure, yet warranted sufficiently from the Words, <HI>Causa postulante,</HI> mentioned in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Statutes; as likewise the great Latitude given the Sovereigns of this most Noble <HI>Order,</HI> in reference to their Affairs, in the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Statutes: The first Precedent of which was, <HI>Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 5 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. when about <HI>August,</HI> four Months after St. <HI>Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> that King being engaged in the Wars of <HI>France,</HI> ordered the Feast to be celebrated at <HI>Caen</HI> in <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣mandy,</HI> and with great Solemnity created fifteen K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>There are several other Examples, particularly one 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. when the King being at <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tham</HI> on St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> it was in a <HI>Chapter</HI> there held, Decreed, That the ac∣customed Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be observed at <HI>Winds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> 25th of <HI>May</HI> ensuing. And from this time it became An∣nually customary, to keep the Day of St. <HI>George</HI> where the Sovereign at that time made his Abode: On which Day, and the Day after, the usual Solemnities were observed.

<P>The most ordinary course, preparatory to the issuing such Commissions of Prorogation, has been by the Sove∣reign's Declaration in <HI>Chapter,</HI> or otherwise the signifi∣cation of his Pleasure to the Chancellor of the <HI>Order</HI> at any other time, who thereupon drew up the Commission, and presented it to the Sovereign for his Sign Manual, and then affixed thereto the Great Seal of the <HI>Order.</HI> But where the Chancellor was not at hand to receive the So∣vereign's Commands, in this case it was conveyed to him by some other Hand, with Command to Summon the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> and Officers accordingly.

<P>And as all the preceeding Adjournments of the Grand Feast have been either Decreed in <HI>Chapter,</HI> or directed immediately from the Sovereign; so there is a Precedent where the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> has been impowered to Prorogue the same, yet to the Time and Place appointed by the Sovereign, and inserted in the Commission of <HI>Lieutena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy:</HI> And this was in a Commission, 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. directed to <HI>Charles,</HI> Earl of <HI>Nottingham.</HI></P>

<P>But the greatest and frequentest Variations are in the Stiles and Titles of <HI>Honour,</HI> set under the Escutcheons, and these relate unto, and are occasioned principally from their attaining or resigning of Offices or Dignities.</P>
<P>We find that the Stile set under the Escutcheon of <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> the Empire, at St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Feast, Anno</HI> 1 and 2 <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> was as followeth.</P>

<P>In the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Stiles of <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who, while Queen <HI>Mary</HI> lived, was Co-Sovereign of this most Noble <HI>Order,</HI> run thus:</P>

<P>But at the Feasts of St. <HI>George, Anno</HI> 28, 29, and 30 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Title of Catholick Prince was also given him.</P>
<P>The Instances relating to <HI>Knight-Subjects</HI> are very many, there having been almost every Year some Additions, or Omissions.</P>
<P>In the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>'s Stile, <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the <HI>Lieu∣tenantship of the North</HI> was omitted. In the Earl of <HI>Rut∣land</HI>'s, at the same Feast, <HI>President of the Council in the Council in the North,</HI> was added. The Marquiss of <HI>Win∣chester</HI> caused the Title of Baron <HI>St. John</HI> to be omitted, because his eldest Son bore that Title, and was a Baron of Parliament.</P>
<P>It may be further observed, that a Stranger elect (hav∣ing received the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order,)</HI> hath been allowed the Honour of having an Escutcheon of his Arms set on the back of that Stall designed for him, notwith∣standing he has not been installed.</P>

<P>§ 1. THE Celebration of the Grand Feast, with the Ceremonies, devis'd to set forth and illustrate the Glory there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, hath been worthy the ob∣servation of the first Institutor, and all succeed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Sove∣reigns; well knowing that what is once sligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d will soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all into disesteem, if not into contempt.

<P>As to the first, although St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> (or such other Day as the Sovereign shall please to nominate and ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oint, by Prorogation in lieu thereof,) be the Principal and Grand Day of the Feast, yet the Eve of that Day d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es the Feast take Commencement, and determines not till the third Day following; the whole Solemnity taking up three Days inclusively.</P>
<P>And this is clear from several Articles of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> wherein the course of the Ceremonies to be obser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Grand Solemnity are set down; whether observed, on the Eve, the Feast-Day, or the Morrow after: And these three Days together did the Sovereign hold the Grand Feast, whether they personally celebrated the same, or deputed other of the <HI>Knights-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpanions</HI> to that Em∣ployment, the cause of the Commissions of Deputation limitting their Power either in general, <HI>during the time of the Feast;</HI> or in particular, upon the Day of St. <HI>Georg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the Day, and that following, <HI>viz.</HI> the last Day of the Feast. In like manner, when in succeeding Times, Com∣missions of Prorogation of the Grand Feast were made use of, we find the three Days continuance of the Feast to be particularly mentioned in the Body of those Commissions: Namely, the Day wherein, by such Appointment, the Feast was to begin, the Grand Day it self<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Day whereon it ended.</P>

<HI>English,</HI> St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Eve;</HI> all which signify one and the same thing, and are but various Names given to the Evening of the Day foregoing either that of St. <HI>George,</HI> or that whereon the Grand Feast is appointed to be held by Prorogation.</P>
<P>Thus we see that the Founder began his Solemnity upon the Eve of the Feast Day; which doubtless was in conformity to the Custom of the Church, who made the <HI>Vigils</HI> and <HI>Eves</HI> part of the ensuing Festivals, and as Ushers to the Grand Solemnities.</P>
<P>As the Eve was appointed by the Founder for the Commencement of the Anniversary of the Grand Feast, so to make the time more certain, the <HI>Statutes</HI> ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress the exact Hour of meeting for beginning the Solemnities, to be at the Hour of <HI>Tierce,</HI> which in many other Places is called, <HI>Hora Tertiarum.</HI> But this seemed not sufficient to express clear enough the meaning of a Law, where a Penalty was enjoined, and there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore at a <HI>Chapter</HI> held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 17 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. a scrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e arising among the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> concerning the Words <HI>Hora Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiarum,</HI> whe∣ther they were intended to mean three in the Afternoon, or at the Hour of the Church, generally used after Prime Noon before; and fixed it to the latter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Registrum Chartaceum</HI> Records the same Expla∣nation of the Words; and to let us see that 'twas imme∣diately put in Practice, it is there entered with the Names of those <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> present with the Sovereign, both in the Morning and Evening of the same Day.</P>
<P>Another Instance of which there is, 3 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. on the Eve of the Grand Feast, held by Prorogation at <HI>Windsor,</HI> where the Sovereign, in regard of the arrival of several Ambassadors, put off the usual <HI>Chapter</HI> till Noon; whence it is evident, that the Custom at this time was likewise to begin the Solem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in the Morning.</P>

and elsewhere, <HI>Hora Tertia Vespertina vel Pomeridiana;</HI> which Hour, as it was then settled to be the punctual time for the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> meeting, to enter on the Solemnity of the Feast, so has it ever since continued un∣altered, and usually observed.</P>
<P>The Place of Assembly for the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> hath usually been in such of the Sovereign's Privy Lodgings, both at <HI>Windsor,</HI> or elsewhere, as he hath appointed; frequently in the Privy, Withdrawing, or Bed Chambers: To this appointed Place the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> repair, to give their Attendance on the Sove∣reign, having first invested themselves in full Robes, either in their own Lodgings, or some convenient Room at Court, where <HI>Garter</HI> is to attend them, with notice of the approa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing Hour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> being come to the Sovereign, as likewise the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> habited in their <HI>Mantles,</HI> and bearing in their Hands the <HI>Symbols</HI> of their several Offices, they wait the Sovereign's being vested in his Robes, till he passes into the Presence Chamber, or give beginning to the Feast, by opening the <HI>Chapter</HI> at their meeting, before he goes thither.</P>

<P>But this heighth of Gallantry and Splendor in the Num∣ber of Attendants, and ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hness of their Apparel, within ten Years grew up to such Excess, or rather Exorbitancy, that it required a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt; wherefore the Sover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gn, by the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Advi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> Decreed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Commanded, <HI>That eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y one of the</HI> Knights-Compa∣nions <HI>of the</HI> Order, <HI>should have to attend upon his Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>

<HI>at the yearly Solemnization of the Feast of the</HI> Order, <HI>fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersons, and no more:</HI> The reason whereof we find else∣where noted to be, for saving of Charge, and avoiding of Emulation. But in the beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. Reign, of ever Blessed Memory, the gallantry of Attend∣ants began again to Increase and Augment; insomuch that at the Grand Feast held at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> the 22d, 23d, and 24th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Car.</HI> I. we find it observed, that the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> came forth attended, each with a Train of Servants very richly clad.</P>
<P>But to return and enter upon the Proceeding, to the end the Servants and Attendants of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> may be exactly Marshalled, the Usher of the Hall (whose Duty it is to rank them) ought to call for a List from <HI>Gar∣ter,</HI> of such <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> as are to be present at the Grand Feast, noted with their several Places in the Proceeding, for his better Directions in assigning the At∣tendants their due Places, the Order whereof is thus: First, the <HI>Junior</HI> Knights-Attendants proceed one before ano∣ther, on the left Hand, upon whose right Hand the se∣cond eldest Knights-Attendants go in equal Rank with them, for this we observe to have been the gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al rule; where the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Proceed in pairs, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r At∣tendants go together; those belonging to the <HI>Senior</HI> Knights of the two, on the right Hand, and to the <HI>Junior</HI> u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on their left; but the Order is otherwise, where any of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceed single and alone, (which of∣ten falls out, as shall be noted in its due Place,) for then the Attendants belonging to that single Knight go two and two, on both sides the Way, opposite one against the other.</P>
<P>But when the Grand Feast is Celebrated at <HI>White¦Hall,</HI> there the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Attendants are Mar∣shalled by the said Usher, on both sides the Passage, from the outward Door of the Guard Chamber, down into the Hall, taking up all the Room as far as the old Chappel; and because here they do not proceed, in regard of the shortness of the Processional way, but only make a stand, for the Proceeding to pass through them, they are ranked in a way d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fferent from that used at <HI>Windsor;</HI> neverthe∣less relating more especially to the Order ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erved by their Masters: Which Method, in the Sovereign's Pro∣ceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to the Chappel, at the befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ementioned Feast,

held at <HI>White-Hall, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Car</HI> I. we find thus described The eldest <HI>Knight-Companions</HI> Servants were ranked on the right Hand of the Passage, the chiefest of them near unto the old Chappel Door; and the second Knight (be∣ing Companion to the eldest) his Attendants stood on the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> side, the chiefest of them also next the said old Chappel Door, and in case the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dest Knight's Fellow or Compa∣nion be not present in this Proceeding, then the eldest Knight's Servants ought to be placed opposite one against the other, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on each side the said old Chappel Door: The like Order is to be tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in Marshalling the Servants of the other Knights of this most Noble <HI>Order,</HI> whose Companions are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen absent.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Order of Proceeding amongst the <HI>Alms-Knights,</HI> (who, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Car.</HI> I. had two Waiters of the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereign's Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, in their Livery Coats, bearing white Rods in their Hands, to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceed before them,) is in general two and two together, the <HI>Junior</HI> is placed foremost on the left Hand, and his next <HI>Senior</HI> on his right; and if Sick∣ness, or other la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful Impediment, chance to hinder one or more of them, fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m going in the Proceeding, his <HI>Ju∣nior</HI> is advanc'd into his Place, and consequently all the other <HI>Juniors</HI> do in like manner alter their Places, and adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, to the end the superior Place be still supplied, accor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to the right rule of Marshalling the Singles, that compose a gross Body; but in this Case, if the Number that attend happen to be odd, the Governor of the <HI>Alms-Knights</HI> goes last of all, and alone.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Virger of the College hath his Place next after the <HI>Alms-Knights,</HI> and immediately before the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebends</HI> of the College; who being habited in a Gown, beareth a Silver Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, the Ensign of his Office: Ne∣vertheless, hereto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, when the <HI>Prebends</HI> went not in the Proceeding, on the Eve of the Grand Feast, the Virger proceeded first of all, before the <HI>Alms-Knights,</HI> for so it was observed on the Eve of St. <HI>George,</HI> at <HI>Windsor, Anno</HI> 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and in this manner we see it exprest, in the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ceeding set forth by <HI>Marcus Gercha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Under the general rule, relating to the <HI>Alms-Knights,</HI> are comprehe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded the <HI>Prebends</HI> of the College, the <HI>Pu suivants, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Provincial Kings,</HI> insomuch, that where either of the said K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs are absent, the <HI>Senior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erald</HI> is adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced, and goes in breast on the left Hand of
<PB N="440" REF="450"/>
him who is then present; so also where any of the <HI>He∣ralds</HI> are wanting, his next <HI>Junior</HI> ascendeth into his Place; whereby it sometimes falls out, that the <HI>Senior Pursuivant</HI> is joined to the left Hand of the <HI>Junior Herald:</HI> And through their defects and absence, the Number of the Officers of Arms be odd, then (with this difference in the foresaid rule observed among the <HI>Alms-Knights,)</HI> the youngest <HI>Pursuivant</HI> goeth single by himself.</P>
<P>Touching the right of Precedency, between the Offi∣cers of Arms, and <HI>Prebends</HI> of the College, in Proceeding before the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> we find there hath been heretofore not only some Question start∣ed, but the Place contended for; insomuch, that at the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tallation of the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Cumberland, Anno</HI> 34 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the <HI>Prebends</HI> took Place, and upon the 24th of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 39 <HI>Eliz.</HI> at the Installation of <HI>Thomas,</HI> Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Walden,</HI> and others, the <HI>Prebends</HI> again en∣deavoured to pass between the Officers of Arms, and Of∣ficers of the <HI>Order;</HI> but <HI>Charles,</HI> Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Effin∣gham,</HI> then Lieutenant to the Sovereign, delivered his Opinion on the behalf of the Officers of Arms against the <HI>Prebends.</HI></P>
<P>Yet did not this so settle the <HI>Order</HI> of Precedency, or quiet the <HI>Prebends,</HI> but that the Contention again broke out, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. at the Installation of the Earls of <HI>Pem∣brook<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, Southampton,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Lenox;</HI> (which happened on the ninth, not second of <HI>July,</HI> in the foresaid Year,) even to such a heighth, that the <HI>Prebends, Pur∣suivants,</HI> and <HI>Heralds,</HI> contended in the Proceeding; but the Controversy was on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he next Morning composed, by the Lord Admiral, (then the Sovereign's Lieutenant,) the Lord Treasurer, and the Earl of <HI>Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester;</HI> and the <HI>Order</HI> in Proceeding thus set<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led: first, That the <HI>Alms-Knights</HI> should go foremost, the <HI>Pursuivants</HI> next, then the <HI>Pre∣bends,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d then the <HI>Heralds</HI> and Kings of Arms; and this Order in Proceeding was afterwards observed, on the 21 <HI>May, Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. at the Installation of the Earl of <HI>Salisbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> and Viscount <HI>Bindon;</HI> as also the 19 <HI>May, Anno</HI> 6. of the same King, at the Installation of the Earls of <HI>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bar,</HI> and <HI>Montgomery.</HI></P>

<P>And though at the Grand Feast held by Prorogation, on Sunday the 14th of <HI>September,</HI> in the said fifteenth Year of King <HI>James,</HI> it is noted, that the Prince (being then the Sovereign's Lieutenant,) proceeded to Morning Ser∣vice on the Feast Day, with the <HI>Alms-Knights, Heralds, Prebends,</HI> and Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> before him; from which manner of Expression, it may perchance be sup∣posed, that the <HI>Heralds</HI> went at that time next after the <HI>Alms-Knights,</HI> and before the <HI>Prebends;</HI> nevertheless, else∣where we find them, on the Eve of the aforesaid Feast, ranked in this following Order.</P>

<P>At the Sovereign's approach, one of the Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Ushers attended with the Sword of State, (the Point rest∣ing upon the Ground,) delivereth to such one of the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bility, (not being a Knight of the <HI>Order,)</HI> whom the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vereign, as an honorary Favour, hath before nominated, to bear it from thence, before him in all the Proceedings of the Feast; during which Action, the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> proceed forwards, and being entred the Presence Chamber, Flank on each side the State, with some small distance between them, and there make a stand: The S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vereign being also entred, passeth to the Step before the State, (the Nobleman who beareth the Sword, and the five Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> retiring a little on his right Hand,) and then turning himself towards the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> standeth there a while, until they have made their Reve∣rences unto him; which being performed, he resaluteth the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> by putting off his Cap: This done, the Sovereign pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teth his Cap on again; whereupon every of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> putteth on theirs, and imme∣diately Rank themselves, according to their due Place, on both sides the State.</P>

<P>Thus four <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceeded alone, in re∣gard the Stalls opposite to them were void, the three first being absent, and the last void by the Death of the Earl of <HI>Huntington;</HI> and to avoid all disputes in relation to Precedency, King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. Decreed, in the sixteenth Year of his Reign; <HI>That each</HI> Knight-Companion <HI>should take Place, in Procession, Station, or sitting at the Table, thence forward, as he had his Seat or Stall in the Choir, and not according to the Degree of his Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th or Condition, unless the Sovereign was pleased that any should be made Choice of, according to the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bility of his Family, to sit at the end of his own Table, or perform any other thing by the by.</HI></P>
<P>The Proceeding among the Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> dif∣fereth from all before spoken of; for, being five in Num∣ber, the three inferior Officers (when all present,) March in a breast, and (of later Times,) the <HI>Register</HI> in the middle,
<PB N="444" REF="454"/>
<HI>Garter</HI> on his right Hand, and the <HI>Usher</HI> of the <HI>Black-Red</HI> on his left.</P>
<P>After these three Officers, the two superior proceed together, the <HI>Prelate</HI> on the Right, and the <HI>Chancellor</HI> on the left; and after, the Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> follow the Sword, which is carried immediately before the Sovereign. In the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, it was born by some of the Barons, but of later Times it hath been conferr'd on Persons of higher Rank, as <HI>Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I. on the Earl of <HI>Dover; Anno</HI> 9 <HI>Car.</HI> I. on the Earl of <HI>Danby;</HI> and <HI>Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. on the Lord Viscount <HI>Mordant,</HI> then Constable of the Castle of <HI>Windsor;</HI> and at this Time 'tis usually born by none under the Degree of an Earl.</P>
<P>The Sovereign's Place in the Proceeding, &amp; <HI>notandum quod superior Ordinis tempore Processionis in dicta Capella transibit retro totam Sociarum Comitivam;</HI> which though the <HI>Statute</HI> mentions here to be performed at the Grand Procession, yet it refers to all those times the Sovereign proceeds to, or from, no less than within the Chappel. In ancient Time, the Sovereign (if he were at <HI>Windsor,</HI> to celebrate the Grand Feast,) proceeded to the Chappel in Person, as well on the Eve, as on the Feast Day. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> being the first who went not to the Chappel on the Eve of the Feast, unless we except King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who, by reason of Sickness, was necessitated to make a Deputy in his stead: The aforesaid Omission of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was first occasioned through Indisposition of Health, though she afterwards, without that necessity, did not comply, as in the 18, 25, 29, and 31 Years of her Reign, which gave occasion to King <HI>James</HI> to make De∣puties at those three Grand Feasts he Celebrated at <HI>Wind∣sor;</HI> and the like did King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in the first Year o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Reign; but in the fourth Year of his Reign, the an∣cient Custom (for many Years intermitted,) was restored, and the Sovereign (making no Lieutenant,) proceeded to the Chappel, not only on that Eve, but always observed it afterwards, as did King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in all the Grand Feasts he held, and is now observed.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Proceeding to the <HI>Chapter-House.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Having under the precedent Head, treated at large of the Rank and Place of all those that pass in the Proceeding, wherein all are Bare-headed, except the So∣vereign and <HI>Knights-Companions:</HI> I now come to the Place whither the Proceeding is directed.</P>
<P>The first Solemn Action on the Entrance of the Grand Feast, which the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are obliged to perform, is to Celebrate a <HI>Chapter,</HI> to which end it hath been most usual for them to proceed from the Presence Chamber, <HI>every one in their due Place and Order;</HI> first to the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> to consult of things of course; and next into the <HI>Choir,</HI> to hear Divine Service; which has been the constant Custom from the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> V. as many Examples, recorded in the Registers of the <HI>Order,</HI> evidence.</P>
<P>As this Custom of holding a <HI>Chapter</HI> on the Eve of the Grand Feast, was constantly observed when celebrated without Prorogation; so also hath a <HI>Chapter</HI> been in like manner held before <HI>Vespers,</HI> on the Eve, at such time as the Feast Day of St. <HI>George</HI> only hath been observ'd, when (for any cause) the Anniversary of the Grand Feast receiv'd Prorogation: As for Instance, <HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Mary,</HI> a <HI>Chapter</HI> was held at the Mannor of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, on the <HI>Vigil</HI> of St. <HI>George,</HI> before the first <HI>Vespers;</HI> whereunto is fixt this Note, <HI>ut moris est;</HI> and the Grand Feast f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r that Year receiv'd Adjournment, until the coming of <HI>Philip,</HI> then Prince (after King) of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, though the Celebration of the Grand Feasts were removed from <HI>Windsor,</HI> and observed at other Places, yet this usual Custom of holding a <HI>Chapter</HI> on the Eve, was always practised; after which the proceeding to Evening Prayer succeeded, as is manifest by several Testimonies from the <HI>Registers.</HI></P>
<P>The publick processional way to the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> at <HI>Windsor,</HI> used Time out of Mind, led from the Presence Chamber through the Cloister, and the great Gate of the King's Lodging, to the upper Ward of the Castle, thence through the middle Ward, and part of the lower, to and through the Passage, between the East End of the Chappel
<PB N="447" REF="457"/>
and <HI>Tomb-House;</HI> and thence into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> Si∣tuate on the North East Corner of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Chappel.</HI></P>
<P>But the Sovereign hath sometimes thought fit to wave this publick processional way, and pass along the private way, which leads from the King's Privy Chamber, down the Stairs into the Terrace, <HI>viz.</HI> through that stately Walk lying on the North side of the Castle, and entring again at a Door, heretofore made through a part of the Castle Wall into one of the Canons Lodgings, adjoining to <HI>Win∣chester Tower,</HI> (now made up) went thence through the Cloisters, proceeding in the Order before shewed.</P>
<P>We shall close this Head, with observing, that though the Proceedings to the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> or Chappel, on the Eve of the Feast, have most commonly been on Foot; yet have they been also on Horse-back, on extraordinary Occasions, as <HI>Anno</HI> 3 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. at which Time several Ambassadors being arrived here from Foreign Kings and Princes, they and many of the Nobility of this King∣dom, with the King's Council, the two Archbishops, the Bishops of <HI>Lincoln</HI> and <HI>Ely,</HI> and the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, repaired also thither; and on the Eve, the Sovereign, accompanied with the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> rode from the upper Quadrangle down to the College. The Queen and the King's Mother rode in a Chair, covered with rich Cloth of Gold, drawn by six Coursers finely Harnass'd, and twenty one Ladies, habited in Crimson Velvet, rode on white Palfries: Sir <HI>Roger Cotton,</HI> Master of the Queen's Horse, led her Horse of State, whereon was a Saddle of Cloth of Gold, and three Crowns of Silver gilt; as soon as they alighted, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceeded to the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and thence to Evening Song, which ended, they return'd in the Order they came.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the eleventh Year of his Reign, at three a Clock in the Afternoon, with all the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> in the Habit of the <HI>Order,</HI> proceeded from the Presence Chamber in <HI>Windsor-Castle,</HI> till they came to the Quadrangle, where they took their Horses, and rode according to their Stalls, not according to their Estate, next before the King, and thence rode to the middle Door of the Chappel, and there alighted, and pro∣ceeded without the <HI>Choir</HI> to the <HI>Chapter-House;</HI> there are other Examples, but these may suffice.</P>

<P>§ 4. The Proceeding being arriv'd at the Entrance into the Chappel, first the Attendants on the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> divide themselves as they enter, beginning at the outward Door, and Flank on each side the North Isle of the Chappel, and so toward the West Door of the <HI>Choir,</HI> making a stand along the Isle for the <HI>Alms-Knights, Virgers, Prebends,</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>Arms,</HI> to pass through them, who go on towards the said West Door; and when the <HI>Junior Knights-Companions</HI> are entred into the Chappel, the Proceeding makes a stand, while all the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> following turn aside on the right Hand into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> next the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and lastly the Sovereign; but the Nobleman that carries the Sword, the Train-bearers, Pensioners, &amp;c. stay without the <HI>Chap∣ter-House</HI> Door in the North Isle; none being admitted in but the Sovereign, the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and the Of∣ficers of the <HI>Order;</HI> who being all entred, the Door is shut by the Gentleman Usher of the <HI>Black-Rod,</HI> and every Person severally takes his due Place and Station, where∣upon the <HI>Chapter</HI> immediately opens.</P>
<P>In what Manner and Order the Sovereign, <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> are ranked, at the holding of a <HI>Chapter,</HI> is describ'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. when the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> consulted in the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> on the Reformation and Explanation of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>The Sovereign, on his Entrance, proceeded to the midst of the North-end of the Table; the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> whose Stalls in the <HI>Choir</HI> were on the Sovereign's side, took the right Hand of the Table, and those of the Princes side the left; then the Prelate of the <HI>Order</HI> came and stood on the Sovereign's right Hand, at the corner of the Table<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; <HI>Register</HI> and <HI>Garter</HI> were at the lower end, and <HI>Black-Rod</HI> kept the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door on the inside. The Chan∣cellor of the <HI>Order</HI> is not there mention'd, (as not being present) yet his Place is on the Sovereign's left Hand of the Table.</P>
<P>If the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> arrive at the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> so late, that the Business necessary to be done
<PB N="449" REF="459"/>
cannot be discuss'd, without putting off the Celeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation of <HI>Vespers,</HI> beyond the Canonical Hour; it hath been usual to adjourn the Debates till the next Morning, as was done <HI>Anno</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I.</P>

<HEAD>Transactions in the <HI>Chapter</HI> held before the <HI>Vespers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§ 5. When the <HI>Chapter</HI> held before the <HI>Vespers</HI> is open∣ed, and no Adjournment given thereto, all things are then to be provided for, which concern the Honour and Dignity of this most Noble <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>The matters of course are; first, Swearing, and adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ting Officers; secondly, Debating about the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> then absent, and either dispensing with, or in∣flicting Penalties on them; and thirdly, Constituting or appointing an Officer, to carry on the State and Solem∣nity of the Feast in the Sovereign's absence. But other Particulars that are occasional, cannot so well be brought within Rule, as being wholly accidental.</P>
<P>As to the first, the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> soon after the <HI>Chapter</HI> is open'd, take their respective Oaths, in Order to perform the Duty of their several Places, during the Session of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> and thenceforward, as is evident from several Examples, but one may suffice, from a <HI>Chapter</HI> held at <HI>Windsor, Anno</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I. whereat Dr. <HI>Neal,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> was Swo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Prelate; Sir <HI>Francis Crane,</HI> Chancellor; and Dr. <HI>Mathew Wren,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> Re∣gister.</P>
<P>It hath sometimes happened, that some of the Officers of this <HI>Order</HI> have been Sworn at other Times, as at <HI>Chapters</HI> next ensuing their Nomination and Choice, where∣in the Administration of the Oath is one of the first things done.</P>
<P>Touching the second particular debated in <HI>Chapter, viz.</HI> the dispensing with, or punishing absent Knights; it is to be considered, that the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> enjoin all the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to be present at the Celebration of the Grand Feast: that is, those that are within the Kingdom, or elsewhere; although the Service of St. <HI>George,</HI> according to the Rites of the Church, be not celebrated, as on the Service of the Day whereon that of St. <HI>George</HI> has fallen, <HI>viz. Good-Friday:</HI> But with this Limitation,
<PB N="450" REF="460"/>
so that they be in a capacity, or may conveniently repair thither.</P>
<P>Therefore the next thing usually entred upon in the <HI>Chapter,</HI> is the Sovereign's and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> ta∣king notice, whether any of the Fellowship make default of coming at the Hour assign'd; and if so, they are considered under one of these Heads. First, Stranger Princes; Secondly, Late Commissioners who are arrived, or every Minute expected; and Thirdly, Such as have given notice that they cannot be present, during the con∣tinuation of the Feast: Of these Excuses of course, ver∣bal Apologies, or Letters of Excuse, are, or may be, of∣fered; and in case they are approved or admitted, then the Penance, which by the <HI>Statutes</HI> ought otherwise to be inflicted, is admitted; all which ought to be recor∣ded.</P>
<P>Stranger Princes are excused in course, on Account of their necessary Residence in their own Territories; and of their Excuses and accustom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Dispensations, are divers Instances in the Registers of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who are tardy in their Jour∣ney, or being come to the Castle, fall short of the Hour, or of attending the Sovereign to the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> ei∣ther through negligence, or want of timely notice, or other accident; the <HI>Statutes</HI> enjoin for Penance, that they be not permitted for that time to enter into the <HI>Chapter,</HI> but tarry without the Door, and not have Voice in any thing that shall happen to be done there, unless they can alledge a just Excuse, or render such a sufficient cause as the So∣vereign, or his Deputy, shall approve of; but few defa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣ters have been noted of this kind.</P>
<P>The third sort of Delinquents, are those <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> absent, not only at the Hour of <HI>Tierce,</HI> but are likely to be so during the whole Feast; the Proceedings relating to them, are either upon what is offered in Excuse of their absence, or determined on their neglect of making Apology for it.</P>
<P>Excuses for absence, are either by Letters or Word of Mouth; if by Letters, they are directed to the Chancel∣lor of the <HI>Order;</HI> or else the Sovereign sends to his Lieu∣tenant on their behalf, and both are produc'd by the Chan∣cellor: But if Excuses be made by Word of Mouth, then are they delivered by the Sovereign himself; or on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion

made by some of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> present in <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>The Custom of sending Letters has been very ancient: The Lord <HI>Powis</HI>'s Letter, under his Hand and Seal, (cer∣tifying his Indisposition of Body,) was produc'd in <HI>Chap∣ter, Anno</HI> 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. And the following Year the Dukes of <HI>York, Norfolk,</HI> and <HI>Buckingham,</HI> with the Earls of <HI>Salis∣bury, Shrewsbury,</HI> and <HI>Pembrook,</HI> Viscount <HI>Bourchier,</HI> the Lord <HI>Rivers,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Falstaff;</HI> being all absent from St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Feast, they declared the reason of their absence by their Messengers.</HI> There are many Precedents of this kind, and of Letters sent from the Sovereign, directed to his Lieutenant, to accept of <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Excuses, whose absence he had beforehand dispenc'd with; we ob∣serve those Dispensations excus'd not the sending their own particular Excuses; for it is evident they were also expected, and that such allowance of absence was not Absolute, the Clause running thus: <HI>That you [the Sove∣reign's Deputy] allow these Excuses so far as are consonant to reason.</HI> And in all other Letters of the same nature, a Clause to this Effect hath been inserted: <HI>That as the So∣vereign thought good to advertise his Deputy, that for certain Causes he had dispenc'd with their Attendance for that time; so he will'd him to accept their reasonable Excuses in that behalf accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The absent <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> have had their Excuses frequently made by Word of Mouth, ei∣ther of the Sovereign, or some other of the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions,</HI> present in the <HI>Chapter.</HI> This Favour is done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ther by the Sovereign himself, if present; or by his Order to the Lieutenant, in his absence.</P>
<P>There have been many Examples of what hath been done in this Case, and also when the Sovereign hath not been present in <HI>Chapter,</HI> but hath beforehand verbally given his Deputy or Lieutenant direction to excuse th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absence of several <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>It will be necessary to observe what Effect the Ex∣cuses have usually produc'd; whereinto we find the just and rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onable favourably admitted, some suspended<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and divers disallowed. Those easily allow'd were, first<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sickness; (for those of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> who have been either Sick, far spent with Age, or intent on publick Affairs, have been readily allow'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) Secondly, The no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="452" REF="462"/>
recovery of Wounds receiv'd in the publick Service<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as we meet with in the Case of Sir <HI>William Harington, Anno</HI> 7 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. whom we see excus'd <HI>for his Illness, oc∣casion'd from his Wounds then lately receiv'd at the Siege of</HI> Rohan, <HI>and elsewhere.</HI> Thirdly, Impotency and old Age. Fourthly, Imployment in the Sovereign's Service, either Abroad or at Home; those Abroad are necessarily excus'd, those at Home we shall be more particular to. The Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury, Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Eliz.</HI> was taken up in certain Af∣fairs, enjoin'd him by the Sovereign; the Earl of <HI>Hun∣tington,</HI> 26 <HI>Eliz.</HI> being President of the Council of the North, his absence was for that, and several Years fol∣lowing favourably excus'd; and a like Case was that of the Earl of <HI>Danby, Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. who for his necessary Attendance at the Seat of Justice in <HI>Eyre,</HI> was excus'd waiting on the Sovereign at the Grand Feast that Year. Fifthly, <HI>When the Grand Feast hath receiv'd Prorogation, and any of the</HI> Knights-Companions <HI>have not had notice of the Day whereunto it was prorogued.</HI> Sixthly, <HI>When any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them have been in Captivity;</HI> as was <HI>Thomas,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> both P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isoners in <HI>France, Anno</HI> 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. Seventhly, When any of them have obtain'd the Sovereign's Letters of Dispensation, of which sufficient is spoken before. Lastly, <HI>Some other just and lawful Occasion,</HI> as well as Accident, having fallen out; (not relating to those under the former Heads,) the Sove∣reign, on Information given in <HI>Chapter,</HI> hath been pleas'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o allow of; as in the Case of the Lord <HI>Fauconbridge, Anno</HI> 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. was readily admitted, on his pleading <HI>the care of his Domestick Affairs, he having been lately in Prison, and had obtained leave to go and see his House and Lands in the Country.</HI> The Earl of <HI>A undel</HI>'s absence, <HI>Anno</HI> 15 <HI>Car.</HI> I. was pardon'd, by reason of the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Death, who died on the Eve of the Grand Feast; that so he (being the chief of her Family,) might be at Hand to advise and assist in all things conducing to the Honour of the deceased Dutchess.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> have been often ex∣cus'd for not appearing on the Grand Feast, so hath the Sovereign, on sufficient Grounds, been pleas'd to license and dispence with their departure; from the same of this is an Example, 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI> when the Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> of <HI>Lough∣borough,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alling Ill a little before the Offering on St.
<PB N="453" REF="463"/>
<HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> obtain'd Licence from the Sovereign to de∣par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of the <HI>Choir;</HI> and came no more abroad that Day, nor during the Feast. As also another in the Duke of <HI>Lenox, Anno</HI> 15 <HI>Car.</HI> I. <HI>The Deputy Chancellor having, by Command of the Sovereign, and in discharge of the Duty of his Office;</HI> who being forc'd to go back to <HI>London,</HI> by reason of the aforesaid Dutchess of <HI>Richmon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Death, had his Excuse, and the Sovereign's Licence for departure.</P>
<P>We are next to consider Excuses, which, though sent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due time, yet on Debate in <HI>Chapter</HI> were suspended ra∣ther than allow'd; to which Head may be referr'd that Case of several of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who were Members of the Lord's House in the long Parliament. For <HI>Anno</HI> 18 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Deputy Chancellor having, by the Command of the Sovereign, and in discharge of the Duty of his Office, sent to each of them a Summons, for their Attendance at the Celebration of the Grand Feast, to be held for the preceeding Year at <HI>York;</HI> and notice thereof being given to the House of Lords, they immediately made the ensuing Order.</P>

<P>Whereupon the said <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> before the Days appointed by Prorog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion for holding the Feast, sent their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionary Letters of Excuse to the Deputy Chancellor, wherein they profess'd their desire and readiness to at∣tend, in Obedience of the said Summons; never<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heless pleaded the fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid <HI>Order</HI> for the Ground of their stay in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondon,</HI> and therefore desired him to obtain for them the Sovereign's Dispensation: On producing the said Letters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Chapter,</HI> the Sovereign would not at that time either admit
<PB N="454" REF="464"/>
or disallow of their Excuses, but referr'd the consi∣deration to the next <HI>Chapter,</HI> to be held by Prorogation.</P>
<P>Of Excuses which have not been allow'd, the most re∣markable is that of the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Scales, Anno</HI> 36 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. who were adjudg'd to the Pe∣nalty of the Statute, in regard the Causes alledged to ex∣cuse their absence were not approved; the latter was signed by the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> in a Jewel to the value of twenty Marks, to be offered in the College; whereby the rigour of the <HI>Statutes</HI> appears to have been more strictly executed on him, than the Duke, probably because the Lord <HI>Scales</HI> was absent the Year before, and no cause thereof shewed to the <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>In relation to the Proceedings on the absent <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> neglect of sending their Excuses, we shall ob∣serve, that some of them have with difficulty been remit∣ted, some left in suspence, and others sentenc'd, and re∣ferr'd either to the Sovereign's pleasure, or the Punish∣ment assign'd by Law; of the first kind we find that the Earl of <HI>Westmorland, Anno</HI> 10 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. though not very well, yet had much ado to be excus'd, because he sig∣nified not the Cause of his absence, as the <HI>Statutes</HI> requi∣red. So <HI>Anno</HI> 12 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Earls of <HI>Derby</HI> and <HI>Kelly,</HI> having made no Excuse, were for that Omission blameable, but by the Grace of the Sovereign for that time pardon'd.</P>
<P>As to those who, through the indulgence of the Sove∣reign, (where probable cause hath induc'd it,) have not had Sentence pass'd on them presently, but were deferr'd in expectation of some satisfactory Cause to be shewed; we find in the Case of the Prince, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and five other <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> absent from the Feast, held <HI>Anno</HI> 18 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. wherein it is registred, that <HI>no cause of Excuse was shewed, but there was an expectation of one to be alledged.</HI></P>
<P>But as for those of the third sort, on whom Sentence hath pass'd; they have been left either to the pleasure of the Sovereign, or to those Penalties which the Law of this <HI>Order</HI> inflict; of which, as also of those on whom Judgment hath pass'd, are divers Instances.</P>
<P>Besides these Grounds of assigning Penances, there are other Causes set down in the before recited ninth Article, of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stitution for Penances; as when the <HI>Knig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Companions</HI> are absent at other times, beside the
<PB N="455" REF="465"/>
Hour of <HI>Tierce,</HI> that is, the beginning of the first <HI>Vespers.</HI> Secondly, At the beginning of the Morning Service on the Feast Day. Thirdly, At the beginning of the second <HI>Ves∣pers.</HI> Fourthly, During the whole Feast. And, Fifthly, at the Grand Feast next following.</P>
<P>For the first, admitting any <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> hath fail∣ed of meeting and attending on the Sovereign at the Hour of <HI>Tierce,</HI> and thereupon suffered the Punishment of Non∣admittance into the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> and deprivation of Vote; nevertheless if at the rising of the said <HI>Chapter,</HI> he be not ready to proceed with the Sovereign, and other the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> into the <HI>Choir,</HI> to the be∣ginning of the first <HI>Vespers;</HI> he ought not only to suffer the former, but this additional Penalty, that he shall not presume to Enter into his Stall at that time, but tarry in that part of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where the Taper-bearers are wont to stand; nevertheless before his own Stall, until the holy Offices be ended; and the Law of the <HI>Order</HI> is the same in King <HI>Henry</HI> V's, and King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's <HI>Statutes,</HI> only render the Place for the Delinquent Knight to stand in, to be before the Stalls in the Choiristers Places; and now how the Penalty hath been inflicted, upon breach of the Law in this particular, we shall see by the following Instances.</P>
<P>At the Grand Feast celebrated at <HI>Windsor, An.</HI> 21 <HI>H.</HI> VII. when it seems the Lord <HI>Kildare,</HI> Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Goulford,</HI> came late to the Chappel, we find this Memorandum fixt to their Names; they stood with∣out, (before their Stalls) by the Sovereign's Permission, or rather Command: But yet this is not all the Punishment which hath been inflicted upon the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> for this Offence; (though it be all that is set down in the foresaid Article<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) for <HI>Anno</HI> 25 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. upon the Eve of St. <HI>George,</HI> the Marquiss of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rset</HI> not coming to the first <HI>Vespers,</HI> and being convicted of his late coming, was pro∣hibited joining in the Nomination then made, for the Election of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> into the room of the Duke of <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>Offenders in the second and third Case, being such as neglect to come before the beginning of the high Mass, or the second <HI>Vespers,</HI> called also the <HI>Vespers</HI> on St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> have the like Punishment with the former assigned them, throughout all the Bodies of the <HI>Statutes; viz.</HI>
<PB N="456" REF="466"/>
Exclusion from their Stalls, and Station in the Choiristers Range.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. We observe the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> no∣ted to be absent upon the Eve of the Grand Feast, but present on the Day; and conseque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly he incurred no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther Penance than what his absence on the Eve drew on him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Earl of <HI>Derby, Anno</HI> 18 <HI>Eliz.</HI> coming too late to the first Morning Service on the Feast Day, did for some short time undergo the same Penance, but soon af∣ter, upon Dispensation from the Lieutenant, went up to his Stall.</P>
<P>There are several other Instances; and besides the aforesaid Defaults, he is likewise to undergo the same Penalties, when the Grand Feast is prorogued, or celebrated at any other Place than <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut if he offend in all, and have no reasonable or al∣lowable Excuse for his absence, he is then prohibited en∣sering his Stall at the next Feast, and to pay ten Pounds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be employed towards the Ornaments of the College; and sometimes the former Penance has been inflicted for late coming to Divine Service.</P>
<P>The fourth degree of Offence is yet greater than any, and the variety of Penances are heightened. If a <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> shall neglect coming to the Grand Feast, and have no allowable reason; he shall not at the Feast held the ensuing Year be permitted to enter his own Stall, but stand below it; he shall walk alone by himself be∣fore three Crosses, which, in ancient time, were born in the Grand Procession: When the Grand Procession re∣turns to the <HI>Choir,</HI> he shall stand in the Place aforesaid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the time of the Offertory; he shall Offer last by him∣sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and then humbly approach the Stall of the Sove∣reign, or his Deputy, and there desire Absolution. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is no Instance that these Rigours were put in Ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ution, though many have offended in this kind.</P>
<P>Lastly, The <HI>Statutes</HI> enjoin; That where a <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> remains within the Kingdom, and shall be Guilty of an Omission two Years together, he ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so long interdicted his Stall, till he have offered a Jewel at St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Altar,</HI> to the Value of twenty Marks; and thenceforward every Year in which he shall be guilty of the same Omission, the Penalty to be doubled, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is pardoned: The most memorable Case in the Prosecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
<PB N="457" REF="467"/>
of a Contempt, was against the Earl of <HI>Arunde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 14 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. who for being absent two Years together, was Mul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t forty Marks; and continuing his Contempt the next Year, was fined the Sum of eighty Marks.</P>
<P>Touching the Necessity, and Power, of the Sovereign's constituting a Deputy; it was provided for at the Insti∣tution of the <HI>Order;</HI> the Sovereign being then engaged in the Wars of <HI>France,</HI> thought it reasonable that Provision should be made by the <HI>Statutes,</HI> for to depute some Per∣son in his stead.</P>
<P>When therefore such Occasion happened, a Commission was made out to one of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> some reasonable time before the approach of the Feast; so that none of the ancient Ceremonies might be omitted, or any Impediment happen through his absence; and such De∣puty hath usually been one of the chief of the <HI>Order,</HI> in Authority, Eminence, or Birth. The first so made was, <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> 7 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. and the reason there∣of given, in the <HI>Registrum Chartaceum,</HI> is, because the Sovereign was then employed in the Wars in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>And though the Title given by the <HI>Statutes</HI> to this Officer, be not particularly mentioned in the <HI>Blue-Book,</HI> where it speaks of the said Duke's holding the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> that Year, but rather implied in the Words <HI>Regiae Sublimatis locum imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evit;</HI> yet in the <HI>Registrum Chartaceum</HI> it is expresly set down, and the said Duke there styled, <HI>Depute de l'Ordre de Jaritiere.</HI> Sometimes he has been styled, <HI>Deputatis O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinis, &amp; praeses clarissima Ordinis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Title of <HI>Locum Tenens,</HI> or Lieutenant, began to be taken up, and has, for the most part, continued in all suc∣ceeding Times; and the other Titles of Deputy, Presi∣dent, and Vicegerent, laid aside. As to the Business of this Officer, sufficient has been said already. As an Es∣sential Honour to his Place, he has from ancient Time had some of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> assigned for his As∣sistants; the first mention of which is in the <HI>Registrum Chartaceum,</HI> 8 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. The Number of these Assi∣stants were in those times uncertain; at the time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oresaid they were 4. 21 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. 3. and 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. we find but two; which Number has been a constant Rule ever since<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> except once, <HI>viz.</HI> the last of <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. They were always appointed in <HI>Chapter,</HI> and have Letters of notice
<PB N="458" REF="468"/>
sent them thereof: But neither the Lieutenant, nor As∣sistants, can be Chosen two Years togeth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, except the Sovereign should please to be present at the Day or Feast; and after it was Decreed, 23 and 24 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. that this Indulgence should extend to the term of three Years.</P>
<P>Lastly, We observe that this Officer always held the Feast at his peculiar Cost and Charge; and gave liberal Rewards to <HI>Garter,</HI> and for his Escutcheons, as also to the Officers of Arms, Gentlemen-Ushers, Alms-Knights, and to all the several Waiters and Attendants employed in the Ceremony.</P>

<HEAD>The Ceremonies relating to the first <HI>Vespers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§ 6. The first <HI>Chapter</HI> held on the Eve of St. <HI>George</HI> being finished, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> immediately proceed from the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> to the <HI>Choir,</HI> to hear <HI>Vespers.</HI> The Officers of Arms, Prebends, and Alms-Knights, having attended in the North-Isle of the Chappel, do now put themselves in Rank, and continue the Proceeding from the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> Door, along the said North-Isle, to the West Door of the <HI>Choir;</HI> in like manner as they did from the Presence Chamber, to the <HI>Chapter-House:</HI> The Organs then beginning to play, and so continue till <HI>Vespers</HI> begin.</P>
<P>When the Alms-Knights arrive at the West-Door, they first enter in a whole Body, while the rest of the Pro∣ceeding makes a short stand, and pass forward near the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where they make a joint and low Obeysance; next, all turning about by the left Hand, to the Sovereign's Seat; then still turning from the right, to the left Hand, they ascend the <HI>Haut Pas's,</HI> even to the Rails set before the <HI>Altar;</HI> and forthwith divide them∣selves, flanking on each side, the <HI>Juniors</HI> nearest the Rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>This done, the Prebends enter in a Body also, and having made the like Obeysances in the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> divide themselves, and take their Seats; which, by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's <HI>Statutes,</HI> are appointed in the lowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> range of Seats, between, but not in, the Stalls of the <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI> While the Prebends are en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ering their Seats, the Pursuivants, Heralds, and Provincial Kings of Arms, in a Body, likewise enter the <HI>Choir;</HI>
<PB N="459" REF="469"/>
and after due Reverence, pass up to the <HI>Altar,</HI> and join the Alms-K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghts; though anciently some difference was in this Ceremony.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the two <HI>Junior Knights-Companions</HI> enter, passing on till they come near their own Stalls, and there make their Reverences, and then divide, and take their stands directly before their Stalls; and so of the rest of the <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> the <HI>Black-Rod, Gar∣ter,</HI> and <HI>Register,</HI> enter in a Breast, who, proceeding to the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> make their Obeysances, and then pass to their Form, placed on the South-side of the <HI>Choir,</HI> before the Sovereign's Stall, and stand before it. After them, the Chancellor and Prelate in the like manner, stand before their Form, placed near the Sovereign's Seat: And for these Forms, whereon the Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> sit in the Chappel, there is a special Decree for the allow∣ance of them, entered at the end of the Constitutions of their Offices.</P>
<P>Last of all the Sovereign enters, (having the Sword born before him, but his Band of Pensioners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tay at the <HI>Choir</HI> Door, to keep off the Crowd,) who, coming to the Steps which ascend the Royal Seat, makes a Reverence toward the Altar, and then takes Place therein, before he makes a second Reverence.</P>
<P>When the Lieutenant, in the Sovereign's absence, pro∣ceeds to the first <HI>Vespers;</HI> as soon as he enters the <HI>Choir,</HI> and comes near the Sovereign's Stall, He stands and makes a little pause there; then doing his Reverences, after he has again stood a while, before he ascends his own; where being arrived, he makes the double Reverence a second time, and then sits down.</P>
<P>And now to placing the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> in their Stalls: <HI>Garter,</HI> as soon as the Sovereign, or his Lieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣nant, is placed, makes again the usual Reverence in the middle of the <HI>Choir;</HI> then turns to the <HI>Senior</HI> Knights, and doth his Reverence to each of them; whereupon, at one Instant, they make their double Reverences below, where they stood, and strait ascend at the first, or w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stern En∣trance, that goes to the side Stalls; where being arrived, they make again their double Reverences, and then seat themselves. But when the Sovereign's Lieutenant is pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each Knights adds a third Reverence to him, both
<PB N="460" REF="470"/>
when they ascend to, and descend from, their Stalls; and so likewise do all Persons, who pass in the Proceeding, add to their double Reverences so often as there is occasion to make it, after such time as the Lieutenant is entered his Stall; and so long as he continues therein, both on the Eve, the Feast Day, and the Morrow after.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> being all seated, the Prelate and Chancellor pass into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> and having made double Reverences, return to their Forms, and sit down. And after them, in the same manner, the <HI>Register, Garter,</HI> and <HI>Black-Rod,</HI> proceed.</P>
<P>As to the Sovereign's other Attendants, the Noble∣man who carries the Sword retires before the Sovereign's Stall, a little on the right Hand; and the Lord Cham∣berlain of the Houshold, if not a Knight of the <HI>Garter,</HI> and the Vice Chamberlain, on the left, till the Sovereign give them leave to sit down. The Clerk of the Closet stands at the Sovereign's right Hand, but the young Noblemen, that carry up the Sovereign, and the Gentleman of the Robes, sometimes repose themselves on the Steps going to the Sovereign's Stall.</P>
<P>This being done, preparation for <HI>Vespers</HI> begin; in re∣ference to which, the Prelate ascends the <HI>Altar,</HI> it being the Duty of his Office, which if he omits, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined twenty Marks, to the use of the College, unless he give sufficient reason for his absence; in which Case, or on the vacancy of the See of <HI>Winchester,</HI> the Sovereign hath sometimes appointed another Bishop to Officiate for him. The Pro∣ceeding to the <HI>Altar,</HI> on this occasion, is as follows.</P>
<P>First, The Serjeant of the Vestry makes a double Reve∣rence, then comes before the Prelate, and makes a single one to him; who thereon arises from his Seat, and the Serjeant proceeds before him into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where the Prelate makes a double Reverence; and passing forward after the Serjeant, and having ascended the upper∣most <HI>Haut-pas</HI> before the <HI>Altar,</HI> he makes one single Re∣verence toward the same, and so goes to the North side of it.</P>
<P>After which, the two <HI>Provincial Kings, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Pursuivants,</HI> leaving their fore-mentioned Stations, jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n together till they come near the Forms of the <HI>Registe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Garter,</HI> and <HI>Black-Rod;</HI> where, making their double R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verences,
<PB N="461" REF="471"/>
they divide again on each side, and there stand.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Alms-Knights come down into the <HI>Choir</HI> in a Body, and there make their joint double Reverences, and then take their Chairs; all which being finished, Divine Service is begun by the Prelate.</P>
<P>The like Solemnity is observed at any other Place, as well as at <HI>Windsor;</HI> where, because the Alms-Knights are absent, the Pursuivants at Arms ascend nearer the <HI>High-Altar</HI> than when they are at <HI>Windsor;</HI> but this occasions little Variation.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Vespers</HI> are ended, the Prelate goes to the middle of the <HI>Altar,</HI> and with great Reverence makes an Obeysance; and thence, with the Serjeant before him, descends to the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where he makes his double Reverences, and so returns to his Seat; where∣upon all make ready to pass out of the <HI>Choir,</HI> which is performed in much the same manner, and with the same State, as they proceeded thither; and the Servants and Attendants of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are marshalled in the same Order as they were at the beginning of the Proceeding, that the whole Procession may again pass through them.</P>
<P>The Alms-Knights having entered the Guard Chamber, spread themselves on each side thereof; the Prebends pass through them, and fall off on either side the Room to the Presence Chamber Door.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Pursuivants, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Provincial Kings,</HI> proceeding through the Lane made by the Alms-Knights and Prebends, enter the Presence Chamber, and fall off on either side toward the Stall, the King's standing upper∣most.</P>
<P>Then enter the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and place them∣selves on each side of the State, in such Order as they sat in their Stalls, the eldest nearest the State; but those whose Companions are absent, stand alone; after whom follow the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> disposing themselves con∣veniently near the State.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Sovereign passes to the Step before the State, where, being arrived, he turns toward the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> who make their Reverences jointly to him, and he thereon puts off his Cap, and re-salutes them;
<PB N="462" REF="472"/>
which done, the Sovereign and they withdraw into the Privy Chamber till Supper time.</P>
<P>But in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> was held at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> or <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and the Sovereign, as was usual with her, proceeded no farther on the Eve to <HI>Vespers,</HI> than to the great Closet, the or∣dinary way, and thence sent her Lieutenant into the <HI>Choir.</HI> Then, in such Case, when <HI>Vespers</HI> were ended, the Lieu∣tenant returned from the <HI>Choir,</HI> through the great Hall, and so back to the said Closet, and stood at the Door thereof, attending the Sovereign's coming forth; from whence they all proceeded before her into the Presence-Chamber, and there the Ceremony, for that time, ended.</P>
<P>But in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. when the Supper on the Eve, as also the following Meals, were prepared in the Banquetting-House, the Sovereign's Lieutenant fre∣quently returned from the Closet, by the Lobby, to the said Banquetting-House, instead of going to the Pre∣senc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and passing up the State, gave an End to the Ce∣remony till Supper time: And so we find it observed in the 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16 of that King.</P>
<P>When the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are retired, they are not to put off any part of their Robes till Supper is over, for that is prohibited by the <HI>Statutes,</HI> not only to those who do not Sup, as well as those who do. And hereon, 19 <HI>Car.</HI> II. the Sovereign having a mind to take the Air, went into <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> after he had taken leave of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> being with him, but all in full Robes, and so returned to Supper.</P>

<P>§ 7. When the Sovereign is pleased to Sup publickly, on the Eve of the Feast at <HI>Windsor,</HI> the Supper has been always prepared in St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Hall.</HI> The usual P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> was heretofore in the Presence Chamber; of later times, the Banquetting-House; and at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> either the Presence, or the Council Chamber; where the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, were always present.

after the first <HI>Vespers,</HI> to a House prepared for that pur∣pose, and supped there.</P>
<P>But if the Eve of the Feast fell out on a Fasting Day, as it did 22 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and 11 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the Supper was al∣ways omitted; and the Sovereign, with his Lieutenant, and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> were served of the Void only.</P>
<P>Nor does the Sovereign, when he Sups publickly, pass privately to the Place; but as soon as notice is given that the first Mess is set upon the Table, he presently en∣ters the Presence Chamber, whence the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and of Arms, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> in their full Robes, for so the <HI>Statutes</HI> expresly direct, having put them∣selves into their usual Order, proceed before him to St. <HI>George</HI>'s-<HI>Hall:</HI> Where being enteted, the <HI>Pursuivants, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Provincial Kings,</HI> fall off all upon the right Hand, opposite to the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Table, the <HI>Ju∣nior Pursuivants</HI> standing toward the lower End of the Hall. Then the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> passing up beyond them, formerly divided themselves on either side, according to the Decree, 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and made a stand, each taking Place, according to the Order of their Stalls. But at the Feast held at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> 19 <HI>Car.</HI> II. the Sovereign di∣rected that they should stand all on the right Hand side, facing the Table.</P>
<P>Next, the five Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> follow, who as∣cending beyond the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight, retire on the right Hand: After them the Sovereign, and the Officers of Arms, all doing him Reverence as he passes by: Who passing up to the <HI>Haut-pas,</HI> before his own Table, turns himself to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and putting off his Cap, they re∣turn their Reverences jointly to him.</P>
<P>The Sovereign sitting down to Supper, is first served by Water by some Nobleman; then Grace is said by the Prelate; then is the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight conducted to his Table by two Officers of <HI>Arms,</HI> and so the rest in Order, to the Tables appointed them. Whereupon the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and of Arms, retire out of the Hall to Supper.</P>
<P>If a Lieutenant be constituted, he proceeds to Supper in full Robes, and in the same Order as doth the Sove∣reign, and sits alone at the Sovereign's Table, yet on the left Hand of the Cloth of State, being served in all Points with Water, and by a <HI>Cup-bearer, Carver,</HI> and <HI>Sewer,</HI> as the Sovereign himself is.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="474"/>
When Supper is ended, and the Banquet taken away, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceed back in the same Order they came to the Presence Chamber, where the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, standing on the Step before the Cloth of State, Salutes them as before; and then appoints the Hour and Place for the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> to attend him the next Morning: The like, if the Supper be provided in any other Place besides the Presence Chamber, the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> proceed back thither, because the Ceremony ought to end there, as has always been the Custom. And if the Supper be prepared in the Presence Chamber, they then take their Leave in the same Room, there being no occasion to pro∣ceed farther.</P>
<P>If any of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> accompany the Sove∣reign, or his Lieutenant, to his Lodgings, they then go after, not before him, in regard the State of that Night's Service ended in the Presence Chamber; and after they have retired to their Loding, they have Permission to Unrobe.</P>
<P>When the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, do not Sup in St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Hall</HI> on the Eve of the Feast, on the follow∣ing Night, the Officers of Arms have formerly had the Liberty to Eat there; and this Privilege was assigned them by Decree of a <HI>Chapter</HI> held 16 <HI>Eliz.</HI> appointing them <HI>that Table, which was before that time used by the Chancellor, Register,</HI> and other <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Order:</HI> But how they came to lose this Privilege, is not mentioned; for now, instead of sitting in the great Hall, they are ne∣cessitated to Eat in such Rooms of the Castle as they can procure.</P>

<HEAD>CAP. XXI. The Order of the Ceremonies on the Feast Day.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Proceeding to the Chappel in the Morning.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. NOtwithstanding the Celebration of the Feast takes up three Days, <HI>viz.</HI> part of the twenty second, all the twenty third, and part of the twenty fourth of <HI>April,</HI> yet the twenty third, St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Day,</HI> is the Grand Part: The Ceremonies of which may be divided into Sacred and Civil, the first solemnized in the Chappel, the latter in St. <HI>Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge</HI>'s <HI>Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In Order to which, <HI>the Knights-Companions</HI> in full Robes repair to the Sovereign's Privy Lodgings, at the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pointed; as also the Officers of the <HI>Order.</HI> In the mean time the rest of the Degrees and Persons, which made up the Proceeding on the Eve of the Feast, take their several Stations then appointed them, to attend the Sovereign's coming out of the Presence-Chamber.</P>
<P>When the Sovereign, having the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> before him, has entered the Pre∣sence, the Sword is delivered to the Nobleman appointed to bear it; and after the usual Salutations, the Proceeding sets forward to the Chappel in the same Order as on the Eve; the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> having their Trains born by some of their own Gentlemen.</P>
<P>At the Foot of the Stairs, entering the Cloister, or Stone Gallery, twelve Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber attend, with a rich Canopy of Cloth of Gold, who, when the Sovereign approa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, receive him under it, and bear it over his Head, till he comes to the <HI>Choir Door</HI> of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Chappel;</HI> which Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is carried only on the Morn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of the Feast Day, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not at any other time.</P>
<P>The Processional way to the Chappel, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame they traversed on the Eve, if the Sovereign and <HI>Knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s-Com∣panions</HI> proceed to the <HI>Chapter-House</HI> first; for anciently
<PB N="466" REF="476"/>
it was the Custom to hold a <HI>Chapter</HI> in the Morning of the Feast Day, either before Mattins, or after, before the Grand Procession set forward. This Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e received in∣terruption in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, during which, no Chapter was held in the Morning, except in the 26, 31, and 38 Years of her Reign, and then only for admitting some Officers of the <HI>Order:</HI> But the time of holding this <HI>Chapter</HI> was restored by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who several times held it before the first Service began; as in the 5, 14, and 15, of his Reign.</P>
<P>But if no <HI>Chapter</HI> be held at this time, then, as soon as the Proceeding comes near the Chappel, instead of enter∣ing the Passage between the East-end of the Chappel, and King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Tomb House, as it does on the Eve, by reason the Sovereign goes first to the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> it proceeds straight on to the South Door, and thence into the <HI>Choir:</HI> Yet King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in the 15 of his Reign, appointed the whole Proceeding to pass by the said South Door, all along the South side of the Chappel, and then to enter at the West Door, which was then, and since observed.</P>
<P>When the Alms-Knights are come to the West Door of the <HI>Choir,</HI> they enter, and pass up above the Steps of the <HI>Altar,</HI> in the very same Manner and Order as they did on the Eve, and so exactly of the rest: Which being done, the Prelate begins the Morning Service, according to the Order observed in the Common-Prayer, only that the first Lesson being made proper to the Festival, is taken out of the 44 Chapter of <HI>Ecclesiasticus.</HI></P>
<P>This Solemn Proceeding to the Chappel in the Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing of the Feast Day, is, and has been, most usual per∣formed on Foot; yet there are Instances heretofore, where the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> have proceeded on Horse-back, for the greater Splendor and Gallantry of the <HI>Order:</HI> As in 16 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. when several Ladies rode in the Cavalcade, richly adorned, of which Habit mention is already made. So also 3 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. when it was aug∣mented by the Presence of the Queen, and the King's Mother, attended by a splendid Train of Ladies: And again the 22 of the same King, when he held the Feast a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Baynard</HI>'s-<HI>Castle,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> he proceeded on Horse back to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s: The like King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. did at <HI>Windsor,</HI> on the Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> 11 of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn; and K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng

<HI>Philip,</HI> 1 and 2 of <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>Mar.</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the 6 of her Reign, in her whole Habit of the <HI>Order;</HI> so did the Sovereign's Lieutenant at the same Feast ride to the first and second <HI>Vespers,</HI> and to the Morning Ser∣vice the Day after.</P>
<P>It was a Custom begun by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and used when she celebrated St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Feast,</HI> either at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> or <HI>Greenwich,</HI> for the Sovereign's Lieutenant, and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> in full Robes, attended with the Of∣ficers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and of <HI>Arms,</HI> to meet in the Presence Chamber, about nine in the Morning of the Feast Day, and proceed thence as they did the Evening before, through the Guard Chamber, down into the great Hall, and thence into the Chappel, where they took their Stalls, as on the Eve; after which, Morning Prayer was performed as far as the Litany, and this was called the first Service; which done, they all descended from their Stalls, in the accu∣stomed Order, and proceeded back to the Presence, and there waited the coming of the Sovereign, before whom they proceeded a second time to the <HI>Choir,</HI> where the Li∣tany, and Grand Procession began, called the second Ser∣vice, at which the Sovereign was usually Present; but seldom at the first Service.</P>
<P>The first Instance we have met with of this double Proceeding, is recorded in the <HI>Blue-Book</HI> of the <HI>Order,</HI> 3 <HI>Eliz.</HI> and was continued throughout her Reign; and that of King <HI>James</HI> I. not only when the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> was celebrated at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> or <HI>Greenwich,</HI> but also at other times, when celebrated at <HI>Windsor;</HI> and so 1 <HI>Car.</HI> I. But from that time, the Sovereign went to the Chappel at the beginning of Morning Service, which was continued without interruption: Which way has been ever since duly observed.</P>
<P>But when it was known that the Sovereign did not go in the Grand Procession, but his Lieutenant for him; then the Service was constantly gone through withal at once.</P>

down from the <HI>Altar,</HI> on finishing the first Service, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> descended from their Stalls in usual Order; and then the Lieutenant, with the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and of <HI>Arms,</HI> proceeded before him to the Pre∣sence, to conduct the Sovereign to the second Service; which second Proceeding was disposed in the same man∣ner as was that to the first Service in the Morning; only in the latter, because the Sovereign proceeded, the Sword was also carried.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Grand Procession.</HEAD>
<P>§ 3. We are now arrived at the Grand Procession of this most Noble <HI>Order,</HI> which is indeed the most Solemn, and Magnificent Part of the whole Ceremony, and has always been celebrated in the Morning of the Feast Day of St. <HI>George;</HI> or on such other Day, as the Sovereign hath appointed by Prorogation to hold the same. But as to the instant of Time when it began, it has sometimes been uncertain; with respect to the conveniency of the Church Service, when it was conceived most pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per; which was generally at the end of the second Collect, and before the Litany: Nevertheless, in 6 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Feast being then held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> it began presently after the <HI>Te Deum</HI> was Sung; and the twentieth of the said Queen's Reign, at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> after reading the second Lesson. And to come nearer our Times, the Grand Procession set forward, 8 <HI>Car.</HI> I. when the first Service was finished; and 17 <HI>Car.</HI> I. after the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmon was ended: But at the Grand Feast, 13 <HI>Car.</HI> II. it was brought to its usual time, after the last Collect.</P>

<P>What the Order and Manner of this Cerem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be collected from what an old Relator says, of the Solemn Procession made the 29 <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> 5 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. <HI>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was ordered as of old Time accustomed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="479"/>
First went the Alms-Knights, two and two on either side the <HI>Choir,</HI> then the Officers of Arms, next the <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> after them the Officers of the <HI>Order,</HI> and then the Prelate bearing the Heart of St. <HI>George,</HI> un∣der a Canopy honourably assisted, four Noblemen bear∣ing each a Torch; and last of all the Sovereign.</P>
<P>And though here is no mention of any Ecclesiast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks, that joined themselves in the Proceeding; yet it cannot be supposed, that as part of the Divine Service was to be performed, but that some of the Chaplains and Priests were included. And we meet with one Instance, where the Priests not only went in the Grand Processi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, but had a Place assigned in it; where the Gentlemen of the Sovereign's <HI>Chappel,</HI> and <HI>Choir</HI> of <HI>Windsor,</HI> now go.</P>
<P>But it must be confessed, that the Records of the <HI>Order</HI> are very defective in this particular, relating to the Grand Procession, and speak of it only in general, or at most, take notice but of some of those Degrees that attend in it; and this but of late Time neither: Among which, 23 <HI>Eliz.</HI> it is said; <HI>They all proceeded in Order, as the Custom was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the Sovereign following in the Rear of the Proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sion.</P>
<P>As to Place and Precedency, it is in every respect the same, as in the Sovereign's Proceeding to the Chappel, on the Eve of the Grand Feast; only here are some Persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded, which go not in that; Namely, the Gentlemen and Choiristers of the Sovereign's Chappel at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and the Petty-Canons, Vicars, and Choiristers of <HI>Wind∣sor:</HI> The whole Order is as follows.</P>
<P>The Morning Service having proceeded to the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esson, and the Prelate conducted by the Serjeant of the Vestry from the <HI>Altar</HI> to his Seat;</P>
<P>The Alms-Knights rise from their Seats, and pass to the middle of the <HI>Choir;</HI> and af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er their accustomed Reve∣rences, go up to the sides of the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>Next, in like manner, the Officers of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms pass up.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Garter</HI> rises from his Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and makes his usual Reverences; then waving his Rod, summons the <HI>Junior</HI> Knights to descend.</P>

Then the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> being all come down, stand each under his proper Stall.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Black-Rod, Garter,</HI> and <HI>Register</HI> rise, and stand before their Forms.</P>
<P>So do the Chancellor and Prelate.</P>
<P>This done, the Alms-Knights come down from the <HI>Altar,</HI> and passing into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> make again their double Reverences, and proceed out of the <HI>Choir.</HI></P>
<P>After them the Choiristers pass in a Body to the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> and having made their double Reverences, (as do all that follow,) proceed forth two and two.</P>
<P>So do the Vicars of <HI>Windsor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P>Next, the four Petty-Canons come from their Seats, into the middle of the <HI>Choir;</HI> and there begin to Sing an Hymn.</P>
<P>Then follows the Serjeant of the Vestry, bearing his gilt Rod.</P>
<P>After him the Gentlemen of the Chappel at <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>Next the Virger of <HI>Windsor Chappel,</HI> bearing his Silver Rod.</P>
<P>Then the Prebends of <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>

<P>The Nobleman that bears the Sword of State.</P>
<P>Then the Sovereign, above in his Stall, makes a Reve∣rence toward the <HI>Altar,</HI> and being descended, another below; then passes out, and enters under the Canopy, which waits f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r him at the <HI>Choir Door;</HI> the Lord Cham∣berlain of the Houshold, if not a Knight of the <HI>Order,</HI> attending somewhat behind the side of the Canopy, on the Sovereign's right Hand; and the Vice Chamberlain at the like distance on his<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>left; as in the Grand Procession, 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II.</P>

<P>In this Order, to this Day, they proceed with great Devotion; the whole <HI>Choir</HI> Singing the Office appointed,
<PB N="471" REF="481"/>
which heretofore was the Litany; but is now generally a Thanksgiving Hymn.</P>
<P>The Grand Procession, when it has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elebrated at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> or elsewhere than at <HI>Windsor,</HI> is for the most part ordered after the aforesaid manner, as may be seen by the following Scheme.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Serjeant of the Vestry, with his gilt Rod.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Choiristers in Surplices.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Gentlemen of the Chappel in Copes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Subdean in a Cope.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Officers of Arms.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Knights Companions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Officers of the Order.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Sword.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Sovereign under a Canopy, with his Train born up.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Pensioners as before.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But in what this Grand Procession differs from that at <HI>Windsor,</HI> we shall here Note.</P>
<P>First, Here the Serjeant of the Vestry leads the Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding, and is followed by the Choiristers.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Prebends and <HI>Choir</HI> of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and the Alms-Knights, are here wanting.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Subdean and Dean of the Chappel are taken in, and proceed next to the Gentlemen of the Chap∣pel, to whom the Sovereign's Almoner has sometimes joined himself.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whilst the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> are descending from their Stalls, the Gentlemen of the Chappel go into the Vestry, to put on their Copes; but the Dean of the Chappel hath his brought into the <HI>Choir,</HI> which he puts on below, under his Seat.</P>
<P>Fifthly and Lastly, In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ladies Attendants went with the Pensioners on either side the Sovereign.</P>
<P>To contribute more to the Pomp and State of this great Ceremony, a Canopy is born over the Sovereign's Head, by Knights and Gentlemen of Quality, while he passeth in Procession, till he return to the <HI>Choir Door.</HI></P>
<P>The Persons appointed to carry the Canopy, <HI>Anno</HI> 11 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. were four Knights of the Body, when four o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Knights bore four Wax Tapers; but since they are
<PB N="472" REF="482"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber in ordinary, who at the time of the Feast are in waiting, twelve of whom are appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for this Service; the Sovereign hath also the long Train of his Mantle carried up by several of the young Nobility, who receive notice thereof by the Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold.</P>
<P>In like manner the Lieutenants, or Deputies to the So∣vereign, have had their Train carried up in the Proceed∣ings, by Persons of Distinction; and the Train of a Stran∣ger King, personally pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent at <HI>Windsor,</HI> hath also been born up; and in like manner the Train of a Deputy from a Stranger King; and lastly, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> have their Trains carried up by their own Gentlemen.</P>
<P>The Cloaths and Apparel of the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and the great variety of rich Jewels which surround or adorn their Caps, or where else they may appear most conspicuous, shine with great Lustre.</P>
<P>The <HI>Provincial Kings, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Pursuivants,</HI> ha∣bited in their rich Coats, and going together in one Body, appear also very conspicuous, from the Royal Arms of the Sovereign richly Embroidered on them with fine G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, Purples and Twist; the Ground of the <HI>Provincial King's</HI> Coats are blue Velvet, the <HI>Heralds</HI> blue Sattin, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the <HI>Pursuivants</HI> blue Damask.</P>
<P>The Habit in which the Canons of the College pro∣ceed, is also peculiar; for though, as Clergymen, they are vested in Linen Surplices at all times of Divine Ser∣vice, yet at this Solemnity they wear a Mantle over those Surplices, which is a Habit appointed for them, from the Foundation of the <HI>Order;</HI> these Mantles are of <HI>Murry Taf∣fety,</HI> and on the right Shoulder is an Escutcheon of St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Arms</HI> within a Rundlet, Embroidered with Gold and Silk, which is bought at their own Charge.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of the Sovereign's Chappel, the Petty-Canons, and Vicars of <HI>Windsor,</HI> appear in Habits more glorious, being all (or the most part of them) vested in rich Copes of Cloth of Gold, or most costly Embroide∣ries; but the Children of the Chappel and Choiristers, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oceed habited in Surplices of white Linen; lastly, the Habits of the Alms-Knights [a Mantle and Kirtle] are not unremarkable both for Colou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Materials, which appear suitable to their Age and Degree. The Mantles are of Cloth, which the <HI>Statutes</HI> appoint to be of a red
<PB N="473" REF="483"/>
Colour, with a Shield of the Arms of St. <HI>George,</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without a Garter to surround them.</P>
<P>In this Grand Proceeding, the Habits entertain the Be∣holders with a very delightful Prospect, being so ordered, that the Grave are placed between those that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Rich and Gallant; and to add to the greater Shew of this Solemn Ceremony, the Registers of the <HI>Order</HI> make mention of divers Persons of Rank and Quality, who put themselves on the Duty of Attendance on their Sovereign, because related to his Service, though in reference to the <HI>Order</HI> not so concerned as to be taken into the Proceeding; such are divers of the Nobility, sometimes great Ladies, many considerable Officers of the Houshold, and other Courtiers, all richly habited and attired.</P>
<P>To complete the Pomp of this great Solemnity, we may (in the last Place,) fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly remember the Musick, as a part thereof, the <HI>Choirs</HI> of the Sovereign's Chappel at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and at <HI>Windsor,</HI> being united, all Singing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acred Hymn together, while the Grand Procession de∣voutly passeth; and on their return to the <HI>Choir Door,</HI> the Alms-Knights first advance into it, and after double Re∣verences ascend above the <HI>Haut Pas</HI>'s to the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>Next the Choiristers, and in like manner the Vicars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Petty-Canons of <HI>Windsor,</HI> Gentlemen of the Chappel, and Prebends, go to their Seats.</P>
<P>Then the Officers of Arms pass up, and join to the Alms-Knights. After this the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> enter, and stand before their Stalls.</P>
<P>The like doth the <HI>Black-Rod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Garter,</HI> and <HI>Register.</HI></P>
<P>As also the <HI>Chancellor</HI> and <HI>Prelate.</HI></P>
<P>Then doth the Sovereign take his Royal Stall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> ascend their Stalls.</P>
<P>The Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> sit down on their Forms, in the same Manner and Order, and with like Reverences, as at their Entrance into the <HI>Choir,</HI> on the Eve of the Feast.</P>
<P>Then the Prela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, with two Prebends, (appointed to read the Epistle and Gospel,) are conducted, the one by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jeants of the Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try, the other by the Virger, up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>Alta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> (which they approach with usual Reverences,) the Prelate passing to the North-side, and the Prebends to the South, to finish the remaining part of Divine Ser∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="484"/>
Whereupon the Officers of Arms descend into the <HI>Choir;</HI> And</P>
<P>The Alms-Knights go down to their Seats, which, while they are so doing, the two Prebends put on their Copes at the South-side of the <HI>Altar.</HI> This done, the Prelate begins the second Service, which hath been cele∣brated, since the time of the Reformation, according to the Book of <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> and is the same commonly used on any other Feast Day; excepting a peculiar Epistle and Gospel; the first being the thirty third Chapter of <HI>Deute∣ronomy,</HI> and the latter the fifth Chapter of St. <HI>John,</HI> be∣ginning at the twenty fourth Verse, and ending at the thirtieth; which being read, the Creed is Sung.</P>
<P>We may here Note, that before the Reformation, it be∣longed to the Abbot of <HI>Tower-Hill</HI> to read the Gospel, and to the Prior of <HI>Medemenham</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> to read the Epistle.</P>

<HEAD>The Offering of Gold and Silver.</HEAD>
<P>§ 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This Ceremony, whether it be performed in the Sovereign's Chappel at <HI>Windsor,</HI> or in any other Church or Chappel, is one and the same, (except the Sovereign's Offering of Gold and Silver, instead of the <HI>Bezant,)</HI> which is peculiar to <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>The accustomed time of Offering on the Feast Day, is mentioned <HI>Anno</HI> 22 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. to be after the Sovereign's return to his Stall from the Grand Procession, in the time of High Mass, and at this Day begins immediately after this first Sentence of the Offertory is pronounced by the Prelate.</P>
<P>Let your Light so shine before men, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This said, the Organ begins to Play, and forthwith a Groom and Page of the removing Wardrobe, (with Re∣verence first made,) unrol a long Carpet, and spread it be∣fore the <HI>Altar;</HI> which being done, the <HI>Alms-Knights</HI> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, next the <HI>Pursuivants, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Provincial Kings,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cend in usual Order, and flank the Carpet on both sides. Then <HI>Garter</HI> steps from his Seat, and after double Re∣verences, and the usual manner of waving his Rod, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> descend in their accustom'd Order, and stand before their Stalls.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="485"/>
Af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er this, <HI>Black-Rod</HI> goes from his Seat to the <HI>Altar,</HI> towards which, making a single Reverence, he turns his Back, and immediately the Groom of there moving Ward∣robe delivereth him a little Carpet, anciently of Silk, now of Cloth of Gold; and the said Groom holds on his Arms a Cushion of Cloth of Gold, for the Sovereign to Kneel upon, at the time of his Offering, which the <HI>Black-Rod</HI> forthwith lays on the upper <HI>Haut Pas</HI> before the <HI>Al∣tar,</HI> and each of them, as well in delivering, as receiving the Cushion, kiss it.</P>
<P>After this, the Prelate of the <HI>Order</HI> takes a gilt Bason to receive the Sovereign's Offering, and stands before the middle of the <HI>Altar,</HI> with one of the Prebends to assist him, at which time the Sovereign arising makes his Reverence towards the <HI>Altar,</HI> and then descending, makes a little Reverence below, and ascends towards the <HI>Altar</HI> with his Attendants, and being come into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> he makes another Reverence, and at the first <HI>Haut Pas</HI> his last.</P>
<P>He that bears the Sovereign's Offering, is either the <HI>Se∣nior</HI> Knight, the Prince, or the greatest Estate among the <HI>Knig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts-Companions</HI> then present, and no other Person, (of what Degree soever) if he be not of this Noble Fraternity, performs this Service.</P>
<P>The Sovereign being come to the upper <HI>Haut Pas</HI> kneels, at which Instant <HI>Black-Rod</HI> on his Knee delivers (with Assay) the Sovereign's Offering to the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight, or other Person nominated, and he kneeling presents it to the Sovereign, which he immediately Offers into the Bason held by the Prelate, and then ariseth, and is conducted and attended, as when he came up to Offer; at the Entrance into his Stall, he turns and makes a Reverence, and his Attendants also bow towards the <HI>Altar;</HI> and being at∣tended into his Stall, doth the like again, and then re∣poseth himself in his Seat.</P>
<P><HI>An Entry is made in the</HI> Red-Book, Anno <HI>6</HI> Car. <HI>I.</HI> That whereas in other Places (besides <HI>Windsor)</HI> the Sovereign is wont to Offer a certain Gold Piece, (vulgarly called a Bezant) to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edeemed afterwards at a certain Price; the Usher of the <HI>Black-Rod</HI> having been admonished, that in these Ser∣vices the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is no Redemption to be made, should never present the Bezant at <HI>Windsor</HI> to the Sovereign, but Gold and Sil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r of English Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="486"/>
When the Sovereign is absent, and the Lieutenant Of∣fers for him, he performs the Ceremony as follows.</P>
<P>First, (After the Preparations made for the Offering, as aforesaid,) he descends from his Stall with the usual Re∣verences, and goes to the Steps ascending the Sovereign's Stall, and there stands a while; then making his double Obeysance, he proceeds towards the <HI>Altar</HI> (the Officers of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der</HI> going before him,) with one other Reverence in the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> and another at the first <HI>Haut Pas</HI> of the <HI>Altar;</HI> the Carpet and Cushion is spread and laid for him, as is for the Sovereign, and the Offering al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o given in the same way, and the Lieutenant kneeling puts it in the Bason, and returns to the Sovereign's Stall in the same Order, &amp;c. he came; where standing a while again before it, he makes a Reverence towards it, and then goes up into his own Stall, where (if it fall out that the Lieutenant is not the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight,) he stays to receive the Reverences of all the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> his <HI>Seniors,</HI> as they go up to Offer, and when his own turn comes to Offer, he descends with a double Reverence, and procee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s up with his Fellow, (if present) and Offers for himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his own Place, but his Train is then let down, the Car∣pet, &amp;c. taken away, and only two Officers of Arms (but none of the <HI>Order)</HI> proceeds before him, and when he has Offer'd, he returns to his Stall.</P>
<P>But it seems, 7 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. that <HI>Garter</HI> alone, on the Feast Day, brought up the Prince, then the Sovereign's Lieu∣tenant, when he came to Offer for himself, which Service ought to have been performed by <HI>Clarenceux</HI> and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rroy,</HI> which was an oversight in <HI>Garter;</HI> as likewise his bringing down at the same, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> out of their Stalls to Offer, before the Epistle and Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pel were Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, contrary to the usage of former times; by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y were kept a tedious time waiting below in the <HI>Choir,</HI> before the Offering began. But 11 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. the Prince was brought up by <HI>Clarenceux</HI> and <HI>Norroy,</HI> when he came to Offer, and not by <HI>Garter.</HI> When the Lieutenant hath Offered for himself, he returns to the lower end of the Stalls, and passes to his own, where having paid the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al Reverences, he enters it, and is ready to receive the Re∣verences of all the other <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, is return∣ed to his Stall, the two Provincial King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pass down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Which humble Ceremony of kneeling, not being heretofore used, was fixed by a Decree of 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> Offerings are both of Silver and Gold, which is receiv'd by two of the Prebends, or by one Prebend and one Chantor, anciently by one Chantor only, when the Offering is at <HI>Windsor;</HI> but by the Dean of the Chappel, when at <HI>White-Hall.</HI> The Offering being made, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> rise, and forthwith divide themselves, <HI>Clarenceux</HI> conducting the <HI>Senior</HI> Knight to the lower end of the Stalls on the Sovereign's side; and <HI>Norroy</HI> the next <HI>Junior</HI> Knight, to the lower end of the Stalls on the Prince's side; and at parting make their Reverences, and return to their Stations before the <HI>Altar.</HI> The Knights, at their Entrance into the Stalls, make their double Reverences together, and then pass on to their own; where making the like Reverences, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake their Seats.</P>
<P>But if any Stranger King be present at the Offering, he does not retire to his Seat, by the lower end of the Stalls, but along the <HI>Choir,</HI> as does the Sovereign, the same way he proceeded up: So did the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> I.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of the two <HI>Senior</HI> Knights Offering bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g finished, the two <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nior He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alds</HI> observing their last R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verences, pass down into the <HI>Choir,</HI> in the same manner a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did <HI>Clarenceux</HI> and <HI>Norro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> to bring up the next t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Senior</HI> Knights to Offer, who use all the same Ceremonies,

and are conducted back in like manner to the <HI>Altar;</HI> and so of the other, brought up by the two next <HI>Senior Heralds; Clarenceaux</HI> and <HI>Norroy</HI> beginning again, if there are more Knights than the <HI>Heralds</HI> in one Course supply; and after them the <HI>Heralds</HI> again, till the whole is ended: And here it may be noted, that where any Knight goeth single to Offer, he hath nevertheless two <HI>Heralds</HI> to attend him.</P>
<P>Touching the Offerings themselves, made in the Chap∣pel of <HI>Windsor,</HI> they belong of right to the Dean and Pre∣bends, being conferr'd on them by the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the College: And ordained also, that the <HI>Chantor</HI> should see them receiv'd, and faithfully kept; and at the end of every Month, or Weekly, if the College required it, give an Account of what was receiv'd: All which was con∣firmed by King <HI>Edward</HI> III. the Bishop, Dean, and Chap∣ter of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> to whose Jurisdiction the College of <HI>Windsor</HI> belongs; and also by the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> Prelate of the <HI>Garter,</HI> 1352. But Dr. <HI>Montague,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> at the Feast at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. challen∣ged a right to the Offerings; and Bishop <HI>Andrews</HI> did <HI>de Facto</HI> both receive, and keep the Offerings, whenever he officiated at <HI>Windsor.</HI> But on complaint of the Dean and Prebends of <HI>Windsor,</HI> this matter was referred to the Chap∣ter; yet we do not find that any final or positive Deter∣mination was ever made to the time of the Restauration, from which time the right of the Dean and Canons has never been disputed, and the <HI>Statutes</HI> have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly taken Place.</P>
<P>What has usually been offered, either in Gold or Silver, we shall see by the Account given in by the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I. at St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Feast</HI> at <HI>Windsor, September</HI> 24.</P>
<P>The whole Offering of the eight Knights, is four Pounds fifteen Shillings, <HI>viz.</HI> in Gold ten Shillings each, and in Silver two; excepting the Lord Steward, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Offering in Silver was only one Shilling; besides the So∣vereign's <HI>Bezant</HI> redeemable.</P>

<P>The eight <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> the same as the Day before; the whole, besides the King's <HI>Bezant,</HI> eleven Pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="489"/>
When all the Knights have offered, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturned to their Stalls, the Chancellor of the <HI>Order</HI> makes his Reve∣rences; and after him, the <HI>Register, Garter,</HI> and <HI>Black-Rod,</HI> theirs together, and take their Seats: Next, the Carpet being rolled up by the Groom and Page of the removing Wardrobe, the <HI>Provincial Kings, Heralds,</HI> and <HI>Pursui∣vants,</HI> and last of all the Alms-Knights, make their Reve∣rences, and pass into the <HI>Choir,</HI> where they remain till the Prelate has finished the second Service; who, conducted by the Serjeant of the Vestry, comes down from the <HI>Altar</HI> with his accustomed Reverences to his Seat. After whom, the two Prebends are brought down by the Virger, who making their usual Reverences take their Seats.</P>

<P>The Sovereign hath most frequently sat alone, though sometimes heretofore he hath been pleased to admit some of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to sit at the Table with him; but this Honour has not been offered to any of them since the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> As soon as the Sove∣reign is placed, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> put on their Caps, and remaining covered, retire against the Tables pre∣pared for them; where Water is brought them by a Gentleman of Quality; and having washed, they all sit down.</P>
<P>The Order of passing to their Seats at the Table, 19 <HI>Car.</HI> II. and so appointed to be observed for the future, was after the following manner. First, The Duke of <HI>York</HI> entered the Rails at the upper end of the Table, and passed down the hither side, to the lower end, and thence to the bench-side to his Place: In like manner followed all the other Knights, according to the Seniority of their Stalls, as it is ordained they shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, and not according to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Estates or Dignities, (except the Sons of Stranger Kings, Princes, and Dukes,) and all on the right Hand, or far∣ther side of their Table, not one against another, but two and two at a Table to a Mess, and those whose Oppo∣sites are wanting to sit alone, and have a whole Mess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Their Meat being usually brought up by the Yeomen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Guard; and are attended by some of the Gentlemen Pensioners, and others of the Sovereign's Servants, two to each Table.</P>
<P>It appears that anciently the Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad a Table allowed them in the great Hall, and sat covered
<PB N="481" REF="491"/>
in the Sovereign's Presence; but on the Eve of the Feast, 10 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. it was ordered in <HI>Chapter,</HI> That they should be at their Choice, to keep the Feast privately by themselves, or sit uncovered where the Sovereign dined. Whereupon, from that time, they forbore sitting in the Hall, or where else the Sovereign and <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> sat. It like∣wise appears, that the Officers of Arms did anciently sit in St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Hall,</HI> at a Table joined to that, at which the Officers of the <HI>Order</HI> sat.</P>
<P>Before the Entrance of the Sovereign's second Course, he stands up and drinks to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> (and so it is remembred to be done by <HI>Phil.</HI> and <HI>Mar.)</HI> they standing all the while uncovered, till they have all pledged him: Which done, the Officers of Arms make themselves ready, at the lower end o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Hall, to proceed up in the following <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Garter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Clarenceux and Norroy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Heralds two and two.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Pursuivants two and two.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And so altogether make their Reverence to the Sove∣reign, and proceed near the side of the Knights Table, till they come to the middle of the Hall, where, after another Reverence made, they go still forward; and when <HI>Garter</HI> has passed about two Yards beyond the Knights Tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and come near the <HI>Haut Pas</HI> as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nding the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vereign's State, they make the like Reverence again jointly. Then <HI>Garter</HI> with a loud and audible Voice cries Largess thrice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though anciently but twice.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Garter's</HI> beginning to cry Largess, all the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> unless Kings and great Princes, if any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e present, stand up uncovered, till he has made an en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; (which Custom, it seems, 7 <HI>Car.</HI> I. had been disconti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed for some time.) Then <HI>Garter</HI> proceeds, and Proclaims the Sovereign's Stiles and Titles of Honour, first in <HI>Latin,</HI> after in <HI>French,</HI> and lastly in <HI>English;</HI> he and the Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs of Arms making a Reverence between; and at the end join altogether in crying Largess thrice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and then a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l make Reverence together.</P>
<P>Hereupon, sometimes the Treasurer of the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hold puts the Sovereign's La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gess, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unds in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="482" REF="492"/>
into <HI>Garter</HI>'s Hat; and this is afterwards divided amon the Officers of Arms, according to Custom. But <HI>Ann<SUP>o</SUP></HI> 23 <HI>Car.</HI> II. the <HI>Black-Rod</HI> put the Largess into <HI>Garter</HI>'s Hat. This being finished, all the Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of Arms retire about three Yards backward, keeping their Faces towards the Sovereign, and there make a Reverence, and so a second, and thence retire out of the Hall to Dinner.</P>
<P>This Ceremony ended, the Sovereign's second Course is brought up; first the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jeants at A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, next the Trea∣surer and Comptroller of the Houshold, next the Sewer, then the Gentlemen-Pensioners, bearing the Messes; then the Cofferer and Master of the Houshold, the two Clerks of the Green-Cloth, the two Clerks Comptrollers, and lastly the two Clerks of the Kitchin, hab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted in their Gowns, and their Caps in their Hands. And after the Sovereign's Table is compleatly furnished, the second Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is served up to the Knights Table by the Yeomen of the Guard, in such Order as was the first.</P>
<P>But where any <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pens to be in∣stalled at this Grand Feast, and is present at Dinner, then <HI>Garter,</HI> and the Officers of Arms, proceed in Order, (after they have proclaimed the Sovereign's Stile,) from the lower end of the Hall, till they come before the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w installed Knight's Mess, and there <HI>Garter</HI> cries Large<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s once, and Proclaims his Stile in <HI>English</HI> only; and then retires to Dinner.</P>
<P>In the last Place comes in the Banquet, brought to the Sovereign's Table by the Pensioners, in the same Or∣der as the Messes; (only in Place of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erk of the Kitchin, the Chief Clerk of the Spicery waits,) and the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quet for the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> by the Yeomen of the Guard.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> rise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst, and having washed, place themselves a little be ow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> State, in their usual Order, and make their Reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Sovereign.

<P>§ 1.

<P>It was the ancient Custom to Celebrate a <HI>Chapter</HI> in the Morning of the last Day of the Feast, before the Sove∣reign proceeded to the Chappel, chiefly to make Election of Knights, where any Stall is void; which has some∣times been held, when the Sovereign did not go to the Chappel, in the Privy Chamber, and then the Lieutenant, waving the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI> proceeds straight on to the Chappel, and enters at the South Door.</P>

<HEAD>CAP. XXIII. The Observation of the Grand Feast by absent Knights.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Absent Knights enjoined to observe the Grand Feast.</HEAD>
<P>§ 1. HAving shewn with what Magnificence and Ce∣remony the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> has been, and ought to be observed; as also how strictly the <HI>Statutes</HI> oblige the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to appear an∣nually thereat; and what severe Penalties they are liable to, if absent, except on reasonable Cause of Absence. Yet lest the Honour might receive diminution, from too sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll an Appearance at its publick Solemnities; it was farther at the Institution of the <HI>Order</HI> Decreed: <HI>That none of them should depart the Kingdom, without first ac∣quainting the Sovereign, and obtaining his special Leave and License;</HI> nevertheless the Sovereign granted them License to go beyond Sea, before the rest of his Subjects, if they were dispos'd to undertake any Military Expedition, from whence any Glory of Knighthood might be hop'd for.</P>
<P><HI>It was then by the eleventh Article also ordained; (on whatsoever occasion the Absence might be,)</HI> That where∣soever any of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> resided, during the said Feast, they should wear their Mantles of the <HI>Order,</HI> from the Hour of the first <HI>Vespers</HI> on the Eve of St. <HI>George,</HI> till the sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Vespers</HI> on the Feast Day were finished; as they should have done, had they been present in Person, with the Sovereign or his Deputy, during the whole Celebra∣tion of the Feast; (in case they were not deprived of their Liberty.) the Pror<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gation of the Feast notwithstanding.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. observing the Custom of these Cele∣brations began to be neglected, in the eleventh year of his Reign, enlarged the Law in this particular, explaining the said eleventh Article. He declar'd and enjoin'd the wearing of the whole Habit on the Eve of St. <HI>George,</HI> if the <HI>Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght-Companion</HI> were not under restraint. Then he
<PB N="487" REF="497"/>
enumerated the times for wearing it; to wit, on the Eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at all times of Divine Service, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner and Supper; unless in case of War, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckness, or other just Impediment; when it was sufficient, if the absent Knight did wear the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> either in a Gold Chain, or Silk Rib∣bond.</P>
<P>And when the same Sovereign, about three Years aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made a general Reformation of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> he enjoin'd the absent <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> (unless under restraint,) to prepare a Capital Stall in the Church or Chappel where he design'd to hear Service, to the Honour of the Sove∣reign; in which should be set up the Arms of the <HI>Order</HI> within a <HI>Garter;</HI> and also to erect another Stall, as far in distance (according to the proportion of the said Church or Chappel,) from the Stall of the Sovereign, as is the absent Knights Stall in the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and there∣in place his own Arms: And should wear the whole Habit of the <HI>Order,</HI> and hear Divine Service, such as the Church ordained for the said time; as well on the Eve and Morning, as on the Afternoon on the Feast Day. He is like∣wise to do Reverence towards the <HI>Altar,</HI> in the Honour of God, and after towards the Stall erected for the Sove∣reign, at his coming in and going out of the said Church or Chappel, and as often as he should pass before the said Stall. But Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erors, King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Princes, or Electors, are excepted, who may place their Seats and Stalls as they think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting.</P>
<P>This Decree is still in full force, and we shall only fur∣ther observe, that it has been usual for the absent Knight to perform the same Ceremonies as near as may be to what is observed at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and to be attended with a convenient Number of Gentlemen before him, well ha∣bited, with the Officers of his Houshold, &amp;c. who, ac∣cording to their Degrees, proceed two and two together bare-headed; and that he Dines and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps alone at all times, unless a <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> be with him.</P>

<HEAD>In what manner the Feast hath been observ'd by absent Knights.</HEAD>
<P>§ 3. Of this, the <HI>Black-Book</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> gives a very considerable Precedent; Namely, the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> held at the Palace of <HI>Hereford,</HI> by Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> 15 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. being then in his Government of the Princi∣pality of <HI>Wales;</HI> and had with him Sir <HI>Richard Pool,</HI> one of the <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> where every thing, according to the form of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> was duly observed. The Prince's Sword was born before his Stall, and the Service perfor∣med by his <HI>Herald</HI> with great exactness. Likewise the Sovereign's <HI>Herald</HI> stood all the while before the Sove∣reign's Stall, which was adorned with accustomed Orna∣ments; and the Bishop, who performed Divine Service, had his Seat erected near the High <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>There are other Instances, as particularly those obser∣ved by Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Ludlow,</HI> 23 and 24 Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> which were very remarkable.</P>
<P>As to the observation of the Feast, by a Knight beyond Sea, there is an Instance in <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> Lieu∣tenant for Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Governor, and Captain Ge∣neral of the united Provinces, and there celebrated the Feast, 1586. He had an Escutcheon of the <HI>Order,</HI> impail∣ed with the Sovereign's Arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt to the front of his House, so also to the back of her Stall in the Church, and his own Arms at the back of his own Stall.</P>
<P>He proceeded on Hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-back to the Church, a Pursui∣vant riding before him, wearing a King of Arms's Coat; who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmon, proceeded before him to the Offering; which he made for the Sovereign and himself; Service being ended, he returned to his Lodging, and dined with great Solemnity.</P>

<HEAD>Dispensations for Absence granted during Life.</HEAD>
<P>§ 5. Sometimes Dispensations for Absence have been obtained for Life, upon the Petite of the <HI>Knights-Com∣panions</HI> setting forth their Age and Infirmity: An Instance of which, we find was grant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the Lord <HI>Dacrees,</HI> 26 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> I. and the Lord <HI>Musgrave;</HI> but both with this Restriction; that the absent should be obliged to send to <HI>Garter</HI> for his Escut∣cheons, at the same time that he sent his Excuse, and Petite for Dispensation; and should solemnly keep in his own House the Feast, with all the sacred Rites and Ce∣remonies, in his Robes, and other Ornaments, if Health permit; and in Case of Sickness, upon his Bed, accor∣ding to the ancient <HI>Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>This Act was thought of so great Importance to be ob∣served, that the Chancellor was ordered to transcribe it, and send it to each of the <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> acquaint∣ing them at the same time, with the Penalties they should be liable to, if they neglected the least Punctilio.

But Felony comes not within the compass of this <HI>Statute,</HI> as not being expresly mentioned among the Reproaches there Summ'd up; and so it was adjudged in a <HI>Chapter,</HI> 14 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. in the Case of <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Somerset,</HI> then lately condemned for that Fact, whereon his Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chments were not removed.</P>
<P>When a <HI>Knight-Companion</HI> is found Guilty of any of the Offences mentioned in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's <HI>Statutes,</HI> he is usually degraded at the next <HI>Chapter,</HI> of which the So∣vereign gives the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> previous notice; and then commands <HI>Garter</HI> to attend such of them as are appointed to go to the Convict Knight, who, in a solemn manner, first takes from him the <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Ribbond,</HI> and then his <HI>Garter.</HI> And at the ensuing Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> or sooner, if the Sovereign appoint it, publication of his Crimes and Degradation is made by <HI>Garter.</HI></P>
<P>Next, <HI>Garter,</HI> by Warrant to that purpose, takes down his Atchievement, on which Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice he is vested in his Coat of Arms, and the Officers of Arms standing ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut him, the <HI>Black-Rod</HI> also present; First <HI>Garter</HI> reads aloud the Instruments of Degradation, after which one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Heralds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> who is placed ready on a Ladder set to the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of the Convict Knight's Stall, at the Words <HI>expelled, and put from among the Arms,</HI> takes his Crest, and violently casts it down into the <HI>Choir,</HI> after that his Banner and Sword; and when the Publication is read out, all the Officers of Arms spurn the Atchievements out of the <HI>Choir,</HI> into the Body of the Church, first the Sword, then the Banner, and last of all the Crest, so out of the West Door<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thence to the Bridge, and over into the Ditch; and thus it was done at the Degradation of <HI>Edward,</HI> Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham,</HI> 13 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. Their Plates are likewise tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n down from their Stalls and carried away.</P>
<P>Degradation not being alone thought sufficient, it was debated in <HI>Chapter,</HI> 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. whether the Names of such <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> as were convicted of Treason should remain in the <HI>Registers,</HI> or be razed out: Where the Sovereign determined; That wheresoever the Actions or Names of such Offenders should be found, these Words <HI>[Vah Proditor]</HI> should be Written in the Margin; by which

<P>The Monies so collected, (called <HI>Obiit Monies)</HI> were by the said Decree appointed to be distributed in Alms-Deeds,
<PB N="492" REF="502"/>
<HI>as the Reparation of High Ways, the Relief of the Poor,</HI> &amp;c. The receipt and disbursements of these Sums were committed to the care of the Dean and Register.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ashmole,</HI> has made this addition in his Library, which it will not be out of our way to observe, for the information of those who may be desirous to know how the Point then stood; that not withstanding the aforesaid Order in <HI>Chapter,</HI> made the 24th of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. for changing the Number of Masses usually Sung for defunct Knights, into a pecuniary Rate, according their degrees; the Prayers for Souls departed, both by private Persons, as also by the Clergy, in Masses and Exequies; nay farther, to give Alms to others, and to pray for them, was continued by the Church of <HI>England</HI> several Years beyond that space; for in a Book, entituled the <HI>Institution of a Christian Man,</HI> &amp;c. made by the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> as appears by the Subscriptions of the Archbishops, Bishops, and others of the Clergy to the Preface; dedicated by them to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and printed by <HI>Thomas Bartelet,</HI> the King's Printer, <HI>Anno</HI> 1537. <HI>cum Privilegio,</HI> the Article of Purg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tory is there set down.</P>
<P>But to proceed. This charitable distribution, in a <HI>Chap∣ter</HI> held at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. was enlarged to the relief of the Poor in the Town of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and other Towns, Villages, and Places, at the discretion of the Dean of <HI>Windsor.</HI> And though the said Decree was con∣firmed by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> yet for many Years, the Collection of these <HI>Obiit</HI> Monies was neglected; till in 9 <HI>Car.</HI> I. the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> out of his great Generosity, as well as his Zeal for restoring so pious a Work, reiterated to the Sovereign the ancient Decrees made in this Case. Whereupon it passed in <HI>Chapter,</HI> that the same should be revived, and for ever continued; and that the same should begin for the five Knights<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whose Atchievements were offered at that Feast, <HI>viz.</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Elect or Palatine, the Earls of <HI>Northumberland, Banbury,</HI> and <HI>Rutland.</HI> And as to Stranger Princes, it pleased the Sovereign to express himself, <HI>That as by the</HI> Statutes <HI>they are left</HI> to perform these Payments by themselves, if they wou'd; so, if it were not done by them, that both then, and for the fu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, the same should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e paid by the Sovereign him∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf.</P>

<HEAD>Of fixing on the Stalls Plates of their Arms and Stiles.</HEAD>
<P>§ 2. The next thing provided for by the <HI>Statutes</HI> of Insti∣tution, was the deceased Knight's Honour; in regard of which, it was ordained, <HI>That when any one of the first Founders should die, there should be in Metal an Escutcheon of his Arms, with his Helm, or Crest, fastened at the back of his Stall, for a Mark of Honour to him that bore them.</HI> And in like manner, <HI>that their Successors should have a like Escutcheon fixed on the back of their Stalls;</HI> and to difference them from those of the first Founders, they were appointed to be made somewhat less, and to be placed a little underneath them. But this Article relates only to the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> not to the Sovereigns of the <HI>Order;</HI> nor do we find that any of them had Plates of their Arms and Stiles set upon the back of their Stalls, in manner as is before prescribed to the rest of the <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in his Body of <HI>Statutes,</HI> alters this Article in three particulars; first, as to the setting up their Plates, which he appoints not to be after their Deaths, but within, after the Installation of every <HI>Knight-Com∣panion;</HI> secondly, as to the nature of the Metal, that it may be such as the Knight shall please himself: And lastly, as to the size, though he also restrains the <HI>Knights-Subjects</HI> to a lesser than those of the first Founders; yet he gives liberty to the <HI>Knights-Strangers</HI> to use their Plates and Fashions at Pleasure. As to the first of these, it has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty duly observed; and indeed the second, of making them of Copper; but the last, <HI>viz.</HI> the size, has been very little regarded; for the very Plates of those Knights who were soon af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er installed, and thence downwards, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e larger than those of the first F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>In tract of time, many of these Memorials were, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrilegious Hands, taken away, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h King <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="494" REF="504"/>
taking notice of, and desirous to put a stop to a Mischief not in his Power to prevent, and to preserve the Re∣membrance of the precedent <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> com∣manded the Dean of <HI>Windsor</HI> to describe the Stiles of those that remained in a Book, which he accordingly did, and deposited the same in the College: But what became of this Book, could not be afterwards discovered; so that the most that could be done, was to draw the Arms, and Copy out the Stiles, engraven on the Plates then remain∣ing; from whence the following Observations may be made.</P>
<P>First, That for many Years after the Institution of the <HI>Order,</HI> the Plate whereon the Shield was engraved, bore no other Inscription, than the deceased Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght's Name, set at the Foot thereof, under the Escutcheon of his Arms. Afterwards, the chief Title of Honour began to be ad∣ded, though now and then, in the first and elder times, both were omitted, as also their Crests. But about the beginning of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Reign, not only the Knight's chief Title, but all othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Titles and Dignities, whether Honorary, or Officiary, were drawn together in one Inscription, concluding with that of Knight of this most Noble <HI>Order;</HI> and which, about the same time, the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> used to insert, in all their publick and private Instruments of Writing; a Custom observed by the Knights of other Sovereigns <HI>Orders</HI> Abroad.</P>
<P>At first the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> gave their Paternal Coats of Arms, singly and without any Quarterings; but toward the beginning of <HI>Hen.</HI> V. they began to add their Quarterings, as appears from the Escutcheons of <HI>Hugh,</HI> Lord <HI>Burnel,</HI> who died 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> V. Sir <HI>Lewis R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bessart,</HI> and others. Yet was not the same generally used, but left to the Pleasure of the <HI>Knights-Companions.</HI></P>
<P>But of later times, this very thing was thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch concern, that where a Knight has been elected, who wanted Quarterings, the Sovereign has been pleased to grant him another Coat of Arms, to quarter with his Paternal Coat; that his Banner, which ought to hang over his Stall, might not seem too naked.</P>
<P>Soon after King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Accession, the Knights compassed their Shields with the Royal <HI>Garter,</HI> and there∣on (such as were Noblemen) placed the Coronet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elong∣ing to their Dignity. As to Supporters, we observe two
<PB N="495" REF="505"/>
Plates to which they are added; the one of <HI>John Beau∣fort,</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> of that Name, elected 20 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. the other of <HI>Anthony Widvile,</HI> Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> ele∣cted 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. and besides these, till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. there is not another Example: But then it gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w into common usage, as also the ingraving their pecu∣liar Motto's, or Devices upon the Plates.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Offering of Atchievements.</HEAD>
<P>§ 3. A third Honour paid to the defunct Knight, is a most solemn Offering up his Atchievements at the High <HI>Altar;</HI> namely, the Banner of his Arms, his Sword, Hel∣met, and Crest, with its Mantlings; all which had been set up over his Stall at his Installation. The Ceremony of Offering these Ensigns does not appear to have been regulated at the Institution of the <HI>Order,</HI> but rather added as an additional Honour, by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. and the manner thereof set down in the fourteenth Article of his Body of <HI>Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>This Solemnity is local to the Chappel of St. <HI>George,</HI> within the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> and not to be performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the Sovereign has notice of the <HI>Knight-Companion's</HI> Death.</P>
<P>In 1 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. at the Feast then held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> there arose a Question, whether the Atchievements of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. which yet hung over the Sovereign's Stall, should be taken down and offered at the Mass of <HI>Requiem</HI> ensuing, or not? in regard his Banner, Sword, Helm, and Crest, with Mantles, had been offered up before, at his Interment within that Chappel. In conclusion of which it was determined, <HI>That the said Atchievements shou'd not again be offered, but remain over the Sovereign's Stall, for his Son King</HI> Edward VI. But when the So∣vereigns of this most Noble <HI>Order</HI> are not interred at <HI>Windsor,</HI> then their Atchievements are offered up the next ensuing Feast; as were those of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which the <HI>Blue-Book</HI> notes to be done at Morning Prayer.</P>
<P>As to the time for performing this Ceremony, it was ordained to be on the Morrow after the Feast, when the Mass was Sung for the Souls of the <HI>Knights-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpanions,</HI> &amp;c. and so was duly observed till the time of the Refor∣mation, when the Mass of <HI>Requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> being abolished, it was nevertheless at the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rning S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, on the Morrow immediately
<PB N="496" REF="506"/>
after the Offertory: But after Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had removed the Feast of St. <HI>George</HI> from <HI>Windsor,</HI> this Solemnity was frequently di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>patched in one Day, before they went out of the <HI>Choir;</HI> and the ancient Rule, as to the time, being thus broke, was never after restored, but generally performed the very same Morning wherein the elect Knights were installed: And though the Day was thus changed, yet the Ceremony it self was not performed till after the Installation was finished, that Solemnity having always the Precedency, till 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. when he observing how incongruous it seemed, to instal a new Knight before his Predecessor had been fully discharged of his Stall, gave Order for Offering the Atchievements of Sir <HI>Henry Lea,</HI> the Lord <HI>Scroop,</HI> and others, before the Instalment of the elect Knights.</P>
<P>Not long after, it was thought convenient to perform this Ceremony on the Eve of the Feast, presently af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the first <HI>Vespers</HI> began; and next to proceed with the In∣stallations; whereby, as much as possible, the Stalls of the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> might be supplied, in all the rest of the Solemnities of the Feast. But if at any time, any of the new elect Knights were introduced into the <HI>Choir,</HI> before the Offering of the Atchievements began, they were appointed to stand there under the Stalls designed for them till that Ceremony was finished.</P>
<P>Thus it continued from the said 9 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. till the 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II. when it was performed at the time anciently ac∣customed for it; the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> being both installed before the first <HI>Vespe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> began, and the Atchievements of the defunct Knights not offered till the Morrow after the Feast Day.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Manner and Order of this Ceremony, among other Institutions of King</HI> Henry <HI>V. it is appointed,</HI> That as often as, through the vacancy of any Stall, the Sword<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Helms, with the rest of the defunct Knights, ought to be offered, the Sword of the deceased Knight shall be first offered, being carried up to the <HI>High Altar</HI> by two of the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> and afterwards the Helm, with the Crest and Mantlings, by two other <HI>Knights-Companions;</HI> and this Offering is to be made for them, in the Order they were installed, not as they died.</P>
<P>But of the Offering of a defunct Knight's Banner, we find no express mention till 18 <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. at which time
<PB N="497" REF="507"/>
the Banner of the Lord <HI>Brook</HI> was offered: But after∣wards the direction for Offering their Ensign and Banner was taken into King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's Body of <HI>Statutes.</HI> And since the same were introduced, according to the fore∣going Precedent, it was to be offered first, and so hath been generally observed.</P>
<P>By the appointment of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry</HI> V. the So∣vereign is to nominate and assign the <HI>Knights Compani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> who are severally to perform this Ceremony; and so is the direction in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's <HI>Statutes:</HI> But since the begin∣ning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, the Knights have gene∣rally proceeded to this Offering, according to their Se∣niority; and when the Course ended, then the <HI>Seniors</HI> began again. There are likewise many Examples where the Sovereign's Lieutenant has joined in the Ceremony to as∣sist the other Knights: Nor is a Proxy, or Deputy, to be admitted to perform any part of the Ceremony, though in the Offering of Money he ought.</P>
<P>We shall next proceed to the Duties of the Prelate of the <HI>Order,</HI> the Prebends, and Officers of Arms<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as their Services severally, or jointly, relate to the performance of this Ceremony. First then, the Prelate, and two Pre∣bends, ought to proceed up to the <HI>Altar,</HI> immediately be∣fore <HI>Garter</HI> summons down the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to the Offering; and there stand ready to receive the At∣chievements, as they are severally offered up.</P>
<P>It is next the Duty of the <HI>Provincial Kings,</HI> and <HI>Heralds,</HI> to conduct the <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> when they proceed up to the <HI>Altar,</HI> bearing any part of the defunct Knight's At∣chievements. The whole Ceremony is briefly thus.</P>
<P>First <HI>Garter</HI> rises from his Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and proceeds into the middle of the <HI>Choir,</HI> where, after his usual Obeysances, he summons the <HI>Knights-Companions</HI> to descend, who come down and place themselves before their Stalls: Where∣upon <HI>Clarenceux</HI> and <HI>Norroy</HI> (or in the ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of either, the <HI>Senior Herald,</HI> or of both, of the two eldest <HI>Heralds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)</HI> pass down from the Steps of the <HI>Altar</HI> into the Body of the <HI>Choir;</HI> in the interim <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> takes the <HI>Banner</HI> of the eldest defunct Knight, and presents it, half rolled up, to the two <HI>Senior Knights-Companions;</HI> the two <HI>Provincial Kings</HI> by this time approaching them, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke their double Reverences, and after to the other <HI>Knights<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Companions<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tand a little aside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while the two <HI>Senior</HI> Knights<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="498" REF="508"/>
having taken the <HI>Banner</HI> between them, make their double Reverence, and pass up to the <HI>Altar,</HI> (preceeded by the Kings) bearing it with the lower end of the Staff foremost, and at the first <HI>Haut-Pas</HI> make another double Reverence. The <HI>Provincial Kings</HI> being arrived at the uppermost <HI>Haut-Pas,</HI> after an humble Obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sance, divide themselves to make way for the Knights to Offer, who forthwith raise the Point of the <HI>Banner</HI> upwards, and after a single Reve∣rence toward the <HI>Altar,</HI> pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent it upon their Knees, to the Prelate of the <HI>Order,</HI> who delivers it to two Canons, and they deposite it upon Cus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions laid before the <HI>Altar.</HI> This done, the two <HI>Provincial Kings</HI> conduct the Knights back into the <HI>Choir,</HI> who, with the usual Reverences, re∣tire to their Stations, under (not to) their Stalls, and the <HI>Provincial Kings</HI> to their, on either side the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>Next the two <HI>Senior Heralds</HI> pass down into the <HI>Choir,</HI> as the <HI>Provincial Kings</HI> did, whilst <HI>Garter,</HI> taking up the Sword, presents it to the two next <HI>Senior</HI> Knights, who proceed to the <HI>Altar</HI> with the two <HI>Heralds</HI> before them, in the same Order as before, bearing the Sword between them, and offer the same with the Pommel or Hilt up∣wards, and then retire as before.</P>
<P>In the next place, the two next <HI>Senior Heralds</HI> go down as before, and the <HI>Helm</HI> and <HI>Crest</HI> is offered in the like manner: But the <HI>Pursuivants</HI> at <HI>Arms</HI> do no part of this Duty.</P>
<P>Heretofore we find that <HI>Garter</HI> has not only begun this Solemnity, by presenting the <HI>Banner,</HI> but has also con∣ducted the two <HI>Senior</HI> Knights to the <HI>Altar,</HI> as he did 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> by the <HI>Banner</HI> of the Lord <HI>Grey;</HI> and at some other times. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as likewise the usage heretofore for the Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate to deliver the offered Atchievements, to some of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alds,</HI> to be deposited near the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing on this farther observable, than what rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes to the Atchievement it self, which, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey became by this Ceremony part of the Goods of the Chappel, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded within the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the College, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sovereig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anted to the Dean and Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns all Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, they could not be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld or alienated, and were therefore dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sited by them in the <HI>Chapter-House:</HI> But the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elms</HI> and <HI>Swords,</HI> because they were at first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Service of War, of an ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raordinary large size, have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>equently red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med, that they might serve

again to the same uses. And likewise, because it belongs to <HI>Garter</HI> to provide Atchievements for new installed Knights, he usually hath compounded with the Dean and Canons for the defunct Knight's Atchievements.</P>

<P>§ 4. In 9 <HI>Eliz.</HI> there passed a Decree, <HI>That the</HI> Knight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Companions <HI>should be bound by their Oaths, to take care, by their last Will, that after their Decease, all their Orna∣ments, which they had receiv'd, should be restored, the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bes to the College, and the Jewels to the King that gave them.</HI> Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton</HI> complied with the Decree, and sent his <HI>Mantle</HI> accordingly; but that of Sir <HI>Henry Lea,</HI> being left to the disposal of others, and not sent to the College, happened at length to come into the Hands of Brokers, and was openly exposed to Sale in <HI>Long-lane,</HI> to the great dishonour of the <HI>Order.</HI></P>
<P>This Decree was in after times but slackly observed, and therefore in a <HI>Chapter</HI> held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> 4 <HI>Car.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Knights were admonished, <HI>That when the Sovereign should vouchsafe to bestow the</HI> Mantle <HI>of the</HI> Order, <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Knight should take care at his Death, to have it sent to the Chappel at</HI> Windsor, according to the <HI>Statutes.</HI> But this taking little Effect, the Sovereign thought fit to restore vigorously the Law in this particular, by a Decree in <HI>Chapter,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> I. which obliged all <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> receiving the Ensigns of the <HI>Order</HI> from the Sovereign, to take care, according to the tenor of their Oaths, that these<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together with the Book of <HI>Statutes,</HI> should be restored in the Hands of the Sovereign, after their Deaths; and a Command was therewithal given, <HI>That certain</HI> Books<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mantles, <HI>and</HI> Surcoats, <HI>then lying at</HI> White-Hall, <HI>shou'd be delivered to the</HI> Register <HI>of the</HI> Order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>to be laid up at</HI> Windsor, <HI>in honourable Memory of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to whom they be∣longed.</HI></P>
<P>In Observation of these Decrees, where the <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Ensigns</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> were either wholly, or in part, be∣stowed by the Sovereign. Order was taken, at the De∣cease of such <HI>Knights-Companions,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end for them in again.

<HI>George</HI> of the Lord Treasurer <HI>Weston</HI> being sent back, were presented to the Sovereign; and after delivered to the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Windsor,</HI> to be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>served: And in the same <HI>Chapter</HI> it was ordered, that the Earl of <HI>Kelly</HI>'s Robes and Ornaments of the <HI>Order,</HI> should be sent for by the Chancellor.</P>
<P>These former Decrees were yet thought needful to be confirm'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. so that in a <HI>Chapter</HI> held 1669. at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> it was Decreed, <HI>That the Mantle of each</HI> Knight Companion, <HI>with the Book of</HI> Statutes, should be sent to <HI>Windsor,</HI> immediately after their Deaths; <HI>and that the Chancellor of the</HI> Order <HI>should be obliged, by Let∣ters to their Heirs and Executors, to put them in mind of sending them thither.</HI> But it is to be understood, that where the Mantle has been provided at the Knight's own Charge, there is no obligation for returning them.</P>
<P>Thus I have run through all the Particulars, relating to the Institutions, Laws, and Ceremonies, of this most No∣ble <HI>Order;</HI> I shall in the last Place proceed to give a List of all those who have enjoyed this singular Mark of Ho∣nour from its first Foundation. The Motives which ex∣cited the Royal Founder to set on Foot the said <HI>Order,</HI> are already particularly treated of; who having esta∣blished <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Statutes</HI> for the Government, and regu∣lation thereof, he next resolved to elect, from among the Flower of his own Wars, twen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y five of the most cele∣brated Knights, who, together with himself, should make up the Number of Twenty six; for of so many does the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der</HI> by his Appointment consist: And indeed that Age plentifully furnished him with Men of the most brave and celebrated Characters, and of signal Reputation in Arms, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed by the eminent Wars of those times, and justly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>nguished by their own heroick Actions.</P>
<P>The first that he elected into this Noble <HI>Order,</HI> was <HI>Edward,</HI> his eldest Son, who already in part deserved, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d afterwards justly obtained the Title of a Brave and Martial Prince, of whom our Histories speak so largel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
