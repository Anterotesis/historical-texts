<HEAD>TO
EDWARD GIBBON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO performance is, in my
opinion, more contempt∣ible,
than a Dedication of the
common sort; when some great
man is presented with a book,
which, if Science be the subject,
he is incapable of understand∣ing;
if polite Literature, inca∣pable
of tasting: and this ho∣nor
<PB REF="3"/>
is done him, as a reward
for virtues, which he neither
does, nor desires to, possess.
I know but two kinds of dedi∣cations,
which can do honor
either to the patron or author.
The first is, when an unexpe∣rienced
writer addresses himself
to a master of the art, in which
he endeavours to excel; whose
example he is ambitious of imi∣tating;
by whose advice he has
been directed, or whose appro∣bation
he is anxious to deserve.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
The other sort is yet more
honourable. It is dictated by
the heart, and offered to some
person who is dear to us, because
he ought to be so. It is an
opportunity we embrace with
pleasure of making public those
sentiments of esteem, of friend∣ship,
of gratitude, or of all to∣gether,
which we really feel, and
which therefore we desire should
be known.</P>
<P>I hope, dear Sir, my past
conduct will easily lead you
<PB REF="5"/>
to discover to what principle
you should attribute this epistle,
which, if it surprizes, will, I
hope, not displease you. If I
am capable of producing any
thing worthy the attention of
the public, it is to you that I
owe it; to that truly paternal
care, which, from the first dawn∣ings
of my reason, has always
watched over my education, and
afforded me every opportunity
of Improvement. Permit me
here to express my grateful sense
<PB REF="6"/>
of your tenderness to me, and to
assure you, that the study of my
whole life shall be to acquit my∣self,
in some measure, of obli∣gations
I can never fully repay.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am,
dear Sir,
with the sincerest
affection and regard,
your most dutiful son,
and faithful servant,

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON THE
Study of Literature.</HEAD>
<P>I. THE history of empires is that
of the miseries of humankind:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idea of li∣terary His∣tory.</NOTE>
the history of the sciences is that of their
splendour and happiness. If a thousand
other considerations render the study of
the latter interesting to the philosopher,
this reflection alone is sufficient to recom∣mend
it to every friend of mankind.</P>
<P>II. How ardently do I wish a truth so
consolatory admitted of no exception!
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
But alas! the man too often intrudes on
the retirement of the student: and hence
even in his closet, that asylum of contem∣plative
wisdom, he is still misled by his
prejudices, agitated by his passions, or de∣based
by his follies.</P>
<P>The influence of fashion is founded
on the inconstancy of man; the causes of
its despotism being as frivolous as the
effects of its tyranny are fatal. Men of
letters are nevertheless afraid to cast off
its yoke, and, tho' reflection causes some
delay in their submission, it serves to ren∣der
it but the more disgraceful.</P>
<P>All ages and countries have given a
preference, not seldom unjustly, to some
particular science, while they permitted
others to languish and sink into a con∣tempt
equally unreasonable. Thus Logic
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
and Metaphysics under the successors of
Alexander<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This age was that of those philosophical sects, who battled for the systems of their respective mas∣ters, with all the obstinacy of polemical divines.</P>
<P>A fondness for systems necessarily produces an at∣tachment to general principles, and this of course brings on a contempt for an attention to parti∣culars.</P>
<P><Q>The fondness for systems (says Mr. Freret) which possessed the successors of Aristotle, made the Greeks abandon the study of nature, and stopped the progress of their philosophical dis∣coveries. Subtlety of argument took place of experiment; the accurate sciences, Geometry, Astronomy, and the true Philosophy disappeared almost entirely. None gave themselves the trouble to acquire new principles; but all were employed in ranging, combining, and modelling those, they imagined they knew, into systems. Hence arose so many different sects. The great∣est geniuses lost themselves in the abstruseness and obscurity of Metaphysics, wherein words gene∣rally supplied the place of things; and thus Lo∣gic, denominated by Aristotle an implement of the understanding, became among his followers the principal, and almost the sole, object of their attention. Their whole lives were spent in studying the art of reasoning, without ever reasoning at all; or at least without reasoning on any other than trivial and unimportant subjects.</Q></P>
<P>Mem. de l'Acad, des B. L. tom. vi. p. 150.</P></NOTE>, Polity and Elocution during
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
the Roman republic, History and Poetry
in the Augustan age, Grammar and Juris∣prudence
in that of the Lower Empire, the
Scholastic Philosophy in the thirteenth cen∣tury,
and the Belles Lettres, till within
the times of our fathers, have all in their
turns shared the admiration and contempt
of mankind.</P>
<P>Natural Philosophy and the Mathema∣tics
are now in possession of the throne:
their sister sciences fall prostrate before
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
them; are ignominiously chained to their
car, or otherwise servilely employed to
adorn their triumph. Perhaps their reign
too is short, and their fall approaching.</P>
<P>It would be a task worthy a man of
abilities, to trace that revolution in reli∣gion,
government and manners, that hath
successively bewildered, wasted, and cor∣rupted
mankind. It were prudent for
him therein not to seek hypotheses, but
much more so not to avoid them.</P>
<P>III. If the Greeks had never been re∣duced
to slavery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Restora∣tion of the Belles Lettres.</NOTE> the Romans had been
still barbarians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pub∣lic taste for them.</NOTE> Constantinople falling be∣fore
the sword of Mahomet, the Muses
were abandoned to fortune, till assembled
and patronized by the Medici. This illus∣trious
family encouraged Literature. Eras∣mus
did still more; he cultivated letters
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
himself, while Homer and Cicero became
familiar to climes unknown to Alexander,
and Nations unconquered by Rome. In
those days it was thought a fine accom∣plishment
to study and admire the An∣cients
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By turning over the Latin Bibliotheque of Fa∣bricius, the best of mere compilers, we shall see that in the space of forty years after the invention of printing, almost all the Latin authors issued from the press, some of them more than once. It is true, the taste of the editors was by no means equal to their zeal. The writers of the Augustan history appeared before Livy; and an edition of Aulus-Gellius was given before any body thought of Virgil.</NOTE>; in ours, it is judged more easy
and polite to neglect and despise them.
I am apt to think there is some reason on
both sides. The soldier then read them in
his tent; the statesman studied them in
his closet. Even the fair sex, usually con∣tent
with the empire of the graces, and
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
willing to resign superior knowledge to
ours, were subject to the contagion; and
every Delia wished to find a Tibullus in
the person of her lover. It was from He∣rodotus
that Elizabeth (a sovereign whose
name is revered in the annals of Litera∣ture)
learnt to maintain the rights of hu∣manity
against another Xerxes. It was in
Aeschylus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aeschylus has written a tragedy, wherein he has painted, in the most lively colours, the triumph of the Greeks and the consternation of the Persians, af∣ter that fatal battle. See le Theatre des Grecs du P. Brumoy, tom. ii. p. 171, &amp;c.</NOTE> she saw her magnanimity cele∣brated
under the names of the victori∣ous
heroes of Salamis.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The president Henault, in speaking of that Princess, says, <Q>She was a great scholar: and that, being one day in conversation with Calignon, afterwards Chancellor of Navarre, she shewed him a Latin translation she had made of some trage∣dies of Sophocles, and of two orations of De∣mosthenes. She permitted him also to take a copy of a Greek epigram of her own composition; and asked his opinion concerning some passages of Lycophron, which she had then in her hands, and from which she intended to translate some par∣ticular parts.</Q></P>
<P>Abreg. Chronolog. 4to. Paris, 1752. p. 397.</P></NOTE> Christina pre∣ferred
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
knowlege to the government of a
kingdom; for which the politician may
despise, and the philosopher will proba∣bly
blame her. The man of letters, how∣ever,
cannot fail to cherish the memory
of that Princess, who not only studied the
Ancients herself, but even rewarded their
commentators. It was by her that Sau∣maise
was honoured with marks of dis∣tinction;
who, tho' he did not deserve the
admiration in which his cotemporaries held
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
him, was above that contempt thrown
upon him by his successors.</P>
<P>IV. This Princess,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That taste carried too far.</NOTE> without doubt, car∣ried
her regard for such writers too far.
For my part, tho' sometimes their advo∣cate,
never their partisan, I will freely con∣fess
I think them as coarse in their manners,
as they were minute and trifling in their
works. A pedantic erudition cramping the
efforts of their imagination, they were rather
dull compilers than ingenious Scholiasts.
The age was just enlightened enough to per∣ceive
the utility of their researches, but nei∣ther
sensible, nor polished sufficiently to
know what advantages they might have
reaped, by the light of Philosophy.</P>
<P>V. At length the day appeared.<NOTE PLACE="marg">When it became more rea∣sonable.</NOTE> Des∣cartes
indeed was not eminent in letters:
polite literature however is extremely ob∣liged
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
to him. An acute philosopher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Le Clerc, in his excellent treatise on the art of criticism, and in many other of his works.</NOTE>,
who inherited his manner, investigated the
true elements of criticism. Bossu, Boi∣leau,
Rapin and Brumoy informed the
public also of the value of those treasures
it had in its possession. One of those so∣cieties,
that have better immortalized the
name of Lewis XIV. than all the per∣nicious
triumphs of his ambition, had
already begun its researches; societies, in
which we see erudition, precision of sen∣timent
and politeness united; in which
we meet with so many important disco∣veries,
and sometimes, what hardly yields
to discoveries, a modest and learned igno∣rance.</P>
<P>If men employed their reason as much
in their actions as in their conversation,
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
the Belles-Lettres would not only engage
the esteem of the wise, but become equal∣ly
the object of vulgar admiration.</P>
<P>VI. It is from this aera we may date
the commencement of their decline.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de∣cline of the Belles Lettres.</NOTE> Le
Clerc, to whom both freedom and science
are indebted, complained of it above sixty
years ago. But it was in the famous dis∣pute,
concerning the ancients and the mo∣derns,
that Letters received the mortal
blow. Never sure was carried on so un∣equal
a combat! The strict logic of
Terasson; the refined philosophy of Fon∣tenelle;
the elegant and happy manner of
De la Motte; the sprightly raillery of St.
Hyacinthe; all joined in concert to re∣duce
Homer to a level with Chapelain.
The adversaries of this formidable band
answered them only by an attention to
trifles; with I know not what pretensions
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
to natural superiority in the ancients; with
prejudice, abuse and quotations. The
laugh was entirely against them; while
the ancients, who were the subject of the
dispute, came in for a share of the ridi∣cule
that burst on their defenders: that
agreeable nation, which had unthinking∣ly
adopted the principle of Lord Shaftes∣bury,
not making any distinction between
the False and the Ridiculous.</P>
<P>Our Philosophers have ever since affect∣ed
to be astonished, that men can pass
their whole lives, in acquiring the know∣lege
of mere words and facts, in bur∣thening
the memory without improving
the understanding. At the same time,
our men of wit are sufficiently sensible of
the advantages they derive from the ig∣norance
of their readers, and therefore
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
load the ancients with contempt, as well
as those who make them their study<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Fontenelle in his digression concerning the an∣cients and moderns, and elsewhere.</P>
<P>Ouvres de Gresset. tom. ii. p. 45.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>VII. To this picture let me subjoin a
few reflections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greatmen men of letters.</NOTE> which may fix a just esti∣mation
on the Belles Lettres.</P>
<P>The examples of great men prove no∣thing.
Cassini, before he acquired a
name for his astronomical discoveries, had
busied himself with judicial astrology<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Fontenelle dans son Eloge.</P>
<P>Voltaire, tom. xvii. p. 79.</P></NOTE>.
When such examples, however, are nu∣merous,
they prejudice the mind in fa∣vour
of an enquiry, the event of which
they serv <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fterwards to confirm. One
must immediately conceive that a mind
capable of thinking for itself, a lively and
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
brilliant imagination, can never relish a
science that depends solely on the memo∣ry.
Yet of those whose superior talents
have successively instructed mankind, ma∣ny
have applied themselves entirely to
the study of the Belles Lettres; still more
have encouraged and in a less degree cul∣tivated
them; but not one, at least hard∣ly
one, of them all, ever held them in
contempt. All antiquity was known to
Grotius; a knowledge that enabled him
to unfold the Sacred Oracles, to combat
ignorance and superstition, to soften the
calamities and mitigate the horrors of
war.</P>
<P>If Descartes, devoted entirely to his
Philosophy, despised every kind of study
that had not an immediate affinity with
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
it, Newton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newton discovered mistakes of 5 or 6 hundred years in the common Chronology and reformed it accordingly. See my critical remarks on that Chro∣nology.</NOTE> did not disdain to form a
system of Chronology which has had both
its advocates and admirers: Gassendi, the
greatest Philosopher among the men of
letters, and the greatest man of letters
among the Philosophers, not only defend∣ed
the doctrines of Epicurus, but critical∣ly
explained his writings: Leibnitz laid
aside his profound researches into history,
to employ himself in the more abstruse
researches of the Mathematics. Had his
edition of the Capella appeared, his ex∣ample
alone in that valuable acquisition
to the literary world, had justified the con∣duct
of all those who apply themselves to
letters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the life of Leibnitz, by de Neufville, pre∣fixed to his Theodocea.</NOTE>. An eternal monument exists,
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
however, of the united efforts of erudi∣tion
and genius, in the Dictionary of Mr.
Bayle.</P>
<P>VIII. If we confine ourselves to such
as have devoted almost all their time and
study to literature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men of letters great men.</NOTE> the reader of taste
will always know how to distinguish the
subtle and extensive wit of Erasmus; the
accuracy of Casaubon and Gerard Vossius;
the readiness of Justus-Lipsius; the taste
and delicacy of Taneguy-le-Febvre; the
resources and fertility of Isaac Vossius; the
daring penetration of Bentley; the agree∣able
manner of Massieu and de Fraguier;
the solid and ingenious criticism of Sallier;
and the profound philosophical genius of
Le Clerc and Freret. He will never con∣found
these truly-great men with such mere
compilers as Gruter, Saumaise, Masson,
and many others, whose works, tho' not
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
altogether useless, seldom gratify taste, ne∣ver
excite admiration, and in general only
lay claim to the lowest kind of approba∣tion.</P>
<P>IX. The ancients have left models for
such writers as dare to copy after them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TASTE. Three sources of beauty.</NOTE>
and lectures to others, from which they may
deduce the principles of true taste, and
learn to employ their leisure in the study
of those valuable productions, wherein
truth appears embellished with all the
graces of the imagination.</P>
<P>It is the province of Poets and Orators
to paint the beauties of nature. The whole
universe supplies them with tints: of that
infinite variety, however, which on every
side presents itself, the images they em∣ploy
may be ranged in three classes; those
relating to man, to nature, and to art. The
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
images of the first class, or those which
compose the picture of man, his great∣ness,
his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anness, his passions, his ca∣prices;
these are they which conduct the
writer in the surest path to immortality.
Every time one reads Euripides or Te∣rence,
one discovers new beauties. It is
not, however, to the disposition or con∣duct
of their performances, which are in
this respect often defective; nor is it to
their delicacy or simplicity of stile, that
these Poets owe their reputation. No,
the heart beholds the picture of itself in
their just and lively descriptions, and con∣fesses
it with pleasure.</P>
<P>Nature, vast and extensive as it is, hath
furnished the Poets with but few images.
Confined by the nature of the object,
or the prejudices of mankind, to the ex∣terior
of things, they have succeeded only
in painting the successive variety of the
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
seasons; a sea agitated by storms; the Ze∣phyrs,
wafting love and pleasure on the
breeze, and the like. A few writers of
genius were enow to exhaust these images.</P>
<P>X. Those of art remained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial images.</NOTE> By the
images of art I mean all those things,
by which men have embellished, defaced,
or diversified nature, religion, laws or cus∣tom.
The Poets have universally made
free with all these, and it must be owned
they were in the right. Their fellow-coun∣trymen
understood them with ease, and
perused them with pleasure. They were
pleased to see the genius of their great
men exercised on things which had made
their ancestors respectable, on subjects they
revered as sacred, or practised as useful.</P>
<P>XI. The manners of the ancients were
more favourable to Poetry than ours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ners of the ancients favourable to poetry.</NOTE>
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
which is a strong presumption they surpas∣sed
us in that sublime art.</P>
<P>In proportion as the arts grew more
perfect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the mi∣litary art.</NOTE> they grew less complex; in war,
in politics, in religion, the most import∣ant
effects have proceeded from the most
simple causes.</P>
<P>Doubtless a Marshal Saxe and a Duke
of Cumberland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I did not here seek for an opportunity of pay∣ing a compliment to his Royal Highness, the Duke of Cumberland, whose birth and rank I respect, without presuming to judge of his military talents. If it be considered that the following lines are taken from a poem on the battle of Fontenoy, the reader will see, it is rather Mr. Voltaire than myself that here speaks.</NOTE> understood the art of
war better than an Achilles or an Ajax:</P>
<Q><PB N="21" REF="27"/>
<L>"Tels ne parurent point aux rives du Sca∣mandre,</L>
<L>"Sous ces murs tant vantés que Pyrrhus mit en cendre,</L>
<L>"Ces antiques héros qui montés sur un Char</L>
<L>"Combattoient en disordre &amp; marchoient au hazard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Voltaire, tom. ii. p. 300.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>Are the battles, however, which are de∣scribed
by the French Poet, diversified like
those of the Greek? Are his heroes equal∣ly
interesting? The single combats of the
chiefs, the long conversations held with
the dying, the unexpected rencounters
we meet with; all betray the imperfection
of the military art; but furnish the Poet
with the means of making us acquainted
with his heroes, and interesting us in their
good or ill fortune. At present, armies
are vast machines animated by the breath
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
of their General. The muse denies her
assistance in the description of their evo∣lutions:
she is afraid to penetrate the
clouds of powder and smoke, that conceal
from her sight alike the coward and the
brave, the private centinel and the com∣mander
in chief.</P>
<P>XII. The ancient republics of Greece
were ignorant of the first principles of good
policy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In govern∣ment.</NOTE> The people met in tumultuous
assemblies rather to determine than to de∣liberate.
Their factions were impetuous
and lasting; their insurrections frequent
and terrible; their most peaceful hours full
of distrust, envy and confusion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Thucydides, book iii. also Diodorus Siculus, from the xith book to the xxth, almost throughout. Also the Preface of the Abbé Terasson to the 3d vol. of his translation of Diodorus Siculus—Also Hume's Political Essays.</NOTE>: The ci∣tizens
were indeed unhappy; but their
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
writers, whose imaginations were warmed
by such dreadful objects, described them
naturally as they were felt. A peace∣able
administration of the laws; those sa∣lutary
institutions, which, projected in the
cabinet of a Sovereign or his council, dif∣fuse
happiness over a whole nation, excite
only the Poet's admiration, the coldest of
all the passions.</P>
<P>XIII. The ancient mythology,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In reli∣gion.</NOTE> which
attributed life and intelligence to all nature,
extended its influence to the pen of the
Poet. Inspired by the muse, he sung the
attributes, the adventures and misfortunes
of his fabulous deities. That Infinite Be∣ing,
which religion and philosophy have
made known to us, is above such descrip∣tion:
the sublimest flights become puerile
on such a subject. The almighty <HI>Fiat</HI> of
Moses strikes us with admiration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the pieces of Huet and Despreaux, in the 3d vol. of the works of the latter.</NOTE>; but
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
reason cannot comprehend, nor imagina∣tion
describe, the operations of a deity,
at whose command alone millions of
worlds are made to tremble: nor can we
read with any satisfactory pleasure of the
devil, in Milton, warring for two whole
days in heaven against the armies of the
Omnipotent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The golden compasses, with which the Creator, in Milton, measures the universe, excite surprize. Perhaps, however, it is puerile in him; tho' such an image had been truly sublime in Homer. Our philosophical ideas of the Deity are injurious to the Poet. The same attributes debase our Divinity which would have extolled the Jupiter of the Greeks. The sublime genius of Milton was cramped by the system of our religion, and never appeared to so great an advantage as when he shook it a little off; while on the contrary, Propertius, a cold and insipid declaimer, owes all his reputation to the agreeable pictures of his Mythology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31"/>
The ancients knew their advantages, and
profited by them accordingly. Of this
the masterly performances we still admire
are the best proofs.</P>
<P>XIV. But we,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The means of perceiving their beau∣ties.</NOTE> who are placed in another
clime, and born in another age, are necessa∣rily
at a loss to see those beauties, for want
of being able to place ourselves in the same
point of view with the Greeks and Ro∣mans.
A circumstantial knowlege of their
situation and manners can only enable us
to do this. The superficial ideas, the poor
information we glean from a commentary,
assist us only to seize the more palpable
and apparent beauties: all the graces, all
the delicacies of their writings escape us;
and we are apt to abuse their contempo∣raries
for want of taste, in lavishing such
encomiums on those merits we are too ig∣norant
to discover. An acquaintance with
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
antiquity is the only true comment on the
writings of the ancients: but what is still
more necessary, is a certain turn of mind,
which is generally the result of it; a sen∣timent
not only making things known,
but familiarizing them to our ideas, and
inducing us to regard them with the eyes
of ancients. The famous example of Per∣rault
may serve to illustrate my meaning.
The rudeness of the heroic ages shocked
the delicacy of the Parisian. It was in vain
that Boileau remonstrated to him, that
Homer designed and ought to describe
Greeks and not Frenchmen: his judgment
was convinced it was right, but he could
not be persuaded to be pleased<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Despreaux's remarks on Longinus.</NOTE>. A small
portion of antique taste, if I may so call
it, would have done more than all the
reasonings of his antagonist.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33"/>
XV. I have said that the Poets were
in the right to make use of artificial ima∣ges;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial images depend on love of fame.</NOTE>
but I know not whether at the tri∣bunal
of fame it will be allowed me. We
are all fond of reputation; but nothing is
more different than the nature and de∣gree
of our passion for fame. Every man
has different notions in his desire of re∣putation.
One writer, for instance, seeks
only the praise of his contemporaries. Death
puts an end to his hopes and fears of cen∣sure
or applause; he cares not, if in the
tomb that encloses his body be buried also
his name. Such a man may, without
scruple, employ familiar and temporary
images, in writing for those whom only
he desires to please. Another, on the
contrary, bequeaths his name to latest pos∣terity
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mallet's life of Bacon, p. 27.</NOTE>; and pleases himself in thinking
that a thousand years after his death, the
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
Indian on the banks of the Ganges, and
the Laplander on his hills of snow, will
read his works, and envy the happy clime
and aera that produced so extraordinary a
genius.</P>
<P>These who are ambitious to please uni∣versally,
must deduce their images from
the common resources of mankind, from
the human heart and the representations
of nature. Pride only can induce writers
to exceed these bounds. They may pre∣sume,
indeed, that the occult beauties of
their writings will always secure a family of
Burmans, to labour in their explication,
and to admire the text the more because
they themselves have written the comment.</P>
<P>XVI. It is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And on the nature of the subject.</NOTE> however, the charac∣ter
of the author altogether, but that of
his work, which influences him in this
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
particular. The sublimer species of Poe∣try,
the epopeia, the tragedy, the ode,
seldom employ the same images as come∣dy
and satire; because the former are
chiefly descriptive of the passions, and the
latter of manners. Horace and Plautus
are almost unintelligible to those who have
not learnt to live and think as the Ro∣mans.
The rival of the latter, the ele∣gant
Terence, is better understood, be∣cause
he has sacrificed pleasantry to taste;
whereas Plautus has even prostituted de∣cency

It is impossible to comprehend the
design, the art, the circumstantial beauties
of Virgil, without a perfect knowlege of
the history, the government, and the reli∣gion
of the Romans; of the geography of
ancient Italy; the character of Augustus;
and of that particular and singular rela∣tion
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
he bore to the senate and the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Dissertations of Mr. de la Bleterie on the authority of the Emperors, in the Memoirs of the academy of the Belles-Lettres. Vol. xix. p. 357. Vol. xxi. p. 299, &amp;c. Vol. xxiv. p. 261, &amp;c. p. 297, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
Nothing could be more striking, or inter∣esting
to this people, than the contrast
between Rome, with its three thousand
citizens living in hovels thatched with
straw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Varro de lingua Latina, lib. iv.—Dionysius Ha∣licarnas. lib. xi. p. 76. Plutarch. in Rom.</NOTE>, and the same Rome the metro∣polis
of the universe, whose houses were
palaces, whose citizens Princes, and whose
provinces were extensive empires. As
Florus has remarked this contrast, it is
not to be thought Virgil was regardless
of it. He has struck it off in a most mas∣terly
manner. Evander conducts his guest
thro' that village, where every thing, even
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
its monarch, was all rusticity. He ex∣plains
its antiquities; while the Poet gives
artfully to understand for whom this vil∣lage,
this future capitol, concealed beneath
tufts and briars, was reserved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Virgil. Aeneid. lib. viii. ver. 185 to 370.

how expressive is this to a man ver∣sed

taste for letters, and a knowlege of the lan∣guage.</P>
<P>XVIII. The better one is acquainted
with antiquity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad∣dress of Virgil.</NOTE> the more one admires the
art and address of the Poet. His subject,
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
it must be confessed, was flat enough.
The flight of a band of refugees; their
squabbles with a few villagers, and the
settling of a paltry town; these were the
boasted labours, the great exploits of the
pious Aeneas. But the Poet has dignified
them, and in so doing has had art enough
to render them interesting. By an illu∣sion,
too refined not to have escaped the
generality of readers, and too excellent to
displease the critic, he hath embellished
the rude manners of the heroic ages, but
has done it without disguising them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing is more difficult for a writer, educated in scenes of luxury, than to describe simplicity with∣out meanness. Read the epistle of Penelope, in Ovid, and you will be disgusted with that rusticity which gives so much delight, in Homer. In the writings of Madam Scudery, you will be as disagreeably sur∣prized to find, in the court of Tomyris, the splen∣dour of that of Louis the XIVth. One must be form∣ed for such manners to hit off their genuine simpli∣city. Reflection has supplied the place of experi∣ence in Virgil, and perhaps in Fenelon. They knew it was necessary to elevate them a little, in conformity to the delicacy of their age and country; but they knew that delicacy would be shocked at too taudry embellishments.</NOTE>.
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
The herdsman Latinus, and the quarrel∣some
Turnus, are indeed elevated into
great monarchs. All Italy trembles for
the cause of liberty: and Aeneas triumphs
over gods and men. Virgil knew how to
reflect all the glory of the Romans on their
Trojan ancestors. The founder of Rome
eclipses that of Lavinium. It is a fire that
kindles, and presently blazes over the face
of the earth. Aeneas, if I may so venture
to express myself, contained the germe of
all his descendants. When besieged in
his camp, he naturally calls to mind a
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
Caesar and an Alexis. We cannot divide
our admiration between them.</P>
<P>But Virgil never displayed greater ad∣dress
than when, descended with his hero,
to the shades, his imagination seemed at
full liberty. Yet here he neither created
new nor imaginary beings. Romulus and
Brutus, Scipio and Caesar appeared, such
as they had been in life, the admiration or
terrour of Rome.</P>
<P>XIX. One reads the Georgics with that
lively taste the beautiful excites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Georgics.</NOTE> and that
exquisite pleasure the charms of the sub∣ject
naturally inspire, in a susceptible mind.
It is easy to conceive, however, that our
admiration would be increased, by disco∣vering
in the Poet a design equally noble
and elevated, as the execution of it is
highly finished. I constantly draw my
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
examples from Virgil. His fine verses,
and the precepts of his friend Horace,
fixed the standard of taste among the Ro∣mans,
and may serve to convey instruc∣tion
to the most distant posterity. But
to explain my sentiments more clearly,
it is necessary to trace things a little far∣ther.</P>
<P>XX. The Romans first fought for glo∣ry
and for their country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ro∣man vete∣rans.</NOTE> After the siege
of Veiae<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livy, book iv. c. 59, 60.</NOTE> they received some small pay,
and sometimes were recompensed after a
triumph<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Livy, book xxx. c. 45, &amp;c. Arbuthnot's Tables, p. 181, &amp;c.</NOTE>: but they received these as gra∣tuities,
and not as their due. At the end
of every war, the soldiers, becoming ci∣tizens,
retired to their respective huts,
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
and hung up their useless arms, to be re∣sumed
at the first signal.</P>
<P>When Sylla restored the public tran∣quillity,
circumstances were much altered.
Above three hundred thousand men, ac∣customed
to luxury and slaughter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sallust. in Bell. Catilin. p. 22. Edit. Thys.</NOTE>, with∣out
substance, without home, without
principle, required rewards. Had the
dictator paid them in money, according to
the rate afterwards established by Augus∣tus,
it had cost him upwards of thirty-two
millions, of our money<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>This rate allowed 3000 drachmas, or 12000 sesterces to every private foot-soldier,<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Dion.

an expedient, rather dictated by

than the good of the commonwealth: he
distributed the lands among the veterans,
and accordingly forty-seven legions were
immediately dispersed over Italy. Four
and twenty military colonies were thus set∣tled
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livy, lib. lxxxix.—Epitom. Freinsheim. Suppl. lib. lxxxix. c. 34.</NOTE>: ruinous expedient! It could not be
otherwise; for if they were intermixed with
the natives of the soil, they changed their
habitations to find out their old acquaint∣ance;
and if they settled in a body, there
was an army ready disciplined for any se∣ditious
general who would lead them to
the field. These warriours, however, soon
grew tired of an inactive life, and thinking
it beneath them to earn by the sweat of
their brows, what could only cost them a
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
little blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacitus, de Moribus Germanorum, p. 441.</NOTE>, they soon dissipated their
new substance in debaucheries, and, seeing
no prospect of repairing their fortunes but
by a civil war, they readily and powerful∣ly
entered into the designs of Catiline<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sallust. in Bell. Catilin. p. 40. Cicero in Ca∣tilin. Orat. ii.</NOTE>.
Augustus, embarassed in like manner,
followed the same plan, and was justly ap∣prehensive

Still smoked in Italy the ashes of those

Above fifty writers on agriculture had
nevertheless appeared among the Greeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Varro, de re rustica, lib. i. c. 1.</NOTE>.
The tracts also of Cato and Varro were
more certain guides, as well as more cir∣cumstantial
and exact in their precepts,
than could be supposed those of a Poet.
But it was more necessary to inspire the
soldiers with a taste for a country life than
to instruct them in the rudiments of hus∣bandry.
Calculated to this end were his
affecting descriptions of the innocent plea∣sures

his domestic ease. his delightful retreats;

of the busy world!</P>
<P>We may yet discover, in the composi∣tion
of this beautiful piece, some of those
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
lively and unexpected strokes, of those art∣ful
and happy touches, which evince the
talents of Virgil for satire; a species of
writing which superior views and a natu∣ral

cultivating<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Hic petit excidiis urbem, miserosque penates, Ut gemmâ bibat, et Sarrano dormiat ostro.</P>

His Georgics actually produced this ad∣mirable

<P>XXIII. Aristotle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Criticism. An idea of it.</NOTE> who introduced light
amidst the obscurity that clouded the works
both of nature and art, was the father of
criticism. Time, whose justice, slow yet
sure, distinguished at length truth from
errour, hath demolished the statues of the
philosopher, but hath confirmed the deci∣sions
of the critic. Destitute of observa∣tions,
he hath advanced chimeras instead
of facts. Formed in the school of Plato,
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
and by the writings of Homer, Sophocles,
Euripides and Thucidides, he hath drawn
his rules from the nature of things, and a
knowlege of the human heart; illustrating
them by examples from the greatest models
of antiquity.</P>
<P>It is now two thousand years since the
days of Aristotle. The critics have since
improved their art; they are not, how∣ever,
as yet agreed concerning the object
of their pursuit. Le Clerc, Cousin, Des-Maiseaux,
St. Martha<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clerici ars critica, lib. i. c. 1.</NOTE>, have all defined
it differently. For my part, I think eve∣ry
one of them too partial or too positive.
Criticism is, in my opinion, the art of
forming a judgment of writings and writ∣ers;
of what they have said; of what they
have said well, and what they have said
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
truly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historically so; the truth of their evidence, not of their opinions; the latter is in the province of logic rather than of criticism.</NOTE>. Under the first head are compre∣hended
grammar, a knowledge of langua∣ges,
and manuscripts; a capacity of distin∣guishing
supposed from genuine perfor∣mances,
and of restoring the true reading
of corrupted passages. Under the second,
is included the whole theory of elocution
and poesy. The third opens an immense
field, the enquiry into the circumstances
and truth of facts. Thus the whole ge∣neration
of critics may be distinguished
under three kinds, grammarians, rhetori∣cians
and historians. The exclusive pre∣tensions
of the first have not only been
prejudicial to their own endeavours, but
to those of their whole fraternity.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="54"/>
XXIV. All that relates to what men
are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Materials of criti∣cism.</NOTE> or have been; all that creative genius
hath invented; that the understanding
hath considered; together with all which
industry hath collected, are included in the
department of criticism. A clear head, a
fine taste, acute penetration, are all neces∣sary
to form a good critic. Follow the
man of letters into his study, you will see
him surrounded by the literary produc∣tions
of all ages; his library is stocked
with them; and his mind informed with∣out
being overburthened by their perusal.
He looks about him on all sides; nor is
the author, whose writings may have the
most distant relation to the subject of his
thoughts, forgotten: he may happen to
meet there with some accidental and strik∣ing
passage, to confirm the discoveries of
the critic, or stagger his hypotheses. And
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
here ends the business of the scholar. The
superficial reader looks no farther, but ad∣mires
the reading and memory of the com∣mentator;
who is not less the dupe of the
encomium, and mistakes the materials of
building for the edifice itself.</P>
<P>XXV. But the true critic is sensible his
task is only begun.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The task of a critic.</NOTE> He deliberates, com∣pares,
hesitates, and decides. Impartial as
exact, he submits only to reason, or to
authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is to say, authority combined with expe∣rience.</NOTE>, which is reason with regard
to facts. The most respectable names yield
sometimes to the testimony of writers, who
owe all their weight to momentary cir∣cumstances.
The true critic, ready and
fertile in resources, but void of false refine∣ment,
scruples not to sacrifice the most
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
brilliant, the most specious hypotheses to
truth, nor presumes to talk to his masters
in the language of mere conjecture. A
professed advocate for the truth, he seeks
that kind of proof his subject admits of,
and is satisfied. He employs not the des∣perate
scythe of analysis, in gathering those
delicate flowers that shrink and fade at the
least ungentle touch. At the same time,
as little content with insipid admiration,
he searches into the most secret emotions
of the human heart, to discover the causes
of his pleasure or disgust. Diffident and
sensible, he deals not out conjectures as
truths, reasonings for facts, or probabili∣ties
for demonstrations.</P>
<P>XXVI. Geometry has been called a good
species of logic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Criticism good lo∣gic.</NOTE> which has been thought
also a great encomium on that science:
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
as it is certainly more noble to display and
improve the faculties of the human mind
than to trace the limits of the material
universe. But has not criticism also the
same pretensions to logic? It has more:
Geometry is employed only in demonstra∣tions
peculiar to itself: criticism delibe∣rates
between the different degrees of pro∣bability.
It is by comparing these we daily
regulate our actions, and often determine
our future destiny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is the elements of geometry and criticism that are here principally intended.</NOTE>. Let us examine here
some critical probabilities.</P>
<P>XXVII. The present age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contro∣versy on the Ro∣man His∣tory.</NOTE> which ima∣gines
itself destined to introduce change
into every thing, has adopted an histori∣cal
scepticism, as dangerous as it may be
useful. M. de Pouilly, a sprightly and
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
superficial genius, who generally quoted
more than he read, was dubious concern∣ing
the certainty of the five first ages of
Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A clear and precise definition of the certainty in dispute might have abridged the controversy. "It was an historical certainty." This certainty, how∣ever, varies in different ages. Thus, I believe in general in the existence and exploits of Charlemaine; but my assurance thereof is not equal to that I have of the actions of Henry the Fourth.</NOTE>; but, little adapted for such kind
of researches, he readily gave up the point
to the erudition and criticisms of M. Fre∣ret
and the Abbé Sallier<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tom. vi. p. 14. 190.</NOTE>. M. de Beau∣fort
revived this controversy; and the Ro∣man
history has suffered not a little from
the attacks of a writer, who not only knew
to doubt, but to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59"/>
XXVIII. A treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a trea∣ty be∣tween Rome and Carthage.</NOTE> concluded between
the Romans and Carthaginians, became,
in the hands of this author, a most power∣ful
objection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dissertation sur l'incertitude de l'hist. Rom. p. 33—46.</NOTE>. This treaty is found in
Polybius, an historian accurate as sen∣sible
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polyb. Hist. lib. iii. c. 22.</NOTE>. The original was in his time at
Rome. And yet this authentic monument
contradicted all the historians. It ap∣peared
by this, that L. Brutus and M.
Horatius were consuls at the same time;
altho' Horatius was not invested with the
consulship till after the death of Brutus.
Again, a people are therein called Roman
subjects, who were at that time only allies,
and we hear of the marine of a nation
that began to construct ships only in the
time of the first Punic war; two hundred
and fifty years after the consulship of Bru∣tus.
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
What mortifying conclusions might
not be drawn from these contradictions!
How greatly to the disadvantage of the
historians!</P>
<P>XXIX. This objection of Mr. de Beau∣sort
greatly embarrassed his adversaries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This trea∣ty cleared up.</NOTE>
They suspected the authenticity of the pre∣tended
original. They even altered its
date. Let us see, if by a probable expla∣nation,
we cannot reconcile this monu∣ment
with the historians. To do th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s we
shall begin by separating the date from the
body of the treaty. The former agrees
with the time of Brutus: the latter re∣sembles
the manner of Polybius, or that
of his Roman antiquaries But the names
of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consuls were never inserted in their
solemn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in the <HI>foedera</HI> consecrated
by all the ceremonies of their religion.
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
The ministers of that religion, the <HI>feciales,</HI>
only signed them: and in this consisted
the distinction between the <HI>foedera</HI> and the
<HI>sponsiones.</HI> The account of this circum∣stance,
for which we are indebted to Livy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spoponderunt consules, legati, quaestores, tri∣buni militum, nominaque eorum qui spoponderunt adhuc exstant, ubi si ex foedere acta res esset pre∣terquam duorum fecialium nomine extarent.
Tit. Liv. lib. ix. c. 5.</NOTE>,
obviates the difficulty. The antiquaries
mistook the <HI>feciales</HI> for the consuls; and,
without thinking of the mistake, as no∣thing
obliged them to be precise in their
explanation of their public monuments,
they distinguished the year, of the expul∣sion
of their kings, by the celebrated names
of the author of their liberty, and the
founder of the capitol. It little con∣cerned
them, whether they were consuls
at the same time, or not.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62"/>
XXX. The people of Ardea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Roman subjects.</NOTE> Antium
and Terra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inia, were not then subjects of
Rome; at least, if they were, historians
have given us very false ideas of the extent
of that republic. Let us imagine our∣selves
existing in the time of Brutus; and
we shall deduce, from the politics of
the Romans, a definition of the term Ally,
very different from what we should lay
down at present. Rome, altho' the last
colony of the Latins, begun very early to
form the project of subjecting the whole
nation to its laws. Its discipline and po∣lice,
its heroes, its victories, soon mani∣fested
its incontestible superi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity. The
Romans, not le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> politic than bold, made
use of this superiority with a discretion
worthy of their good fortune. They
knew well that cities ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly subjected would
stop the progress of their arms, would
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
waste the treasures, and corrupt the man∣ners
of the republic. Under the more
specious name, therefore, of allies, they
reconciled the vanquished to the yoke of
submission; while the latter consented with
pleasure to acknowlege Rome as the ca∣pital
of the Latin nation, and to furnish it
with a quota of troops in its wars. The
republic, in return, afforded them only
bare protection, the mark of that sove∣reignty
which cost its vassals so dear.
These people were indeed denominated al∣lies
to Rome; but they soon found them∣selves
no better than her slaves.</P>
<P>XXXI. This explication, it may be
said, diminishes the difficulty, but does
not remove it. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the word Poly∣bius
in this place makes use of, taken in
its proper sense, signifies a subject. I will
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
not dispute it. But it must be observed,
we have only a translation of this treaty;
and though we should conditionally admit
the copiests to be depended on, as to the
main substance and tenour of it, their ex∣pressions
ought not to be strictly taken
according to the letter. The association
of our ideas is so extremely arbitrary,
their various shades so indistinct, and lan∣guages
so different and changeable, that
the most able translator may long look
for equivalent expressions, and find at last
none but what are barely similar. The
language of this treaty was antique. Po∣lybius
trusted to the Roman antiquaries;
whose vanity was apt to magnify their
subject. <HI>Foederati,</HI> said they, does not di∣rectly
signify allies, as of people upon an
equal footing, let us render it therefore by
the word subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65"/>
XXXII. Again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ma∣rine.</NOTE> the Roman marine is
an object of no little embarrassment to the
critics. Polybius himself however assures
us, that the fleet of Duillius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polybius, lib. i. c. 20.</NOTE> was their first
essay of this kind. Polybius therefore must
be in one case or the other mistaken, since
he contradicts himself; which is all the
conclusion I shall draw from the matter.
But even admitting the truth of his rela∣tion,
the Roman history does not therefore
fall to the ground. The following hy∣pothesis
affords a probable solution of this
paradox; and that is as much as can be
reasonably expected of an hypothesis. Tar∣quin
oppressed both his subjects and the
army. He seized, and appropriated to
himself, their plunder; which gave them
a disgust to military expeditions. They
fitted out, therefore, small sloops, and
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
went to cruize at sea. The infant repub∣lic
protected them, but, by this treaty,
laid a restraint on their depredations.
The continual wars, in which it was af∣terwards
engaged, and wherein the land
forces were well paid, made this marine ne∣glected;
and, in an age or two, it was even
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it had ever existed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I shall say nothing of the fleet that appeared be∣fore Tarentum; as I imagine those vessels belonged to the inhabitants of Thuricum.</P>
<P>See Frensheim Supplem. Livian. lib. xii. c. 8.</P></NOTE>. Po∣lybius
may have only spoken in too indis∣tinct
and general terms.</P>
<P>XXXIII. It may be further remarked,
that this first marine of the Romans could
be composed only of vessels of no more
than fifty oars. Galen and Hiero construc∣ted
much larger ships<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arbuthnot's Tables, p. 225. Histoire du com∣merce des anciens, par Huet, c. 221.</NOTE>. The Greeks and
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
Carthaginians followed the example; and,
in the first Punic war, the Romans fitted
out vessels of three or four tier of oars, a
circumstance that astonishes the antiquaries
and mechanics to this day. So different
an armament was sufficient to make them
forget their former rude essays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated Mr. Freret has offered a differ∣ent hypothesis, agreeable enough for its simplicity; but it appears to me, not quite so reasonable. See Memoires de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tom. xviii. p. 102, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XXXIV. I have with pleasure under∣taken
the defence of an useful and inter∣esting
history.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflecti∣ons on this dispute.</NOTE> My principal view, how∣ever,
is to shew by these reflections, the
nicety of critical discussions, in which,
the business is not to produce demonstra∣tion,
but to make a comparison between
opposite probabilities; as also to shew how
little confidence ought to be placed in the
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
most specious and dazzling systems, since
there are so few that can bear a free and
attentive examination.</P>
<P>XXXV. A further consideration in∣volves
criticism in a new difficulty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Criticism, tho' prac∣tical, not to be ac∣quired by rote.</NOTE> There
are some sciences which are purely theo∣retical:
their principles consisting only of
speculative truths, and not of practical
maxims. It is more easy barely to com∣prehend
a proposition, than to render it
familiar to one's thoughts, to apply it with
propriety, to make use of it as a guide to
our studies, or as a light to shew us the
way to new discoveries.</P>
<P>The art of criticism is not to be ac∣quired
by rote or practice. Its elements
are just, but of themselves dry and fruit∣less.
The writer who knows these only
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
is equally mistaken, whether he deter∣mines
to follow, or ventures to forsake
them. A great genius, fertile of inven∣tion,
master of critical rules, and at the
same time, of the reasons on which those
rules are founded, will often appear to
hold them very cheap. New and enter∣prising
in his attempts, he will seem to
have thrown off their restraint: but fol∣low
him to the end, and you will always
find him an admirer, tho' not an implicit∣one,
of those rules; and that he always
makes them the basis of his investigations
and discoveries. Would the sciences were
all <HI>legum non hominum respublica,</HI> such
would be the wish of a learned and wise
nation. The accomplishment of that wish
would also constitute its felicity: but it is
too well known that the happiness of a
people, and the glory of those who instruct,
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
or govern them, are different, and some∣times
contrary, objects. Our literary cham∣pions
apply themselves only to studies re∣sembling
the spear of Achilles, adapted to
the arm and strength of heroes. Shall we
try a little how we can manage it?</P>
<P>XXXVI. A legislator in criticism has
pronounced, that the Poet should ever re∣present
his heroes such as we find them
in history.</P>
<Q><L>Aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge</L>
<L>Scriptor; Homerum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bentley and Sanadon, on verse 120, of Ho∣race's Art of Poetry.</NOTE> si forte reponis Achil∣len.</L>

<L>Jura neget sibi nata, nihil non arrogat ar∣mis
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hor. Ars Poet. v. 119, &amp; seq.</NOTE>, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Shall we then reduce the Poet to the
situation of a frigid anna ist? Shall we de∣prive
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
him of that grand resource, inven∣tion,
of the power of contrasting his
characters, and of placing them in those
critical and unexpected situations, in which
we admire the hero, or tremble for the
man? Or shall we not rather, attached to
beauties more than rules, be more ready
to pardon a writer's anachronisms than his
dullness?</P>
<P>XXXVII. To charm, to move, to ele∣vate
the soul, are the great objects of Poe∣try.
Its particular laws, therefore, should
never make us forget they were framed to
aid, and not embarrass, the efforts of ge∣nius.
We have seen Philosophy so envi∣roned
with demonstrations, as hardly to
admit the most obvious of received opini∣ons:
these, however, are the peculiar pro∣vince
of Poetry. We are pleased at tak∣ing
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
a review of the heroes and events of an∣tiquity:
when they are travestied in the
representation, we are struck with surprize;
but it is a surprize that revolts against the
innovation. If a writer has a mind to
risque any thing new, he should reflect
whether the beauties of the alteration, or
novelty, be striking or trivial; whether
they will compensate for that violation of
the rules, which they only can justify.</P>
<P>The anachronisms of Ovid greatly dis∣please
us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In matters of geography and chronology no de∣pendance is to be made on Ovid; that Poet being grossly ignorant in both these sciences. Read the description of the voyages of Medea; Metamorph. lib. vii. v. 350 to 402, and the xivth book of the same Metamorph. The one passage abounds with geo∣graphical errours, that offend even the commenta∣tors; and the other is full of chronological blunders.</NOTE>; as truth is violated without
embellishment. How different is that of
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
Virgil, respecting Mezentius, who dies by
the hand of Ascanius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Serv. ad Virg. Aeneid. lib. iv. v. 620.—Dion. Halicarnass. Antiq. Rom. lib. i.</NOTE>. But what reader
can be so cold and insensible, as to attend
a moment to this circumstance, when he
sees Aeneas, the minister of divine ven∣geance,
become the protector of oppressed
nations, dart the thunder of his rage on
the head of the guilty tyrant, but melt
with pity over the unfortunate victim of
his resentment, the youthful and pious
Lausus, worthy another father and a bet∣ter
fate? Had the Poet been confined to
historical truth, how many beauties had
he not lost! Encouraged by this success,
however, he wanders from it when he
should have pursued it. Aeneas arrives
at the long-wished-for shores of Italy;
the Latins run together to defend their
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
habitations, and every thing denounces a
dreadful and bloody combat.</P>
<Q><L>Déjà de traits en l'air s'élevoit un nuage;</L>
<L>Déjà couloit le sang, premices du carnage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Racin. Iphig. act v. sc. dernier.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>At hearing the name of Aeneas, however,
his enemies threw down their arms. They
were afraid to encounter a warriour, whose
glory took its rise from the ashes of his
country. They ran, with open arms, to
embrace a Prince, whose coming the oracles
had foretold; who brought with him from
Asia, his gods, a race of heroes, and a
promise of universal empire. Latinus of∣fered
him an asylum, and his daughter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Livy, lib. i. c. 1.</NOTE>.
What a subject this for the drama!
How worthy the majesty of the Epopeia
and the pen of Virgil! Let any one, who
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
will venture, compare this with the em∣bassy
of Ilioneus, the description of the
palace of Latinus, and the discourse of
that Monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virg. Aeneid. lib. viii. v. 148.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. The Poet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Explana∣tions and restricti∣ons.</NOTE> I say again,
may safely venture to depart from truth,
provided the reader finds in his fiction,
the same pleasure which truth and consist∣ency
would give him. Not that it is per∣mitted
to subvert the annals of an age for
the sake of introducing an antithesis. Nor
will this rule, I am persuaded, be thought
severe upon the rights of invention, if we
reflect that all mankind are possessed of
some degree of sensibility; but that know∣lege
is the portion only of a few. It is
to be observed also, that beauty of senti∣ment
operates more powerfully on the soul,
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
than that of truth on the understanding.
The writer, however, should always re∣member,
that there are some liberties which
must not be taken. Not even the sublime
imagination of a Milton, joined to the
harmonious versification of a Voltaire,
could ever reconcile the reader to a cow∣ardly
Caesar, a virtuous Catasine, or Hen∣ry
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>th subduing the Romans. In
for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a just association of ideas, the
ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acters of great men should doubtless
be held sacred; but Poets, in writing their
history, may be indulged in giving it us,
rather as it ought to have been, than as it
actually was. Pure invention is less dis∣gusting
than essential alterations, because
the latter seems to infer errour, and the
former only simple ignorance. It is, be∣sides,
much easier to reconcile times than
places.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77"/>
Great indulgence ought certainly to be
given to the ancients, whose chronology
depended, in a great measure, on the
Poets, who modelled it almost as they
pleased. Whoever condemns the episode
of Dido, must have more philosophy or
less taste than I have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may, nevertheless, be doubted, whether this episode is so irreconcileable to chronological truth as has been imagined. According to the plausible system of Sir Isaac Newton, Aeneas and Dido were cotemporaries<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">See Newton's Chronology of ancient kingdoms reformed, p. 32.</NOTE>. The Romans certainly ought to know the History of Carthage better than the Greeks. The archives of Carthage were removed to Rome<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Universal History, vol. xviii. p. 111, 112.</NOTE>. The Punic language was well enough understood there<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Plaut. Penul. act v. sc. 1.</NOTE>. The Romans readily consulted the Afri∣cans concerning their origin<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Sal∣lust. in Bell. Jugurth. c. 17. Ammian. Marcell. lib. xxii. Mem. de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tom. iv. p. 464.</NOTE>. Besides, Virgil adopts a chronology more agreeable to the compu∣tations of a Newton than to those of Eratosthenes, which is of itself a sufficient disculpation. My read∣ers will not be displeased, perhaps, to see the proofs of what is here advanced. Seven years hardly pa∣cified the anger of Juno, and finished the wanderings of Aeneas. At least so Dido informs me.</P>
<Q><L>Nam te jam septima portat</L>

<P>He arrived, some months after, in the Tiber; where the Deity of the stream appeared to him, foretold his future battle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and gave him hopes of a glorious end to his misfortunes. A prodigy confirmed the truth of the oracle. A sow, that had just littered, ap∣peared on the banks of the river, with her thirty pigs; expressive of the number of years before the young Ascanius would lay the foundation of Alba;
<Q><L>Jamque tibi, ne vana putes haec fingere somnum,</L>

<L>Triginta capitum soetus enixa, jacebit;</L>

<Q><L>Hic jam ter centos totos regnabitur annos</L>
<L>Gente sub Hectorea<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">Idem lib. i. v. 272.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>These are the expressions Virgil has put in the mouth of Jupiter. But our chronologists give them∣selves no concern to make the Thunderer keep his word. They represent the city of Alba as destroyed by Tullus Hostilius almost 500 years after its foun∣dation, and about 100 years after that of Rome<NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">See les Tables Chronolog. d'Helvicus.</NOTE>. The system of Sir Isaac Newton, however, makes all easy. The destruction of Troy, placed in the year 904, and followed by an interval of 337 years, brings us down to 567, 60 years after the Palilia, an epoch that agrees much better with the reign of the third successor of Romulus<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot">Newton's Chronology, p. 52, &amp;c.</NOTE>. There is an an∣cient tradition, preserved by Plutarch<NOTE N="(10)" PLACE="foot">See Plutarch. in Numa.</NOTE>, which exactly coincides. The books of Nama were found ann. ante Chr. 181. four hundred years after the death of that King, and the commencement of the reign of Hostilius. Numa died then 581 years be∣fore the Christian aera. How artful was it in the Poet to lay hold of the time Aeneas arrives at Car∣thage, to reply to his critics, in the only manner the rapidity of his course, and the greatness of his sub∣ject would permit him! He makes it appear, that, according to his theory, this rencounter of Dido and Aeneas is not a poetic licence. Virgil is not the only one who hath called in question the vulgar chro∣nology of the Latin Kings. I imagine I can trace the same ideas in his contemporary Pompeius. That historian, the rival of Livy and Sallust<NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot">Flav. Vopisc. in proem. Aurelian.</NOTE>, attributes the same period of duration, 300 years, to the king∣dom of Alba. Had not his universal history been lost, we should probably have there found particular and circumstantial proofs of this opinion. As it is, we must be satisfied with the simple exposition of his abbreviator. "Albam longam condidit quae trecen∣tis annis caput regni fuit<NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot"> Jus∣tin. lib. xliii. c. 1.</NOTE>." Livy himself, that father of Roman history, who sometimes shews so great an attachment to the vulgar chronology, but generally runs over the difficult passages in a manner that betrays his credulity and ignorance, seems to distrust his guides in those early ages<NOTE N="(13)" PLACE="foot">Tit. Liv. lib. i. c. 18. and elsewhere.</NOTE>. Nothing was more natural than for him to take notice how long those Kings reigned, whom he mentions<NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot">Livy, lib. i. c. 9.</NOTE>. Yet is he entirely silent on this head. Nothing was more necessary than to ascertain, at least, the inter∣val between Aeneas and Romulus; which he has not∣withstanding neglected. Nor is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s all. "The de∣struction of Alba, he says, happened 400 years af∣ter it was founded<NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot">Idem. lib. i. c. 29.</NOTE>." In retrenching an 100 years for the reigns of Romulus and of Numa, and for the half of that of Hostilius, there remain just 300, instead of 400, as is given by the chronology of Eratosthenes. Livy therefore nearly agrees with Vir∣gil, the little difference between them serving rather to confirm than dissolve their agreement.—I foresee an objection, but as it is one of the most trivial, to reply to it would be only to form monsters for the sake of subduing them: I shall therefore finish this digression, already too long.</P></NOTE>.</P>

XXXIX. The farther we advance in
the sciences, the more we are convinced
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
of their intimate connection. Their pros∣pect
resembles that of a thick and exten∣sive

There is no study, even the most con∣temptible,
and least cultivated, that doth
not sometimes fall upon facts, strike out
lights, or raise objections closely connected
with the most sublime and distant branches
of science. It is pleasing to dwell on this
consideration. Different people and pro∣fessions
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
ought to be made acquainted with
their reciprocal wants. Display to an Eng∣lishman
the advantages of a Frenchman;
represent to a naturalist the benefits of lite∣rature,
by these means philosophy extends
itself, humanity is a gainer; men hereto∣fore
rivals become brothers.</P>
<P>XL. In all the sciences we depend on
reasonings and facts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con∣nection between physics and lite∣rature.</NOTE> Without the latter,

are miscellaneous: and thus every
branch of natural philosophy, the study
of which, under an apparent meanness,
often hides its real importance, is equal∣ly
so. If Physics hath its buffoons, it
hath also (to speak the language of the
times) its <HI>erudits,</HI> its pedants. The know∣lege

of antiquity presents both to the one
and the other, a plentiful harvest of facts,
proper to display the secrets of nature, or
at least to prevent those, who make them
their study, from embracing a cloud in∣stead

may not a physician draw from the de∣scription

farther, and learns from the miseries of
the Athenians to alleviate those of his
countrymen.</P>
<P>I know the ancients applied themselves
but little to the study of nature; that
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
destitute of instruments, and single in their
experiments, they were able to collect on∣ly
a small number of observations, mixed
with uncertainty, diminished by the inju∣ries

Solitude and silence were by

magnificence, horrour, and wretchedness

<P><PB N="81" REF="87"/>
The construction of palaces, in which
to exhibit the combats of wild beasts,
could be thought of only among a people,
who preferred the decorations and machine∣ry
of a theatre, to the finest verses and
the most exquisite beauties of the dra∣ma
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horat. lib. ii. epist. 1. v. 187.</NOTE>. But such were the Romans: their
virtues, their vices, and even their most
ridiculous amusements were connected with
their ruling passion, the love of their coun∣try.</P>
<P>Those spectacles, nevertheless, so shock∣ing
in the eye of the Philosopher, so fri∣volous
in that of a man of taste, ought to
be valued by the naturalist. Let us ima∣gine
the whole world ransacked to furnish
subjects for these diversions; the treasures
of the Rich, the influence of the Great,
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
all employed to find out creatures remark∣able
for their figure, strength, or rarity;
to bring them into the amphitheatre at
Rome, and there to make a display of the
whole animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Essais de Mont. vol. iii. p. 140.</NOTE>. This must certainly be
an admirable school, particularly for the
study of that noblest branch of natural
history, which applies itself rather to the
nature and properties of animals, than to
the minute description of their bones and
muscles. We must not forget that Pliny
frequented this school, nor that ignorance
hath two daughters, incredulity and im∣plicit
faith. Let us be equally cautious to
defend ourselves against the one and the
other.</P>

<P>Navigation, indeed, hath since disco∣vered
to us another hemisphere; but the
discoveries of the seaman, and the voyages
of the merchant, do not always improve the
world so much as they enrich it. The li∣mits
of the known world are more con∣fined
than the material one, while those of
the enlightened world are still more nar∣row
and contracted. From the times
of its Plinys and Ptolemys, Europe
has been, as at this day, the seat of the
sciences: but Greece, Asia, Syria, Aegypt,
Africa, countries fruitful in the wonders
of nature, then abounded with Philosophers
worthy to regard them. All that vast bo∣dy
of men were united by peace, by the
laws, and by a common language. The
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
African and the Briton, the Spaniard and
the Arabian, met together at the capital,
and mutually instructed each other. Thir∣ty
persons of the first rank in Rome, often
men of science themselves, but always ac∣companied
by such as were<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. xvii. p. 816. Edit. Casaub.</NOTE>, set out eve∣ry
year from that metropolis, to govern

<P>XLIII. It was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the in∣undation of Great Britain by the sea.</NOTE> doubtless, from his fa∣ther-in-law
Agricola, that Tacitus learnt
that the sea, overflowing the island of Bri∣tain,
had rendered it a country of bogs

to science to make good his claim
to this. Press him ever so little, and he
will admit that a nice Judgment must
embarrass the operations of genius: but
he will, notwithstanding, constantly assure
you, that the philosophical spirit, which
breathes throughout his writings, is cha∣racteristical
of the present age. The phi∣losophical
turn and talents of a few great
men, have, according to him, formed the
genius of the age. This influence has ex∣tended
itself over all the different ranks
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
in the state, and has trained up scholars
worthy of such eminent masters.</P>
<P>XLV. If we take a survey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is not.</NOTE> however,
of the works of our Philosophers, their di∣versity
will leave us in great doubt concern∣ing
the nature of this talent; and this may
not unreasonably lead us to doubt also,
whether it has fallen to their lot. With
some it consists in a humour for striking
out into some new path, and for explod∣ing
every established opinion, whether that
of a Socrates, or a Spanish inquisitor, for
no other reason than because it is establish∣ed.
With others again, it is the same
thing as a talent for Geometry, that haugh∣ty
and imperious science, which, not con∣tent
with absolute sovereignty itself, hath
proscribed its sister sciences, and pronoun∣ces
all reasoning unworthy that name,
whose object is not confined to lines and
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
figures. Let us do justice, however, to
that enterprizing spirit, whose errours have
sometimes led the way to truth, and whose
very extravagancies, like the rebellion of
a people, have inspired a salutary indigna∣tion
against arbitrary power. Let us ac∣knowlege
every thing we owe to the ma∣thematics:
but let us at present attend to
the genius of philosophy, an object more
judicious than the former, and less confined
than the latter.</P>
<P>XLVI. Those who are intimately ac∣quainted
with the writings of Cicero,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is.</NOTE> Ta∣citus,
Bacon, Leibnitz, Bayle, Fontenelle,
and Montesquieu, will be able to form a
more just and adequate idea of this talent
than what I shall attempt to describe.</P>
<P>A philosophical genius consists in the
capacity of recurring to the most simple
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
ideas; in discovering and combining the
first principles of things. The possessor of
this distinguishing faculty has a view as
piercing as extensive. Situated on an emi∣nence,
he takes in a wide extensive field,
of which he forms a precise and exact idea;
while a genius of an inferiour cast, tho'
what he sees he distinguishes with equal
precision, is more contracted in his views,
and discovers only a part of the whole.
A philosopher may be a mathematician, a
musician, an antiquary; but in every thing
he is still the philosopher; and, in conse∣quence
of his abilities, to comprehend the
first principles of his art, he rises superi∣our
to every other artist. Placed among
that small number of geniuses, formed for
so arduous a task, he labours to compleat
that elementary science, to which, if once
brought to perfection, every other must
submit. Taken in this sense, a philoso∣phical
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
genius is very uncommon. There
are many men capable of forming particu∣lar
ideas with precision; but there are few
who can comprehend, in one abstract idea,
a numerous association of others, less ge∣neral.</P>
<P>XLVII. Will it be asked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The assist∣ance it may gain from lite∣rature.</NOTE> What study
can form such a genius? I know of none.
It is the gift of heaven, which the greater
part of mankind are ignorant of, or de∣spise;
it is the wish of the wise; some have
received, but not one has acquired, it: I
conceive, however, that the Study of Li∣terature,
the habit of becoming by turns,
a Greek, a Roman, the disciple of Zeno
and of Epicurus, is extremely proper to
exercise its powers and display its merit.
It is remarkable, that, throughout that in∣finite
diversity of geniuses, there is a ge∣neral
conformity of sentiment between
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
those whom their age, country and reli∣gion
have led to take a view of the same
objects, in nearly the same manner. We
see that minds, the most exempt from pre∣judice,
cannot altogether shake it off.
Their ideas have an air of paradox; and
we perceive even by their broken chains,
that they have worn them. It is among
the Greeks that I look for the abettors
of democracy; among the Romans, the
enthusiasts to the love of their country;
among the subjects of Commodus, Severus
and Caracalla, for the apologists for arbi∣trary
power; and among the ancient fol∣lowers
of Epicurus, the enemies of the re∣ligion
of their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epicurus had no sooner published his doctrines, than some people expressed themselves freely on the established religion, and began to regard it only as a political institution.

<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
is it to a genius truly philosophical,
to see the most absurd opinions received
among the most enlightened people; to
see barbarians, on the other hand, arrive
at the knowlege of the most sublime truths;
to find true consequences falsely deduced
from the most erroneous principles; ad∣mirable
principles, bordering on the verge
of truth, without ever conducting thither;
languages formed on ideas, and yet those
ideas corrected by such languages; the
springs of morality universally the same;
the opinions of contentious metaphysics
universally varied, and generally extrava∣gant,
accurate only while superficial, but
subtile, obscure and uncertain whenever
they were profound! A philosophical work
written by an Iroquois, tho' full of ab∣surdities,
would be to us an inestimable
performance. It would present us with a
singular instance of the nature of the hu∣man
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
mind, placed in circumstances we have
never experienced, and influenced by cus∣toms
and religious opinions totally differ∣ent
from ours. Sometimes it would sur∣prize
and instruct us, by the contrariety
of ideas, that would thence necessarily
arise; we should be led to enquire into the
reasons, and trace the mind from errour
to errour: Sometimes, again, we should
see our own principles, but deduced by
different means, and almost always pecu∣liarly
modified and altered. We should
hence learn, not only to acknowlege, but
to feel the force of prejudice; we should
learn never to be surprized at apparent
absurdity, and often to suspect the truth of
what might appear to want no confirma∣tion.</P>
<P>I must own, I like to see the reasonings
of mankind take a tincture from their pre∣judices;
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
to take a view of such as are
afraid to deduce, even from principles they
acknowlege to be just, conclusions which
they know to be logically exact. I like
to detect those who detest in a barbarian
what they admire in a Greek, and who
would call the same history impious if
written by an heathen, and sacred if pen∣ned
by a Jew.</P>
<P>Without a philosophical knowlege of
antiquity, we should be induced to do too
much honour to humankind. The influ∣ence
of custom would be little known.
We should every moment be apt to con∣found
the incredible and the absurd. The
Romans were an enlightened people; and
yet these very Romans were not shocked at
seeing united, in the person of Caesar, a
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
God, a priest, and an atheist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If not in denying the existence, at least in dis∣believing the providence, of the Deity; for Caesar was a follower of Epicurus.

for Pansa and Trebatius, to laugh with him
at the credulity of the vulgar, and at those
deities which were the effect and objects of
their fear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Lucretius, born with that enthusiasm of imagi∣nation, which forms great Poets and enterprizing missionaries, was desirous of being both the one and the other. I must pity the theologue, however, who cannot grant some indulgence to the latter, for the sake of the former. This philosopher, after hav∣ing proved a Divinity in spite of himself, by attri∣buting the phenomena of nature to general causes, proceeds to enquire, how the notion he controverts came to be so universally entertained. For this he discovers three reasons: I. Our dreams; for in these we conceive beings and effects that we never meet with in the material world, and attribute to them a real existence and immense power. II. Our ignorance of the works of nature, which makes us, on every occasion, recur to the hand of a Divinity. III. Our fear, which is the effect of that ignorance: this induces us to submit to the calamities which happen to the earth, and excites us to endeavour to appease, by our prayers, some invisible being that is supposed to afflict us. Lucretius expresses this last motive with an energy and a rapidity of stile which bears all before it, and will not give the reader time to examine its validity.</P>

not been so often mistaken for ingenuity,
obscurity for profundity, or a turn for paradox

<P>XLIX.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules for the choice of facts.</NOTE> Among a multitude of historical
facts, there are some, and those by
much the majority, which prove nothing
more than that they are facts. There are
others which may be useful in drawing a
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
partial conclusion, whereby the philoso∣pher
may be enabled to judge of the mo∣tives
of an action, or some peculiar fea∣tures
in a character: these relate only to
single links of the chain. Those whose
influence extends throughout the whole
system, and which are so intimately con∣nected
as to have given motion to the
springs of action, are very rare; and what
is still more rarely to be met with is, a
genius who knows how to distinguish
them, amidst the vast chaos of events
wherein they are jumbled, and deduce
them, pure and unmixt, from the rest.</P>
<P>It will appear unnecessary to observe to
those, whose judgment is superiour to their
erudition, that causes ought always to be
proportioned to their effects; that it is
wrong to trace the character of an age,
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
from the conduct of an individual; or to
estimate from a single effort, often forced
and destructive, the strength and riches of
a state. It will be needless to put such in
mind, that, it is only by collecting and
comparing facts any judgment is to be de∣duced
from them; that a signal action may
sometimes dazzle like a flash of lightening,
but that we shall be able to gather little
from it, unless we compare it with others
of the same kind. The Romans, in mak∣ing
choice of Cato, shewed they liked bet∣ter
to be corrected than flattered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. xxxix. c. 40. Plut. in Cato.</NOTE>; and
this they did in the same age in which
they condemned the like manly severity in
the person of Livius Salinator<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. xxix. c. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>L.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivial facts, of conse∣quence.</NOTE> It is safer to yield to facts, that of
themselves unite to form a system, than to
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
such as one may discover in consequence
of a pre-conceived hypothesis. Slight cir∣cumstances
are also often more worthy no∣tice
than the most brilliant actions; it being
exactly the same thing with an age, or a
nation, as with the individual. Alexander
displays his character more in the tent of
Darius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quintus Curtius de Reb. Gest. Alexandri, lib. iii. c. 32.</NOTE> than in the field of battle. I dis∣cover
as much the ferocity of the Roman
people in their condemnation of an unhap∣py
criminal, to be torn to pieces in the
amphitheatre, as in their strangling a cap∣tive
King before the capitol. There is no
preparatory disguise to trivial actions. We
undress only when we imagine we are not
seen; but the curious will endeavour to pe∣netrate
the most secret retirement. Should
I undertake to determine, whether virtue
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
prevailed in the character of a certain
age, or people, I should examine into their
actions rather than their discourse. In or∣der
to condemn them as vicious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dif∣ference between virtue and vice.</NOTE> I should
attend rather to their words than their ac∣tions.
Virtue is praised without being
known; known without being felt; and
felt without being practised; but the
case is different with vice. We are led to
vice by our passions, and defend it by
subtlety of reasoning. There are besides
bad men in all ages and countries: but, if
the depravation be not too general, even
these will shew some respect to the times.
If the age itself is vicious, (and they are
apt enough to discern this) they hold it in
contempt, shew themselves openly what
they are, and laugh at penalties, which
they flatter themselves will fall but lightly.
In this also they are never deceived. The
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
man who, in the time of Cato, had de∣tested
vice, would have contented himself
with the simple admiration of virtue in that
of Tiberius.</P>
<P>LI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The age of Tiberi∣us the most vici∣ous of an∣tiquity.</NOTE> I have made choice of this age with
design. Vice had then arrived at its high∣est
pitch. This I learn from the court of
Tiberius itself; but there is a small cir∣cumstance
related by Suetonius and Taci∣tus,
which gives me a still greater assur∣ance
of it. It is this. The virtue of the
Romans punished the inconstancy of their
wives with death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Romans entrusted the fidelity of their wives to the care and determination of their family. The relations met, if any one was accused, judged, con∣demned to death, and executed their own sentence on the criminal. The laws also pardoned the hus∣band or father, who, in the transport of his passion, killed the gallant, particularly if of a servile rank. See Plut. in Rom.—Dionys. Halicarn. lib. vii.—Tac. Ann. lib. xiii.—Valer. Max. lib. vi. c. 3—7. Rosin. Antiq. Roma. lib. viii. p. 859, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Their policy per∣mitted

the debaucheries of their courte∣zans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The discourse of Micio in Terence, the manner in which Cicero excuses the debaucheries of his cli∣ent, and the exhortation of Cato sufficiently explain the morals of the Romans in this respect. They cen∣sured debauchery only so far as it prevented the dis∣charge of the essential duties of the citizen.</P>
<P>Nor were their ears more chaste than their actions. The Casina of Plautus is little known; but those who have read that miserable piece, can hardly compre∣hend how it is possible that there should be but forty or fifty years between that farce and the Andria. It consists of a vile intrigue between a parcel of slaves, heightened only by smutty jests and obscenities, low as their condition. None of Plautus's comedies, however, were played so often, nor received with so much applause, as this wretched performance. Such were the Roman manners at the time of the second Punic war: such that virtue which the posterity of ancient Rome so much regretted and admired. See Terent. Adelph. Act i. sc. 2.—Cicero pro Caelio, c. 17.—Hor. Sat. lib. i. Sat. 2. v. 29. Prolog. ad Casin. Piaut.</P></NOTE>; and, in order even to regulate
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
their irregularities, formed them into a li∣censed
body. Now it appears, that un∣der
Tiberius, a great number of women
of distinction did not blush to make pub∣lic
application to the Ediles, to get them∣selves
enrolled among the number of pri∣vileged
curtezans; and thus, tho' to their
own infamy, broke thro' that barrier which
the laws opposed to their prostitution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. lib. iii. c. 35.—Tacit. Annal. lib. ii. c. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parallel between Tacitus and Livy.</NOTE> To select those facts, which ought
to form the principles of our reasonings,
is a task whose extreme difficulty is easy
to be perceived. The negligence or bad

us to lose for ever a choice cir∣cumstance,
for the sake of stunning our
ears with the noise of a battle. If philo∣sophers
are not always historians, it were
at least to be wished that all historians were
philosophers.</P>
<P>Tacitus is the only writer I know that
comes up to my idea of such a philoso∣phical
historian. Even the interesting
Livy himself cannot, in this sense, be com∣pared
to him. Both indeed have soared
far above those ignorant compilers, who
see nothing in facts but the circumstances
of which they are composed: but the one
has written history as a rhetorician, and
the other as a philosopher. Not that ei∣ther
Tacitus was ignorant of the language
of the passions, or Livy in that of reason;
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
but the latter, more earnest to please than
instruct, conducts us step by step in the
retinue of his heroes, and makes us alter∣nately
experience the effects of horrour,
pity, and admiration. Tacitus employs
the force of rhetoric only to display the
connection between the links that form
the chain of historical events, and to in∣struct
the reader by sensible and profound
reflections. It is true, I climb the Alps
with Hannibal; but I deliberate in the
council of Tiberius. Livy describes to
me the abuse of power; a severity that na∣ture
shudders at while it approves; the
spirit of resentment and patriotism, which
constitute that of liberty, and the tyranny
which fell before their united efforts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livy, lib. iii. c. 44.—60.</NOTE>:
but the laws of the decemvir, their cha∣racter,
their failings, their conformity to
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
the genius of the Roman people, to their
own party, to their ambitious designs; all
these he has entirely forgotten. I do not
find it accounted for in him, why the laws,
made for the use of a small, poor, and
half-civilized republic, should overturn
it when the force of their institution had
carried it to the highest pitch of great∣ness.
This I should have found in Taci∣tus;
I think so, not only from the known
bent of his genius, but from that striking
and diversified picture he has given of the
laws, those children of corruption, of li∣berty,
of equity, and of faction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. lib. iii. p. 84. edit. Lips.</NOTE>.</P>

Design has been often observed to

become a philosophical history of man.
He would display these causes operating
in the rise and fall of empires; successively
assuming the appearance of accident, of
prudence, of courage, and of cowardice;
acting without the concurrence of parti∣cular
causes, and sometimes directly against
them. Superior to a fondness for his own
systems, that meanest passion in a philoso∣pher,
he would discover that, notwith∣standing
the extensive influence of those
causes, its effect must necessarily be con∣fined,
and that it would principally dis∣play
itself in general events; in such whose
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
slow, but certain, operation works imper∣ceptibly
a change on the face of things,
particularly on religion, on manners, and
indeed every thing that depends on opi∣nion.
Such would in part be the lesson

without us; and by their number and di∣versity,
enseeble the sentiment. It is there∣fore
among uncultivated savages, whose
ideas are confined to their wants, and
whose wants are simply those of nature,
that the force of sentiment should be
more keen and lively, altho' at the same
time confused and indistinct. Savage man
must be every moment in agitations he
can neither explain nor suppress. Igno∣rant
and weak, he is afraid of every thing,
because he can defend himself from no∣thing.
He admires every thing because
he knows nothing. The despicable opi∣nion
he justly entertains of himself (for va∣nity
is the creature of society) makes him
perceive the existence of some superiour
power. It is this power whose attributes
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
he is ignorant of, that he invokes, and of
whom he asks assistance, without knowing
what pretensions he may have to hope it
will be granted. This sentiment, indis∣tinct
as it was, naturally produced the
good deities of the primitive Greeks, and
the divinities of most of the savage nations;
none of whom, however, knew how to
ascertain their number, attributes, or wor∣ship.</P>
<P>LXVI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every thing he sees be∣comes an obiect of adora∣tion.</NOTE> This sentiment, in time, is mo∣dified
into a notion. Savage man pays
homage to every thing about him; as eve∣ry
thing seems to him more excellent than
himself. The majestic oak, that shelters
him with its spreading boughs, had afford∣ed
a shade to his ancestors, down from
the first of his race. It lifted its head
into the clouds, while the towering eagle
lost itself in its branches. What was the
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
duration, the size, the strength, of an hu∣man
creature, compared to such a tree?
Gratitude next united itself to admiration.
That oak, which afforded him plenty
of acorns, the clear stream, at which he
quenched his thirst, were his benefac∣tors:
they made his life comfortable;
without them he could not subsist, while
at the same time they stood in no need of
him. In effect, without these lights, that
enable us to see how much reason alone is
superior to all those necessary parts of an
intelligent system, every one of them is
superior to man. But wanting such lights,
savage man attributes life and power to
them all; and prostrates himself before ima∣ginary
beings which he hath thus created.</P>
<P>LXVII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ideas are singu∣lar.</NOTE> The ideas of uncivilized man
are singular because they are simple. To
remark the different qualities of objects,
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
to observe those which are common to
many, and from that resemblance to
form an abstract idea, representative of
the genus of objects, without being the
image of any one in particular: this is the
operation of the understanding, which acts
and reflects within itself; and which, over∣stocked
with ideas, thus endeavours to re∣lieve
itself by the forms of method. In a
primitive state, the soul, passive and igno∣rant
of its faculties, is capable only of re∣ceiving
external impressions: these impres∣sions
represent only single objects, and in
such a manner as they seem to exist in
themselves. The savage therefore sees
himself surrounded with deities: every field,
every forest swarms with them.</P>

begins to discover their common nature,
and this nature becomes a new divinity su∣perior
to all particular deities. But every
thing that exists has its existence determin∣ed
by time or place, which distinguish its
identity. Now the human-mind would
be differently influenced with regard to
these two modes of existence; the one be∣ing
plain and obvious to the senses, the
other transient, metaphysical, and perhaps
nothing more than the succession of our
ideas. A common property, varied only
in the mode of time, would eclipse all
particular properties, whilst those which
should be diversified in the mode of place,
might subsist as distinct parts of a common
property. The God of rivers lays an in∣disputed

In proportion as mankind become enlight∣ened,
their idolatry would refine. They
would become better able to perceive how
the universe is governed by general laws;
and would approach nearer the unity of
a sole, efficient cause. The Greeks could
never generalize their ideas beyond the ele∣ments
of water, earth and air; which, under
the names of Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto,
comprehended and governed all things. But
the Aegyptians, whose genius was better

them to acquire; and supposed less power
exerted in the operation. This generation,
however, led them to establish an hierar∣chy,
which these beings, though free yet
limited, could not possibly do without.
Thus the three principal deities exercised
a paternal authority over their children,
dispersed in the air, over the earth and the
sea. The primogeniture of Jupiter gave
him also a superiority over his brothers,
which intitled him to the name of the King
of Gods and Father of Men. But this
king, this supreme father, was too limited
and impotent, in all respects, to suffer us
to do the Greeks the honour of attributing
to them the belief of a Supreme Being.</P>
<P>LXXI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gods of human life.</NOTE> This system, ill-constructed as
it was, accounted for all the physical ef∣fects

man, his destiny, and actions were with∣out
divinities. The earth, or the air, had
been ill-adapted deities. The want of new

errours, which, joined to the former, en∣circled
the regions of theological romance.
I suspect the latter system must take its
rise very late; man never thinking of en∣tering

external objects.</P>
<P>LXXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sys∣tems of li∣berty and necessity.</NOTE> There are two hypotheses

In the other, he is supposed
incapable of acting otherwise than agree∣able
to the pre-established laws of the Deity,
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
of whom he is only the instrument: that
his sentiment deceives him, and when he
imagines he follows his own inclination,
he in fact only pursues that of his master.
The latter notion might be suggested to
the minds of a people, little removed from
a primitive state. Little instructed in the
movements of so complicated a machine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The an∣cients a∣dopted the latter.</NOTE>
they saw with admiration the great virtues,
the atrocious crimes, the useful inventions

inspiring virtue and vice into weak

LXXIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The union of the two species of divinities.</NOTE> These deities of the moral
world, however, these passions and facul∣ties
so generalized and personated, had on∣ly
a metaphysical existence, too occult for
the generality of mankind. It became
necessary, therefore, to incorporate them
with the physical deities; in doing which,
allegory has imagined a thousand fantasti∣cal
relations; for the mind always requires
at least the appearance of truth. It was
natural enough for the God of the sea to
be also that of the sailors. The figurative
expression of the eye, that sees every thing
at one view; of those rays, which dart
thro' the immensity of the air, might easi∣ly
be applied to the sun, and make an
able prophet and a skilful archer, of that
luminary. But wherefore must the planet
Venus be the mother and goddess of love?
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
Why must she take her rise out of the
foam of the ocean? But we must leave
these enigmas to such as may be able to
interpret them. No sooner were these mo∣ral
deities assigned their several depart∣ments,
than, it is natural to conceive, they
engrossed the homage of mankind. They
had to do immediately with the heart
and the passions, whereas the physical di∣vinities,
to whom no moral attributes had
been given, fell insensibly into contempt
and oblivion. Thus, it is only in the

this conclusion: an heathen, however, did
not hesitate to admit, and in fact could
not doubt it. His Gods often suggested
very vicious designs. To suggest them,
it was necessary they should concur, and
even take pleasure in them. They had
not the resource of a small quantity of

quite indifferent as to the general good;
with which they had nothing to do. Every
one acted agreeable to his own character,

to feel. The God of War was fierce,
blood-thirsty and brutal; the Goddess of

divinities. That homage itself was al∣ways
adapted to their character. The
human victims, that expired on the altar
of Mars<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strab. Geog. lib. vii. p. 378.</NOTE>, those thousands of curtezans
who devoted themselves to the services of

of Babylon, who there made a sa∣crifice
of their modesty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They were obliged to prostitute themselves, once in their lives, to the first comer, in the temple of Venus. Voltaire, who imposes on them the ob∣ligation of doing it every year, treats it as an idle and ridiculous fable<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Oeuvr. de Volt. tom. vi. p. 24.—</NOTE>. Herodotus, however, had travelled into these parts; and Mr. Voltaire is too well versed in history to be ignorant, how many similar triumphs superstition has made over humanity and virtue. What does he think of an act of faith? But I anticipate his answer. I was, besides, igno∣rant that Babylon was then the best governed city in the world. Quintius Curtius describes it as the most licentious. Berosa, the Babylonian himself, com∣plains that his fellow-citizens, breaking down all the barriers of modesty, lived like brute beasts; and the scholiast upon Juvenal may inform us, that in his time it was not degenerated<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Quint.

distinguished favour of their protectors.
But as the interests of nations are not less
opposite than their manners, it became
necessary that these Gods should adopt the
quarrels of their worshippers. <Q>What!
shall I patiently behold a city, that has
erected a hundred temples to my divi∣nity,
fall before the sword of the con∣queror?
No. Rather will I—.</Q> It is
thus that, among the Greeks, a war kind∣led
on earth, soon lighted up the torch
of discord in the skies. The siege of
Troy put all heaven into confusion. The
Scamander reflected the rays that darted
from the Aegis of Minerva;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their quarrels.</NOTE> was witness
of the fatal effect of the arrows taken from
the quiver of Apollo, and felt the tremen∣dous
trident of Neptune shake the foun∣dations

of the earth. Sometimes indeed
the irresistible decrees of Fate re-established
peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mythol. de l' Abbé Bannier, tom. ii. p. 487.—Ovid. Metamorph. lib. xv.</NOTE>. But most generally the several
deities mutually agreed to abandon each
others enemies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eurip. Hippol. act v. ver. 1327.—Ovid Meta∣morph▪ passim.</NOTE>; for on Olympus, as
upon earth, hatred is always more power∣ful
than friendship.</P>
<P>LXXVI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They as∣sumed the human form.</NOTE> A refined homage was little
suitable to such a kind of deities. The
multitude required sensible objects; the
image of something to decorate their
temples, and fix their ideas. The choice,
to be sure, must be fixed on the most ami∣able.
But which is that? The human
form will doubtless be preferred by men.
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
Should a bull have answered the question,
he would probably have determined in fa∣vour
of some other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cic. de Nat. Deor. lib. i. c. 27, 28.</NOTE>. Sculpture now
began to improve itself in the service of
devotion, and the temples were filled with
statues of old men and young, women
and children, expressive of the different at∣tributes
ascribed to their deities.</P>
<P>LXXVII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Were li∣able to corporeal pains and pleasures.</NOTE> Beauty is perhaps only found∣ed
on use; the human figure being beau∣tiful
only because it is so well adapted to
the functions to which it is destined. The
figure of the divinity, the same, should
be certainly expressive of its properties,
and even of its defects. Hence came that
absurd generation of deities, who composed
only a celestial family, similar to those
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
among mankind: hence their feasts of
nectar and ambrosia, and the nourishment
they were supposed to receive from the sa∣crifices.
Hence also their quiet slum∣bers
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer. Iliad. lib. i. v. 609.</NOTE>, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. Iliad. lib. v. ver. 335.</NOTE>. The
Gods, thus become only a race of superior
men, used often to make visits on earth,
inhabit their temples, take pleasure in
the ammements of mankind, join in the
chace, mix in the dance, and sometimes
grow susceptible of the charms of a mor∣tal
beauty, and give birth to a race of
heroes.</P>
<P>LXXVIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of gene∣ral events.</NOTE> In those great events, where∣in,
from the diversity of actors, whose
views, situation, and character, are differ∣ent,
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
there arises an unity of action, or ra∣ther
of effect; it is perhaps only into ge∣neral
causes we must look for the springs
of those.</P>
<P>LXXIX.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mixture of causes in particu∣lar events.</NOTE> In more particular events, the
process of nature is very different from
that of the philosophers. In nature there
are few effects so simple as to owe them∣selves
to one sole cause; whereas our phi∣losophers
are generally attached to one
cause, sole and universal. Let us avoid
this precipice: on the contrary, if an ac∣tion
appears ever so little complicated,
let us admit of general causes, not exclud∣ing
either hazard or design. Sylla re∣signed
the sovereignty of Rome. Caesar
lost it with his life: nevertheless their
encroachments on liberty were alike pre∣ceded
by their conquests: before they be∣came
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
the most powerful, they became the
most famous, among the Romans. Au∣gustus
trod nearly in the same steps. A
sanguinary tyrant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the taking of Perusa, he sacrificed three hundred of the principal citizens upon an altar erect∣ed to the divinity of his father.

that greatest of all crimes in the
leader of a party<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sueton. lib. ii. c. 16.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ele∣vation of Augustus.</NOTE> he reached the throne,
and soon made those republicans forget
they had ever been free. Indeed the dis∣position
of those people diminishes my
surprize. Equally incapable of liberty
under Sylla as under Augustus, they were
ignorant of this truth in the time of the
former: a civil war and two proscriptions,
more cruel and bloody than that war itself,
had taught them, by the time of the lat∣ter,
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
that the republic, sinking beneath the
weight of its greatness and corruption,
could not subsist without a master. Be∣sides,
Sylla, one of the first of the nobles,
fought at the head of those haughty Pa∣tricians,
who, tho' they put a sword into
the hand of despotism to avenge them∣selves
of their enemies, would not leave
it there with the power of converting it
to the destruction of themselves. They
had conquered with him, not for him: the
harangue of Lepidus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sallust. Fragm. p. 404. Edit. Thysii.</NOTE>, and the conduct of
Pompey<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Frensheim. Supplem. lib. lxxxix. c. 26 à 33.</NOTE>, make it sufficiently clear, that
Sylla chose rather to descend from his in∣vidious
situation, than be thrown headlong
from it. But Augustus, after the ex∣ample
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
of Caesar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. lib. iv. p. 109.—Sueton. ubi in∣fra.</NOTE>, employed only those
enterprising adventurers, Agrippa, Mece∣nas,
and Pollio, whose fortunes, attached
to his, had been nothing divided among
an aristocracy of nobles, but were when
united sufficient to crush a new pretender.</P>
<P>LXXX.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes of it.</NOTE> Those fortunate circumstances
of the debauchery of Anthony, the weak∣ness
of Lepidus, and the credulity of
Cicero, operated in concert with the ge∣neral
disposition, in his favour: but it
must be confessed, that tho' he did not
give birth to these circumstances, he em∣ployed
them with great art and policy.
The vast variety of objects, that present
themselves, will not permit to display the
nature of that refined government; to de∣scribe
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
the yoke that was borne without
being felt, the Prince undistinguished
from the citizens, or the senate respected
by its master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is with impatience I expect the continuation of those dissertations on this subject, which M. de la Bleterie hath promised us. The system of Augus∣tus, so often misunderstood, will be laid down with the utmost minuteness. This author hath a peculiar delicacy, and an amiable freedom, of sentiment. He is argumentative without dryness, and expresses him∣self with all the graces of a clear and elegant stile. Perhaps, however, this Descartes of history rea∣sons a little too much <HI>a priori,</HI> and founds his con∣clusions less upon authority of particular facts, than on general induction: but this is the fault only of men of great genius.</NOTE>. We will select, however,
one circumstance.</P>
<P>Augustus, master of the revenues of the
empire, and the riches of the world, con∣stantly
distinguished between his own par∣ticular
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
patrimony and the treasure of the
public. By which means he displayed his
moderation, in having bequeathed to his
heirs effects of less value than the fortunes
of many of his subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augustus bequeathed to Tiberius and Livia only millies quingenties, thirty millions of livres. The augur Lentulus died in his reign, worth qua∣ter millies, fourscore millions. Sueton. lib. ii. c. 101.—Seneca de Benefic. lib. ii.</NOTE>; and his love to
his country, in having given up to the ser∣vice
of the state two entire patrimonies;
together with an immense sum, arising from
the legacies of his deceased friends.</P>
<P>LXXXI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The same action both cause and effect.</NOTE> An ordinary degree of pene∣tration
is sufficient to discover when an
action is at once both cause and effect.
In the moral world there are many such;
or rather, there are but few, which do not,
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
more or less, partake of both the one
and the other.</P>
<P>The corruption of all orders of men
among the Romans, was owing to the ex∣tent
of their empire, and was itself pro∣ductive
of the greatness of the republic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Montesq. Consid. sur la Grandeur des Romains.
I distinguish the greatness of the Roman em∣pire from that of the republic: the one consisted in the number of provinces, the other in that of its citizens.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But it requires an uncommon share of
judgment, when two things are constantly
united, and seem intimately connected, to
discern that they are neither effect nor
cause to one another.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167"/>
LXXXII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sci∣ences do not arise from luxu∣ry.</NOTE> The sciences, it is said, take
their rise from luxury; an enlightened
must be always a vicious people. For
my part, I cannot be of this opinion.
The sciences are not the daughters of
luxury, but both the one and the other
owe their birth to industry. The arts,
in their rudest state, satisfied the primi∣tive
wants of men. In their state of per∣fection
they suggest new ones, even from
Vitellius's shield of Pallas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vitellius sent his gal'ies as far as the pillars of Hercules, in order to catch the uncommon and delicate fish, of which this luxurious dish was com∣posed. If we may credit Dr. Arbuthnot, it cost 765, 625 l. Sterling. See Sueton. in Vitellio, c. 13. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbuthnot's Tables, p. 138.</NOTE>, to the philo∣sophical
entertainments of Cicero. But
in proportion as luxury corrupts the man∣ners,
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
the sciences soften them; like to
those prayers in Homer, which constantly
pursue injustice, to appease the fury of
that cruel deity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>Homer. Iliad. lib. ix. v. 500.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus have I thrown together a few re∣flections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu∣sion.</NOTE>
which appeared to me just and
rational, on the utility of the Belles-Lettres.
Happy should I think myself, if, by so
doing, I should inspire a taste for them
in others. I should entertain too good
an opinion of myself, if I did not see the
imperfections of this Essay; and should
have too bad a one if I did not hope,
at an age less premature, and with a more
extensive knowlege, to be able to correct
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
them. It may possibly be said, these re∣flections
are just, but hackneyed and trite,
or that they are new, but paradoxical.
Where is the author who loves the critics?
The former imputation, however, will
displease me least; the advantage of the
art being more dear to me than the repu∣tation
of the artist.</P>
