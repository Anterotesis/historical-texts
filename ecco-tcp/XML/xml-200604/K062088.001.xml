<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. WILLOUGHBY was, at the age of
thirty, left a widow, with a son and a
daughter, of whom she was extremely fond,
and to whose education she entirely devoted
herself. George Willoughby, herson, had
been placed at Eton by his father, but at∣tended
by a private tutor, a man of sense
and learning, who was distantly related to
their family. When he was about thirteen,
a fever, from which he narrowly escaped,
so injured his constitution, that his mother
was directed by his physicians to take him
to the South of Europe. Thither she and
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
her daughter, with Mr. Everard, accompa∣nied
him. A few months completely re∣stored
his health; and they then went all
together to Geneva; where, after a short re∣sidence,
she left her son to pursue his studies
under the care of Mr. Everard; and with
her daughter Matilda, then near eight years
old, she fixed herself for some time at
Hieres, on the coast of Provence; a town
with whose beauty she had been much
struck four or five years before, when, to
divert her concern for the loss of her hus∣band,
she had made a tour of some months
through France and Italy.</P>
<P>Matilda was placed in a convent, for the
purposes of instruction; and there she be∣came
the playfellow of a little girl almost
three years younger, who was known among
the Nuns by the name of <HI>la petite Celestine.</HI>
The fondness which soon subsisted between
her and Matilda introduced her of course to
Mrs. Willoughby, who was at first sight
charmed with her beauty, and after a few in∣terviews,
so delighted with her infantine ca∣resses,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
that she became as anxious to see her
every day as she was to see her own child.
Her countenance, with that blooming de∣licacy
which the French distinguish by call∣ing
it "<HI>le vrai teint Anglois,</HI>" had all that
animation which is more usually found
among the natives of the south of Europe;
yet this spirited expression often melted
into softness so insinuating, that it was dif∣ficult
to say whether pensive tenderness or
sparkling vivacity was the most predomi∣nant;
or whether it was the loveliness of
her little form and face, or the enchant∣ment
of her manners, which made her so
very attractive, that the very servants who
saw her with Matilda became so fond of
her, as never to carry her back to the con∣vent,
after a visit to their lady, but with re∣luctance
and regret.</P>
<P>The Nuns, however, with whom she
lived, seemed, either from seeing her con∣stantly,
or for want of taste, to be quite in∣sensible
of perfections which won every
other heart. They treated her sometimes
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
with harshness, and always with indiffe∣rence;
so that to be with Mrs. Willoughby
soon became the greatest happiness the little
Celestina could enjoy. Mrs. Willoughby
found an equal pleasure in returning her
affection; and was sometimes moved even
to tears, when happening to caress Matilda,
the other amiable child would approach as
if to share her tenderness, take her hand,
look innocently in her face, and say with a
sigh, "<HI>Helas! que n'ai je aussi une Ma∣man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Alas! why have not I a Mama too!"</NOTE>!"</P>
<P>These artless expressions, and the cold∣ness
with which the sisterhood treated their
infant pensioner, raised in Mrs. Willoughby
a great desire to know to whom the child
belonged: but every attempt to gain in∣formation
was at first repressed by so much
reserve, that she almost despaired of being
gratified. At length however she received
a hint, that by the skilful application of
means equally potent in Courts or Con∣vents,
she might learn all the Nuns knew;
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and in consequence of pursuing this hint,
she was informed, that the last Superior of
the house, who had been dead two years,
had received Celestina into it when only a
few months old, as a child whose birth it
was of the utmost consequence to conceal:
that only the Superior herself, and her
Confessor, who was also dead, had ever
known to whom she belonged; every trace
of which secret had by them been so care∣fully
obliterated, that after the decease of
both, every attempt at discovery had been
ineffectual. It was believed that a consi∣derable
sum of money had been received
as the price of secresy, and as a provision
for the child; but it had never been car∣ried
to account, or any part of it appro∣priated
to the use of the community in ge∣neral,
who now consequently murmured at
the necessity they were under, as they said,
<HI>par charité, et pour l'amour de Dieu,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Through charity, and for the love of God.</NOTE> to sup∣port
<HI>la petite Celestine</HI> for life: but they added,
that as soon as she was old enough to take
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
the vows, she must become a Nun, and fill
one of the inferior offices of the convent,
since she had no friends or money to pay
for being on a higher footing.</P>
<P>The pity excited by this account, added
to the sensibility with which, infant as she
was, she felt her own situation; her tender
attachment to her benefactress, and to Ma∣tilda,
and the sense and sweetness visible in
all she said and did, procured for her, in the
tender and generous heart of Mrs. Wil∣loughby,
an interest little short of what she
felt for Matilda herself. Every hour in∣creased
this interest; till after a stay of
eighteen months at Hieres, during which
she had seen her almost every day, she
found, in reflecting on her departure, that
she should be really unhappy the rest of
her life, if she returned to England, and
left this amiable child to a fate so melan∣choly
in itself, and so unworthy of the pro∣mise
of perfection given by her infancy.
Having once entertained the idea of taking
her to England, it soon became too pleasing
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
to be relinquished. There were however
great difficulties in the way. Though the
community complained of Celestina as a
burthen to them, they made, as they de∣clared,
a point of conscience, not to part
with her to an heretic; and the more soli∣citous
Mrs. Willoughby became, the more
they declaimed against the sin it would be,
to hazard the soul of <HI>la petite Celestine</HI> for
the sake of any worldly advantage. While
the matter was yet in debate, George Wil∣loughby
and Mr. Everard, who had been
sent for that the whole family might return
to England together, arrived; and the lat∣ter
finding how much Mrs. Willoughby
desired to become the sole protectress of
the little orphan, prevailed with Father
Angelo, the present confessor, to remove
at once all the scruples he had been instru∣mental
in raising: in a word, Mr. Everard
used the argument to which Monks, in
despite of their professions of poverty, are
not more insensible than the rest of man∣kind;
and Mrs. Willoughby having left a
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
certificate of her having taken Celestina
out of the convent, a promise to educate
her without influencing her to change her
religion, and to provide for her, together
with a direction where she might, in case
of enquiry, be found, was permitted to
carry with her, from Hieres, the lovely
little French girl, who was from that hour
put on an equal footing with her own
daughter, and whom she seemed as ten∣derly
to love.</P>
<P>After an absence of between three and
four years, Mrs. Willoughby and her fa∣mily
returned to England; where to all her
friends, who were generally struck with the
beauty and elegance of her adopted child,
she related, without reserve, the little history
of their accidental attachment.</P>
<P>George Willoughby, now in his seven∣teenth
year, was sent to Cambridge: his
tutor retired to a small living, which had
fallen near his estate in the West of
England, since his absence, and to which
his mother, as patroness in his minority,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
had presented this excellent and amiable
man.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willoughby usually passed the
winters in London; where masters of mu∣sic,
drawing, dancing, and languages, at∣tended
her two girls, for so she equally
termed Matilda and her little friend:—their
summers were divided between pub∣lic
places and Alstone (or Alvestone, as it
was spelt), an estate between Sidmouth
and Exeter, of which her husband had
been so fond, that he had hurt his fortune
by the large sums he had expended on its
improvement. This attachment George
seemed to inherit; and in compliment to
him, his mother always passed the vaca∣tions
there: Willoughby himself having
no pleasure so great as in talking and
thinking of the happiness he should enjoy,
when he should become master of Alstone,
and see his mother and sister, of whom he
was extremely fond, settled there with him
for the greatest part of every year. Mrs.
Willoughby, whose love for him might
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
have been said to border on weakness, if it
had been possible to discover any excess in
the attachment of a mother to a son so un∣commonly
deserving, had always encou∣raged
the inclination he had from his in∣fancy
betrayed for this his paternal seat:
though his little projects often gave her
pain; for she knew, what she had with
more tenderness than prudence studiously
concealed from him, that his father's
affairs were at his death so much embar∣rassed,
as to render it doubtful whether a
minority of near thirteen years would so far
clear his estates, as to enable him at the
end of that period to reside in this favourite
place, with the splendour and hospitality
for which his ancestors had for centuries
been eminent. The last Mr. Willoughby
had indeed continued the same line of
conduct in the country; but his manner of
living in town had been quite unlike that
of his prudent and plainer ancestors; who
had but just recovered his estate, when it
was transmitted to him, from the injuries it
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
had received by their adherence to Charles
the First; during whose unfortunate reign,
they had sold some part of their extensive
possessions, and had been plundered of
more. His grandfather and great-grand∣father
had nearly retrieved the whole of
the estate round Alverstone, where they
piqued, themselves on losing none of the
family consequence; but the manners of
the times in which he lived, and a disposition
extremely gay and volatile, had led
the last possessor into expences, which, if
they did not oblige him to sell, had obliged
him to mortgage great part of this, as well
as all his other estates; and being charged
at his death with twelve hundred a year to
his widow, and the interest of ten thousand
pounds given to his daughter, they slowly
and with difficulty produced, under the ma∣nagement
of very careful executors, little
more than sufficient to pay such charges,
and the interest of the money for which
they were mortgaged.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Mrs. Willoughby however was unwilling
to interrupt the felicity of her son's happiest
hours, by representing to him a dreary
prospect of the future; especially as she
thought that future might, as it advanced,
become brighter; and that it was possible
all his gay visions might be realized. He
had a great uncle, far advanced in life, and
very rich, who, though the late Mr. Wil∣loughby
had disobliged him, might, she
thought, through mere family pride, give
to the son, what he had often declared the
father should never possess. Her brother,
Lord Castlenorth, was the last male of his
illustrious race: he had only a daughter;
and an increase of his family becoming
every day more improbable, he had con∣certed
with his sister, even while George
(who was younger than his daughter) was
yet a child, how the family might be re∣stored
by a union of its two remaining
branches.</P>
<P>The good sense of Mrs. Willoughby
had not entirely saved her from family
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
pride; and this project, which the situation
of her son's fortune rendered doubly de∣sirable,
had by degrees taken such posses∣sion
of her mind, that nothing would have
made her more unhappy, than suspecting
it might not take effect. After her return
with her family from France, she had an
interview with her brother, Lord Castle∣north,
who was then in England (though
his health occasioned him for the most part
to reside abroad), and it was then agreed
with him, or rather with Lady Castlenorth,
whose will was his law, that if the young
people liked each other, of which they
hardly suffered themselves to doubt, the
match should take place as soon as young
Willoughby became of age, who was then
to assume the name of Fitz-Hayman, and
in whose favour, when united with the sole
heiress of the family, there was little doubt
of procuring the succession to the title.
Willoughby, who was yet ignorant of this
proposed arrangement, had accompanied
his mother in her visit: but far from feel∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
any partiality for his cousin, he had
hardly taken any notice of her, and had
passed all those hours when common civi∣lity
did not oblige him to attend the fa∣mily,
in wandering with his tutor over the
extensive domain belonging to his Lord∣ship's
magnificent seat. He seemed indeed
much more sensible of the charms of Castle∣north,
which was the name of his uncle's
house, from whence the title was derived,
than pleased with either its present or
its future possessor. Mr. Everard, who
anxiously watched every emotion of his
mind, saw this, and he saw too that his
pupil was of a temper which would ill bear
to be dictated to in a point so nearly con∣nected
with his own happiness. He pre∣vailed
therefore, with some difficulty, on
Mrs. Willoughby, not to explain her views
till nearer the period when she meant they
should be perfected; and they left Castle∣north
without Willoughby's having the
smallest suspicion of them, or carrying
away any other idea of his cousin, than that
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
she was a tall, fat, formal brown girl, whom
he soon forgot and never desired to re∣member.
His uncle's complaints and
quack medicines—his long lectures on ge∣nealogy
and heraldry—had tired him; and
Lady Castlenorth's dictatorial manners of∣fended
and disgusted him. He told Mr.
Everard, that the only hour in which he
had felt any pleasure during his abode at
their house, was that in which his mother
fixed the time of departing for her own.
Thither he returned with redoubled de∣light,
after the restraint he had felt himself
under at Castlenorth; for there lay all
his plans of future felicity, and there were
Matilda and Celestina, his two sisters, as he
always called them, who seemed equally
dear to him.</P>
<P>In a few months he went to Cambridge;
and Mr. Everard, who afterwards saw him
only for a few days in the year, had no
longer the same opportunities of judging
of his sentiments. He still however had
interest enough with Mrs. Willoughby, to
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
prevail on her to delay any intimation of
the intended alliance. Lord Castlenorth,
his lady, and daughter, were now in Italy,
and were to remain there till within six
months of the time fixed among themselves
for the marriage of the latter: but above a
twelvemonth before the arrival of the for∣mer
period, Mr. Everard died. Mrs. Wil∣loughby
and her family lost in him the sin∣cerest
friend and most capable monitor: a
loss which greatly affected Willoughby, as
well as his mother, who sent for her son
from Cambridge on that melancholy occa∣sion.
Thither he had hardly returned, be∣fore
the uncle of his father, on whom he
had great dependance, and who had not
long before taken him into his favour, and
promised to make him his heir, died with∣out
having altered his will, and endowed
an hospital with the estate which he had
really meant to give his nephew, had not
death overtaken him before he could con∣quer
his habitual indolence, aggravated by
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
the feebleness and imbecility of eighty-seven.</P>
<P>This disappointment was severely felt by
Mrs. Willoughby, who apprehended that
not only the immediate but the contingent
interest of her son might be deeply affected
by it: she doubted whether it would not
change the intentions of her brother in his
favor; but after some weeks of uneasy
suspense, she received assurances from
Italy that those his intentions and wishes
were still the same.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willoughby, though re-assured in
this respect, was still in very low spirits,
and felt every hour, with encreasing seve∣rity,
the loss she had sustained in such a
friend as Mr. Everard, whom she lamented
indeed publicly, but still more bitterly in
private. Her constitution, naturally very
delicate, began to decline under the sorrow
which oppressed her. Matilda, then about
sixteen, was the only person about her who
seemed insensible of the alteration which
now made a slow but very evident pro∣gress
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
in her looks and manner. Her coun∣tenance
was still pleasing and interesting,
but very languid; her eyes had lost their
fire; and she grew very thin. Her amia∣ble
manners remained; but all her viva∣city
in conversation was fled. She no
longer enjoyed society, of which she had
been so fond: but she still went into com∣pany,
because Matilda, now of an age to
enter into all the gaieties of high life, did
indeed engage in them with an avidity
which her mother was too indulgent to
repress, though she could not approve it.
Sometimes however she suffered so much
from crouded rooms and late hours, that
though she did not even then complain,
her physicians insisted on her forbearing
so continually to hazard-her health. Ma∣tilda,
who was very uneasy if long kept
from company, was then put under the
care of some of her mother's friends, and
the task of attending on her beloved be∣nefactress
fell entirely to the lot of Celes∣tina,
who was never so happy as when
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
employed in it, and who now having just
completed her fourteenth year, surpassed,
in the perfections both of person and mind,
all that Mrs. Willoughby, partial as she
had always been to her, had ever supposed
she would attain.</P>
<P>Above two years passed away: Wil∣loughby
pursuing very regularly his studies
at Cambridge; Matilda pursuing as regu∣larly
every amusement that offered itself;
and Celestina, careless of all that has usually
attractions for youth, devoting her whole
time and thoughts to Mrs. Willoughby,
who without saying any thing of what she
felt to be inevitable, was gradually sinking
into the grave.</P>
<P>This conviction made her determine to
disclose to her son, when she next saw
him, her purpose in regard to Miss Fitz-Hayman;
but it was a resolution she could
not bring herself to make, without infinite
regret; for in giving her reasons for wish∣ing
this alliance, it was necessary for her
to open to him the real state of his fortune;
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
of which her tenderness, in this instance
perhaps injudicious, had hitherto kept him
in ignorance. The longer this affectionate
mother thought of the pain she should
thus inflict on her son, the less she found
herself able to undertake it: she therefore
determined that Mr. Dawson, who had
been employed many years by his father
as steward and manager of the estates,
should, under pretence of consulting him
on his affairs, now that he was of an age
to direct in them, disclose to him their
real situation. For this purpose he went
to Cambridge; and there this unpleasant
explanation was made to Willoughby: who
learned, that his father, towards the latter
end of his life, had mortgaged above a
third of his property for nearly its value;
that-what remained was not only encum∣bered
by heavy debts, which were to be
discharged out of it, but had a charge of
twelve hundred a year, his mother's jointure,
and was to pay his sister ten thousand
pounds, with interest till she married—
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
burthens which so diminished the income,
as to make it impossible to save any thing
during his minority, and left him no pros∣pect
of ever enjoying his paternal estate
unembarrassed, but by an opulent mar∣riage.
Though Mr. Dawson had, with
as much caution and tenderness as possible,
opened to Willoughby the real condition
of his affairs, the young man, of warm
passions and keen feelings, could not hear
such a mortifying account but with the
extremest pain and humiliation. Unable
to remain tranquilly at Cambridge, he
immediately set out for London, and
asked of his mother a farther explanation;
as if unwilling to receive from any hand
but her's a blow so cruel, which seemed to
destroy for ever all his favourite hopes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Willoughby had ever been so far
from suspecting that her son loved money,
that a tendency to carelesness in that re∣spect
had sometimes alarmed her: she was
therefore extremely surprized at the eager∣ness
of his enquiries, and the evident
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
anxiety and concern he expressed at his
disappointment. But having convinced
him that all he had heard was but too true,
and recovered from the agitation into
which the necessity of giving him so much
pain had thrown her, she seized the op∣portunity,
while his mind seemed to turn
with uneasy solicitude towards the means
of redeeming his patrimony, to suggest to
him the plan she had so long considered as
infallible—"My dear George," said she,
"there is one way by which all this may
be repaired; and your estāte, devolving
to you from a long line of ancestors, of
whom any man might be proud, may not
only be repaired but encreased, by an al∣liance
of which an ambitious man may be
still prouder. My brother, Lord Castle∣north,
is the last male of a line distinguished
since the conquest; your cousin, his only
daughter, will inherit his fortune; the ti∣tles
die with him. It is equally natural
therefore for him and for me, to wish that
you, my son, in becoming the husband
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
of my niece, may possess the estates
and honours of my family, which on such
a union would be easily obtained; and
that in you may be revived, or rather per∣petuated,
the family of Fitz-Hayman. I
did not intend to have named this to you
till your farther acquaintance with your
cousin, who returns to England in the
course of the next summer, should have
made it on your part a measure of incli∣nation;
for from all the accounts I have
had of her, she is very amiable and highly
accomplished: but my uncertain health,
and the near approach of that period when
you become master of yourself, have at
length determined me to tell you my
thoughts in a matter, on which the pros∣perity
of your future life depends. I need
not say, George, that seeing it in that light,
there is nothing in this world so near my
heart as its completion."</P>
<P>Willoughby, whose mind was contend∣ing
with the various emotions this discourse
of his mother's had raised, remained silent
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
and confused. He changed colour; he
sighed, as if to throw off the unexpected
pressure on his heart; and Mrs. Willoughby,
who saw with concern that he entered not
into the project with the alacrity she had
expected, began again to describe to him
not only the numerous advantages which
must follow the marriage, but to repeat all
she had heard, and more that she had ima∣gined,
of the perfections of Miss Fitz-Hayman.</P>
<P>Willoughby however appeared rather to
be musing than attending to almost the
only conversation from his mother that he
had ever thought tedious. When she
seemed to have exhausted the subject, he
still paused a moment; then taking his
hand from his forehead, he asked his mo∣ther—whether
she thought Miss Fitz-Hay∣man
as lovely as Celestina?</P>
<P>"As lovely as Celestina!" replied Mrs.
Willoughby in great and apparently pain∣ful
surprize—"How came Celestina to
occur to you?"</P>
<P>"Nay," answered her son, attempting
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
to appear indifferent—I know not how,
unless because she is the prettiest young
woman I have lately seen."</P>
<P>"Surely you do not think of Celestina,"
reassumed Mrs. Willoughby with encreased
emotion—"surely you are not imprudent
enough to entertain an idea of her other∣wise
than as a sister. There are objections—insuperable
objections. For God's sake,
George, let me be assured that you will
never again think of her."</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," returned Willoughby
with some quickness, "that is really more
than I can promise. How is it possible for
me to assure you, with any hope of my
being able to keep my word, that I will
not think of a beautiful and interesting
object, which, whenever I am with you,
is continually before my eyes."</P>
<P>"Well then," said his mother with yet
more chagrin, "since it is so, you will
compel me to remove her where—"</P>
<P>"Surely," cried the young man, ea∣gerly
interrupting her, "that would be
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
very cruel—very cruel as it would affect
Celestina, and very unnecessary as it re∣lates
to me; for I shall now be very seldom
at home; and I can, without any danger
of breaking my word, assure you, that no∣thing
will ever make your son forget the
duty he owes you, or hazard giving you
pain. I am very sorry I named Celestina,
since you seem so uneasy at it. Think of
it no more I beseech you; and continue
to love, as you used to do, my adopted
sister, or I shall never forgive myself for
my inadvertence."</P>
<P>Willoughby then, without staying to talk
over farther the proposed alliance with
Miss Fitz-Hayman, hurried away; and
that he might avoid all farther conversation
with his mother, he staid out to supper that
night, and immediately after breakfast the
following morning returned to Cambridge;
telling her, as he took leave, that it would
be time enough to talk over the business
she had opened to him when the parties to
whom it related were in England, but that
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
she might assure herself that <HI>her</HI> happiness
was always nearer his heart than his own.</P>
<P>This was the first time in his life that
the parted from Matilda and Celestina
without saluting them both. When break∣fast
was over, and he had taken leave of
his mother, he kissed his sister as usual,
and was approaching Celestina, who al∣ready
held out her hand to him, when
catching his mother's eye, who seemed to
look at him reproachingly, he blushed,
and only bowing and wishing Celestina her
health till he saw her again, he hastened
to the door, and without venturing even
to look at her, as she followed him thither
with his mother and sister, he mounted his
horse and disappeared.</P>
<P>Hurt cruelly at this behaviour, (which
from the very different judgment she had
formed of it, had yet more alarmed his
mother,) Celestina could not repress the
tears which she felt rising to her eyes. Mrs.
Willoughby stood at the door till her son
turned into another street; and was then
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
going to her own room, when Celestina,
from an emotion she could not command,
caught her hand and burst into tears: and
for the first time in her life, her benefac∣tress,
instead of soothing her, received her
mournful caresses with repulsive coldness,
and almost without speaking to her left
her. Matilda was as usual engaged to a
morning concert, and had neither time nor
inclination to attend to the concern of Ce∣lestina
or the displeasure of her mother,
which indeed she either did not see, or see∣ing,
reflect upon. Poor Celestina there∣fore,
who never suspected the real source
of Willoughby's affected coldness, nor
could imagine why his mother, who al∣ways
found pleasure and comfort in her
company, should now fly from her, con∣cluded
she had offended them both, and
passed the morning in tears. At dinner,
however, Mrs. Willoughby, as if con∣scious
of her injustice, behaved to her with
even more than her accustomed tenderness.
After they had dined, as Matilda was still
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
out, their reading went on as usual. Mrs.
Willoughby took no notice of the swolen
eyes and half-stifled sobs which still agitated
the gentle bosom of her young friend; but
without naming the cause, she seemed
solicitous to remove every remaining un∣easiness;
and by her easy and affectionate
manner Celestina became convinced that
concern for her son's departure, and not
anger towards her, had occasioned the
coldness which had so much alarmed her;
and her soft heart was thus restored to
tranquillity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Mrs. Willoughby took
infinite pains to appear cheerful, and to hide
the progress of the illness which was un∣dermining
her constitution, her efforts to
appear better than she was, could not de∣ceive
her physicians; who now proposed
that she should go either to Lisbon or the
South of France. This prescription how∣ever
she endeavoured to evade, by assuring
them that travelling so late in the year
would infallibly injure rather than be useful
to her; but she promised to follow their
advice early in the ensuing spring, and to
pass the winter at Bath. Thither she re∣paired
in November, with her daughter
and Celestina, to remain some months.
Willoughby declined joining them at the
end of term, contrary to his usual custom:
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
he informed his mother, by letter, that he
had made a party with some of his friends
to pass the Christmas vacation at Alve∣stone,
and that on their way back to Cam∣bridge
they would stay two or three days
at Bath.</P>
<P>Matilda in the mean time, who fre∣quented
every public amusement, was be∣come
a Bath beauty, followed and admired
by that description of men whose opinion
is considered as decisive in the world of
fashion. Miss Willoughby was always
most elegantly dressed; for to be so was
the principal study of her life. She was
always with people of rank, was of an ho∣nourable
family, had a good fortune, great
connections, a pretty person, and was, to
use the common phrase, "extremely ac∣complished;"
that is, she knew something
of every thing, and talked as if she knew
a great deal more. Among the men of
ton who contributed to feed her vanity and
raise her fashion, was Mr. Molyneux, the
only son of an Irish Baronet, of whom the
bounty of a grandfather had made him in∣dependent.
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
With an handsome figure, a
good fortune, and a title in reversion, Mr.
Molyneux was every where courted and
admired; and by lounging about from
one public place to another during the
summer, and passing his winters, whether
in England or Ireland, in the very first
world, he had acquired so high a polish,
that his manners and his dress, his expres∣sions,
and even his air, were copied by all
the rising beaux. His understanding was
just of that level which rendered him capa∣ble
of being pleased with this species of
fame; and having no great warmth of
heart, he had no other motive of choice
in marrying than that which arose from
his solicitude to maintain his importance as
a man of taste in the fashionable world.
He had indeed no great inclination to
marry at all; but his father, now far ad∣vanced
in life, pressed him so earnestly to
take a wife, and he was so besieged by the
kind entreaties of two maiden aunts who
had a great deal to give him, that tired by
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
their importunity, and willing enough to
oblige them in a matter which was indif∣ferent
to himself, he at length, in the
thirty-fifth year of his age, fixed on Miss
Willoughby, as a pretty woman, well
born, and above all—very much "the
rage." Proposals from such a man were
of course accepted by the mother and the
daughter; Willoughby was pleased to hear
his sister was likely to be so well established;
and in a few weeks it was settled that the
wedding was to take place in February,
when Mrs. Willoughby and her family
proposed returning to London.</P>
<P>When Willoughby came with his Cam∣bridge
friends to Bath, to fulfil the promise
given to his mother, he was introduced to
his future brother-in-law. But a very short
observation convinced him that they were
not designed for friends; and that however
closely they might be allied, Mr. Moly∣neux
would still be to him a mere ac∣quaintance.
Willoughby was eager in the
pursuit of knowledge; his mind, already
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
highly cultivated, his heart warm and open,
and his manners, with all the ingenuous
simplicity of youth, had the natural good
breeding which only good understanding
can give. Whatever was the real charac∣ter
of Molyneux, it was no longer distin∣guishable
under the polish of fashion; to
obtain which, alone, seemed to be his
study; all his ideas of good and evil, of
right or wrong, centered there. If books
had been the object, in the circle where he
moved, he would have qualified himself to
talk upon them; but as they were not, his
reading never extended beyond a short no∣vel,
a pamphlet, or a newspaper. To
strike out something new in a cape or a
carriage, something which the great would
imitate and the little wonder at, was half
the purpose of his life: to have any af∣fections
was reckoned extremely vulgar;
and as he really had as few as was well pos∣sible,
it cost him but little trouble to di∣vest
himself of them entirely, and to obtain
that <HI>sang froid</HI> which is the true criterion
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
of a man of fashion. It is absolutely ne∣cessary
to be in the House of Commons.
A seat therefore he had for a Cornish bo∣rough;
where he gave a silent vote to the
Minister for the time being, and neither
cared nor enquired whether it would bene∣fit
or injure his country, about which he
was perfectly indifferent. Yet with a mind
occupied almost entirely by trifles, his hand∣some
figure, and his affluent fortune and
fashionable manners, gave him that conse∣quence
which is often denied to virtues and
talents. His air was that of a man of rank;
and the calm coldness of his manner gave
an idea of latent powers, which he was
supposed to be too indolent to exert.</P>
<P>Matilda, in many respects, seemed to be
his very counterpart. Since they had been
so much together, she had adopted his
thoughts and caught his phrases; and her
brother, though he did not think her by
any means improved by the imitation, al∣lowed,
that if similarity of character gives
happiness in marriage, his sister had a pros∣pect
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
of being completely happy. But when
he looked at Celestina, which he avoided
doing as much as possible, he saw in her
improvements so different from those of
Matilda, that all his resolutions to wean
his mind from dwelling on her perfections
faded before her. She was now in her se∣venteenth
year, with a face and form which
instantly attracted the eye, even before the
beauties of her understanding had time to
display themselves. These latter she never
obtruded on observation; but was as silent
in company as Matilda was talkative and gay.
The loveliness of her form therefore it was
that immediately struck the young compa∣nions
of Willoughby; who both, the instant
they quitted the room where they had been
introduced to Mrs. Willoughby, her daugh∣ter,
and Celestina, asked of Willoughby
farther particulars of his adopted sister, de∣claring
they had never seen so charming a
girl, and expressing their wonder at the
calmness with which he had frequently
spoken of her. This conversation was so
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
uneasy to him, that he could with difficulty
conceal his vexation; and as his college
friends from time to time renewed it, that
circumstance, added to the pain he felt in
forcing himself to behave to Celestina with
cold and distant civility, shortened his visit
to three days; at the end of which time he
took leave of his mother, who again men∣tioned
to him her views in regard to Miss
Fitz-Hayman; to which Willoughby, who
was less than ever inclined to listen to her
on that point, returned vague but gentle
answers; escaping from it as well as he
could without giving any thing like a pro∣mise,
he hastened back to his books,
among which he hoped to lose the idea of
Celestina, which he could not cherish but at
the hazard of rendering either his mother
or himself unhappy.</P>
<P>He promised to attend in London his
sister's wedding, which was now to take
place in a month, and for which prepara∣tions
were making: but about a week be∣fore
the day fixed for Mrs. Willoughby's
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
departure for London, an inflammation on
her already injured lungs seized her so sud∣denly,
that there was only time to send an
express to Cambridge for her son, who,
notwithstanding his utmost expedition, ar∣rived
hardly an hour before his excellent
parent expired.</P>
<P>As she had before taken leave of her
daughter and Celestina, the greater part of
that melancholy hour was given to her son,
ever the object of her tenderest affections.
What passed was known only to Wil∣loughby,
who, the moment his mother
was no more, gave way to such an excess
of sorrow, as deprived him for some hours
of his senses; and when they were restored,
the sight of Matilda's calmness, who did
not seem to him to feel half the concern
she ought to do, and the perfect composure
of Molyneux, who evidently felt nothing,
seemed to him so insupportable, that he
shut himself up in his own lodgings and
refused every offer of consolation. Though
Celestina had long apprehended that the
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
life of her beloved benefactress was in a
much more precarious situation than she
could herself allow, or than Matilda was
willing to see, yet this cruel and yet unex∣pected
blow quite overwhelmed her: but
Willoughby, as unable to bear the sight of
her grief as displeased at the stoical com∣posure
of his sister, fled with equal solici∣tude
from both of them; and having given
directions for removing the remains of his
mother to the family seat at Alvestone, he
hastened thither himself to receive and pay
them the last offices; which being done,
he wrote to his sister, recommending it to
her to return to London with Celestina,
and to send for an elderly maiden relation
to remain with them till her marriage,
which the death of her mother had of ne∣cessity
postponed: he promised to see her
in town in the course of a fortnight, there
to execute, as far as he could, those parts
of his mother's will which demanded im∣mediate
attention.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
In pursuance of these directions the two
young ladies set out for London, Mr.
Molyneux following them in his own car∣riage.
The fight of the house which had
now lost its mistress, threw Celestina into
all those agonies which the recollection of
past happiness and past kindness, from a
lamented friend, gives to a heart so tender
and so sensible as her's; while Matilda,
who shed a tear or two from feeling some∣thing
of the same sensation, presently re∣covered
herself, and received her lover,
who waited upon her immediately after his
arrival, without betraying any symptoms
of emotion which could give him cause to
apprehend that the repose of his future life
might suffer any interruption from the too
exquisite sensibility of his wife.</P>
<P>At the time he had appointed, Wil∣loughby
rejoined them. Though he now
saw them with less emotion, his melancholy
seemed to be deeper than at first. With
his sister he avoided all conversation that
was not absolutely necessary; with Celes∣tina
he was even more reserved, and never,
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
as in their happier days, brought his books
and sat with her, or sought her conversa∣tion
as his greatest pleasure. He contrived
indeed, under pretence of having affairs
to settle abroad, to see her only at dinner
or supper; and frequently, under pretence
of illness, absented himself from both.</P>
<P>After having been with them a few days,
during which this reserved and altered be∣haviour
almost broke the heart of Celestina,
who seemed to have lost, by the death of
the mother, the friendship of the son, he
sent up one of the female servants to her
room, when she retired thither after break∣fast,
to beg to speak to her in his sister's
dressing room. This formal message, so
unlike the brotherly familiarity with which
he used to treat her, cut her to the heart,
but she immediately attended the summons.</P>
<P>Willoughby bowed on her entrance.
They both fat down: Celestina trying to
check the tears she found rising to her eyes,
and the sighs which swelled her bosom.
His looks, so pale, so changed from what
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
they were, his attitude, his silence, all con∣tributed
to distress her; while he seemed
collecting fortitude to go through the task
he was to execute. After a short pause,
he took from his pocket book a paper,
opened it, and counted out three Bank
notes, of six hundred pounds each, on the
table; then advancing towards her with
them in his hand, he presented them to
her, saying in a voice which he did not
intend should faulter—"There, Madam,
is the sum which Mrs. Willoughby—which
my mother, by her will, bequeaths you,
and which, as her executor, I most wil∣lingly
pay you. Allow me to wish you
every happiness—and—" He would
have gone on: but Celestina, who had
arisen on his approaching her, turned pale
and sat down. "You are not well," said
he: "the recollection of my mother—"</P>
<P>"Does indeed overcome me," answered
Celestina. "<HI>I</HI> have lost a mother—and a
brother too—Yes! I have lost all!"</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45"/>
"Pardon me, Miss de Mornay," re∣plied
Willoughby, "I meant not to dis∣tress
you—and—"</P>
<P>"Miss de Mornay!" repeated Celestina,
again interrupting him—"<HI>Miss</HI> de Mor∣nay
and <HI>Madam.</HI> Ah! Mr. Willoughby!
those appellations of distant civility con∣vince
me that I have no longer a friend—a
brother—"</P>
<P>"Nay, but my dear Madam, be not,
I beseech you, guilty of so much injustice.
Let me execute the directions given me
by my dear deceased mother, whose or∣ders
you know were, that within two
months after her decease these should be
put in your possession." He then again
offered the notes to her.</P>
<P>Celestina put forth her trembling hand;
but instantly withdrew it.—"I cannot
take the notes indeed, Mr. Willoughby,"
said she. "What can I do with them?
I, who am a minor, a stranger, an or∣phan;
who have no relation, no guar∣dian—no
friend! I did indeed hope," con∣tinued
she, her eyes filling with tears from
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
the recollection of her forlorn situation—"I
did indeed hope that you, Sir, would
have had the goodness to have kept it for
me till—"</P>
<P>She stopped from inability to proceed.
"Till when, my dear Miss De Mornay?"
cried Willoughby with eagerness he seemed
endeavouring to check.—"Certainly I
would if it had been in my power; but it
was my solemn promise to my mother to
pay it into your hands, or into those of
any person whom you should appoint."</P>
<P>"And cannot I name <HI>you</HI> as being that
person?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, dear Celestina," an∣swered
Willoughby, speaking hastily, as if
fearful of relapsing into the fondness he
once felt, and desirous of quitting a pain∣ful
subject—"pardon me, it is not possible
for me to be of that service to you which
most assuredly I should rejoice to be if—"</P>
<P>"Dear Celestina!" replied she. "Ah!
Willoughby! I have seen for many, many
months, that I am no longer your once
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
dear sister Celestina. Call me Madam and
Miss de Mornay, as you did just now, ra∣ther
than flatter me with the sound, when
the sincerity of your regard is gone! Well
Sir! since, for reasons which perhaps I
ought not to penetrate, it is no longer in
<HI>your</HI> power to act by me as a brother and a
friend, I will no farther intrude on your
kindness than to beg you will tell me how
I ought to place the provision thus made
for me by my benefactress."</P>
<P>Willoughby half stifled a deep sigh; and
after a moment's pause said—"I would
advise you to place it immediately on go∣vernment
security, in the names of two
persons on whom you can rely, till you
become of age. Dawson, who was, you
know, always employed by my mother, is
more conversant than I am in these mat∣ters.
If you will give me leave I will send
him to you; and I am convinced you may
safely trust to his honor and probity."</P>
<P>He then again offered the notes he had
in his hand. Celestina took them in silence,
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
being in truth unable to speak; and turn∣ing
hastily away, he reached the door,
where he stopped as if irresolute; then in a
low and faultering voice he said—"As I
shall probably see you no more, unless in
mixed company, before I return to Cam∣bridge,
I cannot take this my last leave
without assuring you, that however cir∣cumstances
may, alas! <HI>must</HI> prevent my
shewing it, my heart can never be indif∣ferent
to the welfare—to the happiness of
my sister Celestina."</P>
<P>There was no time for the trembling
auditor to answer this address, to reflect on
the peculiar way in which the whole was
delivered, nor on the strong emphasis laid
on the words <HI>may</HI> and <HI>must;</HI> for he
was in a moment at the bottom of the
stairs, and Celestina, who remained in
breathless agitation, with the door of the
apartment still open, heard him a moment
afterwards call to his servant for his hat,
and the door of the house presently shut
after him. She then sat down and burst
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
into tears, for which she was, on a little
reflection, ashamed to assign a reason even
to herself. "For what do I weep," said
she—"or why am I disappointed? What
did I expect? that Willoughby was at∣tached
to me? Surely no! for he never
gave me any reason to imagine it, and of
late has sedulously avoided me, as if he
supposed me weak and vain enough to
misinterpret the friendship and regard he
used to shew me. Let me, while he does
stay, convince him that he may, without
prejudice to his views in regard to Miss
Fitz-Hayman, still treat me and consider
me as his sister, and that I never thought
of being looked upon otherwise, which
surely he must have fancied, or he would
not behave to me as he does!" Another
flood of tears relieved the swelling heart
of Celestina after this soliloquy. She then
dried her eyes, dressed, and acquired so
much command over herself as to meet
Willoughby at dinner without betraying
any symptoms of the uneasiness and morti∣fication
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
she still suffered; and when the
next day he took leave of her and Matilda,
she bade him adieu with the same appa∣rent
calmness.</P>
<P>Three months passed, and the time fixed
for Matilda's marriage arrived. Wil∣loughby
then wrote to desire his sister would
excuse his devoting only a single day to
her on that occasion: he would attend
he said to give her away, but was obliged
by indispensible business to return imme∣diately
afterwards to Cambridge. Matilda
remarked how strange it was that her bro∣ther,
who had now been some time of
age, was so bigotted to his books that he
could not leave them for longer than a
day even on such an occasion; but his
pleasures and her's differed so greatly, and
their tempers and pursuits were so opposite,
that no sympathy had for some years ex∣isted
between them; though on the part of
Willoughby there was always great affec∣tion
for her; and on her's, as much regard
for her brother as it was her nature to feel
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
for any body. This difference of senti∣ment
and inclination however had insensibly
so far estranged them from each other,
that the company of Willoughby was of∣tener
a restraint than a pleasure to his sister,
and therefore as she felt little regret in
losing it, she thought not much about his
motives for depriving her of it.</P>
<P>The evening before that on which Ma∣tilda
was by special licence to be married
to Mr. Molyneux, her brother arrived:
but instead of the gaiety the occasion re∣quired,
or even that which had formerly
been usual with him, his melancholy and
regret seemed to have become habitual by
indulgence. He hardly spoke: and when
he did, it was with such languor that Ma∣tilda
might with reason have been alarmed
for his health, if she had been capable of
attending seriously to any thing but her∣self.
Celestina, to whom he behaved with
more distant reserve than ever, could not
be insensible or silent about a health and
life which ought she thought to be so pre∣cious
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
to his sister and his friends, and there∣fore
she spoke to Matilda, when they re∣tired
after supper, of the change so evident
in her brother. Matilda answered coldly
that it was owing to nothing but his bury∣ing
himself as he did among his books,
and losing all relish for other company.
"I wish," added she, "that these Fitz-Haymans
were come over, that he might
live in the world again, and be like other
people, which he must be when he is mar∣ried."
Celestina could not heartily join in
this wish, and even doubted whether Wil∣loughby
ever would be quite like those
who were called "other people" by his
sister. She dropped the conversation how∣ever,
and retired to her pillow with more
solicitude for the happiness of Matilda,
which was to be determined the next day,
than Matilda was capable of feeling for
herself. The image of Willoughby, such
as he was a few years before, was strongly
painted by her imagination: she ran over
all their former early pleasures; their
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
walks, their reading, their gardening toge∣ther
at Alvestone while yet children; then
Willoughby, such as he now was, so amia∣ble
yet so changed, obtruded himself on
her mind; and being unable to look forward
with any degree of pleasure, she felt with
redoubled sorrow that those days of inno∣cent
confidence and ingenuous tenderness,
could never—never return!</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the party met the next day,
every body had left off their mourning,
and every face appeared cheerful but
those of Willoughby and Celestina: the
latter, when gaily rallied by the friends of
Mr. Molyneux, endeavoured to recover
her tranquillity; and as to Matilda herself,
she gave away her hand with as much ease
as if it was a matter of course. Molyneux
received it with equal composure; and as
soon as they were married, they sat out,
accompanied only by Celestina and Mr.
Hamilton, a near relation of the bride∣grooms,
for an house which Mr. Moly∣neux
rented in Hampshire. Willoughby
saluted his sister; and as he handed her into
the coach he again wished her happiness.
It was impossible to avoid doing the same
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
as Celestina passed him, but he faultered,
and could hardly articulate his compli∣ment,
which while he was yet tremulously
attempting to express, holding one of her
hands between his, Mr. Hamilton, who had
been detained by giving some orders to his
servant, came up, and taking her other
hand said—"Come, come! as you don't go
with us, Willoughby, the care of this lady
devolves upon me, and I shall not allow
these sorrowful partings to make her as me∣lancholy
as you are yourself all her journey."
Celestina was then unresistingly led away;
while Willoughby, who followed her to
the coach door, found at that moment his
heart assailed by pangs it had never felt
before, but which he knew too well to be
jealousy in its most corrosive form. As the
coach drove away, he stood looking after
it; now repenting that he had not accom∣panied
his sister and her husband into
Hampshire, then determining to order his
horse and follow them; now detesting Ha∣milton,
of whom he had never thought be∣fore,
and then resolving to conquer a
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
passion which a thousand circumstances
made it the height of folly to indulge.
The coach which contained the object of
it was already out of sight; but Willoughby
still stood on the spot from whence it had
been driven, so lost in the indulgence of
these sensations, that he forgot where he
was, and was roused from his reverie only
by the arrival of a friend with whom he
had made an appointment to go in his
chaise part of the way to Cambridge.</P>
<P>This friend he was ashamed to disappoint,
nor could he form any excuse to account
for his suddenly changing his mind and
following his sister, whom he had steadily
declined to accompany under pretence of
urgent engagements. While he yet de∣bated,
the chaise was ready, and with an
heart torn with contending passions, and a
mind intent only on Celestina and the
advantage Hamilton enjoyed of being so
long with her, as during the stay of Mo∣lyneux
in Hampshire and in the tour they
were afterwards to make, he proceeded,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
absent, silent, and miserable, to the end of
his journey.</P>
<P>Celestina with equal oppression of spirits
was yet more unfortunate, because she was
afraid of enquiring too narrowly into the
source of her concern, nor did she dare to
indulge it, but was compelled to assume
cheerfulness very foreign to her feelings.
Mr. Hamilton, who had never taken much
notice of her before, now seemed disposed
to amuse himself by coquetting with her;
but she had so little inclination to encou∣rage
him, that, as he was too perfectly a
man of the world to give himself much
trouble about any woman, he soon left her
to her own amusements. In a few days
after the bride and bridegroom arrived at
their house, it was filled with company;
and Matilda, wholly occupied with parties
all the morning, and play in the evening,
had never time to think of Celestina, who
soon found herself neglected by the only
person whom she could now call her
friend; and the disappointment which still
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
sat so heavy on her heart—the failure, as
she believed, of Willoughby's regard—was
now embittered by the coldness or rather
carelesness which she experienced from his
sister.</P>
<P>In a few weeks a party was made to visit
Plymouth and the Western bathing places.
Celestina went with them as a matter of
course, but she felt herself dwindling fast
into the humiliating character of a de∣pendent
companion, and sometimes fancied
that her place in the coach might have
been occupied by another more to the sa∣tisfaction
of her friend: yet Mrs. Molyneux
was never rude to her; and sometimes re∣lated
(with apparent kindness) how her
mother had adopted her from a convent,
and that therefore she ever should consider
her as her sister. Celestina always felt her∣self
more mortified than gratified by these
relations; and by degrees they became so
irksome to her, and the whole style of con∣versation
among Matilda's friends so little
to her taste, that she insensibly acquired
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
an habit of absenting herself, and of living
very much alone either in her own room
or in the walks which wherever the party
fixed she contrived to find, and whither
the image of Willoughby, such as it had
been at a very early period of her life
impressed on her young heart, incessantly
accompanied her. This was more parti∣cularly
the case when in the course of their
tour Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux undertook
to shew their friends Alvestone, where
Willoughby had ordered every thing to
be prepared for their reception as if he had
been himself there. Matilda re-visited
this beautiful place with no other emotions
than those of gratified pride; but on Celes∣tina
it had a very different effect: this
was the scene where the happiest, hours of
her life had passed. The dressing room
where they all used to assemble when the
only parent she had known was it's mistress,
brought her forcibly to the recollection of
Celestina. The chair on which she used
to sit, the furniture which she had worked
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
herself, and the pictures she had collected,
were so many memorials on which Celestina
could not look without recollecting a thou∣sand
instances of her general goodness or
her particular tenderness, and feeling with
bitter regret the irreparable loss she had
sustained. The park and the gardens too
furnished her with many sources of painful
contemplation, mingled however with a
degree of melancholy so soothing, that
nothing would have been to her so great
a punishment as being obliged to exchange
it for the desultory and uninteresting con∣versation,
which, in the little time spared
from the card table, engaged the party
within the house.</P>
<P>The party however troubled themselves
very little with her; and she was left at
liberty to retrace the walks which she had
so often traversed with Willoughby while
Matilda leaned on one arm and she on the
other, and to gaze on the prospects which
he, while yet a boy, had pointed out to
them with so much pleasure. She remem∣bered
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
all the proposed improvements of
which he delighted to talk. A rapid stream
bursting from the hollow of a rocky com∣mon
that bounded the park, and made its
way through it, had been by the former
Mr. Willoughby widened at a great ex∣pence,
and now fell several feet into a vale
which he had at a still greater cost, floated
with water. On the sides of this fall, which
had been formerly part of the common,
grew some old oaks and beech, and among
these the mountain ash and weeping birch
had been planted and now spread their
various foliage and half concealed the wa∣ter
that dashed from rock to rock between
them. These steep banks had ever been
the favourite seats of Willoughby; who
there sitting between his two sisters, and
holding each of their hands, had very fre∣quently
amused himself with projects to
encrease the roar of the water or deepen
the shade of the wood that fringed it's side.
This place was the daily resort of Celestina
during the week she remained at Alvestone
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
and thither she usually carried some of
those books from the library that she re∣membered
Willoughby had read to her.
These were principally poetry: and the re∣perusal
of them, the place, the season, a
thousand tender remembrances enforced
by each, served at once to soften and de∣press
an heart naturally tender and affec∣tionate,
which, deprived of almost every
other object of it's regard, cherished with
painful pleasure the idea of Willoughby,
such as he once was, and when they passed
here so many innocent enchanting hours.
But when she imagined that in a few months
he would probably re-visit these scenes
with another, with Miss Fitz-Hayman,
who would then be his wife, and that she
herself should never again be admitted to
wander among them with their beloved
master, sick despondence took possession
of her soul, and it was with difficulty after
these reflections that she could reassume
courage enough to mix with the friends
whom Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux had assem∣bled
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
to listen to insipid pleasantry and at∣tend
to uninteresting conversation.</P>
<P>But whatever regret Celestina felt in re∣collecting
past hours of felicity which she
knew could never return, she left Alve∣stone
with extreme reluctance, and had it
been proper, or possible, would most wil∣lingly
have remained there alone. In
quitting it never to return, she felt almost as
much concern as she had done when in
taking leave of Willoughby she fancied
that she should see him no more till he was
married to Miss Fitz-Hayman.</P>
<P>Of that match Mrs. Molyneux now
very frequently spoke as a matter entirely
settled, and Celestina no longer doubted
of it's speedy completion. This circum∣stance,
(which gave her uneasiness that she
was unable either to repress or entirely to
disguise), the encreasing indifference of
Matilda towards her, and the constant suc∣cession
of company in which Mr. and Mrs.
Molyneux lived, united to raise in her a
wish to quit them; and finding that the
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
hints she gave of such a disposition were
received with perfect carelesness, and that
such a removal would probably not be
objected to, she every day grew fonder of
her project, and during their stay at Sid∣mouth
fixed on a cottage about four miles
from it, where she thought she might re∣side,
if not happily at least in that quiet
obscurity which her circumstances rendered
prudent, and her distaste to the world in
which she now lived, pleasant. She found
that she could there be accommodated
with board and lodging, and there she
would now have remained if Mrs. Moly∣neux
had not, when she understood her
project, insisted on her returning to Lon∣don
with her after finishing their tour.—"Go
with me however," said she, "the
rest of our journey, and till we meet the
Castlenorths, who are to be in town in
October; and then if you have this rural
passion still so strong upon you, you shall
take your own way." Though there was
little appearance of affection in this invi∣tation,
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
Celestina thought she ought not to
decline it, and therefore, though meeting
the Castlenorths was what she most soli∣citously
wished to avoid, she determined
to go with her friend to town, that she
might not give her any pretence for for∣getting
her entirely, or incur the censure
of the world for leaving abruptly the only
protection she could claim.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE return of Mr. and Mrs. Moly∣neux
to London was postponed from time
to time till November. Lord Castlenorth
had been too ill to set out on his journey to
England at the time he proposed, and the
family meeting which was to settle all that
related to the marriage was now delayed
till after Christmas. Willoughby however
testified no impatience: he had promised
to meet his sister and her husband in town
on their arrival; but instead of doing so,
he sent such an insufficient excuse as must
have appeared very strange to Matilda
had she thought much about it; but im∣mersed
in pleasures and pursuits of her
own, she gave herself very little time to re∣flect
on her brother's conduct, and was
far from supposing that he absented him∣self
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
because he could not see Celestina
without encreasing and confirming a pas∣sion
which he had many reasons against
indulging, and of which he was determined
to cure himself by absence and reflection.
The negociation with his uncle, which
had been carried so far by his mother, he
neither declined nor forwarded; but suf∣fered
it to remain nearly on the footing she
had left it, flattering himself that by the
time Miss Fitz-Hayman arrived in London,
he should have so far conquered his early
attachment as to have an heart as well as
the hand, which he had promised to his
mother's entreaties, to offer her.</P>
<P>Though his endeavours to forget Celes∣tina
had hitherto been quite unsuccessful,
he had however acquired so much resolu∣tion
as to determine not to see her, till the
arrival of his destined wife, and the final
settlement of every thing that related to
his marriage, should put it out of his power
to break the engagement he had made to
Mrs. Willoughby in her last hours, and to
sacrifice every thing to his passion. The
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
struggle he underwent however was dread∣ful,
and by continually repeating to him∣self
the necessity there was for his forgetting
Celestina, he so accustomed himself to
think of her, that he in reality soon ceased
to think with interest of any body else;
and though he endeavoured to persuade
himself that he should have courage to
acquit himself of what he tried to think his
duty to his family, to his mother's me∣mory,
and himself, there was no intelligence
he so much dreaded as that of the arrival
of his uncle's family in England.</P>
<P>Celestina on her part, passed her time in
a way very unpleasant to her. Mrs. Moly∣neux,
now mistress of herself, plunged
into unceasing dissipation; and as Celestina
was frequently desired to accompany her,
and always to make one of the parties she
collected at her own house, she found that
the expences of dress alone would greatly
exceed the income of her little fortune,
and that she should soon exhaust it to live
among people whose society gave her no
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
pleasure, and who for the most part consi∣dered
her only as she was capable of filling
up a table or the corner of a coach when
it was vacant. Her quickness of appre∣hension
and extreme sensibility made her
too frequently remark, that the table or the
coach might in the apprehension of Matilda
always be as well, and sometimes better
filled; and these observations, together
with her growing dislike to Mr. Molyneux,
and the people with whom he associated,
who not unfrequently treated her with the
impertinent familiarity which they thought
themselves at liberty to use towards Mrs.
Molyneux's <HI>companion,</HI> renewed, before she
had been six weeks in town, her wish to
quit them for ever, and to enjoy in her
own way the small independence given her
by her lamented benefactress.</P>
<P>The certainty that Miss Fitz-Hayman
was so soon to become the wife of the only
man for whom she ever had felt the least
degree of partiality, hastened the execution
of her project. She now heard every day
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
of the great beauty, the extraordinary ac∣complishments,
and the immense fortune
of the future bride, while Mrs. Molyneux
was exercising her fancy on the equipages,
and other preparations which were so soon
to be on foot for the wedding of her bro∣ther;
a subject that Celestina always listened
to with impatience, which, though she with
difficulty concealed it from others, she was
painfully conscious of herself. The eter∣nal
harangues of Mrs. Molyneux on taste
and elegance had always been fatiguing to
her, but she was more than usually dis∣gusted
when the purpose of these lectures
was to decide upon or to describe the bri∣dal
fineries intended for Willoughby and
Miss Fitz-Hayman.</P>
<P>A letter now arrived from Lady Castle-north
announcing her intentions of being
in London with her Lord and her daughter
the following week; and at this intelli∣gence
Celestina, no longer hesitating, wrote
to the person near Sidmouth, to whom she
had spoken the preceding summer; and
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
finding she could be immediately received
at the lodging she had then looked at,
she packed up and sent by the waggon
the small collection of books given her
by Mrs. Willoughby, which with her
cloaths and the legacy vested in the funds,
were all her worldly possessions; and that
evening after supper, when by a chance
very unusual with them Mr. and Mrs. Mo∣lyneux
were without company, she declared
her intentions of going into the country
the next day.</P>
<P>Mr. Molyneux, twirling about a wine
glass and humming a tune, seemed to at∣tend
very little to the information; his
wife, after hearing it with almost equal in∣difference,
said—"I cannot imagine, my
dear, why you think of going into the
country now, or what you propose by it."</P>
<P>"Nothing more," replied Celestina,
piqued at the coldness of her manner,
"than to accustom myself at once to a
mode of life which my narrow fortune ren∣ders,
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
if not absolutely necessary, at least
highly prudent."</P>
<P>"Prudence," cried Molyneux with a
smile which Celestina thought a contemptu∣ous
one, "is an acquisition very unusual
at eighteen: but a girl of spirit, with so
pretty a person as your's is, should be ra∣ther
ambitious than prudent, and should
try to make her fortune by marriage instead
of hiding herself in the country. Num∣berless
young women about town have
done extremely well, who, without any com∣pliment,
have not had your share of beauty."</P>
<P>"Very possibly, Sir," replied Celestina;
"but unless my mind was disposed as
their minds probably were, which I believe
it never will be, the personal advantages
you so flatteringly allow me, will never ob∣tain
the affluence you think so desirable."</P>
<P>"What do you mean to say?" answered
he. "What! do you pretend that you
would not marry as other women do for
money or title?"</P>
<P>"For neither, upon my honor."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73"/>
"Pooh! I thought you had more sense;
but since it is so, my dear Celestina, I wish
you all possible felicity in your new plan
of pastoral amusement, and doubt not but
that some tender and amiable Philander, in
the shape of a young west country curate,
will enable you to realize to your heart's
content all your ideas of disinterested love
and rural happiness."</P>
<P>Molyneux then sauntered away, and his
lady looking in a pocket mirror, and pick∣ing
her teeth with the nicest care, took up
the argument.</P>
<P>"You know Celestina that I have the
greatest regard in the world for you, and
that I have argued with you for ever about
this nonsensical resolution, which I cannot
imagine what put into your head. You
will be tired to death child, in the country
at this time of the year. However if you
will go, do stay here at least till after my
brother is married. We shall have half the
world with us then, and I shall want you
for twenty things."</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74"/>
At the mention of Willoughby's mar∣riage,
Celestina, though so much accustomed
to hear of it, changed colour, and her
voice as well as her look might have be∣trayed
the uneasy sensations she felt, if
Mrs. Molyneux had not been always too
much occupied by herself to attend very
narrowly to another.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, dear Madam," said Ce∣lestina,
"I certainly cannot be wanted on
that occasion. You will have so many
other friends about you that I shall not be
missed; and I have no right, indeed I
never had any, to be upon an equality with
the persons who will then be assembled
about you. Let me therefore find my
own place in society, and learn at once to
submit to it."</P>
<P>After some other conversation, Celestina,
still unwilling to appear in the slightest de∣gree
ungrateful for past kindness or too
impatient of her present situation, agreed
to stay another week in town; and retired
to her own room relieved by having thus
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
declared her intentions, and fixed the time
when her present uneasy state of depend∣ance
would be at an end.</P>
<P>But of this delay she repented, when the
next day notice was received by Mrs. Mo∣lyneux
of the arrival of Lord and Lady
Castlenorth at their house in Grosvenor∣street.
Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux instantly
waited on them; the next evening they
were to return the visit in form; and
thus Celestina was compelled to be present
at a meeting she had been studiously endea∣vouring
to avoid.</P>
<P>Lord Castlenorth was one of those un∣fortunate
beings, who have been brought
up never to have a wish unprevented or a
want ungratified. He was born when his
father was far advanced in life, the sole
heir to one of the most ancient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Hayman, Earl of Glocester, came in with
the Conqueror, the heiress of which family married
a natural son of Henry I. by Nesla, daughter of
Rhees Prince of South Wales.</NOTE> families
and opulent fortunes in England; and was
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
of so much consequence, that till he was
near eighteen he was hardly ever suffered
out of the sight of his father. He was
then released by death from the officious
affection which had long been very trou∣blesome
to him; and with every thing on
his side but a good constitution, he sat
out on a wild career of pleasure, in which,
before he had materially hurt his fortune,
he was stopped by the apprehension of de∣clining
health. His figure was one of those
which look as if
<Q>The blasts of January would blow them thro'
and thro';</Q>
and the irregularities of his life had so
much impaired a habit naturally weak,
that at thirty he was a mere shadow, and
then was told by his physicians that he
must resolve on a residence of some time
in the South of Europe if he would avoid
going to that country "from whose bourn
no traveller returns:" to which having
an invincible aversion, he lost not a mo∣ment
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
in complying with their advice. But
as he soon recovered some degree of health,
he grew every day less attentive to injunc∣tions
they had given as to his manner
of life; and relapsing into his former
indiscretions, he was again reduced to ex∣tremities,
and when very little hope of his
life remained, was recommended by one of
his medical friends in London to put him∣self
under the care of Dr. Maclaurin, a
Scottish physician, who had been settled for
two or three years at Naples with his wife
and family.</P>
<P>There he was treated with the most assi∣duous
attention, not only by the Doctor
himself but by Mrs. Maclaurin and her
daughter, then near thirty, who was so rea∣sonable
as to allow herself to be five and
twenty. She was tall, and had a tolerable
face, with which her ambition to be ad∣mired,
suffered her not to be content in it's
natural state. She had been brought up
to attend most sedulously to her own inte∣rest,
and to pursue the establishment of her
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
fortune by marriage: she had therefore
learned early to fawn and flatter; and to
the cunning of her mother united some
portion of the abilities of her father. Mrs.
Maclaurin was one of that species of beings
who are by courtesy denominated good
sort of women. All her virtues were ne∣gative;
and of the few vices she had it in
her power to practise, she contented her∣self
with malice and defamation, and even
in those she never indulged herself unless
very certain that the objects were incapable
of retort and totally defenceless. She had
now however but little opportunity of gra∣tification;
for though she had lived three
years in Italy, she understood not a word
of the language, and her attempts to amend
the world being therefore made, in one not
understood by those in whose favor they
were exerted, were very little compre∣hended,
and of course failed of affording
her much satisfaction. Her talents being
thus perforce confined to her own houshold,
had taken another turn, and had been ap∣plied
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
to the acquisition of money, and of
securing a good match for her daughter.</P>
<P>The Doctor, though really a man of
some abilities, had not hitherto been suc∣cessful
enough in his profession to be ena∣bled
to give her a fortune: the project of
marrying her well was equally interesting
to him; and among the various patients
he had received into his house since he re∣sided
at Naples, the elder son of a very
opulent merchant in London, and an old
Baronet, who had several daughters older
than Miss Maclaurin, very narrowly escaped
her multiform attractions by the impertinent
remonstrances of their families.</P>
<P>Lord Castlenorth had no relations but
Mrs. Willoughby, who was very unlikely
to interfere in any matrimonial project; he
had besides a much larger fortune, and was
of a much higher rank, than any of those
for whom the family of Maclaurin had in∣tended
the honor of their alliance; but the
very circumstances which rendered the pros∣pect
of such a marriage most alluring,
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
seemed to preclude the probability of suc∣cess.</P>
<P>Among the few things Lord Castlenorth
had learned of his father, the principal was
to value himself on his descent; and, as
far as related to his own family, he was a
genealogist almost as soon as he could speak.
As he advanced in life, he found himself
of so little consequence for individual me∣rit,
that he was compelled to avail himself
of the names of his ancestors, from whom
only he derived any importance at all;
and the "puny insect shivering at a breeze,"
swelled with conscious pride when he recited
the names of heroes from whom he had so
woefully degenerated.</P>
<P>This pride of ancestry was now the most
distinguishing feature in a character where
it appeared with the greatest prominence,
from the faintness and insipidity of the
other traits, for being no longer able to
pursue the dissolute manner of life which
he had adopted rather from fashion than in∣clination,
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
he had now in other respects no
character at all.</P>
<P>Miss Maclaurin, who began to study
him as soon as he was received by her fa∣ther,
soon saw it, and saw it with dismay;
for she supposed that it would be an insu∣perable
bar to those hopes, which she
thought she might otherwise very reasonably
entertain.</P>
<P>The Doctor however had too many re∣sources
to be so easily discouraged. He
fabricated with admirable ingenuity a story,
of which he justly supposed the ignorance
and indolence of his patient would prevent
his ever detecting the falsehood. He said
that he was really a Hamilton, and had
taken his present name in compliance with
the whim of a distant relation, who had on
that condition given him his property.
The only objection being thus removed,
Miss Maclaurin had a fair field for her at∣tractive
talents; and they were so effectually
exerted, that in about five months after
Lord Castlenorth's reception into the family
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
of Maclaurin, he became himself a member
of it, and Miss Maclaurin returned to Eng∣land
as his wife.</P>
<P>That her father might still retain, with∣out
too scrupulous an enquiry, his relation∣ship
to the house of Hamilton, and that
her mother's coarse figure and coarser man∣ners
might be no disgrace to Lady Castle∣north
in the sphere where she now prepared
to blaze, she prevailed upon them to retire
to their native country on a pension which
there gave them consequence: while her
Ladyship, who while she was Miss Mac∣laurin
had nothing doubted of her own
eminent perfections, was now so convinced
of their irresistible power by their having
thus established her in a situation so much
above her hopes, that she thought herself
born for the government and amendment
of the world, and from that period had
been advancing inarrogance and ostentation
till the present hour; when at the age of
fifty, with an unweildy person and a broad
face, where high cheek bones appeared
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
emulous of giving some protection to two
grey prominent eyes, whose lids seemed
inadequate to shade them, Lady Castle∣north
was as well by her rank as her ta∣lents
and her travels, qualified in her own
opinion for universal dominion. Not con∣tent
therefore with governing her Lord
with despotic sway, (which indeed saved
him the trouble and probably the disgrace
of governing himself) she assumed towards
the rest of the world a style equally dicta∣torial.
Her opinion was strongly enforced
on every topic that came before her; in
private anecdote, in public debates, in
literature, in politics, in fashions, she was
equally omniscient; and whether the con∣versation
ran on taxes or on taste, in laying
out grounds or on setting out a dinner, in
making a peace or a poem, she understood
all, descanted on all, and could decide
on all, in a way from which few of her
auditors had at the moment courage to ap∣peal.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
By the side of this majestic figure, her
Lord, the descendant of the old Earls of
Gloucester, of Welsh Princes and English
Kings, sunk into insignificance. His di∣minutive
figure, now shrunk by age and
sickness, his sallow and withered counte∣nance,
and his feeble step, formed a de∣cided
contrast to his robust and Juno-like
lady, by whom he suffered himself to be
led about, without ever pretending to dis∣sent
from her opinion, unless in matters of
heraldry or genealogy, where he still ven∣tured
to take the lead, in which she was
for the most part willing to indulge him.
His Lordship's ill health had made him
also conversant in physic; a science in
which, notwithstanding her hereditary claim
to it, Lady Castlenorth had not shewn much
disposition to contend with him: but as
there was more trouble and disgust than
honour to be obtained by a constant atten∣tion
to it, as applied to his real or ima∣ginary
complaints, she had very frequently
delegated her authority, and at length
quite relinquished her knowledge, to a
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
relation, who being a widow (and said to
possess a pretty fortune though nobody ever
knew where it lay) now about six and forty,
had with infinite philanthropy dedicated
her days to relieve the infirmities of her
fellow creatures without any other advan∣tage
than that of being received in turn
at their houses. She knew every receipt,
whether of diet or medicine, that could be
named, as preventative or cure; understood
the preparation of every quack remedy,
and the qualities of all the drugs of which
they are compounded: nor was she less
acquainted with the human frame; and
would in all companies give the history of
any complaint to which it is subject in
technical terms, to the wonder of some
and the terror of many hearers. Such were
the manners of Mrs. Calder; and her per∣son
was one of those, which but for their
singularity, nobody would ever recollect
as having seen at all. She now resided
almost constantly with Lord and Lady
Castlenorth, to both of whom she had con∣trived
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
to render herself necessary. With
them she had been abroad, (where she had
greatly improved her stock of knowledge,
and had actually written a treatise on the
goitres of the Alpine peasants, which Lady
Castlenorth was polishing for publication,)
and she was now of the party who were
assembled at Mrs. Molyneux's; where the
last but not the least in consequence ap∣peared
also—the destined bride of Wil∣loughby.</P>
<P>The claim of this young lady to eminent
beauty, or to any thing more than a barely
tolerable person, would certainly not have
been allowed, had she not been heiress to
the illustrious house of Fitz-Hayman; but
the escutcheon of pretence, which she had a
right to, seemed to give her a pretence also,
to much of what nature had very scantily
allowed her. She was as tall and almost
as large as her mother, whom she greatly
resembled. Her complexion was brown,
and as her hair was not dark, the want of
contrast produced a muddy and heavy
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
effect, which nothing could have relieved
but two dark eyes, whose powers were
assisted by a greater quantity of rouge than
unmarried ladies are even by the French
customs usually allowed. What expression
they naturally had however was not pleas∣ing,
and what they borrowed from this ad∣dition
added more to their fierceness than
their lustre. They were eyes of "high
claims and expectations," which demanded
rather than solicited admiration, and signi∣fied
pretty plainly the real disposition of a
character, inflated with ideas of it's own con∣sequence,
and considering more than half
the world as beings of another species,
whose evils she could not feel for, because
she was placed where it was impossible she
could ever share them.</P>
<P>To the personal arrogance of her mother,
she added the hereditary pride of her fa∣ther:
the first had taught her that hardly
any man could deserve so perfect and ac∣complished
a creature; the second, that it
was more desirable to unite herself with
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
Willoughby, and thus continue her own il∣lustrious
race, than lose or share her con∣sequence
by marrying a nobleman of supe∣rior
rank. Some degree of personal partiality
too, contributed to render this resolution
more pleasing to her; for though she had
not seen her cousin for between three and
four years, his graceful and beautiful form
when he left Eton, with his dark auburn
hair flowing over his shoulders, had made
a very lasting impression in his favor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH was the group, which, at a very
late hour in the evening, entered the din∣ing-room
of Mrs. Molyneux, who, with
her husband and Celestina, received them
in the usual forms. Lady Castlenorth, as
usual, took the lead in conversation, having
first satisfied herself that Mrs. Molyneux
had sent for Willoughby, and heard her
assurances that he would certainly be in
town the first moment he possibly could af∣ter
hearing of the arrival of his noble re∣lations.</P>
<P>"What sort of taste, my dear," cried
her Ladyship to Mrs. Molyneux, "is this
apartment fitted up in?—Is this the pre∣sent
style in England?—I think it ex∣tremely
ugly."</P>
<P>This was trenching on Matilda in a very
tender point. Taste was her reigning foi∣ble;
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
and the house had, on her recent
marriage, been fitted up under her direc∣tions
at an immense expence. To have
her elegance called so abruptly in question,
therefore, was very far from being pleasant,
and she answered coldly—"I am sorry you
dislike it: it is, I believe, the newest style
of doing rooms. To what does your La∣dyship
object?"</P>
<P>"Oh, to the whole. These sort of pa∣pers
are unclassical and glaring: I don't
like the colour of your furniture neither."</P>
<P>"Nor I," interrupted Mrs. Calder; "'tis
terrible for the eyes: does not your Lordship
find it dazzling and inconvenient even by
candle-light?" She then began to explain
the effect of glaring and strong colours on
the visual orb, when Lady Castlenorth,
who had no intention to throw the conver∣sation
into her hands, turned abruptly to∣wards
Celestina, of whom she had hitherto
taken no notice, and said, looking steadily
at her while she addressed Mrs. Molyneux,
"That, I think, is the young woman whom
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
your late mother <HI>said</HI> she took out of a con∣vent
somewhere in France, is it not?"
Mrs.Molyneux answering in the affirmative,
Lady Castlenorth, her eyes still fixed on
the object of her enquiry, said, "Aye, I
thought I recollected her:—Umph!—and
so Mrs. Willoughby provided for her, did
she?—Well! and is she to live on with
you, as she did in your mother's time?"</P>
<P>"Only a few days longer, Madam," said
Celestina, who had borne very impatiently
this rude and unfeeling scrutiny; "I am
then going to reside entirely in the coun∣try."</P>
<P>"I am glad of it, child," replied the
lady; for I always consider it as a misfor∣tune
when girls are educated above their
fortune, and introduced into a style of life
they have no pretensions to. Indeed, I
gave Mrs. Willoughby my opinion about
you repeatedly in your infancy. I did not
then know that her circumstances allowed
her, in justice to <HI>her husband's</HI> children, to
provide so amply for another. However,
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
though it was a great deal for her to do, it
is not by any means a fortune to authorise
you with prudence to continue to live
about town. You took, I think, your
Christian name from the order of Nuns
among whom you were reared; and your
surname—I mean the name they gave
you—it has escaped me?"</P>
<P>"My name, Madam," said Celestina,
whose tears were restrained only by indig∣nation,
"is De Mornay."</P>
<P>"True; I recollect it now. I remem∣ber
I enquired of Mrs. Willoughby, whe∣ther
when they gave you that name they
had any reason to fancy you any way re∣lated
to the family of the famous du Plessis
Mornay; but I think she told me no, and
that you received that appellation because
the Superior to whose care you were en∣trusted had some fanciful partiality to the
name."</P>
<P>To this no answer being given the con∣versation
took another turn, but was still
engrossed by Lady Castlenorth; while Mrs.
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
Molyneux, wearied to death, proposed cards,
and making a table with the noble pair,
Mrs. Calder, and her husband, she sat
down herself by Miss Fitz-Hayman, and
endeavoured to enter into conversation with
her.</P>
<P>Miss Fitz-Hayman however, who never
loved her cousin because she had heard her
reckoned handsome, and who was out of
humour to find that Willoughby was not
yet arrived, though there was barely time
for him to have come express, received all
her advances with more than her usual
haughty indifference; and while she an∣swered
in short sentences or mere mono∣syllables,
she now examined with looks of
dislike the studied but becoming dress of
Mrs. Molyneux, now, with yet more un∣pleasant
expression, glanced with averted
head, from the corners of her eyes, on Ce∣lestina,
who without any study at all was
infinitely more beautiful.</P>
<P>These scowling looks of mingled malig∣nity
and contempt, added to the behaviour
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
of Lady Castlenorth towards her, had by
this time rendered the room so disagreeable
to her, that she left it as soon as she could.
A loud rap at the door however soon after
announced the arrival of other visitors; and
some ladies coming in who had finished
their circle of visits for that evening, Mrs.
Molyneux, as tired of the daughter's si∣lence
as she had before been of the mother's
loquacity, proposed a table at <HI>vingt un,</HI>
which Celestina was immediately desired to
join.</P>
<P>The party were hardly placed at it, be∣fore
Mr. Molyneux was informed by his
gentleman that Mr. Willoughby was be∣low
and asked to speak to him. "Desire
him to come up," replied he, without any
seeming consciousness of the formidable na∣ture
of the interview he was to go through.</P>
<P>"He is in boots, Sir," replied the ser∣vant,
"and desired me to say that he is
going immediately to his lodgings."</P>
<P>"Oh but we shall not let him go,"
said Molyneux. "Do Mrs. Molyneux,"
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
continued he, addressing himself to his
wife, "do go down and bring up this
brother of your's."</P>
<P>Mrs. Molyneux rose and left the room.
Lady Castlenorth, still appearing to attend
to her game, turned her fiercely-question∣ing
eyes, first on her daughter, who might
have blushed if her complexion had been
calculated to shew the suffusion of blood,
and then unluckily they were attracted by
the more unequivocal and deep rose co∣lour,
which for a moment took possession
of the face of Celestina, who sat next to her.</P>
<P>There was no time to comment on this
appearance before it was heightened by the
entrance of Willoughby, who was imme∣diately
led by his sister to Lord Castlenorth,
then to her Ladyship, and at length to
Miss Fitz-Hayman. He paid his compli∣ments
to all with his usual graceful man∣ners,
but not without an expression of pain
and embarrassment in his countenance,
which he seemed vainly trying to shake off.
He had yet distinguished nobody in the
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
room but those to whom he had been
speaking; but on recovering from the low
bow he had made to Miss Fitz-Hayman,
he saw Celestina; and starting, he said in
a hurrying way—"Miss De Mornay! I
thought you had left my sister! I hope I
see you well!" Celestina answered only by
a curtsey; and Willoughby, turning away
towards Mrs. Molyneux, told her that he
was a good deal fatigued, and must beg
her to excuse him for the rest of the even∣ing,
but that he would be with her the
following morning to breakfast. "Your
Lordship," added he turning to his uncle,
"will perhaps allow me to pay my respects
to you and Lady Castlenorth in the course
of the morning:" then without waiting
for the reply which his Lordship was in
great form waiting to give him, he hurried
out of the room, and the card tables very
soon afterwards broke up.</P>
<P>Though Willoughby was very much
altered since Miss Fitz-Hayman had last
seen him, the change appeared greatly in
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
his favour. His undress, and the agitation
he was apparently in, which she imputed
to the effect of her charms, combined to
make him appear more interesting both to
the mother and daughter; and as they went
home, Lord Castlenorth, who grew every
day fonder of the proposed marriage,
spoke much in praise of his nephew's fi∣gure
and manner. He has a great deal,
said he, of the family countenance. He
strikes me, indeed he always did from a
boy, as resembling greatly the picture
painted on board of William, son of Ro∣bert
Fitz-Hayman, Seneschal to Henry II.
who obtained the grants of the estate in
Gloucestershire. His arms were azure, a
lion rampant, gardant or; the original
bearing of the family; you see it so in the
great window of the hall at Castlenorth:
the next is that of his wife, party per pale,
two griffins counter sailant, sable, langued
gules. This is my first quarter for the
name of Bigot, a daughter of which house,
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
this William, son of Robert, married."
Lord Castlenorth was now got on his
favourite topic, and in the numberless quar∣terings
of his present bearing, he quite for∣got
the merits of his nephew, and was
busied among wyverns and boars, pearls,
saltiers, fesses and bend dexters, till they
arrived at their own house. The imagina∣tions
however of the rest of the company
finding nothing to arrest them in a detail
so often repeated, had all left him to settle
his chevrons and chevronels his own way;
even the attentive and complaisant Mrs.
Calder was considering whether a lady in
the company they had left, who had re∣lated
her complaints to her, was in a right
course of medicine; Lady Castlenorth was
laying up a little magazine of literature,
which she intended to open on Willoughby
the next day; and her daughter was con∣templating
in her mind's eye, the hand∣some
person of Willoughby, the figure
they should make at Court, and the tri∣umph
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
there would be, when without de∣grading
herself, by an unequal alliance in
point of family, she should notwithstand∣ing
carry to her husband so splendid a
fortune, and titles so ancient and illus∣trious.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE party the noble visitors had left
were very differently employed: Mrs.
Molyneux, almost always accustomed to
be heard with attention and submitted to
with deference as a beauty and a woman
of exquisite taste, was piqued and offended
by the air of superior intelligence assumed
by Lady Castlenorth, who treated her like
a child that knew nothing. Miss Fitz-Hayman
too had not expressed any admi∣ration
at her dress and figure, but had
viewed her with supercilious silence; while
Mrs. Calder, from knowing her to be a
young married woman, had with more cu∣riosity
than elegance enquired whether she
was likely to give the Molyneux family
the heir so much desired by the older part
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
of it; a question which extremely disgusted
her. Lord Castlenorth, (who had compli∣mented
her upon her person, particularly
on her long Chinese eyes, and the form of
her face, which he said was extremely like
that of Gertrude Fitz-Hayman, some time
Maid of Honor to Catharine of Arragon and
afterwards Countess of Powis,) was, she
declared to Mr. Molyneux, the only tole∣rable
creature of the party. "My uncle,"
said she, as soon as they were alone, "my
uncle is a reasonable being; but for the
rest! did you ever see a plainer woman
than Miss Fitz-Hayman? her cloaths might
be French, but I am sure she looks abso∣lutely
Dutch in them. It's really a mis∣fortune
at her time of life to be so large."</P>
<P>Molyneux carelessly answered—"You
see she is sensible of the misfortune by her
endeavours to conceal it: but 'tis more
witty than wise, I think, to find fault with
her. Willoughby <HI>can see</HI> I suppose as well
as you can, and I don't think it very po∣litic
in you to give him your authority for
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
disliking her. Let him marry her, and
then hate and abuse her as much as you
will."</P>
<P>"Oh!" replied the lady, "I shall al∣ways
detest her, and—"</P>
<P>"So I dare say will he," interrupted
Molyneux; "but let them be once mar∣ried,
and all that is very immaterial to you:
it is by no means so, that your brother
cannot, till he does marry, pay the second
five thousand pounds of your fortune, un∣less
he sells the Withcombe estate, which
indeed the mortgagee is, as far as I can
learn, very impatient to take possession of
with this charge upon it, which he will
immediately pay off. You see that Wil∣loughby
has no choice—matrimony or the
dismembering his estates; and pray never
put it into his head to hesitate." This af∣fectionate
brother in law then went to his
own dressing room, and Mrs. Molyneux
taking a candle, surveying herself in the
great glass, and wondering how it was pos∣sible
such a figure and face could fail to at∣tract
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
universal admiration from all ages and
sexes, retired to her bed.</P>
<P>The contemplations of poor Celestina,
who had left them the moment the com∣pany
dispersed, were much more painful.
The sight of Willoughby, his surprize, and,
as she thought, his displeasure at finding
her still there, were as poisoned arrows in
her breast. But the pride of conscious
worth, aided by her disinterested affection
for him, enabled her, though not to heal,
yet to endure without weak complainings,
the exquisite pain they inflicted, and to give
her courage immediately to execute the
design she had long formed of withdrawing
herself from his sight for ever. It was now
impossible for her to set out the next day,
but that immediately following it she fixed
for her departure; and after a night in which
she enjoyed very little repose, she arose
early in order to make the immediate pre∣parations
for her journey, which she deter∣mined,
in order to save expence, to make
in the Exeter stage.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104"/>
As she was desirous of giving as little
trouble as possible to Mr. Molyneux's ser∣vants,
who were all people of great conse∣quence
and would any of them have
thought such a commission degrading, she
determined to go herself into the city,
where places were to be taken. It was yet
so early when she went down to execute
this intention, that only the housemaid was
stirring, and the windows of the parlour
only were opened: there Celestina sat
while the maid went into the kitchen to
get her a glass of milk and water, which
she had asked for; and while she yet trifled
with it, being indeed afraid to venture into
the streets till she saw more people in them,
she heard the servant, who was at the door
dusting the hall and steps, speak to some∣body
who entered, and the instant after∣wards
Willoughby came into the room
where she was.</P>
<P>She arose trembling and amazed from
her seat. "Miss De Mornay," said he,
"so early prepared to go out?" Celestina
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
answered—"yes," and sat down again.
He laid down his hat on the side board;
and as if he knew not what to say, went to
the window.</P>
<P>Celestina sat motionless; and Willough∣by,
after standing there a moment, seemed
ashamed of his silence yet afraid to speak.
He traversed the room, mended the fire,
and complaining of the cold, at length
ventured to enquire of Celestina what in∣duced
her to venture out at so early an
hour of so unpleasant a morning? She
replied calmly, for she had by this time
regained her composure, that she had busi∣ness
in the city.</P>
<P>"Business in the city!" cried Wil∣loughby;
"and at this time of the day!
Ah! Celestina! there was a time when you
would not thus have answered my enquiry."
He was going on, when Celestina inter∣rupted
him:</P>
<P>"There was indeed," said she with a
deep sigh, "a time when you would not
have made it."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106"/>
"Not have made it!" answered he;
"was I not then ever interested in all that
concerned you, and was any action of
your's indifferent to me?"</P>
<P>He faultered and stopped. "I was once
simple enough to think so indeed," said
Celestina, "and in those days of fortunate
illusion you certainly would have made no
such enquiry as the present, because I
should then have done nothing of which
you would not have known the motive,
nor have taken any measure without the
concurrence of my brother and my friend;
but as you told me yourself—would I could
forget it!—that it was no longer in your
power to retain those characters towards
me, I am learning to forget that I ever
was so happy as to fancy that no change in
my situation, especially a change for the
worse, could rob me of that regard so va∣luable
always, so particularly valuable now!"</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven!" cried Willoughby,
entirely thrown off his guard by her words
and manner—"How have I acted, what
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
have I said, to deserve this reproach from
you Celestina? When we parted last—"</P>
<P>She again interrupted him—"Did we
part like friends? like brother and sister?"</P>
<P>"No," replied he hastily; "but I tore
myself from you like a man who sacrifices,
to the performance of a fatal promise, his
own happiness, and who is the victim of
family pride and family necessity." This
sentence was decisive. His resolution for∣sook
him at once, and his long stifled af∣fection
burst through all the restraints he
determined to lay on it. "Oh! Celes∣tina!"
continued he, "you whom I loved
before I knew what it was to love! you
whom I now adore with a passion too strong
for my reason! do not, do not, I beseech
you, aggravate my sufferings. I promised
to my mother—and you know how well
she deserved to be obeyed—I promised to
unite myself with her niece; I promised to
extirpate from my heart an inclination that
even then I could not conceal. Rash and
ridiculous promise! No, Celestina, it is
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
impossible for me to cease loving you!
All my behaviour, which you have thought
cold and unfriendly, was a part I was act∣ing
in opposition to my real affections! I
can sustain it no longer: I cannot bear
that you should think of me with indiffer∣ence:
and yet—Oh! my mother, what
a cruel task have you imposed on me!
Celestina, pity me; I am more wretched
than you can imagine!" His agitation
now became too violent: he seized the
hand of Celestina, and fervently kissed it,
while her own sensations were such as no
language can describe. That Willoughby
loved her, that what she had considered as
indifference was owing to the struggle be∣tween
his duty and his tenderness, was
transport such as obliterated every other
sentiment. But this delirium lasted but a
moment: her reason, her genuine affection
for him, told her, that to indulge this ten∣derness
was injurious to him, and she de∣termined
to shew that she could sacrifice
herself to his advantage, and that con∣tented
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
with his brotherly attachment, she
could resign him to the fortunate Miss
Fitz-Hayman. The terms however in
which she declared this, the softness of her
voice, and her eyes filled with tears, were
little calculated to reconcile Willoughby
to the resolution, which, after a long dia∣logue,
she urged him to adopt; she assured
him that whatever might be her own fate,
she should never forgive herself were she
to be the means of his breaking a promise
so solemnly given, and given at such a
time, to her dear deceased benefactress.
"No! my brother," said she, "she is
dead, but my obligations to her can never
be annihilated; and what would become
of me, were I ever to feel myself reproached
for ingratitude to her memory, were I to
destroy the fabric she had raised for the
happiness of her beloved son, and to fancy
that the spirit of my more than mother,
which I now often invocate with conscious
pleasure, should, instead of beholding her
Celestina with complacency not unsuited
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
to her present state of happiness, see her de∣graded
into a selfish and unworthy being,
who repays her benefits with the blackest
ingratitude."</P>
<P>Willoughby, whose love, once suffered
to obtain the advantage, now acquired
more power every moment, combated these
objections with very dangerous eloquence;
telling Celestina that he had determined the
evening before, on a sight of Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
who was insupportable to him, to put
an end to the negociation, and say plainly
to his uncle that it was impossible for him
to fulfil an engagement in which his heart
never had any share. Celestina represented
to him the situation of his fortune; the ab∣solute
necessity there was for his marrying
one who could repair its deficiency, and
restore him to the splendid affluence of his
ancestors; but for this he talked of oeco∣nomy
and simplicity, by which when they
lived entirely at Alvestone he should be
able to repair every thing; then for a mo∣ment
indulging his vivid imagination in
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
painting the happiness they should enjoy
there together, (images of felicity which
reflected in stronger colours those which
Celestina had a thousand times formed,
though knowing they could never be rea∣lized,)
he thought suddenly of the fatal
promise he had given to his mother, and
his heart seemed to shrink from the idea
of breaking it to obtain even the highest
human happiness, which under such cir∣cumstances
he felt would be dashed with
gall. He obtained however from Celestina,
but not without difficulty, a promise that
she would lay aside her intentions of going
into the city that morning to prepare for
her journey, of which he would not hear;
and she prevailed upon him to wait on Lord
Castlenorth, as he had assured the family
he would do: "Though wherefore should
I do it," said he, "unless to put an end at
once and for ever to all thoughts of this
odious marriage."</P>
<P>"You ought surely," replied Celestina,
to wait on the brother of your mother tho'
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
no such connection had been thought of:
and no dislike which you may have con∣ceived
to Miss Fitz-Hayman as your wife,
should induce you to forget what you owe
to your uncle.</P>
<P>By arguments thus reasonable, Celestina,
while she prevailed on Willoughby to do
what was, he was forced to own, proper,
would have rivetted his chains, if indeed
they had not already been immoveable.
The noble candour and disinterested gene∣rosity
of her soul, gave tenfold force to the
charms of her person, which since he had
last seen her, Willoughby thought greatly
improved: and the tenderness of her man∣ner,
the certainty of her affection for him,
which she tried to conceal with more kind∣ness
than success, had altogether such an
effect on him, that nothing but the fatal
promise which lay so heavy on his heart,
could have prevented his marrying her
immediately, in despite of every consider∣ation
of prudence or family engagement.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Celestina remained with Wil∣loughby,
the very tumult and agitation of
her heart had sustained her courage, and
like a fever that lends momentary strength
to the patient it is destroying, this disorder
of her spirits had supported her against the
flood of tenderness that overwhelmed her
as soon as she was alone. A conflict then
began between her affection for him and
her duty and gratitude towards the memory
of his mother, which was almost too severe
to be endured; but however soft her heart,
her reason was equal to the task of check∣ing
a dangerous or guilty indulgence of
that sensibility; and after long arguing
with herself, she found she loved Willough∣by
better than every thing but his honor
and his repose.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114"/>
The first, and too probably the second,
she saw too plainly that he must forfeit, by
yielding to an affection, which, circum∣stanced
as he was, would perhaps be as
fatal to both as it certainly was to his pe∣cuniary
interest. She had heard Mr. Mo∣lyneux
say, who had his reasons for repeat∣ing
it before her, that nothing but his
marrying a woman as opulent as Miss Fitz-Hayman
could prevent his selling the
greater part of his estates; "and in that
case," added he, "I don't see how he can
avoid disposing of Alveston too; for with
the income he will then have, to think of
keeping up such a place as that, would be
quite insanity." Celestina knew that no
blow could fall so heavy on the heart of
Willoughby, as the cruel necessity of selling
this his paternal seat; and though she was
flattered and delighted when he had just
before declared to her, that to obtain her
every deprivation would be easy, she knew,
while she now more coolly reflected on it,
his local attachment to be so strong, that it
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
was very probable his love would soon
yield to the regret which would arise from
their sacrifice. "What would become of
me," said she as she meditated on this mat∣ter,
"were I to be the wife of Willoughby,
and to see him unhappy that I was so? He
would have broken his faith to his mother;
he who has always been taught to hold the
slightest promise sacred; he would see his
estate dismembered; even Alveston, the
place he so loves, would pass into the hands
of strangers, and it would be to me he
would owe his indigence and his unhappi∣ness!
How dare I suppose that my affec∣tion,
warm and sincere as it is, could
make him any amends for all those morti∣fications.
Oh! let me not suppose it, nor
ever think of risking it. I can bear to quit
him now—I believe I can—but how should
I endure to find myself the source of re∣pentance
to him! how should I ever sur∣vive
seeing him decidedly unhappy, with
the consciousness that he owed his being so
to his partiality for me."</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116"/>
These reflections, and above all the ob∣ligation
by which he had bound himself to
obey the last injunctions of his mother, de∣termined
Celestina as to the conduct she
ought to adopt; and having once seen it
by the light lent by integrity and disinte∣rested
love to her strong and excellent
understanding, she hastened to execute it,
and certain that he was engaged for the rest
of the morning, she had no sooner break∣fasted
than she told Mrs. Molyneux she
was going to make some purchases for
which she had occasion before she left Lon∣don,
and getting into an hackney coach,
was driven into the City, where she secured
a place in the Exeter stage, which was to
leave London at a very early hour the
next day. She returned to the house of
Mrs. Molyneux about twelve o'clock, and
then learned, that she and her husband were
engaged to dine at Lord Castlenorth's,
where a very large party were to assemble.
In the card which Lady Castlenorth had
sent to invite them, no mention was made
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
of Celestina nor was any separate card sent
to her. "It is mere forgetfulness I fancy,"
said Mrs. Molyneux as she mentioned it to
her: "you will go however, as the cere∣mony
of an invitation is not very material."</P>
<P>"Pardon me," replied Celestina, "it ap∣pears
to me of so much consequence in the
present case, that I certainly shall not go
without it. I am indeed very glad to be
excused, and I am sure you will not urge
me to violate etiquette in a matter where
to forbear doing it is so particularly desir∣able."</P>
<P>Mrs. Molyneux, very solicitous about
the contents of certain band boxes with
which her woman entered at that moment,
forbore to press her farther, and Celestina
desiring her to let her know when she was
dressed, that she might see her before she
went, retired to her own room, leaving her
friend to the pleasing and important occu∣pation
of the toilet, in which half what is
now called morning, was usually passed by
Matilda.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
Celestina had promised Willoughby to
give up for that day her intention of fixing
her journey; but this promise she thought
herself well justified in breaking. The en∣tertainment
at Lord Castlenorth's was given
on his account: of course he would be en∣gaged
the whole day; and since she must
go, she desired nothing so much as to be
spared the fruitless pain of a farther discus∣sion
of the subject, and the misery, which
she was not sure her resolution would sup∣port,
of bidding him a last farewel.</P>
<P>At a little after five however, after she
had undergone the form of sitting down
alone to table, where she eat nothing, and
had then retired to her own room, Mrs.
Willoughby's woman came to say that her
mistress was dressed. Celestina had once
determined to tell Mrs. Molyneux how
soon she meant to quit her, and to have
taken leave of her, but on reflection she
thought her doing so might betray her re∣solution
to Willoughby, from whom it was
necessary to conceal it till it was actually
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
executed. She now therefore intended to
leave a letter of thanks, and to take leave
of Mrs. Molyneux as if it was only till the
next day.</P>
<P>But when the moment approached in
which she was in reality to bid adieu—per∣haps
for ever—to the friend and companion
of her infancy—to the daughter of her be∣loved
friend—to the sister of Willoughby—her
heart sunk within her; and hardly had
she strength to go to the door of Mrs. Mo∣lyneux's
dressing room, on opening which
she saw her friend standing before the glass
putting the last finish to her very elegant
dress, while with her eyes fixed on her
own figure, she was arguing with more
than her usual warmth with some person
who sat beside her, and who Celestina pre∣sently
discovered to be Willoughby him∣self,
in boots, and his hair out of powder.
His countenance was pale and dejected;
and while his sister talked to him he leaned
with one arm on another chair, and seemed
rather musing than attending.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120"/>
"I am glad you are come," said Mrs.
Molyneux to Celestina as she entered,
"for here is George behaving quite ab∣surdly:
he will not go he says to Lord
Castlenorth's, though the dinner is made
on purpose for him. Do Celestina—he
minds your opinion always more than
mine—do try to make him understand
how very absurd and odly he acts."</P>
<P>"I have no talents," Celestina would
have said but the words died away on her
lips; and before she could collect courage
to finish the sentence, Molyneux, who
was now ready, came in, and seeing Wil∣loughby
unprepared to go, expressed his
surprize in terms which were warmer than
Willoughby could hear with perfect com∣mand
of temper. "Surely Sir," said he,
"I am my own master. I am not dis∣posed
to go, and I will not go!"</P>
<P>"And what am I to say," cried Mrs.
Molyneux, "to Lady Castlenorth, to my
uncle, and to my cousin?"</P>
<P>"Just what you please," replied he.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121"/>
Molyneux, finding by the tone in
which his brother in law spoke, that he
would not be dictated to, now called his
wife out of the room, and Willoughby and
Celestina were lest alone.</P>
<P>It was now that all her fortitude and
strength of mind were necessary. Her duty
evidently was to persuade Willoughby to
accompany his sister and to complete a
marriage which his mother had when dy∣ing
enjoined: a marriage so necessary to
the acquisition of all that the world calls
happiness in life, and on which depended
the continuance of his family estate in his
possession. But her heart refused to assent
to what her reason pointed out as the con∣duct
she ought to pursue, and the affection
he now so evidently had for her, adding
to the strength of her long attachment to
him, she found it impossible to urge his
quitting her for ever, though she thought
she had yet courage enough to tear herself
from him if she heard not his complaints
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
nor witnessed his agonies while she com∣bated
her own.</P>
<P>"I cannot—I will not go to these peo∣ple,"
said Willoughby after a short silence:
why should I? since to marry Miss Fitz-Hayman
would be the height of cruelty to
her—since I am incapable of dissimula∣tion—since—In
short, Celestina, I feel
it to be impossible for me to live with
her—to live without you; and I have de∣termined
to declare myself in writing to
that effect."</P>
<P>Celestina, whom this speech was not
calculated to calm, answered, trembling—"Indeed
I think you wrong, Mr. Wil∣loughby.
As your uncle, as your mother's
brother, Lord Castlenorth has undoubtedly
a claim to this mark of respect. It is not
probably expected to be any thing more
than a visit of form, and surely you ought
not rudely and without reason to decline it."</P>
<P>"If it <HI>were indeed</HI> meant only as a visit
of ceremony," said he—</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123"/>
"It is in your power however," inter∣rupted
Celestina, "to appear to consider
it so: your not going must seem very ex∣traordinary;
your going certainly leads to
no consequence."</P>
<P>"If you think so," replied Willoughby;
if you think I ought to go.—But why did
they not ask you?"</P>
<P>"Why should they ask me?" answered
she. "I am almost unknown to Lady Castle∣north;
and in the little time I ever did see
her, I appeared to be no favourite. Believe
me, so far from being displeased I am re∣joiced
at the omission."</P>
<P>"Insolent, odious woman!" cried Wil∣loughby.
"If any thing could add to
my dislike of her and her daughter, it
would be the supercilious airs they gave
themselves towards you even in the short
moment I saw them here. But my Celes∣tina
shall never be exposed to their insult∣ingscorn;
and if I myself this time undergo
the punishment of keeping up the hateful
farce which I have so unhappily been en∣gaged
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
in, it shall be with a determination
to put an end to it."</P>
<P>At this moment Mr. and Mrs. Molyneux
entered the room; and Celestina wishing
them all an agreeable day, left it; having
sustained with some difficulty the various
emotions which were contending in her
bosom. Willoughby soon after left the
house, to dress at his own lodgings, which
were in the neighbourhood, and having
promised to join his brother and sister at
dinner, they soon after departed themselves,
much better satisfied with him than they
were before his short conversation with
Celestina.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, though more unwil∣ling
than ever to go, had prescribed to
herself in her cooler moments a line of con∣duct,
from which, feeling it her duty to
adhere to it, she now determined not to
depart. In arguing with herself on it's pro∣priety,
and strengthening her faultering
resolution, she passed the night. At four
o'clock the servant who was commissioned
to awaken her, came to her door: she arose
and dressed herself by candle-light: the
morning was cold and dark: every object
appeared dreary and forlorn: she hurried
on her cloaths however, and endeavoured
to drive away every recollection that might
enfeeble her spirits too much; but, as she
passed the door of the drawing room, she
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
remembered that it was there she had seen
Willoughby perhaps for the last time, and
almost involuntarily she went in, and by
the light of her solitary candle, contem∣plated
a whole length picture of him which
had just been finished for his sister: the
likeness was so strong, that by the waver∣ing
and uncertain light that fell upon it,
she almost fancied he was about to speak to
her: she started at the idea, and feeling a
fort of chilly terror at the silence and ob∣scurity
of every thing around her, she
turned away and hastened to the servant
who had prepared her tea in the parlour:
she had however hardly time to drink it,
before the hackney coach which had been
ordered the night before was at the door;
and having seen what little baggage she
had not before sent put into it, she stepped
in herself, and was soon at a distance from
the residence of Mrs. Molyneux, from the
friend of her early years, and was launched
alone and unprotected into a world of
which she had yet seen nothing but through
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
the favourable medium lent by affluence
and prosperity to those who from thence
contemplate difficulties they are never
likely to encounter and calamities they
probably never can participate.</P>
<P>That a young woman, who might still
have enjoyed those indulgences, should re∣nounce
them at an age when they have so
many charms; that Celestina, who had
been educated with so much delicacy, and
accustomed since her first recollection: to
every indulgence, should thus voluntarily
enter on a life of comparative hardship
and deprivation, may appear improbable,
but when it is added that she quitted the
man to whom she had so long been fondly
attached, and leaving him to her fortunate
rival, devoted herself to a life of solitude
and regret, such an effort of heroism in a
woman not yet quite nineteen, might be
classed among impossibilities, were it re∣lated
of any other than Celestina: but her
character was an uncommon one: though
she had always been told by Mrs. Wil∣loughby
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
that her birth was very uncertain,
and that nothing was known of it but that
it was disgraceful to her parents, since they
had taken such pains to conceal it, she felt
within herself a consciousness of hereditary
worth, an innate pride, which would never
suffer her to believe herself descended from
mean or unworthy persons: her open and
commanding countenance, where sat dig∣nity
mingled with sweetness; her nymph∣like
and graceful form, which might have
rivalled the models of Grecian art; were
advantages of which, though she was not
vain of them, she could not be insensible,
and if she had any foible, (a perfect cha∣racter
it has been said must not be repre∣sented
because it cannot exist) if she had
any foible, it was carrying a little too far,
though she carefully concealed it, that sort
of pride which seemed born with her, and
which, after all that has been said against
it, is often, especially in a young and
beautiful woman, a fortunate defect.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129"/>
The circumstances of her birth had sel∣dom
been touched upon in the family, for
it was a topic which could not but be pain∣ful
to her: but if ever any thing relating to
it had been accidentally introduced, when
Mrs. Willoughby was conversing with her
three children, (as she often termed Wil∣loughby,
Matilda, and Celestina,) Wil∣loughby
would say laughingly that it was
impossible she could be born of French
parents: his mother had been sometimes
half angry at this assertion, in which how∣ever
he usually persisted, asserting, with
prejudice that she declared to be entirely
English, that no native of the South of
France ever had a complexion or a form
like her's. After she grew up, though
these perfections became more eminent,
Willoughby never appeared to notice them;
with the improvement of her form, her
mind kept pace; and as it acquired every
day more strength, she gradually became
more sensible of her obligation to her be∣nefactress;
but while she indulged her gra∣titude
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
towards the friend on whom she de∣pended,
she felt that she was not born to be
dependent.</P>
<P>This elevation of spirit now supported
her; and the consciousness she was acting
right, blunted for a while the poignancy of
that pain which she too sensibly felt in tear∣ing
herself from Willoughby. Obliged to
act for herself, having no breast on which
she could with propriety lean, her naturally
exalted soul acquired new firmness, before
which trifling inconveniences disappeared;
and with an heart occupied by the beloved
image of Willoughby, and the sacrifice
she was making for him, she hardly re∣membered
that she had never in her life
been in a stage coach before, till she found
herself seated in one under the dark gate∣way
of an inn in the city at five o'clock in a
dreary winter morning.</P>
<P>Two female passengers had already taken
their places; one of whom expressed great
anxiety for a number of hat boxes and cara∣van
trunks which the people belonging to
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
the inn were placing in different parts of
the coach, while the lady particularly re∣commended
to their care one box, which
she assured them contained her new <HI>laylock</HI>
bonnet, an article for the safety of which
she was so solicitous that she would have
taken the great machine in which it was
contained into the coach, had it not been
opposed by the coachman, and presently
after by a man who had been drinking
with him, and who now preparing to enter
the coach, protested vehemently against
this whim of his sister Mary's.—"Who
d'ye think will be scroughed and crammed
up," cried he, "with your confounded
trumpery? No, no such thing. Here Da∣niel,
prythee take and stow it somewhere
or another: it shall not enter the coach,
I'll be sworn."</P>
<P>The man then placed himself by the side
of the other female passenger, opposite to
Celestina, and appeared to be as anxious
for his own ease as his sister was for the
safety of her wardrobe. The coach moved
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
on, but it was still quite dark, and silence
prevailed for the first four or five miles, in∣terrupted
only by some fretful expressions
from the lady of the bandboxes, at the in∣conveniences
to which people were sub∣jected
by going in stage coaches, and some
exclamations against the unfortunate damp∣ness
of the morning, which she declared
would certainly penetrate the covering and
entirely spoil her <HI>laylock</HI> bonnet, which she
said cost her three guineas.</P>
<P>"The more fool you," cried her bro∣ther,
who was of a character Celestina had
never had an opportunity of seeing before,
that of a country tradesman affecting to be
a wit and a buck—"the more fool you, sister
Mary. What! d'ye think a three guinea
bonnet will make you look three years
younger? No, no, take my word for it,
your flounces, and fringes, and furbelows
serve for no purpose at all but to shew your
wrinkles."</P>
<P>"Wrinkles!" repeated the lady dis∣dainfully,
"what do you mean, John
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
Jedwyn? I declare you are so rude and
disagreeable I always repent travelling
with you. I wish you would find out ano∣ther
subject."</P>
<P>"Egad," answered Jedwyn, "I can∣not
have a worse than your wrinkles, that's
true enough; and upon my soul," added
he, looking confidently in the face of Ce∣lestina
and then in that of the other female
passenger, who, though pale and thin, was
very young and very pretty, "here <HI>is</HI> two
better subjects, one aside of me and t'other
opposite: no, no, sister of mine, now day
breaks a little, and lets a body see how the
land lays, you'll hear no more about your
wrinkles; for as Hamlet says—let me see—aye—"here's
that metal that's more at∣tractive;
hey, Miss?"</P>
<P>Celestina, to whom this hey Miss was
addressed, who had till now been very lit∣tle
aware of the species of rudeness and
impertinence to which her mode of tra∣velling
might subject her, was shocked
and alarmed at this address from a person,
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
who, had he seen her a few days before,
would have approached her with awe and
spoken to her with dissidence. She re∣mained
silent however, casting a look on
the man sufficiently expressive of the con∣tempt
she felt for him: but he was not of
a humour to be easily daunted or repulsed,
and without seeming to understand her,
began, with purse-proud pertness to relate
as if it was a narrative which all the world
should be informed of, that he was a gro∣cer
and chandler at Exeter, in a very flou∣rishing
trade, and in partnership with a
gentleman who had married one of his
sisters: "and this <HI>laylock</HI> bonnet lady,"
continued he, "is my eldest sister, who
has been a <HI>wisiting</HI> this half year and better
an old aunt of our's at Camberwell. She
is an old maid herself, but devilish rich,
and from a sort of fellow feeling you know
she intends to make our Mary here her
heir. The old girl must hop the perch
soon, or all her money won't get her dear
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
niece a husband it's my opinion, unless
may be an Irishman or a strolling player."</P>
<P>This second attack on herself, and his
visible admiration of Celestina's beauty,
compleated the ill humour of his sister, who
with a look where anger and scorn con∣tended
for preeminence, remained silently
swelling, while the facetious trader again
addressed himself to Celestina.</P>
<P>"What do you never make talking?
Come, since now you have a history of me,
let's hear a little who you are, and where
you are bound to?"</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Celestina, "it is impossi∣ble
that either can be of any consequence
to you."</P>
<P>"How are you sure of that?" cried Mr.
Jedwyn with a loud laugh: "now I
think nothing is more likely than that we
may be better acquainted. 'Tis nothing
now I believe for a young man of spirit, as
well in the world as I am, to take a fancy
to a pretty woman."</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>
"A fancy!" exclaimed Miss Mary
Jedwyn, with great acrimony—"a fancy!
Jack Jedwyn I am amazed at you!"</P>
<P>"And why amazed, my ancient spin∣ster?"
retorted he. "What the devil! I'm
my own master I hope. To be sure you
are some fifteen or twenty years older than
me. But what of that?—So much the
worse for you. I hope I a'nt to be go∣verned
by a duenna. What a plague,
mayn't I talk to a handsome girl I wonder
without your putting in your squinnygut
opinion?"</P>
<P>"If you intend to insult me," answered
the lady, trying to hide under the appear∣ance
of calm contempt her great disposition
to cry:—"if you intend to insult me, I
am sure I heartily wish I had got the better
of my fears and travelled alone in a post
<HI>cbai;</HI> for no rudeness as I might have met
on the road could be worse than your's."</P>
<P>"That's your gratitude now, cried Jed∣wyn,
for my coming up clear from Exeter
to fetch you at a time when I had no
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
business in London nor should a had for
these six weeks: that's your thanks for my
kindness, and for listening to your nonsen∣sical
fears and frights. Rude to you! oh
Lord! as if any mortal man who has eyes
would ever look at you twice. No Mary!
make yourself easy; that weazen, winterly
visage of your's, is fafeguard enough if you
were to travel from here to Jericho."</P>
<P>He then began to mimic his sister, and
enlarge on the terrors to which she was, he
said, perpetually subject, lest some sad
daring rake of a man should carry her away:
and had he been less gross and disgusting,
Celestina would hardly have forborne a
smile at some part of the ludicrous repre∣sentation
he gave of this apprehensive de∣licacy
and trembling nicety, for which she
could not, in the personal attractions of
Miss Jedwyn, find any reasonable grounds;
for she was very tall, very thin, and very
yellow: her long, scraggy neck, appeared
hardly adequate to the support of a head,
where art had so redundantly been called
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
in aid of nature, that it seemed to abound
in shining black hair, nicely curled, with∣out
powder, which was suffered to wanton
over her forehead and flow down her back,
while a little white beaver hat, perched on
one side, was meant to give to her counte∣nance
that bewitching archness which she
had observed that mode of head dress to
bestow on the young and lovely.</P>
<P>Mr. Jedwyn having exhausted all his
immediate stock of wit on his sister, now
left her to digest the indignation he had
raised, and applied himself again to Celes∣tina.
Having no idea that any thing but
money bestowed consequence, and having
lived the greater part of his time among
those who had less of it than himself, he
had never been accustomed to allow of any
superiority, nor could he comprehend how
a young woman so humbly situated in life,
as to travel in a stage coach, could help
being charmed into liking by his wit, and
awed into complaisance by his importance.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139"/>
On such a man the native dignity of
Celestina failed totally of it's usual effect.
He became more and more troublesome;
for he was piqued but not repressed by the
coldness and even contempt of her manner.
He told her, among much other imperti∣nence,
that all her shyness should not hin∣der
him from finding out who she was;
and then with yet more offensive familiarity
addressed himself to the other young wo∣man,
who he thought belonged to her, and
who heard his conversation with terror and
dislike as great as that of Celestina.</P>
<P>His behaviour at length becoming in∣supportably
uneasy to her, Celestina, when
the coach reached the village where they
were to breakfast, determined not to sub∣ject
herself to it any longer; she therefore
ordered her tea to be carried into another
room, and a post chaise to be ready as soon
as she had drank it.</P>
<P>As she sat at her breakfast, she saw the
young woman, whose countenance had
greatly interested her, walk by the window
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
slowly and dejectedly, one hand held to her
forehead, and an handkerchief in the other.
Ever ready to assist the unhappy, the ge∣nerous
heart of Celestina was touched with
compassion towards this forlorn stranger.
"She is as young as I am," said she, "and
perhaps even more unfortunate. Why
should I not take her with <HI>me,</HI> if she is, as
I suppose, travelling the same road? why
should I leave her exposed to the insults of
that odious man, which, humble as her for∣tune
seems to be, she ill knows how to
bear. I may at least, though I cannot
otherwise assist her, save her from passing
the remainder of the journey improperly
and unpleasantly." Celestina then rang the
bell, and directing her fellow traveller to
be called, desired her not only to partake
of her breakfast, but to accompany her the
rest of the way in a post chaise which she
had ordered, to escape from Mr. Jedwyn.</P>
<P>The young person, notwithstanding the
kindness of Celestina's address, still conti∣nued
standing, and with a faint blush said,
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
"You are very good Madam;—but—though
we happen to be in the same coach
I am sure I ought not to put myself on a
footing with you: I am only a servant, tra∣velling
into the country to my friends to
recover my health, and it would be very
wrong in me to intrude on a lady like you."</P>
<P>Celestina, won by this humble simplicity,
soon reassured her new acquaintance, and
soon after Jessy Woodburn, (which was
her name,) followed Celestina to the chaise;
where having paid the coach in London,
she now had directed her box to be placed.</P>
<P>Mr. Jedwyn left the hot rolls and cho∣colate
with which he was regaling himself,
to remonstrate at the chaise door against
this secession. Celestina, without giving
him any answer, drew up the glasses the
moment she was seated, which gave Jed∣wyn
an opportunity to say to the postillion,
who was not yet on horseback, that if he
would in the course of a fortnight find out
who the lady was, and whither she went, he
would make up the half crown he then
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
gave him half a guinea. The boy readily
promised to execute to the best of his
power so lucrative a commission; and Ce∣lestina
and her companion were soon at a
distance, and proceeded on their journey
much pleased with the exchange they had
made of a conveyance.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA having by her easy and
gentle manners conquered part of the ex∣treme
diffidence of her companion, began
to question her about her situation in life;
and as she had one of those faces and one
of those voices which win every heart
where any spark of feeling is found, Jessy
soon found herself enough at ease and even
flattered by the interest she seemed to take
in her fate, as to acquire courage to relate
the following narrative.</P>
<P>I must go back a great way, Madam,
since you command me to tell you all I
know of myself; even as far as my grand∣father,
who is still living, and who is one of
the richest farmers in our part of De∣vonshire
using his own land, as all his
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
family I have heard have done before him
for a great many years. He married a
clergyman's daughter who had been edu∣cated
very well, greatly indeed above the
sort of life she was to lead as a farmer's
wife. But she was very pretty. Her fa∣ther
left her unprovided for, and so she
married perhaps more for money than love.
My mother was the only child they ever
had, and my grandmother, though her
own education had only served to make
her unhappy, would fain have had her
daughter brought up as she had been
herself; but her husband, of a very hard
and obstinate temper and repenting perhaps
of having married a wife too fine for him,
was so far from allowing her to have any
education, that he went to the other ex∣treme;
insisting that his girl should do as
his mother did thirty or forty years before,
and not only be taught to understand all
the business of the farm, but to live as he
did himself, and as he obliged his wife to
do, the same as the farming men.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145"/>
The consequence of this difference of
opinion was fatal to my poor mother: one
of her parents took every opportunity of
giving her notions above herself, which
very naturally, she easily took; and the
other seemed to delight in humbling and
degrading her: when she was about eigh∣teen
she lost her mother, and then was
forced to submit to the harsh and unneces∣sary
confinement imposed upon her by her
father, from whom she endeavoured to
conceal her passion for reading, which
only gained strength by this unreasonable
restraint. Home was very uneasy to her,
but she could hardly ever leave it but by
stealth. As she was likely to have a very
good fortune, she had numberless suitors;
but my grandfather would suffer none of
them to see her; designing to marry her
to a relation of his own almost as old as
himself, to whom she had an invincible
aversion, which through the timidity of
her nature she dared not declare.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
A neighbouring farmer, with whom my
grandfather had for many years been at
variance, and with whom he had had two
or three law-suits, had two sons, both
brought up to his own business; the eldest
was married and had a family, but the
other had been spoiled by his mother,
and the notice taken of him by the neigh∣bouring
gentlemen on account of his skill
in field sports; he had indeed always been
rather fonder of being with them at cricket
matches, and races, than minding his
farm. He found means to introduce him∣self
to my mother, though he had been
positively refused by my grandfather: he
won her affections, and after several pri∣vate
meetings she agreed to go off with
him: the consequence of which was her
having the door of her paternal house shut
against her for ever.</P>
<P>For a little time after this marriage my
mother was received at the house of her
father in law, but on his death it became
the right of the eldest son, who had a
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
number of children; and as my father's fa∣mily
were all irritated and disappointed
by the obstinate resentment of my grand∣father
towards his daughter, they soon
behaved with such unkindness towards
her, that she prevailed on my father to
quit them, and take a little farm of his
own, which he with difficulty borrowed
money enough to stock, for he had long
since paid away in discharge of old debts,
all the money left him by his father. He
had been so long used to an idle, or ra∣ther
a gay life, that he could not now ac∣custom
himself to the labour requisite on
so small a farm. My mother however by
incessant attention remedied for some years
this deficiency on his part; and though
nothing was laid by, they contrived to
live; my mother making from time to
time attempts to obtain her father's pardon,
though she received nothing but cruel and
positive refusals, either to see her or her
children, or ever to give them the least
assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148"/>
This hardness of heart, which should
have excited pity, only made my father
treat my poor mother with harshness too.
A young man of fortune in the neighbour∣hood
just then coming of age, was often
at his seat near our little farm, and took
such a fancy to my father that he was al∣ways
at his house, living as he lived, and
associating with gentlemen from London,
and women they brought down with them.
He never came home but in such a terrible
humour, that I and my sister, who were
then about ten and nine years old, used to
be terrified to death; yet when he was
gone, as he sometimes was for weeks toge∣ther,
my mother lamented his absence and
the loss of his affection, much more than
the fatigue, poverty, and sorrow, to which
his conduct exposed us all.</P>
<P>"Present anxiety and the fear of leaving
me and my sister to a fate as deplorable as
her own, together with the incessant toil
attending the care of a farm wholly neg∣lected
by her husband, gradually destroyed
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
her constitution, till at last, Madam, her
heart was quite broken. When she found
she had only a few hours to live, she en∣treated
the clergyman of the parish to go
to her father, and beg, if he would not see
her, that he would only send her his for∣giveness,
for she could not die in peace
without it.</P>
<P>"Even that he had the cruelty to refuse!
I lost my dear mother, Madam; and my
sister, who was always of a weak constitution,
followed her soon afterwards to the grave.
Ah! how often have I wished that I had
died too. Troubles now multiplied around
us: my father's great friend had by this
time so compleatly ruined himself, that
every thing was seized and he left the
country. My father having no longer a
house to be at, was forced to live at home;
but it was only for a little while; for dur∣ing
my mother's illness every thing had
been neglected, and we could not pay our
rent; so the landlord seized, our cattle
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
were sold, and we were turned out of the
farm and went to a miserable cottage in
the next village; where, as my father was
so unused to work, we subsisted for a while
on the reluctant charity of my uncle, whose
daughters were always reproaching me with
taking their bread from them. Believe
me, Madam, I did all I could do to earn
it for my father and myself: but what
could hands so feeble as mine do towards
supporting us both. I made an attempt
to see my grandfather, and to implore his
pity and protection towards one who had
never offended him; but he ordered me
to be driven from his door, and never
again suffered to appear there: orders which
those he had about him were ready enough
to execute. I returned home quite dis∣heartened
indeed, but still endeavouring to
the utmost of my power to procure a sup∣port
by my labour for my father and my∣self;
I even went out to work in the fields;
but all I could earn was so insufficient that
we often wanted necessary food, at least <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
have often wanted it. But my father had
made an acquaintance with a widow wo∣man
in the next village, who was said to
be worth forty or fifty pounds. She was
young too and not ugly, and in less than
a year after my dear mother's death, he
married her, and we removed to her house.</P>
<P>"The extremes of poverty I had before
known, bitter as I thought them, were
comparatively happiness to what I now en∣dured.
I became the servant of my mother
in law, only without wages. She soon
brought my father an increase of family:
to them then I was nurse, and very soon
had neither sleep by night or respite by day.
I thought it my duty to bear every thing
for my father, without murmuring, but as
my fatigue and sufferings encreased, my
dejection encreased too, and I was some∣times
through mere despondence unable to
fulfil my heavy tasks, in which if I failed
in the flightest degree, I was insulted with
opprobious language and told to go to my
rich grandfather.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>
"Alas! my rich grandfather continued
inexorable; but home was so dreadful that
I determined to go to service, being near
twenty, and able I thought to undertake
any place that could be offered me; for a
harder than that I now filled, it was im∣possible
to meet with.</P>
<P>"I applied to a relation I had at Exeter,
who after some enquiries procured me a
place in the family of an attorney in Lon∣don,
who was willing to dispense with my
want of experience in favour of my being
a country servant. Thither therefore I
went, and entered as cheerfully as I could
on a new mode of life; endeavouring to
forget that I ever had any expectations of
a better. The dark, damp places where
the servants of persons in the midling ranks
of life, live in the city, appeared very
dreadful to me; and it was my business,
after a day of fatiguing work, to sit up for
my master or the clerks, who were often
out very late. My mistress too was a very
fine lady, and kept a great deal of com∣pany,
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
and it was part of my employment
to wait on her own maid, who was also a
sort of housekeeper, and much more diffi∣cult
to be pleased than the lady herself:
she took care indeed that I should never
want business; but determined as I was
never again to be a burthen to my father,
I went through the duties of my place,
heavy as they were, with courage and
steadiness; so that even this second mistress,
however unwilling to be pleased, could
not find fault with me.</P>
<P>"Among a great number of clerks that
my master kept, there was one who was
employed merely to copy, and was not
admitted among the rest, though he looked
I am sure more like a gentleman than any
of them. He did not lodge in the house,
but came every morning early to his work,
and sat at it, poor young man! till five or
six o'clock at night, when he dined with
us servants, after the family and other clerks
had done. Often indeed, instead of eating,
he would sigh all dinner time as if his heart
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
would break; and I could not help fancy∣ing
that he had been used to live quite in
other company; though he never seemed
above ours, but was always very obliging,
though he was very melancholy.</P>
<P>"It happened once, that my master had
some extraordinary business to do that re∣quired
great haste; it was some papers that
were to be sent to India; and Mr. Cathcart,
the young man I have been speaking of,
hearing my master say how afraid he was he
should not get ready, offered to work all
day on Sunday, when none of the rest of
the clerks would have staid from their plea∣sure
on any account. My master was
pleased with his willingness to oblige, and
he sat down to his task. Nobody was in
the house but him and me; for it was the
custom of my master and mistress to dine in
the country on a Sunday with my mistress's
mother at Edmonton; and all the gentle∣men
in the office went different ways.
The footman attended my mistress; and
Mrs. Gillam, her maid, always went to
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
see her acquaintance, who lived at the
other end of the town, and very often
came home sadly out of temper because
her place was not so fine and so fashionable
as their's; and then I was sure to suffer for
it, as indeed I did for all her ill temper
when she had nobody else to vent it upon.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam! often of a Sunday in
the summer I have gone up into cur din∣ing
room, because the street was so close
and narrow that below we hardly saw day
light from one end of the year to the other;
and I have opened the sash, and looked
against the black walls and shut windows
of the houses opposite, and have thought
how dismal it was! Ah! I remembered
too well the beautiful green hills, the mea∣dows
and woods, where I so often used to
ramble with my sister when we were chil∣dren,
in our own country, before we were
old enough to know that my poor mother
was unhappy, and had learned to weep
with her! How often have I wished those
days would come again, and how often
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
have I shut my eyes and tried to fancy I
saw once more all the dear objects that
then were so charming. Alas! the dream
would not last long! or if it did it served
only to make me feel more unhappy, when,
instead of being able to indulge it, I was
obliged to go back to hard, and what was
yet worse, to dirty work in our dismal
kitchen. In Devonshire I had been used
to work hard enough; but I had always
fresh air to breathe, and could now and
then of an evening sit at our cottage win∣dow,
and look at the moon, and fancy
that my mother might be there with my
sister, and that they saw and pitied their
poor unfortunate Jessy. Tears then re∣lieved
me; and I gathered courage to bear
the next day the ill humour of my mother
in law, which now that it was over I fan∣cied
was not worse than the ill humour of
Mrs. Gillam. My father's harshness indeed
was worse than either, because I loved
him, and every time he used to speak cru∣elly
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
to me, and seem to wish me away, it
was like a dagger in my heart!"</P>
<P>The tears of the unfortunate Jessy here
interrupted her narrative a moment, and
Celestina took occasion to say—</P>
<P>"But what were you going to tell me
about Mr. Cathcart? You seem to have
forgotten him?"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam!" replied she with a
deep sigh, "I thought after I began to talk
of him, that I was doing wrong, and that
it was better not to say any more about
him: besides, Madam, though you are so
good and so condescending, it is not per∣haps
proper for me to trouble you with all
the reasons I have to be sorrowful."</P>
<P>"Indeed I wish extremely to know
them," replied Celestina; "and particu∣larly
I desire to know all that relates to
Mr. Cathcart. The little you have said,
has interested me greatly."</P>
<P>"It was on the Sunday, Madam, that
I was speaking of, when every body was
gone out, that poor Mr. Cathcart first
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
spoke to me alone. Often before that to
be sure I thought he pitied me, when he
saw me doing work too heavy for my
strength; and often he has offered to help
me, and did not disdain to assist me though
the footmen did; and yet I am sure his
look and his manners were a great deal
more like those of a nobleman than any
thing else. Mrs. Gillam however was al∣ways
so angry if she saw him speak to, or
help me, and used to put herself into such
passions, that he was afraid almost of look∣ing
at me before her, least it should be the
occasion of my being used ill.</P>
<P>On the Sunday, Madam, that I was
speaking of, he had finished all my master
left for him to do, between six and seven
o'clock: for he wrote such a beautiful hand
and so quick that his writing seemed done
by enchantment. That day he had eat no
dinner: but a little after six o'clock he
came down into the kitchen, where I was
fitting: "Jessy," said he, "will you
"make me some tea: I am fatigued, and I
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
think it will refresh me." Ah! Madam!
how pleased I was to do any thing for him.
As he sat on the other side of the table
drinking his tea, I looked at him, and
thought his eyes seemed inflamed as if he
had been crying, and he seemed more me∣lancholy
than usual. "What is the mat∣ter,
Mr. Cathcart?" said I, "you have
tired yourself too much?"</P>
<P>"Yes, answered he, "I have been
writing a long time; but I have finished
my business, so I never mind my head
ache." He seemed desirous of turning
the discourse, and reaching across to the
side of the table where I sat, he took up a
torn book, which, while I was sweeping
the clerk's office the day before, my master
had thrown to me, bidding me burn it, for
that he would not have such trumpery lay
about there. I never had time to read,
though my poor mother had taught me to
love it; and I had thrown this book into
a drawer, from whence I had taken it but a
moment before Mr. Cathcart came down.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160"/>
He enquired how I came by it, and
when I told him, asked if I had read it?
I answered that I had no time. "It is my
book," said he, sighing from the bottom
of his heart as he spoke; "and it is the
story of a poor young man, who was as
unfortunate as I am: but he had the
resolution to end his calamities; he in∣deed
was not enchained to life as I must
be. Heaven and earth!" exclaimed he,
as if at that moment oppressed by some
idea altogether insupportable, "how long
shall I remain the wretch I am!"</P>
<P>He started from his chair, and walked
about the room with looks so wild that I
was terrified to death: I went to him trem∣bling,
and besought him to be calm, to
tell me if I could do any thing for him:
he looked eagerly at me a moment and
burst into tears—"Ah! Jessy," cried he,
"you pity me, and all the return I make
is to terrify and distress you!" For a mo∣ment
Madam, after this gust of passion,
he became calmer, and sat down; then as
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
I stood still trembling by him, he took
my hands within his and put them to his
burning forehead and eyes; but after a
moment seeming to recollect himself, he
sighed, let them go, and said—"I hardly
know, Jessy, what ailed me just now; but
I was so tired, my spirits were so ex∣hausted
by having been so long at the
desk employed in such tedious kind of
writing, that when I looked at you—when
you seemed concerned for me—I
am so little used to meet any friendly
looks here, that your pity affected me
strangely; I felt just then how terrible,
how very terrible my fate was; and
this proud rebellious heart, unsubdued
yet to my cruel destiny, deprived me for
a moment of my reason."</P>
<P>Thank God, replied I, you are now
easier: indeed you did sadly frighten me.
Tell me, dear Mr. Cathcart, why did you
talk so, and why are you so unhappy?</P>
<P>"I will tell you, Jessy," answered he,
"though you are the only person in the
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
house who ever shall guess at my real si∣tuation.
I am unhappy:—not because I
was born and educated a gentleman,
and am now reduced to a condition
worse than absolute servitude, but be∣cause
those I love and feel for more than
for myself are fallen with me; because
my labour—and yet I am sacrificing my
life to follow it—my labour is insufficent
to support a woman, delicately brought
up, and her four infant children!"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam! all the sorrow I
had ever known was nothing to the cold
death-like feeling which seemed to wither
up my heart, when for the moment I
thought Mr. Cathcart was married and had
a family! I did not know at that time why
it hurt me so: but I was not able to speak,
while he, after remaining silent a minute,
said—"By my work to-day I have earned
a guinea more than my weekly stipend:
surely therefore instead of murmuring
thus, I ought rather to be thankful that
I have had power to do this, for to-mor∣row
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
I shall receive it, and to-morrow I
shall be able to carry to my Sophy and
her children some necessaries which they
have long wanted, but which I could
not before spare money enough to pro∣cure
for them, out of what I earned
weekly as the only support of us all."</P>
<P>"Poor as I am, Madam, I could not
help unlocking my tea chest where I kept
my little savings; and though I trembled
like a leaf as I did it, I put a guinea and
some silver, all I had, into a paper, and
carried it to him. Mr. Cathcart, said I,
pray be not offended, but take this trifle,
and make use of it for your family; they
want it more than I do, and you cannot
think how much happier it will make me
if you have it, than if I lay it out on my∣self.</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" cried he, "this is too
much. No, my dear, generous girl, do
not imagine I will take what you have so
hardly acquired. Believe me, Jessy, this
instance of sensibility and kindness,
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
charming as they are, only render me
more wretched. In the meanest servi∣tude,
in the lowest degradation, amid
the hardest labour, I have found a soul
so much superior to those I have met
with in polished society: but your form,
your manners, your sentiments, are not
those of your station: surely you were
not born what I now see you?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, replied I, I was: my father
is now a labourer; I have no mother; nor
any friend willing, if they are able, to do
any thing for me: but while I am able to
work I must not, I will not be discon∣tented,
whatever hardships I may undergo,
if you Mr. Cathcart will but let me be
your friend. Let me see your children;
indeed I shall love them; and if your lady
will give me leave I will work for them:
I can bring any thing she will give me to
do home, and work in my own room in∣stead
of going to bed.</P>
<P>"I do not know Madam, how I was
able to say so much, for I felt my heart
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
throb as if it would break all the time I
was speaking. Oh! Madam! I was sud∣denly
transported as it were to heaven,
when Mr. Cathcart, thanking me a thou∣sand
times for my offer, told me that the
children he supported were not his own
but his sister's, whose husband had been
undone by the villainy of some people with
whom he had been connected in trade,
and by the wickedness of an attorney; it
is impossible to describe how I was relieved
to find he was not married! for though I
am sure I should have loved his children
dearly because they were his, yet methought
I loved them much better now."</P>
<P>Sensations she had herself felt in regard
to Willoughby, now forcibly occurred to
Celestina: she remained silent however,
and Jessy went on.</P>
<P>After this time, Madam, Mr. Cathcart
took every opportunity of speaking to me;
and I got leave to go out one evening,
and he took me to see this beloved and
unfortunate sister. It was in one of those
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
little new houses which are run up in a road
leading from Iflington to London, that
Mr. Cathcart's family lodged: his sister,
Madam, was so like him, that the mo∣ment
I saw her I could have died for her;
and I forgot all the reluctance with which
I agreed at his earnest request to go to see
her: she seemed to be four or five years
older than he is, and was very pale and
thin, but she had such beautiful eyes, and
hands so white!—her form was so graceful,
so commanding, that her very plain dress,
and a close cap, such as widow's wear,
could not disfigure her, or make her look
otherwise than like a gentlewoman. When
her brother led me in, she held out her
hand to me, and begged I would sit down:
though in such a poor little lodging, I felt
that she was so much my superior that I
could not obey her without hesitation;
but she presently by her gracious manners
dissipated my fears, and I sat down by her
close to a frame on which she had been
working. A cradle, with a sleeping baby
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
in it, stood at her feet, by which a little
girl of three years old sat, as if watching
the infant, and on hassocks near the win∣dow
were placed two little boys, the elder
not above six years old, who were learning
their tasks. As soon as my reception was
over, she smiled on her brother with more
cheerfulness than it seemed possible a mo∣ment
before for her countenance to assume;
and desired he would assist her in getting
some tea for me. Cathcart went down
stairs, and then she entered into conversa∣tion
with me: "My brother," said she,
has often told me how unfit you are for
the condition in which he found you,
and if I may judge by your appearance,
you certainly were not born to it. Had
my dear Frank been any other than he
is, I should have supposed him influ∣enced
by beauty; but I know that mere
personal loveliness in any rank never
affected him, and many reasons induced
me, Jessy, to consent to see you—reasons
which relate to him as well as yourself.
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
He has told you, Jessy, that he was born
to prospects very different from those
now before him—prospects which are I
fear vanished for ever. My misfortunes,
which are such as I dare not attempt to
relate to you, have extended to him:
yet does he with unexampled generosity,
give himself up to servitude, to assist me
and my poor children. Judge whether
such a brother is not dear to me—judge
whether I ought not to love all that he
loves, and to comply as far as possible
with all his wishes.</P>
<P>"I have of late seen with infinite pain,
that in addition to all the calamities of
indigence, a passion has seized him,
which must encrease, and may perpe∣tuate,
his misfortunes, and I consented,
and even wished to see you, that I might
fairly state to you the situation he is in,
as to circumstances; in the hope—a
hope in which I trust I shall not be de∣ceived,
that your good sense, and even
your regard for him, will lead you to
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
avoid an error so seducing as that of be∣coming
his wife."</P>
<P>"I do not knew Madam, how I looked
at that moment, but I believe Mrs. El∣phinstone
thought I should faint, for she
gave me immediate assistance by opening
the window, fetched me a glass of water,
and very earnestly entreated me to try to
recover myself before her brother returned.
I should be too tedious, Madam, were I to
relate all that passed even in the few mi∣nutes
we were together afterwards. I found
that Cathcart's regard for me was such,
that he was willing to forget what he had
once been, and what he might still be,
and to unite himself for ever with the
poor and humble Jessy. Ah! Madam,
had it not been for Mrs. Elphinstone's
sake, who with her children had no other
dependence, I should have feared no po∣verty,
no distress with him; but should
have been too happy to have begged round
the world with him: as it was, I saw that
I ought not to think a moment of a mar∣riage,
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
which would at best only encrease
his difficulties. Oh! how I then wished
that my grandfather were less cruel, my
poor father less imprudent!</P>
<P>"After this first interview with Mrs.
Elphinstone, I saw her whenever I could
get leave to go out, which was not indeed
very often: but my master, who did not
want humanity, seeing me look dreadfully
ill, ordered Mrs. Gillam to let me go out
whenever she could spare me, for air.
Mrs. Elphinstone, who watched every alter∣ation
of my countenance, guessed at all I suf∣fered;
and at length she became so fond of
me, that she rather desired than opposed the
completion of her brother's wishes. The
struggle I underwent nearly cost me my
life: but at length, Madam, I have left
them both. I could not bear to see my
dear Cathcart every day more and more
unhappy: I could not bear to become a
burthen to him: for some time I redoubled
my diligence, and exerted myself greatly
beyond my strength, from a hope, that by
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
becoming necessary to my mistress, I
should obtain an encrease of wages, out of
which I thought it possible that I might
be able to save something; but the upper
servant took pains to render all my endea∣vours
ineffectual; and my health declined
so rapidly under the labour and anxiety I
endured, that Cathcart, whose uneasiness
compleated the measure of my sufferings,
at length proposed that I should quit my
service, as the only means of saving my
life, and try what my native air would do
to restore me.</P>
<P>"I hope my father will receive me
without unkindness, and suffer me to stay
till I am able to take another service; and
sometimes I am willing to flatter myself
that my grandfather may relent, though it
is more possible than probable."</P>
<P>"And where," enquired Celestina,
"have you left your lover?"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam," replied the weeping
Jessy, "he still remains writing for the
existence of his sister and her children: at
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
his pen from early morning, to eleven or
twelve at night. By such assiduous appli∣cation
he is enabled indeed to earn double
the money he would otherwise do; but his
dear health is fast declining, and God only
knows," continued she, clasping her hands
together, "whether I shall ever see him
more: but if not, one comfort, one great
comfort is, that we shall not be separated
long:—in heaven nothing can part us!"</P>
<P>"Let us however hope," said Celestina,
"that your tenderness, your fortitude,
and generosity, will be rewarded on earth.
Your father then knows nothing of your
arrival?"</P>
<P>"Ah! no, Madam: I dared not write
to him, for fear he should have been angry
with me for having quitted my service, and
have refused to receive me. Now I hope,
when he sees me so sadly altered, for I am
not at all like what I was when I left him,
he will have some pity upon me, and suf∣fer
me at least to stay in his house till I
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
have strength enough to undertake another
service."</P>
<P>"You shall go with me, however, to∣night,"
said Celestina, "and you shall stay
with me till you are fitter than you now
appear to be to undergo an interview with
this cruel father."</P>
<P>The poor Jessy, oppressed by this good∣ness,
could not speak, but she kissed the
hand of her benefactress with a respectful
gratitude, and a mournful but not unpleas∣ing
sadness kept the generous and soft
hearted Celestina silent till their arrival at
the inn where they were to remain that
night.</P>

<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY in the evening of the follow∣ing
day, Celestina and her humble friend
arrived at the lodging she had taken: it
was a small new built brick house, on the
edge of an extensive common: enclosures
at a distance relieved a little the dreary
uniformity of the view from it's windows,
and a village church, with a few straggling
houses scattered round the edge of the
heath at the distance of about half a mile,
gave some relief to the eye, and some in∣timation
of an inhabited country: winter
had alike divested the common of it's
furze and heath blossoms, and the few
elms on it's borders, of their foliage. All
was alike dull, and unpleasant: but Ce∣lestina
remembered that she had now
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
escaped from the Castlenorths, from the
sight of preparations for Willoughby's mar∣riage,
and that if she was not to live to
see him happy, she should not now witness
his struggles and his distress: she tried to
believe that she could receive intelligence
of his marriage with composure, and be
glad in the reflection that he had obeyed
his mother; but her heart revolted, and all
she could promise herself was, to exert her
resolution to obtain such a state of mind,
as might enable her to hear, without very
acute anguish, of an event, which, notwith∣standing
all that had passed at her last in∣terview
with Willoughby, she still consi∣dered
as inevitable.</P>
<P>The first day after her arrival was passed
in settling herself in her new habitation
by the aid of Jessy, who helped her to
arrange her books and her wardrobe. The
pensive simplicity of her new friend's cha∣racter
won upon her every hour; and now,
deprived as she was of all her former con∣nections,
and of every prospect of happi∣ness
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
for herself, she was sensible of no
other pleasure than what arose from the
power of soothing the sorrows of her un∣fortunate
companion, and forming schemes
for restoring her to the favour of her grand∣father;
and to her unhappy lover, in whose
fate she became as much interested from
the artless description Jessy had given, as
if she had herself known him. It was ne∣cessary
however to part with her: but as
she appeared in too weak a state of health
to encounter the rude reception she might
meet with from her father and her mother
in law, if she appeared before them with∣out
notice, Celestina thought it best to
keep her till an answer could be obtained
from them, and she therefore hired a mes∣senger,
by whom the letter the trembling
Jessy indited was dispatched to the cottage
of Woodburn, which was about seven
miles distant. Towards evening he re∣turned,
and brought a reluctant and surly
consent from her father to receive her for
a little time till she recovered her health.
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
The terms in which this answer was written,
though Celestina endeavoured to give
them the best interpretation she could, were
cruelly painful to poor Jessy, who wept
over the letter, while Celestina, with the
most generous pity, assured her, that if
her father's behaviour to her was unkind,
and her stay at his house uncomfortable,
she would again receive her, and that she
should be welcome to remain with her till
her health was re-established, and till means
could be found to procure for her the fa∣vour
of her grandfather, who, on enquiry
of her hostess, Celestina found to be as
Jessy had represented him—a very rich
farmer, now quite superannuated, and al∣most
childish; who having once determined
to resent his daughter's marriage, had per∣sisted
in it from the hard obstinacy of his
nature, and had been supported in it by
the arts of an old female relation who lived
with him, and who, while she made a
purse every year out of what was entrusted
to her, looked forward with avidity to his
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
death, when she hoped to possess the whole.
Celestina procured an horse and a man to
lead it, the expence of which she paid
herself, and on the third day after their
arrival at Thorpe Heath, Jessy took leave
of her lovely and generous benefactress,
who was now left to reflect, without inter∣ruption,
on her own destiny.</P>
<P>Till lately she had not been conscious
of the force of her attachment to Willough∣by;
for it began so early in life, that she
had never been alarmed by the uneasiness
which seizes the heart on it's first reception
of a new passion: she now however found
that her existence had been delightful to
her, only as his idea had mingled itself
with every hour of it, and that now, when
she believed she ought no longer to in∣dulge
herself in thinking of him, she could
think of nothing else with either interest or
pleasure: the benevolence and tenderness
of her heart still afforded her some satis∣faction,
while she could exert it in favour
of the unfortunate, and the power of be∣friending
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
friending the desolate and unhappy Jessy
had called off her attention a little from
her own uneasy feelings; but now, having
done all she could at present do for her,
her heart was again sensible of the cruel
deprivation to which she was condemned,
and her mind occupied in reflecting on
what Willoughby would think, what he
would say, when he learned she was gone;
in conjectures on his behaviour to the
Castlenorths, and in trembling solicitude
whether he would write to her, or without
any farther indulgence of an attachment,
which he knew he ought not to cherish,
drive her from his recollection, at least
till he had obeyed the injunctions of his
mother, and by compleating the marriage
she had insisted upon, put it out of his
power to think of Celestina otherwise than
as his sister.</P>
<P>Two or three days passed thus, before
Celestina could acquire in any degree her
usual serenity, and sit down to her books,
her drawing, or her work. By music,
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
which she now fancied would sooth and
calm her spirits, she could not amuse her∣self;
for though she had a plano forte which
used to be called her's, yet, as it had ne∣ver
been formally given to her, and as
Mrs. Molyneux had not mentioned it,
Celestina would not take it on her quitting
London. At length the first uneasy sensa∣tions
on her change of situation a little sub∣sided,
and she began to consider of a letter
which she thought it indispensably neces∣sary
to write to Mrs. Molyneux.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ardent and eager
temper of Willoughby exhibited in London
a scene, which, could Celestina have known,
it would have redoubled all her anxiety.
The dinner of which he had been with diffi∣culty
induced to partake at Lord Castle∣north's,
had served only to fill him with new
and invincible disgust towards the whole fa∣mily,
and hardly could he command himself
so as not to betray it. The restraint, however,
which, in consideration of their relationship
to his mother, he determined, whatever it
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
cost him, to put upon his sentiments, gave
to two of the persons concerned a favour∣able
impression of him: Lord Castlenorth,
fond of form, and of that reserve which he
fancied supported dignity, liked his ne∣phew
the better he said for not assuming
the familiar and too easy manners, so dis∣agreeable
to him in the behaviour of most
of the young men he saw; and Miss Fitz-Hayman,
who liked his person better on
every interview, and who never could for
a moment suppose that any man could be∣hold
her's with indifference, imputed to
respect and admiration that distant polite∣ness
which was intended to conceal aver∣sion.
Lady Castlenorth, however, who
had seen more of the world than her daugh∣ter,
and had not the same prejudices as
her husband, was by no means pleased
with the observations she made in the
course of the day, nor with the pleasure she
saw for the first time in the eyes of Wil∣loughby
when the moment of their depar∣ture
arrived. This was not till four in the
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
morning. The late hour of dinner, and
the parties which were made for cards,
brought on a supper at near two, of which
Lady Castlenorth seemed to expect her
guests would partake: they staid there∣fore;
Lord Castlenorth retiring early, by
the advice of Mrs. Calder; and the uni∣versatility
of Lady Castlenorth's knowledge
being displayed the whole time to the ex∣treme
fatigue of Willoughby, and by no
means to the satisfaction of his sister, who
found in her aunt a desire to monopolize
not only all the conversation, but the at∣tention
of every man present, to whom
she contrived to address herself by turns,
and with whom she appeared immediately
offended, if Mrs. Molyneux, whom she
considered and treated as a pretty automa∣ton,
attracted even for a moment any of
that admiration that she was generally, at
her own parties and among her own friends,
accustomed to engross.</P>
<P>Willoughby was set down by his sister
at his own lodgings, and Mrs. Molyneux
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
herself knew nothing of Celestina's depar∣ture
till breakfast the next day; when bu∣sied
with preparations for a ball subscribed
for by some noblemen of her acquaintance,
she listened to the information hardly
knowing she received it, and testified no
other concern than by saying coldly—"I
wish she had staid till to-morrow, for she
has really something of a taste, and I
should have liked to have had her here
when I dress." This important dress, how∣ever,
was too momentous to suffer her to
think long of any human being; and
when her brother called upon her about
three o'clock, she was adjusting the orna∣ments
on a tiara of her own invention, and
had forgotten for the moment not only the
sudden journey of Celestina but Celestina
herself.</P>
<P>Willoughby sat down by her; and in
hopes of Celestina's coming in, entered
into conversation on frivolous subjects, to
which he in fact gave so little attention
that he hardly heard the answers his sister
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
gave him. He desired, however, to pro∣long
the time of his stay as much as possi∣ble,
that without asking for Celestina, he
might see her; and he knew, that busied
as Mrs. Molyneux was, he should have
an opportunity of speaking to her without
observation.</P>
<P>The tiara was at length ornamented,
and no Celestina appeared: Willoughby
then enquired why she did not assist at an
operation so important, and heard with
pain and amazement that she had left the
house at five o'clock that morning.</P>
<P>"And whither is she gone?" said he
in a voice hardly audible: "and how
could you suffer her to go?"</P>
<P>"Oh! as to that," answered Mrs. Mo∣lyneux,
quite regardless of his distress,
"she has taken those lodgings you know
in Devonshire that you have so often heard
her speak of; and for her going, you know
she has long determined on it, and indeed
I did not oppose it, thinking as things
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
are, it was the very best resolution she
could take."</P>
<P>"As things are!" repeated Willoughby,
trying vainly to stifle the painful sensation
his sister's coldness and insensibility gave
him: "I know not, Mrs. Molyneux,
what you mean exactly, but—"</P>
<P>He was proceeding, when the hair dresser,
who on these great occasions was employed
in preference to her own maid, was an∣nounced;
and Mrs. Molyneux, ordering
him into her powdering room, walked im∣mediately
away, and lest Willoughby sit∣ting
like a statue by the dressing table she
had left.</P>
<P>He remained there near a quarter of an
hour, in a state of mind difficult to be de∣scribed:
the danger to which Celestina
must be exposed, alone and unprotected;
the probability of his losing her for ever;
nay of her sacrificing herself to some of
those pretenders whom he doubted not
her beauty would attract, in the same spirit
of disinterested heroism, as that which had
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
determined her to quit London: the ex∣cessive
tenderness he was conscious of
towards her, against which he found every
hour the impossibility of contending, and
the encreasing disgust that he felt in con∣templating
the chains he had promised to
put on, all contributed to overwhelm his
mind with anguish, from which he saw
not how it was easy or even possible to
escape.</P>
<P>His first idea was to obtain a direction
to Celestina, and follow her immediately;
but he knew the delicacy of her mind, and
he felt perfectly what was due to her situa∣tion:—reflections
which checked those in∣tentions
almost as soon as they were formed;
and before he could decide on what he
ought to do, he received from Molyneux,
who had just come in and gone out again,
an unsealed note, containing these lines:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR GEORGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am just returned from Lincoln's Inn,
where I have been to meet Atkins and
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
some other cursed bores about money:
I cannot get what I want of them: do
contrive to let me have five hundred
this evening for my pocket, and I wish
you would arrange things so as to have
the remainder of the unpaid five thou∣sand
and interest ready by this day
sennight or it will much inconvenience
me. Castlenorth is your man; and it
is but speaking for the money to have it.
Let us see you to-morrow to dinner.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your's ever,
P. H. MOLYNEUX.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This note, so peremptorily requiring
what the writer knew Willoughby could
not obtain but by hastily confirming those
measures which were so displeasing to him;
this unfeeling precipitation, which ap∣peared
only a finesse to compel him to
plunge into them, roused Willoughby from
the state of undetermined anxiety he had
been in, into anger and indignation: his
first solicitude however was to raise in∣stantly
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
the five hundred pounds for that
evening's play, which was clearly the
meaning of his brother in law; and snatch∣ing
up his hat, he left the house, deter∣mining,
in the first emotions of his resent∣ment,
to enter it no more. He took his
way towards the city, and applying to a
banker in Lombard-street, in whose hands
his father had kept his money, and who
had had considerable advantages by his
own affairs during his minority, he obtained,
not without solicitation the most painful
to his pride and on terms as hard as
would have been demanded by a common
money lender, the sum he wanted; which
he enclosed in a cover, and sent by one of
the clerks, with these words:</P>
<P>"Mr. Willoughby encloses to Mr.
Molyneux the sum for which he has so
pressing an occasion, and assures him
he will lose no time in procuring the
rest, that all pecuniary transactions may
be at an end between them."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189"/>
It was with great difficulty he bridled
the natural vehemence of his temper, and
forbore to express with bitterness the dis∣pleasure
Molyneux's proceeding had given
him. More resolute than ever not to be
dictated to by his brother in law, and de∣testing
more than before the marriage
which was thus intended to be forced
upon him, dissatisfied with every idea
that occurred to him, and having no friend
in London to whom he could open his
oppressed heart, he determined at length
to procure a direction to Celestina, and re∣turning
immediately to Cambridge him∣self,
consult a friend he had there, on
whose judgment and attachment he had
an equal reliance, how he should avoid an
alliance with the woman he detested and
the hazard he now incurred of losing the
woman he adored.</P>
<P>He sent therefore a servant, as soon as
he returned to his lodgings, to procure
from the servants of Molyneux a copy of
the direction that had been put on the
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
trunks sent to Celestina. This being ob∣tained,
he ordered a post chaise, and late
as it was, and without giving any account
of himself either to his sister or the Castle∣norths,
he set out for Cambridge, and ar∣rived
at his college about four in the morn∣ing
of the next day.</P>

<P>CELESTINA in the mean time be∣came
better reconciled to the plan of life
she had adopted; and after being near a
week at her new abode, during which
time she heard nothing either of Willough∣by
or his sister, she wrote to the latter as
follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>My dear Mrs. Molyneux will be glad
to hear that her wandering friend is set∣tled
contentedly, if not happily, in her
new abode, and has already subdued
her mind to her fortune so much as to
regret only the society of those she has
been so long accustomed to love, and
by no means the scenes in which she has
left them. My habitation is in the
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
house of a man who was formerly master
of a coasting vessel, in which occupa∣tion
having made money enough to
support himself and his wife in their old
age, and all his children being married
and provided for, he built this house a
few miles from the port where he used
to trade: their only servant is a mere
West country paisanne, who does the
business which the good old woman
herself is unequal to; whose not fre∣quent,
but somewhat loud and shrill
remonstrances to Jenny, when she is
careless or neglectful, are the only
sounds I ever hear to remind me that
there are such things as anger or con∣tention
in the world. The scene around
me is now dreary enough; but in a few
weeks spring will produce new plea∣sures
for me; and I shall hail the first
primrose with as much delight as I can
feel from any thing, but from that most
welcome sight, the face of an old friend.
My dear Matilda, you pity, I know, the
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
merely negative life I have chosen: en∣liven
it then sometimes by your kind
recollection, and find time now and
then to write to me, if it be only to say,
you are well. Your brother's marriage
may at this period occupy you; yet I
hope you will not even now forget me,
nor fail to recollect the tender interest
which must ever exist for your happiness,
and that of all you love, in the grateful
heart of your affectionate</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter arrived a day after Willough∣by's
abrupt departure. Between the conti∣nual
and unceasing hurry in which she
lived, and her vexation at that event, she
hardly read it, but threw it carelessly by
on her toilet, where it remained forgotten
like the writer of it.</P>
<P>On the day Willoughby had dined and
supped in Grosvenor-street, the whole fa∣mily
had been much dissatisfied with his con∣duct,
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
except his uncle; who retaining much
of form and ceremony in his own manners,
was willing to impute his coldness to re∣spect,
and his distant civility to veneration:
but the mother and daughter were by no
means content with his deportment; and
though they concealed their feelings as it
were by mutual consent, their pride was
equally alarmed, and both resolved to have
an early explanation</P>
<P>Lady Castlenorth, however, whose policy
only had power to restrain awhile the
ebullitions of her wounded pride, waited one
day in hopes that Willoughby would in a fa∣mily
conference testify more ardour for the
match than he had done in mixed company;
but Willoughby never appeared; and her
indignation now knowing no bounds, she
ordered her coach, and on the next, stalked
with more than usual majesty into the
dressing room of Mrs. Molyneux just as
she had finished her breakfast, which was,
owing to the hour on which she went to
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
bed the preceding morning, even later
than usual.</P>
<P>Lady Castlenorth hardly spoke to Mrs.
Molyneux when she entered, but demanded
in an imperious tone what was become of
Mr. Willoughby.</P>
<P>The lady to whom she thus abruptly
addressed herself was as haughty and of as
high consequence in her own estimation as
Lady Castlenorth herself; and feeling and
resenting her rude and peremptory stile,
she answered, with almost as little complai∣sance
in her manner, that she knew not.</P>
<P>"You don't know, Madam!" ex∣claimed
the imperious Viscountess; "you
don't know! Very extraordinary surely.
What am I to understand from all this?"</P>
<P>"Of that also I am ignorant," replied
Mrs. Molyneux. "Mr. Willoughby,
Madam, is his own master; and I really
can no more account for than direct his
actions,"</P>
<P>"Astonishing!" re-assumed Lady Cas∣tlenorth;
"that a man situated as he is,
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
who is not an absolute ideot, should he∣have
in this manner in an affair on which
his very existence as a man of fashion de∣pends:
but don't imagine, Mistress Moly∣neux,
that <HI>my</HI> daughter—"</P>
<P>"Dear Madam," interrupted Matilda,
irritated by the supercilious and insolent
tone in which her Ladyship spoke, and
particularly the emphasis she put on the
word Mistress, "I beg and entreat that you
will spare your anger. I at least cannot
deserve it, for I have no influence over
my brother. I dare say he has some rea∣sons
for having left London so abruptly,
though I assure you I do not know them."</P>
<P>"You don't!—I do: he is gone after that
creature, whom your mother, to her utter
disgrace, brought up in the family, and
with whom she suffered her son to live in
habits of intimacy which shock me every
time I think of it."</P>
<P>At this moment Mr. Molyneux entered
with a letter in his hand, and hardly in his
haste noticing Lady Castlenorth, he told
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
his wife that the letter was that instant deli∣vered
to him by an express, that his father
was dying, and that they must immediately
set out for Ireland at his earnest entreaty.
"Hasten therefore," said he, "to pre∣pare
yourself, for the chaise I have sent for
will be at the door in a moment. Your
Ladyship will excuse us I am sure on such
an occasion," added he, addressing himself
to Lady Castlenorth. "Matilda, we have
not a moment to lose: direct your maid
to prepare what you want to take with you,
and to follow herself with the baggage that
may not be so immediately necessary."</P>
<P>"And where is Willoughby?" cried
Lady Castlenorth, raising her voice: "I
insist upon seeing him."</P>
<P>"I believe he has left London," an∣swered
Molyneux; "but I assure you I
know not whither he is gone. I dare say
your Ladyship will soon hear of him. In
the mean time pray pardon me; it is im∣possible
for me now to have the honour of
attending you."</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198"/>
He then left the room, as his wife had
done already; and Lady Castlenorth,
bursting with anger and indignation which
she had nobody to listen to, returned in
all the fury of mortified pride to her own
house.</P>
<P>While she was there meditating how to
revenge the neglect shewn to her daughter,
of which she now no longer doubted, Wil∣loughby
was pouring out all the distresses
of his heart to a friend whom heaven seemed
to have sent him for their alleviation.</P>
<P>Mr. Vavasour, his most intimate friend,
had been absent when he left Cambridge
on his hasty and reluctant journey to Lon∣don,
but was now returned, and to him
Willoughby immediately disclosed the
cause of that uneasiness which his friend
perceived he suffered under even before he
spoke.</P>
<P>"What shall I do?" said he, as he
leaned on the table, "how extricate my∣self
from the most insupportable of en∣gagements?
how satisfy this narrow and un∣feeling
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
Molyneux? my soul revolts from
the odious necessity of being obliged to
him for forbearance: yet to sell my estates—is
more painful to me than any measure
but marrying Miss Fitz-Hayman. Yet my
promise, my assurances to my mother—I
see not how I can escape from the diffi∣culties
that encompass me."</P>
<P>"You make more of them surely, my
dear George," replied Vavasour, "than is
necessary. What! should either a promise
or an exigence compel you to be miserable
for life; then indeed there would be no
escape: but now, surely, my friend, your
escape is not difficult."</P>
<P>"Were you situated as I am then, how
would you act?"</P>
<P>"Why I would without hesitation de∣clare
off with the woman I did not like, and
marry the woman I did: that is, if I were
disposed to marry at all."</P>
<P>"And would you do this, Vavasour,
contrary to a solemn promise given to her
who cannot now release me from it? and
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
then how can I act in regard to Molyneux?
be the consequence what it will he shall
never again dun me for money, and—"</P>
<P>"Never!" interrupted Vavasour warmly,
"if you will listen to me. I am not quite
of age it is true, but my fortune is such,
that nothing is easier than for me to raise
this paltry five thousand pounds, or twice the
sum, on no very exorbitant terms. I have
already taken up money for my own plea∣sures,
and shall I hesitate when my friend
has real occasion for it? In a week's time
the money shall be ready for you. Pray
then let us hear no more of any difficulties
of that sort, and as for your promise—the
good lady, when she extorted it, could never
think it binding."</P>
<P>"Speak not lightly of her, my dear
friend," cried Willoughby, "that I may
feel all the kindness of the former part of
your speech without alloy: she was a wo∣man
whom, had you known, you would
have reverenced and loved, and it was in
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
kindness only that she made me give her
an engagement—"</P>
<P>"To make yourself miserable. I am,
you know, George, an Epicurean; you are
somewhat of a Stoic I suppose; and if that
is the case, fulfil your promise, take your
heiress, and philosophize at your leisure. I
have never seen your Celestina, you know;
but from your description of her, and your
long attachment, I should pity you—I am
afraid I should despise you—I am sure I
should not love you—were you to sacrifice
such a creature to any pecuniary considera∣tions.
Come, my dear fellow, assure
yourself that if five thousand pounds or
more will relieve you from what weighs
on your spirits about Molyneux's matter,
it is your's; the other affair you must settle
with your own heart, and I leave you to ar∣gue
it together."</P>
<P>Vavasour then quitted the room; and
Willoughby, released from his anxiety
about his debt by the generosity of his
friend, gave himself up to all those plea∣sant
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
images which presented themselves to
his mind. To be united immediately with
Celestina, to carry her down to Alvestone,
and there to enter on a plan of oeconomy
which should in a very few years retrieve
his circumstances, was a vision which he
found so much delight in cherishing, that
he drove from his mind as much as possible
the painful objections that still cruelly in∣truded
themselves to destroy it: the con∣versation
of Vavasour helped to put
them entirely to flight; and Willoughby,
persuaded that by the projects of oeconomy
he had formed he should soon be enabled
to pay his friend the money so generously
offered him, agreed without much hesita∣tion
to accept it. The young men then
settled that they would go the next day
but one to London, stay there long enough
to negociate this business, and then go
down together to Alvestone, from whence
Willoughby, who had no inclination to
encounter Lady Castlenorth personally,
determined to write to his uncle, resigning
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
all pretensions to the honor intended him,
and immediately to complete his marriage
with her who had so long been mistress of
his heart. This arrangement, once made,
became every moment more seducing to
his imagination; still the words of his mo∣ther,
the solemn charge given him with
her last breath, returned now and then to
disturb his visionary felicity: but Celes∣tina,
always so lovely in his eyes, leaning
on his arm amid the shades of Alvestone,
the delight of all who beheld her, the ad∣miration
of his friends, the patroness of
his tenants, the protectress of the poor,
was an image so deliciously soothing to
his fancy, that by indulging it he at
length persuaded himself that his mother,
who had so very tenderly loved her, would,
could she be sensible of all the happiness
they should share together, applaud his
violation of his promise and sanction his
choice.</P>
<P>Vavasour, gay, generous, open hearted,
and volatile, always eagerly following him∣self
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
his own inclinations, and as warmly
solicitous for his friend's gratification as his
own, encouraged as much as possible all
tendency in Willoughby to throw off any
adherence to what he deemed tyranny be∣yond
the grave; and by the time the ne∣gociation
for the loan was completed,
which took them up near a week, Wil∣loughby
had no longer any scruples remain∣ing.
His only business in town then was
to pay Molyneux, whose conduct had of∣fended
him so much that he had not been
to the house: as soon however as the mo∣ney
was ready, he wrote a note to his bro∣ther
in law, signifying that he would on
the next day meet him at his attorney's
chambers to settle all accounts between
them. The servant who was sent brought
the note back; and Willoughby then first
learning that his sister and her husband
were embarked for Ireland, deposited the
money at a banker's, and wrote a cold let∣ter
to Molyneux, signifying that it waited
his orders. He then gave directions to
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
his own solicitor to take proper receipts on
the payment of it, and with Vavasour
hastened down to Alvestone, in the neigh∣bourhood
of which place he knew Celes∣tina
was; but he had determined not to
see her till he had obviated every
objection she could make to his plan of
happiness, by breaking at once and for
ever with the Castlenorths; a task on which,
resolved as he was to execute it, he could
not think without a mixture of concern
and apprehension that he was ashamed of
feeling, and dared by no means betray to
his friend Vavasour; who, without knowing
any thing of the Castlenorths himself, had
made up his mind that they were an odious
and disagreeable set, and from such, what∣ever
might be their rank, he always flew
away himself, and encouraged his friends
to do it at whatever risk. If he was care∣less
and even rude towards those whom he
did not wish to please, he was altogether
as amiable and attentive to those to whom
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
he sought to be acceptable. His dislikes
and his attachments were equally warm,
and the latter had hitherto been rather
warm than permanent.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE these things were passing at
Cambridge and in London, Celestina un∣derwent
the cruellest anxiety at not hearing
from Mrs. Molyneux; but all her conjec∣tures
ended in the painful conclusion that
the preparations and celebration of Wil∣loughby's
marriage entirely engaged her,
and prevented her writing. All her rea∣son
was now summoned to support her
against the shock which the certainty of
this event would give her. With a beat∣ing
heart, and in breathless agitation, she
ran over the paper which once a week a
travelling newsman brought from Exeter,
and where she knew the marriage of a
man of so much consequence in the neigh∣bourhood
would not fail to be inserted.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208"/>
No such intelligence however appeared;
and Celestina, imagining that the marriage
had notwithstanding certainly taken place,
endeavoured, since she could not conquer
her regret, to divert it, by trying what
she could do towards softening the sor∣rows
and relieving the distresses of the
unfortunate Jessy, whose patient endurance
of evils, evidently severer than her own,
whose fortitude in tearing herself perhaps
for ever from the man she loved, and sa∣crificing
the indulgence of her affection
to his interest, made Celestina sometimes
ashamed of the murmurs she found excited
in her heart by less inconveniences, and
blush at the reluctance with which she had
submitted to the loss of a man, whose regard
for her seemed already to have yielded to
the influence of pecuniary advantage, and
family convenience.</P>
<P>But in despite of every argument she
could bring to subdue the pain arising
from the recollection of lost happiness, and
totally silence the Syren voice of hope which
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
now and then presented the possibility of
more favourable days, the uncertainty whe∣ther
the event to which she laboured to be∣come
reconciled had really happened,
disturbed and rendered her restless and
uneasy. Jessy, to whom she now sent to
desire her company for a little time, joy∣fully
accepted the summons; and in her
company Celestina felt great satisfaction,
though she had never disclosed to her any
part of the sorrow that oppressed her, or
given the remotest hint of her attachment
to Willoughby. All the indulgence she
allowed herself was, that of sometimes
chusing to walk towards a knoll at the
extremity of the common, which afforded
an extensive view towards the west; from
thence, by the help of a telescope lent her
by her landlord, Celestina had discovered
a clump of firs in Alvestone Park; and
though they were near ten miles distant,
and without a glass appeared only a dark
spot above the rest of the landscape, she
found a melancholy pleasure in distin∣guishing
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
them, and would frequently, as
she leant on Jessy's arm in their pensive
rambles, fix her eyes on that distant ob∣ject,
gaze on it steadily for two or three
minutes, and then with a deep sigh turn
away, and walk silently home.</P>
<P>She encouraged however the artless
Jessy to talk to her of Cathcart; and the
poor girl, pleased with every opportunity
of repeating his name, and flattered by the
tender interest Celestina took in their
story, was never weary of speaking of him.
She at length acquired confidence enough
to produce some of the letters he wrote to
her; and Celestina, who had very natu∣rally
imputed much of the praise Jessy had
bestowed on his writing and on his style
to the fond partiality of her affection for
him, was surprised to find in these letters
the most manly, clear, and sensible stile
she had almost ever met with. The ge∣nerous
emulation which appeared between
these lovers, their disinterested tenderness,
and the steadiness of their mutual attach∣ment,
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
raised in Celestina admiration and
even respect, and every hour encreased her
inclination to contribute to their happiness.</P>
<P>But these intentions she had no way
of executing but by means of Willoughby,
who was, as she knew from long experi∣ence,
ever ready to befriend the unfortu∣nate;
and on such an occasion she thought,
that as soon as he was married she might,
without any impropriety, address herself
to him; and as the farm which old Win∣nington,
the grandfather of Jessy, possessed,
adjoined to his estate at Alvestone, Ce∣lestina
imagined he could hardly fail of
having some influence, which she knew
he would be ready to exert for her unfor∣tunate
friend.</P>
<P>In meditating how to administer to the
afflictions of others, her own sorrows were
at least mitigated: but the calm she out∣wardly
assumed was the mere effort of re∣solution,
while her anxiety to hear of Wil∣loughby
and of his sister encreased every
hour; and as the delay grew more unac∣countable,
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
it became almost insupportably
painful.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of March:
the weather was uncommonly cold and
dreary; and a deep snow, which had
fallen some days before, had confined Ce∣lestina
and her companion almost entirely
to the house. It was very unusual to see
any person pass by the house, near which
there was no public road, and the incle∣mency
of the season rendered it still less
frequent: Jessy, therefore, who went to
the window by accident to fetch some
work that lay there, mentioned to Celestina,
as a matter of some surprise, that two foot
passengers, who had the appearance of gen∣tlemen,
were crossing the common towards
the house.</P>
<P>Celestina, who was at that moment me∣ditating,
with her eyes fixed on the fire,
on the long, long space of time that had
elapsed since she had heard of Willough∣by,
and on all the events that might have
taken place in that period, gave very little
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
attention to this intelligence, and on Jessy's
repeating it, answered that probably it was
some persons who had lost their way in
the snow and were coming to the house
for directions to regain the road.</P>
<P>To Jessy, however, the idea of Cathcart
was ever present: one of the strangers was
not unlike him in figure as she fancied,
though both were wrapped in great coats;
and the possibility of his having come in
search of her, had no sooner struck her,
than with eager eyes and a beating heart
she watched every step they took: at
length they entered the little gate that di∣vided
the garden of the house from the
common; Jessy was then convinced that
neither of them were Cathcart; but her
curiosity was strongly excited, and listen∣ing
to the questions they put to the servant
who went to the door, she distinctly heard
one of them enquire for Miss de Mornay.</P>
<P>Celestina was now in her turn alarmed;
and trembling, though she knew not why,
she desired Jessy to go down and ask who
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
it was, but before she could be obeyed the
door opened, and she saw, with emotions
to which language cannot do justice—Willoughby
himself!</P>
<P>The first idea that struck her was, that
he was come to announce his marriage;
and the air of triumph and satisfaction his
countenance wore, seemed to tell her he
was the happy husband of Miss Fitz-Hay∣man.
Long as she had been accustomed
to dwell on this idea, she shrunk with ter∣ror
from it's supposed reality, and pale and
trembling drew back, as he eagerly ad∣vanced
towards her:—"My heavenly
girl! my own Celestina!" cried he as he
took her hand. This address, from the
married Willoughby, seemed an insult: she
withdrew her hand with an air of resent∣ment,
would have spoken but could not,
and unable to support herself sat down.</P>
<P>Willoughby, whose own anxious emo∣tions
had too much prevented his consi∣dering
how she might be affected by his
abrupt appearance, now saw that he had
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
been too precipitate. He placed himself
by her, and again taking the hand she had
withdrawn, he enquired, with more ten∣derness
and less impetuosity, if she was
sorry to see him. Again Celestina would
have spoken, but her native pride again
refused to assist her; and while she was
vainly endeavouring to acquire resolution
enough to congratulate him on his sup∣posed
marriage, she learned that he had
not only broken for ever with Miss Fitz-Hayman,
but was come to offer himself
to her, who had from his childhood been
the sole possessor of his affections.</P>
<P>This sudden and unexpected happiness
was too much. Her reason, which in the
severest calamity had never quite deserted
her, now seemed unequal to tidings so
overwhelming, and for a moment or
two she sat like a statue; till Willoughby,
in that well known voice, and with that
graceful and manly tenderness which had
rendered him ever so dear to her, related
all that had passed from the hour of their
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
last parting, and the resolution he had
adopted of sacrificing that wealth, which
could not bestow happiness, to the long
and incurable passion he had conceived
for an object so deserving, and without
whom no advantages of fortune or situa∣tion
could give his life the smallest value.</P>
<P>Tears of gratitude and affection now
fell from the eyes of Celestina; and as he
found the tumult of her spirits subside, he
went on to relate to her, with the most
generous delicacy, the plans he had formed
for their future life, and the means by
which he hoped to retrieve his affairs,
without sacrificing his happiness. Ten∣derly
however as he touched on these sub∣jects,
his violated promise to his mother
returned with all it's force to the recollec∣tion
of Celestina. Willoughby, whose
eyes were fixed on her's, saw the painful
idea by their expression as soon as it arose,
and in a voice that trembled from emotions
he could not repress, he endeavoured to
obviate the objections he feared she was
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
about to make, even before she could ut∣ter
them.</P>
<P>All his eloquence, however, could not
silence that monitor in the breast of Ce∣lestina,
which told her that there was
more of sophistry than of sound reason in
his arguments; but fondly attached to
him as she was, it was sophistry too en∣chanting
for her to have courage to at∣tempt
detecting it. She wished to be con∣vinced
Willoughby was right; to see him
happy had almost from her earliest recol∣lection
been the second wish of her heart;
for perhaps to have the power of making
him so had always, even unknown to
herself, been the first: that happiness
seemed now to depend upon her; and she
determined (after one of those short strug∣gles,
in which, when inclination and duty
contend, the former has too often the ad∣vantage,)
to stisle within her own bosom
every painful remembrance, to think as
he thought, and in rendering happy the
son of her benesactress, to acquit herself
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
through her future life of the debt of grati∣tude
she owed her.</P>
<P>Celestina, therefore, made no objection
to the proposals Willoughby laid before
her, which were, that they should be mar∣ried
privately in about ten days, and take
up their abode at Alvestone in the same
stile they meant always to reside in. These
preliminaries being arranged, Willoughby
besought her to permit him to introduce
Vavasour to her, who had been waiting be∣low;
he went down himself to bring up
his friend; and Celestina, in the moment
of his absence, endeavoured to recall her
presence of mind, and habituate herself to
think with less agitation on the happiness
of being the wife of her beloved Wil∣loughby.</P>
<P>Vavasour, from the ardour with which
his friend had spoken of her personal per∣fections,
was prepared to find her very
lovely; and Willoughby on their first in∣terview
watched his looks, trying to dis∣cover
if his expectations had been an∣swered:
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
they were compleatly so: the
agitation she had suffered had raised the
glow of her cheeks, and given more soft∣ness
to her eyes, in which the tears yet trem∣bled;
while the natural dignity of her
manner received in his opinion new charms
from the remains of embarrassment which
she endeavoured to shake off, and in which,
after a few moments, she succeeded so well,
that they all became as much at their ease
as if they had all been as long acquainted
as Willoughby and Celestina.</P>
<P>Jessy, who had left the room on Wil∣loughby's
first entrance, was now desired
by Celestina to return. During her short
absence, while she prepared a repast of
cold meat for the hungry travellers who
had walked from Alvestone, Celestina re∣lated
to them as much of her history as
interested both of them in her favour; and
Willoughby, who found in every sentiment
and every action of Celestina something
to encrease his tenderness and admiration,
was charmed with the generous pity she
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
had shewn to her humble friend, and pro∣mised
her all his influence to obtain for
her the provision she had a right to ex∣pect
from her grandfather, and unite her
to her deserving lover.</P>
<P>Willoughby hung with fondness ap∣proaching
to adoration on every word Ce∣lestina
uttered, and forgot, that for this time
the delight of seeing her must be short;
Vavasour, gay, volatile, and enjoying
with extreme good humour the happiness
of his friend, was little accustomed to think
at all; and Jessy was in too humble a
situation to offer her opinion: on Celestina
only, therefore, the prudence of the whole
party depended; and as the snow was very
deep, and they had between eight and nine
miles to Alvestone, she at last ventured
to hint that it was time they should go.</P>
<P>To Willoughby, the necessity of quitting
her had never occurred, and he now heard
of it as a sentence of banishment; but
Celestina repeating that she should be very
uneasy if in such weather they delayed so
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
long a walk to a late hour in the evening, he
saw that he should make her really uncom∣fortable
by his stay; and having obtained
leave to see her the next day, and every
day till they were to part no more, he at
last consented to go, that he and his com∣panion
might reach Alvestone before the
night fell.</P>
<P>When he released the hand of Celestina,
which he kissed a thousand times as he
bade her adieu, she turned towards the
window, and her eyes followed him
across the heath till the furze and
thorns at a distance concealed him from
her sight. The very traces of his footsteps
in the snow were dear to her; and in that
frame of mind which renders it hardly
conscious of it's own sensations, she still
gazed on <HI>them</HI> when she could distinguish
<HI>him</HI> no longer. Jessy, though she could
easily account for her silence, became
after some time uneasy, and speaking to
her, roused her from her reverie: she then
sat down in her usual place, and attempted
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
to quiet the perturbation of her mind by
re-assuming her usual occupations; but
the sudden transition within the last three
hours, from lifeless despondence to a pros∣pect
of the utmost felicity she had ever
imagined, was too violent to suffer her
spirits to return to their usual calm. The
recollection of her deceased benefactress,
and of the fatal promise Willoughby had
given her, recurred in despite of her en∣deavours
to escape from it: and though,
resolute as he appeared to be, to reconcile
himself to its violation, there was nobody
who had power by their interference to pre∣vent
the execution of the determination he
had made; though nothing was likely to
prevent the marriage on which he had re∣solved
upon; yet the mind of Celestina re∣mained
impressed with a confused sensa∣tion
rather than any distinct prospect of
the happiness she had been offered; and
the transactions of the day appeared like a
dream, from which she feared, by examin∣ing
it's reality, to be awakened.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER the person or the mind
of Celestina were of that sort which make
the strongest impression on the first view;
and interesting as her figure and face were,
it was the grace as well as the symmetry of
the former, and the expression rather than
the beauty of the latter that made her
altogether so enchanting. Willoughby
and Vavasour were now with her every
day; and while her lover found in every
hour of those days more reason to congra∣tulate
himself on the choice he had made,
his friend grew insensibly so interested for
Celestina, that volatile and unsteady as he
had been till then, he found, that though,
considering her already as Willoughby's
wife, he could form neither hopes or de∣signs
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
for himself, yet that her happiness
was the first wish of his heart; and that
without violating his warm friendship to∣wards
his friend, he, for the first time in
his life, envied a man who was going to
be married.</P>
<P>The present happiness of Willoughby
could be exceeded in his idea only by that
which he imagined he had secured to him∣self
by having determined to live only for
the happiness of Celestina; and in conti∣nually
contemplating her perfections, he
endeavoured to justify to himself the mea∣sures
he had taken, and to dismiss from
his mind the unpleasing circumstances
which might have robbed him of her for
ever. He had written, after many attempts,
to Lord Castlenorth, declining to carry any
farther a negociation in which his inclina∣tions
had never any share; and though he
softened this mortifying information as
well as he could, he was sensible of the
bitterness and resentment it must create,
and indeed was so little satisfied himself
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
with his performance, that after the fifth or
sixth attempt, he would still have delayed
or wholly have evaded sending the letter,
if Vavasour had not with many arguments
and much difficulty persuaded him, that,
resolved as he was to break with the fa∣mily,
any letter he could write in explana∣tion,
would be less offensive than total si∣lence.</P>
<P>Celestina was very solicitous to know
how he had acquitted himself towards his
uncle; yet, as he seemed sedulously to
avoid the subject, she feared to give him
pain by recurring to it, and yielded per∣haps
too easily to the artifices she saw he
used to draw her thoughts from it: while
he, studying every turn of her speaking
face, often saw, by the pensive cast it as∣sumed,
uneasy thoughts arise in her mind;
and on those occasions, exerting himself to
dispel them, he delighted to recall their
sparkling vivacity to her eyes:
<Q>E'l lampeggiar dell' angelico riso,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PETRARCH. The lightning of the angelic smile.</NOTE></Q>
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
which never bestowed greater charms on
any countenance than on that of Celestina.</P>
<P>It was now decided that as soon as the
settlements were finished, which Willough∣by
had directed rather according to his
love than to his fortune, and which were
likely to take up about three weeks, Ce∣lestina
was to become mistress of Alvestone.
He had promised her to forbear making
about that delightful place any of the al∣terations
he meditated, till his income was
so far retrieved as to allow him to do it
with prudence, but he had a thousand rea∣sons
ready why Celestina should go there
every day; for to reside there entirely, till
she was married, she had refused with such
firmness as left Willoughby nothing to
urge with any chance of success. Partial
as himself to this spot, where she had
passed the happiest hours of her life, she
yet, in her present situation, felt distressed
and uneasy at the thoughts of visiting it;
but Willoughby pressed it with so much
earnestness, that, as the weather was now
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
fine, and she had defended herself as long
as she could, she at length, on condition
of having Jessy with her, agreed to go
there for a whole day, and that Wil∣loughby
should fetch them both in his
phaeton. <HI>C'est le premier pas qui coute,</HI>
says a French proverb; and he longed to
have this day over, knowing that the
memorials of his mother, which Celestina
would there meet with, and which he
feared would give her some uneasy sensa∣tions,
would, after she was accustomed to
see them, lose their effect on her mind,
and that she would insensibly learn to be∣hold
them rather with agreeable than un∣easy
sentiments.</P>
<P>He persuaded himself that such a revo∣lution
had been effected in his own mind,
and that notwithstanding his clear recol∣lection
of certain forcible words his mother
had used in their last melancholy inter∣view,
he was, in making himself happy,
doing that, which, if she had yet any know∣ledge
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
of human events, she would most
warmly approve.</P>
<P>Intoxicated with his passion, which rea∣son
and taste seemed so entirely to justify,
and an extorted promise only to oppose,
Willoughby no longer suffered any uneasy
recollections to cast a shade over the
bright prospect opening before him. He
now saw Celestina, the woman he had
from his infancy adored, in that spot where
his local affections were so fondly settled.
Nothing seemed likely to impede his passing
with her there a life of uninterrupted feli∣city;
and till their union could take place,
his greatest anxiety was to detach her
imagination from all those objections which
might yet linger in her mind, and to con∣firm
her in the persuasion that to constitute
through her future life the happiness of the
son of her benefactress, would be her best
acquittal of those obligations she owed to
her in the early part of it.</P>
<P>Instead, therefore, of suffering her to
visit immediately the particular parts of
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
the house which he knew would most
forcibly recall ideas which might distress
her, he desired Vavasour to attend on Jessy,
and follow them into the garden, where,
when they were at a little distance, he re∣lated
to Celestina the measures he had
already taken to restore or rather to in∣troduce
her amiable and injured friend to
the favour of her grandfather. Celestina
warmly approved his proceedings, and
gratefully acknowledged his kindness,
while the hope of seeing Jessy rescued
from the severe hardships to which she must
otherwise be exposed, and rewarding the
disinterested attachment of her deserving
lover, was most grateful to her generous
heart. Willoughby himself never seemed
so perfect as when thus employing his time
and his power in the service of the un∣happy.
The fine scenery around her ne∣ver
appeared to such advantage as now,
when she leaned on one arm while with
the other he pointed out to her its various
beauties; and at this moment the very
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
season seemed to add something to her
felicity. Within a few days the whole
face of nature was changed: the snow,
which had covered every object with
cold uniformity, had now given place
to the bright verdure of infant spring;
the earliest trees and those in the most
sheltered situations had put forth their ten∣der
buds; the copses were strewn with
primroses and March violets, and the
garden glowing with the first flowers of
the year; while instead of the usually rude
winds of the season, those gales only blew
which
<Q><L>Call forth the long expecting flowers</L>
<L>And wake the purple year!</L></Q>
Myriads of birds, who found food and
shelter amid the shrubberies and wood∣walks,
seemed to hail with songs their
future lovely protectress,
<Q>Hopp'd in her walks and gambol'd in her eyes:</Q>
and while every thing was thus gay and
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
cheerful without, the house, when she en∣tered
it, shewed her only contented faces:
the old servants, it's ancient and faithful
inhabitants, had known and loved her from
her earliest childhood, and rejoiced in the
hope of ending their days in her service;
the tenants, who loved their young land∣lord,
were glad to find, that instead of
carrying his rents to London he was
coming to settle among them; and the
poor, who had now for some time severely
missed the bounty which had marked Mrs.
Willoughby's annual residence among
them, invoked blessings on her son, from
whom they were assured of more constant
consideration, from his own noble nature
as well as from the influence of Celestina,
who, as they well remembered, was for∣merly
the successful mediatrix between
them and their deceased mistress, when
her own daughter had frequently heard
their petitions with indifference, or avoided
them with disgust.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232"/>
In a few days after this first visit to
Alvestone, a fortunate circumstance oc∣curred
to facilitate the good offices Wil∣loughby
had undertaken in favour of
Jessy Woodburn. The old female rela∣tion
who had acquired unbounded influ∣ence
over her grandfather died suddenly;
and the old man, thus restored to the little
power of reflection his very advanced age
left him, and alarmed by the death of a
person younger than himself, no longer re∣fused
to listen to the remonstrances of a
clergyman in the neighbourhood, who had
by Willoughby been engaged to speak to
him in favour of his daughter's child. He
consented to see her, provided no attempt
was made to introduce her father to him,
towards whom neither time, age, or sick∣ness,
had blunted the asperity of his hatred;
but though these odious passions retained,
from habitual indulgence, all their inve∣terate
malignity, the softer feelings of na∣tural
affection were dead in him; and ra∣ther
yielding to importunity than prompted
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
by inclination, he consented to receive
his granddaughter to officiate about him as
a servant, and stipulated that during his
life she should be no expence to him;
thus grasping to the last moment of his
existence, that which he had never en∣joyed,
and could no longer want. As he
had nobody he valued more, he con∣sented
however, after many persuasions, to
make a will, by which he gave her every
thing, on the express condition, to use his
own phrase, that her father "might never
be the better for it."</P>
<P>It was necessary, though this important
point was carried, that Jessy should, by
residing with him, preclude the possibility
of being again superceded by some of
those mercenary beings who are in all
ranks of life ready to surround the couch
of the dying miser: a necessity Celestina
admitted with reluctance, and Jessy with
tears and regret; but they were both
consoled by the reflection that a very
short time must in some degree re-unite
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
them by the removal of Celestina to Alves∣tone,
which was within a walk of the farm
at which her friend was now to reside.</P>
<P>Willoughby, having thus far succeeded
for the interesting protegée of Celestina,
determined to complete his generous work
by attending to the situation of Cathcart.
He knew nothing could more highly
oblige <HI>her,</HI> to contribute to whose slightest
satisfaction was the supreme pleasure of
his life; and his own good heart prompted
him to lose no time in relieving the un∣merited
distresses of a deserving young
man: he wrote, therefore, (without com∣municating
what he had done) to Cath∣cart,
enclosed him a bank note for his
expences; and informing him of all that
passed in regard to Jessy, desired that he
would relinquish his place with the attor∣ney,
and come down to Alvestone, where
Willoughby meant that the same day which
gave him Celestina should unite Cathcart
to her humble friend.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235"/>
The joy this unexpected turn of fortune
gave to Cathcart can better be imagined
than described. That sickness of the soul,
which long despondence and anxiety had
produced, vanished at once: his imme∣diate
care was to secure his sister's and
her children's support during his absence;
and reserving to himself no more of Wil∣loughby's
generous present than sufficed
for the expences of his journey, he took a
tender leave of Mrs. Elphinstone, assuring
her that the first use he would make of his
good fortune should be to assist her; he
then set out on a hired horse for Alvestone,
where he arrived ten days before that which
was fixed upon for his patron's happiness
and his own.</P>
<P>If Willoughby had been greatly inte∣rested
for him before he saw him, he was
much more so now that he found him very
intelligent and well informed, with abilities
that might have made his way to any si∣tuation
of life, and a heart that would
have done honour to the most exalted:
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
his knowledge, which was very extensive,
was without pedantry, and his gratitude
without servility. The meeting between
him and Jessy, at which Willoughby con∣trived
that Celestina should be present,
was very affecting; and after the first
transports of happiness so unexpected had
a little subsided, Willoughby explained
to them his views for the future. "You,
my dear Jessy," said he, "must not think
of leaving your grandfather, who must
know nothing of your marriage while he
lives, which can, according to the course
of nature, be only a very little time; and
as you may see each other every day, this
partial separation may for that little time
be easily borne. As for you, Cathcart,
you will stay with me: I have, in conse∣quence
of my new plan of life, many re∣gulations
to make, and many accounts to
settle, in which you can be of great use
to me. Poor Beechcroft, my old steward,
is in his eightieth year, and the palsy has
lately made such ravages in his intel∣lects,
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
that he is unequal to the common
business of his office; while he lives how∣ever,
and thinks himself capable of exe∣cuting
his trust, I am very unwilling to
mortify him by taking the affairs out of
his hands: at his death I shall not replace
him, but become my own steward; and
you, my good friend, can be of the most
effectual service to me in preparing every
thing for this arrangement: while your
neighbourhood to the estate of which you
will probably soon become master, will
give you an opportunity of inspecting it,
and settling those plans for the future
which will I hope and believe make you
a very fortunate man."</P>
<P>While the considerate kindness of Wil∣loughby
endeared him every hour to Ce∣lestina,
and while the hearts of Cathcart
and Jessy overflowed with gratitude, it
would have been hardly possible for a hap∣pier
party to have been any where found
than that which now occasionally inha∣bited
Alvestone, if the painful recollection
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
of Willoughby's violated promise could
have been entirely expelled from the con∣scious
recollection of Celestina, and if
Vavasour had not sometimes felt towards
Celestina something bordering on serious
love, which was a sentiment so new to
him, who had never thought with respect∣ful
affection of any woman before, and
had passed too much of his time in scenes
of fashionable debauchery, that he hardly
knew himself what it meant. He formed
however no designs, for his temper was
generous, candid, and artless; so artless
indeed that he took no pains to conceal
what he felt almost without understanding
his feelings; and frequently fixed his
eyes on Celestina with so impassioned a
look, or spoke to her, or of her, with such
unreserved marks of fondness and admira∣tion,
that Jessy and Cathcart both saw it
with some alarm; but Willoughby, too
liberal for jealousy, and knowing his friend
more inclined to general libertinism among
the looser part of the sex than capable of
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
a particular attachment to any woman of
character; sure of Celestina's affection,
and imputing all Vavasour's attentions to
his admiration of beauty wherever found,
either noticed not his manner, or held them
to be wholly without consequence; while
Celestina, perfectly unconscious of the
power of her own charms, treated him
with that affectionate familiarity which his
own open and lively manners encouraged,
and which his friendship for Willoughby,
and the obligations they both owed to him,
justified.</P>
<P>Only three days were now to intervene
before that fixed for the double wedding,
which was to be celebrated in the parish
church at Alvestone, in the presence only
of two trusty servants, and Vavasour, who
was to act as father to both the brides.</P>
<P>Very different prospects of life from
those which now were before Willoughby
and Celestina, had opened to Mr. and Mrs.
Molyneux, who, on their arrival in Ire∣land,
had found Sir Oswald Molyneux
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
just alive: he lingered unexpectedly a few
weeks after their arrival, and then died,
leaving to his son an immense fortune, of
which Sir Philip hastened to take posses∣sion,
and to display, as soon as decency
permitted, his wealth and his interest;
while Matilda, now Lady Molyneux, lost
no opportunity of availing herself of the
eclat which almost boundless fortune gave
to novelty. Nobody was so much fol∣lowed
and admired; no taste was so uni∣versally
adopted, no parties so splendidly
attended, as her's; and having thus at∣tained
the summit of what she fancied hap∣piness,
she was in no haste to return to
England till she had exhausted the felicity
Ireland offered her, and cheerfully ac∣quiesced
in her husband's proposal of
staying one summer at their magnificent
seat about twenty miles from Dublin. In
the mean time she had heard from her bro∣ther,
whose resentment towards her hus∣band
did not extend to her, of his having
broke with the Castlenorths, and his inten∣tions
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
in regard to Celestina. She disliked
both Lady Castlenorth and her daughter,
and therefore was pleased with their morti∣fication
and disappointment: she had now
no pecuniary claims on her brother, and
heard therefore with indifference his reso∣lution
to marry a woman without fortune;
and as to Celestina, though she was inca∣pable
of any affection for her, yet she
thought she would make a good quiet wife
for her brother, and be well adapted to that
insipid domestic life, his turn for which
she had always pitied and despised. As
Willoughby's just resentment against Sir
Philip had never given her any concern,
she gave herself no trouble to remove it;
and Sir Philip himself, above all attention
for the feelings of others, and too much a
man of the very first fashion to understand
the claims of relationship, or to feel those
of friendship, was as unconcerned as if no
such resentment had ever been deserved;
and while they both enjoyed their newly
acquired consequence in Ireland, Wil∣loughby
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
was suffered to proceed his own
way at Alvestone without remonstrance and
almost without notice.</P>
<P>But neither the neglect of his sister, or
the sullen resentment of his uncle and Lady
Castlenorth, from whom he heard nothing,
now gave Willoughby any concern: his
happiness it was out of their power to
disturb or prevent, since one day only in∣tervened
before he was to be the husband

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>VAVASOUR, born to a splendid for∣tune,
and left by the early death of his
parents to the care of guardians, who,
while they took sufficient care of his pro∣perty,
had very little influence over his
mind and his morals, had never yet formed
a wish which it was not immediately in his
power to gratify: the growing inclination,
therefore, that he found towards Celestina, was
painful and uneasy to him, for he had too
much honour, and too true a regard for
Willoughby, to suffer a thought injurious
to him to dwell on his mind; and had he
been capable of entertaining wishes or
forming schemes against his happiness, he
knew that Celestina's attachment to him
was not to be shaken, and that he should
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
excite her contempt and abhorrence in∣stead
of continuing to enjoy that confidence
and regard with which she now favoured
him.</P>
<P>But the more hopeless his partiality for
her was, the more restless he of course be∣came
in it's encrease: for several days he
endeavoured to conquer or at least to con∣ceal
it by redoubling his gaiety: he
romped, laughed, and rattled, till his
violent spirits became even distressing to
Celestina: all however would not do; and
as he had no notion of enduring any kind
of uneasiness while there was a chance of
relieving himself, he at length resolved to
quit Willoughby, and not to return to him
till after he was actually married; and this
resolution he prepared to execute the fol∣lowing
morning, which was the preceding
one to that which was fixed for the mar∣riage.</P>
<P>"I shall leave you this morning,
George," said he to Willoughby, as they
were at breakfast together.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="245"/>
"Leave me!" cried Willoughby in
much surprise: "for what reason?"</P>
<P>"Because I hate all formal ceremonies,
and have besides business elsewhere."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous! surely you are not in
earnest?"</P>
<P>"Perfectly so, believe me: never more
in earnest in my life. I'll come back to
you in a week or ten days, but I positively
go this very day."</P>
<P>"Thou art a strange fellow, and there
is never any telling where to have thee.
Did you not promise to be father to the
brides? What will Celestina say?"</P>
<P>"Why probably as you do—that I am
a strange fellow."</P>
<P>"You make me uneasy, Harry," said
Willoughby very gravely. "Whimsical
and unsettled as you are, it must be surely
something more than mere whim which
urges you to leave me at such a time."</P>
<P>"Not at all," answered he gaily: "it
is the time in the world you can best spare
me; and upon my soul I have business
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
to do which I have foolishly neglected,
and which I must either go after now or a
fortnight hence, when I intend to be with
you; and so, my dear George, we'll talk
no more about it: my servants are getting
ready, and will be at the door in a minute:
oh they are driving round. Well, George,
God bless you, my dear fellow. Give my
love to the girls, and tell Celestina to save
me a great piece of bride cake."</P>
<P>Willoughby would again have remon∣strated,
but Vavasour, in his wild way,
ran on rallying him about his marriage,
and refusing to listen to him, till the cur∣ricle
was ready; into which he stepped,
after again promising to return in a fort∣night,
and immediately drove away.</P>
<P>Willoughby, though long accustomed
to these starts of caprice from his thought∣less
friend, was equally surprised and dis∣concerted
at a resclution for which he could
not account: he was far from the remotest
idea of the real cause; and, occupied as
his thoughts were by Celestina, he investi∣gated
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
not so deeply the motives of his
friend's actions as at another time he might
have done.</P>
<P>On the preceding day, moved by his
tender reproaches that she had no confi∣dence
in his honour, and affected needless
precaution, Celestina had acceded to his
wishes that she would allow him, as the day
was fixed for Thursday, to fetch her to
Alvestone in the morning of Wednesday,
where Jessy was to meet her, and that she
would then take her last leave of her hum∣ble
abode on Thorpe Common.</P>
<P>As soon, therefore, as Vavasour was
gone, he dispatched Cathcart for Jessy,
and hastened himself to Celestina, who was
ready for him. As they journeyed to∣wards
the house that was henceforth to be
their home, Willoughby, with more than
usual tenderness in his voice and manner,
entered into a more minute detail than he
had ever yet done of the plans he had
formed for their future life: with the san∣guine
hand of youthful hope, he drew a
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
picture of uninterrupted felicity, which
Celestina, involuntarily sighing, thought
too perfect to be realized; and with timid
apprehension, for which she could not ac∣count
and was unwilling to betray, she
internally asked herself wherefore she could
expect to deserve or enjoy blessings so
much superior to the common lot of hu∣manity.</P>
<P>All, however, that might have been to
another an alloy to happiness, was none
to her, so far as it related only to herself.
In marrying her, Willoughby had resigned
all prospect of ever restoring his family to
the splendid fortune and high consequence
possessed by his ancestors, nor could he
even retrieve the estate he had left, or
keep up the place he was so fond of, but
by relinquishing all superfluous expences,
and confining himself to that mode of life,
which was some years since adopted, but
would now be thought below the preten∣sions
of a man possessed only of a thousand
a year: in fact Willoughby found, on a
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
close inspection of his affairs, that by living
within that income, he might in about ten
years clear, without dismembering his
estate. "It is enough for happiness, my
Celestina," he would say; "it is enough
to afford us all the decencies, and all the
comforts of life, and to assist those who
may not have either. Oh how little rea∣son
we shall have to envy those who have
more." Celestina assented with her whole
heart; and if ever an uneasy reflection
arose there for a moment, representing that
for her he resigned the splendour and
luxury in which he might have lived, she
recollected her opinion of the greater part
of those who moved amid a succession of
those luxuries, and asked herself whether
there was one among them who was so
much respected by others, or so well con∣tent
with himself, as Willoughby would
probably be, living as he proposed. She
remembered how often, when she was ac∣customed
to see nearly many of those, who,
by adventitious advantages, dazzle at a
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
distance, she had been compelled to assent
to the truth of that severe expression of
the satirist's, which says, that it may be
seen—
<Q><L>Of how small estimation is exorbitant wealth</L>
<L>In the sight of God,</L>
<L>By his bestowing it on the most unworthy</L>
<L>Of all mortals.</L></Q></P>
<P>The departure of Vavasour, of which
Willoughby had, with some marks of re∣gret
and surprise, on his first meeting Ce∣lestina
informed her, had given her con∣cern,
as it seemed to have been a disap∣pointment
to him; but for herself, she
felt rather relieved by the absence of a
too lively guest. There was at times an
unguarded vivacity about him, of which
she was not always able to check the ex∣cess;
and though she had never any idea
of his partiality to her, nor thought him
capable of a serious attachment to any
woman, there had of late been a warmth
and earnestness in his manner which she was
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
afraid of being called prudish if she at∣tempted
to repress, and yet she could not
but feel that it was improper to allow
it in her present situation, and would
be more so when she became the wife of
Willoughby. On their arrival at Alves∣tone,
the lawyer was ready with the settle∣ments:
they were immediately executed in
the presence of Cathcart and Jessy; and
when that unpleasant ceremony was over,
a walk filled up the time till dinner.
Nothing was ever so gay and happy as
Willoughby: Celestina was now mistress
of his house: his happiness was secured al∣most
beyond the reach of fate: and since
only a few hours were to intervene before
their marriage, he tenderly chid Celestina
for her pensive gravity, and endeavoured
to engage her thoughts by necessary ar∣rangements
that he proposed in the house,
and by enlarging on those topics which she
had listened to with so much complacency
in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="252"/>
After dinner another walk was proposed;
but just as they were rising from table, a
servant entered with a letter for Willough∣by,
which he said had been brought ex∣press
from Exeter.</P>
<P>He broke the seal, which, like the hand
of the direction, was unknown to him;
he ran over the contents hastily, changing
countenance as he read; and then enquir∣ing
if the messenger waited, hastily left
the room.</P>
<P>Celestina, who watched his looks, was
alarmed both by them, and his manner of
leaving the room. A moment's reflection
subdued her apprehensions; but they were
presently renewed and heightened by his
sending to speak with Cathcart; who, after
being with him almost a quarter of an
hour, returned by his directions to inform
her, that he was gone on horseback to
Exeter to meet some people who had sent
to him about business which would admit
of no delay: he begged Cathcart to tell
her that it would be soon dispatched, and
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
that he should certainly return in a few
hours.</P>
<P>Celestina knew, from his own account,
every circumstance of his fortune; she
knew that except the mortgages on his
estate, the interest of which had been
punctually paid, he had no pecuniary
claims to answer but his debt to Vavasour:
she was equally certain that he had no dis∣pute
with any body, and that therefore it
could not be an affair of honour, and she
thought it certain that if Lady Molyneux
or any of his relations had been in the
neighbourhood, he would have made no
mystery of their arrival: his abrupt de∣parture,
therefore, without seeing her, sur∣prised
and troubled her; and neither her
own reason, which urged how unlikely
it was that any disagreeable business should
detain him, or the arguments of Cathcart
and Jessy, could quiet or mitigate the
anxiety which every moment of his absence
encreased.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254"/>
Four, five, six hours, had now been
passed by Celestina, while it was light, in
traversing the avenue and the road that led
towards Exeter; and after it became dark,
in listening at the door to every noise.
It was ten o'clock: a still, star-light night:
a low wind conveyed now the distant mur∣mur
of the water-fall in the park, now
the voices of men from the village, where
every thing soon sunk into repose. Nei∣ther
Cathcart nor Jessy could longer dis∣guise
their fears, though neither knew
what to dread; but while they affected to
believe Celestina's apprehensions in great
measure groundless, their anxious returns
to the door to listen, their restless inquie∣tude,
and various conjectures, convinced
her too evidently that they participated the
fears they pretended to condemn.</P>
<P>At length about eleven o'clock, a horse,
or as they were willing to believe, horses,
were heard to come fast along the road:
the park gate opened and shut with vio∣lence.
It was Willoughby they all fondly
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
hoped: all ran out eagerly, impatient
to meet him: as the horseman ap∣proached,
however, they distinguished
him to be not Willoughby, but the servant
who had attended him.</P>
<P>"Where is your Master, Hugh?" said
Celestina; "is he coming? is he well?"</P>
<P>The man took a letter from his pocket,
and answered in a dejected tone—"No,
Madam, not coming: he sent me with
this letter to Mr. Cathcart."</P>
<P>Celestina followed trembling, while
Cathcart ran into the hall, and by the
light which hung there, read these words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cathcart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>come to me imme∣diately.
I shall not return to-night. I
know not if—But assure Celestina of
my safety. Lose not a moment in
coming to</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your's ever,
G. W.</SIGNED> <DATELINE><HI>Swan, Exeter,</HI>
<DATE>Wednesday night.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="254" REF="256"/>
The painful suspense Celestina had be∣fore
endured, was happiness and ease in
comparison of the vague but terrible ap∣prehensions
that now seized her. What
could detain him against his wishes? what
meant the unfinished sentence—"I know
not if—?" what could he want with
Cathcart? and why not disclose the cause
of his stay, and his business with Cath∣cart,
if it was only an affair of little con∣sequence,
since he could not but know
how much his sudden departure must
alarm her. The note too seemed to have
been written with a trembling hand; the
lines were crooked, and the letters hardly
formed, and the paper blotted: all de∣noted
hurry and confusion, very unlike
Willoughby's manner in matters of mere
business; and the indications of some
impending evil, alarming enough in them∣selves,
were exaggerated by the terrors
which had now taken entire possession of
the mind of Celestina. Unable to restrain
her emotions, she ran, hardly knowing
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
whither she went, to the stable, where the
servant who had brought the note was
getting ready the horse on which Cath∣cart
was to go. She eagerly questioned
the man who was with his master? He
answered that he did not know: that he
saw nobody with him, but he had heard at
the inn that two ladies had come thither
that morning, who had sent the messenger
to Alvestone; that he believed they had
been with his master, but he did not
know, and when his master spoke to him,
and gave him the letter for Mr. Cathcart,
he was alone, and seemed very uneasy,
saying however little more to him than to
desire he would make what haste he could.</P>
<P>This account served only to encrease
the terrible obscurity which tormented
Celestina. A thousand other questions oc∣curred.
Were these ladies yet at the inn?
Did they travel in their own chaise? Had
they servants with them? Hugh could
not answer the first question; but the other
two being such as lay more within the
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
reach of his observation, he answered that
there were certainly neither servants nor
horses at the inn belonging to any stranger
when he came away.</P>
<P>Cathcart was by this time ready; and
seeing the extreme inquietude of Celestina,
he assumed the appearance of tranquillity
he was far from feeling, said that it was
probably some business relative to Mr.
Willoughby's estates, which had been
overlooked and neglected; that at all
events he would be back in a few hours,
when it was almost certain that if Mr.
Willoughby did not return himself, he
should be commissioned fully to acquaint
her of the reasons of his detention, and
convince her that her fears for his safety
were groundless: in the mean time he
besought her to endeavour to quiet her
spirits and to take some repose. Cathcart
then departed; and Celestina, leaning on
the arm of Jessy, returned to the house;
but to follow the advice he had given her,
was not in her power; the little she
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
had gathered from the servant served to
awaken new alarms, not less painful, though
very different from those which had at first
assailed her: then she had a confused idea
that the abrupt departure of Vavasour had
been occasioned by some misunderstanding
between them, which had produced a
challenge; it was unlikely, but it was not
impossible: now she gave up that con∣jecture
for another, and supposed that Wil∣loughby
might have formed some con∣nection
or engagement with some woman,
who, hearing of his intended marriage,
had thus prevented it by urging her prior
claim to his hand: this supposition was,
however, more improbable than the other,
from his known integrity and unblemished
honour, from his long and tender attach∣ment
to her, and from the whole tenor of
his morals and his conduct; but however
unlikely, it was not quite impossible; and
the anxious and alarmed spirit of Celestina
ran over the remotest possibilities, but
found in all only exchange of anguish.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="260"/>
As Cathcart had promised to return in a
few hours, Celestina, certain of not being
able to sleep, would not go to bed; and
Jessy, who shared all her solicitude, sat
up with her. As the time approached
that Cathcart had named for the probable
period of his return, they were again both
at the window, and again eagerly listening
to every noise. The sun arose, but disco∣vered
not the objects of their solicitude;
and Celestina, now unable to rest within
the house, besought Jessy to go down with
her to the end of the long avenue of elms
and into the road, as if the attempt to
meet those they expected rendered the
suspense less distracting.</P>
<P>Weary of conjecture, and fatigued both
in mind and body, they moved slowly and
melancholy along: neither of them spoke,
for neither had any comfort to offer the
other. Of the labourers, who were come
by this time to their work, they enquired
if they had heard of their master, or seen
Mr. Cathcart on the road. But no intelli∣gence
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
could be gained of either. The
peasants, however, alarmed by the ques∣tions
and by the looks of those who asked
them, all eagerly offered to go any where,
to do any thing their master's service might
require, and begged Celestina to employ
them: but though she had several times,
during the long and anxious night, thought
of sending a messenger with a letter to
Willoughby, or even of going herself,
she now remembered that all the intelli∣gence
she could gain from the first expe∣dient,
she would probably receive from
Cathcart before any messenger could get
to Exeter; and for the second, that it
might be displeasing to Willoughby, were
she to appear thus prying into his actions
and mistrustful of his honour.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, remained but to
bear, with what firmness she could, sus∣pense
which every moment rendered more
insupportably cruel. Hardly conscious of
what she was doing, and insensible of per∣sonal
fatigue, she had advanced near a
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
mile beyond the park, and had partly
crossed a sandy heath, over which the high
road lay, when Jessy hastily cried out that
Cathcart was coming: he saw them at the
same moment; and hastening on, leaped
from his horse as soon as he came near
them.</P>
<P>His countenance was little likely to
quiet their fears: he was as pale as death,
and his lips trembled as he spoke to Ce∣lestina,
and assured her, in a voice that
seemed to contradict the words it hardly
articulated, that Mr. Willoughby was
well, perfectly well, and had authorised
him to say every thing to her that might
make her easy.</P>
<P>The hurried manner in which he spoke
this, the impression of uneasiness on his
countenance, and the improbability that
Willoughby should be well and not return
himself, all struck forcibly on the mind of
Celestina, and convinced her that some∣thing
very fatal had happened. "You
deceive me, Cathcart," cried she in the
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
wild and tremulous voice of despair, "I
know you deceive me. Something very
dreadful has befallen him: he is dead, or
dying: I will go to him, however—I will
know the worst."</P>
<P>Cathcart now took her hands, and with
the utmost earnestness began again to re∣peat
his assurances that Willoughby was
not only alive but well. Celestina, inter∣rupting
him, asked—"Why then do I
not see him? why is he detained? and
what business of fatal import could keep
him so long? Cathcart, I will not, I can∣not
be deceived: tell me at once what I
have to suffer, and I will endeavour to bear
it; but this incertitude, these apprehen∣sions,
I cannot endure another hour, nor
another moment.</P>
<P>While this dialogue passed, he had taken
one of her arms within his, and having
made a sign to Jessy to take the other, they
led her gently towards Alvestone park
gate. Cathcart was silent for a moment,
as if considering how he could soften the
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
shock which it was necessary for him to
give her; while Celestina continued im∣patiently
urging him to tell her the worst,
whatever it might be. "Let me repeat
to you, dearest Madam," said he, "let
me repeat to you, that you have nothing
to fear for the life of our dear friend; and
surely whatever other intelligence I have
to impart—"</P>
<P>"Other intelligence!" cried Celestina:
"you have then something to impart
which all my fortitude is required to sus∣tain.
Willoughby—but no! it is im∣possible:
he cannot be unworthy—he
cannot have cruelly deceived me—it is
impossible—"</P>
<P>"It is indeed," replied Cathcart, "in
my opinion impossible for Mr. Willoughby
to be guilty of any unworthy action. You,
Miss de Mornay, have, I am convinced, a
strength of understanding very uncom∣mon—"</P>
<P>"Cathcart," cried Celestina with energy,
"this is no time for flattery: prove your
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
opinion of my understanding by daring to
entrust me with this fearful secret: the
knowledge of it cannot give me so much
pain as your hesitation."</P>
<P>"I would very fain obey you!" re∣plied
he▪ "What then will you say if I tell
you, that, though I am wholly ignorant
of the cause of a resolution so extraordi∣nary,
so unexpected, I am afraid it will
be very long before you see Willoughby
again, and that he is now many miles
distant from us; though upon my soul,
by all my hopes here and hereafter, I swear
that I neither know the motives of his de∣parture
nor whither he is gone."</P>
<P>Celestina, prepared as she was for some
heavy blow, found this hideous uncer∣tainty
more than she could sustain: that
Willoughby should have quitted her, pro∣bably
for ever, without assigning any
cause, at the very moment they were to
be united; that he should not himself have
seen her to have softened the pain this
cruel and unaccountable event must in∣flict;
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
that he should not even have written
to her, but should, in this abrupt and un∣feeling
way, abandon her to all the misery
of endless conjecture, regret, and disap∣pointment;
were circumstances so unex∣pected,
so insupportable, that her reason,
which would have sustained her in almost
any other exigence, seemed for a moment
to yield to this: she became extremely
faint, her knees trembled, a cold dew hung
on her forehead, and all the effort she
could make was, to signify by a motion of
her hand that she could go no farther.</P>
<P>They were then more than half a mile
from the park gate: but the road along
which they were passing was worn, and a
bank on either side offered her a seat. Cath∣cart
and Jessy sat down by her, both silent,
and almost as much affected as she was.
She leaned her head on Jessy, and after a
moment a deep sigh a little relieved her.
She turned her eyes mournfully on Cathcart,
with an expression he perfectly understood,
as seeming to say, tell me all—and I will
try to endure it.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267"/>
"Do not think, I conjure you, my dear
Madam," continued he, "that the ardent
and tender affection of Mr. Willoughby for
you is diminished. Were it possible for me
to do justice to the agonies I saw him in,
when he told me that a strange necessity—a
necessity he could not explain—compelled
him to quit you;—if language could de∣scribe
the wretchedness in which he seemed
to be involved—"</P>
<P>"Do not describe it, dear Cathcart,"
said Celestina, speaking with difficulty. "I
can bear my own misery, terrible as it is,
better than the thoughts of his."</P>
<P>"Mitigate his sufferings then, amiable
Miss de Mornay," interrupted Cathcart,
"by collecting all your fortitude, and re∣membering
how much reliance you ought
to have on his honour and his affection;
and let me be able to say, when I write to
him, that this sad separation has not injured
your health, nor your opinion of him: be∣lieve
me, such is the only intelligence that
can administer any consolation to the torn
heart of my noble friend."</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268"/>
"I will try then, Cathcart, that he shall
have it. You know where to write to him?
He expects to hear from you, and from me
he wishes not to hear?"</P>
<P>"He told me," reassumed Cathcart,
"that as soon as he was able he would
write to you himself: that he was going
immediately to London: whither he should
go afterwards he knew not; but that a hate∣ful
mystery—Then he stopped; seemed
to repent having said so much; charged me
to assure you of his everlasting affection;
started from his seat; walked about the
room wildly; then again repeated his charge
to me that I would not leave you, or suffer
Jessy to leave you, but that you would re∣main
at Alvestone till you heard from him:
again he hesitated, doubted, and wringing
my hand, asked me, with disturbed looks
and in a tremulous voice, if ever wretched∣ness
equalled his. I would have besought
him to tell me from whence it arose; but
as if foreseeing whither my enquiry would
tend, he stopped me: "Cathcart," cried he,
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
"you know I have great confidence in you,
and that I would entrust you with this fatal
mystery, which I go now to clear up; but
I have sworn never to divulge the cause of
my—what can I say?—Oh! Celestina!
best and loveliest of human beings! what
must be those sufferings which Willoughby
dares not communicate to you!—which
your pity and tenderness—" Again he
broke off, and hurried out of the room.
He returned, however, in a few moments,
somewhat more calm; and alarmed as I
had been by his agitation, by the wild ea∣gerness
of his manner, and the incoherence
of his words, I thought it better to soothe
him than to attempt to obtain an explanation
which it cost him so much even to
speak of: I contented myself therefore with
assuring him of my implicit obedience to
all his commands, and of my conviction
that whatever might be your distress and
anxiety, you would acquiesce in all his
wishes, and that your reliance on him, your
affection for him, would not be shaken by
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
this involuntary separation, which, dear
Sir, continued I, will surely be temporary
only; I was going on, but he checked
me—"I know not," said he, with quick∣ness—"I
know not—involuntary, God
knows it is, but <HI>when</HI> it will end!—Oh
Celestina! is this the day which I have with
so much delight anticipated!" He now
struck his open hand on his forehead, again
started away from me, and again relapsed
into all the agonies of sorrow."</P>
<P>Celestina had not hitherto shed a tear.
Stunned by the greatness and singularity of
her misfortune, terrified by the evil, which
its obscurity rendered doubly fearful, her
senses were for some moments suspended;
but Willoughby weeping, and in despair—Willoughby
torn from her by an invisible
and resistless hand—awakened all her ten∣derness,
and tears filled her eyes, as, with a
deep sigh, she cast them towards heaven,
and with clasped hands and in a faint voice
cried—"Wherever he goes—whatsoever
he does—may God protect and bless him;
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
and if the remembrance of poor Celestina
causes him any unhappiness, may he for∣get
her. Indeed, Cathcart," added she,
"indeed his happiness, and not my own,
has been always the first wish of my heart."
She would have gone on, but her voice failed
her. After a moment's silence, however,
she seemed to have found some degree of
fortitude and strength—"Let us return to
the house, my dear Jessy," said she, "while
I am able, and let us there consider what it
will be right to do."</P>
<P>Cathcart, glad to see her more composed
than he had dared to hope, now again led
her forward with the assistance of Jessy.
But their help seemed no longer requi∣site:
she hurried on with as much quick∣ness
as if she expected her suspense to be
terminated on her reaching the house;
where she arrived, out of breath, trembling,
and agitated. She spoke not, but hurried
through the hall into the library, where
they usually sat; and there the first object
that struck her was Mr. Thorold, the clergy∣man
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
man who had been engaged to marry them,
the same who had, at the request of Wil∣loughby,
so effectually exerted his zeal and
friendship in introducing Jessy Woodburn
to her grandfather, and of whose society
Willoughby was very fond.</P>
<P>He laid down his book on the entrance
of Celestina, and prepared to salute her with
cheerful congratulations, for it was not now
more than eight o'clock; he had put his
horse into the stable himself as was his cus∣tom,
and walked into the library, where he
had been some time expecting Willoughby,
and began to wonder, as he was a very
early riser, at his delay.</P>
<P>All ideas of bridal festivity however were
driven from his mind the moment he be∣held
the countenance of Celestina. "My
dear Miss De Mornay," cried he, approach∣ing
her, "are you ill?—has any thing hap∣pened?"
Celestina, struck by the sight of
him, could not answer, but sat down in the
first chair she found, and Cathcart, seeing
how greatly she was affected, took Mr.
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
Thorold by the arm and led him into the
garden.</P>
<P>Celestina in the mean time leaning
against Jessy, who hung weeping over her,
attempted again to recover her resolution
and composure. She sighed deeply. "Jessy,
my love," said she, when she could com∣mand
her voice, "I wish to return to
Thorpe Heath. Methinks I am now an
intruder here: send, therefore, for some
conveyance for me; and think for me, my
dear friend, for I fear I am incapable of
judging for myself."</P>
<P>The timid and soft tempered Jessy was but
little likely to direct or support her. "Let
us, dearest Madam," said she, "speak to
Cathcart again before you take any resolu∣tion:
let us hear Mr. Thorold's opinion."</P>
<P>"Do you then attend them for that
purpose," replied Celestina, "for myself, I
cannot hear them. I should I think be
better were I left alone for a few moments:
I will go, therefore, to my own room—my
own room? alas! I have none in this house!
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
Let me go, however, Jessy, to that which
I used to call mine. I would recall my
dissipated and distracted spirits, I would ac∣quire
some degree of reason and resigna∣tion;
and since wretchedness is now irrevo∣cably
mine, I would teach this rebellious
heart to submit to it."</P>
<P>Jessy answered not; and Celestina rising,
walked slowly through the hall, leaning on
her friend's arm, towards the stair case.
As she passed, she saw Willoughby's hat
and gloves on the table where he generally
placed them; a book he had been reading
to her, as they sauntered in the garden the
preceding day, lay by them: Celestina
started as if a spectre had met her: the pain∣ful
contrast between her present situation
and that of a few hours before struck her
forcibly: she shuddered, and snatching up
the book, hastened away with it, as if she
apprehended somebody would take it from
her.</P>
<P>When they reached the door of the apart∣ment
which she had chosen for her dressing
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
room, she turned to Jessy, and with a me∣lancholy
and forced composure bade her
adieu for an hour. "You will go, my
dear," said she, "to Mr. Thorold and
Mr. Cathcart, and say to the former, with
my compliments, that I will endeavour to
see him if he will be kind enough to stay
till ten o'clock and breakfast here, and tell
him too that I depend much on his friendly
advice, and that it cannot be given to any
being who wants it more or will be more
sensible of it's value."</P>
