<HEAD>TO
JAMES BOSWELL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF <HI>Adam Fitzadam</HI> presumed to inscribe a volume
of the WORLD to MR MOORE, I can see no rea∣son
why I, <HI>a Gentleman of Scotland,</HI> may not take much
the same liberty with MR BOSWELL.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, Sir, because this address comes
in the form of a dedication, that I have been invo∣king
the goddess of Flattery. Indeed I have no in∣tention
to pay your compliments: not that your dis∣cernment
is so nice as to reject them with indignation;
but because it is my sincere opinion that they would
do you harm. To entertain agreeable notions of one's
own character, is a great incentive to act with propri∣ety
and spirit. But I should be sorry to contribute in
any degree, to your acquiring an excess of self-suffi∣ciency.</P>
<P>To talk thus freely, is certainly a proof that I wish
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
you well: and I make no doubt, Sir, but you consi∣der
me as your very good friend; although some peo∣ple,
—and those too not destitute of wisdom,—will
not scruple to insinuate the contrary.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, give me leave to thank you for
your particular kindness to me; and chiefly for the
profound respect with which you have always treated
me.</P>
<P>I own indeed, that when I have boasted of a glimpse
of regard from the finest eyes, and most amiable heart
in the world; or, to display my extensive erudition,
have quoted Greek, Latin, and French sentences, one
after another with astonishing celerity; or have got in∣to
my <HI>Old-hock humour,</HI> and fallen a-raving about prin∣ces
and lords, knights and geniuses, ladies of quality
and harpsichords;—you, with a peculiar comic smile,
have gently reminded me of the <HI>importance of a man to
himself,</HI> and slily left the room, with the witty DEAN
lying open at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/><HI>P. P. clerk of this parish.</HI></P>
<P>The following ODE which courts your acceptance,
is on a subject grave and solemn; and therefore may
be considered by many people, as not so well suited to
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
your volatile disposition. But I, Sir, who enjoy the
pleasure of your intimate acquaintance, know that
many of your hours of retirement are devoted to
thought; and that you can as strongly relish the pro∣ductions
of a serious Muse, as the most brilliant sal∣lies
of sportive Fancy.</P>
<P>As to my merit as a poet, I shall only say, that
while I am certain of YOUR approbation, I shall be
entirely satisfied: and if I can any how improve the
noble feelings of that honest open heart of yours, I shall
reckon myself infinitely happy.</P>
<P>I must now bid you farewell, with an assurance,
that while you continue the man that you are, you
shall ever find me, with the greatest sincerity and af∣fection,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>O'er the strong features of whose face</L>

<L>Seems o'er each lineament to fly;</L>
<L>As when the sun's resplendent rays</L>
