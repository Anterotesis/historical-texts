<HEAD><BIBL>HEBREWS 13<SUP>th</SUP>. CHAP. 17<SUP>th</SUP>. VERSE.</BIBL> <Q>OBEY THEM THAT HAVE THE RULE OVER YOU, AND SUBMIT YOURSELVES; FOR THEY WATCH FOR YOUR SOULS, AS THEY THAT MUST GIVE AN AC∣COUNT.</Q></HEAD>
<P>IN examining a Religion, which pretends to come from God, one of the <HI>first</HI> things which forceth itself upon our attention, is the <HI>Influence</HI> of its <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Precepts</HI> upon human <HI>Felicity.</HI> If the natural ten∣dency of <HI>these,</HI> be to <HI>regulate</HI> the passions, and to <HI>promote</HI> the general Happiness of Mankind; a strong presumption ariseth, that its pretensions to a divine origin, <HI>may</HI> be well founded. But if a Religion obvi∣ously tendeth to <HI>lessen</HI> human happiness, or
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
to <HI>disturb the peace of Society</HI>; we may, with∣out further examination, conclude with <HI>cer∣tainty,</HI> that it cometh <HI>not</HI> from that great, and beneficent Being, who (far from de∣lighting in the misery of his creatures) would have <HI>all</HI> to be pious, and virtuous, <HI>only,</HI> that <HI>all</HI> may be finally, and com∣pletely happy, in those realms where Death hath no dominion.</P>
<P>Viewed in <HI>this</HI> light, Christianity is <HI>emi∣nently</HI> distinguished above every other reli∣gious Institution, which hath hitherto pre∣vailed in the world. It teacheth in per∣fection, the duties of <HI>Man</HI> to <HI>Man</HI>; it affordeth <HI>divine</HI> aids to <HI>human</HI> weakness; and encourageth the practice of what it sheweth to be good, by motives the most engaging, and the most exalted.</P>
<P>Christian Religion exhorteth us to be mindful of <Q REND="inline">whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report</Q>—to forgive our enemies, to love our neighbours as ourselves, to do good, as
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
we have opportunity, to every individual of the human race, and, as much as lieth in us, to live peaceably with all men.</P>
<P>In Society <HI>only</HI> are these duties <HI>practica∣ble</HI>; and, without Government and Subor∣dination, <HI>Society could not subsist.</HI> There∣fore the divine Author, and Finisher of our Faith, <HI>in order to give efficacy to his other commands,</HI> enforced obedience to the civil Magistrate <HI>by an injunction of the Gospel,</HI> requiring his followers to <Q REND="inline">render unto <HI>Caesar</HI> the things that were <HI>Caesar's,</HI></Q> as well as <Q REND="inline">unto <HI>God</HI> the things that were <HI>God's.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>same</HI> course of salutary instruction, was faithfully pursued by the Apostles, and others, the first Preachers of Christianity; who earnestly exhorted their Converts to <Q REND="inline">render to <HI>all</HI> their dues; tribute to whom tribute was due; custom to whom cus∣tom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour; to submit themselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
sake; whether to the King as supreme, or to Magistrates, as unto them, who are sent by him for the Punishment of evil-doers, and for the Praise of them that do well.</Q></P>
<P>To <HI>these</HI> Precepts of <HI>Civil Obedience</HI> no objection of importance hath ever been made. They are (on the contrary) ap∣plauded both by the believer, and by the unbeliever,—by him who reverenceth the Gospel, as the power of God unto Salva∣tion,—and by him who considereth it as a cunningly devised fable, calculated <HI>merely</HI> to erect a Dominion over the consciences of men.</P>
<P>But the Precept of my <HI>Text,</HI> hath fre∣quently been viewed in a light <HI>less favour∣able.</HI> It, <HI>certainly supposeth</HI> an Authority different from that of the <HI>civil</HI> Magistrate, <HI>whose</HI> Duty is to watch, <HI>not</HI> for the <HI>Souls, but</HI> for the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> of his sub∣jects; and to <HI>that</HI> Authority St. Paul, here, enjoineth an <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the <Q REND="inline">chil∣dren
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
of this world</Q> are <HI>little willing to pay.</HI></P>
<P>It would be idle to reason in support of <HI>spiritual Authority</HI> with such as doubt, or deny the divine origin of the Gospel; for THESE MEN must be convinced that they HAVE SOULS, before they can be persuaded to enquire WHO are appointed to <HI>watch</HI> for them; to WHOM, on <HI>that</HI> account, their obedience is due; or WHAT is the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the obedience required.</P>
<P>THEY are not, however, ALL infidels, who <HI>deny</HI> the reality of spiritual Powers;—for many sincere believers in Christianity contend that, under the Gospel-dispensa∣tion, there is nothing which bears the smallest resemblance to an exclusive Priest∣hood; that the Authority which is sup∣posed in my Text, either ceased with the Apostles; or that (if it still continueth in the Church) it can be conferred on one class of Christians, <HI>only,</HI> by the <HI>Election</HI> of others; and that, <HI>therefore,</HI> we are bound
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
to obey it, <HI>no farther,</HI> than is necessary to preserve <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> in the conduct of public worship.</P>
<P>That, our blessed Lord gave to none of his immediate followers Authority or Ju∣risdiction, of <HI>such a nature</HI> as, to interfere with the Rights of the Rulers of the Earth, is, indeed, an undoubted Truth,—for <HI>all such Authority</HI> was disclaimed by <HI>Himself</HI>; <Q REND="inline">My kingdom,</Q> said He to Pilate, <Q REND="inline">is not of this world</Q>—And, upon being asked by a certain person to decide a <HI>ques∣tion of Property</HI> between him and his bro∣ther, his Reply was, <Q REND="inline">Man—<HI>who</HI> made <HI>me</HI> a Judge, or a Divider over you?</Q> But when it is considered that, Christ came into the world to <Q REND="inline">turn men from Dark∣ness unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God;</Q> that, <Q REND="inline">He gave him∣self for us, that He might redeem us from <HI>all</HI> Iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people <HI>zealous</HI> of good works</Q>—and that of <HI>these works very many</HI> are such
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
as unregenerate humanity cannot perform; and that the <HI>Doctrines</HI> which he revealed, are such as <HI>human Reason</HI> could <HI>never</HI> have discovered; it will be seen how <HI>necessary</HI> it was that, when he ascended into Heaven, he should substitute some <HI>Authority,</HI> on Earth, to <HI>illustrate the Revelation</HI> which he had <HI>given,</HI> and to <HI>enforce obedience</HI> to the <HI>Laws</HI> which he had <HI>enacted.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing more strictly required of Christians, than that they should live together in <HI>Unity</HI>; professing the <HI>same</HI> Faith, joining in the <HI>same</HI> Worship, and practising the <HI>same</HI> Virtues on the <HI>same</HI> Principles. Now, as Men have <HI>different</HI> Passions, Prejudices, and Pursuits, <HI>such Unity</HI> would be impossible, were they <HI>not</HI> linked together in <HI>one</HI> Society; under the Government of Persons authorised to <HI>watch over the Faith,</HI> to <HI>prescribe the Forms of pub∣lic Worship,</HI> and to <HI>inculcate the necessity,</HI> and <HI>explain the Nature</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>several Virtues.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
In the Scriptures of the New Testament, the Society of Christians is (on account of its unity and organization) compared to the human body; <Q REND="inline">for as we have <HI>many</HI> members in <HI>one</HI> body, and all members have not the <HI>same office</HI>; so <HI>we,</HI> being many, are <HI>one Body</HI> in Christ, and every one <HI>members one of another.</HI></Q> (<BIBL>Rom. XII. 4. 5</BIBL>)▪ This Society of Believers, in our common Deliverer, is called the CHURCH, 'the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI>',—and 'the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI>'; and ITS affairs (like the affairs of every other Kingdom) are administered by <HI>proper</HI> officers in subordination to <HI>the one Lord</HI>; who <Q REND="inline">when he ascended on high, and led captivity captive, gave <HI>some</HI> Apostles, and <HI>some</HI> Prophets, and <HI>some</HI> Evangelists, and <HI>some</HI> Pastors, and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; that, henceforth we should be <HI>no more</HI> children tossed to and fro, and carried
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
about with <HI>every</HI> wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning crafti∣ness whereby they lie in wait to de∣ceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into <HI>Him</HI> in all things, which is the Head, even Christ, from <HI>whom</HI> the whole Body fitly joined toge∣ther, and compacted by <HI>that</HI> which every joint supplieth, according to the effec∣tual working in the measure of <HI>every</HI> part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</Q> (<BIBL>Ephes. IV. 11. 12. 14. 15. 16.</BIBL>)</P>
<P>Now,—of <HI>this</HI> Society (as of a philosophi∣cal Sect) it is <HI>not</HI> left to <HI>every</HI> man's choice, as a thing indifferent, whether or <HI>not</HI> he will become a Member. ALL who em∣brace the Faith of the Redeemer of the world, are required to be <HI>baptized,</HI> under the pain of forfeiting the <HI>benefits of Redemp∣tion.</HI> (St. Mark, XVI. 16.—St. John, III. 5.) But <HI>one great purpose</HI> proposed by the institution of Baptism, was the Initia∣tion
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
of Persons into the Church of Christ; <Q REND="inline">For <HI>by one Spirit</HI></Q> (saith St. Paul, <BIBL>1 Cor. XII. 13. 27. 28. 29.</BIBL>) <Q REND="inline">are we all bap∣tized <HI>into one Body,</HI> whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.</Q></P>
<P>Of <HI>Baptism,</HI> (whatever be the Import∣ance) it is evident that to receive it is, <HI>not</HI> (like moral Justice, or the Veneration of the Supreme Being) a Duty resulting from the <HI>Nature of the Relations of Man</HI>; and that <HI>all</HI> its efficacy (which in Scripture is said to be <HI>nothing less than the Remission of Sins,</HI> Acts II. 38. and XXII. 16.) is derived from <HI>po∣sitive Institution,</HI> and can accompany the external Rite, <HI>only,</HI> when <HI>that</HI> Rite is ad∣ministered in the <HI>manner prescribed,</HI> and by the <HI>persons authorised</HI> to administer it.</P>
<P>That <HI>all Christians,</HI> in common, are <HI>not</HI> vested with this authority, is plain from the Commission, which (after his Resur∣rection) the blessed Jesus gave to his Apos∣tles. We are assured that the number of
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
his followers was then <HI>five hundred at least</HI>; but it was ONLY to the ELEVEN DISCI∣PLES that <Q REND="inline">He came and spake saying, All power is given unto me in Heaven, and Earth; Go YE therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</Q> (<BIBL>St. Matthew, XXVIII. 16. 17. 18. 19.</BIBL>) Now there is no reason to suppose that there were not <HI>many</HI> of the five hundred well qualified to instruct either a Jew, or a Gentile, in the doctrines of the the Gospel; and it is certain, that <HI>any one</HI> of them could have washed his Converts with water in the Name of the Holy Trinity, as well as St. Peter, or St. John: but then, such an <HI>unauthorized washing</HI> would not have been <HI>Christian Baptism,</HI> or of equal Validity with <HI>it,</HI> any more than the <HI>Opinion</HI> of a <HI>Lawyer at the Bar,</HI> is the <HI>Judgement of a Court of Justice,</HI> or of equal obligation: It is the <HI>Commission of the Sovereign</HI> which gives force to the <HI>Judgement of the Court</HI>; as it is
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
the COMMISSION OF CHRIST which gives VALIDITY TO BAPTISM.</P>
<P>The <HI>same</HI> Things hold true of the Lord's Supper; which, if it be <HI>not</HI> administered by Persons having <HI>Authority</HI> for such cele∣bration, cannot be deemed a Sacrament of Christ's Institution. These two Rites are the external Badges of our Profession—by the <HI>one</HI> we are incorporated into that So∣ciety, of which God our Saviour is the Head and Sovereign—of the <HI>other,</HI> with all its Advantages, we have a Right to par∣take, whilst we continue Members of <HI>that</HI> Society; but if, by an open and scanda∣lous disregard to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the Gos∣pel, we should prove ourselves Despisers of its <HI>Privileges</HI>: the same Persons who are authorized to <HI>admit us into</HI> Christ's Church, are likewise vested with Autho∣rity to <HI>cast us out</HI> of it; for to <HI>them</HI> were gi∣ven <Q REND="inline">The Keys of the Kingdom of Hea∣ven,</Q> with an assurance that <Q REND="inline">whatso∣ever they should <HI>bind</HI> on Earth, should
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
be <HI>bound</HI> in Heaven; and whatsoever they should <HI>loose</HI> on Earth, should be <HI>loosed</HI> in Heaven.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>St. Matthew, XVI. 19. and XVIII. 18.</BIBL> <Q REND="inline"> And I will give you the Keys of the Gate of this Court, or Kingdom, the Church, of which every one of you is to be the Steward, (as the Keys of the Court were given to Eliakim, Isa. XXII. 22. in token of his being a Steward of the House, to admit, and exclude whom he pleased) that is, both <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Ensign of Power,</HI> Apoc. III. 7. to exercise censures. and by <HI>them</HI> to exclude men in case of their impenitence, either by laying some restraint on them in the Church, or to turn them out of the gates of <HI>this</HI> city, and upon repentance, to receive them into the Church again; and what you do <HI>here,</HI> as you ought to do, shall be valid in <HI>Heaven.</HI></Q> <BIBL>Hammond's Paraphrase.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> </P>
<P>Now, as <HI>Baptism</HI> is to be <HI>administered,</HI> so long as there shall be Persons to be enlisted under the Banner of Christ; and, as the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> is to be <HI>celebrated</HI> so long as it shall be the Duty of Soldiers to adhere to to the Standard of their Leader, and their Head; and as it is to be feared that there never will come a time, when <HI>all</HI> the ser∣vants of Christ shall walk <Q REND="inline">worthy of the
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
vocation wherewith they are called;</Q>—It follows <HI>undeniably</HI> that this <HI>Power of the Keys,</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See this matter treated in a very masterly manner by Archbishop Potter, in his discourse of Church Govern∣ment;—a book which I beg leave to recommend <HI>earnestly</HI> to every Member of the Church of England; and especially to the younger part of my brethren the Clergy.</NOTE> which was <HI>originally</HI> vested in the Apostles, must continue in the Church <HI>through all Ages,</HI> even unto the <HI>End of the World.</HI> But we have seen that it was <HI>not,</HI> at first, entrusted to <HI>all</HI> the Disciples <HI>in com∣mon,</HI> as <HI>one</HI> of the Privileges inseparable from their Profession; and, as <HI>no Body</HI> of men can possibly <HI>transfer</HI> an Authority, of which they themselves were never <HI>possessed</HI>; it is certain, that even <HI>now</HI> it cannot, by the Election of <HI>one</HI> Class of Christians, be <HI>delegated</HI> to <HI>another,</HI> but must, by some mode of Succession, be <HI>derived</HI> from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> who were sent by <HI>Christ,</HI> as <HI>He</HI> was sent by his <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P>To argue from the Origin of <HI>civil</HI> to that
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
of <HI>ecclesiastical</HI> Government, although, per∣haps, not <HI>very uncommon,</HI> is yet <HI>extremely fallacious.</HI></P>
<P>Of the various Nations of the world (as particular <HI>Forms</HI> of Government may be devised <HI>on Earth,</HI> though <HI>Government itself</HI> is from <HI>above</HI>) many of the Sovereigns may, indeed, derive their Authority from the Suffrages of their Subjects; because, in a State of Nature, every man has an inherent and undoubted Right to defend his Life, Liberty, and Property; and what he pos∣sesses in his <HI>own person,</HI> he may, for the Good of Society, transfer to <HI>another</HI>: but <HI>no man is</HI> by nature, or <HI>can make himself,</HI> a Member of the Christian Church; and, therefore, Authority, to govern that So∣ciety, <HI>can</HI> be derived <HI>only</HI> from <HI>Him</HI> by <HI>whom it was founded,</HI> and who <Q REND="inline">died that he might gather together <HI>in one</HI> all the Children of God.</Q></P>
<P>Against such reasoning <HI>as this,</HI> it hath been sometimes urged that it appeareth in∣consistent
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
with the Wisdom and Goodness of God, to make Institutions which, (like Baptism and the Lord's Supper) are <HI>gene∣rally</HI> necessary to the Salvation of <HI>all</HI> Chris∣tians, depend upon the <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Com∣mission</HI> of a <HI>particular Order</HI>; Because, by such an Economy, an <HI>intolerable Domina∣tion</HI> would be established over the Souls of Men; and the purpose, for which the Son of God died, might, in <HI>some degree,</HI> be de∣feated, by the Caprice of an <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>arbitrary Priesthood</HI>:—But, <HI>this objection,</HI> is either of <HI>no</HI> weight, or it militates with <HI>equal force</HI> against <HI>all</HI> Religion, natural as well as revealed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Although, in conformity with the usual mode of ex∣pression, I have distinguished between <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>revealed</HI> Religion, I do not imagine that there ever <HI>was,</HI> or <HI>could have been,</HI> a consistent scheme of Religion excogitated by the <HI>mere strength of human Genius:</HI> the Authors who detail to us Systems of, what is called, the <HI>Religion of Nature,</HI> borrow sometimes (without adverting to it) their Principles from the Holy Scriptures, and then, not unfrequently, turn against Revelation <HI>those arms</HI> with which <HI>it</HI> hath furnished them.—In vigour of Intellect <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> were, surely, <HI>not inferior</HI> to <HI>Mr. Woolaston</HI>; and yet, it is certain, that in their writings are not to be found <HI>so many Truths,</HI> and <HI>so few mistakes,</HI> relating to the Supreme Being, as He has ex∣hibited in <HI>one small Volume</HI>—Whence, then, had the Author of <HI>the Religion of Nature delineated</HI> this superiority over the greatest Men of Antiquity?—Undoubtedly, from his know∣ledge of those Truths, which are recorded in the Old and New Testaments, and of which the Philosophers of Athens and Rome, knew <HI>nothing,</HI> except what had come down to them from the primeval times, through the precarious con∣veyance of oral tradition.—When a proposition is <HI>once</HI> known to be true, it requires no extraordinary strength of mind to understand the <HI>Grounds</HI> of its Truth. He must be a very weak man, who could not be made to understand the de∣monstration of the Pythagorean Theorem; and yet I hope there is not one of my Readers, who does not think himself indebted to the Sage, who made the discovery.—The Case is similar with respect to Religion. Its doctrines and pre∣cepts are <HI>now known,</HI> and of these doctrines <HI>many</HI> are of such a nature, that a well-cultivated mind comprehends without difficulty <HI>the reasons upon which they rest</HI>; concern∣ing <HI>others</HI> we may well be contented with the plain though narrow view of them, which is laid before us in the sacred writings,—for prying into those Mysteries, like gazing on the Sun, <HI>begins in Pain, and ends in Blindness.</HI>—The fit∣ness of the Precepts of Revelation for such a Creature is easily discerned; but it does not, therefore, follow that the System could have been excogitated by human Reason, any more than that every man of ordinary capacity is equal to Pythagoras.</NOTE>; and even against the Wisdom of Providence in the Government of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
In every thing relating both to their <HI>tem∣poral,</HI> and their <HI>spiritual</HI> Interests, Mankind
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
are <HI>all</HI> subjected to <HI>mutual Dependence.</HI> The <HI>Rich</HI> depend upon the <HI>Poor,</HI> and the <HI>Poor</HI> upon the <HI>Rich.</HI> An Infant, neglected from the Birth, would <Q REND="inline"><HI>barely cry and cease to live</HI>;</Q> nor is it very easily to be conceived how, in the more rigid Climates, a full∣grown man could, <HI>without assistance,</HI> pro∣vide even the Necessaries of mere animal Life. Of RELIGION, it is certain that in such a situation, <HI>nothing</HI> could be known: For there is not the <HI>smallest</HI> Reason to ima∣gine that <HI>any</HI> Individual of the human race—an Aristotle,—a Bacon,—or a Newton,—had he been left alone, from his Infancy, <HI>without</HI> culture, and <HI>without</HI> education, could ever, by the <HI>native Vigour of his own mind,</HI> have discovered the Existence of a God; or that such speculations, as might be supposed to lead to that Discovery, would have employed <HI>any</HI> Portion of his Time, or his Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Even, <HI>in Society,</HI> it would be impossible for <HI>any Man,</HI> without the Assistance of others, to understand, in the <HI>present Age,</HI> the <HI>very first Principles of Christianity</HI>; for the Scriptures, in which <HI>alone,</HI> those Prin∣ciples can be found, are written in Lan∣guages which are <HI>now,</HI> no where <HI>vernacu∣lar.</HI> In the Fidelity of Translators, there∣fore, every illiterate Disciple of Jesus, <HI>must confide</HI> for the <HI>Truth</HI> of those Doctrines, which constitute the <HI>Foundation of all his Hopes</HI>; and, as <HI>no</HI> man ever pretended that the <HI>Christian Sacraments</HI> are more <HI>necessary</HI> to Salvation than the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> where is the <HI>impropriety,</HI> or <HI>inconsistency</HI> of those Persons receiving the Sacraments of Bap∣tism, and the Lord's Supper, by the mi∣nistration of <HI>others,</HI> who, by such <HI>ministra∣tion</HI> must, of <HI>necessity,</HI> receive the Truths of the Gospel?</P>
<P>Having thus shewn that there <HI>is</HI> in the Church, a STANDING ORDER OF MEN, to whom, in the Affairs of Religion, the
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
great Body of Christians <HI>ought,</HI> or are <HI>bound to pay obedience</HI>; it remains to be en∣quired WHO they are that, among the <HI>va∣rious Pretenders,</HI> have the <HI>best</HI> Claim to this SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY.</P>
<P><HI>One Party</HI> maintains that, originally, the Officers of the Church were ALL, Presby∣ters of ONE ORDER, and vested with equal Powers; Whilst <HI>others</HI> (and the Church of England especially) hold that Christ and his Apostles appointed DIVERS ORDERS of Ministers in the Church; that of THESE ORDERS the HIGHST ALONE, was vested with Authority to ORDAIN OTHERS; and that, <HI>therefore,</HI> Obedience (as to those <Q REND="inline">who watch for our Souls</Q>) can be due ONLY to such as are EPISCOPALLY OR∣DAINED.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>famous Question,</HI> concerning the apostolic Model of Church-Govern∣ment, which has (almost from the begin∣ning of the Reformation) been agitated between <HI>us,</HI> and the <HI>Dissenters of the Presby∣terian Sect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
The Plea urged in Behalf of the Presby∣terians is, that the Titles, <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Pres∣byter,</HI> being in the New Testament indif∣ferently given to the <HI>same</HI> Persons, cannot be the Titles of <HI>distinct</HI> ecclesiastical Offi∣cers; which appears, it is said, <HI>still more evident</HI> from the Ordination of Timothy, who (although the <HI>first</HI> Bishop of Ephesus) was vested with his episcopal Character by the Imposition of the <HI>Hands of the Presby∣tery.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same Man</HI> is, in the New Testament, sometimes called a <HI>Bishop,</HI> and sometimes a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> cannot perhaps be denied; but although every apostolic <HI>Bishop</HI> was, therefore, undoubtedly a <HI>Pres∣byter</HI>;—it does <HI>not</HI> follow that every <HI>Pres∣byter</HI> was likewise a <HI>Bishop.</HI> In the Old Testament Aaron, and his Sons are (with∣out any Discrimination of Order) frequently styled <HI>Priests</HI>;—as in the New Testament both St. Peter, and St. John call themselves <HI>Presbyters.</HI> (1 Pet. V. 1.—2 John, 1.—
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
3 John 1.) And St. Paul upon <HI>one</HI> occasion, denominates himself a Deacon. (Coloss. 1. 24. 25. See the original) Yet, I believe, <HI>no</HI> man ever supposed that those Apostles were <HI>such ecclesiastical Officers,</HI> as <HI>modern presbyterian Ministers, or Deacons</HI>: And it is universally known that in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Priesthood, there were <HI>different</HI> Orders; and that <HI>Aaron</HI> was of an Order <HI>superior</HI> to his <HI>Sons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> being the Case; the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> by the laying on of <HI>whose Hands</HI> Timothy was made a Bishop, <HI>may</HI> have been of the same Order with St, Peter, and St. John; and, <HI>if so, his</HI> Consecration was undoubtedly <HI>Episcopal.</HI> We are (at <HI>all Events</HI>) <HI>certain</HI> that it was not (in the modern sense of the word) <HI>Presbyterian</HI>; for the Gift, which in the first Epistle is said to have been given to him by Prophecy, <Q REND="inline">with the laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Presby∣tery</HI>;</Q> is in the second said to have been in him <Q REND="inline">by the putting on of the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/> Hands of <HI>St. Paul.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Persons, who are inclined to rest in the <HI>scund of words,</HI> and <HI>names</HI>; and to suppose that the Members of the Presbytery, whose Hands were lain upon Timothy, were of the <HI>same</HI> Rank and Order with <HI>modern</HI> Presbyters, would per∣haps do well to <HI>consider the Import</HI> of the Prep sitions <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>It appears, therefore, that (from the
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
<HI>promiscuous use</HI> of the Titles <HI>Bishop,</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI>) <HI>nothing</HI> can with certainty be concluded on <HI>either</HI> Side of this celebrated Question. But if, instead of resting in <HI>single words,</HI> (which are always more or less ambiguous) we attend to some impor∣tant <HI>Facts</HI> recorded in the New Testa∣ment; I think, we shall discover in <HI>them</HI> sufficient Evidence, that the Government of the <HI>primitive</HI> Church was <HI>prelatical,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> administered by a <HI>College of Elders,</HI> an our Adversaries are wont to affirm.</P>
<P>During our Saviour's Stay upon Earth, we know that He had under Him <HI>two dis∣tinct Orders</HI> of Ministers; the <HI>Twelve</HI> and the <HI>Seventy:</HI> and after his Ascension (im∣mediately before which he had enlarged the Powers of the Eleven) we read of <HI>Apostles. Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> That the <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> were superior to the <HI>Deacons,</HI> and the <HI>Apostles</HI> superior to <HI>both</HI> is universally ac∣knowledged; but it hath been said that in Scripture we find <HI>no</HI> Intimation that the
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
<HI>Apostolic</HI> Order was designed for continu∣ance.—A Quaker says the same thing of Water-Baptism; and, I know not by what <HI>Text of Scripture,</HI> or by what <HI>Mode of Ar∣gument, Those</HI> who, upon <HI>this</HI> Plea, reject the Apostolic Order of Christian Ministers, could overthrow the <HI>Principles</HI> upon which the Disciples of George Fox reject the Use of <HI>that</HI> Rite, instituted for the Initia∣tion of Mankind into the Christian Church.</P>
<P><HI>They</HI> were the <HI>Eleven, alone,</HI> to whom our Saviour said <Q REND="inline">Go <HI>ye,</HI> therefore, and teach <HI>all</HI> Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost—teaching them to observe <HI>all</HI> things whatsoever I have commanded you.</Q> (Matthew XXVIII. 16. 19. 20.) And, therefore, although we frequently find Presbyters and Deacons ad∣ministering the Sacrament of Baptism; we must conclude that (as a Judge administers Justice by Authority derived from his So∣vereign, so) those <HI>inferior</HI> Officers of the
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Church administered Baptism by <HI>Authority</HI> derived from the <HI>Apostles</HI>: Indeed, had they pretended to act by <HI>any other Authority,</HI> it is not <HI>easy</HI> to conceive how <HI>their Baptism</HI> could have been the <HI>Baptism of Christ</HI>; for it was <HI>not</HI> with the external washing, by <HI>whomsoever</HI> performed, but with the <HI>Eleven</HI> and <HI>their Successors</HI> that Christ promised to <HI>be</HI> <Q REND="inline">always, even unto the End of the World.</Q></P>
<P>That the Eleven did <HI>not</HI> consider this Promise, or the Commission with which it was given, as terminating with <HI>their Lives,</HI> is evident from their admitting <HI>others</HI> into their <HI>own Order</HI>; for which they had competent Authority, as having been <HI>sent</HI> by <HI>Christ,</HI> as he was <HI>sent</HI> by his <HI>Father</HI> (St. John. XX. 21.)</P>
<P>When St. Paul (to magnify his office, and to procure to it from the Galatians <HI>that</HI> Reverence which, it appears, they had withdrawn from <HI>him,</HI> and paid to <HI>others,</HI> whose Doctrine was probably more palat∣able)

This Practice they certainly derived from the Jews, who created Governors of criminal causes, or ruling Elders, and Masters, Doctors, and Rabins, to be Teachers of the Law, <HI>i. e.</HI> to labour in the word and doctrine, by <HI>Imposi∣tion of Hands</HI>; as Moses did to Joshua, Numb. XXVII. 23. Deut. XXXIV. 9. and as Maimonides saith he did, when he assumed the Seventy to assist him. St. Cyprian in the third Century speaks of Imposition of Hands, as <HI>that</HI> which was to be observed and held from divine Tradition, and apostolical observation in the collation to the episcopal Office: and the apostolical constitutions give us this as an ordinance of St. John the Apostle, who, doubtless, (when upon his return from Patmos to Ephesus, he regulated the Churches, and constituted Bishops) did it according to the Rites of the Jews, and Practice of the other Apostles.—Whence we conclude that the laying on of Hands is no <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>dental</HI> but a <HI>necessary Rite</HI> of the due Ordination of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons. (WHITBY on 1 Timothy IV. 14) Thus St. Paul received an <HI>outward commission</HI> to preach the Gospel, and was ordained <HI>by the imposition of hands.</HI> (Acts XIII. 1. 2 3. 4.) And, although he was be∣fore chosen by Christ to his office, and thence entitles him∣self at large <Q REND="inline">the Apostle of Jesus Christ</Q>; yet being sepa∣rated by the command of the Holy Ghost, but at the same time by <HI>laying on of hands,</HI> he then styles himself (in consi∣deration of the work to which he was <HI>especially separated</HI> and <HI>ordained</HI>) <Q REND="inline">the Apostle of the Gentiles.</Q></NOTE>, or by some other sig∣nisicant ceremony, the Eleven had con∣ferred that Authority, which was given to them by their divine Master: Such were Matthias and Barnabas; such likewise, were Timothy, Titus, and many others whose names are mentioned in the New Testament.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
That Matthias and Barnabas were of the <HI>Apostolic Order</HI> has, I believe, never been denied; and that Timothy, and Titus were <HI>superior</HI> to <HI>modern Presbyters</HI> is equally evi∣dent:
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
Timothy was by St. Paul, empow∣ered to preside over the Presbyters of Ephe∣sus; to receive accusations against them; to exhort, to charge, and even to rebuke them; and Titus was by the same Apostle, left in Crete, for the express purpose of setting things in order, and <HI>ordaining</HI> Pres∣byters in every city. Now to <HI>exhort,</HI> to <HI>charge,</HI> and (with Authority) to <HI>rebuke</HI> one's <HI>equal,</HI> is surely <HI>incongruous</HI>; and alto∣gether <HI>inconsistent</HI> with that <HI>Parity</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> for which our Adversaries <HI>so</HI> strenuosly plead.</P>
<P>Even the Commission given to <HI>Titus</HI> seems, by much, <HI>too extensive</HI> for a <HI>presby∣terian Minister</HI>; who after having ordained in <HI>one</HI> city, could not have proceeded to or∣dain in <HI>another,</HI> without the Consent and Assistance of his Brother and Fellow-La∣bourer. In a word, no man, I think, who, without prejudice, reads the <HI>Epistles of St Paul,</HI> and <HI>the Apocalypse of St. John,</HI> can <HI>seriously</HI> believe that Timothy, Titus,

<P>But it may be said, that although the Government of the Church, as settled by the Apostles, should be granted to have been <HI>prelatical,</HI> there is nothing in the New Testament, or in the Nature of the Thing to make us imagine a <HI>different</HI> Con∣stitution <HI>absolutely unlawful.</HI> The Form of civil Government established by <HI>God him∣self</HI> over the Children of Israel, was cer∣tainly, <HI>Monarchical</HI>; and the <HI>same</HI> Consti∣tution obtained at first in <HI>every Nation un∣der Heaven,</HI> of which History giveth any

<P>This Reasoning would be <HI>conclusive</HI>; were not the <HI>Polity</HI> of the Church, the <HI>Authority</HI> of her Ministers, and the <HI>Validity</HI> of the Christian Sacraments <HI>inseparably united.</HI></P>
<P>To Persons, who consider the Religion of our adorable Redeemer, as a <HI>mere</HI> re∣publication of, what is called, <HI>the Religion of Nature</HI>; nothing to be sure can appear <HI>more trifling,</HI> or <HI>more justly ridiculous</HI> than Disputes about the <HI>external Government of the Church.</HI> In the opinion of <HI>such Men,</HI> it must be a matter of <HI>perfect Indifference,</HI> whether she be governed by <HI>Bishops,</HI> by

<HI>Presbyters,</HI> or by the <HI>People at large</HI>; for the <HI>only thing</HI> in which <HI>they</HI> can be inte∣rested, is the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Doctrines taught, which rests <HI>not</HI> upon the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Teacher,</HI> but upon <HI>Deductions</HI> of <HI>Reason,</HI> and the <HI>Declarations</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> if indeed to the Scripture <HI>these Persons</HI> allow <HI>any De∣ference to be due.</HI></P>
<P>Those, however, who consider Chris∣tianity as an <HI>instituted Religion</HI>; who believe that <Q REND="inline">Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,</Q> and to <HI>restore</HI> to them that <HI>forfeited</HI> Inheritance, which by <HI>no human means</HI> they could ever have <HI>regained</HI>; Per∣sons, who consider <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> as of <HI>vast Importance</HI> in the great Scheme of universal Redemption; and who are convinced that those ordinances derive their Importance, <HI>wholly</HI> from <HI>positive In∣stitution,</HI> cannot think it a matter of Indif∣ference, whether the Hand from which they receive them, be the Hand of an Ad∣ministrator, who <HI>derives his Authority from</HI>

<HI>Christ</HI>; or of one, who <HI>derives it from the People.</HI>—VALIDITY or INVALIDITY is then the grand Question; and until the Argument is wound up to this Pitch, little good can be done.</P>
<P>Now, it being certain that, from the Days of the Apostles to those of Calvin, <HI>no man</HI> was authorized to minister in holy things, but by Ordination from the Hands of a <HI>Bishop</HI>;<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Should it be granted, in Defiance of all Antiquity and, as I think, in contradiction to the clearest Evidence of Scripture; that in the Church, there were at first <HI>but two</HI> permanent Orders of Ministers, of which the highest were called Bishops or Presbyters <HI>indifferently,</HI> and the other Deacons; I see no advantage which, from such a concession, could redound to the Presbyterian cause. According to this Supposition, the Apostolical Presbyters must have been invested, as it is contended they were, with all the powers of modern Bishops—with the power of preaching, of admi∣nistering the Sacraments, and of <HI>sending</HI> Labourers into Christ's Vineyard: But it is notorious that, <HI>at the Reforma∣tion,</HI> and in <HI>every prior period of the Church</HI> of which History makes mention, there were <HI>three Orders of Ministers,</HI> of which the <HI>Second</HI> was authorized to preach the Gospel, and to administer the Sacraments, but <HI>not</HI> to <HI>send</HI> La∣bourers into Christ's Vineyard, which was the Prerogative of the <HI>highest</HI> alone: That <HI>second</HI> Order, being, therefore, upon this supposition, <HI>unknown</HI> in the Apostolic Age, must have been introduced into the Church, by <HI>no competent Au∣thority.</HI> But it is from <HI>it</HI> that the Presbyterians derive their <HI>Mission,</HI> which, therefore, upon their <HI>own</HI> Principles, MUST BE TOTALLY VOID. Hence it follows that should the Episcopal Church be granted to have deviated from the Apostolic Model, which (if any Credit be due to the ob∣vious <HI>Sense</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and the unanimous <HI>Verdict</HI> of <HI>An∣tiquity</HI>) <HI>she has not done</HI>; still <HI>she</HI> is corrupted <HI>only</HI> in <HI>one</HI> part, whereas the <HI>Presbyterian Sect</HI> rests <HI>wholly upon a hu∣man foundation.</HI>—See this Argument stated more fully, and maintained against much ingenious Sophistry, in DR.

<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> derive their Or∣ders from <HI>no such Source</HI>; it is surely <HI>not without Reason,</HI> that we doubt whether the ordinances dispensed in <HI>their</HI> Assemblies, be the ordinances of the <HI>Church of Christ</HI>; or that we consider the Frequenters of <HI>such</HI> Assemblies (especially here in England) as guilty of Disobedience to those, to whom by every Law <HI>divine</HI> as well as <HI>human,</HI> they are in Conscience bound to <Q REND="inline">submit them∣selves, as to Rulers who have Authority to watch for their Souls.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Unimportant</HI> as this Controversy has of∣ten been represented, it appears to me of

<HI>much greater Moment,</HI> than many of those, which make a mighty noise among the cold and philosophical Christians of the present Day.</P>
<P>In all Churches, with which I am ac∣quainted, are to be found speculative Opini∣ons; (UNDER WHICH DENOMINATION I do not by any means include the Doc∣trines of our Lord's essential Divinity, and the expiatory nature of his Sacrifice upon the Cross) concerning which I may affirm that (although they have been often can∣vassed with much bitterness of contention, and have sometimes produced all the <HI>Evils</HI> of Schism) a Layman, who is not obliged to subscribe the public confession of Faith, needs give himself very little trouble to ex∣amine whether they be <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false</HI>: But a DEFECT, in the of MISSION the Ministers of the Gospel, <HI>invalidates</HI> the <HI>Sacraments, affects</HI> the <HI>Purity</HI> of all <HI>Public Worship</HI>; and <HI>is</HI> therefore a <HI>matter</HI> which deserves <HI>to be investigated,</HI> by every man who is sincerely a Christian</P>

the Cause of Truth, injure the <HI>equally im∣portant Cause</HI> of <HI>universal, tender, heaven directed Charity</HI> towards all the Descendants of Adam. Let us remember, that the most <HI>vigorous</HI> mind, is, perhaps, not <HI>com∣pletely fortified</HI> against the Power of Preju∣dice; and that, if others differ from <HI>us,</HI> every Man in the Course of his Life, hath differed from <HI>himself.</HI></P>
<P>Let us, therefore, extend to Sectaries, and Dissenters of every Denomination, those Indulgences which, (when they were tri∣umphant, and the Church was in the Dust) <HI>we did not enjoy</HI>; and whilst Duty requires us to <HI>expose</HI> their <HI>Errors,</HI> and to <HI>repel</HI> their <HI>Encroachments</HI>; Let our Conduct convince such of them as are <HI>open to Conviction,</HI> that we can <HI>love the Men,</HI> whose <HI>Principles we disapprove.</HI></P>
