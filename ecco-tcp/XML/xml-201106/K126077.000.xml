<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE learned Dr. <HI>Wintringham,</HI> in the Introduction to his Treatise on the GOUT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tractatus de Podagra, <HI>in</HI> 8vo.</NOTE>, very justly observes, <Q>"That the Phaenomena of this Disease have been variously treated by Authors, and rendred intricate by the Numbers of Hypotheses, which have wholly ob∣scured the true Nature of this Malady; or at least have only given us a lame and uncertain Account."</Q> Wherefore he closes it in the following Manner: <Q>"It is clear, that this Disease as yet remains in the Dark, which we hope, may one Day appear in its proper Light."</Q> I have al∣ready made some small Mention concerning this Malady in my <HI>Compendium Anatomico-Medicum Practicum,</HI> published in <HI>Latin, Anno</HI> 1747.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>It is not the empty Zeal of Applause, that pushes me on to make public the following Treatise; but the real Service of Mankind, and the Welfare of those who are afflicted with this severe Disorder.</P>
<P><HI>Benevolent Reader,</HI></P>
<P>I beseech your Acceptance of this short Essay with Humanity and Candour, hum∣bly desiring, that any Errors you may meet with, may in a humane and friendly Manner be set to rights.</P>
<P>If this should prove acceptable to Man∣kind, I will in a short Time make public all my particular Observations on the GOUT.</P>
<P>It will be to no Purpose to detain you any longer from the Treatise itself, therefore I close this Introduction with the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L>Tu, scio, tu fateor, novisii rectius istis,</L>

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE GOUT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Gout</HI> is a tensive and lacerating Pain about the Joints, chiefly returning in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hippoc.</HI> Sect. vi. Aphorism 55.</NOTE> Spring and Autumn, aris∣ing from an Obstruction in the nervous Vessels and A∣crimony of the Fluids; whence Redness, Swelling, and chalky Con∣cretions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boer∣haave</HI> Aphoris. 1254-61, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. In general it is called <HI>Arthritis,</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifying a Joint, because this Complaint chiefly seizes those Parts. It likewise takes its Name from the several Parts of the Body it attacks, to wit, in the Hands, <HI>Chiragra</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>a Hand, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Prey or Seizure, there∣by denoting its cruel Ravages and Injury wheresoever it comes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sciatica</HI> or <HI>Hip-Gout,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Hip. In the Knees <HI>Gonogra,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Knee, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>Podagra</HI> in like manner is from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Foot, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, whence the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Feet is so termed.</P>
<P>There are various other Denominations which all take their origin from the parts affected, the Cause being still the same, some∣times seizing one Place sometimes another.</P>
<P>Many are apt to believe the <HI>Rheuma∣tism</HI> to be either <HI>Gout</HI> or <HI>Scurvy,</HI> but impro∣perly; it has its Name from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to flow, hence <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Rheum, thereby denoting a Flowing of Humours to a Part, yet the <HI>Rheu∣matism</HI> partakes somewhat of these Diseases.</P>
<P>The renowned <HI>Sydenham</HI> hath well treated this Disease, yet must own in my Opinion, he makes use of bleeding too frequently. It chiefly shews itself in the same Places, where the <HI>Gout</HI> appears, whence in some measure the Mistake arises.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lumbago</HI> was observed by the An∣tients; in which the Pain in the Loins is so great, that the Patient is obliged to sit or stand upright: If he moves to either Side, or endeavours to bend forward or backward, then he suffers excruciating Pains, and some∣times even Convulsions. The same Diffi∣culties
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>are found in moving the Neck, if that Part is afflicted, as it often happens to be. When it seizes the Region of the <HI>Os sacrum</HI> it is often termed the <HI>lower rheu∣matic Lumbago;</HI> by some also it is called the <HI>rheumatic Gonogra,</HI> if in the Knees: Yet this Disease may for the most part be distinguished from the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Scurvy;</HI> if the Person has not had either of these be∣fore, then I should esteem it the <HI>Rheuma∣tism,</HI> and not the <HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P>It is not necessary for me here to explain the Cause of the regular Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> which invades a little before the vernal E∣quinox, and after the autumnal; for <HI>Win∣tringham</HI> has learnedly treated of this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. iv. See also <HI>De Gorter</HI>'s Commentary in his <HI>Medicina Hippocratica</HI> on <HI>Hipp.</HI> Sect. vi. Aphorism 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The noble <HI>Willis</HI> and <HI>Heinsius</HI> also [who has wrote in <HI>Dutch</HI> a Tract of this Malady] deserves to be read again and again; which makes good the old Proverb,</P>
<Q><HI>Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit.</HI></Q>
<P>The <HI>Gout</HI> under its various Denomina∣tions is either <HI>hereditary</HI> or <HI>acquired.</HI> Its Cause is two fold,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> From a Straitness and Rigidity or Stiffness of the nervous Vessels.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From an Acrimony and Tena∣city of the Fluids<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>H. Boerh.</HI> Aphorism. 1262-63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence every Fault committed in the <HI>Non-naturals</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To wit, Air, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Watch∣ing, Motion and Rest, Retention and Excretion, and the Passions of the Mind.</NOTE> (as they are termed by Phy∣sicians) hasten and bring on the Fit. It principally afflicts in Parts remote from the Brain. The Defect lies in the last Office of Digestion. 1st. From our Food is Chyle produced, 2dly. The Serum or Whey, 3dly. The Blood, and lastly, The nervous Spirit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Viscera,</HI> or Organs of the first Con∣coctions are good, but that ultimate or last Effect is not properly performed. Our Ma∣ster of the Faculty, the great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> is of the same Opinion; for he saw a Patient who had about the Joint a Swelling that broke without Pain; he forced a Needle quite through to the Bone without any Un∣easiness, and took out this chalky Matter which was made up with the smallest Ves∣sels, thus destroyed and changed. It is also plain, that the Blood, Serum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not in fault, for they equally exercise their several Functions; the gouty Subject can rea∣son properly, and feels the Power of Love as before: Hence I have often admired <HI>Hip∣pocrates,</HI> where he says, the <HI>Gout</HI> cleanses
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>the most minute Recesses of the Blood in old Men; for after a Fit, they, for the most part remain free and well for Months; and in this Course, they may obtain the good old Age of Fourscore or upwards; where∣fore this Disease must not be in the Blood, but in the Ultimate <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Spirit of the Blood.</P>
<P>Hence it is necessary (as also <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and <HI>Helmont</HI> observes) that the whole Body be recruited in the Solids, and the Fluids mended, and corrected before the Cure can be accomplished; but this is to be done by restorative Medicaments, and not those of a purgative Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Otto Tachenius</HI> (in his Tract <HI>de Morborum Principe</HI>) says, that a subtile corroding Acid is the Cause of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and hence an <HI>Alcali,</HI> it being quite an Opposite, destroying and driving out the Malady, he esteems as a Specific: which acrid Cause, arising from too great Rigidity or Straitness in the Vessels, Venery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> destroys the best and finest Part of the Nerves. He got great Profit by this Invention, yet the Medicine did not answer. It is inscribed on the Statue erected to the Memory of <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> that he could cure the <HI>Gout,</HI> by which, I suppose, is to be understood, he cured the Fit by order∣ing a good Diet, giving proper Anodynes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this does not root out the Seeds of the Disease; Nature left to herself would have performed thus much.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
<P>A Man in <HI>Holland</HI> made Trial of all the Remedies he could pick up, among the rest the <HI>Caryocostinum,</HI> but was much the worse for it, notwithstanding the great Praises given it by its Inventor <HI>Eugenius.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> as well as in <HI>Holland,</HI> there is a noted Powder highly recommended in this Disease; it is made with <HI>Germander, Ground-pine,</HI> the lesser <HI>Centaury,</HI> the Roots of <HI>Birthworth</HI> and <HI>Gentian;</HI> and distinguish∣ed by the Title of the Great and Noble Duke of <HI>Portland.</HI> It is true, this Powder will mitigate the Pains; but in my Practice, I have found it to produce Obstructions in the smaller Vessels, and cause the morbid Matter to attack fresh Places; hence if it should retire to some of the more noble <HI>Viscera,</HI> Death in a short Time, must be the Event. I readily own, that if the gouty Person, having this Malady, only in a recent and slight manner, observes a good Diet, during the Use of this Powder, he may, for a Time, have his Pains lessened and abated; but it is not in the Power of this Remedy to era∣dicate the peccant Matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gout</HI> is not only dangerous in it∣self, but likewise of all Diseases the most severe, and obstinate in its Continuance, tormenting poor Mortals, for the most part, as long as Lise lasts; from whence the Saying,</P>
<Q><HI>Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram.</HI>
<BIBL>JUVENAL.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<P>We may further add the Words of Dr. <HI>Wintringham</HI> in the End of his Treatise, where he observes, <Q>"That notwithstand∣ing the vain Boastings of <HI>Empirics,</HI> it is quite evident, that no Specific has been given, by the Help of which, this Di∣sease has been rooted out."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> takes notice, <Q>"That Eu∣nuchs have not the <HI>Gout,</HI> neither are bald or bare-headed. Also, that Women<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In our Days this holds not good. But pray, can we find no Reason for this?
<P><HI>Crescentibus delictis crescunt paenae.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Frigora, Vina, Venus podagrant corpora nostra.</HI></P></NOTE> are free from it unless their natural Courses are deficient:"</Q> And further, <Q>"That Youth have it not before they Use Venery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hipp.</HI> Sect. vi. Aph. 28, 29, and 30.
<P><HI>H. Boerhaave</HI> Aphorism. 1268.</P>
<P><HI>H. Boerhaave</HI> Aphorism. 1269.</P></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Our Father <HI>Hippocrates</HI> has here declared Things worth notice, but yet he does not say this Disease is incurable.</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Boerhaave</HI> observes, <Q>"That this Disease cannot be cured, unless by Medicines, which have Power to cor∣rect and change the bad State of the Body, whence this Disorder arises ‖."</Q></P>
<P>The hereditary <HI>Gout,</HI> and that attended with stony Concretions are of all the most dif∣ficult to cure ‡. For the hereditary is the Effect of the whole Compages of the human Machine, and shews itself in its own pro∣per
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>time, in like manner, as the Secretion of the male Seed appears after Puberty, having its Origin from the Nerves so ingen∣dered.</P>
<P>The Tophi, or Chalk-stones do not hap∣pen till after all the Juices of the Body have been infected; hence we may plainly learn, why they are the worst and most difficult to be cured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated <HI>John De Gorter</HI> (late Professor at <HI>Harderwych,</HI> but at present of <HI>Petersburg</HI>) observes in his <HI>Chirurgia Repurgata</HI> (Lib. ii. Cap. ii. Par. 205.) That the <HI>Tophi</HI> or <HI>Nodes,</HI> in the <HI>Lues venerea,</HI> are to be treated in the same manner, as a <HI>Caries</HI> or <HI>Rotten∣ness</HI> of the Bones; but that no Remedy has been given for the <HI>gouty Tophi:</HI> There is good Reason in what this worthy Man mentions, for Ointments, Emplasters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> externally applyed, do nothing; it being necessary, first to remove the Cause, and then the <HI>Tophi</HI> will spontaneously disappear.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now to the Method of treating this Disease.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boerhaave</HI> Aphorism. 1270.</NOTE></P>
<P>During the Paroxysm or Fit, I carefully avoid every Thing which may hinder or disturb the Evacuation of the peccant Matter. Therefore I shun bleeding, for the Blood being lessened in Quantity, the Pressure to∣wards the excretory Vessels is likewise dimi∣nished; and thus the Matter which should be evacuated, is retained, whereby grievous and heavy Symptoms ensue ‡.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Wintringham</HI> directs Emetics and Purgatives to be repeated occasionally, in order to clear the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> of their Cru∣dities;
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>but I abstain from such Remedies, for they occasion a Tumult in the nervous Juices, draw off the more fluid Parts, and destroy their expulsive Power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herm. Boerhaave <HI>Aph. 1271.</HI></NOTE>, whereby the natural Secretions are much hindred.</P>
<P>Medicines that encourage Sweat, and also those that pass by Urine, make the Cir∣culation of the Blood more rapid, and of Course the offending Matter is determined in a larger Quantity to be separated and car∣ried off, hence the present Fit will be in∣creased. It is best that the Concoction and Evacuation of the gouty Matter be left to the sole Work of Nature.</P>
<P>I would refer the Reader to the 1273d Aphorism of the immortal <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> it deserving a particular Regard, nay even all of them on this Subject are well worth our perusal.</P>
<P>During the Fit, we can only endeavour to render the Pain as mild as possible, by blunting the Acrimony or Sharpness of the morbid Matter, and gently helping forward its Expulsion out of the Body. To effect this, I endeavour to dilute and thin the Blood, that the Matter unfit for Circulation, and lodged at the Joints, may flow with more Facility and Ease. I order a <HI>temperat∣ing Powder,</HI> three or four Times in a Day, with a <HI>medicated</HI> Liquor to be plentifully drank. When the Pain is severe and scarce
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>sufferable, I give fifty, sixty or seventy Dops of an <HI>anodyne Elixir</HI> in a large Draught of the above Drink. I never use any outward Application during the Fit, unless the sick Person should be very impatient and desirous of it; in which Case, I apply an <HI>anodyne Cata∣plasm</HI> or <HI>Fomentation.</HI> If the gouty Mat∣ter should recoil to the internal Parts; and there attack some of the noble <HI>Viscera</HI> or Bowels, we must immediately try all in our Power to drive it out again to the Joints, with large Draughts of an <HI>aromatic Decoction, Fomentations and Blisters</HI> too if requisite.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boerhaave</HI> Aphorism 1281.</NOTE> By these Means many may be preserved from sudden Death.</P>
<P>Out of the Fit, I take Care to prevent the Encrease of the gouty Matter, also to shake off that which has, in some measure, begun to fix itself. And for that Purpose.</P>
<P>First the Patient must carefully observe a good Diet, especially a milky one, for Milk has been separated from every gross Part, having already passed through the several Di∣gestions in the Animal; hence it does not beget those Crudities any other Diet is liable to.</P>
<P>The gouty Patient, while he is under his Course of Medicines, ought to have the following Verse inscribed over his Chamber∣door.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
<Q><L>Esto pius Domino, sobrius tibi, justus in om∣nes,</L>
<L>Ista tria animae causa salutis erit.</L></Q>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Dolaeus</HI> writ well on this Head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Encyclop. Med. <HI>p. 244.</HI></NOTE>, learn a Lesson (says he) from the rank herd of Debauchees, who, in our Tippling-houses gorge themselves with strong Beer: What foul Savours exhale from their impure Bodies, how are they agitated by an unquiet and restless Life, how great a Dull∣ness to their Wit, how benumbed their Senses, how feeble their Limbs, how over∣whelmed is that noble Part, their Brain. As when the Earth is wet by heavy Rains, Linnen and Paper grow limp and moist, standing Waters and Sewers stink and are offensive; even so, when too much Liquor has diffused itself through the whole Body, the Breast, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are beset with Catarrhs, the Ears have a Tinkling Noise, the Eyes grow dim, a Cough invades the Lungs, the Head is seized with Giddiness, the Nerves and Muscles are tortured with Pains not unlike those of the Gout; and all this is the Effect of too hard drinking.</P>
<Q><L>Qui vult alterius cyathis haurire salutem,</L>
<L>Ille lucrum referet, perdat ut ipse suum.</L>
<L>Ense cadunt multi, perimit sed crapula plures,</L>
<L>Nec facit ad multos rapula multa dies.</L></Q>
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<P>The great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> directs, <Q>"The Use of aromatic, bitter and antiscorbutic Plants; lixivial fixed Salts in a small Dose, often repeated, and continued a a long Time; nourishing Meats and Drink, that are light and easy of Diges∣tion; constant riding on Horse-back in a pure and clear Air, with frequent Friction and Motion of the Parts; lastly, going to bed early, and sleeping late in the Morning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boerh.</HI> Aphorism 1275.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The Reader may farther compare this with the Words of Doctor <HI>Wintringham</HI> in his before-mentioned Treatise: He may also see my <HI>Dissertatio Medica de sanitate ejusque Conservatione,</HI> where I have expressly wrote on Diet, and the Preservation of Health.</P>
<P>Constant Exercise is directed by the noble <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> and very justly too; for Sloth is Sepulchre of the Living; to stand still and be unactive is pernicious; if the Air stag∣nates it becomes pestilential; if Water is without Motion, it soon is putrid and cor∣rupt; if the Land is not cultivated it be∣comes Desert and waste; in like manner the Warrior laying aside his Arms, Rust and Canker prey upon them; the Musician too neglecting his Instrument, the Chords of Harmony decay and are useless; the Moth also makes his Inroads on our horded Gar∣ments: Thus sings the Poet <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>

<P>What says the old Divine <HI>Hippocrates?</HI> Indolence moistens and renders the Body weak and flaccid; Labour and Industry throws off the superfluous Juices, and makes it firm and robust.</P>
<P>The Disease of Drowsiness and unstable Judgment is the Offspring of Negligence and want of Care<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rolfinck Meth. Med. Spec. Praef. ad lect. in princip.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Always to sit is bad, for the pancreatic Juice and Bile, which is a Balsam necessary to be mixed with the Chyle, is by this Inactivity precipitated in the smaller Intes∣tines, hence arises a <HI>Cacochylia</HI> or bad State of Chyle; wherefore instead of a sweet nu∣tritious Chyle, an acid aquose Fluid enters the Lacteals.</P>
<P>Also the Ferment in the Stomach becomes acid, which afterwards changes whatever it receives into the same Acidity, after the manner of the Fermentation in making Bread (for a little Yeast being mingled with the Flour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> soon communicates the same Ferment to the whole Mass.) Hence vari∣rious Diseases arise.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
<P><HI>Blautus Palinurus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Curcurl.</HI> Act. 11. p. 167.</NOTE> directs a <HI>Cappadocian</HI> (whose Blood had not a free Circulation) to walk, it being the best Remedy for the Spleen.</P>
<P>Agreeable to <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> every gouty Person ought to ride in a clear, but not a cold Air: As Chilliness or Cold is the Fore∣runner of Mortality, thus a due Warmth shews the vital intestine Motion, that is so ne∣cessary to Life; for as long as we live, we must enjoy a more or less Degree of Heat: Cold is injurious to the Nerves as <HI>Euripides</HI> bears Testimony, where he says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, Cold is very hurtful to a thin or lean habit of Body.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> also takes notice, that those who travel through Snow, or in extreme cold Weather, so as to have their Feet, Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> benumbed thereby, are much afflicted by their Approach to any sudden Heat, and have intolerable Itchings, and that in some even Blisters arise, like those from a Burn, but this happens not till after they begin to grow warm.</P>
<P>Cold Bathing is prejudicial, for it pro∣duces a sudden Hurry and Tumult to Na∣ture, because of the immediate Change from the warm Air into cold Water; thus the Perspiration is in a Moment checked, and all the moist impure and saline Effluvia re∣maining
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>within the Pores, they putrify and inflame the whole Mass of Blood, and so produce Fevers, Inflammations, Gout, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Concerning the Disadvantages of Cold Bathing. See <HI>Oration.</HI> D. Wesserhausen <HI>de Diaeta stud.</HI> s. 8. p. 5. <HI>it. Zeil. Handb.</HI> p. 11. p. 404. <HI>Zacut. Lucit. H. Ephem. Germ. An.</HI> 1. <HI>Obs.</HI> 84. <HI>Dol.</HI> d. 1. p. 190.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Reason is that the Body undergoes a greater Alteration by Air from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (Transpiration) or Breathing of Vapours through the Pores, than from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (Inspi∣ration) or taking Air into the Lungs; hence an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Obstruction of the na∣tural Perspiration is the Mother of many Diseases.</P>
<P>It is observed that many who labour under Fevers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Spring, if they do not guard themselves well against the Air, though they may escape Death, yet are sub∣ject to Relapses.</P>
<P>Moreover, the sick Man should be early in Bed in the Evening, and late in the Morn∣ing, as <HI>Boerhaave</HI> observes; for Sleep is the best Specific in all Diseases, it is a Secret in Medicine more valuable than Gems or pre∣cious Stones; and that Physician ought to be much esteemed who can assist the Wants of Nature in this Respect, with Security and Advantage to the Sick<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Croll.
