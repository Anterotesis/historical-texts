<HEAD>A short Description of the Composition, Preparation and Pro∣perties of the THREE GREAT MEDICINES prepared and dispensed at the TEMPLE OF HEALTH, in the centre of the <HI>ROYAL TERRACE, ADELPHI, London:</HI> and which are now sold in almost every city and great town in the world; being perhaps the first advertised Medicines that sovereign Princes, and crowned Heads! were ever advis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, or by their Physicians permitted to take.</HEAD>

<HEAD>I. ELECTRICAL AETHER! OR, AN AGGREGATE COMPOUND OF THE MOST ACTIVE FACULTIES OF THE MATERIAL SOUL OF THE UNIVERSE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS admirable Composition is one of the purest and most subtil essences in nature. It is a combination, or concen∣tration of all her elementary powers, and vivifying influences: be∣ing an essence extracted by air, magnetism, and the electrical or celestial fire, from the richest oriental aromatics, &amp;c. with the balmiest and most active aether. A few of the richest, mildest, and most cordial roots, barks, seeds, flowers, fruits, gums and balsams, which flow into this great metropolis from the four quar∣ters of the globe, especially those from Asia, and the choicest of the British simples, are under my own immediate inspection selected, properly prepared, and put into massy glass vessels, and upon them is poured a due quantity of the finest aetherial spirit. They are then placed in one of the great metallic globes on the dome of the electrical Temples of Health and of Hymen, in the Apollo and other apartments of those GREAT and most useful Institutions, to be acted upon by the celestial fire, &amp;c. and lastly, the essence is purified by filtration upon a new principle, which prevents all possibility of the finest and most volatile parts evaporating.</P>
<P>The globes are entirely lined with metal in the in—as well as on the outside. They are twelve in number, each containing full thirty-six gallons. The glass vessels too, are covered with metal, inclosed in curious magnetic cases, and their stoppers are pierced with glass tubes and thick metal rods, which end in a multitude of points, from which streams of the electrical fire, &amp;c.—are conti∣nually pouring in upon the aether and aromatics, in luminous and most glorious streams.</P>
<P>The immense quantity of this vivifying restorative fire, &amp;c. which is accumulated in these Temples, flows thus into the medicines through the rods and tubes above-mentioned, which with the magnetic efflu∣vium passes even through the outside of the glasses, &amp;c. to the sub∣stances contained in them: for each of the four great globes be∣comes
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>a genial, <HI>cool</HI> OVEN, glowing with the plenitude of these sa∣lutary, vital, and harmonious influences.</P>
<P>By this curious and most wonderful process, like every operation which I perform on my patients, with this, or with any other part of my astonishing and tremendous apparatus, (which, altoge∣ther, in both the Temples, occupies in fact twenty rooms) I have it in absolute command and subjection acting arbitrarily or at pleasure on the medicines,—on my patients—or on any part of their body or limbs particularly affected, in any quantity, or with any degree of power, according to the nature of the substances, or as the various constitutions, &amp;c.—of my patients require: in short, the whole of the apparatus employed in making the three Great Medicines men∣tioned in this Description, if solid metal, would weigh considerably above seven hundred thousand pounds. After the above account of the composition and preparation of the electrical aether, it would be quite unnecessary for me to dwell on its manifold and surprizing virtues. Philosophers, physicians and chemists must plainly see, that by the above means, a rich, yet SIMPLE <HI>homogene,</HI> and VI∣VIFYING QUINTESSENCE must be produced,—an utter enemy to diseases and corruption,—and a cordial peace-maker in all strife and discord in the human body! These facts must be too obvious to <HI>every</HI> person of even a very common understanding, to require commenting upon. I shall just say that for preventing every spe∣cies of infection, and for curing all low, nervous, lingering and putrid diseases, nothing on earth can equal this most noble quin∣tessence which I chuse to call, simply,—<HI>Electrical Aether;</HI> and as it is much easier and wiser to prevent diseases, than to cure them, I shall point out, very briefly, its uses in the first place as a pre∣ventive.</P>
<P>First, then, all persons who frequent public places, and who regard their health, ought never to be without a vial of the electri∣cal aether, even in their pocket—those especially who are subject to catch colds and dangerous disorders,—or who have weakness and oppressions at their breast and stomach,—or a nervous system irri∣table and relaxed.</P>
<P>It is well known, by every person who knows any thing at all of medicine or philosophy, that the air of any place after it has been breathed, and charged with the phlogisticated or mephitic breath, perspiration, &amp;c. of even the cleanest, soundest and healthiest persons, —becomes not only altogether unfit for respiration, but likewise abso∣utely and highly poisonous. But how much more dangerous and un∣wholesome must it be, to draw into our lungs, perhaps for several hours together, the foul and putrid exhalations which reek from the dirty bo∣dies and garments—secret sores—and corrupted lungs crammed up in places of public amusement!—I am not at all surprized at the severe diseases and sudden deaths which happen among both young and
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>old. No; but I am astonished that MANY MORE do not happen; and that so many rational beings should submit to the drudgery and danger, not to mention the expence, of attending crouded —nonsensical—public places. But as it is in vain to oppose the ty∣rannic force of fashion, or to shake off the mighty influence of HABIT, which, with absolute sway govern every thing that hath the breath of life, I would advise every prudent person before they go into such places to fortify their body, and harmonize their mind, with taking a tea spoonful of the electrical aether, or nervous aethe∣rial balsam on sugar, or in any thing they like best—and even to smell now and then to the former in such places when they sus∣pect danger, or when they find themselves languid or oppressed. —By these precautions, many hundreds of the nobility and gentry in Europe, experience daily from it the happiest effects; and when they return home faint, relaxed and exhausted, from over heated rooms, public or private; from enervating indulgencies too, <HI>(in sacrificing to Venus or Bacchus)</HI> or from violent agitations of body and of mind—they are presently refreshed, recruited, composed, and invigorated by smel∣ling to the electrical aether for a few minutes, by taking a tea spoonful or two of IT, (OR RATHER, of the nervous aetherial balsam) in a glass of brandy,—of wine,—or of cold water:—or even by pouring a lit∣tle of the electrical aether into a bason or quart mug half filled with hot water, coffee, green tea, or an infusion of aromatic Bri∣tish herbs, flowers, &amp;c. and breathing over it for a few minutes. By these means, under God! sweet, sound, and refreshing sleep, and mental tranquility, are with certainty procured,—and all possibi∣lity of disease or decay, effectually warded off:—and these happy effects are rendered still more certain, kindly and lasting, if the persons will wash or bathe their face, neck, hands, feet, and pri∣vate parts—ESPECIALLY THE LATTER, with pure COLD water—or with milk and water—about blood warm. This simple and de∣lightful affair of bathing the private parts and fundament every night and morning, summer and winter, in sickness and in health, in cold milk or water—is of more importance to the bodily health, youthful beauty, and sweet desireableness of men and WOMEN, than any thing I can possibly mention or inculcate. If this most salutary practice of applying even partially, cold or at most tepid water or milk, to the surface of the body and limbs,—if simplicity, modera∣tion, regularity and temperance, in the indulgence of every appe∣tite, and in the gratification of every desire—in a word, if prudence, wisdom, delicacy, virtue, and that genuine religion which flows warm and silent in an everlasting and supremely cordial circulation, between THE PERFECTION OF EVERY EXCELLENCE— THE ETERNAL SOURCE OF LIFE, LOVE, LIGHT AND HAPPINESS!—and the benevolent—the melting—the enlarged human breast!—If this sterling—this all-blessing religion which knows no distinction of sect, church, age or country—
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>and whose signet of divinity is liberty, forbearance and universal love! — if these, with their white-robed attendants who came down from heaven and who will conduct us thither—namely, Inno∣cence, Activity, and Peace—were permitted to direct and controul our thoughts, words and actions daily, from our birth to the last day of life—the image of God which he stampt on mankind at their original creation would be in a great measure recovered and pre∣served—we should continue very long and very happily in this transi∣ent—probationary state of existence—a hundred years seeming but as one summer's day, while with a gradual descent, we would glide gently and sweetly down the hill of life, under the serene and lucid influence of its evening sky.</P>
<P>Behold, here, in a few words, my courteous and intelligent rea∣der, a complete system, or the whole Art of Health, beauty, love∣liness, long-life and happiness, temporal and eternal; WHICH, if properly and constantly attended to, physicians and dignified clergy∣men, would be almost as unnecessary in the world, as soldiers and solicitors; and as are such codes of laws and discipline, in church and in state as they are at present ADMINISTERED in almost every nation on earth,—which are in general dark, unreasonable, unjust and diaboli∣cal, and extremely contradictory to the spirit, and advancement of true religion, sound policy, and of the Healing Art, however agreeable to the letter of the law, the canons of the churches, or the practice of the Royal Colleges of Physicians. Millions of the human spe∣cies have felt, and millions do now feel, too sensibly the truth of this assertion.—O Law! O Physic! O Divinity! when—when will you under go a necessary ordeal—a thorough, a rational reformation I— As to WARS—I will not mention them; for my whole frame qui∣vers with horror even at the thought of them.—Carnage!— bank-ruptcies, poverty! — devastation! —hunger and thirst,—horrible ap∣prehensions!—forced from our native land;—and all these for what? why, for the honor and Glory of the God of mercy and peace —for a punctilio of what is called national honor;—too often indeed for nothing at all—to obtain an eventual evil—or for the acquisition of the shadow of a shade. I could almost venture I think to prophecy, that the time will come, tho' perhaps it is very distant, when the in∣terests and differences of nations, and what is called the ballance of power, will be settled by less horrible—less unnatural—less diabolical means than fire and sword; and that the children of those men, naval and military, who are now trained up to, and who glory in ruin and devastation, carnage, theft, depredation and murder, will be taught to adorn the sciences, embellish the arts, or to illuminate the human mind—instead of hewing down like savage monsters, their fellow creatures—or of eating up, like drones, the bread of the children of industry. But I beg pardon for making this digression; I beg pardon, I mean, of their Worships and High Mightinesses, the CLERGY!!! the HEROES or MEN OF WAR!! the LAWYERS! and the
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>physicians, and I will now return to finish the descriptive sketch of the nature and properties of my electrical aether.</P>
<P>In the course of last winter I had frequent opportunities of ob∣serving the good effects of this essence, and of the nervous aetherial balsam, upon many Ladies and Gentlemen who were uncommonly susceptible of the evils which arise from the cold rawness and fogs of this variable climate; occasioning rehumatic complaints in the joints, and still more particularly in the head and face, with swel∣lings of the cheek and gums, sore throats, and tickling defluxions on the breast and lungs. By the use of these two medicines, and by keeping the body open with the Imperial Pills, those com∣plaints which formerly had confined them almost constantly thro' the winter to the house were happily prevented; and in others who were seized as usual, the cough, soreness of the breast, fe∣vers and inquietudes were speedily carried off by the gentle and moderate use of these precious, and most friendly medicines.</P>
<P>But the electrical aether is more especially necessary for those who attend courts of justice, public meetings, sick persons, and those places where hundreds of common people are crammed up in the galleries, &amp;c. Nothing in nature <HI>is</HI> or <HI>can</HI> be equal to the electri∣cal aether, the nervous aetherial balsam, and the cool open air in curing all, even the very worst, and most confirmed species of low∣nervous-putrid fevers; ulcerated and gangrenous sore throats; the small-pox,—mortifications, and the whole tribe of putrid con∣sumptive, dropsical, scorbutic and paralytic disorders. By only smell∣ing to, or breathing over the aether, and taking now and then a tea spoonful of it, or of the balsam in a cup of white wine,—tar water, or common cold water,—the patient always finds instant relief, and generally a perfect cure; while those about him, or in the house, are effectually secured from that dangerous malignancy which often sweeps off whole families into one common and untimely grave.</P>
<P>As the effects, or rather the medicines themselves, fly in a mo∣ment with the swiftness of light from the sun—over the whole system, no other cordial whatever in nature has been found so in∣stantaneously and so lastingly to recruit the strength and spirits after great fatigue, or violent exertions of body or of mind, espe∣cially in Venereal pleasures.—They refresh, brace, compose, com∣fort, and literally speaking, ILLUMINATE, all the bodily,—and thro' them—all the mental faculties; in short, in all severe ill∣nesses, in sinkings, and in faintings in consequence of severe ex∣cruciating pain, profuse evacuations of blood, &amp;c. and draining weaknesses of every kind, or from whatever causes proceeding, these medicines (especially the nervous aetherial balsam) are ALWAYS found to produce the most astonishing good effects, which are manifested to the patient, and to every one present, even the first minute they are used.</P>

<HEAD>II. NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM! OR, THE RESTORATIVE AETHERIAL OIL, FOR DECAYED AND WORN OUT CONSTITUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IF the reader can conceive of the richest—purest—and most strengthening parts of all the cordial and nourishing things he is acquainted with in nature—being extracted, purified, exalted, harmonized and concentrated into a small compass,—he may also conceive of the nature and properties of this precious balsam.</P>
<P>The Peruvian bark, cinnamon, saffron, castor, lavender, sage, rose∣mary, red-rose-buds, electrical nitre, ambergrise, myrrh, amber, and benjamin;—the balsams of Tolu and Gilead,—and various other bal∣my bracers, and fragrant aromatic strengtheners are selected with my own hand, and prepared under my own eye: a pure aetherial es∣sence, combined with a certain portion of the richest and most ge∣nuine wine, is then poured upon the ingredients, and being pro∣perly mixed and secured, they are placed to macerate and digest, like the electrical aether, under the united influences of dephlogisti∣cated or vivifying air, aether, magnetism and electricity, in the great globes which compose the tremendous pyramids on the domes of the Temples.</P>
<P>From the present general stile of living—from the luxury, folly, dissipation, and enervating indulgences of persons, perhaps of every rank, the disorders which now a days prevail, and which harass and wear out human life, are such as proceed either from condensed fluids, morbid humours, and heterogeneous viscidities in the blood or lymph;—or, from irritation, relaxation and debility of the so∣lids and nervous system. The former however complicated,—how∣ever various in their appearances, are very justly attributed to vene∣real, scorbutic, gouty, or scrophulous humours—and the latter are promiscuously and not improperly termed nervous; they arise chiefly from tepid soft luxurious and artificial living, enervating indulgen∣cies, I mean in venereal pleasures, and from drinking daily that agonizing yet bewitching poison, foreign tea; and are often so dis∣tressing and oppressive to the miserable patient,—as to make riches and honours, and even life itself a burthen—a weary and heavy bur∣then, which they would gladly,—nay even sometimes—impiously and fatally venture to lay down.</P>
<P>In the former cases, namely, in viscidities and impurities of the blood and juices, from scorbutic, venereal, gouty and rheumatic humours, the Imperial Pills, by and by to be described, will be found in general the safest and most certain antidote: and in the latter, viz. in all nervous, putrid and debilitated habits, this nervous
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>atherial balsam is without exception the mildest and most effectual remedy that can be met with in the whole circle of nature!—for in all nervous complaints and weaknesses;—in all convulsions, epi∣leptic, apoplectic and hysteric fits, in all obstructions and irregula∣rities in the monthly periods of women, particularly at the two cri∣tical and most dangerous periods of commencement and final ces∣sation, this Balsam, the Electrical Aether, or the Imperial Pills, are absolutely infallable in producing the happiest effects. For I will venture to say, that there is scarce a menstrual obstruction in the world—however complicated, or however confirmed, but what will be overcome and effectually removed by taking three tea spoonfuls of the <HI>electrical aether</HI> and as much of the Nerv. Aeth. Balsam, mixed both together in a pint of cold water for three successive mornings, if the patient is plump and sanguine; but if on the contrary, she is lean, cold and languid, she must take three tea spoonfuls <HI>of the</HI> NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM, and the like quantity of the Electrical Aether, thrice every day in wine, spirits, or herb tea, and continue it for only three days. In both cases, and under these opposite cir∣cumstances, with due attention to the above distinctions, a perfect cure will undoubtedly take place; especially if plenty of the me∣dicines be rubbed on the loins and back bone, and in the former case the application of cold water is made to THE PARTS, hands and feet, for hours daily,—and in the latter case warm wine or spirits and water—be applied daily in like manner.—In both, and in every case, running about in the open air is earnestly recom∣mended.—But when the patient is too much weakened and re∣duced from the <HI>opposite causes,</HI>—namely, too long—too copious and profuse a flow,—and great paleness and debility brought on; —REST, <HI>cool air,</HI>—the application to the parts, and indeed to every part of the body and limbs, of cold milk and water, or red wine, and a course of the nervous aetherial balsam, with an infusion or tea of the Peruvian bark, red rose leaves, and a little nitre, with Bristol or Spa water —will build her up into a rock of snowy alabaster, studded with roses and streaked with celestial blue, removing the causes of ste∣rility, or barrenness,—making her a lovely and desirable compa∣nion! —a healthy and a happy mother!—But for farther particulars relative to these delicate and important matters, see my "Private Medical Advice to Married Ladies and Gentlemen; to those especially who are not blessed with children"—with full directions for preven∣tion, or for speedy and perfect recovery after miscarriages and dan∣gerous lyings-in. To be had, comprised and printed in two sheets folio, sealed up, ALONE at my House in the Adelphi, and at the Temple of Hymen, in Pall Mall, price only One Guinea.</P>
<P>N. B. In the above, such simple, natural, and effectual means for removing the causes of barrenness in both sexes as never were recommended, or even thought of before, in any age or nation,
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>—are pointed out;—and such directions given, as will, if duly at∣tended to, make man and wife sweeter—lovelier—more amiable, —and more DESIREABLE in the eyes of one another.</P>
<P>After what has been already said, I need scarcely add, that in all scarlet, miliary, jail, bilious, nervous, putrid, spotted and ma¦lignant fevers—especially those of the East and West Indies, Ame∣rica, &amp;c. these medicines are absolute and speedy specifics. A person armed and provided with these, and with the genuine powder of Dr. James, need not fear any inflammatory fever, or any low, putrid, malignant, or bisious fever or complaint whatever; in any climate, season, or in any part of the terraqueous globe. These will be a most complete apothecary's shop, and nature, common sense, and the patient's own feelings—a <HI>trio</HI> of the safest and wisest physicians.</P>
<P>In every case, therefore, where the patient is low, faint, feeble or emaciated, from scorbutic or venereal virus, a sharp poverty— or putrid dissolution of the blood and juices;—or from want of a due elastic tone of the solids—arising from a deficiency of the vital spi∣rits—or of the balmy nervous fluid, this nervous aetherial balsam! has not its equal in nature;—and this I aver CONFIDENTLY, from very much, and very happy experience in actual practice, which in all things is the only infallible guide—the only incontrovertible evi∣dence! Thousands by it alone, have been snatched from the grave: and still many more thousands of the human species when languid and worn out with diseases, excesses, irregularities, enormities and early imprudencies, have been suddenly built up into firm rocks of blooming health, and intellectual happiness.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this short account of this great medicine, by observing, that in all lesser nervous complaints and uneasinesses, occasioned by tea, coffee, adulterated wine, or pernicious liquors; and in all those little lingering fevers, heats and chillinesses, and those tremors and quiverings of body, and restless anxieties, dread, horrors, discontent and unsettlednesses of mind, which proceed merely from an irregular circulation of the blood, or from spasms, debility, or relaxation of the nervous system,—this aetherial balsam will always be found of immediate service, and by a gentle— persevering course of it, and of the Imperial Pills, duly attending to the directions given with them, a perfect and a lasting cure will in general be obtained. Because by them the blood and juices are purified, sweetened, tempered, and brought to a pure fluid state, while the solids are braced and strengthened, and the nerves sheathed, nourished, steadied and coiled up.</P>
<P>Many fanciful, rich, and luxurious people, who are in fact in good health, and who ought by no means to take this precious aetherial balsam, or any other medicine, nevertheless accustom
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>themselves to take more or less of it, and even an imperial pill or two every day;—with such people, or when at any time they are taken into a sound and tranquil body, they produce no other operation or sensation, than a more genial and brisker flow of the blood and animal spirits,—and that species of contentment, thankfulness, and benevo∣lent gladness of heart, which makes us happy in ourselves, and agree∣able to all about us: but where they meet with diseases and corruption, they encounter them with the boldness and majesty of a lion, effec∣thally expelling them, and leaving a clean and a quiet house for health and happiness to reside in.</P>
<P>The nervous aetherial balsam, then, is by very far, and without exception, the most exhilerating, antispasmodic, bracing, restora∣tive, strengthening, and consequently antisceptic medicine in the world—infinitely superior to the common tinctures of the bark, va∣lerian, castor, saffron, lavender, &amp;c.—and infinitely more cordial and mild than the burning inflammatory salts, and fiery fetid spirits of hartshorn, eau de luce, sal volatile, and all the liqueurs, drams, and cordials, foreign and domestic, which only bewitch and give a temporary relief, which must soon give way to additional horror, darkness, dejection and despair.</P>

<HEAD>III. THE IMPERIAL PILLS. OR, THE UNIVERSAL PURIFIERS OF THE BLOOD AND JUICES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS title was given to them to mark their exceeding supe∣riority over all the analeptic or stomachic pills, antiscorbutis drops, and alterative purifying medicines that perhaps ever were in∣vented, or which are now used in the world.—In all weaknesses, op∣pressions, flatulencies, cholickly gripings, and windy distensions of the stomach and bowels, especially when those uneasy, and indeed tormenting complaints proceed from scorbutic, venereal, gouty or bilious humours, freting, corroding, and irritating the nervous coats of the stomach and bowels;—or from heats, acidities, crudities and indigestions, occasioned by full and foul feeding; excessive drinking of hot and foul wines and liquors; heats and colds, or surfeits; ir∣regular and late hours as to sleep; want of exercise, and perspiration, &amp;c. &amp;c,—in all such cases, the Imperial Pills are constantly found to give immediate relief, and if the person is prudent and temperate, by a regular and gentle perseverance in the use of them—a perfect and a lasting cure will, with a moral certainty, be obtained.</P>
<P>These pills are a composition of the purest parts of the choicest ar∣ticles of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> combined and rendered still more
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>active, by the united influences of air, aether, and magnetism<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus, Sir Isaac Newton, Van Helmont, Paracelfus, Descartes, Sydenham, Boyle, Boerhaave, and many others of the greatest phi∣losophers and physicians, ancient and modern, that ever blessed and enlightened the world, <HI>prophecied,</HI> and in all their writings <HI>insisted upon it,</HI> that whenever the practice of physic arrived to a high degree of perfection, or medicines were dis∣covered which would effectually eradicate diseases, inducing health and peace in the body and mind, alleviating the pressures of age, and lengthening human life to the longest possible period, it would be done by attending to the simple; yet divine voice of nature, and by the united influences of the great primary princi∣ples or natural agents which I so happily employ for those most important por∣poses. Animated by the concurring opinions of those great men,—stimulated by the prospects which were opened to my view by those bright luminaries of science!—shocked, too, at the very transcient, rapid and painful progress of man thro' this world;—and moreover, almost mad at the trifling absurdities of the ordinary practice in this useful but dangerous art—and at the too feeble—or too harsh effect of most medicines as commonly used,—I was compelled with a certain, as it were divine or supernatural energy or impulse, to search for wider and more rational paths, and more effectual means for the prevention and cure of diseases; how far I have succeeded those who are acquainted with my medi∣cines and practice, or who even have read my late publications, will be able to judge.—I will only say, that according to my abilities, and agreeable to the ideas and directions of those great men, I have studied and endeavoured to unite every affinity that there is between the elements and man:—between the sun, moon and stars, and man;—and in short between man and every thing in the great system of the universe (which affects his body, and thro' that his mind) however remotely, however invisibly connected with his frame. But as the <HI>perfecting</HI> all this vast and most comprehensive system requires a degree of intelli∣geuce far—very far superior to what I can pretend to, I trust that God will raise up a succession of men who will carry on and perfect what I have so happily begun.
<P>In the mean time, I respectfully intreat the correspondence of all men of learn∣ing, science, and ingenuity; most earnestly beseeching every man and woman in the world, <HI>without exception,</HI> to communicate to me personally, by their friends, or by letter, any thing that they already know, or may hereafter discover, for the cure, alleviation, or prevention of any one disease; or for rendering human existence longer or happier on this earth: and likewise whatever they now know, or may hereafter discover for the improvement or embellishment of religion, philosophy, or the useful arts; especially in metals and minerals. I will be ex∣tremely happy to be favoured with the opinions and conjectures of persons of in∣genuity, of goodness of heart, or of excentric brilliant imaginations. And as this correspondence will cost each of my friends individually, but a few pence for paying the postages of their letters, while otherwise the aggregate, centring in me, would cost probably several hundred pounds annually; I hope therefore that my liberal, polite, and ingenious correspondents will continue to have the goodness to write to me, POST PAID. Their favours shall as usual be re∣gistered, and a true account of the success of what they recommend or have dis∣covered, sent to them in whatever part of the world they reside.—Once more for the honour and glory of God:—for the good and happiness of the human species in general, I earnestly invite, and most solemnly exhort every man and woman of worth, goodness and ingenuity, in whatever sphere of life they move, from the imperial throne to the beggar's hut—to the above mentioned communica∣tions or correspondence; and by benefactions of money or lands, or testamentary donations to establish a fund to defray the expences which necessarily attend printing books, and chemical and philosophical processes and investigations—for the adcancement of true, vital, and universal religion, for the improvement of science, and for the embellishment and extension of the useful Arts.</P></NOTE> ac∣cording to the true principles of electricity, and of the philosophic chemistry, and are constantly acted upon by these powerful and most genial agents for several months in the upper globe, of the pyramidal
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>metal dome of the Temple of Health, which globe alone, like each of the other three, contains thirty-six gallons, and is of the finest burnished gold.</P>
<P>The Imperial Pills are of so mild and friendly a nature that they are found to agree perfectly well with both sexes and with every age and constitution. They operate first by dissolving all tough, cold phlegm or slime, and other gross, corrupted, bilious and putrid hu∣mours, which not only clog and irritate the stomach and bowels, but form a nest and nourishment for those common and most destructive vermin, WORMS—which they effectually kill, evacuate and carry off by stool and urine: after that, by continuing their moderate use as an alterative, without change of diet, confinement, or any irk∣some restraint whatever, they subdue, eradicate, and expel by stool, urine, and a breathing insensible perspiration, all scorbutic, gouty, rheumatic, venereal, bilious and scrophulous humours, however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the system, preying on, and exhausting the strength and spirits, and undermining and de∣stroying all the springs and principles of life.</P>
<P>Rubbing and exercise are universally allowed to be good for the re∣covery as well as for the preservation of health. Now these act by exciting the electrical fire in the body which removes obstructions, animates and braces. The Imperial Pills therefore, and the Aetherial Balsam, being filled with the electrical or celestial fire, and solar light, which the balmy resins of which they are composed have im∣bibed and do retain, promote all the natural and necessary circula∣tions, secretions and absorptions, and consequently <HI>must</HI> be of the greatest service to those persons, especially to females, who take too little free air and exercise, tho' at the same time they live full, and are of a costive or irregular habit. Upon the same grounds they are found exceedingly beneficial in those heats, spasms, pains, and uneasinesses in females, occasioned by the <HI>periodical</HI> fulness of their vessels, and <HI>from certain other causes:</HI> but the good effects in gouty, scorbutic, and rheumatic cases, and in all eruptions, or pimples of the face,—sores or blotches, of the body and limbs, however invete rately blended in the blood,—however obstinately confirmed in the constitution—are really astonishing. The dreadful train of sufferings which the miserable patients in the above cases endure, and even the most obstinate rheumatic swellings and weaknesses of the joints, &amp;c. yield very readily to the superior efficacy of these excellent pills;—
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>and they are a diuretic of so soft yet searching a nature, that they generally give very speedy ease in severe fits of the stone and gravel, and by persevering in a proper course of them, and of my Nervous Aetherial Balsam at the same time, and drinking veal broth with plenty of gum arabic dissolved in it, or of a decoction of liquorice, linseed, and marshmallow roots poured upon shred leeks, and bruised fennil seeds with some honey or treacle, they often have been found to cure radically those most painful and most excruciating disorders.</P>
<P>But in all less grievous, tho' abundantly troublesome complaints of the first passages—they are an absolute specific. For they imme∣diately restore lost appetite, and correct all hot, acrid, and four fer∣mentations in the stomach and bowels, which they so genially cool and invigotate, as to enable them to concoct and extract those fine mild nutritious juices of our food and drink, which nourish the body and gladden the soul. By these means the breath is rendered balmy and sweet; the face is cleared from scurf, heat and pimples, prema∣ture wrinkles are smoothed away and obliterated, and the com∣plexion rendered clear, smooth fresh and youthful; and all these happy effects are produced insensibly as it were, without (as I said before) confinement, particular regimen in food or drink, or hindrance of business; their operation, like the Nervous Aetherial Balsam, being so mild and congenial to human nature, that they may be taken under any circumstance, in any climate, or at any season of the year, tho' when taken merely as a preserver of health, the spring and autumn seasons are doubtless the most proper.</P>
<P>The Imperial Pills therefore, while they fortify the stomach and bowels, and purge the blood and lymph from all morbid humours, and <HI>heterogeneous</HI> sharpnesses and viscidities, they so perfectly eradicate all venereal and scorbutic diseases, that I defy the world to bring me any such case if <HI>at all curabl,</HI> but what I will radically, speedily and safely cure by a proper course first of these pills, and afterwards of my Aetherial Balsam, without the use of one grain of that horrible poison, mercury. Indeed <HI>than</HI> these medicines, and my Electrical Sul∣phur, there has been no others as yet discovered, whatever quacks and empyries may pretend, which so speedily and so completely counteract the deadly effects of mercury, and other violent medicines, which of∣ten so tear, shake, and debilitate the constitution as to make the dear bought cure of the primary complaint, no great blessing to the feeble <HI>unnerved</HI> patient. This singular and most invaluable quality of the Imperial Pills is ocularly demonstrated to the patient and to all his friends, by almost instantly stopping the highest salivation, throwing off the pocky or scorbutic virus, &amp;c. by stool, by urine, and by sweat: and by making the quicksilver run off in globules by stool in quan∣tities nearly proportioned to those that had been unfortunately used. Now the universally <HI>allowed,</HI> and <HI>two well known</HI> effects of mercury are to dissolve and break down the mass of blood into a sharp, watery
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>putrid gore;—and to tear, deaden, relax, and render tremulous the whole nervous system; but the Imperial Pills carry the mercury and all venereal and scorbutic humours entirely out of the body, restoring the healthy tone of the stomach, bowels, and solids in general;—and the nervous aetherial balsam very speedily warms, and steadies the cold—quivering—tottering body; restoring the balmy crasis of the blood and juices; sheathing, bracing, and invigorating the dry, shrunk and tremulous nerves; and absolutely cures all seminal weak∣nesses and debility in both sexes, from whatever causes proceeding, but those especially which arise from ill cured, neglected, improperly treated or repeated venereal complaints, early imprudencies, irre∣gularities, and all unnatural and inordinate exertions and indulgen∣cies especially in the sacrifices that are made to Venus, or to Bac∣chus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the peculiar and most important properties of my Nervous Aetherial Balsam is to recover and produce that genial vital warmth, which is so different from an inflaming feverish heat.</NOTE>. Let the inventors or proprietors of other medicines which are sent abroad into the world, make a parade of their PATENTS, &amp;c.—For these great medicines I never thought of such securities or sanc∣tions. No. I am not afraid of any one counterfeiting <HI>them,</HI> tho' I find it has been vainly and ridiculously attempted. The compositions are so curious and complex, and the ingredients so very subtil, that they will not bear to be analyzed by even the most skilful adept in philosophical or pharmaceutical chemistry. I repeat it. The in∣gredients are too costly and too numerous,—the processes too com∣plex and tedious,—and the apparatus employed in the preparation of them costs too many thousand pounds for most adventurers, even of abilities, in the medical or medicinal line to engage with or even to think of. They are now, I find, bought by some of the most emi∣nent of the faculty, in various parts of the world as well as in these kingdoms, and exhibited in severe dangerous and important cases sometimes as their own preparations: and I assure the nobility, gentry, and even the faculty who are desirous of knowing every ingre∣dient in the composition of each, or of either of the three medicines, that they need only apply to me to be fully satisfied in every particular which they feel themselves interested in. To know them is to approve of them; and to use them once, is to use and recommend them most cordially for ever. Such is their intrinsic excellency that they will bear every test—even the test—the criterion—the fiery ordeal of ex∣perience in the most confirmed, and most hopeless cases:—for they have been brought to their present high state of perfection by long and deliberate investigations of the real qualities of medicines, by the deepest researches into chemistry, enlightened by the important dis∣coveries and improvements which have lately been made in natural philosophy; and finally, by the nicest and most assiduous attention to the effects and operations of the medicines themselves, in a most ex∣tensive
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>course of private practice in this, as well as in various foreign countries; and the invariable result of their judicious use has been effec∣tually, to prevent, and with certainty to cure most diseases to which mankind is obnoxious,—but especially those which the natives of these islands are liable to at sea or in foreign countries—insomuch that many gentlemen, especially of the army and navy would now almost as soon go to sea without provisions, or upon along journey without money as without a certain stock of these three precious remedies. Indeed, in the hands of people of prudence and good sense, they supersede the need of a travelling physician, or of any medicine chest—for they are of themselves an apothecary's shop fully adequate to the preven∣tion and cure of most diseases. And so thoroughly convinced am I of the universal salutariness, and superior efficacy of these three great medicines, that in a VERY few years I will probably relinquish the practical part of medicine altogether, but continue to dispense these medicines all over the world, WHILE, for the good of the human species of every nation and clime,—even for the children of those who shall be born a thousand years hence, I will publickly teach medicine and philosophy in academical lectures, and from time to time publish what I am now compiling, viz. a complete System of Prophylactic and Practical Medicine; or, the whole art (without even a shadow of reserve) of preventing and curing diseases. Per∣haps, likewise, I may send into the world, a complete and rational Body of Divinity, or true vital religion, which I am now likewise preparing; and perhaps, moreover a manual of Human Prudence;—or a safe and complete guide of life: and a SIMPLE, yet full and na∣turally digested code of laws for civil, political, and ecclesiastical government,—submitted with great deference to those, to whom they more immediately, and more properly belong. But to return, I was observing the efficacy of THE THREE GREAT MEDICINES in re∣storing decayed, consumptive, and worn-out constitutions, or after severe diseases, harsh and improper medicines, or hardships and sick∣ness in foreign hot climates. Upon this subject I can scarce say enough. Yet to those who are acquainted with the medicines everything which even I <HI>could</HI> say, would be quite unnecessary. What need is there to expatiate on the genial qualities of the sun, which are universally felt, and universally acknowledged?—I will only observe for the in∣formation of the world in general, that in all such cases, they moisten, warm, refresh and build up the whole system, with bland, mild, balmy and nutritious juices; and by inducing a free, re∣gular, steady and genial circulation of the blood <HI>(which is the true radical moisture)</HI> spirits, and nervous fluid, or that aetherial invisible principle which actuates the nerves, and which altogether constitute the balmy life of the body; and, finally, by inducing the due and re∣ciprocal action of the solids and fluids on each other; or in other words, that happy <HI>equilibrium</HI>—that peaceful balance! which nature
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>delights in, and constantly endeavours to maintain in the whole vi∣sible as well as invisible creation—they produce in the human body that peaceful, homogene, tranquil state which we call health, and which is doubtless the natural and original state of all created things: for pain, discord and disease, are so very unnatural, that even pain and disease are only a departure from, and imply a possibility of health,—or the attainment of that state which nature pants after, and which man originally possessed. All distempers are in fact but a struggle between the <HI>vis vitae</HI> and the peculiar Miasma, or <HI>Fomes Mer∣bi.</HI> Indeed every species and degree of pleasure, and of bodily and mental happiness which we enjoy in this world, are only the irradia∣tions or emanations of this primary principle, namely, concord or health. This is the GREAT UNITY!—the root and branches—the flowers and the fruits—the sap and the life of mankind; To contrive and adapt, from the harmonious combination of the four elements acting on natural substances of KNOWN EFFICACY, such medicines as could root out disease, discord and strife from the human body, and produce, cultivate and nourish this heavenly unity, hath been my constant study, I may say, day and night for many years. How far I have succeeded has been long and abundantly obvious, not only from the prodigious and unprecedented sale of these Great Medi∣cines; but from the astonishing and well known numbers which are daily dismissed from the Temple of Health perfectly cured of dis∣eases which had baffled all other human means. Now this unity or health,—this SELF-REMEDY in nature for all her disorders, was the seal with which God impressed every thing at the creation. And it was THIS in man which was emphatically called, "the IMAGE OF GOD."—This was paradise for man! This was the paradise of the earth, and of all the elements.—But man departing from God, and from the innocence and simplicity in which he was created, brought discord and diseases into his soul and body;—from hence proceeds his short and uncertain existence in this world; hence flow pain, disease and death;—and from hence, too, perhaps all evil and com∣motions within and without, in the natural and in the moral world. All fevers, fermentations, jarrings, restlessness, commotions, pains and diseases in the human body, are, therefore proofs of that hid∣den—constitutional peace and health which it has lost, and necessa∣rily gravitates unto, and endeavours to regain, altho' it knows not the way—nor is it always so happy as to meet with, or follow, a friendly and unerring guide.</P>
<P>That the above medicines, conjunctly, are such a friend—such a guide! no one will doubt who has attended properly to the plain, open and simple description which I have given of them; nor will any one deny the truth of the fact, who has fairly and prudently used them—even in the most desperate cases. These great medicines then, will restore health and tranquility—because they restore in our
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>body, as I have above shewn, that original unity,—balance—har∣mony or <HI>equilibrium</HI> which nature delights in, and continually strives to maintain in all her works—especially in the human body and mind, as being the most perfect and important of all that she has created, or placed on this terraqueous globe!</P>
<P>These, therefore, conjunctly, may justly be esteemed the true and genuine UNIVERSAL MEDICINE!—the boasted and long wished for <HI>Pri∣ma Materia!—Aurum potabile!</HI> or <HI>elixir vitae!</HI> of the philosophers, che∣mists, and physicians of every age since medicine became a science.—In these three medicines, by the wonderful influence of the mighty—primary—simple agents upon each other, and upon the simple sub∣stances above mentioned, which for so many ages have been found so friendly to man—is produced and fixed,—a vivifying—homogene principle which counteracts disease, insures health, and the prolonga∣tion of our mortal existence. In the balmy bed of these three medi∣cines, all elementary and intestine strife ceases. Here, the active—the irresistible powers of air, earth, fire and water blend their seem∣ingly jarring principles, and are at peace. Here wih the swiftness of thought, they meet in one common centre. They kiss each other as it were,—cordially embrace, and are at rest in this paradisiacal—this balmy bed. For be it known (and however paradoxical it may appear, it is nevertheless a certain—sublime, and philosophical truth) that the quickest motion, is the most perfect rest. When a boy whips his top into the briskest motion—it turns about with such exceeding swiftness that it appears perfectly motionless—and he says it is asleep. Would not any thing that could pass from this to the East Indies and back again in the thousandth part of a moment—be at perfect rest?—could a thought—or any thing that could glance or be shot from your eye in London to the farthest verge—to the most distant point of the globe and back again in the millionth part of the time of a twinkle in your eye,—could it be said to move at all?—Surely not.—When the cause of disease therefore is expelled by these great medicines they INSTANTLY compose all strife. I NEVER swallow any wine, spirits, or malt liquor, strong or weak, mixt nor unmixt, and yet I undergo daily with pleasure, cheerfulness and good health, more fatigue of body and of mind, than perhaps any other man in London;—If, after the business of the day, or when I am forced to be up all night when sent for in great emergencies—I find myself faint and exhausted,—I immediately draw the vapour of the electri∣cal aether with great force into my nostrils—or pour a few tea∣spoonfuls of it into a bason of warm water and breathe over it;—and ordering a few new laid eggs to be beat as it were into a thin oil, and then mixed with some sugar and <HI>very</HI> COLD water, I drink it off, and eating a bit of biscuit, rich ripe fruits, or dry bread two days old, I find myself, in a few minutes, perfectly fresh and re∣cruited.
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>But what always astonishes me above measure is, the seem∣ingly miraculous effect of my Electrical Aether, or NERVOUS AETHE∣RIAL BALSAM, of which, when I take a tea-spoonful or two into my mouth upon a bit of sugar, I feel my body refreshed, braced, and strengthened, and my mind enlarged and illuminated, in one moment. It darts its genial aetherial soul with the swiftness of light—or with the inconceivable swiftness above mentioned, through every nerve—vein—artery! I desire to repeat, in other words, what I have already expressed; namely, that if thro' extreme bodily fatigue and anxiety, I feel myself as it were crampt in a cold dark room,—in a moment,—by the means of the electrical aether, and nervous aetherial balsam, I find myself saluted as it were by love,—joy, health and harmony! who in a moment fling open celestial scenes—and smiling, transport me on soft waving wings—with balmy and melodious gales, into the sweet—brilliant, and flowery palace where they, the handmaids of HAPPINESS, reside!—illumi∣nated with ten thousand lights of virgin wax!—or warmed and gilded with a vernal—a meridian sun! But to descend from the re∣gions of metaphor.</P>
<P>These wonderful and most genial medicines attune the body, and thro' it the mind;—or, rather, the mind and the body freed from discord and disease, recover, by their own energy, their natural and original healthy tone and brilliancy:—And this happy state at∣tained—every thing which surrounds us appears likewise pleasant, gay and harmonious. Like, as in musical instruments tuned in uni∣son, every chord which is touched, strikes and calls forth, by its own vibratory force alone, a corresponding musical tone from every octave in the other instruments in the same room, thus invisibly touched. These are facts perfectly well known to philosophers, and to those who have studied music as a science. But to return; I say, that upon the grounds of reason and common sense, it is no wonder that these medi∣cines, when judiciously applied, are so efficacious as to remove all dis∣orders that arise from the jarrings and disproportions of the constituent parts or qualities in human bodies—because these medicines are a∣dapted, and accommodate themselves to all, and health ensues in the most easy, simple, and natural manner. The wise and sacred writer says, "That God hath created medicines out of the earth, and that he who is wise will not despise them."—Now as the qualities or virtues of all roots, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds,—and of every medi∣cinal substance in nature, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, must undoubtedly reside in some little drops—some exquisitely small particles of ONE <HI>prima materia!</HI> which is the fountain or centre of existence, life and health—and as this fountain—or source—or
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>centre, is to be found alone by the gift of God; or, in other words, by his blessing on the reverential and assiduous labours and investiga∣tions of those who search unweariedly into the vast treasures of na∣ture, with a view of promoting the good and happiness of the world, and the honour and glory of God!—Whenever therefore, we can extract and concentrate from the adventitious, gross, or inactive parts—the balmy, simple, homogeneous and vivisying particles of substances truly medicinal, by means of the harmonious combination of the great universal principles of air, aether, magnetism, electricity, and solar light, we need look for no other medicines; and I defy any physician to mention an indication in the cure of any disease, whether by altering, attenuating, opening, purifying, sweating, purging, vo∣miting, passing off by the kidnies; or by taking off spasms and irri∣tations—by bracing and comforting the nerves,—or by strength∣ening and vivifying the whole system, but may be answered in the completest and most friendly manner, by the judicious modulations and exhibitions of these three great medicines. They will therefore, upon principles perfectly demonstrable, cure all curable diseases, gladden the heart, illuminate the mind, and prolong human exist∣ence to the longest possible period. Because this exact mixture of hot and cold, moist and dry,—this harmonious tempering of the primary vital elements, coalescing like chords in music, must be peace makers in the strife or disorders of the constituent parts and qualities of man's body;—and because the true quintessence of na∣ture is Fire. I don't mean the gross, impure, consuming, culinary fire which we have every day before us in the world: by no means. The fire which I employ in the cure of diseases, and in the preparation of those three great medicines, is the true elementary fire, which has been worshipped as it were by the philosophers of all ages. They <HI>had</HI> glimpses of it; and even its dawn gleaming on their horizon filled them with ideas so vast and sublime! that the herd of the world called them mad enthusiasts. How much greater felicity must <HI>we</HI> enjoy, upon whom the sun of science shines so bright as at this day. How much more may <HI>we</HI> benefit and enlighten the human species! But still, the sun just alluded to, is far—very—very far from having at∣tained its meridian altitude It even now points, but at six o'clock of a summer morning. Yet how fast—how sweetly—do the buds of every branch of science open!—The birds sing—ALL NATURE RE∣JOICES! But those charming fields—these delightful prospects tempt me to wander too far. I will return. The fire I say which I employ in the cure of diseases, and for the preparation of these great medi∣cines, is the universal living fire which connects and moves the whole solar system—which animates all nature, and which you, my cour∣teous
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>reader—this book, the chair you sit in, the charming object by your side, and in a word, every thing in the universe is full of; and which we can now in a moment extract, and make visible or per∣ceptable to <HI>all</HI> your five senses. This fire is the breath of life—the spi∣rit of God!—which he breathed at the creation into man's nostrils, and which gives and maintains life throughout all his other works!—IT IS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION! the fire which quickens the embryo in the womb!—even the pure fluid, celestial, electri∣cal fire which pervades, purges, and animates ALL NATURE! con∣suming disease and corruption—attracting and uniting the four ele∣ments—without destroying their variety or distinct powers,—because it is itself a composition of them all—the joy of them all—and in a word the great band or material soul of the universe!</P>
<P>THIS, <HI>then,</HI> is the natural—the celestial quintessence or instuence with which those three great medicines are impregnated—and with which they are replete:—even with the harmonious combination of the four elementary qualities in ONE;—and whenever this pure and simple light, or concord is received into the body—disease and dis∣cord <HI>must</HI> vanish, as the cold and darkness of the night must vanish at the presence of the morning—of the summer's sun!—and I will now conclude this short and very imperfect account of my great medicines with assuring those sick and infirm persons who have not yet had the happiness to partake of their salutary influences,—that they are in their nature and operations, easy and benign,—genial and gentle as a dove—strengthening and exhilirating the soul and body of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those who <HI>will</HI> have the soul to be IMMATERIAL; will be perhaps highly offended at my bringing it in upon every occasion, head and shoulders with the body. The reason is, because I can no way succeed in separating them. We all know that light, though supremely pure, and infinitely subtil—is neverthe∣less material: and I agree so far with the generality of the world, as to consider the human soul as a substance (or emanation in consequence of the exquisite or∣ganization of our body)—so exquisitely—so supremely pure and subtilias to be absolutely invisible and inconceivable to any or all of our senses. I find that the materiality or nature of the soul is <HI>now</HI> a point bitterly disputed by philoso∣phors. For my own part, I profess that I know nothing at all about the matter. I know, however, that it is a point which we have no sort of business with;—and as, to <HI>this,</HI> and all other matters which ARE NOT ESSENTIAL to our hap∣piness in this, or in any other state of existence—and which <HI>cannot possibly be settled</HI> in this world—I think we had better be easy, and not quarrel—wrangle—and disturb one another about such abstruse, metaphysical, and I may say, nonsensi∣cal, matters. Thus I have in three words, written all that I ever intend to write upon this subject.</NOTE> those to whom they are thankfully and prudently administered:—whilst at the same time they are as strong and as furious as lions in subduing and evacuating diseases, and every thing
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>that is injurious or unfriendly to good health, or to human existence. But the strength above alluded to, is the strength of a protector—and the fury, that of love!—because they hurt not the weakest or most delicate, in infancy or in old age:—to the former they are as milk and honey—to the latter, as generous wine, or the smoothest—the sweetest oil!—and to pursue the metaphor, they are in the last stages, of most severe and fatal diseases, what fresh oil is to an ex∣piring lamp—when the flame is, like a sickly shadow quivering and gasping in the dry socket.</P>
<P>These great medicincs which are sold at no other place in London or Westminster but at the TEMPLE OF HEATH! ADELPHI, and at the TEMPLE OF HYMEN, in PALL-MALL, are care∣fully put up and secured in strong flint vials:—even the Imperial Pills—because they would immediately lose their virtue if kept in a pill-box—or exposed to the open air. The three medicines are all sold at the same price, viz.—in vials of five Shillings, Half a Guinea, and One Guinea each.—For the conveniency of the navy and ar∣my,—of the commanders of East and West-India ships—and of la∣dies and gentlemen travelling by sea or land, proper assortments of <HI>all the three</HI> medicines, are put up in mahogany cabinets of Five, Ten, and Twenty-Five Guineas—with very ample, directions. By which means not only much money to physicians, apothecaries, &amp;c. may be saved, but likewise under God, the lives of many hun∣dred persons of worth, fashion and of fortune, who travel into fo∣reign countries—may be yearly preserved,—who, otherwise, might be swept off by diseases in a few days—when absent from their fa∣milies, and far distant from their affectionate friends.</P>
<P>Proper allowance is made to merchants and captains of ships who buy them in large quantities for sale in foreign countries. In all <HI>fe∣vers</HI> and RELAXATIONS—and in BILIOU, spasmodic putrid malig∣nant and consumptive complaints, in the East and West-Indies, and in America—they are immediate and absolute specifics. So that any lady or gentleman of sense and liberality, may, THUS ASSISTED, become sovereign physicians, and often save not only their own, but the life of a friend or of a fellow creature, when apparently at the point of death—and when given over by even the best physicians. But above all, they are most earnestly recommended to people of weak nerves and relaxed habits—who are particularly susceptible of catching colds and infectious disorders—to those likewise who are apprehensive of strokes of the apoplexy or pally—and still more, es∣pecially to those under sentence of death—I mean those persons who have already been visited by those sudden—dreadful—and merciless harbingers of the awful—the tremendous hour!</P>
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
<P>⁂ Any respectable person, <HI>not of the faculty,</HI> in any capital city or town in Great-Britain or Ireland—or in any other part of the world, where these great medicines are not yet established,—and who are very desirous to vend them, ought to lose no time in apply∣ing to me, thro' their agents or correspondents in London. As ready money is expected, a proper allowance is made; but all ex∣pences of carriage, advertizing, &amp;c.—must be defrayed by the per∣sons themselves; and it is an invariable rule with me to return im∣mediately the money for what ever quantity may at any time be sent back as unsold.—In order to prevent trouble, I think it right to be very particular in mentioning the terms or conditions upon which I dispense these medicines all over the globe, for the general good of mankind, as well as for my own honour and emolument.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR USING MY THREE GREAT MEDICINES.</HEAD>
<P>THE principles or constituent parts of these Medicines being si∣milar—they are found to produce the best effects and the greatest and most extraordinary cures, when taken together, or as∣sisted by each other. But in all cases whatever, I desire that those who take them, do not regard <HI>my</HI> directions, so much as the effects of the medicines,—their own feelings; and their own prudence and good sense. In <HI>acute</HI> cases they can scarcely be used too plentifully; but in dangerous and long confirmed <HI>chronic</HI> cases—they may be used more sparingly, and continued longer. But, after a course of six weeks, if a complete cure be not obtained, they should be discon∣tinued for three, six, or nine weeks, and then resumed again as for∣merly. In all cases and constitutions, in all habits of body, at every period of life, and under perhaps every circumstance, cool air, drinking cold water plentifully, and bathing the whole body, or at least the private parts with tepid or icy cold water, agrees perfectly well, and produces the happiest and most Divine Effects.</P>
<P>Let, therefore, my innumerable Tribes of Patients, I mean all who are taking my medicines, be almost constantly bustling about in the cool open air, regardless of wind or rain; let them be daily, and very frequently applying cold water to their face, neck, bosom, stomach, private parts, and limbs; in short, the partial or universal application of cold water to the surface of the body I earnestly and most cordially
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>recommend: but still more earnestly, and above all things do I exhort to moderation, simplicity and regularity in eating, drinking and sleep∣ing, and in all pleasureable indulgences; in those especially <HI>(venereal)</HI> which drain the blood of its most precious balsam, and the nerves of their vital spirits; sapping the sources of health, and totally incapaci∣tating both soul and body from the proper performance of their na∣tural, necessary, and more noble functions,—and from enjoying with a keen healthy relish, the balmy—the celestial pleasures—which the all-wise and supremely beneficent Author of our existence hath annexed to our animal, as well as to our intellectual nature!</P>
<P>As to the ELECTRICAL AETHER, the manner of using it has been already pretty well explained in the account which is given of its nature, preparation, and properties. In all cases of weakness, fainting, putrifaction and debility, especially in asthmas, consump∣tions, and all painful obstructions of the head or breast, it may be smelled to for several minutes and very often. The vial should be held in a warm hand to the patient's nostril, and the other stopped by pressing it sideways with the finger, while the cold vapour is drawn up with great force. It should not be taken away from the nose notwithstanding its strength; for the longer the patient smells at it, the better able he is, for his breath becomes longer, and he seems to enter delighted into the flowery fields of Elysium!—Often, very often have I exhausted a whole bottle in one day, or evening, merely by smelling. A little of it may be poured into a pot or bason of warm or hot water, brandy and water, green tea, coffee, or into an infusion of aromatic herbs,—flowers, or seeds—especially a mix∣ture of mint, rosemary, lavender flowers, and bruised anniseeds; over which the patient's hands and mouth open may be held, while it continues warm, drawing the vapor with great force into the lungs. In some cases it may be advisable to fling a large piece of flannel loosely over the patient's head, which will more effectually promote perspira∣tion. Any of the above, especially the latter aromatics, may be used afterwards, when almost cold, to bathe the stomach, private parts, limbs, or feet. The Electrical Aether <HI>alone</HI> may be poured plentifully on the head, breast, back-bone or limbs of a person in any low—nerv∣ous—or putrid complaint: This Aether, camphorated spirits, or vinegar, may be made to distil by a lamp, or be scattered about the room and bed cloaths—I have often used half a dozen guinea bottles of it in one day, on and about one person, when the case has been very bad, and the life very dear and precious. It may be taken inwardly in the quantity of a tea-spoonful, more or less, and as often as may be found good, perhaps every hour or two, on sugar, or mixed with the syrup of capillaire, cold water, wine, or herb tea. The thicker and colder the vehicle, the better: the syrup, or icy cold vehicle should be poured into an empty vial, then the Aether added to it,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>perhaps by guess, then closely stopped with the thumb or a cork, well shaken and drank immediately.</P>
<P>In the very same manner, in similar quantities, and at any or at all times, may be taken the NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM. Indeed, they may be taken together at the same time; or the latter taken inwardly, while the Electrical Aether is smelled to, or applied outwardly; for the one tempers and co-operates with, and promotes the good effects of the other, in so cordial, friendly, and effectual a manner, that they act like a PAIR of crutches to a crippled and en∣feebled body. For a more full and particular account of the nature properties, &amp;c. of this Divine Balsam—or restorative Aetherial Oil, which so effectually renovates and invigorates decayed and worn out constitutions, I refer my intelligent reader to the descriptions already given.</P>
<P>As to the IMPERIAL PILLS, or universal purifiers and sweetners of the blood and juices; they may be taken conveniently at any season, and under any circumstance. When they are taken as an alterative, in costive, gouty, bilious, and scorbutic habits, or to throw off wind and flatulencies from the stomach and bowels in nervous weaknesses, spasms, and relaxations, one may be taken every night, or immediately after eating, when a person is oppressed and uneasy, because they so amazingly promote lively digestion and healthy nourishment, blunting all acid and bilious acrimony, strengthening the relaxed tone of the stomach, and increasing the peristaltic or screw-like motion of the intestines: but when they are taken to subdue, eradicate, and expel by stool, urine, and a fine breathing perspiration all venereal, scorbutic, gouty, rheuma∣tic, bilious and scrophulous humours and foulnesses, the patient may begin with one pill, and increase the dose one every night, till they begin to produce a more copious discharge by stool, urine, or sweat, than the patient can or ought to bear long. In such cases, the patient may diminish the number, one every night, till he comes to one only, and then after totally omitting them for as many days as in number he had taken the pills in one day, he may begin again, increasing the number, one every night as at first.—This mode being observed, and repeated several times,—will most assuredly—will infallibly eradicate every particle of virus, disease and impurity, however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the system, or however inveterately they have been blended and rooted in the constitution, sapping or undermining the springs and sources of life and of health, rendering life a tire∣some and painful burthen to the feeble, spiritless, wretched pos∣sessor. It is really astonishing how speedily and effectually these pills counteract and carry off the deadly effects of Mercury, and other strong and improper medicines. This important and singular qua∣lity
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>and effects are produced by the large portion of electrical sul∣phur or celestial phosphorous which they contain.</P>
<P>While a person takes these most excellent pills they may drink as much cold water as they please, or go out in any weather. The following drinks will likewise be very proper,—chicken, veal, or mutton broth, without salt. Beef-tea, capillaire and cold water. Infusions of simple herbs, &amp;c. but when the pills are taken for severe and confirmed diseases, proper regard should be paid to the nature and degree of the disorder or complaint, and the drinks, management, &amp;c.—ordered accordingly. For instance, in the ve∣nereal, scorbutic, or scrophulous diseases, a strong decoction of sarsaparilla, or of the guaiacum and sassafras woods, with plenty of li∣quorice root, should be drank daily. In gouty, bilious, asthmatic, consumptive, and rheumatic cases, infusions of baum, rosemary, tansey, horseradish root, chamomile flowers, pennyroyal, hysop, groundivy, horehound, linseeds, liquorice root, with bruised fennil or aniseeds, sweetened with treacle, honey, sugar candy, or barley sugar, will be found extremely serviceable; and in all nervous and windy complaints, and in relaxation, irritation and debility of the system in general, strong decoctions or rather infusions of the Peru∣vian Bark, in gross powder, columbo or comfry roots, red rose leaves, chamomile flowers, bitter orange peel, with a little bruised cinnamon—will be productive of the happiest and most astonishing good effects. But in every case, and in every constitution, when any one, or all of my Three Great Medicines are taken, I have found half a pint or a whole one of apple tea, water gruel, barley water, or of the following compound infusion, extremely good and agreeable, viz. of baum, sage, rosemary, mint, and bruised aniseeds—each an equal quantity, and the tea sweetened with sugar candy, barley sugar—treacle or honey; or rather with a mixture of the two last. This tea or infusion should be drank warm, and indeed very warm and often, when any consi∣derable degree of perspiration is wished for or intended.</P>
<P>In the intervals between taking the medicines, and indeed, in most constitutions, even at the time of taking them, a milk diet is warmly recommended. A quart or two, or even three quarts of good new milk may be used every day, not warm from the cow, or boiled, but cold, and as it is called, raw: for the natural heat of the human stomach is fully sufficient to cook, or prepare milk, eggs, &amp;c. for every purpose of nutrition, and of health. The pre∣vious application of fire renders them hard and indigestible—Many people lose the great—the unspeakable—the balmy benefit of a milk diet, by relinquishing it too soon. They find the first day or two, a ful∣ness or sickness at their stomach—a griping or laxity of their bowels, they therefore conclude that it disagrees with them, and they leave it off. But they ought to continue it by all means for a week or ten
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>days, and at length it would in general be found to agree per∣fectly well, and to produce the happiest effects.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without taking notice of the general odium there is against a panacea, or medicine for the cure of <HI>all</HI> diseases. At first I was very far from expecting that even these three medicines could, singly, or when combined, cure or even relieve all disorders; but as I advanced in improving them, and in discovering their virtues in actual and most extensive practice, I confess that my wonder and surprise exceeded the astonishment and delight which was excited in my happy patients. The wonderful good effects which I say are produced by these medicines in every case, and in every constitution, will, <HI>at first sight,</HI> alarm and disgust persons of sense and learning, but on candid and mature views of these matters, they will be found to agree with, and to result from the fixt nature of things:—for the general notion of diseases reasonably consists in this; that what is taken into the body is not duly assimilated and distributed by the force of the animal oeconomy. Is it not, therefore, true that what∣ever assists and strengthens the vis vitae, enables nature either to assimilate, or to discharge all gross and noxious particles, unsubdued humours, and in a word, the seeds or causes of all diseases whatsoever? for the celestial or electrical Light or Aether detained in these me∣dicines, and with which they are so fully impregnated or saturated, being of the very same nature with the animal spirits, or nervous clastic light or fluid, is an accession of so much strength to the con∣stitution or powers of nature, or staff of life, by which it is assisted to assimilate whatever is friendly and nourishing, or to throw off or ex∣pel whatever is alien or noxious to her nature,—or prejudicial to good health. Thus, then, these great medicines may be justly called universal ones, inasmuch as they work principally by assisting the vis vitae, or staff of life, as an alterative and cordial, enabling nature by a prodigious accession of congenial vital spirits, to assimilate those friendly and necessary recruits or powers, which could not be assimilated by her own proper force, for subduing diseases or maintain∣ing health. Those who think that this cannot be effectually done but by strong evacuations, entertain a most dangerous opinion; for great and repeated evacuations weaken <HI>nature</HI> as well as the disease; and thousands who have recovered of distempers by great evacuations, and poisonous medicines, such as mercury, &amp;c. have never, during their whole life, been able to recover of the remedies.—But the luminous—balmy—celestial spirit or fire which is lodged and detained in these three Great Medicines, is of a nature so mild, benign, and propor∣tioned to the human constitution, as to warm without heating, to cheer but not inebriate or inflame, and to produce that calm serenity, that steady joy which naturally accompanies good health, and a virtuous mind:—and that too without those agitations, irregular motions, and subsequent horrible sinkings or depressions of the
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>animal spirits, which are the constant and inseparable effects of volatile salts, spirits, foreign waters, and drams; and indeed of all fermented, vinous, spiritous, and even malt-liquors.</P>
<P>N. B. These great,—these truly celestial medicines, will keep good any length of time, and in any climate, provided they are kept very tightly stopped and as cool as possible.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂} In a few days will be published and added to this pamphlet, about fifty extraordinary cures, lately effected by my three great medicines. In the mean time I have authority to mention the fol∣lowing very extraordinary case of a respectable and very amiable young lady, a Miss Beatt, at Mr. Schroeder's Ware-House, (Robe and Habit-Maker to Her Majesty) in Tavistock-Street, Covent∣Garden,—late Pritchard and Spilsbury's.</P>
<P>About the beginning of last March, Miss Beatt was seized with a severe disorder which broke out on one side of her face, and spread to her eye, ear, neck, and throat. It was taken, and properly at∣tended to, from the very beginning; but, nevertheless in two or three weeks it had spread over both sides of her face and neck, which with both her eyes and ears, it had swelled to a monstrous degree. The humour was so sharp and so excessively profuse, that day and night it would wet and run thro' twenty folds of cloths or handkerchiefs in one quarter of an hour, but notwithstanding that incredible discharge the swellings did not abate, and those under her ear, and about her throat, were as hard as a stone. The catastrophe of the scene being now at hand, and the young Lady herself, her affectionate father, and her anxious friends, being alarmed and apprehensive of the most fatal consequences—the services of the Medical Gentlemen who attended her were dispensed with, and I was called in. The chilly shivering coldness, which indeed had been a most unfavourable symptom from the beginning, encreased, now, very fast.—The terrible humour began to fall inward, and to be absorbed into her blood, which it dissolved and broke down into a putrid watery gore; and on the Sunday morning I found her laying with scarce any pulse—cold, sleepy like, complaining that she could not swallow, and of a dead coldness in her limbs, on her left side particularly,—and a want of smell and all sense of feeling in one side of her nose. Her face, neck, eyes and ears were entirely co∣vered over with a thick black cold crust or scab—like a complete mask,—she had been quite blind for near two days, and on examining her throat inwardly, I found the mortification there far advanced. From these symptoms and appearances, joined to what is called the
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>rattles in her throat, which had now come on, and the putrid smell which, notwithstanding every precaution, began to spread all over the house, every body was persuaded that the melancholy scene would be closed in a very few hours; and I myself was apprehensive that the deadly sweep in the house might be great; a gentleman, a few streets off, his wife, and some of their children and servants having been all swept into the grave by a putrid disorder within the space of one week, a few days before:—to whom I regret exceedingly, that I had not the good fortune to be called. But to return. What was to be done?—Miss Beatt could not swallow but a few drops at a time, and that very slowly, and with the greatest languor and danger of suffocation.</P>
<P>No time was to be lost with the patient, nor any thing left undone for the security of the family. Every window in the house, which Mrs Schroeder had very judiciously thrown open, and the frankin∣cense and other aromatics which that lady had wisely burned on the stairs, by way of fumigation, were, (with the addition of camphorated aether to sprinkle with) all continued.</P>
<P>I immediately mixed a large vial of my NERVOUS AETHERIAL BALSAM, and another of my ELECTRICAL AETHER, with an equal quantity of the syrup of capillaire to soften them.—Of this mixture, I gave Miss Beatt spoonful after spoonful, as fast as she could let it over, till she had taken the whole of it. That part of it which run out of her mouth was not lost; for it was absorbed by her neck and breast.</P>
<P>In the course of a quarter of an hour, I used no less than three whole vials of my ELECTRICAL AETHER on her face, neck, throat, &amp;c.—Another very large vial, containing four ounces or one Guinea's worth of it, was held continually to her nostrils, and some of it a little diluted, was thrown into her nostrils, and upon her throat in∣wardly, with a syringe; and an infusion with boiling water was im∣mediately prepared, of half a pound of the finest Peruvian bark, and an ounce of cinnamon, both in powder, and half a pound of red rose leaves.—To this, when strained, no less than half a pint of Mr. Jones's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jones, who is a chymist and druggist in Russel Street, Covent Garden, is a man of fortune and character, and particularly attentive in having the best and most genuine medicines that can be procured.</NOTE> very excellent tincture of the bark, was added. This was exhibited very often by way of glyster, and a cupful of it drank as often as possible. But before it could be prepared, I had given Miss Beatt another whole large vial of my nervous aetherial balsam, and had sprinkled the bed∣cloaths well, all over, with my electrical aether—a large blister like∣wise was applied between her shoulders, and one <HI>under</HI> each collar bone,
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>backward, towards the top of her shoulders. What were the effects of these bold—these great operations?—They were most happy!—They appeared miraculous!—They snatched an amiable young person—an useful member of society—I may say, from the very bottom of the grave. What would ordinary medicines—what would, what is called the <HI>regular</HI> practice, have done in this desperate case?—why—nothing. The patient MUST INEVITABLY HAVE DIED. How very fortunate it was for Miss Beatt that I was personally present to direct the proper exhibition of the three great medicines—to which under God! she owes her life! In a quarter of an hour, from the time that the aetherial balsam was <HI>first</HI> given to her,—she broke out into a general perspiration; her pulse was better;—the fulness, choaking, and inability of swallowing went off; the rattles ceased. At the end of another half hour, all these favourable appearances were more strikingly manifested:—and at the expiration of one hour more, so rapidly did the cold numbness and sleepiness go off, and the mor∣tification, and putrefaction abate, that I conceived her to be even out of all danger. The putrid morbid matter which had fallen inward, and carried death to every vessel and fibre of the system being now so much overcome and subdued by the nervous aetherial balsam, and electrical aether, I was determined to lose no time in carrying as much of it as possible out of the body. For that purpose, as Miss Beatt could not be supposed to be as yet capable of swallowing <HI>pills</HI>—and even if she could, it would have been a considerable time before they could have dissolved in her stomach: I therefore dissolved nine of my IMPERIAL PILLS in a proper vehicle, and gave the whole of them to her in the space of an hour. The consequence was, that they operated so properly and effectually, that I ventured to leave her that same night, being called into the city to attend to some cases of great importance.</P>
<P>I had ordered my servant to enquire after Miss Beatt by six in the morning, and a gentleman, (a surgeon in the East-India Company's service) who had the goodness to sit up all night, being on a visit at Mr. Schroeder's, (and to whose kind and judicious care we were all very much indebted,) sent me word that Miss Beatt was amazingly better, that she had slept sweetly great part of the night, that she was then refreshed and cheerful, with both her eyes quite open, and every unfavourable symptom entirely gone off.</P>
<P>I shall not trespass any longer on my reader's time; suffice it to assure him, that by continuing the medicines, &amp;c. in one week or ten days more Miss Beatt came down stairs quite recovered. The black crusty scabs or mask dropt off her face, neck, head, throat and eats en∣tirely; she was once more perfectly herself,—and free from every spot, redness, or disagteeable appearance—and with a good appetite, and high spirits, she has continued perfectly well ever since; and thinks
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>that she even enjoys better health than she did before she was attacked with that terrible disorder:—and, it pleased God, that not one individual of that large and respectable family suffered an hour's illness from the imminent danger which had threatened them.</P>
<P>N. B. Very few of the fifty cures lately performed by these medi∣cines, which have been selected from a much greater number, and which are now printing, are less extraordinary or important than this above-mentioned.</P>

<P>THE TEMPLE OF HEALTH! IN LONDON, IS OPEN FOR THE RECEPTION OF PATIENTS, AND FOR THE DISPENSATION OF The Three Great Medicines therein prepared, Every Day (Sundays excepted) from Eight in the Morning, till Eight at Night.</P>
<P>The MEDICO-ELECTRICAL APPARATUS, In the Temple of Health, is allowed by every Body to be by far the largest and most stupendous, most useful, and most magnificent that now is, or that ever was, in the World. It occupies TEN ROOMS, and has cost several Thousand Pounds. Nature and Art—Univer∣sal Nature—the Fine and the Liberal Arts! have been courted and exerted in the Execution of this great Work. Every Nerve of Genius and of Study has been strained, and the Four Quarters of the Globe ransacked to enrich and embellish it, and to render it one of the most useful of all the Institutions which adorn the Age and Nation we have the happiness to live in.</P>
<P>DR. GRAHAM's new and improved methods of curing diseases consist in regimen, herbs, simple medicines, the choicest arti∣cles of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and aetherial essences, rendered more salu∣tary and active by means of the most powerful vital agents in nature, viz. Electricity, Vivifying Air, Medical Music, and Magnetism; or in other words, by gently conveying to those at the Altar, or on the Medico-electrical Throne, without shock, or any kind of uneasiness,
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>into the general system, to the seat of the disease, or only to parts par∣ticularly affected, the pure, active, genial, balmy, bracing, and restorative effluvia of medicines animal, mineral, or vegetable, simply, or combined with the celestial fire, or vital light, magnetic <HI>Efflu∣vium,</HI> harmonious vibrations, or musical modulations of celestial sounds, or with any of those great primary-elementary vital prin∣ciples, which are the universal <HI>Pabulum,</HI> or vivifying soul of the universe! The great numbers who daily, by these means, under God! are cured of the most dangerous and most confirmed diseases, after they have been turned incurable out of hospitals, and given over by even the most celebrated Physicians, <HI>who</HI> STAND <HI>in the regular medical trammels</HI> are really astonishing. Dr. Graham. therefore, for the public good, as well as for his own honour and emolument, THINKS IT HIS DUTY to depart from what is called the regular mode, by giving this public notice, which is addressed to THE FRIENDS OF PERSONS APPARENTLY AT THE POINT OF DEATH, and to every individual who labours under any kind of complaint or infirmity which has resisted the ordinary remedies.—To such, in whatever station of life, this Advertisement is addressed; but more especially to the charitably disposed Christian—to the affectionate Parent—the dutiful Child—the fond Compannion—and the tender—the anxious Friend.</P>
<P>The cases which Dr. Graham has been the most remarkably successful in curing, are the following:—viz. Violently dangerous Fevers, particularly scarlet, putrid, and nervous ones—Consump∣tions, Asthmas and Coughs — excruciating pain and imminent danger from the Gout in the head or stomach—Apoplexy—putrid ulcerated Throats—Stone and Gravel—inflamations of the Brain, Lungs, Bowels, or Bladder—obstinate and confirmed VENEREAL com∣plaints, from repeated infections and irregularities, or from having been neglected, trifled with, or improperly treated with that deadly poison mercury, severe purging, &amp;c.—Stomach and Bowel complaints—total suppressions of Urine too—relaxing, sinking; weaknessess, and the more immediately dangerous FEMALE COMPLAINTS—Fits, Spasms, and Convulsions, especially in children and young people—the Measles, Small-pox, Mortifications, nervous and con∣sumptive Weaknesses—immoderate Fluxes—severe fits of Coughing, Suffocation or Asthma—acute, bilious, and other Obstructions—the Dropsy, recent strokes of the Palsy, &amp;c. In these, and in most other diseases, particularly in glandular and white Swellings; com∣plicated, severe, and wandering Rheumatisms; the rheumatic Gout; obstinate Scurvies; in Blindness and in Deafness too, and most of the disorders of those most precious and most delicate organs the eye and ear, his medicines, and gentle aetherial and electrical applica∣tions, produce the most amazing good effects: they open obstruc∣tions, promote a due and regular circulation of the blood and spirits,
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>which they sweeten, purify, enrich, and animate; nourishing, bracing, and coiling up the nervous system when weakened and relaxed; overcoming every degree of putrefaction, recruiting decayed strength, and generally acting on an exhausted body like fresh oil poured into an expiring lamp. After all, however, Dr. Graham is far from pretending to work miracles or impossibilities. No: he is abundantly sensible of the impossibility of curing many diseases in their advanced and confirmed stages; and of the fallibility and un∣certainty of all sublunary things; all that he contends for is, that his methods of treating diseases are far more powerful, safe and rational, than those in general employed by any other Physician in the world, and that he often succeeds in curing effectually and lastingly, diseases internal and external, when the most celebrated Surgeons and Physicians, and even when the more friendly powers of regimen, air, exercise, and the best mineral waters have failed.</P>
<P>So amazingly has his business increased, that he has <HI>now</HI> found it necessary, from motives of humanity more than for his own emolu∣ment, to fit up additional appartments, and to receive at any hour of the day such sick and lame Persons as cannot afford to give fees for advice; and that they are now admitted daily, Sundays excepted, from eight o'clock in the morning, till eight at night, to whom advice, and all necessary medico-electrical operations, &amp;c. are administered <HI>gratis,</HI> in rotation, according to priority of arrival, without respect of persons, paying the Apothecary for such medicines only (if any) as their respec∣tive cases require. But as the greatest hindrances have arisen from multitudes crowding into the TEMPLE OF HEALTH, under the pre∣tence of attending sick friends, but merely to gratify their curiosity, by staring at the apparatus, to obviate, therefore, in future, those incon∣veniencies and impertinencies, and that as many diseased persons as possible may partake of the salutary effects of this GRAND SYSTEM OF HEALING! no poor person whatever will be admitted without a ticket, which must be had of the porter, price Half-a-Crown. This is required only at the first consultation; for Dr. Graham, on re∣ceiving it, gives another ticket <HI>gratis,</HI> which admits the patient during the whole course of the cure.—No sort of objection, how∣ever, is made to <HI>one</HI> friend attending each patient—that being often necessary, as well as decent.</P>
<P>The nobility, gentry, and others in genteel or easy circumstances, must pay a Guinea the first consultation, and at least Half a-Guinea every time after. No persons whomsoever, even personages of high rank, need expect to be attended at their own houses, unless confined to bed by sickness, or to their room through extreme weakness; and from those whom he attends at their own houses, Two Guineas the first, and one Guinea each visit after, is expected. Dr. Graham, for reasons of the highest importance to the public, as well as to himself, has a large chemical laboratory, and great medicinal cabinets in his
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>own house; and in the above fixed fees, either at home or abroad, every expence attending his advice, medicines, applications, operations, and influences is included—a few tedious, complex, and expensive operations in the great Apollo apartment only excepted. But in cases where electricity or attendance are not necessary, and medicines are required to be taken at home, or when any are sent into the country, if they are furnished and prepared by Dr. Graham's Chemists, or Apothecaries, they must be paid for separately.</P>
<P>Before he concludes this address, it may not be amiss to say a few words on the dangerous, and even fatal effects which may be pro∣duced by so mighty an agent as the electrical fire, in the hands of ignorant and rash people. So very powerful an element cannot be indifferent when applied to the human body; it must do considerable good or considerable harm; striking instances of both have repeatedly fallen under Dr. Graham's observations;—and he trembles with apprehension for his fellow-creatures, when he sees in almost every street in this great metropolis, a Barber—a Surgeon—a Tooth∣drawer—an Apothecary—or a common Mechanic turned electrical operator. How dangerous!—how ridiculous must it be in most cases to venture so curious, so complex, and so delicate a machine as the human body, and that too, even when diseased, into such hands to be shook, torn, and convulsed with the ignorant and improper application of this awful element!</P>
<P>For his own part, he has been taught by reason, and by the most attentive observations in innumerable experiments on almost every substance in nature, and in a course of practice in the cure of diseases, far more extensive than that of perhaps any other man in the world, he has been taught, that all violence is hurtful; that ELECTRICAL SHOCKS OUGHT SELDOM OR NEVER TO BE GIVEN; that partial frictions, sparks and brushings, with rich me∣dicinal substances charged with electricity, or gently pervading the whole system with a copious tide of that celestial fire, fully impreg∣nated with the purest, most subtile, and balmiest parts of medicines, which are extracted by, and flow softly into the blood and nervous system, with the electrical fluid, or restorative aetherial essences. In those cases where shocks are absolutely necessary, instead of charging bottles lined with tin foil, or other gross, impure, and perhaps ar∣senical metals, his jars are filled with loadstones, sulphur, quicksilver, and with the mildest, yet most active medicinal substances from the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms:—these are charged with the celestial Fire, solar vital Light, vivifying Air, and with the powerful, and salutary <HI>effluvia</HI> of oriental Balsams, aromatic Oils, Peruvian Bark, Castor, Camphire, Musk, Ambergrease, the Balsams of Ju∣niper, Peru, Tolu, and Gilead: and the influences of Electricity▪ Air, aetherial medicines, and magnetism, thus combined, and po∣sitively charged with the pure celestial fire, or with the magnetic,
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>Effluvium, are made to pass through the whole or any particular part of the patient's body, giving, in such cases as require them, a great number or quick succession of pleasant little vibratory SHOCKS, so genial and gentle as not to hurt or alarm even an infant. But, as he said before, he generally prefers the <HI>effluvia</HI> of these genial, aromatic, balsamic, antispasmodic substances, or the <HI>effluvia</HI> of the magnetic, aërial, or aetherial essences, passing silently, sweetly, and insensibly into the body, or confined to the seat or cause of the disease, while the spasmodic tensions and stiffnesses are relaxed—or the relaxed and debilitated tone of the nerves or muscular fibres braced up, or invigorated, as the case or constitution requires, with the above, and with properly adapted harmonious vibrations, or musical modulations of celestial sounds.</P>
<P>Lest it should be thought that Dr. Graham uses electricity in ALL cases, he desires to inform the public, that many of his greatest and most extraordinary cures have been done entirely without the assistance of electricity; and that he makes it an invariable rule to reject the incurable—and to inform every patient, or their friends, at first fight, whether a perfect cure, or what degree of relief may be expected.</P>
<P>Dr. Graham, after a regular, classical, and medical education of many years, at the justly celebrated university of Edinburgh, and after attending to the practice in the best Hospitals, and the lectures of the greatest Physicians in London, Dublin, &amp;c. became exceedingly dissatisfied at the trifling absurdities and feebleness of what is called the regular practice of Physic: but animated with the hopes of being able to make valuable discoveries, and important improvements in the cure of diseases, and for the prolongation of human life, he tra∣velled into various foreign countries, making, in the course of twelve years, several tours thro' the continent of Europe, and over the ex∣tensive provinces of America; at length, after gathering and digesting the falrest flowers and the choicest fruits of the sciences, by convers∣ing with and attending to the labours and the lectures of the most learned and most ingenious men in every country thro' which he passed; after investigating the nature and properties of the various natural productions, and making the most accurate chymical analyses of the most celebrated mineral waters in Europe; he returned to Britain, and after fitting up, with infinite labour and expence, the most powerful, most useful, and most magnificent medical apparatus that ever was in the world, he has now practised a whole year in the metropolis of his native country, and of the world! with the greatest honour and emolument to himself, and to the greatest benefit and ad∣vantage of thousands of his fellow creatures of every rank and deno∣mination, who had laboured under pains and diseases which the best regular practitioners, and the most powerful medicines in common use; could neither cure nor alleviate.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
<P>The same and emoluments which Dr. Graham in consequence of his successes in the cure of diseases, is honoured with, have long since placed him in a sphere which is an object of envy to the selfish and narrow-minded part of the faculty; but which neither the envy, jea∣lous and mean artifices, nor the illiberal, false, and wicked representa∣tions, insinuations, and libels of theatrical buffoons or of rascally avaricious editors of news papers have been able to remove him from. Let them continue to act—to print, and to publish whatever their avaricious and diabolical nature prompts them to. Dr. Graham ne∣ver has, nor ever will take the least notice, or answer one of them. No; He looks down upon them all with smiles of sovereign—of in∣effible contempt!—What!—shall the genial—the life-giving Sun cease to shine because his beams offend the weak or distorted eyes of those foul animals—those vile, venomous reptiles which assassinate and devour in the dark?—Dr. G. has, at least, the negative conso∣lation, that those villainous and lying representers of things which con∣cern him, cannot treat HIM worse than they have done his betters.—even the FIRST, most respectable, most innocent, and even the most sacred characters in the British Dominions. The liberal and discerning public can readily distinguish true merit from pretended knowledge.—Facts are incontrovertible—his superiority is univer∣sally acknowleged. He basks in the sunshine of riches and honour. He rejoices in the applause of the candid and of the learned world—he exults in the testimony of his own conscience,—and in the approbation of his own heart!</P>
<P>But, in order to remove <HI>effectually</HI> every unfavourable impression which the jealous and envious insinuations of the faculty or their friends, ALARMED AT DR. GRAHAM'S UNPRECEDENTED FAME AND SUCCESS, may have created in the minds of those who are unacquainted with Dr. Graham and his valuable discoveries and improvements; and to demonstrate to the world at large the infinite superiority of his peculiar modes of treating diseases, he will continue for another year, to attend at their own home, patients in severe ACUTE diseases, when given over for death by any other, even by the most celebrated Apothecary, Surgeon, or Physician, without any expence whatever, either for attendance, advice, or medicines, <HI>(the first fee only excepted)</HI> if his endeavours to preserve life, under God! prove ineffectual. When restored to health his gratuity shall, as usual, be regulated by the generosity or circumstances of the patient, <HI>No ordinary or trifling case will be attended to:</HI> THE ABOVE IS CONFINED TO THOSE—AND TO THOSE ALONE, WHO ARE THOUGHT TO BE NEAR DEATH IN SEVERE ACUTE DIS∣EASES. Seldom, <HI>very seldom</HI> a day passes, but he has the blessedness of easing excruciating pain, and of snatching from the grave one or more sick persons, even when struggling in the agonies of death, and even after they have been abandoned by the the most celebrated
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>Physicians. Indeed, so very amazing, so unprecedented has been the success which has attended his practice, that not more than three or four persons have died in the whole course or circuit of his practice during the last twelve months—of the multitudes who come or are brought every day to his house—or of those whom he has been sent for to attend, when near death, at their own habitations. While he assures the public of the above fact, he defies the whole world to disprove the truth of it. Such suecess is an honour of which few other Physicians can boast—a pleasure which very few have experienced:—Nor, than the above, can any thing so effectually demonstrate the infinite superiority of his methods of treating diseases, especially as it is well known, that for several years past he seldom has had less than one hundred persons every day under his care, and often more than even double that number. He may, therefore, with the Poet exclaim!</P>

<P>Printed for ALMON, Piccadilly; BECKET, Adelphi; and RICHARDSON and URQUHART, under the Royal Exchange; Price <HI>only</HI> 3 s. 6 d. though it contains as much matter (reading) as a modern Guinea Quarto.</P>
<P>This Book is sold, likewise, at the TEMPLE in the Adelphi; but as the sale of it is no sort of object, Dr. Graham has given orders for his porter to return the money to those who, having read the book, choose to return it. But this is not meant to extend to those books which have been given away, or to those sold by the Booksellers.</P>

Dr. GRAHAM's</HI> Private Medical Advice to Married Ladies and Gentlemen—to those especially who are not blessed with Children—to be had as usual, sealed up, Price One Guinea, alone at the <HI>TEMPLE OF HEALTH</HI> in the Adelphi, and at the <HI>TEMPLE OF HYMEN,</HI> in Pall-Mall, near the King's Palace!—At the same places may be had the Divine Balsam, for the removal of the watery weakness in men, and barrenness in women, Price One Guinea the vial, with directions.</HEAD>
<P>In which such plain, simple, natural, and effectual means for removing the Causes of Barrenness in both sexes, as never before were recommended, or even, perhaps, thought of, in any age or nation, are pointed out. Containing, likewise, prescriptions and directions for a speedy and perfect recovery after severe mis∣carriages and lyings-in—for recruiting and renovating decayed and worn-out constitutions—for fanning and blowing up the smallest sparks of virility—or even the expiring embers of the vital generative powers in either sex, into a genial and pro∣lific flame;—and, in a word, for enjoying juvenile strength and feelings under the controul of wisdom and the Divine Influences of mental happiness, serenity, and peace. The whole interspersed with such precepts and directions as will, if duly attended to, make man and wife <HI>sweeter,</HI> LOVELIER, and
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>MORE DESIRABLE in the eyes of each other—the lady speedily becoming a healthy and happy mother!—and if na∣turally healthy, well formed and disposed —a snowy rock of HEALTH, studded with roses, and streaked with celestial blue! The whole comprized and printed in eight large folio pages.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂} If any lady or gentleman, who sends for the above, after perusing it, and paying that attention to it which the high im∣portance of the subject demands, calls upon Dr. Graham, and declares that they have found no benefit, and that the advices are not worth the Guinea, he will not only return the Guinea, but even Ten more, if the party desires it.</P>
<P>☞ The CELESTIAL BRILLIANCY of the Medico-elec∣trical Apparatus, in the TEMPLE of HEALTH, Adelphi, will be exhibited every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening, exactly at eight o'clock, by Dr. GRAHAM himself, who will have the honour of explaining to the nobility, gentry, and to persons of learning and of taste, the true nature and effects of electricity, air, and magnetism, when applied to the hu∣man body. In this lecture the whole art of preventing diseases, and of living with honour and happiness in this world at least fourscore or a hundred years, is pointed out, and inculcated. Admittance 5 s.</P>
<P>This apparatus which visibly displays, as it were, the various faculties of the material soul of universal and eternal nature, is acknowledged by all, who have seen it, to be by far the largest, most useful, and most magnificent that now is, or that ever was in the world; and it may be inspected every day, from eight o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon. Admittance, 2 s. 6 d.</P>
<P>VESTINA! the rosy GODDESS OF HEALTH! presides at the Evening Lecture, assisting in the display of the celestial me∣teors,— and of that sacred vital Fire, over which she watches, and whose application in the cure of diseases, she daily has the honour of directing. The descriptive exhibition of the apparatus in the day time, is conducted by the officiating <HI>junior</HI> Priest.</P>
<P>Dr. Graham, ever happy and highly flattered with the honour of having the learned and polite to examine his Medico-electrical Apparatus, is hurt and mortified to the extremest degree at order∣ing the tickets of admission to be now sold as above, but the mul∣titudes of people, of every rank and station, who croud constantly, to see it, were so inconvenient to his bufiness, that he was com∣pelled to adopt the above in order that he might be less inter∣rupted in attending to the cases of those who apply to him on account of their health, the number of whom (recommended by the great numbers who are cured, it is well known) often exceeds Two Hundred, daily.</P>

<P>The following Ode, which was set to Music, and performed in the Great Apollo Apartment at the solemn Dedication of the TEMPLE OF HEALTH, on the Organ, the Harmonica, and the Celestina, accompanied with Flutes, Clarionets, and by some of the finest vocal Performers, gives so sweet an Idea of the gentle.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS this great system of Healing, and of encreafing the number and happiness of the human species, which I have with so much labor and expence explored, and now happily confirmed, is of the highest importance, not only to the inhabitants of the British empire at present, but likewise to the whole human species throughout the whole earth, and perhaps for thousands of years to come, I propose to continue to practise in this great metropolis of my native country, till the beginning of the year 1783—which will be a period of full three years—in order to demon∣strate to the entire satisfaction of persons of every rank, from the throne to the cottage, the facility, certainty, and, in a word, the infinite superiority of my methods of propagation in difficult cases, of preventing and curing all curable diseases, external as well as internal, to which the human body is liable, and of extending life free from sickness, and with the clear healthy exercise of the men∣tal faculties, to the longest possible period.—At the expiration of the three years, I intend to make proposals to the BRITISH PARLIAMENT concerning publishing to the world all my dis∣coveries, improvements, and methods of propagation, and of ma∣naging and curing diseases, &amp;c. without any reserve whatever; and that I may continue to communicate, from time to time, such farther discoveries and improvements as assiduous investiga∣tion, and a practice with an apparatus more potent and more ex∣tensive than that of any other Physician on the face of the globe, shall enable me to make.</P>
<P>If I do not meet with that benevolence and encouragement from the LEGISLATURE of my own country, which the vast impor∣tance of the object merits—I propose to reside and practise about a year at each of the principal courts in Europe; and after that, under the royal and imperial auspices of European wisdom and munificence at large, I will then publish to mankind the great pro∣lific CODE, and SYSTEM OF HEALTH and of the HEALING ART, which I am now digesting, compiling and perfecting as far as the experience of one age will permit—I say one Age, because I am now establishing a medical correspondence in every part of the world—for the universal improvement and perfection of Medical and Chirurgical Science. Would to God that a Franklin, a Priestley, and several other great and learned men I could name, had been practising physicians, what might not be expected from the indefatigable labours of such bright and penetrating intelli∣gencies!</P>
<P>In order to lessen my fatigue in business and for the good of the public, as well as for my own private emolument, I propose im∣mediately to take as pupils and assistants, three gentlemen who have had the advantages, if not of a medical, at least of a liberal or classical education.—To prevent all trouble, the premium I I demand from each is a thousand guineas prompt, and an hun∣dred guineas per ann. for board, &amp;c. while he remains in my house.</P>
