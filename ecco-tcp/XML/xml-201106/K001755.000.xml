<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two very different methods of curing the Gonorrhoea, the one wholly by internal medicines, the other principally by injection. The former is generally a very uncertain and disagreeable process, the latter is both expeditious and safe, but dreaded by many persons on ac∣count of a false idea which has long pre∣vailed. This ill founded notion it is my business at present to confute by several arguments supported by quotations from Authors of distinguished credit.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pott</HI> recommends the advice given by Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> to a student, "to consider one disease at a time, and to become tho∣roughly acquainted with that, before he
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>undertakes another." He further observes, "that the only means by which true and useful knowledge is to be obtained in every part of surgery, are a competent knowledge of the anatomical structure of the human frame, a close attention to the symptoms of diseases in the living, and a minute examination of the appear∣ances in the dead: these are the great foun∣tains of all medical knowledge." Mr. <HI>Pott</HI> has here pointed out, in a very judicious manner, the path which every chirurgical practitioner and writer should pursue, who undertakes to explain the true nature, seat, and cure of any bodily disorder.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE GONORRHOEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE part principally affected by the Gonorrhoea is the penis, which con∣sists of three parts; two of which are called corpora cavernosa, and lie on each side, and a third, which is situated underneath, named corpus spongiosum urethrae, con∣sisting of the bulb and membranous part, continued on to the bladder, and termina∣ting at the other extremity in the corona, or glans penis. The urethra has three glands, which were discovered by <HI>Cowper,</HI> and called mucous glands, from the tena∣city of the liquor which they separate. There are also two, (or rather one,) about the size of a nutmeg, they lie at the neck
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>of the bladder, between the vesiculae semi∣nales and penis, under the ossa pubis, al∣most within the pelvis of the abdomen; they separate a limpid glutinous humour, which is carried into the urethra by several ducts, which enter near those of the pro∣statae The two first of <HI>Cowper</HI>'s glands are about the bigness of a French bean, of a depressed oval figure, and a yellowish colour like the prostatae, being on each side the bulb of the urethra, a little above it. Their excretory ducts arise from the internal surface next the inner membrane of the urethra, into which they open a little lower by two distinct orifices, just below the curvature of the ossa pubis in perinaeo, where they discharge a transparent viscous liquor. The third mucous gland is a small conglobate yellowish gland, like the former, but somewhat less, situated above the angle of the flexure of the urethra, un∣der the ossa pubis, in the perinaeum, near the anus: it has two excretory ducts, which enter the urethra obliquely, a quarter of an inch below the two former, and discharges a liquor like them both in colour and con∣sistence.</P>
<P>The seat of the Gonorrhoea in women is the vagina, which is affected with a dis∣charge
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>charge like that of the urethra in men. It lies between the bladder and intestinum rectum, and has rugae, under which are small glands, whose excretory ducts are called lacunae. These glands separate a mucilaginous slimy liquor to lubricate the vagina, and are the seat of the Gonorrhoea in this sex, as the glands in the urethra are in the male. The meatus urinarius being a very short passage, the heat and scalding is consequently much less than in the men.</P>
<P><Q>"A Gonorrhoea from the urethra in a man, begins with an uneasiness about the parts of generation, together with an ap∣pearance of a little whitish matter, about the orifice of the urethra, a little swelling and sometimes redness there, and a slight pungency upon the evacuation of urine. The whitish matter soon increases in quantity, the inflammation about the end of the urethra becomes more evident, and for the most part there is now a ten∣sion and hardness through the whole of it, a swelling of the lacunae, and a sen∣sation of stricture in the penis, particu∣larly on erection. The matter still in∣creases, flows out, and grows thinner, loses all its adhesiveness, and is of a yellow, or greenish colour. There is
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>now always a redness about the end of the canal; often a pain from the dis∣tention of the urethra, during the eva∣cuation of urine, and a much severer to∣wards the orifice, from its stimulus, with an increase of the redness just after it is evacuated. The inflammation prevents the extension of the urethra in erection, so that the penis is at that time curved downwards with great pain, which is in∣creased if it be raised towards the belly, and the stimulus occasions it often to be erected, especially when warm in bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI>'s Elements of Physic.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I believe it would generally be esteemed good practice on this occasion to give nitre in considerable quantity, a purging elec∣tuary, pill, or salts, and to take blood freely from the patient; also to direct large quantities of diluting liquors, and further to recommend a strict regimen and abstinence from particular meats, vegetables, and strong liquors. The question is, are such medicines and restriction necessary? In my humble opinion they are not, and they appear, upon the whole, to do more harm than good, as I shall endeavour to demonstrate from the experience of those
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>who are well qualified to give an opinion in a matter of this kind, and also from my own observation and practice.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> remarks, "that purgatives not only inflame the rectum, but also extend their irritation to the urethra." May not chordee and priapism then often be attri∣buted to this cause?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI> recommends "increasing the secretion a little, by such gentle pur∣gatives as procure only two or three evacu∣ations a day."—But who can ensure his patient two or three stools only in a day? The intestines being once put into motion, will not accommodate themselves exactly to our wish or convenience. Happily for the patient, it is certain that even gentle purging may be dispensed with on these occasions.</P>
<P>He adds, "that severe purging often augments the inflammatory symptoms, brings on strangury and exulcerations, gives occasion to inflammation of the testicles, and other neighbouring parts, or it stops the running before the infection is washed off, and the Gonorrhoea either returns in a few days, or exulcerations take place."</P>
<P>The Doctor further observes, "that long continued purging is apt to weaken the
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>stomach and intestines, to hurt the di∣gestion, to produce obstinate gleets, and leave hypochondriacal symptoms, particu∣larly in irritable or melancholic habits."</P>
<P>Many more authorities might be adduced in proof of the bad effects of a course of purgatives in these cases, which are generally of considerable duration, when treated in this manner. Neither are anti∣phlogistic remedies to be depended upon, as they sometimes produce the very contra∣ry effect to what was expected from them: amongst the first of these is nitre, in inflam∣matory disorders. Dr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> a late writer of no small credit, reckons, that nitre often gives relief in stranguries, and heat of urine, proceeding either from a simple or a vene∣real taint; and indeed the greatest part of practitioners have always given it, and still continue to give it in the venereal <HI>ardor urinae.</HI></P>
<P><Q>"This practice, however, says Dr. <HI>Hope</HI> in his lectures on the Materia medica, I am apt to believe has taken its rise from the name of ardor having always been given to the pain in evacuating the urine, during the time of a venereal inflamma∣tion of the urethra, and the name and virtues of a cooler, having always been
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>attributed to this salt. But it is certain that the urine passed during the time of a venereal inflammation is no warmer than at other times, and therefore to prescribe a cooler to allay the heat of it, is absurd: and I am persuaded, that on a free and candid examination of this matter, it will be found, that nitre has not the smallest power of alleviating the pain which is then felt; for I have given it in all the different stages of this disease, in small and in large doses; but from the sole use of it in a great number of trials, have never been able to observe that it afforded the least relief. Nor, when we consider the cause of that pain, and the effects of nitre, have we any reason to expect it; for the pain certainly proceeds from the acrid salts in the urine, stimu∣lating the inflamed or excoriated urethra; and a solution of nitre applied to any ex∣coriated part always gives considerable pain. Experiments assure us, that on taking nitre into the stomach, the urine becomes impregnated with it. The larger therefore the doses are, the stronger will this impregnation be, and the greater stimulus added to the urine; so that we may sensibly conclude, that this salt will
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>rather augment than diminish the pain in evacuating it. The Doctor further re∣marks, that there are many weak and delicate stomachs which cannot bear the cold it produces, and others in whom it always creates sickness and nausea."</Q></P>
<P>Besides the disagreeable circumstance of taking great quantities of nauseous me∣dicines, we find there is the greatest un∣certainty as to their real effects on the diseases they are intended to remove. A powder or medicine of any kind, applied to blood in a bason, may visibly affect that fluid, and render it thin or thick; yet being taken into the stomach, and possibly from thence into the circulation, it may have a very different effect on the circula∣ting fluids, or perhaps none, having un∣dergone a material alteration in its course.</P>
<P>A late celebrated Lecturer on the Mate∣ria Medica, discoursing with his pupils on the powerful operations of mucilaginous medicines in the alleviation of the pain arising from the stone in the bladder, re∣marked that such medicines were extremely useful where the stone was of the mulberry kind, and apt to vellicate the coats of the bladder. He told them the ropy mucilage
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>would envelope the stone, and make a uni∣formly smooth surface, entirely depriving it of its asperities, and consequently of its power of hurting the bladder.</P>
<P>It is difficult for one conversant with the mechanism of the human body, and the operation of medicine, to conceive, that a mucilage given by the mouth will arrive at the bladder in that state. We are cer∣tain that particular remedies will stimulate particular parts: balsam of capivi, for in∣stance, being absorbed, is known to af∣fect the kidnies and bladder, by the strong odour it imparts to the urine; but we do not find this, or any other medicine, ex∣cept quicksilver, will pass off in the same form in which it is administered by the mouth. This balsam is very much esteem∣ed for its great virtues, particularly in cer∣tain stages of the Gonorrhoea, but it is so very disagreeable, on account of its oily and bitter quality, as well as its smell, that some patients are soon disgusted with it, and others will not be prevailed upon to take it at all; we cannot therefore think it strange, that many gentlemen should often prefer injections to all other means, which do not appear to produce effects in any degree equal to the trouble which at∣tends
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>them. It must be acknowledged that patients often suffer more from the remedy than the disorder; they are often more emaciated, weak, and pallid in their countenance, (circumstances which fre∣quently lead to disagreeable discoveries,) from the operations of purgatives in the space of one week, than they would have been in a month, if there had been no attempt made to check the progress of this disorder.</P>
<P>There are many people who have not leisure to pursue the several directions and prescriptions given by practitioners; and if they could find time, they would have but little inclination to undergo so much fatigue and trouble. Such tedious pro∣cesses are very ill contrived for the mul∣titude, who must be, <HI>and are daily cured by means much more easy, expeditious, and quite as effectual;</HI> and if one class of men are cured in this manner, why should not all enjoy the same benefit?</P>
<P>I have asserted, that a regimen, or par∣ticular diet, is not necessary in the cure of the Gonorrhoea, when treated in the man∣ner here recommended. Some have asked, if the disorder is not inflammatory, and if living low is not indispensibly necessary
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>in every complaint of this kind? It may be said in reply, that this is a local inflam∣mation, which yields at once to a cooling detergent liquid applied to the part; whilst internal medicines are commonly slow and uncertain in removing it.—When mercury does not pass into the stomach, there is no occasion to enjoin restrictions with respect to diet, since no disagreement can then happen; patients may live in the same manner as at other times, only avoiding excess.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hugh Smith,</HI> who is an advocate for vitriolic injections, asserts, "That a Go∣norrhoea, if taken in the beginning, may generally be cured in a fortnight, without any injuty to the constitution, or any ill effects whatsoever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Formulae Medicamentorum.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I have met with the greatest success in the cure of this complaint from the same sort of injections, and find they answer much better than mercurial ones, which deposit a considerable sediment, and being conveyed into the urethra, cause irritation and pain in that tender passage.</P>
<P>The injection should be applied cold, rather than warm, (as cold braces and
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>warmth relaxes,) which I find often com∣pletes the cure in much less than a fort∣night, the time mentioned by the Doctor.</P>
<P>If the injection causes any more than a slight sensation of smart or pain in the pas∣sage, it is evidently too much impregnated with vitriol, and the solution must be made weaker, as the irritation of the liquor would increase the symptoms instead of diminish∣ing them.</P>
<P>The great objection to this sort of prac∣tice is raised on the supposition that <HI>In∣jections</HI> are apt to produce <HI>stricture</HI> in the urinary passage, This idea, I apprehend, is not well founded; having enquired of many different people who have been troubled with <HI>strictures,</HI> if they had used injections for the cure, and was generally answered in the negative.—I am much inclined to think with Doctor <HI>Fordyce,</HI> "That when a <HI>gonorrhoea</HI> continues long, it sometimes produces a <HI>stricture</HI> in the part." Inflammation is naturally dispo∣sed to produce contraction and <HI>stricture</HI> in the different sacculi and passages of the body, as well as in the <HI>urethra:</HI> therefore we may conclude, that evils are often at∣tributed to <HI>Injections,</HI> which in fact owe
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>their origin to other causes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the long duration of this distemper produces stric∣tures and obstructions, then what removes the disorder quickly, must undoubtedly prevent the above evils, in∣stead of causing them.</NOTE>. The same gentleman justly observes, that omitting the <HI>injection</HI> once or twice will often make it fail of curing, when it would have other∣wise produced that effect<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If the Injection should not produce the desired ef∣fect, it will be right to enquire if the urine passes freely, and whether it divides into two streams, or more; or whether it comes out twisted, like a cork-screw. In these cases, it is not likely the Injection should effect its purpose, being unable to pass: recourse must therefore be had to the <HI>Bougie</HI> to restore the passage to its natural state.</NOTE>. He likewise remarks, that patients treated in this man∣ner, are less liable to inflammation of the testicles, or of the glands in the groin (on to <HI>chancres</HI>) or <HI>strictures.</HI> These observa∣tions are certainly founded on fact. It is the general opinion, that small doses of mercury ought to accompany the <HI>Injection.</HI> See <HI>Fordyce, Saunders, Smith,</HI> and others.—Conformably to this idea, I give a grain of mercurial powder, and apply it to the cu∣ticular surfaces of the lips, or the tongue, and at the same time make use of the <HI>vi∣triolic,</HI> in preference to every other <HI>Injection.</HI> Though I have made repeated trials of se∣veral,
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>I know of no other which would remove the disorder in twice the time which this does; but there are some that would not succeed at all, and rather aggravate the symptoms.</P>
<P>It is now proved by a repetition of in∣genious experiments, and generally admit∣ted, that the discharge in a <HI>Gonorrhoea</HI> pro∣ceeding from the <HI>wethra,</HI> is not <HI>pus,</HI> but <HI>mucus. Pus</HI> is the matter which proceeds from wounds and ulcers, but <HI>mucus</HI> comes from surfaces not ulcerated, though some∣times inflamed. Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI> says, he has often dissected the <HI>urethra</HI> of persons who have died, having the <HI>Gonorrhoea</HI> at that time, and he adds, that he never disco∣vered any ulcer in the passage. <HI>Mucus</HI> is, in itself, an innocent, mild fluid, but ca∣pable of acquiring virulence and acrimo∣ny from contagious infection.</P>
<P>The Gonorrhoea is an increased and virulent discharge from the <HI>mucous</HI> glands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Described in Pages 1 and 2.</NOTE> of the urinary passage. Mucus, when untainted, is transparent like the white of an egg, appears as a drop sometimes at the orifice of the urethra next the glands, is of a mucilaginous viscidity, and its use is to sheathe and defend the passage
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>from the irritating salts conveyed in the urine. It resembles the fluid in the eye, which is secreted in small quantity, but when the lachrymal gland is stimulated by grief, dust, or other offending substance, the discharge becomes copious and some∣times acrid.</P>
<P><HI>Darwin</HI> observes, in his experiments on pus and mucus, "That whenever the secretion of any fluid is increased, there is at the same time an increased heat in the part." The same gentleman observes, that "the catarrhal humour from the nostrils of some who ride in frosty weather, and the tears which run down the cheeks of those who have an ob∣struction of the puncta lachrymalia, are easily distinguished from others, by their abounding in ammoniacal or muriatic salts, whence they inflame the circumjacent skin: thus in the catarrh, the upper lip becomes red and swelled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of the salt∣ness of its taste. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corrosive tears, and the ichor of some herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the contiguous parts, and is pungent∣ly salt to the taste, as some patients have informed him."</P>
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
<P>When the mucous membrane of the nose is stimulated by a violent cold, or other cause, we often see an extraordinary quantity of discharge from that organ; yet no one suspects the existence of any ulcers there, and I have often observed, that the discoloured mucus of that part bears so strong a resemblance to the viru∣lent discharge in the gonorrhoea, that it would frequently perplex persons conver∣sant in these matters to distinguish two handkerchiefs, the one from the other, when stained with the respective mucus. Either of these fluids having acquired acrimony will inflame, and sometimes slightly exco∣riate irritable nervous membranes. These excoriations generally heal of themselves, and when they do not, no one hesitates to apply repellent and healing medicines to the part, without even the smallest suspicion of any bad consequence. With ulcers the case is very different, there being the greatest reason to apprehend danger from the absorption of matter into the circulation. Writers of good credit assert, that a drop of acrid pus, absorbed into the blood, affects all the fluids, stimu∣lates the vessels, and is capable of produ∣cing violent disorders, such as putrid fe∣vers,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>&amp;c. Impressed with such a belief, no thinking man, in this or any age, would adopt a practice at once so irrational and dangerous: but as the discharge is merely mucus, and has no concern with the system or animal oeconomy, it may be safely washed away, like any other <HI>sordes,</HI> or filth from the surfaces of the body, by injec∣tions, which are not only far more expedi∣tious in producing their effects, but also appear, on a due comparison of the merits of each, to possess another advantage, that of being a more cleanly, safe, and agreeable method of cure, than any other whatsoever. I have only to add in this place, that I am confirmed more and more in the use of in∣jections, which entirely answer the above description and commendation.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE REMEDIES in USE for the CURE OF THE LUES VENEREA, FROM ITS First Appearance in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>THE cure of this disorder, which has now prevailed all over <HI>Europe</HI> near three centuries, has not been so much im∣proved by the profession as might have been expected during so long a period. It raged for several years uncontrouled, be∣fore an effectual remedy for it was disco∣vered. After the antidote for this poison was found to exist in mercury, yet still so very unfortunate was the applicat on of it, that many lives were lost by sa∣livations, shocking to relate, in conse∣quence
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>of the want of sufficient know∣ledge of the nature and qualities of this mineral, in the practitioners of those times.</P>
<P>"The first attempts of the cure of vene∣real maladies, by this remedy, were learned from the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who having recom∣mended mercurial ointments in the <HI>Leprosy</HI> or scabies, gave a handle to the <HI>Italian</HI> physicians, to try their efficacy in removing the foulness of the skin from a new and ter∣rible contagion: neither were they sparing of their liniments, which they continued to rub in for twelve, fifteen, nay, some∣times for above thirty days together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mead</HI> on Poisons.</NOTE>," a very dangerous practice, which prevails too much even in the present age. Sarsaparilla, sassafras, guaicum, have all at different pe∣riods been in more or less estimation for their antivenereal virtues; but mercury is the only antidote for this poison, on which any age has reposed an entire confidence.</P>
<P>In 1685, Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> wrote on this amongst other subjects. His account shews, that although the use of the re∣medy was better understood, yet the cure of the disorder was but little improved.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>
<P>In 1731, Dr. <HI>Turner,</HI> a member of the College of Physicians in <HI>London,</HI> who had made the Venereal Disease his particular study, thought proper to communicate his observations and practice to the world. His drastic purges, and mercurial prescriptions, were such as might destroy the most robust constitution; what then must have become of those of a weak and delicate frame?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> has advanced a system of his own, apparently less detrimental than former ones, and which has been very much adopted of late years. The Doctor's theory of the disease is, that it is seated in the fat; therefore evacuations which de∣stroyed it, must, in his opinion, contri∣bute greatly to the cure of this disorder; for which reason the Doctor recommended the most powerful sudorifics and purga∣tives, the former of which though hurt∣ful, are less prejudicial to the constitution than the latter.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Astruc,</HI> a celebrated writer, has given a very sensible and accurate description of the <HI>Lues Venerea</HI> in all its stages, with di∣rections for its cure; but the remedies are as violent as those recommended by pre∣ceding writers, and ought therefore to be exploded.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
<P>Baron <HI>Van Swieten</HI> recommends <HI>The Cor∣rosive Sublimate</HI> to be given internally. It had hitherto only been used externally to <HI>fungus</HI> in wounds, on account of the vio∣lence of its nature. Even when admini∣stered in rum or brandy, to correct it, the stomach can seldom retain it, for which reason it has grown into disrepute, although it has a most astonishing and rapid effect in removing venereal symptoms.</P>
<P>Mr. Professor <HI>Plenk</HI> advises the giving <HI>Quicksilver with gum arabic,</HI> to prevent it from exciting a salivation. This is the least prejudicial of all the modes of admini∣stering mercury internally.</P>
<P><HI>Fumigation,</HI> which is lately revived, I have often seen applied to sores with hardly any perceptible advantage, and sometimes it gave great pain, and did a manifest in∣jury.</P>
<P>Two circumstances have conduced great∣ly to the better treatment of this complaint, within these twenty or thirty years; I mean, the extraordinary improvements in anatomy and chymistry: by the former we have acquired a better knowledge of the seat of this disorder, and by the lat∣ter, of the medicines employed to effect it's cure.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="inquiry">
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
<HEAD>A CRITICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE OPERATION OF MERCURY, AND THE DIFFERENT Modes of administering it considered.</HEAD>
<P>DIFFERENCE of opinion prevails with regard to the mode of admini∣stering mercurial preparations; the advo∣cates for each, giving their reasons for that which they adopt in preference to any other. The <HI>alterative</HI> method is much in esteem and practice, and with some devia∣tion and caution may be rendered very beneficial.</P>
<P>This appellation of <HI>alterant or alterative is given to all such medicines as correct the
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>bad qualities of the blood, and other animal fluids, without occasioning any sensible evacu∣ation.</HI> According to Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> all that is commonly alledged concerning the change of principles or ferments of dis∣eases by alterant remedies, is merely chi∣merical and imaginary; he remarks, that there is no change made to the advantage of the human body without a successive renovation and discharge of what is hurtful, and a supply of its place by something in∣nocent.</P>
<P>The Doctor gives the preference to eva∣cuants, as being the only medicines ca∣pable of freeing the machine from whatever incommodes it. Some take a contrary course, and ascribe even the salutary ef∣fects of evacuants to their alterative nature, which has been alledged of mercury in the cure of the venereal disease. Among alte∣rant medicines there are several which change the scene of the symptoms, and others which suspend the action of the mor∣bific matter for a time; but these reme∣dies which hold the morbific principles captive pro tempo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, are only palliatives, and even on some accounts dangerous, since they may as well captivate other prin∣ciples necessary to lise.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI> says, "Whatever prepara∣tion we employ, we should give it in such a manner, and in such a dose as to pro∣duce hardness, fullness, and moderate fre∣quency of the pulse, with as little sensible evacuation as possible; for that the mercury cures sooner and with greater certainty, when the strength is but little, than when it is much reduced by it."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Plenck</HI> is of opinion, "that mer∣cury, together with the venereal virus, may be more conveniently and more easily evacuated by the ordinary excretions of sweat, stool, and urine."</P>
<P>It seems to me much more safe to per∣mit the gradual evacuation of mercury (after it has circulated some time, and sub∣dued the virus) than to confine it within the body by opiates, or other means, so as to oc∣casion hardness, fullness, and acceleration of the pulse. The saturation or surcharge of the system with mercury is very ha∣zardous, as it sometimes terminates in a fatal diarrhaea. Surely it is most prudent to permit a little of the mercury to depart, and throw into the circulation such a pro∣portion only, as may be altogether safe and
<PB N="32" REF="29"/>yet sufficient to keep up a gentle mercurial stimulus in the habit.</P>
<P>Mercury and wine operate somewhat alike upon the body. With a certain quantity of wine, hardness, fullness, and acceleration of the pulse will supervene, till at length in common an evacuation takes place; when it does not, and the wine is retained there, (like mercury ex∣hibited as an alterative), it excites feverish heat, and does the constitution much more injury than when it passes off gradually by any of the ordinary evacuations.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI> observes, "it is never ne∣cessary to salivate a patient, unless he be so irritable, that the smallest dose of mercury immediately affects his mouth, or unless the disease be proceeding so fast that it would be hazardous to wait till it was checked by the remedy given in such a manner as to avoid salivation; or except∣ing when we cannot trust to his using it regularly. On the contrary, salivation ren∣ders the effects of the medicine uncertain." The same author says, "If, notwithstand∣ing these precautions, a salivation should come on, we know of no remedy which will remove it with any degree of certainty,
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>although sulphur, camphire, and purga∣tives have been recommended for this pur∣pose. If therefore the case be urgent, the best way is to let it go on, using the mer∣curial ointment as above described."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Saunders</HI> says he has known patients who have had violent fevers excited by mercury in the form of unction.
<P>The same author remarks, that a gentleman who had recourse to mercurial unction, being seized with a fever, sent for him, and communicated to him his venercal com∣plaints. His pulse was quick and hard, he complained of pain in his back, headach, thirst, and other such symp∣toms as he had frequently seen arise from a mercurial course, conducted on the plan here prescribed."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> observes,—that purging is never excited by any means, without spasms of the intestines, which, when the operation is continued, are apt to end in du∣rable spasm and inflammation. These are attended with very dangerous consequences. Neither does the method of purging by unction answer much better (although per∣haps more effectual), because it is attended with very great pain.—<HI>Lectures on Materia medica.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>I have ever found those patients more easily cured, who were most susceptible of the mercurial stimulus. Let there be an affection of the mouth and cheeks, and an amendment of the complaint takes place at least nine times in ten; the mercury will run off in general very soon if the process is discontinued, which it must not be, but the tenderness of the mouth is to be kept
<PB N="34" REF="31"/>up to a certain degree, according to the urgency of the disorder, and to prevent a relapse, especially in chancres with hard∣ness, and in other inveterate cases. It is not the mere quantity of mercury, but the method of directing its operation, which in my opinion is the chief circumstance to be relied on in the cure. I would certainly run the risk, if there was any, of <HI>not imme∣diately curing,</HI> rather than expose my pa∣tient to the hazard of a large quantity of accumulated mercury ready at an hour's notice, or less, to emancipate itself from the body by stimulating the intestines, and thus exhausting li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>We may be amused with the theory of mercury circulating in the system in perfect equilibrium, not inclining more to one se∣cretion than to another; but it is certain, this is a powerful medicine that ought not to be trifled with; we cannot say to it—So far shalt thou go, and no further. The most skilful pilot will find it difficult so to trim his vessel that it shall not sink or over∣turn when too heavily laden with mercury.</P>
<P>The ingenious <HI>Plenck,</HI> (to whom the world is so much indebted for the great im∣provements he has made by his experi∣ments on mercury, and in the cure of this
<PB N="35" REF="32"/>disease) says, that a salivation is a danger∣ous practice; for the famous <HI>Astruc,</HI> says he, asserts that there frequently supervene, violent fevers, diarrhaea, dysentery, hae∣moptoe, an immobility of the jaws, and likewise a suffocation, and that too, when a salivation has been most properly con∣ducted; and after him the most skilful <HI>Locher</HI> tells us the same.—</P>
<P>Several years since a practitioner had the misfortune to lose (within a short time of each other) two patients with chancres, for the cure of which he had raised very high salivations by mercurial ointment. Just as their complaints were healed, and salivation began to decline, one of the gentlemen was seized with a dysenteric flux, and expired within a few hours: his death was attributed to a piece of butter which the nurse had inadvertently put into his gruel. The other died also of a flux, arising from the sudden descent of the mer∣cury overturning the equilibrium, and rush∣ing through the patient's bowels with irre∣sistible impetuosity.—</P>
<P>To form a just idea of a salivation, we should perambulate the public hospitals, where there are wretches miserable indeed!
<PB N="36" REF="33"/>miserable in having a sad disease, but much more so in having a cure to encounter which makes the unhappy objects call on death for a deliverance from their pains. Their head, face, and tongue so swelled, as to forbid their uttering a syllable. Their cheeks often torn to pieces, a salivary flux of two or three quarts a day, with breath extremely offensive, teeth loose, tongue and gums ulcerated and inflamed, attended with a severe unremitting head-ach; and this process is the same in all cases and seasons: it may truly be said, such remedies are worse than the diseases they are intended to remove. But this is not all the pa∣tient has to undergo; add to this, fre∣quent severe cholicky pains, accompa∣nied with diarrhaea and dysentery, which continuing, so often prove fatal. The patient can swallow no solid food during this severe operation, and indeed scarcely liquids, and is almost dead with hunger, having often an appetite without the pos∣sibility of indulging it. Thus are per∣sons confined for several weeks, and when the process is finished, they are so re∣duced in flesh, as to be quite a spectacle, and frequently go into a deep decline.—
<PB N="37" REF="34"/>If these evils may be prevented, and that they may, we have daily experience added to the strongest testimonies, are we not all called upon by every motive of con∣science, religion, and humanity, to preserve the unhappy from ruin, by rejecting so cruel a practice?</P>

<P>If the surgeons who superintend the hos∣pitals would make a trial of my me∣thod, I am convinced from experience, they would be able, without annoying the stomach, to convey any quantity of any mercurial preparation into the system in few hours, instead of weeks. This may be done by rubbing mercury on the back and middle of the tongue, and repeating the process at the shortest intervals. There is no occasion to wait for its operation as in the case of pills, but we may safely stimu∣late these surfaces as much and as often as we chuse, till we have actually produced the desired effect on the system. Let the mouth be well cleared of the saliva, and I know of no other impediment to the success of this process. Dr. <HI>Home,</HI> profes∣sor of physic at Edinburgh, has honoured me by making a variety of public experi∣ments
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>in the Edingburgh Infirmary, which will soon appear in the Doctor's intended publication. By these experiments it is proved, that mercury is more quickly in∣troduced, with greater certainty, and with less prejudice to the constitution in this way, than by any of the other modes of admini∣stering it internally or externally.</P>

<HEAD>Objections to Mercury in the Form of Pills, Bolus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WITH respect to Pills, it is certain that many patients find a difficulty in taking them. First, it is hardly pos∣sible so to distribute the mercury through∣out the mass, that there shall not be some difference and uncertainty in the dose when divided into pills; and secondly, they sometimes pass through the body undis∣solved. When they dissolve, they irritate, perhaps corrode, the stomach, an organ most essential to health. This circum∣stance has excited universal complaint and dread of mercury, which however being administered in my method, is so very
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>mild, that it does not in the least impair the constitution, as the surface on which the mercury is laid, will bear a consider∣able degree of irritation without any sort of prejudice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A grain of mercury applied to the internal surfaces of the mouth is thence absorbed with the greatest facility, and operates kindly and with effect on the habit in general. Dr. Cullen justly observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lecture on Mercury.</NOTE>, "that when we purge, we think we are operating on the common sewer of the system: but little advantage is to be found from the mercury employed in this way, as its virtues depend chiefly on its operation on the body in general."</NOTE></P>

Of this every medical practitioner must have seen many instances. There are few persons who have been so unfortunate as to take large quantities of this mineral in the usual way, who do not exhibit melancholy proofs of its baneful effects on the stomach and bowels.

<HEAD>Objections to Mercurial Ointment.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><Q>"The friction of Mercurial Ointment is to many people one of the most dis∣agreeable things in the world. It's leaden colour, contrasted with the skin, makes it look dirty. It has a particu∣larly offensive smell, independent of that of the turpentine, or balsam of sulphur, which may have been employed in extin∣guishing the quicksilver. From the cir∣cumstance that half an hour's friction, or even that of a whole hour, if ever so well performed, will not commonly ef∣fect a total absorption of the ointment, the skin is generally left a little smeared with it: after the process is over, as it is oily it does not evaporate, or dry readily, and will easily stick to whatever it touches. Patients are obliged to sleep in flannel drawers to prevent the ointment from getting through and daubing the bed clothes. They must be frequently changing these drawers, constantly wash∣ing the skin; or, as washing off the oint∣ment would retard rather than forward the cure, they must remain dirty for six weeks, or perhaps three months toge∣ther; and if by accident any part of the
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>ointment gets upon their linen, from it's colour it is very apt to give the alarm in families, and lead to disagree∣able discoveries."</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Dr. <HI>Manning,</HI> in his Practice of Physic, on the subject of my mercurial process ob∣serves as follows; "By this method we not only avoid the inconveniencies of unc∣tion, but the purgative effects that are often produced by mercury when taken in∣to the stomach."</P>
<P>With respect to a regimen in the treat∣ment of the Lues, abstinence and low living certainly retard the cure. Persons afflicted with this distemper, are much sub∣ject to despondency, and living more freely now than at other times, raises the spirits of the patient, and contributes to his cure by co-operating with the medicine; there∣fore I shall continue to recommend that practice, at the same time should object as strongly as any other practitioner, to every indulgence that might be prejudicial. It has been said, that people under a course of mercury cannot be kept too warm, which is true only when the mercury affects the
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>stomach or bowels, or greatly opens the pores of the skin; but from the very mild operation of mercury on the system in my method, patients are exposed to all weathers, without injury to the constitu∣tion.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Krohn</HI> on this subject says, "this mode agrees better with people who are debauchees, having had essential proof of this assertion in a patient who drank all kinds of strong liquors, was scarcely ever in bed for a week together, till break of day, and was much exposed to cold damp air."</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="overview">
<HEAD>A Recapitulation of Objections to the common Methods of administering <HI>MERCURY,</HI> accompanied with some new Observations, and conveying a short and pointed View of the Whole.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Lues</HI> is a venereal infection in the mass of blood; and is to be cured by throwing a sufficient quantity of mercury into the system to expel it.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="42"/>
<P>There are many ways of conveying mer∣cury into the circulation of the blood.</P>
<P>The usual methods are by pills, bo∣luses, and draughts, and also by outward application of mercurial ointment.</P>
<P>The first three are conveyed by the mouth into the stomach, where the mer∣curial particles are in part absorbed by the lymphatic vessels of that organ, and conveyed into the blood; also by the same vessels in the intestines, and frequently the greatest portion of the mercury escapes out of the body by this outlet, having first irri∣tated the animal oeconomy throughout the whole of the canal.</P>
<P>Mercury may be prevented from passing downwards by joining <HI>opium</HI> with it, which takes off its stimulus, and generally pre∣vents its purgative effects; but this often creates sickness and reaching, and shakes the whole nervous system.</P>
<P>Two grains of mercury taken up into the blood by the mouth, will produce as power∣ful an effect on the system, as twenty grains thrown into the stomach, on the pre∣sumption that eighteen of the twenty make their exit downwards: we reckon only what gets into the system, for what pas∣ses through, <HI>is lost,</HI> and certainly better
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>had never been given. The stomach re∣sembles a sink with a grate in it, and is not constructed to retain mercury.</P>
<P>Mercurial ointment cures by being taken up into the blood by the absorbents of the external skin, and when introduced there, by operating on the whole vascular system, and expelling the venereal poison by the different secretions and excretions of the body.</P>
<P>The objections to this mode of practice are, First, that it is dirty and disagreeable; that it is commonly slow and tedious: that it requires too much labour for persons in a weak state, and if the friction is per∣formed by other hands than their own, that one half of the ointment, or more, must in∣fallibly be lost to the patient, and may prove very injurious to the party who ap∣plies it.</P>
<P>Mercurial ointment affects the stomach or bowels, and brings on purging; inso∣much that it is not uncommon for patients, both in public and private practice, to die under a course of unction, of violent cho∣lies, accompanied by sanguinary and other fluxes, and this happens by the quantity of mercury absorbed proving an overbalance for the constitution.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>
<P>Practitioners do not accurately know what quantity of mercury may be given, and what quantity of it will take effect, as different constitutions require different doses. Five grains of mercurial ointment will take more effect on one subject, than fifty on another; after using it ten or fifteen days successively, no visible effect may be pro∣duced on the constitution; yet, on the eighteenth or twentieth, a salivary flux may commence, and continue for a fortnight or three weeks, and the patient's strength become exhausted. At this juncture should a diarrhaea unfortunately take place, it carries off the patient in a few hours, not∣withstanding all the endeavours of the most skilful of the faculty.</P>
<P>I have made use of such arguments as have occurred to me in behalf of this new method, and have advanced nothing but what my repeated experience doth fully warrant. If the ideas of other practitioners do not coincide with mine, I shall be happy to see their avowed and printed sen∣timents on this important subject, divested of prejudice and delivered with candour.</P>
<P>Should it be asserted that this method sometimes fails, let not that declaration pre∣vent the trying it, as this may be urged
<PB N="48" REF="45"/>against all medical practice, and often, no doubt, with the greatest injustice.</P>
<P>It is said that this process, by shorten∣ing the cure and lessening the medicines, will diminish the fee. The profession need not object to it on that account, as they are paid, not for their medicine, this being no object, but for their skill and judge∣ment. Patients of liberal dispositions will always be pleased with dispatch and make a handsome return: and others will find their interest also in behaving in the same equi∣table manner.</P>
