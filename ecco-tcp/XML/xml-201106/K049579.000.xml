<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Most humbly of∣fer to You my Thoughts con∣cerning the <HI>Pre∣vention of the Plague,</HI> which I have put together
<PB REF="3"/>by your Command. As soon as you was pleased to sig∣nify to me, in his <HI>Majestie's</HI> Absence; that their Excel∣lencies the <HI>Lords Justices</HI> thought it necessary for the Publick Safety, upon the Account of the <HI>Sickness</HI> now in <HI>France,</HI> that proper Directions should be drawn up to defend our selves from such a Calamity; I most readily undertook the Task, though upon short Warning, and with little Leisure: I have therefore ra∣ther put down the <HI>principal Heads of Caution,</HI> than a <HI>Set of Directions in Form.</HI></P>

<P><HI>THE first,</HI> which relate to <HI>the performing Qua∣rentines,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>PART I. OF THE NATURE OF <HI>CONTAGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT the Reasonableness of any Method, which shall be proposed to pre∣vent the spreading of <HI>Con∣tagious</HI> Diseases, may the better ap∣pear, it is necessary to premise some∣what in general concerning <HI>Conta∣gion,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>and the Manner, by which it acts.</P>
<P>CONTAGION is propagated by three Causes, the <HI>Air; Diseased Persons;</HI> and <HI>Goods transported from infected Places.</HI></P>
<P>WE shall therefore first enquire what alteration of the <HI>Air</HI> it is, that makes it <HI>insections;</HI> and then, by what Means it communicates its noxious Quality to other Bodies.</P>
<P>THE ancientest and best Authors of Physick, who lived in a Coun∣try more exposed to these Calami∣ties than ours, observed the Con∣stitution of the <HI>Air,</HI> which preceded <HI>Pestilential Fevers,</HI> to be great <HI>Heats</HI> attended with much <HI>Rain</HI> and <HI>South∣erly Winds</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hippocrat. Epidem. lib. 3.</NOTE>: And one of Them takes particular Notice, that no o∣ther
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>than a <HI>moist</HI> and <HI>hot</HI> Tempera∣ment of the <HI>Air</HI> brings the <HI>Plague;</HI> and that the Duration of this Con∣stitution is the Measure of the Vio∣lence of the Distemper
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galen. de Temperament. lib. 1. cap. 4. &amp; Comment. in Epid. l. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Natural History of several Countries confirms this Observati∣on; in <HI>Africa</HI> particularly, if Show∣ers fall during the sultry Heats of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> the <HI>Plague</HI> ensues thereupon, with which whosoever is infected hardly escapes
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. J. Leon. Histor. Afric. lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT has besides been remarked in all Times, that the Stinks of <HI>stag∣nating Waters</HI> in hot Weather, <HI>pu∣trid Exhalations</HI> from the Earth; and above all, the Corruption of dead <HI>Carcasses</HI> lying unburied, have occasioned <HI>infectious Diseases.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<P>FROM hence it appears to be a <HI>Concurrence</HI> of Causes, that pro∣duces Diseases of this Kind; which must not only meet, but exert their Force together for a considerable time. And when this happens, their first Effect is a Degree of <HI>Stag∣nation</HI> in the Air, which is after∣wards followed by <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Putrefaction.</HI></P>
<P>AND upon this account it is, that those Countries are chiefly liable to these Calamities, where not only the <HI>Heats</HI> are very great, and the <HI>Weather</HI> continues long in the same State; but the <HI>Winds</HI> (the Use of which is by Motion to purify the Air) do not shift and change so of∣ten as they do in Northern Climates.</P>
<P>INDEED <HI>Plagues</HI> seem to be of the Growth of the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>Parts of the World, and to be trans∣mitted from them into colder Cli∣mates by the Way of <HI>Commerce.</HI> Nor do I think, that in this <HI>Island</HI> particularly there is any one In∣stance of a <HI>Pestilential</HI> Disease a∣mong us of great Consequence; which we did not receive from o∣ther <HI>infected</HI> Places.</P>
<P>THIS I the rather mention, be∣cause it is a common Opinion, and propagated by Authors of great Name, that we are usually <HI>visited</HI> with the <HI>Plague</HI> once in 30 or 40 Years; which is a mere Fancy with∣out any Foundation either in Rea∣son or Experience: and therefore People ought to be delivered from the Subjection to such vain Fears.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, though we have had several Strokes of this kind, yet there are Instances of
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>bad <HI>Contagions</HI> from abroad being brought over to us, which have proved less malignant here by our Air not being disposed to receive such Impressions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sweating Sickness,</HI> called the <HI>Sudor Anglicus</HI> and <HI>Febris Ephemera Britannica,</HI> because it was common∣ly thought to have taken its Rise here, was most probably of a foreign Original, and no other than a <HI>Plague</HI> abated in its Violence by the mild Temperament of our Climate.</P>
<P>FOR, we learn from Histories, that the first time this was felt here, which was in the Year 1485, it be∣gan in the Army, with which King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. came from <HI>France,</HI> and landed in <HI>Wales</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Caium de Febre Ephemers Britannica.</NOTE>; and it was then thought to have been brought
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>into <HI>France</HI> from the famous Siege of <HI>Rhodes</HI> by the <HI>Turks</HI> 3 or 4 Years before. And of the four Returns, which this has made since that Time; two, viz. <HI>those</HI> in the Years 1527, and 1528, may very justly be suspected to have been owing to the <HI>Pestilence,</HI> which at those Times raged in <HI>Italy,</HI> particularly at <HI>Flo∣rence</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rondinelli Contagio in Firenze, &amp; Sum∣monte Histor. di Napoli.</NOTE>. And the others were very probably from a <HI>Turkish</HI> Infection.</P>
<P>I call this Distemper a <HI>Plague</HI> with lessened Force, because the Symptoms of it were of that kind, though in a less Degree; as great <HI>Faintness</HI> and <HI>Inquietudes,</HI> inward <HI>Burning, Pain</HI> in the <HI>Head,</HI> a <HI>De∣lirium</HI> &amp;c. All which were accom∣panied with profuse <HI>Sweats,</HI> and the Disease lasted but 24 hours. And
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>though for want of Care and due Management many died of it; yet, as a learned and wise <HI>Historian</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord</HI> Verulam's <HI>History of</HI> Henry VII.</NOTE> observes, <HI>It appeared rather to be a surprize of Nature than obstinate to Remedies, for if the Patient was kept warm with temperate Cordials, he commonly recovered.</HI></P>
<P>AND I cannot but take Notice, as a Confirmation of what I have been advancing, that we had here the same kind of Fever in the Year 1713, about the Month of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> which was called the <HI>Dun∣kirk Fever,</HI> as being brought by our Soldiers from that Place; where it was indeed a Malignant Disease attended with a <HI>Diarrhaea, Vomit∣ing,</HI> &amp;c. and probably had its Ori∣ginal from the Pestilential Distem∣per, which some time before broke
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>out at <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> But with us was much more mild, beginning only with a Pain in the Head, and by very easy Means went off in large <HI>Sweats,</HI> after a Day's Confinement.</P>
<P>THERE being in every Air a greater Disposition to <HI>Contagion</HI> at one Time than another, we have indeed sometimes felt this Calami∣ty with greater Fury; as particular∣ly the last time in the Year 1665; when it continued in this <HI>City</HI> a∣bout ten Months, and swept away by computation 97306 Persons: But it was generally allowed, that the <HI>Contagion</HI> came by <HI>Cotton</HI> im∣ported from <HI>Turkey</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Hodges de Peste.</NOTE>; and the long Duration of it, I believe, may justly be charged up the unhappy Ma∣nagement of infected Houses, which
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>was then directed by Publick Au∣thority; as I shall shew anon.</P>
<P>AND the History of the most ter∣rible of all the Plagues, that ever were in these Parts of the World, which was that in the Year 1349, gives a manifest Proof from whence all <HI>Europe</HI> may trace the Origine of these Evils, viz. from <HI>Asia:</HI> for
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Histor. Fiorent. di Matteo Villani.</NOTE> This taking its Rise in <HI>China</HI> in the Year 1346, advanced through the East <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Syria, Turkey, Aegypt, Greece, Africa,</HI> &amp;c. In 1347 some Ships from the <HI>Levant</HI> carried it to <HI>Sicily, Pisa, Genoa,</HI> &amp;c. In 1348 it got into <HI>Savoy, Provence, Dauphiny, Catalonia, Castile,</HI> &amp;c. In 1349 it seized <HI>England, Scot∣land, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and in the next place <HI>Germany, Hun∣gary,</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> and in all
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>these Countries made most incredi∣ble Havock.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Considerati∣on of the Air, which we left in a putrid State: It is to be observed, that Putrefaction is a kind of Fer∣mentation, and that all Bodies in a Ferment emit a volatile active Spi∣rit, of Power to agitate, and put into intestine Motions, that is, to change the Nature of other Flu∣ids into which it insinuates it self.</P>
<P>IT were easy to shew from the best <HI>Theory</HI> of Fevers
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bellini de Febrib.</NOTE>, how the Alterations made in the <HI>Blood</HI> this Way will favour <HI>Pestilential</HI> Diseases, by rendring the Body obnoxious to them: But the Digression would be too great.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
<P>THIS is one step towards <HI>Conta∣gion.</HI> The next, as it seems to me, proceeds after this Manner. The Blood in all <HI>Malignant Fevers,</HI> es∣pecially <HI>Pestilential</HI> ones, at the lat∣ter End of the Disease, does like Fermenting Liquors throw off a great Quantity of active Particles upon the several <HI>Glands</HI> of the Bo∣dy, particularly upon those of the Mouth and Skin, from which the Secretions are naturally the most constant and large. These, in <HI>Pe∣stilential</HI> Cases, although the Air be in a right State, will generally infect those, who are very near to the sick Person; otherwise are soon dispersed and lost: But when in an evil Disposition of <HI>This</HI> they meet with the subtle Parts, its Corrup∣tion has generated, by uniting with them they become much more active and powerful, and likewise
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>more durable and lasting, so as to form an <HI>Infectious Matter</HI> capable of conveying the Mischief to a great Distance from the diseased Body, out of which it was produced.</P>
<P>THEY who know what strange Attractions and Combinations are made by volatile Spirits will under∣standing this Reasoning; especially if they consider, how easily all kinds of <HI>Effluvia</HI> are diffused in a warm Air, such as we have described an Infectious one to be; and further, of how penetrating a Force the fi∣nest Parts of Animal Juices are; of which the strange Stench of a mor∣tified Limb, upon a Body yet liv∣ing, will convince any one.</P>
<P>A corrupted State of Air is with∣out doubt necessary to give these <HI>Contagious Atoms</HI> their full Force; for otherwise it were not easy to
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>conceive how the <HI>Plague,</HI> when once it had seized any Place, should ever cease, but with the Destructi∣on of all the Inhabitants: Which is readily accounted for by suppo∣sing an Emendation of the Quali∣ties of the Air, and the restoring of it to a healthy State capable of dissipating and suppressing the Ma∣lignity.</P>
<P>ON the other hand it is evident, that <HI>Infection</HI> is not received from the Air it self, however predisposed, without the Concurrence of some∣thing emitted from <HI>Infected</HI> Per∣sons; because, by strictly prevent∣ing all Intercourse of Infected Pla∣ces with the Neighbourhood, it may be effectually kept from spreading: Whereas the least Wind must ne∣cessarily convey whatever noxious Quality resides in the Air alone, even to a great Distance. Of this
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>we have had a fresh Proof in the present unhappy <HI>Plague</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which, by keeping careful Guard, was confined for a considerable Time within the Walls of <HI>Mar∣seilles;</HI> so that none of the adja∣cent Villages suffered any thing by it; till at length some Persons finding Means to escape carried the Infection along with them. And we find, they have been able, by the like Care, still to restrain it within moderate Bounds.</P>
<P>THIS is the Manner by which Infectious <HI>Effluvia</HI> are generated: The Way, by which a sound Person receives the Injury, I suppose most commonly to be this. These <HI>Conta∣gious</HI> Particles being drawn in with the Air we breath, they taint in their Passage the <HI>Salival</HI> Juices, which being swallowed down into the Stomach presently fix their Ma∣lignity
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>there; as appears from the <HI>Nausea</HI> and <HI>Vomiting,</HI> with which the Distemper often begins its first Attacks. Though I make no Que∣stion but the <HI>Blood</HI> is also more im∣mediately affected by hurtful Parti∣cles being mixed through Inspiration with it in the Lungs.</P>
<P>THE third Way, by which we mentioned <HI>Contagion</HI> to be spread, is by <HI>Goods transported from infected Places.</HI> It has been thought so dif∣ficult to explain the Manner of <HI>this,</HI> that some Authors have ima∣gined <HI>Infection</HI> to be performed by the Means of <HI>Insects,</HI> the <HI>Eggs</HI> of which may be conveyed from Place to Place, and make the Disease when they come to be <HI>hatched.</HI> As this is a supposition grounded upon no manner of Observation, so I think there is no need to have Re∣course to it. If, as we have con∣jectured,
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>the <HI>Matter of Contagion</HI> be an active Substance, perhaps in the Nature of a <HI>Salt,</HI> generated chiefly from the Corruption of a <HI>Humane Body,</HI> it is not hard to conceive how this may be lodged and preserved in soft, porous Bo∣dies, which are kept pressed close together.</P>
<P>WE all know how long a time <HI>Perfumes</HI> hold their <HI>Scent,</HI> if wrapt up in proper Coverings: And it is very remarkable, that the strongest of these, like the <HI>Matter</HI> we are treating of, are mostly <HI>Animal</HI> Juices, as <HI>Mosch, Civet,</HI> &amp;c. and that the Substances found most fit to keep them in, are the very same with those which are most apt to receive and communicate <HI>Infection,</HI> as, <HI>Furrs, Feathers, Silk, Hair, Wool, Cotton, Flax,</HI> &amp;c. the great∣est Part of which are likewise of
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>the Animal Kind; which Remark alone may serve to lead Us a little into the true Nature of <HI>Contagion.</HI></P>
<P>FROM all that has been said, it appears, I think, very plainly, that the <HI>Plague</HI> is a real Poison, which being bred in the Eastern or South∣ern Parts of the World, maintains it self there by circulating from <HI>In∣fected</HI> Persons to Goods; which is chiefly owing to the Negligence of the People in those Countries, who are stupidly Careless in this Affair: That when the Constitution of the Air happens to favour Infection, it rages there with great Violence; That at that Time more especially diseased Persons give it to one ano∣ther, and <HI>Contagious Matter</HI> is lodg∣ed in Goods of a loose and soft Texture, which being packt up, and carried into other Countries, let out, when opened, the impri∣soned
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>Seeds of Contagion: And lastly, That the Air cannot diffuse and spread these to any great Di∣stance, if Intercourse and Commerce with the Place infected be strictly prevented.</P>

<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<HEAD>PART II. OF THE METHODS TO PREVENT <HI>CONTAGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S it is a satisfaction to know, that the <HI>Plague</HI> is not a Native of our Coun∣try, so this is likewise an Encouragement to the utmost Dili∣gence in finding out Means to keep our selves clear from It.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
<P>THIS Caution consists of two Parts: <HI>The preventing its being brought into our Island;</HI> And, if such a Calamity should happen, <HI>The putting a stop to its spreading among us.</HI></P>
<P>THE first of these is provided for by the established Method of obliging Ships, that come from <HI>Infected</HI> Places, to <HI>perform Quaren∣tine:</HI> As to which I think it neces∣sary, that the following Rules be observed.</P>
<P>NEAR to our several Ports, there should be <HI>Lazarettos</HI> built in con∣venient Places, on little Islands if it can so be, for the Reception both of Men and Goods, which arrive from Places suspected of <HI>Infection:</HI> The keeping Men in <HI>Quarentine</HI> on board the Ship being not suffi∣cient;
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>the only Use of which is to observe whether any dye among them. For <HI>Infection</HI> may be pre∣served so long in Cloaths, in which it is once lodged, that as much, nay more of it, if Sickness conti∣nues in the Ship, may be brought on Shoar at the End than at the be∣ginning of the 40 Days: Unless a new <HI>Quarentine</HI> be begun every time any Person dies; which might not end, but with the Destruction of the whole Ship's Crew.</P>
<P>IF there has been any <HI>Contagi∣ous</HI> Distemper in the Ship; The <HI>Sound</HI> Men should leave their Cloaths; which should be burnt; the Men washed and shaved; and having fresh Cloaths, should stay in the <HI>Lazaretto</HI> 30 or 40 Days. The reason of this is, because Per∣sons may be recovered from a Di∣sease themselves, and yet retain
<PB N="23" REF="29"/><HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Infection</HI> about them a considerable Time; as we fre∣quently see the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> taken from those, who have several Days before passed through the Distem∣per.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sick,</HI> if there be any, should be kept in Houses remote from the <HI>Sound;</HI> and some time after they are well, should also be washed and shaved, and have fresh Cloaths; whatever they wore while Sick be∣ing burnt: And then being remov∣ed to the Houses of the <HI>Sound,</HI> should continue there 30 or 40 days.</P>
<P>I am particularly careful to de∣stroy the <HI>Cloaths</HI> of the Sick, be∣cause they Harbour the very <HI>Quint∣essence</HI> of <HI>Contagion.</HI> A very inge∣nious Author
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boccaccio Decameron. Giornat. prim.</NOTE> in his admirable
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>Description of the <HI>Plague</HI> at <HI>Flo∣rence</HI> in the Year 1348, relates what himself saw: That two <HI>Hogs</HI> finding in the Streets the <HI>Rags,</HI> which had been thrown out from off a poor Man dead of the Disease, after snuffling upon them, and tear∣ing them with their Teeth, fell into Convulsions, and dyed in less than an Hour.</P>
<P>IF there has been no Sickness in the Ship, I see no reason why the Men should perform <HI>Quarentine.</HI> Instead of this, they may be washed, and their Cloaths aired in the <HI>La∣zaretto,</HI> as Goods, for one Week.</P>
<P>But the greatest Danger is from such <HI>Goods,</HI> as are apt to retain In∣fection, such as <HI>Cotton, Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax, Paper</HI> or <HI>Books, Silk</HI> of all sorts, <HI>Linen, Wool, Feathers, Hair,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>Skins.</HI> The <HI>Laza∣retto</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>for these should be at a Di∣stance from that for the Men, and they must in convenient Ware∣houses be unpackt, and exposed, as much as may be, to the fresh Air for 40 Days.</P>
<P>THIS may perhaps seem too long; but as we don't know how much Time precisely is necessary to purge the Interstices of Spongy Substances from <HI>infectious Matter</HI> by fresh Air, the Caution cannot be too great in this Point: Unless there could be a Way found out, without hazard∣ing Men's Lives, of trying when Bodies have done emitting the Noxious Fumes; which possibly might be done by putting tender <HI>Animals</HI> near to them, particularly by setting little <HI>Birds</HI> upon the ex∣posed Goods; because it has been observed in Times of the <HI>Plague,</HI> that the Country has been forsaken
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>by the <HI>Birds;</HI> and those kept in Houses have many of them dyed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diemerbroeck de Peste, L. 1. C. 4.</NOTE>. But the Use of this Fancy Expe∣rience only must shew; for I am well aware, that all <HI>Plagues</HI> do not indifferently affect all Kinds of liv∣ing Creatures; on the contrary, most are confined to a particular <HI>Species</HI> of them; like the Disease of the <HI>Black Cattle</HI> a few Years since, which neither proved Infectious to other Brutes, nor to Men.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, that the <HI>Goods</HI> should be <HI>opened,</HI> when they are put into the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> other∣wise their being there will avail nothing. The Misfortune, which happened in the Island of <HI>Bermudas</HI> about 25 Years since, gives a Proof of this; where, as the Account
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>has been given me by the learned Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> a Sack of <HI>Cotton,</HI> put on Shoar by Stealth, lay above a Month without any Prejudice to the People of the House, where it was hid; but when it came to be distributed among the Inhabitants, it carried such a <HI>Contagion</HI> along with it, that the living scarce suf∣ficed to bury the Dead.</P>
<P>INDEED as it has been frequently experienced, that of all the Goods, which harbour <HI>Infection, Cotton</HI> in particular is the most dangerous, and <HI>Turkey</HI> is almost a perpetual <HI>Seminary</HI> of the <HI>Plague;</HI> I cannot but think it highly reasonable, that whatever <HI>Cotton</HI> is imported from that Part of the World, should at all Times be kept in <HI>Quarentine;</HI> because it may have imbibed <HI>In∣fection</HI> at the Time of its packing up, notwithstanding no Mischief
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>has been felt from it by the Ship's Company.</P>
<P>As all reasonable Provisions should be made both for the <HI>Sound</HI> and <HI>Sick,</HI> who perform <HI>Quarentine;</HI> so the strict keeping of it ought to be inforced by the severest <HI>Penalties.</HI> And if a Ship come from any Place, where the <HI>Plague</HI> raged, at the Time of the Ship's Departure from it, with more than usual Violence, it will be the securest Method to <HI>Burn</HI> all the <HI>Goods,</HI> and even the <HI>Ship.</HI></P>
<P>NOR ought this further Caution to be omitted, That when the <HI>Con∣tagion</HI> has ceased in any Place by the approach of Winter, it will not be safe to open a free Trade with It too soon: Because there are In∣stances of the <HI>Distemper's</HI> being stopt by the Winter Cold, and yet the Seeds of it not destroyed, but
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>only kept unactive, till the Warmth of the following Spring has given them new Life and Force. Thus in the great Plague at <HI>Genoa</HI> near 60 Years ago, which continued part of two Years; the first Sum∣mer about 10000 dyed; the Win∣ter following hardly any; but the Summer after no less than 60000. So likewise the last <HI>Plague</HI> at <HI>Lon∣don</HI> began the Autumn before the Year 1665, and was stopt during the Winter by a hard Frost of near three Month's Continuance; so that there remained no further Ap∣pearance of it till the ensuing Spring
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hodges de Peste.</NOTE>. Now if Goods brought from such a Place should retain a∣ny of the latent Contagion, there will be Danger of their producing the same Mischief in the Place, to which they are brought, as they
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>would have caused in that, from whence they came.</P>
<P>BUT above all it is necessary, that the <HI>Clandestine Importing</HI> of Goods be punished with the utmost Ri∣gour; from which wicked Practice I should at this Time apprehend more Danger of bringing the <HI>Di∣sease</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> than by any o∣ther Way whatsoever.</P>
<P>THESE are, I think, the most material Points, to which Regard is to be had in defending ourselves against <HI>Contagion</HI> from other Coun∣tries. The particular Manner of putting these Directions in Execu∣tion, as the <HI>Visiting</HI> of <HI>Ships, Re∣gulation</HI> of <HI>Lazaretto's,</HI> &amp;c. I leave to proper Officers, who ought sometimes to be assisted herein by able Physicians.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
<P>THE next Consideration is, What to do in Case, through a Miscarriage in the publick Care, by the Neglect of Officers, or otherwise, such a Calamity should be suffered to be∣fall us.</P>
<P>THERE is no <HI>Evil</HI> in the World, in which the great Rule of <HI>Resist∣ing the Beginning,</HI> more properly takes Place, than in the present Case; and yet it has unfortunately happened, that the common Steps formerly taken have had a direct Tendency to hinder the putting <HI>this Maxim</HI> in Practice.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Plague</HI> always breaks out in some particular Place, it is cer∣tain, that the Directions of the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> ought to be such, as to make it as much for the In∣terest of Families to discover their
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>Misfortune, as it is, when a House is on <HI>Fire,</HI> to call in the Assistance of the Neighbourhood: Whereas on the contrary, the Methods taken by the Publick, on such Occasions, have always had the Appearance of a severe <HI>Discipline,</HI> and even <HI>Punish∣ment,</HI> rather than of a <HI>Compassi∣onate Care:</HI> Which must naturally make the <HI>Infected</HI> conceal the Dis∣ease as long as was possible.</P>
<P>THE main Import of the <HI>Orders</HI> issued out at these Times was, As soon as it was found, that any House was infected, to keep it shut up, with a <HI>large red Cross,</HI> and <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us</HI> on the Door; and Watchmen attending Day and Night to prevent any one's going in or out, except <HI>Physicians, Surge∣ons, Apothecaries, Nurses, Search∣ers,</HI> &amp;c. allowed by Authority: And this to continue at least a
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>Month after all the Family was <HI>dead</HI> or <HI>recovered</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Directions for the Cure of the</HI> Plague, <HI>by the</HI> College <HI>of</HI> Physicians; <HI>and Orders by the</HI> Lord Mayor <HI>and</HI> Aldermen <HI>of</HI> London, <HI>published</HI> 1665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not easy to conceive a more dismal Scene of Misery, than this; Families seized with a Distemper, which the most of any in the World requires Help and Comfort, lockt up from all their Acquaint∣ance; left it may be to the Treat∣ment of an inhumane Nurse (for such are often found at these Times about the Sick;) and Strangers to every thing but the Melancholy sight of the Progress, Death makes among themselves; with small Hopes of Life, and those mixed with Anxiety and Doubt, whether it be not better to Dye, than to survive the Loss of their best Friends, and nearest Relations.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
<P>IF <HI>Fear, Despair,</HI> and all <HI>De∣jection of Spirits</HI> dispose the Body to receive <HI>Contagion,</HI> and give it a great Power, where it is received, as all Physicians agree they do, I don't see how a Disease can be more enforced, than by such a Treatment.</P>
<P>NOTHING can justify such <HI>Cruel∣ty,</HI> but the Plea, that it is for the Good of the whole <HI>Community,</HI> and prevents the spreading of <HI>In∣fection.</HI> But this upon due Consi∣deration will be found quite other∣wise: For while <HI>Contagion</HI> is kept nursed up in a House, and conti∣nually encreased by the daily Con∣quests it makes, it is impossible but the <HI>Air</HI> should by Degrees become <HI>tainted,</HI> which by opening Win∣dows, &amp;c. will carry the Malig∣nity first from House to House;
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>and then from one Street to ano∣ther. The shutting up Houses in this Manner is only keeping so ma∣ny <HI>Seminaries</HI> of <HI>Contagion,</HI> sooner or later to be dispersed abroad: For the waiting a Month, or longer, from the Death of the last Patient will avail no more, than keeping a <HI>Bale</HI> of infected <HI>Goods</HI> unpack'd; the Poyson will fly out, whenever the <HI>Pandora's Box</HI> is opened.</P>
<P>As these Measures were owing to the Ignorance of the true Nature of <HI>Contagion,</HI> so they did, I firmly believe, contribute very much to the long Continuance of the <HI>Plague,</HI> every time they have been practis∣ed in this City: And no doubt they have had as ill Effects in o∣ther Countries.</P>
<P>IT is therefore no wonder, that great Complaints were sometimes
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>made here against this unreasona∣ble Usage; which, when they pre∣vailed so far, as to procure some Release for the <HI>Sick,</HI> were remark∣ably followed with an Abatement of the Disease. The <HI>Plague</HI> in the Year 1636 began with great Vi∣olence, but Leave being given by the King's Authority for People to quit their Houses; it was ob∣served, That <HI>not one in twenty of the well Persons removed fell Sick, nor one in ten of the Sick dyed</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Discourse upon the Air, by <HI>Tho. Cock.</HI></NOTE>. Which single Instance alone, had there been no other, should have been of Weight ever after to deter∣mine the Magistracy against too strict Confinements. But besides this, a preceding <HI>Plague,</HI> viz. in the Year 1625, affords us another In∣stance of a very remarkable De∣crease upon the discontinuing to
<PB N="37" REF="43"/><HI>shut up</HI> Houses. It was indeed so late in the Year, before this was done, that the near Approach of Winter was doubtless one Reason for the Diminution of the Disease, which followed: Yet this was so very great, that it is at least past dispute, that the Liberty then per∣mitted was no Impediment to it: For this <HI>opening</HI> of the Houses was allowed of in the beginning of <HI>Sep∣tember;</HI> and whereas the last Week in <HI>August,</HI> there dyed no less than 4218, the very next Week the <HI>Burials</HI> were diminuished to 3344, and in no longer time than to the fourth Week after, to 852
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>The shutting up of Houses soberly debated. Anno,</HI> 1665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore the Management in former Times neither answers the Purpose of <HI>discovering the Be∣ginning</HI> of the <HI>Infection,</HI> nor of put∣ting
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>a stop to it when <HI>Discovered,</HI> other Measures are certainly to be taken; which I think should be of this Nature.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of <HI>ignorant old Women,</HI> who are generally appointed <HI>Search∣ers</HI> in Parishes to enquire what Dis∣eases People dye of, That <HI>Office</HI> should be committed to <HI>Under∣standing and Diligent Men,</HI> whose Business it should be, as soon as they find any have dyed after an uncommon Manner, particularly with <HI>livid Spots, Buboes,</HI> or <HI>Car∣buncles,</HI> to give Notice thereof to the Magistrates; who should im∣mediately send skilful Physicians to Visit the Houses in the Neighbour∣hood, especially of the <HI>Poorer</HI> sort, among whom this Evil generally begins; and if upon their Report it appears, that a <HI>Pestilential Di∣stemper</HI> is broke out among the In∣habitants,
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>They should without Delay order all the Families, in which the Sickness is, to be <HI>Re∣moved;</HI> The <HI>Sick</HI> to different Pla∣ces from the <HI>Sound;</HI> but the Houses for both should be three or four Miles out of Town; and the <HI>Sound</HI> People should be <HI>stript of all their Cloaths,</HI> and <HI>washed</HI> and <HI>shaved,</HI> before they go into their new Lodg∣ings.</P>
<P>NO Manner of <HI>Compassion</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> should be wanting to the <HI>Dis∣eased;</HI> to whom, being now in <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>airy</HI> Habitations, there would, with due Cautions, be no great Danger in giving Attendance. All Expences should be paid by the Publick, and no Charges ought to be thought great, which are coun∣terbalanced with the saving a Nati∣on from the greatest of Calamities. Nor does it seem to me at all un∣reasonable,
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>that a <HI>Reward</HI> should be given to the Person, that makes the first Discovery of <HI>Infection</HI> in any Place; since it is undeniable, that the making known the <HI>Evil</HI> to those, who are provided with proper Methods against it, is the first and main Step towards the o∣vercoming it.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Sick Families</HI> are gone, all the Goods of the Houses, in which they were, should be <HI>burnt;</HI> nay the Houses themselves; if that can conveniently be done. And after this all possible Care ought still to be taken to remove whatever Causes are found to breed and pro∣mote <HI>Contagion.</HI> In order to this, the <HI>Overseers</HI> of the Poor (who might be assisted herein by other Officers) should visit the Dwellings of all the meaner sort of the Inha∣bitants, and where they find
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>them <HI>stifled up too close</HI> and <HI>nasty,</HI> should lessen their Number by send∣ing some into better Lodgings, and should take Care, by all Man∣ner of Provision and Encourage∣ment, to make them more <HI>cleanly</HI> and <HI>sweet.</HI></P>
<P>NO good Work carries its own Reward with it so much as this kind of <HI>Charity;</HI> and therefore be the Expence what it will, it must never be thought unreasonable. For nothing approaches so near to the first Original of <HI>Contagion,</HI> as Air pent up, loaded with Damps, and corrupted with the Filthiness, that proceeds from <HI>Animal Bodies.</HI></P>
<P>OUR common <HI>Prisons</HI> afford us an Instance of this, in which very few escape, what they call the <HI>Goal Fever,</HI> which is always at∣tended with a Degree of <HI>Maligni∣ty</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>in proportion to the <HI>Closeness</HI> and <HI>Stench</HI> of the Place: And it would certainly very well become the Wis∣dom of the Government, as well with Regard to the Health of the <HI>Town,</HI> as in Compassion to the <HI>Pri∣soners,</HI> to take Care, that all <HI>Houses of Confinement</HI> should be kept as Airy and Clean, as is consistent with the Use, to which they are designed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Black Assize</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> held in the Castle there in the Year 1577, will never be forgot
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden. Annal. Regin. Elizab.</NOTE>; at which the <HI>Judges, Gentry,</HI> and almost all that were present, to the Number of 300, were killed by a <HI>poysonous Steam,</HI> thought by some to have broke forth from the <HI>Earth;</HI> but by a <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>great</HI> Philosopher
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord Verulam,</HI> Natural History, <HI>Cent.</HI> 10. <HI>Num.</HI> 914.</NOTE>
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>more justly supposed to have been brought by the <HI>Prisoners</HI> out of the <HI>Goal</HI> into <HI>Court;</HI> it being observed, that they alone were not injured by it.</P>
<P>AT the same time, that this Care is taken of <HI>Houses,</HI> the pro∣per Officers should be strictly charg∣ed to see that the <HI>Streets</HI> be washed and kept clean from <HI>Filth, Carrion,</HI> and all Manner of <HI>Nusances;</HI> which should be carried away in the <HI>Night Time;</HI> nor should the <HI>Laystalls</HI> be suffered to be too near the City. <HI>Beggars</HI> and <HI>Idle Persons</HI> should be taken up, and such miserable Ob∣jects, as are neither fit for the common <HI>Hospitals,</HI> nor <HI>Work-houses,</HI> should be provided for in an <HI>Hos∣pital of Incurables.</HI></P>
<P>ORDERS indeed of this kind are necessary to be observed at all times,
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>especially in populous Cities; and therefore I am sorry to take No∣tice, that in <HI>these</HI> of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> there is no good <HI>Po∣lice</HI> established in these Respects; for want of which the Citizens and Gentry are every Day annoyed more ways than one.</P>
<P>IF these early <HI>Precautions,</HI> we have mentioned, take Effect, there will be no need of any Methods for <HI>Correcting the Air, Purifying Houses,</HI> or of <HI>Rules for preserving particular Persons from Infection:</HI> To all which, if the <HI>Plague</HI> get head, so that the <HI>Sick</HI> are too many to be removed, Regard must be had.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first; Fire</HI> has been al∣most universally recommended for this Purpose, both by the Anci∣ents and Moderns; who have ad∣vised to make frequent and nume∣rous
<PB N="45" REF="51"/><HI>Fires</HI> in the Towns infected: By which Means, it is said, <HI>Hip∣pocrates</HI> preserved <HI>Greece</HI> from a <HI>Plague,</HI> which was entring into it from <HI>Aethiopia</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galen. de Theriac. cap. 16.</NOTE>. And it is cer∣tain, that some evil Dispositions of the Air, particularly such as pro∣ceed from <HI>Damps, Exhalations,</HI> &amp;c. may be corrected by <HI>Fire,</HI> and the Predisposition of it to receive <HI>Infection</HI> from these Causes sometimes removed. But when the Distemper is actually <HI>begun,</HI> and rages, since it is known to be <HI>spread</HI> and <HI>increased</HI> by the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Summer,</HI> and on the con∣trary checked by the <HI>cold</HI> in <HI>Win∣ter;</HI> undoubtedly, whatever increases that <HI>Heat</HI> will so far add Force to the Disease. Whether the Service <HI>Fires</HI> may do by correcting any other ill Qualities of the Air will
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>counterbalance the Inconvenience upon this Account, Experience on∣ly can determine; and the Fatal success of the Tryals made here in the last <HI>Plague,</HI> is more than sufficient to discourage any further Attempts of this Nature; for <HI>Fires</HI> being ordered in all the <HI>Streets</HI> for three Days together, there dyed in one Night following no less than 4000; whereas in any single Week before or after, not much above three times that Number were car∣ryed off
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hodges <HI>de Peste,</HI> pag. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT has been said of <HI>Fires,</HI> is likewise to be understood of <HI>firing of Guns,</HI> which some have too rash∣ly advised. The proper Correcti∣on of the Air would be to make it <HI>fresh</HI> and <HI>cool.</HI> Accordingly the
<PB N="47" REF="53"/><HI>Arabians</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhazes de re Medica, lib. 10. c. 16.</NOTE>, who were best acquaint∣ed with the Nature of <HI>Pestilences,</HI> advise People to keep themselves as <HI>airy</HI> as possible, and to chuse Dwellings exposed to the Wind.</P>
<P>FOR keeping <HI>Houses</HI> cool, they took to be the best Method of <HI>purifying</HI> them; and therefore to answer this End more fully, they directed to strew them with <HI>cooling</HI> Herbs, as <HI>Roses, Violets, Water-Lillies,</HI> &amp;c. and to be washed with <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Vinegar;</HI> than all which, especially the last, nothing more proper can be proposed: Though it be directly contrary to what Mo∣dern Authors mostly advise, which is to make Fumes with hot Things, as <HI>Benzoin, Frankincense, Asa Foe∣tida, Storax,</HI> &amp;c. from which I see no reason to expect any Virtue
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>to destroy the Matter of <HI>Infection,</HI> or to keep particular Places from a Disposition to receive it; which are the only things here to be aimed at. It is of more Consequence to be observed, that as <HI>Nastiness</HI> is a great Source of <HI>Infection,</HI> so <HI>Clean∣liness</HI> is the greatest Preservative: Which is the true Reason, why the Poor are most obnoxious to Dis∣asters of this Kind.</P>
<P>THE next thing after the <HI>purifying of Houses,</HI> is to consider by what Means particular <HI>Persons</HI> may best defend themselves against <HI>Contagi∣on;</HI> for the effectual doing of which it would be necessary to put the <HI>Humours</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> into such a State, as not to be alterable by the <HI>Matter of Infection.</HI> But since this is no more to be hoped for, than a <HI>Specific Preservative</HI> from the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> the most that can be
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>done, will be to keep the <HI>Body</HI> in such Order, that it may suffer as little as possible. The <HI>first Step</HI> to∣wards which, is to maintain a good State of Health, in which we are always least liable to suffer by any external Injuries; and not to weaken the Body by Evacuations. The <HI>next</HI> is, to guard against all <HI>Dejecti∣on of Spirits,</HI> and <HI>immoderate Pas∣sions;</HI> for these we daily observe do expose Persons to the more com∣mon <HI>Contagion</HI> of the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> These Ends will be best answered by living with Temperance upon a good generous Diet, and avoiding <HI>Fastings, Watchings, extreme Weari∣ness,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Another</HI> Defence is, to use whatever Means are proper to keep the <HI>Blood</HI> from <HI>Inflaming.</HI> This, if it does not secure from <HI>contracting Infection,</HI> will at least make the <HI>Effects</HI> of it less violent.
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>The most proper Means for this, according to the Advice of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Physicians, is the repeat∣ed Use of <HI>acid Fruits,</HI> as <HI>Pomegra∣nates, Sevil Oranges, Lemons, tart Apples,</HI> &amp;c. But above all of <HI>Wine-Vinegar</HI> in small Quantities, ren∣dered grateful to the Stomach by the Infusion of some such Ingre∣dients as <HI>Gentian Root, Galangal, Zedoary, Juniper Berries,</HI> &amp;c. Which Medicines by correcting the <HI>Vine∣gar,</HI> and taking off some ill Effects it might otherwise have upon the Stomach, will be of good Use: But these, and all other hot <HI>Aro∣matic</HI> Drugs, though much recom∣mended by Authors, if used alone, are most likely to do hurt by <HI>over heating</HI> the Blood.</P>
<P>BUT since none of these Methods promise any certain Protection; as
<PB N="51" REF="57"/><HI>leaving</HI> the Place infected is the surest <HI>Preservative,</HI> so the next to it, is to avoid, as much as may be, the <HI>near Approach</HI> to the <HI>Sick,</HI> or to such as have but <HI>lately Recover∣ed.</HI> For the greater Security here∣in, it will be advisable to avoid all <HI>Crouds of People.</HI> Nay it should be the Care of the <HI>Magistrate</HI> to prohibit all unnecessary <HI>Assemblies;</HI> and likewise to oblige all, who get over the Disease, to <HI>Confine</HI> them∣selves for some time, before they appear abroad.</P>
<P>THE Advice to keep at a Di∣stance from the <HI>Sick,</HI> is also to be understood of the <HI>Dead Bodies:</HI> which should be <HI>buried</HI> at as great a Distance from Dwelling Houses, as may be; put <HI>deep</HI> in the Earth; and <HI>covered</HI> with the exactest Care. They should likewise be <HI>carried out</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>in the <HI>Night,</HI> while they are yet fresh and free from Putrefaction: Because a Carcass not yet begin∣ning to Corrupt, if kept from the Heat of the Day, hardly emits any kind of Steam or Vapour.</P>
<P>As for those, who must of ne∣cessity attend the <HI>Sick;</HI> some fur∣ther Directions should be added for their Use. These may be com∣prehended in two short Precepts. <HI>One</HI> is, not to <HI>swallow their Spittle</HI> while they are about the <HI>Sick,</HI> but rather to <HI>spit</HI> it out: <HI>The other,</HI> not so much as to <HI>draw in their Breath,</HI> when they are very near them. The reason for both these appears from what has been said above con∣cerning the Manner, in which a sound Person receives the Infecti∣on.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
<P>THIS is the Sum of what I think most likely to stop the Progress of the <HI>Disease</HI> in any Place, where it shall have got Admittance. If some few of these <HI>Rules</HI> refer more par∣ticularly to the City of <HI>London,</HI> with small Alteration they may be applied to any other <HI>Place.</HI> It now remains therefore only to lay down some Directions to hinder the <HI>Distemper's</HI> spreading from <HI>Town</HI> to <HI>Town.</HI> The best Method for which, where it can be done, is to cast up a <HI>Line</HI> about the <HI>Town insected,</HI> at a convenient Distance; and by placing a <HI>Guard,</HI> to hin∣der People's passing from it with∣out due Regulation, to other Towns: But not absolutely to for∣bid any to withdraw themselves, as they have now done in <HI>France,</HI> ac∣cording to the usual Practice abroad;
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>which is an unnecessary Severity, not to call it a Cruelty. I think it will be enough, if all, who desire to pass the <HI>Line,</HI> be permitted to do it, upon Condition they first per∣form <HI>Quarentine</HI> for about 20 Days in <HI>Tents,</HI> or other more conveni∣ent <HI>Habitations.</HI> But the greatest Care must be taken, that none pass without conforming themselves to this Order, both by keeping di∣ligent <HI>Watch,</HI> and by <HI>punishing</HI> with the utmost Severity, any that shall either have done so, or at∣tempt it. And the better to disco∣ver <HI>such,</HI> it will be requisite to o∣blige all, who travel in any Part of the Country, under the same Penalties, to carry with them <HI>Cer∣tificates</HI> either of their coming from Places not <HI>Infected,</HI> or of their pas∣sing the <HI>Line</HI> by permission.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
<P>THIS I take to be a more effectu∣al Method to keep the <HI>Infection</HI> from spreading, than the absolute refusing a Passage to People upon any Terms. For when Men are in such imminent Danger of their Lives, where they are; many, no doubt, if not otherwise allowed to escape, will use Endeavours to do it secretly, let the Hazard be ever so great. And it can hardly be, but some will succeed in their At∣tempts; as we see fell out in <HI>France</HI> notwithstanding all their Care. But one that gets off thus clandestine∣ly, will be more like to carry the Distemper with him, than twenty, nay a hundred, that go away un∣der the preceding Restrictions: E∣specially because the <HI>Infection</HI> of the Place, he flies from, will by this Management be rendered much
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>more intense. For confining Peo∣ple, and shutting them up together in great Numbers, will make the Distemper rage with augmented Force, even to the increasing it be∣yond what can be easily imagin∣ed; As appears from the <HI>Account,</HI> which the learned <HI>Gassendus</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notitia Ecclefiae Dinienfis.</NOTE> has given us of a memorable <HI>Plague,</HI> which happened at <HI>Digne</HI> in <HI>Pro∣vence,</HI> where he lived, in the Year 1619. This was so terrible, that in one <HI>Summer</HI> out of <HI>ten thousand</HI> Inhabitants, it left but <HI>fifteen hun∣dred,</HI> and of them all but <HI>five</HI> or <HI>six</HI> had gone through the <HI>Disease.</HI> And he assigns <HI>this,</HI> as the princi∣pal Cause of the great Destruction, That the Citizens were too closely confined, and not suffered so much as to go to their Country Houses.
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>Whereas in another <HI>Pestilence,</HI> which broke out in the same Place a year and half after, more Liberty being allowed, there did not dye above <HI>one hundred</HI> Persons.</P>
<P>FOR these Reasons, I think, to allow People with proper <HI>Cautions</HI> to remove from an infected Place, is the best Means to suppress the <HI>Contagion,</HI> as well as the most humane Treatment of the present Sufferers: But though Liberty ought to be given to the <HI>People,</HI> yet no sort of <HI>Goods</HI> must by any means be suffered to be carried over the <HI>Line,</HI> which are made of <HI>Mate∣rials</HI> retentive of <HI>Infection.</HI> For in the present Case, when <HI>In∣fection</HI> has seized any Part of a Country, much greater Care ought to be taken, that no <HI>Seeds</HI> of the <HI>Contagion</HI> be conveyed about, than
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>when the Distemper is at a great Distance; because a <HI>Bale of Goods,</HI> which shall have imbibed the <HI>Con∣tagious Aura</HI> when packt up in <HI>Turkey,</HI> or any remote Parts; yet, when unpackt here, may chance to meet with so healthful a Tempe∣rament of our Air, that it shall not do much hurt. But when the Air of any one of our Towns shall be so corrupted, as to spread and maintain the <HI>Pestilence</HI> in it, there will be little reason to believe, that the Air of the rest of the Country is in a much better State.</P>
<P>FOR the same Reason <HI>Quaren∣tines</HI> should more strictly be en∣joined, when the <HI>Plague</HI> is in a bordering Kingdom, than when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s more remote.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
<P>I have gone through the chief Branches of <HI>Preservation</HI> against the <HI>Plague.</HI> And shall only add, that if the <HI>Burning of Goods,</HI> which has been proposed, be thought a∣ny Way <HI>offensive</HI> or <HI>inconvenient,</HI> The <HI>Burying</HI> of them six Feet, or more, under Ground may answer the Purpose as well.</P>
<P>WHAT has been said of the <HI>Na∣ture of Contagion,</HI> upon which the foregoing Directions are grounded, may also be of Use towards e∣stablishing a better Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> than <HI>Authors</HI> have common∣ly taught: But to engage in this is beyond the present Design.</P>
