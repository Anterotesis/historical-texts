<HEAD>A Short Introduction TO THE Following OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Compiler</HI> of the ensuing brief <HI>Collections,</HI> having met with several Particulars in the most approved <HI>Authors</HI> that have wrote upon the Subject of the <HI>Plague,</HI> which he conceiv'd might afford some agreeable En∣tertainment to the <HI>Curious,</HI> and tend to the further Illustration of some Parts of that excellent <HI>Discourse</HI> whereunto they have a <HI>Reference,</HI> and also be of some general Advantage in case divine <HI>Providence</HI> should for our <HI>Sins</HI> visit us with that sore <HI>Distemper,</HI> does here offer them to the View of the <HI>Publick,</HI> hoping that the many <HI>Defects</HI> will be excused and forgiven, which will be easily discerned in so <HI>Inaccurate</HI> a <HI>Composure,</HI> put together in great Straits of Time, by <HI>One,</HI> who pretends to little more than barely to perform the Of∣fice of an <HI>Index,</HI> in pointing at some Things which occurred to him in turning over <HI>Books</HI> that he thought worthy of some Notice; and that his honest Intentions will be taken in good part by all Candid Ingenuous <HI>Readers;</HI> and that such as have greater <HI>Abilities</HI> and <HI>Opportunities</HI> will be excited to apply

<HEAD>SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE PLAGUE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S to the <HI>Original</HI> of this dire∣ful Scourge of Mankind call'd the <HI>Plague,</HI> I find the most learned <HI>Physicians</HI> are much divided in their <HI>O∣pinions</HI> concerning it, and those who have searched ve∣ry far into the Secrets of <HI>Nature</HI> do yet ingenuously acknowledge themselves to be very much at a loss about it. The great Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> freely and ful∣ly confesses his <HI>own</HI> and his <HI>Brethren's</HI> Ignorance in this Matter, and that not without a <HI>Smart</HI> Re∣flection upon such as pretend to know more than their Neighbours, in this and other Particulars of the same abstruse Nature. In <HI>Chap.</HI> 2 d. <HI>Page</HI> 71. of his Works, he thus expresses himself. <HI>At verò quae, qualisque sit, illa aeris Dispositio à quâ mor∣bificus hic apparatus promanat, nos, pariter ac com∣plura alia circa quae vecors ac arrogans Philoso∣phantium
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>turbanugatur, planè ignoramus.</HI> Words so <HI>severe</HI> and so <HI>discouraging</HI> to any <HI>Enquiries</HI> of this Kind, that I shall chuse to leave them as I find them.</P>
<P>I must here indeed freely own that I am much pleased with the <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity</HI> of the lear∣ned and diligent <HI>Diemerbroeck,</HI> who after a large Recital and Examination of the several <HI>Hypotheses</HI> that had been advanced before his Time concern∣ing the Origine of the <HI>Plague,</HI> and after weighing the Arguments and Reasons brought by their re∣spective Patrons for the Support of them, declares himself wholly dissatisfied with them all, in the eight Chapter of his first Book and the Annotations there∣on; and after all, he has Recourse to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the great <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> (the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Phy∣sicians,</HI>) and endeavours to make it appear that something supernatural or preternatural is to be un∣derstood thereby, and that <HI>That</HI> ancient <HI>Sage</HI> (tho' guided only by the Light of natural Reason) inten∣ded to signifie by that Term, somewhat sent down from angry <HI>Heaven,</HI> as a just Punishment for the Wickedness of Men.</P>
<P>But it may not be improper to add something un∣der this <HI>Head</HI> from that great <HI>Christian Philoso∣pher,</HI> and (while he lived) illustrious <HI>Ornament</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> never to be men∣tioned without a Preface of Honour. This <HI>Curi∣ous</HI> and <HI>Critical,</HI> but <HI>Sober</HI> and <HI>Modest</HI> Enquirer into the Powers of <HI>Nature,</HI> and Operations of <HI>Se∣cond Causes,</HI> in his Occasional Disquisition concer∣ning the <HI>Original</HI> of the <HI>Plague,</HI> wisely chuses the middle Way, between those who recur wholly to supernatural <HI>Causes,</HI> and those who impute all to na∣tural <HI>Ones,</HI> in their Accounts hereof: He observes,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>in his <HI>Experimental Discourse</HI> concerning the <HI>In∣salubrity</HI> and <HI>Salubrity</HI> of the <HI>Air, Page</HI> 50. &amp;c. That the <HI>Sacred Writings</HI> expresly teach that some <HI>Plagues</HI> have been in an extraordinary Manner in∣flicted by <HI>God,</HI> particularly <HI>That</HI> which in <HI>David's</HI> Time swept away in three Days <HI>Seventy Thousand</HI> Men. But <HI>He</HI> seems to think that it is carrying the Matter too far to infer from hence, or to affirm po∣sitively that <HI>All</HI> are so. <HI>I have sometimes suspect∣ed</HI> (says he, Page 52.) <HI>that in the Controversie concerning the Origine of the Plague whether it be Natural or Supernatural, neither of the contend∣ing Parties is altogether in the Right, since 'tis very possible that some Pestilences may not break forth without an extraordinary Interposition of Almighty God, provoked by the Sins of Men; and yet other Plagues may be produced by a tragical Con∣course of merely natural Causes.</HI> But we are not to think that by this last Expression <HI>He</HI> meant to exclude the Superior Agency or Superintendency of the <HI>First</HI> in any <HI>Case;</HI> for no <HI>Man</HI> can express a more becoming and awful Sense of, or an higher Reverence for the <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Causes,</HI> than <HI>this</HI> great <HI>Genius</HI> does in all his Writings; and I could heartily wish that <HI>He</HI> were more generally imitated herein by the <HI>Virtuosi</HI> of the present <HI>Age,</HI> and that a more explicit Reference to <HI>Divine Providence</HI> were to be found in all their Researches into <HI>Nature:</HI> And I cannot but hope that it would very much contri∣bute hereunto, if our Modern <HI>Wits</HI> would seri∣ously read and consider that excellent <HI>Treatise</HI> cal∣led the <HI>Christian Virtuoso,</HI> written by this <HI>Noble Author.</HI> But to return from this (I hope not un∣useful) <HI>Digression:</HI> As to Mr. <HI>Boyle's</HI> Opinion concerning the Rise of <HI>Ordinary Plagues,</HI> it is in
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>short <HI>This: He</HI> inclines to think that the <HI>Malig∣nant Disposition</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> whereby the <HI>Plague</HI> is propagated, if not first produced, is imputable to some Kind of <HI>Subterraneal Expirations,</HI> and par∣ticularly to <HI>Arsenical Fumes;</HI> but as to this <HI>He</HI> is far from being Positive, or Dogmatical: What <HI>He</HI> offers to render this Conjecture probable, they that please may see, in his <HI>Discourse</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> as to its Unhealthfulness or Healthfulness, already men∣tioned. Thus far as to the <HI>Origine</HI> of the <HI>Plague.</HI></P>
<P>What the Learned Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> advances, about the Beginning of <HI>Page</HI> 4. of his Discourse, in these Words; <HI>[Nor do I think that in this Island particularly, there is any one Instance of a Pestilential Disease among us of great Consequence, which we did not receive from other Iufected Places:]</HI> is perfectly agrecable to the Opinion of the celebrated <HI>Syden∣ham,</HI> who observes, that to the evil Disposition of the <HI>Air,</HI> which proceeds (according to <HI>Him</HI>) from a latent unknown <HI>Cause,</HI> there must be joyned the Reception of some <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Infection</HI> flowing from some <HI>Plaguy</HI> Body, and received either <HI>immediately</HI> by a near Approximation to it, or else <HI>mediately</HI> by the Means of some <HI>Fomes</HI> transmitted thencefrom into something apt to receive and retain the same, and transferred therewith to distant Places; until by the great Number of infected Bodies, the <HI>Air</HI> receives such a <HI>Taint,</HI> [or rather is so charged and loaded with <HI>Poisonous Particles</HI>] as suffices to pro∣pagate the <HI>Contagion</HI> to some Distance, without any other Spark to kindle the spreading Fire. The Sub∣stance of this may be seen in <HI>Page</HI> 72. of his Works.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 7. the <HI>Doctor</HI> briefly mentions that most terrible <HI>Plague</HI> which carried <HI>Death</HI> over the greatest Part of the then known <HI>World,</HI> about the
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>Middle of the fourteenth <HI>Century,</HI> the History of which being very remarkable (especially if all the Circumstances related by <HI>Authors</HI> of considerable Note be true) I shall present the Reader with a somewhat larger <HI>Narrative</HI> of it, as very proper to affect us with a pious Awe and Fear of the Wrath and Vengeance of a righteous <HI>God,</HI> and also to give us a melancholy and humbling Representation of the horrid <HI>Degeneracy</HI> of humane Nature, and the des∣perate Obstinacy of irreclaimably <HI>Wicked Men.</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> in <HI>Page</HI> 69. of the forementioned Dis∣course has given a brief Account of this prodigious <HI>Pestilence,</HI> from that excellent French Historian <HI>Mousieur de Mezeray,</HI> who (as he tells us) relates in the Life of <HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> that the <HI>Plague</HI> which happened in <HI>France</HI> in the Year 1346, was so Contagious and Destructive, that scarce a Village or even a House escaped uninfected by it: <HI>He</HI> adds, that this <HI>Pestilence</HI> began two Years before in the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> by a Vapour that was most horribly stinking, which brake out of the Earth like a Kind of <HI>Subterraneal Fire;</HI> and devoured above 200 Leagues of that Country, even to the very Trees and Stones, and infected the <HI>Air</HI> in a wonderful Manner: From <HI>Cathay</HI> (says he) it passed into <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> thence into <HI>Africa,</HI> afterwards into <HI>Europe,</HI> which it ransack'd throughout. Thus far Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> from <HI>Mezeray,</HI> in whose Account the Date of the Year seems to have been mistaken, or 1346 misprinted for 1348, or 1349. For by Dr. <HI>Mead</HI>'s and the following Account, it began in <HI>Ca∣thay,</HI> (the Northern Part of <HI>China</HI>) in 1346.</P>
<P>Besides what I have quoted from Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> I shall entertain the Reader with a more Circumstan∣tial Relation of this most fearful Calamity which I
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>met in <HI>Kircher's Chronology</HI> of the most remarka∣ble <HI>Plagues</HI> that are recorded in <HI>History,</HI> annexed to his <HI>Scrutinium Physico-Medicum contagiosae Lu∣is, quae Pestis dicitur.</HI> The <HI>Substance</HI> of what he writes is this; That in the <HI>Poutificate</HI> of <HI>Clement</HI> the sixth, <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth being <HI>Emperor,</HI> there raged a most cruel <HI>Pestilence,</HI> the worst that ever was, scarcely the third Part of Mortals being left alive. It so prevailed every where, that <HI>God</HI> seemed as if he would destroy all Mankind by a general Ru∣ine, as of old in the universal <HI>Deluge. Villanius</HI> tells us that it had its first Rise in the <HI>Ʋpper Asia,</HI> and particularly in the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> in the Year 1346, from a most filthy Smell supposed to proceed from a certain <HI>Fiery Body,</HI> which either fell from <HI>Heaven,</HI> or broke out of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and extended its horrible and terrifying <HI>Bulk</HI> to so vast a Compass, that it consumed every thing that stood in its Way, Animals, Houses, Trees, &amp;c. for the Space of fifteen Days Journey: And some most filthy lit∣tle <HI>Beasts</HI> furnished with Feet and Tails, [by this Description they seem to have been a Sort of <HI>Neuts</HI> or <HI>Lizards</HI>] as also <HI>Worms,</HI> and a small Sort of <HI>Snakes</HI> in a numberless Multitude, fell at the same Time from the Air upon the Earth, the Stench and Putrefaction whereof infected the whole <HI>Region.</HI> A <HI>Pestilence</HI> hence arising invaded the adjacent Pla∣ces, and then spread it self to the remoter Cities and Provinces, so that it depopulated all <HI>Asia.</HI> After∣wards it penetrated into <HI>Egypt, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Thence it passed over into <HI>France, Spain</HI> and <HI>En∣gland,</HI> and at length into <HI>Germany, Poland</HI> and all the <HI>Northern Parts,</HI> with the Destruction of innu∣merable Persons. In the City of <HI>Florence</HI> only, <HI>Villanius</HI> says there perished 60000, but St. <HI>An∣thony</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>makes them 100000; and although such a dreadful <HI>Contagion</HI> was sent among Men by the a∣venging Hand of <HI>God</HI> for their enormous Wicked∣ness, yet after so great a Calamity those that suc∣ceeded and came greedily into the Possession of such rich Inheritances as the deceased had left, grew worse and more wicked than ever. Many Prodigies pre∣ceded this <HI>Plague</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> such as horrible Clefts, or swallowing Gulfs in the Earth exhaling a poi∣sonous Wind or Vapour, and other Things of the like Sort. Thus far <HI>Kircher.</HI> Page 247.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> If that Part of the Story be Fact concer∣ning the Worms, Snakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are said to have fallen from the Air, it seems to me much more probable that they were hatch'd from Eggs that had been formerly laid on the Earth, or Leaves of Plants, by Animals and Insects of that Kind; the Disposition of the Air, which was filled with the Steams of that horrible <HI>Meteor</HI> before mentioned, perhaps greatly contributing to their Generation or quickning in such vast Numbers.</P>
<P>This most fearful <HI>Plague</HI> is also taken Notice of by many other <HI>Chronologers. Alstedius</HI> relates that at <HI>Lubeck</HI> it carried off 90000. And that of the Bare-footed <HI>Monks</HI> in several Parts it destroyed so great a Number that in the whole their Dead amoun∣ted to 1244434; and the same Particular is mentio∣ned by <HI>Hogelius</HI> in his <HI>Horologium Historicum,</HI> Page 632. who tells us also, that at <HI>Erford</HI> there died such Multitudes that the burying Places in the City being all fill'd with Carcases, 12000 were laid in eleven Caves under the <HI>Mountain</HI> called the <HI>Red Moun∣tain.</HI> Page 650.</P>
<P>Many other destructive <HI>Pestilences</HI> before and after this are mentioned by Historians, and se∣veral
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>of the later Ones particularly described by Learned Physicians, as That at <HI>Delft</HI> in 1557 by <HI>Forestus,</HI> That at <HI>Vicenza</HI> by <HI>Massaria</HI> in 1576, That at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> in 1636 by <HI>Diemerbroeck,</HI> and the last very terrible One at <HI>London</HI> in 1665 by <HI>Hodges,</HI> which they that please may consult.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 11. towards the End, the <HI>Learned Au∣thor</HI> just mentions the Opinion of some who have thought that the <HI>Pestilential Contagion</HI> or <HI>Infecti∣on</HI> is propagated by the Means of <HI>Insects,</HI> whose <HI>Eggs</HI> may easily be conveyed from Place to Place, and produce the Disease when they come to be hatched: But he observes withal that this is a <HI>Supposition</HI> groun∣ded upon no manner of <HI>Observation,</HI> and that there is no Need to have Recourse to it. As to this <HI>Hypothe∣sis</HI> of poysonous <HI>Insects</HI> giving Rise to the <HI>Plague,</HI> it has been lately insisted on by Mr. <HI>Bradley,</HI> who in his <HI>new</HI> (and indeed very ingenious and useful) <HI>Improvements of Planting and Gardening</HI> Reprin∣ted here, has published a Letter from Mr. <HI>Robert Ball</HI> containing several curicus Observations which seem to him to render it highly probable; and in a small Tract lately published by Mr. <HI>Bradley,</HI> the Title of which is, <HI>The Plague at Marseilles consi∣dered,</HI> he has pursued the same <HI>Conjecture,</HI> and tran∣scribed the <HI>Substance</HI> of what is to be found in the <HI>Book</HI> and <HI>Letter</HI> already mentioned upon the Head of <HI>Insects.</HI></P>
<P>This Notion seems to be much a-kin to that which was advanced by <HI>Athanasius Kircher</HI> (that famous <HI>Enquirer</HI> into Nature, sufficiently known to the lear∣ned World by his Voluminous Labours) in the for∣mer <HI>Century,</HI> and he seems to have taken the Hint from the noted <HI>Cardan,</HI> for in <HI>Page</HI> 52. of his <HI>Scruti∣nium Pestis,</HI> he tells us, that <HI>Cardan</HI> relates that in his
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>Time (who flourished about the Middle of the six-teenth <HI>Age</HI>) there was a most cruel <HI>Pestilence</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> arising (as he conjectures) from an infinite Number of little Worms: Of these <HI>Vermiculi Kir∣cher</HI> discourses very largely in his Treatise of the <HI>Plague,</HI> bothbefore and after thenowmention'd Quo∣tation from <HI>Cardan;</HI> and particularly in <HI>Page</HI> 141. he speaks of the <HI>Plague</HI> as something which he hadshewn to be <HI>Animated,</HI> because of those <HI>Animalcula</HI> which hetakes to be often, if not always, the <HI>Seminary</HI> there∣of, concerning which he thus expresses himself; <HI>Sunt autem hi Vermiculi Pestis propagatores, tam exigui, tam tenues et subtiles, ut omnem sensûs captum cludant;</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Substance</HI> of what he says is this; That these little <HI>Worms</HI> which he supposes to be the <HI>Spreaders,</HI> if not wholly the <HI>Breeders</HI> of the <HI>Plague,</HI> are so exceeding <HI>Small</HI> that they are to the Sense and Sight imperceptible and undiscernable, unless it be by the Help of the most exquisite <HI>Microscopes,</HI> and for their Smalness may be called <HI>Atoms,</HI> but they encrease so prodigiously that their Numbers are beyond Compute. These <HI>Vermiculi,</HI> as they are generated <HI>(Ex putredine)</HI> out of Corruption, so they are easily thrust forth by all the Pores of the Body in which they are, toge∣ther with the sweaty <HI>Vapours,</HI> and are carried along with the slightest Motion of the Air in vast Swarms, like the Motes that may be seen plying to and fro in the Sun Beams, when they shine into a Room that is somewhat obscure thro' a Hole. These <HI>Insects</HI> (he supposes) do tenaciously adhere to any Thing they meet with, and insinuate themselves into the smallest Pores of Bodies; and to render all this more probable, he says, that he has oft found the <HI>Blood</HI> taken from Persons labouring under <HI>Putrid Fevers</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>so full of <HI>Worms,</HI> within an Hour or two after the Emission, as even astonished him, from whence he perswades himself that <HI>Man</HI> may (not only after his Death, but even) while alive be plentifully stored with such Vile <HI>Animalcules,</HI> tho' the Sense cannot discern them, and that, on this, as well as other Ac∣counts, <HI>Job</HI> speaks as he does. <HI>Chap.</HI> 17.14 <HI>[I have said to Corruption thou art my Father: to the Worm thou art my Mother and my Sister.]</HI> He goes on to shew that this <HI>Verminose Brood,</HI> which (according to his O∣pinion) is cast forth in very great Quantity both from the <HI>Living</HI> Bodies of such as are infected with the <HI>Plague,</HI> and from the Carcases of the <HI>Dead</HI> when they begin to putrifie, being received into the innermost Parts of Linen and Woolen Cloaths, and the like, are there cherished, and therewith conveyed to distant Places, and that this is the first and principal <HI>Semi∣nary</HI> of the whole <HI>Contagion;</HI> as he endeavours to shew more at large: But such as desire further Infor∣mation as to this Particular, must have Recourse to the Book it self, for it would require much more Time and Room, than can be allowed at present but to make an Abridgement of his copious Discourse about it in several Parts of the said Treatise. This <HI>Hypothesis</HI> must be acknowledged very plausible and ingenious, if it be built upon a solid Foundation, and if such <HI>Vermiculi</HI> as these have a real Existence <HI>in Rerum Naturâ,</HI> and be not the Creatures of astrong Imagination only. That there are <HI>Worms</HI> very often found in Humane Bodies is indeed sufficient∣ly evident, and what none are ignorant of; and that <HI>Worms</HI> have been sometimes vomited up by Persons sick of the <HI>Plague</HI> is attested by Authors of good Credit: <HI>Diemerbroeck</HI> mentions one Instance of this Kind, <HI>Hist.</HI> 52. Page 306. where he relates
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>this Particular concerning a <HI>Patient</HI> of his, that he cast up by Vomit above 60 small <HI>Worms</HI> as red as Blood, soon after which he died; but he adds that he never saw the like in any other Person. We are also told that Multitudes of such <HI>Worms</HI> were found in some dead Bodies that were opened at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> which lived and moved very briskly when put into <HI>Wine</HI> or <HI>Brandy,</HI> but were soon killed with <HI>Oyl</HI> and Juice of <HI>Lemons;</HI> yet after all, <HI>Kircher's Vermiculi</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ball's</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bradley's Insects</HI> do not seem to be of the same Species with these <HI>Worms,</HI> for the former are represented as so many animated <HI>Atoms,</HI> scarcely discoverable by the Help of the best Glasses, whereas the latter were sufficiently obvi∣ous both to the Sight and Touch. For my part I shall not go about to determine any Thing in this Matter, but shall leave it to the nicer Examination of the most Learned <HI>Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Physicians,</HI> who are capable of penetrating much farther into the Mysteries of <HI>Nature</HI> than I can pretend to be. Only I cannot forbear adding that I do very much doubt while these <HI>Insects</HI> (which by the way can∣not be the same with Mr. <HI>Bradley's Blighting In∣sects,</HI> for then we should have a <HI>Plague</HI> every Time we have a <HI>Blight,</HI> which in and about this Place is almost as oft as we have a Spring, as the <HI>Gardeners</HI> know to their Sorrow, by the so frequent Destruc∣tion of their Fruit: I say I do much doubt, while these <HI>Insects</HI>) remain in such an invisible State, the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> that is founded upon them will also re∣main precarious, and as little demonstrable as others that have been formerly proposed. To which I shall subjoin this one Remark more; That the Generation of <HI>Worms</HI> or any other <HI>Animals, ex putredine,</HI> which <HI>Kircher</HI> seems to take for granted, is now almost
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>universally exploded, and no such Thing as <HI>Spon∣taneous</HI> or <HI>aequivocal</HI> Generation allowed to the meanest <HI>Insect:</HI> but 'tis agreed among the Learned, that the smallest Creatures do (as well as the great∣est) proceed <HI>ex Semine,</HI> and have <HI>Parents</HI> of their own Kind by whom they are propagated; and this indeed is what Mr. <HI>Bradley</HI> no where denies, and I do not say but that his <HI>Hypothesis</HI> may be consistent with the <HI>univocal</HI> as well as <HI>aequivocal</HI> Generation of such <HI>Animalcula.</HI> Yet give me Leave to observe once more, that the gradual Progress which the <HI>Pestilence</HI> usually makes, does not seem very well to agree with the exceeding Lightness of these volatile <HI>In∣sects,</HI> and upon considering this Circumstance one would be enclined to imagine, that whatever is the <HI>Fomes</HI> of the <HI>Contagion,</HI> it must be something more <HI>ponderous,</HI> tho' no less <HI>poisonous</HI> than these <HI>vene∣mous Insects</HI> are supposed to be; and I cannot well conceive how it would be possible by all the Care or Precaution in the World, to prevent the spread∣ing of the Distemper from one End of a Countrey to the other, in a very short Space of Time, if it be car∣ried about by these <HI>Nimble, Light-heel'd, Living A∣toms,</HI> who would make nothing of flying over <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> or fastning upon the Men themselves that stand to guard the <HI>Passes,</HI> and in short, must go which Way soever they are carried by every <HI>Puff</HI> of Wind or <HI>Stream</HI> of Air. But I shall not in∣sist further at present upon this or any other Diffi∣culties that occur to my Thoughts with Reference to this <HI>Hypothesis.</HI> I shall leave these little <HI>Crea∣tures</HI> to shift for themselves as well as they can, but if they be such <HI>Plaguy</HI> ones as they are represented, I desire to have no experimental Acquaintance with them, tho' I own that the Notion and Speculation
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>of them may be agreeable enough to an inquisitive <HI>Genius;</HI> and the Objections which lye cross in my Mind against this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of <HI>Plague-producing Insects,</HI> may possibly be answered to Satisfaction by the Patrons of it, how insoluble soever they may at present appear to me.</P>
<P>What the Learned <HI>Doctor</HI> suggests in Page 22, 23, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> against the old but unhappy Custom of <HI>shut∣ting</HI> up Infected <HI>Houses,</HI> is so <HI>Humane</HI> and <HI>Charita∣ble,</HI> and supported with such <HI>Solid Reasons,</HI> that I cannot but hope it will be so far attended to by our wise <HI>Legislators</HI> in all future <HI>Regulations</HI> they shall see fit to make, that such a cruel and hurtful Method may be effectually prevented, and that if at any time it should please <HI>God</HI> to visit us with that sore <HI>Distemper,</HI> the <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> of it shall not be augmented by Treating the mise∣rable <HI>Sufferers</HI> with such <HI>unreasonable</HI> rigour as manifestly tends to sink and overwhelm their Spi∣rits (which ought to be kept up as much as possible, as in other <HI>Diseases,</HI> so more <HI>Especially</HI> in this) and to dispose them for nothing (humanely Speak∣ing) but to <HI>Despair</HI> and <HI>Die.</HI> And I cannot doubt but that such timely Provision will be made by the <HI>Publick,</HI> of convenient <HI>Lazarettoes</HI> for the Reception of the <HI>Sick</HI> upon the first breaking sorth of the <HI>Dire Disease</HI> in any large <HI>City</HI> or <HI>Town,</HI> as may (through the Blessing of <HI>Heaven</HI>) prove an happy Means of stopping the <HI>Progress</HI> thereof in its beginning.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Alternative</HI> which the <HI>Doctor</HI> proposes in the close of his <HI>excellent Performance</HI> concern∣ing <HI>infected Goods,</HI> that if they be not <HI>burned</HI> they may be <HI>buried</HI> deep in the <HI>Ground;</HI> I cannot but think the <HI>Latter</HI> of these Methods, (or the sink∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>them in the Sea or in some deep Water, where it can be conveniently done, to prevent digging up) to be much the more <HI>eligible,</HI> and the safest as well as least offensive manner of destroying them; for I have a vehement sus∣picion that by the <HI>burning</HI> of Infected <HI>Cloaths</HI> and the like, the <HI>Venomous Effluvia</HI> or <HI>poiso∣nous particles</HI> adhering to them may be car∣ried along with the <HI>Smoak,</HI> and the fatal <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Fomes</HI> being <HI>Volatilized</HI> by the <HI>Fire</HI> may fill all the Circumambient <HI>Air,</HI> and instead of restraining may greatly propagate the <HI>Contagion.</HI> This I very well remember, that in some parts of <HI>England</HI> it is a ge∣nerally received <HI>Opinion</HI> that the <HI>burning</HI> of <HI>Cloaths</HI> taken from a Person that dies of a very <HI>Malignant Small Pox,</HI> greatly tends to spread the <HI>Distemper;</HI> and wicked <HI>Nurses,</HI> who desire to make work for themselves, are said to practise this very Method to ac∣complish their <HI>barbarous</HI> Designs; and when I lived in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> I was informed that when that <HI>Disease</HI> was in the Town of <HI>Ipswich</HI> (about 25 or 30 Years ago) a certain barbarous <HI>Nurse</HI> did early in a Morning, (that she might not be known) at the head of one of the principal Streets, put fire to an heap of <HI>Old Rags</HI> and <HI>Bed Cloaths</HI> that had belonged to some poor People who Died of that <HI>Distemper,</HI> and the <HI>Smoak</HI> driving along the Street, several that passed by betimes com∣plained of a very offensive smell, and the next News was that almost all that had not formerly gone thro' that <HI>Disease</HI> in that whole <HI>Street,</HI> were seized with it in a very few days. And if this Method of <HI>Burn∣ing</HI> be so pernicious in the Case of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> I doubt there is too much Ground of fear (accor∣ding to the common way of arguing <HI>à Minori ad Majus</HI>) that it may prove still more fatal in the
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>Case of the <HI>Plague;</HI> But this I humbly submit to the Con∣sideration of the Learned in Philosophy and Physick.</P>
<P>As for proper <HI>Prophylacticks</HI> or <HI>Preservatives</HI> from the <HI>Plague,</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI> has not offered much upon this Head, and seems to despair of the disco∣very of any Specifick of vertue sufficient to fortifie nature against the assaults of such a <HI>Malignant Di∣sease.</HI> After the mention of some general and very useful rules to be observed by way of prevention, and just hinting at a few particulars, especially the use of <HI>Wine Vinegar</HI> in small quantities, [which, with his <HI>Conserva me Domine,</HI> is said to have been the <HI>Antidote</HI> of the famous <HI>Sylvius</HI>] <HI>He</HI> does in the 35. Page, recommend leaving the infected place as the <HI>Surest Preservative,</HI> which is the same with the Counsel that <HI>Ramazzini</HI> gives in his late Dissertation concerning the <HI>Plague</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> about seven Years ago; Page 469. of his Works; where he thus expresses himself. <HI>Ʋt quod sentio proferam, illud unicum perplacet, quod vulgò de tribus com∣positum appellatur,</HI> i. e, <HI>de celeri fugâ à loco in∣fecto, de profectione ad longinquas regiones, ac tardâ reversione; quo remedii genere sapientiores quoque Medici uti consuevere.</HI> The Sum of which is, That, to speak his <HI>Mind</HI> freely, he thinks the Method of prevention prescribed by the old <HI>Adage, Mox, longè, tardè, cede, recede, redi,</HI> to be the <HI>Best,</HI> i. e. to get away soon, to go away far, and to return back slowly; which he says is a remedy that the wisest <HI>Physicians</HI> themselves are wont to make use of upon this Occasion: But how proper advice soever this may be to those who are in such Circumstances as render them capable of following it, yet there are, alas, great numbers to whom this will seem an <HI>hard saying,</HI> as being by them im∣practicable. The lower sort of People, poor <HI>Me∣chanicks</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>and <HI>Tradesmen</HI> that have nothing to live upon, but the Profit of their Mean Employments, must be forced to <HI>Stick</HI> by the <HI>Stuff;</HI> they have no <HI>Country Seats</HI> to repair to, and few of them have any such Friend as will be free to receive them into their houses in the adjacent Villages. If there∣fore any thing could be found out that would, if not always, (which indeed is not to be expected) yet pretty often prove a <HI>Defensative</HI> against this dread∣ful <HI>Enemy,</HI> it would certainly be a great and most acceptable Service to Mankind to acquaint the world therewith. But as to this, I (being no <HI>Physician</HI> my self) have little to offer but what has occasionally occurred to me in perusing some of the best <HI>Medi∣cal</HI> Books, written by <HI>Authors</HI> of the greatest Name and Note, who have themselves been emi∣nent <HI>Practitioners,</HI> and particularly have had cou∣rage enough to Visit the Sick in places where the <HI>Plague</HI> has raged with the greatest Violence. A∣mong these, <HI>Diemerbroeck</HI> and <HI>Hodges</HI> are the Chief in the Class of Modern Writers; the <HI>Former</HI> being <HI>Physician</HI> at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> during the severe <HI>Pestilence</HI> that made such fearful havock there in the Year 1636; and the <HI>Latter</HI> at <HI>London</HI> in 1665, when near an hundred thousand Persons were cut off by this <HI>Flagellum Dei.</HI> As to <HI>Diemerbroeck,</HI> that great Judge Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> says, that he prefers his Book of the <HI>Plague</HI> to any that he had ever read of that <HI>Disease,</HI> Page 81. of his Treatise of the Air, alrea∣dy mentioned; and indeed <HI>He</HI> seems to have commu∣nicated his Observations to the World with a great deal of ingenuous plainness and fidelity. It would take up too much room to transcribe the half of those Receits, which he proposes from himself and others by way of prevention, in his Treatise of this Distem∣per;
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>I shall therefore only give my Reader the Sub∣stance of what he sets down in the 12 Ch. of his 2d. Book, the Title of which is <HI>De meo ipsius Vivendi modo,</HI> where he faithfully relates what Course he himself took for his own Preservation, while he at∣tended the Sick during that sad time in which the <HI>Plague</HI> raged at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> The Sum of what he says I have endeavoured to contract as follows: He tells us, that he avoided as much as he could all ve∣hement Perturbations of Mind: That he lived intre∣pidly, or without Fear: That it was the same Thing to him whether he visited the Sick of the <HI>Plague</HI> or of any other Distemper, and that he as readily served the Poor <HI>gratis,</HI> as the Rich for a <HI>Reward;</HI> He adds, that if at any time he found himself some∣what shocked, (which in that doleful Season, where∣in there was scarce an House in the whole City that escaped the <HI>Contagion,</HI> must needs happen now and then) in such a Case he refreshed his Spirits with three or four Draughts of <HI>Wine;</HI> That being fre∣quently disturbed in the <HI>Night,</HI> and much tired in the <HI>Day</HI> with walking up and down from <HI>Patient</HI> to <HI>Patient,</HI> he was forced to Sleep an Hour after Dinner, when he could best spare the time, though he disswaded others, who were under no such ne∣cessity, from sleeping in the Day: That as to Diet, he used <HI>Meats</HI> of the most easy Digestion, avoiding <HI>Swine's Flesh, Herrings,</HI> and the like, which he had found hurtful to him: That his <HI>Drink</HI> was ordina∣ry <HI>Ale</HI> and Small <HI>White Wine,</HI> of which he some∣times drank to Chearfulness, but never to Excess; That he kept his Body open, but not too loose, only so as to have <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two</HI> Stools in a Day: That <HI>Once</HI> or <HI>Twice</HI> in a week at Bed-time he swallowed <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two</HI> of his Anti-pestilential Pills described in
<PB N="18" REF="21" MS="y"/><HI>Chap.</HI> 9. [the Composition of which shall be subjoin∣ed to this Account] That beginning to visit the Sick between <HI>Four</HI> and <HI>Five</HI> in the Morning, he could then take Nothing, his Stomach perfectly loathing both Meat, Drink, and Medicine, so that he was con∣strained (though against his own Judgment) to go forth fasting, and could do no more than (after committing himself to <HI>God</HI> by pious Prayers) to chew some Grains of the lesser <HI>Cardamom;</HI> That a∣bout <HI>Six</HI> a Clock in the Morning he took a little <HI>Treacle,</HI> or <HI>Diascordium,</HI> or eat a little <HI>Candied Orange Pill,</HI> and very frequently three or four Bits of <HI>Candied Elecampane:</HI> About <HI>Eight</HI> he break∣fasted upon a Peice of <HI>Bread</HI> with <HI>Butter</HI> and <HI>Green∣cheese</HI> made of Sheeps Milk, drinking a Glass of Ale, and now and then (but not daily) he took a Draught of <HI>Wormwood Wine</HI> about <HI>Nine:</HI> At <HI>Ten</HI> he smoaked a Pipe of <HI>Tabacco,</HI> and after Dinner <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three,</HI> and the like after Supper, and sometimes <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> more between Meals, and if at any Time he found himself affected with the <HI>Ill Smell</HI> of the Sick, he presently had Recourse to the same <HI>Remedy,</HI> which he says (he found by his own Ex∣perience) as well as always thought to be the most effectual <HI>Preservative,</HI> so that the <HI>Tobacco be of the best Sort.</HI> He adds, that upon the ceasing of the <HI>Plague</HI> he left off <HI>Smoaking,</HI> not willing to ac∣custom himself to it, lest he should turn its laudable Use into a detestable Abuse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Composition</HI> of the <HI>Anti-pestilential</HI> Pills is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Take the Roots of Butter-bur, Carline Thistle, Dittany, Angelica, Elecampane, of each an½Ounce; and Half; of Gentian one Dram and Half; of the best Rhubarb, one Ounce and Half; of Zedoary one
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>Dram: Of the whitest Agarick, Half an Ounce; Take also the Herbs Scordium, the lesser Centory, Rue, of each Half an Ounce; Carduus Benedict∣us, six Drams; and of the Flowers of Staechas one Dram and an half; as also the Seeds of Citron and Oranges, of each one Dram; of all these make a gross Powder, which steep for two or three Days in two Pounds and an half or three Pounds of White Wine, then boil it for about a Quarter of an Hour, and strain it very strongly in a Press, and afterwards strain itagain through thin Paper: In the strained Liquor dissolve three Ounces and an half of the best A∣loes, and three Drams and an half of clear Myrrh in Drops: Let the Moisture evaporate in a China Dish 'till a Mass of Pills can be made of the Re∣mainder.</HI> These Pills (says the Author) we have found to be of great Use in Time of the <HI>Plague.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far from the accurate <HI>Diemerbroeck;</HI> who has also given us no less than 120 <HI>Histories</HI> of so many particular Persons afflicted with the <HI>Plague,</HI> in whose Cases may be seen all the various <HI>Symp∣toms</HI> of that sore Distemper, with the Remedies pro∣per to each of them, which are well worth the Per∣usal of such as understand the Language wherein they are writ.</P>
<P>Proceed we now to the Learned Dr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> who by the Appointment of the <HI>Government</HI> continued in <HI>London</HI> during that most dreadful <HI>Pestilence,</HI> which raged there in the Year 1665, of which he afterwards published an <HI>Historical Narration</HI> with the <HI>Title</HI> of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or an <HI>Account of the Plague:</HI> in which he treats concerning the <HI>Rise</HI> and <HI>Progress,</HI> the <HI>Cau∣ses, Signs,</HI> and <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Contagion,</HI> and also re∣lates his own Manner of living in that Time of Dan∣ger. What I shall observe from him shall be only
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>the few particular Directions which he gives con∣cerning such Things as he judges proper to be done by Way of <HI>Precaution;</HI> omitting the general Ones relating to the timely providing <HI>Lazaretto's,</HI> keep∣ing <HI>Houses</HI> and <HI>Streets clean,</HI> and the like, which Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> has perfectly well recommended. As to particular <HI>Preservatives</HI> from the <HI>Plague,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hodges</HI> gives us several <HI>Receits,</HI> of which I shall on∣ly set down <HI>Two</HI> that are of easy Preparation, and perhaps of equal Virtue with the more pompous Forms. The first is what he calls an <HI>Electuary for the Ʋse of the Poor,</HI> the Composition of which is in <HI>Page</HI> 229, of his Book, <HI>viz. Take Conserve of Wood-sorrel and Goats Rue, of each half a Pound; of Marigolds, one Pound; London-treacle, three Ounces; Bole Armoniack vitriolated, four Ounces; with Syrup of Lemons as much as is sufficient; make an Electuary; two or three Drams of which may be taken Morning and Evening.</HI> The other is an <HI>Haustus</HI> said to be of great Virtue. <HI>Viz. Take Wa∣ter of red Roses camphorated two Ounces, the best Vinegar one Ounce, in which dissolve two Scruples of the best Bole Armoniack; add three Drams of simple Syrup of Scabious, mix them for a Draught.</HI></P>
<P>I do the rather mention this because the Use of <HI>Vinegar</HI> seems to be much approved by the Lear∣ned Dr. <HI>Mead. Diemerbroeck</HI> also highly com∣mends <HI>Vinegar,</HI> and says that he had seen many poor People better preserved by taking a <HI>Spoonful</HI> thereof every Morning, than some Others were by the most costly <HI>Remedies.</HI> Page 170.</P>
<P>Among other <HI>Antidotes</HI> against the <HI>Pestilential Contagion,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hodges</HI> does particularly commend <HI>Canary</HI> of the best Sort, of which he frequently drank while he attended the Sick, and found it of sin∣gular
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>Use to himself and others. His Time of drink∣ing it was at <HI>Dinner,</HI> and a little before <HI>Bed-time;</HI> but as to the <HI>Smoaking</HI> of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which <HI>Diemer∣broeck</HI> so much extols, <HI>He</HI> speaks very doubtfully of it, and seems to have had an Aversion to it, and to suspect that the <HI>Pestiferous Vapours</HI> may be suck∣ed in with the <HI>Smoak;</HI> and in fine he prefers his good <HI>Spanish Wine</HI> very much before it, and this so far as appears was the <HI>Antidote</HI> he chiefly trusted to among the <HI>Internal</HI> Ones. But then as to <HI>Ex∣ternal</HI> Defensatives against this deadly Enemy (re∣jecting the many <HI>Amulets</HI> vulgarly prescribed, the most of which he thinks to be useless, and some noxious,) there is one which he greatly commends as the most powerful and effectual of all others in this Case, and that is the having of large <HI>Issues;</HI> for Instance, one in the <HI>Left Arm,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Right Leg,</HI> capacious enough to contain five or six Pease. The more to enforce this Advice, he does solemnly affirm, <HI>Page</HI> 240. that as oft as he went in∣to Places that were more than ordinarily <HI>Infected,</HI> he found that Part of his <HI>Arm</HI> in which the <HI>Issue</HI> was, exceedingly pained, and that <HI>thin, undigested, Bloody Matter</HI> would flow from it, with a very smart Pungency, and that upon this Warning given him, he presently had Recourse to proper <HI>Alexiphar∣micks.</HI> It seems plain from hence even to Sense and ocular Demonstration, that the <HI>Virus,</HI> the <HI>Venom,</HI> and <HI>Poison</HI> of the <HI>Contagion</HI> did work off in a great Measure by Means of this Sort of <HI>Evacuation.</HI> I shall only add under this <HI>Head,</HI> that <HI>Diemerbroeck</HI> does also much commend this Remedy, and observes that many who had <HI>Issues</HI> escaped the <HI>Plague at Ni∣meguen,</HI> and of those that had it, a considerable Num∣ber recovered speedily upon taking a <HI>Sweating
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>Medicine,</HI> and he mentions several other eminent <HI>Physicians</HI> that had found the happy Effect of such <HI>Issues</HI> in the Course of their <HI>Practice.</HI> Page 150. <HI>&amp;c. He</HI> observes also that many of those that had <HI>Sores</HI> about them escaped the <HI>Plague,</HI> and he tells us that <HI>Galen</HI> of old made the Same <HI>Observati∣on.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now in the Close of this <HI>Collection</HI> just mention <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two Preservatives</HI> recorded by the Excellent <HI>Mr. Boyle,</HI> towards the latter end of his discourse of the <HI>Air</HI> beforementioned. The former of these is in Page 86. which was communi∣cated to him by one whom he calls an ancient and very experienced <HI>Physician,</HI> to whose care a great <HI>Pest-house</HI> was committed. This <HI>Person</HI> own'd to Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> that besides ardent <HI>Prayers</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and a very regular diet, his constant <HI>Antidote</HI> was on∣ly to take every Morning fasting a little <HI>Sea-Salt</HI> dissolved in a few Spoonfuls of <HI>Fair Water:</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> adds that he thinks it desirable that Notice be taken of all Remedies that have been found by good <HI>Trials</HI> available against the <HI>Plague;</HI> for since <HI>Pesti∣lences</HI> are various in their Kinds, 'tis very possible that their appropriated Remedies may be so too; and that Medicine may prove successful in one, which has proved ineffectual in another. The <HI>Noble Au∣thor</HI> adds to this, That the said Consideration for∣bad him to pass by the following Particular, <HI>Viz.</HI> That a very Learned <HI>Physician</HI> having recommen∣ded to him the Herb called <HI>Galega,</HI> or <HI>Goats-rue,</HI> at that time little noted in <HI>England,</HI> as a most effectu∣al <HI>Antidote</HI> against the <HI>Plague,</HI> he caused it to be cultivated in a Garden, and when the <HI>Pestilence</HI> raged most, having some of it by him made up with a little <HI>Sugar</HI> in the form of a <HI>fine green Conserve,</HI> he
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>sent it to <HI>Two</HI> infected Persons, who, by the divine blessing on it, both of them recovered. He also takes notice of the great vertue of this <HI>Herb</HI> against the <HI>Bitings</HI> of <HI>Venomous Creatures:</HI> It may be eaten in its entire Substance as a Salad, or the <HI>Conserve</HI> or <HI>Syrup</HI> may be taken, or the <HI>Juice</HI> newly express'd, which he thinks better than the <HI>Syrup</HI> or <HI>Conserve.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have finished what I had to offer to the <HI>Publick</HI> concerning the <HI>Plague,</HI> and the most proper <HI>Antidotes</HI> against it which I have met with in my lit∣tle reading. I shall only add, That after all, our prin∣cipal-Trust and Confidence must be in the <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> through the Merits of our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour Jesus Christ;</HI> and it great∣ly concerns all <HI>Persons</HI> to search and try their ways, and turn unto the <HI>Lord</HI> with their whole hearts. Let the <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Instruments</HI> or <HI>Second Causes</HI> of this terrible Calamity be what they will; whether it owes its <HI>Origin</HI> to <HI>Subterraneal Steams</HI> and the <HI>Expirations</HI> of Noxious <HI>Minerals,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> conjectures) or, to a pestiferous <HI>Aura,</HI> proceed∣ing from a peculiar, and (in a Sort) corruptive al∣teration of the <HI>Nitro-aereal</HI> Spirit, (as Dr. <HI>Hodges</HI> thinks) or, to prodigious <HI>Swarms</HI> of invisible <HI>Ve∣nomous Insects,</HI> (as <HI>Kircher</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bradley</HI> ima∣gine) Or <HI>Lastly,</HI> to an unhealthy Constitution of the Season, and Disorder in the <HI>Air</HI> Occasioned by ex∣cessive <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Moisture,</HI> (as <HI>Galen</HI> taught of old) which evil Constitution is heightned and ren∣dred more Malignant by the Stinks of <HI>Stagnating Waters,</HI> by <HI>Putrid Exhalations</HI> from the <HI>Earth</HI> and from dead <HI>Carcases</HI> lying unburied, which fill the <HI>Air</HI> with <HI>Contagious Particles,</HI> and so being <HI>Suck'd</HI> in with the <HI>Breath</HI> taint in their passage the <HI>Salival</HI> Juices, which being Swallowed down into
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>the <HI>Stomach</HI> fix the <HI>Malignity</HI> there, as the Learned Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> observes, Pag 7. and 11. of his Discourse: I say whether this <HI>Dreadful Disease</HI> owes its <HI>Origine</HI> to any one, or (which is more probable) to a <HI>Concurrence,</HI> and <HI>Complication</HI> of <HI>Secondary Causes,</HI> Yet still it becomes us to look higher, and to reverence <HI>Divine Providence</HI> as the first and principal <HI>Cause.</HI> The great <HI>God</HI> has said, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>[Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?] Sword</HI> and <HI>Famine</HI> and <HI>Pestilence</HI> are what <HI>He</HI> expresly calls, <HI>His sore Judgments.</HI> (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.21.) The <HI>Earth,</HI> the <HI>Water,</HI> the <HI>Fire,</HI> the <HI>Air,</HI> all the <HI>Elements,</HI> and all their <HI>Actions</HI> are at his <HI>Beck,</HI> and under his steady <HI>Government,</HI> and 'tis not improbable that he does employ <HI>Angels,</HI> as the <HI>Ministers</HI> of his <HI>Justice,</HI> to inslict deserved <HI>Punishments,</HI> and particularly this of <HI>Pestilence</HI> up∣on a guilty People: Possibly he may by their <HI>invi∣sible</HI> Hands scatter through the <HI>Air</HI> those fatal <HI>Mi∣asmata,</HI> those Malignant <HI>Venomous Atoms,</HI> and <HI>Poisonous Effluvia,</HI> the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Contagious</HI> Dis∣tempers, that carry <HI>Death and Destruction</HI> all a∣round; to which Thought some <HI>Divines</HI> have been led by some passages in <HI>Holy Writ</HI> that seem in their opinion to look this way. Be this as it will, 'tis certain that the <HI>Almighty</HI> is the principal <HI>Agent,</HI> who orders and over-rules all <HI>Inferiour ones,</HI> and therefore whatever or whoever be the <HI>Instruments,</HI> 'tis with him that we have chiefly to do, 'tis from him that we have more to <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Hope</HI> than from all the <HI>World</HI> besides, and therefore it must needs be both our Duty and our Interest to fly to his <HI>Mer∣cy-Seat,</HI> to <HI>Humble</HI> our selves before him, and to make our earnest <HI>Supplication</HI> to him, either to <HI>Pre∣serve</HI> us from such <HI>Publick</HI> desolating Calamities,

And a general <HI>Humili∣ation, Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Reformation</HI> is one of the most hopeful Means of <HI>Preservation</HI> from this ter∣rible <HI>Distemper,</HI> whereby the <HI>Wrath</HI> of an <HI>offen∣ded God</HI> is revealed from <HI>Heaven</HI> against the <HI>Ʋn∣righteousness</HI> and <HI>Ʋngodliness</HI> of a guilty World. Yea, if <HI>God</HI> should see fit to send it among us, such <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Amendment,</HI> joined with a true <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Mediator,</HI> would best prepare us for it, give us the greatest Courage and Comfort under it, and the most happy Issue out of it, and even <HI>Death</HI> it self would be to us no other than a Passage to a bet∣ter <HI>Life.</HI></P>

<P>Such as desire to see more of the Nature and Cure of the <HI>Plague</HI> may consult <HI>Burnet's Thesaurus Me∣dicinae Practicae à Daniele Puerario Auctus in duo∣bus Tomis. Genevae.</HI> 1678. <HI>Octavo.</HI> In which he has collected the principal Remedies made Use of against this Distemper by the most eminent Physici∣ans of the two last Ages, such as <HI>Forestus, Fabri∣tius Hildanus, Rodericus à Fonseca, Felix Plate∣rus, Joannes Crato, Gregorius Horstius, Ray∣mundus Mindererus, Helmontius, Mercurialis, Kircher, Diemerbroeck, Hodges,</HI> and others. Or they may have Recourse to <HI>Etmullerus,</HI> and the Col∣lections of the Voluminous <HI>Manget,</HI> in his <HI>Bibli∣otheca Medico-Practica</HI> in four large <HI>Folio's.</HI> His Collections relating to the <HI>Plague</HI> may be found in the <HI>Fourth</HI> Volume, printed at Geneva, 1698. who to the Authors already mentioned has added some later ones, as <HI>Barbette, Sylvius, Willis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Add to the Preservatives, that <HI>Garden Rue</HI> eaten with Bread and Butter, or made up into a <HI>Conserve</HI> is much commended against the <HI>Plague,</HI> and if this were added to the <HI>Conserve</HI> prescribed in <HI>Page</HI> 23. I should think it would be to the Advantage there∣of. The very Smell of this <HI>Herb,</HI> tho' ungrateful, is said to be an <HI>Antidote.</HI></P>
<P>Candied <HI>Elecampane Roots</HI> are also much praised by <HI>Diemerbroeck.</HI></P>
<P>To what is observed in the <HI>Fourth</HI> Page from Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> and <HI>Sydenham</HI> concerning the <HI>Plague's</HI> not
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>springing up of its self in this Part of the World, I shall beg Leave to add as a Close to this <HI>Paper;</HI> That altho' it may be true that this <HI>Distemper</HI> ne∣ver breaks out in these <HI>Countries</HI> unless the <HI>Semina∣ry</HI> of it be brought to them from some infected Place, yet the Disposition of the <HI>Air</HI> may some∣times be such as to render it more apt than ordinary to receive into it the <HI>Poisonous Fomes,</HI> and to pro∣pagate the same, which is what these Learned <HI>Gen∣tlemen</HI> do expresly acknowledge. The Use which I would make of this <HI>Reflection</HI> is, that the <HI>warm Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> which has prevailed for the greatest Part of the present <HI>Winter,</HI> and is general∣ly thought to be too favourable to the <HI>Seeds</HI> of this <HI>Disease</HI> (whatever they are) should put us upon <HI>Doubling our Diligence,</HI> in the Use of all proper Means to guard against the Admission of any Thing from Abroad, that may give the least Suspicion of its harbouring such a <HI>Fatal Mischief:</HI> for should any Thing of this Kind be conveyed to us, it may have the like unhappy Effects with a <HI>Little Spark,</HI> falling into a great Deal of <HI>Dry Tinder,</HI> that may quickly diffuse it self, and break forth into a <HI>Flame</HI> not easy to be extinguished.</P>
