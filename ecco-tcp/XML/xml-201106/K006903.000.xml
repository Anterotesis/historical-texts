<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author of this Work, be∣sides the Emolument that every Practitioner has a Right to expect from his Profession, had another Motive to encou∣rage him to the completion thereof; to wit, a humane and Christian Concern with which he had been long actuated for the Welfare of the Fair, whose delicate Frames are too often a Prey to Diseases, which, through the Decrees of Providence, peculiar
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>to their Sex, yet, through a mistaken Mo∣desty, they are loth to declare, and apply for Succour, from those duly qualified, to relieve them.</P>
<P>They are here provided with the most ra∣tional, yet easy Instructions, as well as with the most select and approved of Re∣cipes, either to prevent in Time, or cure themselves of, when, through carelessness, or any other cause they are surprised with, any of those Distempers particular to their own Sex, but unknown to the other.</P>
<P>Most Males, young or old, make little, or rather, no scruple, of unfolding any complaint they may labour under, to a Physician, Surgeon, or Apothecary; while young Females, except abandoned Prosti∣tutes, and many even of those more ad∣vanced in Years, through innate Modesty, an almost invincible Bashfulness; and a be∣ing reserved in the Extreme to the great Detriment of their health, by the ridicu∣lous concealment of a beginning Distem∣per, suffer a kind of petty Martyrdom to misunderstood Notions of Virtue, which are consequently the cause of their health and constitution being ruined, and of their manifestly pining away, though all around them can assign no Reason; and no
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>Disorder of the Fair Sex is made such a destructive Mystery of, as that which shall take the lead here; to wit,</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Menstrual Flux.</HEAD>
<P>UNTIL the Age of Puberty, (that is, of being capable to propagate the Species) which varies in different Nations, being earlier in the Southern Climes, and later in the Northern, young Males and Females are indiscriminately liable to the same Distempers; nor before that critical Period of Life, is there any sexual Differ∣ence; the Cause of this Difference, the first of that Class, which, on Account of its be∣ing the Fore-runner and fruitful Source, whence all others are derived, that in an es∣pecial Manner, afflict the more amiable Part of Society, must afford us ample Matter of Admiration, as will obviously appear to all who, in a philosophical or Christian Light, shall consider this essential Evacuation.</P>
<P>The Womb of a Female being designed by Nature for the first Receptacle and Nur∣sery of the yet unborn Being, is, after a certain revolutionary Period of Life, irri∣gated with an extraordinary Quantity of Blood, at stated Times; by which means the Vessels are used to open and distend themselves for the more easy Admission of the
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>Monthly Tide, which when, by a kindly Discharge is decreased of its super-abounding Quantity, the stretched Vessels recover their due Spring, and return the rest to the ge∣neral Course of Circulation.</P>
<P>Nature's Intent, by this Process, is, that after Impregnation, such encreasing Quan∣tities of the Blood, derived to the Womb, are to supply Nutriment to the Foetus; who, when brought forth, is supported by Milk from the Breasts, of which the redun∣dant Blood, then diverted from the Womb to those Parts, becomes the nourishing Fountain.—While Things are thus carried on in their due Course, all goes right; but as from every Deviation some new Malady arises, and indeed directly or indirectly all those with which the Sex is peculiarly af∣fected: and that we may progressively fol∣low them, we have fixed our Choice to be∣gin with the menstrual Discharge, that is perverted either by its Obstruction, or an extraordinary Efflux, in a more or less vio∣lent Degree.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> An Obstruction, Suppression, or Stoppage, of the Menstrual Discharge,</HEAD>
<P>IS caused in young Females either by too great a Consistence, Viscidity, or Sizi∣ness of the Blood, which cannot force its
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>Way into the smaller Vessels, to be thro' them emptied to a certain Degree; or else is owing to too great a Compactness in the Fibres of the Womb, whose secretory Ori∣fices, or little Mouths are too closely com∣pressed to yield Admission to any Ingress of the Blood, and consequently preventative of salutary Evacuations. In either Case, the Blood's Escape being debarred, its return into the general Circulation, on account of its augmented Quantity, makes offensive Lodgments on many Parts, through their Weakness rendered more liable to yield; and prove dangerous in Proportion to the Parts affected being more or less essential to Life.</P>
<P>This Distemper is ever attended with an Unwillingness to Action, an Heaviness of Mind, a Paleness of Complexion. Pains are felt both in the Groin and Loins, with a Difficulty of breathing; cold Sweats, hysteric and fainting Fits, &amp;c. There en∣sues a total Depravation of all the Functi∣ons of the Body. Nay, such hath often been the dreadful Effect of the Discharge not being able to make its Way through the proper Outlets, as to force for itself an unnatural, violent, and perilous Egress, through the <HI>Anus,</HI> or Fundament, the Blad∣der, Breasts, Eyes, Ears, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Bowels are wont to suffer prodigi∣ously in such Patients, and in general, more
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>outrageously, as their Constitution is more delicate.—Hence what a Train of Maladies arise, particularly every Species of a de∣praved Appetite, as is made manifest by unnatural, and often offensive Longings, too well known to need being mentioned here.</P>
<P>Besides the above assigned inherent Causes of this Disease, whether in the too compact Structure of the Womb, or the too great Siziness obstructive to its escaping by the emissary pores; the following, which we may call external or adventitious ones, are not to be neglected, but rather seriously at∣tended to; such are the improper Use of astringent Remedies; of acids; and whatever may cause a Spissitude in the Humours; too incrassating a Diet; that is, Nourishment which thickens the Blood too much. A Suppression of the menstrual Discharge is sometimes caused by too great an Evacua∣tion of the Blood from a Wound, or other∣wise; it being thence rendered too weak to force its Way by the Womb. It is also caused by any sudden Terror, obstinate Grieving, a violent Cold, &amp;c.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Cure.</HEAD>
<P>IN general, where too great an Evacua∣tion of Blood, or Weakness of the Pa∣tient's Constitution, is not supposed to be
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>the leading Cause, it is proper the Patient should undergo a gentle Bleeding, in order to make Way for the Remedies operating more effectually; and during the Course of taking them, to receive frequently the Steam of Camomile Flowers that had been boiled in Water, by the Means of a con∣veying Tube, or Funnel, through a certain Part, to play upon the Insertion of the Womb, in order to soften its Texture, in ease the Suppression should be owing to the Toughness of its Structure.</P>
<P>But should there appear to be a stagnat∣ing Vice; that is, an Unwillingness to flow in the Blood, a Spur must be given to its Laziness, by Fomentations, such as the above, accompanied with frequent Exer∣cise, diluting Drinks, such as Tea, Whey, or a pleasant and wholesome Liquor, that may be made by infusing the Rinds of Oranges, Citrons, and Lemons, in Spring Water, till it shall have acquired an agree∣able Taste from them.</P>
<P>Then take the following Pills for some Time; to wit, Venetian Soap—Borax— Aloes—one Drachm each, to be made into Pills; each Pill to confist of three Grains; four Pills to be taken every Day; one a little after the Patient rises in the morning, and some Time before her Breakfast; an∣other about an Hour, or at least Half an Hour before Dinner; a third at about the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>same Distance before Tea-Time in the E∣vening; the fourth is to be taken on going to Bed.</P>
<P>Let the Patient seek all Occasions of Exercise, of Merriment, and whatever may excite a Flow of Spirits. Some Time af∣ter the bleeding in the Arm, if Matters succeed not as may be wished, then let a gentle Bleeding in the Foot take Place; and this Practice carefully followed for some Time, cannot fail of effectuating a Cure, where consummate Weakness, an exhausted Constitution, or other insuperable Difficulties do not intervene.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> The immoderate Flux of the Menstrual Dis∣charge.</HEAD>
<P>AS a due Discharge of Blood by the Uterus every Month is an Insurer of Health, so an extraordinary Efflux is the Harbinger of Sickness, and highly detri∣mental to the Constitution; because it oc∣casions a Loss of Strength, which is at∣tended by other Symptoms; to wit, Cru∣dities from Indigestion, a Loss of Appetite, a Sense of Oppression in the Stomach, a sickly Complexion, oftentimes a small En∣crease of Heat, a feeble Pulse; a Swelling in the Feet, and a Restlessness during the Time of Sleep.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<P>The immoderate Flux of the menstrual Discharge is effectuated in three different Manners: 1. By too plentiful and impe∣tuous an Eruption at the usual Period. 2. Sometimes by happening twice, or oftener, within the Space of a Month. 3. Some∣times by continuing several Days longer than they were wont to flow. The Cure to be obtained, is a restraining of the pre∣sent Flux, and keeping a future one within due Bounds. For this purpose let the Patient rest, as long as convenient to her Situation of Life, in Bed upon her Back, and as much as possible let her avoid speaking. According as she is strong or weak, and concurring Circumstances will allow, let her blood in the Arm. Care should be taken that no strict Ligatures be suffered on any Part of her Body, as by means of Garters, Sleeve-buttons, &amp;c. which are very prejudicial. Let the Patient's Diet be slender, and consist chiefly of Veal, Chicken∣broths, Fish-soups; let her constant Drink be Ptisan of Plantane, Yarrow, and Nettle∣tops, into which, by way of giving it a Zest, put some Orange-peel, or of the greater Comfrey; but put in Linseed, if she be of a hot and bilious Temperament.</P>
<P>In Cases where these Remedies do not succeed, then Recourse must be had to the following prescribed by Dr. Mead, as a more efficacious one: "Take one Ounce
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>of burnt Alum, one quarter of an Ounce of Dragon's Blood, which reduce to a Pow∣der; to those of weakly Constitutions let there be given from fifteen Grains to twen∣ty; to those of middling, from twenty to twenty-five; to those of a strong Habit, thirty Grains in a Glass of red Wine, di∣luted with an equal Quantity of warm Water and to be taken three Times a Day."</P>
<P>In the more alarming Cases of this Ma∣lady, the Womb, on account of its Orifice being in a quite relaxed State, may be sy∣ringed with a Decoction of Yarrow, red Roses, Plantane, or with warm Water im∣pregnated with the Powder of Roch-alum, or with Vinegar made warm.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Of the Whites, or Fluor Albus.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady is the running of a liquid Matter, from the private Parts of the female Sex, but stinks not like Ul∣cers, and is free from any infectious Taint. Its Colour is sometimes white, sometimes green, sometimes yellow, &amp;c. It is some∣times of an acid Nature, and excoriates the Parts, sometimes not. This Species of run∣ning is in general continued, but not co∣pious. It is interrupted in some Patients, and returns either at irregular or stated Pe∣riods.
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>It is in many a constant Forerunner of the menstrual Discharge, and after that is over, re-appears for some Time.</P>
<P>The common Signs to distinguish the Whites from the venereal Flux or Clap, is, that in the latter Case the Discharge is more copious, and continues during the Times of the menstrual Discharge; where∣as the former suffers an Interruption: the Patient's Knowledge of her own Conduct must help to judge in this Case.</P>
<P>The Patients who labour under an un∣interrupted Fluor Albus, or one that fre∣quently returns, have a pale and swollen Countenance, a Distaste for their wonted Aliments, a Loss of Strength, frequent Pain about the Region of the Heart, besides troublesome Twitchings, and a sinking Weakness of the Stomach.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as this remote and fixed Cause of the Fluor Albus is in the Stomach, the setting that to rights is the surest Way of performing a Cure. Let the Patient set off in the Beginning of the Disorder, when not much enfeebled, by letting a little Blood from the Arm; and in a Day or two after, be puked with one Grain of Tartar Emetic; if young, and rather weak, with half an Ounce of Tincture of Hipecacuanha; but if at her full Growth, and of a strong Habit of Body, let two Grains of Tartar Emetic be employed; and when it begins
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>to operate, it is to be encouraged by drink∣ing after each Effort some Camomile-tea. In a few Days after let her be purged with what ever purgative Medicine and Dose she may have been used to; but if not habitu∣ated to any, in case the Patient be young and weakly, let fifteen Grains of Jalap in Powders be taken in a Dish of Tea, or Whey, or any other inoffensive and weak Liquor warmed, to be also drunk from time to time, while the Medicines are operating, in order to encourage it.</P>
<P>After these Preludes to a Cure, the Pa∣tient must betake herself to a proper Regi∣men; that is, she must shun all Ragousts, Fruits, Salads, Confectionary-articles, Roots; and live chiefly on Rice, Beef, Mutton, Fowl, and all Sorts of Food that tend to strengthen the Constitution. If denied ei∣ther by the Place of her Abode, or of her Circumstances, the means of procuring Ferrugineous Waters, she may make an artificial one for herself, by boiling old pieces of rusty Iron in Water, of which she is to drink half a pint each Day, if young, and of a weakly Constitution; but if of a strong Habit, and come to be full grown, then she may drink a Pint, and every eight Days, for the first Month, repeat the above Purgative; in the second, every fifteen Days; in the third Month let the Interval be of three Weeks; and once a Month af∣terwards
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>for the Space of six, if the Malady should persevere.</P>
<P>Immediately subsequent to the first Purge, let her begin to take the following Reme∣dies for a recent or inveterate State: 1. In the Commencement the Fluor Albus, and in as yet a not-emaciated Constitution; an Infusion of Rosemary drunk every Day, in the manner, and in the room of Tea, has been often known to prevent its far∣ther Progress; but when of a long stand∣ing, and that it has resisted the commonly advised Remedies by female Friends, Gos∣sips, and Matron Advisers, &amp;c. Recourse must be had to the following Remedy; "Take Extract of the Peruvian Bark, Nut∣meg, Alum, of each one Scruple, and of Syrup of Clove a sufficient Quantity, to make a Bolus of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Ingredients." Let the Patient begin by taking a very small Quan∣tity from the Tip or Edge of a Tea-spoon, and so continue for one Week, encreasing it the next and following, but there she is to stop where the Quantity may be found dis∣agreeable. In Cases where a Weakness of the Back is perceived, let a strengthening Plaister (to be had at any Apothecary's shop) be thereto applied.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Russel</HI> advises for the Cure of an inveterate Fluor Albus, to bathe in the Sea∣water, and drink it. Those who are situ∣ated near the Sea, may try; but since it
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>has been known to fail in so many Cases, it is not strenuously insisted upon here, and frequent Exercise is preferable to it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> Of the Green-Sickness, or Chlorosis.</HEAD>
<P>TO this Malady are subject Maids and Widows. It is attended with a slow, irregular, and almost imperceptible Fever. The Complexion of the Patient is disco∣loured, being sometimes a ghastly pale, at other times livid, and not rarely greenish, with a Circle of a Violet Colour under the Eyes. They feel a constant Irksomeness, and a Despondency without any apparent Cause: the Pulse is small, unequal, and va∣riable; the Ancles and Eye-lids are apt to swell: the Face is bloated; a benumbing Dulness is diffused through the whole Bo∣dy: in the Legs and Feet are felt a tensive Lassitude; such Patients are also subject to a Palpitation of the Heart, racking Pains in the Head, and an inordinate Desire of things totally unfit for nourishing the Body; to wit, Chalk, Coals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Treatment in order to obtain a Cure, is to be commenced by a Purgative propor∣tioned to the Patient's Strength, as may be gathered from our Directions in the Mala∣dies already treated of. Then get, of Ca∣stile
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>Soap, three Drachms; of Rhubarb in Powder half a Drachm; Filings of Steel, half a Drachm; Species of Hiera Picra, half a Drachm; with a sufficient Quantity of Orange Peels made into an Electuary; of which the Patient, if young and weakly, is to take the Quantity of half a small Tea Spoon full twice a Day; if grown up, and strong, she is to take, each Time, the Tea-Spoon full.</P>
<P>She is to eat nothing but wholesome Food, and of easy Digestion, such as the young of all Kinds of Animals, Fowls, &amp;c. and to delight in much Exercise with∣out continuing it to a wearisome Fatigue. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> has advised, to take of the Tincture of Black Hellebore thirty Drops, two or three Times a Day; it sometimes produces good Effects; and there is no Harm in trying it alternately, Day about, with the above Electuary, after the latter has been taken for the Term of a Week.</P>
<P>Mineral Waters, especially of the ferrn∣gineous or iron-Class, prove often very ef∣fectual in those Disorders, and may be drunk several Times in a Day in moderate Quantities, followed by some moderate Exercise immediately after. If the Distem∣per be caused by a Suppression of the men∣strual Discharges, it is effectually removed by the Remedies that restore them. When
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>a deep rooted Passion for a Male Object is the Cause, then Marriage with the Object beloved is the most powerful of all Spe∣cifics.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. V.</HI> Of the Furor Uterinus.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Frenzy, or rather, libidinous Rage, all the Female Sex are liable to, not only Maids and Widows, but sometimes even married Women, and es∣pecially those who are disappointed in their conjugal Expectations. It is a continual and insatiable Desire of Copulation. All Re∣gard to Decency is thrown aside. It begins by a morose Silence, and an occasional Spark∣ling of the Eyes. The Patient is kindled at hearing any obscene or wanton Expressions, and her Pulse beats tumultuously; she al∣ternately bursts into Fits of Weeping and Laughing. She soon bids adieu to Shame, and speaks openly and boldly of every Part and Action from which Modesty turns aside. Unhappy Females, a Prey to this Curse, become even so abandoned as to attempt to force Men to satisfy their lustful Desires.</P>
<P>This dreadful and calamitous Disease, is the most disgusting and offensive of all that invade the Female Sex (because the like suffering State in the Males is not held so
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>disgraceful) owes its Origin to some re∣mote, and to some immediate Causes. The remote are the reading obscene Books, hear∣ing immodest Discourses, or the frequent Pre∣sence of a lov'd Object without proceeding to the last Favour. A natural Disposition of the Body, Time of Life, Manner of Liv∣ing; for it is always observed, to seize on those who lead an indolent Life, more than on others. The immediate Causes are an Irritation of the Womb caused by the Acri∣mony of the Humours that are brought thither; or the applying (either through the Patient's own Wantonness, or false Lov∣er's cruel Deceit) external Remedies that are called Provocatives, whether internally taken, or externally applied.</P>
<P>In order that a Cure may be attempted, the Patient must, in the first Place, renounce all Excitements to lustful Sensation, such as Reading, Conversation, Self-touching, &amp;c. She must be copiously and repeatedly let Blood. Her Food must be of the mildest Kind; she must avoid salted Food, high Sauces, all seasoning whatever that may tend to en∣flame. Her Drink must be cooling, such as Whey, or other weak Liquor, with twenty Grains of Nitre, to be dissolved in every Quart.</P>
<P>She must frequently sit in half Baths of warm Water; when out of them let her as often as conveniently she can, convey by
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>Means of a Funnel put into the Vagina, and up towards the Orifice of her Womb, the Vapours of warm Water. She is to take frequent Clysters of warm Water, with two Ounces of Manna dissolved therein, which she is to retain as long as conve∣niently she can. It will not be amiss, from Time to Time, that Blood may be drawn more immediately from the suffering Part, to apply Leeches to the Anus.</P>
<P>By this Process the desired Ends are to be obtained; which are, 1. To diminish the Quantity of irritating Humours. 2. To correct the Acrimony of the remainder by a cooling Diet. 3. To dilute and weaken the local stimulatory Cause, by the Appli∣cation of warm Water in Half-baths and Injections. 4. To act as an immediate Au∣xiliary to the enflamed Womb in the gent∣lest Manner, by Manna's mildly operating in the simple Form of Clysters, and, at the same Time, concurring with the other cu∣rative Views, to release the Fibres from their violent State of Tension, and bring about the wished-for Calm, which cannot be missed of, with the Concomitance of Regularity, Sobriety, and chaste Company.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VI.</HI> Of the Vapours, or Hysteric Passion.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady of the Female Sex ari∣ses mostly from an Accumulating of the Blood in the Bowels, and is caused chiefly by an Hindrance of the menstrual Discharge, which Obstruction is productive of much Mischief to the fair Sex, on ac∣count of their tender Structure. It is fre∣quently accompanied with a Vomiting, a Sense of Suffocation, a violent Compression of the Breast, convulsive Efforts, &amp;c. Mai∣den Ladies (in the true chaste Sense) and Widows, are the most liable to this Com∣plaint. It is sometimes occasioned by too immoderate Evacuations through whatever Means, whether of Bleeding, Puking, Purging, &amp;c. Sometimes by being debarred from a Commerce with the other Sex, in those especially whose Frame consists of too delicate and irritable Fibres.</P>
<P>This very unaccountable Disorder ariseth from many different Sources, and each re∣quires different Views of Cure; thus it is wont to make its dreadful Invasion in what is vulgarly called a Fit. A compressive Pain is felt in the Forehead, a Numbness of the Limbs, a Dimness of the Sight, an uni∣versal Irksomness is diffused through all the
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>Parts; something, as if in a globular Form, seems to force its Way upward through the Throat, and menace immediate Suffocation. The Speech is interrup∣ted, the Heart is in a violent Palpita∣tion, the Pulse is irregular and hard. Very acid Matter, like to a greenish Bile, is thrown out by the Mouth. A tormenting Head-ach fixes in one Part, and is called the <HI>Clavus Hy∣stericus;</HI> racking Pains are felt in the Blad∣der and Kidney, as if the Patient was af∣flicted with the Stone; the Back aches pro∣digiously; an excruciating Tooth-ach often comes in for a Share. The Legs and Arms are cold. Fits of Weeping and Laughing succeed to each other, without any apparent Cause for either, and are accompanied with Convulsions.</P>
<P>The Intention of curing is two-fold; one when the Patients are in the Fit; the other when they are out of it: Let the Body and Limbs be rubbed with warm Flannels; let the Legs be plunged deep into a warm Bath, in which are Camomile Flowers, or Bran, and there be detained for some Time; let the Soles of their Feet be tickled, let the Patients be pulled by the Hair in the most sensible parts, to awaken the Faculty of Feeling; let the Fume of Assa-foetida Leather, Horn, or of any strongly smelling Substance, when burnt, even of Tobacco, be conveyed through a Pipe
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>up their Nostrils. Some Practitioners re∣commend a few Grains of Musk, or Civet tied in a Rag, to be introduced into the Va∣gina, and assert this Method to have often proved very efficacious.</P>
<P>Treatment out of the Fit,—in order to prevent its Return, or, at least, to make it abate of its Violence, when it shall re-ap∣pear: A bleeding in the Foot, to be fol∣lowed in a Day or two by a Vomit of Hy∣pecacoana, fifteen Grains for Girls about Fourteen; twenty Grains for those between Nineteen and Twenty; for those turned of Four and twenty, Twenty-five Grains—the Patients are to drink Camomile-tea by Prefe∣rence, to quicken its Energy, and is productive of very good Effects on this Occasion. The following Remedy has been recommended by very eminent Practitioners, to wit, <HI>Mead, Hoffman,</HI> and others of no less Fame, dos∣ed in these Proportions. Take twenty-four Ounces of simple Pepper-mint-water, of Valerian in Powder two Ounces, and of Lavender-drops one Ounce; let them be perfectly well mixed together, and two or three Times in the Day, let the Patient take three large Tea-Spoonfulls. It is looked upon as a good Method to apply a large Galbanum-plaister to the Navel.—Twelve or fourteen Drops of the Spirit of Harts-horn taken in any proper Vehicle, as weak Tea, Whey, &amp;c. prove a serviceable
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>Medicine. To make use of as a constant Drink, waters impregnated with Iron are a powerful Assistant; and Women who are not situated in the Neighbourhood of such salutary Springs, may, in Part, substitute thereto by heating in the Fire Pieces of old rusty Iron, and plunging them repeatedly into Water, small Beer, Tea, &amp;c. which they drink.</P>
<P>Let those who are liable to this afflicting Disorder, seize on every Opportunity of taking Exercise; and although that on Horse-back hath been accounted the best, yet the others, such as walking, being car∣ried in a Coach, Chair, &amp;c. are beneficial to a certain Point; let them seek all Occa∣sions of Mirth, avoid dull Company, too se∣rious Conversation, melancholy Stories; and if they be single, let them finally mak trial of that powerful Remedy, which the Matrimonial State alone provides, in a lawful and blameless Manner.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="25"/>Disease, and the greatest Tyrant over the tender Sex; to wit, the <HI>Hysteric Passion;</HI> it is now consistent with the strictest Order, that our next process be (on Supposition that the suffering Fair ones have followed our Advice, and taken Refuge in the conjugal State, for the Cure of so grievous a Cala∣mity) to delineate the Changes, the salu∣tary Ailments they are to undergo, in Con∣sequence of their Change of Life, the first whereof is to be in the State of Pregnancy; which is discoverable, and may, beyond all Doubt, be ascertained by the following Signs:</P>
<P>We think it proper to premise, that the Signs of Conception, especially at the Be∣ginning, are very obscure, because common to several other Diseases, and that more over they are different in different Women, which depend, in a great Measure, upon a more or less robust Constitution, and diffe∣rent Manner of Living. However, the following Signs in general are declaratory of a Conception: the <HI>Menses,</HI> or monthly Discharge from the Womb (being at the End of the first, second, or third Month, after having undergone the Embraces of a Man) either entirely suppressed, or at least very much diminished, with a frequent Tendency to Puking; in the fourth Month, and, in some, not until the fifth, a Motion of something alive is felt in the
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>Womb, and, soon after, that inwardly felt Intimation is perceived by others on ap∣plying their Hands on the Belly; there then remains no longer a doubt of the Person's having conceived, being advanced in Preg∣nancy, and big with Child. The Breasts swell to a greater Size than they were wont to be of, by the flowing thither of a serous Fluid, the Forerunner of milk, which oozes out occasionally from, and admonishes them of the Motherly Care they are soon to be charged with in suckling their Children. Around the Nipple are darkish Circles. The swelling or Expansion of the Abdomen, or Belly, is upwards.</P>
<P>All the pretended Foretelling, before its Birth, of what Sex the Child in the Womb is, ought to be treated with the highest Contempt, as a barefaced Imposition on the Belief of weak People, who have no Repugnance to let themselves be made Dupes; provided if wishing for a Son, they are flattered with the Promise of their soon being delivered of one.</P>
<P>A Dropsy is easily distinguished from ad∣vanced Pregnancy, because in the former the swelling is in the lower Part of the Bel∣ly; whereas in the latter it is in the up∣per. Besides, another Proof which puts the Matter out of all Doubt, is, if the Patient's Swelling be Hydropical, that will appear by putting one Hand at either Side of the
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>Person's Belly, and then to pat or push it gently with the other; the Hand on the opposite Side will feel a Fluctuation of Water.</P>
<P>The chief Inconveniencies which preg∣nant Women are liable to, are either a Loss or Depravation of their Appetite, a Nau∣seating, or Tendency to puke, a Listlessness, a Heaviness, an Head-ach, a Diziness, Dif∣ficulty of Breathing, a Swelling of the Feet and Breast, a violent Tooth-ach; in all which Cases proper Rest, as far as their Condition will allow, is required; and that they expose themselves to no great Fatigue. A gentle Bleeding is often not amiss. But if Pregnancy be the Consequence of a private Love Affair, let the Patients com∣municate their Situation to some experi∣enced Female Friend, that may perhaps be able to advise; or at least able to apply for them to the skilled in Physic. We pur∣posely avoid giving any Directions, through Fear of dangerous Consequences, either by Misapprehension, or unskilful Ap∣plication.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VIII.</HI> Abortion or Miscarriage.</HEAD>
<P>THE Female Disease next, in order to Pregnancy, is Abortion, which is the premature Exclusion of the Foetus ma∣ny Months before the natural Term. This Disaster most commonly happens in the third Month, or thereabout; the most dan∣gerous to the Mothers are those that hap∣pen on the fifth Month. To avoid being the Cause of any Mischief, we, for the same Reasons as in the preceeding Chapter, decline directing any complicated Remedy. Yet when these Forerunners of an Abortion are felt; to wit, a Pain in the Bottom of the Matrix, or Womb, or in the inward Parts of the Thighs, as well as slight shi∣verings between the Skin and the Flesh, and at the same Time the Belly becomes depressed and flattish about the Navel from pointed, which it had been in that Part at the Beginning of such Symptoms, Linseed has been often proved a very good Remedy to prevent a Miscarriage, or Abortion. It may not also be amiss to bleed about the third Month of Pregnancy, more or less, according to the Strength of the Person; and during the first Months particularly, let it be remembered, that the Body is to be kept open with Rhubarb, or Senna, or other
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>Purgative of the mild Class. We cannot finish this Section more profitably to the Common-wealth, than with a truly physical, moral and religious inculcating to young Maids, who may have unfortunately been seduced, to beware of, and shun, as they would Poison, all Remedies which the wicked recommend to cause Abortions, and for the following Reasons, obvious to the meanest Capacity.</P>
<P>The Remedies that have been cried up by Ignorance and Vice, as capable of caus∣ing an Abortion, or Miscarriage, are in Fact, nay absolutely not endowed with any such especial Faculty; for the Way that they act towards, and contribute to that Pur∣pose, is by the Violence with which they exert themselves when introduced into the human Body; where, by the outrageous Tumult which they cause, they are some∣times productive of the too early Expul∣sion of the Foetus from the Womb, all shaken and convulsed, by the general Com∣motion caused throughout the Mother's Frame, which storm likewise frequently causeth her Death; so by one unhappy Deed she is guilty of Self-murder, and that of her Child.</P>
<P>But in those Constitutions where such ac∣cursed Remedies cannot operate the wish∣ed and diabolical Effect of murdering, and prematurely driving the Foetus out of the
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>Womb, whether through too great an Ad∣hesion, or strong Contexture of the Parts, &amp;. then they exercise all their malignant Power on the Constitution of the unhappy Mother, which they ruin for ever after; and thus she shortens her Date of Life, as but too many fatal Instances have been known in Practice.</P>
<P>If they have no feeling for their yet un∣born Babes let them have some Regard for their own Health, and well being, in this World; which, should they overlook, let them tremble at the Certainty of their be∣ing to appear before a tremendous Judge on the last Day, and there to receive the Sen∣tence of eternal Torture for the most de∣testable, the most barbarous and inhuman of all Crimes, a Mother guilty of the Mur∣der of her own Child; nay, of tearing it bleeding ftom her own Womb before its al∣lotted Time of Delivery. To mangle its ten∣der Thread of Life! Nature shudders at the Thought—The most wild, most savage, and most ferocious Beasts that howl Terror through dreary Forests or Desarts, never commit so monstrous a Deed.—</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> Of a Mole.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Term Mole, is to be understood nothing more than a fleshy Substance generated in the Womb; it is most com∣monly of a spherical Form, and, until ocular Conviction after its Delivery, or a Continuance long beyond the Time of Child-bearing, hath been mistaken for the true Consequence of a Conception, a Foe∣tus, or Child in the Womb.</P>
<P>Its Dimensions vary from the common Size of an Infant down to that of a large Nut-shell. Some are of a membranous Texture, others of a softish or spongy Consistence, and have, in their middle, a Cavity. They sometimes abound with lit∣tle Bladders, called Hydatides, and, at others, they are replete with a serous Mat∣ter.</P>
<P>Moles are apt to alarm those who are troubled with them, by a Display of Symp∣toms at first not unlike to those of Wo∣men really with Child. They differ much afterwards; for a dull heavy Weight, like a Ball of Lead, is felt when a Mole is the Case; but it never does (like a living Foe∣tus) exhibit a vibratory Motion to any Hand applied on the Outside of the Abdo∣men,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>which, in the State of undoubted Pregnancy, is spherical and roundish.</P>
<P>A Mole in itself menaces no Peril to the Patient; and all the Danger or Difficulty, that it is liable to be accompanied with, consists chiefly in the Manner of freeing the Womb from so useless an Incumbrance: for otherwise Women have been known to have carried them for many Years; nay, even to a very advanced Age in Life, with∣out suffering any other Inconvenience than the being troubled, from Time to Time, with the disagreeable Sensation of a listless Weight, and a teazing Uneasiness.</P>
<P>The most ignorant of the Sex may be persuaded, beyond any Possibility of a doubt, that they have a <HI>Mole</HI> in the Womb, when they perceive that an Increase of Bulk and Weight has exceeded by far the usual Time of Gestation or Child-bearing, which in general exceeds not nine Months, and the utmost Indulgence of Physicians to cover the Reputation of great Ladies hath never let it stretch beyond eleven, the Truth of which Complaisance is much doubted of, and not without Reason.</P>
<P>The Certainty of a <HI>Mole</HI> in the Womb being established, the next Attention is to eject an idle Occupant of the first Cradle of human Existence, for the two-fold Rea∣son of being useless in itself, and preven∣tive
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>of introducing there what may prove the reverse.</P>
<P>The Method to be followed by those who do not chuse to run the Risk of vio∣lent internal Remedies, which ought not to be ventured on without proper Advice, is to take the fresh slender Root of a Walnut Tree, not exceeding in Length the Palm of the Hand, then to shave and polish it to the Thickness of a middle-sized Finger, which is to be introduced, from Time to Time, into the <HI>Vagina,</HI> where it will ex∣cite a tingling Sensation of Heat, and that being communicated to the Womb will provoke it to Action, and cause it, in Time, to eject its inanimate Contents, whether it be a real or dead Foetus, a Mole, or any Concretion formed in the Womb in Conse∣quence of a former Delivery not happily conducted. It will not be amiss to accom∣pany the above Application with the Repe∣tition of a pretty strong Puke, and Purga∣tive, alternately, that is, within a few Days Distance of each; in order to accele∣rate the desired Effect. The Dose of the Puke or Purgative is to be settled by the Patients, which in this Case is to be en∣creased beyond that which is wont to work them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. X.</HI> Dropsy of the Uterus, or Womb.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Distemper of the female Sex, and which by Practitioners, in all Treatises upon their Maladies, is called <HI>a Dropsy of the Uterus,</HI> is obviously distin∣guishable from the common Dropsy of the Abdomen or Belly, and for this very strik∣ing Reason, because in the former the Dropsy of the Womb, by the Appearance both to the Eye and Touch is confined to the Region or Neighbourhood of the Ute∣rus or Womb, and is round, circumscribed and prominent. But it is quite the con∣trary in the other Dropsy, because then the whole Belly is equally swelled.</P>
<P>The curing a Dropsy of the <HI>Womb</HI> is not attended with so much Difficulty as curing that of the Belly. Sometimes nothing more is necessary than hard riding, or any other violent Exercise, accompanied as in the Cure of Mole, dead Foetus, &amp;c. with strong Pukes, and Purges, from Time to Time.</P>
<P>The following simple Injection has been found of great Use—Get an Ounce of <HI>Ipe∣cacoana</HI> boiled in a Pint of Water till the Quantity be diminished about a Quarter; then let it be put by to cool—When to be
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>used, which may be every Morning, as the Action of the Day will forward its Effect, let it be warmed to that Degree a Clyster commonly is, and then be injected up through the <HI>Vagina</HI> towards the Orifice of the Womb, the Patient lying on her Back, in which Situation she is to continue as long as she can; and if for a Quarter of an Hour, so much the better; because by that Means the Remedy will have the more Time to make its desired Impression.</P>
<P>It will not be amiss to take internally of the Tincture of Jalap and Florentine Orris mixed together, one Tea-spoon full just before Tea-time in the Morning and Evening; and constantly to put a small Quantity of Saffron into their Tea will not be unserviceable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XI.</HI> The Falling down of the Womb.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is in the Writings of emi∣nent Physicians called <HI>Procidentia Uteri,</HI> and which, for the being readily un∣derstood by the most vulgar Capacity, we have translated <HI>The Falling down of the Womb,</HI> is, alas! too common a Disorder in that Part, and easily known by presenting
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>itself between the Lips of the <HI>Vagina,</HI> and preventing an Entrance into it.</P>
<P>This Distemper is rather more incom∣modious and disagreeable than dangerous—The first View of Cure is to reduce the Uterus, and the next, to retain it in its proper Situation.—To answer the first View of reducing it, a common Clyster must be taken in order to discharge the Gut that is next to it, called the Rectum, of any ex∣cremental Lodgment.</P>
<P>The Patient must be let Blood three or four Times; and there must also be applied emollient or softening Plaisters, as of White Bread and Milk.—A few warm Baths will be of Use, because, by their Means, the Parts will be properly relaxed. Then must the Patient lie on her Back, with her Hips raised much higher than her Head, and her Legs must be separated to a proper Distance. Then in a most gentle and gra∣dual Manner is the Womb to be put back, and in that Direction where it meets with the least Obstacle. When this Operation is performed, the Patient, still taking Care to keep her Hips raised, and Legs across, is to remain in Bed about a Fortnight.</P>
<P>But to put a finishing Hand to the Cure, an astringent Medicine, dexterously applied, will be necessary; such as for Instance—a Quarter of a Pound of the Bark of Oak, with two Oun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of Misletoe, boiled in
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>two Quarts of Water, until reduced to one Quart; then lay it aside for Use. It is to be twice a Day injected with a proper De∣gree of Warmth up through the Vagina towards the Womb—And in the Vagina, on going to rest at Night, ought to be in∣troduced as high as convenient, an adapted Piece of Sponge; or else soft Linen Rags twisted into a circular Form, and well soaked in the above Decoction of the Bark of Oak and Misletoe; the longer it is re∣tained in the Part, so much the better.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XII.</HI> On Delivery, or Child-birth, and after-Pains.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the Inconveniencies that most commonly attend Women approach∣ing to the Time of Delivery, or of being brought to Bed, is a Difficulty of making Water, which in general may be removed without taking any inward Remedy, or applying any outward, and that by raising the Belly. For the Pressure of the Womb (big with a grown Foetus) on the Sphincter or Outlet of the Bladder, is frequently the Cause of such Stoppage.</P>
<P>When Things are so far gone as to be near Child-birth, since from the extraor∣dinary Bulk of the Patient, it can be no
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>longer kept a Secret, were there even a Ne∣cessity for so doing; then it is prudent to lay aside ill-timed Modesty, and Applica∣tion is to be made to those who practice in that Branch, whether they be of the Male or Female Sex; especially when Nature seems in Danger of meeting Difficulties she cannot overcome, although, in most cases, she is sufficient of herself; and great Mischief is often caused by conceited Pra∣ctitioners thwarting her Operation. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> advises, for the quickening of a De∣livery, that a Grain of purified Opium be divided into two Pills, one to be taken six Hours after the other.</P>
<P>About an Hour after the Delivery the Mother ought to take a Tea-spoon full of the Oil of Sweet Almonds, and that re∣peatedly, if it appear requisite, in order to soothe the subsequent Pains. Then let a Cataplasm, made up of Oil of Sweet Al∣monds two Ounces, with two or three new laid Eggs boiled together, be applied to the Parts, and, for the Space of two Days, be renewed every six Hours.</P>
<P>If the Pains after Delivery prove violent and menacing, then the following Prescrip∣tion has been experienced of the greatest Use: Take two Scruples of Sperma Ceti; ten Grains of volatile Salts of Hartshorn; ten Drops of Balsam of Peru, and one Drachm of Venice Treacle; let them
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>be carefully mixed with as much Syrup of White Poppies as will suffice to be made into four Doses; one to be taken every six Hours, till the Pains disappear; the Pati∣ent is to drink Caudle very plentifully, and to be kept very warm.</P>
<P>In about fifteen Days after Delivery, and a vanishing of the Pains attendant thereon, the late suffering Parts are to be bathed with an astringent Decoction that they may be braced up; which Decoction is to con∣sist of Half a Pint of red Wine, wherein are to be boiled red Roses and Balaustins as chief Ingredients.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as after all Births that are any ways laborious, the Mother is in general weak, and very apt to faint, it will be ne∣cessary, and far from imprudent, by the Means of a Glass of hot Wine, or other generous Liquor, to comfort and keep up her Spirits. The same is to be repeated as often as she shall appear to stand in need thereof. Comfortable Broths greatly con∣tribute to forward a Recovery of Strength. All other Occurrences of a more intricate Tendency are to be remedied by professed Practitioners.</P>

<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XIII.</HI> The Lochia.</HEAD>
<P>THE Advice with which we have closed the last Section, must take Place relative to the Disorders of this Dis∣charge immediately after Child-bearing, whether in Excess or diminished, because then the Patient, on account of so en∣feebled a State, can be of no Service to herself, and the relying on Friends in ge∣neral is dangerous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XIV.</HI> Disorders of the Breasts after Child-bearing.</HEAD>
<P>THAT which commonly takes the Lead, and is therefore reckoned the first, because it appears the third or fourth Day after Delivery, is caused by a Con∣gestion, or Gathering of Milk in both the Breasts, or in either of them. It is thence called the Milk Fever.</P>
<P>It is usually accompanied with a tensive or excruciating Pain: and also with a Tumor or swelling of both the Breasts, or either, that frequently extend to both Arm-pits, or at least to that of the Breasts affected.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
<P>This Pain of the Arm-pits is sometimes violent to a most insupportable Degree. It is wont to persevere for the Space of one to two Days, and then puts an End to it∣self by copious Sweats, (always proportion∣ed to the preceding cold Sweats) by which it is diverted out of the Body as a Benefit of Nature.</P>
<P>In some Cases, however, there may be a Necessity of using gentle diaphoretic Re∣medies that encrease Perspiration, or some of the hot diluting ones to assist and encou∣rage the disembarrassing of the Vessels in the Breasts; to which the Child ought of∣ten to be put, and the Mother confine her∣self to a strict Diet.</P>
<P>But if it should not be the Intention of the Patient to suckle the Child, then a more strict Regimen is to be observed, and a proper Person is to be procured to draw the Breasts, from Time to Time, which will contribute to hinder a Gathering there.</P>
<P>Moreover, a thickening of the Milk is to be hindered by embrocating the Breast with Oil of Sweet Almonds, or even with Linseed Oil. Nay, a warm Application of the Leaves of red Cabbage hath proved be∣neficial on such Occasions, as have also double Cloths dipped in Brandy, and then put under the Arm-pits. But if the Milk Fever should prove very hot, acute, and threaten immediate Inflammation, then Re∣course must be had to Bleeding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XV.</HI> An Inflammation of the Breasts.</HEAD>
<P>IF, in a short Time after Child-birth, there happens a stagnating of the Milk, accompanied with a Swelling and a Pain, it is called an Inflammation of the Breasts. Then inwardly let gentle Cordials be taken; and externally apply hot Linen Cloths steeped in Rum. Care must be taken to have the Milk drawn off some how or other, whether by the Mouth of an Animal, such as a Puppy, or the Hand of the Nurse, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But should the Swelling, caused by a Stag∣nation of Milk, be observed to be without Heat, then, with all possibe Speed, let the Part be bathed with red Wine made warm, or Spirit of Wine camphorated. Nay, the Cataplasm or Plaister of white Bread, and red Wine boiled together, with the Addi∣tion of some camphorated Spirit of Wine, has been recommended as a successful Re∣medy by some very good Practitioners.</P>
<P>When the Swelling appears inclinable to break, then make Use of a softening Plai∣ster, particularly the common one with the Gums which will ripen it to an Opening. As soon as it shall be opened, take Care to cleanse it with a digestive Ointment, to heal
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>it with balsamic Remedies, particularly the Balsam of Peru, to be had at any apotheca∣ry's shop.—Women, in this disorder, are li∣able to a disagreeable attendant upon it, and that is, a Chapping in the Nipples, which in that case are to be anointed with a mix∣ture of oil and bees wax.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XVI.</HI> An Inflammation of the Uterus, or Womb.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady happens frequently to Child-bed Women, at the same time of the Milk Fever appearing; however, if proper care be taken to oppose its progress in the Beginning all will go well. There∣fore let the Patient take inwardly oil of sweet Almonds alone to the Quantity of Half an Ounce. But for exterior Remedy, let the whole Abdomen, or Belly, be duly anointed with Oil of Dill an Ounce, with the same Quantity of white Lillies and Ca∣momile, to which add a Drachm either of Camphire or Caraways, over which a double Napkin must be laid.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XVII.</HI> The Cancer.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady is incidental either to the Womb or Breasts in Women. It begins at first with a small Swelling, no
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>exceeding a Nut in Bigness; nor does the Colour of the Skin, on the Breasts, undergo any sudden Change, because the Cancer, without causing any terrifying Alarms in its first Stages, continueth, as it were, a silent Progress for many Years.</P>
<P>But when the fostering Humours of that Evil is endowed with a greater Degree of Activity, the Swelling is suddenly enlarged into a great, unequal, round, and livid Tu∣mour, accompanied with a racking Pain.</P>
<P>Finally, it terminates in a Rupture, and thence discharges a Blood-urged Stinking, and acrimonious Humour, which, by prey∣ing upon the Parts that are sound, render the Lips of the Wound ghastly and horrible to Sight, nay often Death.</P>
<P>The Cancer of the Womb seldom ad∣mits of any Cure, because the Patient, ge∣nerally speaking, is in a desperate State be∣fore it can be ascertained. The Cancer of the Breasts, as well as of the other Parts, if timely taken in hand, is often cured; for which End the following Remedy is recom∣mended for its powerful Virtue by a very eminent Physician. Get two Ounces of the Shavings of Guaiacum, which boil in two Quarts of Water, and let it continue to boil until it be reduced to three Pints. Half a Pint of this Decoction is to be drank twice a day.</P>
<P>For external Application—Make use of a fomentation of Milk and Water, in which
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>Camomile Flowers had been boiled and let that be succeeded by a Pultice of White Bread and Milk.</P>
<P>The Patient must be ever mindful that the Cancer must be preserved with all imaginable Care from every Impression of the cold Air, on which, for that Purpose, ought constantly to be spread a little of the Sperma Ceti Ointment, which salutary Practice ought to be renewed every Day two or three Times.</P>
<P>We cannot conclude the present Section with a more essential Advice to all labour∣ing under this Distemper, than to bid them avoid dealing with ignorant Quacks, or No∣strum Retailers for a Cure, because the tak∣ing such a step must lead to certain Danger.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XVIII.</HI> Ulcer of the Womb.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal and determining Sign by which this Malady may be known is by a Discharge of stinking and purulent Matter that is streaked all over with Blood and the greater the Quantity oozing from it is, the deeper you may pronounce the Ul∣cer to be: But when the flowing Matter is not distained with Blood, then no more than the serous and lymphatic Vessels are affected; but when it is of a reddish colour, then, to a certainty, the Blood Vessels are attacked.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
<P>The following Injection is recommended: Let an Ounce of Honey of Roses in half a Pint of Water be heated to a proper De∣gree, to wit, such as can be borne without exciting a Sense of Pain, which, by means of a Sponge, is to be applied through the Vagina on the ailing Part several Times in the Day. Half a Tea Spoon-full of the Tincture of Myrrh may be added to each Injection.</P>
<P>But in order to correct the Acrimony of the Blood, a Milk Diet is the most effectual, which may be relieved, from Time to Time, by the Use of Herb Soups, light Broths, as of Veal, Chicken, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have now treated sufficiently of all those Distempers incidental to the Fair Sex; and which every Individual, either through their own Sagacity, or with the assistance of some intelligent Female Friend, may safely un∣dertake the cure of.—There are no cases omitted, but those quite out of their Reach to bring any Help to, and that require both the Inspection, as well as Operation, of a skilful Surgeon.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, a few slight Diseases, or rather Deficiences of Nature in the mar∣ried State, that obstruct the Propagation of the Species; but Decency forbids me to mention any thing about them, lest Liber∣tinism should make a vicious Use thereof.</P>
