<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F ever <HI>France</HI> had Reason to be <HI>joyful,</HI> she has as much Reason now to <HI>consider</HI> the greatest <HI>Adversity</HI> that ever could befall an unhappy People, now involving some of her richest Cities in the most inexpressive Mi∣sery and Woe. When I talk after this Man∣ner,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>every Body knows I mean the <HI>Plague,</HI> which now rages with such invincible Fury in its extreme Parts; and, in all Probability without a particular Turn of Providence, must rage too in its very Bowels. And thus, <HI>France,</HI> once the Terror of its Neighbours, is now be∣come the Object of their Pity and Commise∣ration. Alas! <HI>How are the Mighty fallen! How unsearchable,</HI> O Thou One Eternal Being, <HI>are thy Counsels, and thy Ways past finding out!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, human Life is Nothing but one con∣tinued Series of Miseries; and we are born to Trouble, whic his as natural to befall us, as for the Sparks to fly upwards; or to use the Words of a Modern

<P>The Time of <HI>Consideration</HI> is arrived; <HI>Adver∣sities</HI> enough surround us through the unnatu∣ral Ruin of our own once flourishing and glori∣ous Country, and how far the dreadful Cala∣mity, raging so furiously among our Neigh∣bours may reach us, Heaven only knows. <HI>Prox∣imus ardet,</HI> when the next House is on Fire,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>it requires all our serious Consideration, At∣tention, and Application, to prevent catching hold of our own.</P>
<P>To do this, we ought to make use of all the Helps of Nature and Art; and the rich, who have Means to procure both, will not want all possible Aid and Care: The Poor and the middle Sort, are here, as in all other Cases, to be the greatest Sufferers. It is for the Sake of those I publish this small, but I hope, useful Treatise.</P>
<P>The <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Apothecaries</HI> surely will not take this amiss, it would be cruel to think so; I know there are but two sorts of these, the Good, and the Bad; the Good will not, and as for the Bad, those very few are not worth our Notice.</P>
<P>I am very well satisfied, that there have come into the World a great many ingenious Trea∣tises relating to the <HI>Plague;</HI> but as they have been, for the most Part, very speculative, they have served rather to display the fine Genius of their several Authors, than to be of any real Use to Mankind. Alas! What avails it to know the nice Definitions of a Distemper, its remote and proximate Causes, and a long Jargon of Particles, Effluvias, Insects, and that infinite <HI>Gallimatias</HI> of Pestilential and pestiferous Ve∣hicles, if I know not how to preserve my self from their Contagion, or rid my self of it, when I am so unhappy as to labour under it? What I shall do then, in the following Pages,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>is in the plainest and most easy Terms, familiar to the meanest Capacity to write what I have learnt in relation to that which may be service∣able to my Reader concerning the Plague, which I am afraid, I have too just Fears, will, in all Probability, without a particular Providence of the most High, visit our already too wretched and undone Country.</P>
<P>But that I may not burthen my Readers Me∣mory and Attention, I shall, as short as the Na∣ture of the Thing will admit of, present them with what are my Sentiments hereupon; and for Order Sake, divide this little Treatise into four Heads or Chapters.</P>

<ITEM>I. <HI>The First relates to Apparel or Lodging.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>The Second to Diet.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>The Third to Antidotes or Preservatives:</HI> And,</ITEM>

</LIST>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of Apparel and Diet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' at all Times we ought to abstain from all Manner of Excess, yet chiefly ought we so to do in the Time of Pestilence; especially from Excess of outward and inward Heat, as that of the Sun, Fire, Cloaths, and hot Air, all very pernicious; this I call outward Heat; inward Heat is such as proceeds from too much eating of Salt, and salted Meats, Spices, and all Food of a strong and intense Heat, and all strong Malt Liquors, and strong Wines and Spirits.</P>
<P>Violent Exercises are also to be avoided, such as provoke <HI>Sweatings,</HI> and particularly, <HI>Co∣ition,</HI> and all the Passions of the Mind. One must likewise abstain from all Repletion of Meat and Drink, that is, to rise from Table without loading your <HI>Stomach.</HI> The other Excess too is equally dangerous, I mean too great a Hunger and Thirst; a great deal of
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>Sleep, especially at Day-Time, is also to be carefully avoided, as well as letting the Body be too much bound up or costive: Thus much in General.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Apparel,</HI> what is made of Linnen, is certainly best; thick Woollens are apt to gather Infections; but Silk and Furs, and Stuffs made of Hair, are principally to be shunned, because they very easily admit the contagious Air, and retain it a long while. But above all, let every body be particularly careful in being clean in their Dress, as well as Lodging. <HI>Hangings</HI> are by no Means to be allowed, bare Walls, or plain, unpainted Wainscot, are the best Furniture; these cannot be kept too fresh and clean.</P>
<P>The frequent Washings among the <HI>Jews,</HI> though they had something mystical in them, and were a Part of their Religion, were yet very conducive to Health; and in Reality, there can be no Religion in being a Sloven; <HI>Pauper∣tatem &amp; non Sorditiem Habitus diligit Deus,</HI> God loves the Poverty, not the Slovenliness of a Habit, said St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> of some dirty Reli∣gious of his Time. The good old Man thought there was no Religion at all in being dirty or lousy.</P>
<P>The first Thing that is to be done in the Morning by those that wear their Hair, is to comb it with an Ivory Comb Forty Times at least, from the Forehead towards the Pole; after that, let them wash all the Organs of the
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>Senses, that is, the Eyes, Ears, Mouth, Tongue, and Teeth; in short, the whole Face, with pure Water, and they who wear Wigs, are to wash their Head in like Manner. The Eyes are not only to be washed, but dipt, or plunged into cold Water, and all the Foulness removed from the Eye-lids with this cold Water; it is very necessary sometimes to mix Rose-water, or Fennel-water and good strong White∣wine Vinegar; and after the Neck is washed, which must never be omitted, let it be rubbed with a Towel, somewhat coarser than ordi∣nary. All this comforts the Body, makes the Mind more lively and chearful, and preserves the Sight.</P>
<P>The Gums and Mouth ought to be particu∣larly taken Care to be washed and cleansed, and especially the Teeth; to do which, no∣thing is more proper than the following Den∣tifrices, or Teeth-Powders, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A cheap Powder to cleanse the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take three dried Egg-shells, of Red Coral three Drams, a small Quantity of the Threads of white Silk burnt to Ashes in a new earthen Pot or Pipkin; Cinnamon, one Dram; Cloves, two Drams; Pelitory-Root, two Drams.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
<P>Reduce all to a very fine Powder, and rub your Teeth every Night and Morning, wash∣ing them with cold Water mixed with Vine∣gar, or Rose-water, or both: you may buy the Red Coral of the Apothecary, ready pow∣dered.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Red and White Coral, of each one Ounce; Pelitory-Root, Mace, and Mastick, of each an Ounce; of Pumice-stone, and Bole Ar∣moniack, of each an Ounce.</HI></P>
<P>Reduce all to a very fine Powder, searsing the same through a Tiffany Searse, as you should the former.</P>
<P>Purify your Chamber and your Cloaths with clear Fires made of Juniper, Cypress, Pine, or Ash-wood; as also with frequent Sprinklings of Rose-water and Vinegar. It is also very good to strew about your Rooms, sweet Herbs, and Flowers, as Roses, Violets, Vine-leaves, Pennyroyal, Thyme, Lavender, and the like, and frequently to make use of several Kinds of odoriferous Fumes to purge and purify the Air, and perfume your self and Cloaths, and very often to wash your Hands and Face every Day with Water mixed with Vinegar and Rose∣water, and never go abroad without a Piece
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>of the Root of Dittany, or Zedoary, or some candid Spice, in your Mouth, and a Nosegay, or some refreshing Persume in your Hand; among which, I recommend a little Box of <HI>Warham</HI>'s <HI>Apoplectick Balsam,</HI> made only at the <HI>Golden Ball</HI> in <HI>Fisher-Street,</HI> near <HI>Red-Lyon-Square;</HI> which is of wonderful Efficacy, and with which it is good to anoint or smear a little the Temples; Eye-brows, and Nostrils: and always just before you go out, take a Piece of Bay-leaf, or Orange-peel, or Juniper Berries, which being bruised and soaked in a little Vi∣negar, pour upon a red hot Iron, hold your Head over the Fumes, receiving them into your Mouth, Nostrils, and every Part of your Body and Cloaths. Some will not go out without a little Bunch of Hyssop, or Rue, which is very good.</P>
<P>Those who can take Tobacco, would do well to smoke a Pipe in the Morning the first thing they do. Dr. <HI>Evans,</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Col∣lege in <HI>Oxford,</HI> told me not long since, that he designed Tobacco should be his chief Me∣dicine whenever it should please God to visit us, and that he would fume his Chambers and Cloaths with nothing else; which may be very good for those who are used to Tobac∣co; and I have been told, that during the last Sickness in <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Tobacconists</HI> esca∣ped the Contagion.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
<P>Having mentioned several Fumes and sweet Waters, I shall here give a Receipt how to make those most useful, which because they are cheap, and easily made, may probably be not much esteemed by some, who love Nothing but what is costly; but I write for the general Good.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A Receipt for an Useful Odoriferous Sweet-Water.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Rose-water, and strong White-Wine, that is, good</HI> Mountain, <HI>or</HI> Lisbon, (Madera, <HI>if you can conveniently have it) of each an equal Quantity; of Vinegar of Roses, a Fourth Part; Loaf Sugar, a third Part; which dissolve there∣in; some add a little Saffron, which is certain∣ly better.</HI></P>
<P>With this wash your Hands, Face, and Joynts, as also your Eyes, and rince your Teeth, and sprinkle with it your Linnen; and if you swallow down a little, it would not be amiss. But that you may not mistake the Quantities of each, I shall here give a particular Receipt or Recipe.</P>
<P><HI>Take of the best Vinegar of Roses, four Ounces; of Rose-water, and the strongest and best flavour'd White-wine, of each one Pound, that is, of each a</HI> Winchester <HI>Pint; of the best Saffron, one Scruple; of Loaf-Sugar,
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>to be dissolved in the Liquor,</HI> 3 <HI>or</HI> 4 <HI>Ounces.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take a Pint and a half of Rose-water, in which half an Ounce of Cinnamon has steeped two Days; of Mace, one Dram; Violet Roots, two Drams; of Cloves, half a Dram; Nutmeg, one Dram; all which having distilled, add five Grains of Saffron.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another more costly.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Rose-water, three Pints; fresh La∣vender Flowers well picked, three Handfulls; fresh Cloves and Cinnamon, of each half an Ounce; White Violet Roots, two Drams; Mace, two Drams; dry'd Rose Leaves, one Handful; Gum Benzoin, vulgarly call'd Benjamin, two Drams; Storax Calamita, two Drams; Musk and Amber, two Grains. Add to these an Ounce of strong Mountain Wine, set all, being well mixed in a Glass Vessel well stopt, in the Sun for one Month.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sweet Candles, good against the Plague, and all Pestilential Distempers.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Labdanum, three Ounces; Storax, ten Drams; Benzoin, six Drams; Frankin∣cense,

<P>Let all these be mixed up with Rose-wa∣ter, and Gum Tragacanth, and put over a Fire, till they are reduced into a Paste, of which make small Candles, and let them dry gently.</P>

<P>These may be perfumed with six Grains of Musk and Amber, dissolved in Oyl of Cloves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to make sweet Pastills.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Gum Benzoin, two Ounces; Cinna∣mon, and Xyloaloes, or Lignum Aloes, of each half an Ounce; Storax, one Ounce; fine Sugar, eight Ounces; Musk, sixteen Grains, dissolved in Rose-water.</HI> All which mix up with an In∣fusion of Gum Tragacanth in Rose-water.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
<P>A rare curious Receipt how to make other Odoriferous Pastills more rich and costly, particularly made use of by the Countess of <HI>Arnsburg,</HI> which I here insert as a very valuable Rarity.</P>
<P><HI>Take four Ounces of White Roses, pull off the Leaves, to which, after they have been well pounded in a Mortar, add two Ounces of Gum Benzoin, that has lain twenty four Hours dis∣selv'd in Rose-water; to these add, of Amber, two Grains; Musk, one Grain; and the fourth Part of a Grain of Civet.</HI> Mix these last well on a Marble Stone, and then incorporate them with the Roses.</P>
<P>Add to all half an Ounce of the finest Sugar, let the whole, being well ground to∣gether, stay eight and forty Hours stopt close up in a Mortar, out of which make your Pastills; but you must not forget to mix with it some Gum Tragacanth dissolved in Rose∣water, and roll up every Pastill in a little Dragon's Blood, that they may dry the sooner, then wrap up every Pastill in two Rose Leaves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>But because burning of these Candles, Balls, and Pastills, must necessarily occasion Smoke in the Rooms where they are so burnt, which may in some measure affect the Head and Lungs, I would advise you to cast them into a silver Dish, or (those who cannot have Silver,
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>may make use of what they can get, an earthen Pipkin well glaz'd will do, or a Tin or Pew∣ter Dish, but by no Means use Brass or Cop∣per) which set over a Lamp or Candle, and the Fumes will be more agreeable.</P>
<P>This manner of Fuming is frequent among the <HI>Italians,</HI> especially among Persons of Di∣stinction, who have generally one of these Sweet Pots fuming in a Corner of their Rooms.</P>
<P>You may use any of the Sweet Waters above-mentioned, after this manner.</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this Head, and have described the greater Variety of Re∣ceipts, according to the Variety of the Sea∣son, and my Readers Purses; but for the poorer Sort of all, I shall give them a Re∣ceipt which they may almost always make use of, which is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Take a little White Wine Vinegar, if you add Rose-water, 'twill be the better; which set over a Lamp or Candle, when it begins to fume, put in two or three Bay Leaves, a few Cloves, a little Cinnamon and Mace, all bruised, and let all fume together; a little</HI> Seville <HI>O∣range Peel, or Lemon Peel, makes it yet more agreeable.</HI></P>
<P>These Fumes are excellent against all man∣ner of <HI>Pestilential Infection,</HI> and purify the Air.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
<P>And besides all these, you must often wash your Mouth with Vinegar, boiled up with Rue and Hyssop, and especially when you cannot get any of these Fumes, tho' I think it will be almost an Impossibility not to compass what I have last described; but never be without a Piece of Zedoary, which now and then you must chew, especially when you go abroad.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of Diet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very easy to describe what Kind of Diet should be used in such Times of Sickness, but it is not so easy for all People to observe it. I shall only say in general, that such Food as the Appetite most delights in, is the best: and of Consequence, that which it does not care for, ought to be avoided. I do not speak here of a depraved Appetite, which has been ruined and debauched by Luxury, for there can be no Rules prescri∣bed for such, at least what it will observe.</P>
<P>The simpler, and the more plain the Diet is, the better. And here I could wish Man had kept up to Nature, and followed what the great Creator of all Things had
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>prescribed to the Infant World, and had still fed on that innocent Food, the Fruits and Herbs of the Earth, and Milk, and the Gol∣den Productions of the Industrious <HI>Bee:</HI> Then would his Blood have flowed free from those noxious Juices engendred from such a Heterogeneous Commixture of the Spirits of so many Thousand Animals which an unbounded cruel Luxury continually sacrifices and de∣lights.</P>
<P>Before the Flood, Men did not eat the Flesh of Animals, and yet they lived much longer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jewish</HI> Law, indeed, in some measure indulged its Followers in this Respect; but it must be remembred, the Bill of Divorce was in like manner tolerated, for the Hardness of their Hearts. The Flesh Pots of <HI>Egypt,</HI> (the <HI>French</HI> Ragous of that Time) ran in their Minds; but a Toleration is a quite different Thing from an Approbation; and how many Restrictions this Toleration was attended with, every one knows that looks into the Bible; the most delicious Food was absolutely for∣bidden, as Swines Flesh, and all Shell Fish; and the manner of dressing was such, as re∣quired the utmost Scrutiny in Relation to the Health of the Animal; and the Blood, as the Life or Soul, was particularly prohibited.</P>
<P>But the Christian, who has a better Reli∣gion, who professes to follow a suffering Lord, and Self-denying Saviour, tyrannizes over the
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>whole Creation, flies at all, and without the least Remorse or Scruple, devours Things strangled, and swallows Blood, though ex∣presly forbidden in the same Place with For∣nication, in that which he owns to be written by Inspiration, and a Law decreed by the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>The poor Cow, to instance no more, after having fed Families with her own Dugs, must by cruel, ungrateful Man, be knock'd on the Head, for all her good Offices, and at last de∣voured; and the tender Lamb, just dropt from its Mother, (true Emblem of sweetest Inno∣cence) be snatched, kneeling at the Teat, and sacrificed to satisfy the Appetite, perhaps of a lewd Harlot.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Man</HI> is the Lord of the Crea∣tion; so is a Master of his Family: But what Lord devours his own Subjects? Or, what Father feasts upon his own Children and Servants?</P>
<P>I could answer all the vain, idle, frivolous Objections, that have been raised against this unlawful Practice of destroying the Creation; but my Business is not to write of Controver∣sy, but Health; and however novel this may seem to some, I am sure, its opposite is only an ancient inveterate Error.</P>
<P>And I am satisfied, that Men, if they would or could abstain from eating the Flesh of Ani∣mals, wou'd find themselves much better in Health; for it is that dreadful mixture of
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>the Souls, if I may say so, of so many thousand Animals, destroy'd to pamper one, that raises that terrible War in the Blood, which has made it a Prey to such Distempers, as have baffled the Skill of the most learned Physicians.</P>
<P>Let us cast our Eyes towards <HI>India,</HI> and we shall see the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> or <HI>Bramins,</HI> who never eat the Flesh of <HI>Animals;</HI> and yet they live frequently to an Hundred Years of Age.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italy,</HI> there is a Religious Order called the <HI>Camaldolese,</HI> or Monks of St. <HI>Romuald,</HI> who look healthy, and live long, and by their Profession they neither eat Flesh nor Fish.</P>
<P>The Monks of <HI>La Trappe</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> do the same. This Regimen of Life ren∣ders the Passions calm and quiet; while your Flesh-Devourers are soon irritated, im∣mediately take Fire, and even, in some Sense, participate of the Nature of the Brutes they feed on.</P>
<P>And then how many Delicacies may be made without the Death of Animals? how many Ways of dressing Herbs and Fruits, with Milk and Cream, Sugar and Honey, and <HI>Aromatick</HI> Spices? all the innocent Lux∣ury of <HI>Pastry</HI> and Confectionary, may here be introduced.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
<P>But because this Evil came in by De∣grees, so by Degrees it must be extirpa∣ted; and since it is impossible quite to for∣sake it at once, we having derived from our Parents, a Blood made up of these Spirits, I shall only advise my Readers to make Use of Flesh Diet as sparingly as pos∣sible, especially in Time of <HI>Pestilence;</HI> let them chuse that Sort, that they know they can best di∣gest, and dress it thoroughly, and that too after the plainest and most simple manner, avoid∣ing all rich Soupes, Ragous, Fricasies, <HI>A la Royalles, a la Daubes,</HI> or <HI>a la Diables,</HI> and all those <HI>Heterogeneous, Gallican,</HI> or rather <HI>Aegyptian Slipslops,</HI> which are poysonous, and create such malignant Juices in the Blood, which easily unite with the pestilential <HI>Ef∣fluvia,</HI> and become a proper Fewel for the <HI>Plague.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Broyling</HI> is undoubtedly the best Way of Dressing, over a clear Fire, the Meat being thoroughly first cleansed from all Blood, and moderately seasoned with Salt; for Salt sa∣vours all Things, and the Fire purifies all Things.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Roasting,</HI> for the same Rea∣sons.</P>
<P><HI>Boyling</HI> comes next, which must be done with a large Quantity of Water, that the Meat may have Room enough; and as soon
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>as the Pot boils, take off the Cover, that the Steam may go up.</P>
<P><HI>Frying</HI> and <HI>Stewing</HI> are the worst of all, un∣less the Stew-pan be uncovered; and <HI>Frying</HI> is not very wholsome, because of the Fat the Meat must necessarily swim in, which hinders the Fire from passing through the Meat. And <HI>Stewing,</HI> unless there be a great deal of Li∣quor, is only a genteel Name for <HI>Frying.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Sauces,</HI> or <HI>Seasoning,</HI> I recommend, especially with fresh Fish, (tho' indeed I do not approve of any Fish in the Time of Contagion: I say, for <HI>Sauces</HI> or <HI>Seasonings,</HI> I recommend) Tormentil, Dittany, Fennel, Dill, Gentian, Zedoary, Sanders, never forgetting Roses; and also Vinegar, and Vinegar of Roses; es∣pecially, Citron, <HI>Seville</HI> Orange, and Lemon Juices; as also Juice of Sorrel, Verjuice, Juice of Pomegranates and Barberries, for all Acids or Sours resist the pestilential Poyson, for they are refreshing, drying, comfort and pre∣serve; however, if they offend the Breast, qualify them with Sugar; if the Stomach, with a small Quantity of Pepper; for Pepper resists the Putrefaction of the Humours, strengthens Digestion; and, provided it be not ground too small, but powdered a little, that is, just broken, it helps the Liver.</P>
<P>Besides these Kinds of Seasonings, you should also use Onions, Garlick, Saffron, Ra∣dishes, Succory, Capers, pickled Cucum∣bers, Samphire, Mangoes, and all sorts of
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>four Pickles, especially where there is Gar∣lick in the Pickle.</P>
<P>As for Drink, chuse the best of its Kind, not too strong Wine, and Malt Liquor clear and well brewed, now and then a Cordial of <HI>Epidemick Water,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Plague-Water,</HI> and for Variety-sake, <HI>Treacle-Water;</HI> but all Things in Moderation.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of Antidotes, or Preservatives.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next Thing in Order to be consi∣dered, are <HI>Antidotes,</HI> or Preservatives against <HI>Pestilential Infections.</HI> In the first Place, I shall give a Description of two <HI>Amulets,</HI> which being hung about the Neck, have an extraordinary Virtue; after that, I shall give Receipts, how to make such Medicines, as in∣wardly taken, have had also very good Ef∣fects.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
<P><HI>Take of White Chrystalline Arsenick, two Oun∣ces; of Red, one Ounce.</HI></P>
<P>Make of these two a little Cake about an Inch broad, mixed up with the White of an Egg, or a Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, that is, with Gum Tragacanth dissolved in Rose-water, till it be of the Thickness of a Jelly.</P>
<P>Let this Cake be sewed up in a Piece of clean Linnen Cloth, enclosed with Silk, and hung about the Neck, towards the Heart.</P>
<P>You need not put your Shirt between; for though Arsenick taken inwardly be mortal, not on Account of any occult Quality, but its corrosive Nature; and so, properly speaking, is no Poyson; yet being outwardly applied, it resists every thing that is so.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Sapphires, Emeralds, Hyacinths, Ru∣bies, Red and White Coral, of each one Dram; of Saffron, a Scruple; of Pearls, half a Dram; White Arsenick, two Drams; Ambergrease, six Grains; dry'd Iris Roots, half an Ounce; burnt Hartshorn, a Dram; Orpiment, half an Ounce.</HI></P>
<P>Grind all together, and make a little Bag, to be sewed up in purple Silk, and hung about the Neck, as the former.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
<HEAD>An Antidote to be taken inwardly.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of dry'd Wallnuts, six Ounces; dry'd Figs, four Ounces; half an Ounce of dry'd Rue-Leaves; of Salt, two Drams.</HI></P>
<P>Let all these be bruised, and steeped in Rose∣water, with an equal Quantity of White∣wine Vinegar, or Juice of Sorrel, to which you may add, half an Ounce of Juniper Ber∣ries. Take the Quantity of a Chesnut of this Preparation, fasting. It is an excellent Pre∣servative.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of the best Cinnamon, half a Dram; Zedoary, one Dram; Bole Armoniack prepared, three Drams; Camphire, seven Grains; Seeds of Lemons huskt, that is, the Husks taken off; of Sorrel, and Lemon Juice, of each an Ounce and a half; Roots of Dittany, Tormentill, and Pimpernell, half a Dram; Ivory Shavings, and the Bone of a Deer's Heart, of each a Dram; of Elks Hoof, Hart's Horn, and Amber, of each half a Dram.</HI></P>
<P>Take of this, mixed up with half an Ounce of Sorrel Juice, or any other eager Juice, the Quantity of two Beans, fasting.</P>
<P>This <HI>Preservative Electuary</HI> was used with good Success by Don <HI>Priscian</HI> of <HI>Corduba,</HI> Phy∣sician
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> X. and recommended by the famous <HI>Rantzovius.</HI></P>
<P>And these Antidotes which follow have also been known to have great Success.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Rose-water, Vinegar of Roses, Sorrel∣water, and Mountain Wine, of each an equal Quantity; in which infuse of the Powder of Ze∣doary Root, Lemon-Peel, and Bole Armoniack, of each an equal Quantity; to which add a little Saffron, and, if you will, some old Conserve of Ro∣ses; put all into a Glass Bottle well stopt, and keep it for your Use; of which take every Mor∣ning, and oftentimes a Day, a little Quantity.</HI></P>
<P>This Antidote is admirable, for it hinders the Putrefaction of the Blood and Humours, and powerfully resists the pestilential Poyson.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of the Paste of Pill Ruffi, which having dissolved in seven times its quantity of Celadine-wa∣ter, or Honey Water, which is better; distill in the Bath, after having been steep'd three Days: This is of wonderful Efficacy, being drank in a moderate Quantity, like the former.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another Excellent Antidote.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of the best</HI> Venice <HI>Treacle, two Ounces; of the best Myrrh, three Drams; of the purest Camphire, two Drams.</HI></P>
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<P>Mix all in a Pint of Rose-water, of which after having steeped it three Days in Glass Vessels well sealed; drink a little every Mor∣ning.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Electuary of Nuts.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take of Fat Cartacs, half a Pound; of Rue, half an Ounce; of green Walnuts, a Quarter of a Pound; of Sea Salt, a Dram and a half.</HI></P>
<P>Let all these be incorporated in a Mortar with clarified Honey, or Syrup of Lemons; of which take every Morning fasting the Quantity of a Hazle Nut, with a small Quantity of Vi∣negar and Rose-water.</P>
<P>I shall now give you another Receipt of great Virtue, which is,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Electuary of Eggs.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take a new laid Egg, which, after having taken out the White, and Cock's Tread, fill with the best powdered Saffron, then close the whole, and burn it over a slow Fire till it turn black, then grind it in a Mortar; to which add its Weight of Seed of Eruca, or white Mustard; incorporate the whole very well.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Electuary take the Quantity of a Pea, every Morning, with a little Wine and Rose-water; you may add to this, if you will, (for it makes the Composition
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>much better) White Dittany, and Tor∣mentill, of each two Drams; Nux Vomica, one Dram, separately powdered before you add them to the rest. Add also of the Roots of Pimpernell, Zedoary, Angelica, and Cam∣phire, and as much Treacle as the Weight of the whole.</P>
<P>This Electuary is not only an excellent An∣tidote or Preservative, but is good when one is actually infected, in order to cure the Di∣stemper; to be given one Dram with White∣wine, if the Sickness begins with Cold; or with Rose-water, or Scabious Water, if with Heat; but it ought to be taken in Twelve Hours Time after the Beginning of the Di∣stemper</P>
<P>These are the best Antidotes or Preservatives against the <HI>Plague,</HI> which may be used with good Success; but by no means omit taking Pill Ruffi once or twice a Week, about the Weight of a Scruple in the Morning, without any other Medicine.</P>
<P>But if the Season be very hot, then let the Aloes and Myrrh, which are in the Composi∣tion of that Pill, be well washed in Rose-wa∣ter; and you may add of the best Camphire, a third Part of the Quantity of Myrrh; but in cold Weather, and in cold Complexions, the Pill must be taken without these Prepa∣tions of Washing and Camphire.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
<P>Besides, as these Pills are somewhat too opening, it would be good in such Cases, to add to them a small quantity of Bole Ar∣moniack, or to roll them up in its Powder; and as sometimes they hurt the Stomach, this Evil is to be corrected with a little Mixture of the best Mastick, and a little <HI>Venice</HI>-Treacle, or Mithridate, that is, two or three Scru∣ples. This is to be taken every ten Days, with a Draught of Rose-water, or Sorrel∣water.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Medicines to be made use of when any one is so unhappy as to be visi∣ted with the Distemper.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN any one finds himself infec∣ted, if Age or Strength permit, let him be let Blood as soon as possible; then let the following Medicine be immediately ap∣plied, and the sooner the better, because this Distemper admits no Delays. After that let the following Draught be immediately admini∣stred, and repeated according to the Strength of the Patient.</P>
<P><HI>Take of white Onions, six in Number, which open at the Top, and take out the Heart, or Inside, fill them with Venice Treacle, mix∣ed with a little Powder of Dittany Root and Tormentill; put them into wet Paper, and roast
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>them in the Embers till they are soft, then p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Part of them to the Part affected; for this being applied like a Pultise to the Boyl, is a sovereign Medicine for drawing out the Poyson.</HI></P>
<P>Take the remaining Part of these Onions so prepared, and let them be bruised, and mixed with Syrup of Lemons about an Ounce, and a little Vinegar, which squeeze through a straining Cloth, and give of this Liquor luke∣warm, three Ounces, and let the Patient be laid in a warm Bed, abstaining from Meat and Drink six Hours, and by all Means take Care of sleeping, which is ever dangerous in this Distemper.</P>
<P>This Medicine is very efficacious, expelling by Sweat the poysonous Infection. But if you add to this a small Quantity of the above∣mentioned Electuary of Eggs, it will be ad∣mirable.</P>
<P>But if the Patient be full of ill Humours, and not let Blood, or that it is not convenient to diminish the Blood, add a little opening Me∣dicine to this Potion; that is, for the weaker Sort, half an Ounce of <HI>Trifera Persica,</HI> with one Dram of the Electuary of <HI>Hamech;</HI> for those of stronger Constitutions, instead of <HI>Tri∣fera,</HI> add to the Confection of <HI>Hamech,</HI> an equal quantity of the of Conserve Roses, and the like of Electuary of <HI>India,</HI> and two Drams of <HI>Diafe∣ricon;</HI> but in both Cases, give the Potion hot or warm, with Scabious Water, Rose-water, or Vinegar.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
<P>There are a great many other Medicines, which I purposely omit, these being the soonest prepared, the cheapest, and most efficacious. But the last and most excellent Remedy for this Evil, is <HI>Adam</HI>'s Earth, that is, the first matter of our Creation; for this is the One and Only <HI>Medicine,</HI> and greater than which cannot be; nor will it be a little, when purged by the Artifice of Fire, and reduced to its Simpli∣city by a congruous Lotion. But of this enough.</P>
<P><HI>He that has Ʋnderstanding to understand, let him understand.</HI></P>
