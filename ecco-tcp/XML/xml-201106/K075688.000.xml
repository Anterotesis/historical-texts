<P>TO prevent the unfavourable impres∣sions which <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> of the pro∣fession, might otherwise be induced to en∣tertain of him, in consequence of this mode of publication; the author thinks it proper to declare, with his hand on his heart—That the DIVINE ART of HEAL∣ING hath not, <HI>cannot</HI> have, a more disin∣terestedly zealous advocate than he is, nor one that more truely honours every wor∣thy professor of it, who knows his <HI>Art,</HI> but not his <HI>Trade.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER—That the most valuable part of his life has been employed, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in painful, laborious (he might add, very expensive) researches, and ex∣periments, with a sole view to the im∣provement of that art: whereby many individuals have been enriched; some in∣deed very unworthily — who are at this time accumulating thousands annually, by converting to private emolument his dis∣coveries,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>originally intended for public good.</P>
<P>To conclude — The most benevolent, the most public spirited member of the faculty of physic, cannot more patheti∣cally bewail than he does, the present alarming growth of <HI>licentious quackery;</HI> that consequential minister in the train of modern <HI>riot</HI> and <HI>intemperance</HI>—which he cannot help looking upon, with heart∣felt concern, as the <HI>ominous antitype</HI> of <HI>that luxury,</HI> which first betrayed the people of ancient Rome to the murderous havoc of empiricism, and finally effected the ruin and destruction of that once glorious republic.</P>

<HEAD>SYNOPSIS OF THE CAUSES OF <HI>CHRONIC DISEASES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL arts, whether <HI>plastic, mathematical, mechanical,</HI> or <HI>physical,</HI> are but the hand∣maids and imitators of Nature. Most success∣ful is the practitioner who can happily trace her path, and can copy nearest to the divine origi∣nal: Who, knowing her ways, is able to lend a hand when she is obstructed; or can render her propitious by gentle and well timed invita∣tions. In the healing art particularly, it was observed two thousand years ago by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the great father of medical science<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, that, NA∣TURE <HI>is the sovereign curer of diseases,</HI> and that <HI>physicians are, or ought to be, her humble imita∣tors</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>and servants</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. By unceasing attendance on the sick, invincible patience, and the most vigilant observation of every action and motion of NATURE, that illustrious <HI>Archiater</HI> acquired a wonderful knowledge of the genuine nature of diseases,—of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and of the gra∣dual,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>uniform, consentient operations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. L. de Aliment.</NOTE> of that exquisite mechanism, and innate, energetic principle of self preservation, with which the CREATOR of <HI>man</HI> hath been pleased to en∣dow our bodies: And, by carefully comparing the same sort of distempers, and their various minute motions, in different patients, and all the circumstances [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] and accidents [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] which usually preceded and at∣tended them, he could readily foretel an ap∣proaching disease, and after its invasion, give a right judgment of the progress and event of it.</P>
<P>This surprizing <HI>skill</HI> of his, in foretelling the approach, successive changes, and event, of dis∣cases, and <HI>that</HI> of other succeeding physicians who carefully studied and pursued his method, procured them a kind of religious veneration among the people, who were wont to look upon them as prophets inspired by the Gods, and even as arbiters of life and death.</P>
<P>But as this <HI>old method</HI> of acquiring the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is extremely tedious, crabbed, and severe, it has been little regarded for many ages, except by certain particular re∣tainers to the <HI>Coan</HI> school; such, for instance, as <HI>Sydenham</HI> and his truly ingenious and singu∣larly modest translator <HI>Mapletoft</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From an authenticated copy of the original manuscript (which the writer had, some years ago, and he believes has still, in his possession) of Doctor Sydenham's dedication of his works to Doctor Mapletoft, it appears, that this mo∣dest translator hath, in his Latin version, suppressed many high encomiums paid to himself. A further instance of Doctor Mapletoft's singular delicacy, as related, with o∣ther anecdotes of him, to the author by his grandson, a gentleman of distinguished probity and learning, now liv∣ing, is, that after having exercised the profession of phy∣sic, with reputation and success, to the age of forty-eight, he then left off practice, purely on account of the insupe∣rable solicitude of mind his fellow-feeling for the sick under his care constantly produced.</NOTE>, <HI>Bagtivi, Boerbaave, Mead, Huxham,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<P>In later times, a much easier and more com∣pendious way to fame and opulence has been happily discovered: And we can now, with singular propriety, apply to the ancient practice of <HI>observation,</HI> what that lucky son of fortune <HI>Gnatho</HI> (in <HI>Terence</HI>) told an honest, simple, half-starved brother of his, on a similar occasion —
<Q><L>— "Olim isti fuit</L>
<L>Generi quondam quaestus, apud seclum prius —</L>
<L>— <HI>HOC NOVUM EST AUCUPIUM."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Prince of Physicians</HI> first observed in what manner the symptoms in acute diseases [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,] <HI>when not interrupted by art, or by any external cause</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] succeeded one ano∣ther, and by what <HI>evacuations,</HI> NATURE, <HI>when left to herself,</HI> got rid of those diseases<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>: And on this solid basis of <HI>observation,</HI> he originally erected that noblest production of human ge∣nius and sagacity, <HI>(monumentum aere perennius)
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>the art of presaging;</HI> and formed <HI>from thence</HI> a method of curing <HI>natural diseases,</HI> by means of such <HI>artificial ones</HI> as NATURE, when too lan∣guid and remiss herself, never failed to point out or reveal to this her faithful minister. He had frequently observed, in the practice of his divine mistress, that a spontaneous haemorrhage of blood from the nose always mitigated, and oftentimes carried off, certain kinds of fevers, and other violent disorders. This suggested to him the practice of <HI>artificial</HI> haemorrhages by <HI>bleeding, scarification,</HI> &amp;c. which he likewise used, on certain occasions, <HI>prophylactically,</HI> or by way of prevention: For <HI>experience</HI> had taught this consummate artist, that those means which were wont to assuage bad symptoms after they appeared, would prevent their coming on, if used in proper time. He had likewise observ∣ed, that NATURE frequently cured certain dis∣eases by spontaneous abscesses in different parts of the body. When he found NATURE pre∣vented from working her own way, by such sa∣lutary operations, he substituted in their room <HI>artificial</HI> abscesses, such as <HI>issues, setons,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It became farther obvious to him, that some violent disorders were carried off by a sponta∣neous diarrhoea, or vomiting; others by plen∣tiful warm sweats, or a gentle moisture of the skin; others again by a critical discharge of urine, and some by expectoration, &amp;c. Hence
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>his practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of his method of practice in general, compared with our modern improvements, one of the most accomplished physicians [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Phoebo ante alios dilectus</HI>] now living, scruples not to say — "Ob cultum Hippocraticae curationis neglectum, magis quam ullam aliam causam, accidisse vi∣detur, quod licet humani corporis compages et facultates longe melius intellectae fuerint, et morborum abditae causae altius investigatae, et medicamentorum copia plurimum aucta, et eorum vires novis experimentis exploratae; nihi∣lominus tamen, rei medicae, in tollendis morbis acutis uti∣litas a temporibus usque Hippocratis haud increvit, si modo non sucrit imminuta."</NOTE>, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of exciting <HI>artificial</HI> diarrhoeas by <HI>purging medicines;—vomits; sudo∣rifics; diaphoretics; diuretics; expectorants,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That a medicine, which, consonant to this rational and truely physical doctrine of <HI>Hippo∣crates,</HI> the prime minister of NATURE, would constantly operate with equal safety, ease, and efficacy, in all, even the most opposite consti∣tutions, and uniformly answer every intention of an <HI>universal evacuant,</HI> by attenuating, dis∣solving, and carrying off, the viscid concretions, and foulnesses, of the stomach and intestines; thereby cleansing and deterging those concoc∣tive organs, and restoring them to their pristine natural action; <HI>or,</HI> by a milder gradual opera∣tion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, in proper doses, removing obstructions in the remoter vessels, and carrying off any morbid or excrementitious humours, by insen∣sible perspiration<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, sweat, and urine. — That
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>such a medicine is one important <HI>desideratum</HI> in physic, the learned and judicious professors of the faculty, who have sacrificed at the shrine of NATURE, will readily acknowledge—That the subject of this discourse is such a medicine, the author dares, with undesigning confidence, as∣sert; after a thousand successful trials made of it, by himself, and his medical acquaintances in different countries: Under the sanction of which impartial experience, he can now safely recommend it to the public, as an <HI>universal purgative,</HI>—not as an <HI>universal medicine,</HI>—nor even as a <HI>specific one,</HI> that, 'by its peculiar ope∣ration on the animal fluids, can transform any morbific matter, or preternatural ferment, into good blood and humours.'—He knows none such: Nor can he, on this occasion, forbear expressing a real and honest concern, that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> — by <HI>specific remedies,</HI> is not yet <HI>wholly</HI> confined to the mountebank professions of <HI>empirics;</HI> to whom promises cost nothing but the health and lives of those who trust them. That the opinion of the <HI>specific operations,</HI> or, which is the same thing, the occult qualities, of medicines, in the cure of diseases, continues to be a prevailing principle in physic, the pub∣lications of the current century, and shop re∣cords, mutually evince: Though 'tis evident, that, agreeably to this doctrine, and method of procedure, it will be impossible ever to fix any
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>bounds to the <HI>materia medica,</HI> (and consequent∣ly to the still growing, tho' already insupp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt∣able expence of physic) or to reduce the <HI>praxis medica</HI> to any rational general principles; whilst the whole vegetable, animal, and mineral king∣doms are ransacked and tortured, in order to find out those occult qualities and specific ope∣rations. — Hence, such is the felicity of the pre∣sent times, and so wonderfully is the world now enriched with specifics, simple and compound, (under the conjuring titles of alexipharmics, cardiacs, cephalics, neurotics, stomachics, &amp;c. antifebrifics, antihysterics, antepileptics, antic∣terics, antiscorbutics, &amp;c.) that there is not a family in the kingdom which can spare a few shillings, but may purchase a <HI>dispensatory,</HI> con∣taining several hundreds of those choice appro∣priated remedies, for the cure of all diseases. — Nor is it of less utility to the junior part of the faculty, or sucking practitioners, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,] as the learned Doctor <HI>Gideon Harvey</HI> quaintly titles them: Since, by this means, they are accom∣modated with an elegant set of extemperaneous prescriptions, and a competent number of those most approved specifics, recommended by the authority and experience of the greatest names, are always kept ready prepared in the shops, such as may answer all cases <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to avoid the needless trouble of making a right judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> upon any case in particular.
<PB N="12" REF="11"/></P>
<P>With regard to this <HI>specific practice,</HI> (the con∣stant political subterfuge of <HI>physic-craft</HI>) it is well known to every judicious experienced phy∣sician, that the artful pretence of curing dis∣eases by the occult qualities of specific remedies, is now, as it always has been, the principal source of all the knavery, impudence, and ig∣norance, that we meet with in the profession.</P>
<P>Any <HI>semicrude</HI> practitioner in this way, who is possessed of a tolerable share of cunning and address, can never want a specious pretext for making a property of his patient, almost as long as he pleases, by flattering his hopes from time to time; tho' the patient finds himself never the better, but perhaps still grows worse: If one specific succeed not, another is tried, and, if that fails, a third, and so on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>; as long as the poor infatuated believing sufferer has any money, strength, or patience left.</P>
<P>Suffice it here to quote one instance, out of a multitude that might be produced, of this <HI>medicina politica;</HI> and be that the <HI>specific</HI> treat∣ment of those <HI>chronical</HI> disorders commonly di∣stinguished by the technical epithets of <HI>arthri∣tic, rheumatic, scorbutic, hysteric,</HI> and <HI>hypocon∣driac.</HI> Several hundred volumes (without count∣ing those petit essays<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> that are daily spewing out of the press) have been professedly written<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> on the causes, &amp;c. of these maladies: Though
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>their whole aetiology may be comprised in a few words.—Ease, indolence, intemperance, indulged pleasure, irregular gratifications of the natural appetites, and the want of pure, fresh air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The greatest master in physic looks upon <HI>air</HI> as the fountain of life and health to man; and moreover ascribes to <HI>it,</HI> in a great measure, the different size, shape, com∣plexion, manners, disposition, government, and genius, of different nations. For instance, in the fertile regions of Asia, which approach nearest of any, in his opinion, to the original nature and temperature of the seasons. [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] moderate heat and moisture render the men plump [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>], extremely handsome, and of the largest size. —From the extraordinary mildness of their air and climate, the manners of the <HI>eastern Asiatics</HI> are more easy, gentle, and unactive [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>], than those of the <HI>northern Asiatics</HI> and <HI>Euro∣peans.</HI>
<P>From the same cause, their dispositions are soft, coward∣ly, and effeminate, impatient of labour and hardship. Whatever, says he, is manly, laborious, painful, or bold and daring, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] can find no place in such a con∣stitution; but <HI>pleasure</HI> is the governing principle: And hence proceeds the great variety of forms amongst their wild beasts—Neither is the mind, in such a constitution, subject to surprises [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>], nor the body to violent changes; circumstances that are apt to give a sharper edge to the passions, and a higher degree of understanding, and sprightly vigour, than where things remain continually in the same state: For the mind of man is always roused, and not suffered to rest, by fre∣quent and sudden changes. Upon these accounts, the <HI>eastera Astatics</HI> are weak, timorous, and servile, easily slid∣ing into monarchies: With reluctance they leave their ease and families, and hazard their lives for despotic masters. On the other hand, in <HI>Greece,</HI> and the <HI>northern</HI> parts of Asia, where the temperature of the seasons is less mild, and less uniform, the men are bold, hardy, and warlike: Without compulsion they quit their ease, and voluntarily expose themselves to toil and danger, animated with the hopes, and rewarded with the fruits, of conquest.</P>
<P>In countries abounding with certain mines, travellers find the frame and temper of their minds suddenly altered; their intellectual faculties more sprightly and vigorous, con∣ceptions clearer, imagination more brisk and lively; and on passing to another soil, an universal relaxation, idea, gloomy, confused, and indistinct, immediately succeed. Thus, consonant to the philosophic notions of the DIVINE OLD MAN, the discovery, and improvement, of arts and sciences may, in some measure, depend upon the air and climate; some succeeding best, where a sprightliness of fancy, others, where intense application of mind, is re∣quired.</P>
<P>In a <HI>medicinal</HI> intention, the <HI>vivifying spirit</HI> of pure, fresh air is admirable: In acute diseases of the <HI>putrid</HI> and <HI>epidemic</HI> kind, millions of lives have been lost for want of it.</P>
<P>In a <HI>pharmaceutic</HI> intention, air, or the humid part of it, acts as a true dissolvent, in the same manner as water in its grosser form. The cathartic and astringent virtues of certain vegetables neither volatile nor exhalable by heat, but of the fixed kind and dissoluble by <HI>menstrua</HI> alone, have been observed to be diffused through the air. Hence it appears, that the atmosphere may be impregnated with all the medicinal powers of vegetables which <HI>aqueous menstrua</HI> are capable of extracting. And upon this account it is, that, in standing, walking, or sleeping, under several kind of trees, people have found themselves variously af∣fected.</P>
<P>The peculiar medicinal powers of certain vegetables <HI>ex∣halable by heat,</HI> are, by the bye, equally remarkable and curious. In obstinate watchings, and deliriums, the au∣thor has, by the steams of one of this kind, procured ease, rest, and sleep, after all the usual internal sedative medi∣cines had been tried in vain.</P>
<P>In acute diseases of the malignant kind, where sweating was indicated, but could not be procured by any internal means, the effluvia of a vegetable, applied in a certain manner to the external surface of the body, have proved an efficacious sudorific.</P>
<P>From a variety of similar experiments, and certain ob∣servations on the oeconomy of Nature, respecting cuticular inhalations, a physiological conjecture is drawn, namely, that the human body is endued with some secret energetic power of attracting such salutary particles as it may be in immediate need of, from surrounding bodies which contain them.—Hence, old persons, and those whom long and te∣dious indispositions had brought to the last stage of life, have, by the effluvia of young, sound, and healthy ani∣mals, been surprizingly recruited, strengthened, and invi∣gorated.</P>
<P>In Persia, Arabia, and other eastern countries, at cer∣tain seasons of the year, the people are obliged, by the ex∣cessive heat of the weather, to lie down at night to sleep, on the tops of their houses, in balconies, turrets, &amp;c. ex∣posed to the open air, and dews, which are so copious, notwithstanding the excessive heat, during the time of sleep, that the body is cooled, preserved from thirst, and refresh∣ed by its absorbent power of attracting or inhaling the dews; provided there be any perceivable saltness in the taste of those dews: On the contrary, if the dews have not a saline taste, it is then found dangerous to sleep in the open air, and frequently attended with pernicious, and sometimes fatal consequences.</P></NOTE>, and habitual exercise, are the
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>genuine original causes of these disorders amongst us; and, in short, of all our national constitu∣tional
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>complaints—of our growing weaknesses, increasing scurvies, multiplying rheumatisms,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>universal wandering gouts, and the most obsti∣nate chronic and hereditary diseases fixing and radicating themselves still more and more in our natural habits and constitutions.—Hence it is, that the natural evacuations become ob∣structed and diminished; the secreted humours are thickened, and rendered viscous, adhesive, and clammy; the solids, especially the nervous system, weakened and relaxed; the fluids ne∣cessarily contract ill qualities; and an acrid, sa∣line, corrosive serum is produced: This serum, wherever it is thrown, or happens to be depo∣sited, lacerates or erodes and ulcerates the so∣lids, and occasions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">per <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> all the symptoms of a true and genuine <HI>land scurvy.</HI> And this name of scurvy it commonly receives, and is distinguish∣ed by, as often as it proves effluent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, in pim∣ples, blotches, scaly leprous scurf, scabs, tet∣ters, and other such eruptions on the skin: But
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>when it happens to prove influent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, and is thrown upon the stomach, bowels, lungs, liver, spleen, mesentery, kidneys, bladder, womb, or any internal part, it sometimes passes under the more polite appellation of nervous or spas∣modic complaints; but chiefly under the tech∣nical names of febricula, cholic, cachexy, dy∣sentery, dropsy, asthma, atrophy, jaundice, diabetes, dysury, gonorrhaea, fluor albus, or white flux: A complaint, <HI>this last,</HI> the most disagreeable of all others to the natural delicacy of the sex, and, on account of its increasing prevalency, the most alarming in a national light; as being the greatest, however generally unheeded, enemy to conception, and, in its consequences, more fatal to population than the sword itself.—From the same serose or scor∣butic cacochymy, in like manner originate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, in different constitutions, the cancer; St. An∣thony's fire; gout; sciatica; rheumatism; palsy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, the orthodox medical processes, and formulae, of our specific practitioners, in those, commonly denominated, arthritic, scorbutic, hysteric, and hypocondriac disorders, consist chiefly of hot vegetable aromatics, bitters, and astringents, infused in strong wines or spirits; the volatile oils and spirits of vegetables and
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>animals; spirituous solutions of the foetid and oily gums, and vegetable resins; tinctures and infusions of castor, contrayerva, cochineal, saf∣fron, snake-root, valerian, and the like; cha∣lybeates, opiates, and various sorts of pharma∣ceutic drams heated and raised still higher with the volatile oils, spirits, and salts.—But, if this original morbid constitution, as already ob∣served, should consist in the tenacity and visci∣dity of the blood and animal fluids, occasion∣ing a diminution of the secretions, and a con∣sequent distention and relaxation of the nervous system; 'tis evident, that the foregoing heating, rarifying method, by aggravating all the symp∣toms, must strengthen the morbid habit, and confirm the disease still more and more.—And thus it is, in fact, that patients under these complaints are, by our specificians, kept on from year to year, living and dying by turns; being strictly interdicted the use of all strong malt liquors, wine, and common drams; at the same time that they are continually loaded with prescriptions of liquid Fire out of the shops.</P>
<P>But, passing unnoticed, for brevity sake, the intermediate acts of this politico-medical drama, proceed we directly to the catastrophe.</P>
<P>When the constitutions of the patients are, in this manner, nearly exhausted, and life worn out to its bare threads<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>; our specific practi∣tioners
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>immediately put them under the regula∣tions of diet, riding, change of air, bathing, and water-drinking, at Bath, Bristol, Buxton, or some other distant mineral spring; where they may die decently, with a favourable salvo to the doctor's reputation, as having then used the <HI>last</HI> remedies—which, in all medical pro∣priety, ought to have been the <HI>first.</HI></P>
<P>Now, it is in chief as a friendly co-operating auxiliary to <HI>these</HI> truely appropriate remedies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, (the <HI>dernier ressort</HI> of our specificians) that the author of the <HI>Universal Purgative,</HI> cordially, conscientiously, recommends the <HI>occasional</HI> use of it, to every native of Britain labouring under any of the above national chronical maladies. Not but that this medicine will always be found, when properly administered, a more salutary assistant to the same remedies, in the <HI>prevention,</HI> than in the <HI>cure,</HI> of those maladies: Forasmuch as NATURE is ever in some degree weakened, by the invasion of an enemy; even though she alone, or judiciously assisted, may have expel∣led him out of her dominions.</P>
<P>The immediate or first efficient cause (the praeincipient causes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> have been already given) of all our <HI>arthritic, rheumatic, scorbutic, hyste∣ric,</HI> and <HI>hypocondriac</HI> complaints; and, in short, of the whole gloomy catalogue of <HI>nervous disor∣ders,</HI> seems to be an <HI>acrid serous humour,</HI> pro∣duced
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>as above described, and lodged either in the glands, minute vessels, or vascular coats, or interstices of the vessels, of the stomach; occasioning, by its irritation, a preternatural laxity and debility of the fibres of the alimen∣tary canal; a vitiated secretion in the glands of the stomach, and a consequent depraved state of the gastric juices; a laesion (with the natu∣rally consequent spasmodic affections) of the nerves of that concoctive organ; an imperfect digestion; a generation of wind and phlegm; an irregular and less vigorous and uniform mo∣tion of the blood in the vena portae, and, of consequence, an inert, viscid, peccant bile, which, in its natural healthy state, is the most highly animalized of all the juices, and the most conducive towards promoting all the secretions and excretions of the human body, particularly those of the alimentary tube—The principal seat of all nervous, hysteric, and hypocondriac af∣fections.</P>
<P>That this rationale is just, the really learned and indefatigable inquirers into the human pa∣thology will allow; and consequently, that the true curative intention will consist wholly, <HI>at first,</HI> in <HI>correcting, attenuating, resolving,</HI> and <HI>expelling,</HI> this acrid humour, by some of the <HI>natural evacuations</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<P>In this first capital intention, the medicine here recommended, properly dosed, and pro∣perly administered (for on this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> depends the success of every appropriate remedy) has been found, in a long and extensive experience, to produce very salutary effects, even in persons of the most opposite natural habits and consti∣tutions.</P>
<P>Nor will these ascribed effects appear exag∣gerated to the judicious and experienced practi∣tioner, when he is informed, that this medicine is composed of near a dozen of the most powerful known deobstruents, besides two mineral pre∣parations of the author's own discovery, which two alone, united <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, have been found to perform, in fact, what that indefatigable phy∣sician the late Doctor <HI>Huxham</HI> peculiarly ascribes to his favourite <HI>Tincture,</HI> in the following words—"It passeth through and scours even the very smallest tubuli of the whole human frame, and is besides sufficiently powerful to give a strong irritation to the great alimentary canal, and therefore more surely to affect the small canali∣culi of the body; and yet, from the exceeding tenuity of its minute particles, it by no means lacerates the vessels."</P>
<P>In a similar manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Per <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, this medicine operates, in properly adapted doses; removing obstruc∣tions
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>in the remoter vessels, and promoting <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the secretions in general, particularly those of urine and perspiration.</P>
<P>For the universal <HI>promptitude, ease,</HI> and <HI>effi∣cacy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, of its operation, as a <HI>purgative,</HI> even in the most <HI>delicate</HI> and <HI>irritable</HI> habits, the author has the concurrent testimony of many judicious practitioners, some of them physicians of emi∣nence; not only in England, but in Holland, Germany, and Switzerland: And, <HI>in this in∣tention,</HI> the like uniform operation has been found to attend its use, in different, and even in opposite climates; without any of those in∣jurious colliquative effects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> so generally ascrib∣ed by physicians to the preparations of aloes, and particularly to that long popular one ori∣ginally known by the name of <HI>Francfurt Pills,</HI> first invented and described by <HI>Hartman Beyer;</HI> of which feveral spurious sorts have been since vended, in different countries, under various names—<HI>Pilulae Angelicae, Aloes Rosata, Pilulae Tartareae, Grana Angelica, &amp;c.</HI>—At Rome, (notwithstanding the observation of that distin∣guished Roman physician <HI>Giorgio Baglivi,</HI> in his <HI>Praxis Medica;</HI> where, treating of the cure of diseases in that city, he says—"No sort of re∣medies afford so much benefit to the inhabitants of Rome, as exercise, and a prudent repetition
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>of gentle purgatives—but purgatives, given in the form of pills, have no successful or plenti∣ful operation,") it has been found, by the ex∣perience of several travellers, the author's friends, to operate with all desirable efficacy: And, on the like authentic evidence, in a much greater variety of instances, he can safely war∣rant, <HI>in the same intention,</HI> effects equally salu∣tary, from its use, in both Indies:</P>
<P>In occasional, or habitual costiveness, it will be found an effectual remedy, free from the in∣conveniences ascribed to <HI>aloetic, rhabarbarine,</HI> and <HI>saline</HI> preparations, in that intention; as it neither produces sickness nor gripes, and leaves no astriction in the bowels.</P>
<P>But, in no one intention will this medicine prove more <HI>universally</HI> salutary and beneficial, than in that of a frequent <HI>family purge,</HI> on the so justly celebrated <HI>prophylactic</HI> plan of that hap∣py explorer of Nature <HI>Lord Verulam—to cleanse the stomach and bowels from those viscid, or slimy, and vitiated bilious, humours which are so frequent∣ly collected in them, constituting the source and fomes of various diseases, as well chronic as acute, to which people of every rank are liable; but the delicate, the polite, the studious, and the sedentary, more particularly so:</HI> It being past all doubt with the author, that thousands even of valuable lives are yearly cut off, by prematurity of death, which an exact practical observance of <HI>this plan</HI>

<P>Notwithstanding the here recited, and other valuable properties of this medicine; the author has not the ridiculous presumption to offer it to the public as a <HI>Specific Remedy</HI> in any particular disease.—In the above mentioned chronical dis∣orders, he is warranted, by the indisputable sanction of experience, to recommend it as an efficacious assistant to those peculiarly appro∣priated remedies—<HI>An early well masticated crust or biscuit; a regulated diet; riding; friction</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This remedy was in the highest esteem with the an∣cients, for the preservation of health, and the cure of CHRONICAL DISEASES: Scarce any man of condition amongst them passed a day, either in sickness or in health, without this <HI>cutaneous exercise. Hippocrates</HI> makes a right knowledge of its use and efficacy one essential requisite in a physician.—"A physician (says he—<HI>de articulis</HI>) ought to be skilled in many things—and particularly in the nature of <HI>friction,"</HI> the effects of which he thus explains—"Strong friction braces, soft or gentle friction loosens, [h. e. resolves those parts that are constringed or obstructed] much friction diminishes, and moderate friction increases the flesh."—"The part you would nourish must be moved: For motion excites heat, and attracts nourishment to the part."—<HI>Are∣taeus</HI> too, the most skilful and judicious of his followers, (our own immortal <HI>Sydenham, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppocrati secundus pene par,</HI> excepted) insists largely on the use and efficacy of this re∣medy, in his admirable history of <HI>Chron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c Diseases.</HI>
<P>The almost total disuse, in modern practice, of a remedy so strongly recommended by the universal experience of ancient <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as by its perfect agreement with our later discoveries in the oeconomy of Nature, re∣specting the cutaneous discharges, can only be ascribed to the unreasonable impatience of people, in every rank of life, who can hardly be persuaded to think well of any method which does not surprize with some sudden altera∣tion, or of any remedy that does not promise to cure like a charm. Strange infatuation—to expect immediate relief in <HI>Chronic Diseases</HI> which, perhaps, have been many years contracting, and, by an inveterate habit, are incorporated into the very vitals of the constitution. This precipitate impatience for a cure, by prompting people to trust to the delusive promises of tawdry, boasting medicasters [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>], has ultimately occasioned the destruc∣tion of more lives than war or pestilence.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="25" REF="24"/><HI>change of air; seasonable bathing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the ancient Romans (says an admired philo∣sophical writer) there were four things much in use, where∣of some are so far out of practice in ours, and other late ages, as to be hardly known but by their names; these were <HI>bathing, fumigation, friction,</HI> and <HI>jactation:</HI> The first, tho' not wholly disused by us, yet is turned out of the service of health to that of pleasure, but may be of excel∣lent effect in both: It not only opens the pores, provokes sweat, and thereby allays heat, supples the joints and si∣news, unwearies and resreshes more than any thing after too great labour and exercise; but is of great effect in some acute pains, as of the stone and cholic, and disposes to sleep, when many other remedies fail. Nor is it improbable that all the good effects of any <HI>natural</HI> baths may be imitat∣ed by the <HI>artificial,</HI> if compounded with care, and the skill of able naturalists or physicians." Thus, for instance, our <HI>Harrowgate waters</HI> (which have been found so efficacious in cutaneous foulnesses, blotches, scabs, scrophulas, lepro∣sies, &amp;c.) are strongly impregnated with sulphur and a kind of lixivial salt, as hath been proved by mixing a certain quantity of sulphur with salt of tartar, melting them over a gentle fire till perfectly incorporated, and then dissolving the mass in pure water.—If then we know the component parts of these waters, why should we not expect the same good effects from the <HI>artificial</HI> as from the <HI>natural</HI> baths made of them, agreeably to this ingenious writer's observa∣tion?
<P>Medicated baths must have been of very high antiquity; since we find, by the best authenticated accounts, that the ancient Jews and Egyptians made use of them in curing the most obstinate and desperate maladies.—Virgil, singing the praises of his favourite <HI>Iapis—'Phoebo ante alios dilectus,'</HI> (who was cotemporary with the sons of <HI>Esculapius</HI>) intro∣duces him using a <HI>medicated bath</HI> in the cure of father <HI>Aene∣as;</HI> and says of him, that being greatly beloved by Apollo, he offered to teach him <HI>augury, to play on the harp,</HI> and <HI>to draw the bow</HI> well; but that he rather chose <HI>to prolong: he dying father's life, to learn the virtues of plants,</HI> and <HI>to cure diseases</HI>—</P>

Others again contend, that the word <HI>mu∣tas</HI> relates to <HI>inglorius;</HI> and that Virgil thereby intimated, that physic was an art of no great renown in the world, and brought its professors no great glory or reputation. But unfortunately none of these opinions will pass muster: For, 1st. The sect of empirics had no existence till many ages after the time of Iapis. 2dly. In the time of Iapis, physic could not be a contemptible or inglorious art, nor of small renown or reputation, since it pro∣cured to its professors whilst living the highest veneration, and af∣ter death divine honours. Nay, Homer tells us, that a physician, even in those times, was counted of more value than a world of other men—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Iliad.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
<P>This Herculean difficulty might, perhaps, be better solved, by supposing the word <HI>mutas</HI> to be opposed to <HI>citheram,</HI> which <HI>Apollo</HI> offered him, whereby the poet might not only mean music, but poetry too, for which it is often put; and that by the word <HI>in∣glorius</HI> the poet signifies no more than unaspiring or unambitious; as one who for the knowledge of physic renounced those other gifts or talents, to which the poet, as such, was obliged to give the preference—For this reason Virgil might call physic <HI>ars muta,</HI> in opposition to poetry and music, which were properly <HI>vocales.</HI></P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>That the wonderful power of absorbency in all the ex∣ternal (as well as internal) parts of the human body was well known to Hippocrates, appears from the following passage in the sixth book of his <HI>Epidemics</HI>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—Galen, quoting this very passage, and in direct allusion to the doctrine of cuticular absorption, says—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—"But they [the pores or absorbent orisices of the bibulous veins] at∣tract no small part from the circumambient air."—Upon this principle, Hippocrates recommended bathing where the body wanted moistening, and to be cooled: In hot weather he prescribed warm baths, and in cold weather cold ones.—The intense thirst accompanying certain acute diseases, in hot climates, is assuaged immediately by immersion of the body in warm water.—After continuing twenty minutes in a bath of warm water, the author of this has, during a course of <HI>statical</HI> experiments, frequently found himself from forty to fifty ounces heavier than he was before immersion. By the same means he has found an ex∣treme thirst removed almost immediately. Bathing in sea∣water has been found, by experiment, to produce the same refreshing effect.—And hence, perhaps, the deplorable ca∣lamities, to which the seafaring part of mankind are fre∣quently exposed (burning like a ship on fire, in a deluge of surrounding waters) by the extreme want of fresh water, might be mitigated at least, by repeated immersion in the sea-water. All chronic diseases, proceeding from a redun∣dancy of saline or acrimonious particles floating in the vital juices, or accumulated upon the glands appointed to sepa∣rate them from those juices, are relieved by sea-bathing; as the solvent parts of the sea-water are thereby imbibed through the pores of the skin, and carried into immediate action upon those saline or acrimonious particles; and there is not, perhaps, any menstruum, natural or artificial, hi∣therto known, that is so perfect and immediate a solvent for saline bodies as the aqueous vehicle of the sea-salt in its pure and divested simplicity.</P></NOTE>; <HI>medicinal

Even so low down as the eve of the commonwealth of Rome, properly so called, (before the butchery of despotism had made the life of a Roman scarce worth preserving, by destroying, or driving into corners, all that was great and valuable) the Roman physicians used frequently, and with very good effect, to send their patients, labouring under certain chronic diseases, to <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> partly for the sake of the exercise by the motion of the ship, but chiefly upon account of the <HI>vomiting</HI> it occasioned; that they might thereby supply their want of <HI>gentle emetics:</HI> For it was a distinguishing part of the exquifite diligence and sagacity of the ancients, to make good what they wanted in the <HI>pharmaceutic art,</HI> by other means.—And here the author cannot deny himself the pleasure of informing his readers, that this <HI>succedaneous vomitive</HI> of the ancients is, at this time, a noted <HI>vulgar remcdy,</HI> in the beginning of certain <HI>infections</HI> diseases, and particularly of that most dreadful one the <HI>jail distemper;</HI> and that where it can be used soon after the appearance of the symptoms, and repeated several days successively, it will be found the <HI>most efficacious one,</HI> perhaps, hitherto discovered; several very remarkable instances of its efficacy in carrying off the jail-distemper caught at the <HI>Old-Bailey</HI> in May, 1750, and in September, 1772, having, on these two me∣lancholy occasions, come under his immediate notice.—In some consumptive disorders they prescribed the exercise of <HI>sailing,</HI> as a sovereign remedy to fortify the lungs, re∣move obstructions, and determine the quantity and force of the fluids towards the surface of the body; that is, to pro∣mote perspiration—"Si vera phthisis est, says <HI>Celsus,</HI> opus est longa navigatione, &amp;c."—This practice of the ancients probably took its rise from an old vulgar observation, namely, that '<HI>sailors</HI> were, in general, much less subject than other people to a consumption of the lungs:' For, having remarked, that discoveries and improvements, which would have done honour to the most enlightened under∣standings, were sometimes stumbled upon by persons of more confined abilities, they thought it no discredit to their own superior talents to insorm themselves, even by means of the lower class of people, of simple remedies con∣lirmed by experience; agreeably to the advice of the great father of physic [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.]
<P>Being sensible that the art of healing took its rise from <HI>natural sagacity</HI> improving upon accidental discoveries, and unforeseen events, they did not employ their time in writ∣ing imaginary theories, and mingling false philosophy with intrinsic truth; but in carefully collecting the simple ob∣servations, experiments, and casual discoveries of others, even the most obscure and illiterate people, and afterwards sul jecting them to the rigid scrutiny of variously repeated trials; in making diligent observations and cautious expe∣riments themselves, and in writing pure and accurate histo∣ries of diseases which came under their cognizance; i. e. in diligently collecting the laws enacted by Nature, and de∣scribing them in the very manner Nature spoke them. And if this direct though difficult route to <HI>medical certainty</HI> had been steadily and uniformly pursued by succeeding physi∣cians, without deviating into the uncertain though smooth∣er paths of fanciful philosophy, or hypothesis, (that spe∣cious image of truth, that idol to which the learned still bow down) or being seduced by the love of ease, and the facility of playing with the passions of mankind to their own private emolument, from the age of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> down to our time, physic in general would have made a different appearance from what it does at present ["Si jam indè ab Hippocratis temporibus ad hanc nostram usque aetatem, (to use the more expressive language of the learned and judi∣cious Baglivi) <HI>praestantissimae artis</HI> Studiosi, hanc quidem promovendae artis rationem constanter retinuissent, dici vix potest, quot quantique progressus hac hodiè parte haberentur.

<P>During a course of experimental inquiries into the pecu∣liar and distinct medicinal properties of vegetables, that is, their real effects, disting uished from the operations of Na∣ture unassisted, in the human body, (prosecuted for up∣wards of twenty years, in the manner originally, and hi∣therto almost solely, practised by <HI>Dioscorides</HI>) the author is not ashamed to own, that he has, with uncommon assi∣duity, and no inconsiderable trouble and expence, sought every possible means of informing himself of the traditional knowledge, and empirical practice, of the common people; and from this source alone he has drawn more real assist∣ances, in ascertaining the medicinal powers of simples, than from the most famous modern <HI>herbals;</HI> in which, not one in forty (innumerable experiments warrant the asser∣tion) will answer the character it beart, and many are still celebrated for a thousand divine virtues, that are scarcely endued with one valuable property.—The merit of Diosco∣rides's <HI>Herbal</HI> (meaning his GENUINE work; for the wri∣ter has abundant reason to suspect, that many spurious ar∣ticles, misnomers, and false de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riptions hitherto unnoticed, have been foisted into it since his time) must have been of a very different complexion.—What Petronius says of the celebrated philosopher Democritus, namely, that he lived and died in the midst of experiments, may, with strict truth, be applied to this indefatigable author of <HI>medical bo∣tany:</HI> For, we are assured, that he advanced nothing in his <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> but what was confirmed to him by <HI>real</HI> ex∣periments. The last experiment he made was upon an high∣ly deleterious plant: The dose proved too strong for his con∣stitution; and he expired in the very act of describing its effects upon himself, and the symptoms it produced.—If this poisonous plant was, as hath been supposed, a species of the <HI>wolf's bane,</HI> it was most probably that with the <HI>blue belmet flower,</HI>—universally deemed by the ancients one of the rankest vegetable poisons.</P>
<P>The industrious Linnaeus, speaking of the <HI>yellow wolf's bane—Flor. Lappon.</HI> p. 179.

Being desirous to advise her better, for I thought she was not acquainted with the herb, and might mistake it for a species of the geranium or crane's-bill, call∣ed gratia Dei, which it greatly resembles; I intreated her, in a very serious manner, not to destroy herself by eating a most deadly poison. She smiled at my apprehensions for her, and told me that she was very well assured of being right in her choice of the herb, and that she with the rest of her neighbours had eaten of it for a great many years. I went to her cottage, where she cut the plant she had ga∣thered into small shreds, and boiled it with a little piece of fat meat, and made a soup with the ingredients, on which herself, her husband, two children, and an old woman, made an hearty meal; and, what I own greatly surprized me, without any damage or bad consequence. And thus it happens, says this diligent explorer of Nature, that THINGS ARE FREQUENTLY DISCOVERED BY TEMERI∣TY, WHICH REASON MIGHT NEVER HAVE INVESTI∣GATED."</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this remarkable instance of the harmless effects of the leaves of this plant when young and tender, it appears from the real experiments made by Matthiolus up∣on condemned malefactors with its <HI>root alone,</HI> that the fatal effects of it could not be prevented by any antidotes he was acquainted with. —The most effectual <HI>corrector</HI> of vege∣table poisons in general the writer has yet found out, in the course of his experiments, is a pure vegetable acid, or vinegar of wood; the process for obtaining which was ori∣ginally published by Glauber, (an ingenious chymist, but a wretched philosopher) in the first part of his <HI>Philosophical Furnaces,</HI> where he shews professedly how to distil an acid spirit or vinegar from all vegetables, in great quantity, and at a small expence.</P></NOTE>: By which last alone, under a proper die∣tetic

<P>The celebrated professor <HI>Pitcairn</HI> long ago published to the world his notion of such a re∣medy, as a grand <HI>desideratum</HI> in physic: And an illustrious successor of his, in the same pro∣fessorial chair, <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> used often, in his public lectures, to speak of the possibility of discovering a remedy that might cure most or all acute febrile diseases; and actually recom∣mended the trial of medicines composed of <HI>an∣timony</HI> and <HI>mercury,</HI> ("ad magnam penetrabili∣tatem arte deductis") for that purpose.—The author is in possession of a <HI>remedy,</HI> without <HI>an∣timony, mercury,</HI> or any other <HI>mineral,</HI> in its composition, which he believes will immediate∣ly cure a <HI>fever, in its incipient state:</HI> That it has been used, with great success, at <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> and other places in <HI>Turky,</HI> in carrying off the <HI>plague</HI> itself, when administered on the first appearance of the symptoms, he is assured by a traveller, of great learning and curiosity, to whose friendly communication he owes his knowledge of it.</P>
<P>The prevailing <HI>hypothesis,</HI> that a <HI>fever</HI> is 'NA∣TURE'S instrument to expel an enemy;' or, in
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>other words, that 'every fever is its own cure,' and consequently, that no medicine can be said, in strict propriety, to cure a fever, was origi∣nally invented by <HI>Asclepiades,</HI> (that finished master in the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) above eighteen hundred years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very learned and ingenious Dr. Middleton, in his 'Dissertation on the state of physicians among the old Ro∣mans,' makes Asclepiades cotemporary with Cicero; who, in his first dialogue <HI>de Oratore,</HI> introduceth Lucius Crassus speaking of him as his intimate friend and physician—"Neque vero Asclepiades, is, says he, quo nos medico amicoque usi sumus, tum, cum eloquentia vincebat caete∣ros medicos, in eo ipso quod ornate dicebat, medicinae fa∣cultate utebatur, non eloquentiae."—He likewise asserts, that when Asclepiades came first to Rome, he knew nothing of physic; contrary to the express testimony of Caelius Au∣relianus, Oribasius, and other authentic documents, from which it plainly appears, that he practised physic at Parium, and other cities bordering upon the Hellespont, and even at Athens, (where we find him treated with particular marks of distinction by the celebrated philosopher Antio∣chus Academicus, afterwards preceptor to Cicero) long be∣fore he settled at Rome. The Doctor's other assertion, re∣specting the friendship and intimacy between Asclepiades and Cicero, includes a manifest anachronism, really sur∣prizing in so great a critic, more especially in one who has elsewhere given such ample proofs of his knowledge in the biographical history of those times; and what adds to our wonder on this occasion is, that he quotes the above passage from Cicero's <HI>Orator</HI> in support of it: But whoever will be at the trouble of comparing the genuine memoirs anti∣quity has given of the life, social connexions, and death, of L. Crassus, one of the principal interlocutors in the <HI>Ora∣tor,</HI> and the ingenious account the Doctor himself gives of those highly finished and truely admirable dialogues, in his history of Cicero's life, with that remarkable quotation of Sextus Empiricus—<HI>adversus Logicos, sect.</HI> 201—from a ce∣lebrated work of the just-mentioned Antiochus, published much about the same time the scene of these <HI>dialogues</HI> was laid at the <HI>Tusculanum</HI> of Crassus, [i. e. in the year of Rome 66z, when Crassus, who died soon after, was 56 years old, and Cicero but a youth of sixteen] in which he makes ho∣nourable mention of Asclepiades, but as who had been some time dead—I say, whoever collates these several accounts, will presently discover Doctor Middleton's pal∣pable misinterpretation of this passage in Cicero.—This Asclepiades was indisputably the greatest master antiquity can count in the <HI>medicina politica:</HI> By a peculiar attention to the passions, and foibles of human nature, he was ena∣bled to discover an universal propension in mankind to be deceived—From thence he took the hint of <HI>advancing his fortune,</HI> by cultivating this <HI>ductile propension</HI> to the highest pitch it was capable of; and in defence of this practice the following argument was originally invented, and occasio∣nally urged—<HI>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur;</HI> which has been used, on similar occasions, ever since. He first in∣vented the <HI>lecti pensiles,</HI> or hanging beds, in which the sick might, with great facility, be rocked to sleep. These anodyne machines of his took prodigiously: Many of his noble patients had them made of silver; and they after∣wards became a considerable part of the Roman luxury.
<P>Notwithstanding the boundless strife of opinions that un∣happily attended physic after the death of its great parent <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the ancient pharmacy still preserved its foot∣ing, in some degree, as likewise the Hippocratic doctrine, till this <HI>arch-craftsman</HI> of the profession had the cunning and address to demolish the whole, calling it, in derision, 'a meditation upon death.'—He made the whole <HI>materia medica</HI> to consist only of such things as would give ease, and exhilerate the spirits of the patient: Nay, in certain cases he administered to the luxury of his patients, and indulged them in the use of wine, even to intoxication. This flat∣tering of the palate, in conjunction with his new amusive inventions, and a lucky accident of his discovering some signs of life in a man that was carrying to be buried, whom he soon recovered, and whom the people were persuaded to believe he had raised from the dead, conspired to make him the supreme archiater of those times; and what still farther contributed to establish him in this elevated station, was his having publicly challenged the Fates, by constantly de∣claring that he should never be visited by any bodily di∣stemper. Nay, Pliny the historian informs us, he held diseases and prematurity of death so much in defiance, that he would frequently, amongst his acquaintances, offer to lay any wager, and even to stake his whole fortune, that he should never be sick, as in fact he never was, not even at the time of his death; for that he broke his neck by a fall down a pair of stairs.</P></NOTE>. But this hypothesis, how∣ever
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>specious, however recommended, by the sanction of antiquity, and the later authority of
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>great names, has always appeared to the author unsupported by Reason and FACTS.—The most plausible argument he has met with, in favour of this <HI>theory,</HI> is, that in acute diseases of the eruptive kind, and particularly in the <HI>small-pox,</HI> 'as soon as the morbific matter is expelled to the surface of the body, the fever ceases:" therefore, 'the fever is an effort of NATURE to relieve herself.' But it is well known to every experienced practitioner, that the less the
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>fever is in the natural small-pox, the fewer will be the pustules, and the variolous matter more happily expelled; or, according to our great <HI>Sydenbam, [Angliae lumen, artis Phaebum]</HI> "Quo sedatior est sanguis eo melius erumpent pus∣tulae."</P>
<P>It has indeed been a received opinion, almost ever since the first appearance of the small∣pox<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The small-pox was first described, and treated of by <HI>Aaron</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in his <HI>Pandects of physic,</HI> which he published about the middle of the <HI>seventh century,</HI> accord∣ing to <HI>Haly Abbas</HI>'s account. But as the original works of this author, in the Syriac tongue, and the Arabic transla∣tion of them by Maserjawaihus, are both lost, and nothing of them now remains, but some extracts, which <HI>Mohamed Rhazes</HI> has left us in his <HI>Continens;</HI> we have no certain ac∣count extant of the precise aera of this disease, nor in what country it first appeared. The most probable opinion is, that it had its rise in <HI>Arabia Faelix,</HI> and was brought from thence to <HI>Alexandria</HI> by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> when they took that city, A. D. 640, in the reign of <HI>Omar Ebnol Chatab,</HI> the second successor to <HI>Mohamed:</HI> For <HI>Paulus</HI> of <HI>Aegina,</HI> who lived at <HI>Alexandria</HI> about <HI>twenty years</HI> before, makes no mention of it in his works; though he assures us, in his preface, that he had treated of every disease <HI>then</HI> known. From this time, the small-pox spread, with amazing rapi∣dity, wherever the <HI>Saracens</HI> extended their conquests: West∣ward into <HI>Spain,</HI> about 30 years after, according to <HI>Ockley;</HI> and eastward as far as <HI>Japan,</HI> whither it was carried near the same time, as <HI>Kaempfer</HI> informs us.—Respecting the practice of the celebrated <HI>Rhazes</HI> above-mentioned, it may not be impertinent to remark, on this occasion, that he carried the <HI>cold regimen</HI> farther than it has been ever carried since, even by Mr. Sutton himself, as evidently appears from his method of treating the <HI>small-pox</HI> and <HI>measles.</HI></NOTE> in Europe, that 'a certain degree of fe∣ver
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>is always required, to concoct, separate, and expel, the vitiated and infectious matter.' But Mr. <HI>Sutton</HI> (the reputed author of the new method of inoculation; though, by the bye, the very same method, <HI>in every essential point,</HI> was practised by <HI>Mr. Glass,</HI> an eminent surgeon in the university of Oxford, long before Mr. Sutton was known) has fully demonstrated, by many thousands of successful experiments, that the <HI>fever</HI> in this disease is so far from being 'NATURE'S instrument to expel an enemy,' that <HI>itself</HI> is her greatest enemy; and conse∣quently ought to be <HI>prevented,</HI> or <HI>extinguished</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Hippocr.</HI>]</NOTE> immediately. And, in his peculiar attention to this single point, the author has sufficient reason to believe Mr. Sutton's SUPERIOR success wholly consists: For, having had many favourable opportunities, during several years, of ascer∣taining, by means of a most accurately-made <HI>pyranthropometer,</HI> the natural heat of the body, in Mr. Sutton's patients, when in perfect health, immediately before their entering on his prepa∣ratory course, and afterwards during the pro∣gress of the disease; he found, in a variety of instances of a <HI>compleat</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> small pox,
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>the bodily heat, when at the highest, from six to fourteen <HI>degrees</HI> below <HI>that</HI> of perfect health.</P>
<P>The most distinguished ancient physicians of the <HI>Hippocratic</HI> school, had no other <HI>idea</HI> of a fever than <HI>that</HI> of their great master—viz. a <HI>fiery</HI> or <HI>preternatural heat.</HI> This preternatural heat they conceived of, as a <HI>symptom,</HI> the cure of which was the province of the physician; whilst the removing, and carrying off, the <HI>pri∣mary cause</HI> of this symptom, that is, the cure of the <HI>disease,</HI> was considered chiefly as the work of NATURE. Now, the <HI>primary cause</HI> of every fever is, as the author conceives, some <HI>stimulant or acrid matter spasmodically affecting the vascular and nervous system:</HI> Whether this matter be, 1st. A <HI>foreign substance</HI> lodged in the flesh—2dly, A <HI>putrid fomes</HI> absorbed into the habit, from gun∣shot wounds, &amp;c. in removing these two causes, NATURE may often require the <HI>surgeon's</HI> helping hand—3dly, <HI>Deleterious miasmata</HI> residing in the air—4thly, A <HI>putrid fomes</HI> of any kind, produ∣cing an <HI>acrimonious</HI> state of the fluids—5thly, <HI>Purulent matter</HI> lodged in the body, from inter∣nal suppurations—Or, 6thly, <HI>external cold,</HI> or, what is usually called <HI>catching of cold.</HI> This last mentioned, and, perhaps, most frequent cause of fevers, has been generally supposed to be the <HI>materia perspirabilis</HI> of <HI>Sanctorius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The doctrine of perspiration, though it owes its name, and present establishment, to Sanctorius, was not unknown to the ancient Greek physicians. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> believed all the surfaces of the parts of a human body, as well those of the muscles and viscera, as of the skin, to be naturally in a continual state of perspiration.—The following remarkable observation is <HI>Galen</HI>'s (<HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>de tuenda sanitate</HI>) "Prospi∣ciendum est, ut eorum quae eduntur et bibuntur, respectu eorum quae expelluntur, conveniens mediocritas servetur: Sane is modus servabitur, si ponderabitur a nobis in utris∣que quantitas."
<P>From this passage in Galen, Sanctorius undoubtedly took the first hint of his <HI>statical</HI> experiments for ascertain∣ing the daily waste of the animal fluids, made by the out∣lets of the external superficies of the body, and by the lungs: But it is impossible to ascertain the quantity of this waste, without knowing, at the same time, the quantity of moisture, &amp;c. absorbed or imbibed by the pores of the skin and lungs; <HI>which Sanctorius did not advert to:</HI> For the author of this, after violent exercise in riding, notwith∣standing a great expence of perspirable matter, and no food taken, has, in certain constitutions of the air and atmo∣sphere, facilitating the <HI>cutaneous immissions,</HI> often found him∣self, by most exact statical experiments, many ounces, some∣times twenty and upwards heavier than he was before. Hence it appears, that all we can with certainty discover, respect∣ing the quantity of <HI>sanctorian</HI> perspiration, by experiments of this kind, is, the difference between the <HI>exhalata</HI> and the <HI>inhalata,</HI> that is, between the perspirable matter we exhale from the pores of the skin and lungs, and whatever we imbibe or inhale through the same: For exhalation and in∣halation so confound each other as to render it impossible to ascertain the exact quantity of either; as the author pur∣poses, in a short time, to demonstrate more at large to the medical reader.</P></NOTE>, retained in
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>the body, or, as it is commonly expressed, <HI>ob∣structed perspiration:</HI> But a course of <HI>statical</HI> ex∣periments
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>instituted principally with a view to ascertain this doctrine, and regularly prosecuted with a most scrupulous exactness, for eighteen months, fully convinced the author, many years ago, (as a similar course of experiments, prosecuted, for one year, at <HI>Charles-Town, South-Carolina,</HI> in like manner convinced his ingenious friend and fellow-labourer Dr. <HI>Lining</HI>) that no fever is caused merely by obstructed perspiration.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the branches of medical knowledge, the most highly interesting, and subser∣vient to health, long life, and happiness in this world, is the <HI>prophylactic,</HI> founded upon the two great preventive principles, DIET and HA∣BITUAL EXERCISE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By habitual exercise the author means not such as is frequently undertaken, but seldom gone through with; but such as is brought to a habit, by being closely repeated, with moderation, and without any irregular intermission. 'Tis the want of a right conception of a <HI>habit</HI> that has oc∣casioned the abuse and neglect of this sovereign <HI>preventive</HI> of diseases, as well as <HI>common aid</HI> to physic.—By continual dropping, even so soft a body as water can act upon a stone; by incessantly pursuing his blow, the smith can bring heat into his bar of iron: The act itself, simply considered, is weak and trifling; but the habit is of wonderful efficacy. —'By temperance, and a singular perseverance in the virtuous toil of martial exercises,' <HI>Socrates</HI> (the light and glory of the heathen world) is said to have acquired a con∣stitution superior to the inclemency of the elements, and to the attacks of disease; striking instances of which we find recorded by <HI>Plato (Conviv.</HI> and <HI>Phaed.</HI> where it ap∣pears, that he had brought himself, by the force of habit, to use the same cloathing, and to go barefooted, all the year round), by <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> in his life of that prince of philosophers, and by <HI>Aelian</HI> in his <HI>various history:</HI> The following is one of them—"When an almost universal pestilence had seized upon the camp, at the siege of <HI>Poti∣daea,</HI> insomuch that eleven hundred men in the army were carried off, and <HI>Athens</HI> was half depopulated, by the con∣tagion, he escaped the distemper in both places, and was the only one, before <HI>Potidaea,</HI> who, during the two years blockade of that city, did not in some measure feel the severity of it [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.]</NOTE>—THE ONLY SURE MEANS
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>OF PRESERVING TO THE BLOOD ITS ORIGINAL PURITY, TO THE SECRETIONS THEIR FREE COURSE, TO THE NERVES THEIR DUE TONE, TO THE MUSCLES THEIR STRENGTH AND FIRMNESS, AND TO THE TASTE ITS NATIVE RELISH FOR GENUINE SIMPLICITY.</P>
<P>On this preservative branch of medicine, and particularly on the <HI>dietetic</HI> part of it, a multi∣tude of books have been written; many of them by physicians of eminence, with a spirit of phi∣lanthropy that does honour to the profession. But, as those productions consist chiefly of ge∣neral rules laid down for mankind without di∣stinction, to preserve their health, and prolong their lives, they have not proved in any degree adequate to the proposed end: For, so infinite is the variety of constitutions, (in respect of which all food acts, by a certain immutable law of Nature, <HI>relatively &amp; secundum quid,</HI> as logi∣cians express it, not <HI>absolutely &amp; per se</HI>) that any general rule laid down to any number of men, for this purpose, must be hurtful or de∣structive to the greatest part of them at least,
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>if they all comply with it. Happily for man∣kind, all the needful directions, on this head, <HI>universally</HI> conducive to health and long life, may be comprized in a very small compass, without overloading the memory, or confound∣ing the judgment.—If people would only follow the dictates of that most beneficent of all legislators, Nature, by letting the stomach <HI>al∣ways</HI> take the lead of the palate, and by feed∣ing moderately upon such things as they find they can digest with the least trouble and in∣convenience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—Vid. Galen. lib. vi. de sanitat. tu∣end. c. 9.</NOTE>, they would need no other prac∣tical rule of diet: So far as this extends, every reasonable man, of competent age and expe∣rience, must infallibly be a better judge of what he ought to do, for the benefit of his health, than any physician can be, who is not intimate∣ly acquainted with all the circumstances of his constitution.</P>
<P>As for those whimsical hypocondriacs who, like their brain-sick brother in the comedy of <HI>Moliere,</HI> are eternally making an outcry, tho' nothing ails them, and those more especially who have been persuaded to purchase health and longevity by eating and drinking exactly by weight and measure, as if they could supply the various and alterable exigences of Nature just as they fill a tub, the capacity and dis∣charges
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>of which are always uniform and the same; they are in imminent danger of falling into the doctors hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would seem, that this sort of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> must have been very badly off for a physician, in the time of ho∣nest Esculapius, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—so the prince of poets titles him] of venerable memory, if what Plato tells us of him, in his <HI>Republic,</HI> be true; namely, that it was his de∣liberate opinion—"That in all well regulated societies, where every man has his station affigned him, no man can, or ought to have leisure to be a <HI>valetudinarian</HI> all his life, and bestow his whole care upon his carcase." He farther informs us, that his two sons, Podalirius and Machaon, were of the same opinion, and maintained, "that physic was not made for <HI>such people,</HI> and that it was not their duty to prescribe for them, even though they were as rich as Midas!!"</NOTE>. An oeconomist of this sort might, with equal propriety, impose upon himself the critical task of standing or sit∣ting continually in the same place, of lying al∣ways in the same bed, of wearing constantly the same weight of cloaths, and of riding or walk∣ing every day precisely the same number of feet and inches; nay farther, he must compound with Providence for continual wet weather, or continual dry, for the same immutable degree of heat and cold, and the same invariable con∣stitution of the air in which he breathes: For 'tis certain that all these may, some way or other, affect the constitution, appetite, and di∣gestion, so as to require sometimes larger, and
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>sometimes more sparing meals, and the occa∣sional use of weaker or stronger liquors.</P>
<P>In general, the best rule, perhaps, that can be laid down, for preserving health, and pro∣longing life, is (what the most elegant <HI>Celsus</HI> recommended to the world sixteen hundred years ago) <HI>to observe strictly no particular rule at all;</HI> but, upon the rational principle of mode∣ration and temperance <HI>[noverca medicorum],</HI> to follow the sober dictates of Nature; who has not ordained a single want to man, the <HI>reasona∣ble</HI> satisfaction of which, (besides its manifest subserviency to health) does not afford a plea∣sure every way superior to what can be found in any unnatural gratification of the appetities: For true pleasure is the bounty of Nature, and Reason her dispenser of it.</P>
<P>To conclude—In spite of all the false refine∣ments of art, the true sublime of taste, and the sweet simplicity of Nature, will for ever continue inseparable. In <HI>diet,</HI> SHE is so far from objecting to <HI>variety,</HI> that she delights in it: Her protest is only against <HI>that,</HI> which is produced by the destruction of <HI>Simplicity;</HI> against <HI>that,</HI> by which the <HI>palate</HI> is debauched from its natural taste, the <HI>appetite</HI> irrecoverably depressed through the cloying repetition of pre∣ventive viands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Hippocr.</NOTE>, [such, for instance, are the
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>infernal compounds of French cookery] the functions of the <HI>body</HI> robbed of their sprightly vigour, and all <HI>its</HI> powers for the true relish of pleasure enervated; in short, against <HI>that,</HI> whereby the votaries of luxury are prematurely cut off from her richest inheritance, HEALTH and LENGTH OF DAYS.</P>

<P>ONE of the most troublesome and ob∣stinate complaints, to which chil∣dren are liable, is the HOOPING COUGH. The methods of treating it hitherto in use, have generally been found ineffectual to stop its progress, or to suppress it with safe∣ty, before it hath run its natural course.—</P>
<P>OUR great master in physic, DR. SYDEN∣HAM, in his account of it says—"What others may be able to do in this disease, I know not: as for myself, I have used abundance of all sorts of medicines, and still lost my labour."</P>
<P>THE author of the foregoing discourse, whose practice is much among children, therefore informs the public, that by a long series of experimental inquiries into the nature and causes of the diseases of chil∣dren in general, and of this hitherto in∣tractable, and frequently fatal one in par∣ticular, he has discovered a safe and easy method of treating it with success.</P>
