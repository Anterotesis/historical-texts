<P>Among which Productions, for the Good of Man kind, and cheap and easy attaining, restoring, and preserving of Health, there never yet has been any Thing made known to the World of that prodigi∣ous and almost incredible Virtue and Efficacy, as Dr. <HI>BATEMAN</HI>'s PECTORAL DROPS, which are justly to be preferr'd to, and distinguish'd from all others, for their wonderful, and almost infallable Effects, not only in Colds, Agues, Fevers, Colics, Melancholy, and Rickets; but also in curing those great and implacable Enemies of our Health and Ease, the Gout, Rheumatism, Jaundice, Stone, Gravel, and Astma's.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the</HI> GOUT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS is a Distemper of that inveterate and malig∣nant Nature, as to be a continual Foil and Reproach to the best Physicians of all Ages: No Method of Physic, Diet or Habit, however regular, reasona∣ble and orderly, no Prescriptions, tho' bearing the specious and plausible Sanction of Academic Graduate, and Collegate Learning, being able to give a Turn to this Distemper, or reach its secret Recesses; for, re∣tiring into the Extremities of the fine Capillary Vessels, where, by reason of the unequal Celerity and languid Motion of the Blood in those Parts, its venemous Particles are suffer'd to attract one another with great Violence: It bids Defiance to all their Art, and will oft∣ner yield to one lucky Nostrum, than all the repeated Assaults of what they call Regular Practice, which is never more ineffectual and at a Loss, than in this Case; and more especially, if that No∣strum be prepared as These DROPS are, for such a Species of Simples as are capable of being render'd, by such Preparation, fit to pierce the very inmost nervous Colls, increase the Impetus of the Vital and Animal Fluids, and follow the Particles of the morbific Matter thro' all the fine Meanders of the Blood, till having disturb'd their At∣traction, and broke them, by repeated Collisions, one against an∣other, into the minutest Parts, it forces most of them thro' the Pores of the Body by Perspiration, obtunding, absorbing, and carrying the rest away with it in its Course, till arriving at the Kidneys, they are secreted there from the Blood, and pass away by Urine. All which Operations, These DROPS to a Miracle perform, by Virtue of their Diaphoretic, Absorbent, and Detergent Qualities; opening at once all the Emunctories of the Body, and forcing off, through them, the very Root and Basis of the Distemper they are to cure; and that this is the only effectual, rational Method of treating this obstinate Distemper the Gout, I appeal to that great Searcher of Na∣ture, Dr. Sydenham, who says, Whatsoever is assistant in discharg∣ing the foul, vicious Humours, out of the Body, can never fail of answering the Intention of Cure for which it is design'd, whether in the Gout, Rheumatism, or any other Cronic Distemper. And his Authority, I should think, ought not reasonably to be disputed in the Cure of this Distemper, whom, not only a vast Stock of acquir'd Learning, together with a prodigious natural Capacity, improv'd by long and great Practice, and Experience upon Others; but also a continued and unconquerable Gouty Habit in his own Body, con∣firm'd in this Opinion, That there was no other Method of treating this terrible Distemper; which is also confirm'd by what those two admiral Physicians, Dr. Keile, and Dr. Quincey, have told us con∣cerning the Cause of it; which, say they, is created by the mucila∣ginous
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>Glands in the Joints becoming gritty and stiff, by Means of a sharp acid Humour flowing thereon, which, coagulating the oily Liquor secreted by them for lubricating the Ends of the Bones at their several Articulations, to render them apt and ready for Motion, makes it, instead of promoting and assisting that Motion, impeed, and prevent it, by clogging the Interstices so that they cannot move at all, at least, not without very great Pain, hard'ning, by Degrees, into white, chalky, gritty Stones, which are forced to be cut, or otherwise taken out by Art, from the Joints of the Hands and Feet of the miserable Patient, as daily Experience manifests.</P>
<P>Now you are to observe, That the Particles which compose this sharp acid Humour, are surrounded with little pointed Needles, which wound and irritate the Vessels thro' which they move, and the very Globules of the Blood itself, beating and coagulating thereby any Fluid with which they mix; but these being either obtunded and blunted, and the Points of them, as it were, sheath'd and wrap'd up in some of the Particles of this Medicine, or else drove violently against one another with a Force sufficiently to break off those little pointed Spears, and render them capable of flying off by Perspiration by others; or else so disturb'd and sepa∣rated by this new Auxillary Force, that they cannot attract one an∣other, but un willingly disperse themselves in the Blood, and are many of them secretted and carried off by Urine; This, I say, must necessarily answer the Intention of Cure; for by this Means they are render'd incapable of irritating, loading, or coagulating any of the Fluids; and then, on Course, the Distemper before caus'd by them, must by Degrees abate, and at length absolutely cease. To which Ends and Purposes, These DROPs are so excellently adapted and prepar'd, and are in their Nature so very Absorbent, Detergent and Diaphoretic, that it is morally impossible they should fail of working a Cure, which can only be perform'd by the joint Opera∣tion of those three Qualities, which are scarce to be met with, in any considerable Degree, in any one Medicine in the World, but THIS alone.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, some who understand no more of this Distemper than the Pain and Torture it gives them, will say, That, probably in the former Stage of this Distemper, these Drops may be effectual; but, say they, mine is in my Stomach, Bowels, &amp;c. and they will not be able to reach it there. But how weak and trivial an Objec∣tion this is, will appear from a Reflection upon this Phase of the Gout, which is only caus'd by a Weakness and debility of Nature, thro' frequent Debauches, hard Drinking, long Courses of useless Physic, &amp;c. whereby the Impetus of the Blood becomes so weak and languid, and its Motion so slow and irregular, as to permit the morbific Particles to attract one another in the Blood Vessels of those Parts, which can only be remedied by such Things as warm and in∣crease the Blood's intestine Motion, so breaking and disturbing the Attraction of the venemous Particles, and sending them back again to the extream Parts, where they are to be treated as before: For which Purpose, nothing in Nature can be better fitted than These
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>Drops, which have such a fine invigorating Alexiterial Property in them, as to render them one of the best Cardiacs in the whole Materia Medica.</P>
<P>THE Dose, in the former Phase of the Distemper, is a large Spoon∣ful, in any warm Vehicle, as Mountain Wine, strong Ale, &amp;c. made as hot as you can drink it, repeated three Nights successively, going to Bed, and, by the Blessing of GOD, you need not fear Ease.</P>
<P>But in the latter Phase, where the morbific Matter is not only to be repelled, but the faint and languid State of Nature enliven'd, and invigorated, it is necessary that you increase your Dose as the Cause may require, in any warm Vehicle, as before; composing your self after it, and encouraging the Sweat by all proper Methods.</P>
<P>After this, in order effectually to rout this most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errible Enemy; it is necessary you continue to take a small Dose of about 100, or 150 Drops, every. Three Nights alternately; taking three Nights, and missing three Nights; till such time as you find the Strength of the Distemper to abate, which it will sensibly do in a small time, and at length quite go off.</P>
<P>Instances of the Cure of this Distemper, by These DROPS, might be given in great Numbers, from Persons of undoubted Credit, and Reputation, on enquiry, would satisfy the Curious of their wonder∣ful Effect in that Intention; but not being willing to tire the Reader; and these Drops by their continual Success, so strongly recomending themselves; I shall out of a very great multitude only trouble you with a few, as you will find at the end of this Treatise.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the</HI> Rheumatism.</HEAD>
<P>HAving in the foregoing Chapter, been so very particular in describing the Origin, Nature, Rise, Progress and Cure of the Gout; there will be the less need of enlarging in this upon a Dissemper, so near a kin to it as the Rheumatism; even so near, as, in many Constitutions, to be owing to the same Cause, with this only Difference in the Effect, that as the former preys chiefly upon the Joints, and extream parts of the Body; This, for the most part affects the Membrana communis Musculorum, or rather, to speak more properly, the Membrana adeposa; at least that part of it which lyes between the Muscles, and the Cutis, and is the Basis or the Cel∣lulae adeposae; being full of small, fine Glands for the secretion of that Oily. Sulphureous Matter, of which the Adeps or Fat is composed, which Sulphureous Oil being coagulated, by the same means, says a learned Author, and from the same Causes, as the Juices of the Mu∣cilaginous glands in the Joints, are in the Gout; that is to say, from the Attraction of sharp, acid Particles, secreted from a viscous Blood; this Membrane, in which those Glandulae adeposae are scituated, be∣comes suff, harsh and rigid, and unapt for Motion, the Oil which those Glands continually discharge for lubricating the Muscles, be∣ing all turn'd by Coagulation into a fizey thick Jelly: So that every time the Muscle or Muscles, round which that part of this Membrane is wrap'd, contract, in order to perform Muscular Motion; they
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>are, instead of being assisted therein by that lubricating Oil, impeeded and confin'd by the stiffness of the Coagulum, and the Rigidity and Harshness of the surounding Membrance, 'till, by force of the ner∣vous fluid flowing into the Fibres, and extending them in the Con∣traction, they force it to give way; which is not without great Pain, and consequent Weakness and Soreness of that Part: Not to men∣tion the Pains caused by the unnatural Distentions of the Vessels, from the Quantity of Viscid Serum obstructing them and hindring the free Circulation of the Blood; especially in the fine Capillary Channells, without a considerable Dilatation; from whence, not seldom proceed Astma's, Pleurisyes, Peripneumonys, Inflamations, Fevers and Death.</P>
<P>This is only to be remedy'd by Diluents and Evacuating Medicines, as in the Gout; but not by any common Evacuators; many or most of which weaken Nature too much in their Operations, and being us'd without proper Diluents, will evap'rate all the real natural Se∣rum, and leave nothing but a sort of Serous Jelly in the Blood; which thereupon will either immediately Stagnate, or Effervesce in such a manner, as to cause a violent putrid Fever, and, without al∣most a Miracle, the certain Death of the Patient: It is true, they may ease the violent Pains of this Distemper, but if at the same time they increase the Inflamation, and Effervescence of the Blood, the Fever proportionably increases, and the poor deluded Patient dies; as too many do by common Practice: Whereas these DROPS dilute and expel what is redundant; whereby the Blood is restored to its na∣tural Crasis, it's due Velocity, and Impetus recover'd, the Pains cease, the Fever abates, perfect Health ensues. Besides which by their Alex∣iterial, Cardiac Qualities, at the same time that they thus encrease the Impetus and Moment of the Fluids to the Discharge of the Mor∣bific Matter in Prespiration; they also warm and comfort the whole nervous Sistem, assist mightily in repairing the Waste of the animal Spirits, occasion'd thereby; which is evident in what has been alrea∣dy said of them concerning the Gout in the Stomach, and Bowels, proceeding from a real Weakness and Decay of Nature.</P>
<P>In short, no Preparation was ever yet found out so suitable to the very Nature of this Distemper as these DROPS; which will plain∣ly appear from the vast number of Certificates of Cures wrought by them every Week, out of which I have thought fit to trouble you with but a few.</P>
<P>THE Dose and manner of ordering your self, is the same as be∣fore directed in the Gout; to be varied according to the Distem∣por, and strength of the Patient's Constitution, from 80, to 150 or 200 Drops, in any convenient Vehicle; which need not be so strong and spiritous as in that Distemper; but must be drank as warm as possi∣ble going to Bed, and Covering your self up warm, as before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the</HI> JAUNDICE.</HEAD>
<P>TO give you an exact Theory of this Distemper, would tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up more room than this short Treatise will admit of: I shall therefore, as I have done by the other Distempers, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> foregoing Chapters, open it so far to you, as to convince you, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these DROPS are the best Specifick (if I may be indulg'd tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Term) in the whole Materia Medica, to break thro' it's Schirrous Ob∣structions, and finally eradicate it and all its dreadful Symptoms ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the humane Body.</P>
<P>This Distemper arises from obstructions in the Glands of the Liver thereby preventing a due Secretion of the Gall from the Blood, by them, in that Viscus, which Bilious Particles circulating therewith gives a Yellow Tiucture to the Mucus or Corpus Reticulare spread under the Cuticula, which from thence appears of that Colour: This is the first and common Phase of this Distemper; but it will sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and more especially in hard Drinkers, arrive to that height, as to Cause a frequent Spitting and Vomiting of Blood, which is general∣ly reckon'd a Mortal Symptom; for it is caused by the Obstructions it the Hepatie Glands becoming schirrous, and so indurated, as with great Difficulty (if at all) to be opened again; which straitens the Motion of the Blood through that Viscus so much, as to cause it to revulse with a great Motion into the Gastrick Arteries, which go of from the Hepatic, insomuch, that breaking through them, it drains into the Stomach, and by that means the Course of that fluid is alter'd the Secretion of the Bile at an End, and the whole System destroy'd. So that this latter Stage of the Distemper is seldom or never to be cured; but may easily be prevented by taking the former Phase in time; powerfully deterging those tartarous obdurating Particles ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Blood; which can only be by strong Detergents and Diapho∣reticks, (which I have already prov'd to you these DROPS are and therefore cannot fail of Curing, if taken in time, and follow∣ed up, till by a Continuation they become perfect Alteratives:) And if any thing will cure the latter Phase of this Distemper, these DROP<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will, having done Wonders in it, even when the Patients have been given over by their Physicians, and the Distemper baffled their utmos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Skill.</P>

<P>THESE are one and the same Distemper, in two several De∣grees; the Stone being only concreted Gravel, and the Gra∣vel the Matter whereof the Stone is form'd; and in some wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is wash'd off it by powerful Nepritics and Lytholutics; both of them being in their Degree an aggregate of the tartarous Particles of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Urine, pent up by the Straitness of the Urinary Ducts; which is on∣ly to be cur'd by dissolving the Stone, widening and deterging th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of</HI> ASTHMAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE prodigious Variety of Causes from whence this Distem∣per proceeds, in different Constitutions, gives it so many va∣rious Species and Degrees, as to render it one of the most difficult Disorders to be skilfully manag'd of any affecting the human System. But the chief sorts are, the Humid, the Dry, and the Nervous Asthma; of each of which I will separately give a few Hints concerning their Causes and Systems, and then proceeding to the Description of the Effects of these Drops in all those Intentions.</P>
<P>But first, it is necessary to premise what an Asthma is in general; That it is a frequent, difficult, and short Respiration, or Breath∣ing, join'd with a hissing Sound, and a Cough; especially in the Night, in cold Weather, and in a prone Posture, or lying down: The former because the Pressure of the Atmosphere is greater in the Night than in the Day, when the noxious Vapours are exhal'd and dispel'd by the Force of the Sun Beams. In the Night, by rea∣son of the Pores of the Body being contracted by the circumambient Cold, our Transpiration is lessen'd, and consequently a Gravedo or Weight of perspirable Matter ensues; which being flung upon the Lungs, clogs them, and renders them less apt to perform their Office; and in the last Case, from the Pressure which the Contents of the Abdomen, when the Body is in that Posture, make upon the Diaphragm, thereby lessening the Capacity of the Thorax or Breast, so that the Lungs are too much confin'd, and cannot dilate them∣selves sufficient to receive a due Quantity of Air.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, it will be easily understood, how these se∣veral Kinds of Asthmas are produc'd: The first or Humid, call'd al∣so the Pleuretic Asthma, arises from the Redundance of Rheumatic Serum, and viscous Humours in the Blood, which being too thick to pass through the small Fibres of the Lungs stick close to the Sides of those Vessels, and obstruct the Blood in its Circulation; the Parts swell and often ulcerate, with great Pain, feverish Habbits, and dif∣ficulty of breathing: Or else the pituitous Particles are spewed out into the Bronchiae, especially if not impregnated with a due Pro∣portion
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>of Salts, causing a continual irritating Cough: In both which Cases all inciding Pectorals are good, all Diaphoretics, and whatever attenuates and lessens the Quantity of Serum; by that means depleting the extended Vessels, and working a Revulsion of the stagnating Humours: Which nothing can better effect than these DROPS, which evacuate both by Perspiration and Urine, and are certainly, at the same time, one of the very best Cardiacs in the whole World.</P>
<P>The next Species of this Distemper, is the dry or plethoric Asthma, caus'd either by too great a Repletion of a cachochy mious Blood call'd a Plethora, or else by too great a Rarefaction of that Fluid in its Vessels; so that the fine Canalls of the Lungs are too far distend∣ed; and consequently there is not room enough for the Air to in∣flate the Vessels, which produces an Inability of Respiration, for want of a due Degree of Expansion in that Viscus: Such Persons are generally crying out for Air; they always seem as if girted hard upon their Chest, and are almost become Victims to a long Scorbutick Cachetic Habit; of which this is the last, and oftentimes, for want of proper Remrdies apply'd in time, fatal Symptoms; for in this Case there is no time to use Alteratives, which work but slowly in the Mass of Blood; whereas, here we want an immedi∣ate Assistance; which can only be obtain'd by a Conjunction of Car∣diacs and Diapheretics, both which Qualities are eminently distin∣guishable in these DROPS; which can therefore never fail the Inten∣tion of Cure in this Distemper.</P>
<P>The Third and last Sort of Asthma I ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on'd, was the Ner∣vous; which is occasion'd by a Deficiency of the Pectoral Muscles, for want of a sufficient Quantity of Spirits to nourish and contract them; and is the dire Effect of a nervous Atrophy; and to be re∣medy'd by high, and vigorous Cardiacs; to rouse and invigorate decaying Nature, and, as it were, re-enkindle the almost extinguish'd Lamp of Life; which nothing can perform more effectually than these DROPS, which have a prodigious Influence in reviving the drooping Spirits, warming and comforting the Nerves, encreasing the Moment of the Blood, and doing every other Office requisite to call back the almost fleeting Life, by their admirable Cardiac Qua∣lity; insomuch that many have been restor'd to a Miracle, from even Death's Door by them alone, both in this and other Cases.</P>
<P>THE Dose in all these three Cases, is as before in the Gout, in any convenient Vehicle, but good Mountain Wine is best, if it can be procur'd, made very warm, as before; and taking Care you do not get Cold after it.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="11"/>that what we call Colds are the Basis, or Groundwork of most of those Epedemic Fevers, which so commonly rage in this Kingdom: for perspiration being diminish'd thro' a Contraction of the pores, caus'd by the perception of external Cold, the perspirable Matter flies off in a less Quantity than when the pores are more relax'd; and that part thereof which cannot get out, returns back into the Blood, which it heats and irritates more or less, according to the Quantity of Matter retain'd, forcing it to distend it's Vessels, and producing thence frequently a Solutio continui, whence follows the Idea of pain in that part, with a Gravedo or He winess of the whole Frame, but especially of the diseas'd part; or else, a Coryza or Defluxion of serous, sharp Humours from the Glands of the Head, thro' the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, &amp;c. from whence, if speedy Care is not taken, are engender'd Asthma's, Consumptions, Fevers, &amp;c. and a whole Train of Evils which may be easily and certainly pre∣vented, by a timely Use of some proper Evacuator, which shall by its Diaphoretic Quality, discharge the Blood of its Load of fo∣reign deleterious Matter; and force off the offending Particles thro' the Pores; which we call Sweating: To which Purpose, there is no one Thing in Nature more effectual than these Drops, which are a most powerful Diaphoretic, and never fail of Success in the most stubborn Cold whatever. It is an old and indeed most excel∣lent Maxim.</P>
<Q>"venienti occurrite morbo. Prevent a threatning Disease, for as the English Proverb has it, A Stitch in Time saves nine.</Q>
<P>And so 'tis here, a single Dose seldom or never fails curing a Cold, whereas if you let that Cold grow into a Fever, it may be the Work of several to compleat the Cure; and glad you may be to come off so; for nothing corrupts the Blood more than a Cold, by irritating, and inflaming it to the highest Degree; whence proceed Putrefacti∣ons, which if not evacuated by proper Remedies, increase the Fer∣vour, and often generate acute, putrid, and malignant Fevers, whose dire Effects daily Examples sufficiently demonstrate to every one's Experience. These deleterious and malignant Particles are therefore to be evacuated, both by augmenting the before dimi∣nish'd Perspiration, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ary Secretion; for by that means, a great Quantity of them pass off with the discharg'd Sarum, and on Course leffen the Fermentation in the Blood: But unless at the same Time, you use proper Cardiacs to refresh Nature, she will sink under this vast Burthen, for the Hurry and Heat the Blood is in, ne∣cessarily consumes a vast Quantity of the animal Spirits, which de∣caying faster than N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure can possibly return them, she must certain∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all beneath the prodigious Wast; unless reliev'd by some auxilia∣ry Force. Now as I have often mention'd before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Drops are both Draphorene, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iac; containing in themselves all those three gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Qualities, absolutely necessary in a compleat Febr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>elves by the Blessing of God effect a perfect Cure without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drop of any other Medicine.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<P>As for Agues they are only the Intermissions of Fevers, the cold Fit being only an accidental, and not an essential Property there∣unto; so that as they are properly a Species of a Fever, they are to be treated after the same Manner, and the Method and Intention of Cure, is the very same; and if so then consequently the same Remedy that prevails against one, cannot fail in the other.</P>
<P>And here, I cannot omit mentioning one peculiar Property in these Drops, sufficient of its self to recommend them effectually to all the reasonable Part of Mankind; who are not wedded to me∣thodical Error; and that is, their most powerful Energy in clearing the Blood from the Dregs of that fashionable (but in many Cases pernicious) Drug the Bark of Peru; commonly call'd, The Jesuites Bark. This is the publick Asylum of Mankind, the Panacea of the World, the sovereign and universal Orvietem against all the Diseases of Pandora's Box, and what not, in the Opinion of those valetu∣dinarian Wretches, who dare not eat a Meal's Meat, open a Cham∣ber Window, or so much as go to Stool, without the Leave of their Physician; whose constant Prescription is still the Bark, in some Form or other: If Madam has got a Fit of the Vapours, the Bark will chear her Spirits; If she has taken too plentiful a Dose of Ratifea, the Bark will make her as sober as a Nun; If she is Lovesick, the Bark is to moderate her Desires; and if she's in the raging Fever of Jealousy, the Bark is to make her believe that her Husband is as constant as a Turtle: In short, whenever the Privy-Counceller of Health is at a Loss what to do for his Guinea, he persuades his Pa∣tient she has an Intermitting Fever, and Bark is the Word to save the Expence of further thinking. Now by this you may judge, whe∣ther this gigantic Protean Drug, which is whimsically apply'd to so many chimaerical Evils, is of any valuable Use, any substantial Be∣nefit to Mankind in real Disorders, and Maladies, arising from a vitiated State of the Fluids. We seldom play with serious Matters, nor make Children Rattles of Diamonds. One learned Practitioner says, the Bark is a violent Styptic, and Astringent; another, it is solutive, and will of it's self, without proper Alteratives, pass im∣mediately downwards; One says it consists of a fix't Salt. another of a volatile, and a third that it is a Composite of both: One that it gives a Spur to the intestine Motion of the Blood; another that it locks up every Thing in the Blood, Some and those of Note too assert, that if given in large Quantities, it will by 'tis attenuating Pro∣perty create an Anasarca, or Dropsy; others that it is itself suffici∣ent if taken in Time to cure a Dropsy: One forbids the Use of it in Rheumatick Fevers, for fear it's attenuating Virtue rarely the Mass of Blood, and thereby enlarge the Dimensions of it's Vessels, so far, as to occasion an Aneurisma or Rupture, or at least greatly encrease the Idea of pain, of which Opinion, are no less Men then the fa∣mous Morton and Sydenham; whereas another later practitioner, no ways inferiour to either, by all means indicates the Bark in this Case, grounding his Notion upon Reason, and to use his own Words, conte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing and changing the common and trite but de∣ceitful Method of Practice by Observation.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
<P>Now if this be the Case, that these great and learned Men cannot agree among themselves, neither as to the Nature, nor Effect of this magical Drug; is it not greatly to be fear'd, and that with very good Reason, that if one is mistaken, they may all of them be so; the Con∣sequence whereof will be, that this famous panacea, like the Jay in the Fable, strip't of all it's borrow'd pomp, will appear to be of no other Use, but to fill up the Variety of Nature's Works; receiving a value only from Opinion, grounded on the Weakness of one part of the World, and the Wileyness of the other.</P>
<P>But if there be ana Virtue in this Drug, the Tast itself seems to point it out to be Styptic, and Astringent, which is also generally allow'd by all who have any Skill in it; while for Fashion sake they admit of other Qualities, as it were by prescriptive Right; and for Interest invent new ones to authorize it's Administration in some present Necessity: Now, if once it is allow'd, the Bark is Styptick and Astringent, it points out directly to the Manner of it's Ope∣ration and Effect; in seemingly giving a Turn to some certain pe∣riodical Exacerbations; for which it is more generally adminisser'd, as intermitting Fevers, Hemicranea's, Haemoptoes, Epilepsies, and Hysteries; which says a great and learned Author, are to be re∣liev'd by the Cortex only; but what Way is this Relief to be had? why, says the same Author, the Cortex locks up the febrile Ferment in the Blood; and, says he, in another Place, If Catharticks be gi∣ven soon after it they make the Type of the Fever return in it's old Shape, for when the Bark is carried off, what locks up the Distem∣per? From whence I conclude, that this mighty Medicine, like a cunning Mountebank, deludes us with plausible Appearances, and instead of really working a Cure, only postpones the Exacerbation, it may be for a Week, or a Fortnight, by locking the Cause up in the Veins; which upon any accidental Cold, little Irregularity, or imprudent Management, breaks out again with double Violence; the Consequence whereof is not seldom attended with the Death of the Patient, as common Experience daily confirms; unless with Morton you continue dosing your Patient with it every ten Days, till the next Syzygy; or else with another gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Physician give him as much after the Distemper is taken off as was sufficient to take it off in or∣der to prevent a Return, supposing that</P>
<Q>'que facta liberant, si ante fiant, prohibent.</Q>
<P>And pray what must the Consequence of this be; why, the Mass of Blood is impregnated with so prodigious a Quantity of Styptic Par∣ticles, that the Price you pay for your imaginary Cure is a valetudi∣nary State as long as you live; becoming entail'd upon your Physici∣an, as much as his Patrimony, since few that have been weak enough to be persuaded into this Habit, have the Resolution to get rid of the Poyson afterwards, unless by the same Hand that gave it them: where∣as would they be wise at lest, and get rid of their troublesome, danger∣ous Inmate as soon as they can, by dete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging and cleansing their Blood, they might in time, by the Blessing of providence, restore that Fluid to it's natural Crasis, and by Deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, overcome the malevolent Effects of their fashionable physic, for which purpose, as well at the other In∣tentions
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>in this Treatise, these DROPS have been greatly commended by several who have happily experienc'd their Effects; and those among the learned World, of both our Universities, and by them recom∣mended in this very Intention to the World, for the general good of Mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of the other</HI> VIRTUES <HI>of these</HI> DROPS.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto I have laid before you the particular Effects of these DROPS, in particular Cases; and that not by a dogmatical Assertion of their Virtues, or any canting Declaration of their specific Influence, and occult Qualities, Terms only serving to cover Ignorance and Imposition: But I have carry'd you thro' all the Meanders of Nature, in her several Turns and Windings, in her se∣veral various Phases, and Symptomical Appearances upon every Case affecting the humane System; which this noble and efficacious Medi∣cine is capable of searching: And from thence drawn such easy and rational Conclusions upon their Operations, as to make it visible to e∣very Capacity that has but the least Notion of the Connexion be∣tween Causes and their Effects, &amp;c. that they cannot fail in the se∣veral Intentions wherein they are advis'd; a Task which not any Self-Interest, nor any sinister View of serving my own Turn, has in the least indu'd me to; but purely the universal Good of Mankind, and Charity to my Fellow Creatures; as is plainly evident from the establish'd Reputation these Drops have already gain'd in the World, the surprizing Cures they have wrought, and the vast Quantities of them sold throughout the whole Kingdom: So that, there was no Occasion upon any of these Accounts to have been either at the Trouble or Charge of this Treatise, but purely to convince G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsay∣ers of their admirable Nature and Efficacy in the Intentions afore∣mention'd, to inform the ignorant of the Nature of their several Ca∣ses, and where they may meet with a speedy, certain, and safe Cure for their respective Maladies. And lastly, to assure the whole World that these Drops are no Quack Preparation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Drugs injudi∣ciously mixt and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbled together, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either Art or Design, but such as are grounded on both, and carefully suited to answer the several Intentions to which they are design'd; which any one capa∣ble of forming a right Judgment of Things, may on the reading this short Treatise, be sufficiently convinc'd of: Wherefore I shall enlarge no further on this Subject, only to assure you, that besides the several foregoing Intentions, these Drops are also wonderful in their stopping Diarrhea's and luxes of all Kinds; Vomitings, Ha∣moptoes, and other dangerous unnatural Discharges which weaken and destroy the entire humane System; They give immediate Ease in Colics of what Kind soever, whether St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, Wind, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us or Hy∣sterie; raise the languishing Frame of Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Consumptions, and Marasmi, if taken before the Lungs are ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ely corrupted, raise and chear the Spirits in melancholly Despondency, Hypocondriac and
