<HEAD>TO The most Eminently Learned, the <HI>President</HI> and <HI>Com∣munity</HI> of the ROYAL COL∣LEGE of <HI>PHYSICIANS,</HI> LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Intention of the following Pages, with Difference to your illustrious Body, is with all sub∣mission laid at your Feet, carry∣ing no other Views along with it, than to promote, the further Knowledge of <HI>medicine,</HI> the exact and artful Composition of which is so highly Necessa∣ry, and conducive to the Welfare of Man∣kind, and the Utility of the Publick.</P>
<P>I REST assured of a candid Reception from the Nature of the Design, which I have the vanity to think you will favour, because it is only level'd at a Reformation
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>some of the Errors in Composition that have crept into former, and are still retain'd in your last Edition of the <HI>London Dispensatory,</HI> and a further Recommendation of the many excellent Prescriptions, which you have with Justice to the <HI>Profession,</HI> continued and pub∣lish'd to the World, all which I shall en∣deavour to support by Authority, Reason and Experience; hence, I flatter myself with every thing that can be expected from a <HI>Society</HI> so distinguish'd for universal Lite∣rature, as well as their particular Know∣ledge in <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a meer Trifle which I offer, only as an Essay to what I have ready for the Press, and to which I doubt not of your ge∣nerous Approbation; for as 'the Study of your Lives is devoted to do Good, so you will certainly promote every Thing that tends to that great End; and what is of more Importance than to preserve Life, and re∣store to Man that valuable Blessing of Health?</P>
<P>THIS Collection of <HI>Antidotes,</HI> altho', no <HI>Epidemical Disease</HI> should happen (which God in his Mercy avert) is of universal Tendency, and speaks for itself: The Au∣thors were all Physicians of great Experi∣ence, some of whom liv'd thro' five or six <HI>Plagues,</HI> in which they had been singularly successful; and after that devouring Flame was Extinguish'd, they had in all their suc∣ceeding Practice, still a mighty Esteem for such Antidotes and Alexipharmicks as had
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>been Serviceable to them, when they stood so much in need of their Assistance, on which Oc∣casion they invented and introduced a whole Set or Collection of 'em, into Practice among which you have the various Prescriptions of Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh's</HI> great Cordial, that of Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby's</HI> Diaphoretick, Gascoyne Powder, with the Goa-Stone, and a great Variety of the <HI>Lapis Contrayerva,</HI> with many others; all which are very valuable in their Kinds, and consequently, I doubt not but the Publication of this will meet with a Reception equal to the Merits of those learned Gentlemen, who were the Compi∣lers of the several Recipe's and Prescriptions therein contain'd, which were certainly Stu∣died and found Useful for the publick Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>NOW, let, me beg leave of your learned <HI>Society</HI> to make some decent and modest Remarks upon your last Edition, of your <HI>Pharmacopeia</HI> that from the Justness of those Observations, you yourselves may Judge of the Necessity there is for a Refor∣mation of the same, and from the Speci∣mens I shall give, make the World sensible of the Usefulness of such an Undertaking, which, with the last Regards due to your venerable Body, I submit to impartial Judgment. And in the first Place, I shall not wast Time, either upon the Method, or Materials you have made Choice of in the Simples conducive to your <HI>Dispensatory,</HI> whether Roots, Barks, Woods, Herbs, Flow∣ers,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>Fruits, Seeds or the like, but do think it wou'd have been a Justice due to the Publick, as well as an Advantage to the <HI>Profession</HI> to have inform'd them, which of those Simples most constantly are in Use, which are seldom used, and which are ne∣ver used at all; which Things are very Ma∣terial, that Time and Money may not be thrown away upon what is perfectly Useless; as the Roots of Anthorae an Exotick, cal∣led the Counter-poison to Monkshood, not Traffick'd in, and of no Virtues that are recommended by the Experience of the Faculty. 2dly. Arundinis Saccharina; the common Reed and Sugar-Cane Roots of no Medicinal use. The Roots of Kings Spear or Asphodel, Male and Female, not Us'd or even Sold in the Druggist, or Apothecaries Shops, and many more.</P>
<P>THE next are those which, are seldom, or very rarely used, such as the <HI>Hermodactyls,</HI> Woad, Fullers Thistle, Hog-Fennel, Stinking Gladon, and an hundred others mention'd to little or no Purpose, which had been better left out, both for the ease of the Apothe∣cary, and the Prescriber, who is at first em∣barrass'd in so large a Field of Materials, loaded by some Authors with great Enco∣comiums of the Feats they have done in Physick, which are too apt to flatter and di∣sappoint the Presumptions of a young Pra∣ctitioner.</P>
<P>I SHALL pass by the rest of the Simples in this short Account, and leave 'em to a
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>stricter Enquiry, when I come to publish the <HI>Pharmacopeia Reformata,</HI> and so proceed to some more material Observations, among which, I shall first take Notice of, the Oxy∣mel scilliticum, which you have Prescrib'd just in the same manner as formerly, <HI>viz.</HI> Three <HI>Pounds of Clarified Honey, to two Pounds of Vinegar of Squills;</HI> whereas in Justness to the Operation, and Effects of this <HI>Medicine,</HI> here should be three Pounds of Vinegar of <HI>Squills,</HI> to two Pounds of Honey, otherwise the <HI>Me∣decine</HI> is so clogg'd with the Honey, that the Efficacy thereof is lost, and the <HI>Acetum</HI> hath not power to assist the Digestion, cut the viscous Flegm, discharge Wind and sour Belchings from the Stomach, and strengthen the Appetite; for which it is a noble Re∣medy, was it not so very Nauseous; but it may be excellently adapted by a skillful and judicious Physician, who by mixing equal parts of the <HI>Acetum scilliticum</HI> and Oxymel will gain his Intentions.</P>
<P>I CANNOT be surpriz'd that you have overlook'd this among so many other Com∣positions, which are so Faulty, that they are not capable of being made up or if they could, wou'd be of no Use, since you are pleas'd to persist in your daily Pra∣ctice to prescribe Galbanum along with Am∣moniacum, in order to be dissolv'd, in black Cherry-water, or other the like Vehicle, and are angry with the Apothecary, when he tells you plain, that he knows not how to dissolve <HI>Galbanum</HI> in an aqueous Body,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>tho' <HI>Ammoniacum</HI> will familiarly do it; if this Point had been clear'd up in your last Edition, of the <HI>London Dispensatory,</HI> and new Rules given to the Apothecary, how to make his Dissolution of <HI>Galbanum,</HI> this wou'd have been a great Improvement, and given a New turn to the Dispensations of Medicines, but till then, we shall believe it was not so artfully Corrected, as we had Reason to expect from Persons so well quali∣fy'd; otherwise the <HI>Spiritus Lavendulae com∣positus</HI> would hardly have remain'd in the Condition it stands, considering it is such a <HI>Farrago</HI> of inconsistences unskilfully blend∣ed, the Produce of which, is nothing at all; when at the same time the simple Spirit of Lavender, is so excellently useful, and may be enrich'd at the Physician's pleasure, with all the Volatile Aromaticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the Nature of the Case, becoming by this Means a <HI>Spiritus Lavendulae Extemporaneo Compositus.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Aqua Paeoniae Composita,</HI> or Peony-wa∣ter Compound, is an excellent Prescription, but wants much of what it was from <HI>Langius,</HI> who calls it his <HI>Epileptick Water,</HI> which Re∣ceipt I shall give you (as it was Originally) in the <HI>Pharmacopeia Reformata;</HI> in the inte∣rim it is high time to expunge <HI>Gilbert's Water,</HI> least some evil minded People shou'd deceive themselves, and others, in putting their Trust therein.</P>
<P>As to the Treacle of <HI>Audromachus,</HI> and <HI>Mithridate,</HI> of which I can find no Reforma∣tion made in your last Edition; it is one
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>grand Medley of a multitude of Simples jumbl'd together without Order or Design; the greatest Part of which are either useless, or ineffectual. I shall satisfie my own Opi∣nion only to declare that as generally us'd, and apply'd, they are both dangerous Me∣dicines ill prepar'd, very Hot and of disagree∣able Qualities to the Intentions they are administred. The grand Reason that has induc'd all Sorts of People to the Use of them, have been drawn from the Authority and Experience of the Antients; <HI>Galen</HI> says they, hath spoken in Praise of <HI>Treacle</HI> in two Pieces of his, directed to <HI>Piso,</HI> and <HI>Pamphi∣lianus.</HI> To which I answer, that the Autho∣rity cited, is of no force, because they do not appear to be <HI>Galen's</HI> Writings, but falsly attributed to him, which is the more Evi∣dent from the Stile and Manner of Writing, which is foreign from that of <HI>Galen's,</HI> besides there are several Terms, and Words made Use of not elsewhere to be found in the said Author's Works, according to the learn'd <HI>Mercurialis,</HI> who says, <HI>in eo plurima verba a Galeno nusquam usurpata, fabulosae aliqua &amp; stylus totus pene diversus reperiuntur.</HI> The same Author says, there ought not to be the least Fault in any of the Simples, that en∣ter that Composition, speaking of <HI>Treacle Vitium enim unius Medicamenti totum Composi∣tionem evertit.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Body knows the great Abuse in the Choice of Vipers, and that of the <HI>Mala∣bathrum,</HI> which not one in an hundred makes
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>a right Use of; besides this, the <HI>Myrrh</HI> we use, setting aside the smell, is nothing like that describ'd by <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> but rather <HI>Bdelliams,</HI> whereas the Troglotick is the fame, and we have no <HI>Opo-Balsamum,</HI> true <HI>Costus, Schaenanth, Dictamny</HI> of <HI>Crete,</HI> or <HI>Falernian Wine.</HI> The ge∣nerality of the <HI>Opium</HI> us'd at this Day, is no∣thing near so fine, or good as <HI>Mathiolus</HI> re∣lates, and scarce seems to be like what <HI>Dioscorides</HI> describes: For it is a perfect <HI>Meconium</HI> at this Day, as may be evidently Proved,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mithridate</HI> commonly met with in the Shops, is in the same Condition, having the same Faults and Imperfections, and therefore ought to be rejected, being too hot and acrid for the Intentions it is generally Prescrib'd, consequently it wants a con∣siderable Reformation, or else ought to be expung'd the <HI>Dispensatory.</HI></P>
<P>THE Confection of <HI>Alkermes,</HI> altho' ve∣ry prudently divested of its Perfumes now a-days, is a Composition very unartfully Invented and Describ'd by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and very little Reform'd and Amended by the Moderns, who still closely pursue the Er∣rors of the <HI>Arabian Physicians:</HI> Indeed the <HI>Lapis Laruli</HI> has been long since thrown out, and there remains little behind in this Me∣dicine, which bears a high Name, but what we may expect from the Juice or Sy∣rup of the <HI>Chermes-Berry</HI> with better Suc∣cess; for as to the <HI>Aloes Wood,</HI> we know little or nothing of it, and the Leaf-Gold there∣in,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>is a meer Amusement to Deceive the Credulous. <HI>Rondeletius</HI> instead of speaking in its Praise gives a severe Caution against the Use of it, which is Back'd by Mr. <HI>Fer∣rier,</HI> a Physician of <HI>Tholouse,</HI> who blames Phy∣sicians for the too plentiful Prescribing there∣of: See the <HI>Annotations</HI> and <HI>Observations</HI> of Mr. <HI>Guillemeau.</HI> The Confect of <HI>Hyacinth</HI> bears a great Resemblance to this, only that the last seems to be endowed with no Cor∣dial Virtue at all: Notwithanding the great Boasts made of it, from the Fragments of Precious-Stones, that enter the Compositi∣on, by the splendid shew of which, together, with the Leaf-Gold, many are induced to believe it is capable of performing Wonders.</P>
<P>AS I was treating of <HI>Mithridate,</HI> I must take the Liberty to return to the Subject, to shew that when <HI>Pompey</HI> found the Receipt thereof written in <HI>Mithridates</HI> own Hand, after the Defeat of that Prince, which he e∣steem'd as a vaulable Secret; it was Com∣pounded but of very few Simples, and those very common ones according to the follow∣ing <HI>Distick.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Composition then consisted, only of two Walnuts, two Figs, Twenty leaves of <HI>Rue</HI> stamp'd together, with a little Salt; and this was reckon'd a sovereign Antidote against any maglignant Air for 24 Hours together, it being sufficient for three or four Morning Doses, drinking after it a Glass of white Wine</P>
<P>THE next thing to be enquir'd into, is to know the Reason, why you still admit Leaf-Gold into several Preparations, since you very well know it is neither Cordial, Corro∣borative, Alterative, or does it any wise con∣tribute to the Nutrition of the Parts accord∣ing to <HI>Galen,</HI> in his Commentary on the first Book of <HI>Hippocrates, de ratione Victus in Acutis.</HI> It can by no Means be call'd an Alterative, in that the natural Disposition of the Body cannot be affected by Reason of the Solidity of its Parts, so that it can nei∣ther heat or cool, dry or moisten the solid, or fluid Parts, and how it becomes Purga∣tive I cannot imagine; all which makes good what <HI>Julius Caesar Scaliger,</HI> says in his Exer∣citations against <HI>Cardan</HI> Exerc. 272. There ought to be some Resemblance, some like∣ness in Configuration of Parts; between what gives the Nutriment, and the Body that receives it. Metals are proper to unite with, and feed Metals, but are imcompati∣ble, and foreign to the subsistence and in∣crease of Animals. If Gold is good in any Disease, it must certainly be so in the <HI>Hypochondriack, Melancholy,</HI> especially when
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>it is administred, not as the <HI>Arabians,</HI> in Pills or Powders, or as the Chymists in Potions like their <HI>Aurum Potabile,</HI> but plen∣tifully in Specie, or Golden Showers; nay, if the Physician cou'd but prescribe <HI>Bank</HI> Bills, his prescriptions would infallibly Cure all the Vapours in Town. This is a Specifick, even against <HI>South-Sea</HI> Head-Ach, which, is otherwise an incurable Disease.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot forbear to hint at the present use of <HI>Ivory,</HI> that is still con∣tinued, and recommended in many good Medicines, when every Body knows, and is thoroughly perswaded that <HI>Harts-Horn,</HI> has an hundred times the Virtue, since the o∣ther neither discovers Smell or Taste, or any Quality to recommend it for an ef∣ficacious Medicine; several Physicians have long since exploded it, as <HI>Durel Hantin, Mercurialis, Baccius, Sylvaticus Erastus, Al∣bertus, Sebizius,</HI> and others; but <HI>Ambrose Pa∣rey,</HI> by dint of Reason and Experience re∣futes, all the pretended and imaginary Qua∣lities assign'd to this useless and insignificant Drug.</P>
<P>THEREFORE it becomes more my Admi∣ration, that Gentlemen who have con∣sulted, and weigh'd all these things toge∣ther in the Balance of Reason, should still continue the Use of many useless, and ex∣travagant Drugs, which are now directed in the several Compositions of your <HI>Dispensa∣tory,</HI> many of which are rarely, or not to be got at all, and others at a very dear Rate,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>and good for little or nothing; the first of which I mean is, the Bone of a Stags Heart, the others are Ambergreese, Musk, and Be∣zoar so frequently prescribed on all Occasi∣ons, in the last of which there are so many vile Cheats practic'd, that it is a pity it should lye in the power of avaritious, and designing Men to Cozen and Deceive the World, with such vile Frauds.</P>
<P>TWO Parts in three of the Bezoar, of which is sold and made Use of in the Shops is, Fa∣ctitious, and the other that is Natural, is only fit to Deceive such as are willing to be Deceiv'd, and take a Pleasure to be carry'd down with the Stream of popular Errors. As to the Factitious, it is generally made up of <HI>Gall-Stones,</HI> found in the Gall-Bladders of Oxen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Lemnian Earth</HI> findly ground with a little <HI>Ambergreese,</HI> and so form'd in∣to Stones of various Sizes and Figures; and thus the subtle Artist cheats the Apothecary with his Counterfeit Stone, and the Physici∣an comes into the Confederacy, by prescrib∣ing his Bezoartick Bolus, or Powder to pick the Patient's Pocket: This fallacy up∣on the credulous Sick, will in a little time become as despicable, as the vain Pretenti∣ons of the <HI>Alchymists,</HI> with their <HI>Aurum Pota∣tabile,</HI> their <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Metals,</HI> and <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Projection,</HI> with which they Bubble the Ig∣norant, and blind the Eyes of the more discerning part of Mankind.</P>
<P>I HOPE to God, that you Gentlemen, who have both Honour, Justice and Judg∣ment,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>will put a stop to these Deceits where∣by the People are Cheated with false Medi∣cines, which under the pompous Pretensi∣ons of curing more Effectually, are made a Handle of, to extract Gold and Silver from the Patients Purse: A Reformation of these things would be a great Advantage to all Parties, and who can we expect it from, but your learned Body, who by your Example, and Authority have Power to Reform, and at the same time inform the World what your Opinions are in relation to such cost∣ly Drugs, as <HI>Bezoar,</HI> and whether the good Effects and Virtues thereof are answerable to the Physicians Expectation, and that of the Patient; if not, that you wou'd ingeniously declare this Stone naturally, as brought from <HI>India,</HI> and unsophistieated hath no more Virtue than some of our Foreign Earths, or Domestick Chalks.</P>
<P>IT is pretended by the Advocates for this Stone, that it is a most noble <HI>Alexipharmick,</HI> and is both <HI>Cordial</HI> and <HI>Sudorifick,</HI> tho' it does not appear from the Composition of its Parts, being Gross and Earthy, how it can encrease or otherwise alter the Motion of the Blood, or exhilerate the Spirits, which it seems not to have power to fortifie, and support. If this be so then, let us sub∣mit to the force of Truth, which we find publish'd in the Writings of some of the best Physicians of <HI>Europe,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Guy∣bert</HI> hath accurately quoted; let us submit Opinion, I say to Truth, which is one and
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>the same throughout the World. <HI>Nic Boc∣cangelinus</HI> Physician to the Empress, and a very knowing <HI>Spaniard,</HI> in a Treatise of <HI>Ma∣lignant</HI> and <HI>Pestilential Fevers.</HI> Chap. 17. Con∣demn's the Use of <HI>Bezoar,</HI> thus; some make up Cordial Powders with <HI>Bezoar, Pearl, Coral,</HI> &amp;c. which strangely Deceive them, for, all these things encrease the Obstructions, which encourage the Fever, the Materials being gross, earthy, and Unactive, foul the Stomach, clog the <HI>Lacterals,</HI> and stop the <HI>Mesaraick</HI> Ves∣sels, so that the Blood which is Contaminated with the malignant Vapours, hath not power hereby to refine itself. <HI>Hieron: Ruleus,</HI> a learn∣ed Physician of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> in his Commenta∣ries on the 7th Chap. of the 3d Book of <HI>Celsus</HI> exposes the Cheat after this manner; I own, says he, having often prescrib'd the <HI>Bezoar Stone,</HI> in Malignant, and other Fevers to seve∣ral Persons of Quality, from 8 to 16 Grains, I never could observe any good Effect from it, by any sensible Operation, or Amendment in the Patient; but this we commonly Pre∣scribe to the Rich and Great, by way of Com∣plement, it being very dear: Besides let me Caution you, says he, for there are a great many Counterfeit, or false Stones, which I found by Experience in the last Sick∣ness of Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th, so that out of forty, which were brought me, I cou'd scarce meet with one good one.</P>
<P><HI>MARTIANUS</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Physician in his Commentaries upon <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> says, that the <HI>Bezoar Stone</HI> is nothing else, but a
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>meer Name and Opinion without any Vir∣tue, which he knows to be true upon re∣peated Tryals; <HI>Rodericus a Fonseca,</HI> a cele∣brated Professor at <HI>Padua,</HI> in a Tract of his on <HI>Malignant Fevers,</HI> ingenuously owns, that he never saw any laudable Effect from it, tho' he had frequently us'd it: <HI>Johannes Colle</HI> a learned <HI>Italian,</HI> and Physician to the D. of <HI>Urbino,</HI> in a Book of his call'd <HI>Cosmitor Medi∣cans,</HI> or a large Treatise of the <HI>Bezoar Stone,</HI> makes severe Remarks on those, who boast of the Virtues of <HI>Bezoar,</HI> without any Reason, and on those who use it in all Diseases, like a Stall for all Horses. <HI>Theodorus Angelutius</HI> speaking of the Cure of <HI>Malignant Fevers,</HI> condemns it in these Words; I advise all Phy∣sicians, says he, against the use of this Stone, since it is a Drug that is good for nothing at the best; and all Men of sincerity, who are most worthy of Credit confess it, and I myself solemnly protest, that I never cou'd find the Sick relieved thereby, how easie it is, then for every one to Judge of the Dan∣ger there is in Confiding in so uncertain and frivolous a Medicine, when the Patient la∣bours under a <HI>Malignant Fever,</HI> instead of a better approved, and more successful Re∣medy. <HI>Thomas Minadous,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Fevers,</HI> says thus; I cannot so much, as ad∣mit, or have ever met with any occult Qua∣lity in this <HI>Bezoar Stone,</HI> by which means it could prove serviceable in any Kind of <HI>Fevers;</HI> and therefore believe they are all fabulous Accounts, and old Womens Tales,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>that have been told either by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> or the Moderns; for I have try'd it several Times in several Diseases, without finding any Relief or Advantage from it. <HI>Aloisius Mundella,</HI> in his Experiments on <HI>simple Me∣dicines,</HI> confirms what all the rest have said, whom I have quoted before.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, most excellent and learned Collegues, to say a Word or two about the Drug <HI>Sena,</HI> which enters so many of your well chosen Compositions, and which I have the Vanity to think you have not all met with in the common Treatises of <HI>simple Me∣dicines,</HI> tho' the Subject fell in my way, when I consulted all the Authors I could then come at in compiling my <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Drugs,</HI> from <HI>Pomet, Lemery Tournefort,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Sena,</HI> which <HI>Mesue</HI> from the <HI>Persians,</HI> calls <HI>Abal∣zemer,</HI> is a Plant or Shrub, the Leaves whereof Resemble those of Liquorice, it shoots up and spreads with many small Branches, which are very pliant, the Flowers are yel∣low, with certain Threads or red Streaks underneath, after which shoot forth certain Follicula or Buds closely folded, which hang upon the Plant, by a slender Tail, which is very fine, and naturally flat; these Buds when Ripe easily fall by the force of the Wind, and contain in them a Seed which is of a greenish black Colour, and so like the Stone of a Raisin, that it is hard to know the difference; <HI>Serapion</HI> in his Book of <HI>Simples</HI> says, these Buds are longish, and in form of a Cross, in which the Seed is lodg'd.
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>They are much Deceived, who think that the Tree which <HI>Theophrastus</HI> calls <HI>Colutea</HI> to be our <HI>Sena;</HI> because the <HI>Colutea</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Baguenaudier</HI> bears large <HI>Follicu∣les</HI> or <HI>Buds,</HI> which the Shepherds and Pe∣sants gather to feed their Cattle with, be∣sides, there is a vast difference, in that the <HI>Sena</HI> is an Herb or Plant that lasts but a few Months, and the <HI>Bagnenaudier</HI> is a Tree that continues many Years; notwithstand∣ing which the same Virtues have been ascrib∣ed to the last, as to that of <HI>Sena,</HI> and the Merchant impos'd upon as well as the Drug∣gist in buying the one for the other. <HI>Mesue</HI> says, that the <HI>Sena</HI> hath much more Virtue and Efficacy in the Bud than the Leaf, espe∣cially if of the Dark green Colour a little bitterish, stiptick and astringent in Tast, and gather'd when fresh, for otherwise the Virtue is lost. The white Buds are good for nothing, the green Leaves, better than the white, and the thick ones than the thin, but the Stalks of no Use at all; and this agrees very well with what <HI>Matthiolus</HI> writes in his learned Commentaries on <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> he says indeed, there are two Sorts of these Buds, the one of which is gather'd when dry and fallen from the Plant, which have no Virtue in them, and the other is gathered upon the Plant before it is dry and wither'd, and these are thick Leaves, and full of Sap, being afterwards skillfully dry'd in the Shade.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<P><HI>Manardus,</HI> a Physician of <HI>Ferrara</HI> main∣tains, that the Leaves of the <HI>Sena</HI> have a greater Purgative Quality than the Buds, but then he takes 'em for such as dropt from the Tree ready dry'd; but <HI>Fernelius</HI> who was undoubtedly a more knowing Judge of Medicine, follows <HI>Mesue</HI> and <HI>Matthiolus</HI> in preferring the <HI>Buds</HI> to the <HI>Leaves,</HI> and <HI>Syl∣vius</HI> subscribes to the same Opinion, in his Commentaries upon <HI>Mesue,</HI> Whoever hath a Mind to Use the Buds, must observe this Description, but such as like the Leaves better, must chuse those of the brightest Colour, large and fresh, and free from all Smell, rejecting the pale and dead Colour'd as useless. Our Druggists are often very negligent in mixing all together, without Choice or Distinction. With submission to the more learned, I think we generally un∣der Dose this Medicine in our Compositions, and Preseriptions. <HI>Serapion</HI> orders from a Dram, to two Drams in Powder, and half an Ounce to five Drams in Decoction, <HI>Actu∣arius</HI> only one Dram, and in Decoction half an Ounce; <HI>Fernelius</HI> directs two Drams in Powder, and six in Decoction, but half an Ounce in the Infusion. Your <HI>London Di∣spensatory</HI> prescribes only a Scruple of <HI>Sena</HI> in Powder, and half a Scruple of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> and <HI>Polypody</HI> in seven Drams of <HI>Electuarium Catholicum,</HI> and two Drams only in the De∣coction of <HI>Gereon,</HI> and in the <HI>Lenitive E∣lectuary,</HI> to one Ounce a Dram of <HI>Sena,</HI> with a Scruple of that and <HI>Polypody</HI> in Decoction, in
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>the larger compound Powder of <HI>Sena,</HI> half a Dram, and in the less 24 Grains. The Magisterial Syrup of Apples hath a Dram of <HI>Sena</HI> to an Ounce, but the Purging Syrup only a Scruple infus'd to six Drams. Syrup of Roses with <HI>Sena</HI> hath indeed a Dram to six Drams of the Syrup. I shall conclude this Head, with the form of a Purging Potion of <HI>Sena,</HI> from an eminent Physician of our own, who Practiced upwards of sixty Years.</P>
<P>TAKE of fine <HI>Sena,</HI> cut small six Drams, <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> two Drams, Juice of <HI>Lemons</HI> one Ounce, white Wine four Ounces, in∣fuse six or seven Hours, in a Glass Vessel, then strain, and infuse therein all Night <HI>E∣lectuary</HI> of <HI>Carthamum</HI> three Drams, the Juice of Apples one Ounce: In the Morning cla∣rifie this with the white of an Egg, and to the strain'd Liquor, add Syrup of <HI>Roses,</HI> with <HI>Agarick</HI> six Drams, <HI>Cinamon-Water</HI> two Drams, the zest of half an Orange Peel. Notwithstanding the large Quantity of <HI>Sena;</HI> this is a Medicine of a nice and delicate O∣peration, without giving Gripes or Colick, and yet moves Ten or Twelve times.</P>

<HEAD>A History of the several Compositions that make the <HI>Contrayerva-Stone,</HI> which is the Grand <HI>Antidotarium.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Contrayerva,</HI> or <HI>Drake Root,</HI> is an <HI>Indian</HI> Plant, which some Judge to be of the Nature of <HI>Tormentil.</HI> This was first intro∣duced into <HI>France,</HI> in 1602, and much pre∣scrib'd by the Physicians at <HI>Paris,</HI> in the PIAGUE there at that Time, when it proved of excellent Service. The Root is tuberose and knotty, shooting forth many Hairs or Fibres of a yellowish, or rather brown Colour, which when chew'd gives an Aromatick flavour, and leaves an heat upon the Tongue, tho' no bitterness, or stipticity is observable. This grows in both the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> but most plentifully in the <HI>West,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> and that Part call'd <HI>Ci∣arche</HI> and <HI>Tonsuglar.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> Use it for Sallet; they much covet the Root, which they cut in Pieces, and put under the Soles of their Feet in Winter time: The <HI>Goats</HI> from eating of this Plant, are said to gene∣rate the <HI>Bezoar Stone,</HI> for the <HI>Indians</HI> ob∣serve those <HI>Goats,</HI> of which there are seve∣ral Kinds, of which one is call'd <HI>Bicuqua,</HI> and those which do not feed upon this Plant, never generate any of these Stones; so that according to this Notion, their <HI>Bezoar</HI> seems to be a Concretion of Tartar, or the faecu∣lent Part of the Aliment, form'd from the Digestion of the <HI>Contrayerva Plant.</HI></P>
