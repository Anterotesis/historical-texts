<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BY what can be collected from Au∣thors, the <HI>Lues</HI> has, in all <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Countries, been found an obstinate Distemper. The ill Success of former Practice, one would be apt to attribute to wrong <HI>Hypothesis's,</HI> and the <HI>Pro∣cesses</HI> consequent thereto, did not many Particulars at this Day justifie their <HI>Complaints,</HI> and shew us the same <HI>Difficulties</HI> remain about the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Cure</HI> of this Distemper, as ever. No <HI>Nostrum</HI> as yet, how infallible soever in the Opinion of its Possessor, will answer to all <HI>Symptoms,</HI> or to all <HI>Patients</HI> under the same <HI>Circumstan∣ces;</HI> I have had Tryal of several com∣municated as such, but finding nothing extraordinary in them, I conclude the Art of <HI>Curing</HI> here, as in other Dis∣eases,
<PB REF="3"/>lies as much in the <HI>Managemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as in the <HI>Medicines</HI> themselves, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they be administred in Season, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> adapted to Constitutions; so that to sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Mercury</HI> is the Foundation of <HI>Cure</HI> will be of little import to a Reader o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Subject, unless at the same tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Skill</HI> of using it could be convey'd and this will never be attained in any great Perfection without Practice However, an attention to Rules is no altogether unworthy a Regard, <HI>fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which Reason</HI> I have ventur'd on thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Essay,</HI> wherein I have, as it fell in my way, made a summary of the best Opinions in the <HI>Therapeutick Part,</HI> ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with no Restraint to my own Senti¦ments, which thro' the whole, I have endeavoured to make appear Rational if it shall be thought so by the proper Judges, it may possibly hereafter re∣ceive an Improvement.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOSE who fetch the Origi∣nal of this Distemper no far∣ther back than the Siege of <HI>Naples</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> 1494, thence calling it the <HI>French,</HI> and sometimes the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Disease, must only mean that it received its pre∣sent Name there, that it became more common, or that luckily about that Time some Remedy was found better adapted to its Cure than any before known: For no doubt it reaches in An∣tiquity the First Ages; it being irratio∣nal either to suppose a World drowned for their Sins, Strangers to the Vice that contracts it, or that their Wickedness any more than ours deserved Exemp∣tion. No; Providence, we may safely
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>believe, stamped an immediate Punish∣ment on this, as on all other Intempe∣rance and Sin, <HI>ab Origine,</HI> that the Pains and Sufferings succeeding a vicious Course of Life, might, if nothing else would, restrain us to Vertue, and be both a natural and moral Good to us. We find <HI>Moses</HI> describing a Leprosy, <HI>Levit.</HI> 13 and 14, that corresponds with the Symptoms, and seems to have been a Species of this Distemper; so does the Difficulty of the Cure, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. where it is said, <HI>The botch and scab of Egypt of which thou canst not be healed:</HI> And those many Laws found here relating to a Le∣prosy, would suffer a greater Disappoint∣ment than seems intended, as well from the Obstinacy as infrequency of the Di∣stemper, if applied only to what we now strictly understand by that Term: The same may be said of many Ancient Phy∣sical Authors, who with the like or grea∣ter Plainness have described the Symp∣toms, tho' not under the modern Titles.</P>
<P>In the prosecution of this Subject I pro∣pose to set forth the Nature and Manner of Insection in all those Symptoms com∣monly understood by a Clap, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrhea, Chancre, Phymosis, &amp;c.</HI> and then exhibit a Method of Cure; mentioning
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>the Symptoms occasionally under either Head, as they serve to enlighten each o∣ther: And <HI>First</HI> of the <HI>Gonorrhaea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> is benign or malign: The first sort is an Emission of Humour from the <HI>Glandulae prostatae,</HI> a Weakness only, and commonly proceeding from great Strains, and where the natural Strength has been too far exerted in any sort, whether by Labour or Venereal Plea∣sures; it has its Symptoms as well as Process of Cure very different from the malignant, which at present I shall make the only Subject of my Enquiry, and that under two Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. By shewing how either Sex be∣comes infected. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. A Cure for that Infection.</P>
<P>And 1st. Of the Woman: Her I look on must be primarily and originally Infe∣cted, that is <HI>sine amplexu infecto,</HI> to intro∣duce the being of this Distemper in the World: For let a Man correspond with what Variety he pleases (provided they are sound) he receives no Malignancy, which could it be so with her, I cannot see why we ever should thus unhappily have had its Knowledge; but Experience too fatally contradicting this, is a Con∣viction, that Coition with Numbers has
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>first of all, and probably does still, at some times effect the same, as at other times Communication with an infected Person; and this I shall endeavour to make out in a few Words.</P>
<P>Such who say the promiscuous Mixture of different Sperms excites a Ferment, which in a little Time throws off such an Exspumation as we call a Running, do agree that Numbers (tho' sound) car∣ry Infection, we only differ in the Man∣ner they accomplish it, which I rather suppose to be thus: When the Venereal Appetite is jaded with the too intempe∣rate Efforts of several Men, it will be next to impossible for those Parts to suffer the continued Frictions made there (as common Women do) without excori∣ating and fretting the Membranes of the Vagina; and such Excoriations, how small soever in the beginning, meeting with an ill Habit of Body, together with the natural Incalescence and Moisture of the Parts, will soon degenerate to an Ul∣cer; which Ulcer will be the Distemper: And perhaps herein lies the Difference be∣tween a <HI>Fluor Albus</HI> and <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> (when thus contracted) that the one is a Weak∣ness from too frequent Irritations made there, and the other besides that extrinsi∣cal
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>Accident, has an ill Habit of Body joined, that induces Intemperies.</P>
<P>What I think gives Credit to this Opi∣nion is the Customs of the Jewish, Maho∣metan, and many other Countries, who allow a Plurality of Wives, and an unli∣mited Number of Concubines, restrain∣ing their Sex at the same time to one: For this, tho' an inferiour Motive of the Law, argues the World to have previous∣ly experienced such a Liberty in them more destructive of Health and a sound Constitution than in us. Among other Creatures there is an Instinct answering such a Purpose of the Law whereby the Females are <HI>provoked only at certain Sea∣sons to Propagation,</HI> and <HI>abstain after Con∣ception;</HI> Nature <HI>intimating by it a Lesson of Chastity to the Fair; that it should be their</HI> peculiar <HI>as well as most</HI> ornamental <HI>Vertue.</HI></P>
<P>Against it, I can form to my self only two Objections: First, That it may be alleged the Activity of some Men this Way, might prejudice a weak Woman the same as a Number: And Secondly, it may be asked how an Ulcer, <HI>in Va∣gina,</HI> can acquire Malignity enough to communicate Infection on Coition, when the greatest Degree of Virulen∣cy
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>in another Ulcer produces no such Effect?</P>
<P>But, to these it may be answered, That the Strength and Activity of any two in Health will seldom be found so dispro∣portionate as to become hurtful, when it is; the Disorder ensuing can be no more than a <HI>Fluor Albus,</HI> or a Weak∣ness without Malignity. And as to the other; why an Ulcer here should sooner impart its Mischief than any other? Is, that the Parts concerned are in all Respects more commodious for giving and receiving any Injury, and that the Heat raised and excited by Lust gives a Force and Activity to the Salts gene∣rated under the Corruption; whereas a∣ny other Ulcer, tho' never so virulent, cannot emit Effluvia's in such Force or Numbers, nor to Parts so susceptible of their Reception; but if they had those Advantages, it is likely their Effects would be equal, many ill Consequences following from an Ulcer with Virulency in any Part incautiously dry'd up.</P>
<P>That Lust also is a very necessary Ad∣junct for communicating Infection, and giving Force to those virulent Miasms that are as it were darted by it from her, we judge by that particular Power and
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>Influence, Imagination is found to have in the Commotion of these Parts: In this Case it is so much, that many infe∣cted Women avoid hurting their Hus∣bands principally on the Moderation and Coolness of their Enjoyments, whereas a Stranger inciting more intense and vi∣gorous Desires as seldom escapes. The same may be said where two or three, with weaker or stronger Inclinations, lie with one and the same infected Wo∣man, that one perhaps shall be catch'd, and the others come off unhurt, chiefly as the Fancy on either side is brisk and lively, inclin'd or disinclin'd.</P>
<P>Venereal Contact seems of such Ne∣cessity for communicating Infection, that with me it is a very unlikely thing for Venereal Matter ever to do it without, those who have asserted the contrary of this have done it in such improbable In∣stances, which whoever can assent to, will be very unreasonable if they deny their Acquiescence in what I have ad∣vanced of Numbers. For Instance:</P>
<P>The <HI>Practical Scheme</HI> (Page 4.) says, It is not always necessary a Woman be clapp'd to give it a Man, but that he may take off all the virulent Matter left in the Passage by a preceding Gallant,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>and she remain perfectly well; or that she may give it him by only taking the corrupted Matter from her Body in her Hand and wetting his Privities.</P>
<P>And others relate its highest Degene∣racy, or a Pox, to be Contagious by wearing the Clothes, Lying, or Cohabi∣ting with an infected Person; especially if we suppose it of that Stage of the Di∣stemper wherein the Body becomes over∣spread with Cutaneous Eruptions and Blotches.</P>
<P>There are but Two Ways in this latter Case (for the former I have no Notion of) whereby Contagion can be suppo∣sed to pass, and that is by their throwing off a greater Quantity of noxious and virulent Effluvia, able to contaminate where they reach, or else, (like what is related in the Philosophical Transactions concerning Contagion in the Itch) <HI>A∣nimalculae,</HI> are bred in those Globules, dispersed about the Skin, which making their Way through, shift from Place to Place, and so carry Infection, they liv∣ing (says the Relation) two or three Days when from the Body.</P>
<P>But how well these <HI>Assignata</HI> may re∣solve other contagious Distempers, they will here be found but light in the Bal∣lance,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>Fact baffles Philosophy, and if all those who have suffered this Way are like what have fallen to my Share, there is not one who could stand by any other Pretence than Coition: Whence we ought to account the Distemper a Mark of Divine Displeasure, and a present bodily Correction for our Sin, that the Sense of our own Interest, might work on us, and bring us back to Temperance and Vertue.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How a Man becomes infected.</HEAD>
<P>WOmen we have adjudged some∣times to become infected by the Admission of Numbers, tho' sound and healthful; but a Man cannot by the same Means, because among other Rea∣sons there is this invincible one, That Nature is not able to support the Repeti∣tions of those Acts to such a Multiplicity, or in such Measure as with her who is passive; but could that be, I believe also he might so contract it: Insatiable and impotent Efforts, or too painful Enjoy∣ments through the Straitness of the <HI>Vagina,</HI> frequently discovers something like this, in what we call <HI>simple Gonor∣rhaea's</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>and <HI>Christallins,</HI> which perhaps Time and an ill Habit would change, and make to become virulent, did not Pain or the Debility of Nature prevent a further Use of the Cause that first produced them, and hinder our Actions from keeping Pace with the Viciousness of our Wills and Inclinations. For this Reason therefore Venereal Symptoms thus contracted, never settle or terminate in a Pox; and I am apt to think all Ma∣lignity that does so to him, or is contagi∣ous, <HI>Must always be from an infected Person, and always by Coition:</HI> For a clearer Un∣derstanding of which, and <HI>the Manner of Communication,</HI> I shall <HI>Cite</HI> Two or Three <HI>Celebrated Opinions about it,</HI> and then <HI>sub∣scribe my own.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> says, <HI>It's Conveyance is by the Elasticity of the Air, thrusting the Morbifick Matter into the Excretory Ducts of the Pro∣slatae, which are empty on Coition; and that a simple</HI> Gonorrhaea <HI>is nothing, but a Corro∣sion of the Spongious Borders of those Vessels terminating in the Urethra.</HI></P>
<P>Some think, <HI>a Gonorrhaea to be the Effect of a Fermentation made between the Infectious Liquor, and that of the</HI> Prostatae, <HI>and so with∣out Corrosion an Efflux thrown off like Yest from Beer.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<P>Lastly, Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> supposes <HI>a Gonor∣rhaea to be the encrcase of that Liquor that is discharged by the Excretory Glands of the U∣rethra, and done by the Venereal Stimulus, in the same manner as</HI> Cantharides <HI>apply'd would do; the Quantity of Matter discharg'd being in proportion to the Stimulating Force they are affected with: And this</HI> Stimulus (he says) <HI>encreasing its Acrimony, does in Process of time, make Ulcers in the</HI> Urethra. This he farther opposes to Dr. <HI>Keil</HI>'s Opi∣nion, by saying, the <HI>Urethra</HI> will admit very little, and that there is no <HI>Muscle, Membrane,</HI> or <HI>Machine</HI> alleged to help it for ward.</P>
<P>But these Opinions, besides their Op∣position to one another, are deficient in carrying their Aim singly to a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> without any Attempt at the Cause of a <HI>Chancre, Chordee,</HI> or <HI>Phymosis,</HI> which Men often become infected with, without a <HI>Gonorrhaea:</HI> I shall therefore begin my Enquiry here, being assured that they at least want another and different Ex∣plication, which perhaps when found, will facilitate also our Search in a <HI>Go∣norrhaea;</HI> and if I am right in my Con∣jecture, They arise from the Strength, Activity, and Solidity of the Salts hid with the Corruption, which being di∣spersed
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>about the <HI>Vagina,</HI> are volatiliz'd and made fitter for Communication by the Heat of Lust, and received by the enlarged Pores of the <HI>Penis,</HI> where, by their Pointedness, they shortly effect an Erosion.</P>
<P>The manner of this Imbibing or Suc∣tion on the Man's side, is not absurdly ac∣counted for by the general Relaxation that attends all sensual Pleasures, of which Coition is perhaps the greatest: Now, as it most exquisitely affects us, the Parts are relaxed and made more easily susceptible of any Venom to be trans∣mitted, and that again from her becomes enabled to insinuate and escape through the Pores by the Pungency of their Salts, and Power they are darted with; and if the Degree of Relaxation in any Part be in Proportion to the Pleasure, (as in the agreeable Objects of any other Sense, it is, where tho' some Degree of it re∣sults to the whole Man, yet something remains peculiar to the Sense of which it is an Object) then the Instruments of Generation, by being most relaxed, will be also most fitted on that Account for the Reception of morbifick Matter.</P>
<P>Hence the Genital Parts should always suffer first, and amorous Men soonest.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<P>And if virulent Matter, thus externally lodged, can act like Cantharides, and produce a <HI>Chancre, Chordee,</HI> or <HI>Phymosis,</HI> then I believe we may also, without any repugnancy to Reason, think this out∣ward Application of it in Coition suffi∣cient to produce a <HI>Gonorrhaea:</HI> The Diffi∣culty against it being only how this Taint can be transmitted hence to the <HI>Prostatae,</HI> which will not be so hard to Imagine, if we consider what has been already said of the Power impelling, and the Aptitude to receive. We find all Parts of the Body Porous, and by many Experiments re∣ceptive of any proper Matter incumbent on them, conveying and mixing a Por∣tion with the Humours of the Body, as in Bathing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In all Translations of Tumours, whe∣ther by Revulsion or Derivation, this Sympathy and Communication of Parts is evident, and particularly in the present Case, where, on an improper handling, the Virulency will revert into the Blood, and produce all the Symptoms of a <HI>Pox,</HI> and indeed all outward Applications to any Malady deeper than the Skin (without this) would be impertinent: Why then should it be thought so extra∣ordinary for infectious Matter arm'd with
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>other Properties than bare Fluidity, to affect these Glandules at so small a Di∣stance? Since it must be acknowledged the several Parts of a Member have a much easier Communication with them∣selves than with the whole, as we often see in the quick and ready Translation of a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> to the Groin and Testi∣cles, <HI>&amp; Vice Versa.</HI></P>
<P>The only remaining Objection to this Transmission by the Pores is, that the greatest Corrosions at the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Prae∣putium</HI> are rarely attended with a <HI>Gonor∣rhaea,</HI> whereas were such Corrosions thus effected, as it would be an Argument of a stronger Infection, and the Corrosive∣ness of that Venereal Matter to be grea∣ter, it should as seldom miss. This seems to be from the Contraction, Pains and Swelling that attend those Ulcers, whereby the Passages to the <HI>Prostatae</HI> are straitned and obstructed; but a slighter Degree, creating no such Impediments, easily passes, and is sussicient to propel that Humour from the Glands which in a less Proportion is their Nature and Office. From hence we may learn a <HI>Go∣norrhaea</HI> to be the mildest Species of In∣fection.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<P>If any one should yet object and think the <HI>Mucous Glands</HI> of the <HI>Urethra</HI> more easily reached than the <HI>Prostatae,</HI> and so to be the <HI>Seat</HI> of a <HI>Gonorrhaea:</HI> I shall no further insist, but only remark to the Favourers of such an Opinion, That a Running is not produced by an Ulce∣ration or Corrosion of the <HI>Ostiolae</HI> of the Glands terminating there, for such would be an irreparable Loss, and is the very Cause of some <HI>Gleets,</HI> being incu∣rable; but it is rather from the Constitu∣ting Vessels of those Glands being rendred weak and flaccid, that were before vi∣grous and elastick, parting easily (for that reason) with their Contents.</P>
<P>From the whole of this Explication we may see a Reason for that Custom in many Foreign Countries of washing the Privities well after <HI>Coition,</HI> (to wit) that they find it preventive of <HI>Infection,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Circumcision</HI> was not <HI>instituted</HI> by that renowned Law-giver <HI>Moses,</HI> or the Impostor <HI>Mahomet,</HI> nor practised by Ancienter Nations, without a View to the Cleanliness of this Part, and Preven∣tion of foul and loathsome Distempers.</P>
<P>Those who account for a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> thus, do not say a <HI>Disuria</HI> is from an <HI>Exco∣riation in the Urethra,</HI> but that the Sharp∣ness
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>of the Infection thinning and car∣rying off the <HI>Mucus</HI> from the Membrane that lines it, is made more sensible of the <HI>pungent Salts</HI> of <HI>Urine</HI> passing through; which the would confirm by the Nature of <HI>Patients Complaints,</HI> who don't speak of the <HI>Heat of Water</HI> as a <HI>Pain confin'd to one particular Spot of the Passage,</HI> but diffused, and seems an equal <HI>Vellication of the whole Membrane.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the second and most useful Part,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>The Cure of this Distemper:</HI> And First its <HI>Description.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>AVirulent Gonorrhaea</HI> or <HI>CLAP,</HI> is <HI>the Emission of infectious Matter from the corroded Glandulae Prostatae,</HI> or <HI>those of the Urethra,</HI> accompanied with a DISURIA; or in other Words, <HI>the involuntary Flowing of Matter through the Urethra,</HI> with <HI>Pain, Inflammation</HI> and <HI>Heat of Urine;</HI> These are its <HI>Patho∣gnomick Signs,</HI> and the Degree they are in, with Respect to Consistence and Colour in the <HI>Running</HI> (as <HI>Yellow, Green,</HI> or the like) or <HI>Pain in Water,</HI> are what we may take the Measure of Virulency from, and will be found more or less in different
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>Subjects, according to the Malignity of the infected Person, and Constitution of the Receiver.</P>
<P>A <HI>Disuria</HI> is a Necessary Consequence of the <HI>Running,</HI> it being a Pain from the <HI>Acriminious Salts</HI> of Urine wasting thro' the Parts which that has excoriated.</P>
<P>The Cure I shall lay down under these two Intentions:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> To conquer and carry off the Malignancy, and</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To heal and strengthen the Debilitated Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> only is able to answer our first Intention, and effectually to subdue the Poison of this Distemper: The Reason why it has a Power beyond other Medi∣cines for this purpose, is its <HI>Gravity,</HI> and because its constituent Parts are extreme small, smooth and sphaerical: The latter Qualification fits them for an admittance into the smallest Passages (even those al∣most indiscernible ones of the Glands) and its weight breaks all Coagulations, and fits the Morbifick Matter for natural Se∣cretions. And whatever slights some may put on this common Road of proceeding; yet, till better convinced in the Vertues of the several applauded <HI>Specificks</HI> that have appeared abroad in the World, I
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>take leave to defend it, as a <HI>Safe Practice:</HI> For altho' a tedious, or an ill Cure, may now and then happen, it is not justly so much a Charge on the Medicine, as the Method; when we leave off too soon, or continue it with Purges too long, a Practice equally Mischievous. But more of this by and by.</P>
<P>I am surprized, that every body, by their Practice, should allow <HI>Mercury</HI> to be the only Foundation and Retreat for Cure, in the last and stubbornest Stage of this Distemper, a <HI>Pox,</HI> and yet deny its Ver∣tues in a milder Season. It must be con∣fessed, there are too often seen many ill Effects from this Mineral; and on a seri∣ous Reflection, I cannot but think, most of those deplorable Objects found in Hospitals, or elsewhere, whose ruined Constitutions are attributed to the <HI>Lues,</HI> to be with more Truth and Justice, ascri∣bed to <HI>Mercury;</HI> but then this is not the <HI>Use,</HI> but <HI>Abuse</HI> of it; an unskilful Ma∣nagement often precipitating Patients, (and that in a short time) into such mise∣rable Circumstances, as the Distemper, left to it self, could not in Years (if ever) have produc'd: From this Prepossession many take a handle to recommend their
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>infallible <HI>Nostrums,</HI> which when good for any thing still have this for their Basis.</P>
<P>The Ingenuity of making <HI>Mercury Spe∣cifical,</HI> will lie in the Measure and Manner of Administration; that it suit such De∣grees of Infection, and such Constituti∣ons; a Point wherein one Man will excel another, according to their different Ca∣pacities, and Opportunities of Experi∣ment: All other ways are supported by nothing but a <HI>Brass Front.</HI> The many successless Attempts of those who publick∣ly invite Men to <HI>Safe and Speedy Cures,</HI> have pretty well exposed their Credit; and People see it to be nothing but a Compe∣tition in Cunning, who shall betray with most success, without the least Candour, or regard to the Promises they make: nor is it a small Disparagement to <HI>Arcana</HI>'s here, that they are generally lodg'd with the Illiterate. I shall further strengthen this Argument for <HI>Mercury,</HI> in Opposition to other Specificks, by a short Excursion on the <HI>Practical Scheme;</HI> because it has made the loudest Noise of late, and has been Famous, if not for attracting Poi∣son, yet for attracting the Pence, <HI>Popu∣lus vult decipi.</HI></P>
<P>A Compounded Medicine, as is the <HI>Practical Scheme</HI>'s, tho' it should seldom
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>miss the Ends it is giv'n for, and so be said to act Electively, yet by being Com∣pounded, is properly and significatively ranked under the Name of an <HI>Arcanum;</HI> which the Elder Brethren have chosen with Judgment, the Term of <HI>Specifick</HI> be∣ing usually apply'd to single Natural Bo∣dies, such as he has mention'd (<HI>p.</HI> 12.) And tho' they may be diversly mix'd for conveying and using them with advan∣tage, yet the Term is retained singly to that Body which is said to be <HI>Specifical:</HI> As for instance, in the <HI>Cortex;</HI> whatever Form or Vehicle we give it in, there is nothing but it self has any Claim to the Title: Therefore making the Vertue of his Composition to be the <HI>Joynt Force and Result of all,</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 15.) is not only a Misap∣plication of it, but a Confession, that this <HI>Specificality</HI> lieth in none of them singly; or if it does, 'tis as yet a hidden thing to him. For he goes on, and tells ye (<HI>p.</HI> 12.13, 16. <HI>&amp; Certificat. p.</HI> 22.) <HI>Their United Force, like a Loadstone, draws the Contagi∣on to it, and exactly hits the different Consti∣tutions of any Age, and that from the Re∣cency of the Distemper, to their being in a de∣plorable State.</HI> And for further Proofs of these Absurdities, he says (<HI>p.</HI> 14.) <HI>Persons after having taken the Specifick, will void
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>large quantities of nasty corrupted stinking Water, of such an unsufferable Stench, they will not be able to bear the smell; and give but any Dog (that will take it) a Quart of this Urine, and he will in a little time break out with Pocky Sores; recoverable again with so small a Dose of the Specifick as con∣tains to the bigness of a Pea, whsch will dis∣charge it in such stinking corrupted Urine, as the Person's was who made it.</HI> A plain Con∣fession it was the Effect of the Medicine, yet serves him for a Conviction of the great Power of this Remedy: And in∣deed, granting the Relations true, it must be allow'd (as was the <HI>Gamboge</HI> the poor <HI>Weavers</HI> took) to be of <HI>Stupendious Efficacy</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 14.)</P>
<P>I shall not wrong this Gentleman, I believe, in supposing his <HI>Scheme</HI> to be (like other shorter <HI>Schemes</HI> that are daily thrust into our Hands) for drawing in of Customers; he differs only in having al∣ter'd their Concise way of Writing, and recommending in many Words what they have done Compendiously. <HI>The ad∣mirable Vertues of their Incomparable Nover∣failing Anti-venereal PILL.</HI> Through a great part of his Book he insinuates to his Readers such astonishing Performan∣ces from the <HI>Specifick,</HI> as come but little
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>short of Infallibility: <HI>It is a Cure</HI> (says he) (<HI>p.</HI> 21.) <HI>for Nineteen in Twenty.</HI> A very small Exception, yet serves a double End, being both <HI>Good News to the Afflicted (Title of a Quack Bill)</HI> and a Salvo for Mis∣carriages: For should the Reverse of this be, and the Uncur'd 19 in 20, they might every one singly lament themselves and he with them as the unhappy excep∣ted Person, and their Certificates must be wanting, because like his Cures, it would not be allowable to publish their Names and Abodes. And indeed, he that gives out a Bill of Promises on this Head, is much more safe from Detection and Re∣proach than any other; because, to con∣test the thing is taking a publick Shame, and may be one Reason the Infallibility of a Cure is oftner and more confidently asserted here than in any other Case. The Certificates publish'd on these Occasions, (to confirm the Unbelieving) are few e∣nough to be a concerted Cheat; and if real, is only a cunning in common with the Fraternity.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Avery</HI>'s Case (poor Gentlewoman) (<HI>p.</HI> 22. <HI>the Certificate</HI>) may be granted ve∣ry bad, and the Cure as Extraordinary; yet to shew the World something of a Pa∣rallel, and that others Parts of it do not want for Wonders, I refer to the follow∣ing Story, transcrib'd from the Patient's own Lips; abbreviated and drawn into a Certificate, will run thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I T. H. <HI>of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> having been for many Months afflicted with a Swelling in my Belly, Gripings, great Pains in my Limbs, and in a weak and languishing Condition, for which I had been a long while under the Pre∣scriptions of several eminent Physicians, but to such purpose, that I was reduced even to Death's Door: At last, in a Despondency of Mind, I betook my self to little Dr.</HI> Le F ... <HI>at the upper end of</HI> Three C...Alley: <HI>On examining my Case, and what had been done for it, he shook his Head and said,</HI> His Bre∣thren had very much mistook the Illness, or else they would not have bottom'd their Hopes on Medicine Internal or External; That the Planets were more concern'd in this Affair, and had <Q><HI>"United their selectest Influences against me"</HI></Q>: He bid me be cheery and confident in him, and only
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>lend him my Servant next Morning at Three o' Clock, with some of my Urine, to <HI>Epping Forest. Knowing his Wisdom, I shew'd all the Tokens of a glad Compliance my weak State would permit, and begg'd him, as a Christian, to use his utmost Skill for my Re∣covery. He promis'd he would; and accord∣ingly took my Man with him as appointed. At his Return he told me My Business was done: That I should have only one severe Fit of Gripes more, but be perfectly recover'd in a Week. After the Doctor had taken his Leave, my Curiosity led me to enquire of</HI> John, <HI>what had been done at the Forest, and he told me, all he knew was, that he had seen the Doctor bore several Holes in an old Oak, put my Water in them, and then fill'd them up with Trunnels again, muttering withal some Words inwardly which he could not un∣derstand. My Heart ak'd for the Success of this Mystical way of Application a whole day; but praised be God his Words had Truth to a Tittle: I had next day, or next but one, the expected Fit; and before the expiration of a Week (as he had foretold) walked about to Admiration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What may compleat the Author's Prai∣ses, and recommend the Cure to the Pub∣lick, is his taking but Twelve Guineas for

<P>But to return from this Digression, I begin the Cure with a strict Regu∣lation in Living, particularly an Absti∣nence from spirituous Liquor and salt Food, and prescribe directly a <HI>mercurial Bolus.</HI></P>

<P><HI>PURGES</HI> are given after <HI>Mercurials</HI> (I believe) not so much from a Suppositi∣on
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>that their Vertues immediately reach the Part affected, and subdue the Poison directly, as from a distant View of alter∣ing the Habit of Body, and carrying off those vicious Humours that would else probably take their Course that way, and heighten the Fury: This Opinion is foun∣ded in Practice; where nothing is com∣moner than from two Men infected by the same Woman, to see the one cur'd in a few Days, when the other perhaps re∣quires Months; which can be from no∣thing sooner than their different Habits.</P>
<P><HI>Purges</HI> are design'd likewise to prevent any ill Effect from too great a quantity of <HI>Mercury</HI> remaining at once in the Body.</P>
<P>This may suffice for their Defence in general. There remains another mate∣rial Consideration in the Use of them, and that respects the frequency of their Repe∣tition. And rightly to understand a Pro∣portion in this, we are to consider, that as the Malignancy of a <HI>Gonorrhea,</HI> Nature her self, in good Constitutions, would run off in a due Quantity of time; and that our Administrations are but her Assistants thereto: The Faults may be equal, in leaving them off too soon, or continuing them too long; by the former the Infe∣ction is not conquer'd, and by the latter
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>the Constitution is enervated, and Na∣ture's Efforts weakned instead of being assisted: In consequence of this I repeat the <HI>Mercurial Bolus,</HI> and purge no oftner than Reason tells me their Strength will admit, without a <HI>Hypercatharsis,</HI> Fainting or Loathings (which is with some every other Day, with others twice a Week, or less;) and in the Intermissions give largely of the following <HI>Apozems</HI> or <HI>Emulsions.</HI></P>

<P>As these, or other Forms of <HI>Diureticks,</HI> are suppos'd to ease the Heat of Water by increasing the Quantity, and so diluting the Salts; so, to this end such an Inje∣ction may be serviceable also as is soft, and can leave something of a Muci∣laginous Substance to lubricate and de∣fend the <HI>Urethra.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
<P><HI>Solvatur G. Tragacanth. vel Arab. vel Ich∣thiocol. in sero. Lactis, Colatura tepide injic.</HI></P>
<P>While we are continuing the use of these, it will be proper to weigh with our selves, what are the Signs of our first In∣tention being answer'd, and sufficiently authorize us to leave them off: For there is no doubt a Period, which the Skilful discern, wherein a Change for Healing Balsamick Medicines is necessary and required, and which as we come short off, or exceed, may be either way pernicious: For, First, If (while the Signs of Malignancy abide) too sudden a Check be given to the Running, either by the unseasonable use of Astringents, or too quick and strong purging in the be∣ginning, which turns to the same; then it will either revert and taint the whole Mass of Blood, or produce by a nearer Translation acute Pain, Tumour, and Inflammation of the Groin or Testicles; which may prove of as unhappy Conse∣quence; particularly in the last the Pains are agonizing, and attended with <HI>Fe∣ver, Syncope</HI> and <HI>Nausea,</HI> and the Mem∣brane wanting Fat, never without dan∣ger of Corruption and Gangrene.</P>
<P>Again: If, on the other side, the pro∣per Season is miss'd of doing it, and there
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>is too cautious and long an adherence to <HI>Mercurials,</HI> or irritating Medicines, whe∣ther Catharticks or Diureticks, the Run∣ning goes on without end, and at last brings an irrecoverable Laxity on the Parts, converting a <HI>Venereal</HI> to a troublesom <HI>Seminal Gleet.</HI> To avoid these Extremes, I take the proper In∣dications for such an Alteration to be Absence of Pain and Soreness about the Groin and Testicles, When the Distention of the Yard is gone off, When the Heat of Urine is considerably abated, and when the Running is of thick and equal Consi∣stence, chang'd in Colour and lessen'd in Quantity; for as the contrary of these are what constitutes its Virulency, so their Remission must be Signs of Amendment, and a proper <HI>Stadium</HI> for changing the Method. It is not to be expected a Run∣ning should ever so intirely change as not to leave a Stain, which some do sillily imagine; no, it will be sufficient that there are considerable Alterations in the Respects abovemention'd; the better those appear, indeed, the safer shall we be in stopping it; and let the remaining Matter revert where it will (separate from Signs of Malignancy) it can be of no more hurt, than the drying of an Issue, or o∣ther simple or common Ulcer.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
<P>The second Intention is, to dry up the Running, and heal and strengthen the debilitated Parts. The former part of this Intention I have compass'd sometimes (in <HI>Athletick</HI> Constitutions) by a single quick Purge; which shows, that a <HI>Ca∣thartick,</HI> without any other Property than its stimulating Power increas'd, will turn Astringent, and dry up the Liquor of the Glands: But as Circumstances will pre∣vent this from being the constant Effect of it, and that (like Mr. <HI>Avery</HI>'s Case) it will be far from happening every Day, I shall select some of those Preparations I've most successfully experienced, and range them in their Order of Healing and As∣tringency, to sort with the better or worse appearance of the Indications above; and doubt not but a due Observance to the Season of their Administration, together with a thick glutinous Diet (which under this Intention should always be directed) will make them answer as effectually with others.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>THE other Symptoms of <HI>Virulency</HI> which Denominate a Person Clapp'd, and that as well without as with a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> are the <HI>Chordee, Phymosis; Paraphymosis, Chancre</HI> and <HI>Bubo.</HI> These I chuse to speak of separately in their Cures, because they require (besides an Internal use of <HI>Mercurials</HI>) Local Applications.</P>
<P>A <HI>Chordee</HI> is a painful Contraction of the <HI>Fraenum</HI> in Erection, caused from an Inflammation of that Membrane, which on that accounr being thicker, is conse∣quently shorter, and must excite a Pain when the Erection of the <HI>Penis</HI> stretches it.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> distinguishes another Chor∣ding Pain, arising from a Sore or Ulcer in the <HI>Urethra,</HI> as often as it comes to be compress'd by an Erection of the <HI>Penis,</HI> and infers from it, how far within the <HI>U∣rethra</HI> the Seat of a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> is: But a∣gainst this I object,</P>
<P>That if an inflated <HI>Penis</HI> can so pain∣fully compress this Ulcer on all sides, why
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>should not a greater Compression with the Hand do it without Erection.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> be an Ulcer in the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and the Chording Pain a Com∣pression on that Ulcer, then they must be inseparable Companions, and no <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> could be without it.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I have known the <HI>Chordee</HI> often continue after a Running has been stopp'd, which by this Allegation could not be true; supposing (as we reasonably may) that where there is no Running there is no Ulcer: The proper local Remedies to it are <HI>Fotus's</HI> of Milk wherein Lilly, Elder, or Marshmallow-Root has been boiled, and a little <HI>Sacchar. Saturn.</HI> added, or in their stead the <HI>Cataplasma Resolvens.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Phymosis,</HI> is when the <HI>Praeputium</HI> is dif∣ficult to bring backward: A <HI>Paraphymosis,</HI> when it choaks at the Neck of the <HI>Penis,</HI> and will not without pain or trouble be brought forward over the <HI>Glans:</HI> In some these are Natural Difficulties; but here, the effect of Tumour and Inflammation, as those are again of <HI>Shankers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shankers</HI> are Venereal Ulcers on the <HI>Glans Praeputium,</HI> or <HI>Fraenum:</HI> They are, with the <HI>Phymosis</HI> (as was observed in the begin∣ning) occasioned when the Venereal Taint is lodged here, and does by its sharp Qua∣lities, both coagulate those Liquors that lu∣bricate
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>the Glands, and corrode the Fibres constituting them: The latter are <HI>Shankers,</HI> the former <HI>Phymosis;</HI> for a <HI>Phymosis</HI> is no∣thing but the effecting a Tumour on the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Praeputium</HI> at the same time.</P>

<P>A Malign, or Venereal <HI>Bubo</HI> is dangerous to repel, and should, from the beginning, be assisted to Suppuration by Emplasticks, Cataplasms, Cupping, and the like: An Intention that will be found difficultly to suc∣ceed in most, and when compassed, without great care, will turn fistulous.</P>
<P>I have run over this Section with little more than placing some proper Prescripti∣ons under the several Heads of <HI>Chancre, Phy∣mosis, &amp;c.</HI> avoiding any nicer Disquisition in the choice of them, or Season of their use, not because they are intirely void of Effica∣cy, but because I am satisfy'd neither they, or any other <HI>Arcana</HI> will alone answer the purpose: They are all short of the Eu∣logiums bestow'd on them; and if not im∣pertinent to the Ends proposed, are yet ve∣xatious and tedious. And since they are so, and have a greater tendency to a <HI>Pox</HI> than a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> its expedient, and I think a very good Practice, presently to resort to <HI>Turbith</HI> for a Revulsion, or else by some other equivalent <HI>Merourials</HI> to procure a Spitting; there is nothing these Symptoms better or sooner submit to; for as the Mouth grows sore, there follows a mi∣tigation, the Matter is diverted, the <HI>Shankers</HI> heal, and the Parts suddenly regain their pri∣stine Form and Tension.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
<P>Eight or ten Days continuance in a mo∣derate Salivation will ordinarily suffice to vanquish them; but if the Distemper proves more deeply rooted, requiring one of strict∣er Confinement and Regimen, take the fol∣lowing Rules.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Symptons of the <HI>Pox</HI> are cuticu∣lar Eruptions, Blotches, Ulcers in the Throat and Palate, Nocturnal Pains of the Head, Shoulders and Shins, <HI>Caries,</HI> Night-Sweats, <HI>Alopecia's,</HI> falling off of the Nails, <HI>Gummas,</HI> Nodes, <HI>Talpas,</HI> Consum∣ption and <HI>Marasmus.</HI></P>
<P>How a Clap comes to end in such contu∣macious and intractable Symptoms, may be partly attributed to the Malignancy of the Original Infection, partly to the Pre∣disposition, or ill Habit, whereby the Blood becomes more easily receptive of that Ve∣nom, but most often to an irregular Ma∣nagement of Cure, and use of <HI>Specificks:</HI> It exceeds my Design, as well as Capacity, to unriddle further the Nature of this Ve∣nom, in its several Appearances under that general Denomination of a <HI>Pox;</HI> hav∣ing only intended here the short <HI>History of
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>a Salivation,</HI> by which the most of them are effectually to be removed.</P>
<P>A <HI>Salivation</HI> is dangerously undertaken with Aged People, with such as are lean, or dejected thro' Trouble or Misfortunes, or much emaciated; but especially with those whose Lungs are any way distemper'd, that are Hectical, Phthy∣sical and Consumptive, because, as this Ha∣bit is acquired by the Glandulous Secretions being increas'd, <HI>Mercury</HI> pejorates the Mis∣chief, and the more so, if such Indisposition has proceeded from a former ill use of it. Dr. <HI>Moulin</HI> assures us from Experiments, that <HI>Mercury</HI> is very prejudicial to the Lungs, because they want that strong brisk Motion the Muscles have in other Parts, and by their lax and spongy Texture are extreme∣ly unfit for clearing themselves of so trou∣blesome a Guest: This <HI>(says he)</HI> we daily see from Persons often flux'd; who are af∣terwards observ'd to die of Consumptions, that will not give way to any Course of Me∣dicine: To which likewise agrees many in∣terspersed Places in Mr. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Collection of <HI>BAWDY Letters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> ordinarily Operates by a Flux thro' the Salival Glands, and by the parvity of its compounding Parts has a peculiar Ap∣titude thereto: The Benefits from it seem as much from the uninterrupted
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>Continuance of its Operation, as any Spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦fick Vertue in the <HI>Mercury;</HI> for the Blood has leisure by such a length of time as a <HI>Sa∣livation</HI> takes up, to separate its noxious and incongruous Parts, which are daily washed and spewed out by the thin Liquors conti∣nually taken, and consequently the Remain∣der, after such a Defaecation, becomes more Homogeneous.</P>
<P>A <HI>Salivation</HI> is raised by <HI>Mercurials</HI> and that either Externally or Internally used; Two or three Purges always precede as preparative, and after that if we intend it by Unction, make up the following Ointment, and draw on a pair of Gloves and Stockings after the use of it, to keep the Linen and Bedcloaths clean.</P>
<P>℞ <HI>Argent. Vivum</HI> ℥iv. <HI>Axuug.

<PB N="39" REF="42"/>repeat it, and help forward with a Bolus of <HI>Turbith.</HI></P>
<P>This way by Unction I preser, especially in weak Bodies, the other more certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ausing <HI>Nausea,</HI> Vomiting, Loosness, Faint∣ness, and the like Accidents that interrupt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Regular Course of Proceeding, and give great uneasiness to a Patient: But since Un∣stion has also its Faults, and is Offensive by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Smell and nastying the Cloths; since ma∣ny also differ from me in this Preference, and give it to <HI>Mercurials,</HI> internally admi∣nistred; and lastly, since the Rules to pre∣vent those Symptoms mentioned, will re∣quire more Attention in the Internal than External use of <HI>Mercury:</HI> I shall chuse to fi∣nish the Course in that Method, and for easier Apprehension, divide the Flux into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beginning, a State, and a Declension.</P>
<P>In the Beginning, or First Attempts to raise a Flux, the only thing to be fear'd and guarded against, is a <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> which di∣verts the Operation of the <HI>Mercury</HI> from the Salival Glands: This we must take notice is prevented, or abates and goes off, in pro∣portion as we can procure a Soreness in the Mouth and Jaws, and increase the Drib∣ling; and therefore a very great Stress lies in the Manner and Method, as well as in the Administrations themselves, and in a good ordering the Patient as to Diet and Confinement.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We have said two or three Purge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are to precede: And the Reason of this is that besides preparing the Body for succeed∣ing <HI>Mercurials,</HI> they leave an Astringency that makes a Patient less apt to it after wherefore those of them that leave more than others of that Property behind best suit the Purpose; as the
<Q><HI>Potio Communis Purgativa Sydenham.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In administring <HI>Mercurials,</HI> the <HI>Bolus</HI> should contain but a small Dose at first.</P>
<P>℞ <HI>Mer. Dul. gr.</HI> x. <HI>Laud. L. gr.</HI> ij. <HI>Cons. Ros. q. s. fiat Bolus quaque nocte sumend.</HI> And be increased two or three Grains every Re∣petition; because large Doses of it in the beginning exert too much force in the <HI>Pri∣mae viae,</HI> and by the effect of their own Irri∣tation, are pass'd off with their Contents; whereas a small one, without giving such disturbance, leisurely intrudes it self, and in the Circulation arrives at and wounds the Salival Glands; and when once it has obtain'd that Path, the subsequent Doses more easily follow, and suppress all Fears of a Diversion.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Diet has its Use towards this End, and should be dry and astringent; Rice, toasted Cheese, Yolks of Eggs in mull'd Whitewine, a Harts-horn-Drink, and Roast-meats, in general, are proper
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>Food; minding to continue the most nou∣rishing of them (the Meats) as long as we can to support the Strength thro'; for in the Progress the Throat will be too sore to bear swallowing any thing but Liquids.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another means conducive to it, will be guarding against Cold, which would by constipating the Pores make the Body loose <HI>Cutis Densitas alvi Laxitas.</HI></P>
<P>These few Rules premis'd, we may go on with the <HI>Mercurial Bolus's</HI> for three or four Nights successively; and if the Spit∣ting in that time is found to have advanc'd but slowly, or the Body is laxative, alter it for one of <HI>Turb. Min. à gr.</HI> v <HI>ad</HI> viij, giving an Anodyne Draught at the end of its Ope∣ration.</P>
<P>Two or three <HI>Turbith Bolus's</HI> following the other, and increasing their Dose a Grain every Repetition (<HI>a</HI> v <HI>ad</HI> viij) may be expected to raise the Flux; but Consti∣tutions differ, and will be always an Ex∣ception to any stated number: I've known two Bolus's of <HI>Calomel</HI> raise a Salivation, and I have seen <ABBR>lb</ABBR>is. of Mercury by Unction in∣effectual. And here it may not be altoge∣ther unfit to mention the opposite Conse∣quences that at some times proceed from the use of such a Quantity under different Symptoms: I have known nocturnal Pains of the Head and Shoulders that have been
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>removed by using such a quantity in Un∣ction, tho' a Spitting never succeeded; and yet the same persisting when the Case ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been Eruptions and stinking putrid Ulcers has not only failed, as to the Salivation, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> render'd the Case deplorable, by increasing their Number and Quantity of Matter, and consuming the Patient in colliquativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sweats: But in this, Reason and Experi∣ence must be our Guide; we must be abl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to know when the Mercury operates kind∣ly, and whether the Patient's Constitution and Courage will support him thro' the Course; because now, if the Success i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doubted, we may safely divert with Ca∣tharticks, which in the increase will be dangerous and impracticable; for my own part, I have seldom miss'd, more or less, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Looseness in the raising a Salivation, and have persisted in the use of <HI>Turbith,</HI> when a Patient has had sixteen or eighteen Stools in a Night; but this has been in robusi∣strong Bodies, and with this Caution, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> giving a Respit for a Day or two, a <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf horn</HI> Drink, and an <HI>Anodyne</HI> Draught.</P>
<P>If in the beginning of a Flux there should be a more than ordinary Pain in the Jaws and Mouth, and the <HI>Saliva</HI> running o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bloody, we are not to be startled at it, they are the common Attendants of Mercury and reach no further than the Parts imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣diately
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>affected; a Day's Intermission from Mercurials will palliate, and in a great measure correct such Uneasinesses; and to prevent their return and Aggravation, we may perfect the remainder of our Work by Unction, which does not affect with so much Pain as Mercury received by the Mouth does.</P>
<P>The Spittle at first is thick and clammy; but as it increases in Quantity, grows thin and serous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The STATE.</HEAD>
<P>By the State of a Salivation, I mean all that time from a Patient's spitting about a Quart in 24 Hours, till its height and return to that Quantity again, which may include a Fortnight or more; and during this, the exactest Regulation is required to promote the Flux, and avoid the danger of a Diver∣sion. The beginning has less regard in Re∣gimen, because the <HI>Fauces</HI> as yet suffer so∣lid and nourishing Diet to pass and sustain Nature; but in this their Soreness will ad∣mit of nothing but soft Liquors, as thin Broths and Gruels, which as they afford very little Nourishment, and that the Flux is still greater, a Faintness and Debility of necessity follows, that will constrain us to stricter Rules. The Patient must be alto∣gether confin'd to the Bed; he must be kept between the Blankets; the Bed well
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>lin'd; the Room close and warm, and a Julap <HI>pro Languoribus;</HI> the Head and Jaws should be covered also with Flannel, it re∣pels the Effects of Cold, and is <HI>Anodyne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> The Mouth should be frequently wash'd with the Liquids they drink, to cleanse and scour the Glands from Filth, that they may the more freely spue out their Contents; for this purpose therefore, and also for quenching the continual Thirst they will be under from a large Spitting, plenty of them must be in readiness; and they should be used warm, because Cold (in this general Ulceration of the Mouth) would create great Pain, check the Flux, and hazard the falling out of the Teeth. If there should be a necessity to check its A∣ctivity, <HI>Flos Sulphuris</HI> is the Medicine.</P>
<P>I account the Salivation well raised, if I can make it amount to about two Quarts in a Natural Day, and continue it so for eight or ten; but let the highest Quantity be what it will, whenever it lessens regn∣larly, it signifies the Mercury to have spent its utmost Force and Power, and puts us on Considerations for our Third and last Branch, <HI>The Recovery, or State of Declen∣sion.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The DECLENSION.</HEAD>
<P>A Flux that has advanced kindly to its Height, will as gradually decline, and in the close of it calls for Physick and Diet Drink, to expel the Remains and Recre∣ments of the Mercury: They are not giv∣en till the Swelling and Soreness of the Jaws and Mouth are well abated, and the Draining little; some there will be while the Mouth continues sore, because, while the Fibres are excoriated, there will be a proportionable Vellication that will express the Juices within their Contact; and this might continue an inconvenient length. if the Humours were not diverted, and the Ulcerations dried in the end, by <HI>Enema's, Catharticks</HI> and <HI>Gargles.</HI></P>
