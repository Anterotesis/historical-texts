<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>LONDON</HI> INFIRMARY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F all Circumstances that affect the Mind of Man with Compassion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for the Institu∣tion.</NOTE> no one seems to touch it so nearly as the seeing our Fellow-Creatures labouring with Diseases, and even perishing under them for want of proper and timely Assistance; for who that is not savage in Nature can pass regardless by those Numbers of miserable Objects, who daily present themselves to us, and whose various Diseases (were all other Motives silent) would be as so many Tongues, which at once speak their own Anguish and ex∣cite our Pity. As the Characteristick of the <HI>English</HI> is to be humane and beneficent, so no∣thing
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>shews it more than Institutions of a pub∣lick Nature, such as Hospitals and Infirmaries, which are here better regulated and supplied with Necessaries, than in any other Country what∣soever. Some there are of Royal Endowment, and establish'd Revenue, and others of more modern Institution, erected and supported by the generous and voluntary Contributions of good and well-disposed Persons; but all these are by Experience known to be no ways ade∣quate to the Numbers that seek Assistance from them; for as they can take in no more Patients than they have Beds, or give Medicine to more than what their Income will allow, many poor unhappy Creatures must be unavoidably lost. For 'tis a Truth well known, that tho' the City of <HI>London</HI> is more populous, and by its Trade and Navigation, the labouring Part thereof are more subject to Accidents and Diseases than the common People of <HI>Paris;</HI> yet it appears from the annual printed Accounts, that the <HI>Hotel Dieu</HI> alone contains more Patients at one time than all our Hospitals and Infirmaries together. If such Provision is made for the diseased Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Paris,</HI> those of <HI>London</HI> more imme∣diately require our Regard; particularly, the <HI>British</HI> Manufacturers and Seamen, as they are
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>the chief Support of both our foreign and do∣mestick Trade.</P>
<P>The Strength and Security of <HI>Great Britain</HI> depending chiefly on its Naval Power, the Wis∣dom of the Legislature has shewed a peculiar Concern for the Comfort and Happiness of such infirm and disabled Seamen as have been en∣gaged in the Service of the Royal Navy: But for Seamen imployed only in the Service of the Merchant, and trading Part of the Kingdom, or the Wives and Families of such, in Distress by Sickness, no desirable Publick Provision has yet been made, or <HI>particularly</HI> instituted for their Relief. Nor are our numerous, poor, in∣dustrious Manufacturers, and Artificers, or their Wives and Children, by any particular Dona∣tions or Establishment, sufficiently provided for, under the Calamity of bodily Diseases and Ca∣sualties; tho' in such afflicting and melancholy Circumstances, they are incapable of providing for themselves or Families by their usual Labour and Industry.</P>
<P>These Considerations have induced many be∣nevolent and publick spirited Noblemen, Gen∣tlemen, Merchants and others to turn their Thoughts upon raising by publick Subscription, a LONDON-INFIRMARY, where <HI>British</HI> Sailors in
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>the Merchants Service, their Wives and Chil∣dren; and poor <HI>British</HI> Manufacturers, their Wives and Children; are daily admitted, and find Relief, in Distress by Sickness or Casualties: And this without any Difficulty or Expence of Admittance.</P>
<P>In order to answer the Ends proposed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> <HI>a large House was taken in</HI> Prescot-Street, Good∣man's-Fields, which Situation was judged the most convenient, as being near the usual A∣bodes of Manufacturers and Seafaring Men in the Merchants Service, and at a considerable Distance from any Hospital.</P>
<P>The House is spacious and convenient,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulation of the House.</NOTE> con∣tains about forty Beds, properly and airily dis∣posed, is furnished with Linnen, and all ne∣cessary Conveniencies. The <HI>Matron,</HI> a sober and discreet Woman, has the Charge of the House and Furniture; the Direction of the Nurses, and other Servants; and sees the Diet and Medicines administred according to Order. Under her, are Nurses, and Watchers, in pro∣portion to the Number of Patients, of experi∣enced Honesty and Tenderness, who are guided by written Orders to prevent Misconduct of any kind. Proper Diet for the Patients has been settled by the Gentlemen of the Faculty
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>engaged in this Charity, and is fixed up in the Wards for the Satisfaction of the Patients and their Friends.</P>
<P>A <HI>Physician and Surgeon</HI> of Reputation are appointed, and attend daily,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians and Surgeons.</NOTE> from Eleven to One, without any Fee or Reward, and give their Advice to all such poor diseased Objects as think proper to come in those Hours, whe∣ther recommended or not; and other Physi∣cians and Surgeons of Character attend and ad∣vise in all dangerous or extraordinary Cases.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dispensary</HI> is furnish'd with Drugs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispensary.</NOTE> which being first viewed and reported Good by a Committee for that Purpose, are bought at the best hand, and compounded at the <HI>Infirmary,</HI> where an Apothecary Resides, who constantly and solely attends the Business thereof.</P>
<P>No Officers or Servants are permitted upon Pain of Expulsion to take of any Tradesmen, Patients, or other Persons, any Fee, Reward, or Gratification of any kind, directly or indi∣rectly, for any Service done, or to be done, on Account of this Infirmary.</P>
<P>And as the Governors of this Charity are de∣sirous that the utmost Regard may be had to the Souls of the Patients,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chaplain.</NOTE> as well as their Bo∣dies, a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England</HI> has generously undertaken, without any Gra∣tuity,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>to read Prayers, and perform the other Duties of his Function, at the <HI>Infirmary.</HI></P>
<P>Every Subscriber of five Guineas Yearly is a Governor of this Charity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualification of a Gover∣nor.</NOTE> and is intitled to send in as many Patients as there are Vacancies of Beds; but if they can't be received as In-Patients, they are relieved as Out-Patients. Every Gentleman giving a Benefaction of thirty Guineas at once, will be a Governor for Life.—All Subscriptions are during Pleasure, and smaller Sums, from well-disposed Persons, will be thankfully receiv'd and acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>Four Governors in Rotation every Month,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Business of Governors.</NOTE> with any others that are pleased, attend Weekly, in order to receive, and dismiss Patients, supervise the Proceeding of the House, and do such Business as is usually done by Committees at other Hos∣pitals, and report the same at the next Quar∣terly or General Meeting. There is a General Meeting of the Governors every Quarter, before whom a Report is made from the Weekly Committees, all By-Laws are then Confirm'd, all Vacancies fill'd up, and Accounts Audited. Also an Annual General Meeting of all Sub∣scribers to Revise and Confirm the General Account of Proceedings, which will immedi∣ately after be publish'd for the Satisfaction of the Publick.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<P>The Accounts are kept in a regular mercan∣tile Manner, and the Names of the Patients, their Employment, Place of Abode, Disorder, the Issue of the Case, and the Name of the Subscriber who sent them, are inserted in se∣veral Columns in a Book for that Purpose; and are always ready for the Inspection of Sub∣scribers, as also the Statutes and By-Laws for the particular Regulation of this <HI>Infirmary.</HI></P>
<P>All poor, sick, and lame,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proper Ob∣jects.</NOTE> who are recom∣mended, or appear to the Committee to be truly necessitous, are received from the Hours of Eleven to One, who are supply'd with Ad∣vice, Medicine, Diet, Washing, Lodging, and every comfortable Assistance during their Cure. No Persons with incurable or infectious Dis∣tempers, or of known Ability to pay for their Cures, are admitted to partake of this Charity; but all Accidents are received at any Hour of the Day or Night.</P>
<P>This is the Plan of our Proceedings, and tho' this Work is but in its Infancy, yet such has been the extraordinary Encouragement given to it, by Numbers of Distinguish'd Humanity, that we have the Satisfaction to assure the Pub∣lick, that since the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> 1740, it has pleased God to bless us with such Success, that upwards of 2000 distressed Objects have
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>been Relieved at the <HI>London Infirmary,</HI> and from Labouring under the Oppression of some of the most malignant Diseases, and unhappy Accidents, have been re-instated in their Ho∣nest and Industrious Capacities of Working; whereby the Publick again enjoy the Benefit of their Labour; They, and their poor Families preserved from Perishing, and prevented from being a constant Incumbrance to the Commu∣nity.</P>
<P>The Subscribers are desired to take Notice, that if any Patients shall not conform to the Rules of the House, or are guilty of any Mis∣behaviour, they will be discharged for such Ir∣regularity, and never more relieved by this Cha∣rity.</P>
<P>There was a Proposal in the <HI>Daily Adver∣tiser</HI> of the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> 1738, for erecting an <HI>Hospital, Infirmary, Surgery, Chappel,</HI> and <HI>School,</HI> for relieving of poor, aged, and other∣wise disabled Seamen in the Merchants Service, their Wives and Children, by a Subscription to be set on Foot amongst the Merchants, Owners, Masters, and Officers of Ships, and common Seamen, who were to pay certain Quarterly Sums according to their several Ranks, which, with the Contributions of worthy People, might have been sufficient for the desired End: As
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>the <HI>London Infirmary</HI> already begun, is calcu∣lated to relieve all those who are disabled by Sickness or Accidents, and their Wives and Children, and answers that Proposal in Part, and may be the Foundation of the Whole, we hope those who had so charitably join'd in sup∣porting that Subscription, will as readily interest themselves in this, which, if it pleases God to continue his Favour and prosper the Undertak∣ing, may in time, by such Encouragement, be extended to the whole Benefit proposed by that Advertisement.</P>
<P REND="italic">Such Persons therefore as are inclined to en∣courage and promote so laudable a Work, are desired to send their Subscriptions or Benefactions to Mr. <HI>Thomas Minors,</HI> Banker, in <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> who will give proper Receipts for the same: And any Person in∣clined by his last Will to bequeath a Legacy to this Charity, is desired to direct it to be paid to the Treasurer for the Time being, of the <HI>London Infirmary</HI> in <HI>Goodman's Fields,</HI> and that his Receipt shall be a good Dis∣charge for the same.</P>
