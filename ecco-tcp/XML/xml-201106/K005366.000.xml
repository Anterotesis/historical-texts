<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the request which you urged in so obliging a manner, I am now to present you with a few re∣marks on the nature, causes, and method of cure, of Nervous Disorders. Under this denomination, in its full extent, are included several diseases of the most dan∣gerous kind; as the apoplexy, epilepsy, and convulsions, beside the hysteric pas∣sion and hypochondriacal disease. The enquiry, however, shall be restricted to those complaints more particularly deno∣minated nervous, and which seem to de∣pend
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>upon extreme sensibility of consti∣tution. But the nerves being the basis of our subject, it may be proper to pre∣mise a few words on those delicate parts of the human frame, universally admit∣ted to be the medium of intercourse to the body and soul.</P>
<P>The nerves are minute ramifications, resembling chords; proceeding either from the brain or the spinal marrow, and dis∣tributed to the various parts of the body, for the purposes of sensation and motion. With regard to their structure anatomists are divided; some holding them exqui∣sitely fine tubes; others, filaments with∣out any cavity. The former hypothesis, countenanced alike by experiment and analogy, is consequently far the more probable. Those who maintain the tubu∣lar formation, conclude that the nerves are furnished with a fluid secreted in the brain, and known by the name of animal spirits.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y"/>
<P>Nervous complaints are so various and eccentric, that a volume would hardly suffice to a complete description of them. The most common symptoms are, weak∣ness, flatulence, palpitations, watchful∣ness, sleepiness after eating, timidity, flashes of heat and cold, numbness, ri∣gors of different parts, vertigo, pains, especially of the head, back, and loins, hiccup, difficulty of respiration and de∣glutition, anxiety, dry cough, limpid urine, &amp;c.</P>
<P>An opinion prevails that nervous dis∣orders are more frequent in this country at present, than in any former period. This is commonly imputed to the drink∣ing of tea, now so general among people of all ranks. Whether this celebrated exotic really proves so injurious as has been imagined, may still be matter of dispute. That in many constitutions it excites nervous symptoms, such as tre∣mors, palpitations, and watchfulness, we
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>are certain from experience; but we also know that in others it is regularly taken, not only without any sensible bad effects, but even with advantage. It relieves a headake, dispels drowsiness, and is often observed to promote digestion.</P>
<P>Should we examine the whole econo∣my of persons most addicted to tea-drink∣ing, at least of those who are imagined to be chiefly affected by it, perhaps we might discover other probable causes of weakness. The numerous modes of in∣dulgence practised in times of refinement and luxury, ought all to be allowed their respective share in producing this effect. The farther we depart from simplicity and temperance in diet, and the more we sacrifice the wholesome exercises to the inactivity attending domestic amuse∣ments, the greater will be the influence of every physical error in diminishing the vigor of the constitution.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<P>When we consider that those causes have more or less operated, at some pe∣riod or other, in every country where re∣finement has any time existed; and when we take into the account the numerous causes of weakness which have arisen from accident or disease, there might seem reason for concluding, that in the space of some thousand years, the constitution of man has undergone an extraordinary change. But such an opinion, however plausible, is much to be questioned. On a subject of this nature we can draw no argument from experience. The vigor of one age has declined, before that of another has arrived at maturity; and no standard is transmitted, by which we may determine the comparative strength of ge∣nerations. Perhaps it will be said, that this point has long been settled by the poets.</P>

<P>Had the human race degenerated, since the Augustan age, in the same progres∣sion, to what a degree of weakness must mankind have by this time dwindled!</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<P>If the problem were determinable by facts, it would be so by instances of lon∣gevity; but even those are far from being decisive. There is reason to doubt whe∣ther longevity be a certain criterion of uncommon vigor. Perhaps it may be ascribed rather to soundness of constitu∣tion than to superior strength. Admitting the poetic authorities in favor of the primitive ages; admitting the extraordi∣nary muscular force of a Hector, a Tur∣nus, or a Hercules; still the vigor of those heroes can reflect no general lustre on the times in which they lived; nay their fame implies a great inferiority of the contemporary inhabitants of the world.</P>
<P>But to dispute with former ages the palm of constitutional vigor, is not the object of enquiry. The speculation could only be so far useful as it might enable us to ascertain what circumstances in the modern way of living appear the most subversive of corporeal strength. The
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>distinctions characteristic of fashionable life are idleness and intemperance; the never-failing concomitants of high re∣finement. Celsus observes that those two vices had first spoiled the constitution of the Greeks, and afterwards of his coun∣trymen the Romans, when they had be∣come masters of the luxury, as well as the territories, of that polite people. In similar circumstances, the same causes have similarly operated; and their united in∣fluence may, independently of any parti∣cular species of modern luxury, continue to produce the same effects.</P>
<P>It is universally admitted, that the pre∣disposing cause of nervous disorders is too great irritability of constitution, which may be either hereditary, or acquired in various ways; for instance, by a seden∣tary life, too great application to study, intemperance of any kind, tedious dis∣eases, profuse evacuations, or the depress∣ing passions.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<P>Nervous distempers are alike incidental to both sexes; with only this difference, that in the female, from the natural de∣licacy of constitution, and the manner of life, they are, in general, more frequent and violent than in the other. Being pe∣culiar to neither sex, they are not restrict∣ed to any period of life; but usually most prevalent during the middle stages of it.</P>
<P>Though a weakness of the nervous system be often hereditary, it seldom re∣ceives any augmentation in the earlier part of life; the playfulness of children, and their exemption from cares, at least from such as are productive of habitual anxiety, counteracting the progress of the disposition. The same causes may con∣tinue to operate after the commencement of adult age, unless menstrual irregulari∣ties in one sex, or pernicious excesses in the other, call forth the latent seeds of constitutional debility.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<P>At whatever period the disorder first appears, its progress in different persons is liable to great variation. In some it remains a stationary complaint, with in∣termissions, however, but without exacer∣bations, for several years; while in others it fluctuates through all the gradations, from the faintest symptom of spasmodic affection, to its consummation in the epi∣lepsy, apoplexy, or hysteric passion.</P>
<P>When but one cause stimulates nervous affection, the health may not be greatly impaired for a time: but when two or more operate in conjunction; for in∣stance, when to a sedentary life is joined the influence of grief or anxiety; and when watchfulness, the natural concomi∣tant of each, is rendered more obstinate by the combination of all; the strength must fast decline, and the disease advance with proportionable rapidity.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<P>An eminent author has observed, that there is scarce a disease which the ner∣vous ailment will not counterfeit: he might have added, that there is hardly any which it may not realize. The debilitat∣ed state of the concoctive powers, and the general consequent relaxation, are par∣ticularly favorable to the production of chronic disorders; while the irritability of the nervous system no less disposes to those of the acute kind.</P>
<P>When a weakness of the nerves is he∣reditary, the origin of their diseases is lost in the general debility of the system: but if it has been acquired by errors in what are called the non-naturals, the be∣ginning of those complaints may, for the most part, be traced to a weakness of the stomach and bowels; whence if those dis∣eases do not actually derive their earliest existence, at least the signs of their inva∣sion are there most perceptible. They commonly begin with an oppression,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>and sense of fullness in the stomach after eating: the sleep is much interrupted with dreams: frequently the person feels a slight pain in the stomach or belly. Those symptoms are at times accompanied with a singing in the ears, and with fits of gid∣diness, particularly in stooping.</P>
<P>That a disease which depends upon ir∣ritability, and is supported by a sympathy in the nervous system, derives its origin from the stomach and bowels, is an opi∣nion strongly confirmed by the texture and offices of those parts. Furnished with numerous branches of nerves, they are ex∣tremely susceptible of irritation; to which they are also particularly exposed from the weight or resistance of the food, its occa∣sional acrimony, and the stimulating na∣ture of the gastric fluids, rendered yet more acrimonious by vitiated digestion.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the disorder, be∣fore the patient has either been cautioned
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>by the physician, or instructed by experi∣ence, to abstain from a hearty supper, it is not uncommon for this indulgence to be succeeded, in the night, by a great op∣pression about the heart and stomach. This state is frequently accompanied with a convulsive motion of the tongue and jaws; during which the former lolls out, and is exposed to the gnashing of the teeth.</P>
<P>When a great weakness of the stomach and bowels has been introduced, many are the occasional causes of irritation from which nervous symptoms may ensue. In general, whatever, by quantity or qua∣lity, relaxes the solids, or by acrimony stimulates into spasms; whatever dimi∣nishes the energy, or excites to irregu∣lar motion, of the animal spirits, tends either immediately or remotely to the pro∣duction of nervous disorders.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<P>The occasional causes may be divided into the following classes: 1. Wind, phlegm, worms, or acrid matter, in the first passages. 2. Acrid matter in the blood. 3. The diminution or suppression of some accustomed discharge. 4. Inani∣tion, whether occasioned by abstinence or evacuation. 5. Violent passions. 6. Ob∣structions in the abdominal viscera. 7. The effluvia of some odorous substances.</P>
<P>Though those causes may operate sing∣ly towards the production of nervous symptoms, it is not uncommon for two or more of them to act at the same time, and when this happens, the disorder which they excite in the animal economy, as has been already observed, is propor∣tionably violent.</P>
<P>Of all the causes of nervous complaints, none is more pernicious than profuse se∣minal evacuation. It has been alledged that this discharge always accompanies a
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>chronic weakness: the remark is per∣haps not sufficiently confirmed by autho∣rities. When such a case occurs, there is reason to suspect that the seminal weakness had preceded the nervous dis∣order. On the appearance of the latter, however, the former is liable to be in∣creased.</P>
<P>In attempting the removal of the nerv∣ous complaint, the greatest attention is necessary to investigate the precise origin, whether singular or plural, whence it de∣rives its support: for without such know∣ledge, in vain shall we endeavor to pre∣vent the effects of irritation. With every advantage on our side, we shall often have occasion to regret the obstinacy of the dis∣ease. Indeed, that nervous disorders should prove difficult of cure, will not appear surprising, when we consider how much they are distinguished by a variety of opposite indications and circumstances,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>of a positive and negative, of a physical and moral kind. Amidst the necessity of nourishment, is every impediment to di∣gestion. The impurity of the blood we find aggravated by great irregularity of the discharges. Sleep, however indispens∣able for recruiting the exhausted strength, in many cases comes not spontaneously; nor can it be procured by medicine, with∣out increasing relaxation. Exercise, ab∣solutely necessary, is often prevented by a listlessness, utterly averse to motion. In morbid irritability, which requires the most soothing treatment, the patient is peculiarly liable to perturbations of body and mind. Notwithstanding incidental or habitual lowness of spirits, which seems to indicate the expedience of some exhilarating liquor, even the moderate use of cordials may be neither effectual nor safe. Anxiety, natural to the com∣plaint, and increased by every considera∣tion, must yet be supported with patience.
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>And lastly, though so complicated a dis∣temper might seem to demand the most active remedies, it is often observed to be aggravated even by those of the gent∣lest kind.</P>
<P>It may well be imagined, that a dis∣ease which for the most part originates from an irritability of the alimentary ca∣nal, or is always accompanied with it, requires particular attention to diet. In no other chronic disorder is a dietetic re∣striction equally indispensable: for the person who would either stop the com∣plaint, or obtain a recovery, must be not only temperate, but circumspect, in all convivial gratifications. The infinite di∣versity of temperaments renders it im∣possible to deliver rules accommodated to every individual; but in general, the re∣gimen of those who are subject to ner∣vous complaints may be comprised under the following directions. — The food ought to be easy of digestion, and chief∣ly
<PB N="18" REF="19" MS="y"/>of the animal kind: vegetables, on account of the flatulence they occasion, being commonly hurtful. Pastry-work, and butter-sauces, are prejudicial; as are likewise fat meats. Even bread should be eaten sparingly, and never on the day that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is baked: for, if new, it occasions a great fermentation in the stomach. Wine, for the most part, causes distur∣bance, if not in the stomach, at least in the bowels of the valetudinary. The same may be observed of malt-li∣quors: but to some constitutions porter, in the quantity of half a pint, or not ex∣ceeding a pint, is often found salutary. For the majority, however, of the nerv∣ous, water, either alone, or mixt with a small portion of brandy, which is lighter on the stomach than rum, is the best adapted drink. Whatever kind is used, dilution should always be moderate. Sup∣per ought either to be omitted, or taken in a very sparing quantity, and at an ear∣ly hour.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="20" MS="y"/>
<P>This attention is the more necessary, as errors committed in diet never fail to affect the nightly rest; a consideration of the greatest importance. For, though di∣gestion may have hitherto proceeded with∣out much uneasiness, yet when its pro∣gress is retarded by a recumbent posture, which also greatly impedes the discharge of flatulence from the stomach; when the aliments, by retention in the bowels, have acquired a more considerable degree of acrimony; and when the body, by the relaxing warmth of the bed, is rendered more susceptible of irritation, sleep, if not entirely prevented, which is sometimes the case, is at least so much interrupted as hardly to afford any refreshment.</P>
<P>Previous to an account of the cure of nervous disorders, it cannot be improper to make a few remarks on the method by which it has hitherto been usually con∣ducted. We know too little of the phy∣siology of the nerves, to be intimately ac∣quainted
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>with the nature and modifica∣tions of their diseases. Our theory is conjectural; and our practice, if not founded on principles too vague, is fre∣quently indiscriminate. Among the oc∣casional causes mentioned above, only a few may be safely opposed by an imme∣diate recourse to astringent and strength∣ening remedies: yet too often has this method been pursued under different cir∣cumstances of the complaint. Of this preposterous practice not the only ill con∣sequence is the fruitless administraction of corroborants: for the process of cure be∣ing commenced where it ought to have ended, the requisite preparation is neglect∣ed, and a foundation laid for the establish∣ment of the disease.</P>
<P>When nervous disorders arise from in∣anition, or from the suppression of some accustomed discharge, their origin may be ascertained from either of those causes. If they proceed from the latter, the eva∣cuation
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>ought to be recalled; if from the former, hasty repletion must be avoided. Without this caution the digestive powers will be oppressed, and a load of impure humours will be generated; which, by farther weakening the body, contaminat∣ing the blood, and hazarding obstructions in the bowels, will not only increase the original, but may give rise to two other principal causes of the complaint.</P>
<P>If the weakness productive of nervous distress be owing to any sudden and great evacuation, recourse should immediately be had to strengthening remedies: but in all cases, except the above, preparation is necessary; and the stomach being either primarily or secondarily affected, the treatment might do well to begin with a gentle vomit of ipecacuanha or camomile flowers. The next indication is a laxa∣tive, to be repeated occasionally through the course of the complaint, when the patient is subject to costiveness; a state
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>that generally accompanies nervous dis∣orders, and always tends to increase them. In different cases different laxatives are proper. When bilious humours cause ir∣ritation, rhubarb may prove most suit∣able; but if acid humours, as often, pre∣dominate, a tea-spoonful or two of mag∣nesia may be given, either alone, or mix∣ed with a few grains of the former. All rough and violent purges are to be avoided, as they increase at once irritation and weakness.</P>
<P>After discharging from the stomach and bowels any acrid humours which may have occasioned irritation, prescription should be adapted to the particular cause, or causes, supposed to produce or promote the disease. Thus, if there should be rea∣son to suspect worms, anthelmintic me∣dicines must be given. But when ob∣structions in the abdominal viscera appear the cause of the disorder, recourse is to be had (after blooding, if the patient be
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>plethoric) to deobstruent medicines; as the saponaceous, gum ammoniac, &amp;c. with the use of warm fomentations. It is difficult, indeed, to ascertain such ob∣structions, unless, what seldom happens, the tumors be perceptible to the touch. But if the signs of weak digestion be at∣tended with fixt pains in the belly, and a quick pulse, without much heat or thirst, the existence of this cause may be pre∣sumed.</P>
<P>Of all the occasional causes of nervous complaints, wind in the stomach or bowels is the most frequent, and that which uni∣versally excites the most troublesome symptoms. For dispelling it the usual recourse is carminatives: but, unless the wind be in the stomach, those sel∣dom afford immediate relief; sometimes they even aggravate the complaint. A more certain remedy is a tea-spoonful of the spiritus aethereus, diluted with two table-spoonfuls of water. For the same
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>end, nothing is more efficacious than opi∣um, prescribed with assa foetida; which proves equally successful, whether the fla∣tulence be in the stomach or intestines. In nervous disorders, however, opiates are never to be given without great re∣serve, as they impair the strength, and increase the depression of spirits, so com∣mon in those cases. A glass of cold wa∣ter, by contracting the muscular coat of the stomach, will sometimes immediately operate the discharge of flatulence. But should this simple expedient prove inef∣fectual, it must not again be attempted.</P>
<P>In oppression from the above cause, ex∣ternal applications may also be successful. Much benefit has been received from rub∣bing, at bed-time, upon the stomach and bel∣ly, some of Bate's anodyne balsam, mixt with half its quantity of the expressed oil of mace, and a fourth part of the oil of mint. An antihysteric plaster may like∣wise be employed with advantage.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
<P>It is advisable for persons troubled with flatulence to rub the belly a little, in a circular direction, in the morning, before getting up. For this purpose the hand were preferable to the flesh-brush, did it not expose the joints of the fingers to swelling: a consequence to which nerv∣ous patients are peculiarly liable, and when it does take place, the pain is often instantaneously exasperated, on taking the smallest quantity of wine, or any strong liquor.</P>
<P>In flatulent complaints of the sto∣mach and bowels, to rub the legs fre∣quently with a flesh-brush has been found of good effect; which seems to be produced by exciting agreeable oscillations. This exercise, however, ought not to be continued above a few minutes at a time; otherwise it is apt to occasion languor, and increase irritabi∣lity.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
<P>A symptom not uncommon with nerv∣ous persons is a coldness of the extremi∣ties, particularly the feet. To this they are chiefly exposed in the winter, when they sit by a bad fire, and fix their atten∣tion on any object. In such circumstances should they venture to bed, the conse∣quence is almost certain that they will continue awake, until by some means or other the uneasy sensation be removed. The best expedient is to chafe the feet with warm bricks, or any application cal∣culated to answer the same purpose.</P>
<P>For the nervous pain in the small of the back, sometimes so acute that the patient can hardly stand upright, it is advisable to fold round the body a napkin, which has either been warmed at the fire, or, what is better, likewise impregnated with the steams of myrrh, benzoin, and frank∣incense, burnt on a shovel. In many cases, this application gives almost instant relief.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
<P>The immediate cause of nervous disor∣ders appearing to be either a deficiency, or irregular motion, of the animal spirits, the most efficacious might seem to be such medicines as exert the speediest influence on the nervous system. For whatever warms the stomach, and excites in it an agreeable sensation, affords a temporary relief. This remark may be thought to suggest the discrete use of cordials; which, doubtless, in some cases, may have their propriety. Several reasons concur, how∣ever, to prescribe with great moderation, where not entirely to prohibit the recourse to those remedies, whether of the vinous or of the spirituous kind. The former, by the fermentation they undergo in the stomach and bowels, are apt, as before observed, to create disturbance in nervous habits; and the latter, it is well known, have an injurious effect on the viscera. But when wine does not disagree with the patient, and when spirituous liquors are sufficient∣ly diluted, it would be hard, in cases so
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>entitled to sympathy, to prohibit any pru∣dent gratification.</P>
<P>In this disease, the best cordials are those that have no immediate tendency to exhilarate, in the manner of intoxicating liquors; but such as rather allay than ex∣cite an irregular motion of the spirits, and enliven only by removing the obstacles to their placid and equable exertion. For medicines to accomplish this important purpose, have the various departments of nature been ransacked. Long and whim∣sical was the prescription of animal sub∣stances, and many the fruitless researches among the mineral tribes; until modern practice learned to place its dependence on the simples of the vegetable kingdom, and principally on those of the fetid class. Happy recourse, were its efficacy equally established, and itself directed by more determinate rules. With the common method of administering those remedies, however, small is the reason to be satis∣fied. Frequent is the practice to give
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>them at stated times, without considering whether they be duly indicated. The consequence of such repetition is, that they gradually lose their sedative and anti∣spasmodic power; an inconvenience against which we cannot be too guarded, in the treatment of so tedious a disease; where palliative remedies, though used only when requisite, by habit become necessary to the constitution. Cautiously are we, therefore, to reserve them for the more urgent symptoms; for languors, faint∣ings, oppression from flatulence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fetid medicines, taken at bed-time, by assuaging nervous agitations, favor a dis∣position to sleep. But they will be taken to no purpose, and may even increase perturbation, if the patient retire prema∣turely to bed, while the gastric, or abdo∣minal region is distended with flatulence. On those occasions, it is of great advan∣tage to promote the discharge of wind from the stomach, by gentle pressure with
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>the hand; which method should also be practised sitting up in bed, if uneasiness, from the same cause, be felt in a recum∣bent posture.</P>
<P>In prosecuting the radical cure of ner∣vous complaints, the most efficacious re∣medies are steel, the Peruvian bark, and the cold-bath. In some cases, the two first may with propriety be combined; in others, one of them only can be adminis∣tered with advantage. When the pulse is slow, either may be given; if frequent, unless this symptom be occasioned by weakness, steel especially is unadvisable. It ought, however, to be remarked, that in those disorders, the pulse is subject to great irregularity; and therefore, that no positive indication should be drawn from it, without the concurrence of other cir∣cumstances. Both steel and bark are im∣proper while the patient is plethoric, or afflicted with fixt pains in the belly. Cha∣lybeate waters are indicated in the same
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>circumstances with steel medicines, and may be found alike beneficial.</P>
<P>By nothing is the body more effectual∣ly strengthened than by the cold-bath, which should, therefore, never be neglect∣ed, when no particular circumstance for∣bids. To bathe three or four times a∣week, is sufficient; and at the end of every three months the practice ought to be intermitted, for a week or ten days; a caution also to be adopted with regard to the strengthening medicines.</P>
<P>The method of using the cold-bath in summer and autumn, and the internal cor∣roborants in the winter and spring, is li∣able to exception. For the former, by far the more efficacious, is by this means too long interrupted, and in the seasons when, if the bath be of fresh water, its influence is sensibly greater. A more ad∣visable method is to use the bath, with the bark and chalybeates, in shorter alterna∣tions;
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>bathing two or three weeks, and then taking the medicines half that time. Nay, there lies no objection against the use of the Peruvian bark every day the person does not bathe; observing to inter∣mit the medicine occasionally for a few days. A light tincture of the bark, join∣ed to bitters, may be used in this manner with success.</P>
<P>When acids do not disagree with the sto∣mach, twenty or thirty drops of the elixir of vitriol may be taken once or twice a∣day, in a small dish of camomile or rose∣mary tea.</P>
<P>Beside those remedies, and a strict at∣tention to diet, it is necessary that the pa∣tient use daily exercise; than which no∣thing is more conducive to promote di∣gestion, facilitate sleep, and restore to the constitution the possible degree of strength. Both the kind and duration of exercise must be suited to the state of the patient.
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>The most beneficial is riding on horse∣back. Whatever be the exercise, the per∣son should carefully avoid fatigue, which not only retards the cure, but excites pal∣pitations and spasms of different parts, with variety of uneasiness. In those cir∣cumstances, fetid medicines have peculiar power. Of use they may be also to allay the craving of the stomach, to which nervous persons are frequently subject. But this symptom finds, perhaps, no bet∣ter remedy than a crust of bread, or any thing solid.</P>
<P>A dry air, temperately cool rather than warm, is most favorable to the cure of nervous disorders. If ever the Peruvian bark be preferable to cold-bathing, it is during a moist state of the atmosphere. At least in such seasons it might be alternat∣ed with the other. In moist weather, the flesh-brush is also of particular service; but it should always be administered by an attendant. For a nervous person is soon
