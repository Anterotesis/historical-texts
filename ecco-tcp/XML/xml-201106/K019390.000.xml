<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTH is so great a blessing, that every attempt directed towards its pre∣servation must tend to benefit Society, and deserves a share of public appro∣bation. To relieve the wants of the industrious poor is at all times an act of charity; but when the vigor and strength so necessary for the pursuit of their labors are suspended by the fatal powers of dis∣ease, and when perhaps the bread of a numerous family depends upon the spee∣dy recovery of a poor and afflicted pa∣rent,—at such a time to open the stores
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>of medicine, to dispense a remedy for the poor sufferer, is an act of exalted humanity. For this purpose I have se∣lected the following Observations for the assistance of the benevolent, who feel a wish to relieve, though fearful of pre∣scribing.</P>
<P>When medical assistance can be had, it should be preferred; but disorders attack suddenly, and it frequently hap∣pens that neither advice or medicines can be procured: in those seasons, the following hints are recommended, with a sincere wish that they may contribute to the general good of mankind.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No. 1.</HI> CALCINED MAGNESIA.</HEAD>
<P>AN absorbent; it corrects acidities in the stomach, relieves the heart-burn, and all symp∣toms that have an acid for their source; as sickness, giddiness, head-ach, vomiting, pain in the stomach, convulsions, and complaints in∣cident to children, arising from the same cause.</P>
<P>It is preferred to other absorbents, on ac∣count of its aperient quality. If mixed with Rhubarb, it prevents the Rhubarb from leaving a costiveness behind.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>Half a dram to one dram, taken in a little plain, or peppermint water. To children it is given in doses of five grains to twenty grains, and occasionally a few grains of Rhubarb added.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
<HEAD><HI>No. 2.</HI> POWDER OF TURKY RHUBARB.</HEAD>
<P>A mild cathartic; gently astringent, and strengthens the intestines; hence it is preferred in diarrhoeas, dysenteries, and all disorders pro∣ceeding from a debility and laxity of the fibres; it is frequently indeed given with a view rather to this stomachic and corroborating virtue, than to its producing any considerable evacuation. In acute fevers, where there is an apprehension of producing a diarrhoea by purging medicines, Rhubarb is safe. In diarrhoeas and dysenteries, Rhubarb is doubly useful; first, by carrying off the peccant matter, secondly, by strengthening the bowels against a further afflux. A peculiar excellence in Rhubarb is, its evacuating viscid bile, when lodged in the bile ducts; in this case, next to Aloes, it is the best among purging medicines; and it has this advantage over Aloes, <HI>viz.</HI> that it may be given where inflammation is attendant, bleeding being premised. In gross habits, <HI>Rhubarb</HI> is an useful assistant to secure the efficacy of the Bark, if joined with it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From ten grains to forty grains, as a cathartic; from one grain to five grains, as a corroborant.</P>
<P>Under this head I shall insert two prescrip∣tions, having found them by experience particu∣larly useful. The Pill, in bilious complaints, and to remove costiveness—the Powders, in relaxed habits, to strengthen the tone of the stomach.</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>THE ANTIBILIOUS PILL.</HEAD>
<L>Take Rhubarb in fine powder,</L>
<L>Succotrine Aloes in fine powder,</L>
<L>Castile Soap, of each twenty grains;</L>
<L>Emetic Tartar, one grain;</L>
<L>Syrup of Buckthorn, sufficient quantity to mix into a mass, which divide into twelve pills.</L>
</LG>
<P>Take two or three at night, going to rest, as occasion may require: be careful first to mix the Emetic Tar∣tar with the Rhubarb, by degrees; then add the Aloes, which rub well together; and afterwards the Soap.</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>STRENGTHENING POWDERS.</HEAD>
<L>Take Chamomile Flowers in powder, 24 grains;</L>
<L>Turky Rhubarb in powder,</L>
<L>Ginger in powder, of each 8 grains:</L>
</LG>
<P>Mix them well together, and divide into four equal parts. Take one powder twice a day in a little water▪ an hour or two before cating.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 3. POWDER OF BARK.</HEAD>
<P>The febrisuge virtue, for which alone this medicine was at first recommended, is now established by long experience. An emetic, which in most cases is necessary, being taken towards the approach of a paroxysm, (that its operation may be over before the fit comes on), the <HI>Bark</HI> is begun at the end of the paroxysm, or even in the time of the hot fit, and repeated, in doses of half a dram or more, every third or sourth hour during the intermission: after the fever has been removed, the medicine should be continued for a time, but more sparingly, to prevent a return. During the use of the Bark, the pulse, which between the fits is generally weak and slow, becomes stronger and quicker, the appetite mends, the patient grows more cheerful, and perspiration increases; these may be looked upon as sure presages of its success. At first it frequently occasions a looseness, and this is also salutary; but if the purging continues
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>too long, it is usually checked, by the addition of a little Opium; if too great costiveness en∣sues, recourse is had to gentle, opening medi∣cines, or clysters. In gross, impure habits, Rhubarb is an useful assistant to secure the efficacy of the Bark, if joined with it: in agues of the inflammatory kind, or accompanied with great heat, a little Nitre is joined or interposed. Peruvian Bark has likewise been found emi∣nently serviceable in gangrenes and mortifi∣cations, proceeding either from an internal or external cause. It has been applied likewise, and not without success, to the cure of periodic head-achs, hysteric and hypochondriac fits, and other disorders which have regular intermissions. By its astringency and aromatic quality it strengthens the whole nervous system, and proves useful in weaknesses of the stomach, and sundry chronical disorders, proceeding from too great a laxity of the fibres. In all cases, mode∣rate exercise generally promotes the effect of the Bark.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From half a dram to two drams.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 4. HUXHAM's TINCTURE OF BARK.</HEAD>
<P>As a corroborant and stomachic, it is given in doses of three or four tea spoons full, and par∣ticularly to convalescents, after long fevers; and sometimes in larger doses, for the cure of agues, in persons averse to taking the Peruvian Bark in substance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 5. ESSENCE OF RHUBARB.</HEAD>
<P>This medicine is intended for a stomachic and strengthener, as well as for a purgative. It is of infinite service in weakness of the stomach, indi∣gestion, laxity of the intestines, diarrhoeas, bilious disorders, cholic, and other similar complaints.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>One table spoonful, as a corroborant; two table spoons full to four, as a purgative.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 6. VOLATILE AROMATIC SPIRIT,</HEAD>
<P>Is a most excellent cephalic, and cordial, either to smell to, or take inwardly. It is very useful in lethargic and apoplectic cases, head∣achs, fainting fits, and nervous complaints.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From ten drops to sixty, in a glass of water, or any other vehicle.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 7. NERVOUS DROPS.</HEAD>
<P>This medicine has the reputation of being a cordial of very extraordinary virtues, and has long been held in great esteem, in all kinds of languors, fainting fits, weakness of the nerves, lowness of spirits, and decays of age.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From ten to eighty or an hundred drops, on a lump of sugar, or in a glass of water.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 8. AETHER.</HEAD>
<P>It has been given internally, with benefit, in hooping coughs, hysterical cases, in asthma, and indeed in almost every spasmodic affection.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From ten or twelve drops to a tea spoonful, in a glass of water; which should be swallowed quick, as it exhales with great celerity.</P>
<P>Externally it has often been found to give ease in violent head-achs, by being applied to the part; and to relieve the tooth-ach, by being laid on the afflicted jaw. When it is applied ex∣ternally, procure a bit of linen rag, of such a dimension as to be conveniently covered by the palm of the hand; moisten the rag with the <HI>Aether,</HI> and instantly apply it to the part affected, pressing it very close, so as to prevent the escape of its fumes, for two or three minutes, in which time the rag will be found dry, and may be taken away. It is sometimes applied externally in paralytic cases, gout, rheumatism, flatulent and other disorders of the stomach and bowels.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 9. OPODELDOC.</HEAD>
<P>It is chiefly employed for external purposes, against rheumatic pains, sprains, bruises, and such like complaints.</P>
<P>Rub the part affected well with it, before a fire, and afterwards apply a flannel over it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 10. FRYAR's BALSAM.</HEAD>
<P>This balsam stands highly recommended, ex∣ternally, for cleansing and healing wounds; and likewise internally, for warming and strengthen∣ing the stomach and intestines, and is used often with advantage for colds and coughs.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From twenty to forty or sixty drops, on a lump of sugar, or in any common drink.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 11. ANTIMONY WINE.</HEAD>
<P>The Antimonial Wine possesses the whole virtues of that mineral, and may be so dosed and managed as to perform all that can be effected by any antimonial preparation, with this advantage, that as the active part of the Antimony is here already dissolved, and rendered miscible with the animal fluids, its operation is more certain. Given from ten to fifty or sixty drops, it is an attenuant, alterative, diaphoretic, and diuretic; a few more prove gently cathartic; and two or three drams or tea spoons full, for the most part violently emetic. In general, the Ipecacuanha Powder or Wine is preferred as an <HI>emetic,</HI> being less violent in its operation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 12. TINCTURE OF GUAIACUM,</HEAD>
<P>Is given with great advantage in rheumatic and arthritic complaints, in which cases, and
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>against palsies from lead, Dr. DAWSON extols this tincture as almost a specific. It is given in doses, from a tea to a desert spoonful, morning and evening, in a cup of milk or water gruel.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 13. SALT OF WORMWOOD.</HEAD>
<P>The principal medical effect of Salt of Wormwood is to attenuate the blood and hu∣mours. It destroys acidities in the primae viae, converting them into a mild aperient salt, and thus removes a cause of many chronical diseases. It resolves viscid and glutinous humours, by which, and its gentle stimulus, obstructions are removed, and wherever it passes secretions are promoted.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From five grains to half a dram, and always plentifully diluted with barley water.</P>
<P>It is also used for making Saline Julaps, often beneficial in severs: but as the symptoms of
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>these disorders vary much, medical assistance should be had, as soon as it can be procured. When the symptoms are mild, abstinence in the patient, free dilution, bathing the seet in warm water, and keeping in bed to encourage per∣spiration, with the use of the Saline Julap, will often give nature an opportunity of exerting her force to overcome the disease, and by that means stop the progress; but if there is a good deal of oppression and heat, the pulse full and hard, some sew ounces of blood must be taken away, and of course medical attendance ren∣dered absolutely necessary.</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>A SALINE JULAP.</HEAD>
<L>Take two drams of Salt of Wormwood;</L>
<L>three ounces fresh lemon juice, strained;</L>
</LG>
<P>when the effervescence is over, add four ounces of simple Cinnamon Water, and simple syrup or sugar about half an ounce; mix together, and take three or four table spoons full every three or four hours.</P>
<P>This removes sickness at the stomach, relieves vomiting, promotes perspiration, and may be of service in fevers, especially of the inflammatory kind.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
<HEAD>A VOMITING JULAP.</HEAD>
<P>Dissolve four grains of Emetic Tartar in eight ounces of water, and add to it half an ounce of syrup.</P>
<P>In the beginning of severs, where there is no topical inflammation, this Julap may be given in the dose of one table spoonful every quarter or half of an hour, till it operates. Antimonial vomits serve not only to evacuate the contents of the stomach, but likewise to promote the dif∣ferent excretions: hence they are found in fevers to have nearly the same effects as Dr. JAMES'S Powders.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 14. ASTHMATIC ELIXIR,</HEAD>
<P>For cold coughs, and asthmatic complaints. It allays the tickling, which provokes frequent coughing; and at the same time opens the breast, and gives greater liberty of breathing.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From twenty to sixty drops, two or three times in a day, in a glass of water, or a cup of linseed or liquorice tea.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="medicine">
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 15. ELIXIR OF VITRIOL.</HEAD>
<P>This is a valuable medicine in weakness and relaxation of the stomach, in continual retchings to vomit, and decays of constitution; particularly in those proceeding from irregularities, which are accompanied with slow febrile symptoms, or which follow the suppression of intermittents. It is very usefully conjoined with a decoction of the Bark.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>From ten to thirty or forty drops, taken in a cup of cold spearmint tea, twice or three times in a day, an hour before eating.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 16. LIQUID LAUDANUM,</HEAD>
<P>Should be used very cautiously: it procures sleep, removes obstructions arising from spasms, abates preternatural irritability, and removes
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>convulsions, which arise therefrom; it likewise checks violent purgings.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="dosage">
<HEAD>DOSE.</HEAD>
<P>Five drops to thirty may be given in a cup of water gruel, or bailey water.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD><HI>No.</HI> 17. GOULARD's EXTRACT OF SATURN.</HEAD>
<P>From this preparation is prepared the Vegeto-Mineral Water, so much extolled by Mr. GOULARD, and prepared in the following manner.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VEGETO-MINERAL WATER.</HEAD>
<P>Drop into one quart of distilled water, or Rose Water, one hundred drops of the Extract of Saturn; then add four tea spoons full of brandy, and shake them well together.</P>
<P>This is his famous specific for external inflam∣mations, burns, scalds, chilblains, &amp;c.: when used for an eye-water, it should be more diluted with Rose Water, about half the Vegeto-Mineral Water, and half Rose Water.</P>

<P>The virtues, and the method of using it, are given in directions round the bottle. Useful to remove cholic, flatulency, sickness, loss of appetite, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="medicine">
