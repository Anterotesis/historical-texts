<HEAD>SHORT ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there is nothing should less plead for an apology to the public than addressing them on what so immediately and import∣antly concerns them, the <HI>continuance and restoration of their health;</HI> yet in a metropolis like this, — where the <HI>necessitous,</HI> the <HI>ignorant,</HI> and <HI>adventurous</HI> are every hour practising on the constitutions of their fellow-creatures;—the most distant possibility of my being classed in this number would have prevented this address, was I not at the same time so conscious, from many years absolute experience in a variety of cases, of the superior efficacy of this medicine; that, ab∣stracted from all other considerations, I should hold myself chargeable, in point of duty, to omit making it as universal as possible.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, then, and the corroborating success of this medicine for many years I beg leave to recommend to the Public
<Q>NORRIS's ANTIMONIAL DROPS;</Q> which, upon a certainty of their composition and salu∣tary effects, I pronounce a <HI>specific</HI> in the following
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>disorders — <HI>Inflammatory Fevers, Putrid Bilious Fevers, Slow Latent</HI> (commonly called) <HI>Nervous Fevers,</HI> and <HI>Putrid Sore Throats,</HI> &amp;c. insomuch that, in a vast variety of cases, where life has been often despaired of, and un∣der some of the most respectable of the faculty, there has been no one instance (at least that has ever come to my knowledge) of their being found ineffectual.</P>
<P>I am however aware, that, from the <HI>title</HI> of this medicine, many may have their doubts; as <HI>Antimony,</HI> of all other physical productions, has been consi∣dered as the most violent, and dangerous in it's effects: I will not contradict this popular appre∣hension; on the contrary, I think it generally well founded; but this I will pledge myself to say, that from my particular manner of preparing it, it's <HI>efficacy</HI> can only be equalled by it's <HI>safety;</HI> that it is a medicine of such singular or <HI>unique</HI> quality, that it may be taken with equal safety in infancy or old age, by delicate or robust constitutions in small or large quantities; and so far from producing any of those violent operations, the usual effects of Antimony, it recovers nature in the most friendly manner imaginable, operating without any sensible difference than a degree of perspiration, &amp;c. propor∣tioned to the necessity of the disease.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that, upon many occasions, in fevers, physicians are obliged to wait for what they call the crisis of the disorder, and many days are often elapsed in this intermediate, doubtful state, before any thing can be pronounced in respect to an opinion on the patient; but this medicine is so immediate, yet
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>innocent, in it's effects, that it waits for no crisis or particular period; it may be taken in the first, mid∣dle, or latter stages of the disorder, and in any quan∣tities, with safety; in short, it wants but to meet the disease to give it an absolute overthrow.</P>
<P>From these <HI>positive</HI> declarations, I am not insen2ible what a risque I may be thought to run, both in re∣spect to my own character and fortune; and indeed I should feel myself unworthy not only of the public patronage I have received, but of the common bene∣fits of mankind, could I be so lost to my own honour and conscience, for the mere sake of interested views, thus to recommend a medicine, which I even remotely doubted of it's success; but the repeated proofs I have had of it's <HI>never-failing efficacy,</HI> it's immediate, powerful, and safe effects, all give me a consciousness of communicating it to the world under the most po∣sitive and certain assurances.</P>
<P>These drops, besides being a specific for fevers, I have often known succeed in a variety of other dis∣orders, such as <HI>bad digestion, nervous head-aches, latent scurvies,</HI> (the source of many evils) and infallably in <HI>gouty habits,</HI> where <HI>insensible perspiration</HI> is suppressed. And indeed when the extent of their powers, as an universal deobstruent, which lead to a general strengthening and restoration of nature, are consi∣dered, the universality of their effects will cease to be wondered at.</P>
<P>Having thus given a summary account of the virtues of these <HI>Antimonial Drops,</HI> I am aware of the objections which will naturally arise from a compara∣tive
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>view of the general mode of medicinal admini∣stration, and that which prevails in this essay: I am likewise aware of the formidable opposition which every great discovery in medicine must unavoidably meet with, not only from it's opposition to established practice, but the uncharitable endeavours of interested men, who, under the specious pretence of it's not being in <HI>common use,</HI> have invariably reprobated all such (however beneficial to mankind) as dangerous or uncertain. Though the <HI>use</HI> of these <HI>Antimonial Drops</HI> would be a convincing answer to such insinuations; yet, as many have not experienced their effects; and as I would willingly obviate every difficulty, as well for the sake of my own reputation as the satisfaction of the Public; I shall submit the following apology for my conduct.</P>
<P>It is generally objected to those, who have labour∣ed through a painful course of years, and have been at great expences in the discovery, and preparation of medicine, that to make a mystery for private emolu∣ment of what so essentially affects public benefit, is repugnant to those principles of universal charity, which should actuate the human breast:—This, at first blush, I own seems plausible, but then it should be considered, that the <HI>means</HI> of throwing this into <HI>Com∣mon Use,</HI> may destroy its effects; as the excellency of a medicine depends not so much on the subject from which it is taken, as the great care and judgement in the preparation. A common chemist, in shorten∣ing the necessary period of preparation, dispensing with accidents substituting apparently-similar bo∣dies
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>or by any of those various means, which may save his time, or increase his profits, may think himself sufficiently justified for so doing by <HI>the usage of trade:</HI> But the more careful chemist, con∣scious that the least accident or mismanagement is frequently sufficient to extinguish the virtues of his process, and having nothing so much at heart, as the credit of his medicine, is barred by no labour, no time, no expences, no disappointments, in bringing to perfection this his favourite object.</P>
<P>Permit me then to rank myself in this last class, who, from dedicating the best part of my life to Che∣mical processes, must necessarily be supposed to be well acquainted with the minutest preparation of me∣dicine; and on the credit of this experience let me add; that, what from the judgment and accuracy required, together with the many accidents to which it is liable, the process of my <HI>Antimonial Drops</HI> can scarcely be compleated in the way of <HI>Common business.</HI> This consideration then alone, I flatter myself, will fully justify my conduct to the judicious and im∣partial part of mankind.</P>
<P>I have already been sufficiently explicit in enu∣merating the virtues of this medicine; I do not therefore mean to take up any more of the attention of the Public; otherwise, than as the PRESERVATION and RESTORATION of health form the principal and greatest blessing of life, that they strictly examine into it's merits. If it turns out to be productive of those benefits I have mentioned; surely I cannot be thought presuming to expect that a public reward should follow so public a benefit. If on the contrary I should
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>be found one of those forward daring empyricks, who are heedless what sacrifices they make to their own interests; let me be branded with that infamy, which those who endeavour to deceive mankind in such important matters deserve.</P>
<P>And here I beg leave to request all those who have honoured me with their confidence, and who by ex∣perience or observation are vouchers of the efficacy of this medicine, to favor me with their names and address, that, by the permitted publication of such authority, to be from time to time added to this essay, I may be the better enabled to render as universal as possible so great a benefit to mankind.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>F.</HI> a respectable tradesman in the city of Lon∣don. His daughter, a weakly delicate child, about five years of age, was sorely afflicted with a swelled stomach, and constipation in her bowels; together with indigestion, a Slow Fever, and a sharp corrosive humour in her blood. To the inexpressible joy of her parents, who had despaired of her recove∣ry, she is happily restored to health, by the virtues of this invaluable medicine. Two of his servants were cured of a Putrid Fever; the one in his own house, very speedily, and went about his business in a few days; the other soon after was attacked with the same disorder: for reasons best known to his master he sent him to Islington, and put him under the care of an apothecary there, but hearing very un∣favorable accounts of him daily, he went to see him, and sent for the apothecary, who told him, among other things, that his Fever was a very dangerous one, and must wait for a crisis, &amp;c. This not ap∣pearing satisfactory to the old gentleman, he dis∣charged the apothecary, and immediately sent for me.
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>Let it suffice to say that I was under the necessity of giving this young man three times more in quantity of the Drops than is ordinarily prescribed, before the desired effect was produced; he began to take them about eight o clock in the morning, and between that and five in the evening he had taken four fifths of a half guinea bottle, without their having the least sensible effect; he then called for a large bason of tea, which he drank, and about six had a very profuse sweat, in which he continued the whole night, and slept comfortably. I made him a visit the next day, and found him equal to my wishes; and the day following pronounced him out of danger, which I reported to his master.

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>This young man after bleeding, blistering, leeches applied to his temples, and every other means in common practice made use of to no good purpose; his brother, with whom he lives, was advised to try in this desperate case my Antimonial Drops; he made some enquiries about me at the Carolina Coffee-house in Birchin-lane, where I frequently go when in the city; satisfied with Mr. Carr's, and several gentlemens re∣port of me there, the Drops were immediately ad∣minister'd according to directions; the next day I happened to call at the coffee-house, when Mr. Carr, who keeps it, after reciting what had past, was sorry to inform me the young man was no better, and then past all hope; that as I was so near he thought it ad∣viseable I should call; I did; and, never did I see a human being so near death: I could feel no pulse; he lay on his back with his eyes wide open and fixed, speechless, and motionless to all appearance. Being the first instance of my Antimonial Drops failing in Fevers, at least that ever came to my knowledge, made me more particularly inquisitive about the administra∣tion of them, when, (to my great surprize) the bro∣ther of my patient assured me with much concern, they
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>were administered according to directions, and he had taken of nothing else since, <HI>but the apothecary's stuffs, as he called them,</HI> every two hours, as they were di∣rected to be given. There was no time to be lost in reproof; it was now one o'clock at noon, I imme∣diately dispatched a messenger to Mr. Parker's, for a half guinea bottle of Drops, a table spoonful of which was poured down that instant, with di∣rections, if he lived an hour and an half, to re∣peat it, and continue to give him that quantity every two hours after, till a sweat or some visible signs of amendment were discovered; and then to dimi∣nish the dose gradually; that no other medicine should be administered on any account, but, to let him have as much baum tea, or any simple di∣luting liquor as they could get down, by little and little, every now and then; the blunder committed before, made them now doubly diligent and punctual; I called the next day, and found the Fever was quite gone; but such a lassitude and stupidity re∣mained as exceeds all description. The nurse in∣formed me he lay very quiet till five o'clock; about six, he began to perspire, and continued so to do the whole night plentifully; sleeping all the time; which from his laying very still and motionless, and as she thought breathless too, made her several times conclude he was dead, till by laying on her hand every now and then she was satisfied to the con∣trary. I then ordered the Drops to be given very sparingly, not above twenty or thirty, every two or three hours, till I called the next day, when I pro∣nounced him out of danger, and ordered him to be
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>wrapped up in a blanket, put into a carriage, and taken somewhere to breathe a purer air as soon as possible, which was accordingly done the next day. He soon gathered strength, and in a few days was able to return to his business, and has continued ever since in good health and spirits.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>This gentleman informed me, that from Africa to St. Kitt's, he had lost upwards of seventy slaves, not being able to prevail on the surgeon to admi∣nister my Antimonial Drops to them. When he arrived at St. Kitt's the doctor quitted the ship, and the captain then had about seventy slaves left, which he was to take to Carolina: in the passage ten or twelve of them were seized with the same Fever the others died of; being then with∣out a surgeon, he had recourse to my Antimonial Drops, which recovered them; verily believing, if
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>timely administered, nine out of ten of those that were lost might have been saved. These Drops were sent, by way of experiment, at the instance of a worthy gentleman, a merchant in the city, much in∣terested in African affairs, and under the peculiar care of Captain Reynolds, the only one, he said, he could depend upon to make a just report; before which, and since, several small boxes were sent to merchants at Liverpool, for the same purpose, and some few from the port of London also; but, strange to tell! when immediately under the care and admi∣nistration of the surgeon, all their influence were gone, and they became of none effect. It would be no very easy matter to prevail upon many commanders of ships who sail without surgeons, to credit this report from their own experience. This I am very well assured of, and could venture my credit, reputation, and fortune, upon the event, that if the surgeons of ships were actuated by the same disinterested principles; my Antimonial Drops would prove a great acquisi∣tion not only to the African company in preserving their negroes, but the lives of thousands subject to putrid fevers in hot climates.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="22"/>of the effects of your Antimonial Drops, in the course of my late voyage to and from Falkland's Island.</P>
<P>In the outward passage, by the surgeon of the ship's report to me, of the 5th of April last, it appeared, that Geo. Hunter, and Laur. Pittman, two of the seamen, were taken ill with Malignant Fevers; that having for several days been given the usual medicines without effect, he thought them past a possibility of recovery; judging this a fit opportunity to make a trial of the efficacy of your drops, (for notwithstanding the recommenda∣tions which were given me of them, and which induced me to take them with me, I had resolved to let every usual means take place before I gave them) I then therefore gave a bottle to the surgeon, and desired they might be administered; he said, it would, he believed, be of little consequence whatever was given them, as he thought they could not live to the next day, however, he would try them; the next morning, in his account to me of the sick, he told me the men were much better, and he believed they would recover, which from that time they did, and were soon after able to do their duty in the ship.</P>
<P>On the 27th of July following, being in the southern part of the Torrid zone, Mr. Joslin, the boatswain of the ship, was taken ill of the same Fever, with the like symptoms as the two former, and after the surgeon had represented to me, that he had used all the means in his power for his re∣covery,
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>to no purpose, the Antimonial Drops were given, and had the desired effect, by his imme∣diate recovery.</P>
<P>Sometime afterwards, in the southern ocean, Ja. Hamm, and Evan Williams, the one a boy, the other a marine, were seized with a fever, and were, by the surgeons report to me, given over for many days; the Drops were given them also, which pro∣duced a plentiful sweating, and their immediate recovery. Such repeated success gives me the highest opinion of the virtues and efficacy of your Antimonial Drops, and on these grounds I cannot too strongly recommend them.</P>
<P>I also enclose you the surgeon's attestation taken from the journals of his practice in the ship, and which, as well as this letter, you are at liberty to make public. Wishing you every success,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, SIR, Your most obedient humble servant," JN. STOTT.</SIGNED>

<SALUTE>"Much respected Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THY favour, with a box of Antimonial Drops, I received by means of our Friend Eyre, about 16 last 12 mo. They have gained great reputation in these parts, and being the time of our general assembly in Newbern, and my own ac∣quaintance being very extensive in this province, I had an opportunity of recommending them to many people; carried some to our good governor Mar∣tin. Immediately on receiving them, I gave some to my own child, about two years old, who was feverish, and much out of order. Every one in my family could observe a sudden change for the better: I have continued to give him a few at times, and the child is brave and hearty. Another child, about twelve months old, that had been long sick, had lost all appetite, I advised them, which in a few days recovered his health and appe∣tite. A negro man in my own employ, about 23 years of age, by much wading in the water, got a severe pleurisy; it being about 20 miles from where I reside myself, they bled him, after some days sweated him; he went out before his sweat was off, and grew so bad, they sent me word they thought he would die. I immediately dispatched orders to
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>give him the Antimonial drops, and he soon reco∣vered.</P>
<P>Two persons, that had them of me, were cured of stubborn coughs, which, I believe, would soon have terminated in consumptions.</P>
<P>A married woman, not with child, catched a considerable cold, which occasioned a suppression of the m—, with fever and great pains. I ad∣vised the use of the drops, which soon abated the pains, fever, and head-ach, and in about two days time set nature to act for herself in the natural way.</P>
<P>I mention those few particulars, more for the conviction of others than thy own confirmation. Indeed, for my own part, I believe the drops to be the most sovereign remedy ever yet found out, for what thou recommends them, and may prove advantageous in many cases which are not mentioned in thy directions."</P>

<P>FROM extreme weakness, and a total loss of ap∣petite, I was reduced to so deplorable a state that I had five successive miscarriages; in my sixth pregnancy your Antimonial drops were administered, which restored my appetite and digestion, and strength∣ened me to my full time in a happy delivery.

<P>"I Had for many years a violent scorbutic hu∣mour, which at last not only grew troublesome, but occasioned my breaking out in blotches, with continual itching, attended with a heaviness and sudden heats, particularly after eating, so that I became very disagreeeble to myself. After six weeks application of these drops I felt every desired benefit, and am now in a better state of health and vigour than I ever had before. I have administered with my own hands the drops to many people in Fevers; in all I have succeeded, and in some cases where the patients have been greatly despaired of.

<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>William Norris,</HI> Esq; of Nonesuch, Willshire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you seem desirous of communicating to the public the observations which have been made by those who have either taken themselves, or administered to others, your Antimonial prepa∣ration, (of which so formidable a notion has been entertained) I cannot but think it incumbent on me, in consequence of the good effects I have experienced from it, both in myself and family, to transmit you a short account of the result. With regard to myself, my constitution is rather valetu∣dinary, and has been so as long as I can remem∣ber. It is now about fifteen years since it was first invaded by the gout, which I think I may call hereditary, as I cannot accuse myself of any irre∣gularities adequate to the severity with which I have been visited by this formidable enemy.</P>
<P>Among many causes that combine to bring on the gout, I was always of opinion, that <HI>an ob∣strncted perspiration was one.</HI> To remove this, I was advised, <HI>when perspiration was suppressed, to take your Antimonial Drops frequently and plen∣tifully; these, by promoting a good digestion, and it's consequent attendant, a brisk circulation of the fluids, kept open my pores, which before, upon any sudden change in the air from heat to cold, were generally closed.</HI></P>
<P>In the fits of the gout I frequently take them in small quantities, and find them <HI>promote, assisted
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>by small dilutive liquors, sensible perspiration in a high degree; and, upon any uneasy sensations in the stomach or bowels, during the fit, they seldom fail to remove the cause.</HI> In Fevers, either Putrid or Inflammatory, frequent occasions have offered to try their effects in a numerous family of my own; and, from repeated experience, I never found them fail of success, and that by removing the disease in a very few days.</P>
<P>Thus much I am warranted to say in their fa∣vour, and think them possessed of much greater virtues than even I have described.</P>

<P>"TO be silent where the health of mankind is concerned, I deem a crime; must therefore return you my sincere thanks for the great advan∣tage I and my son experienced, within these few months, from the use of your justly esteemed An∣timonial Drops, we were both attacked with a pu∣trid fever and sore throat, he in particular so bad that he became delirious; but, on taking a proper dose, or two of the Drops, both were in a few hours much relieved, and in a short time restored to perfect health. Beside my own experience of their salutary effects, I have known several since that have been cured by them of Fevers, and in consequence I take the liberty of recommending
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>them strongly to all persons labouring under such disorders, as one of the most sovereign remedies. If you think proper, you have my permission to make this letter publick, as it is but doing common justice to that heavenly medicine, and my fellow creatures also.</P>

<P>I Was greatly oppressed with a bilious disorder, and severely afflicted with an hereditary gout; insomuch that for the most part of my time I was rendered incapable of doing any business, 'till by the generous effects of your Antimonial Drops my bilious complaints are removed; and each fit of the gout rendered so short, by supporting a gentle perspiration universally, when it came on, which they never yet failed to do in all my experience of them. I have used them, at times, these five years and never enjoyed a better state of health than since I have taken of them; wishing the same good effects on others that I have experienced from them,</P>

<P>I Have read your late publication on the virtues of your Antimonial Drops. In justice to the me∣dicine, and in compliance to truth, I think it my duty to give the following account of them within my own knowledge.</P>
<P>I had a Slow Fever upon me for several years, and could find no relief. When I heard of the efficacy of your Drops, I immediately got a bottle, and took them as directed; in a few hours I found relief, and in a short time after a perfect cure. It is now upwards of two years, and I never had the least return. I have since administered them to my spouse and niece, both in violent Fevers; a copious sweat ensued, and the Fever ceased in a few hours, without a relapse. Finding their effi∣cacy such, I recommended them to several friends, to half a score at least, in similar cases, in all which they had the desired effect; I do not know of their failing in a single instance. This you have my permission to publish for the good of mankind.</P>
