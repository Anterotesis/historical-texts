<HEAD>A NEW ESSAY ON THE SMALL-POX.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Very Person is sensible, how fatal the Disease I insist on, hath been these late Years; and perhaps there is not a Family in the Kingdom, that laments not the Spoils of it; which is sufficient to justify every honest At∣tempt, to free the Publick from such a Ca∣lamity.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<P>I shall not enter into the Dispute about Ino∣culation, which is now on the Carpet; by reason what I have in my Views, is the su∣perseding any Occasion for that Operation; which, if it could be obtain'd, must, on ma∣ny Accounts, be preferr'd to the general Pra∣ctice of it; and render it more safe in the few Instances, wherein, after all, it may be esteem'd proper.</P>
<P>In order to introduce this Proposal, I think it necessary to observe what gave me the first Hint, and is the real Foundation of it; <HI>viz. That the Distemper it self is both of a Fo∣reign Extract, and of a late Origin.</HI> There are some Parts of the World entirely unac∣quainted with it at this Day; and we are assur'd, one Quarter of it (viz. <HI>America</HI>) was so, till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> subdued it; when, by the Infection of a Negro, this cruel Disease spread it self among the Natives, and hath now almost extirpated great and populous Clans.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Physicians had no Idea of this Disorder; For we have the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>first Descriptions of it from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Wri∣ters. I confess, we read of Eruptions in Fe∣vers; and have Reason to think these obtain'd in ancient Time. I know not whether what we term the <HI>Chicken-Pox,</HI> may not be a pro∣per critical Secretion of some Humours in Children; for they often affect them, with∣out any previous Contagion, and are attend∣ed with no ill Consequence. But the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> (who, every Person knows, by their sordid, nasty way of Living, in a hot Climate, have turn'd common Fevers into Plagues;) have perhaps, in the same man∣ner, given that malignant, contagious Effi∣cacy, to those Mild and Natural Pu∣stules.</P>
<P>From this Account of the Case, it must evidently follow, that the Distemper I now treat of, <HI>is One Species of a Plague;</HI> and therefore both <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>ought,</HI> in the same Manner, to be extirpated from the Na∣tion.</P>
<P>The late Experiments of Inoculating it, confirm this Account; and, at the same Time, sufficiently demonstrate, how small a Seed,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>less than the Hundredth Part of a Grain, will produce a very plentiful Crop. It's true, this may differ very much, in regard of the Soil; which is a Consideration, in Favour of a Practice, that allows us a con∣venient Opportunity to prepare the Body, and to adjust both the Quantity and Situation of the Particles, that are thrown into it. But why shou'd we <HI>generally</HI> cultivate after this manner an <HI>Eastern</HI> Plant, that hath made such dreadful Havock among us? Especially since there is so much Reason to question, whether we could promise our selves that Success, if it were <HI>universally</HI> in Use: For, the Contagion must increase in Proportion to the Subjects; whereas, on the other hand, when the Disease hath left us, the few who (on the Account of Travelling, or Physick) may have leave to go through the Opera∣tion, will run less Hazard in it.</P>
<P>I confess, there will be a Difficulty in o∣vercoming popular Prejudices, in Favour of these Disorders. They esteem them sent of God, for the Sins of Mankind; which is a pious Account of all our Afflictions. But when this Representation discourages the pro∣per
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>Endeavours to remove them; it hath ge∣nerally been esteem'd, in other Cases, a cri∣minal Abuse of the Doctrine. This is per∣fectly the Case in <HI>Turkey;</HI> where, for that Reason, their great Towns are no more free from the Plague, than ours are from the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> But I have the Pleasure to ob∣serve, that <HI>the Articles of the Church of England</HI> prudently caution us against this Construction of the Sentence of Predestina∣nation; <HI>which, for Curious and Carnal Per∣sons to have before their Eyes,</HI> is there said to be, <HI>a great Downfall.</HI> But I leave the Management of this Argument to our Di∣vines.</P>
<P>When our People are well reconcil'd to the Religion of the Thing, there can, perhaps, be nothing more easy or safe, than to deliver us from the Infection. For, the Substance of my Proposal is but, in short,
<Q>To take the Method, that was insisted on as necessary to deliver us from the Plague, if it had been imported among us; <HI>as we appre∣hended it might, from</HI> Marseilles.</Q></P>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<P>The Thing is then so far done, that I have Reason to hope, and say, A few Generations hence would enquire, what Sort of Distemper their Ancestors intended, by the Name of the <HI>Small-Pox?</HI> And when so great an Advantage may be procur'd by it; there can be nothing unkind, or difficult, only <HI>in obliging the At∣tendants and Physicians, where the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>are, to perform a Sort of</HI> Quarantain; <HI>to bury the Furniture, and purify the Houses;</HI> which is all that will be requir'd, and to which they will have sufficient Inducement to consent, if the Loss they sustain by it, is but supported by the Publick. I know not whether an <HI>Office of Insurance</HI> might not be establish'd for that Purpose: But this will be the Care of the Legislature, if our Physicians do but come in∣to the Scheme: They are the only Persons that will suffer, in a profitable Branch of their Practice. But whatever some impudent Quacks may have in their View, I have the Assurance to say, The Gentlemen of the Faculty, up∣on the Principles of the New Philosophy, and the best Experience, will esteem this Propo∣sal worthy their Consideration. They know very well, that when the Eruption is com∣pleated,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>and the putrid Particles have fix'd on the Lungs, and vital Parts, the Event must be left to Nature; for there is little Room for the Exercise of the best Skill: And upon that Account, they must be pleas'd with an Expedient, that will secure their Art from the Tryals, that are vain in themselves, and often fatal to their Reputation. As for the Scandal of our Profession, the Men who have no Comfort but in Filth and Ordure, and are only Caterers for the Worms; I am not a∣sham'd to confess, I have shew'd no regard to their mercenary Ends.</P>
<P>It is to the very Learned and Worthy-Bo∣dy, I submit this Proposal; who will, I am persuaded, at least honourably treat a Plan, that is form'd upon the Practice of some of the Ancient Physicians, the Fathers and first Ornaments of this Science; who did not on∣ly consult particular Cases, but <HI>deliver'd whole Nations at once from Plagues.</HI> If the Method I have suggested appears to them as well cal∣culated for this Purpose, as it's honestly de∣sign'd; I have no Reason to doubt the Appro∣bation of Persons of such a generous and gen∣teel
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>Education, and whose Business is the Health of the People.</P>
<P>I know, the Fate of this Scheme will de∣pend on their Representation of it; and there∣fore, by reason <HI>The Royal College of Physicians</HI> are best qualify'd to direct the Execution, I have not presum'd to offer the <HI>particular Rules</HI> that must be observ'd, and that will require the Sanction of the Legislature: It is what, I do not doubt, they will favour their Coun∣try with, if this Proposal is so happy as to come recommended by them.</P>
<P><HI>His Most Sacred Majesty,</HI> whom God long preserve; and Their <HI>Royal Highnesses,</HI> tho' they are now in no pain for the <HI>Princes,</HI> the young Hopes and Joys of these Realms; They have too much Regard for their People, not to encourage every Thing that may make them Happy and Healthful.</P>
<P>And I hope our <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> will esteem it too much a common Interest, to neglect this Proposal, if there is a Prospect (as, I think, there is a very good one) in this Way of being secure from this Distemper,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>and, at the same Time, from a Train of E∣vils and Ulcers, that generally attend the worst Sort of it. For why shou'd we cherish the cruel Brood of <HI>Africa</HI> or <HI>Asia</HI> in our Bow∣els, that have made those frightful Ravages a∣mong us, and entail this Poison on our Poste∣rity, that was, perhaps, the Import of our Holy Wars in former Days?</P>
<P>How great must be the Happiness to ob∣serve the new Scenes arise, when a noisome Plague shall cease to <HI>change our Countenances, and send us away, or to make us a Terror to our selves and others!</HI> How desirable would it be, no more (unless by the special Commis∣sion of Heaven) to feel any of the Fury of it, filling our Graves, or spoiling our Fea∣tures? We shou'd not then so frequently meet the dismal Scars, and indelible Characters, it hath left on almost every Face: But <HI>Britain,</HI> no longer inhabited by these Sort of <HI>Picts,</HI> would become <HI>Fair Albion</HI> once again.</P>
<P>Then, to use the sacred Stile, <HI>may our Sons be as Plants grown up in their Youth;</HI> they will always carry their first Bloom; <HI>and our Daugh∣ters as Corner-stones, polish'd after the similitude
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>of a Palace;</HI> or, in our Language, more smooth and sparkling than the best-wrought Marble. Then would all the Domestick Virtues flou∣rish: The Beautiful Mothers, secure of the Affection of their Husbands, wou'd convey the healthy Treasure to their Offspring: The La∣dies wou'd shine in our Assemblies; and the Gentlemen soften, under their Influence, into every Virtue. Let future Ages tell the rest with Joy!</P>
<P>Full of this Project, I can't forbear ima∣ging to my self the Acknowledgments of a whole Island; and every Person in it, contri∣buting to make my Life easy and happy, who have in this Proposal studied to make theirs so.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I wrote this Scheme, I was ve∣ry sensible of some considerable Ob∣jections, which a Learned Gentleman, who is a Glory to the Profession, did me the Ho∣nour to make to it: As, <HI>That the Seeds of the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>are almost in every House, which hath made it the Disease of the Country.</HI> But how much soever they are naturaliz'd to the Soil, and have diffus'd themselves in it; I have Reason to hope, Care and Industry might surmount this Difficulty. For, the Particles appear, by their slow Operation, not to have that Life and Action, which those have which constitute the Plague: If every House, there∣fore, in <HI>Great Britain</HI> (that is suspected) would but submit to <HI>such a Purification</HI> as the <HI>Inspir'd Lawgiver</HI> (I had almost said <HI>Physician</HI>) pre∣scrib'd in another Species of a Plague, <HI>Le∣vit.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>xiii. 47, 48, &amp;c. and xiv. 33, &amp;c. we might observe the happy Effects of it, not only in destroying the Vegetation of the Seeds of this Distemper, but of some others, which subsist in Rags and Dirt. In general, it must render the Nation more clean and healthful: And why should not a <HI>Divine Law,</HI> as far as it re∣lates <HI>immediately to Health,</HI> lay us under a Moral Obligation now, where there is any Parity in the Case, as I apprehend in the pre∣sent? Our Criticks may observe with Plea∣sure, the <HI>Arabian</HI> Physicians apply to the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> some of the Terms which occur in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Version of these Chapters. If it is said, The Priests were to execute the Sa∣cred Order; it is, because <HI>They</HI> were the An∣cient <HI>Physicians.</HI> But it is not my Business here to consider the typical Use of it.</P>
<P>I apprehend it will be urged, That after all this Care, when they are extirpated in one Place, they may possibly break out in another. It is what may be expected for some Time, and will only require a more constant Attendance on this Distemper through the whole Island: In which this Advantage will probably be gain'd; That whenever it does
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>sprout in any Quarter, there will be the great∣est Reason to expect, where the Soil is not too favourable, (if I may be allow'd to pursue a Figure that will best explain it to the com∣mon Reader) it will be a weak and tender Shoot, which we may easily weed out, and not one rank Crop upon another, as we some∣times experience now.</P>
<P>As for the Time that will be requir'd to ac∣complish all this; it can't be suppos'd I shou'd presume to determine it: For, our Physicians know, it was several Years before we were rid of the last Plague. It is sufficient, that the Affair is of so much Consequence, that the Children who are yet unborn demand our Attention to it.</P>
<P>The greatest Objection is from the Preju∣dices of the People; who are inclin'd to think every Abridgment of their Liberty, tho' it is for their Advantage, inhuman and bar∣barous. But in this Instance, I know not how it is; Persons of Quality and Fortune, and very many of the Populace, are almost come into this Practice of themselves, from their own Observations and Reasonings upon the
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>Head. The Husband and Wife, we have seen content to live apart for a Time; or, if they are determin'd against it, they might perhaps be indulg'd to perform the <HI>Quarantain</HI> toge∣ther.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews,</HI> as stiff-neck'd and rebellious a People as they are represented in the Holy Writings, had so much regard to their Health, as to submit to a much severer <HI>Regimen.</HI> For there is a vast Difference between a Separa∣tion from Society for a few Days, which is all this Scheme requires; and theirs, which in some Cases continued for Life.</P>
<P>I can't doubt, the Worthy and Learned Col∣lege of Physicians, if they came into the Pro∣posal, wou'd take care to direct the Execution of it, to a general Satisfaction: And upon this Account, if the Legislature made them a Sort of <HI>Office of Insurance;</HI> the Contributions they would receive from the whole Nation, and the Voluntary Benefactions of very many, to whose Families this Distemper hath been fa∣tal, would, I'm persuaded, render them very capable of discharging that Service, by their Agents, with great Applause. I might sug∣gest
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>the Pleasure they must have by that Cor∣respondence this would establish, to observe the State of Diseases and Physick through the whole Nation, and to direct the Practice of it in this Instance: Which last is a Consi∣deration of too much Weight, not to be of∣fer'd to the Publick: For, if any Thing can, it must reconcile every Person to this Propo∣sal; That He, and his Relations, tho' they are the meanest of the People, (among whom this Distemper generally lodges) will have proper Medicines and Attendance, and be∣come the Care of the most Learned Body of Physicians in the World.</P>
