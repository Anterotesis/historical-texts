<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Discovering the great efficacy of the recrements of the body, to the digestion of our food, the cir∣culation of the blood, and the secretion of the alimentary fluids.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM sensible that few physicians have exa∣mined those recrements of the body with that attention, accuracy, and diligence, that a point of so great importance requires; and though they are many and divers, yet they all contribute their share to the maceration, attenu∣ation, and digestion of our aliments in the mouth; to the greater liquidation of the chyle in the stomach and intestines; to the more perfect fusion of the blood in the veins and arteries; and the better secretion of the various juices, separated and collected in the different folliculi or receptacles, situated in the various organs of the body, and which are ordained by nature, to serve very great, and important uses in the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>These recrements are distinguished from the excremen∣titious discharges, as the latter are thrown out of the body, and of no further use in support of the several re∣spective parts of the animal, and which therefore are called the excrements: while the former serve many great and necessary purposes in life; so that I question whether any animal circulation, secretion, or excretion, could be carried on, without the assistance of these recrements; for all the motions of the chyle, blood, and animal juices, would stagnate and stand still in an instant, were it not for the saliva, bile, pancreatic juice, and divers other fluids secreted from the arterial blood: And as these se∣creted fluids are the main principles that support the life
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>of animals; so in the most noxious, venomous, and poi∣sonous creatures, where the great mischief is done by a bite, and the infusion of a poisonous fluid into the wound, as is done by the viper; then, upon reflection, we discover that there must necessarily be a counter poison, generated and secreted somewhere in the body itself, to preserve this noxious animal from the force and deadly effects of its own poison.</P>
<P>But of all the various separations and secretions, I know none of so much consequence to the body, as that secreted liquor, we call the saliva, or what is generally meant by the fasting spittle, as will more clearly appear when we come to speak of its effects and consequences upon the bodies of rational animals; for without this secreted fluid, we could neither chew our victuals, nor swallow our food into the stomach, nor digest it, after it was there; so that all the motions of the body will grow dry, stagnate, and be at perpetual rest, were not our several aliments mixed, attenuated, and sufficiently diluted in the mouth, by the penetrating salts of the salival fluid, before they are swal∣lowed down into the stomach.</P>
<P>And though of late, we have heard of mighty feats being done by the virtues of crude mercury, tar-water, and divers other quack medicines, sold up and down this town, with royal patents, and dignified titles; yet I question, whether in the gravel, stone, gout, and rheumatism, there ever yet was, or at this time is; or in times to come shall be discovered a medicine more valuable in the fore∣going diseases, than what I now offer for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>And the patient may assure himself, that, if these rules and cautions, laid down in the following pages, are but rightly pursued, and duly executed, they will mightily contribute, not only to preserve him in health, but also prove extremely efficacious to restore that invaluable bles∣sing, whenever over powered by the force of a disease. And, in all these cases, I find little occasion for the use of medicine, provided the patient eats his crust punctually in a morning fasting, and is observing of the air, diet and exercise I have set before him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> Of the Virtues of a Crust of Bread, eat early in a morning fasting, with its force and efficacy in relieving the scurvy, gravel, stone, gout, rheumatism, and various other diseases</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM now going to speak of a remedy second to none, in the cure and relief given in the forego∣ing diseases: It may indeed serve other intentions and purposes as far as I know, but in the gravel, stone, gout, and rheumatism, I know it to be the best and surest remedy hitherto discovered; and if you join fasting to this noble medicine, I know none more effica∣cious: Would you know this valuable secret, it is absti∣nence: I say abstinence;—but by the word abstinence, I do not mean a mere negative remedy, as if fasting was to do all the work herself, by suffering nature, in due course of time, to resolve the obstructions, and, at her leisure, to digest off the viscid juices and corrupt humours; for ab∣stinence is only necessary as an assistant, both to improve the operation, and enable the Crust of Bread, eat early in a morning fasting, to exert its virtues with more salutary effects: For all medicines operate best upon an empty stomach, and few purging medicines are advised, if they are greatly efficacious but that they are prescribed to be taken in a morning early, and the first thing that the pa∣tient does; and he is often advised not to eat till two or three hours after.</P>
<P>I chuse to express myself, in the vulgar manner of speech, because the visible relief given in the gravel or stone is usually ascribed to the Bread alone, and not to any other assistant remedy mixed with it in the mouth, or in its passage to the stomach, and so into the blood: For it is a truth, established by constant observation and expe∣rience, that divers persons, by eating a Crust of Bread in a morning early, and fasting two or three hours after it, have received great relief in the gravel; others have de∣clared, that under the stone their severest symptoms have been mightily mitigated; and some again, under the most painful symptoms of the gout and rheumatism, have found their pains greatly relieved by adhering to this remedy, and applying chewed bread, well moistened with the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>fasting saliva, warm to the gouty parts: And I do not speak these things of two or three people only, that have accidentally been thus relieved, but of hundreds, nay, I may say thousands, that within my own knowledge, have received great benefit from this invaluable and salutary medicine.</P>
<P>Now to examine the main point, and enquire upon what principles this great relief is given; for if we consider the Bread itself, this concrete can have no efficacy, at one time more than another; if the efficacy, I say, proceeds from the intrinsical principles of the Bread; for then a Crust eat at five or six in the afternoon, or at a proper distance from our meals, must produce the same effects upon the urinary passages; upon the obstructions of the joints and membranes of the muscles, that it does, when eat in a morning fasting; and therefore we are to consider whether this virtue and efficacy, supposed to be lodged in the bread, may not more properly be owing to some other assisting cause, than to the piece of Bread itself; for we know very well, that the matter of fact is so, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Crust of Bread, eat early in a morning fasting, does pro∣duce these good effects in the aforesaid diseases; and if we search into the virtues of Bread, and consider what ingredients there is in a Crust, we shall not discover any virtues in the Bread, more than to nourish the body; for the purest wheat, when changed into never so many dif∣ferent forms, only produces a more elegant nourishment: This is the prime law of its nature, and therefore we can∣not suppose that the Bread itself can contain any powers capable of producing these principles of dissolution of the gravel, attenuation of the phlegm, and mitigation of the painful symptoms of the stone; and therefore I must con∣clude, that the Bread itself does not contain any principles powerful enough to accomplish that great relief, that is often received from eating a Crust of Bread in a morning early; for then its great efficacy would sensibly appear, from the great quantities we eat of this aliment, in our several meals, at morning, noon, and night: And hence I infer, that the good that is known to ensue from eating the Bread, must be the result of somewhat that accom∣panies the Bread, and that we can conceive to be nothing but the fasting saliva, which leads me to speak of the origin, secretion, and composition of this fluid, or what
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>we vulgarly call the fasting spittle; as it is a fluid that serves divers great and important purposes in the animal</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> Of the origin, secretion, and composition of the Fasting saliva, as the fluid that first mixes with the Bread, in the mouth; in its passage through the gula; and in its descent into the stomach, as the sole cause of the fore∣going salutary effects.</HEAD>
<P>I Observed in the first section, that few physicians had sufficiently examined the recrements of the body; and so far looked into the mysteries of nature, as to consider for what purposes and uses in life, they were seperated and secreted into their proper channels and receptacles; for we daily perceive, that the saliva, the pancreatic juice, and the biliose humours, are three liquors secreted from their respective organs, that serve great and eminent pur∣poses in the animal-oeconomy: and as the saliva, or what we call the spittle, is the last and most considerable of the secretions, so I think it will be proper to examine the nature, properties, and constituent principles of a fluid, that is often the cause of considerable changes and alterations in life.</P>
<P>Now the three grand recrements of the body, <HI>viz.</HI> the saliva, bile, and seed, are three principles, that not only preserve life and health in the individuum; but the last se∣creted fluid is that sacred balsam, that has continued the species from the beginning of the world to this time, and which will so continue it, to the latest period of nature; and therefore methinks they deserve a more particular en∣quiry, than what I perceive physicians, hitherto, have been pleased to bestow upon them: however, I shall in this little tract only proceed to examine the recrements of the saliva, the principles of the juices secreted in the stomach, and the properties of the bile, as subjects the most proper at present for my enquiry; and shall postpone the last to a more convenient opportunity.</P>
<P>However, before we proceed to discover the powers, efficacy, and operation of the Fasting Spittle, I judge it highly necessary that, in the first place, we proceed to examine the origin, secretion, and composition of this noble fluid, as it is seperated from the arterial blood: because
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>upon these principles most of its active powers, in a great measure, will be found to have their dependance.</P>
<P>The saliva, or what we call the fasting spittle, is origi∣nally secreted from the arterial blood by two complex glands, called the parotides, which, according to <HI>Steno</HI> and <HI>Nuck,</HI> two accomplished anatomists, lye at the root of the ear, one on each side of the neck: These glands secern the grosser saliva; and by means of a number of little small tubes, arising from the inner coat of these glands, convey the secreted liquor into one common duct, which, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the third upper grinder, opens into the mouth, where∣by the jaws, tongue, and all the inner parts of the lips, are moistened with this viscous, secreted spittle.</P>
<P>But, besides these two large secretory glands, that fur∣nish out the grosser secretions for moistening the mouth in general, there are discovered by later anatomists divers other minute, conglobate glands, that secrete a finer, thinner, and more attenuated fluid: These have their roots in the polate, tongue, gums, and lips, all whose mem∣branes are perforated with little small tubuli, that let into the mouth a fine, thin, volatile saliva, somewhat more attenuated than the former: However, all these fountains of the spittle are so commodiously situated, that they must necessarily, upon closing of the lips, pressure of the jaws, and combining or compressing of the cheeks, squeeze out a good quantity of their contents into the mouth, for the separating, moistening, and dissolving of the aliments we take for the support of life.</P>
<P>And this is the reason, why these glands discharge the greatest quantities of their secreted liquors, during masti∣cation, or when we chew our food: because then there is not only the greatest pressure upon these organs, but, at the same time, all the parts of the mouth are put into greater motions and compressions, than at any other time whatever, for to make the experiment if you please to grind close the teeth, and, at the same time, compress your cheeks with the lips, you will readily perceive a larger discharge of saliva to rouze from these respective glands, than when the same lye still, are at rest, and under no compression.</P>
<P>But, of all remedies prescribed, we ought not only to at∣tempt to know their origin, nature, and production, but also to endeavour to penetrate into the principles, powers, and
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>properties they consist of, whereby we shall be better ena∣bled to discover their manner of action, and the different efforts they exert upon the various organs of the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>As to the saliva, when all the different secretions are inti∣mately mixed in the mouth, and formed into one uniform, attenuated, frothy humour; the mixture then appears from experiments, to constitute a fine, thin, volatile, silver-coloured fluid, and which is secreted from the arterial blood in the caroted arteries, and called the saliva or spittle.</P>
<P>Upon examination, it appears to be a composition of salt, oil, and sulphur, dissolved in a pretty large quantity of a sine, thin, attenuated phlegm, very nearly resembling the consistence of soap water, to which it is very nearly related by the virtues of its qualities.</P>
<P>Under a sound state of health, it is without smell, per∣fectly insipid, or if it has any taste, it may properly be said to resemble the white of an egg: To the touch it is ex∣tremely viscid; easily mixes with oil, and therefore is oleose; it readily evaporates with the least force of fire, and therefore contains a large portion of volatile parts; and in its nature is mightily penetrant and abstersive, and therefore will destroy even the spericity of the mercurial globles themselves, whose round figures are so difficult to destroy, unless you apply salts, fire, sulphur, or ingredients of an unctions, adhesive nature.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Of the properties, virtues, and salutary effects of the fasting saliva, when externally applied to old aches, pains, recent cuts, wounds, old ulcers, corns, sore eyes, and gouty nodes.</HEAD>
<P>IF we consider the fasting saliva alone, and as it is se∣creted from the salival glands situated in the jaws and mouth, we shall perceive divers great and remarkable effects to arise from its application; for this saliva may most properly be called the noble Balsam of Nature, as it is a surer relief, in most cases, where outwardly applied, than what most people will easily be led to believe, that have not themselves tryed its efficacy: I do not desire to be too sanguine upon the virtues of the fasting saliva;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>but shall only beg leave of the reader, to lay down what I know to be matter of fact; and then shall proceed to give a detail of divers very surprizing cures, that one Mrs. <HI>Bestock,</HI> at <HI>Nantwich</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> has done to vast numbers of people, in that neighbourhood, by the outward application of the fasting saliva, vulgarly called the fasting spittle.</P>
<P>I am intimately acquainted with a gentleman, that every spring and fall was accosted with a very trouble some scorbutic tetter; he had taken mercury in all shapes, ad∣vised with several physicians, and by their advice had ap∣plied mixtures, ointments, and waters, prescribed for tettery humours, but without success: At last, he was ad∣vised to apply the fasting saliva every morning, which, in a fortnight's time, effectually cured him.</P>
<P>Nor do I know a better medicine for troublesome corns. A person of some distinction had a corn on the off side of his foot, that so shackled his limbs, as almost to reduce him to the state of a cripple: He employed the corn-cutter without effect; for every time it was cut it both bled and pained him very much: these are usual accidents that hap∣pened from a nerve and vein, that entered into the com∣position of the corn, and whose sensibility and cavity were not totally destroyed by so hard a body He had made use of plaisters, balsams, ointments, lotions, and all manner of applications, but to no manner of purpose: He then accidentally asked a gentleman's opinion, and was advised every night to soak his feet in warm water and bran, and the next morning to apply chewed bread, well moistened with the fasting spittle, by way of pultice, which, in a little time, perfectly relieved him; for the corn, in less than a week, tumbled out by the roots, and he has heard no more of it since. The like happened to a gentleman that was advised to apply the chewed bread, mixed with the fasting spittle, to a gouty node, which mightily relieved him, and has kept his feet easy ever since.</P>
<P>In those hard excressences we call warts in the hands, face, and divers other parts of the body, it is an infallible cure, if constantly used. It also mightily assists in relieving sore eyes, especially those whose eye-lids from hard drink∣ing, are red, angry, and inflamed: In these cases, if you do but lightly touch the parts affected, with this noble balsam, every morning, you will find great relief. And
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>we know, by certain experience, that in all cuts, recent wounds, and accidental hurts, that the fasting saliva is a sovereign remedy: and its penetrant dissolving abstersive qualities are so great, that if it be sufficiently rubbed with mercury, vulgarly called quick-silver, it will mortify that mineral, and destroy the spericity of its globles, though one of the most active bodies in nature.</P>
<P>But the great cures done by one <HI>Bridget Bostock,</HI> at <HI>Nantwich</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> by the external application of fasting spittle, would surmount all credit, and scarce gain belief, had we not sufficient attestations, from several authentic letters, that put the matters of fact above all dispute; for in a letter from a person of undoubted cha∣racter, he tells us; <Q>"that this old woman, all her life∣time, made it her business to cure her neighbours, and people that lived near her, of sore legs, and other dis∣orders. But her reputation of late, seems so wonder∣fully encreased, that people come to her from all parts far and near. A year ago she had, as I remember, about forty under her care: When I went to <HI>London</HI> she had one hundred in the compass of a week; and they en∣creased so fast, that, by the time I came back, which was not above three weeks, she had above eight score: and this day five weeks one hundred and sixteen; Sun∣day se'ennight my wife and self went to <HI>Bridget</HI>'s house, and were told by the persons that kept the door, and let the people in by fives and sixes; that they had that day told six hundred to whom she had administred: She at length grew so very faint, for she never breaks her fast till she has done, that at six of the clock in the evening she was obliged to give over her operations, though then there were more than sixty persons to whom she had not administred. On Monday last she had seven hundred, and every day at present near that number.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"She cures the blind, the deaf, and the lame of all sorts: Numbers of people have received great benefit, in the rheumatism, king's-evil, histeric fits, falling sickness, and shortness of breath: She also mightily relieves the dropsy, palsy, leprosy, cancers: and, in short, almost every disease mankind is subject to, except the <HI>French</HI> pox, which she will not be prevailed by any means to meddle with."</Q></P>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<P>But here I must beg leave so far to interfere with this old woman, as to declare, that in chancres, which is a very stubborn species of the venereal disease, and which often affects the glans penis, and baffles the utmost efforts of the physician and surgeon, without a salivation: that there is not a surer remedy, than every morning to touch the part with the fasting saliva of a man or woman turned of seventy or eighty years of age: And if you extinguish a little crude mercury in the saliva, the efficacy will be so much the more considerable and certain.</P>
<P>But to return from whence I digressed: <Q>"You will be desirous to know what medicines she uses to procure such mighty relief; and I must tell you, that all the means she uses, are only to stroke the part with fasting spittle, and praying for them; it is hardly credible to think, what cures she daily performs, and without you were here to see them, it must appear romantic and incredible: for some people grow well while in the house; others while on the road, and all find themselves better after they are got home. She is about seventy years of age, and takes no money for her cures, though offered her; in short, the rich, the lame, the blind, and the deaf, all pray for her, and bless the great good she does; and the poor daily come to her in cart-loads. I am, Sir, <HI>&amp;c."</HI></Q></P>
<P>This letter, I am well assured, comes from a person of great veracity and integrity; and therefore I think deserves some animadversions, as the cures the author speaks of, are many of them very surprizing, and divers out of the common road of external applications: However, to make suitable remarks on these cures, we must first observe, that <HI>Bridget Bostock</HI> is seventy years of age; that all was done (besides her prayers) by the force of the fasting spittle; as to her prayers for a blessing upon her endeavours, I shall not presume to say any thing, because we are assured in holy writ, that persons of less piety, virtue, and charity, than this old woman seems to be mistress of, have been enabled to work miracles; and therefore we can never be certain how far God Almighty interposes his finger in assist∣ing the relief of divers diseases: But in most of these cases, except the dropsy, I will be bold to say, that the means this good woman used for the recovery of these people, were equal to the effects that ensued; and in the dropsy
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>there are two remedies may be used, that will infallibly cure that disease, provided it does not arise from a rupture of the lymphaticks, in which case there can no relief be given, but by tapping the patient, and that only a tran∣sient relief, or the patient is not greatly advanced in years. Thus far I could not but remark in cases so particular in their aspect, and which were relieved by such a simple remedy as I am now treating of.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> Of the vehicle most proper to convey this sovereign remedy into the stomach, in order to facilitate its operation and salutary effects, upon the various viscera, organs, and fluids of animal bodies.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have considered the fasting saliva alone, and as it is applied to the external parts of the body; I am come now to speak of its salutary effects, when it is mixed, combined, and associated with the fine fluid secreted from the glands of the oesophagus or gula, in its descent into the stomach; when it is combined with the stomachic juices secreted from the villous coat of that important organ; and the improvements it acquires, as a dissolvent, after it is got out of the stomach into the in∣testines, and there thoroughly mixed with the bile and pancreatic juices.</P>
<P>And it plainly appears, from the observations we have made in the first section, that the bread is little or nothing concerned in producing these good effects, we so sensibly perceive to ensue, upon eating a Crust of Bread, in a morning fasting; nor can the virtues that follow, upon eating that concrete, be properly ascribed to the bread itself; for it never could be swallowed, did not the fasting saliva mix with it, and convert it to a pulpous substance, and thereby fit it for digestion; for no dry aliments ever could be swallowed, without a proper portion of the salival fluid, nor do I conceive, that any other liquid menstruum would serve the intentions of nature so well as the saliva: And this is the reason, why the greatest number of salival glands are placed in the mouth, and consequently the greatest quantity of saliva separated from these glandural meshes, during mastication, or the time we are chewing
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>of our food; for then there is not only the greatest pres∣sure and motion in all the parts of the mouth, but the muscles of the jaws, cheeks, and lips, are more forcibly compressed, contracted, and put into motion, than at any other time: for these glandular bodies, the fountains of the saliva, are so commodiously situated, that they must necessarily, upon any pressure of the cheeks, or closing of the jaws, squeeze out their contents into the mouth; and, to make the experiment, let any person grind close his gums and teeth, and at the same time, straitly compress the muscless of his cheeks and jaws, and he will readily perceive a larger discharge of saliva to flow into his mouth from these compressions, than is usual for the same glands, at any other time; which plainly demonstrates how much the action of these muscles contribute to influence the dis∣charge of these salival glands.</P>
<P>But if the relief given does not consist in the virtues of the bread itself, but in the secretion of the recrement, called the Fasting Spittle, then you will say; to what end and purpose serves a piece of bread, eat early in a morning fasting: To this I answer; to very great and good pur∣poses every way: For, in the first place, there is no other substance we know of, that can so properly be eat in a morning fasting, as a Crust of Bread, or that the stomach will so readily receive and digest as that concrete: Se∣condly, of all other aliments, it is the most proper vehicle to imbibe and collect the Fasting Saliva; and therefore, of all other vehicles, it is the fittest to be employed upon these occasions, as it best mixes with the saliva: Thirdly, the force from the teeth, necessary to divide a Crust, and break its cohesions, will more readily squeeze out the saliva from the several falival glands.</P>
<P>These are the reasons I offer in preference to a Crust of Bread: and therefore I judge that no other concrete will so readily serve the purpose, as a Crust of Bread, unless it be what we call the captains biscuits, which they carry to sea for their own eating: These are still preferable to bread, as they are still harder than a crust, and more destitute of all foreign mixtures, as they are free both from leven and yest. But as these sometimes may be difficult to be had, so I judge a piece of bread, in general, the best vehicle we can substitute, in order to convey the fasting saliva into the stomach. And hence it clearly appears, that the virtue and
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>efficacy that results from eating a Crust of Bread, does not so properly arise from the bread itself, as the chewing and mixing it with the Fasting Spittle; and therefore, to im∣prove this fine liquid, volatile soap, and exalt its virtues, I advise you, having eat nothing over night for supper, about five of the clock in the morning, to eat one ounce, or an ounce and half, of either wheat or rye bread, which in chewing, will take up full half an ounce of the fasting saliva, to reduce it into a proper, soft, pulpose substance, and which, when well chewed and moistened, will be easily swallowed; and when you have got it down into the stomach, then leave the rest to nature, and, if you can, go to sleep. And it is adviseable that you eat nothing for two or three hours after: Which leads me to speak a few things of the consequences of its being got into the stomach, and of its mixture with divers of the secreted juices, in the stomach and intestines.</P>
<P>Now this course, if steadily pursued for a month or six weeks, will prove of great efficacy in divers diseases, that have obstructions and sabulous concretions for their parent, as the gravel, stone, gout, and rheumatism. Nor is it less efficacious in tumours of the liver, spleen, and divers other organs; in all which cases, it is known to give great relief.</P>

V.</HI> Of the improvements the Fasting Saliva receives from its mixing with the stomachic, the biliose, and pancreatic juices in the stomach, intestines, and parts adjoining; and in particular, of the nature, properties, and con∣stituent principles of the bile, as the greatest dis∣solvent in nature.</HEAD>
<P>BUT after this sine, thin, saponaceous fluid, we call the saliva or spittle, has left the mouth, and before it gets down into the stomach, it receives considerable improvements from a fine, thin, attenuated, volatile fluid, secreted from a number of glands, situated in the head of the gula, which still renders it more penetrant and abster∣sive: It still acquires more force and energy from its mixture with the stomach juices, discharged from the various glands, whose orifices form the velvet coat of this important organ: These supply the stomach with a sine,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>thin, clear, spumose fluid, that tastes a little saline and acid, but is very active and volatile in its properties.</P>
<P>This is ordained by nature to penetrate the foods, break their cohesions, and help forward their digestion for the nourishment of the body: And here a very fair opportunity offers itself for me to speak of the principles of digestion, and to discover how these important changes are brought about; that convert our aliments into nourishment, but this would be foreign to my intention, and be a means of rendering the discourse tedious, as my avow'd design is brevity, and only to take a view of the secreted fluids, as far as, in their course, they join with the Fasting Saliva, in order to exalt it into a fine, saponaceous liquor, proper to relieve the body of its insirmities.</P>
<P>Thus it appears how much the Fasting Saliva is improved in its nature, properties, and action, from the lubricating lymph of the gula, the stomachic juices, and the chylous fluid, all continually digesting in the stomach; continually secreting from their respective glands, and continually flowing over the pilorus into the duodenum, where they mix and unite with the biliose and pancreatic juices, which greatly improve this noble, active medicine, and by their tumults, conssicts, and conquassations, render it the most penetrant, abstersive, and dissolving medicine we know of in nature.</P>
<P>And because I have mentioned the biliose juice as an in∣gredient in this fine, volatile, dissolvent medicine, you will permit me here a little to examine into the nature, pro∣perties, and secretion of the bile, because it is a liquor, that will be found to have very considerable effect and consequences in the various organs of the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>The liver is the organ ordained by nature for the sepa∣ration, secretion, and ultimate perfection of the biliose hu∣mour; and I should immediately proceed to examine the principles and mechanism of this important organ, but that <HI>Malpigius,</HI> that accurate anatomist, and our learned coun∣tryman Dr. <HI>Glisson,</HI> have so fully exhausted this subject, that they have left but little, that is new, to be said by those that come after them: And as I am only to observe the nature of secretion, the principles of the bile, and the uses and purposes for which it is ordained to serve in life, so I judge that the course of the vessels, their various ramifications, and their aptness for the secretion of this
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>humour, will furnish out every thing necessary to be known upon this subject.</P>
<P>However, I think proper here to observe, that the modus of secretion of the bile in the liver, is different from the humours secreted in all other parts of the body; for in all other parts the secretions are usually made from an artery, but in the liver nature has inverted that order, and makes use of a vein: and therefore the vena porta is appointed for this important office: this vein receives the blood from the spleen, from the mesenterick arteries, and from almost all the organs situated in the lower belly: this sanguineous fluid moving much slower in the vena porta, than it would have done in an artery of the same structure and mechanism, is the sole cause why the biliose salts are so readily disposed to attract each other, and form a fluid with that viscidity, necessary to give consistence to the bile; and for this end and pur∣pose the vena porta and biliary vessels are inclosed in one common sheath or capsule: they enter the liver on the concave side, and are equally distributed through all its substance; so that wherever there is a branch of the one, there, upon good inspection, you will be sure to discover a branch of the other: and therefore each lobe, and each gland of that lobe, whether on the convex or concave side, receives the same vessels, <HI>viz.</HI> A vein, nerve and artery, called <HI>arteria hepatica,</HI> to convey the nourishment for the use of the liver.</P>
<P>The porta receives the blood from the neighbouring parts, which is very sharp, by reason of the close union of the bilious salts; for the lymph that kept them asun∣der is separated from the blood by the glands of the stomach, intestines, ancreas, and mesentery: and there∣fore, if this sharp, detersive, saline bile, did continue to circulate with the blood, it must frequently occasion vehement fevers, colliquative fluxes, heart-burnings, and severe cholic pains, but these miserable effects are often prevented by a soft olious fluid, that tempers these sharp, keen salts, and blunts their acrimonious effects, both upon the intestines and parts adjoining.</P>
<P>In the secretion of the bile, we are to observe, that the vena porta hepatica terminates in little small glan∣dular folliculi, that secrete the bile from the blood; from these small glands the billous humour is received into the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>extremeties of the pori biliarii, as they inosculate with the extremeties of the vena porta, and which, by their unions, form one trunk, called the ductus hepaticus: this trunk empties part of the gall into the gall bladder: from the gall bladder arises the ductus cysticus, which uniting with the ductus hepaticus, form one common trunk, called the ductus communis cholidocus that con∣veys the gall into the duodenum, near its curviture, that forms the beginning of the jejunum; so that only part of the gall flows into the vesica felea, by the cystick duct, while the other part is conveyed into the intes∣tines by the ductus communis cholidocus, that opens into that organ by an oblique insertion.</P>
<P>The bile seems to be a gross, thick, viscid, oleous phlegm well impregnated with salts of various kinds, as sweet, bitter, acerb, muriatic, and bitter sweet; all which are blended and intimately mixed in a small quantity of viscid phlegm: in this fluid, more than any other of the body, the oil and salts greatly predominate; for an ounce of black gall contained in the fund of the vesica fellea yields oil and salts, of each three drams; of phlegm only two drams.</P>
<P>If you examine the gall in the liver, in the pori biliarii, and gall bladder, you will find it of a different consistence, colour and bitterness, in all these three different situations; for the gall in the liver, or glan∣dular folliculi, is of a pale green, more fluid, saltish, and less bitter; that in the cystick duct more viscid, less bitter, but greatly partaking of sacharine salts: that in the gall bladder appears of a deep poracious green: and lastly, that in the fund, inclining to a blackish hue, and which is more viscid, less salt, but contains more of the bitterish twang.</P>
<P>I could not but be thus particular upon the nature, principles, and secretion of the bile, because our great master <HI>Hippocrates</HI> avers that the ingredients of bile are generated with the first principles of life; and when it happens to be viteous, redundant, or defective, fails not to become the parent of most diseases that any way can affect the constitutions of animal bodies, especially those that are hot, fiery, and inflammatory: and tho' every constitution must necessarily generate bile, yet a tense, springy constitution, or a constitution with very
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>elactic fibres, must necessarily have this humour in the largest proportion, and these liable to generate much bile, are very prone, spring and fall, to fall into loose∣nesses, fluxes, and the cholera morbus, which is what we call a bilious vomiting, accompanied with a loose∣ness, where great quantities of yellow, green, black stools are discharged.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. VI.</HI> Of some other sovereign properties of the bile; as it both promotes the digestion of our aliments, assists the circulation of the blood, and helps forward the glan∣dular secretion in every part of the body.</HEAD>
<P>BUT I have not yet done with the bile: for it is a secreted humour, of that vast service and use in the animal-oeconomy, that I very much question whe∣ther either health could subsist, or life itself be conti∣nued without its assistance; for this bile, I am speaking of is a secretion so universal, that I do not know one single species of animals destitute of this noble secretion; for man, beast, reptiles, and the various classes of the fish kind, all have bile; and, in all these different sub∣jects, it is the bitterest humour in the whole body; which is a strong argument with me of the necessity of bitter medicines in divers cases of diseases, especially when they are properly applied.</P>
<P>Now the bile is so copious a subject, and affords so many experiments to enlarge upon, that I could write a very large volume on the principles, nature, and vir∣tues of the bile alone, without exhausting the subject: and we find by experience, that all people of a hot, choleric, dry constitution, are inordinately subject to be hot, furious, and passionate, in proportion as they gene∣rate a greater or lesser quantity of bile: however, I will not say, that any one of the secreted liquors or recre∣ments are the sole cause of life and health; yet this I will aver, and am able to demonstrate, that neither health nor life can long subsist, where the recrements of the saliva and bile are for any considerable time ob∣structed: and it is the observation of all naturalists, that the bile greatly differs in its own nature; for in the
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>larger animals it is less acid and sharp, than in those that are little; in beasts than in birds, and in birds than in fishes, and in fishes, than the various tribes of insects: however, in man we discover the most tinging bitter bile, that is in any animal whatsoever; for it is so in∣tensely bitter in this animal, that one drop will com∣municate a bitterish twang to two ounces of water; and the same quantity will tinge half a pint of the same fluid with a fine, beautiful, palish green.</P>
<P>But to be a little more explicit, and particular upon this subject: as it is a point of such importance to the health and lives of animals, I lay it down as a principle, not to be contested, that life itself depends upon a regu∣lar and uninterrupted circulation of the blood and fluids through the several organs of the animal-oeconomy: this constant and equal motion of the blood is kept up by the circulation of the bile, that every where destroys the tenacious, thick, viscid particles of phlegm, that ren∣ders the blood roapy, stagnant, and apt to furr up the minutest arteries.</P>
<P>This bilious humour, from its inciding, penetrant, and dissolving qualities, not only assists the circulation, but also is greatly concerned in promoting the separation of the chile from the faeces, or matter of our stools, assists its passage into the lacteals, and then cuts, di∣vides, and corrects the thick viscid slime, that often adheres to the coats of the stomach and intestines: blocks up their secretions, and is a frequent cause of very severe cholic pains.</P>
<P>But amongst all the salts of the bile, which are both volatile and fixed, there is a peculiar essential salt, en∣dued with a very sweet property; these essential, sacha∣rine salts, more readily join with the chyle in the intes∣tines than any other; and this is that salt, that gives to the chyle both its sweetness and taste, and that white∣ness it obtains after it has passed the venae lacteae primi genesis: this sacharine salt also gives to the urine of those that labour under the diabetes, that sweet taste we often discover in those that, for any considerable time, have been subject to this disease.</P>
<P>If we proceed farther in our enquiries, we shall dis∣cover by experiments, that the bile of animals absterges like soap, and renders oils miscible with water: as to
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>its virtues, it penetrates, attenuates and resolves all ob∣structions in every part of the body, and affects rosins, gums, and other tenacious bodies, by a dissolution of their texture; whereby they are brought to mix with any fluid they are applied to: this bile or gall is neither alcalious or acid, but seems a combination of various salts, oils, and sulphurs, diluted in a pretty large quan∣tity of phlegm; and there is no question to be made, but that the principal use of the bile is to seperate at∣tenuate, and sheath the asperities of the chyle by its oils and sulphurs; to blunt the acids by its oleous corpuscles, and to assist the circulation of the blood in the veins and arteries, by its stimulating powers: It also proves a stimulus to the intestines, and thereby facilitates the descent of our excrements, and without which we should be perpetually costive and seldom go to stool.</P>
<P>As the bile is the hottest and sharpest of all other hu∣mours in the body; so in its circulation, it every where irritates the fibres of the veins, nerves, and arteries; and thereby keeps up the circulation of the blood, and frees the glands from obstructions; so that without the circulation of the bile, and constant secretion of this bilious humour, the circulation of the blood would be languid, the secretion of the several humours stand still, and life itself be extinct; for there is no other power, that we know of in nature, capable of keeping up the blood's motion, save the bile: and therefore, in the blood, these bilious salts are set at such a distance from each other, as only to irritate the veins and arteries to a degree, as may keep the blood in motion, and help forward the secretion of the several respective humours to their destined ends and purposes of life; but as the stomach and intestines are composed of more solid coats, so, to make any suitable impressions upon their viscid, slimy secretions, there was a necessity for a more active, volatile, inciding humour: and therefore, as the bile came to be secreted into the vena porta of the liver, it was deprived of its fluidity, that a greater quantity of its various salts might be concentrated into a smaller portion of phlegm; for by this means its salts are so nearly collected, that they form a thick viscid, saline, bitter humour, whose office is to stimulate the intestines,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>keep up their peristaltic motions, and help forwards the descent of the excrements, and without which they would be apt to stagnate in the intestines, and create obstinate costiveness and severe cholic pains; so that the bilious salts serve several ends and purposes in life; for as they exist in the blood, so they assist the circulation; as they are secreted in the liver, and flow into the in∣testines, the more fine parts help forwards the separation of the chyle, and its secretion into the lacteals, while a grosser portion of the bilious salts mix with the ex∣crements, and facilitate their descent; and without which the animal itself neither could well subsist under a sound state of health, or continue in life for any con∣siderable time.</P>
<P>After so much said concerning our enquiries into the nature, principles, and secretion of the bile, I shall only observe on the fluid secreted from the pancreas, that it is a fine, thin, lymphatic liquor, whose office, when mixed and incorporated with the saliva, stomachic juices, and bile, serves to dilute and attenuate the chyle, and facilitate its motion into the lacteal vessels; which leads me to treat of the essicacy of the saliva, when duly mixed, properly incorporated, and perfectly united with the foregoing liquors, whereby they arrive at the highest perfection their several natures are capable of; and of whose effects and consequences, in divers diseases, we shall treat in the following section.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. VII.</HI> Of the operation of the Fasting Saliva, when inwardly taken, and mixed with the pancreatic and bilious juices, in the scurvy, gravel, rheumatism, and di∣vers other diseases incident to obstruct the blood, and vitiate the secretions in the internal habit.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now seen in the fourth section what this fasting spittle will do alone, and when outwardly applied in divers external diseases: I come now to speak of its effects and virtues, after it is mixed with divers secreted liquors, in its passage from the mouth, till it becomes a secreted liquor into the mouth again. If the fasting spittle, after the bread has been well
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>moistened with it in the mouth, is charged into the stomach, it then, in its passage, meets with the lubri∣cating lymph of the gula, which, from its spirituous, active qualities, very much improves the fasting saliva: and after its descent into the stomach, there the sto∣machic juices are continually secreting from their respec∣tive glands; continually mixing with the ingested spittle conveyed into the stomach with the meat we eat, till digested into a thin, light, volatile spume or froth, they, from their lightness and tenuity of parts, flow over the pylorus into the intestines, where all these various fluids of the saliva, of the secreted liquor issuing from the glands of the oesophagus and stomach, are united in the duodenum, and intimately combined with the bilious and pancreatic juices, discharged from their respective pipes, into one uniform mass or soap.</P>
<P>And having brought the fasting saliva through a course of digestions to mix with the bile, and pancreatic juice in the intestines; it appears to me, from the very nature and properties of the bilious humours thus new-modelled, from the access of the various secretions, that we have generally confined the gall and pancreatic juices to answer very imperfect purposes of life; as if they were secreted for little else, but by their bitter and acid salts, to dissolve our aliments into the stomach and intestines, to facilitate the descent of the foeces, and give the depurated chyle a passage into the lacteals. But upon a more attentive view of things, we shall per∣ceive that the bilious humour serves very great and im∣portant ends of life in the animal-oeconomy; for were this liquid, volatile, animal soap, of a very active, cleansing, penetrant and abstersive nature, by the large∣ness and union of salts of various natures, as of bitter, sweet, salt, acrid, alcalious, and muriatic, all com∣bined into one substantial fluid; it will necessarily hap∣pen, that such a uniform liquor will be able to dissolve all manner of viscous humours, and sabulous concre∣tions, that furr up the mouths of the lacteals, obstruct the passage of the chyle, and dispose all corrupt hu∣mours to discharge by stool, urine, and insensible per∣spiration.</P>
<P>This fluid the saliva, by the improvements it receives, as above described, being admitted with the chyle into
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>the lacteals, attenuates, dissolves, and liquisies any furr or coaculum, that may stick or adhere to the coats of the lacteals, or obstruct in the vessels of the receptaculum chili, or ductus thoracicus: for the fine, thin, depu∣rated chyle contains globles of a larger size, than any to be found in the blood itself: and therefore are apter to stagnate in these fine, white tubes, called venae lacteae primi &amp; secundi generis, than in the vessels of any other parts of the body.</P>
<P>Therefore if it enters the lacteals, and gets into the blood, it purifies that fluid, dissolves all preternatural lentours, scours the glands, and cleanses their emuncto∣ries, whereby the veins, nerves, and arteries, are cleared of all embarrassing obstructions, and the course of nature carried on with the greatest harmony and accord.</P>
<P>In the kidnies, ureters, and bladder, it is known to encrease the separation and secretion of the fluids in the urinary passages; so that a man may observe himself to discharge more urine after he has eat his crust in a morn∣ing fasting, than at any other time of the day: again, this noble fluid, by its oleous and balsamic qualities, abates pain, and asswages the inflammation of the parts, as is very usual where either much gravel or large stones have frequently passed these several organs: as this fine, balsamic, liquid, compound soap is endued with soft, oleous and balsamic properties, whereby it may sheath the asperities of the acrimonious salts, and attemperate all sharp humours; so it abounds also with sharp, acid, inciding salts, both volatile, essential, and fixed; where∣by it attenuates, breaks, and dissolves, all sabulous con∣cretions, rectifies the intemperature of the blood, that may intercept the motion of the fluids in every part, and carries its virtues to the extremest organs of the body: nor does it only contribute to destroy the most stubborn diseases, but also mightily serves to preserve the body in health; for where the circulation of the blood, the secretion of the juices, and discharge of the excrementi∣tious foeces and fluids are constant, regular, and uniform: there the health is in the highest perfection a man can possibly arrive at, in this imperfect state of nature.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECT. VIII.</HI> Of the force and efficacy of fasting and abstinence, un∣der the operation of this fine, penetrating, abstersive, animal soap.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not presume here to treat these subjects of sasting and abstinence as a divine, who intends, by his advice and counsel, to mortify the body or soul, and better the conscience; but as a physician, who is desi∣rous to preserve the strength, health, and motions of the body of his patient, steady, uniform, and regular.</P>
<P>Every one must be sensible, what great things have been promised from quicksilver, tar-water, Mrs. <HI>Stevens</HI>'s medicines, and divers other quack pills, powders, and elixirs, in the gravel, gout, dropsy, and various other diseases: but I declare, that if the advice I offer for the benefit of mankind, be but carefully observed, and punc∣tually put in practice, that many will not only receive great relief, but an entire exemption, from the most obstinate and stubborn diseases.</P>
<P>For we ought ever to consider, that nature is always on the side of health, and continually striving to restore the constitution, whenever borne down by the force of a disease; so that seldom can any-obstructions happen to the body, but that repletion or gorging more than nature can digest, is the cause; and which, when often repeated, brings on indigestions in the stomach, windi∣ness or flatulencies in the bowels and intestines; a cor∣ruption of humours in the blood, and various obstruc∣tions in different organs of the habit: these are the parents of most diseases, that are incident to affect us in life; for what is the scurvy, but a thick, viscid, ropy blood, unable to pass the finest strainers of the several organs; and how comes it by these properties, but by the indigestions of our aliments? The same we may ob∣serve of cholic pains, the asthma, and dropsy; their original cause undoubtedly arises from indigestions; nor is the generation of gravel and stone less owing to the same causes; for when our foods escape the force of the stomach, not thoroughly digested, they never after can receive the assimilating power from any after impres∣sions the subsequent organs can lay upon them, but be∣come
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>the cause of various obstructions in the small or∣gans of the body: hence arise wind in the stomach, pains in the intestines, rheumatisms in the limbs, and schirrous tumours in the liver, spleen, and divers other parts.</P>
<P>Now, under these circumstances, to bring nature home to herself, the first thing must be to prescribe ab∣stinence from all flesh meats, for the compass of a week, if the disease be recent; three weeks, or a month, if the same has been of any long continuance: this will give nature time to recover herself; what I mean by nature recovering herself is that there are certain restitutive powers in every organ and fibre of the body, whereby nature, when any organ is obstructed or oppressed, strives to recover its former tone. And this self-restoring power is partly the effects of the fluids, and partly lodged in the organs themselves, and the mechanism that constitutes their powers of force and motion.</P>
<P>Now in any great pressure, from a load of foods charged into the stomach, there is nothing that gives so sure a relief, as fasting and abstinence; for these vacati∣ons from aliments, enables the fibres of the stomach, vicera, and other organs, to resolve the obstructions, to break the conesions of the blood, and enables nature to root out the most stubborn diseases, by flinging their causes off by either stool, urine, or insensible prespira∣tion, or sometimes a profuse sweat: nor can there be a more noble, safe, and efficacious remedy to rid us of either stone, gravel, or gout, than what I now offer for the relief of mankind; that is abstinence, fasting, and a Crust of Bread eat early in a morning fasting; or rather the fasting saliva charged into the stomach, by the assistance of a piece of bread: and in these cases, it is necessary that we take nothing of aliments for two or three hours after.</P>
<P>Give me leave here to recapitulate, as briefly as I can, the virtues of one of the greatest dissolvent medicines in nature; and at the same time one of the safest, that ever was communicated to mankind; a remedy that, if steadily pursued, will cure both the gout, the gravel, the stone, the asthma, and dropsy. Would you know this invaluable secret,—It is abstinence.—I say ab∣stinence; the most effectual cure in all diseases: but by
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>the word abstinence, I do not mean a mere negative remedy, as if fasting was to do all the work, by suffer∣ing nature, at her leisure, to attenuate the fluids, resolve the obstructions, and digest off the obstructing matter: nothing like it; for we have given you the form of this medicine above, told you the ingredients, and whereof this excellent remedy, so assisting to nature, is com∣posed; and must leave yourself to judge of its efficacy and operation.</P>
<P>However to make some pertinent reflections upon this subject, I beg leave to observe, that after the whole quantity of chyle is digested into the stomach, and conveyed into the intestines; thereupon the fasting saliva, the lubricating lymph of the gula, the fluids secreted from the fine velvet coat of the stomach, are all continu∣ally separating from their respective glands; continually digesting in the stomach, and continually flowing over the pylorus into the duodenum; there they are mixed, united, and intimately combined with the pancreatic and bilious juices, and which, by their conflicts, tumults, and conquasations, produce a most fine, thin, attenuated fluid: this fluid being admitted into the lacteals, re∣solves the obstructions of the mesentery glands, every where seated near the lacteals; attenuates, dissolves, and liquifies any furr or coagulum, that may adhere, or stick to the sides of the lacteals, and prevent its entrance into the receptaculum chili, or ductus thoracicus. In a word, this fine, volatile, saline fluid, from the various secretions mixing with it, becomes a universal dissolvent; and is intended and separated by nature, to break the cohesions of the obstruent matter, that may cleave to the coats of the vessels in every part of the body: and from this natural observation, we may learn the great benefit of frequent fasting, not only to preserve the body under a sound state of health, but also how mightily serviceable it is in relieving divers diseases; and how efficacious it is in the gravel, stone, rheumatism, and divers other diseases, that have obstructions for their parent.</P>
<P>You see now, that, after all, we discover this to be no imaginary medicine, formed upon the negative prin∣ciples of fasting and abstinence, as if they were to do all the work themselves, but on the solid grounds of
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>the fasting saliva, combined and united with the liquors secreted from almost every organ of the body, whereby it is impowered to dissolve all unfriendly cohesions in the blood and animal juices; force open, break down, and unbind those stubborn obstructions, that impede the motion of the fluids, in their first passages; so that there is scarce a nerve, vein, artery, or gland, in the whole animal oeconomy, but what must necessarily re∣ceive some benefit, from the daily operation of this fine, liquid animal soap.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> Of the air, diet, exercise, and other requisitorial rules, necessary to be observed, in order to facilitate the operation of this liquid soap, I esteem a most invaluable remedy.</HEAD>
<P>THUS we have discovered the operation of this noble and most sovereign remedy in the scurvy, gravel, rheumatism, and divers other diseases; which leads me to speak a few things of the air, diet and ex∣ercise, necessary to be observed, in order to facilitate the relief it gives in the most stubborn diseases.</P>
<P>But before we can expect to accomplish all these fine effects, enumerated in the foregoing pages, I hold it highly necessary that a proper air, a regular diet, and a well adjusted exercise, should be enjoined the patient: as to the air, which is the first thing we ought to con∣sult about, I judge it highly necessary, that the patient should sojourn in a soft, free, open air, on a ground rather rising; in a place free from woods, sens, or high mountains, that may intercept the pure, balsamic pro∣perties of this healthful, enlivening fluid, the air. By all means, if he is subject to either the gravel, asthma or rheumatism, let him avoid living in great cities, which are pernicious to those incident to the foregoing diseases; and therefore my advice is, that he take the medicine in the country, if possible, as the goodness of the air will assist its operation: but if his business calls him to the city, and he cannot possibly stay in the coun∣try, he must not, by any means intermit the medicine, but pursue its use a month or six weeks in the best man∣ner
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>he can, without intermission; from which, in most diseases, that are lodged within the compass of the cir∣culation, he will receive considerable benefit.</P>
<P>Having done with the air, the next thing to be ob∣served, is the patient's diet: and I chuse to begin with his diet in the morning, because there are several nice circumstances, necessary to be adjusted, in order to facilitate the operation of this sovereign remedy, we call the fasting spittle. And therefore I advise the patient to eat his breakfast about ten of the clock in the morning: and, under a fit of the gravel, I would advise him to drink three or four dishes of tea, made either of mallow flowers, or, if the season does not permit them to be had, let him use the mallow leaves, sweetened with honey, with a slice or two of bread and butter, as the best breakfast he can have.</P>
<P>An hour or two after breakfast, let him exercise; and of all exercises, I prefer that on horseback; but if the weather happen to be hazy, and not promising, he may then, for two or three hours, take the air in a chariot, close chaise, or coach. When I speak of exercise, I always suppose the patient is entirely free from any pains of the gravel or stone.</P>
<P>After his return, if he finds himself refreshed, he may take a walk in the garden, or about the house, or busy himself for the remainder of the time between that and dinner, in his study: but above all things, let him take care he does not habituate himself to drink wine, or any thing that is strong, in the morning, before dinner; for many, by that means, have destroyed their appetite, and for ever after spoiled a good digestion; so that whatever they have eat at noon, has turned to wind and crudities, and subjected them to severe cholic pains.</P>
<P>When he sits down to his great meal, or dinner, I permit him to eat of every thing, so it be not too salt; for salts, of all kinds, are undoubtedly ingredients of both the gravel, stone, and rheumatism; and these in∣gredients furnish out the cause of frequent fits in these diseases: and therefore the young, of all animals, are to be chosen, as they consist of the lightest salts, and such as are easily dissipable by urine, sweat, and perspi∣ration; and seldom concrete, as they are not endued
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>with that degree of attraction as are the salts of older animals.</P>
<P>Between dinner and supper, I would not advise him to touch any thing, unless a dish or two of tea or coffee, with a slice of bread and butter; for the great point is so to order the air, diet, and exercise, as to be able to bring all the motions of the animal organs to a due tem∣perature, and then we shall greatly promote the opera∣tion of this salutary remedy, and render its virtues highly efficacious.</P>
<P>His supper I would advise him to take about six or seven in the evening, and by no means later; and as milk is phlegmatic, so, if he pleases, he may take half a pint, or more, of white wine whey, with a sea biscuit; or, if it pleases him better, he may take a slice of new cheese, and drink a few glasses of old port, or a pint of fine, soft ale, with about six ounces of the crust of a French role or minchet.</P>
<P>After these things are done, I advise him not to eat any thing till about six, seven, or eight of the clock the next morning, which is the time of his taking the grand medicine: this consists of half an ounce or six drachms of the fasting saliva, pressed or squeesed out from the salival glands into the mouth, by the pressure of the jaws and teeth, in eating an ounce or ten drachms of the crust or heel of a loaf made of the purest wheat; for the crust occasions so much the greater pressure from the teeth, whose greater force occasions a greater dis∣charge of this salival fluid, and which will answer all the purposes we declared in the preceding sections.</P>
<P>And, though of late years, we have heard of mighty feats done by crude mercury, tar water, and other quack medicines, sold up and down the town, support∣ed by royal patents, and dignified titles: yet I question, whether in the gravel, stone, and rheumatism, there ever yet was discovered, or at this time is discovered, or any remedy, in future times, shall be discovered, that in its virtues and efficacy, comes up to this invaluable medicine, I now offer for the benefit of mankind: and the patient may assure himself, that if these rules and cautions and some others, that does not properly come within the narrow compass, I here have set myself, are
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>but rightly pursued, they will not only mightily contri∣bute to preserve him in health, but also be extremely efficacious, to restore this invaluable blessing, whenever overpowered by the force of a disease: and in all these the patient will find little occasion for taking of medi∣cines, provided he is observing of these rules, and care∣ful, every day, to adjust his air, diet, and exercise.</P>
<P>Now, though I will not pretend, like our modern quacks, to cry up this medicine, as a universal catholicon, and promise the world, that it will never fail to cure all diseases it is applied to; yet I will boldly venture to declare a solemn truth, that no quack can, with justice, affirm in favour of his medicine: that it never was known to do any harm to man, woman, or child, notwith∣standing the many thousands of people, that have ex∣perimentally made use of it.</P>
