* Add TYPEs to DIVs in order to validate, making sure that the @type structure makes sense as a navigational aide, and that each type makes sense wrt to the one above it.
* Survey book for troublesome formats of all kinds, including lists, illustrations, tables, music, math, end-notes, quasi-tabular arrangments, and marginalia. Made sure that it was correctly tagged. Decide how much is worth changing.
* Look for unobtrusive numerations and other occult signs of structure.
* Look for illustrations, make sure that usable text within them has been captured and correctly tagged.
* Add FIGDESCs to any and all likely illustrations.
* Check for =""
* Check for "q;"
* Check placement and completeness of PBs.
* Check for GAPs and #s.

<DIV2 REND="italic" TYPE="preamble">
<P>IT having pleas'd Almighty God to put an end to the Glorious Life of his Late Majesty <HI>King William III.</HI> The Right Honorable the Lord Chamber∣lain issued out his Summons to such Physici∣ans and Surgeons as his Lordship thought
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>fit, appointing them to meet at <HI>Kensing∣ton,</HI> and there to Examine by Dissection into the State and Condition of the Roy∣al Body. The day after the Dissection, the said Physicians and Surgeons being met together again in order to the forming an account of what they had observed, Sir <HI>Thomas Millington,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> and Doctor <HI>Hannes</HI> were deputed as a Committee to draw vp the Report; which they did accordingly. This <HI>REPORT</HI> was afterwards sign'd by Them, and by the rest of the Physicians and Surgeons, and is as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report proper">
<P N="1">1. <LABEL>Surface of the Body.</LABEL> Upon viewing the <HI>Body,</HI> before Dissection, the following appearances were remarkable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Body</HI> in general was much e∣maciated.</P>
<P>Both the <HI>Leggs</HI> up to the Knees
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>and a little higher, as also the <HI>Right Hand</HI> and <HI>Arm</HI> as far as the Elbow were considerably swell'd.</P>
<P>There was likewise on the <HI>Left Thigh,</HI> near the Hip, a Bladder full of water, as big as a small Pullets Egg, resembling a Blane.</P>
<P N="2">2. <LABEL>Belly.</LABEL> Upon opening the <HI>Belly,</HI>
the <HI>Gutts</HI> were found of a <HI>Livid</HI> Color; and the <HI>Blood</HI> contain'd in their vessels, <HI>Black.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gutt</HI> called <HI>Ileon</HI> had in some places the marks of a slight <HI>Inflam∣mation.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Stomach, Pancreas, Mesentery, Liver, Gall-bladder, Spleen,</HI> and <HI>Kidneys</HI> were all sound and without fault.</P>
<P N="3">3. <LABEL>Chest.</LABEL> In the <HI>Thorax,</HI> or <HI>Chest,</HI>
we ob∣served that the <HI>Right side</HI> of the <HI>Lungs</HI> adher'd to the <HI>Pleura;</HI> and the <HI>Left,</HI> much more: From which, upon separation, there issued forth a quantity of purulent or frothy Serum.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<P>The <HI>Upper Lobe</HI> on the <HI>Left</HI> side of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and the part of the <HI>Pleura</HI> next to it were <HI>Inflamed</HI> to a degree of <HI>Mortification.</HI> AND THIS WE LOOK UPON AS THE IMME∣DIATE CAUSE OF THE KING'S DEATH.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Ventricles</HI> of the <HI>Heart</HI> and the <HI>Greater Bloodvessels</HI> arising out of them, were taken several large, tough, fleshlike substances of the kind call'd <HI>Polypus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Heart</HI> it self was of the smal∣ler size; but firm, and strong.</P>
<P N="4">4. <LABEL>Collar Bone.</LABEL> Upon laying bare the <HI>Right Collar-Bone,</HI> we found it had been broken near the Shoulder; and well set. Some <HI>extravasated Blood</HI> was lodged above and below the <HI>Fracture.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <LABEL>Brain.</LABEL> The <HI>Brain</HI> was perfectly sound and without any sign of distemper.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<P N="6">6. <LABEL>Mass of Blood.</LABEL> 'Tis very rare to find a <HI>Body</HI> with so little Blood, as was seen in <HI>This:</HI> there being more found in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> than in <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Parts,</HI> besides, put together.</P>
