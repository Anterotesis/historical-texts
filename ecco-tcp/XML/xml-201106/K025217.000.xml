<HEAD>I. <HI>The Case of the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of</HI> BATH <HI>and</HI> WELLS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT Five Years ago he felt a Soreness in his Left Side, after having rode Four Days together, and made Water, which was first coffee-colour'd, and then bloody. These Complaints went off in a short time; however, he became, after this, subject to make bloody Water upon Riding: He felt once a most violent Pain along the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Region of the Right Ureter; it lasted only for a Moment, and happened during a Fit of Cholic, occasioned by eating Strawberries. About Two Years ago he was obliged to for∣bear riding, and could hardly walk without making bloody Water; had Pain in making Water, and a Forcing to go to Stool at the same time, but no Stoppage: He began Mrs. <HI>Ste∣phens</HI>'s Medicines in <HI>April</HI> last; they increased the Pain in making Water for some time; his Water became turbid at the time of making, had ropy fetid Matter in it, deposited a thick heavy Sediment, and many small Flakes and Fragments of Stones were voided with it in a soft State: In Five or Six Weeks he grew much better, and was able to go over the Stones in his Coach: His general Health was also much improved. In the Beginning of <HI>July</HI> he had a Return of the Pain in making Water, with a sudden Stoppage now and then: Upon this he voided several Pieces of Stone in a soft State, with one pretty large Piece, Part of which was soft and white, Part brown and hard, and it gave a little Pain in passing: After this the Pain and Stoppage in making Water went off intirely. In <HI>September</HI> he went into the Coun∣try, where he often rides a trotting Horse with∣out any Inconvenience; and is free from all Complaints, excepting that he has now and then some uneasy Sensations in the Region of the Kidneys: He has continued the Medicines till a little while ago; but his Water has been in general perfectly clear, during the Use of
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>them; whereas it has twice been turbid upon discontinuing them, and deposits a red Sedi∣ment, which dries into a stony Substance.</P>

<HEAD>II. <HI>The Case of Mr.</HI> Binford, <HI>at Mr.</HI> Cameray<HI>'s, in</HI> Tokenhouse-yard, Throgmorton-street.</HEAD>
<P>HE had a Stone taken out of his Bladder by the Operation, when about Ten Years old; has had the Symptoms of a Stone in the Blad∣der now again, for about Six Years. A Sur∣geon at <HI>Exeter</HI> examined him twice by the Finger in the Anus, and found both times in the most evident manner a Stone in the Blad∣der, which he imagined to be as big as an Egg. Mr. <HI>Binford</HI> perceived the Motions of this Stone during the Examinations, and made bloody Water after one of them. He began Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines about the middle of last <HI>August,</HI> and in a short time after voided many white Scales, and much brown Grit in a soft and rotten State: Since this he has voided many irregular Shells of Stone, of a considerable Size, and of such a Thickness, as to consist of several Coats, from Two to Six in Number:
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>Many of these, when voided, are covered with a Whiteness, which being rubb'd off, the Shell appears to be brown. On the 30th of <HI>January</HI> he had a Suppression of Urine; Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> passed the Catheter then, and found a Stone in the Bladder, which he told Mr. <HI>Binford</HI> he believed to be very small, tho' he would not presume to be certain. Mr. <HI>Binford</HI> has voided many more Pieces of Stone since this, and Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> is in daily Expectation of his being perfectly well.</P>

<HEAD>III. <HI>The Case of Mr.</HI> Bolton, <HI>at the</HI> Sun <HI>and</HI> Dolphin <HI>in</HI> Cheapside, <HI>contained in a Letter directed to me.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TOWARDS the latter Part of my Life, when in my Fiftieth Year, about 1720, I was sore pained with the Stone, until I voided a large one; at several times since about a Dozen; Part came away after a little riding, and then I made Water like Coffee: But I imagine, one of the largest might stay behind; for in 1735 I began to be greatly afflicted; could not endure to ride, or bear a Coach: When I have been making Water, it often
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>stopped on a sudden, causing much Pain; and no Person in the Country could give Relief, tho' I took a many odd Things. Reading the Papers, I observed, some Specificks for the Stone were advertized, one a Powder, the other a Liquid: I got 'em, and try'd each; but was not able to go thro' with either of 'em; being of a forcing Nature, increased my Pain: Then was advised to smooth palliating Medi∣cines, yet Pain still continued, and excessive; made me begin to think of coming up to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> to be cut, if it might be safely done at my Age: At that time the News informed us, that the Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI> and others were cured by taking Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medi∣cines: I was then more inclinable to come: When I set out, my Thoughts were to un∣dergo the manual Operation, and had wrote to Mr. <HI>Cheselden</HI> about it: When I arrived in <HI>London,</HI> and consulted with some Friends, it was thought, as I was in my 68th Year, the safest way to take Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines; and accordingly on the 18th of <HI>July,</HI> 1737, I began with 'em, taking Three Powders, and Three half Pints of Liquid every Day: What Effect, and how they did operate, you will see by the following Diary, which I kept as exactly as I could, considering the Pain I had by times; which yet prompted me to keep strictly to the Medicines, believing, that by so doing, I should the sooner be made easy, and took the Liquid Four times a Day for some Weeks.</P>

<P>YOU may please to observe, I have had great Pain from the Stone, and the Medicine's Operation, but now being intirely free from any, may be compared to a Wo∣man in Travail; is forgotten, and do believe myself now to be cured of the Stone, having no Symptoms of that Kind.

<HEAD>IV. <HI>The Case of the Honourable Mr.</HI> Carteret, <HI>Postmaster General.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING been very much afflicted with the Stone and Gravel, and having by the best means I could, endeavour'd to get Relief, at length, in the utmost of my Extremity, I was recommended to Mrs. <HI>Stephens;</HI> and soon
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>after taking her Medicines, I began to bring away in my Urine a whitish Powder, which, when dry, appeared to be what came from a Stone. This continued for some time, and in about Two or Three Months I found my∣self freed from a Pain, I had felt at times for several Years, on the Right Side of the Bladder. And I am well assured, it was a Stone or cal∣culous Matter, which stuck to the Bladder. Besides this, I had a loose Stone in the Bladder, which for several Months after gave me ex∣treme Pain, by its forcing when I made Wa∣ter; which at length came away in Pieces, almost every time I made Water, for about Nine Weeks following; until at last it came all away, as appeared by my being freed from all manner of Pain. The Kernel of the Stone itself having come away, I thought myself then intirely well, tho' afterwards, upon a Journey to <HI>London,</HI> some Stones fell from my Kidneys, which came away to the Number of Seven at one time, which made me presume too far in discontinuing the Medicines in great Part, having little or no Pain; when a Stone, which had stuck in the Ureters, came down, and stopped the Passage of the Urine, which occasioned a Suppression of it, and out of Fear of its not passing, I had the Assistance of Mr. <HI>Cheselden;</HI> and, I thank God, I am now free of any Pain, and have been so ever since.</P>

<P>HAS had Pains in the Region of the Kid∣neys, with the voiding of small Stones, ever since the Year 1721. In <HI>August</HI> 1734, had a very bad Fit, but voided no Stone after it. In the <HI>October</HI> following found, that he could neither bear a Coach, ride, nor walk, without a great deal of Pain, and often make∣ing bloody Water. Had frequent Provocations to make Water, and made very little at a time. He began Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines on the Third of last <HI>October:</HI> Upon this his Water became white, and had small white Gravel in it, like Scrapings of Chalk. He was in great Pain for the first Month after he began the Medicines. <HI>November</HI> the Fourth he was examined by the Catheter, and a Stone was found in the Bladder. Since this he has voided several Scales like Egg-shells, white on one Side, and brown on the other, with many white rotten Bits of Stone. He is at present very easy, can walk very well, and continues the Use of the Medicines.</P>

<P>HE has been subject to Pains in his Back, with Vomitings, and the voiding of small Stones, for many Years. About Four or Five Years ago, after a Jolt in a Coach, he had a Pain in making Water, which con∣tinued about Three Weeks. In <HI>November</HI> 1736, after another Jolt, he had a Return of the same sort of Pain in making Water: This became very violent after some time, was often attended with a sudden Stoppage, and he had great Provocation to make Water, especially upon Motion: Made bloody Water after much Motion in the Chariot; had an uneasy Sen∣sation in the Region of the Bladder, upon turning in Bed, as if something moved within him. These Disorders continued about Four∣teen Months, at the End of which, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>February</HI> last, he began to take Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines. They increased his Pain in make∣ing Water very much for some Days; his Wa∣ter deposited a white heavy Sediment, and he voided many Flakes of Stone in a soft State, and some Fragments in a hard one. He grew easy and free from all Complaints in about Two Months, excepting that he had now and
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>then some small Pains in the Region of the Ureters. However, he continued the Use of the Medicines till the End of <HI>August,</HI> his Wa∣ter depositing a white heavy Sediment, till the last Ten Days or Fortnight of taking.

<HEAD>X. <HI>The Case of Mr.</HI> Thomas.</HEAD>
<P>HE had the usual Symptoms of a Stone in the Bladder, and began Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines in <HI>September</HI> last, being about 75 Years old. <HI>October</HI> the Eighth Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> examined him, and found a Stone in the Blad∣der, which he told Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> he believed to be a large one: Upon first taking the Me∣dicines Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Water deposited much heavy Sediment, which dried into a stony Substance: Some time after he voided soft white Scales in great Quantities with Grit and Slime, which I saw. His Pains were great at this time: They continued, he lost his Appe∣tite, grew feverish, and died <HI>Jan.</HI> 20. His Body was opened, and a Stone taken out of the Bladder. This Stone Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> saw <HI>Jan.</HI> 30. I saw Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> that Evening, and took down from his Mouth the
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>following Words, relating to the Appearance of the Stone.</P>
<Q>The Stone was light, white on the Outside, a great Part of it covered with a cretaceous Coat, which broke off in Flakes with great Ease, perfectly like to those before voided, as appeared by comparing them. The Stone would to any indifferent Person plainly ap∣pear as if acted upon by a Solvent, so as to have greatly diminished its Bulk. The inner Part of the Stone was reddish, and harder than the external, when tried by a Knife. There were Two Bulgings, which rose pretty high above the Stone, and which appeared to be less acted upon by the Solvent than the other Parts. The Stone was not covered equably with the same Coat, but what co∣vered one Part appeared to have been taken off in others.</Q>
<P>The next Day I saw Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> and took down from his Mouth the following Words relating to the Appearance of the Stone:
<Q>He saw a Stone weighing nearly Two Ounces, as Mrs. <HI>Thomas</HI> said. The Surface was of a whitish Colour, and in Part covered with a Matter that had all the Appearance of the soft Shells that had before come away in Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Water. This Matter was very soft, and ready to fall off and crumble upon the least Touch. By these Appearances he says, that he should imagine that the Stone had been larger, and that this soft Matter seem'd to he ready to fall off in a little time. The
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>Part of the Stone not covered with this scaly Matter, appeared, when scraped with a Knife, of a rusty Iron Colour, and considerably hard.</Q></P>
<P><HI>ANY Person who is disposed to inquire more particularly into the Effects of these Medi∣cines, may have a List of those that take them, at Mr.</HI> Winter<HI>'s, in</HI> Richbell-Court, Red-Lyon-street, <HI>from whence they are given out: However, I hope, these Ten Cases will be suffi∣cient to engage the Attention of all Well-Wishers to Mankind; and I have been determined in my Choice of them, rather by the Eminence of the Persons, by their living in Town, or by the strong Presumption of at least a partial Disso∣lution of a Stone, than by the Greatness of the Benefit received. Some of these are indeed complete Cures, as far as one can judge; but there are several others as complete among Per∣sons of less Note, or who live at a Distance from</HI> London; <HI>and that, with all the probable Cir∣cumstances of the gradual wasting and crum∣bling of Stones. There are also a great Number of unfinished Cases, which add much Light and Evidence to these Ten. Neither are these Medi∣cines prejudicial to the Body; but, on the con∣trary, have plainly improved the general Health of many, that have taken them. I still go on with my Inquiries in the most impartial manner I can; and should be extremely sorry, not only to deceive myself, but to be any Occasion of im∣posing upon others.</HI></P>

<PB REF="29"/>
<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS, Tending to ILLUSTRATE the Foregoing Cases.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. SINCE I have taken Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines, my Urine has been of a more urinous Smell than usual; tur∣bid at the time of making, and <HI>alkaline,</HI> that is, it turns Syrup of Violets green, and fer∣ments with the following acid Liquors, Oil of Vitriol, Spirit of Vitriol, Oil of Sulphur, Spi∣rit of Nitre, Spirit of Sea-Salt, Vinegar, and Lemon-Juice. And as far as I can judge, the Case is the same with all who take these Medi∣cines. This I thought very remarkable when I first observed it, and began to hope, that Urine, which was so different from common Urine, might have different Effects upon Stones in the Kidneys and Bladder. And I have lately been informed, that even common Urine, when it putrifies, that is, turns alka∣line
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>by being kept, will dissolve and take up the calculous Incrustations, upon the Sides and Bottoms of Chamber-pots.</P>
<P N="2">II. In order to satisfy myself the better in this Affair, I thought it not amiss to try what Effects my Urine, thus render'd alkaline by the Medicines, would have upon Stones taken from a human Body, by digesting them in it with a gentle Heat. For this Purpose I took the Stones A and B, and sawed each of them into Four Pieces, of nearly the same Shape and Size. A was a white hard Stone of an uniform Substance throughout. It consisted of Coats indeed, but these were all, as far as one could judge, perfectly alike. B was a brown Stone; it's Shell was hard and knotted, but the internal Parts were much softer. I called the several Pieces A 1, B 1; A 2, B 2; A 3, B 3; A 4, B 4; in order to denote thereby the several Liquors in which each was digested; 1 standing for New River Wa∣ter; 2 for a Mixture of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Powder and New River Water; 3 for com∣mon Urine; and 4 for my own Alkaline Urine. I then digested all these Pieces of Stone for a Week in their respective Liquors, with a gentle Heat. This Heat was intended to have been the same as that of Urine in the Blad∣der; but my Contrivances not being good, it was, at different Times, both considerably greater, and considerably less. I examined them pretty often, and recruited the Liquors as they wasted, with others of the same Kind.
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>Two or three Days after they were put into Digestion, I observed that A 4 had some white Scales lying upon its Surface in several Parts, which fell off upon being press'd with my Nail. After a Week's Digestion, I took them out, and rubb'd them all with a Cloth. They were then laid in a Window till they became perfectly dry. And the following Table shews the Effects which the several Liquors had upon them.</P>

<P N="3">III. By this Table it appears, that the Pieces A 4, B 4 in my alkaline Urine, had lost more than any of the others; A 1, B 1, in New River Water, more than A 2, B 2 in the Mixture of Mrs. <HI>Stephens's</HI> Powder and New River Water; and that A 3, B 3 in common Urine had receiv'd a small Addition. That my alkaline Urine should occasion the greatest Loss, is a Presumption in favour of Mrs. <HI>Ste∣phens</HI>'s Medicines; that the New River Wa∣ter should have a greater Effect, than the Mixture of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Powder and New
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>River Water, was owing, I believe, to the Powder's adhering closely to the Stones in se∣veral Parts; which both kept the Water from coming freely in Contact with the Stones, and also added to their Weight; and the In∣crease of Weight in A 3, B 3, is an Appear∣ance of the same Kind with the Growth of Stones in the Body. And upon examining A 3 accurately, I perceived that it had got an exceeding thin Coat in several Parts, which separated easily, and which I supposed to be an Accretion from the stony Particles of the common Urine, in which it had been digested.</P>
<P N="4">IV. After this I washed the several Pieces of the Stone A, and rubb'd them well with a Brush, so as to take off all loose Parts; I took out the soft internal Parts of the Pieces of B, reserving proper Portions of each of the hard Shells; I sawed the Stones C, D, and E into Four Pieces each, of nearly the same Shape and Size, and F into Two; I took Two Pieces of the white Shell G, Two of the brown Nucleus H, and gave them all Names as in the following Table, in which 1 denotes New River Water, as before; 2 Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Liquid; 3 common Urine, as before; and 4 my own alkaline Urine, as be∣fore. These Pieces were digested for a Week, in the Manner above-mentioned, excepting that the Liquors were now changed every Morning, and all the Pieces rubb'd at the same Time with a wet Sponge. They were rubb'd also when taken out as clean as could
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>be without Violence, and then laid in a Window till they were perfectly dry. And the following Table shows the Effects which the several Liquors had upon them.</P>

<P N="5">V. By this Table it appears, that the Stones had lost much more in general by this Week's Digestion, than by the former; which without doubt was owing in great measure to my hav∣ing rubbed them every Morning with a wet Sponge; and it was also upon this account, I suppose, that some of the Pieces in common Urine had lost a little. However, the great Difference of Loss in the several Pieces of the same Stone could not arise from this Cause; and the rubbing them gave me an Opportu∣nity of observing the Manner in which the several Liquors acted upon the Stones. This was, in general, giving a Whiteness to the Sur∣face of the Stones, which, when it was rubbed off, left the Stone of its former Colour; but in those which were most affected, soft white Scales fell off upon being rubbed, and some of them were corroded, and honey-combed. Thus the Pieces in New River Water had a White∣ness upon their Surface, and the Water itself became milky; A 2, A 4, C 2, C 4, F 4, and H 4 had all lost white Scales; B 2, E 2 and E 4 were all pretty much corroded; D 2 a little corroded; B 4 was corroded within, and at the same time its knotted external Sur∣face rendered smooth; D 4 had its brown Surface turned white, but G 4 seemed not to have been affected at all.</P>
<P N="6">VI. In order to satisfy myself still farther, I took all the foregoing Stones, H 3 and H 4 excepted, which were lost by reason of their Smallness; and digested them again in their
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>respective Liquors, having now got a Contri∣vance, by which they were kept in a Heat, not differing materially from that of Urine in the Bladder. I got also Two small round Stones from the Reverend Dr. <HI>Hales,</HI> which were both taken out of the Bladder of the same Person, and which the Doctor judged to be very hard ones, and called them I 3 and I 4. I 3 weighed Twenty-five Grains and an half, and was put into common Urine; I 4 weighed Twenty-one Grains and an half, and was put into my own alkaline Urine. I began the Digestion <HI>July</HI> 26. The Liquors were changed every Day during the whole Di∣gestion, and the Stones all rubbed with a wet Sponge every Day for the first Ten Days; then once in Three or Four Days till <HI>Sept.</HI> 3, but after that not at all. And the following Table shews the Day on which each Stone was either so far wasted as not to be found, or reduced to such a Size, as to be in Danger of being confounded with the small Pieces, which fell from the rest.</P>

<P>I omitted to set down the Day, on which C 4 was judged to be wasted; but I remember, that it was not till towards the latter End of the Digestion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. All this time the several Pieces in common Urine continued intire, and even had Incrustations upon them. I took them out <HI>Nov.</HI> 5. and having weighed them <HI>Nov.</HI> 15. when they were perfectly dry, found that they had all receiv'd an Increase of Weight, as in the following Table:</P>

<P N="8">VIII. The Manner in which the other Pieces wasted, was in general the same as that which is described above in the 6th Para∣graph, excepting that those in New River
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>Water became after some time as much honey∣combed as the rest, and wasted as fast; that D 4 and G 4 remained unaltered to Appear∣ance for a long time, and then grew quite rot∣ten in a few Days; and that I 4, the small hard Stone given me by Dr. <HI>Hales,</HI> had several Cracks in it, after about a Month's Digestion.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Besides these I made several other Ex∣periments, the Result of which it may not be improper just to mention.</P>
<P N="10">X. I digested different Pieces of the same Stones in my own alkaline Urine, with diffe∣rent Heats; the one, that of Urine in the Bladder, the other so great, that I could not bear my Hand at rest in it; and I found, that the less Heat had the greater Effect.</P>
<P N="11">XI. I boiled different Pieces of the same Stones in common Water, my own alkaline Urine, and common Urine, for Five Hours each. Those in Water and my Urine wasted considerably, and the Surface of the last was turned white and soft; but those in common Urine had little Effect produced upon them.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I digested different Pieces of the same Stones in common Water, the distilled Water of Water-Pepper, the Juice and the Decoc∣tion of it; and found that common Water had a greater Effect than any of these. The Heat in this and all the following Experiments did not differ materially from that of Urine in the Bladder.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. I digested Pieces of Stones taken from the human Bladder, from the Bladders of
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>Dogs, and the Stomachs of Horses, in <HI>Thames</HI> Water, and in Pump Water, and found, that both the Waters dissolved all the human Stones intirely, and wasted the others very much; but the <HI>Thames</HI> Water had the quickest Ef∣fect. The Waters were changed every Morn∣ing, at which time I observed, that the Pump Water poured on the Day before, had always some Bubbles upon it. Some of the human Stones were cracked during the Dissolution.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I digested Pieces of the same Dogs and Horses Stones in common Urine, and my own alkaline Urine; but did not observe any Effect, except that one of the Dog's Stones seemed a little softened by my Urine.</P>
<P N="15">XV. I digested a large Kidney-stone, Two Pieces that had been boiled in my alkaline Urine, and a round hard Stone in common Urine, which was a Mixture of different Urines. The Kidney-stone and the Two Pieces lost something of their Weight. The round hard Stone grew black at first, but whe∣ther it was wasted or not, I cannot determine from its Appearance, and I had not weighed it. The Surface of the Kidney-stone was rendered so brittle, that large Scales broke off with very little Force, but they were neither white nor soft.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. I digested a large Kidney-stone of the same Shape, Size and Texture, with the fore∣going, and taken out of the other Kidney of the same Person, with Twelve different Stones, or Pieces of Stones, in the alkaline Urine of a
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>Gentleman, who took Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medi∣cines. They all wasted very fast, excepting one Piece, which received a small Addition. It was iron-coloured, and exceedingly hard, as I found by sawing it. It appeared to me, that this Gentleman's Urine had in general a quicker Effect than my own. The Stones mentioned in this, the 10th, 13th, 14th and 15th Para∣graphs, were none of them rubbed.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. There are some Appearances men∣tioned in this Abstract, which I cannot ac∣count for; but if the Experiments were re∣peated with more Accuracy, and other new ones tried, it is probable, that many useful Discoveries would arise. And thus much I think one may venture to conclude, even from these Experiments, that the Dissolutions by the several Sorts of common Water prove against the absolute Necessity of an acrimo∣nious Liquid for this Purpose, and that those by the Two alkaline Urines are strong Pre∣sumptions in Favour of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Me∣dicines, especially when compared with the foregoing Cases. I shall be much obliged to any Gentleman, who will furnish me with Stones, for the farther Prosecution of this Matter.</P>
