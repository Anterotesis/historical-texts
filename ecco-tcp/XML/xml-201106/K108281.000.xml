They shall teach the children to read, to sew coloured and white seam, the washing and dressing of li∣nens, and such other parts of educa∣tion as belong to their different depart∣ments, and are pointed out to them by the Governours. They shall also have an eye over the morals and manners of the children, and correct those under their care for their faults. They shall

<P>THERE shall be chosen and ad∣mitted into the Hospital so many Girls as the stated and certain revenue shall be able to maintain and educate, with the reservation after provided. They shall be the children or grandchildren of such who are or were merchants, burgesses of Edinburgh, or ministers of Edinburgh, Canongate, Leith, or West Church, or who have been Governours of, or be∣nefactors
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>to the Hospital; reserving to Patrons their right of presenting any Girls who are objects of charity, un∣less, by the patronage, it be otherwise restricted, providing they present with∣in a year after every vacancy, other∣wise the presentation shall fall <HI>pro ista vice,</HI> and the Governours may elect a Girl to supply the vacancy, qualified as above expressed.</P>
<P>It is provided, that no girls be chosen or presented, either on patronage, or o∣therwise, who are under seven, or above eleven years of age. They must be wholesome, and sound in body and mind at their entry to the Hospital; and, seeing the intention of this foun∣dation is only to relieve the poor, none are to be chosen or admitted, until it is certified to the Governours that the pa∣rents are unable to maintain them, or that the children have not whereupon to maintain themselves; and the Go∣vernours are strictly required, on their consciences, to choose none but such as
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>are objects of this charity. It is also specially recommended to the Gover∣vours, not to receive into the Hospital a greater number of children than they can reasonably suppose the stated and clear revenue will easily maintain and educate, after the reservation of a cer∣tain part thereof, to be added to stock, for incidental expences, and for build∣ing a new Hospital, when found neces∣sary, as the present House is very old.</P>
<P>The ordinary election of Girls shall be twice in the year, viz. the last Mon∣days of November and May, when it is to be considered by the Governours what vacancies there are, and how ma∣ny the certain and stated revenue of the Hospital, making a reserve as above, is able to maintain, that so many, quali∣fied as above expressed, may be chosen. They shall have lodging, diet, clothing, washing, and common fires allowed them, besides education, suitable to the design of this charitable institution.</P>

<P>The Girls may continue in the Ho∣spital until they are seventeen years of age, and no longer; but, should any of them be guilty of any immorality or misbehaviour, or be disobedient to the Mistresses, they may be put out of the Hospital, if the Governours shall think they deserve to be expelled.</P>
<P>It is appointed and declared, that the ministers of Edinburgh, Canongate, Leith, and West Church, who have been very instrumental in promoting the interest of the Hospital, and their successors in office, shall jointly have the presentation of two girls in all time coming; the one unlimited, the other limited to a daughter or grand-daughter of a merchant-burgess of Edinburgh, or minister of the church of Scotland. And it is likewise hereby declared, that the successors of the worthy Mary Er∣skine shall, in all time coming, have the presentation of four girls, qualified in terms of the contract before mentioned.</P>
