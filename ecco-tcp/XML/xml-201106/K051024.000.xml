<HEAD>TO STUDENTS in <HI>Physic.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is universally agreed, that among the several other Branches of Learning, ne∣cessary to the Accomplish∣ment of those, who are Candidates in the Art of Healing; <HI>the judicious Instructions of an able, practical Physician, is a Qualifica∣tion of the first Moment.</HI> The Reason of the present Concession is very evident: Be∣cause
<PB N="ij" REF="3"/>the Pupil, as the Result of such an <HI>happy Institution,</HI> according to the <HI>Stand∣ing</HI> of his Professor, may, in <HI>a few Years,</HI> enter upon Business, with greater Advan∣tage, than he could possibly do, in <HI>many,</HI> without such Assistance. For myself, I own, I am too vain, not to account it a <HI>singular Felicity</HI> in my Life, that I have been bless'd with an Opportunity of at∣tending Sir RICHARD MANNINGHAM'S Lectures in <HI>Midwifery</HI> and <HI>Physic.</HI></P>
<P>I PAY a greater Deference to that GEN∣TLEMAN'S <HI>good Sense</HI> and <HI>distinguish'd Modesty,</HI> than either to affront <HI>the one,</HI> or insult <HI>the other,</HI> by attempting any thing, that might carry the Appearance of an <HI>En∣comium,</HI> tho' religiously confined to <HI>his just Praise:</HI> Nevertheless, as every <HI>gene∣rous</HI> and <HI>honest</HI> Mind would be equally careful, neither to offend against the Laws of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to an ingenious Tutor, for the most <HI>instructive Dictates;</HI> nor those of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI> due to the Public, for whose Service, Gentlemen, you are pre∣paring:
<PB N="iij" REF="4"/>I expect it be allowed me, on the <HI>present Occasion,</HI> as a necessary Instance of <HI>Duty</HI> to Both; that I am at Liberty to de∣clare, I want no Veneration for Sir RI∣CHARD'S <HI>Whole Course.</HI>—It is composed, indeed, of <HI>Two grand Branches,</HI> which are those of <HI>Midwifery</HI> and <HI>Physic.</HI> The <HI>for∣mer</HI> of these is by no means destitute of its Beauties: Such as the <HI>Improvements</HI> in the <HI>Apparatus</HI> itself; the <HI>Chastity</HI> of the Insti∣tution; and the <HI>Exclusion</HI> of all Instru∣ments.—For the first: The <HI>greater Ma∣chine</HI> is the <HI>most finish'd,</HI> in its way, that has, as yet, ever appeared, for conduct∣ing the <HI>different Kinds</HI> of <HI>Deliveries;</HI> while the <HI>Glass Machine</HI> gives ocular Proof of the <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Justness</HI> of the Rules to be observed in <HI>Operations</HI> on the Other; and, consequently, in <HI>Genuine Labours.</HI>—For the next: It is not possible, by <HI>this Manner</HI> of Instruction, to give the least Offence to the <HI>chastest Mind,</HI> the most <HI>scrupulous Modesty.</HI> — And with respect to the Affair of <HI>Instruments:</HI> It is evident
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>to a Demonstration, from <HI>this Method</HI> of Practice, that there is so little Occasion for the present <HI>frequent</HI> Use of them, that excepting in a <HI>Case</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> which but <HI>rarely</HI> happen; the <HI>judicious Management</HI> of the Hand, is all that is required in the Art of <HI>Midwifery.</HI></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, I abhor <HI>Flattery</HI> and <HI>Ostentation:</HI> And I cannot but persuade myself, you will acquit me of <HI>Both,</HI> when I assure you, I should, at no rate, have taken upon me to have been either so <HI>par∣ticular,</HI> or <HI>positive</HI> in the Articles above, if I were not very well acquainted, with <HI>the utmost,</HI> that has been done <HI>Abroad</HI> on the Subject of <HI>Midwifery.</HI> I studied under Two Masters, the late Messieurs GRE∣GOIRE and DUSSÉ, at PARIS; and came from thence with no small Freight of <HI>Self-sufficiency</HI> and <HI>Confidence:</HI> Nor is it <HI>proba∣ble</HI> to me, I should ever have been dispos∣sess'd of my <HI>personal Prejudices</HI> and <HI>dan∣gerous Mistakes</HI> (especially in the Use of <HI>Instruments</HI>) had I not fell under Sir RI∣CHARD's
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>Institution, and formed myself on <HI>His Practice.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things notwithstanding: As I always thought the matter of <HI>Deliveries</HI> the least Branch of the <HI>Man-Midwife's</HI> Character; and was assured, that He would ever have most Success in <HI>Operations,</HI> who was best acquainted with the <HI>Structure</HI> of the <HI>Human Body:</HI> So I could not help be∣ing especially charmed with those Lectures in Sir RICHARD's Course, which proper∣ly belong to the <HI>latter</HI> Branch, the Head of <HI>Physic.</HI> The <HI>superior Utility</HI> of the Subject will excuse my passionate Regard on this Part: Since it is plain, that the Science, which leads to a <HI>general View</HI> of the <HI>animal Machine,</HI> and to a <HI>perfect Know∣ledge</HI> of all the <HI>Diseases</HI> to which the whole Nature, in common, is incident; must be vastly preferable to all that is <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>confined,</HI> however <HI>exalted</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> in it∣self.</P>
<P>WHAT was last observed, Gentlemen, you will please to remember, is designed,
<PB N="vj" REF="7"/>not only to account for the <HI>extraordinary Pains</HI> I was at in securing this Lecture; but is also offered as a Reason, why you are to believe it <HI>tolerably correct.</HI> For the <HI>latter</HI> indeed, you have this additional As∣surance, that I had not only several Op∣portunities of attending the Repetition of it; but was, moreover, allow'd the pecu∣liar Indulgence of taking it in <HI>short-hand,</HI> as delivered.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, it would give me no small Pain, were I the least apprehensive, I was taking <HI>any Freedom,</HI> that might <HI>justly</HI> ex∣pose me to the Resentment of Sir RI∣CHARD MANNINGHAM: But, I flatter myself with less Danger in this Point, so far as concerns the <HI>present Publication,</HI> however; since, I am only indulging the <HI>English Reader</HI> with his excellent <HI>Method of Investigating Diseases,</HI> in the manner he explain'd it to Us, in his <HI>first</HI> Evening's Lecture in <HI>Physic;</HI> at the same time, that it is to be observed, he has already com∣municated <HI>the Method itself</HI> to the learned
<PB N="vij" REF="8"/>World in his <HI>Latin Compendium:</HI> Tho' some of <HI>the best Judges</HI> have acknowledg∣ed it's Claim to an <HI>higher Title.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is one Circumstance, Gentle∣men, of great Importance in the present Lecture, I mean: That the whole Argu∣ment is built on <HI>the most venerable Anti∣quity,</HI> and not on any <HI>precarious, modern Theories.</HI> I take the Liberty of inserting this <HI>previous Hint;</HI> not but your own At∣tention in Reading would have excused me the Trouble; because you will from hence immediately argue its <HI>intrinsic Va∣lue,</HI> and give more boldly into its <HI>Use.</HI>—The <HI>Histories of Diseases,</HI> originally put together by the <HI>most accurate Observations</HI> of HIPPOCRATES, and established on <HI>the Authority</HI> of his Successors, <HI>the most celebrated ancient Physicians,</HI> is here <HI>your Standard.</HI> Nature, since her various <HI>morbid Phaenomena</HI> were, in <HI>their</HI> manner, first reduced to <HI>any regular System,</HI> ap∣pears to have suffered <HI>no Deviation</HI> for some thousand Years past; nor can, in∣deed,
<PB N="viij" REF="9"/>be capable of any, for the future, while <HI>the animal Oeconomy,</HI> and <HI>the Laws,</HI> under which the human Species continues to act, remain <HI>invariable.</HI></P>
<P>I WISH nothing more ardently, than that, as the Subject, on which the Lecture before you is rais'd, is of <HI>general Use</HI> in itself; and it is hardly possible, every Stu∣dent's <HI>Situation</HI> should allow him an Op∣portunity of attending on <HI>the Spot:</HI> Those, into whose Hands it may now fall, may find as much <HI>Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> in receiving it from the Press, as the Pub∣lisher has perpetually retained, since he first took it from Sir RICHARD's own Mouth. I am,</P>

<HEAD>The CERTAIN METHOD to KNOW the DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Course of our LECTURES in <HI>Physic,</HI> we propose, chiefly to confine ourselves to <HI>the Diseases of Children,</HI> from <HI>Infancy</HI> up to <HI>ripe Age;</HI> and to the <HI>Diseases,</HI> peculiar to <HI>the Female Sex;</HI> those especially, belonging to <HI>Pregnancy</HI> and <HI>Childbed:</HI> Nevertheless, as Women are liable to all the Di∣stempers incident to Men, besides the many pecu∣liar to their own Sex, as they are, by Nature, or∣dained for the Preservation of Mankind; it will be necessary, in a great measure, to treat of Dis∣eases at large; and more particularly of <HI>Fevers,</HI> which, indeed, make up a very great Part of the Disorders that afflict us, and do also associate themselves, with every other Disease: <HI>Febris, maxime communis Morbus, omnium aliorum Morborum, praecipue Inflammationis, comes est.</HI> HIPPOCRATES. The Truth of which we daily experience; and, moreover, often observe that, a
<PB N="2" REF="11"/><HI>Fever</HI> shall even elude <HI>that Method</HI> of curing a Disease, which, without a Fever, has been gene∣rally found successful; an Observation well wor∣thy our particular Notice.</P>
<P>WOMEN with Child, and in Childbed, are often afflicted with Distempers, no ways <HI>cognate</HI> to <HI>Pregnancy</HI> or Childbed; especially <HI>Fevers</HI> of all Kinds, whose Essence and Nature, indeed, differ nothing from other Fevers, and require a like Me∣thod of Cure; yet, by reason of their happening at the Times above-mentioned, are attended with greater Difficulties in Curing, and demand our greatest Caution and Prudence, in the Administra∣tion of the proper Remedies for the Fever; the Physician at this time, not being at Liberty, so freely to make use of Bleeding, Vomiting, Blistring, Sweating, Purging, and Method of Diet: And during Pregnancy, our chief View must always be <HI>to prevent a Miscarriage,</HI> or even <HI>the bringing on of Labour,</HI> whenever the Disease has no <HI>Affinity</HI> to Pregnancy. For tho' Diseases, which are ow∣ing to Pregnancy, either decrease, or go off upon Delivery; yet, those which are no ways <HI>cognate,</HI> are for the most part found to increase after the Delivery; and as HIPPOCRATES observes: <HI>Si mulier, Utero gestans, morbum habuerit non cogna∣tum, in Puerperii purgatione, perit.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE, as in all Diseases not <HI>cognate</HI> to Pregnancy, our chief View, as I observed above, must be, to prevent <HI>Abortion</HI> and <HI>untimely La∣bour;</HI> so in all Diseases happening in Childbed,
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>our principal Aim, must <HI>then</HI> be directed, to the due Regulation of the <HI>Lochia.</HI> Many, and great Dif∣ficulties surround us, in this dangerous and com∣plicated Situation, which exact our most diligent Care and Attention: And, as it is <HI>oftentimes</HI> no easy Matter to distinguish between the <HI>cognate Di∣stemper,</HI> and that which has <HI>no relation</HI> to Preg∣nancy or Childbed; and at <HI>all times,</HI> very difficult rightly and safely to conduct Affairs, in this nice and critical Situation; I shall therefore, in my subsequent Lectures, endeavour, to the best of my Judgment and Knowledge, to inform and direct you in each Particular, from the repeated Obser∣vations of the most approved Authors in Physic, both ancient and modern; and also from Experi∣ences and Successes, collected from my own <HI>Ad∣versaria,</HI> confirming their Doctrine; besides which, I shall illustrate each Case, by the particular Ap∣plication of the Method of <HI>Investigating</HI> the Na∣ture of all Diseases.</P>
<P>IT is a Maxim universally received among Phy∣sicians: <HI>That Medicine should begin, where Philoso∣phy ends.</HI> And as it is, undoubtedly, a necessary Qualification in a Physician to be knowing in <HI>Phi∣losophy;</HI> and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> is that Part of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> which is more especially conducive to the Knowledge of the Practice of Physic: I make no doubt, but you, Gentlemen, who have in <HI>this City</HI> the best Opportunities of being instructed in this Branch of Science; especially by that most accurate, and excellent Anatomist and Physician, Dr. NICHOLLS; who, it must be confessed, is an Ornament
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>of our Profession, and worthy of singular Praise: I say, I make no doubt, but with such Advantages, you have already obtained a competent Knowledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> and will, therefore, be enabled to make the best Use of our Lectures, and Method of <HI>Investigating</HI> the Nature of Dis∣eases.</P>
<P>NOW, the human Body, we all know, may be properly considered, as <HI>a most perfect Machine;</HI> whose Parts are extremely well configurated and joined together; whose Symmetry is most beauti∣ful; and whose Actions, resulting from this admi∣rable Compages, are reciprocally carried on by So∣lids and Fluids, of which it is made up. And as many of its <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Motions,</HI> are easily demon∣strated to be the <HI>necessary Consequences</HI> of it's <HI>Stru∣cture;</HI> so its <HI>Diseases,</HI> and all their <HI>Symptoms,</HI> are only the <HI>irregular Motions,</HI> or <HI>Disorders</HI> of this very complicated Machine: Nor is the Case the least altered, that we have a <HI>Principle</HI> within us, not subject, in itself, to the Laws of Motion.</P>
<P>IT is, therefore, highly incumbent on every one, who would attain to the <HI>due Knowledge</HI> of the Art of Healing, that he make himself very well acquainted with this curious Machine: that know∣ing well the <HI>Parts,</HI> and the <HI>natural Actions,</HI> and <HI>Secretions</HI> of the human Body; he may be enabled to judge, <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> these natural Actions are <HI>perverted:</HI> all the Symptoms of Diseases, being the necessary Consequences of the <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy.</HI> It's Actions therefore being per∣formed
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>by <HI>Fluids</HI> secerned from the Blood; without the Knowledge of <HI>Secretions,</HI> we cannot under∣stand the <HI>Nature of Diseases: Secretion</HI> being the <HI>Spring</HI> of all <HI>animal Functions.</HI> Wherefore, the greater our Knowledge is of the <HI>Animal Oecono∣my,</HI> the more likely we shall be, to discover the <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of its Diseases; and of course be better enabled to <HI>rectify</HI> all its Disorders.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE is, no doubt, of great and necessary Use, in promoting the Art of curing Diseases, if directed by a Knowledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> forasmuch as it is only by a just reason∣ing on our Experiences, that we can come at the Knowledge of any Phaenomenon of Nature. So that <HI>Experience,</HI> or the Knowledge of the <HI>Histories of Diseases,</HI> added to that of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> is what can only make a Physician; and, where∣ever the <HI>History of a Disease</HI> is exactly known, if the <HI>right Method</HI> of curing it <HI>cannot be deduced,</HI> it must be, because the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> is not <HI>suffi∣ciently understood:</HI> For our Skill in curing Diseases, whose <HI>Histories</HI> are exactly known, is, for the most part, proportional to our Knowledge of the <HI>Ani∣mal Oeconomy.</HI> For in order to find out the <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of a Distemper, and from them to de∣duce a <HI>right Method</HI> of Cure, it will be absolutely necessary to reason on <HI>those Histories;</HI> which we cannot do, as we ought, if we are ignorant of the <HI>Structure</HI> of the <HI>Machine,</HI> we are about to <HI>rectify.</HI></P>
<P>DESCRIPTIONS and <HI>Diagnostic Signs</HI> of Diseases, are the proper Business of <HI>Observation</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>and <HI>Experience;</HI> but, <HI>Indications</HI> of Cure arise from <HI>our reasoning</HI> upon those Observations. <HI>Di∣agnostics</HI> are properly a Collection of <HI>particular Symptoms</HI> only; but <HI>Indications</HI> are those <HI>Conclusi∣ons,</HI> which our Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oecono∣my</HI> enables us to make on these <HI>Observations,</HI> and <HI>Descriptions:</HI> So that the <HI>Histories</HI> of Diseases, and the Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> must al∣ways go hand in hand, in order to the obtaining the <HI>due Knowledge</HI> of the Practice of Physic. He therefore, who is sufficiently knowing in <HI>Philoso∣phy</HI> and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> and makes <HI>a proper Use</HI> of this Knowledge, by <HI>reasoning on real Facts,</HI> grounded on <HI>repeated Experience</HI> and <HI>Observation,</HI> may justly be said to use his <HI>Philosophy</HI> aright; and may then reasonably hope for Success, in finding out the <HI>genuine Indications</HI> of Cure, in which, the Practice of Physic chiefly consists: And without this <HI>Caution</HI> our <HI>Reasonings</HI> will certainly be to ve∣ry little purpose.</P>
<P>THE great HIPPOCRATES has this Assertion: That <HI>Nature cures Diseases.</HI> The Truth of it we, of this Day, may experience, if we will carefully keep up to his <HI>excellent Directions,</HI> and <HI>Method:</HI> It being his only Aim to <HI>relieve Nature</HI> when op∣pressed, in the <HI>very Way,</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> he observed <HI>her endeavouring to expel Diseases.</HI> And it was by <HI>a constant Diligence</HI> of this Kind, joined with his <HI>wonderful Sagacity,</HI> that he arrived to that great Degree of Perfection in the Knowledge of Physic: Hence he perceived that, <HI>Nature herself judges Diseases;</HI> and, indeed, does all, being <HI>properly as∣sisted;</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>nay, and, sometimes, <HI>without any Assist∣ance.</HI></P>
<P>HIPPOCRATES also informs us, and our <HI>own Experience</HI> cannot but <HI>confirm</HI> it: That those People who have <HI>Fevers,</HI> and are <HI>left to themselves,</HI> and take <HI>no Medicines;</HI> if they do recover, get rid of their <HI>Fevers</HI> by <HI>Sweating, a Looseness, an Haemor∣rhage, Diabetes,</HI> or the like: From whence HIP∣POCRATES, and the ancient Practitioners in Phy∣sic, took their <HI>first Intimation</HI> to provoke <HI>Sweat</HI> and the <HI>other Evacuations.</HI> And from their <HI>re∣peated Observations</HI> and <HI>Successes,</HI> they have form∣ed for us, a most <HI>rational Method</HI> of Cure. And if we duly consider, and attend to the <HI>different Ways</HI> by which <HI>Nature extricates herself</HI> from Dis∣eases, when <HI>left to herself;</HI> we shall soon be con∣vinced, that <HI>they are not the confused</HI> and <HI>disordered Effects</HI> of Nature, <HI>ill defending herself;</HI> but, in fact, the <HI>gradual, steady,</HI> and <HI>measured Operati∣ons</HI> of that <HI>exquisite Mechanism,</HI> and <HI>innate, inces∣sant Principle</HI> of <HI>Self-preservation,</HI> with which <HI>Pro∣vidence</HI> has been pleased to endow our Bodies: A very strong Confirmation of the <HI>Necessity</HI> of a <HI>care∣ful</HI> and <HI>diligent Observance</HI> of the <HI>Tendencies</HI> of Na∣ture, in all her Disorders; and the <HI>Method</HI> she takes to get rid of Diseases, when left to herself: And also, a very <HI>good Caution</HI> to us all, <HI>not to be over hasty,</HI> or <HI>too busy</HI> in the Administration of our Remedies; lest we should be found to <HI>ruffle</HI> and <HI>disturb,</HI> rather than <HI>assist Nature,</HI> with the <HI>untime∣ly Use,</HI> or <HI>Multitude</HI> of our Medicines. And re∣ally, <HI>the Ne quid nimis,</HI> in the Practice of Physic,
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>is a Matter of no small Consequence. He there∣fore, in my Opinion, is most likely to prove <HI>the best, most prudent,</HI> and <HI>rational Physician,</HI> who <HI>most diligently observes,</HI> and <HI>constantly follows,</HI> the <HI>Motions,</HI> and <HI>Dictates of Nature herself.</HI></P>
<P>IF an altogether <HI>new Distemper</HI> should at any time arise among us, the only Way of getting into the Nature of such <HI>new Disease,</HI> would be to copy HIPPOCRATES's Example; I mean, <HI>his Me∣thod of observing,</HI> joined to <HI>the Rule</HI> of finding out the Nature of Diseases: For we must, first, be led by <HI>Symptoms</HI> to find a Disease; after that it's <HI>Nature,</HI> and from <HI>thence</HI> the Method of Cure. And here it may be proper to observe, that there are <HI>several Seasons,</HI> which have Diseases <HI>peculiar</HI> to themselves; and may, in some measure, indeed, be called <HI>new Diseases:</HI> It will therefore be necessary to know, and carefully observe <HI>the Seasons,</HI> as HIPPOCRATES, and, our renowned Countryman, SYDENHAM advise; wherein <HI>such Diseases</HI> are wont to appear; otherwise we shall be unsuccessful in <HI>curing</HI> the Diseases <HI>peculiar</HI> to those <HI>different Seasons.</HI> It must also be observed, that <HI>these Dis∣eases</HI> are generally <HI>stated,</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> in <HI>each Con∣stitution,</HI> and have <HI>an Affinity</HI> to each other: He therefore, who is able to come at the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>one Epidemical Distemper, in any Constitu∣tion,</HI> hath an Advantage in the Cure of <HI>all the other.</HI> For tho' they may <HI>differ</HI> in several respects, yet they require something <HI>common</HI> in their Cure, as proceeding from <HI>a common Cause.</HI> And <HI>a few Cases</HI> diligently enquired into, by recollecting and
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>carefully examining their <HI>Symptoms,</HI> as directed by <HI>our Method</HI> of discovering the Nature of Diseases; will be sufficient to give us the <HI>Nature, Causes,</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> of Cure, of the Disease of <HI>every Constitu∣tion</HI> whatever. Here we can by no means omit a pertinent Observation of CELSUS: <HI>Quod si jam incidat Mali</HI> genus aliquod ignotum, <HI>non ideo ta∣men fore Medico de</HI> rebus <HI>cogitandum</HI> obscuris; <HI>sed eum protinus visurum, cui morbo id</HI> proximum <HI>sit; tentaturum{que} remedia</HI> fimilia <HI>illis, quae</HI> vicino malo <HI>saepe succurrerint, &amp; per ejus</HI> similitudinem <HI>opem reperturum.</HI></P>
<P>THE many accurate and charming <HI>Descriptions</HI> of Distempers, delivered down to us by HIPPO∣CRATES in his <HI>Histories</HI> of Diseases; wherein the Phaenomena of <HI>each Distemper,</HI> even in its minu∣test Circumstances, are observed; present us with a most exquisite Delineation of Nature: and if duly attended, will always be found, of the great∣est Service for advancing our Progress in the Art of Healing. Because, from his <HI>Diagnostics in particu∣lar,</HI> and others of the <HI>Antients,</HI> and <HI>such</HI> among the <HI>Moderns,</HI> who have closely copied after <HI>His manner;</HI> we readily discover the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Disease. And as, whenever we arrive at the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>exact History</HI> of any Distemper, whether from Books, or our own careful Observations; we may, at all times, by the right and diligent Application of the <HI>Method of Investigation,</HI> most assuredly dis∣cover the <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>conjunct</HI> Cause; so may we likewise, on those Principles, easily come at the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Disease; when, having that
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>given, it will be no difficult matter to find out <HI>Re∣medies</HI> to Cure, in all <HI>curable</HI> Cases; and to admi∣nister <HI>Relief,</HI> even in those, which are <HI>incurable.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>unwearied Diligence</HI> in Observation, and <HI>close Attendance</HI> on Nature in that <HI>sagacious,</HI> great Man HIPPOCARTES, and others of the <HI>Antients;</HI> might probably be heightened in them, from the <HI>Scantiness</HI> of their <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and the ex∣ceeding <HI>Harshness</HI> of the <HI>then known Remedies;</HI> however, much to our Benefit: since the excellent <HI>Descriptions</HI> of Diseases they have given us, can not only <HI>never be exceeded,</HI> but will <HI>always remain invariably true,</HI> while Human Nature continues the same. And had those of later Ages, who have been so happily provided with a more copious and salutary <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> and who, it must be allowed, have been greatly improved in the Know∣ledge of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> had these, I say, constantly persevered in the Use of HIPPOCRA∣TES'S <HI>great Diligence</HI> and <HI>Manner of observing;</HI> they might, doubtless, long ago, have brought the Practice of Physic to a considerable Degree of Per∣fection; tho' they had not been bless'd with his <HI>extraordinary Sagacity:</HI> For that, indeed, is a pe∣culiar Happiness, and the Lot of a very few; in which Particular, I believe, we may say of the Physician, as is commonly done of the Poet: <HI>Na∣scitur, non fit.</HI></P>
<P>Now, should we of this Age, flushed with our superior Knowledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> and the Variety of our <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> neglect to
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>make use of that <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Diligence,</HI> which is necessary in attending the <HI>Motions</HI> and <HI>Intentions</HI> of Nature; and, instead of endeavouring to <HI>assist her</HI> on these Principles, when oppress'd, become too <HI>precipitate</HI> and <HI>officious,</HI> in the Administration of our Medicines; the Consequence will inevitably be, that we shall only <HI>obscure the Disease,</HI> by <HI>mul∣tiplying,</HI> rather than <HI>taking off the Symptoms;</HI> and this to our own personal Confusion, the manifest Injury of our Patients, and the great Disrepute of our Profession. Whereas, would we consult <HI>the true</HI> and <HI>proper Use</HI> of the many happy <HI>Improve∣ments</HI> of our own Age, I think, it cannot be done more effectually, than by keeping close to our most skilful Leader, HIPPOCRATES; together with the ancient Practitioners in Physick, in <HI>their Manner</HI> of observing, and in <HI>their Method</HI> of heal∣ing; founded upon the Knowledge of the <HI>conjunct Causes</HI> of <HI>Distempers,</HI> from whence alone, the <HI>cu∣rative Indications</HI> are to be taken: agreeable to the Method <HI>here</HI> mentioned, and HIPPOCRATES'S Manner of observing. And by a careful <HI>Perseve∣rance</HI> in these Methods, I imagine, we may rea∣sonably hope for the greatest Success; and may, perhaps, in a few Ages, arrive at the highest Per∣fection in the Practice of Physic, that human Na∣ture is capable of attaining.</P>
<P>FROM what I have already advanced, you will naturally conclude, that it is <HI>no easy Matter</HI> to be∣come <HI>a prudent</HI> and <HI>skilful Physician:</HI> Much Read∣ing, much Thought and Pains will really be re∣quired; many Things are necessary to be learnt▪
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>much <HI>Diligence</HI> in Inquiry, much <HI>Assiduity</HI> in Observation is to be used, before we can be <HI>duly</HI> qualified, either with Peace of Mind to ourselves, or Relief to our Patients, to undertake a Trust, in which the Lives of our Fellow-creatures are so nearly concerned.</P>
<P>IF this be a just State of the Case, what shall we say of those Persons, who boldly take upon them the Practice of Physic, without <HI>the least pre∣vious Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Requisites</HI> absolutely neces∣sary for <HI>the regular Discharge</HI> of this important Office? Certainly it can be no other than the <HI>great∣est Folly,</HI> and the <HI>highest Presumption,</HI> for Those to expect <HI>Success,</HI> or hope for <HI>a Blessing</HI> on their En∣deavours; who are <HI>altogether ignorant</HI> of the Pro∣vince in which they engage: And would such Persons but give themselves Time to reflect, and seriously consider, the <HI>great Consequence</HI> of Physic, in the <HI>practical Part</HI> of it; where Life itself is so immediately at stake: I am persuaded, they would not thus <HI>rashly</HI> venture to administer Medi∣cines, <HI>before</HI> they had acquired the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>ne∣cessary Qualifications.</HI></P>
<P>IT is <HI>a mighty Mistake,</HI> that has seized some of our young Candidates in Physic, who are <HI>not much addicted to Study</HI> or <HI>Pains-taking,</HI> to ima∣gine: That, if they are but well furnished with <HI>Books of Recipes,</HI> they have <HI>every Qualification</HI> suf∣ficient to commence Doctor upon; because in <HI>those Books,</HI> as they think, agreeable to the com∣mon Saying, they are sure to find a <HI>Salve for every
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>Sore.</HI> But, alas! these <HI>base, empirical Books,</HI> the Pest of the present Age, will <HI>greatly deceive them.</HI> They are by no means to be confided in; but, on the contrary, are rather to be looked upon as <HI>very injurious:</HI> Forasmuch as they only furnish <HI>all Sorts of People,</HI> with great Opportunities of <HI>destroy∣ing each other's Health.</HI> And should any Person pretend to set up to practise Physic on <HI>this deceitful Foundation,</HI> He would soon find himself <HI>miserably misled;</HI> to the great and manifest Injury of Him∣self, as well as his Patients. For it is most cer∣tain, that <HI>every Medicine,</HI> be it never so good, must always be administer'd in <HI>the most proper Dose,</HI> and at the <HI>most proper Times</HI> of the Disease, to make it of <HI>any Advantage</HI> to the Patient; but the Chance of the Mischief arising from the <HI>con∣trary Practice,</HI> no one, I think, would covet: Yet this Knowledge can no otherwise be come at, than in the <HI>arduous</HI> and <HI>diligent Manner</HI> of study∣ing above-mention'd; join'd with <HI>the Method of In∣vestigating</HI> the Nature of Diseases. Not that this is the <HI>only</HI> Advantage, which follows on our Do∣ctrine of <HI>Investigation;</HI> fince it not only leads us into the <HI>true Nature</HI> of the Disease, and the <HI>cer∣tain Method of Cure;</HI> but also, at the same time, into the <HI>very Nature</HI> and <HI>Power of Medicines them∣selves,</HI> if rightly attended to and applied. And were it possible, even to find out an <HI>Universal Re∣medy</HI> for all Distempers; it must still be subject to the <HI>due Timeing</HI> and <HI>Dosing;</HI> the <HI>accurate Know∣ledge</HI> of which, can no otherwise be obtained, than by the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> already laid down. And this, indeed, is the only <HI>real</HI> and <HI>true Arca∣num,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>in the Practice of Physic. All your <HI>Pana∣ceas, Nostrums, Specifics,</HI> and the like; without this <HI>perfect Knowledge of administring them,</HI> in the <HI>most proper Dose,</HI> and at the <HI>most proper Times of the Disease,</HI> will, for the most part, prove very <HI>mischievous.</HI> And here the Opinion of the late learned Professor BOERHAAVE concurs with us: <HI>Nec speciosos Medicamentorum titulos Morbis addidi. Cur? Nihil Arti exitiale magis novi; neque verò ipse ullum cognosco, quin</HI> solo tempestivo Usu tale fiat.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOERHAAVE in Epistola Aphorismis praefixa.</NOTE> And these Remedies can only, by the <HI>greatest Hazard</HI> and <HI>Chance</HI> imaginable, ever prove of <HI>good Effect,</HI> in <HI>any Disease</HI> of <HI>Consequence:</HI> Tho' we all know, indeed, that, in many Cases, let the Medicine given be ever so <HI>improper</HI> in itself, or ever so <HI>unseasonably</HI> administer'd; the <HI>Strength</HI> of Nature may sometimes get the better of both. But this is by no means <HI>Curing;</HI> nor can it be <HI>any Excuse</HI> for our <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus prepared you for <HI>the Method</HI> to be observed in <HI>finding out the Distemper;</HI> I shall now proceed to give it you, in the <HI>plainest,</HI> and <HI>most methodical Manner,</HI> I am able.</P>
<P>I CANNOT introduce, what I have to offer on this Head, with greater Advantage, than by laying before you, the following <HI>practical</HI> Observation of SCHEFFLER: <HI>Ut Rationalis Medicus curativis Sco∣pis satisfacere, Materias Medicas invenire, inventis rectè uti valeat: non satis erit, Vires custodire, &amp; morbificas Causas amovere; sed &amp; Morbi Speciem,
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>&amp; Locum affectum exquisitè cognitum habeat, necessè est.</HI></P>
<P>AGREEABLE with this, you will observe that, in order to <HI>Cure any Disease,</HI> it is necessary to have a <HI>thorough Knowledge of the Disease itself,</HI> and of the <HI>Remedy peculiarly adapted to it;</HI> it being im∣possible to cure a Disease <HI>according to Art,</HI> if the <HI>Nature of the Disease</HI> be hid from the Artist: And for <HI>want</HI> of this Knowledge, the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Pains</HI> of many Physicians have proved <HI>ineffectual.</HI> For these Physicians, for the most part, making little other Use of the <HI>Diagnostic Symptoms,</HI> than the <HI>mere naming</HI> the Distemper only; have, very inju∣diciously, taken their <HI>Indications</HI> of Cure, from <HI>se∣condary</HI> and <HI>casual Symptoms:</HI> Whereas the <HI>true Nature of a Disease</HI> is ever <HI>best found out,</HI> from the <HI>Diagnostic Signs</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> alone; and from thence also, the <HI>true Indications</HI> of Cure, must always be drawn, in order to <HI>the best</HI> and <HI>most effectual Me∣thod</HI> of curing the Disease. And as <HI>these Indicati∣ons</HI> wholly arise from <HI>our Reasoning</HI> upon the <HI>Ob∣servations</HI> of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature; therefore, the <HI>greater</HI> our Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oecono∣my</HI> is, the <HI>better</HI> we shall be enabled to find out the <HI>Nature of the Disease.</HI> For 'tis the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> alone, which must enable us, by <HI>reason∣ing</HI> upon the <HI>Causes, Signs,</HI> and <HI>Symptoms</HI> of Dis∣eases, to find out <HI>their Natures,</HI> and to deduce <HI>true</HI> and <HI>just Indications</HI> of Cure.</P>
<P>THIS, however, in general; more expressly: To come at the <HI>true Method of investigating all Dis∣eases,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>incident to the Human Body; and from thence proceed to the <HI>most effectual Methods of treating</HI> and <HI>curing them;</HI> the solid Knowledge of the <HI>following Particulars</HI> is absolutely required, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>next,</HI> and <HI>ever-concomitant Cause</HI> of the Disease.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Part affected.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Passages,</HI> thro' which the Evil takes its Course.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>inseparable Signs</HI> of the Distemper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>Symptoms,</HI> which <HI>commonly accompany</HI> the Disease; and</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That we be careful the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of the Dis∣ease are <HI>rightly distinguished.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IF we err not in these <HI>main Points,</HI> we are in the <HI>right Way</HI> of arriving to an <HI>happy Cure</HI> of the Dis∣ease.</P>
<P>IT is very necessary at all times, carefully to <HI>distinguish</HI> between the <HI>Disease itself,</HI> and the <HI>Sym∣ptom;</HI> the want of which has been <HI>the Stumbling∣stone</HI> of some, even very learned Men, in all Ages: Since it is to be imputed to the <HI>want of this Distin∣ction,</HI> as a principal, if not the only Obstacle; that Physicians have been so much at a Loss, for the <HI>true Cause</HI> of the Disease, and have therefore so often taken the <HI>Symptom for the Disease itself;</HI> not rightly distinguishing the <HI>next,</HI> and <HI>immediate con∣junct Cause,</HI> from its <HI>Symptoms</HI> or <HI>Accidents;</HI> which
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>may not be occasion'd by the <HI>next,</HI> and <HI>always ac∣companying Cause</HI> of the Disease, but by <HI>some other Symptom;</HI> and what is so far from being the <HI>Mark of the Disease,</HI> that it is <HI>a Symptom of a Symptom</HI> only.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> for Example, when it does not proceed from a Caries; the <HI>genuine Essence</HI> of this Disease, is the violent <HI>Distension</HI> or <HI>Stretching</HI> of the <HI>Periostium,</HI> by some sort of Humour; by which means this <HI>Membrane,</HI> being forc'd out of its <HI>natural Form</HI> and <HI>Situation,</HI> excites a most <HI>ex∣quisite Pain;</HI> which <HI>Pain</HI> is not the <HI>Disease,</HI> but the <HI>true Mark</HI> of the Disease; and the <HI>Humour</HI> occasioning this Pain, the <HI>Cause</HI> of the <HI>Disease.</HI> The <HI>Inflammation, Fever, swelled Face,</HI> &amp;c. which may succeed, are neither of them the <HI>true Mark;</HI> but proceed from the <HI>Pain,</HI> which is the <HI>true Di∣agnostic Sign</HI> or <HI>Mark of the Disease;</HI> each of the above-mentioned being <HI>the Symptom of a Symptom</HI> only.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> DIAGNOSTICS <HI>or</HI> SIGNS <HI>of a</HI> Disease.</HEAD>
<P>THE true <HI>Marks</HI> or <HI>Signs</HI> of a Disease are such, which are <HI>present from the Beginning,</HI> and, as it were, <HI>born with the Disease;</HI> they <HI>grow up</HI> with the Distemper to it's height; <HI>abate</HI> also, and <HI>va∣nish with the Disease.</HI> These are the <HI>only sure Marks</HI> or <HI>Signs:</HI> other Signs or Symptoms, which do not <HI>immediately follow</HI> the Disease, nor any <HI>proper Ef∣fects</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>of it; and which do not <HI>always appear</HI> in the Disease, are therefore <HI>deceitful Signs,</HI> and not to be trusted to; tho' such as have, inadvertently, mis∣led some, even <HI>sagacious</HI> Men.</P>
<P>NOW, these <HI>deceitful Signs</HI> are not to be reckon∣ed among the <HI>proper Symptoms</HI> of the Disease; be∣ing <HI>only such</HI> as proceed from some <HI>proper Sym∣ptom</HI> of the Disease; and are, indeed, <HI>Symptoms of Symptoms</HI> only. For the <HI>true,</HI> and <HI>proper Diag∣nostic Marks</HI> or <HI>Signs</HI> of the Disease, must always <HI>begin, grow up, decline</HI> and <HI>vanish</HI> with the Disease itself; and, from such <HI>Marks only, we must ever draw our Indications of Cure.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> SYMPTOMS <HI>of a</HI> Disease.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of any Disease, the first Bu∣siness is to <HI>distinguish the Symptoms in general, from the Disease itself;</HI> and then to make <HI>a Distinction between the Symptoms themselves:</HI> That is, the <HI>Sym∣ptoms</HI> which <HI>arise</HI> and <HI>vanish</HI> with the Disease, are to be <HI>distinguish'd from those,</HI> which are <HI>bred, not from the Disease itself,</HI> but <HI>from the Symptoms</HI> of the Disease: And the <HI>Symptoms,</HI> as we before obser∣ved, which <HI>immediately accompany</HI> the Disease, and are <HI>born</HI> and <HI>die with it;</HI> are the only <HI>sure Marks</HI> or <HI>Signs</HI> of the Disease.</P>
<P>TO illustrate this by our former familiar Instance of the <HI>Tooth-ach:</HI> Here the <HI>Pain</HI> is the <HI>chief</HI> and <HI>most grievous Symptom,</HI> but is neither <HI>the Disease it∣self,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>nor <HI>the Cause</HI> of the Disease; nor, yet, is it a <HI>simple Symptom</HI> only, forasmuch as it is <HI>the Cause</HI> of <HI>other Symptoms,</HI> which succeed; as the <HI>Fever, In∣flammation, swelled Face,</HI> &amp;c. especially when the Pain is violent. Those <HI>several Accidents,</HI> now mentioned, are <HI>caused</HI> only by the <HI>raging Pain</HI> of the <HI>Tooth-ach</HI> (the <HI>true Mark</HI> of the Disease) and are <HI>Symptoms of a Symptom only.</HI> And farther, these <HI>Accidents</HI> of <HI>Fever, Inflammation, swelled Face,</HI> &amp;c. are neither <HI>in whole,</HI> nor <HI>in part,</HI> the <HI>Cause</HI> of the <HI>Tooth-ach;</HI> neither are they <HI>insepara∣ble</HI> Companions of the <HI>Tooth-ach;</HI> for the <HI>Tooth-ach</HI> may be, and often is, <HI>without them.</HI> And the <HI>swelled Face,</HI> in particular, does not <HI>begin,</HI> nor <HI>end</HI> with the Disease; nor does it <HI>always accompany</HI> it; nor is it of the <HI>same Nature</HI> with the <HI>Humour,</HI> oc∣casioning that violent Pain, but is <HI>a Symptom</HI> only of the <HI>Tooth-ach;</HI> being <HI>raised by the Pain,</HI> and <HI>bred by Consent of Parts</HI> from an Afflux of Hu∣mours.</P>
<P>THUS you see plainly <HI>the Method</HI> of <HI>investiga∣ting the Nature</HI> and <HI>Causes of a Disease;</HI> it's <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Part affected;</HI> it's <HI>Diagnostic Symptoms;</HI> and the <HI>Necessity of distinguishing these latter,</HI> not only <HI>from the Disease itself,</HI> but also <HI>from one another:</HI> All which will make way to judge the better of <HI>a fit Remedy</HI> to cure the Disease; for we <HI>cannot rea∣sonably hope for a Cure, before the Disease be tho∣roughly understood.</HI> And in <HI>this manner</HI> we must come at the <HI>Nature, Cause,</HI> and <HI>Cure of all Dis∣eases whatever.</HI> — And, indeed, Diseases have that <HI>surprizing Analogy</HI> to one another, that we
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>cannot find the <HI>Nature of any one Disease;</HI> but the Nature of <HI>several other</HI> will, by the same means, become manifest to us. So that <HI>a general Know∣ledge</HI> arises from <HI>a particular Inquiry;</HI> and we are instructed from the Discovery of <HI>any one,</HI> into the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>many other Diseases,</HI> and the <HI>most perfect Practice</HI> in Curing them.</P>
<P>FROM this <HI>Method</HI> also of finding out the Di∣stemper, is discovered, at the same time, the only Way of making a <HI>right</HI> and <HI>true Prognostic;</HI> which is only a <HI>Declaration</HI> of a Physician's <HI>Expectation in curing a sick Person.</HI> And <HI>this Expectation</HI> can no otherwise be <HI>truly framed,</HI> than from <HI>the Na∣ture</HI> of the Disease; the <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Intenseness</HI> of it; the <HI>natural Strength</HI> of the Sick; and the <HI>Power of Medicines</HI> conjunctly. The Knowledge therefore of <HI>Prognostics</HI> is not otherwise to be acqui∣red, than by <HI>rightly investigating the Diagnostic Marks of a Disease,</HI> whereby it's <HI>Nature</HI> is disco∣vered; with <HI>that</HI> the <HI>Quantity</HI> of the Disease, and the <HI>Strength</HI> of the Sick, at the same time. And as by <HI>this Method,</HI> we are also led into <HI>the Nature,</HI> and <HI>Power of Medicines themselves;</HI> so here again, the <HI>very Medicine reflects Light,</HI> and, in some measure, <HI>confirms the Knowledge of the Disease;</HI> as HIPPO∣CRATES well observes: <HI>The Medicine declares the Disease.</HI></P>
<P>THIS then is the <HI>Method,</HI> by which the <HI>Nature of all Diseases,</HI> to which human Bodies are, or may be liable, <HI>is discovered.</HI> And should ever any <HI>alto∣gether new,</HI> and <HI>unheard of Disease,</HI> at any time,
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>appear amongst us; <HI>this</HI> will be found the <HI>sure way of coming at it's Nature:</HI> by only <HI>thus carefully re∣collecting,</HI> and <HI>examining its Symptoms.</HI> Again, this will of Consequence direct to the <HI>most proper Method of Curing;</HI> the Knowledge of a Disease be∣ing the first Step towards its Cure.</P>
<P><Q>"ALL <HI>the Difficulty of Philosophy,"</HI></Q> says the great Sir ISAAC NEWTON, <Q><HI>"seems to consist in this: From the Phaenomena of Motions to investi∣gate the Forces of Nature; and then, from these Forces, to demonstrate the other Phaenomena."</HI></Q></P>
<P>AGREEABLE to which, we observe: That <HI>the Symptoms of any Disease being given, it's Nature may readily be discovered.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the Method of <HI>curing Diseases,</HI> by draw∣ing <HI>Indications</HI> from the <HI>evident</HI> and <HI>conjunct Cau∣ses,</HI> has been most approved of by the best and Generality of Physicians. To this purpose CEL∣SUS: <HI>Rationalem quidem puto Medicinam esse de∣bere: instrui vero ab</HI> evidentibus <HI>Causis; obscuris omnibus, non à Cogitatione Artificis, sed ab ipsa Ar∣te rejectis.</HI> As to <HI>the Knowledge of these Causes,</HI> it is allowed, they can only be attained by <HI>a close</HI> and <HI>assiduous Observation of all the Appearances in the se∣veral Stages of the Distemper:</HI> Whoever therefore is Master of <HI>an exact Knowledge</HI> in the <HI>Histories</HI> of Diseases, having also due Regard to the <HI>Diag∣nostics,</HI> as by <HI>our Method</HI> directed; may readily <HI>investigate their Nature. Natural Philosophy</HI> and the <HI>History of Diseases,</HI> as we observed before, must
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>ever go hand in hand in improving the Art of Healing; it not being possible to make any great Use of the <HI>latter,</HI> without some Degree of Know∣ledge in the <HI>former:</HI> and the <HI>greater our Knowledge</HI> is in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> the <HI>better the Nature</HI> of Diseases will be known.</P>
<P>I HAVE always found, the keeping close to <HI>this Method</HI> of investigating the Nature of Diseases, of <HI>the greatest Use</HI> to me in the Course of <HI>my Pra∣ctice.</HI> For having long since drawn up <HI>our Method</HI> from the most approved Authors in Physic, Anci∣ent and Modern; I have constantly apply'd it, not only to <HI>all those Histories of Diseases,</HI> which I read in <HI>Authors,</HI> whose <HI>Descriptions</HI> of <HI>evident Causes, Signs,</HI> and <HI>Symptoms</HI> are just; where the <HI>several Species</HI> of the <HI>same Disease</HI> are <HI>judiciously distinguish∣ed;</HI> but also to <HI>all those Diseases,</HI> together with their <HI>several Appearances,</HI> I have at any time met with among <HI>my Patients.</HI> And I am verily persuaded, that you, Gentlemen, will likewise reap the <HI>same Advantage,</HI> by the <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>Application</HI> of <HI>our Method,</HI> if duly attended, in your <HI>future Practice;</HI> as well to the <HI>great Relief of your Patients,</HI> as the <HI>abundant Satisfaction of your own Minds.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, in order the more strongly to inculcate on your Minds <HI>this most necessary</HI> and <HI>useful Method of investigating,</HI> we will here again give it you in <HI>a closer Manner,</HI> and in a somewhat <HI>different Light;</HI> setting out with an Observation of LOMMIUS: Noscere Morbum proximus <HI>est ad Sanitatem</HI> Gra∣dus: <HI>Nemo sane hanc aut praesagire, aut reddere
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>affectis rectè potest, qui non animadvertere</HI> Genus Aegritudinis, <HI>quod sit; non ejus Eventum omnem praenunciare,</HI> certis Indiciis <HI>norit.</HI></P>
<P>WE said before, that the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of any Dis∣ease being given, it's <HI>Nature</HI> may be discovered.</P>
<P>NOW, the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of every Disease are no other than the <HI>Effects</HI> of some <HI>Cause,</HI> or some Number of <HI>Causes,</HI> which <HI>pervert</HI> and <HI>overturn</HI> the <HI>natural Actions</HI> of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>more Parts;</HI> for which reason by <HI>explaining these Symptoms,</HI> we become <HI>apprised of the perverted Action,</HI> or <HI>discover the Dis∣ease:</HI> for nothing can be <HI>the Cause</HI> of a Disease, that does not produce <HI>the Symptoms,</HI> in which the <HI>Nature of the Disease</HI> consists.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of any Disease be∣ing given, it's <HI>Nature</HI> may thence be discovered: And <HI>the Nature</HI> of a Disease being assigned, we have also <HI>the Methods</HI> of curing it. Farther, having the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Causes</HI> of any Disease, we shall be able to determine <HI>how far</HI> the Disease is <HI>curable</HI> or <HI>incurable;</HI> the <HI>Probabilities</HI> of curing any Distem∣per; and the <HI>most proper Methods</HI> of attempting it.</P>
<P>NOW the Ancients, as we have already obser∣ved, having accurately describ'd the <HI>Diagnostic Signs</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> of Diseases, together with their most <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>simple Appearances;</HI> whoever is thoroughly acquainted with the <HI>Histories,</HI> as deli∣vered down to us by <HI>them,</HI> and is <HI>accurate,</HI> or <HI>well
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>versed</HI> in the <HI>Structure</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>the Fluids</HI> and <HI>Solids</HI> of the Human Body; may, from <HI>their Diagnostic Signs, in particular,</HI> be able to discover the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Seat</HI> of the Disease, and the <HI>Way</HI> it is produced. By the same means also, he will have it in his Power to shew in <HI>what manner,</HI> the <HI>Symptoms</HI> attending the Disease do <HI>flow</HI> from it's <HI>Nature,</HI> thus found out from it's <HI>Symptoms;</HI> and likewise be capable of perceiving how those <HI>Sym∣ptoms</HI> give way, or are cured, by <HI>changing the di∣stempered Condition</HI> of the <HI>Parts affected.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Examination of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Dis∣ease from it's <HI>Symptoms,</HI> we must be most careful, that every <HI>casual</HI> and <HI>foreign Symptom</HI> be separated from the <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>permanent,</HI> in the manner the <HI>Method,</HI> more at large, directs; it being easy by observing the <HI>Rule</HI> there laid down, to distin∣guish the <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>inseparable Symptoms</HI> from those, which are <HI>merely casual</HI> and <HI>secondary.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>principal Symptoms</HI> are, for the most part, casy to be explained; the <HI>false Symptoms</HI> are most commonly found among the <HI>secondary</HI> Sort, and are the <HI>Symptoms of Symptoms</HI> only; for which rea∣son they ought to be <HI>rejected from the Number of Symptoms properly belonging to the Disease.</HI></P>
<P>INDICATIONS of Cure must be drawn from the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Disease, and not from their <HI>pre∣carious</HI> and <HI>supposed Causes;</HI> nor from their <HI>adven∣titious</HI> and <HI>casual Symptoms:</HI> And there must run an <HI>uninterrupted Chain,</HI> from the <HI>Diagnostic Signs</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>of the Disease, through it's <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Causes,</HI> 'till it ends in a <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>evident Method of Cure.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we see that, in order <HI>to cure any Disease,</HI> the most <HI>natural, easy,</HI> and <HI>practical Way,</HI> is first, to <HI>collect the most constant Symptoms</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of the Disease. But in doing this, we must always remember; that <HI>our utmost Diligence</HI> will be abso∣lutely necessary, <HI>rightly to distinguish the Symptoms:</HI> That in our collecting <HI>the genuine Diagnostic Signs</HI> of any Disease, we never suffer <HI>the secondary Signs,</HI> or <HI>Symptoms of Symptoms,</HI> to creep into the Num∣ber of <HI>the genuine Diagnostic Signs.</HI> For, if we do, we shall certainly render our Inquiries into <HI>the true Nature</HI> of the Disease, almost <HI>fruitless</HI> and <HI>impra∣cticable.</HI> But, by <HI>strictly</HI> observing <HI>this Caution,</HI> we shall readily discover <HI>the Disease,</HI> and it's <HI>Sym∣ptoms;</HI> together with <HI>the Causes</HI> of <HI>Both.</HI> And if we can come at <HI>the Nature</HI> of the Disease, we are about to Cure; there remains <HI>no Difficulty</HI> as to the <HI>Way of curing,</HI> be the <HI>Appearances</HI> of the <HI>Symptoms</HI> ever so <HI>various</HI> or <HI>complicated.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>direct Method</HI> of Cure being thus <HI>obvious,</HI> the <HI>Probabilities</HI> of <HI>Success</HI> must be, as the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Distemper we come to Cure, and the <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Efficacy of the Medicines</HI> we administer, <HI>respe∣ctively:</HI> And if we already know, or can discover by Practice, <HI>the peculiar Ways,</HI> in which <HI>the Me∣dicines,</HI> we make use of, <HI>will act;</HI> we shall be thereby instructed, when <HI>one Method,</HI> or <HI>any one
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>Medicine,</HI> is most <HI>properly</HI> administered; and <HI>why</HI> it must be <HI>continued,</HI> or <HI>laid aside:</HI> which is the <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Substance</HI> of Physic.</P>
<P>THE MATERIALS, which compose <HI>the Me∣thod of Investigating,</HI> and <HI>finding out the Nature of Diseases,</HI> having been only <HI>dispersed</HI> in several Parts of the Works of HIPPOCRATES, CELSUS, and other most approved Authors in Physic, both ancient and modern; and having never yet, as I know of, been <HI>thoroughly collected</HI> and <HI>digested</HI> into a regular Form: As it may, to this Day, be justly supposed <HI>one great Reason,</HI> why <HI>those excellent Hints</HI> and <HI>Admonitions</HI> have not, <HI>always,</HI> been so <HI>duly re∣garded</HI> and <HI>attended to,</HI> as they <HI>certainly deserve;</HI> so was it, long ago, an <HI>Incentive</HI> to me to throw them together, with some Care and Pains, in <HI>the Method,</HI> in which I have now delivered them. And I have, for many Years, with much <HI>Satis∣faction</HI> and <HI>Success,</HI> experienced the <HI>great Benefit</HI> and <HI>Usefulness</HI> of so good a Monitor in <HI>my own Pra∣ctice;</HI> and I flatter myself, it may become <HI>equally serviceable to others</HI> of my Profession, if <HI>rightly</HI> made use of: It being the <HI>whole Business</HI> of the Phy∣sician to <HI>find out the Distemper,</HI> and from <HI>that</HI> to draw <HI>the Method of Cure;</HI> and to know <HI>the Power</HI> and <HI>Efficacy of his Medicines,</HI> together with <HI>the true</HI> and <HI>exact Manner</HI> of <HI>Timeing</HI> and <HI>Dosing them,</HI> in each <HI>particular</HI> Disease, and its <HI>Variations.</HI></P>
<P>THIS METHOD, therefore, of <HI>investigating the Nature of all Diseases,</HI> being the <HI>most natural, most rational,</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> Way of attaining that
<PB N="27" REF="36"/><HI>compleat Knowledge;</HI> I think, it may not improper∣ly be esteemed the very <HI>Master-Key</HI> to the Know∣ledge of <HI>the Practice</HI> of Physic: And I imagine, if <HI>thoroughly understood,</HI> and then <HI>properly apply'd,</HI> it will most safely conduct us, from the very <HI>Threshold</HI> of Physic even to its <HI>Consummation;</HI> and that, with much <HI>greater Expedition</HI> and <HI>Success,</HI> than <HI>any other,</HI> hitherto known, <HI>Method.</HI> And, as it will be of very great Service to <HI>the Beginner;</HI> so likewise, will it continue to be the <HI>most useful</HI> and <HI>necessary Companion,</HI> we can associate withal, through <HI>the whole Course of our Practice.</HI> Where∣fore, that I might make this Method <HI>familiar</HI> to you, I have <HI>gradually opened</HI> it in the Beginning of this Lecture, and have through the whole <HI>variously represented</HI> it: More particularly, I have given it you in <HI>two different Views;</HI> that I might the more <HI>strongly inculcate,</HI> and <HI>impress it on your Minds.</HI> And, that nothing may be wanting to it's <HI>compleat Use;</HI> I shall endeavour, in my <HI>subsequent Lectures,</HI> not only to make it <HI>still more familiar,</HI> but also as <HI>serviceable</HI> as possibly may be, both to <HI>yourselves</HI> and <HI>Patients;</HI> by illustrating it with <HI>frequent Ex∣amples,</HI> and the <HI>constant Application</HI> of it to the <HI>se∣veral Disorders,</HI> we shall hereafter be obliged to treat of. By this means, Gentlemen, I hope, you will be altogether Masters of the <HI>right Use of our Method of Investigation,</HI> and <HI>the Application</HI> of it in <HI>all the Diseases,</HI> and the <HI>Varieties</HI> of them, you may either meet with <HI>in Authors,</HI> or observe in <HI>your own future Practice.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
<P>FOR the rest: I shall take care to direct you, how to judge of <HI>the Efficacy</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> of Medi∣cines, with their <HI>peculiar Way of acting:</HI> How to administer <HI>each</HI> Medicine in <HI>the most proper Dose,</HI> and <HI>most proper Time</HI> of the Disease: <HI>When</HI> it may be necessary <HI>to alter, entirely change,</HI> or <HI>continue the Methods</HI> and <HI>Medicines: When,</HI> and <HI>how, pro∣perly to Bleed,</HI> and <HI>apply Blisters,</HI> in the several <HI>Stages</HI> and <HI>Complications</HI> of a Distemper. I shall, besides, furnish you with a select <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and <HI>Methodus Praescribendi,</HI> suitable to each Dis∣ease. This <HI>introductory</HI> Knowledge, joined to <HI>your own necessary Diligence</HI> and <HI>constant Attention;</HI> will, I apprehend, most effectually qualify you, to <HI>pra∣ctise with Success,</HI> in every Disorder, we shall have occasion to lay before you in <HI>this Part</HI> of our Course.</P>
