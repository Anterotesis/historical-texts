<P>AN ACCOUNT OF A NEW METHOD OF TREATING FRACTURED LEGS.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the following Treatment of Fractured Legs (from the Ex∣perience I have had of its Suc∣cess during a Practice of several Years) ap∣pears to me preferable to any I have hi∣therto known; and as it may be a Means of lessening many of the Inconveniences attending such Accidents, I take the Liber∣ty of sending it for your Opinion; and, if you think it of Consequence enough to be made public, shall be glad to have it laid before the ROYAL SOCIETY.</P>
<P>The Instrument here recommended was first applied, with great Success, in an ob∣lique Fracture of the TIBIA, (which could not be kept in a proper Situation by the usual Methods), and afterwards, as happily, in a
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Dislocation of the lower Extremity of the same Bone, accompanied with a Fracture of the FIBULA. In this latter Case it is often difficult to reduce the Dislocation, even with a strong Extension, and more so to retain the Bones in their proper Situation, whilst the Limb is laid in the usual extend∣ed Posture.</P>
<P>But both these Difficulties are absolutely avoided by the Means I am about to de∣scribe.</P>
<P>The remarkable good Effects, in the Cases abovementioned, induced me to try the same in different Fractures of the Leg, as well compound as simple, in all which I have found it to answer my Expectation. I have formerly explained this Method of treating Fractures to many Gentlemen of the Profession, as well as to yourself, and have also had several Cases where other Surgeons have been cencerned with me, who have in general expressed great Satis∣faction,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>(and some of them have introdu∣ced it into their own Practice), so that I have Reason to believe it would have be∣come more general, if the Instruments, that have hitherto been sold for that Pur∣pose, had been made according to the ori∣ginal Pattern; but the Workman, whom I employed, has made and sold many that differ from mine in some essential Points. I have therefore thought it necessary to send you, inclosed, a Description of the Instru∣ment, made after such a Manner, as I have found by Experience to succeed best.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION <HI>of a</HI> NEW-CONSTRUCT∣ED INSTRUMENT <HI>for</HI> FRACTURED LEGS, <HI>recommended to be used instead of the common Apparatus. See the Plate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Figures are drawn on a Scale of three Inches to a Foot, and repre∣sent two Splints of strong Pasteboard made with Glue, to be fastened upon a fractured Leg, by three Straps which surround the whole.</P>
<P>These are adapted to the Leg of a mid∣dle-sized Man: nevertheless it may be convenient to have two other Sizes; the one almost twenty-two Inches in Length, and the other sixteen.</P>
<P>Fig. I. A represents an under Splint of an irregular Form, suitable to that Part of the Leg it is intended to cover; it is a little con∣vex externally and concave internally. The Length eighteen Inches from (a) to (b).
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>The Width two Inches and three Quarters at the Strap near the Knee; and two Inches and a Quarter at both the other Straps.</P>
<P>B,B,B, three Leather Straps from fifteen to twenty Inches long and one wide, having two Rows of Holes so placed, that every Hole in each Row may be opposite to a Space in the other. These must be sewed fast to the Middle and Outside of the under Splint. The Portions of Straps (ddd) on the anterior Part of the Splint must be shorter than those on the posterior (eee) which are to surround the more muscular Part of the Leg.</P>
<P>C, a Part to support the Foot from the Point (a) to the Heel (c), five Inches long at an Angle of sixty Degrees.</P>
<P>D, the Foot-strap, twelve Inches long, sewed to the Bottom of the under Splint, within two Inches of the Point, to pass un∣der the Heel and through the Leather Loop on the upper Splint, to the lowest Pin.</P>
<P>E, an irregular oval Hole two Inches long and almost one wide in the lowest
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>Part, but decreasing upwards to receive the Malleolus externus, or lower Extremity of the Fibula.</P>
<P>Fig. II. represents the Leg raised up, to shew the Situation of the under Splint when properly applied.</P>
<P>Fig. III. represents a fractured Leg when laid within the Splints, according to the Method I am about to recommend, having the Stocking-Foot (or Sock) and Shoe upon it. The darkest Shade in this and Fig. II. being intended to shew that Part of the Splints within the Shoe.</P>
<P>Fig. IV. A, the upper Splint. B,B,B, the Pins. C, the Leather Loop to receive the Foot-Strap.</P>
<P>Fig. V. A many-tailed Bandage, made of Slips of Russia Linen, regularly increas∣ing in Length, from twelve or fourteen, to eighteen or twenty Inches, according to
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>the Size of the Leg. Each of these Slips (being two Inches broad) is so laid as to cover Half the Breadth of that which is underneath it (<HI>viz.</HI> one Inch.) Another Slip, ten or twelve Inches long, is sewed on the Back, so as to unite them all in the Middle, making a Bandage equally as firm as a circular one, and which may be used without disturbing the Leg. The nar∣rowest Part must be placed nearest to the Heel. As the Number of Slips is to be increased or lessened, according to the Space necessary to be inclosed within them, I call this a many-tailed Bandage, leaving the precise Number to be determined accord∣ing to the Nature of the Circumstances.</P>
<P>This has been used many Years in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, instead of the old eighteen-headed Bandage: Neverthe∣less, as it is not generally known, I hope this Description will not be thought super∣fluous.</P>
<P>The three different Sizes of Splints above-mentioned will generally be sufficient;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>at least one or other of them may serve any Leg of an Adult till others can be provided.</P>
<P>The Legs of Children, as they are more round and less muscular, may be defended, nearly in the same Manner, with the com∣mon wooden Splints, properly bolstered, that are now made Use of in St. Bartholo∣mew's Hospital, provided they are long enough to secure both Articulations of the fractured Bones.</P>
<P>When a Surgeon is called to a fractured Leg, at the Place where the Accident hap∣pened, let him lay the Patient on the in∣jured Side, on a flat Surface, and raise the Knee of the fractured Limb towards the Abdomen, bending at the same Time the Knee-Joint, so as to put the Extensor-Muscles of the Foot (which are the strong∣est) into a State of Relaxation. He will then be enabled to replace the Ends of the fractured Bones, and restore them to their proper Situation, without the customary strong Extension of the Limb, which is troublesome to the Surgeon, painful to the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>Patient, and apt to bring on Tension, Spasms, and Inflammation of the stretched Muscles.</P>
<P>When the Ends of the fractured Bone are replaced, (which may often be done even without removing the Shoe or Stock∣ing,) let an under Splint, of the most suit∣able Size, be applied to the Fibula, (or outside of the Leg,) and, if it does not fit exactly, let it be made to do so, by adding such Compresses of Tow, or thick Flannel,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Or comb'd Wool.</NOTE> as may be necessary for that Purpose.</P>
<P>This Posture is much more comfortable and convenient, (rendering it less trouble∣some for the Patient to ease himself or be moved by others,) and removes the Foot and Toes out of the Way of being hurt by the Weight of the Bed-Cloathes, so as to make a Fracture-Box or Cradle unnecessary.</P>
<P>If the Fracture be compound, the Wound generally heals by the first Inten∣tion, the great Impediment, (Irritation,) being prevented; of which I can produce many Instances. Add to this, that the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>Leg may be taken up with the whole Ap∣paratus, and the Knee-Joint gently moved as often as necessary, to prevent that Stiff∣ness which always succeeds a Case of this Kind, and is attended with much Pain and Inconvenience, a long Time after the Leg is otherwise well. The Patient may also be taken out of Bed frequently, without Pain or Danger, if not very heavy or unweildy.</P>
<P>The under Splint makes a safe and secure Bed for the Leg whilst the upper Part is dressing, (if a compound Fracture,) and the Leg may, by a steady Hand, be sup∣ported also against the upper Splint, and put into any Posture that may be necessary to dress a Sore on the Fibula, or under Part.</P>
<P>I do not always remove the Shoe and Stocking-Foot; as well because they serve to keep the Part in Perspiration, as that the Shoe adds Steadiness to the Limb, by the Connection it may have with the inferior Part of the Instrument.</P>
<P>Let also the upper Splint be applied on the Inside of the Leg, so as almost to cover
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>the Tibia, on its whole Length. The Straps may then be fastened sufficiently tight to secure the Whole. This done, the Patient may easily be removed in a Sedan Chair, (having the Cushion so raised that the Leg may hang down without resting upon the Bottom,) or in a Coach, with the Limb supported by the Hand of a Surgeon, so that it may yield to every Motion uniformly, or all together, as it were, whilst it swings in his Hand; for it matters not how great the Motion of the Body be, provided the Points of the fractured Bone are secured from being moved, the one against the other.</P>
<P>In this Manner I have carried many Pa∣tients, from the Place of the Accident, over the London Pavements, to their own Homes, at a great Distance, without their having suffered any Inconvenience from the Motion, even when the Fractures were compound.</P>
<P>When the Patient is brought home and put to Bed, (the Bed having a Mattrass
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>upon it,) let the Stocking be removed, and the proper Remedies, with the many∣tailed Bandage and the above Splints, ap∣plied, observing the same Directions, as to Posture, which I have already given; <HI>viz.</HI> that the Patient be laid on his Side, with the broken Leg undermost, the Knee bent, and the Thigh drawn up, instead of laying him on his Back, with the injured Limb extended.</P>
<P>Both the Splints are, designedly, made narrow, to leave Room for Examination of the Parts affected, lest any undue Pressure should occasion Pain; but if it should be objected that they are not sufficiently broad for a thick Leg, that Inconvenience may be remedied by putting a Slip of Pasteboard, or thin Wood, between them, on the fore Part of the Leg, if thought necessary. The Straps of the Instrument are sufficient to se∣cure the Whole.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Some Persons have proposed, by Way of Improve∣ment, to have a Rivet or Pin, like that upon the Tibial or upper Splint, fixed upon an Iron Plate near one End of the middle Strap, instead of having the Strap fixed to the fibular or under Splint, in Order that it may be ap∣plied, as the Cale may require it; but I nevertheless think it necessary to be fixed as described in the Plate, to prevent the Splints from approaching or receding from each other, if either of the other Straps become too loose: though I approve very much of an additional Strap to be applied wheresoever such Compression may be necessary.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<P>I made, with my own Hand, the first of these Instruments, of strong Pasteboard, with Iron Plates rivetted upon them, which succeeded very well. I have tried also va∣rious Materials for the same Purpose, such as strong<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">About the Year 1748, Mr. <HI>Holmes,</HI> Instrument-Ma∣ker to <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI>'s Hospital, made, by my Direc∣tion, some Splints of this Shape of strong Hide Leather hardened with Glew: But the extraordinary Expence, as well as the Difficulty of being supplied with a sufficient Quantity of them, induced me to continue the Splints of Pasteboard made with Glew, in my constant Practice, which by long Experience I have found to answer the Purpose effectually.</NOTE> Hide Leather, hardened with Glew; also Wood, and Plate Copper; any one of which will answer sufficiently, if well formed: nevertheless I shall prefer the Pasteboard, if made strong enough, till I can meet with a Workman that will make them accurately of harder Materials.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<P>The same Posture that is recommended for broken Legs, I have found equally ser∣viceable with Respect to broken Thighs, and for the same Reason. In which Case the common wooden Splint is as good as any other, provided it be long enough to secure both Extremities of the fractured Bone.</P>
<P>I have, through the Whole of this De∣scription, made Use of the Terms <HI>upper</HI> and <HI>under Splints,</HI> for the Sake of being more easily understood; though perhaps the calling the one <HI>Tibiale,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or Tibial Splint.</NOTE> and the other <HI>Fibularium,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fibular Splint.</NOTE> would serve to distinguish them better, and give a more precise Idea of the Manner of their Application; the first being placed so as to cover a great Part of the <HI>Tibia,</HI> and the second forming a safe Bed for the <HI>Fibula.</HI></P>
