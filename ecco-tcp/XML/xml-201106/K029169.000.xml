<HEAD><HI>Reasons, why the</HI> Apothecary <HI>may be supposed to understand the Administration of Medi∣cines in the Cure of Diseases, as well as the</HI> Physician.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have at length found the most effectual means to prevail with me, to break thro' the resolution I had taken, of having no share in the present Controversie between the <HI>Physicians</HI> and the <HI>Apothecarys,</HI> by imputing my Silence to the bad∣ness of my Cause: In the Vindi∣cation of which, you are pleas'd
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>to say, no Sober or Ingenious Per∣son will offer to draw his Pen.</P>
<P>I must confess, I have hitherto been of the Opinion of the Major part of our Profession; that what has yet appear'd in publick against us, has not deserv'd a serious An∣swer, most of it being taken up on Prejudice, the rest a Scandalous Aspersion, invented by a peevish Set of Men, who were angry that any body thriv'd beside them∣selves.</P>
<P>Thus then have you unwilling∣ly forced me into a spacious Field, where on each side I may extend and dilate my self; and which way soever I turn, may find at least <HI>quantum sufficit</HI> of Matter to Work upon.</P>
<P>But since you keep a more than ordinary pother with the high Ad∣vantages which the <HI>Physicians</HI> have
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>over us, I shall chuse to examine the truth of that Assertion, and en∣deavour to set those High Advan∣tages, (as you call 'em) in a true light; and then leave the Impar∣tial World to Judge, whether all be Gospel which proceeds from the Pen of a Dispensary <HI>Physician.</HI></P>
<P>And first it is pretended, That the <HI>Phsician,</HI> by his liberal Educa∣tion, (that is, by being bred at an <HI>Academy</HI>) has greater and more frequent opportunities of being instructed in the Practice of <HI>Phy∣sick,</HI> than the <HI>Apothecary</HI> can have; and that not only from his own private Reading and Observation, the Care and Direction of his Tutor, but also from the publick Lectures of the Physick Professor.</P>
<P>Now if it be expected that this Argument should have any force against us, it must first be prov'd
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>what extraordinary Benefits those are which Young Students receive from Tutors and Physick Pro∣fessors; and not think that we shall barely assent to them, or be∣lieve them to be such mighty things upon their single Affirma∣tion. I fear when these wonder∣ful Lectures come to be examin'd, they will appear little better than Barren Animadversions on <HI>Galen, Hippocrates,</HI> or some other of the old Physical Authours; which e∣very Man is capable of doing, who is able to read and understand them. And I believe we may ven∣ture to add, that the Auditors of these Lectures generally return with the same degree of Know∣ledge and Satisfaction, as a late Assembly did from a Lecture at <HI>Exeter-Exchange,</HI> against the <HI>Cir∣culation of the Blood.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<P>It is again Objected against us, That the Opportunities of being Advanc'd in the Knowledge of <HI>Anatomy</HI> and <HI>Chymistry,</HI> so essential to the Qualification of a Person who is to Administer Physick, are greater in the <HI>Academy</HI> than in any other place; and from whence the <HI>Apothecary</HI> is totally excluded.</P>
<P>It must be allow'd, that the un∣derstanding the wonderful Con∣trivance and Texture of so admi∣rable a Machine, as is that of the <HI>Humane Body,</HI> is no ordinary part of Science, and what undoubted∣ly the Person who Administers Physick ought to be acquainted withal. From which notwith∣standing, I cannot see how the <HI>Apothecary</HI> is totally excluded, since there are constant Anatomical Dis∣sections at the <HI>Surgeon</HI>'s <HI>Hall,</HI> which is open to <HI>Apothecarys</HI> as well as
<PB N="8" REF="7"/><HI>Physicians;</HI> and where I presume there is more to be seen in one Year, than the Young <HI>Physician</HI> meets withal in six at his <HI>Acade∣my.</HI></P>
<P>The pretended Advantages they have over us in <HI>Chymistry,</HI> are of a-piece with those before men∣tion'd: For not to Instance our own private <HI>Elaboratorys,</HI> the pub∣lick <HI>Elaboratory</HI> at the <HI>Hall,</HI> where all Chymical Preparations are made in the highest Perfection, is a sufficient Confutation of that groundless Assertion.</P>
<P>These, <HI>Sir,</HI> Being the principal Reasons on which You build your <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> namely, the Ad∣vantages which the <HI>Physician</HI> has over the <HI>Apothecary,</HI> I shall not content my self with this general Reflection on them, but shall pro∣ceed to examine them more closely,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>and particularly that of Study∣ing at the <HI>Ʋniversity,</HI> by which is meant a liberal Education, as if the Streams of Polite Literature and Knowledge were not alike diffus'd throughout the <HI>Globe,</HI> but were scantily confin'd to the Banks of <HI>Cham</HI> or <HI>Isis.</HI></P>
<P>We will suppose then, An <HI>Apo∣thecary,</HI> who is Master of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Tongues, (as there are few of them but are) to be as duly Qualified for the Read∣ing, Comparing and Animadver∣ting on <HI>Physical</HI> Authours, as the <HI>Academic Physician,</HI> which I think no sober Intelligent Person will de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, if he allows that the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues as Taught at <HI>Westminster, Pauls,</HI> &amp;c. to be as fit for that purpose, as what the Young <HI>Physician</HI> generally carries with him to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<P>Neither will it be disputed with me, I think, that Reading, Reffe∣ction, Observation and Experi∣ment, are the only known means of acquiring Humane Learning and Science: To all which, the <HI>A∣pothecary</HI> thus Qualified, has as fair pretences as the most Elevated <HI>Physician</HI> of 'em all; and where∣in the <HI>Apothecary</HI> may as reasona∣bly be thought to make as great a Proficience, provided he uses the same Industry and Application.</P>
<P>It may be objected, That altho' the <HI>Apothecary</HI> be thus Qualified, yet whilst he is an Apprentice he has little or no time for these Stu∣dys, if he had never so great an Inclination; that what with the Duty to his Master, and the com∣mon Necessities and Expence of Life, which ask some time to be repair'd in spight of us, there will
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>be little or none left for any thing else.</P>
<P>To this I Answer, That altho' for the first Year or two there may be little else done, yet by that time he begins to have a true Tast of the Matter, and his Reason shines forth with brighter Rays: If he be a Youth of any Spirit and E∣mulation, he will and do's find a thousand opportunities of advan∣cing his Knowledge, equal, if not superiour to the <HI>Academic Physi∣cian.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Apothecary</HI> then thus Qua∣lified, may very reasonably be thought to understand the Study of Physick, the Natures of Dis∣eases and their Cures, equally with the <HI>Physician,</HI> tho' he cannot boast the High Advantages of a liberal Education and <HI>Accademic</HI> Accom∣plishments.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<P>Whilst the <HI>Physician</HI> contends with us after this manner, we shall never recede from these Principles: But if he shall say, That the Advan∣tages of an <HI>Academic</HI> Education are a better Foundation for him to Set up for a Wit, a Poet, or En∣tertaining Company; then indeed we submit, frankly acknowledg∣ing that we industriously shun those <HI>Arts,</HI> which rather tend to the Subversion and Destruction of the Animal Life, than its Preser∣vation and Emolument.</P>
<P>If then the equal Learning of the <HI>Apothecary</HI> sets him upon a le∣vel with the <HI>Physician,</HI> notwith∣standing his boasted Advantages over him, it can never be imagin'd that the Composition and Admi∣nistration of Medicines by which he discovers their Nature and O∣perations, will be any hindrance
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>to him in the persecution of those Studies which naturally lead him to any inquiry into the Structure and Oeconomy of the Humane¦dy, and the manner how these <HI>Me∣dicines</HI> he prepares Operate upon it.</P>
<P>This certainly without Vanity we may affirm, That we under∣stand the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> as well, not to say better than most Dispen∣sary <HI>Physicians.</HI></P>
<P>The World is very sensible what Advantages they owe to these Mo∣dern Reformers of Physick; to whose wonderful penetration we have not yet heard that Physick has been Obliged for one Addition or Discovery: But that is not their business, 'tis sufficient for them if they can libel the Town in their awkard Exclamations against the <HI>Apothecarys,</HI> by which they vainly imagin'd to have Ingross'd the
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>whole Art of Compounding and Vending Medicines to the Publick. But alas! fond deluded Men, This knowing Age was not to be led Hoodwink'd to their Ruin. The Town saw through the thin Dis∣guise, and laugh at the senseless Contrivance: They knew the A∣bilitys of those Persons who un∣dertook the Project, and that most of 'em so far from being able to Compound Medicines as they ought to be, scarce knew the Di∣stinction between <HI>Mint</HI> and <HI>Cardus.</HI> It may be thought perhaps, that here I have a little Transgress'd, and gone beyond the limits of Truth, for that so small a degree of Knowledge is sufficient for that purpose, that it is next to impossi∣ble that even a Dispensary <HI>Physi∣cian</HI> should be without it. What∣ever may be thought of it, I have
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>undeniable Proofs of this Asserti∣on to produce, when ever pro∣vok'd to it.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, That however An∣gry the Dispensary <HI>Physicians</HI> may be with us at present, they had once a better Opinion of our A∣bilitys and Understanding; I mean, when they Compos'd that most Elaborate Piece, the <HI>London Dispensatory;</HI> where 'tis evident they did not understand what they were about, by the unaccountable Jumble of Alteratives and Ca∣thartics in the same Composition: Nay, nor even the making the Composition it self; else, What is the meaning that we so often meet with <HI>Ʋt Artis Est, Secundum Artum,</HI> and the like? By which at least they tacitely confess that we are the more knowing of the Two.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<P>Since so much has been said of the Dispensary <HI>Physicians,</HI> it may not be unseasonable to speak a Word of their <HI>Mighty Captain,</HI> and to desire the Impartial Reader to Examine that Famous Book, which has made so much Noise in the World; wherein the Igno∣rance of its Writer is so very Conspicuous, that we need hardly point at his Mistakes.</P>
<P>His Catalogue of <HI>Drugs</HI> and Simples, (notwithstanding the whole Conspiracy labour'd for its Birth) is a handsom Specimen of his Knowledge in the <HI>Materia Me∣dica;</HI> wherein there is scarce a Paragraph which has not some one or more rang'd in their improper Classes.</P>
<P>The Senseless Remarks he has made on some of the best of Me∣dicines, show rather the Fertility
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>of his Spleen, than his Understan∣ding: The which nevertheless he fancies unanswerable, by his ha∣ving taken so much pains to bring Quotations from some Authours as Obscure and Splenatick as him∣self for his Vouchers.</P>
<P>His Spleen and Ignorance will be the more remarkable, when we reflect on that Part of his Book, where with his wonted Assu∣rance he tells his Readers, That when it shall please the <HI>Almighty Dispenser</HI> of all things, to afflict them with any Malady, that they need not be very sollicitous con∣cerning the means of their Cure, that they have nothing to fear but the Lethiferous <HI>Apothecary;</HI> That if it should so happen that no Dis∣pensary <HI>Physician</HI> be at hand, 'tis much safer to trust to the uncer∣tain Event of the Disease, and the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>Direction of Nature, or to any thing else, tho' it were but an Old Woman and <HI>Water-Gruel,</HI> than this Bugbear <HI>Apothecary.</HI> This is fine Jargon, and without doubt will be very grateful to a Person tortur'd with a Fit of the <HI>Stone,</HI> or indeed in any other violent Pa∣roxysm or Convulsion of Na∣ture.</P>
<P>It is confess'd, that Nature is most wise in all her Productions; and that if we will closely attend to her, she will never fail to Indi∣cate to us the true way by which she would be assisted by us in her Labours. But this I take to be be∣yond the Power and Address of an Old Woman, or even of our Dis∣pensary <HI>Physician</HI> himself.</P>
<P>To say but one Word more of the Ingenuity of this mighty <HI>Au∣thour;</HI> and that is, that all the Bustle
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>he has made in this Matter, arose from a private Quarrel between him and an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who it seems was a Man of too much Ho∣nour, and of too tenacious a Temper for the Friendship of this worthy <HI>Physician.</HI> When these things I say shall be duly consider'd, I make no question but the World will have just such an opinion of him and his Performance as they both deserve.</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Apothecary</HI> is not obliged to the Receipts of the <HI>Physician</HI> for his Knowledge in the <HI>Administration of Medicines in the Cure of Diseases,</HI> as the Vulgar falsly imagine, but goes to the same Fountain and Drinks as large and as pure Draughts of Know∣ledge as himself: And since most of us are ready to confess, that their Receipts have been so far
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>from being a Direction to us, that they have rather prov'd <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> to mislead us into those Errours we have been guilty of, in relation to Practice.</P>
<P>Since the Present Learning and Labours of the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> are so abundantly evident in this Town, that it would be perfectly needless for me to mention them.</P>
<P>And since we do, and can give Reasons equally with the <HI>Physici∣an,</HI> of the different Operations of Medicines us'd in the Cure of Di∣seases; Why are we thus Branded with the Opprobrious Names of <HI>Quacks, Mountebanks, Empiricks,</HI> and what not, by the Mouth of the Conspiracy, that Mighty Champion for the Cause, The Renowned Dr. <HI>Pitt. O Doctiorum puicquid est Assurgite huic tam colen∣do Nomini.</HI></P>
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<P>'Tis possible, It may be thought by what I have said, that I inten∣ded to bring an Odium on the Manner of Education, as now Practic'd at the Universities, and on those Learned Gentlemen who have been Educated there. I shall only beg leave to assure those Ho∣nourable Foundations, for whom I have the Profoundest Veneration, That I Contend for nothing but the bare Priviledge which our School-Learning Intitles us to, namely, the Understanding <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Authours, as well as the <HI>Physicians,</HI> tho' we have not had the Pleasure of being brought up under their Benign Tuition.</P>
<P>And as for those truly Learned and Worthy <HI>Physicians,</HI> who have not departed from their Integrity, We are so far from the thoughts of Interposing in their Practice,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>That We are, and always shall be ready, as it is our Duty, to Re∣commend and Introduce them, when ever it is in our Power.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> Have I Answer'd Your Request; and I hope have made it appear as much as the Brevity of this Letter will per∣mit, that those High Advantages you seem so fond of, are not so Un∣answerable as You imagin'd; and that in reality, They are no more than Vain, Empty, Airy Notions, the Genuine Production of the Imagination of a Dispensary <HI>Phy∣sician.</HI></P>
<P>As this is barely a <HI>Specimen</HI> of what I have to bring against You, when Leisure and Opportunity offer themselves, I would desire You, as a Friend, in the mean time, to provide your self with a better Shield, to Ward off the
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>Blows of Your Adversary, than your Boasted Advantages are like to prove: And withal, that You will Publish Your Next, that the World may judge fairly the Merits of the Cause, and give the Crown to the Conquerour.</P>
