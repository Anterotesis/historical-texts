<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD RAWDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very slight personal knowledge which I have of your Lordship could not have justified me in the liberty I take in prefixing to this most humble little work your Lordship's name, had I not been well informed, by gentlemen of the highest integrity and honour,
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>who are perfectly acquainted with your Lordship, of your uncommon philan∣thropy and goodness of heart—General report, my Lord, has indeed said suf∣ficient in your praise to entitle you to the world's approbation — But when these were signed, sealed, and delivered to me, by the very respectable charac∣ters before mentioned, it became a most complete ratification of your inestima∣ble worth.</P>
<P>It is not, then, my Lord, to your rank in life that I wish here to pay my respects, but to those virtues which adorn your mind, giving to nobility that true and unsading lustre which can alone render it complete, and which have so eminently distinguished your
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>Lordship as the hero in the field, the real and independent patriot in the se∣nate, in private life the friend to merit, and incessant benefactor to the poor!</P>
<P>It is these, and these alone, my Lord, that I admire — and had they been placed in any other well-formed bosom of inferior rank in life to your Lordship I should equally have paid my tribute to them, <HI>"The widow's mite;"</HI> con∣vinced that the offering, however small, that breathes good will towards man∣kind cannot fail of being acceptable to one of your Lordship's exalted charac∣ter: and if in the subsequent pages I should be so happy as to have given any hints that prove of service to my fellow citizens, &amp;c., and be found worthy of
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>your Lordship's approbation, it will be of no little satisfaction to a person who has the honour to subscribe himself,</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE title of this pamphlet required that it should be written in the plainest and most simple language, which I have endeavoured to do by avoiding as much as possible all technical words, a few excepted, (and those by no means essential to many whether they understand them or not, as they cannot be embarrassed for want of knowing them in the use of the pills, the directions for which are clear and intelligible to the lowest capacity) but what may be found in an English dictionary, to which such as read can have recourse, and they who are so unfortunate as not to be able will re∣ceive information from those that can, which I am certain every truly generous mind will be happy to give them. For the preceding reasons the Author trusts that such recapitulations as the judicious
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>reader meets with in the course of this work will be excused, his wish being to render every thing respecting the medicine it treats of, &amp;c., as plain and easy as possible to the common reader.</P>
<P>The Antibilious Alterative Pills is a most in∣comparable remedy for all indispositions of the stomach and bowels arising <HI>from bile,</HI> foulness, in∣digestion, worms, acidity, ardor ventriculi, (or heartburn, so called) predigestion, <HI>flatulency, (that many headed monster),</HI> costiveness, &amp;c., &amp;c., which last often produces several of the foregoing, as well as many other, complaints, <HI>owing to the feces or excrement becoming highly putrid from too long retention in the body,</HI> thereby forming a nidus, or nest of predisposing putrefaction, which meeting with ma∣lignant exhalations in the air, or those arising from infected persons or places, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., the most dreadful fevers, agues, inflammatory disorders of various kinds, scurvy, erysipelas or St. Anthony's fire, rheumatism, leprosy, jaundice, cruptive com∣plaints, and numberless others, are occasioned: hence arises the necessity of paying the most reli∣gious attention to the first passages of the body, which the able and judicious physician never fails to make the first object of his consideration. The <HI>stomach</HI> is the grand reservoir which receives and prepares whatever is to support and nourish the whole machine, consequently if <HI>that</HI> is out of re∣pair, or diseased from any of the before-mentioned causes, or others, whatever is taken into such a
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>stomach must assuredly fail, more or less, of pro∣ducing the natural and intended effect, and, instead of properly nourishing the body, sends periodically into the circulation—<HI>since blood is made from what we eat and drink</HI>—a portion of diseased matter, which, congregating by degrees, must inevitably occasion various disorders in the system; and although the efforts of nature to relieve herself from the variety of attacks made upon her are often great and won∣derful, (and always should be attended to) yet without the assistance of art, seasonably and pro∣perly administered, she frequently finks under the burden. The same All-good Being that provided remedies for the brute part of the creation, made them also for man; the former are directed by in∣stinct to theirs, the latter should have recourse to reason and experience.</P>
<P>Those Pills, then, which, in conscious rectitude, I now venture to offer to the Public, are the atten∣tive result of thirty years extensive practice in va∣rious parts of the world, (upwards of twenty of which I passed in His Majesty's service, in the army); the officers and soldiers of which, (to whom I have the honour to be known) and whom I beg leave, in this humble, little pamphlet, to invoke, will, I doubt not, do me the justice to speak as, I presume to think, my conduct and character merit, that of being indefatigable, attentive, and candid, in my profession, and successful in my practice: I have the same expectations from those amongst
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>whom I have now practised above ten years in this capital.</P>
<P>I am, however, well aware that this address (and the object of it) is likely to subject me to the sar∣castical sneers of some of the wonderful geniuses of the faculty, many of whom owe, however, perhaps their most exalted fame to the <HI>secret use</HI> of Dr. James's powder, and other medicines of that de∣scription. There are besides, I make no doubt, some other thrusts I must be prepared to parry from those uninformed, contracted minds, who term every medicine, the constituent parts of which the proprietor <HI>keeps in secret,</HI> a quack medicine, and re∣fuse to take it on that account; at the same time swallow abundantly the prescriptions of the apothe∣cary and physician, of which they have just as much knowledge as of the ingredients that compose my pills. But to such I shall only observe, that they are totally ignorant of the true meaning of the word <HI>quack,</HI> that epithet being only applicable to illite∣rate pretenders, not properly bred to the profession, and unacquainted with its practice; otherwise it must necessarily follow that every man, of whatever art, science, or profession, who improves an old, or in∣vents any new thing, because he will not divulge the <HI>secret,</HI> becomes indisputably a quack; conse∣quently there must be quack lawyers and preachers, who profit well by keeping mankind in <HI>secret dark∣ness;</HI> quack painters, coblers, tinkers, and taylors; and it may not be unfair to add, quack physicians of
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>State, who, notwithstanding their feeling regard for His Majesty's loyal subjects, will not blush to crib a shilling's worth of pills out of <HI>The poor Man's Me∣dicine Chest (stamp duty)</HI> to administer to the hectic constitution of the State, and relieve the canine ap∣petite of minions, placemen and pensioners. Here stop for a moment, Humanity! and reflect upon what the sensations of that man's heart must be who first suggested this benevolent tax, <HI>extorted from the painful afflictions and miseries of the sick,</HI> particularly the lower orders of society, who are frequently obliged to seek relief from what are termed quack medicines, after perhaps having spent nearly their little all in vain endeavours to obtain it from the most eminent gentlemen of the faculty.—A nostrum they may term my medicine, if they please, for such it is, (and of which most of the faculty have to boast a few); but which I shall be ready to make known to the Public <HI>for a proper gratuity,</HI> whenever it shall be found to answer, as I am confident it will do, to all such as give it a fair and impartial trial.</P>
<P>I should not have presumed to take up so much of the reader's time as I have done in this address, or have appeared so much my own panegyrist, as most probably I shall be thought, but with a view to re∣move as much as possible the prejudices which ge∣nerally (and sometimes justly) attend on addresses of this sort, particularly when unsanctioned by a voluminous publication entered at Stationers' Hall —a mode quite in fashion with modern practitioners,
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>who begin their career that way to attract public notice; in works of which description the press al∣ready teems with too many in the medical line, the mere offspring of lectures, and stuffed with the wri∣ter's own and borrowed hypotheses, unestablished and inadmissible in practice, serving only to bewilder and lead the Public into fatal errors.</P>
<P>Hippocrates says the description of the causes and treatment of diseases should not be the suppositions of ingenious men, (for all hypotheses, says that learned father of the faculty, I reject as useless, nay dangerous, in physic) but from certain means often tried on human bodies, the effects of which bear evident proof to our senses, all our reasonings should be drawn; not but I ever wish to see in print the well-digested sentiments of able and experienced men of the profession: it is their duty to give them, and the world are indebted to them for such—such as will stand the test and command the sanction of the critical reviewer without fear, partiality, or bribe.</P>
<P>In short, in my private opinion, the study of physic is by no means so difficult, or involved in such labyrinths, as many writers would make the world believe. A proper knowledge of the human system, with strict attention to the efforts and ope∣rations of <HI>nature,</HI> joined to a quick perceptibility on the part of the practitioner to watch and catch the critical period when <HI>she</HI> can't relieve herself, and
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>then to assist her <HI>cautiously</HI> by the proper and expe∣rienced use of such aid as Providence has provided for that purpose, is the only task of a physician.</P>
<P>Having now said as much as I think is necessary to offer (in this place) to a discerning Public in be∣half of my Box of Pills, &amp;c., I shall proceed to give as clear and concise directions as possible for their use in the complaints already mentioned, and some others, making some farther remarks as I go along.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>DIRECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>For a grown person, <HI>a common dose of these pills is three,</HI> one to be taken going to bed, and two the next morning. Strong constitutions may take two night and morning, and some have taken three night and morning; but in general one at night and two in the morning is sufficient, and many require only one night and morning.</P>
<P>A child of one year old may take a third part of one of the pills; from three years to five, half a pill, and from five to ten a whole pill; and so on in proportion to age and strength. As it may be diffi∣cult to make children swallow a pill, it may be dis∣solved in any simple liquid, or mixed with a little pap or currant jelly.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<P>My reason for preferring part of the dose to be taken over night is, that, by gradually dissolving whilst the body is at rest, it mixes more readily with the offending matter in the stomach, &amp;c., thereby exciting it into action, renders the remain∣ing part of the dose more effectual and speedy in its operation in the morning.</P>
<P>As these pills are a declared enemy to <HI>bile,</HI> when∣ever that is in the stomach they never fail to vomit, and sometimes one pill in the course of the night will operate both ways; not owing to the violence or strength of the medicine, as some may be in∣duced to think, but from the great soulness and plenitude of the stomach and bowels at the time be∣ing overloaded with bilious filth or too-long-retained feces — a self-evident position which must appear clear to every intelligent capacity — therefore should the night pill only operate by vomit, the patient must not be deterred from taking more in the morn∣ing; for after the stomach has been well cleansed of its contents, two or three more pills will only occa∣sion as many stools without any farther sickness. If after the first dose any part of the cause which in∣duced taking them should appear to remain, they may be taken daily, or every other day, until all the offending matter is carried off.</P>
<P>During their operation it will be proper to drink a draught of gruel, beef or chamomile tea, or some such simple liquid, to sacilitate each operation, and
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>render it more effectual, which the patient will do well to have in readiness previous to taking the pills.</P>
<P>This efficacious medicine, though sometimes so brisk in operating, is notwithstanding, I do aver, as innocent and as safe as a dose of salts, rhubarb, or a common emetic, and may be taken at all times and seasons with as little risk or danger, as they will always find their way out of the body by vomit, stool, or urine, and quietly by the latter, unless when they meet with such humours in their passage as required being carried off by the other outlets.</P>
<P>The advantages, then, arising from these pills, according to this unvarnished account, must be many, and great.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, By effectually cleansing the <HI>stomach,</HI> that grand reservoir is put in a proper state to perform the important offices, for which nature intended it, of digestion, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, By removing all long-retained feces, and bilious, slimy matter from the lower bowels, fevers, jaundice, agues, cholic, worms, <HI>flatulency,</HI> inslammatory tendency, rhcumatism, &amp;c., &amp;c., are cut off in the bud and destroyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, In filtering by the kidnies and urinary passages, gravelly concretions, dropsy, &amp;c., are hap∣pily
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>relieved and prevented; and lastly, by con∣veying <HI>accumulated salts</HI> and other acrid and feculant humours out of the blood by this channel, leprosy, scurvy, scrophulous humours, and many eruptive complaints, and other foulnesses of the blood <HI>arising from thence,</HI> as well as all that tribe of complaints termed nervous, originating from the same source, (since the nerves as well as the rest of the body re∣ceive their nourishment from the blood) are pre∣vented, and often cured.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Hence it will appear that these pills are not only an effectual cleanser of the stomach and bowels, but also a most POWERFUL ALTERATIVE.</P>
<P>To which end, after having properly prepared the body by two or three <HI>common doses,</HI> taken in the space of a week or ten days, the patient should then enter on the alterative course, first by taking one pill at night for four or five nights successively, after∣wards take one night and morning; continuing these as long as any part of the cause or effect which induced taking them appears to remain; and it will not be amiss to continue them some little time longer, (for it sometimes happens that causes re∣main after effects vanish; and frequently it happens, as, for instance, in the small pox, that effects, such as a redness of the skin, &amp;c., remain for some time after the cause is removed) observing to in∣crease the night or morning dose occasionally to keep the body gently open. It having been already re∣marked,
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>that after the stomach has been well cleansed they cease to act as an emetic; for as the bodies of some are constitutionally costive, it may become necessary in such habits to increase the dose as just mentioned, yet, in general, a pill night and morn∣ing not only relieves the most costive habits, but one will prove sufficient in most constitutions for that purpose. Here it may not be improper to remark, that costive habits are more subject than others to offensive and fetid breath, (particularly children whose powers of digestion are by no means equal to the too great quantity of strong and improper food they commonly take in); which idea perhaps may be one motive why the French have such frequent recourse to <HI>lavement,</HI> or clyster. I say it has been already observed that our blood is made from what we take into the stomach, from whence is prepared that milky liquid called chyle, which forms the basis of the blood, the whole process of which is per∣formed within the space of twenty-four hours; after which period the feces or excrement can answer no good purpose by remaining in the body, since all their nutritive and essential parts (good or bad, which depends upon the nature of the food so taken in and state of the stomach) has been extracted for the above purpose. Now as the feces in the most healthy constitutions are rendered highly offensive when discharged at the end, or in the course of that time, how much more putrid must they inevitably become if retained for days or weeks, as is very
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>often the case in relaxed and weak habits, more especially such as lead sedentary and inactive lives!</P>
<P>During the alterative course it will be highly ne∣cessary for the patient to observe such mode in diet as is calculated to aid and assist the intention of the medicine, by avoiding all salted, high-seasoned, and inflammatory food; yet notwithstanding to partake of such proper innocent and nourishing food as is sufficient to keep up the bodily strength and pro∣duce good juices; for my wish is not to reduce the patient's strength, only to conquer the disease, and by supporting the constitution properly they will be the better enabled to obtain that end. But as it is impossible to give a bill of fare suitable to every constitution, palate, and situation in life, suffice it, therefore, to say, that the food should be simple, easy of digestion, nutritive, plain dressed, and mo∣derately taken; that is, not to load the stomach with too much at one time, but rather to eat as in∣stinctive animals do in a state of nature, little and often—a hint from thence is no bad precedent, for nature will ever be found to exceed the best philoso∣phical reasonings of art.</P>
<P>After what has been already said, I think it al∣most unnecessary to add, that such as are accustomed to take physic in the spring and autumn will find this the best they can have recourse to. Indeed no person, however healthy, would be the worse for employing this friendly scavenger once or twice a
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>month; and all such who are so unfortunate as to labour under a <HI>very fashionable disease</HI> will find these pills a most certain remedy, <HI>(taken agreeable to the alterative course just laid down),</HI> without having their bodies loaded, like a barometer, with mercury, owing to the too liberal use of which, in the present practice, many unsortunate beings (though cured of that disease) are left a wreck, subject, like the ma∣thematical instrument, to every vicissitude of wea∣ther, to trail out a miserable existence.</P>
<P>Women also at the turn of life would do well to pay strict attention to this medicine, being in every respect calculated to carry off the humours which nature often, embarrassed with at that critical pe∣riod, throws on the legs and other parts of the body, rendering the remainder of their days painful, and often burdensome.</P>
<P>And even women with child need not be afraid to take these pills (because they sometimes vomit) to remove that costiveness they are commonly subject to in that situation. Since vomiting is a natural at∣tendant upon pregnant women, (and sometimes vio∣lently so) particularly in their first pregnancy, which the wisdom of Providence has so ordered, no doubt, for the best of ends; and if any danger was likely to ensue from that operation, we might surely ex∣pect it at that time, when all the bowels are more than ordinarily compressed from the extension of the uterus and weight of the foetus; yet who ever
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>heard of any such women being injured by vo∣miting?</P>
<P>In the course of my practice I never met with any instance of the kind; on the contrary, I always found it relieved, and made them more cheerful and easy. Again, how frequently do people at sea go through that operation several times a day for weeks together without any bad consequences from the operation itself? And even hectic people, and others who have been to all appearance at the last gasp, and given over by their physician, by making a sea voyage have been effectually relieved by that operation, and returned home, to the astonishment of all that knew them, perfectly sound and hearty; and yet notwithstanding all these evident proofs be∣fore their eyes, most people are terrisied at taking an emetic.</P>
<P>As the greatest inconveniency which attends this operation (particularly in costive habits) arises from wind pent up in the bowels, which sometimes occa∣sion griping pains therein during the action of an emetic; that might in a great measure, if not alto∣gether, be prevented by administering the following or some such clyster previous to taking any thing of the emetic kind, viz. Take about half a pint of gruel or broth of any kind, a table spoonful of common salt, three large spoonsuls of vinegar, and as much of oil, mixed, makes one for a grown per∣son. In short, wind being, from that necessary de∣licacy
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>observed in society, often kept back when nature is disposed to discharge it, lays the foundation of innumerable tormenting complaints; the wind so restrained I have frequently, when sitting in com∣pany, heard rumbling for a considerable time in the bowels of a person several seats from me. And once travelling in a stage coach, (from Stamford to Lon∣don) a poor woman therein, from a circumstance of this sort, was greatly embarrassed and put to the blush from the tittering of two unfeeling young men (farmers to appearance) fellow travellers: she soon after grew pale, and was about to faint when I stopped the coach, and got her out in the air; upon which she fell into a strong hysteric fit, that held above half an hour, in the course of which she ex∣pelled an immense deal of wind both upwards, &amp;c., which contributed to her recovery. I mention this just to prove how little a matter will put the boasted human machine out of sorts, and to reprobate the unfeeling conduct of such as can enjoy a laugh at the painful misfortunes of their fellow creatures, particularly of that sex who command our most hu∣mane and affectionate attention, being, from the pe∣culiar restraint their modesty lays them under, liable to many inconveniences which men are not.</P>
<P>In the year 1770 the following extraordinary case occurred at Mahon, in the island of Minorca: — William Kearns, a soldier of the Old Buffs, was sitting on a stone seat by the guard-room door, be∣tween the hours of nine and ten at night, with se∣veral
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>others of the guard. His comrade, on passing by him to the guard room, in play, put himself in a boxing attitude, saying, <Q>"Have at you, Kearns; I can lick you now."</Q> Upon which Kearns threw his head back suddenly against the wall, the dis∣tance about six inches, which made him call out, seemingly dipleased, <Q>"Damn you, messmate, that's no joke—I believe you have made me break my sconce."</Q> Then taking off his hat, he rubbed the back of his head with his hand, saying, <Q>"I will be up with you for this."</Q> The other ran laughing into the guard room.—Kearns continued afterwards above half an hour sitting at the door, talking as usual to the other men, without appearing the least indisposed, or saying any thing more about his head. He then went in and laid down on the guard bed. At twelve o'clock, being to go sentinel, and not turning out with the relief, the corporal, thinking he was asleep, went in to rouse him, and sound him lying on his side foaming at the mouth, speechless, and his eyes wide open. The corporal then called to some of the men to come and see him, and they tried to raise him up; upon which he fetched a deep groan and expired. One of the men ran to Mr. Duffy, surgeon to the 67th regiment, who lived almost opposite the guard house, and another to me, about half a mile distant. Mr. Duffy went to him immediately, and opened the temple artery; but it was too late—he was dead. Upon my arrival soon after I learnt the preceding account. We then out off his hair, and carefully examined the head
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>and every part, but could not perceive the smallest external injury whatsoever, except a very slight ex∣travasation of blood behind the left ear, the side he lay on the guard bed. About one o'clock that day I opened the head of the deceased in presence of Dr. Monro, physician to the garrison, Mr. Duffy, and anoher surgeon; when we found about two ounces (not more) of coagulated blood on the right anterior hemisphere of the brain, which appeared to have issued from a vessel of the dura mater; every other part of the membranes, brain, ventri∣cles, &amp;c., &amp;c., were in as sound and perfect a state as possible; the head was uncommonly full of brain, and the scull remarkably thin, and in many places quite diaphanous.</P>
<P>Dr. Monro immediately waited on General John∣ston, the Governor of the Island, to report his own and our opinion of this case; and Mr. Duffy and I proceeded to open the body, not in expectation of finding any thing farther relative to the cause of this man's death, but from a custom I always followed of opening the body of every soldier that died. Upon raising the breast bone a very uncommon fulness ap∣peared on the left side about the heart, and on divi∣ding the pericardium a great quantity of very fetid wind issued forth, and about four table spoonfuls of clear lymph. The heart of this man (who was a very stout, well-made soldier, thirty-two years of age, and about five feet eight inches high) was un∣commonly small indeed, (weighing only fifteen
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>ounces five drams Troy) and looked as if it had been parboiled. The lungs, liver, stomach, and all the other entrails, were in as sound and perfect a state as possible, and in every other respect formed as much for longevity as any I ever saw in my life. I have been the more particular in stating all the circumstances of this case from the supposed cause of his death, <HI>and the very extraordinary contents of the pericardium</HI> and state of the heart, leaving the deci∣sion of the real cause of this man's death to those whose superior skill and microscopic discernment may enable them to give a better solution to it than I chuse to risk my opinion in giving; at the same time to shew <HI>that windy complaints</HI> are (what I have al∣ready said of them) numerous, wonderful, and often puzzling, and therefore how necessary it is <HI>that all dead bodies should be opened</HI> for information sake, since the dead cannot be injured, and the living may benefit by it.—This case I have singled out from several others which I have in my possession relative to windy tumours discovered by dissection. I beg leave to add, that this man had once or twice been troubled with a slight asthmatic complaint; but in every other respect was as healthy, to all appearance, as any soldier in the regiment.</P>
<P>To return again to the subject of emetics.</P>
<P>Some time ago I was called to a gentleman, a very free liver, and an extraordinary hard drinker, who I make no doubt had a hundred times in his life vomited most severely from inebriety, infinitely
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>more so than he would have done from any common emetic given by the faculty; notwithstanding which, upon my proposing a vomit for him, which his situation absolutely required, he immediately held up his hands, begging for God's sake he might not take an emetic; <HI>that he was too weak;</HI> that it would strain him to pieces and kill him. He, however, got an emetic, and obtained the wanted relief.—I say again, that, after all these incontrovertible ex∣amples, it seems to me most strange that a rational being should be so much afraid of this operation, when many of the brute part of the creation (that feed carnivorously) take such things as instinct di∣rects them to in order to discharge the offending contents of their stomach that way; and I have seen a hawk disgorge the contents of his craw: but I believe no person ever saw an ox, or an ass, a goat, or gander, vomit, of course nature never intended it.</P>
<P>Here, by the by, though foreign to the subject of these leaves, permit me, however, to offer a hint about the treatment of horses, which noble animal I am clearly of opinion has been often tortured, <HI>if not killed,</HI> by having things of the emetic kind ad∣ministered, since a horse can no more vomit than an ass, though I once heard a gentleman declare that he saw a dead horse vomit after having Dr. James's powders given him when alive; but as this is a mat∣ter I may perhaps treat more at large on some future day, I shall close it here, only adding, that I am sa∣tisfied
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>from all I have seen and heard that many medicines that are used by mankind are totally im∣proper and highly dangerous for such animals as feed granivorously and cannot vomit. But how this er∣roneous method of treating horses as human beings has become the practice could be very easily ac∣counted for.</P>
<P>Vomiting is, I must, however, confess, a very unpleasant operation; but, believe me, it is a much more speedy and effectual method of relieving the stomach of its offending contents than carrying it off by the other channel, through all the turnings, festoonings, and curvatures of the lower bowels, in the cells of which some of the feces will frequently stick and lodge for weeks, nay months together, forming that nidus of mischief I have before men∣tioned, of which the following is a case in point:—A soldier of the third regiment of foot (in which I served several years) was seized with a cholic in the latter end of September, 1771, at Exeter, where we were at that time quartered after returning from Minorca, which place we left in the month of May preceding, and arrived in England the beginning of June. As we were in a cyder country, I suspected his complaint might arise from drinking that li∣quor: but he assured me that he had not drank any cyder; that he did not like it. However, after ta∣king a few doses of rhubarb, and some other little things, his complaint went off, and he returned to his duty; but being a few days after attacked again
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>with the same disorder in a most violent degree, he was taken into the hospital—every thing he took came off his stomach immediately, and, in spite of every effort, no passage could be procured down∣wards. Being now exceedingly alarmed for the safety of my patient, I directed <HI>one of my pills</HI> to be given every hour until they should operate by stool; the two first pills made him rather sick, but did not vomit him: after taking six, they began to operate downwards, and in one of the discharges he brought off a great quantity, near a handful, of <HI>grape skins,</HI> highly <HI>putrid and offensive.</HI> From that hour his violent pain went off, and in a week he was perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>Questioning him now about this appearance <HI>and evident cause of his complaint,</HI> I asked if he had eat any raisins, either alone or in pudding. He assured me he had not taken any thing of the kind since he was on ship board; but that on his leaving Minorca a friend gave him several pounds of <HI>dried grapes</HI> by way of sea stock; that he eat them all on his passage, and from that time had never tasted any thing of the kind. He remembered, he said, that the grapes griped him often in the same place as when he first applied to me, but not so much as to occasion an ap∣plication then, as the pain generally went off with a motion, and he thought they did him good. How∣ever, it is very clear that a part of this trash remain∣ed in his body near four months. Besides this, se∣veral
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>other similar cases have occurred to me in the course of practice.</P>
<P>Gouty habits, and all those who live freely either in eating or drinking, (for the reasons already stated concerning the stomach and bowels) will find this a sovereign remedy for the sudden and violent attacks which such are often subject to.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be asked how can any one medicine be good for so many different complaints as the au∣thor has mentioned? To which I answer, BECAUSE IT IS AN ALTERATIVE! By which it is meant, that all such offending humours in the body as <HI>nature</HI> is not able of herself to throw off, are, by means of this medicine, so changed, disposed, and rendered capable of expulsion by the proper channels or out∣lets, as to assist <HI>her efforts</HI> in removing them effec∣tually.—And now I beg leave, in turn, to ask of all those good folks who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel, how it happens that antimony, bark, mer∣cury, and even several insignificant and other medi∣cines which I could mention, are made use of by all and every physician and medical practitioner <HI>as ge∣neral remedies</HI> for almost every disease that falls under their cognizance? And lastly, though often too late, why the patient is recommended <HI>to that universal re∣medy,</HI> Bath water, &amp;c., when the doctor can do no more for him?</P>
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
<P>I shall not, however, presume to impose so far upon the understanding of the Public as to endea∣vour to maintain that my pills are an infallible reme∣dy for all the diseases to which human nature is in∣cident: but thus much I venture positively and boldly to assert, that I do not believe it is in the power of chemical or medical art to compose a bet∣ter medicine, a milder and more COMPLETE ALTERATIVE out of the drugs, &amp;c. in present use. But what future time may produce I cannot pretend to say.</P>
<P>Surgeons of the army and navy, (without dero∣gating from their abilities) by providing themselves with these pills, would have a remedy immediately at hand, (which their situations sometimes will not admit them to get seasonably prepared) by which means many valuable lives might be saved, and themselves spared much trouble and expence; but particularly masters of merchant ships, <HI>who have no medical assistance,</HI> (more especially such as visit warm climates, where bilious complaints are most preva∣lent) and also those who live in the country remote from <HI>such aid,</HI> would find The poor Man's Medicine Chest (what I have justly termed it) a most invalua∣ble remedy.</P>
<P>Here it may not be improper to give a little ad∣vice to those also who visit Margate and other water∣ing places, in the season, for the benefit of their healths, from whence many return worse than they
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>went, and numbers lose their lives from injudicious bathing. Though I am convinced from experience that the use of the cold bath, when properly ap∣plied, is of the highest importance towards pre∣serving of health, yet it should never be had re∣course to until the body is first properly prepared, not by a few doses of salt water, as is usually the case, which slips quickly through the bowels, lea∣ving behind the long-retained feces, &amp;c., <HI>which I have so pointedly described,</HI> possessing no powers to act upon them effectually: for give me leave to ac∣quaint those who think that one thing that opens the body is as good as another, that they are most egregiously mistaken, for, in fact, there is as much difference between one purgative and another as be∣tween wine and water; for though both of these will allay thirst, yet they will not equally exhilerate the spirits and produce intoxication. Permit me, therefore, most humbly to recommend to all such as visit those places, <HI>for their health's sake,</HI> previously to prepare themselves for a fortnight or three weeks with my pills, agreeable to the <HI>alterative course</HI> laid down in page 10, convinced they will find their advantage in so doing. Afterwards, I have no objec∣tion to their drinking occasionally a dose of salt water, if they like it, to keep the body gently open, being perfectly proper the body should be so kept during a course of bathing.</P>
<P>There is one hint more, and that of no small im∣portance, which I shall presume to offer to bathers,
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>which is to live <HI>temperately and regularly</HI> whilst they are seeking relief from the bath, and not go into it hissing hot, like an iron out of a smith's forge plunged into his trough, after sitting up all night, and partaking most unmercifully of all the luxuries of the season; which misconduct I am fully per∣suaded has brought numbers to an untimely grave!</P>
<P>I could offer some other useful remarks upon this subject; but as it would extend this little work beyond the limits proposed, I shall reserve them for another place. For the same reason I shall also omit many respectable and well-authenticated vou∣chers, which I have in my possession, of the won∣derful effects my pills have already produced; but indeed I could rather wish they should establish themselves by their future good works, than endea∣vour to support them by anterior authorities.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I think it a duty I owe the Public, as well as myself, to make a remark or two more; and although it is neither my talent nor wish to depreciate the productions of others with a view to enhance the value of my own, yet it is but jus∣tice to draw a fair line between mine and some of the pills which are at present in much-esteemed use, not doubting at the same time but such are justly entitled to the approbation they have obtained from the benefit those who used them have experienced, and who think themselves, no doubt, as much in∣debted to them for such relief as they would have
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>been to the prescriptions of the late Sir Richard Jebb, or any great physician of the present day, of the ingredients of whose prescriptions they had no more knowledge than of those that constituted such pills; and therefore I humbly presume it is of very little consequence to the party who is so relieved, whether obtained from Sir Jeffery Dunstan, Mayor of Garratt, or the Vicar of Bray! But as one watch excels another in regulating time, so may one medicine surpass another in momentous essicacy. Many of those pills, then, which I shall forbear to call by name, lest I should incur the appellation of being envious, and increase the number of my op∣ponents, being only calculated to act merely as a purgative, can by no means come in <HI>competition with</HI> what I have asserted (and on which I pledge my re∣putation) <HI>mine</HI> will be sound to persorm; conse∣quently a medicine of this sort has long been want∣ing. Therefore, without entertaining an iota of doubt but I shall in due time receive from a generous Public the approbation I seek <HI>for the offering made,</HI> I shall now conclude with an old but just proverb —</P>
<Q>— Siquid novisti reslius islis, Candidus imperti: si non, his utere me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.</Q>
<P>☞ Having entitled my box of pills The poor Man's Medicine Chest! it remains for me to main∣tain that appellation. These pills, then, are put up in boxes at four shillings and six pence, and ton shillings and six pence, <HI>slamps</HI> included. The small
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>box contains forty-eight pills, or twelve large doses. Now as a common dose is but three, and some re∣quire only two pills, it will often happen that this box may contain twenty doses; and whoever is obliged to have recourse to an apothecary for an equal number of doses of medicine would have at least twenty shillings to pay, exclusive of some con∣sideration for his trouble and attendance, and per∣haps not receive as much benefit from the whole as from one dose of these pills. The large box con∣tains one hundred and twenty pills, or thirty large doses.</P>
<P>For the present, the pills will be sold by the Proprietor only, at his Patent Baume of Arquebu∣sade Warehouse, No. 13, Leicester Street, Leicester Square; (the use of which Baume has been found, as will appear by the annexed letters, of the highest importance); but as soon as proper persons are ap∣pointed to vend them, their names will be affixed to this publication; and the better to prevent imposi∣tions, each box is sealed with his coat of arms — Motto, <HI>Confido in Deo!</HI></P>
<P>The Public are requested to pay strict attention to these circumstances, since there are a number of medicasters and other piratical wretches ever ready to obtrude on the world their own dangerous imita∣tions for the works of others, (preying like the hornet on the honey of the industrious bee) under a pretence of being able to analyse, without knowing
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>the nature of that arduous and nice process, and many of those pretenders not even the meaning of the word; by which means a most valuable medi∣cine loses its reputation, and the Public are de∣ceived.</P>

<P>I SHOULD think myself lost to all sense of gra∣titude if I did not acknowledge that, under God, you have been the saver of my life by the use of your <HI>Baume d'Arquebusade;</HI> and I am now happy in acquainting you that all those violent pains in my stomach and bowels, as well as my loins and kidnies,
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>disagreeable belchings, cold clammy sweats, cos∣tiveness, sloppage of urine, restless nights, &amp;c., &amp;c., occasioned by a bilious complaint which I contracted in America, have all entirely left me, and I am now, thank God, in perfect health. — For the first ten or twelve days I took the Baume I thought myself worse, and left it off; but at your particular re∣quest I began to use it again, and in about a week found myself better, and began to void gravel of a hard red substance, which I continued voiding, more or less, every day for upwards of two months; sometimes found the quantity of a tea-spoonsul of this gravel in my pot of a morning. Indeed when I took to the Baume a second time I had little or no hopes of myself, (whatever you might have) ha∣ving been under the care of one or other of the fa∣culty for upwards of three years, and could get no relief until I applied to you. In humanity to my fellow creatures I should wish this letter to be made public; but that as you please —</P>

<P>I BEG leave to express my gratitude, as an in∣dividual, for the obligation you have conserred on mankind by the discovery of your <HI>Baume d'Arque∣busade,</HI> and also to inform you of the benefit I have derived from it. I had been afflicted three years with a violent bilious complaint, attended with con∣stant severs, lowness of spirits, violent head-achs, &amp;c., &amp;c. I applied to several of the most eminent of the faculty, and took all the medicines which were recommended: went twice to Bath for the be∣nesit of the waters; the first time of using them found myself much worse, as they increased my fever, head-ach, &amp;c.; the second time they had little or no effect. I at length despaired of a re∣medy, and thought all I could hope was to prevent the complaint's increasing by a strict regard to diet, when I heard of the wonderful effects of your <HI>Baume d'Arquebusade,</HI> and resolved to try it. At first it would not stay on my stomach, and occasioned saint∣ness and burning sensation in my throat: though I was rather discouraged by those unpleasant effects, I however determined to give it a fair trial, and by the time I had sinished the first bottle these effects ceased, and I began to find benefit. In about three months I became perfectly free from all complaints, and have ever since enjoyed a confirmed state of health.—I have no objection to your publishing this letter, if you think proper; and am ready to an∣swer,
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>in person, to any who may wish to question me upon the subject.</P>

<P>"YOUR Arquebusade Concentre <HI>is of the utmost use to us.</HI> I have never yet applied it inwardly; but in bruises, sprains, severe cuts, and rheumntic com∣plaints, it has never failed.

My Overseer's foot was jammed by a cart, and it cured him in a sew days. We use it for all sores in ne∣groes legs, and it never fails. From this you may guess that my provision thereof is much diminished; therefore beg you will send me double the quantity I had the last year.
