<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the Year 1769, the Au∣thor of the following Tract, being frequently Witness to the Mise∣ries
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>attending People that had the Mis∣fortune to be burned or scalded, was in∣duced to apply himself studiously to observe the Effects, and to find a Re∣medy that would quickly restore Na∣ture, and one so simple, that it might in general be readily adopted in all Fa∣milies. —This Desideratum was ac∣cordingly, after many Experiments about that Time, acquired, and Num∣bers that have been miserably scorched and scalded have been instantaneously cured by following the Author's Me∣thod.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>THE outer Dress of Ladies being of late Years composed of Gauze, Muslin, and other inflammable Articles, which blaze away so violently, when they un∣fortunately take Fire, that the most dreadful Mischief has ensued, too sud∣denly for Prevention. The Numbers of the Unfortunate have much increased with the Fashion;—how many have of late been most miserably scorched and defaced;—how many have suffered a lingering death, under the most ex∣cruciating tortures;—while the Me∣thods used as Remedies have only
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>served to lengthen the Term of their Misery.</P>
<P>THE Author presumes, that the Uti∣lity of his Method will entitle it to a favourable Reception with the Public, and that there need no Apology for the Publication.</P>
<P>IN the Use of Oil, and several other Things that are applied as Remedies for Scalds and Burns, it may be observed, that Nature denies their Admission into the Pores of the Skin. That the acid Perspira∣tion,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>Plenty of which is generally upon the Surface of the Skin, together with the continued Action of Nature through the Pores, are Repellers of several Things that would be Remedies in these Cases.</P>
<P>THE Author surmised, that if this acid Perspiration was to be overcome, or continually washed away as it is produced, that Applications might then take Effect; and in Consequence of those Observations, after repeated Experiments, he laid down the follow∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>easy Rules, which, when practised, were never known to fail, but many and surprising Cures have been per∣formed; and so far from giving Pain, that the Pain caused by the Burning or Scalding ceases immediately on the Application. Whereas such violent Pains are produced by the Application of Spirits, and some other Things, that the Remedy is worse than the Disease, and the Patient lingers out a most mi∣serable Life, and dies the most excru∣ciating of all Deaths.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<P>TAKE Soft Soap (Hard if that is not to be had), dissolve it in boiling Water, exceeding strong, in as little Water as possible; then make it cold immediately, by the Addition of cold Water; be careful to observe, that there be full six Ounces of Soap in every Gallon of this cold Solution, and Half a Drachm of Sal Tartar:— Then put in the injured Part, and move it gently about, keeping it there Half an Hour: For a recent Matter this is sufficient; if it be of long Standing it may be continued or repeated as Oc∣casion requires.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<P>MIND to have Solution in Proportion to the Nature of the Case. If a Per∣son is scalded or scorched all over, he or she may stand or sit up to the Chin naked in it, and frequently immerge the Head, or let some Person continu∣ally pour plentifully of the Solution upon the Head.</P>
<P>IN this Case, it will take 50 or 60 Gallons of Water, and from 18 lb. to 22 lb. of Soap, with about two Ounces of Sal Tartar.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<P>THIS will be strong enough to take off all Greasiness and Dirt from the Body, without rubbing. It will keep the injured Part soft and cold, while the Circulation regains its usual or a new Course, and innate Nature repairs the Havoc made by the Fire.</P>
<P>A FEW Cases, among many, here follow, by Way of Elucidation:</P>
<P>A BOY having his Leg scalded, by a Pan-full of boiling Water being thrown upon it, after trying various Methods
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>for three or four Days to no Purpose, was cured by keeping it in the Solution (prepared as abovementioned) about Half an Hour, so that the Pain never returned, and the Leg healed in a very short Time.</P>
<P>IN like Manner, a Man was cured who burned the Skin off his Hand, and terribly scorched the Flesh, against a hot Plate of Iron.</P>
<P>THE Author having accidentally slipped his Arm, almost up to the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>Elbow, into a Copper of Water that was boiling furiously; he put it into cold Water, which immediately took off the Pain, which was become exces∣sive; while immersed, it was be∣numbed and senseless, but when took out of the Water, the Pain returned with great Violence.—He therefore kept it in this Situation while the So∣lution was making as above.—The Soap being dissolved and cooled well, he plunged his Hand and Arm in it; the Pain never returned, the Numb∣ness went off, and the Limb as it were
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>revivified; he continued it in the above Solution about 15 Minutes, and never after felt the least Pain or ill Effects from this terrible Scald.</P>
