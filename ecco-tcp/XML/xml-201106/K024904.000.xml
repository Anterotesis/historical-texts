<P>I Have perused a Pamphlet entitled, <HI>Some Reasons why the Practice of Inoculation ought to be introduced into the Town of</HI> Bury <HI>at Present,</HI> and have been surprized to find this elaborate Piece so little in Substance, and so lit∣tle to the Purpose: Insomuch that at the first, I determined on∣ly to point out, and expose the Mistakes of it in Conversation, being under a full Perswasion and Conviction, that the Author would <HI>Triumph neither a Week nor a Day,</HI> but that the Pro∣ject <HI>would</HI> very soon <HI>end in Confusion.</HI> Being since reminded of a warm Resolution made by me, to oppose any Efforts to re∣vive a Practice so justly exploded and condemned by all rational Men, I have changed my Mind, and set Pen to Paper; but if a Promise to answer an Author before I knew the weight and Strength of his Arguments, may be by <HI>some</HI> thought Rashness and Prejudice, I hope an Abhorrence I have of a Practice so cruel, unsafe, and uncertain to Mankind, an impartial Consi∣deration and full Acquaintance of what has been advanced pro and con, and a great Diffidence of the Author's Abilities to support it, may to <HI>others</HI> clear me from the Imputation of Rashness and Prepossession.</P>
<P>THIS barbarous and dangerous Invention was about 10 Years past imported at <HI>London</HI> from <HI>Turkey;</HI> the Curiosity like many other <HI>foreign</HI> Monsters pleased at first, but soon after grew un∣governable by it's own Masters, and when let loose, made great Havock and Slaughter. But after all the Difficulties and Dis∣appointments,
<PB N="4" REF="2"/>it was endeavoured to be buoy'd up by <HI>able</HI> Hands which undertook to prove that this <HI>Turkish</HI> Method of Inoculation, might safely and securely be practised in our Cli∣mate and upon our Constitutions, and that a <HI>Circassian</HI> Impiety of bringing Diseases upon ourselves was reconcileable to a Chri∣stian Conscience.</P>
<P>BUT in spight of all such Aids, and Supports, it daily sunk into disuse and contempt, and of late has scarce been menti∣oned amongst Us, till our Author on a reliance of his mathe∣matical Skill, and a thorough Acquaintance with the Doctrine of Chances, undertook to strike a new Light, to open our Eyes, and by plain and easy Calculations, to evince the Reason∣ableness and Security of it, <HI>even to a Demonstration.</HI></P>
<P>VAIN Delusion! For if many have died in <HI>London,</HI> when the Incisions were made by the most skillful Hands, and under the Care and Direction of the most Eminent <HI>Regular</HI> Physicians What (may we suppose) will be the Consequence? What a Tra∣gic Scene shall we have? when this Practice shall be brought into the Country, and committed to common Hands, Men of less Abilities and no Experience; but from hence it appears, <HI>Providence has given some Persons Heads to contrive, and Hands to execute any thing that will serve their own Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to proceed to my Undertaking of an Answer, which I shall do by giving my Opinion of the Tract in general, and then make some Remarks upon the Observations, Calculations, and Arguments in particular.</P>
<P>IN the general View I observe three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A specious Pretext of a tender Concern for the Detri∣ment of all Trade, and <HI>perhaps loss of Assizes, Sessions,
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>Fairs, and other publick Meetings,</HI> which is a popular Argu∣ment to the Tradesmen of the Town. But here I must observe, that this Practice was endeavoured to be introduced, when only a Person or two had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> when the variolous Matter was to be purchased at a <HI>dear</HI> Rate, and all the Tradesmen were very active and vigilant, to prevent its spreading. How∣ever 'twas very necessary that this artful Address to the Popu∣lace, should appear glittering at the Top to engage their At∣tention, but unluckily <HI>Self-serving</HI> pops up in the Middle, and <HI>Self-regard</HI> lurks and skulks at the Bottom. But this is not the only Instance of his Fondness of being thought <HI>Some∣body,</HI> for the Reader must be acquainted with his Conversation with Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> at the Coffee-house, and his Correspondence with Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> when he was at <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HIS Submission of the <HI>Business of his Paper to the Cler∣gy</HI> is respectful, but designing, and perhaps the Gentlemen of that Order are very little oblig'd to him for his Compliment, for I am very much mistaken if many of them are not able to give more Reasons than are founded upon a Supposition that the Practice does not <HI>promote our Lives, Healths, and Hap∣piness,</HI> but in Casuistry are convinced that the Practice is pre∣sumptious and sinful; but as to the Morality of it, shall refer him to those Gentlemen he shall have the Honour to have farther Converse with.</P>
<P N="3">3. I OBSERVE his Arguments are old, stale, and borrow'd, and that he has chose <HI>some Reasons</HI> out of many, very injudi∣ciously; for he has offer'd the Weakest and left the most Enfor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing. Does this ill Choice proceed from want of Judgment? To presume that, by his Friends would be interpreted a Weak∣ness of my own; I will rather then imagine that he writes with great Cunning and Policy, and has been taught by some military Man a stratagem in War, <HI>viz.</HI> To place sometimes the weakest of his Forces in the Front, and spare his bravest
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>Men to do the most Execution, for which Reason, and under which Caution, I shall reserve my Veterans till we come to a closer Engagement.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to consider his Observations, Calculations, and Arguments in particular.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ART. I.P. 3.</HI></BIBL> If Inoculation was generally practised— we need not have it six Months.</Q>
<P>IF this Limitation of the Small Pox to six Months be true it must be so, because by an Elegancy of Stile, the Author can perswade all the Timorous to undergo an Operation they think dangerous, and by his Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istry can prevail upon the Scrupulous to enter upon an Action they believe Sinful, and can be secure upon Inoculation of producing any variolous Symptoms and Pustules, and besides all this has by his irrefraga∣ble Arguments, proved a general Inoculation an infallible Pre∣servative against the Distemper in a natural Way. Now if I could imagine this to be Fact, yet I would not dare to assert and fix so exact a Time as <HI>of six Months</HI> for its Continuance. But I am fully assured he has not removed the Apprehensions of the Fearful, or satisfied the Doubts of the Conscientious, nor even promised to produce the Distemper by Inoculation in every Case, nor given good Reasons of security against the Small Pox in a natural Way after Inoculation; to say then we need not have it <HI>six Months,</HI> is downright Arrogance and Presumption.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ART. II.P. 3.</HI></BIBL> As the utmost Hazard of dying of the ino∣culated Small Pox appears by the last authentic Ac∣counts, to be no more than that of <HI>1</HI> in <HI>50,</HI> and by the same Accounts, that of dying of the Natural is shewn to be that of <HI>1</HI> in <HI>6.</HI></Q>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>IN this Article our Author appears a Man of as great Fi∣gures, as in the first of Eloquence, and those Gentlemen and Townsmen that have not been perswaded into a good Opini∣on of Inoculation by 12 Lines of unanimated Oratory, are to be over-powered by a Demonstration of Numbers. Let us then suppose that there are 10,000 Persons in <HI>Bury,</HI> and but 3 of these have any Confidence in the Practice, there will remain 9997 clearly unsatisfied in Inoculation upon this Supposition. But since this Article is wrote to perswade the Wise, and deceive the Simple, and is the Basis of all the rest, I may be thought unseasonably Drolling, where I should be seriously Arguing.</P>
<P>THE strength and force of this Reason depends on the Truth of the Accounts, and what I have to say to their Au∣thenticness will be this; the Computations from the Tables are <HI>arithmetically</HI> True and Just, but as many Facts have been partially epresented, many material Circumstances, which made against the Practice, were then suppressed; as the moving De∣clarations of the dying Patients, and as some Miscarriages by Inoculation were never transmitted to the Calculator, all which I think can be made evident beyond Contradiction, in such Case the Accounts are so far from deserving an <HI>authentick</HI> Character, that they are mere Impositions. I say not this to asperse the Author of those Accounts, for if I understand who is meant, I honour his Learning and Judgment, and have a great Opinion of his Integrity, and believe he used an honest Diligence to state the Account right, but his Correspondents a disingenu∣ous Industry to deceive him. And here I must observe, that worthy Gentleman promised that he would acquaint the Pub∣lic with the Progress of this Practice from Year to Year, till it should be firmly established or justly exploded. But whether from a Discovery of the Suppressions on one side, or the Misre∣presentations on the other, he sound it impracticable to do it with impartiality; or from a general Discredit the Method of Inoculation soon fell into, he found it useless, I am not wil∣ling
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>to determine, but know of none he has publish'd for many Years past.</P>
<P>BUT for once I will suppose the Account authentic, and admit that every Fact was truly, exactly, and faithfully represented, and every individual Miscarriage was transmitted to the Cal∣culator at the juncture of Time when the Supputation was made; Yet surely our Author's Industry in getting fresh Intelli∣gence, or his Integrity in concealing what he received, or the little Acquaintance he has with Men of our Profession must be called in Question; because he takes no Notice of several un∣happy Families, some of whose Branches died miserable Sacri∣fices to this inhumane Practice, long since the Date of his au∣thentic Tables. To deny such Facts, so well attested is <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt,</HI> and to call them <HI>Forgeries</HI> is taking an unwarrantable Liberty with the Character of Witnesses, for which reason I shall for∣bear laying before him some authentic Original Papers on this Subject, transmitted to me by Persons of good Fashion, and of undoubted and unquestionable Credit, till such time as the Au∣thor shall creep out of his Ambuscade, and shall freely and openly declare upon what Issue he will put this Dispute. I can easily believe Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> gave our Author such a cautious An∣swer to his Query, and encouraged the Practice by Inoculating his own Child, and am as fully perswaded the Doctor was so Ingenuous as to tell him, how Tragically the Practice ended in another Family about that Time, where 2 out of 2, died by Inoculation, which were under his Care.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed; As I am willing to make our Author all possible Concessions, I will grant him that not only his Ac∣counts are truly Authentic, but that they have been carried down to the present Time, even to Yesterday, and that the Cal∣culation stands that only 1 in 50 have died by Inoculation. Happy those who have by such a lucky Chance, met at once their Death and end of all their Miseries▪ For are there not
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>many lamentable Spectacles just alive who have been Inocula∣ted, many dreadful Images of Death, Monuments of Terror to any that are capable of Fear? If this be the Case, I cannot but compassionate the Condition of even those that have survived the Operation, and <HI>what the Inoculators call,</HI> Recovered. But I shall consider this Point more hereafter, and now go on to the Accounts of the Fatality of the natural Infection. And here tho' I could lay down several Calculations made in different Parts, widely differing from our Author's <HI>last Accounts,</HI> yet as I am sensible how ready some Persons are to embrace all Oppor∣tunity of Cavil and Objection, and perhaps would insinuate that such distant Supputation cannot be rely'd on; To put the Matter out of Question, I have been at the Expence and Trouble to make a <HI>Local</HI> one, whereby it appeared that <HI>Jan.</HI> 28, 1683 Persons had had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> out of which Number 124 died, but as it evidently appears to me that many may, and ought to be deducted out of this Account of the deceas'd, I shall submit the following Particulars to our Author's and the Reader's Perusal and Consideration.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Probably died for want of proper Physic, Attendance, Sustenance, and even Cloath∣ing, notwithstanding the extraordinary <HI>Charity</HI> of some Gentlemen, and the great Care of the Magistrates, and Officers. 35</ITEM>
<ITEM>Abortives supposed to have died of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> because the Mother had it. 6</ITEM>
<ITEM>Supposed to have died of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> without having any Eruption. 3</ITEM>
<ITEM>Men and Women died of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> between 60 and 70. 5</ITEM>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<ITEM>Dy'd of the natural Sort, such as the Inoculators would not have practised upon, as appears by their Cautions, which see hereafter <HI>in Page</HI> 12. 30</ITEM>
<ITEM>In all 79</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IF this Reduction be allowed me, then the Proportion will be considerably altered, and that it may, and ought, is evident to any that will consider how few have died in Families where there was tolerable Care taken, and proper Medicines and Methods of Cure followed. I could indeed further convince our Author of Mis-calculation, when he says 1 in 6 died, but it must be in a Way most disagreeable to myself, for I should subject myself to the Imputation of Ostentation, when I tell him that out of the great Numbers which I have attended <HI>ab Origine,</HI> not 1 in 70 have died under my Care; but to make him amends for such supposed Vanity, I will inform him, that, under Provi∣dence, the Success lay in a previous Care, and such Rules of Ma∣nagement I gave to the Persons, which in a general Infection I supposed probably might soon receive it.</P>
<P>BUT to return; and make our Author farther Allowances, and totally reject this Reduction, yet after all 'twill not appear the Calculation stands good: but shall leave and request him to consider the Proportion between 124 and 1683. To this I am really at a loss to conceive what he will say, unless it be what he Per∣sonally insinuated to me, that many Errors and Mistakes were made by the Persons who took the Supputation, which put me to a second Trouble, to make a Review and Re-examination of the Matter, which was compared with the Church Books or Clerk's Accounts, and upon the Whole I sound the Diffe∣rences very immaterial; But to give our Author all possible Sa∣tisfaction, I will indulge him what Numbers he thinks reason∣able
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>for Mistakes, tho' I am not acquainted with one. Yet I cannot but observe that a very material Imposition was offered me from the <HI>House</HI> where this mighty Project was laid and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aily carried on, by a false Representation that Four had had it and Two died, whereas only One had it who recovered; What Motives could induce a Man of no great Sagacity or reach of Thought to give this Account, I shall not determine.</P>
<P>'TIS now high Time to dismiss this Article, I shall there∣fore only add, that supposing the Accounts with regard to the inoculated and natural Sort to be Authentic and <HI>True,</HI> yet our new Introducer of this Method lies under, in my Opinion, two insuperable Difficulties.</P>
<P N="1">1. THO' I grant him the Numbers given, yet be has not proved that this artificial Eruption is a preservative against a natural One, so that some who have submitted themselves to be practised upon by these <HI>Schematists</HI> may fall a Sacrifice to the providential Infection.</P>
<P N="2">2. I WILL fairly suppose that some Persons will never have the Small Pox. Now if the Inoculators should practise upon such a one, (and for ought they know they may) and the Patient die, and 'tis Presumption to say he shall not. What Name shall I give the Fact? What can be said to alleviate the Sorrows of the surviving Relations? That the Inoculators are Principals of, and the Friends Accessories to a <HI>horrid, wicked Act,</HI> is poor Con∣solation.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ART. II.P. 4.</HI></BIBL> It is to be observed that the inoculated Small Pox has been found to be as favourable to grown People as to Children.</Q>
<P>MONSTROUS is this Observation! How many of the Inocu∣lators shall I produce as Evidences to the Contrary? To stumble
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>at first setting out is certainly an ill Omen, and let him be careful that he makes no more false steps, least he Tumble down.</P>
<P>Is it not well known that the Operators were so Diffident of Success, that they chose Children as Objects of their Cruel∣ty, and whenever they ventured upon grown Persons, were they not curious in their Choice?</P>
<P>Is it not a secret Caution amongst 'em not to admit <HI>Women with Child.</HI> 2. <HI>Such to whose Families the Small Pox used to be fatal.</HI> 3. <HI>Such as are extremcly Fearful, Fanciful,</HI> Hy∣steric or Hypocondriac. 4. <HI>Such as are of choleric Constitutions, are apt to Fevers, inflammatory Affections, Plearisy, Erysipelas,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and such as have lately surfeited and over-heated themselves with</HI> Bacchus, <HI>or</HI> Venus, <HI>or great Labour.</HI> 5. <HI>Such as use to spit Blood or have over-much Catamenia.</HI> 6. <HI>Such as have a Phthisic, Consumption, Hectic-Fever,</HI> &amp;c. 7. <HI>Such as have the King's Evil, Gout:</HI> Or in Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s Words; <HI>To Inoculate none but Persons of good Habit of Body, and free not only from any Apparent, but as far as may be judged from any</HI> LATENT <HI>Disease?</HI></P>
<P>How many then of both Sexes by these Exemptions are discharged from the Danger, or not entitled to the Benefit of Inoculation, is an Inference obvious to every Reader; I would therefore (in Mr. <HI>Howgrave</HI>'s Words) ask these learned Mimicks of a few Ignorant <HI>Greek</HI> Women two Questions. 1. Whether Inoculation is not the most Gentle and safe Manner of hav∣ing the <HI>Small Pox;</HI> and 2dly, Whether a Person of a weak Constitution, or bad Habit of Body, be not as liable (if not more) to receive the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by Insection, as the most Healthful can be? The former Question they will answer in the Affirmative, and the Latter I am consident they cannot deny. If this be the Case, and Ino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lation be gentler and safer, weak
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>and disordered Persons ought of all others to be incoulated, as less able to bear the more hazardous Effects of the natural Sort.</P>
<P>THE next Observation, P. 5. shews the Author has not re∣covered his first Trip, but is still staggering on; for says he, it is also to be observed, <HI>all those who have not had the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>and resolve to continue in the Town, must almost certain∣ly</HI> have it now. I would willingly understand what is meant by that accurate Expression, All-<HI>must Almost certainly. Almost</HI> joined with <HI>must have it now,</HI> breaks the Necessity of some having it at all, if connected with <HI>certainly,</HI> weakens the Certi∣tude of it. But I stand not upon this Criticism, since as a <HI>Gram∣marian</HI> he may be right, yet that he is wrong in the Suppu∣tation will appear by the Account here given.</P>
<P>THE 3d Article, P. 5. is introduced with an astonishing Vio∣lence to all the Rules of Reason, and all the restraints of Truth, and closes with a single Instance of an uncommon Slaughter that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> made at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> For says he, <HI>A favour∣able Sort, produces a favourable Sort, a Malignant, a malig∣nant One;</HI> and then the Author with a magisterial Air, lays down a notorious false Assertion. <HI>This is certain in Inocula∣tion.</HI> Surprizing Confidence! 'Tis true indeed, the first Inocu∣lators did boast as much, yet the many Instances of the malig∣nant Sort from a distinct Sort, obliged them modestly to yield what they could not maintain.</P>
<P>I HAVE always thought that a malignant or a favourable Sort proceeded from the Disposition of the Blood and Tempera∣ment of the Person receiving the Contagion; if this wants Proof, the different Sorts which have been produced in many Families of this Town, shut up and excluded from the Com∣merce or Sight of any of the infected, is a Demonstration: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aver it upon my own Experience, I have observed, tho' some∣times
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>the first of a Family that fell down of the Distemper, had I will say, a malignant, confiuent Sort, the next the 2d, and 3d, who in all humane Probability received the poisonous In∣fection from this Person, had the Favourable and Distinct; and in the same Family, the 4th or 5th Patient should have the Malignant, and so <HI>vice versa,</HI> and therefore one Part of this Assertion, <HI>[viz.] very highly probable</HI> is false.</P>
<P>LET us examine the other, which with great Boldness is pronounced <HI>certain in Inoculation.</HI> Now I would ask this Author whether he thus roundly asserts this upon his own ex∣perience in the Method of Inoculation; if he avers this, I am not such an obstinate Enemy to this dangerous Method as to deny Fact: But if he has not his own Experience to support it, I may be allowed to tell him that the printed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> The Case of Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI>'s Servant, Mrs. <HI>Waller,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hugh</HI>'s Daughter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Relations of the unexspected Stubborness and Danger of this Distemper under the Inoculators Hands, are Convictions that the Author tramples upon the Rules of Modesty to support an ill Cause. If the famous Operators in this Method have not always had the Charm to raise a kind Sort from a mild one, but have frequently <HI>con∣jur'd</HI> up a malignant Sort which nothing but Death could <HI>bind.</HI> I would gladly know if this Gentleman has been taught this unfound Certainty in Inoculation by <HI>Inspiration,</HI> and has honestly conveyed all the Secret to his Operators altogether unskilled and unacquainted in this Practice; If so; I am not so hardy as to dispute (tho' we live in an Age not very sond of) <HI>Inspiration.</HI> But I expect proper Credentials, and till he pro∣duces 'em, shall call in Question his Veracity in the next Lines, as much as I disbelieve the Certainty of his Assertion now. For here the Experience of old Nurses will consute his Reasoning, and inform him that the <HI>Small Pox</HI> at its first <HI>coming into a Town is not always favourable, and as it spreads grows
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>more Malignant;</HI> and indeed at this very Time, <HI>viz. Febr.</HI> 20. 'tis notoriously otherwise. For they have Sense enough to know, tho' few at its first Invasion die of the Distemper, and a great many die when it has continued long, this is owing not to an encrease of a malignant Sort, but to the Number of People taking the Infection at one time greater than the other. And thus every old Woman by her Remarks and Methods of telling by her Fingers, is ready to say the Author's Arithmetick which comes next, amounts to o. o. o.</P>
<P>I MUST follow him then thro' the By-Roads he takes to <HI>Uxbridge</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> where I stop to lament the Loss of so many People who died of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in a natural Way; and tell him that to draw an universal Inference from a particu∣lar Instance, is very illogical, and unscholarlike.</P>
<P>ART. IV. P. 6. The last Reason, <HI>viz. the general Good of Mankind,</HI> must if well supported, bring Inoculation into Repute and Practice, and be with great Readiness embraced by those who have not divested themselves of all Humanity and Bene∣volence. But our Author leaves the most Prevailing of his Reasons, if true, to stand by, and shift for its self, for he gives it no enforcement; unless Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s Calculation is a Support to it, but having already under the second Reason shewn the In-equality of that Supputation with our Own, I shall add no more; but wish our Author had.</P>
<P>YET I would under this Article say, that if Inoculation was thought so great a Preservative to Mankind, We of the Pro∣fession might in 10 or 12 Years, have study'd the safe practical Part of it, and brought it to a greater Perfection then at present is appears in, and kept it up in greater Honour then it now maintains amongst Us. But since there is such Uncertainty and Insecurity in, and such a general Aversion of the People to the Operation, I am ready to believe the Inhabitants of <HI>Bury</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>will choose to resign themselves into the Hands of Providence, rather than to submit to be practised upon, in a dangerous, painful Manner by inexpert Operators.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Bark, Opium,</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> have met with Opposi∣tion I own, but have made their Way thro' the Indignation and Contempt of their Enemies, because upon experience they have been proved useful Parts of the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> these with∣out question in some Hands are very fase, and very effectual Medi∣cines, but by Mis-application have proved very dangerous and destructive Ones, and yet he must be very Weak that Condemns the use of these and many other Medicaments, because some <HI>Em∣piricks</HI> thro' <HI>Interest, Dishonesty, Ignorance or Folly,</HI> have wit∣tingly or designedly given them improperly. But the Prac∣tice of Inoculation is justly condemned, because it is found to be unsuccessful, insecure, and not to answer the Intention.</P>
<P>AND now I proceed to Objection the 1. P. 7.</P>
<P><HI>WE are not certain that Inoculation is a Security from having the Distemper again.</HI> But before I examine our Au∣thor's Solutions of this Objection to Inoculation, give me leave to say, if I condemn'd his Judgment in the Choice of his Rea∣sons in Defence of the Practice; I will for once venture to com∣mend his Skill in picking out such Objections, which he ima∣gined he could answer, and passing over many more because he could not. For <HI>some Reasons</HI> I beg he would be pleased to accept of some more Objections, I will not be unmerciful, but at present lay before him only these. 1. Our Climate and our Blood not so proper to an Operation invented and practised in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> 2. No Criterion is found to know the Disposition of the Blood, to receive most advantageously the purulent Mat∣ter to be inoculated. 3. No Proportion of the contagious Matter is agreed on by the Inoculators to do the Work safely. When these shall be answer'd, I will ask him a Question, <HI>viz.</HI> What
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>is the Consequence in that Constitution, where Inoculation pro∣duces only an imperfect Sort, or <HI>(as they artifully express it)</HI> has no Effect?</P>
<P>I WILL now consider his Answer. <HI>Several Persons who have been Inoculated, have been made to converse with, to handle, nurse, lie in the same Bed with others sick of the natural</HI> Pox, <HI>and no one ever had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn.</HI> To give Force to this An∣swer the Author slily supposes, the inoculating Method has produced a true genuine <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and as a Proof of it, says, all Patients by the Means of receiving the Infection he mentions, <HI>never had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn.</HI> I will not now enter into a Dispute, whether a true <HI>Small Pox</HI> is <HI>ever</HI> brought out by Inoculation, or lay before him well attested Histories of Persons <HI>Inoculated,</HI> and some Time after, falling down of a <HI>natural Small Pox,</HI> since in his second Answer I find all these must go for <HI>Forgeries.</HI> But will tell him a Performance of all these kind Offices, which some Parents from an innate Affection to their Children have undertaken, others from a Notion of catching a kind Sort have Industriously ventured on, some from a Necessity of their Condition at∣tending the Sick in those Offices of Humanity, and escaping the Infection then, have Years after received the contagious Distemper. There are some in this Town who 21 Years past, when it was visited with this Distemper stood clear of this Dis∣case, under such Tryals, but have now had it. So that upon parity of Reason this Part of his Answer is not sound, for tho' the inoculated Patients have for some time stood the Test, yet they may hereafter fall, and for ought they know very soon into the natural <HI>Small Pox.</HI> And I am not without a Rationale of this Observation, which will further evidence the Weakness of our Author's Answer, and confirm the Strength of mine. There is generally agreed to be an occult Disposition or Semi∣nium in the Blood to receive the <HI>Labes</HI> of this Disease, which
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>may be so entangled in its <HI>Sinus,</HI> and may be under such a singular Combination of Texture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to resist the contagious Effluvia at one time, and at another may be fusceptible of them. 2d Answer. <HI>Several Stories that have been invented to per∣swade the World of the Contrary, have been detected, and shewn to be Forgeries.</HI> If my Reader is as hard of Belief, as our Author, in Histories well supported, which both of them may meet with in those Tracts wrote 1722, 1723, and in many more since, I must leave them entrenched in their Infidelity and consider his 3d An∣swer. <HI>As the inoculated</HI> Small Pox <HI>is in</HI> EVERY MINUTE <HI>Cir∣cumstance</HI> EXACTLY <HI>like the natural One.</HI> It would be very extraordinary — <HI>if it should not be like in this.</HI> This is an Assertion so shocking, because egregiously false, that I have not Temper and Patience to speak to it, but will venture to leave his own Practice, if he will allow proper Judges, as he ought to confute it, and am Confident 'tis not only Anomalous in <HI>some,</HI> but almost in <HI>every</HI> Circumstance. Under this Head he adds. <HI>Whatever be the Reason why the Natural</HI> Small Pox <HI>pre∣serves us from Infection, it is inconceiveable that the Inocu∣lated should not do the same, for the same Reason.</HI> I will kindly offer him two or three Conjectures, which I lay no great Weight upon. 1. That we take this Distemper in a natural Way is most generally agreed, from infected Particles in the Air, and conveyed to the Lungs by Inspiration; and then possibly the Vesiculae of the Lungs may undergo such a Mutation and Alteration in their Contexture, as ever after to be unsuscep∣tible of the variolous Infection; but a Transfusion of this Ve∣nom into the Arms and Legs, will not by its Fermentation be any Preservative at all. 2. If there be a necessary Concurrence and Association of the Texture, Shape, Order, and Magnitude of the Blood required to receive the Infection, this may in the Course of Nature meet once and never again; But this Conjunction of Circumstances being entirely unknown to us Mortals, must leave the Inoculators in the Dark, and their Art insecute. 3. The Alteration made in the Skin by the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> that is, the Dis∣tention
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>of the miliary Glands and Pores, Dr. <HI>Drake</HI> con∣ceives to be the true Reason why that Distemper never comes a second Time; And Dr. <HI>Pitcairne</HI> has observed, that those that have taken much <HI>Mercury</HI> which dilates those Pores, are not so susceptible of a Fever, for tho' the same feverish Dispo∣sition should, and may arise in the Instances of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> or after much <HI>Mercury</HI> taken, yet the Passages thro' the Skin being more free and open, the Matter will never be so stop'd as to raise the usual Symptoms in either Case.</P>
<P>BUT that this cannot be the Case after Inoculation, is certain both in Reason and Fact, for the very Practicers of it have been obliged to confess and acknowledge that their Method has sometimes only produced an <HI>ingenuine or imperfect</HI> Small Pox, and have express'dly granted (because several Instances have prov'd) that such <HI>artificial</HI> Ingraftment was not preventive of of a second natural Crop; and 'tis farther evident as Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> observes, that the Seeds of the Disease are not al∣ways carried off with those Impurities, which are discharged by Inoculation: but that those false Eruptions may be wholly un∣mixt and unconcern'd with the Principles of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> since they alike follow upon Inoculation, whether the Person has ever had, or had not that Distemper before. I should now proceed to the 2d Objection, yet cannot but first observe our Author's artful Insinuation, that it has been the <HI>Opinion of some</HI> (I suppose he means old Women) <HI>that the natural</HI> Small Pox <HI>was not an absolute Security against it a second Time,</HI> and then thank him that he owns this so <HI>rarely happens as not to deserve Notice.</HI> A very pretty, modest Confession! but let me tell him that I hereby call upon him to produce an Instance or two of this, under some <HI>regular Physician</HI>'s <HI>Hand</HI> within <HI>these</HI> twelve Years, the Time Inoculation has been practis'd amongst us, and in return by way of Compliment, promise him for every such single Case well attested, to give him seve∣ral, where the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> has came on, after the Inocu∣lators
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>had roundly asserted all possible Security against it, and when I have made good this Engagement and produced some plain Histories, I shall humbly beg our Author to inform me how stands the <HI>Proportion.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW proceed to the 2d Objection, which is, <HI>That the ino∣culated</HI> Small Pox <HI>often leaves bad Consequences, as Consump∣tions, Boils, and Blotches, weak Eyes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHOEVER is acquainted with the Rules of Controversy (a State of Life, few that have regard to themselves would be brought into, but many that have a concern for others may) will own how unfair that Disputant is, who does not put the Objections against him in the strongest Light, let the Event of the Dispute be what it will. Had this Objection, now to be considered, been fairly proposed, I am willing to believe, we might have recol∣lected the <HI>Fable</HI> of the Viper and the File, but rather than not answer all Difficulties, because some are insolvable, many are to be stifled. In this manner our Inocularian cowardly suppresses a Catalogue of Maladies which are the Consequences of Inocula∣tion, but not of the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and undauntedly men∣tions those which are the Consequences of both. However, I shall beg leave to enforce this Objection, by giving an Explana∣tion, and Interpretation of the Authors <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and adding to what he has mentioned, CONTRACTED LIMBS, HEMEPLEGIES, PERPETUAL CEPHELALGIES, PHRENSIES, FATAL MORTIFICATIONS.</P>
<P>HAS the Power of Prepossession in favour of this Method barr'd up all the Avenues to our Author's Mind, that Truth shall be hindred admittance? Or are the Mistakes of this An∣swer owing to an excusable Ignorance, or unpardonable Inad∣vertency? For to say that the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> is apt to leave <HI>the same sort</HI> of ill Consequences is a mistake I am positive, but under <HI>which sort</HI> to place the Rise of it. I am really at a Loss, I had rather our Author should chuse. But if he will still in∣sist
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>on <HI>the same sort of ill Consequences,</HI> which he acknow∣ledges <HI>there</HI> are Methods which will <HI>for the most Part entire∣ly prevent or remedy, and always do it in some Degree.</HI> I must expect of him to point me out some Cases from the na∣tural Sort, so formidable and so stubborn, that the Care and Skill of the most eminent Physicians and Chirurgeons, have been so far baffled and prov'd ineffectual, that they have not <HI>in any Degree</HI> been meliorated by Art; for with many of these I take upon me to charge Inoculation, and <HI>at a proper Time</HI> will produce my Vouchers, and if so, the <HI>Force of the Objec∣tion</HI> is beyond his reach of Refuting. I will grant indeed our Author that the Disorders attending the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> principally (but not altogether) depend on a Resorbition of the putrid Matter into the Vessels upon the Declension of the Dis∣ease; but in the unnatural Kind, the Case is quite otherwise, for in this, all the dismal Train of Maladies, derive their source and origine from Nature's Inability, to throw out the venemous, malignant Matter, or in a proper Degree to depu∣rate the Blood from the Poison which has been implanted; and I am firmly of Opinion, that Mr. <HI>Howgrave</HI>'s Observation is just, that these Disorders are the Effects of the <HI>very Operators</HI> Preparations, which are by <HI>Purging and Bleeding;</HI> for what is proposed by <HI>Purging,</HI> if the Patient to be inoculated <HI>be not only free</HI> from any APPARENT but even any LATENT Disease; and if these are the only Persons to be inoculated, which has been shewn, Where is the necessity of Physic or Physician? We know not when, or where the Patient is afflicted but by Symptoms, and if none of these offer themselves, we must con∣clude the Body is in a good State, and if any Person be of such a Habit of Body as to require these Preparations, then by their own Account, he is not a fit Subject for Inoculation. And as to <HI>Bleeding</HI> 'tis not only not necessary, but MUST ALLMOST CERTAINLY be prejudicial, especially when the very cold Re∣gimen is rigorously enjoyn'd, because by these the Crasis of the Blood may be so weakned, as to render it incapable of
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>throwing off the corrosive Matter, which Inoculation has for∣ced into it. 'Tis true indeed, in the natural Sort these and o∣ther preparative Methods, may, and frequently ought to be advised, for in this Case there will be no Danger, but that Na∣ture of herself, or when properly assisted, will effectually re∣ject whatever is offensive to her. Notwithstanding what has been said, I will upon second Thoughts grant our Author that <HI>Preparation</HI> before the Operation, <HI>Attendance of a Physician, during the Distemper,</HI> and <HI>Care afterwards,</HI> may be very pro∣per— <HI>if the Patient can pay well for it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to be serious and return to our Author who, as I before observed, has a magisterial Way of laying down Positions un∣supported, but must here remark a Method more soft but not less affronting to his Reader, when he would <HI>smoothly</HI> lead him into two Mistakes thus: <HI>One would naturally think therefore that where the most corrupted Matter of the worst Kind is returned into the Blood, there the Disorders succeeding the</HI> Small Pox <HI>should be most and worst.</HI> And again, P. 11. <HI>It is inconceivable how a Quantity of corrupted Matter falling into the Body, should be the occasion of the Disorders succeed∣ing the</HI> Small Pox, — and <HI>yet the inoculated</HI> Small Pox <HI>where there is less of the Matter, and of a more kindly Nature be attended with worse Consequences.</HI> Here are two Things ta∣ken for granted which I can by no means allow. 1. That a greater Quantity of the infectious Matter is received Naturally. And 2dly, That 'tis of a more malign Nature than what is re∣ceived by Inoculation. Is there any Argument to make either of these good? Is there any Reasoning to evince the Truth of 'em? No; 'tis enough, <HI>Ipse Dixit,</HI> and we must submit to his superiour Judgment, and implicitly swallow down his <HI>Compo∣sition.</HI> But with his Leave let me consider the Nature of the Malignity of the Infection. Is our Author unacquainted with some Poisons which when communicated to the Blood imme∣diately prove fatal, but when received into the Stomach and
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>so digested, are innocent and inoffensive? May not the Viru∣lence of the contagious Effluvia of the sick and infected Things be newly modify'd by the Air, and many of the venomous <HI>Spicula,</HI> broke and blunted in their Passage? Whereas the Acri∣mony of gross Matter from a Pustle is no ways sheath'd or ob∣tunded by the Inocularian Conveyance. But when our Author <HI>personates</HI> a Physician, I have never been surpriz'd to find him talking very erroneously concerning the Quality of Diseases and Remedies, but as a <HI>Geometrican</HI> I really always expected to have him very exact in any Consideration of Quantities and Divisibility of Matter. Let our Author then meditate a little upon the Difference between GROSS MATTER and EFFLU∣VIA, and if he be at a Loss after such Reflection, I wou'd refer him to Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> who will inform him that several Bo∣dies are sound to emit Effluvia for a great Number of Years, as Magnets, Electrical Bodies, Ambers, divers Odorous Bodies, the Tenuity of whose emanant Corpuscles are so incredibly small that they perceptibly lose neither Bulk or Weight.—Or let him consult some <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who will inform him how a Tun of Sack is poison'd and made an Emetick by a small Quan∣tity of <HI>Crocus Metallorum,</HI> or by the <HI>Antimonial Cup,</HI> with∣out dimunition of its Quantity or Quality: And if these will not give him Satisfaction, I cou'd tell him of a worthy Fami∣ly in the Neighbourhood which has for many Years been pos∣sess'd of an Indian Stone, which immerg'd in Water, will make a generous Cordial, and in less than a Minutes Time; and this without any apparent Abatement of Substance or Quality. Now if this be the Case, and the Difference between gross Mat∣ter and Effluvia be so wide, one single Pustule may contain Particles sufficient to insect 10000 Persons in the Natural Way.</P>
<P>I SHALL add no more, but conclude this Reply to our Au∣thor with informing him, since he seems to have so little Ac∣quaintance with Men of our Profession, that so many Remark∣able and Notorious Facts have supported the Force of this Ob∣jection,
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>that the most Learned and Judicious Practicers of Physick and Surgery, both <HI>at Home and Abroad,</HI> have totally discredited and rejected this Operation.</P>
<P>Obj. 3. P. 13. <HI>By Inoculation we may communicate other Distempers.</HI> Whether I was in the right when I commended our Author's Skill in choosing Objections against Inoculation, because he thought he cou'd answer them, I know not, but am certain this Objection is founded upon solid Reason; sup∣ported by Experience, and is so formidable to the Practice, that if our Introducer of this <HI>Mankind-Self-serving</HI> Project does not clearly answer it, I am fully perswaded he will be disappointed of his first View injudiciously open'd to his Read∣ers in his last Words, because it leaves them with Impressions unfavourable to the Writer. If other Distempers may be com∣municated and the Small Pox may not, as <HI>some Inoculators honestly own,</HI> that such a Miscarriage sometimes arises; I question whether our Inoculator stands the <HI>Chance</HI> of <HI>being regarded</HI> by 1 <HI>in</HI> 50, <HI>perhaps</HI> 60, 80, 100, 1000, or even more of the Inhabitants of <HI>Bury</HI> for an Enterprize so hazardous to their Lives.</P>
<P>I shall therefore particularly examine how he answers in the way of <HI>his Profession</HI> this stubborn Objection.</P>
<P>MOST <HI>chronical Distempers,</HI> says our exact NUMERIST, <HI>are chiefly owing to the irregular make of the Vessels thro' which the Blood and Juices pass.</HI> Had he said SOME FEW I had a∣greed with him. But since so many chronical Distempers de∣rive their Sources from the Viscidity, Fermentation, Raresac∣tion, or Condensation of the Juices and their constituent Parts, the Motion and Circulation of which are often stopped and im∣peded, when they are not well comminuted by Concoction: since many more are entirely owing to too great an Increase of sharp and acrimonious Salts, which intermixing with the
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>Fluids, leave in them such a corrosive Quality, as instead of filtrating thro' the Glands, break thro', or wear them up. Since then so many chronical Distempers take their Origine from other Causes, I cannot accede to our Author's Assertion. Nay, he is so diffident and distrustful of the Truth of his own Sentiments, that soon after he acknowledges <HI>there are several Distempers which may be communicated by Methods no ways consistent with this Account.</HI> I shall leave therefore the further Examination of this Assertion, which indeed has no Force here, and had better have been omitted, since if our Calculator is wrong in his Account as he most egregiously is, the Position betrays at the same Time his want of Judgment, in the Nature and Cause of chronical Distempers, and the Me∣thod of palliating or curing them. But this puts me in mind of an Observation of the great <HI>Baglivi,</HI> who if I remember right somewhere says; <Q>"In my Judgment, Mathematicks, Rhe∣torick, Arithmetic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are as serviceable to an accurate Hi∣story of Diseases, as the Art of Painting is to a Musician."</Q></P>
<P>BUT to follow our Author who goes on thus: <HI>Now if this was the Case of all, it would be as just to affirm, that Inocu∣lation could communicate the Features of another Man's Face, as communicate other Distempers.</HI> I must own this is to me an unintelligible Consequence drawn from the Author's own Pre∣misses, but as they are innocent, harmless Words, and <HI>communi∣cate</HI> no force to his Answer, and do no hurt to the Objection, I suffer them to stand in their Place, or to CIRCULATE <HI>with the Milk thro' the Body of a Nurse.</HI> But I call myself off from breaking such Bubbles, and plead in my Defence, 'tis none of my Fault, if some Authors Write so Triflingly, that they are not to be solidly refuted.</P>
<P>YET since I said this Objection was built upon solid Reason, and supported by Experience, I think myself obliged to prove
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>the Possibility, Probability, and Certainty of communicating of other Distempers by Inoculation of the <HI>Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT is generally allowed that the Stamina or Principles of some dangerous Diseases, such as Madness, Leprosy, Kings-Evil, Consumptions, <HI>Lues Venerea, &amp;c.</HI> are by an hereditary Right entailed upon some Families for some Time.</P>
<P N="2">2. These Principles compounded and sormed in the Constitu∣tions of some Persons, are of a size so exiguous, as to be imper∣ceptible even to the most Eagle-ey'd Chirurgeon, and of a Na∣ture so quiet and dormant as not to enter upon Action, unless by some adventitious Cause roused up.</P>
<P N="3">3. A VARIOLOUS FEVER by a violent and extraordinary Fermen∣tation of the whole Mass of Blood, rouses these Seeds, and they mix with those of the <HI>Small Pox:</HI> and a Pustule taken from such a Person, who has the Seeds of any of these Diseases, may as well convey the Principles of such Diseases, as of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> into another clear of them before.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN thus conveyed they have a Power in the minutest Size to convert a large Mass of Liquids into their noxious Na∣ture, and by this Assimilation ruin the Crasis of the Blood, and in progress of Time produce a homogeneous Disease.</P>
<P>THAT I am not singular in allowing such <HI>Semina</HI> and Agen∣cy of 'em to corrupt the Blood and Humours, and by Degrees bring them into such a state of Assimilation as may cause a Distemper of the same Family to break out, will be clear to those who have read the mechanical Account of Poison, wrote by the judicious and learned Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> in which Treatise he several Times, and various Ways confirms and establishes this Notion, Particularly p. 84. <Q>"What is thrown out from Liquors in a Ferment is capable of inducing the like Motion in another
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>Liquor of the same Kind, when duly mixt with it".</Q> Again, <Q>"A Person thus affected <HI>(viz. by a mad Dog)</HI> may be said in a Degree to have put on the canine Nature, tho' his Reason be all this time untouch'd and entire, may Bite, Howl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because the like violent Agitation of the Blood in him as was in the Dog, will present like Species, and consequently (so far as their different Natures will allow) produce like Ac∣tions, <HI>&amp;c</HI>".</Q></P>
<P>I WILL only add another Quotation, from an Author who is as great an Ornament of our Profession in the <HI>French</HI> Nation, as the Last is in our <HI>own, [viz.] Helvetius,</HI> who expressly says in his <HI>Essay on the Animal Oeconomy,</HI> P. 132. <Q>"When the Blood abounds with Humours of different Qualities, which are likewise dissolved along with the variolous Humours, the Disease in that Case cannot be Simple, but must be compli∣cated".</Q> From these Authorities it appears that the Depo∣sita of some bad Disease may incorporate with the purulent Matter of a Pustule, and the Pustule being a Composition of variolous Poyson and of these Seeds, may <HI>possibly</HI> and <HI>probably</HI> communicate a Chaos of Diseases.</P>
<P>BUT Possibilities and Probabilities are Bugbears and may fright Children, but not move a wise Man; For <HI>the infectious Matter</HI> (says our Author) <HI>according to Experience appears to communi∣cate nothing but what it was intended to communicate, the Small Pox.</HI> Now this is another unsupported Assertion against Fact, and <HI>must be tried</HI> by Experience, which shews a CERTAINTY of such complicated Communication, and as a Proof shall <HI>at present</HI> only beg his Review of the printed Relations, and particular∣ly Miss <HI>Rolt</HI>'s and Lord <HI>Percival</HI>'s Son's Case, both of which in a lingering Disease miserably lived <HI>and at last</HI> died Victims to this barbarous Practice; but <HI>hereafter</HI> if our Author shall think fit to undertake a general History of the Success of Ino∣culation
<PB N="28" REF="26"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iseto give him my Sentiments of the Perfor∣man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> further Sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>faction I can on this Subject.</P>
<P>I GO on with our Author who generally at the beginning of an Article seems to <HI>triumph be it only for a Flourish</HI> in a <HI>line or two</HI> but at the Close supposes <HI>all that has hitherto been advanced may be set aside,</HI> and is by my Consent. But his forsorn Hope being cut off, we must depend upon Porters, Ploughmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>here we have a moral Certainty, that these have sound and healthy Constitutions.</HI> These indeed <HI>can∣not</HI> be Leprous, Scabious, Scorbutick, Rheumatick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these <HI>cannot</HI> be subject to any LATENT Disease; so that from these, all Gentlemen may be inoculated very safely without any Com∣munication of any other Distemper, and the Ladies have no rea∣son to fear a Communication of Features, <HI>because it would be as just to affirm that Inoculation could communicate the Features of another Man's Face, as communicate other Distempers.</HI> But I will farther add, and oblige our Author with another neces∣sary Caution in the Practice of Inoculation, which perhaps he never heard of before, and tell him that <HI>it is the Opinion of some,</HI> that even the vicious Inclination of a Nurse may by the Milk be communicated to her suckling Infant; if so, methinks he should be very careful and inquisitive into the moral Dispo∣sition of the Person from whom the Matter is taken, for o∣therwise he may imprudently bring an Honest Man to the Gallows, and make a Modest Virgin a Brazen Prostitute; but <HI>this perhaps will so rarely happen, as not to deserve Notice.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE now given a short Answer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>Some Reasons,</HI> &amp;c. If my Friends have expected it sooner, or wish'd for a Longer, I must tell a plain and undisguised Truth, I had neither Inclination for the one, nor Time for the o∣ther; and in those Hours I sat down to write, I have been so frequently interrupted, that it is more my Wonder that I
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>have finish'd so soon, than that the Impatience of my Ac∣quaintance shou'd make them think I delay'd too long. But I hope I have said enough to discourage a Practice insecure of its Intention, often pernicious in its Conse∣quences, frequently fatal in its Event, to those who volun∣tarily and freely submit to it; and surely neither Perswa∣sion or Compulsion should be used when Health and Life are the Stakes. It must undoubtedly therefore lay all those who are by fine PROMISES drawn into it, or by inhumane THREATS forc'd into it, under unrequitable Obligations to the Projector.</P>
<P>IF OTHERS can calmly see a detestable Method discre∣dited every where else, introduced amongst their Friends and Acquaintance; I must own I could not be Passive and Silent and with coolness of Temper see it; I could not even forsee their Miseries without Horrour, and thought myself obliged by the Ties of Humanity and Friendship, to do my utmost to prevent them. This was the sole Motive of my Writing this Answer, and if I am so happy as to stop a most dangerous Scheme, the Pleasure of doing good is Reward great enough for me. And since our Author in his last Line without any Hypocrisy owns an ambitious View of being <HI>regarded,</HI> I with∣out Envy wish he may meet with as much regard, as his Mo∣desty joined with his Merit may justly claim.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>I Had determined not to Publish any Letters from my own private Correspondents, or Re-print any from the Tracts <HI>at present,</HI> but to fill up an empty Page, have subjoined the fol∣lowing Moving one from Mrs. <HI>Rolt,</HI> a Lady of good Sense and Fashion.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>A Letter from Mrs.</HI> Rolt. <HI>Dated</HI> September, 16, 1724.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I determin'd by my Friend's Perswasion to have my Daughter inoculated, I sent for Mr. <HI>A—d,</HI> he as'k but few questions about her, but I told him she had the <HI>Jaundice</HI> about a Year before, and some Months after a small relapse into it, that from that time she had been very well, till she had the <HI>Measles</HI> about two Months before, and getting soon well of it, had been ever since with a Relation at <HI>Epsome.</HI> He declar'd himself very well satisfied with her State of Health, and tho' I propos'd having a Physician to attend her, ask'd him whe∣ther there was not to be some Preparation, and particularly mention'd, cutting off her Hair; he said there was no occasion for any thing I had offered, that the Child would be so well all the Course of the Disease, that she would play about the Room the whole Time.</P>
<P>About five or six Days after the Inoculation, she was seiz∣ed with great Pains in all her Joints. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> came out about the 10<SUP>th</SUP> or 11<SUP>th</SUP> Day very violently, and was what
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>they call the <HI>flux</HI> Sort; upon which I propos'd again a Phy∣sician, Mr. <HI>A—d</HI> upon it nam'd one he had a mind, which I consented to, soon after another was call'd, who he said un∣derstood Inoculation: soon after their Bleeding her, there ap∣peared a swelling upon one of her Elbows, upon which I was very much flatter'd, that it was a mark she would do well, as I was often in the course of her Illness. In nine Weeks after the In∣oculation, and after the most miserable Suffering, that ever poor Creature underwent, she died worn to nothing but Skin and Bone. She had <HI>six and thirty running Sores (none of them having ever been heal'd)</HI> when she died; and they were forced to roll up her <HI>Joints in Past-board,</HI> least the Joints should fall out of their Places.</P>
<P>I am very sensible of the Reports which have been spread a∣bout her, <HI>[viz.]</HI> that she was eat up of the Kings-evil, that she had had the Black-Jaundice, and that she was not well cured of that, nor of the <HI>Measles.</HI> The Contrary of which, was af∣firm'd to me by those who had the Care of her in those Illnes∣ses, and as to the King's-evil it never happen'd, either to Mr. <HI>Rolt</HI>'s or my Family, nor was it ever suspected by the <HI>Physici∣ans</HI> who had treated her. And Mr. <HI>A—d</HI> himself as I said be∣fore, allowed her to be in a very good Condition, and fit for the Operation even without the help, either of a <HI>Physician,</HI> or any Preparation.</P>
<P>After this it is very extraordinary to have such Reports spread; and particularly that <HI>any Man</HI> should talk in Print <HI>of the irre∣gular Life of a Child of nine Years old;</HI> for near two Years before the <HI>Measles,</HI> she had been at Mr. <HI>Caverlas</HI> School, which is allow'd to be one of the best govern'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I could say much more upon this Subject, but as every par∣ticular of this is <HI>Fact,</HI> the World may see by it the <HI>Humanity</HI> of having such a <HI>Misfortune</HI> aggravated, by the very <HI>People,</HI> who at least should shew some Repentance, for the Misery they brought upon an afflicted Mother.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>As this Letter is wrote within the Confinements of Truth, and with the Accents of Sorrow, I may leave it without any Reflection. Every Man of Sense from this Case will observe a Communication of Diseases by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> POSSIBLE, PRO∣BABLE, and CERTAIN. And every affectionate fond Mo∣ther and tender Virgin may from this doleful Instance see the Mercies of Inoculation are Cruel, and dread a Practice of an In∣fluence so malignant, as may render the Lives of them and theirs miserable, and their Bodies an Hospital of putrid Sores, and incurable Distempers.</P>
