<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE SURGEONS <HI>of</HI> London.</HEAD>
<P>THE Barbers of the City of <HI>London</HI> were incorporated by King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Edw. IV. 1461.</NOTE> in order to promote and improve the Science and Faculty of Surgery, upon Consideration of the many pub∣lick Mischiefs which had arisen from the Ignorance and Unskil∣fulness of Persons practising that Art.</P>
<P>To remedy such Evils for the Time to come, which the Charter recites to have been owing to the Want of a proper Oversight, Correction, and Punishment of such as were not sufficiently skilled in the Faculty of Sur∣gery, the Mystery and Commonalty of Barbers were created a Body Cor∣porate, with Power to make proper Statutes and Ordinances for their good Government.</P>
<P>And the Masters and Governors of that Company were to have the Oversight, Correction, and Government of all Persons using the Mystery of Surgeons, within the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Suburbs thereof; and the Punishment of them, for their Offences, in improperly exercising and practising their Art; and likewise the Oversight and Inspection of all Instruments, Plaisters, and other Medicines, by them used.</P>
<P>And, in order to attain the End of their Institution, no Persons what∣soever were to be admitted or received into their Company, except Per∣sons sufficiently skilled and instructed in the Art of Surgery.</P>
<P>This Charter was afterwards confirmed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, in the 15th Year of his Reign, and by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, in the 2d Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>In the 32d Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, when Persons of better Educa∣tion, and greater Abilities, began to apply themselves to the Study and Practice of Surgery, the Legislature thought proper to unite this Com∣pany, which were still all Surgeons, and, by the Terms of their Charter, could be composed of no other Persons, with another Body of Men, likewise practising Surgery, but not incorporated.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>The Act recites, That there then were, within the City of <HI>London,</HI> Two several and distinct Companies of Surgeons, occupying and exercising the Science and Faculty of Surgery; the one Company called <HI>The Bar∣bers of</HI> London, the other called <HI>The Surgeons of</HI> London.</P>
<P>And the End proposed by the Legislature in uniting these Two distinct Companies of Surgeons, and making them One Body Corporate, is de∣clared to be, That, by their Union and frequent Assembly together, the good and due Order, Exercise, and Knowledge in the Science and Fa∣culty of Surgery, should be, as well in Speculation as in Practice, obtained, both to themselves and their Apprentices.</P>
<P>The Legislature then thought proper likewise to Enact, for particular Reasons mentioned in the Act, That, for the future, the same Persons should not practise both as Surgeons and Barbers, but that, from thence∣forth, they should be separated Professions.</P>
<P>The Surgeons having, since the Making of that Act, been more libe∣rally and regularly educated, have directed and applied their whole Study and Attention towards the Advancement and Improvement of their Art.</P>
<P>The Barbers have ever since been engaged in a different Way of Business, altogether foreign to the Practice of Surgery.</P>
<P>It is evident therefore, that neither the Ends, which the Crown had in view at the original Incorporation of this Company, or those which were afterwards proposed to be attained by the Legislature, can be an∣swered by their continuing united in the same Body.</P>
<P>As the sole End of their Incorporation was, that they should oversee and superintend the Practice of Surgery; and as the Legislature pro∣posed, that, by their Meeting and Assembly together, the Science of Surgery should be promoted, as well in Speculation as in Practice; it is plain, that their whole Union and Meeting with the Barbers, if it were no Obstacle, cannot in the least be any Ways conducive towards attain∣ing those Ends.</P>
<P>But, if the Surgeons were incorporated, as a distinct Body, by them∣selves, they would not then be deprived of the Help and Assistance of many ingenious Practisers of their Profession, who, at present, decline being Members of a Company, the Majority of which, being Strangers to their Art, cannot be supposed to have in their Views the Advance∣ment and Improvement of it.</P>
<P>The Majority of Persons practising Surgery, would not then be dis∣couraged and prevented, as they now are, from being Members of the Company, by the Inconveniencies and Expences which necessarily attend the Execution of the several Offices of the present Company, which have no Relation to the Improvement and Profession of Surgery; by which
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"/>Means, those who practise Surgery are again divided, contrary to the Intention of the Legislature: The Number of these, at present, who are not Members of the Company, being almost double the Number of those who are.</P>
<P>The Publick Lectures, Examinations of Surgeons, and other Assem∣blies, instituted for the Advancement of Surgery, would not then meet with any Interruption from Persons, only Barbers, insisting, as they now do, that they shall always be present at such Meetings.</P>
<P>Since therefore, there are distinct and peculiar Privileges and Powers lodged with the Surgeons, which the Barbers ought neither to take Part or Trouble in; particularly that important Trust, of examining Surgeons for the Royal Navy, which they have duly executed with the greatest Chearfulness, to the great Advantage, as they hope, of the Publick:</P>
<P>And, as the desired Separation is founded upon Reasons of general and publick Utility;</P>
<P>The Surgeons of <HI>London</HI> humbly pray, To be separated from the Barbers, as those of other Countries have been, each to be made an inde∣pendent Corporation, and vested with the same Privileges which they now enjoy under their present Charters.</P>
<P>And, as all the Members of the present Company have an equal Interest in the Property belonging to the said Company; and the original Members, who first acquired that Property, could only be Persons skilled in Surgery (those, practising as Barbers only, not having been Members of this Company till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth); they hope, That an equitable and proportionable Division and Distribution of their Property shall be made, in such Manner as the Legislature shall think fit.</P>
