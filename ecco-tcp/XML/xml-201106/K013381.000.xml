<L>Physicians are agreed that Copulation,</L>
<L>When age adult, and high-brac'd nerves invite,</L>
<L>Shou'd neither be immoderately desired,</L>
<L>Nor dreaded to excess. The good old man</L>
<L>Is by his tame frigidity admonished,</L>
<L>Not to engage in the dull drudgery,</L>
<L>Mistaken for enchanting scenes of pleasure;</L>
<L>Lest thus he snap his feeble thread of life.</L>
<L>But what more base, more noxious to the body,</L>
<L>Than by the power of fancy to excite</L>
<L>Such lewd ideas of an absent object;</L>
<L>As rouse the organs form'd for nobler ends,</L>
<L>To rush into th' embraces of a phantom,</L>
<L>And do the deed of personal enjoyment!</L>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little Treatise was at first not intended to be published se∣parate, but only to be annexed to ano∣ther work of the author's, printed at the same time, entitled, <HI>Observations on Spe∣cific Medicines,</HI> &amp;c. But as many may have an occasion to peruse this part without the other, who would not care to be at the expence of purchasing both together, a few copies were printed off separate for this reason.</P>
<PB N="viii" REF="4"/>
<P>All the merit which the author pre∣tends to in this, as well as in the other Treatise, is, his having offered to man∣kind the means for relief, established upon reiterated experience, (the most infallible foundation for the science of physic) which will scarce ever fail of giving satisfaction to the miserable pa∣tient; especially if the rules and direc∣tions prescribed, and given with the medicines herein recommended, are strictly adhered to.</P>
<P>In long protracted and obstinate cases, which will not easily yield to the gene∣ral method of cure, herein mentioned, the author desires to be consulted ei∣ther in person or by letter. He requests those who <HI>send</HI> their cases, to be very particular with respect to the symptoms of their indisposition, length of time they have been afflicted, what means
<PB N="ix" REF="5"/>they have already used, and likewise their age, present degree of strength, constitution, habit of body, &amp;c. and all letters, (post-paid) directed to him, to be left at Mr <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s and Co. book∣sellers, at the <HI>Oxford-Theatre,</HI> on the <HI>North-Side</HI> of <HI>St. Paul's Church Yard,</HI> shall have due attention paid them, and be answered with all the speed that the distance of place will admit of.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT TREATISE ON ONANISM.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ASTUPRATIO,</HI> or <HI>Ma∣nustupratio;</HI> Manual Stupration, or Self-Pollution, is a vice hardly to be named, much less to be practised in a country, where virtue, decency, or politeness, have the least re∣gard
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>paid to them; and this abominable and unmanly practice is productive of the most deplorable, and generally incurable disor∣ders.</P>
<P>Providence has implanted in human na∣ture what is by some called, <HI>the Passion of Love,</HI> and by others, <HI>the Appetite of Lust,</HI> for very wise purposes; but has given us reason to restrain this necessary inclination, and keep it within due limits. Every day, however, furnishes us with cases which evince, that reason is not always a ballance against the appetites; for boys regardless, or perhaps ignorant of the consequences, too frequently indulge themselves in this preposterous method of venery; and it is beyond a doubt, that many, more ad∣vanced in years, who are long immured in colleges and cloisters, and at last elope from their cells, utterly destitute of science, and equally unacquainted with the world and books, are not less guilty of this enor∣mous vice.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<P>These by a most detestable kind of magic, conjure up at pleasure an ideal <HI>Ve∣nus,</HI> and thus never want an opportunity of enjoying an imaginary mistress. The frequent repetition of these execrable plea∣sures induce an infinitude of the worst dis∣orders; such as Lethargies, Vertigo's, Atrophys, Apoplexies, Palsies, Lowness of Spirits, Hypochondriacal Disorders, Amauroses, a Tabes Dorsalis, and the worst species of a Gonorrhaea, most commonly attended with an utter impotence as to real enjoyments; besides an innumerable train of various nervous complaints, such as are the frequent attendants upon a de∣clining age, when the vigour of youth be∣gins to wear off.</P>
<P>These disorders chiefly derive their ori∣gin from those universal convulsions, that always attend the emission of the <HI>Semen;</HI> and if we consider the human body, as made up of flexible pipes, and yielding fluids, we shall readily understand how Convul∣sions
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>wear out the constitution, and pro∣duce these effects, viz. by destroying the strength and elasticity of the solid parts. And that the extacy which accompanies venereal enjoyments is of the nature of a convulsion, is not hard to be conceived. <HI>Quincy,</HI> in his explanation of <HI>Sanctorius</HI>'s Aphorisms expressly says, that <Q>"At the time of coition, the fibres are intensely drawn up; that too frequent use of this exercise, cannot but be very prejudicial to health by overstraining and destroying the force of the fibres"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect iv. Aphorism i.</NOTE></Q>; the natural conse∣quence of which must be a springyness and action upon their contents. Hence per∣spiration is lessened,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mala a nimio Coitu orta mediate a Perspiratione. Sanctor. Sect. vi. Aphorism iii.</NOTE> the fluids run into preternatural cohesions, and obstructions are generated. And this morbid condition is still augmented by an excessive loss of the
<PB N="15" REF="10"/><HI>Semen</HI> itself, since the blood is thereby robbed of its most pure, balsamic, and in∣vigorating particles.</P>
<P>Besides, it is worthy of remark, that people who are accustomed to such filthi∣ness, are not so easily cured of any chro∣nical distemper as those who are free from it; for as <HI>Celsus,</HI> speaking about venereal intercourses, prudently remarks, <HI>Caven∣dumne in secunda valetudine adversae presidia consumantur:</HI> that is, <Q>"We should take care of consuming wantonly in a state of health, what would be our support during sickness."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Semen verile,</HI> is a fluid of the most elaborate and noble production in the whole body, except that of the nerves, if such there be; and it is this vital feed which makes men hot, robust, hairy, of a strong and deep voice, bold and courageous, and fit to contrive, or exe∣cute
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>any enterprize. Men are a proof of this; whereas they who are destitute of vi∣tal Seed, are wrinkled, pale, weak, of a shrill voice, without hair, beardless and ef∣feminate; such are eunuchs. For we know from experience, when the secretory or∣gans of this juice are destroyed by cas∣tration before the time of puberty, as is frequently done in <HI>Italy</HI> to preserve the voice; or if by any accident a man is de∣prived of his testicles after this age, the destruction of these marks of verility also follow, in confirmation of this <HI>Boerhaave</HI> has given us an instance of fact. <Q>"There was, says he, an intrepid soldier, who, aspiring after the reward proposed by the general, to him who would first fix the standard in the enemies fort, climbed through the thick battery of the enemy, but unfortunately the fire of a cannon took off both his testicles; yet he reco∣vered, and became at length effemi∣nate, not in mind but in body. The strength of the several muscles of the genital parts still continued, and no∣thing
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>towards his virility but his testicles, and yet his voice soon altered, and beard fell off, &amp;c."</Q> But the man who is re∣tentive of the seminal juices, becomes bold, hardy and strong, like the beasts of the forest; witness the <HI>Athletae</HI> of old, who led chaste lives.</P>
<P>Therefore as the <HI>Semen</HI> is, as it were, the flower and choicest part of the blood and nervous fluid, so venery ought to be only moderately used; lest too great an evacuation of this substance prove preju∣dicial to health. A frequent ejection of the <HI>Semen</HI> requires a sound and vigorous habit of body, because it exhausts the strength, and weakens the person; hence <HI>Pythagoras</HI> when asked, when coition was to be used, wisely answered, <Q>"When you have an inclination to render your∣self weaker."</Q></P>
<P>As venery then only agrees with persons of robust and vigorous constitutions, so
<PB N="18" REF="13"/>the use of it is principally beneficial to health, after the stomach is empty, and perspiration duly performed, especially if the person has slept well, and taken ali∣ments of a nutritive quality, and easy di∣gestion. All these things are of such a nature, as to increase the strength and vi∣gour of the body, and consequently to favour venery, or at least prevent the bad effects it would otherwise have. It is also to be observed, that it is more salutary in Spring than at any other season of the year.</P>
<P>The person who would often engage in venery, ought to guard against all surfeits, hunger, labours, excessive studies, vene∣sections, watchings, purges, and every thing which can in the least impair and destroy the strength.</P>
<P><HI>Celsus</HI> observes,</P>
<Q><P>"That we ought not too eagerly to pursue, or too sollicitously to avoid, intercourses with the tender sex.
<PB N="19" REF="14"/> Pleasures of this kind, rarely indulged, render the body alert and active, but if too frequently repeated, weak, languid, and inactive. And as the proper de∣gree of these pleasures is not to be esti∣mated by the number of repetitions, but by the constitution, the age, and the strength of the person; so we may take it for granted, with respect to this particular, that the enjoyment which is neither followed by weakness, nor suc∣ceeded by pain, is not prejudicial.</P>
<P>The day is the worst season for plea∣sures of this kind, especially if they are succeeded by a full meal; the night is less hazardous, but even then subsequent fatigue, with long watching, render it improper. It is also to be abstained from in summer, because at that time, it is subject to throw the humours into preternatural commotions."</P></Q>
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
<P>But as moderation in every thing con∣tributes to health, so likewise does tempe∣rate venery, and every one ought carefully to consider what his constitution can bear. For a very robust person may safely indulge himself in a degree of venery, which would remarkably weaken one of a worse con∣stitution.</P>
<P>Persons of a tender and delicate habit of body, and weak <HI>Crasis</HI> of blood and spi∣rits, should by no means indulge them∣selves in venereal engagements, without great moderation and caution; those who are either too young, or too old, and those who are lately recovered from a disease, ought also to abstain from venery, lest they bring on too great a relaxation of the nerves, and by overstraining the fibres that compose all the parts of their bodies, in∣jure and weaken their several functions in the animal system, and become liable to all those disorders that have been already men∣tioned.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="16"/>
<P>Thus they, who by nature were stronger than others, have, by intemperance, ren∣dered themselves much weaker than those who were naturally weak; and those who were much weaker by nature, have, by their temperance, become superior in strength, to those who were stronger; for nothing renders an animal robust, but the seminal juice, which is therefore of great efficacy and importance towards health, strength and magnanimity, as well as pro∣creation.</P>
<P>But as there are too many, who do not attend to the rules here laid down, so much as would be convenient for them, perhaps the following case may be of some importance, to such as have not yet utter∣ly destroyed their constitutions, by an im∣moderate pursuit after pleasures.</P>
<Q><P>"A young man of twenty-five years of age, of a phlegmatico-sanguine habit, and
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>who from his very infancy, had a tender constitution, when about fifteen years of age, learnt of a wicked school-fellow, the execrable trick of <HI>Mastupration.</HI> He indulged himself in this vile and unman∣ly practice, very frequently, even al∣most daily, from the fifteenth to the twenty-third year of his age, and applied himself at the same time to writing in a very small character; by which means he contracted such an excessive weak∣ness of his head and eyes, that these latter were frequently convulsed, during his preposterous entertainment.</P>
<P>Some time ago, while he was wick∣edly employed in this manner, and his design upon the very point of being executed, some person or other unex∣pectedly knocked at his chamber door, which accident put him into such con∣fusion, that the ultimate scene of his di∣version was left unaccomplished. Upon this he immediately felt so exquisite a pain, and so vehement a tension in his
<PB N="23" REF="18"/>testicles, and spermatic vessels, that he could not walk without the utmost diffi∣culty. The force of his genius, and the sight of his eyes, seemed at the same time to be diminished and impaired.</P>
<P>Though he had the danger, with which this execrable practice threataned him, in full view, yet after the pain of his testicles was removed, he was so much infatuated as to repeat his crime, and begin afresh his former course; but he was soon after seized with the like pain in his genitals, and especially in his testicles, where the pain was ac∣companied with a very considerable ten∣sion. By the use of external and in∣ternal medicines for about half a year, he also got this disorder removed, but with some difficulty.</P>
<P>Soon after he was seized with a swel∣ling in those vessels, which go to the
<PB N="24" REF="19"/>left testicle. The swelling appeared larger than ordinary after his meals, but was not accompanied with pain, unless, when by his folly he brought a stimulus on the parts; but though it was void of pain, it was attended with another very unlucky circumstance, for it remains with him to this very day. To this was joined so great a weak∣in his head and eyes, that when he was about to read any thing, he seemed to be drunk, and flushed with wine; the pupils of his eyes were extremely di∣lated, and his eyes themselves racked with darting pains, accompanied with some degree of tension; his eye-lids seemed, as it were, oppressed with a kind of weight; in the morning they were conglutinated together, and wa∣tered very much; but this was not all, for both corners of his eyes, besides the violent pains with which they were racked, were also clogged and stuffed with a whitish kind of matter.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
<P>In this deplorable state he was obliged to give over reading, and interrupt the course of his studies, for the space of six months, during which time he only employed himself in exercise and re∣creation, and in taking the medicines, which were judged proper for one in his condition; by which means he recovered so far, as to be able to apply himself to his studies for two or three hours a day, which he can still do; but if at any time he should chance to protract his application, and lengthen out his studies beyond their stated time, he is immediately seized with the above symp∣toms; besides, he was become so lean that his body was little more than a skeleton; and though his appetite was good, yet he was indisposed after his meals, and was affected with a kind of drunkenness.</P>
<P>But when he got a juster sense of things, and had for almost the space of
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>two years abstained from his former practices, and from all commerce with women, he began to be troubled with very frequent nocturnal pollutions, by which he found his body gradually more and more weakened, and his strength impaired; so that now what seemed principally to be regarded was the re∣moval of this imbecility, which was after some time entirely cured, by the use of my STRENGTHENING ELECTUARY, of which more will be said hereafter."</P></Q>
<P>From this account, we learn, that Venery used either too soon or too often, not only impairs the strength of the body in gene∣ral, but also debilitates the noble functions of the brain and eyes, to such a de∣gree, that the loss becomes almost irre∣parable.</P>
<P>I have had an opportunity of seeing a great many cases, where persons well ad∣vanced
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>in years, have by immoderate ve∣nery, not only brought upon their eyes redness, darting pains, accompanied with tension, a heavy sensation, as if a weight was laid upon them, and a frequent shed∣ding of tears, but likewise such a weak∣ness of sight, that they were rendered in∣capable either to read or write; and I have found that in these very cases, the pupils were always dilated, as they are in a <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> by reason of the weakened, or lost tone of the muscular and nervous sibres which surround them. But why need I stop here? since I myself knew two cases, in which a <HI>Gutta Serena</HI> itself was brought on by excessive venery, and a long series of grief.</P>
<P>Hence it appears how great and sur∣prizing a consent there is between the se∣minal parts, or rather the spirituous se∣minal fluid itself, and the fabric of the eye, which is composed of the finest mem∣branes,
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>nerves and muscular fibres, as well as the most clear and transparent fluids.</P>
<P>The lymphatic seminal fluid is almost of the same nature and quality with that fluid which is secreted in the brain, and distributed through all the nerves of the body; for which reason, the more plenti∣ful the evacuation of the former is, the more scanty and defective the secretion of the other in the brain must of course be. Hence also a reason may be assigned why those youths, who begin too early to taste the forbidden joys of <HI>Venus,</HI> sustain a con∣siderable loss of memory, and are render∣ed unfit for study; and likewise why per∣sons farther advanced in years, who are excessively addicted to venereal pleasure, lose their strength, and bring on a pre∣mature death.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="24"/>
<P>The reason of the nocturnal pollutions in the case just recited, is very plain; for the more copious and frequent the afflux of the humours, especially of the seminal matter, has been to the organs destined for generation, either by the force of ima∣gination or otherwise; I say the more fre∣quent and copious such an afflux has been, the more the spermatic vessels are dilated and relaxed, and the seminal juice for that very reason, flows into them in a greater quantity, and lays a foundation for those wanton ideas, and seminal excre∣tions, which even during sleep affect peo∣ple of a warm imagination.</P>
<P>But the most formidable species of this disease, is when the retaining vessels are so extremely relaxed, as to permit the semi∣nal juices to pass off upon the slightest stimulus, as a luscious idea, or conversation with a woman, after straining at the dis∣charge of the excrements, or after riding
<PB N="30" REF="25"/>on horseback in consequence of a relaxa∣tion. In the night time the same accident happens from venereal dreams, with a sen∣sation of enjoyment; and this is frequent∣ly attended with a continual weeping, or gleet, which exhausts the strength of the patient.</P>
<P>The matter of this flux is an humid, thin, cold, colourless substance, called by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> a <HI>Liquid Semen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet. Hippocrat.</HI> Contract. p. 114.</NOTE> which is void of foecundity: for how is it possible that nature thus refrigerated, should emit a prolific juice? Those afflicted with this dis∣order must of necessity become old in ha∣bit of body, slow, languid, dull, spiritless, silent, feeble, wrinkled, unactive, pale, ef∣feminate, of a weak appetite, cold, with a heaviness of the limbs, and a numbness of the legs, weak, lazy, and indisposed
<PB N="31" REF="26"/>for all manner of action; in many subjects this disorder is the forerunner of a Palsy; but it oftener terminates in that species of a Consumption, called by physicians <HI>Tabes Dorsalis.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Tabes Dorsalis</HI> is a violent disorder, little treated of by physicians, though ful∣ly described by <HI>Hippocrates</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tabes Dorsalis ex spinali medulla oritur, praecipue vero recentes sponsos &amp; libidinosos corripit, febris sunt expertes, bene comedunt, &amp; colliquantur. Quod sit ita affectum perconteris, asseret sibi videri, ex su∣perioribus partibus a capite velut formicas in spinam demitti, cumque urinam &amp; stercus reddit, semen genitale copiosum &amp; liquidum ei prodit, neque gene∣ratio fit, &amp; inter dormiandum, cum uxore dormiat necne veneris Iudibria patitur. Cumque alias, tum praecipue per locum arduum, iter facerit, aut cucur∣rerit, anhelosus, &amp; imbecilis evadit. Caput gravatur, &amp; aures sonant. Hic temporis progressu vehementibus febribus correptus, perit ex lipyria febre. <HI>Burnet. Hippocrat.</HI> Contract. p. 114.</NOTE>. The symp∣toms which presage this Consumption, I have for the most part observed to be these, an hypochondriacal oppression, melancholy,
<PB N="32" REF="27"/>and too much thoughtfulness, pain in the back, and often in the head, an aching pain, rolling and hanging down of the testicles, a weakness of memory and sight, and a decay of strenght; there is a sense of weight and giddiness of the head, and a ringing in the ears, and as the disorder proceeds, all the symptoms are increased, the legs swell, as in dropical cases; in some, Ulcers arise on the loins, some of which are healed, whilst others rise in their stead. At last, a violent Cataract arising, the patient is rendered totally blind; these are followed by some others; as a thirst, an hectical disposition, an Atrophy, a wast∣ing of the flesh, &amp;c. &amp;c. till at last the body is brought to the highest degree of a Consumption; and that very often with∣out any cough, or any other remarkable sign of a Consumption of the Lungs.</P>
<P>These are the most common disorders that ensue from the excessive use of <HI>Venery,</HI> and the preposterous practice of <HI>Self-Pol∣lution,</HI> for the cure of which I have two
<PB N="33" REF="28"/>medicines which I shall recommend; the first, which answers the first intention of cure, <HI>viz.</HI> the stopping of the Gonorrhaea, is my STRENGTHENING ELECTUARY, which braces up and strengthens the weakened and relaxed solids, warms and invigorates the habit, promotes digestion, and thereby furnishes the dispirited and impoverished blood, with laudable and benign chyle.</P>
<P>The other medicine is my RESTORATIVE NERVOUS ELIXIR, which is perhaps the most stimulating <HI>Restorative</HI> that medicine can produce, and in the last decays of life, will still supply the vital lamp with some recruits; it is good in all Languors, Weak∣ness, and Decays of the constitution, for it strengthens all parts of the body, espe∣cially the stomach, when relaxed and disordered with frequent debauches, and by restoring the oscillation of the fibres, quickens the various motions, and gives fresh vigor to the animal functions. It is
<PB N="34" REF="29"/>an admirable remedy for those who have been in a manner wore out with venereal engagements, especially if their pleasures have been purchased at the expence of a few salivations, or a frequent use of mer∣curial medicines, and it will revive any constitution that it not quite mouldered into rottenness. But they best deserve such a <HI>Restorative,</HI> who by acute diseases, such as malignant Fevers, the Small-Pox, and the like, have been so broke and shattered in their constitutions, as hardly to be with∣in a possibility of recovery. For in such it will to admiration repair the impoverished juices, and fill again the veins with a warm, generous, nutritive blood.</P>
<P>It is excellent in diseases of the head, arising from a consent with the stomach, such as the Vertigo, Head-ach, Sleepy Diseases, dread of an Apoplexy, Weak∣ness of the memory and sight, and a noise or ringing in the ears. In Scrophulous
<PB N="35" REF="30"/>habits also, which are leaning towards Consumptions, it will be of the utmost service. And when young persons are not so early happy in their conjugal embraces as many wish to be, and it be suspected from a coldness, and insufficiency upon that account on either side, the use of this medicine cannot fail to render their inter∣course prolific, as it actually romoves the causes of impotency in one sex, and of sterility, or barrenness, in the other. But the use of it is varily to be indulged, lest with it be kindled a heat that reasonable coition cannot assuage. And let such as indulge themselves too lavishly in these en∣joyments, be careful how they spur nature, and prompt with such helps, lest they run off their life and strength too precipi∣tately, for the best constitutions in the world, wear out and sink under the fre∣quent repetition of such profusion, as the frequent straining any elastic body what∣soever, will weaken more and more it's spring, till it is quite lost, notwithstanding all the helps of art to preserve it.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="31"/>
<P>To conclude. The omnipotent Creator has given us <HI>Passions</HI> for very wise and good ends; which seem to be, that thereby we may be urged with a kind of impetuosity to shun evil, and embrace good; wherefore the passions are not bad in themselves, it is by their excess that they become vicious, when they rise to so extravagant a pitch, as not to be governed by the dictates of reason. But we ought to use our best endeavours to keep them within proper bounds, and the more difficult the conflict, the more glorious will be the victory.</P>
<P>We have all a natural propensity to pleasures; but these are of two very dif∣ferent sorts, the sensual and the mental. Sensual pleasures engross the greatest part of mankind, while these few only, <HI>quos equus amavit Jupiter,</HI> are taken with the beauties of the mental. And the reason why so many run after pleasures of the first sort, seems to be, because they hardly ever allow themselves an opportunity of
<PB N="37" REF="32"/>tasting the sweets of an upright conscience, or of feeling that joy, which arises to a good man, from the moderation of his ir∣regular desires; and being entirely devoted to the gratification of their sensual appe∣tites, they never give attention to the real charms of virtue. Wherefore whosoever desires to enjoy this solid happiness, ought to enure himself by degrees to the love of virtue, and ever carefully to avoid adding fuel to the fire of his passions.</P>
<P>Apposite to these sentiments is that say∣ing which <HI>Cicero</HI> puts into the mouth of <HI>Cato,</HI> as by him received from the great <HI>Archytas</HI> of <HI>Terentum; that nature never afflicted mankind with a more capital plague, than bodily pleasure; the eager desires of which spur on to enjoyment with ungovernable rashness.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Senectute. Cap. <HI>xii.</HI></NOTE></P>
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
<P>And the rest of what that great philoso∣pher has written on this subject, must de∣light the mind of every wise man in the perusal. Wherefore, <HI>Virtue</HI>'s exclamation in <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> is very just:
<Q><L>Quippe nec ira Deum tantum, nec tela, nec hostes,</L>
<L>Quantum sola noces, animis illapsa voluptas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Punicorum. Lib. <HI>xv.</HI> Ver. <HI>94.</HI></NOTE>.</L>
<L>Pleasure by gliding on the minds of men,</L>
<L>More mischiefs hast thou wrought than hostile arms,</L>
<L>Than wrath of Gods.</L></Q></P>
<P>But as the due government of the passi∣ons strengthens the mind, so temperance in diet renders the body less exposed to these turbulent motions. And this rule holds good, not only in those, who are naturally of a hot constitution, but even in those who curb their appetites; be∣cause it keeps them in a state of tranqui∣lity. And this is the way in general to resist these evils, or at least to diminish their effects.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="34"/>
<P>As for those who would have us to be entirely devoid of passions, and to sup∣press all the affections of the mind, as if they were so many evils; they certainly have a wrong notion of the wisdom, and goodness of the Almighty Creator, who has inserted, and, as it were, interwoven them into our frame for excellent purposes; for they are not only beneficial to indivi∣duals upon many occasions, but even ne∣cessary for keeping up society and con∣nexions between mankind.</P>
