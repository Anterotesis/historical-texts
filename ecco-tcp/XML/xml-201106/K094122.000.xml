<P>IN the following pages are contained some reasons why the contagious poison of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> received into the human body, can∣not be extinguished, or ex∣pelled by any Antidote, or other means than what nature effects in producing the dis∣temper. I have also endea∣voured to explain the man∣ner
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>of the propagation and eruption of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> from the practice of <HI>inocula∣tion;</HI> and why this distem∣per, taken, by common in∣fection, in the natural way, proves so much more fatal than that which is given by <HI>inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>The reasons that have in∣duced me to present you with this short account from the press, were by no means owing to a consciousness of my having cleared up these matters to any degree of
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>certainty; but because I do not remember to have seen any thing of this kind at∣tempted before; and in hopes that my endeavours may be the means of em∣ploying the thoughts of o∣thers to explain these laws of Nature to a greater degree of perfection.</P>
<P>These inducements have encouraged me in this Ad∣dress to your learned Socie∣ty; to which the World will ever be indebted for the improvement of Art and Sci∣ence;
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>and I hope they may be admitted, as a necessary apology, for this presump∣tion.</P>

<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>Some reasons why the Contagion of the Small-Pox, received into the human body, cannot be extin∣guished or expelled by any Anti∣dote, or other means than what Nature effects in producing the distemper.</HEAD>
<P>THAT most celebrated Pro∣fessor, the learned <HI>Dr. Boer∣haave,</HI> was of opinion that there is to be found out, in Nature, such a kind of medicine as would have the specific power of extinguishing, or eradicating the Contagion of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> from a body infect∣ed, without permitting any erup∣tion of the pustules; in the man∣ner that other poisons are cured by
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>peculiar <HI>Antidotes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aph. 1390-91-92. et prax. med. V. v.</NOTE>. Some other Physicians, also, revering the sen∣timent of this great man, have pretended to support the same opi∣nion.</P>
<P>But, as no improvements have yet appeared to have been made, at least nothing material has been advanced, by the advocates for this enquiry, notwithstanding the Doctor gave his reasons for his opi∣nion, and explained his suggestions as far as he could, it is probable, therefore, that the unsurmountable obstacles which have arisen from the consideration of this contagious venom, and the different manner of it's operations, have, hitherto, discouraged all the attempts that may have been since made towards
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>the discovery. And, indeed, I am inclined to think, that, had the Doctor written on this particular subject, after the practice of inocu∣lation grew to be so much used in <HI>Europe,</HI> as it now is, he would, from the new discovery of the operation of this morbific taint, have esta∣blished opposite reasons to an opi∣nion, which, many years ago, he thought uncontrovertable. For so conspicuous in experiment, as this is, could never have escaped his sagacious observation; which proves that the least particle of variolous pus, containing the very seeds of contagion, by enflaming and cor∣roding an external solid part, pro∣duceth <HI>a kind of Carbuncle;</HI> where∣by the natural operation of this contagious infection is demonstrated to the greatest degree of certainty,
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>and silences all <HI>hypothetical</HI> notions of its contaminating the fluids only, by explaining (as I shall endeavour to do more hereafter) that the mor∣bific effluvia of this disease received by inspiration, in the ordinary way of infection, by inflaming and cor∣roding, in like manner, such in∣ternal parts as are more immediate∣ly subservient to the vital purposes, are therefore more likely to be pro∣ductive of the most dangerous con∣sequences.</P>
<P>The method, however, <HI>given,</HI> for attaining to the knowledge of this discovery, is, after the infection of the Small-pox is taken, to pre∣vent inflammation, so that a suppu∣rated matter may not ensue: and this is proposed to be effected, by treating the distemper, like other inflammatory cases, in the begin∣ning;
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>and giving such correcting medicines, as, by gently diluting and dissolving the blood, may car∣ry off the cause by the convenient outlets; and so cure the disease, while in it's first state, without coming to suppuration.</P>
<P>For this purpose the Doctor mentions a preparation of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Antimony,</HI> brought to a great degree of penetrability, and ren∣dered intirely destitute of all <HI>Acri∣mony</HI> by dissolution, &amp;c; from whence, he says, there ariseth <HI>almost</HI> such a kind of medicine, and by which he hath seen some good ef∣fects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aethiops Mineralis</HI> hath been likewise proposed as a specific medicine, for the same intention, by <HI>Dr. Lobb,</HI> who hath given some instances of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> being,
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>in his judgment, prevented by the timely use of it. But as there have been frequent examples of people escaping this distemper, who had been supposed to be in the greatest danger of taking it; it is not improbable but that some of these may have been attributed, by mistake, to such preventive means as had been used on those occasions.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Cheyne</HI> also hath pronounc∣ed that the best <HI>Antidote</HI> in nature against the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> and the <HI>Plague</HI> itself, is <HI>Aethiops Mineralis</HI> and <HI>Cinnabaris Antimonii,</HI> taken, made up into boluses, twice or three times a day, and washed down with Orange Whey. Of the ef∣ficacy of which, he says, he has had some successful experience. For the confluent <HI>Small-pox,</HI> he
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>adds, is but a miniature of the <HI>Plague,</HI> and both are curable in good habits.</P>
<P>Many more writers (some of which are of great eminence) have touched also upon this matter, as the sentiment of <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> but without presuming any further; well knowing that an affair of this nature can admit of no alternative, and that it is to no manner of pur∣pose to pretend to defend by argu∣ment what cannot be sufficiently warranted by experience. For such particularities in opinion have been oftentimes ridiculed, in men of learning, as the effects of mere whim and chimera.</P>
<P>But the character of <HI>Boerhaave</HI> is too sacred for reflection, as he certainly had no design to impose on the judgment of others by a
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>prediction of this sort, which was grounded, probably, <HI>on such Spe∣culations in Chemistry</HI> as are not easily to be explained on <HI>mecha∣nical principles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dr. Mead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De variolis et morbillis.</NOTE>, however, could not pass over this opinion of his learned friend without wondering how he could be induced to hope that some time or other a specific <HI>Antidote</HI> would be found against the contagious poison of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> that is, by which it would be so tho∣roughly destroyed, that, tho'it had been received into the body, it could not produce the disease. For, continues he, the elements of things are so certain, and so well established by the permanent laws of Nature; that whosoever would endeavour to change them, would
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>act like those Philosophers <HI>by fire</HI> (as they stile themselves) who labour hard to transmute the baser metals into gold; and when continual disappointments have convinced them of the vanity of their hopes, actually extract gold out of the purses of the ignorant and credu∣lous by the fumes of their char∣coal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stack's transl. p. 58.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In an affair of this kind, it is undoubtedly the safest and truest way to consult nature herself, as a <HI>divine</HI> principle, diffused through∣out the creation, acting in all bodies by certain properties which are pro∣ductive of certain effects. And we may consider her in a vast vari∣ety of senses, as she doth nothing in vain; attempts always to pre∣serve
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>herself; cures all diseases; and acts upon unerring rules in all her ways. Hence we observe in Fevers, particularly those of the eruptive kinds, the most surprising commotions and conflicts, which serve to throw off the morbific mat∣ter by various ways, for the relief of the Patient; and, in these cases, especially, she is to be nicely observed, and followed with the greatest care; because any counter∣acting means would obstruct her first design, and make her proceed upon other different principles, which would consequently beattended with very different effects.</P>
<P>It ought to be considered, there∣fore, whether a specific <HI>antidote</HI> against the contagious taint of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> (if such an one were dis∣coverable) would not be likely
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>to do more hurt than good, by preventing a distemper, which, perhaps, was intended by nature, as <HI>Dr. Gilchrist</HI> observes, for a drain to clear the constitution of some gross humours, which, if not carried off in this way, would bring on other diseases. The same Gen∣tleman supports this opinion by ob∣serving that those Children who had had the Small-pox by inoculation in <HI>Scotland</HI> were uncommonly healthy; which he supposes to be owing to this cause, that the Fever in the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> communicated in the infant state, not only destroys or expells the latent seeds of dis∣eases, before they are, by time and accidents, perfected, and put into action; but causes such an altera∣tion of the humours as may make them less susceptible of any morbid
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>impressions: And the vessels being so accustomed, before they become rigid, to certain motions and ex∣tensions, the body is rendered, ever after, more passive to the impul∣ses of any subsequent distemper. This, he maintains, is agreeable to experience; for one who has suffered an acute illness will bear sickness better than another, who never had the like distemper, and be less overcome by it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edinb. Essays Phys. and Liter. Vol. 2. Art. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> calls nature the great physican; and our judicious <HI>Sy∣denham</HI> says, that a disease is nothing more than an effort of nature to throw off the morbific matter for the health of the patient; which <HI>Dr. Mead</HI> has observed to be no
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>where more particularly verified than in those envenomed Fevers, in which the violence of the dis∣temper breaks out on the Skin ei∣ther in the form of <HI>pustules, car∣buncles,</HI> or <HI>bubos.</HI> And hence it seems pretty plain that no art can abrogate the law of nature, by the prevention of those kind of dis∣eases which happen from contagion.</P>
<P>Those corpuscular effluvia of the Small-pox, or particles which fly off from distempered bodies, and, mixing with the juices of others, occasion the same disease, are pro∣duced from a matter differing from all other poisons, and liable to cause inflammation in a greater or lesser degree, according to the con∣stitutional state and condition of those that receive them: and some miserable cases of the <HI>Small-pox</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>have shewed us instances where the whole texture of the blood has been so broken and dissolved, that the <HI>crassamentum,</HI> after it had stood a while to become cold, could but just hold together. Yet, notwith∣standing, there have been some instances where this poison hath given so little disturbance, as scarcely to introduce any perceiv∣able lentor on the blood, at least not enough to obstruct it in the capil∣lary Vessels: And we have several times remarked where it has been ap∣plied by inoculation, that if it had not been for it's immediate action on a solid part, it would have proved insufficient even to show the cha∣racteristick marks of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is not altogether improbable but that this contagious venom may operate by various
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>ways; sometimes by coagulating the blood; at others by dissolving it; and sometimes by corroding the solid parts themselves: And this may be owing, perhaps, to such natural causes as are not with∣in the reach of human penetration. Which considerations, notwith∣standing the deference I pay to <HI>Dr. Boerhaave</HI>'s extraordinary merit and abilities, have induced me to ques∣tion, even, the bare possibility of such a discovery. But, to go on.</P>
<P>The Doctor intimates that the bite of the <HI>Scorpion,</HI> which was formerly supposed to be certain death, is now cured by the appli∣cation of the bruised <HI>Scorpion,</HI> or the oil of it, and concludes that all poisons have their <HI>antidotes;</HI> and, therefore, why may not a specific medicine be found out of such a
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>nature, that, being diffused all the body over, after the variolous in∣fection is received, may introduce contrary properties, and thereby extinguish the distemper in the be∣ginning, before those effects are produced which must, otherwise, necessarily follow? For what Phy∣sician, says he, in a <HI>Pleurisy, Quinsy,</HI> &amp;c. would wait for a cure by suppuration, when daily experi∣ence convinces us that these distem∣pers are regularly cured without it? and why may not the inflammation be carried off, as well, in the first stage of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> as in other inflammatory diseases, and so pre∣vent its coming to suppuration at all?</P>
<P>To this, it may be said, that the general method of cure in <HI>Pleu∣risies, Quinsies,</HI> and other inflam∣matory
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>distempers, which are nei∣ther contagious, nor of the erup∣tive kinds, proves insufficient to prevent the return of them, as often as the sudden changes and al∣terations of the weather, different seasons of the year, and many other accidental causes may happen to produce them. But, it is not so, in regard to the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> a disease which is propagated by it's own contagion only, without any other antecedent cause; and where a determinate length of time brings on every thing according to it's stated periods; so that nature, in doing her part, is a most certain guide to the Physician for the do∣ing of his. Besides it is evident that the venom of this distemper can infect us but once; insomuch that that pabulum in our bodies,
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>which is productive of this disease, being totally taken up by the con∣tagion it hath received, is thereby expunged and eradicated, so that there remains nothing, afterwards, on which this morbific matter can have any further effect. And, indeed, in this sense, it may be truly said that the <HI>Small-pox</HI> is it's own <HI>antidote,</HI> by protecting all that undergo it from any future attack.</P>
<P>It may be granted how extream∣ly difficult it is to clear the mass of blood of this poison; yet it is most certainly true that Nature en∣deavours, with all her might, at the expulsion of it in the most perfect manner; that is, by forcing the morbid matter, as much as possible, to the pustules<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mead de variol.</NOTE>: And
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>any interruption must prove of dangerous consequence, lest the humours should be impeded in their circulatory motion, and fall into an intestine one, and grow putrid; which is frequently the case after too large evacuations, or excessive heat; where there is such a scarcity of spirits, that the solids do not vibrate sufficiently to keep the fluids in their due velocity.</P>
<P>This plainly indicates the hurt∣fulness of too great evacuations in the beginning of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> and shews the Physician's part to be only to assist, by following nature; and not going before her.</P>
<P>The <HI>Measles</HI> are an inflamma∣tory fever of the eruptive kind; whose pustules never arrive to a purulent state like those of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> and they are cured by
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>bleeding, and cooling medicines: but, I believe, it was never yet seen that these remedies could pre∣vent their eruption, tho' made use of ever so soon after taking in the nfection.</P>
<P>There have been some instances in the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> where spontane∣ous hemorrhages, or other repeated bleedings have seemed to alter the nature of the distemper in some degree, by making that prove kind∣ly, which would, probably, have fallen out otherwise, for want of those evacuations; but, I am per∣suaded, there never was any one proof of the contagion being wholly carried off that way, without some eruption of the pustules: so that it seems evident, even to a demon∣stration, that Nature, after a re∣moval of the load that oppresses
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>her, must be left to do her part in her own way, by causing sup∣puration, in a greater or lesser degree, as there happens to be oc∣casion for it; in order to free the body from the corrupted state of the blood and humours arising from the contagious taint of this disease.</P>
<P>Moreover it is certain that the whole animal body, at all times before it has passed through the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> is, in every part alike, liable to receive the morbose, or infecting taint, and so propagate the disease. We know, also, that the least particle of the morbific mat∣ter, applied to any part of the body, will cause the <HI>Small-pox</HI> to be produced as effectively as a much greater quantity could be capable of doing it. And it is evident, from common experience, that all
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>mankind, as well those who come of parents that have had the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> as those that have not, are alike liable to it; so that we may conclude the pabulum of this dis∣temper to be a part of the human nature, conceived in the first rudi∣ments of generation; and therefore not to be extinguished by any art, or other means, than it's own na∣tural destroyer, the <HI>Small-pox</HI> itself; which only can render the body more perfect, by eradicating this one natural principle of morta∣lity, and thereby giving it a secu∣rity, for ever, against any further attack from this great evil.</P>
<P>The contagion of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> previously considered in a pestilen∣tial sense, the true manner of it's operation on human bodies, as it may be best known from the expe∣riment
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>of inoculation, seems suf∣ficient to furnish more matter for the <HI>Physician</HI> and <HI>Philosopher</HI> than could possibly have been advanced without it. Insomuch that the discovery of a specific medicine to prevent the burning of a <HI>Caustic,</HI> or even <HI>Fire</HI> itself, may as well be expected, as to destroy the power of variolous contagion, when taken either in the natural way, or appli∣ed by inoculation. Most certain, therefore, it is, that no discovery of this kind, so seemingly repug∣nant to the laws of Nature, can ever be ascribed to human inven∣tion.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="explanation">
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
<HEAD>An attempt to explain the manner of the propagation and eruption of the Small-pox, from the practice of inoculation: And why this di∣stemper, taken by common in∣fection, in the natural way, proves so much more fatal than that which is given by inoculation.</HEAD>
<P>THE main business of natu∣ral Philosophy, as <HI>Sir Isaac Newton</HI> observes, is to argue from <HI>Phenomena,</HI> without feigning <HI>Hy∣potheses,</HI> and to deduce causes from effects till we come to the very first cause. Therefore it ought to be the study of Physicians to consider well the various and subtile me∣thods which Nature useth in pro∣ducing diseases; and this can be known in general only by the dif∣ferent
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>symptoms that occur to indi∣viduals in all cases. For her pro∣gress is undoubtedly slower or fas∣ter according to the different me∣thods she takes in expelling the morbific cause, so that the morbid particles, being separated by her own action, may be discharged in her own way.</P>
<P>When a body, therefore, be∣comes contaminated by a contagious taint, it may be of the greatest use to know by what means it so hap∣pened; as the mode of nature, in her method of extricating the morbific matter, differs, probably, in great measure according to the different manner of receiving it: insomuch that the danger or safety of the patient may depend greatly on the primary communication of this matter either to an external or
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>an internal part. And this opi∣nion hath been confirmed by many observations of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> pro∣duced by inoculation, where the distemper hath been remarkably great from a multitude of the pus∣tules, as well as the condition of them; which have gone off, by that preventive means, without any great uneasiness; whereas the same, in the natural way, are usually at∣tended with a very <HI>high Fever, Delirium,</HI> and other dangerous contingencies, owing probably to imperceptible <HI>effluvia</HI> conveyed, at first, to the <HI>Lungs, Heart, Brain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for a further explanation of this matter, by an enquiry into the different methods that nature pur∣sues in communicating the <HI>Small-pox</HI> both by common infection, and
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>the artificial experiment of inocu∣lation, we shall the better form a judgment, agreeable to her own elements and principles, by her own rules and indications. And, in order thereto, it is manifestly certain, that, the air being infected with the venom of this distemper, the morbific particles, contained therein, are received into the hu∣man body by inspiration; and they act, wherever they happen to fall, by an irresistable power, like fire unextinguishable, until they have utterly subdued that pabulum in the body which was susceptible of this contaminating taint, and so propagated the disease: for thus it is we are secured from having the <HI>Small-pox</HI> a second time. But the causes of it's destructive malignity may be more than the nicest ob∣servation
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>can discover. And, in∣deed, the mode of Nature, from this theory alone, seems to be too intricate and perplexing for human understanding; insomuch that the nature of the morbific matter, from whatever different kind of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> it may happen to come, is cer∣tainly the same, and plainly makes no difference in the nature of the disease. The difference of consti∣tutions, therefore, it may reason∣ably be supposed, is the principal cause of the different kinds of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI> And, these principles being generally admitted, I think it evident, therefore, as far as it can be demonstrated from experience, that a different manner in giving the infection (I mean that of ino∣culation) manifestly produceth a different effect. And this, I make
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>not the least doubt, would unex∣ceptionably appear upon the trial, if it was possible to meet with two persons of exactly the same age and constitution, by communicating, to each of them, the same conta∣gious taint, by the different ways of infection. But, for want of this, let us examine further, by pursuing the mode of nature, also, under the experiment of inocula∣tion, and see what new discovery will arise to give an additional light to this matter.</P>
<P>By this method of trial it is evi∣dent that the smallest portion of the variolous pus, applied, by a slight incision, to any part of the body, acts in the manner of a <HI>caustic,</HI> by inflaming and corroding the part; insomuch that the conti∣nuity, after some days, is destroy∣ed;
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>and an ulceration caused from the separation of the <HI>eschar:</HI> And the taint of this infection, being infused into the blood, is convey∣ed, by means of the circulation, throughout the whole animal body; and touching every where on it's proper pabulum, like a spark of fire among particles of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> or <HI>Nitre,</HI> in a certain length of time it doth it's office, by exciting feverish symptoms, which regularly go off in a <HI>diaphoresis;</HI> whereby the salt serum of the blood, so impregnated, is driven out by the glands of the skin; and then the pores, being properly enlarged, let out the fiery pustules on the surface; which seems to be the true manner of the propagation and eruption of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI></P>
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
<P>From this experiment we may reasonably suppose that the morbi∣fic effluvia of this distemper, re∣ceived by inspiration also, produce the same kind of <HI>phenomenon</HI> in the natural way; and that these veno∣mous particles, happening to fall on the vital parts, by inflaming and corroding the same, in like man∣ner, are so commonly attended with their fatal effects; for instance, on the <HI>Lungs, Brain,</HI> &amp;c.; where it is impossible for nature to help her∣self, or be furnished with any assis∣tance to her relief. And this may occasion, which we daily see, <HI>high fevers, delirium, shortness of breath, the most surprising struggles and conflicts, and sudden changes in the Small-pox.</HI></P>
<P>It may be supposed, also, that an infinite number of the virose
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>particles, contained in the infected air, may be drawn in by the breath and nostrils at the same time; and so conveyed by the divarication of the <HI>Trachaea</HI> to the <HI>Lungs;</HI> and also by the <HI>olfactory nerves,</HI> or their <HI>fibrillae,</HI> to the most delicate texture of the brain, whereby a multitude of different parts may receive the contagious effect at the same instant of time; which, by pervading the innermost recesses of the whole animal <HI>compages,</HI> may so break and destroy the continuity of parts of moment, as to render a dissolution of the whole frame un∣avoidable. And that particular spe∣cies of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> in which the texture of the blood is so absolutely broken, that it dischargeth itself by every outlet of the body; and, stagnating in the small cuticular
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>vessels, produceth black, gangren∣ous spots, all the surface over, is but too melancholy a proof of the truth of this <HI>hypothesis,</HI> from the sudden and untimely destruction that it usually brings upon the patient.</P>
<P>Inoculation explains also the rea∣sonableness of this opinion: for if the morbific matter be applied to ever so many place, it will have the same effect in every one; by occasioning so many corroding <HI>Car∣buncles,</HI> if they may be so called; which, the more they are, the more likely they will be to increase the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the contagious infection of the blood and spirits: and, for this reason, I have wholly given up an opinion I had espoused some years ago; from a supposition that discharges from more inoculated places than one would be of advan∣tage
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>to the patient, by carrying off a greater quantity of the humours of the body, by means of those drains; and so, consequently, would be likely to prevent such feverish disorders and complaints, as might, otherwise, arise in the course of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI> But experience hath plainly shown this kind of doctrine to be erroneous; and convinced me, that the application of the vi∣rose matter, to one part only, is much safest and best; and, indeed, the corrosion of any one part, caused by the application of variolous mat∣ter, is a sufficient proof of its tak∣ing effect, and doing all that this contagion can do; even tho' there may happen to be scarce any febril symptoms produced from it, or so much as a perfectly distinguished pustule of the <HI>Small-pox:</HI> for the
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>ulcerated part being cicatrised, will remain, beyond all dispute, as cer∣tain a mark of security to the pa∣tient, as if the skin had received the impressions of having under∣gone this distemper in ever so great a degree. And truly, if it were not so, several persons, under my own care, who had no pustulary erup∣tions, must have taken the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> from those who were their companions and bed-fellows in the distemper, by the ordinary way of infection; which the experience of such trials plainly convinced me they could not. From these cases, therefore, it seems reasonable to sup∣pose, that this kind of artificial car∣buncle, caused by the inoculation, was alone capable of extricating from the human nature the first princi∣ples of this distemper.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
<P>From what hath been already advanced, it seems pretty certain that these first principles of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> being susceptible of the contagion to the most distant extre∣mities, are diffused, in all parts alike, throughout the whole ani∣mal body; the principal caution, therefore, requisite to be observed by Physicians, in regard to those in whom this matter is to be ap∣plied, is to consider well their dif∣ferent constitutions and tempera∣ments, as they are of themselves naturally productive of the diffe∣rent kinds of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI> For it is, I believe, a generally receiv∣ed opinion that the contagious ve∣nom of this disease is in it's own nature the same, and differs only according to the different bodies it is infused into. In some, for in∣stance,
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>we see that this poison ap∣plied can produce no more than it's own <HI>variolous carbuncle,</HI> or a very few of the pustules at most, and those of the shortest duration; whereas, in others, it is manifest that the different fluids become more contaminated, and, therefore, consequently produce other diffe∣rent degrees of the <HI>Small-pox:</HI> and wherever the <HI>lymphatick vessels</HI> are corroded by the <HI>variolated acri∣mony,</HI> being more than can be transpired by the pores of the skin, it occasions a suffusion of the <HI>lym∣pha</HI> itself, and so consequently pro∣duceth a confluence of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> and this happening common∣ly in a greater degree on the head and face, is undoubtedly owing to the great force of the circulation of the blood, which, carrying
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>with it a variolated power, causes the effects above mentioned. The ventricles of the brain also, from the same morbose cause, are usu∣ally so affected as to occasion deli∣rium, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> in the same manner probably, that the effluvia of strong drink and spirits affect the brain in drunkenness: for thus it is that the blood, having received any morbi∣fic taint, purifies itself in the cir∣culation, by throwing off it's he∣terogeneous particles by the com∣mon emunctories which nature hath provided, as far as the animal faculties, under a morbid state are capable of accomplishing it.</P>
<P>Those principles in our nature, which are susceptible of the conta∣gion of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> tho' they are not, I believe, as I have before ob∣served, liable to undergo a change,
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>by any power of medicine, suffici∣ent to prevent the influence of va∣riolous infection; yet experience convinceth us (if we can be so con∣vinced) that the manner of propa∣gating the distemper produceth a very different effect: and there can be no occasion to enforce the truth of this opinion by argument, since God's Providence hath appeared, in the success of inoculation, so much in favour of that practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since inoculation hath been brought into practice, it is said, by good authority, that there has been an annual decrease of a fifth part of the deaths by the <HI>Small-pox</HI> within the bills of mortality.</NOTE>.</P>
