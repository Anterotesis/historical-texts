<HEAD>TO THE PHYSICIANS OF THE CITY <HI>of BRISTOL.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Reason of my undertaking the following Analysis, will be plainly enough seen in the Introduc∣tion; but whether I have succeeded or fail'd in my Account of the <HI>Diabetes</HI> and it's Cure, as it arises from the <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, is left entirely to your Determination.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
<P>It has never once enter'd into my Imagination, that those Waters will more effectually cure a <HI>Diabetes</HI> and <HI>Hectic</HI> now than heretofore, or any great Advantage accrue to Mankind from this Account; yet it has ever been agreeable to find the Theory of any Science, corresponding to the Facts arising from the Practice of it.</P>
<P>You will excuse me, if thro' this Account of the <HI>Diabetes, &amp;c.</HI> I in∣cline to my Profession. Every Man has some Bias, and the Business in which he is most engag'd is naturally most apt to draw him.</P>
<P>There was a time you perfectly well know, when almost every thing in Physic was accounted for from Chemical Principles. There was also, when every Disease and the Cure of
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>it, was reduced to Mathematical and Hydrostatical Accounts: And all these in their different Turns have disap∣pear'd, and Observation and the History of Diseases have again suc∣ceeded.</P>
<P>But methinks there is a Degree of Truth annex'd to every Manner of accounting for Disorders, tho' not an absolute one, and they seem to be mostly false, only when they deny a Truth to each other. Anatomy will discover to us, that the Arteries and Veins contain what we call Blood, but what that Fluid is, and what Al∣terations arise in it from different De∣grees of Heat, and the Addition of different Medicines, Chemistry alone can inform us. It informs us also ex∣perimentally, whether our Secretions, some of them, are perfectly secern'd
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>or not. And tho' we cannot venture to ascertain, that because such and such Phaenomena arise from the Mix∣ture of different Medicines with the Animal Fluids, apart from the Body, that they will be similar there to, when within the Laws of Circulation; yet we must not altogether dispise the <HI>Experimental</HI> and <HI>Analogical</HI> Manner of reasoning; since we very often see that very fatal Consequences are brought on by Medicine, and very probably too in the same Manner within us, as without, in the Experiments. It would be as ridiculous, just, as if we should contemn the Advantages ac∣cruing from Numbers because we can∣not attain to Infinity.</P>
<P>Whatever has been said here in the Chemical Hypothesis, may be said with equal Truth in another View of
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>the Mathematical and Hydrostatical Account.</P>
<P>It may perhaps seem at first Sight that the Situation of the Well is too poetically described, for any thing in which Physic is concern'd; but I ima∣gine when it is consider'd that it was design'd as a Picture, and as it relieves the Mind from the Dryness of the Ex∣periments, such a Liberty may be al∣low'd me; especially since when the Description ends, that kind of Stile is no longer continued.</P>
<P>If this Essay should have the good Fortune of being liked by you, it will amply reward the Care I took in the Experimental Part; where to be just was my strictest Endeavour, as it shall always be in preparing those Medi∣cines which may come under your
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>Administration: And for those Rea∣sons, that every Physician may receive the due Honour of a just Prescription, and every Patient the true Effect of a good Medicine.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is more than a Year since I began a Course of Experiments on the <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters; but up∣on knowing that Dr <HI>Keir</HI> had undertaken the Analysis, I im∣mediately stopt my Enquiry, and awaited his Publication, in Expectation of something quite accurate and satisfactory. Upon perusal of his Book I found my self disap∣pointed, and continu'd my Experiments for these Reasons.</P>
<P>First, because I see no Account for the Heat and other Phaenomena of the Waters.</P>
<P>Next, I apprehend the Conclusions drawn from his Experiments are not just.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<P>And lastly, If the Waters do contain what the Doctor affirms, they will ever be irreconcilable with the Cure of a <HI>Diabetes.</HI></P>
<P>I think then, there needs no Apology for an Enquiry of this Kind. It rather becomes necessary that some other should be made which may bring the Rationale and Practice of those Waters to coincide, and satisfy the Patient of the Truth of some Principles, upon which he may ground his Expectation of a Cure. Now let us suppose they con∣tain <HI>Nitre</HI> and <HI>Limestone Powder</HI> with an exceeding subtle Spirit. Is there in this City any Physician that would heartily prescribe these Waters: Or any distant Physician that would send a Patient to a Mineral either trifling, inefficacious, or of a Nature quite opposite the Cure? If then this should be the Event, which is not unlikely, it will be fatal to the Health, if not Lives, of great Numbers.</P>
<P>As the following Experiments are of my own making, I can the better answer for the Truth of the Facts. There has been no Accuracy wanting in discovering the Con∣tents of the Waters, and ascertaining them from Phaenomena quite definitive. I have produced also analogous Appearances by dif∣ferent Experiments, with Conjectures of their
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>Causes; then having consider'd the Source of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> I shew the Effects of those Con∣tents on animal Solids and Fluids as they produce the Cure.</P>
<P>Whatever Contradictions may be found in this Analysis to that of Dr <HI>Keir,</HI> they must not be understood to arise from any Inclination I have to contradict, but from the Truth of the Examination. And where that is the Supposition every Man will be satisfied with it, however contrary to his Sentiments.</P>

<PB REF="11"/>
<HEAD>THE SITUATION OF THE HOT-WELL.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Situation of the <HI>Hot-Well</HI> is as picturesque perhaps as can be imagin'd; it lies on the Side of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> about a Mile and half distant from the City of <HI>Bristol.</HI> The Stream issues from a very high Clift of Lime Rock, perhaps two hundred Feet below the Summit, and ten above the Level of Low Water, but as the Water rises here in the lowest Tides thirty Feet, and in the Spring much more, it was of Necessity ren∣der'd inaccessible some hours every Day, till Mr <HI>Padmore,</HI> (a Man well known for his
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>Genius in Mechanics) inclos'd it with a Cistern, and affixed Pumps to the Spring, by means of these the Stream is elevated almost thirty Feet in all its native Heat, Purity, and Perfection: Notwithstanding this Care the River Water, when it rises above the Spring, mixes with the Medicinal and renders it unfit for Use; this is perfectly well known by those that pump at the Well, and consequently as soon as perceived they abstain till it recovers its former Purity.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Avon</HI> flows here till it falls int othe <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, between two Cliffs, in some Places vastly high, craggy and over∣hanging, in others perpendicular or gently sloping; here cover'd with Woods and flowering Shrubs, of all the different Shades of Green, fill'd with Music of our Singing Birds; There gloomy and obscure, con∣trasted by strong Lights, and various Colours of the Marble Rocks, which are as variega∣ted as the foreign, and admit as beautiful a Polish. Add to this the flowing of the Tide which enhanses the Beauty, by bringing Vessels of every Kind close to the Windows of the <HI>Water-Room,</HI> and compleats as agreeable Landscape as can be seen any where. And as the Mind and Body reciprocally affect each other, how proper an Entertainment is it for the Imaginations of Men indis∣posed,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>and how Salutary an Avocation to those Thoughts which every <HI>Valetudinarian</HI> is too apt to indulge? Hence it is in some greater degree conducive to Health, than Places altogether void of these Amusements.</P>
<P>On the Summit of the Rocks there for∣merly stood a Chapel, dedicated to St <HI>Vin∣cent,</HI> it is equally uncertain whether he was canonized for the Discovery of the Medicinal Spring, and the Cures thence resulting to Mankind, or from clearing the River of huge Rocks that distress'd the Sailors in their Navigation near this Place. Whatever was the Cause, he constantly received their Vows for fafety as their tutelar Saint, and was of no small Distinction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Downs</HI> which are on a Level with the Cliffs are of a dry healthy Soil, and much frequented by Company; they are open to the reviving Breezes of the Sea, which refresh them every Summer's Day. Here too you may adapt your Prospects and Situa∣tion to every Humour, whither you chuse to be conceal'd beneath the Shade of Rocks and Woods, reclin'd beside some murmuring Rivulet, which naturally return our Thoughts upon ourselves; or whether you prefer the exalted Situation, where the Mind widens with the View into Benevolence and good
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>Wishes. That Prospects have a kind of Moral Effect on the Thought I presume no one will deny, since Light and Colours are to the Eye, what Sound and Harmony is to the Ear. Hence too it was that the Temples of the ancient Deities were situated accord∣ing to their Attributes: That of <HI>Pluto</HI> in a Cavern all sad and gloomy, by the Side of rumbling Waters; whilst that of the Muses was placed on the Point of <HI>Parnassus</HI> all gay and enlivening; perhaps the most elevated Eminence of this Cliff was made the Seat of St <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Chapel, because his Beneficence was more extensive than that of other Men.</P>
<P>The essential Difference of the Air in this Place, from most other dry and elevated Situations is, that it has but little, if any, of that <HI>vague Acid,</HI> so generally dispersed thro' the Earth, which in some Places is even deadly, as at the Grotto <HI>Dei Cani</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> We may be assured of this from the Nature of the Waters and Fossils in both, which, an Alcalescence prevails. Now every thing offensive in the Atmosphere must arise from Exhalation, but it is scarce probable that there are any acid Effluvia here, because if the acid was in any Quantity there must be more Salts found in the Water, since it is evident there is no want of Limestone: Now Limestone and a mineral Acid for ever pro∣duce
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>Alum, and consequently as there is little Alum found here, the Air must be void of acid Effluvia: Notwithstanding this this great Advantage, it must not be thought that this Air is agreeable to every Indispsi∣tion, it can be of Service to none but those of a cold pituitous nervous Habit, and detri∣mental to all whose Juices tend to Alcalescence and Putrefaction from a sanguine Constitu∣tion.</P>
<P>The Lodging-Houses are neat and well situated, having a pleasant Prospect, and as they are near a large City 'tis easy to be pro∣vided with every Necessary: Here are Baths too, both private and well contriv'd, and a <HI>Long Room</HI> with the usual Diversions attend∣ing such Places.</P>
<P>It seems but of little Significancy to deter∣mine the Quantity of Water discharged in any certain Time, because it conduces no∣thing towards an Account of it's Properties, and since there is more wasted than used, notwithstanding the great Demand for it. But should there be any one curious enough to enquire, he may be satisfied by the follow∣ing Experiment: it has been experimentally found by Monsieur <HI>Mariotte,</HI> that Water flowing from the Surface of a Pool thro' a Hole an Inch square, and always full, runs
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>off thirty Cubic Feet in an Hour, <HI>Paris</HI> Measure. Upon this Experiment having ta∣ken the mean Proportion of the Depth of the Stream, where it runs out over the Rock, it may be nearly known how many square Inches it contains, and consequently what Aperture it would pass through naturally; then considering that the Contents of Circles are to each other as the Squares of their Diameters, the whole Discharge in one Hour may be pretty justly known.</P>
<P>How long this Medicinal Water has been prescribed by Physicians, for those Maladies it is now so deservedly esteem'd to cure, is uncertain. We know however, that they have been administer'd with great Success, and their Character much heighten'd by the present Physicians of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>

<HEAD>EXPERIMENTS ON THE BRISTOL WATER.</HEAD>
<P>THE more accurately to distinguish the Genus of the Waters, I shall consider the Phaenomena as they naturally appear. The first of which are its sparkling and whiteness in the Glass. Upon growing cold this whiteness disappears, and is precipitated to the Bottom of the Bottle in white Flakes, after being kept some Time.</P>

<P>To the Bottom of a Glass, by means of some Wax, having fix'd a Thermometer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Thermometer was of <HI>Farenheit</HI>'s Contrivance, and measur'd from Iceland Cold to Hot by a Scale of 112 Degrees.</NOTE>, it was pump'd on till the Spirits rose to the utmost from the Heat, upon Examina∣tion it was found to the Heat of Health as Seventy-seven is to Ninety-four, the Heat of the Atmosphere being at that Time Fifty-two.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
<HEAD><HI>Experiment</HI> II.</HEAD>
<P>To a Glass of the Water recent from the Spring was poured Syrup of Violets, and it became green; with a Solution of Silver in Aqua fortis, Sugar of Lead in common Wa∣ter, Oil of Tartar <HI>per Deliquium,</HI> it turn'd milky and precipitated. Quicksilver dissolv'd in strong Spirit of Nitre, turn'd yellow with the Hot-Well Water; with a Solution of Sublimate in Water, Spirit of Hartshorn, and Tincture of Steel, the Water continued tran∣sparent. With Oil of Vitriol a brisk Agita∣tion and Effervescence arose, with Galls no Difference.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD><HI>Experiment</HI> III.</HEAD>
<P>In order to know whether there were any Spirits escap'd from the Waters in cooling, I fix'd a Receiver to a Retort, and well luted the Juncture; then thro' a Hole made in the Crown of the Retort, by a Glass Fun∣nel the Retort was fill'd with Water as it ran warm from the Spring; the Hole then being stopt, I waited to see if there would any Spirit come over into the Receiver: In all the cooling there appear'd not the least Eva∣poration or Dew, and if there was any, it
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>escaped like Light thro' the Pores of the Glass, a Thing scarce credible.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Experiment</HI> IV.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Bristol</HI> Water examin'd statically, and compared with Rain Water receiv'd very pure on an Eminence, scarce differ'd from it in weight, it was ten Grains in a Pint lighter than common Spring Water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD><HI>Experiment</HI> V.</HEAD>
<P>Having distill'd five Gallons of <HI>Bristol</HI> Water from a clean Glass Retort, in a gentle Heat of Sand, there remain'd 280 Grains of a whitish Salt Powder, and consequently 7 Grains to a Pint, now a Pint containing 28⅞ Cubic Inches, and a Cubic Inch weighing 253 2/10 Grains nearly, the Water is to the Residuum as 7310 to 7, or 1044½ to 1.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="experiment">

<P>Two Drams of the Remains being dis∣solved in Water and filter'd, the Salt was found after Evaporation, to the Earth as eleven to thirteen, with another Solution of the Remains after Filtration, all the Ex∣periments were repeated that were made by different <HI>Menstrua</HI> at the Well. The Dif∣ference
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>was, that Syrup of Violets did not turn green, nor the Solution of Mercury yellow, but Spirits of Hartshorn became milky, and Oil of Vitriol discover'd no Ef∣fervescence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD><HI>Experiment</HI> VII.</HEAD>
<P>Another Part of the filter'd Solution was evaporated till a Pellicle appear'd, and then was placed in a cold Cellar that the Salts might shoot: After a few Days the Glass was cover'd with Crystals, which being exa∣min'd by a Microscope appear'd octogonal, interspersed with cubical ones.</P>

<P>Having separated the octogonal Crystals from the Square, I put them in a Crucible on the Fire, at first they melted, then dry'd and blister'd, and became white, after taking off the Crucible there appear'd a light spongy Substance, acrid to the Taste.</P>

No other Mineral

<P>To the Earth left after the Evaporation of Lime Water, I added Oil of Vitriol, it excited an Effervescence, and was not to be distinguished in any Respect, or Experiment, from the Earth of the Hot-Well.</P>
<P>From the foregoing Experiments it pretty plainly appears, that instead of Nitre and Limestone Powder with an exceeding subtle Spirit, there is contain'd in the Water Alum and Lime in the Act of Slaking; and from thence only I shall deduce the Cure of a <HI>Diabetes;</HI> and then show if it was Nitre and a Volatile Spirit they would be abso∣lutely mischievous, and if Limestone ineffi∣cacious: But before I proceed to account for the Cause of a <HI>Diabetes</HI> and its Cure, I shall advance some Conjectures about the Cause of the Heat, as it arises from Lime in the slaking.</P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="theories">
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
<HEAD><HI>Conjectures on the Cause of the Heat of the</HI> HOT-WELL <HI>Water.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I begin, I foresee the most material Objection, which is, that na∣turally there is no Limestone calcin'd, and consequently the Heat must arise from some other Cause; and as that Acid which is every where floating thro' the Earth, re∣sembles Oil of Vitriol, it will, like that Oil meeting with Water, produce Heat; this may be granted, but then the Stream would taste acid, and turn Syrup of Violets red, and the Alum must be in greater Proportion, since here is more alcaline Earth than the Acid can sate: Which is demonstrated by the alcaline Qualities predominating at the Well. Neither can the Warmth arise from the Solution of the Salts, for all fossile Salts
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>produce Cold in Dissolution, much less can it come from the Attrition of the Water, because that is experimentally known not to affect Water. If in the polishing two Marble Stones you rub one against the other dry, they will conceive an intense Heat, but add the least Water and it is impossible to produce it.</P>
<P>These Objections then being got over, I beg leave to take back my own Sentiments wherever I find them, and endeavour to prove, that it is probable, at some distant Time this Lime Rock was partially cal∣cin'd by a subterraneous Fire, and has sup∣plied the Stream with Warmth ever since.</P>
<P>It must be consider'd at the same Time, that this Subject will admit of no experi∣mental Proof, and whether I succeed or not in the Account of the Cause of the Heat, it has already been definitively proved to be a Lime Water, in which is dissolved Alum and Sea-Salt; but as Natural Philoso∣phy is in great Part but Analogy, and as Pro∣bability is equal to Demonstration in all Cases where a down-right Negative with∣out any Support is the Opposition, it may be allow'd me here. To instance, suppose yourself in any Country in which there was not the least Trace of any human Presence
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>but some very antique and ruin'd Archi∣tecture, what would you conclude? Why that as those Structures were as far as ever you had observ'd, the Effects of Men, this must be so likewise, the Parallel will hold, for it is as certain that subterraneous Fires have broke Hills asunder, and alter'd the Course of Rivers; and that Fire will burn Limestone according to its Degree and Du∣ration, as that Ruins are the Proofs of hu∣man Means: Especially when it is sup∣ported by all the collateral Phaenomena left after such Convulsions.</P>
<P>Now let us see whether we have Ap∣pearance in the present Case to support us. Whoever considers the Situation of the Hot-Well, that it lies between two Preci∣pices, between which also the River runs, will directly imagine that in the Place of this River there was once a continu'd Hill, and that the Chasm was caused by some∣thing preternatural and violent. Add the corresponding Inequalities of the Cliffs on each Side, and that the Heat arises from Lime in the Act of slaking, and that naturally there is no Lime without Fire.

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> DIABETES.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY Disease to which we are sub∣jected must necessarily arise from some Alteration in the Solids or Fluids, a <HI>Diabetes</HI> may arise from either; but I believe the most frequent and most fatal arises from the want of Digestion in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> or from what may be safely enough call'd the Secondary Digestion in the minuter Vessels. My Meaning will be better under∣stood by what follows. Digestion, I ap∣prehend, is nothing more than preparing the Aliments for a Separation to be made by the Lacteals: Now when this Separation is perform'd, and the secreted Chyle brought into the Blood, there remains another Pro∣cess of Nature; which is to assimilate the nutritious and throw off the detrimental Particles by the Kidnies and cuticular Glands. For unless the Urinous Salts <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are se∣creted, it is no more <HI>Nutriment</HI> in the Blood than it was <HI>Chyle</HI> before it was se∣creted from the <HI>Faeces,</HI> and this is what is meant by the Secondary Digestion.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
<P>It follows now, that a Fault in either of these Functions may be the Source of many Distempers, and as it is universally allow'd that the weakest Part suffers in every Assault, there may be various Diseases from one and the same Cause, according as Constitutions are differently disposed to receive Impres∣sions. Particularly suppose any one has spent a Life gay enough, <Q><HI>"Bottle and Friend too much indulging."</HI></Q> Upon any Fault in either of the Functions, a Disease will likely enough fall on the Kidnies, as those have been the Glands mostly distended and weakned by frequent use.</P>
<P>It is notorious also, that the continu'd use of spirituous Liquors indurates all Aliments, and stiffens the Fibres of the Stomach. Nay that Spirit of Wine injected into the Arteries of a living Animal, immediately congeals the Serum, impedes Circulation, and Death en∣sues. This is in some Degree the Case, whenever we indulge too freely in Spi∣rituous Liquors, and at last totally deprives us of Appetite and Digestion. If Di∣gestion then is but illy perform'd in the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> instead of Chyle the Secretion will be crude and imperfect, and conse∣quently the Fault will never be amended when it gets within the Laws of Circula∣tion. Nor will the <HI>Vis Naturae</HI> of itself avail
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>to separate those Salts by the Kidnies; thence it will result, that thro' want of this Separa∣tion there be will no Nutriment assimilated, and an Accumulation of Fluids supervening, the Vessels and Glands are distended, and the Serum, with all the Nutritious Juice, passes off by the Kidnies.</P>
<P>It has been, I know not how, always thought, that a <HI>Diabetes</HI>

<BIBL>SYDENHAMI <HI>Sententia.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> was a too profuse
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>Discharge of Urine. But there cannot be a greater Mistake, the Disorder is not from too great a Discharge of Urine, but quite contrary, because there is no Urine at all discharged, but Serum or Chyle in it's Room: For it is scarce possible to secrete too much Urine, or any natural Secretion, but the Danger ever is, when something that is not the true Secretion is carried off. This holds equally true in <HI>Hectic</HI> Fevers, and pro∣fuse Sweats, and I shall endeavour to shew that <HI>Hectic</HI> Sweats are thro' the Cuticular Glands, what a <HI>Diabetes</HI> is by the Kidnies.</P>
<P>That what has already been said is the true Cause of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> will evidently ap∣pear from the History of that Malady, as laid down by our best Physicians, and every Symptom is easily deduced from that Ori∣ginal. Whoever will take the least trouble to review the above Quotations, will easily deduce every Symptom from the Cause which has been assign'd before; and must observe that the Cure wholly depends upon bringing
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>back the true Secretion of Urine, which is no more than separating the animal Salts from the Fluids, and restoring the Strength and Elasticity of the over-distended Fibres.</P>
<P>There remains now that we examine, if Lime in the Act of slaking will separate those urinous Salts, and whether Alum will restore the Tone of the weaken'd Fibres. What the Effects of Lime will be cannot be better seen than by the XCVIIth Experiment of the learned <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> with his Observa∣tions of it's Use.</P>
<P>Hence are plainly discover'd the Effects of Lime on animal Fluids, and that it exactly executes what a Medicine must do to cure a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> which is to extricate, and prepare an easy Secretion for the more fixed muriatic Salts sticking in the Blood. Let us now suppose that this Separation of the Salts is brought about, what must be added to finish the Cure? It must be some Medicine which may bring the Fibres into a contractile State, and recover that Elasticy they had lost from too great Distention; that Alum will answer in all this Part is notorious; from it's Astrin∣gency it will bring the Stomach into stronger Contractions, and improve Digestion; in the Glands it will lessen the Diameters of the secreting Vessels; in the Arteries it will
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>shorten their Fibres, improve their Spring, and accelerate the Circulation; and as, according to the Laws of Hydrostatics, Fluids circu∣lating in Tubes have their lightest Parts dri∣ven to the Sides, whilst the more heavy are propell'd, the emulgent Arteries lying at right Angles must receive the lightest Parts of the Fluid, and bring it to the Kidnies, which from the aluminous Particles are con∣tracted to let nothing thro' but these Salts dissolved in the aqueous Menstrum, which the Lime had before disengaged.</P>
<P>We can now assign a good Reason for the drinking those Waters warm at the Spring, without being obliged to a Ficton for their Virtues. Since it is demonstrated, that all the salutary Effects arise from the <HI>slaking</HI> Lime, and that after that Action ceases by cooling, it produces no Alteration on animal Solids and Fluids, but as a mere alcaline Earth. The aluminous Part indeed, tho' the same at a Distance as when on the Spot, avails no∣thing without the previous Separation of the Salts, which can be effected by the <HI>slaking</HI> Lime only.</P>
<P>Let us now examine what would have been the Consequences in the foregoing In∣disposition, if the Contents of the Hot-Well
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>had been a subtle Spirit, Nitre, and Lime∣stone Powder; if that had been a Spirit it must be a Mineral one, if a Mineral Spirit an Acid one, now all Mineral Acids coagulate the Blood, and hinder Secretions arising from Alcalescence

<P>BOER. CXXVII. <HI>Exp. Sang.

<P>It may be objected here, that, instead of proceeding on <HI>Boerhave</HI>'s Experiment on Urine, I should have tried whether it would have answer'd with the <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, and if it would not, my Conclusions are all false and supposititious only. Suppose this Ob∣jection true, it has a plausible Appearance, yet upon Examination does not stand the Test.</P>
<P>It is certain we can conceive no Alteration by our Senses in any thing, unless it be
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>strong enough to create a distinct Perception. The Atmosphere differs in Pressure from the heaviest to the lightest many Degrees, yet I believe no one will say that he feels any Di∣minution or Increase of Weight in the Alteration, the Reason is because this Altera∣tion is not a sufficient Avocation to the gene∣ral Attention we must allow the general At∣mosphere. Now with Respect to the <HI>Bristol</HI> Water, were it ten times as strongly impreg∣nated with Lime, it would create a very visible Effect in the foregoing Experiment, but tho' it should not as it is, yet it must not be concluded from thence that it is quite in∣efficacious, we must say notwithstanding that it has every proportional Appearance with the other. Another Instance will better ex∣plain my Meaning. You have a Bundle of Straw under your Arm, I take one secretly from you, yet by the strictest Scrutiny of your Eye and Hand you neither perceive the Weight nor Number much lessen'd; but it is lessen'd in both respects, or the Weight is compounded from an aggregate of no Weights, and the Number of no Numbers, which is impossible. Well then, should I repeat the Theft it will at last appear very plain in both Senses, and you were hinder'd from ob∣serving it in the first, by what was said of the Atmosphere, the Difference was not great enough to create a distinct Perception,
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>and call off your Attention from the greater Weight of the Bundle. The same may be said of the <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, that tho' it should create no perceivable Alteration at any one time taken singly, yet often repeated it would have the same Effects with the other, but in a slower Way.</P>
<P>From the slight Impregnation of Lime, we may easily deduce it's most salutary Effects, as it's Alterations are silently and mildly carried on, without producing those violent Symptoms which would follow from a larger Quantity, as Fevers, Deliriums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the very same is true as to the Quantity of the Alum.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of a</HI> HECTIC FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>IT has already been mention'd, that the Sweats of a <HI>Hectic</HI> were thro' the Mi∣liary Glands, what a <HI>Diabetes</HI> is thro' the Kidnies; and if we attend diligently, we shall find that, like the <HI>Diabetes,</HI> the Dan∣ger in a <HI>Hectic</HI> Fever does not arise from too profuse a Secretion of Sweat, but from the nutritious Particles passing off this way:
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>For there is no Instance of a too large Dis∣charge by Sweat, provided it is really that Secretion. Now what has been said with respect to a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> that there can be no Nutriment assimilated, unless the excremen∣titious Fluids are secern'd, holds true here, for this Reason, all attempts are vain which endeavour to check those <HI>Hectic</HI> Sweats, with∣out altering the Juices, and generating the na∣tural Discharge. Is it not always observ'd as often as you endeavour to stop those Sweats, if you succeed in that particular, a <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> constantly succeeds, equally fatal as the for∣mer Symptom? It has been observ'd by the ingenious Dr <HI>Allen,</HI> that a <HI>Diabetes</HI> and <HI>Ptyalismus</HI> have alternately succeeded the Sup∣pression of each other, and that the Cure of one was the Cure of the other: It is the same in a <HI>Hectic,</HI> if you <HI>cure</HI> the Sweats you suppress the <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> but if you only <HI>de∣rive</HI> it from the Glands of the Skin to those of the Intestines, you have not proceded one Step towards the Patient's Recovery; nor can he possibly recover till he produce the natural Discharges, that the nutritious Particles may be laid aside for the Support of Life, and this seems likely to be effected by the slaking Lime, as in the <HI>Diabetes;</HI> for the Salts of the animal Fluids are the same in every Secretion, and the State of the Fluids
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>the same in each Disorder, only the Secre∣tion passes thro' different Emunctories, ac∣cording as the Constitution is disposed from a particular Texture of the Glands. I need not apply the use of the Alum, because every one will see it's use as plainly here as in the <HI>Diabetes.</HI> There can no Objection arise from the Lime, as if it should produce a pu∣trefact State of the Blood, because then the Salts in the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOER. <HI>Process.</HI> XCVII.</NOTE> Experiment on the Urine would have been Volatile Alkalies, whereas it is neither Acid nor Alcali, but quite a-kin to the Human.</P>
<P>What Advantage may not arise from the Use of this <HI>Bristol</HI> Water, if the Patient would apply to them before he is gone be∣yond the reach of Medicine? Nay, even in the last State of a Pulmonary Consumption I cannot see but it must be serviceable, for it is certain Human Nature cannot be sustain'd without Nutrition, and no Nutrition can be form'd without the previous Separation of the excrementitious Salts: Nor can the Ulcers of the Lungs incarne, unless the true Balsam be brought to them, which I apprehend to be no more than true Nutriment.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
<P>There may be many other Diseases in which it may be beneficial, as in the <HI>Ele∣phantiasis</HI> from a cold Cause, <HI>Chlorosis,</HI> and all <HI>Cachexies,</HI> where the Fluids are too vis∣cous and the Fibres too much relax'd.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE EFFECTS OF THE WATERS IN NEPHRITIC DISORDERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has of late been an Objection to the <HI>Bristol</HI> Waters, that upon the Use of them they have increased the Gravel in those Subjects liable to that Complaint, and for that Reason not to be drank safely by such Persons. A stricter Attention, and a fair State of the Case will set the Matter in a quite opposite Light.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
<P>It has been found by some subject to Ne∣phritic Complaints, that at their first coming to the Well and drinking the Waters, the Paroxysms have oftner succeeded each other, and with more Violence than before, and thence they have concluded that the Waters increase these Disorders: But how unjust is this when we consider that the Pain is not the Disease, but a Consequence of it's passing off by Means of Medicine, or the Efforts of Nature throwing off the already generated Concretions. Suppose any Quantity of Gravel lodg'd in the Bason of the Kidnies, is it not manifest that Pains must succeed upon it's removal from thence thro' the Ureters into the Bladder? And is it not equally certain, that whatever promotes the dislodging this Gravel from the Kidnies is a salutary Medicine? And the more efficacious it is, the oftner the Paroxysms will follow each other, till the whole is brought away? This is directly the Case in the Hot Well Water, and seen in this true Light removes the Objection.</P>
<P>Now let us see whether our Theory will not vindicate this Fact. Every one allows that Nephitic Diseases arise from some Fault in the Urinary Secretion; it has been already experimentally observ'd, that <HI>slaking Lime</HI> produces that true Secretion; hence it follows that no Alterative can be more suc∣cessfully
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>pursued than this Medicinal Water, since it washes off the already concreted Gravel, and hinders it from being generated a-new, by producing the genuine Discharge.</P>
<P>It does not belong to me to say what Medicine or Diet is best adapted in each Case with these Waters, whatever Physician shall have the Care of those that drink this Medicinal Water, will inform them in these and many other things, altogether beyond any thing that can be said by me.</P>
