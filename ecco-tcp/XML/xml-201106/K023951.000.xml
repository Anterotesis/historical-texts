<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE APOTHECARIES.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent the Mischiefs arising from Ignorance, or Temerity in the <HI>Admini∣stration</HI> of Medicines, King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, by his Charter established the COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, <HI>excluding</HI> all Persons, who should not be lisenced by them, from the Practice of Physick within <HI>London,</HI> and seven Miles thereof: Which Charter was soon afterwards confirmed by <HI>Parliament,</HI> and the said <HI>Exclusion</HI> from Practice extended all over <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And to prevent the like Mischiefs in the <HI>Preparation</HI> of Medicines, the said Col∣lege were by subsequent Acts directed to elect, yearly, <HI>Four</HI> of their Fellows, who, after taking an Oath of Office, were impowered (with the Assistance of the Wardens of the Company of Grocers and Apothecaries) to visit all Apothecaries Houses within <HI>London</HI> only, and to destroy such Drugs and Medicines as they should find defective; which Power of <HI>Visitation</HI> was afterwards, by a Charter of King <HI>James</HI> the Ist, ex∣tended to the Distance of <HI>seven</HI> Miles round <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Exercise of this last Power being limitted to four Persons, the same ap∣peared to <HI>Sir Theodore De Mayerne,</HI> and <HI>Henry Atkins,</HI> Physicians to King <HI>James</HI> the Ist (and who, being the then <HI>most illustrious</HI> Members of the College, may be supposed to declare the Sense of the whole Body) so very insufficient for suppressing the variety of Abuses intended to be remedied, that at <HI>their</HI> Desire, and for the <HI>more effectually</HI> preventing those Abuses, the said King very soon after, by another Charter, formed the Apothecaries of <HI>London</HI> into a distinct Society, with the like Powers of Visitation, and expressly <HI>prohibited</HI> all Persons from exercising the Business of an Apothecary with∣in seven Miles of <HI>London,</HI> unless first examined, approved, and licensed by the said <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE it is that the <HI>Validity</HI> of the said Charter being doubtful, and the <HI>Extent</HI> of the Powers thereby granted uncertain, and there being no Provision for rectifying any <HI>Abuse</HI> of those Powers, the said <HI>Society</HI> have ever been very cautious in the Exercise thereof, and of late Years especially, have kept up the <HI>Form</HI> only of a <HI>Visitation:</HI> Whence it has happened, that several ignorant, and illiterate Persons have been encouraged to en∣ter upon the Business of an Apothecary, whilst others, of perhaps a more regular <HI>Edu∣cation,</HI> and better <HI>Knowledge,</HI> have in order to engross the Trade, by under-selling the fair Apothecary, ventured to compound their Medicines of damaged, stale, and coun∣terfeit Ingredients; so that upon the whole, great Quantities of pernicious Medicines have been sold in the Neighbourhood of <HI>London,</HI> and transmitted into all Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THESE Practices being notorious, the College in 1722, procured the Act of Parlia∣ment (now proposed to be revived) to establish their Power of Visitation agreeable to their Charter. But a Clause having, upon their Attempt to obtain a Bill for reviving the said Act in 1729, been added by a Committee of the House of Commons [for granting an Appeal from the Judgment of the Censors to six Physicians and six Apo∣thecaries to be determined upon Oath, and in Case of Equality of Voices, by the Opi∣nion of the President or Vice-President of the College] the said Bill was drop'd, and the College have not since thought proper to apply for any Bill of that kind, notwith∣standing the Continuance and daily Increase of the bad Practices above-mentioned.</P>
<P>AT length several Apothecaries, [whose Profession affords them but too frequent Op∣portunities of observing the Extent and mischievous Effects of those bad Practices,] thought it their Duty, as well in Regard to the <HI>Publick,</HI> as themselves, to represent the same to the LEGISLATURE.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>IN Consequence of this Application, the House of Commons have been pleased to order in a Bill, to revive, <HI>explain, and amend</HI> the said Act passed in 1722. From which Order the said Petitioners conceive that honourable House was satisfied of the <HI>Insuffici∣ency</HI> of a mere <HI>Revival</HI> of the said Act, and therefore they submit the following <HI>Amendments</HI> or <HI>Alterations,</HI> as what they humbly apprehend will render the said Act <HI>most effectual</HI> on the one Hand, and prevent any <HI>Abuse</HI> of the Powers thereby granted on the other, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT the Court of Assistants of the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> shall yearly elect ten suffici∣ently skillful Persons to be called <HI>Examiners of Apothecaries,</HI> and forty-eight (or any other competent Number) to be called <HI>Examiners of Medicines,</HI> who shall all be <HI>sworn</HI> to the due Execution of their respective Offices.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT for the Future no Person (except the present Members of the Society, who have been already examined) shall, within seven Miles of <HI>London,</HI> exercise the Art of an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> unless first examined, and approved by three, or more of the said <HI>Examiners of Apothecaries,</HI> and licensed to exercise the same by Let∣ters Testimonial, under the Seal of the said <HI>Society.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THAT any Person rejected by the said <HI>Examiners</HI> may have an Appeal to the President, and Censors of the <HI>College,</HI> and if approved by them, shall be licenced by the said <HI>Society.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. THAT there shall be paid to the said <HI>Society</HI> for every Examination and Li∣cence <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and no more; and that every such licensed Person shall, during his Continuance in the Business, pay (as the Freemen of the said Society do) the yearly Sum of six Shillings, to be <HI>appropriated</HI> to the supporting the <HI>Botannical</HI> Garden at <HI>Chelsea,</HI> to which he, and his Apprentices shall have Liberty to resort, for their Instruction in <HI>Botany.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. THAT (in lieu of the said Censors) the said <HI>Examiners of Medicines,</HI> or any four of them, shall have Power, whensoever they shall think fit (and be obliged, as often as the Court of Assistants shall think proper) to go upon the Vi∣sitation, and thereupon to enter any House <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of any Person within the Limits aforesaid, who shall prepare, or keep for Sale, any <HI>compound Medicines,</HI> and to examine the same, and <HI>destroy</HI> such as they shall adjudge bad.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. THAT any Person shall have Liberty to appeal from the Judgment of the said <HI>Examiners,</HI> to the said <HI>President,</HI> or <HI>Vice-President,</HI> and <HI>Censors,</HI> whose Deter∣mination shall be <HI>final,</HI> the Medicine complained of to be, in the mean Time, conveyed to the <HI>College.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. THAT in all Cases of Appeal the said <HI>Examiners,</HI> as well as the Parties <HI>ap∣pellant,</HI> may produce Witnesses to be examined upon <HI>Oath,</HI> either as to their Knowledge, or Opinion of the Preparation in question.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. THAT every Person convicted by the said <HI>Examiners</HI> (unless their Judgment is reversed within <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>) of selling or keeping for Sale, any <HI>adulterated</HI> or <HI>per∣nicious</HI> Medicine shall forfeit the Sum of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. THAT Persons obstructing the said <HI>Examiners</HI> in the Execution of their Office shall forfeit the Sum of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></ITEM>
<ITEM>X. THAT all Penalties shall go, one half to <HI>any Person</HI> who will sue for the same, and the other half to the <HI>Poor</HI> of the Parish where the Offender shall reside.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THESE <HI>Amendments,</HI> the Petitioners humbly conceive, will appear to be proper, and <HI>neces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary,</HI> for the following Reasons, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the four <HI>Censor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> who must be presumed to be, as the Law requires, the <HI>best learned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>est, and most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of their Profession, and consequently most employed,) cannot spare sufficient <HI>Leisure</HI> to attend the Visitation, so diligently, and <HI>frequently</HI> as they ought, without great Loss to themselves, and to the <HI>Publick,</HI> who may want their Assistance in another Way.</P>
<P>THAT their <HI>Number,</HI> even if they were to give their <HI>utmost</HI> Attention, and dedicate their <HI>whole</HI> Time to this Duty, would not be sufficient to visit <HI>all</HI> Apothecaries Shops within <HI>London,</HI> and seven Miles thereof, which upon a fair Computation, will appear to be upwards of a Thousand.</P>
<P>THAT the original Jurisdiction, and the Determination on the Appeal ought not to be in the <HI>same</HI> Body, the Members of which may be supposed tender of each other's Re∣putation, and the general Character of their <HI>Community.</HI></P>
<P>THAT neither the <HI>Censors</HI> in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Instance, nor the <HI>President,</HI> and <HI>Fellows</HI> upon the <HI>Appeal,</HI> are by the said Act put under the Restriction of any particular <HI>Oath.</HI></P>
<P>THAT by the said Act no Provision is made for preventing Persons from entering upon the Business of <HI>Pharmacy</HI> who have not been properly instructed therein, and
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>who consequently require a much stricter and more frequent Visitation than any <HI>reason∣able</HI> Number of Visitors can possibly attend.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>only</HI> Punishment provided by the said Act for keeping any adulterated, or pernicious Medicine for Sale, is the <HI>destroying</HI> it, which in most Instances (as Med∣icines are principally adulterated for the sake of saving the <HI>expensive</HI> Ingredients) is a very <HI>trifling</HI> Punishment, by no Means adequate to the <HI>Offence.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Alterations</HI> in the Act (it is humbly conceived) will answer all the salutary Intentions of the honourable <HI>House of Commons,</HI> and yet preserve to the Society of <HI>Apo∣thecaries,</HI> the Privileges granted to them by their <HI>Charter; Privileges!</HI> so far from be∣ing unreasonable in their own Nature, that <HI>Parliament</HI> has thought proper to grant, or confirm the like to the <HI>College</HI> of <HI>Physicians,</HI> and Company of <HI>Surgeons;</HI> and that, with∣out any of those <HI>Guards</HI> against the <HI>Abuse</HI> of Power, which the Petitioners propose, and desire may be provided in <HI>their</HI> Case; nor can the said <HI>College,</HI> and <HI>Company</HI> but ap∣prove, in the Society of <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> a Constitution which, in their <HI>own</HI> respective Bo∣dies, they have, by long Experience, found to be highly beneficial to the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>WITH respect to the <HI>College,</HI> it is true the Power of <HI>Visitation,</HI> which has hitherto been exercised by their <HI>Censors,</HI> and the Wardens of the Society of <HI>Apothecaries</HI> in <HI>Conjunction,</HI> is by these <HI>Alterations</HI> proposed to be wholly vested in sworn Examiners of the said <HI>Society.</HI> But then in lieu thereof, the said College are intended to be vested with a <HI>superior</HI> Jurisdiction, and Controul, which the Petitioners humbly conceive is more suitable, not only to the Convenience, but Dignity of that learned <HI>Body;</HI> and from the above-mentioned Testimony of <HI>Sir Theodore de Mayerne</HI> and <HI>Dr. Atkins,</HI> as well as from the Nature of the Thing itself, it appears that the Apothecaries are very properly qualified for the <HI>Visitation</HI> hereby proposed to be entrusted with them.</P>
<P>As to the Persons who will be immediately affected by the <HI>Examination</HI> intended by these Amendments,—It is submitted whether it can be thought an <HI>Hardship</HI> to oblige those who will engage in a Profession, of so much Consequence to the Publick, to give a Test of their Ability and Fitness for it; and as they will become intituled to se∣veral of the <HI>Privileges,</HI> without being subject to the many burthensome and expen∣sive <HI>Offices</HI> of the said Society, it is but reasonable that they should contribute <HI>something</HI> towards defraying the <HI>additional</HI> Expences which these new Duties will occasion.</P>
<P>THE Application of the yearly Sum of six Shillings (it is likewise hoped) will be thought so very useful to the <HI>Publick,</HI> that no Objection can be made to so <HI>trifling</HI> a Demand.</P>
<P>THE said <HI>Society</HI> do (at an Expence too great for their present Circumstances) endeavour to maintain a Botanical Garden, which the Munificence of that great Patron of na∣tural and useful Knowledge, <HI>Sir Hans Sloane,</HI> has enabled them to establish: A Matter in several <HI>foreign</HI> Cities, thought worthy of the <HI>Publick</HI> Care. At this Garden, (at pre∣sent furnished with as great a Number of <HI>Plants</HI> as perhaps any in <HI>Europe</HI>) a De∣monstrator is appointed by the <HI>Society,</HI> to instruct their Members, and Pupils in this ne∣cessary Branch of <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> and to superintend, at proper Times, <HI>Herborizations</HI> in the Neighbourhood of <HI>London;</HI> of all which Advantages the said <HI>Licentiates</HI> and their Apprentices will be entitled to partake.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the <HI>Petitioners</HI> humbly hope the Publick will, by these Proposals, be satisfied that they have no <HI>unreasonable</HI> Views of enriching the <HI>Society,</HI> of which they are Members, or of procuring any particular Advantage to <HI>themselves;</HI> their sole <HI>Intention,</HI> in offering to take this <HI>Burthen</HI> upon them, being that they may contribute as much as in them lies to the preventing <HI>Frauds</HI> in their Profession. And as a Proof that they have no <HI>oppressive</HI> Views, they decline no <HI>Appeal</HI> to any Jurisdiction the <HI>Legislature</HI> shall think proper, not desiring to be trusted with a Power over <HI>others,</HI> which they would be sorry to see granted to any, over <HI>themselves:</HI> neither do they wish for more than a temporary <HI>Probation</HI> of their Scheme, that so, if it shall be found <HI>hurtful</HI> or ineffectual, it may not be intailed upon <HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
