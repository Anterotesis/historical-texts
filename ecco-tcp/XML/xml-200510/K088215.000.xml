<HEAD>A
DEFENCE
OF
FREE-THINKING
IN
MATHEMATICS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I read your Defence of
the <HI>British</HI> Mathematicians,
I could not, Sir, but admire
your Courage in asserting with
such undoubting Assurance
things so easily disproved. This to me
seemed unaccountable, till I reflected on
what you say (<HI>p.</HI> 32.) when upon my having
appealed to every thinking Reader, whe∣ther
it be possible to frame any clear Con∣ception
of Fluxions, you express yourself
in the following manner, "Pray, Sir,
who are those thinking Readers you ap∣peal
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
to? Are they Geometricians, or
Persons wholly ignorant of Geometry?
If the former, I leave it to them: If the
latter, I ask how well are they qualified
to judge of the Method of Fluxions"?
It must be acknowledged you seem by this
Dilemma secure in the favour of one Part
of your Readers, and the ignorance of the
other. I am nevertheless persuaded there
are fair and candid Men among the Ma∣thematicians.
And for those who are not
Mathematicians, I shall endeavour so to
unveil this Mystery, and put the Contro∣versy
between us in such a Light, as
that every Reader of ordinary Sense and
Reflection may be a competent Judge
thereof.</P>
<P N="2">II. "YOU express an extreme Surprize
and Concern, that I should take so
much Pains to depreciate one of the no∣blest
Sciences, to disparage and traduce
a Set of learned Men, whose Labours
so greatly conduce to the Honour of
this Island, (<HI>p.</HI> 5.) to lessen the Repu∣tation
and Authority of Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI>
and his Followers, by shewing that
they are not such Masters of Reason as
they are generally presumed to be; and
to depreciate the Science they profess,
by demonstrating to the World, that it
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
is not of the Clearness and Certainty as
is commonly imagined. All which, you
insist, appears very strange to you and
the rest of that famous University, who
plainly see of how great Use Mathema∣tical
Learning is to Mankind." Hence
you take occasion to declaim on the
Usefulness of Mathematics in the several
Branches, and then to redouble your Sur∣prize
and Amazement (<HI>p.</HI> 19. and 20.). To
all which Declamation I reply, that it is
quite beside the Purpose. For I allow,
and always have allowed, its full claim of
Merit to whatever is useful and true in
the Mathematics: But that which is not
so, the less it employs Men's time and
thoughts, the better. And after all you
have said or can say, I believe the unpreju∣diced
Reader will think with me, that things
obscure are not therefore sacred; and that
it is no more a Crime to canvass and de∣tect
unsound Principles or false Reasonings
in Mathematics, than in any other Part
of Learning.</P>
<P N="3">III. YOU are, it seems, much at a loss
to understand the Usefulness or Tendency
or Prudence of my Attempt. I thought I
had sufficiently explained this in the <HI>Ana∣lyst.</HI>
But for your further Satisfaction shall
here tell you, it is very well known, that
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
several Persons who deride Faith and Mys∣teries
in Religion, admit the Doctrine of
Fluxions for true and certain. Now if it be
shewn that Fluxions are really most incom∣prehensible
Mysteries, and that those, who
believe them to be clear and scientific, do
entertain an implicite Faith in the Author
of that Method; will not this furnish a fair
<HI>Argumentum ad Hominem</HI> against Men, who
reject that very thing in Religion which they
admit in human Learning? And is it not a
proper Way to abate the Pride, and discredit
the Pretensions of those, who insist upon
clear Ideas in Points of Faith, if it be shewn
that they do without them even in
Science?</P>
<P N="4">IV. AS to my timeing this Charge; why
now and not before, since I had published
Hints thereof many Years ago? Surely I
am obliged to give no Account of this: If
what hath been said in the Analyst be not
sufficient; suppose that I had not Leisure,
or that I did not think it expedient, or that
I had no Mind to it. When a Man thinks
fit to publish any Thing, either in Mathe∣matics,
or in any other Part of Learning;
what avails it, or indeed what Right hath
any one to ask, why at this or that Time;
in this or that Manner; upon this or that
Motive? Let the Reader judge, if it suffice
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
not, that what I publish is true, and that I
have a Right to publish such Truths, when
and how I please, in a free Country.</P>
<P N="5">V. I DO not say, that Mathematicians,
as such, are Infidels; or that Geometry is
a Friend to Infidelity; which you untruly
insinuate, as you do many other Things;
whence you raise Topics for invective: But
I say there are certain Mathematicians, who
are known to be so; and that there are o∣thers,
who are not Mathematicians, who
are influenced by a Regard for their Au∣thority.
Some, perhaps, who live in the
University, may not be apprised of this;
but the intelligent and observing Reader,
who lives in the World, and is acquainted
with the Humour of the Times, and the
Characters of Men, is well aware, there
are too many that deride Mysteries, and
yet admire Fluxions; who yield that Faith
to a mere Mortal, which they deny to
<HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whose Religion they make it
their Study and Business to discredit. The
owning this is not to own, that Men who
reason well, are Enemies to Religion, as you
would represent it: On the contrary, I en∣deavour
to shew, that such Men are defec∣tive
in Point of Reason and Judgment, and
that they do the very Thing they would
seem to despise.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
VI. THERE are, I make no doubt,
among the Mathematicians many sincere
Believers in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>; I know several
such my self; but I addressed my Analyst
to an Infidel; and on very good Grounds,
I supposed that besides him, there were
other Deriders of Faith, who had never∣theless
a profound Veneration for Fluxions;
and I was willing to set forth the Incon∣sistence
of such Men. If there be no such
Thing as Infidels, who pretend to Knowledge
in the modern Analysis, I own my self misin∣formed,
and shall gladly be found in a Mis∣take;
but even in that Case, my Remarks
upon Fluxions are not the less true; nor
will it follow, that I have no Right to exa∣mine
them on the Foot of humane Science,
even though Religion were quite uncon∣cerned,
and though I had no End to serve
but Truth. But you are very angry (<HI>P.</HI> 13
<HI>and</HI> 14.) that I should enter the Lists with
reasoning Infidels, and attack them upon
their Pretensions to Science: And hence
you take Occasion to shew your Spleen a∣gainst
the Clergy. I will not take upon me
to say, that I know you to be a Minute
Philosopher your self: But I know, the
Minute Philosophers make just such Com∣pliments
as you do to our Church, and are
just as angry, as you can be, at any who un∣dertake
to defend Religion by Reason. If
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
we resolve all into Faith, they laugh at us
and our Faith: And if we attempt to Rea∣son,
they are angry at us: They pretend
we go out of our Province, and they re∣commend
to us a blind implicite Faith.
Such is the Inconsistence of our Adversaries.
But it is to be hoped, there will never be
wanting Men to deal with them at their
own Weapons; and to shew, they are by
no Means those Masters of Reason, which
they would fain pass for.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I DO not say, as you would repre∣sent
me, that we have no better Reason for
our Religion, than you have for Fluxions:
But I say, that an Infidel, who believes the
Doctrine of Fluxions, acts a very incon∣sistent
Part, in pretending to reject the
Christian Religion, because he cannot be∣lieve
what he doth not comprehend; or be∣cause
he cannot assent without Evidence;
or because he cannot submit his Faith to
Authority. Whether there are such Infidels,
I submit to the Judgment of the Reader.
For my own Part I make no Doubt of it,
having seen some shrewd Signs thereof my
self, and having been very credibly informed
thereof by others. Nor doth this Charge
seem the less credible, for your being so sen∣sibly
touched, and denying it with so much
Passion. You, indeed, do not stick to affirm,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
that the persons, who informed me are <HI>a
pack of base, profligate, and impudent liars,</HI>
(<HI>P.</HI> 27.) How far the Reader will think fit
to adopt your passions, I cannot say; but I
can truly say, the late celebrated Mr <HI>Ad∣dison</HI>
is one of the persons, whom you are
pleased to characterize in those modest and
mannerly terms. He assured me that the In∣fidelity
of a certain noted Mathematician,
still living, was one principal reason assign∣ed
by a witty man of those times for his
being an Infidel. Not, that I imagine Geo∣metry
disposeth Men to Infidelity; but that
from other causes, such as Presumption, Ig¦norance,
or Vanity, like other Men, Geo∣metricians
also become Infidels, and that
the supposed light and evidence of their
Science gains credit to their Infidelity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. "YOU reproach me with Ca∣lumny,
detraction and artifice (<HI>P.</HI> 15.)
You recommend such means as are in∣nocent
and just, rather than the crimi∣nal
method of lessening or detracting
from my opponents (<HI>ibid.</HI>) You accuse
me of the <HI>Odium Theologicum,</HI> the in∣temperate
Zeal of Divines, that I do
<HI>stare super vias antiquas,</HI>" (<HI>P.</HI> 13.) with
much more to the same effect. For all
which charge I depend on the reader's
candour, that he will not take your word,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
but read and judge for himself. In which
case he will be able to discern (though he
should be no Mathematician) how passio∣nate
and unjust your reproaches are, and
how possible it is for a Man to cry out
against Calumny and practise it in the
same breath. Considering how impatient
all Mankind are when their prejudices are
looked into, I do not wonder to see you
rail and rage at the rate you do. But if
your own Imagination be strongly shocked
and moved, you cannot therefore conclude,
that a sincere endeavour to free a science,
so useful and ornamental to Humane Life,
from those subtilties, obscurities, and para∣doxes,
which render it inaccessible to most
Men, will be thought a criminal under∣taking
by such as are in their right Mind.
Much less can you hope that an illustrious
seminary of Learned Men, which hath
produced so many free-spirited inquirers af∣ter
Truth, will at once enter into your pas∣sions,
and degenerate into a nest of Bigots.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I OBSERVE upon the Incon∣sistency
of certain Infidel Analysts. I re∣mark
some defects in the principles of the
modern Analysis. I take the liberty de∣cently
to dissent from Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> I
propose some helps to abridge the trouble
of Mathematical Studies, and render them
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
more useful. What is there in all this,
that should make you declaim on the use∣fulness
of practical Mathematics? that
should move you to cry out <HI>Spain, Inqui∣sition,
Odium Theologicum</HI>? By what figure
of Speech, do you extend, what is said of
the modern Analysis, to Mathematics in
general, or what is said of Mathematical
Infidels to all Mathematicians, or the con∣futing
an errour in Science to burning or
hanging the Authors? But it is nothing
new or strange, that Men should choose to
indulge their passions, rather than quit
their opinions how absurd soever. Hence
the frightful visions and tragical uproars of
Bigotted Men, be the Subject of their Bi∣gotry
what it will. A very remarkable in∣stance
of this you give (<HI>P.</HI> 27.) where,
upon my having said that a deference to
certain Mathematical Infidels, as I was
credibly informed, had been one motive to
Infidelity, you ask with no small emotion,
"For God's sake are we in <HI>England</HI> or in
<HI>Spain</HI>? Is this the language of a Fami∣liar
who is whispering an Inquisitor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"
And, the page before, you exclaim in the
following Words; "Let us burn or hang
up all the Mathematicians in <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> or halloo the mob upon them to
tear them to pieces every Mother's Son
of them, <HI>Tros Rutulusve fuat,</HI> Laymen
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
or Clergymen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let us dig up the
bodies of Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> and Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> and burn them under the Gal∣lows."</P>
<P N="10">X. THE Reader need not be a Ma∣thematician,
to see how vain all this Tra∣gedy
of yours is. And if he be as tho∣roughly
satisfied as I am, that the cause
of Fluxions cannot be defended by rea∣son,
he will be as little surprised as I am,
to see you betake your self to the arts of
all bigotted men, raising terror, and cal∣ling
in the passions to your assistance.
Whether those Rhetorical flourishes about
the Inquisition and the Gallows are not
quite ridiculous, I leave to be determined
by the Reader. Who will also judge
(though he should not be skilled in Geo∣metry)
whether I have given the least
grounds for this and a World of such
like declamation? and whether I have not
constantly treated those celebrated Wri∣ters,
with all proper respect, though I
take the liberty in certain points to differ
from them?</P>
<P N="11">XI. AS I heartily abhor an Inquisition
in Faith, so I think you have no right to
erect one in Science. At the time of wri∣ting
your defence, you seem to have been
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
overcome with Passion: But now you
may be supposed cool, I desire you to re∣flect
whether it be not wrote in the true
spirit of an Inquisitor? Whether this be∣comes
a Person so exceeding delicate him∣self
upon that Point? And whether your
Brethren the <HI>Analysts</HI> will think them∣selves
honoured or obliged by you, for
having defended their Doctrine, in the
same manner as any declaiming Bigot
would defend Transubstantiation? The
same false colours, the same intemperate
Sallies, and the same Indignation against
common Sense!</P>
<P N="12">XII. IN a matter of mere Science,
where authority hath nothing to do, you
constantly endeavour to overbear me with
authorities, and load me with envy. If I
see a Sophism in the writings of a great
Author, and, in compliment to his un∣derstanding,
suspect he could hardly be
quite satisfy'd with his own demonstra∣tion:
This sets you on declaiming for
several pages. It is pompously set forth,
as a criminal method of detracting from
great men, as a concerted project to lessen
their reputation, as making them pass for
impostors. If I publish my free thoughts,
which I have as much right to publish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any other man, it is imputed to rash∣ness
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
and vanity and the love of opposition.
Though perhaps my late publication, of
what had been hinted twenty five years
ago, may acquit me of this charge in the
eyes of an impartial Reader. But when I
consider the perplexities that beset a man,
who undertakes to defend the doctrine
of Fluxions, I can easily forgive your
anger.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. TWO sorts of learned men there
are; one, who candidly seek Truth by
rational means. These are never averse
to have their principles looked into, and
examined by the test of Reason. Ano∣ther
sort there is, who learn by <HI>route</HI> a
set of principles and a way of thinking
which happen to be in vogue. These
betray themselves by their anger and sur∣prise,
whenever their principles are freely
canvassed. But you must not expect, that
your Reader will make himself a party to
your passions or your prejudices. I freely
own that Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> hath shew'd
himself an extraordinary Mathematician,
a profound Naturalist, a Person of the
greatest Abilities and Erudition. Thus far
I can readily go, but I cannot go the
lengths that you do. I shall never say of
him as you do, <HI>Vestigia pronus adoro,</HI>
(<HI>p.</HI> 70.) This same adoration that you pay
to him, I will pay only to Truth.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
XIV. YOU may, indeed, your self be
an Idolater of whom you please: But
then you have no right to insult and ex∣claim
at other men, because they do not
adore your Idol. Great as Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI>
was, I think he hath, on more occa∣sions
than one, shew'd himself not to be
infallible. Particularly, his demonstration
of the Doctrine of Fluxions I take to be
defective, and I cannot help thinking that
he was not quite pleased with it himself.
And yet this doth not hinder but the me∣thod
may be useful, considered as an art
of Invention. You, who are a Mathema∣tician,
must acknowledge, there have been
divers such methods admitted in Mathe∣matics,
which are not demonstrative. Such,
for instance, are the Inductions of Doctor
<HI>Wallis</HI> in his Arithmetic of Infinites, and
such, what <HI>Harriot</HI> and, after him, <HI>Des∣cartes</HI>
have wrote concerning the roots of
affected Aequations. It will not, neverthe∣less,
thence follow that those methods are
useless; but only, that they are not to
be allowed of as Premisses in a strict
Demonstration.</P>
<P N="15">XV. NO great Name upon earth shall
ever make me accept things obscure for
clear, or Sophisms for Demonstrations.
Nor may you ever hope to deter me from
freely speaking what I freely think, by
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
those arguments <HI>ab invidia</HI> which at every
turn you employ against me. You re∣present
your self (<HI>P.</HI> 52.) as a man, <HI>whose
highest Ambition is in the lowest degree to
imitate Sir</HI> Isaac Newton. It might, per∣haps,
have suited better with your appel∣lation
of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> and been altogether
as laudable, if your highest ambition had
been to discover Truth. Very consistently
with the character you give of your self,
you speak of it as a sort of crime (<HI>P.</HI> 70.)
to think it possible, you should ever <HI>see
further, or go beyond Sir</HI> Isaac Newton.
And I am persuaded you speak the Senti∣ments
of many more besides your self.
But there are others who are not afraid to
sift the Principles of human Science, who
think it no honour to imitate the greatest
man in his Defects, who even think it no
crime to desire to know, not only beyond
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> but beyond all Mankind.
And whoever thinks otherwise, I appeal
to the Reader, whether he can properly be
called a Philosopher.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. BECAUSE I am not guilty
of your mean Idolatry, you inveigh against
me as a person conceited of my own Abi∣lities;
not considering that a person of less
Abilities may know more on a certain
point than one of greater; not consider∣ing
that a purblind eye, in a close and
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
narrow view, may discern more of a thing,
than a much better eye in a more exten∣sive
prospect; not considering that this is
to fix a <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> to put a stop to all
future inquiries; Lastly, not considering
that this is in fact, so much as in you lies,
converting the Republick of Letters into
an absolute Monarchy, that it is even in∣troducing
a kind of Philosophic Popery
among a free People.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. I HAVE said (and I venture still
to say) that a Fluxion is incomprehensible:
That second, third, and fourth Fluxions are
yet more incomprehensible: That it is not
possible to conceive a simple Infinitesimal,
that it is yet less possible to conceive an In∣finitesimal
of an Infinitesimal, and so on∣ward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analyst,</HI> Sect. 4. 5, 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.
What have you to say in answer to
this? Do you attempt to clear up the noti∣on
of a Fluxion or a Difference? Nothing
like it; "you only assure me (upon your
bare word) from your own experience, and
that of several others whom you could
name, that the Doctrine of Fluxions
may be clearly conceived and distinctly
comprehended; and that if I am puz∣zled
about it and do not understand it,
yet others do". But can you think, Sir,
I shall take your word when I refuse to
take your Master's?</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
XVIII. UPON this point every Rea∣der
of common sense may judge as well as
the most profound Mathematician. The
simple apprehension of a thing defined is
not made more perfect by any subsequent
progress in Mathematics. What any man
evidently knows, he knows as well as you
or Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> And every one can
know whether the object of this method
be (as you would have us think) clearly
conceivable. To judge of this, no depth
of Science is requisite, but only a bare at∣tention
to what passes in his own mind.
And the same is to be understood of all
definitions in all Sciences whatsoever. In
none of which can it be supposed, that
a man of Sense and Spirit will take any
definition or principle upon trust, with∣out
sifting it to the bottom, and trying
how far he can or he cannot conceive it.
This is the course I have taken and shall
take, however you and your Brethren may
declaim against it, and place it in the most
invidious Light.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. IT is usual with you to admo∣nish
me to look over a second time, to
consult, examine, weigh the words of Sir
<HI>Isaac.</HI> In answer to which I will ven∣ture
to say, that I have taken as much
pains as (I sincerely believe) any man
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
living, to understand that great Author,
and to make sense of his principles. No
industry nor caution nor attention, I assure
you, have been wanting on my part. So
that, if I do not understand him, it is not
my fault but my misfortune. Upon other
subjects you are pleased to compliment me
with depth of thought and uncommon
abilities, (<HI>P.</HI> 5. and 84.) But I freely own,
I have no pretence to those things. The
only advantage I pretend to, is that I have
always thought and judged for my self.
And, as I never had a master in Mathe∣matics,
so I fairly followed the dictates of
my own mind in examining, and censu∣ring
the authors I read upon that subject,
with the same freedom that I used upon
any other; taking nothing upon trust, and
believing that no writer was infallible.
And a man of moderate parts, who takes
this painful course in studying the prin∣ciples
of any Science, may be supposed
to walk more surely than those of greater
abilities, who set out with more speed and
less care.</P>
<P N="20">XX. WHAT I insist on is, that the
idea of a Fluxion, simply considered, is
not at all improved or amended by any
progress, though ever so great, in the Ana∣lysis:
neither are the demonstrations of the
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
general rules of that method at all cleared
up by applying them. The reason of
which is, because in operating or calculat∣ing,
men do not return to contemplate the
original principles of the method, which
they constantly presuppose, but are em∣ployed
in working, by notes and symbols,
denoting the Fluxions supposed to have
been at first explained, and according to
rules supposed to have been at first de∣monstrated.
This I say to encourage
those, who are not far gone in these
Studies, to use intrepidly their own judg∣ment,
without a blind or a mean de∣ference
to the best of Mathematicians, who
are no more qualify'd than they are, to
judge of the simple apprehension, or the
evidence of what is delivered in the first
elements of the method; men by further
and frequent use or exercise becoming only
more accustomed to the symbols and rules,
which doth not make either the foregoing
notions more clear, or the foregoing proofs
more perfect. Every Reader of common
sense, that will but use his faculties, knows
as well as the most profound Analyst what
idea he frames or can frame of Velocity
without motion, or of motion without ex∣tension,
of magnitude which is neither fi∣nite
nor infinite, or of a quantity having
no magnitude which is yet divisible, of a
figure where there is no space, of proporti∣on
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
between nothings, or of a real product
from nothing multiplied by something. He
need not be far gone in Geometry to know,
that obscure principles are not to be ad∣mitted
in Demonstration: That if a man
destroys his own Hypothesis, he at the
same time destroys what was built upon it:
That error in the premises, not rectified,
must produce error in the conclusion.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. IN my opinion the greatest men
have their Prejudices. Men learn the ele∣ments
of Science from others: And every
learner hath a deference more or less to
authority, especially the young learners,
few of that kind caring to dwell long up∣on
principles, but inclining rather to take
them upon trust: And things early admit∣ted
by repetition become familiar: And
this familiarity at length passeth for Evi∣dence.
Now to me it seems, there are
certain points tacitly admitted by Mathe∣maticians,
which are neither evident nor
true. And such points or principles ever
mixing with their reasoning do lead them
into paradoxes and perplexities. If the
great author of the fluxionary method was
early imbued with such notions, it would
only shew he was a man. And if by vir∣tue
of some latent error in his principles
a man be drawn into fallacious reasonings,
it is nothing strange that he should take
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
them for true: And, nevertheless, if; when
urged by perplexities and uncouth conse∣quences,
and driven to arts and shifts, he
should entertain some doubt thereof, it is
no more than, one may naturally suppose,
might befall a great genious grappling with
an insuperable difficulty: Which is the
light in which I have placed Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analyst,</HI> Sect. xviij</NOTE>.
Herereupon you are pleased to re∣mark,
that I represent the great author
not only as a weak but an ill man, as a
Deceiver and an Impostor. The Reader will
judge how justly.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. AS to the rest of your colourings
and glosses, your reproaches and insults
and outcries, I shall pass them over, on∣ly
desiring the Reader not to take your
word, but read what I have written, and
he will want no other answer. It hath
been often observed that the worst cause
produceth the greatest clamour, and in∣deed
you are so clamorous throughout
your defence that the Reader, although
he should be no Mathematician, provided
he understands common sense and hath
observed the ways of men, will be apt to
suspect you are in the wrong. It should
seem, therefore, that your Brethren the
Analysts are but little obliged to you, for
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
this new method of declaiming in Mathe∣matics.
Whether they are more obliged
by your Reasoning I shall now examine.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. YOU ask me (<HI>p.</HI> 32.) where I
find Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> using such expressions
as the Velocities of Velocities, the second,
third, and fourth Velocities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This you
set forth as a pious fraud and unfair repre∣sentation.
I answer, that if according to
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> a Fluxion be the veloci∣ty
of an increment, then according to him
I may call the Fluxion of a Fluxion the Ve∣locity
of a Velocity. But for the truth of the
antecedent see his introduction to the Qua∣drature
of Curves, where his own words are,
<HI>motuum velincrementorum velocitates nominan∣do
Fluxiones.</HI> See also the second Lemma of
the second Book of his mathematical prin∣ciples
of natural Philosophy, where he ex∣presseth
himself in the following manner,
<HI>velocitates incrementorum ac decrementorum,
quas etiam, motus, mutationes &amp; fluxiones
quantitatum nominare licet.</HI> And that he ad∣mits
Fluxions of Fluxions, or second, third,
fourth Fluxions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> see his Treatise of the
Quadrature of Curves. I ask now, Is it
not plain, that if a Fluxion be a Velocity,
then the Fluxion of a Fluxion may agreea∣bly
thereunto be called the Velocity of a
Velocity? In like manner if by a Fluxion
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
is meant a nascent augment, will it not then
follow, that the Fluxion of a Fluxion, or
second Fluxion is the nascent augment of
a nascent augment? Can any thing be plain∣er?
Let the Reader now judge who is unfair.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. I HAD observed, that the Great
Author had proceeded illegitimately, in ob∣taining
the Fluxion or moment of the Rec∣tangle
of two flowing quantities; and that
he did not fairly get rid of the Rectangle of
the moments. In answer to this you al∣ledge,
that the error arising from the o∣mission
of such rectangle (allowing it to be
an error) is so small that it is insignificant.
This you dwell upon and examplify to no
other purpose, but to amuse your Reader
and mislead him from the Question; which
in truth is not concerning the accuracy of
computing or measuring in practice, but
concerning the accuracy of the reasoning
in science. That this was really the case,
and that the smallness of the practical error
no wise concerns it, must be so plain to
any one who reads the Analyst, that I won∣der
how you could be ignorant of it.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. YOU would fain persuade your
Reader, that I make an absurd quarrel a∣gainst
errors of no significancy in practice,
and represent Mathematicians as proceeding
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
blindfold in their approximations; in all
which I cannot help thinking there is on
your part either great ignorance or great
disingenuity. If you mean to defend the
reasonableness and use of approximations, or
of the method of Indivisibles, I have no∣thing
to say. But then you must remem∣ber
this is not the Doctrine of Fluxions:
It is none of that Analysis with which I
am concerned. That I am far from quar∣relling
at approximations in Geometry is
manifest from the thirty third and fifty
third Queries in the Analyst. And that
the method of Fluxions pretends to some∣what
more than the method of Indivisibles
is plain; because Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> disclaims this
method as not Geometrical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Schelium at the end of the first Section,</HI> Lib. 1. Phil. Nat. Princip. Math..</NOTE> And that
the method of Fluxions is supposed accu∣rate
in Geometrical rigour is manifest, to
whoever considers what the Great Author
writes about it; especially in his Intro∣duction
to the Quadrature of Curves, where
he saith <HI>In rebus mathematicis errores quam
minimi non sunt contemnendi.</HI> Which ex∣pression
you have seen quoted in the Ana∣lyst,
and yet you seem ignorant thereof,
and indeed, of the very End and Design
of the Great Author in this his invention of
Fluxions.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
XXVI. AS oft as you talk of finite quan∣tities
inconsiderable in practice, Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>
disowns your apology. <HI>Cave,</HI> saith he, <HI>in∣tellexeris
finitas.</HI> And although Quantities
less than sensible may be of no account in
practice, yet none of your masters, nor will
even you yourself venture to say, they are
of no account in Theory and in Reasoning.
The application in gross practice is not the
point questioned, but the rigour and just∣ness
of the reasoning. And it is evident
that, be the subject ever so little, or ever
so inconsiderable, this doth not hinder but
that a person treating thereof may com∣mit
very great errors in Logic, which Lo∣gical
errors are in no wise to be measured
by the sensible or practical inconveniences
thence arising, which, perchance, may be
none at all. It must be owned, that after
you have mislead and amused your less qua∣lified
Reader (as you call him) you return
to the real point in controversy, and set
your self to justifie Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s method of
getting rid of the abovementioned Rectan∣gle.
And here I must intreat the Reader to
observe how fairly you proceed.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. FIRST then you affirm (<HI>P.</HI> 44.)
"that, neither in the Demonstration of the
Rule for finding the Fluxion of the rec∣tangle
of two flowing quantities, nor in
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
any thing preceding or following it, is
any mention so much as once made of
the increment of the rectangle of such
flowing quantities." Now I affirm the
direct contrary. For in the very passage by
you quoted in this same page, from the first
case of the second lemma of the second
Book of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Principles, beginning
with <HI>Rectangulum quodvis motu perpetuo
auctum,</HI> and ending with <HI>igitur laterum in∣crementis
totis a et b generatur rectanguli
incrementum a B</HI> x <HI>b A Q. E. D.</HI> In this
very passage, I say, is express mention made
of the increment of such rectangle. As this
is matter of fact, I refer it to the Reader's
own eyes. Of what rectangle have we here
the Increment? Is it not plainly of that
whose sides have <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for their <HI>Incre∣menta
tota,</HI> that is, of <HI>AB</HI>? Let any Reader
judge whether it be not plain from the
words, the sense, and the context, that the
Great Author in the end of his demonstra∣tion
understands his <HI>incrementum</HI> as belong∣ing
to the <HI>Rectangulum quodvis</HI> at the begin∣ning.
Is not the same also evident from the
very Lemma it self prefixed to the Demon∣stration?
The sense whereof is (as the Au∣thor
there explains it) that if the moments
of the flowing quantities <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> are cal∣led
<HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> then the <HI>momentum vel mutatio
geniti rectanguli AB</HI> will be <HI>a B</HI> x <HI>b A.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Either therefore the conclusion of the de∣monstration
is not the thing which was to
be demonstrated, or the <HI>rectanguli incremen∣tum
a B</HI> x <HI>b A</HI> belongs to the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. ALL this is so plain that no∣thing
can be more so; and yet you would
fain perplex this plain case by distinguish∣ing
between an increment and a moment.
But it is evident to every one, who has any
notion of Demonstration, that the <HI>incre∣mentum</HI>
in the Conclusion must be the <HI>mo∣mentum</HI>
in the Lemma; and to suppose it
otherwise is no credit to the Author. It is
in effect supposing him to be one who did
not know what he would demonstrate. But
let us hear Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s own words: <HI>Earum
(quantitatum scilicet fluentium) incrementa
vel decrementa momentanea sub nomine mo∣mentorum
intelligo.</HI> And you observe your
self that he useth the word <HI>moment</HI> to sig∣nify
either an increment or decrement.
Hence, with an intention to puzzle me, you
propose the increment and decrement of
<HI>AB,</HI> and ask which of these I would call the
moment? The case, you say, is difficult. My
answer is very plain and easy, to wit, Either
of them. You, indeed, make a different
answer, and from the Author's saying that,
by a moment he understands either the mo∣mentaneous
increment or decrement of the
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
flowing quantities, you would have us con∣clude,
by a very wonderful inference, that
his moment is neither the increment nor
decrement thereof. Would it not be as good
an inference, Because a number is either
odd or even, to conclude it is neither? Can
any one make sense of this? Or can even
your self hope that this will go down with
the Reader, how little soever qualified? It
must be owned, you endeavour to obtrude
this inference on him, rather by mirth and
humour than by reasoning. You are merry,
I say, and (<HI>P.</HI> 46.) represent the two ma∣thematical
quantities as pleading their
rights, as tossing up cross and pile, as dis∣puting
amicably. You talk of their claim∣ing
preference, their agreeing, their boy∣ishness
and their gravity. And after this in∣genious
digression you address me in the fol∣lowing
words.—Believe me there is no re∣medy,
you must acquiesce. But my answer
is, that I will neither believe you nor ac∣quiesce;
there is a plain remedy in common
sense; and, to prevent surprise, I desire the
Reader always to keep the controverted
point in view, to examine your reasons,
and be cautious how he takes your word,
but most of all when you are positive or
eloquent or merry.</P>
<P N="29"><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
XXIX. A PAGE or two after, you
very candidly represent your case to be that
of an Ass between two bottles of hay; it
is your own expression. The cause of your
perplexity is, that you know not whether
the velocity of <HI>AB</HI> increasing or of <HI>AB</HI>
decreasing is to be esteemed the Fluxion, or
proportional to the moment of the rec∣tangle.
My opinion, agreeably to what
hath been premised, is that either may be
deemed the Fluxion. But you tell us
"(<HI>P.</HI> 49.) that you think, the venerable
ghost of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> whispers you,
The Velocity you seek for is neither the
one nor the other of these, but is the ve∣locity
which the flowing rectangle hath,
not while it is greater or less than <HI>AB,</HI>
but at that very instant of time that it is
<HI>AB.</HI>" For my part, in the rectangle
<HI>AB</HI> considered simply in it self, without
either increasing or diminishing, I can con∣ceive
no velocity at all. And if the Reader
is of my mind, he will not take either your
word, or even the word of a Ghost, how
venerable soever, for velocity without mo∣tion.
You proceed and tell us that, in like
manner, the moment of the rectangle is
neither its increment or decrement. This
you would have us believe on the authority
of his Ghost, in direct opposition to what
Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> himself asserted when alive. <HI>In∣crementa</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
(saith he) <HI>vel decrementa momen∣tanea
sub nomine momentorum intelligo: ita
ut incrementa pro momentis addititiis seu
affirmativis, ac decrementa prosubductitiis
seu negativis habeantur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Princip. Phil. Nat. Lib. II. Lem. II.</NOTE>. I will not in
your style bid the Reader believe me, but
believe his eyes.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. TO me it verily seems, that you
have undertaken the defence of what you
do not understand. To mend the matter,
you say, "you do not consider <HI>AB</HI> as ly∣ing
at either extremity of the moment,
but as extended to the middle of it; as
having acquired the one half of the mo∣ment,
and as being about to acquire the
other; or, as having lost one half of it,
and being about to lose the other." Now,
in the name of Truth, I intreat you to
tell what this moment is, to the middle
whereof the rectangle is extended? This
moment, I say, which is acquired, which
is lost, which is cut in two, or distinguish∣ed
into halfs? Is it a finite quantity, or an
infinitesimal, or a mere limit, or nothing
at all? Take it in what sense you will, I
cannot make your defence either consistent
or intelligible. For if you take it in either
of the two former senses, you contradict
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> And if you take it in
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
either of the latter, you contradict common
sense; it being plain, that what hath no
magnitude, or is no quantity, cannot be
divided. And here I must intreat the Rea∣der
to preserve his full freedom of mind
intire, and not weakly suffer his judgment
to be overborn by your imagination and
your prejudices, by great names and au∣thorities,
by Ghosts and Visions, and a∣bove
all by that extreme satisfaction and
complacency with which you utter your
strange conceits; if words without a mean∣ing
may be called so. After having given
this unintelligible account, you ask with
your accustomed air, "What say you, Sir?
Is this a just and legitimate reason for
Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s proceeding as he did? I think
you must acknowledge it to be so." But
alas! I acknowledge no such thing. I find
no sense or reason in what you say. Let
the Reader find it if he can.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. IN the next Place (<HI>P.</HI> 50.) you
charge me with want of caution. "Inas∣much
(say you) as that quantity which
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> through his whole
Lemma, and all the several Cases of it,
constantly calls a <HI>Moment,</HI> without con∣fining
it to be either an increment or
decrement, is by you inconsiderately and
arbitrarily, and without any Shadow of
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
of Reasou given, supposed and deter∣mined
to be an increment." To which
Charge I reply that it is as untrue as it is
peremptory. For that, in the foregoing
citation from the first case of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s
Lemma, he expresly determines it to be an
Increment. And as this particular Instance
or Passage was that which I objected to, it
was reasonable and proper for me to con∣sider
the Moment in that same Light. But
take it increment or decrement as you will,
the Objections still lie, and the Difficulties
are equally insuperable. You then pro∣ceed
to extoll the great Author of the fluxio∣nary
Method, and to bestow some <HI>Brus∣queries</HI>
upon those who unadvisedly dare to
differ from him. To all which I shall give
no answer.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. AFTERWARDS to re∣move
(as you say) all Scruple and Difficulty
about this affair, you observe that the Mo∣ment
of the Rectangle determined by Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> and the Increment of the
Rectangle determined by me, are perfectly
and exactly equal, supposing <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> to be
diminished <HI>ad infinitum</HI>: and for proof of
this, you refer to the first Lemma of the
first Section of the first Book of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s
Principles. I answer, that if <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are
real quantities, then <HI>a b</HI> is something, and
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
consequently makes a real difference: but
if they are nothing, then the Rectangles
whereof they are coefficients become
nothing likewise: and consequently the
<HI>momentum</HI> or <HI>incrementum,</HI> whether Sir
<HI>Isaac</HI>'s or mine, are in that Case nothing
at all. As for the abovementioned Lem∣ma,
which you refer to, and which you
wish I had consulted sooner, both for my
own sake and for yours; I tell you I had
long since consulted and considered it. But
I very much doubt whether you have suf∣ficiently
considered that Lemma, its De∣monstration,
and its Consequences. For,
however that way of reasoning may do in
the Method of <HI>exhaustions,</HI> where quanti∣ties
less than assignable are regarded as
nothing; yet for a Fluxionist writing a∣bout
momentums, to argue that quantities
must be equal because they have no assign∣able
difference, seems the most injudici∣ous
Step that could be taken: it is direct∣ly
demolishing the very Doctrine you
would defend. For it will thence follow,
that all homogeneous momentums are e∣qual,
and consequently the velocities,
mutations, or fluxions proportional thereto,
are all likewise equal. There is, therefore,
only one proportion of equality through∣out,
which at once overthrows the whole
System you undertake to defend. Your
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
moments (I say) not being themselves as∣signable
quantities, their differences cannot
be assignable: and if this be true, by that
way of reasoning it will follow, they are all
equal, upon which Supposition you cannot
make one Step in the Method of Fluxiors.
It appears from hence, how unjustly you
blame me (<HI>P.</HI> 32.) for omitting to give
any Account of that first Section of the
first Book of the <HI>Principia,</HI> wherein (you
say) the Foundation of the Method of
Fluxions is geometrically demonstrated and
largely explained, and difficulties and ob∣jections
against it are clearly solved. All
which is so far from being true, that the
very first and fundamental Lemma of that
Section is incompatible with, and subver∣sive
of the doctrine of Fluxions. And,
indeed, who sees not that a Demonstra∣tion
<HI>ad absurdum more veterum</HI> proceeding
on a Supposition, that every difference
must be some given quantity, cannot be
admitted in, or consist with, a method,
wherein Quantities, less than any given, are
supposed really to exist, and be capable of
division?</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. THE next point you under∣take
to defend is that method for obtain∣ing
a rule to find the Fluxion of any
Power of a flowing Quantity, which is
delivered in the introduction to the Qua∣dratures,
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
and considered in the Analyst<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 13, 14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.
And here the question between us is,
whether I have rightly represented the sense
of those words, <HI>evanescant jam augmenta
illa,</HI> in rendering them, let the increments
vanish, <HI>i. e.</HI> let the increments be nothing,
or let there be no increments? This you
deny, but, as your manner is, instead of
giving a reason you declaim. I, on the
contrary affirm, the increments must be
understood to be quite gone and absolutely
nothing at all. My reason is, because with∣out
that supposition you can never bring the
quantity or expression <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> down to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, the very thing aimed
at by supposing the evanescence. Say whe∣ther
this be not the truth of the case?
Whether the former expression is not to
be reduced to the latter? And whether this
can possibly be done so long as <HI>o</HI> is supposed
a real Quantity? I cannot indeed say
you are scrupulous about your affirmati∣ons,
and yet I believe that even you will
not affirm this; it being most evident, that
the product of two real quantities is some∣thing
real; and that nothing real can be
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
rejected either according to the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of
Geometry, or according to Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s own
principles; for the truth of which I ap∣peal
to all who know any thing of these
matters. Further by <HI>evanescent</HI> must either
be meant, let them (the increments) vanish
and become nothing, in the obvious sense,
or else let them become infinitely small.
But that this latter is not Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s sense
is evident from his own words in the
very same page, that is, in the last of the
Introduction to his Quadratures, where he
expressly saith <HI>volui ostendere quod in me∣thodo
Fluxionum non opus fit figuras infinitè
parvas in Geometriam introducere.</HI> Upon
the whole, you seem to have considered this
affair so very superficially, as greatly to
confirm me in the opinion, you are so an∣gry
with, to wit, that Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s followers
are much more eager in applying his me∣thod,
than accurate in examining his prin∣ciples.
You raise a dust about evanescent
augments which may perhaps amuse and
amaze your Reader, but I am much mis∣taken
if it ever instructs or enlightens him.
For, to come to the point, those evanescent
augments either are real quantities, or they
are not. If you say they are; I desire to
know, how you get rid of the rejectaneous
quantity? If you say they are not; you in∣deed
get rid of those quantities in the com∣position
whereof they are coefficients; but
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
then you are of the same opinion with me,
"which opinion you are pleased to call
(<HI>P.</HI> 58.) a most palpable, inexcusable,
and unpardonable blunder, although it
be a Truth most palpably evident".</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. NOTHING, I say, can be
plainer to any impartial Reader, than that
by the Evanescence of augments, in the
above cited passage, Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> means their
being actually reduced to nothing. But
to put it out of all doubt, that this is the
truth, and to convince even you, who shew
so little disposition to be convinced, I de∣sire
you to look into his <HI>Analysis per aequa∣tiones
infinitas</HI> (<HI>P.</HI> 20.) where, in his pre∣paration
for demonstrating the first rule
for the squaring of simple Curves, you
will find that on a parallel occasion, speak∣ing
of an augment which is supposed to
vanish, he interprets the word <HI>evanescere</HI>
by <HI>esse nihil.</HI> Nothing can be plainer than
this, which at once destroys your defence.
And yet, plain as it is, I despair of making
you acknowledge it; though I am sure
you feel it, and the Reader if he useth his
eyes must see it. The words <HI>Evanescere five
esse nihil</HI> do (to use your own expression)
stare us in the face. Lo! "This is what
you call (<HI>P.</HI> 56.) so great, so unaccounta∣ble,
so horrid, so truly <HI>Boeotian</HI> a blunder"
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
that, according to you, it was not possible
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> could be guilty of it.
For the future, I advise you to be more
sparing of hard words: Since, as you in∣cautiously
deal them about, they may
chance to light on your friends as well as
your adversaries. As for my part, I shall
not retaliate. It is sufficient to say you are
mistaken, But I can easily pardon your
mistakes. Though, indeed, you tell me
on this very occasion, that I must expect
no quarter from Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s followers. And
I tell you that I neither expect nor desire
any. My aim is truth. My reasons I have
given. Confute them, if you can. But
think not to overbear me either with au∣thorities
or harsh words. The latter will
recoil upon your selves: The former in a
matter of science are of no weight with
indifferent Readers; and as for Bigots, I
am not concerned about what they say or
think.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. IN the next place you pro∣ceed
to declaim upon the following pas∣sage
taken from the seventeenth section of
the Analyst. "Considering the various
arts and devices used by the great au∣thor
of the fluxionary method: In how
many lights he placeth his Fluxions:
and in what different ways he attempts to
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
demonstrate the same point: One would
be inclined to think, he was himself sus∣picious
of the justness of his own de∣monstrations."
This passage you com∣plain
of as very hard usage of Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton.</HI> You declaim copiously, and en∣deavour
to shew that placing the same
point in various lights is of great use to
explain it; which you illustrate with much
Rhetoric. But the fault of that passage is
not the hard usage it contains: But on the
contrary, that it is too modest, and not
so full and expressive of my sense, as per∣haps
it should have been. Would you like
it better if I should say, the various <HI>incon∣sistent</HI>
accounts, which this great author
gives of his momentums and his fluxions,
may convince every intelligent Reader
that he had no clear and steady notions of
them, without which there can be no de∣monstration?
I own frankly that I see no
clearness or consistence in them. You tell
me indeed, in <HI>Miltonic</HI> verse, that the fault
is in my own eyes,
<Q><L>So thick a drop serene has quench'd their orbs.</L>
<L>Or dim Suffusion veil'd.</L></Q>
At the same time you acknowledge your
self obliged for those various lights, which
have enabled you to understand his Doc∣trine.
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
But as for me who do not understand
it, you insult me, saying: "For God's sake
what is it you are offended at, who do
not still understand him"? May not I
answer, that I am offended for this very
reason; because I cannot understand him
or make sense of what he says? You say
to me, that I am all in the dark. I ac∣knowledge
it, and intreat you who see so
clearly, to help me out.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. YOU, Sir, with the bright
eyes, be pleased to tell me, whether Sir
<HI>Isaac</HI>'s momentum be a finite quantity, or
an infinitesimal, or a mere limit? If you
say, a finite quantity: Be pleased to recon∣cile
this with what he saith in the Scho∣lium
of the second Lemma of the first
Section of the first book of his Principles:
<HI>Cave intelligas quantitates magnitudine de∣terminatas,
sed cogita semper diminuendas
sine limite.</HI> If you say, an infinitesimal:
reconcile this with what is said in the
Introduction to his Quadratures: <HI>Volui
oftendere quod in methodo Flaxionum non
opus fit figuras infinitè parvas in Geome∣triam
introducere.</HI> If you should say, it
is a mere limit, be pleased to reconcile
this with what we find in the first case
of the second Lemma in the second book
of his principles: <HI>Ubi de lateribus A et B
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
deerant momentorum dimidia,</HI> &amp;c. where the
moments are supposed to be divided. I
should be very glad, a person of such lu∣minous
intellect would be so good as to
explain, whether by Fluxions we are to
understand the nascent or evanescent quan∣tities
themselves, or their motions, or their
Velocities, or simply their proportions:
and having interpreted them in what sense
you will, that you would then conde∣scend
to explain the Doctrine of second,
third, and fourth Fluxions, and shew it
to be consistent with common sense if you
can. You seem to be very sanguine when
you express your self in the following
terms. "I do assure you, Sir, from my
own Experience, and that of many o∣thers
whom I could name, that the
Doctrine may be clearly conceived and
distinctly comprehended" (<HI>p.</HI> 31.) And it
may be uncivil not to believe what you
so solemnly affirm, from your own ex∣perience.
But I must needs own, I should
be better fatisfied of this, if, instead of
entertaining us with your Rhetoric, you
would vouchsafe to reconcile those diffi∣culties,
and explain those obscure points
abovementioned. If either you, or any one of
those many whom you could name, will but
explain to others what you so clearly con∣ceive
your selves, I give you my word
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
that several will be obliged to you who,
I may venture to say, understand those
matters no more than my self. But, if
I am not much mistaken, you and your
friends will modestly decline this task.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. I HAVE long ago done
what you so often exhort me to do, dili∣gently
read and considered the several ac∣counts
of this Doctrine given by the great
Author in different parts of his writings: and
upon the whole I could never make it out
to be consistent and intelligible. I was
even led to say, "that one would be in∣clined
to think, He was himself suspi∣cious
of the justness of his own demon∣strations:
and that he was not enough
pleased with any one Notion steadily
to adhere to it." After which I ad∣ded,
"Thus much is plain that he own∣ed
himself satisfied concerning certain
points, which nevertheless he could not
undertake to demonstrate to others."
See the seventeenth section of the Analyst.
It is one thing when a Doctrine is placed
in various lights: and another, when the
principles and notions are shifted. When
new devices are introduced and substitu∣ted
for others, a Doctrine instead of being
illustrated may be explained away. Whe∣ther
there be not something of this in
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
the present case I appeal to the writings
of the Great Author. His <HI>methodus ra∣tionum
primarum et ultimarum,</HI> His second
Lemma in the second book of his prin∣ciples,
his Introduction and Treatise of
the Quadrature of Curves. In all which
it appears to me, there is not one uniform
doctrine explained and carried throughout
the whole, but rather sundry inconsistent
accounts of this new Method, which still
grows more dark and confused the more
it is handled: I could not help thinking,
the greatest genius might lie under the
influence of false principles; and where
the object and notions were exceeding ob∣scure,
he might possibly distrust even his
own demonstrations. "At least thus
much seemed plain, that Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> had
sometime owned himself satisfied, where
he could not demonstrate to others. In
proof whereof I mentioned his letter
to Mr. <HI>Collins</HI>; Hereupon you tell me:
there is a great deal of difference be∣tween
saying, I cannot undertake to
prove a thing, and I will not under∣take
it." But in answer to this, I de∣sire
you will be pleased to consider, that
I was not making a precise extract out of
that letter, in which the very words of
Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> should alone be inserted. But
I made my own remark and inference,
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
from what I remembred to have read in
that letter; where, speaking of a certain
Mathematical matter, Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> expresseth
himself, in the following terms. "It is
plain to me by the fountain I draw it
from; though I will not undertake to
prove it to others." Now whether my
inference may not be fairly drawn from
those words of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>; and
whether the difference as to the sense be
so great between <HI>will</HI> and <HI>can</HI> in that
particular case, I leave to be determined
by the Reader.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. IN the next paragraph you
talk big, but prove nothing. You speak of
driving out of intrenchments, of sallying
and attacking and carrying by assault; of
slight and untenable works, of a new-raised
and undisciplined militia, and of veteran
regular troops. Need the Reader be a Ma∣thematician
to see the vanity of this para∣graph?
After this you employ (<HI>p.</HI> 65) your
usual colouring, and represent the great
Author of the method of Fluxions "as
a Good old Gentleman fast asleep, and
snoring in his easy chair; while dame
Fortune is bringing him her apron full
of beautiful theorems and problems,
which he never knows or thinks of."
This you would have pass for a conse∣quence
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
of my notions. But I appeal to all
those who are ever so little knowing in
such matters, whether there are not divers
fountains of Experiment, Induction, and
Analogy, whence a man may derive and
satisfy himself concerning the truth of ma∣ny
points in Mathematics and Mechanical
Philosophy, although the proofs thereof
afforded by the modern Analysis should
not amount to demonstration? I further
appeal to the conscience of all the most
profound Mathematicians, whether they
can, with perfect acquiescence of mind free
from all scruple, apply any proposition
merely upon the strength of a Demonstra∣tion
involving second or third Fluxions,
without the aid of any such experiment or
analogy or collateral proof whatsoever?
Lastly, I appeal to the Reader's own heart,
whether he cannot clearly conceive a me∣dium
between being fast asleep and demon∣strating?
But you will have it, that I re∣present
Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Conclusions as com∣ing
out right, because one error is compen∣sated
by another contrary and equal error,
which perhaps he never knew himself nor
thought of: that by a twofold mistake he
arrives though not at science yet at Truth:
that he proceeds blindfold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which
is untruly said by you, who have misap∣plied
to Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> what was intended for
the Marquis <HI>de l' Hospital</HI> and his fol∣lowers,
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
for no other end (as I can see) but
that you may have an opportunity to draw
that ingenious portraiture of Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI> and Dame Fortune, as will be ma∣nifest
to whoever reads the Analyst.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. YOU tell me (<HI>p.</HI> 70), if I
think fit to persist in asserting, "that this
affair of a double error is entirely a new
discovery of my own, which Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>
and his followers never knew nor
thought of, that you have unquestiona∣ble
evidence to convince me of the con∣trary,
and that all his followers are
already apprised, that this very objecti∣on
of mine was long since foreseen,
and clearly and fully removed by
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> in the first section
of the first book of his <HI>Principia</HI>".
All which I do as strongly deny as
you affirm. And I do aver, that this is
an unquestionable proof of the matchless
contempt which you, <HI>Philalethes,</HI> have for
Truth. And I do here publickly call up∣on
you, to produce that evidence which
you pretend to have, and to make good
that fact which you so confidently affirm.
And, at the same time, I do assure the
Reader that you never will, nor can.</P>
<P N="40"><PB N="49" REF="48"/>
XL. IF you defend Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s notions
as delivered in his <HI>Principia,</HI> it must be
on the rigorous foot of rejecting nothing,
neither admitting nor casting away infi∣nitely
small quantities. If you defend the
Marquis, whom you also stile your Ma∣ster,
it must be on the foot of admitting
that there are infinitesimals, that may be
rejected, that they are nevertheless real
quantities, and themselves infinitely sub∣divisible.
But you seem to have grown
giddy with passion, and in the heat of
controversy to have mistaken and forgot
your part. I beseech you, Sir, to consider,
that the Marquis (whom alone, and not
Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> this double error in finding the
subtangent doth concern) rejects indeed in∣finitesimals,
but not on the foot that you
do, to wit, their being inconsiderable in
practical Geometry or mixed Mathematics.
But he rejects them in the accuracy of Spe∣culative
Knowledge: in which respect
there may be great Logical errors, al∣though
there should be no sensible mistake
in practice: which, it seems, is what you
cannot comprehend. He rejects them like∣wise
in virtue of a Postulatum, which I
venture to call rejecting them without ce∣remony.
And though he inferreth a con∣clusion
accurately true, yet he doth it,
contrary to the rules of Logic, from inac∣curate
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
and false premises, And how this
comes about, I have at large explained in
the Analyst, and shewed in that particular
case of Tangents, that the Rejectaneous
Quantity might have been a finite quanti∣ty
of any given magnitude, and yet the
conclusion have come out exactly the same
way; and consequently, that the truth of
this method doth not depend on the reason
assigned by the Marquis, to wit, the <HI>postu∣latum</HI>
for throwing away Infinitesimals;
and therefore that he and his followers
acted blindfold, as not knowing the true
reason for the conclusion's coming out ac∣curately
right, which I shew to have been
the effect of a double error.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. THIS is the truth of the matter,
which you shamefully misrepresent and
declaim upon, to no sort of purpose but
to amuse and mislead your Reader. For
which conduct of yours throughout your
remarks, you will pardon me if I cannot
otherwise account, than from a secret
hope that the reader of your defence would
never read the Analyst. If he doth, He
cannot but see what an admirable Method
you take to defend your cause: How in∣stead
of justifying the Reasoning, the Lo∣gic
or the Theory of the case specified,
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
which is the real point, you discourse of
sensible and practical errors: And how all
this is a manifest imposition upon the
Reader. He must needs see that I have
expresly said, "I have no controversy ex∣cept
only about your Logic and me∣thod:
that I consider how you demon∣strate;
what objects you are conversant
about; and whether you conceive them
clearly? That I have often expressed
my self to the same effect, desiring the
Reader to remember, that I am only
concerned about the way of coming at
your theorems, whether it be legitimate
or illegitimate, clear or obscure, scienti∣fic
or tentative: That I have on this ve∣ry
occasion, to prevent all possibility of
mistake, repeated and insisted that I
consider the Geometrical Analyst as a
Logician, <HI>i. e.</HI> so far forth as he reasons
and argues; and his mathematical con∣clusions
not in themselves but in their
premises; not as true or false, useful or
insignificant, but as derived from such
principles, and by such inferences"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analyst,</HI> Sect. XX.</NOTE>.
You affirm (and indeed what can you not
affirm?) that the difference between the
true subtangent and that found without
any compensation is absolutely nothing at
all. I profess my self of a contrary opini∣on.
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
My reason is because nothing cannot
be divided into parts. But this difference
is capable of being divided into any, or
into more than any given number of parts;
For the truth of which consult the Mar∣quit
<HI>de l' Hospital.</HI> And, be the error in
fact or in practice ever so small, it will
not thence follow that the error in Rea∣soning,
which is what I am alone con∣cerned
about, is one whit the less, it being
evident that a man may reason most absurd∣ly
about the minutest things.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. PRAY answer me fairly, once
for all, whether it be your opinion that
whatsoever is little and inconsiderable e∣nough
to be rejected without inconve∣nience
in practice, the same may in like
manner be safely rejected and overlooked
in Theory and Demonstration. If you say
<HI>no,</HI> it will then follow, that all you have
been saying here and elsewhere, about
yards and inches and decimal fractions, set∣ting
forth and insisting on the extreme small∣ness
of the rejectaneous quantity, is quite
foreign to the argument, and only a piece
of skill to impose upon your Reader. If
you say <HI>yes,</HI> it follows that you then give
up at once all the orders of Fluxions and
Infinitesimal Differences; and so most im∣prudently
turn all your sallies and attacks
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
and Veterans to your own overthrow. If
the Reader is of my mind, he will de∣spair
of ever seeing you get clear of this
Dilemma. The points in controversy have
been so often and so distinctly noted in the
Analyst, that I very much wonder how
you could mistake if you had no mind to
mistake. It is very plain, if you are in
earnest, that you neither understand me
nor your Masters. And what shall we
think of other ordinary Analysts, when it
shall be found that even you, who, like a
Champion step forth to defend their prin∣ciples,
have not considered them.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. THE impartial Reader is in∣treated
to remark throughout your whole
performance, how confident you are in as∣serting,
and withall how modest in proving
or explaining: How frequent it is with
you to employ Figures and Tropes in∣stead
of Reasons: How many difficulties
proposed in the Analyst are discreetly over∣looked
by you, and what strange work
you make with the rest: How grosly you
mistake and misrepresent, and how little
you practise the advice which you so libe∣rally
bestow. Believe me, Sir, I had long
and maturely considered the principles of
the modern Analysis, before I ventured to
publish my thoughts thereupon in the
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
Analyst. And since the publication there∣of,
I have my self freely conversed with
Mathematicians of all ranks, and some of
the ablest Professors, as well as made it my
business to be informed of the Opinions of
others, being very desirous to hear what
could be said towards clearing my diffi∣culties
or answering my objections. But
though you are not afraid or ashamed to
represent the Analysts as very clear and uni∣form
in their Conception of these matters,
yet I do solemnly affirm (and several of
themselves know it to be true) that I found
no harmony or agreement among them,
but the reverse thereof, the greatest disso∣nance,
and even contrariety of Opinions,
employed to explain what after all seem∣ed
inexplicable.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. SOME fly to proportions be∣tween
nothings. Some reject quantities be∣cause
infinitesimal. Others allow only finite
quantities, and reject them because incon∣siderable.
Others place the method of
Fluxions on a foot with that of <HI>Exhaust∣ions,</HI>
and admit nothing new therein.
Some maintain the clear conception of
Fluxions. Others hold they can demon∣strate
about things incomprehensible. Some
would prove the Algorism of Fluxions
by <HI>reductio ad absurdum</HI>; others <HI>a priori.</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
Some hold the evanescent increments to
be real quantities, some to be nothings,
some to be limits. As many Men, so
many minds: Each differing one from
another, and all from Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI>
Some plead inaccurate expressions in the
great Author, whereby they would draw
him to speak their sense, not considering
that if he meant as they do, he could not
want words to express his meaning.
Others are magisterial and positive, say
they are satisfied, and that is all, not con∣sidering
that we, who deny Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI>'s Authority, shall not submit to
that of his Disciples. Some insist, that
the Conclusions are true, and therefore the
principles, not considering what hath been
largely said in the Analyst<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sect.</HI> XIX, XX. &amp;c.</NOTE> on that head.
Lastly several (and those none of the
meanest) frankly owned the objections to
be unanswerable. All which I mention
by way of Antidote to your false Colours:
and that the unprejudiced Inquirer after
Truth may see, it is not without founda∣tion,
that I call on the celebrated Mathema∣ticians
of the present Age to clear up
these obscure Analytics, and concur in giv∣ing
to the publick some consistent and
intelligible account of the principles of
their great Master: which if they do not,
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
I believe the World will take it for gran∣ted
that they cannot.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. HAVING gone through your
Defence of the British Mathematicians, I
find in the next place, that you attack me
on a point of Metaphysics, with what
success the Reader will determine. I had
upon another Occasion many years ago
wrote against Abstract general Ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction to a Treatise concerning the Principles of Hu∣man Knowledge, printed in the Year MDCCX.</NOTE>. In
opposition to which, you declare your self
to adhere to the vulgar opinion, that nei∣ther
Geometry nor any other general Sci∣ence
can subsist without general Ideas.
(<HI>P.</HI> 74.) This implies that I hold there are
no general Ideas. But I hold the direct
contrary, that there are indeed general Ideas,
but not formed by abstraction in the man∣ner
set forth by Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI> To me it
is plain, there is no consistent Idea, the
likeness whereof may not really exist.
Whatsoever therefore is said to be some∣what
which cannot exist, the Idea thereof
must be inconsistent. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> acknowledg∣eth
it doth require Pains and Skill to form
his general Idea of a Triangle. He further
expresly saith, it must be neither oblique
nor rectangular, neither equilateral, equi∣crural,
nor scalenum; but all and none
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
of these at once. He also saith, it is an
Idea wherein some parts of several diffe∣rent
and inconsistent Ideas are put toge∣ther<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Essay on Humane Understanding.</HI> b. iv. c. vii. §. ix.</NOTE>.
All this looks very like a Con∣tradiction.
But to put the Matter past
dispute, it must be noted, that he affirms
it to be somewhat imperfect that cannot ex∣ist;
consequently the Idea thereof is im∣possible
or inconsistent.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. I DESIRE to know, whether
it is not possible for any thing to exist,
which doth not include a contradiction:
And if it is, whether we may not infer,
that what cannot possibly exist, the same
doth include a contradiction: I further
desire to know, whether the reader can
frame a distinct idea of any thing that
includes a contradiction? For my part, I
cannot, nor consequently of the above∣mentioned
Triangle; Though you (who it
seems know better than my self what I
can do) are pleased to assure me of the
contrary. Again, I ask whether that,
which it is above the power of man to
form a compleat idea of, may not be
called incomprehensible? And whether the
Reader can frame a compleat idea of this
imperfect, impossible Triangle? And if
not, whether it doth not follow that it
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
is incomprehensible? It should seem, that
a distinct aggregate of a few consistent
parts was nothing so difficult to conceive,
or impossible to exist; and that, therefore
your Comment must be wide of the Au∣thor's
meaning. You give me to under∣stand
(<HI>P.</HI> 82.) that this account of a ge∣neral
Triangle was a trap which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>
set to catch fools. Who is caught therein
let the Reader judge.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. IT is Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s opinion,
that every general name stands for a ge∣neral
abstract idea, which prescinds from
the species or individuals comprehended
under it. Thus, for example, according
to him, the general name <HI>Colour</HI> stands
for an idea, which is neither Blue, Red,
Green nor any other particular colour, but
somewhat distinct and abstracted from them
all. To me it seems, the word <HI>Colour</HI> is
only a more general name applicable to
all and each of the particular colours;
while the other specific names, as Blue,
Red, Green, and the like are each re∣strained
to a more limited signification.
The same may be said of the word Tri∣angle.
Let the Reader judge whether
this be not the case; and whether he can
distinctly frame such an idea of colour
as shall prescind from all the species there∣of,
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
or of a triangle which shall answer
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s account, prescinding and ab∣stracting
from all the particular sorts of
triangles, in the manner aforesaid.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. I intreat my Reader to think.
For if he doth not, he may be under some
influence from your confident and positive
way of talking. But any one who thinks
may, if I mistake not, plainly perceive
that you are deluded, as it often happens,
by mistaking the terms for ideas. Nothing
is easier, than to define in terms or words
that which is incomprehensible in idea,
forasmuch as any words can be either se∣parated
or joined as you please, but ideas
always cannot. It is as easy to say a round
square as an oblong square, though the for∣mer
be inconceivable. If the Reader will
but take a little care to distinguish between
the Definition and the Idea, between words
or expressions and the conceptions of the
mind, he will judge of the truth of what
I now advance, and clearly perceive how
far you are mistaken, in attempting to illu∣strate
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Doctrine, and where your
mistake lies. Or, if the Reader is minded to
make short work, he needs only at once to
try whether laying aside the words he can
frame in his mind the idea of an impossi∣ble
triangle; upon which trial the issue of
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
this dispute may be fairly put. This do∣ctrine
of abstract general ideas seemed to
me a capital error, productive of number∣less
difficulties and disputes, that runs not
only throughout Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s book, but
through most parts of Learning. Conse∣quently,
my animadversions thereupon
were not an effect of being inclined to carp
or cavil at a single passage, as you would
wrongfully insinuate, but proceeded from
a love of Truth and a desire to banish, so
far as in me lay, false principles and wrong
ways of thinking, without respect of per∣sons.
And indeed, though you and other
Party-men are violently attached to your
respective Masters, yet I, who profess my
self only attached to Truth, see no reason
why I may not as freely animadvert on
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> or Sit <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> as they
would on <HI>Aristole</HI> or <HI>Descartes.</HI> Certainly
the more extensive the influence of any
Error, and the greater the authority which
supports it, the more it deserves to be con∣sidered
and detected by sincere Inquirers
after Knowledge.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. IN the close of your perfor∣mance,
you let me understand, that your
Zeal for Truth and the reputation of your
Masters hath occasioned your reprehending
me with the utmost freedom. And it must
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
be owned you have shewn a singular talent
therein. But I am comforted under the
severity of your reprehensions, when I con∣sider
the weakness of your arguments,
which, were they as strong as your reproofs,
could leave no doubt in the mind of the
Reader concerning the matters in dispute
between us. As it is, I leave him to re∣flect
and examine by your light, how clear∣ly
he is enabled to conceive a fluxion, or
the fluxion of a fluxion, a part infinitely
small subdivided into an infinity of parts, a
nascent or evanescent increment, that
which is neither something nor nothing, a
triangle formed in a point, velocity with∣out
motion, and the rest of those <HI>arcana</HI>
of the modern Analysis. To conclude, I
had some thoughts of advising you how
to conduct your self for the future, in re∣turn
for the advice you have so freely im∣parted
to me: but, as you think it becomes
me rather to inform my self than instruct
others, I shall, for my further information,
take leave to propose a few Queries to
those learned Gentlemen of <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
whom you associate with your self, and re∣present
as being equally surprised at the
tendency of my Analyst.</P>
<P N="50">L. I desire to know, whether those
who can neither demonstrate nor conceive
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
the principles of the modern Analysis, and
yet give into it, may not be justly said to
have Faith, and be styled believers of mys∣teries?
Whether it is impossible to find a∣mong
the Physicians, mechanical Philoso∣phers,
Mathematicians, and Philomathe∣maticians
of the present age, some such
Believers, who yet deride Christians for
their belief of Mysteries? Whether with
such men it is not a fair, reasonable, and
legitimate method to use the <HI>Argumentum
ad Hominem</HI>? And being so, whether it
ought to surprise either Christians or Scho∣lars?
Whether in an age wherein so ma∣ny
pretenders to science attack the Chri∣stian
Religion, we may not be allowed
to make reprisals, in order to shew that
the Irreligion of those men is not to be
presumed an effect of deep and just think∣ing?
Whether an attempt to detect false
reasonings, and remedy defects in Mathe∣matics,
ought to be ill received by Ma∣thematicians?
Whether the introducing
more easy methods and more intelligible
principles in any science should be dis∣countenanced?
Whether there may not be
fair objections as well as cavils? And whe∣ther
to inquire diligently into the meaning
of terms and the proof of propositions,
not excepting against any thing without
assigning a reason, nor affecting to mistake
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
the signification of words, or stick at an
expression where the sense was clear, but
considering the subject in all lights, sin∣cerely
endeavouring to find out any sense
or meaning whatsoever, candidly setting
forth what seems obscure and what fal∣lacious,
and calling upon those, who pro∣fess
the knowledge of such matters, to
explain them; whether, I say, such a pro∣ceeding
can be justly called cavilling?
Whether there be an <HI>ipse dixit</HI> erected?
And if so, when, where, by whom, and
upon what Authority? Whether even
where Authority was to take place, one
might not hope the Mathematics, at least,
would be excepted? Whether the chief
end, in making Mathematics so conside∣rable
a part of Academical Education, be
not to form in the minds of young Stu∣dents
habits of just and exact Reasoning?
And whether the study of abstruse and
subtile matters can conduce to this end,
unless they are well understood, examin∣ed,
and sifted to the bottom? Whether,
therefore, the bringing Geometrical demon∣strations
to the severest test of Reason
should be reckoned a discouragement to
the studies of any learned Society? Whe∣ther
to separate the clear parts of things
from the obscure, to distinguish the real
Principles, whereon Truths rest, and
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
whence they are derived, and to propor∣tion
the just measures of assent according
to the various degrees of evidence, be an
useless or unworthy Undertaking? Whe∣ther
the making more of an argument
than it will bear, and placing it in an un∣due
rank of evidence, be not the likely
way to disparage it? Whether it may not
be of some use, to provoke and stir up
the learned professors to explain a part of
Mathematical Learning, which is acknow∣ledged
to be most profound, difficult, and
obscure, and at the same time set forth
by <HI>Philalethes</HI> and many others, as the
greatest instance that has ever been given
of the extent of humane abilities? Whe∣ther
for the sake of a Great man's disco∣veries,
we must adopt his errors? Lastly,
whether in an age wherein all other prin∣ciples
are canvassed with the utmost free∣dom,
the principles of Fluxions are to
be alone excepted?</P>

<HEAD>AN
APPENDIX
CONCERNING
Mr. WALTON's
VINDICATION
Of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S Principles
of FLUXIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAD no sooner considered
the performance of <HI>Philale∣thes,</HI>
but Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s Vindi∣cation
of Fluxions was put
into my hands. As this <HI>Dub∣lin</HI>
Professor gleans after the <HI>Cantabrigian,</HI>
only endeavouring to translate a few pas∣sages
from Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s <HI>Principia,</HI>
and enlarge on a hint or two of <HI>Philale∣thes,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
he deserves no particular notice. It
may suffice to advertise the Reader, that
the foregoing Defence, contains a full and
explicite Answer to Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> as he will
find, if he thinks it worth his pains to
read what this Gentleman hath written,
and compare it therewith: Particularly
with Sect. 18, 20, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
43. It is not, I am sure, worth mine to
repeat the same things, or confute the same
notions twice over, in mere regard to a
writer who hath copied even the manners
of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> and whom in answering the
other I have, if I am not much mistaken,
sufficiently answered.</P>
<P N="2">II. MR. <HI>Walton</HI> touches on the same
points that the other had touched upon be∣fore
him. He pursues a hint which the other
had given<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philalethes,</HI> p. 32.</NOTE>, about Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s first Section
concerning <HI>Rationes primae &amp; ultimae.</HI> He
discreetly avoids, like the other, to say one
syllable of second, third, or fourth Fluxi∣ons,
and of divers other points mentioned
in the Analyst, about all which I observe
in him a most prudent and profound si∣lence.
And yet he very modestly gives his
Reader to understand, that he is able to
clear up all difficulties and objections, that
have ever been made (<HI>P.</HI> 5.). Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> in
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
the beginning, like <HI>Philalethes,</HI> from a par∣ticular
case makes a general in erence,
supposing that Infidelity to be imputed to
Mathematicians in general, which I suppose
only in the person to whom the Analyst
was addressed, and certain other persons of
the same mind with him: Whether this
extraordinary way of reasoning be the cause
or effect of his passion, I know not: But
before I had got to the end of his Vindi∣cation,
I ceased to be surprized at his Lo∣gic
and his temper in the beginning. The
double error, which in the Analyst was
plainly meant to belong to others, he with
<HI>Philalethes</HI> (whose very oversights he ad∣opts)
supposeth to have been ascribed to
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> (<HI>P.</HI> 38.) And this wri∣ter
also, as well as the <HI>Cantabrigian,</HI> must
needs take upon him to explain the mo∣tive
of my writing against Fluxions:
which he gives out, with great assurance,
to have been, because Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
had presumed to interpose in Prophecies
and Revelations, and to decide in religi∣ons
affairs (<HI>P.</HI> 4.) which is so far from be∣ing
true, that, on the contrary, I have a
high value for those learned remains of
that Great Man, whose original and free
Genius is an eternal reproach to that tribe
of followers, who are always imitating,
but never resemble him. This specimen
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
of Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s truth will be a warning
to the Reader to use his own eyes, and
in obscure points never to trust the Gen∣tleman's
Candour, who dares to misrepre∣sent
the plainest.</P>
<P N="3">III. I WAS thinking to have said no
more concerning this Author's perform∣ance.
But lest he should imagine himself
too much neglected, I intreat the Reader
to have the patience to peruse it; and if
he finds any one point of the doctrine of
Fluxions cleared up, or any one objection
in the Analyst answered, or so much
as fairly stated, let him then make his
compliments to the Author. But if he
can no more make sense of what this Gen∣tleman
has written than I can, he will
need no answer to it. Nothing is easier,
than for a man to translate or copy, or
compose a plausible discourse of some pages
in technical terms, whereby he shall
make a shew of saying somewhat, although
neither the Reader nor himself understand
one Title of it. Whether this be the
case of Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> and whether he un∣derstands
either Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> or me,
or himself, (whatever I may think) I shall
not take upon me to say. But one thing
I know, that many an unmeaning Speech
passeth for significant by the mere assu∣rance
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
of the Speaker, till he cometh to
be catechised upon it; and then the truth
sheweth it self. This Vindicator, indeed,
by his dissembling nine parts in ten of the
difficulties proposed in the Analyst, shew∣eth
no inclination to be catechised by me.
But his Scholars have a right to be in∣formed.
I, therefore, recommend it to
them, not to be imposed on by hard
words and magisterial assertions, but care∣fully
to pry into his sense, and sift his
meaning, and particularly to insist on a
distinct answer to the following questions.</P>
<P N="4">IV. LET them ask him, whether he
can conceive velocity without motion, or
motion without extension, or extension
without magnitude? If he answers that
he can, let him teach them to do the
same. If he cannot, let him be asked,
how he reconciles the idea of a Fluxion
which he gives (<HI>P.</HI> 13.) with common
sense? Again, let him be asked, whether
nothing be not the product of nothing
multiplied by something? And if so, when
the difference between the Gnomon and
the sum of the rectangles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vindication, p. 17.</NOTE> vanisheth,
whether the rectangles themselves do not
also vanish? <HI>i. e.</HI> when <HI>a b</HI> is nothing,
whether <HI>A b</HI> + <HI>B a</HI> be not also nothing?
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
<HI>i. e.</HI> whether the momentum of <HI>AB</HI> be not
nothing? Let him then be asked, what his
momentums are good for, when they are thus
brought to nothing. Again, I wish he
were asked to explain the difference be∣tween
a magnitude infinitely small and a
magnitude infinitely diminished. If he saith
there is no difference: Then let him be
further asked how he dares to explain the
method of Fluxions by the <HI>Ratio</HI> of mag∣nitudes
infinitely diminished (<HI>P.</HI> 9.) when
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> hath expressly excluded
all consideration of quantities infinitely
small<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Introduction to his Quadratures.</NOTE>? If this able Vindicator should say
that quantities infinitely diminished are
nothing at all, and consequently that, ac∣cording
to him, the first and last <HI>Ratio</HI>'s
are proportions between nothings, let him
be desired to make sense of this, or explain
what he means by <HI>proportion between no∣things.</HI>
If he should say the ultimate pro∣portions
are the <HI>Ratio</HI>'s of mere limits, then
let him be asked how the limits of lines
can be proportioned or divided? After all,
who knows but this Gentleman, who hath
already complained of me for an uncom∣mon
way of treating Mathematics and Ma∣thematicians
(<HI>P.</HI> 5.) may (as well as the
<HI>Cantabrigian</HI>) cry out, <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>In∣quisition,</HI>
when he finds himself thus closely
pursued and beset with Interrogatories?
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
That we may not, therefore, seem too hard
on an innocent man, who probably meant
nothing, but was betray'd by following
another into difficulties and straits that he
was not aware of, I shall propose one single
expedient, by which his Disciples (whom
it most concerns) may soon satisfy them∣selves,
whether this Vindicator really un∣derstands
what he takes upon him to vin∣dicate.
It is in short, that they would ask
him to explain the second, third or fourth
Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this the
Touchstone of his Vindication. If he can
do it, I shall own my self much mistaken:
If he cannot, it will be evident that he was
much mistaken in himself, when he pre∣sumed
to defend Fluxions without so much
as knowing what they are. So having put
the merits of the cause on this issue, I leave
him to be tried by his Scholars.</P>
