<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>DURING my residence on
the Continent, I was so
fortunate as to contract an ac∣quaintance
with the present
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Bishop of M—o, who was for
many years superior of the
Scots College at Seville. To
that amiable man I am indebt∣ed
for the following letters;
which were discovered by him,
during his residence in Seville,
at the bottom of an old chest,
which stood in a deserted
and traditionally haunted room
in the attic story of the Col∣lege.</P>
<P>THE letters were transcribed
into a book that was bound in
vellum, and in good condition.
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
From the date of the Preface
which is prefixed to them, they
appear to have been <HI>collected</HI> at
the close of the last century.
At what time they were <HI>written,</HI>
it is impos sible now to deter∣mine;
though probably about
the year 1671, as about that
time the dukedom of Arandina
became extinct by the death
of Don John twentieth and last
Duke.</P>
<P>THE author of the Preface
which is prefixed to these let∣ters
seems to have been well
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
acquainted; with the history of
the house of Arandina; and it
is by no means improbable,
that Father Alberto, who makes
so important a figure through
the whole of the history, was
the person who thus preserved
it.</P>
<P>HAD these pages been the
production of a later period; I
should have been led to sup∣pose,
that the character of Al∣berto
had been copied from
that of the Bishop of M—,
whose many amiable qualities,
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
and distinguished talents, have
insured to him the respect and
esteem of all who are so fortu∣nate
as to rank in the number
of his acquaintance. Nor can
I lay down my pen without
expressing the satisfaction with
which I embrace this opportu∣nity
of testifying my respect
for that truly amiable man;
whose virtues would reflect ho∣nour
on the highest station, and
whose piety would adorn any
communion.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
How far the Editor has acted
with propriety in availing him∣self
of the permission to print
these letters, will be determi∣ned
by the public; to whose
inspection they are now respect∣fully
submitted.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
PREFIXED TO THE
LETTERS,
BY THE
PERSON WHO COLLECTED THEM.</HEAD>
<P>DONNA Isabella della Villarea
was the only fruit of an un∣fortunate
marriage. Her father was
the younger brother of Don John,
twentieth and last Duke of Arandina,
and grandee of the first order. Don
Frederick, the father of Isabella, at
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
an early period of his life, became
strongly attached to Donna Eliza,
daughter of Don Carlos de Ulloa, a
grandee of the second class.</P>
<P>THE narrowness of Don Frederick's
fortune retarded for a long time his
union with Donna Eliza. At length,
wearied with the frequent disappoint∣ments
he experienced, and not see∣ing
any appearances in his favour,
he determined no longer to defer the
completion of his happiness. He
had, indeed, repeatedly applied to
his brother for assistance; but the
only answer which he obtained from
the Duke was, that younger brothers
had better not marry. Don Frede∣rick
now stated his case to Donna
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
Eliza; who heroically preferred a
<HI>cottage</HI> with Don Frederick, to a
palace with the Duke of Castillo
Neuovo, who at that time paid his
addresses to her.</P>
<P>DON FREDERICK was soon blessed
with the hand of Donna Eliza;
whilst the family of Ulloa, incensed
to the last degree at the step she had
taken, determined never more to see
her.</P>
<P>MEANTIME, Frederick and Eliza
retired to a small farm he had pur∣chased
in the province of Andalusia;
where, for some months, they ex∣perienced
a state of uninterrupted
felicity; to which, however, a pe∣riod
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
was at length put by the villany
of the Duke of Castillo Neuovo; for
one night, as Don Frederick was re∣turning
home totally unattended,
the Duke, aided by a party of <HI>bravos,</HI>
attacked him. Don Frederick de∣fended
himself with the utmost va∣lour;
and, after dispatching the
Duke and two of the villains, sunk,
covered with wounds, and expired.
The remainder of the party instant∣ly
retired with the body of the
Duke, whilst that of Don Frederick,
was soon after found by some pea∣sants
and carried home. The first
person who encountered the mourn∣ful
procession was Donna Eliza.
The scene that ensued is too horrible
for description. Suffice it to say,
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
that in a few hours Isabella was
born, and her mother recovered
by slow degrees from that phrensy
into which the death of Don Frede∣rick
had driven her. Donna Eliza
continued in her retirement in An∣dalusia,
where she indulged her me∣lancholy,
by spending great part of
each day at the monument which
she had reared over the dust of her
beloved Lord. In this manner had
five years elapsed, when Donna
Eliza found herself seized with a
fever, which she was assured would
prove mortal. No sooner did she
receive the awful intelligence, than
she addressed the following letter
to the Duke of Arandina, to be
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
delivered by Isabella after her
death.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DON JOHN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is in acts of mercy only that
man can resemble Heaven. Re∣member
<HI>that</HI> whilst you read this
letter; which will not be delivered
to you till the trembling hand that
writes, and the bleeding heart that
dictates, are no more.</P>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE, that by marry∣ing
your too-amiable brother I inju∣red
him irreparably. I reduced
him to unmerited poverty; I depri∣ved
him of your friendship and your
protection; and yet could only re∣compence
all these losses by bestow∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
on him my unworthy self: A re∣ward
highly inadequate to his de∣serts;
but the unfortunate Eliza had
no other to conser, and the too-generous
Don Frederick was satis∣fied.</P>
<P>GREAT as is the pleasure with
which I behold my approaching dis∣solution,
when I consider that a few
hours will certainly reunite me to
my much-beloved. Frederick; yet
my pleasure is far from unalloyed,
when I reflect that the only fruit
of our fatal short-lived union, the
hapless Isabella, whose misfortunes
were coeval with her birth, will (if
you withhold your protection) be
exposed to innumerable dangers.
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>
Have pity, then, on the helpless
orphan, who will deliver this to
your hands; and who, if you desert
her, will be left to the wide world,
without one friendly hand to guide
her infant steps. Reflect, Don John,
on the ills to which the continuation
of your resentment must expose her.
Do not punish Isabella for the errors
of her unhappy parents. They have
drunk deep of the bitter cup of afflict∣tion,
do not oblige her to swallow
the dregs. By kindness to my Isa∣bella,
you will atone for all the suf∣ferings
you have caused me. I,
with my dying breath, forgive you;
and righteous Heaven will also par∣don
you, if you are a protector to
my dear insant. A tremor, that now
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
pervades my whole frame, obliges
me to conclude with once more as∣suring
you of the pardon, nay, of the
esteem, of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>The unfortunate
ELIZA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>SCARCELY had Eliza finished this
letter, when, clasping Isabella in her
arms, she ceased to sigh, and sought
her Frederick in the realms of bliss.
No sooner was Eliza entombed with
her Frederick, than Isabella was sent
to the Castle of Villarea, where Don
John then resided. On her arrival,
she delivered to him her mother's
letter, which he read with consider∣able
attention; and, after pausing
upon it for some time, he ordered his
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
niece to be placed in the convent of
Ventina, where she remained till the
age of sixteen. The Duke then de∣termined
to place her in his own
Castle: a determination with which
she was by no means pleased; as,
from the specimens which she had
seen of her uncle's behaviour during
two or three short visits at the con∣vent,
she had no great prospect of
happiness under his roof or in his
society; Added to this, she could
not bid an eternal adieu to those
walls where she had passed so many
happy hours, without feeling some
pangs, especially as she was then to
be for ever separated from the friends
of her youth, of whom the most di∣stinguished
was Donna Laura de
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
Cassildina. The parting of these la∣dies
was highly affecting to <HI>both,</HI>
but especially to Donna Isabella,
who looked with horror on a world,
which she had been ever taught to
consider as worse than it really is.</P>
<P>OF her reception at Villarea, a
full account is to be seen in her first
letter to Donna Laura, with whom
she constantly corresponded, and to
whom she communicated every event
that befel her during their separa∣tion.</P>
<P>THUS, then, I have collected all
the facts relating to the life of Donna
Isabella della Villarea; a woman di∣stinguished
by every amiable quality;
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
in whom even the prying eye
of envy could not discover a flaw,
whilst malice Itself paid her virtue
the tribute of silence.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From the Castle of Villarea.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to the sacred injunc∣tions
of my Laura, I shall not
fail to inform her of every event, how∣ever
trivial, that may occur in this
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>
dreary solitude: A solitude which
alone can be banished by the pre∣sence
of her to whom I now write.
For her presence, however, I have no
reason to hope; I am almost tempted
to say, I do not entertain a wish.
My uncle's behaviour could not fail
to render this place truly disagree∣able
to my dearest friend; and great
as the happiness of her society must
always be to the wretched Isabella,
it would suffer an alloy which in the
end would prove its destruction,
when I reflected that I was a source
of pain to her who has been the
friend of my youth, who so kindly
soothed my woes, and to whom I am
indebted for the small portion of se∣licity
which I once enjoyed—but
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>
of which I am now for ever
de∣prived.</P>
<P>MY Laura will not be a little an∣xious
to hear what was the reception
I met with from the Duke on my
arrival. He received me at the gate,
surrounded by a numerous train of
domestics in rich dresses, who ap∣peared
to me the finest people I had
ever seen; and though I have been
here some days, I cannot yet recon∣cile
myself to giving them my or∣ders.</P>
<P>MY uncle's reception of me was
formal and polite. He told the ser∣vants,
that they must henceforth con∣sider
me as their mistress, and must.
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
pay an implicit obedience to my com∣mands.
He then introduced me to
his father-confessor, who resides in
the house with him, and who ap∣pears
to be about fifty, has a plea∣sing
countenance, an air strongly
tinctured with melancholy, and man∣ners
highly polished. From what I
have seen of him, I have reason to
hope he will prove an agreeable com∣panion,
A summons to attend the
Duke leaves me only time to sub∣scribe
myself.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the same to the same.</HEAD>
<P>TEN thousand thanks for my
Laura's letter: it has scarce
ever been out of my hands since
its arrival. The affectionate re∣gard
which you so kindly express
for me, serves only to increase my
reget, when I reflect that I am for
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>
ever banished from so amiable a
friend. But, as you have often ob∣served,
it is our duty to submit, with∣out
repining, to the dispensations of
Providence, whose conduct to short-sighted
mortals seems sometimes se∣vere,
when it is directed to their
good, and when a different conduct
would involve them in misery. But
my business at present is not to mo∣ralize,
but to describe the Castle and,
its environs. The house is ancient,
and the building has an air of me∣lancholy
grandeur, well suited to my
disposition. The orange groves that
surround it, and which are now in
full blossom, add greatly to the beau∣ty
of the place; and, would Heaven
grant me the presence of my Laura,
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
I should esteem it a perfect paradise.
A poor compliment this to Villarea;
as earth contains not the spot, how∣ever
barren or however horrid, that
would not appear to me a paradise,
if that spot contained my Laura.</P>
<P>THE peasantry are poor and lazy;
but as my uncle's, allowance to me is
liberal, I can remedy the former,
though not the latter evil. Indeed
I greatly fear all attempts on that
head will prove ineffectual; as every
writer, who has mentioned the pea∣santry
of Spain, speaks of them as in∣dolent
in the extreme. The most in∣dustrious
peasantry of whom I have
ever read any account, are those of
England; though, having only seen
<PB N="32" REF="29"/>
them represented by writers of their
own country, I know not what cre∣dit
is to be given to the representa∣tions.</P>
<P>IN your letter, you express a wish
to become more acquainted with my
uncle. Of him, however, I know
nothing more than at my first arri∣val,
as he lives chiesty alone; and,
wherever he appears, preserves so
much state, as renders unsuccessful
all attempts to become acquainted
with him.</P>
<P>FATHER ALBERTO is a widely dif∣ferent
character. His pleasing man∣ners
and melancholy air deeply in∣terest
you in every thing that con∣cerns
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>
him. He is so good as to join
me in my walks, and exerts himself
on all occasions to render my resi∣dence
here pleasant. You would
like him much. If all men resem∣bled
him, what a world would this
be! My Laura perhaps would then
quit the peaceful cloister, and adorn
some high station in active life.—
But I must bid you adieu, as, the let∣ters
are called for, and my paper is
nearly exhausted. I will, however,
always leave room enough to admit
of my subscribbing myself,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours unalterably,
And ever affectionately,
ISABELLA</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the same to the same.</HEAD>
<P>MY Laura is too grateful for
my letters; as, were I de∣barred
the privilege of addressing her,
I should not know how to employ
those hours of my life which I do
not consecrate to heaven. But so
great is the pleasure of writing to my
<PB N="35" REF="32"/>
friend, that, whilst I have my pen
in my hand, I almost forget that I
am unfortunate. The Duke is going
to Madrid on business. How happy
is it for me that his excessive <HI>hauteur</HI>
induces him to live entirely in the
country, instead of spending his
whole life in Madrid, as do all men
of his rank! But at Court he finds,
what he will never brook, <HI>superior.</HI>
He leaves me here to guard the Castle
in his absence. I am rejoiced that
I am not of the party, as then I should
have scarcely found time to tell my
Laura how I love her. But as I re∣main
at Villarea, I shall have little
else to do, except to offer up prayers
for her happiness; an employment
highly grateful, and of which I shall
<PB N="36" REF="33"/>
never be weary. No Laura, never will
I cease entreating Heaven to shower
down its choicest blessings on your
head. May your days flow gently
on; may tranquil pleasure gild your
future years; and never may the mis∣fortunes
of Isabella extend their
baneful influence over the fate of her
friend.—The Duke is just about to
depart, and has ordered me to his
apartment to receive his commands.
—The Duke is gone, attended by
a numerous train. The Castle really
seems like a desert. Were you to
see it, you would suppose some fatal
catastrophe had happened in the fa∣mily
—so great an effect can the ab∣sence
even of the most insignificant
people produce.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="34"/>
FATHER ALBERTO has just been
here. He advises me to fly to you
for a few days. How good, how
amiable he is! He undertakes to
settle it with the Duke; and I shall
be with you almost as soon as this
letter. O with what ecstacy do I
look forward to our meeting! When
I shall embrace you, and assure you
in person how sincerely I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the same to the same.</HEAD>
<P>HERE I am at length returned
to Villarea and to misery.
O, Laura! what did I not feel when
forced to tear myself from your
arms!—to leave those much-loved
walls, within which we have spent
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>
so many happy hours; when, free
from care and free from danger, our
time was devoted to Heaven and to our
own improvement. On those hours
and on that employment I reflect
with pleasure mingled with regret;
for though they still are yours, to
me they never will return. How
painful is that thought!—And shall
we never meet again? I trust we
shall: and be assured, that no event
(however gloomy its appearance)
will by me be deemed unfortunate,
which restores Isabella to Ventina
and to you.</P>
<P>THE Duke is just returned, and
approves of my having visited you.
<PB N="40" REF="37"/>
Father Alberto has invited me to
walk; I shall therefore defer the
conclusion of my letter till my re∣turn
from my ramble, which will
not fail to be pleasant, as he is of
the party. So adieu for the pre∣sent.
On my return I shall resume
my pen.</P>
<P>AFTER a long walk, I am return∣ed
home, and with pleasure sit down
to address my Laura. My pleasure,
indeed, is the greater, as my amiable
friend Alberto has begun the rela∣tion
of his own memoirs; so that now
I shall be at no loss for materials of
which to compose my letters. I shall,
however, defer entering, on his story
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>
till my next; and I shall conclude
with assuring my Laura, that I
am</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the same to the same.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are, no doubt, my dear
Laura, anxious to become ac∣quainted
with the memoirs of Alber∣to.
I shall therefore proceed to re∣late
them in his own words as near∣ly
as I can.—</P>
<Q><P>Your goodness
(said he) having often led you to ex∣press
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>
a wish that you were acquaint∣ed
with my history, I will, without
reserve, communicate to you all the
particulars of it with, which I myself
am acquainted.</P>
<P>FORTY years ago, the master of
a Spanish merchantman being on a
voyage to England, whither he was
bound to dispose of his cargo, it hap∣pened
that one night there arose a
violent storm. Just as it began, he
descried an English ship making sig∣nals
of distress; but the violence of
the hurricane prevented him from
rendering her any assistance, and she
perished in the storm. The next
morning, the winds being now calm∣ed,
he discovered me, then not ap∣parently
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>
above, a year old, floating
on a piece of the wreck. He in∣stantly
took me on board; and, some
signs of life appearing, all attempts
were made for my recovery; and
these at last proving successful, my
preserver, when all inquiries after
my original proved ineffectual, adop∣ted
me as his son. No fewer than
three English ships had perished in
that storm; nor could he find any one
who knew that any of them had a
child on board. Thus was I pre∣cluded
for ever from discovering to
whom I owed my birth,—and whe∣ther
or not both my parents perished
in that fatal night;—fatal to <HI>me,</HI>
because it deprived me of my natu∣ral
protectors, and yet did not rob
<PB N="45" REF="42"/>
me of a life that has been perpetually
overcast with the gloomy clouds of
misfortune. But the ways of Provi∣dence
are unsearchable; and it is our
duty to submit to its will without re∣pining.
Nor have I any doubt but
that for wise and good reasons my
life was preserved from the merciless
waves. Under the roof of my se∣cond
father (whose name I bear), the
first sixteen years of my life were
passed in ease and tranquillity, when
the good man proposed that I should
accompany him on a voyage to Italy.
As was natural at my age, I embra∣ced
with pleasure an offer of seeing
foreign countries, and a few days
brought us in sight of the Italian
coast. On our arrival at port, I ha∣stened
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>
on shore, that I might gratify
my curiosity, and make observations
on the inhabitants of a country which
had so often given lords to the world.
It happened, that one night as I was
walking alone on a retired part of
the beach, I heard the shrieks of some
person in distress, and they appeared
to be those of a female. I followed
the sound; and soon discovered two
ruffians dragging a most beautiful
woman towards a boat that waited
for them. I flew with the utmost
speed to rescue the distressed fair
one, and was happy enough to prove
successful in the enterprise; for ha∣ving
dispatched one of the villains,
the other made a precipitate retreat,
leaving me master of the field.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="47" REF="44"/>
Here, however, Laura, I must stop,
as here Father Alberto was summon∣ed
to attend the Duke. The next
post shall give you more information
concerning the fair unknown; in the
mean time, believe me</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the same to the same.</HEAD>
<P>FATHER ALBERTO'S goodness ha∣ving
furnished me with ample
matter for another letter, it is with
the greatest pleasure that I now ad∣dress
my Laura. I would indeed
write oftener than I do, were it not
that the deep solitude in which I
<PB N="49" REF="46"/>
dwell furnishes nothing worthy of
notice. When I take up my pen to
address you, I relinquish it for want
of matter. Were I to say I love you
sincerely, <HI>that</HI> you know already;
so that when I have nothing new to
communicate, you must not blame
me for being silent. Thus much for
myself in answer to your last. We
will now proceed to the memoirs of
our friend.</P>
<P>"AFTER (continued he) the vil∣lains
were defeated, I was left at full
leisure to contemplate the fair un∣known,
who soon recovered such a
degree of recollection as to thank me
for the service which I had render∣ed
her. After gazing with ecstacy
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>
on the most perfect form that I had
ever beheld, I requested permission
to attend her home. To this she
consented; and we proceeded to a
very high wall, through which, by
an iron gate, we entered a most
beautiful garden. As we proceeded
toward the house, which terminated
the view, she informed me that her
name was Estafania; that she was
the only daughter of a considerable
merchant of the name of Altino, and
heiress to all his fortunes. <Q>To that
indeed (said she) I attribute the
calamity from which your valour
has rescued me. The <HI>fame of my
wealth,</HI> rather than the <HI>lustre of my
charms,</HI> procured me many suitors.
Amongst them was Alcanzar, for
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>
whom I conceived an insuperable
aversion, which his subsequent
conduct has fully justified. He be∣came
much exasperated at my be∣haviour,
and determined to carry
me off by force; in which attempt
he would have succeeded, had not
your sword rid me for ever of
such a dangerous enemy. The
service which you have done to
me is such as I never can repay.
I will, however, now introduce
you to the presence of those, who
will endeavour to testify the grati∣tude
they must entertain for your
conduct towards their daughter.</Q>
Saying this, the conducted me into a
saloon, in the midst of which there
played a fountain, surrounded by
<PB N="52" REF="49"/>
orange-trees in large vases."—But
here, Laura, I must stop, as the time
will only admit of my subscribbing

<P>YOU are no doubt, Laura, very
anxious for the sequel of Al∣berto's
narrative: I shall therefore
proceed in his own words as nearly
as I can recollect them.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="51"/>
"IN the saloon I was introduced to
the father and mother of Estafania;
who, on hearing the story of her
escape, returned their most grateful
thanks to her deliverer. After re∣maining
some time, I proposed to re∣turn
to the ship; and, having re∣quested
permission to make personal
inquiry after the health of Estafania,
was with difficulty permitted to re∣tire.
They assured me how happy I
should make them by a frequent re∣petition
of my visit; and the next
day I accordingly returned, and was
received with every possible demon∣stration
of gratitude. Her parents
now expressed a wish to know to
whom they were endebted for the
deliverance of their daughter. I in∣formed
<PB N="55" REF="52"/>
them with the utmost frank∣ness
of my situation, and gave them
a short sketch of my memoirs. When
I concluded, they expressed their
hopes that fortune would now prove
propitious, and would cease to per∣secute
me (here, however, they
were, alas! mistaken.): They pre∣sented
me with a ring of considerable
value; and desired me, during my
residence there, to consider their
house as my home: A request with
which: I most readily complied, as
the charms; of Estafania had made
me her slave. For several weeks I
enjoyed the most exquisite happi∣ness;
but it was too great to last. Our
business being concluded, we prepa∣red
to visit Spain. I quitted Italy
<PB N="56" REF="53"/>
with the utmost reluctance: but I
was a dependent; and could not
therefore think of remaining with
Estafania, although my vanity led
me to believe that I was not disagree∣able
to her. When the dreaded
hour of departure arrived, I repair∣ed
to the house of Altino, and found
Estafania sitting alone in the saloon.
As it was the last opportunity I
should have of seeing her, I deter∣mined
to reveal the sentiments with
which she had inspired me. She re∣ceived
my declaration with emotion,
but devoid of surprise; assured me,
that time should never efface from
her memory the essential service
which I had rendered her; that if
ever she saw me more, she should
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>
think herself too happy; that as I
proposed returning to Italy the next
summer, she would, in the mean
time, endeavour to obtain her pa∣rents
consent, that she might bestow
her <HI>hand</HI> on one who, she said, had
well deserved her <HI>heart.</HI>"—Here,

<P>FROM this morning's walk I have
learned the rest of Alberto's
tale.—"After (continued he) I
had taken leave of her father and
mother, I embarked for Spain, and
<PB N="59" REF="56"/>
a short voyage landed us at Cadiz.
But, ah! how altered was I since I
sailed thence! I had sustained a loss
we never can suffer but once. The
change it had effected was so striking
as to be observed by every one who
saw me. I now played none but
plaintive airs, and seldom touched
my guitar without bedewing it with
my tears. I was become the victim
of melancholy; and the image of
Estafania was never absent from my
mind. At night, when fancy was
permitted to rove unfettered by the
chains of reason, I was perpetually
wafted to those scenes of former joys,
the shores of Italy, where indeed I
enjoyed a bliss supreme, the society of
my Estafania. But, alas! the blissful
<PB N="60" REF="57"/>
phantoms vanished at the approach
of day, and each new sun beheld my
griefs increase. In this manner near
a year had elapsed, when my kind
friend the shipmaster informed me
that he was soon to revisit Italy. You
will easily conceive with what readi∣ness
I embraced the proposal, and
with what anxiety I embarked; but
when the shores of Italy appeared,
my anxiety became unutterable.
Sometimes my fancy represented
Estafania welcoming me with joy;
sometimes her <HI>monument</HI> rose to my
view; and, at other times, me-thought
I saw her blessing the arms
of some happy rival. At length,
however, the wished-for dreaded
hour of debarkation arrived, and I
<PB N="61" REF="58"/>
hastened to land."—Here a flood
of tears relieved my worthy friend;
and here I shall for the present con∣clued
my narrative. Adieu, dearest

<P>"SCARCE (continued he) had
I reached the shore, before
my attention was arrested by the
sight of a marble monument, erected
beneath the shade of a large willow,
<PB N="63" REF="60"/>
which seemed to weep over the urn
it shadowed. I approached with
prophetic horror, as if I had known
that it contained the ashes of the too
amiable woman, in whose cause I
was once so happy as to draw a suc∣cessful
sword. What did I not feel,
when, on a nearer approach, I dis∣covered
that it was inscribed with
the name of ESTAFANIA! Chil∣led
with horror at the sight, I re∣mained
motionless, till recalled to
myself by the approach of a man who
had long served the family of her
whom I adored. From him I learned,
that some months had elapsed since
Heaven had claimed its own. A con∣sumption
which attacked my amiable
mistress soon terminated her sublu∣nary
<PB N="64" REF="61"/>
existence, and snatched her
from the arms of two worthy and af∣fectionate
parents; who, unable to
behold without agony the scenes of
former bliss, had removed to a distant
territory, leaving their mansion to
the care of servants; having deter∣mined
never to revisit scenes that
must necessarily call to remembrance
the virtues and the fate of an only
child, with whom perished all their
hopes of earthly happiness.</P>
<P>HAVING indulged my grief for
some time, I returned to the vessel;
and, after passing a sortnight in a
state too horrible to be described, I
returned to Spain. Previous to my
departure, I once more ventured to
<PB N="65" REF="62"/>
visit the urn that contained all the
happiness I ever possessed, and with
an aching heart bid a last adieu to
the shores of Italy."—Here we

worldly circumstances,; and had

of misfortune to soften the manners

themselves have suffered, are ever

<P>YESTERDAY, my Isabella, I
pronounced the solemn vow,
by which I am bound to consecrate
solely to religion the remainder of my
days. Many have considered this
seclusion from the world as an act
<PB N="71" REF="68"/>
highly meritorious, though to me it
appears in a light widely different.
By retiring from the world at the
early dawn of life, we in a manner
quit the station assigned us by Pro∣vidence;
and, however we may em∣ploy
ourselves, can at best be deemed
but deserters. Some there are, in∣deed,
whose weak virtue is ill qua∣lified
to resist the powerful attacks
it must daily experience from vice
and folly: these do wisely to fly, ra∣ter
than, by a feeble and unsuccess∣ful
resistance, to increase the triumph
of a wicked world. Conscious that
the small portion of virtue which I
possess would scarcely be sufficient
to support me in the hour of trial, I
have determined to shun a foe I am
<PB N="72" REF="69"/>
not able to encounter. I am, how∣ever,
well aware with what appro∣bation
Heaven beholds the conduct
of those who, though surrounded by
the strongest temptations, and allu∣red
by all the incitements of plea∣sure,
continue with unshaken perse∣verance
to tread the paths of virtue,
and by their bright example reflect
honour on their nature and their
God. For an undertaking so ardu∣ous,
Heaven has fully qualified my
Isabella. Each noble, each heavenly
virtue, finds an asylum in her breast,
where they all unite to direct her
thoughts and her actions. The re∣ward
of a life so employed will, no
doubt, be proportionally splendid.
That it may be long before you claim
<PB N="73" REF="70"/>
that reward, is, however, the since∣rest
wish of one, to whom (were hea∣ven
to claim its own) this world
would be a vale of tears.</P>

to DONNA LAURA DE CASSILDINA.</HEAD>
<P>OH, my Laura! how can I paint
my present feelings? The
Duke being suddenly called from
home for a few days, I determined
to gratify an inclination I had long
felt, and to indulge my feelings by
<PB N="75" REF="72"/>
visiting the hallowed spot where the
honoured ashes of my parents moul∣der.
Accompanied by Alberto, I
set out for the village where my in∣fant
years were spent. At the close
of day we reached the hamlet; and
having secured a lodging at the house
of the Curè, I repaired, with a throb∣bing
heart, to the tomb of my pa∣rents.
A grove of cypress appeared.
I entered with cautious steps, as if I
feared to waken those who slept. It
is a covered monument in the form
of an altar, composed of black and
white marble. I would have advan∣ced,
but the scene was too much for
my weak spirits. I fainted in the
arms of Alberto and Marianne.
When their attention restored me, I
<PB N="76" REF="73"/>
approached the tomb; and, by the
pale moon's uncertain light, read
the inscription, which mentioned
their names, and the dates of their
respective deaths. O Heaven, Laura,
what were my feelings! I fell on my
knees,—I bedewed the hallowed
marble with my tears,—called on
each, dear departed shade;—then
turned to heaven my streaming eyes,
and begged a blessing.</P>
<P>IN vain Alberto tried to remove
me from the monument: for me it
bad resistless attractions; and whilst
memory is mine, shall be for ever
dear. At length I was persuaded to
retire; but it was with the greatest
difficulty I could ever prevail on my∣self
<PB N="77" REF="74"/>
to quit the awful scene. The
stream, that flowed with melancholy
murmurs through the grove, seemed
to reproach me for quitting the sa∣cred
spot; but half the night was
spent, and Alberto feared a longer
stay might injure my health. I com∣plied
with his wish. On my arrival
at the Curè's, I instantly retired to
my apartment; and, notwithstand∣ing
the dejection of my spirits, I fell
asleep. Fancy, fleeting fancy, trans∣ported
me back to the tomb of Fre∣deric
and Eliza. It appeared to me,
after I had remained some time kneel∣ing
at their shrine, that the monu∣ment
opened, and that I instantly
entered; the massive portals then
closed, and I waked to lament an
<PB N="78" REF="75"/>
existence that is indeed painful. At
the first dawn of the day I revisited
the grove; and, after shedding some
tributary tears, returned with Al∣berto
to Villarea. Adieu, dearest

<P>A SEVERE illness has for some

hours of returning health to friend∣ship

of so serious and alarming a na∣ture,

that my uncle condescended to

<P>I CANNOT say I was very grateful

as, though it was not then
probable that we should ever meet

the remembrance of the illustrious

<P>OH, Laura, what a scene have
I just witnessed! We went
to walk that we might enjoy the de∣lightful
evening. Scarcely had we
entered the grove that terminates
<PB N="84" REF="81"/>
the lawn, when we were alarmed by
the clashing of swords; and in a
moment my terror was increased to
the highest, at seeing a man with a
sword in his hand, and covered with
blood, spring over the sence. No
sooner did I behold this horrid spec∣tacle,
than I sunk into the arms of
the faithful Marianne. Meanwhile
the stranger who had thus alarmed
us requested our protection, inform∣ing
us that he had just escaped from
assassins, with whom he had long
maintained an unequal combat. Fa∣ther
Alberto having assured him of
protection, directed all his endea∣vours
towards effecting my recovery,
in which he at length succeeded;
<PB N="85" REF="82"/>
and the first object that I beheld was
the bleeding stranger kneeling at my
feet. A sight so horrible, occasioned
an instantaneous relapse 3 and it was
with difficulty my wavering spirit
was ever recalled. How happy if it
then had sought another world, and
united me to my dear, dear parents,
of whom I am for ever talking with

<P>I AM just returned from a visit to
the lodge in company with Al∣berto.
We had an interview with
the unfortunate stranger, who is now
so much recovered from his wounds
as to sit in the garden on a bench for
some hours every day. At our ap∣proach,
<PB N="88" REF="85"/>
he attempted to rise; but
from loss of blood was too feeble.
After recovering himself a little, and
returning his thanks in the most plea∣sing
manner, he thus addressed us:
 <Q>I am the only son of Albino de
Castina a merchant in Cadiz, who
has a small house in this neighbour∣hood,
whither I was going when
attacked by the ruffians, from
whom you so kindly protected me.
They were hired to assassinate me
by a woman of considerable wealth,
who has done me the honour to
entertain sentiments in my favour.
To these I made not a suitable re∣turn;
which has so exasperated her,
that she determined on having a
bloody revenge. On that revenge
<PB N="89" REF="86"/>
I shall ever reflect with pleasure,
since to it. I am indebted for the
honour of being known to the pre∣sent
company. My humble situa∣tion
in life precludes me from testi∣fying
my gratitude in any way

and that my <HI>life</HI> (my only posses∣sion)
will for ever be at the devo∣tion

his grateful effusions; and,
after repeating our injunctions to the

to consecrate to her service the re∣mainder

<P>OH, Laura, I am undone! I have
seen Alonzo. I went alone to walk
in the grove. I had not been long
there when Alonzo, rushing from
amongst the trees, threw himself at
my feet. He earnestly begged a
moment's audience. I weakly com∣plied;
—listened to the most eloquent

eternal love, and has ruined the
peace of Isabella. I fear I love him,
but I will conquer myself. Am I
not right? How do you advise me to
act? Do, tell me. I am half distrac∣ted:
What must I do? I have ex∣iled

<P>I HAVE just received your letter,
containing a request,—the com∣pliance
with which would certainly
be highly inconsistent with prudence.
But, alas! prudence deserted me
where most I needed her support.
My conduct in the grove has already
<PB N="111" REF="108"/>
convinced you, that I am not insen∣sible
of your merit. Do not, how∣ever,
wish to form a connection with
one who has through life been un∣fortunate;
and who, were she to
bestow that hand you so earnestly so∣licit,
would bring, as a portion, mi∣series,
of which she trusts you will
be for ever ignorant. By correspond∣ing
with you, I should only encou∣rage
hopes which I can never grati∣fy;
and, were the Duke to become
acquainted with our correspondence,
I should immediately forfeit his pro∣tection.
You would then receive to
your arms a poor deserted orphan,
whose only inheritance is misfortune,
and whose sole possession is an aching
heart. Do not suffer your reason to
<PB N="112" REF="109"/>
be blinded by a violent, and conse∣quently
short-lived, passion. Before

<P>OH, Laura! that fatal interview
has destroyed my repose. I
insisted on Alonzo's instantly quit∣ting
the neighbourhood; and for∣bade
him my presence for ever. He
retired in silence; but since his de∣parture,
<PB N="114" REF="111"/>
he has written to me request∣ing
my correspondence. This, of
course, I refused; and have urged
such reasons as will, I hope, be deem∣ed
sufficient even by Alonzo. Righte∣ous
heaven! to know Isabella, is to
be unfortunate. I have not the
power of conferring happiness on
any one. All I wish is to render no
one miserable.</P>
<P>INCLOSED you will receive his letter
and my reply. From that reply you
will learn, that he has made some
impression on a heart, that was, that
must, be ever yours. O! that when
Providence determined to prolong
Alonzo's days, it had not chosen the
wretched Isabella as its instrument.
<PB N="115" REF="112"/>
I should not then have known that he
existed. My years would, probably,
have elapsed, undisturbed by those

you will only inflict misery on her

<P>NOT satisfied with blasting all
my hopes yourself, you in∣vite
others to join you in the cruel
employment: Your friend Donna
Laura has written to me a long ex∣postulatory
letter, in which she calm∣ly
advises me to desist from my pre∣sent
<PB N="122" REF="119"/>
pursuit, as by that conduct, and
by that <HI>alone,</HI> she says, I can ever
convince you that my gratitude is
lasting. Gratitude,—what a word is
that! If I am permitted to be only
grateful, the preservation of my life
I must consider as a misfortune; for
I love you, I adore you, and feel,
that without a return of love, I must
for ever be wretched. That I am
not worthy of such a return, I am
more sensible than your friend can
be: but if you be determined to lis∣ten
to no addresses but those which
are worthy of you, to the exquisite
happiness resulting from a mutual at∣tachment
you must for ever remain
a stranger; for the man has not yet
been born, whose accomplishments
<PB N="123" REF="120"/>
entitle him to the heart and hand of
Isabella. That in me it is presump∣tion
to pretend to either, I needed
not the information of Donna Laura
to convince me; but from her alone
have I learned, that my birth is the
great obstacle in my way to happi∣ness.
Of the inferiority of my rank
in life to that of the Duke of Aran∣dina
I am not ignorant; but can
Isabella,—can the daughter of Donna
Eliza, put wealth, or titles, or a long
line of ancestry, in the balance, a∣gainst
the purest and most refined
attachment, that ever inhabited a
human breast? Your friend says
that you can,—that you deem my
addresses disgraceful, and that they
inflict misery upon you. If this be
<PB N="124" REF="121"/>
indeed the case, I will cease to urge
them. That I should ever cease to
love you, till I cease to exist, is im∣possible;
but my love shall not be
your torment: may you be happy,
though I must be wretched. But,
surely, a mind angelic as yours can∣not
delight in the wretchedness of
others! And since your correspond∣ence,
as a friend, would afford
much relief to my aching heart,
<HI>that,</HI> I hope, you will not refuse, to
one who will receive with ecstacy,
and remember with gratitude, the in∣estimable
gift. If even this favour be
denied me, I will instantly bid an eter∣nal
adieu to Spain, and wander over
the world, till death shall kindly put a

I had from your gardener, who was

<P>AT the request of your Isabella,
I have taken up my pen, to
communicate to you every circumstance
relating to her present misfor∣tune.
Last night the Duke return∣ed,
and retired to his apartment
<PB N="147" REF="144"/>
without any thing remarkable in his
conduct. But this morning he or∣dered
all the servants to attend him
in the great hall; when, producing
a letter from a woman of the name
of Gonzara (the woman who endea∣vored
to procure the assassination of
Alonzo), he obliged the gardener to
read it aloud. It contained a full
account of Alonzo's rencounter with
Isabella in the grove, as well as of
the parting scene which took place
in my absence. This account, she
said, was communicated to her by
the gardener; who now threw himself
on his knees, and implored the
Duke's pardon for having concealed
the affair from his knowledge. No
sooner was the Duke convinced that
<PB N="148" REF="145"/>
his information was well founded,
than his appearance ceased to be hu∣man.
The man was instantly dis∣missed
for having concealed from the
Duke what, for a few dollars, he had
communicated to Gonzara. Poor
Isabella, during this scene, had
swooned. Happily every attempt to
recover, her proved ineffectual; so
that she was insensible of the abuse
with which she was loaded by the
Duke. I intreated the Duke to be
less violent; assuring him that I had
been the adviser of Isabella through
the whole of the affair, at least as
far as related to receiving Alonzo
when wounded, and to procuring
a proper attendance to be paid to
him during his illness. Adding, at
<PB N="149" REF="146"/>
the same time, that illustrious as was
the house of Arandina, it must ever
receive additional lustre from acts of
mercy and benevolence; and that no
station, however exalted, could ex∣empt
us from the duties which we
owe to our fellow-pilgrims in the
vale of tears. To this the Duke re∣plied,
that I was the first person who
had ever proposed to convert his
gardener's lodge into an infirmary
for all rogues who happened to quar∣rel
on his estate; and that both his
niece and I were very much to blame
for the part we had acted. I said,
Whatever might be the errors of Isa∣bella,
I was sure they would, on
inquiry, prove to be those of the
head, and not of the heart; and that
<PB N="150" REF="147"/>
the former were very excusable in
people of her age, and who, like her,
were totally unacquainted with the
customs of the world. He at length
became a little pacified, permitted
Isabella to be removed, and postpo∣ned
any farther inquiry till to-mor∣row;

<P>THE illness of your friend is this

she is now very feverish, and I fear
in great danger; she is not yet de∣lirious;
but weeps incessantly, and
sighs out the name of Laura. Her
<PB N="152" REF="149"/>
love for you is, indeed, very great;
and she is well worthy of that affect∣tion
which we both entertain for her;
she is certainly an angel in flesh and
blood. Much as she now suffers
from his treachery, she has insisted
on my carrying the gardener thirty
dollars, that he and his family may
not suffer want an their dismission
from the Duke's service: For, said
she, though he has greatly injured
me, and betrayed the trust I reposed
in him; yet, perhaps, he was in
want of money, and could not with∣stand
the proffered bribe. At any
rate, his <HI>family</HI> are innocent; and <HI>they</HI>

She has preserved the copies of all

<P><PB N="155" REF="152"/>
The original letters of Alonzo are,
she says, in your possession, as well as
her answers. Had Isabella been
more versed in the ways of the
world, she would certainly not have
permitted Alonzo to Correspond with
her. But how few are there whose
lives are marked with a single im∣prudence,
and that of no very se∣rious
nature!</P>
<P>AT her request, I communicated
her letters and those of Alonzo to
the Duke, who raved like a mad∣man.
He recounted all his ances∣tors
for thirty generations; called on
them to pour down vengeance on
the head of their disgraceful descend∣ant,
the amiable Isabella; vowed
<PB N="176" REF="153"/>
eternal vengeance to Alonzo, for
whom he sent a messenger requiring
his immediate attendance. In vain
did I endeavour to place the conduct
of Isabella in the most favourable
point of view; in vain did I observe
that she discouraged all hopes in the
breast of Alonzo. He still continued
to rave at Isabella, till on the arrival
of Alonzo his fury took another
course. No sooner did this unfor∣tunate
youth appear, than he loaded
him with every possible insult, and
at last struck him. On this, Alonzo
drew his sword, but happily was dis∣armed
by the attendants. The Duke
now ordered his hands to be tied;
and producing his patent of creation,
read it aloud to Alonzo. In it were
<PB N="177" REF="154"/>
enumerated thirty titles of honour;
and amongst others, the Earldom of
Joppa, Viscount Mount Sinai, and
Baron Capernaum, granted to his an∣cestor
by Godfrey de Boulogne King
of Jerusalem.</P>
<P>He now asked Alonzo, how the
son of a merchant could <HI>presume</HI> to
offer himself to a daughter of the
house of Arandina in any higher ca∣pacity
than that of a lackey? Told
him, that, if ever he was found with∣in
his territories, he would secure
him an appointment in the mines;
and then dismissed him. Alonzo
retired vowing vengeance; whilst I
used all my art to dissuade the Duke
<PB N="178" REF="155"/>
from visiting the poor Isabella; and
happily I succeeded. He is now gone
to vent is fury in the grove. That

acceded, are these: That she shall
never more see or correspond with
Alonzo; that she shall in two months
retire to Ventina; and at the end of
her probationary year, shall assume
the veil.</P>
<P>Poor girl! I pity her sincerely; for
she is really attached to Alonzo, and
he seems equally partial to her. I
hope to prevail with the Duke to miti∣gate
her sentence, and that he will not
drive an amiable woman to a perpe∣tual
seclusion from a world which
she would adorn by her splendid
virtues. Heaven never hears with
approbation the vows of involuntary
victims. In that class I must rank

Isabella, as love possesses too great a
portion of her heart to admit of her
becoming a good nun. She may, like
Heloise, retire to a cloister; but love
will erect an altar in her cell, whilst
her sighs will ever fan the destruc∣tive
flame.</P>
<CLOSER>To your prayers, Madam, I shall
now recommend her; whilst I remain,

Just Heaven, what did I not suffer

<P>I HAVE just received your letter,
which to me was totally unin∣telligible.
I was ignorant of your
ever having seen the Duke. The
<PB N="188" REF="165"/>
kind Alberto, unwilling to increase
my pain, had concealed from me
that fatal interview to which your
letter alludes. I do not wonder
that you were exasperated: such
treatment no one could bear. It was
unmerited; it was unjust in the last
extreme. But yet, my Alonzo,
when vengeance lifts her sword and
points it at the breast of Don John,
let the tears of Isabella avert the
blow.—Oh! Alonzo, you can give
me no proof of that affection you
prosess for me—so real, so pleasing,
so generous,—as by pardoning Don
John. O ever bear in mind that he
is the sole earthly protector of that
Isabella whom you profess to adore.
<PB N="197" REF="166"/>
I am poor—Never till now did I
wish for wealth—yet if I possessed it,
I would not injure thy generous soul
by the offer. No! the only bribe I
will ever propose as the reward of
your forbearance—is my friendship;
—<HI>that</HI> is the sole offering I can make
at the shrine of your injured honour.
Oh! may it be deemed sufficient;

<P>ALL my apprehensions for the
safety of the Duke being re∣moved
by the promise Alonzo has
given me not to take vengeance on
<PB N="201" REF="170"/>
him for his conduct at the Castle, I
shall now express to my Laura the
fears I entertain concerning my fu∣ture
happiness. Oh, my Laura, how
little do we short-sighted mortals
know what will be conducive to our
happiness! The time was when I
thought that no event (however
gloomy in its appearance) could be
deemed unfortunate, if it was the
occasion of my returning to Ventina
and to you. But, ah! how chan∣ged
are all my sentiments! How
often have I wearied Heaven with
prayers that I might return to Ven∣tina!
<HI>now</HI> the mention of those walls
fills my mind with horror. Why
this wonderful change? Is Laura
<PB N="202" REF="171"/>
less beloved than before? No, <HI>that</HI>
is impossible.—Is Isabella less ena∣moured
of virtue than she once was?
She hopes not.—Is her heart a stran∣ger
to love? Ah, no! <HI>that</HI> is the sad
truth—Alonzo is beloved. Within
Ventina's walls he never must ap∣pear;
yet Villarea is not more <HI>propi∣tious</HI>
to his wishes than Ventina. But
the solemn vow I so soon must make,
chills my blood with horror. Have
mercy on me, Heaven. Oh! How
my heart throbs! Adieu, dear Laura.
