<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROM. xiv. 7.</BIBL>
<Q>"For none of us liveth to himself."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE use of many of the precepts and maxims of scripture,
is not so much to prescribe actions, as to generate some
certain turn and habit of thinking: and they are then only ap∣plied
as they ought to be, when they furnish us with such a
view of, and such a way of considering, the subject to which
they relate, as may rectify and meliorate our dispositions;
for from dispositions, so rectified and meliorated, particular
good actions, and particular good rules of acting, flow of
their own accord. This is true of the great christian maxims
of loving our neighbour as ourselves; of doing to others, as
we would that others should do to us; and (as will appear,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
I hope, in the sequel of this discourse) of that of the text.
These maxims being well impressed, the detail of conduct
may be left to itself. The subtleties of casuistry, I had almost
said the science, may be spared. By presenting to the mind
one fixed consideration, such a temper is at length formed within
us, that our first impressions and first impulses are sure almost
of being on the side of virtue; and that we feel likewise an
almost irresistible inclination to be governed by them. When
this disposition is perfected, the influence of religion, as a
moral institution, is sufficiently established.</P>
<P>It is not in this way, but in another, that human laws, espe∣cially
the laws of free countries, proceed to attain their objects.
Forasmuch as <HI>their</HI> ultimate sanctions are to be dispensed by
fallible men, instead of an unerring and omniscient judge, the
safety, as well as the liberty, of the subject, requires, that dis∣cretion
should be bound down by precise rules both of acting,
and of judging of actions. Hence lawgivers have been obliged
to multiply directions and prohibitions without number: and
this necessity, for such I acknowledge it to be, hath drawn
them into a prolixity, which incumbers the law as a science
to those who study or administer it; and sometimes perplexes
it, as a rule of conduct, to those who have nothing to do with:
it, but to obey it. Yet still they find themselves unable
to make laws as fast as occasions demand them: they find them∣selves
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
perpetually called upon to pursue, by fresh paths, the
inventive versatility of human fraud, or to provide for new and
unforeseen varieties of situation. Now should religion, which
professes to guide the whole train and range of a man's con∣duct,
interior as well as external, domestic as well as civil;
and which, consequently, extends the operations of its rules
to many things which the laws leave indifferent and uncon∣trolled;
should religion, I say, once set about to imitate the
precision of human laws, the volume of its precepts would soon
be rendered useless by its bulk, and unintelligible by its intri∣cacy.
The religion of Mahomet, as might be expected from
the religion of a military prophet, constituted itself into the
law of the states into which it was received. Assuming the
functions of legislators and magistrates, in conjunction with
the character of interpreters of the Koran and depositaries of
the supplemental laws of the religion, the successors of the
Arabian have, under the name of traditionary rules, compiled
a code for the direction of their followers in almost every
part of their conduct. The <HI>seventy-five thousand</HI> precepts of that
code<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hamilton's translation of the Hedaya or Guide.</NOTE> serve only to shew the futility of the attempt; to
prove by experiment, that religion can only act upon human
life by general precepts, addressed and applied to the disposi∣tion;
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
that there is no ground for the objection, that has some∣times
been made to christianity, that it is defective, as a mo∣ral
institution, for the want of more explicit, more circumstan∣tial,
and more accurate directions; and that when we place by
the side of each other human and divine laws, without under∣standing
the distinction in the two methods by which they
seek to attain their purpose, and the reason of that distinction,
we form a comparison between them, which is likely to be
injurious to both. We may find fault with the scriptures, for
not giving us the precision of civil laws; and we may blame
the laws, for not being content with the conciseness and sim∣plicity
of scripture: and our censure in both cases be unfound∣ed
and undeserved.</P>
<P>The observation of the text is exactly of the nature I have
been alluding to. It supplies a principle. It furnishes us with
a view of our duty, and of the relations in which we are placed,
which, if attended to (and no instruction can be of use with∣out
that), will produce in our minds just determinations, and,
what are of more value, because more wanted, efficacious mo∣tives.</P>
<P>"None of us liveth to himself." We ought to regard our
lives (including under that name our faculties, our opportuni∣ties,
our advantages of every kind) not as mere instruments
of personal gratification, but as due to the service of God;
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
and as given us to be employed in promoting the purpose of
his will in the happiness of our fellow creatures. I am not able
to imagine a turn of thought which is better than this. It
encounters the antagonist, the check, the destroyer of all virtue,
selfishness. It is intelligible to all: to all in different degrees
applicable. It incessantly prompts to exertion, to activity, to
beneficence.</P>
<P>In order to recommend it, and in order to render it as use∣ful
as it is capable of being made, it may be proper to point
out, how the force and truth of the Apostle's assertion bears
upon the different classes of civil society. And in this view,
the description of men, which first, undoubtedly, offers itself
to our notice, is that of men of public characters; who possess
offices of importance, power, influence and authority. If the
rule and principle, which I am exhibiting to your observation,
can be said to be made for one class of mankind more than
another, it is for them. "<HI>They,</HI> certainly, live not to themselves."
The design, the tenure, the condition of their offices; the
public expectation, the public claim, consign their lives and
labours, their cares and thoughts and talents, to the public
happiness, whereinsoever it is connected with the duties of
their stations, or can be advanced by the fidelity of their ser∣vices.
There may be occasions and emergencies when men
are called upon to take part in the public service, out of the
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
line of their prosessions, or the ordinary limits of their voca∣tion.
But these emergencies occur, I think, seldom. The
necessity should be manifest, before we yield to it. A too
great readiness to start out of our separate precincts of duty,
in order to rush into provinces which belong to others, is a
dangerous excess of zeal. In general the public interest is best
upheld, the public quiet always best preserved, by each one
attending closely to the proper and distinct duties of his station.
In seasons of peril or consternation, this attention ought to be
doubled. Dangers are not best opposed by tumultuous or dis∣orderly
exertions; but by a sedate, firm, and calm resistance,
especially by that regular and silent strength, which is the
collected result of each man's vigilance and industry in his
separate station. For public men therefore to be active in
the stations assigned to them, is demanded by their country
in the hour of her fear or danger. If ever there was a time,
when they that rule "should rule with diligence;" when supine∣ness,
negligence, and remissness in office, when a timidity or
love of ease, which might in other circumstances be tolerated,
ought to be proscribed and excluded, it is the present. If ever
there was a time to make the public feel the benefit of public
institutions, it is this.</P>
<P>But I shall add nothing more concerning the obligation
which the text, and the lesson it conveys, imposes upon pub∣lic
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
men, because I think that the principle is too apt to be
considered as appertaining to them alone. It will therefore
be more useful to shew, how what are called private stations,
are affected by the same principle. I say what are called
private stations, for such they are, only as contradistinguished
from public trusts, publicly and formally confided. In them∣selves,
and accurately estimated, there are few such; I mean
that there are few so destined to the private emolument of
the possessor, as that they are innocently occupied by him,
when they are occupied with no other attention but to his
own enjoyment. Civil government is constituted for the
happiness of the governed, and not for the gratification of
those who administer it. Not only so, but the gradations of
rank in society are supported, not for the advantage or plea∣sure
of those who possess the highest places in it, but for the
common good; for the security, the repose, the protection,
the encouragement of all. They may be very satisfactorily
defended upon this principle: but then this principle casts
upon them duties. In particular it teaches every man who
possesses a fortune, to regard himself as in some measure occu∣pying
a public station; as obliged to make it a channel of
beneficence, an instrument of good to others, and not merely
a supply to himself of the materials of luxury, ostentation, or
avarice. There is a share of power and influence necessarily
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
attendant upon property; upon the right or the wrong use of
which, the exertion or the neglect, depends no little part of
the virtue or vice, the happiness or misery of the community.
It is in the choice of every man of rank and property, to be∣come
the benefactor or the scourge, the guardian or the ty∣rant,
the example or the corrupter of the virtue, of his ser∣vants,
his tenants, his neighbourhood; to be the author to
them, of peace or contention, of sobriety or dissoluteness, of
comfort or distress. This power, whencesoever it proceeds,
whether expressly conferred or silently acquired (for I see no
difference in the two cases), brings along with it obligation,
and responsibility. It is to be lamented when this considera∣tion
is not known, or not attended to. Two causes appear
to me to obstruct, to men of this description, the view of
their moral situation. One is, that they do not perceive any
<HI>call</HI> upon them at all; the other, that, if there be one, they do
not see to what they are called. To the first point I would
answer in the words of an excellent moralist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Abraham Tucker, Esq. author of <HI>The Light of Nature,</HI> and of <HI>The Light of Nature and Revelation pursued,</HI> by Edward Search, Esq.</NOTE>, "The delivery
of the talent is the call:" it is the call of Providence, the call
of Heaven. The supply of the means, is the requisition of
the duty. When we find, ourselves in possession of faculties
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
and opportunities, whether arising from the endowments and
qualities of our minds, or from the advantages of fortune and
station, we need ask for no further evidence of the intention
of the donor: we ought to see in that intention a demand
upon us for the use and application of what has been given.
This is a principle of natural as well as revealed religion;
and it is universal. Then as to the second enquiry, the spe∣cies
of benevolence, the kind of duty to which we are bound,
it is pointed out to us by the same indication. To whatever
office of benevolence our faculties are best fitted, our talents
turned; whatever our opportunities, our occasions, our for∣tune,
our profession, our rank or station, or whatever our lo∣cal
circumstances, which are capable of no enumeration, put
in our power to perform with the most advantage and effect,
that is the office for us: that it is, which, upon our principle,
we are designed, and, being designed, are obliged to discharge.
I think that the judgement of mankind does not often fail them
in the choice of the objects or species of their benevolence:
but what fails them is the sense of the obligation, the consci∣ousness
of the connection between duty and power, and,
springing from this consciousness, a disposition to seek oppor∣tunities,
or to embrace those that occur, of rendering them∣selves
useful to their generation.</P>
<P>Another cause, which keeps out of the sight of those who
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
are concerned in them, the duties that belong to superior
stations, is a language, from their infancy familiar to them,
viz. that they are placed above work. I have always consi∣dered
this as a most unfortunate phraseology. And, as habi∣tual
modes of speech have no small effect upon public senti∣ment,
it has a direct tendency to make one portion of man∣kind
envious, and the other idle. The truth is, every man
has his work. The kind of work varies, and that is all the
difference there is. A great deal of labour exists beside that
of the hands; many species of industry beside bodily opera∣tion,
equally necessary, requiring equal assiduity, more atten∣tion,
more anxiety. It is not true therefore that men of ele∣vated
stations are exempted from work; it is only true that
there is assigned to them work of a different kind: whether
more easy, or more pleasant, may be questioned; but certain∣ly
not less wanted, not less essential to the common good.
Were this maxim once properly received as a principle of con∣duct,
it would put men of fortune and rank upon enquiring,
what were the opportunities of doing good (for some, they may
depend upon it, there are) which, in a more especial manner,
belonged to their situation or condition: and were this princi∣ple
carried into any thing like its full effect, or even were this
way of thinking sufficiently inculcated, it would completely
remove the invidiousness of elevated stations. Mankind would
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
see in them this alternative. If such men discharged the duties
which were attached to the advantages they enjoyed, they de∣served
these advantages. If they did not, they were morally
speaking in the situation of a poor man who neglected his bu∣siness
and his calling; and in no better. And the proper re∣flection
in both cases is the same: the individual is in a high
degree culpable, yet the business and the calling beneficial and
expedient.</P>
<P>The habit and the disposition which we wish to re∣commend,
namely that of casting about for opportunities of
doing good, readily seizing those which accidentally present
themselves, and faithfully using those which naturally and re∣gularly
belong to our situations, appear to be sometimes check∣ed
by a notion, very natural to active spirits, and to flattered
talents. They will not be content to do little things. They
will either attempt mighty matters, or do nothing. The small
effects, which the private endeavours of an individual can pro∣duce
upon the mass of social good, is so lost, and so unper∣ceived,
in the comparison, that it neither deserves, they think,
nor rewards the attention which it requires. The answer is,
that the comparison, which thus discourages them, ought ne∣ver
to be made. The good which their efforts can produce,
may be too minute to bear any sensible proportion to the sum
of public happiness, yet may be their share; may be enough
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
for them. The proper question is not, whether the good we
aim at be great or little; still less, whether it be great or little
in comparison with the whole; but whether it be the most
which it is in our power to perform. A single action may be, as
it were, nothing to the aggregate of moral good; so also may be
the agent. It may still therefore be the proportion, which is
required of <HI>him.</HI> In all things nature works by numbers. Her
greatest effects are achieved by the joint operation of multi∣tudes
of, separately considered, insignificant individuals. It
is enough for each that it executes its office. It is not its con∣cern,
because it does not depend upon its will, what place that
office holds in, or what proportion it bears to, the general result.
Let our only comparison therefore be, between our opportuni∣ties
and the use which we make of them. When we would
extend our views, or stretch out our hand, to distant and ge∣neral
good, we are commonly lost and sunk in the magnitude
of the subject. Particular good, and the particular good which
lies within our reach, is all we are concerned to attempt, or to
enquire about. Not the smallest effort will be forgotten; not a
particle of our virtue will fall to the ground. Whether successful
or not, our endeavours will be recorded; will be estimated, not
according to the proportion which they bear to the universal
interest, but according to the relation which they hold to our
means and opportunities; according to the disinterestedness,
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
the sincerity, with which we undertook; the pains and perseve∣rance
with which we carried them on. It may be true, and I
think it is the doctrine of scripture, that the right use of great
faculties or great opportunities, will be more highly rewarded,
than the right use of inferior faculties and less opportunities.
He that, with ten talents, had made ten talents more, was placed
over ten cities. The neglected talent was also given to him.
He who, with five talents, had made five more, though pro∣nounced
to be a good and faithful servant, was placed only over
five cities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 25 et seq.</NOTE>. This distinction might, without any great harsh∣ness
to our moral feelings, be resolved into the will of the su∣preme
benefactor: but we can see perhaps enough of the sub∣ject
to perceive that it was just. The merit may reasonably be
supposed to have been more in one case, than the other. The
danger, the activity, the care, the solicitude, were greater.
Still both received rewards, abundant beyond measure when
compared with the services, equitable and proportioned when
compared with one another.</P>
<P>That our obligation is commensurate with our opportunity,
and that the possession of the opportunity is sufficient, without
any further or more formal command, to create the obligation,
is a principle of morality and of scripture; and is alike true in
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
all countries. But that power and property so far go together,
as to constitute private fortunes into public stations, as to
cast upon large portions of the community occasions which render
the preceding principles more constantly applicable, is the effect
of civil institutions, and is found in no country more than in
ours; if in any so much. With us a great part of the public
business of the country, is transacted by the country itself:
and upon the prudent and faithful management of it, depends,
in a very considerable degree, the interior prosperity of the
nation, and the satisfaction of great bodies of the people. Not
only offices of magistracy, which affect and pervade every dis∣trict,
are delegated to the principal inhabitants of the neigh∣bourhood,
but there is erected in every county a high and
venerable tribunal, to which owners of permanent property,
down almost to their lowest classes, are indiscriminately called;
and called to take part, not in the forms and ceremonies of
the meeting, but in the most efficient and important of its func∣tions.
The wisdom of man hath not devised a happier insti∣tution
than that of juries, or one founded in a juster knowledge
of human life, or of the human capacity. In jurisprudence,
as in every science, the points ultimately rest upon common
sense. But to reduce a question to these points, and to pro∣pose
them accurately, requires not only an understanding su∣perior
to that which is necessary to decide upon them when
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
proposed, but oftentimes also a technical and peculiar crudi∣tion.
Agreeably to this distinction, which runs perhaps through
all sciences, what is preliminary and preparatory, is left to the
legal profession; what is final, to the plain understanding of
plain men. But since it is necessary that the judgement of
such men should be informed; and since it is of the utmost
importance that advice, which falls with so much weight, should
be drawn from the purest sources; judges are sent down to us,
who have spent their lives in the study and administration of
the laws of their country, and who come amongst us, strangers
to our contentions, if we have any, our parties and our preju∣dices;
strangers to every thing, except the evidence which they
hear. The effect corresponds with the wisdom of the design.
Juries may err, and frequently do so; but there is no system of
error incorporated with their constitution. Corruption, terror,
influence, are excluded by it; and prejudice, in a great degree,
though not entirely. This danger, which consists in juries view∣ing
one class of men, or one class of rights, in a more or less
favorable light than another, is the only one to be feared, and
to be guarded against. It is a disposition, which, whenever it
rises up in the minds of jurors, ought to be repressed, by their
probity, their consciences, the sense of their duty, the remem∣brance
of their oaths.</P>
<P>And this institution is not more salutary, than it is grateful
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
and honorable to those popular feelings of which all good go∣vernments
are tender. Hear the language of the law. In the
most momentous interests, in the last peril indeed of human
life, the accused appeals to God and his country, "which country
you are." What pomp of titles, what display of honors, can
equal the real dignity, which these few words confer upon
those to whom they are addressed? They shew, by terms the
most solemn and significant, how highly the law deems of
the functions and character of a jury: they shew also, with
what care of the safety of the subject it is, that the same law
has provided for every one a recourse to the fair and indiffe∣rent
arbitration of his neighbours. This is substantial equa∣lity;
real freedom: equality of protection; freedom from in∣justice.
May it never be invaded; never abused! May it be
perpetual! And it will be so, if the affection of the country
continue to be preserved to it, by the integrity of those who
are charged with its office.</P>
