<LG>
<L>I Wonder not our Author doubts Success,</L>
<L>One in his Circumstance can do no less.</L>
<L>The Dancer on the Rope that tries at all,</L>
<L>In each unpractis'd Caper risques a Fall:</L>
<L>I own I dread his ticklish Situation,</L>
<L>Critics detest Poetic Innovation.</L>
<L>Had <HI>Ic'rus</HI> been content with solid Ground,</L>
<L>The giddy vent'rous Youth had ne'er been drown'd.</L>
<L>The <HI>Pegasus</HI> of old had Fire and Force,</L>
<L>But your true Modern is a Carrier's Horse,</L>
<L>Drawn by the foremost Bell, afraid to stray,</L>
<L>Bard following Bard jogs on the beaten Way.</L>
<L>Why is this Man so obstinate an Elf?</L>
<L>Wall he, alone, not imitate himself?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Scene now shews the Heroes of old <HI>Greece</HI>;</L>
<L>But how? 'tis monstrous! In a Comic Piece.</L>
<L>To Buskins, Plumes and Helmets what Pretence,</L>
<L>If mighty Chiefs must speak but common Sense?</L>
<L>Shall no bold Diction, no Poetic Rage,</L>
<L>Fome at our Mouths and thunder on the Stage?</L>
<L>No 'tis <HI>Achilles,</HI> as he came from <HI>Chiron,</HI></L>
<L>Just taught to sing as well as wield cold Iron;</L>
<L>And whatsoever Criticks may suppose,</L>
<L>Our Author holds, that what He spoke was Prose.</L>

<P>You are so very obstinate, that really, Child, there's
no enduring you.—Your Impatience seems to forget that I
am a Goddess: Have I not degraded my self into the Charac∣ter
of a distress'd <HI>Grecian</HI> Princess? 'Tis owing to my Artifice
and Insinuation that we have the Protection of the King of
<HI>Scyros.</HI> Have I not won <HI>Lycomedes</HI> his Friendship and Hospi∣tality
to that degree as to place you, without the least Suspi∣cion,
among his Daughters?—And for what, dear <HI>Achilles</HI>?

Suspicion.—You have so much Youth, and such a Bloom,
that there is no Man alive but must take you for a Woman.

<P>The Princesses, Lady <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> have been sitting at their
Embroidery above a Quarter of an Hour, and are perfectly mi∣serable
for want of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thet.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pyrrha</HI> is so very unhandy, and so monstrously auk∣ward
at her Needle, that I know she must be diverting. Her
Passion for Romances (as you must have observ'd in other
Girls) took her off from every Part of useful Education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ach.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the many Obligations I have to the Princesses, I
should (no doubt) upon all Occasions shew my self ready to be
the But of their Ridicule.—'Tis a Duty that all great People
expect from (what they call) their Dependants.</P>

Pleasure in instructing you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thet.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's sake, <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> let not your captious Tem∣per
run away with your Good-manners. You cannot but be
sensible of the King's and their Civilities, both to you and me.
—How can you be so horridly out of Humour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ach.</SPEAKER>
<P>All I mean, Madam, is; that when People are sensi∣ble
of their own Defects, they are not the proper Objects of
Ridicule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are so very touchy, <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> that there is no en∣during
you.—How can you be so unsociable a Creature as to
deny a Friend the Liberty of laughing at your little Follies and
Indiscretions? For what do you think Women keep Com∣pany
with one another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they hate one another, despise one another, and
seek to have the Pleasure of seeing and exposing one another's
Faults and Follies.</P>

<P>Now, dear <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> tell me, is Work a thing you
pique yourself upon? Suppose too they shou'd smile at an Ab∣surdity
in your Dress, it cou'd not be such a Mortification as if
(like most Women) you had made it the chief Business of your
