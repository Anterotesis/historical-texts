<L>AWAKE, Aeolian lyre, awake,</L>
<L>And give to rapture all thy trembling strings.</L>
<L>From Helicon's harmonious springs</L>
<L>A thousand rills their mazy progress take:</L>
<L>The laughing flowers, that round them blow,</L>
<L>Drink life and fragrance as they flow.</L>
<L>Now the rich stream of musick winds along</L>
<L>Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong,</L>
<L>Thro' verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign:</L>
<L>Now rowling down the steep amain,</L>

<L>On Thracia's hills the Lord of War,</L>
<L>Has curb'd the fury of his car,</L>

<L>Perching on the scept'red hand</L>
<L>Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king</L>

With arms sublime, that float upon the air,</L>

<L>Man's feeble race what Ills await,</L>
