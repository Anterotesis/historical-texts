<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SOME Verses, it may be observ'd,
in the following Collection, were
wrote upon the Scheme of the Mystick
Divines. And these, 'tis own'd, we haa
once in great Veneration, as the best
Explainers of the Gospel of CHRIST.
But we are now convinced that we
therein <HI>greatly err'd: not knowing the
Scriptures, neither the Power of</HI> GOD.
And because this is an Error which many
serious Minds are sooner or later exposed
to, and which indeed most easily besets
those, who seek the LORD JESUS
in Sincerity; we believe ourselves indis∣pensably
obliged, in the Presence of GOD
and Angels, and Men, to declare wherein
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
we apprehend those Writers, Not to
teach <HI>the Truth as it is in JESUS.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And first, we apprehend them to lay
Another Foundation. They are carefull
indeed to pull down our own Works, and
to prove, that <HI>by the DEEDS of the Law
shall no flesh be justified.</HI> But why
is this? Only, <HI>to establish our own
Righteousness</HI> in the place of our own
Works. They speak largely and well, a∣gainst
expecting to be accepted of GOD
for our Virtuous Actions: And then
teach, That we are to be accepted, For
our Virtuous Habits or Tempers. Still
the Ground of our Acceptance is placed
<HI>in ourselves.</HI> The Difference is only this:
Common Writers suppose we are to be
justified, for the Sake of our Outward
Righteousness. These suppose we are to
be justified, for the Sake of our Inward
Righteousness: Whereas in truth, we
are no more justified, for the sake of
one than of the other. For neither
our own Inward nor Outward Righteous∣ness,
is the Ground of our Justification.
Holiness of Heart, as well as Holiness of
Life, is not the Cause, but the Effect of
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
it. The Sole Cause of our Acceptance with
GOD (or, That for the Sake of which
on the Account of which we are accepted)
is the Righteousness and the Death of
CHRIST, who fulfilled GOD's Law,
and died in our Stead. And even the
Condition of it, is not (as they suppose)
our Holiness either of Heart of Life: But
our Faith Alone; Faith contradistinguish'd
from Holiness as well as from Good Works.
Other Foundation therefore can no Man lay,
without being an Adversary to CHRIST
and his Gospel, than Faith Alone, Faith,
though necessarily producing both, yet not
including either Good Works, or Holi∣ness.</P>
<P N="3">3. But supposing them to have laid the
Foundation right, the Manner of building
thereon which they advise, is quite oppo∣site
to that prescribed by CHRIST. He
commands to <HI>build up one another.</HI> They
advise, "To the Desert, to the Desert,
and GOD will build you up." Num∣berless
are the Commendations that occur
in all their Writings, not of Retirement
intermix'd with Conversation, but of an
intire Seclusion from Men, (perhaps for
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Months or Years) in order to purify the
Soul. Whereas, according to the Judg∣ment
of our Lord, and the Writings of
his Apostles, it is only when we are <HI>knit
together,</HI> that we <HI>have Nourishment
from Him, and increase with the In∣crease
of GOD.</HI> Neither is there any
time, when the weakest Member can say
to the strongest, or the strongest to the
weakest, "<HI>I have no need of Thee.</HI>"
Accordingly our Blessed Lord, when his
Disciples were in their weakest State,
sent them forth, not alone, but <HI>Two by
Two.</HI> When they were strengthen'd a
little, not by Solitude, but by abiding with
him and one another, he commanded them
to <HI>wait,</HI> not separate but <HI>being assem∣bled
together, for the Promise of the
Father.</HI> And <HI>they were all with one
Accord in one Place,</HI> when they re∣ceived
the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Ex∣press
mention is made in the same Chapter,
that when <HI>there were added unto them
Three Thousand Souls, all that believed
were together, and continued stedfastly</HI>
not only <HI>in the Apostles Doctrine</HI> but also
<HI>in fellowship and in breaking of Bread</HI>
and in praying <HI>with one Accord.</HI> A∣greeable
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
to which is the Account the
Great Apostle gives, of the Manner which
he had been taught of GOD, <HI>for the
perfecting of the Saints, for the edi∣fying
of the Body of CHRIST,</HI> even
to the end of the World. And according
to St. <HI>Paul, all</HI> who will ever <HI>come, in
the Unity of the Faith, unto a per∣fect
Man, unto the Measure of the
Stature of the Fulness of CHRIST,</HI>
must together <HI>grow up into him. From
whom the whole Body fitly join'd to∣gether
and compacted</HI> (or strengthen'd)
<HI>by that which every joint supplieth,
according to the effectual Working in
the Measure of every part, maketh
Increase of the Body, unto the Edi∣fying
of itself in Love.</HI> Ephesians iv.
15, 16.</P>
<P N="4">4. So widely distant is the Manner of
Building up Souls in CHRIST taught
by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> from that taught by the
Mysticks! Nor do they differ as to the
Foundation, or the Manner of Building
thereon, more than they do with Regard
to the Superstructure. For the Religion
these Authors wou'd edify us in, is Soli∣tary
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Religion. If Thou wilt be Per∣fect,
say they, "trouble not thyself a∣bout
Outward Works. It is better to
work Virtues in the Will. He hath
attain'd the True Resignation, who
hath estranged himself from all Out∣ward
Works, that GOD may work
inwardly in him, without any turning
to Outward Things. These are the
true Worshippers, who worship GOD,
in Spirit and in Truth." For Con∣templation
is with them, the fulfilling
of the Law, even a Contemplation that
"consists in a Cessation of all Works."</P>
<P N="5">5. Directly opposite to this is the Gospel
of CHRIST. Solitary Religion is not
to be found there. "Holy Solitaries" is
a Phrase no more consistent with the Go∣spel
than Holy Adulterers. The Gospel
of CHRIST knows of no Religion, but
Social; no Holiness but Social Holiness.
<HI>Faith working by Love,</HI> is the length
and breadth and depth and height of
Christian Perfection. <HI>This Command∣ment
have we from CHRIST, that
he who love GOD, love his Brother
also</HI>: And that we manifest our Love,
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
<HI>by doing good unto all Men; espe∣cially
to them that are of the House∣hold
of Faith.</HI> And in truth, who∣soever
loveth his Brethren not in Word
only, but as CHRIST loved him, can∣not
but be <HI>zealous of Good Works.</HI>
He feels in his Soul a burning, restless
Desire, of spending and being spent for
them. <HI>My Father,</HI> will he say, <HI>work∣eth
hitherto and I work,</HI> And at all
possible Opportunities, he is, like his Ma∣ster,
<HI>going about doing good.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>This then is the Way: Walk Ye in
it, whosoever Ye are that have believed in
his Name. Ye know,</HI> Other Foundation
can no Man lay, than that which is laid,
even JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Ye feel that</HI> by
Grace Ye are <HI>saved thro' Faith; saved
from Sin, by CHRIST form'd</HI> in your
Hearts, <HI>and from Fear, by</HI> his Spirit
bearing Witness with your Spirit, that
Ye are the Sons of GOD. <HI>Ye are taught
of GOD,</HI> not to forsake the assembling
of yourselves together, as the Manner
of some is; <HI>but to instruct, admonish,
exhort, reprove, comfort, confirm and
every Way</HI> build up one another. Ye
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
have an Unction from the Holy One,
<HI>that teacheth you to renounce any other or
higher Perfection, than</HI> Faith working
by Love, <HI>Faith</HI> zealous of Good Works,
<HI>Faith</HI> as it hath opportunity doing good
unto all Men. As Ye have therefore
received JESUS CHRIST the LORD, so
Walk ye in Him: Rooted and built
up in Him, and stablish'd in the Faith
and abounding therein <HI>more and more.
Only,</HI> beware lest any Man spoil you
thro' Philosophy and vain deceit, after
the tradition of Men, after the rudiments
of the World, and not after CHRIST.
<HI>For</HI> Ye are complete in Him. He is
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
the ending, the first and the last. <HI>Only</HI>
continue in <HI>Him,</HI> grounded and settled
and be not moved away from the Hope
of the Gospel: And when CHRIST,
who is our Life, shall appear, then
shall Ye also appear with him in Glory!</P>

<L>What art Thou, Love? Thou strange myste∣rious
