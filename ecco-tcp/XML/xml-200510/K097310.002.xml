<HEAD>GENERAL HISTORY
OF
ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Analogies between Animals and Vegetables.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the numberless objects with which
the surface of this globe is covered and
peopled, animals deservedly hold the first rank,
both on account of the relation they stand in to
man, and of their acknowledged superiority over
vegetable and inanimated matter. The senses,
the figure, and the motions of animals, bestow
on them a more extensive connection with sur∣rounding
objects than is possessed by vegetables.
The latter, however, from their expansion, their
growth, and the variety of parts which compose
them, are more intimately related to external
objects than minerals or stones, which are per∣fectly
inert, and deprived of every vital or active
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
principle. It is this number of relations alone
which renders the animal superior to the vege∣table,
and the vegetable to the mineral. Man,
if we estimate him by his material part alone, is
superior to the brute creation only from the
number of peculiar relations he enjoys by means
of his hand and of his tongue; and, though all
the operations of the Omnipotent are in them∣selves
equally perfect, the animated being, ac∣cording
to our mode of perception, is the most
compleat; and man is the most finished and
perfect animal.</P>
<P>What a variety of springs, of powers, and of
mechanical movements, are included in that
small portion of matter of which the body of an
animal is composed! What a number of rela∣tions,
what harmony, what correspondence a∣mong
the different parts! How many combina∣tions,
arrangements, causes, effects, and prin∣ciples,
all conspiring to accomplish the same de∣sign!
Of these, we know nothing but by their
results, which are so difficult to comprehend, that
they only cease to be miraculous from our habits
of inattention and our want of reflection.</P>
<P>But, however admirable this work may ap∣pear,
the greatest miracle is not exhibited in the
individual. It is in the successive renovation,
and in the continued duration of the species,
that Nature assumes an aspect altogether incon∣ceivable
and astonishing. This faculty of repro∣duction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word is frequently used by the author, and requires to be explained. It signifies the power of producing or propa∣gating in general, and is equally applicable to plants and to animals. Generation is a species of reproduction peculiar to animated beings.</NOTE>,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
which is peculiar to animals and ve∣getables;
this species of unity which always
subsists, and seems to be eternal; this generative
power which is perpetually in action, must, with
regard to us, continue to be a mystery so pro∣found,
that we shall probably never reach the
bottom of it.</P>
<P>Even inanimated bodies, the stones or the
dust under our feet, have some properties; their
very existence presupposes a great number; and
matter, the most imperfectly organized, possesses
many relations with the other parts of the uni∣verse.
We will not assert, with some philo∣sophers,
that matter, under whatever form it
appears, is conscious of its existence and of its
relative powers. This question belongs to me∣taphysics,
of which we intend not here to treat.
We shall only remark, that, being ignorant of
the extent of our own connections with exter∣nal
objects, we cannot hesitate in pronouncing
inanimated matter to be infinitely more ig∣norant.
Besides, our sensations having not the
most distant resemblance to the causes which
produce them, analogy obliges us to conclude,
that dead matter is neither endowed with senti∣ment,
with sensation, nor with a consciousness
of its own existence. To attribute any of these
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
faculties to it, therefore, would be ascribing to it
the power of thinking, of acting, and of per∣ceiving
nearly in the same manner as we our∣selves
think, act, and perceive; which is equally
repugnant to reason and to religion.</P>
<P>With inanimated matter, therefore, though
formed of dust and clay, we have no other
relations than what arise from the general pro∣perties
of bodies, namely, extension, impene∣trability,
gravity, &amp;c. But, as relations purely
material make no internal impression on us, and,
as they exist entirely independent of us, they
cannot be considered as any part of our being.
Our existence, therefore, is an effect of organi∣zation,
of life, of the soul. Matter, in this view,
is not a principal, but an accessory. It is a fo∣reign
covering, united to us in a manner un∣known;
and its presence is noxious. Thought
is the constituent principle of our being, and is
perhaps totally independent of matter.</P>
<P>We exist, then, without knowing how; and
we think, without perceiving the reason of
thought. But, whatever be the mode of our
being, or of our thinking, whether our sensa∣tions
be real or apparent, their effects are not the
less certain. The train of our ideas, though dif∣ferent
from the objects which occasion them,
gives rise to genuine affections, and produces in us
relations to external objects, which we may re∣gard
as real, because they are uniform and in∣variable.
Thus, agreeable to the nature of our
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
being, it is impossible to doubt concerning the
reality of those distinctions and resemblances
which we perceive in the bodies that surround
us. We may, therefore, conclude, without he∣sitation,
that man holds the first rank in the or∣der
of nature; and that brute animals hold the
second, vegetables the third, and minerals the
last. Though we are unable clearly to distin∣guish
between our animal and spiritual qualities;
though the brute creation are endowed with the
same senses, the same principles of life and mo∣tion,
and perform many actions in a manner si∣milar
to those of man; yet they have not the
same extent of relation to external objects; and,
consequently, their resemblance to us fails in
numberless particulars. We differ still more
from vegetables; but we are more analogous to
them than to minerals; for vegetables possess a
species of animated organization; but minerals
have nothing that approaches to regular organs.</P>
<P>Before we give the history of an animal, it is
necessary to have an exact knowledge of the ge∣neral
order of his peculiar relations, and then to
distinguish those relations which he has in com∣mon
with vegetables and with minerals. An
animal possesses nothing common to the mineral,
but the general properties of matter: His na∣ture
and oeconomy, however, are perfectly dif∣ferent.
The mineral is inactive, insensible, sub∣ject
to every impulse, without organization, or
the power of reproduction, a rude mass, fitted
only to be trode by the feet of men and of ani∣mals.
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
Even the most precious metals, which
derive their value only from the conventions of
men, are regarded in no other light by the phi∣losopher.
In the animal, the whole powers of
nature are united. The principles with which
he is animated are peculiar to him: He wills;
he determines; he acts; he communicates, by
his senses, with the most distant objects; his
body is a world in miniature, a central point to
which every thing in the universe is connected.
These are his peculiar and invariable relations:
The faculties of growth and developement, of
reproduction and the multiplication of his spe∣cies,
he possesses in common with the vegetable
kingdom.</P>
<P>Progressive motion appears to be the most
distinguishing quality between an animal and a
vegetable. We, indeed, know no vegetable
that enjoys a progressive motion. But this mo∣tion
is denied to several species of animals, as
oysters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not strictly true; for oysters, and even gall-insects, are capable of a degree of progressive motion.</NOTE>, gall-insects, &amp;c. This distinction, there∣fore,
is neither general nor essential.</P>
<P>Sensation more essentially distinguishes ani∣mals
from vegetables. But <HI>sensation</HI> is a com∣plex
idea, and requires some explication; for,
if sensation implied no more than motion conse∣quent
upon a stroke or an impulse, the sensitive
plant enjoys this power. But, if by sensation
we mean the faculty of perceiving and of com∣paring
ideas, it is uncertain whether brute ani∣mals
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
are endowed with it. If it should be al∣lowed
to dogs, elephants, &amp;c. whose actions
seem to proceed from motives similar to those
by which men are actuated, it must be denied
to many species of animals, particularly to those
that appear not to possess the faculty of progres∣sive
motion. If the sensation of an oyster, for
example, differed only in degree from that of a
dog, why do we not ascribe the same sensation
to vegetables, though in a degree still inferior?
This distinction, therefore, between the animal
and vegetable, is neither sufficiently general nor
determined.</P>
<P>A third distinction has been derived from the
manner of feeding. Animals have organs of
apprehension by which they lay hold of their
food; they search for pasture, and have a choice
in their aliment. But plants are under the ne∣cessity
of receiving such nourishment as the soil
affords them, without exerting any choice in the
species of their food, or in the manner of ac∣quiring
it: The moisture of the earth is the on∣ly
source of their nourishment. However, if
we attend to the organization and action of the
roots and leaves, we shall soon be convinced,
that these are the external organs by which ve∣getables
are enabled to extract their food; that
the roots turn aside from a vein of bad earth, or
from any obstacle which they meet with, in
search of a better soil; and that they split and
separate their sibres in different directions, and
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
even change their form, in order to procure
nourishment to the plant. A general distinction,
therefore, between the animal and vegetable,
cannot be founded on their manner of feeding.</P>
<P>From this investigation we are led to conclude,
that there is no absolute and essential distinction
between the animal and vegetable kingdoms;
but that nature proceeds by imperceptible degrees
from the most perfect to the most imperfect ani∣mal,
and from that to the vegetable: Hence the
fresh water polypus may be regarded as the last
of animals, and the first of plants.</P>
<P>After examining the distinctions, we shall now
inquire into the resemblances which take place
betwee animals and vegetables. The power of
reproduction is common to the two kingdoms,
and is a resemblance both universal and essential.
This mutual faculty would induce us to think
that animals and vegetables are beings of the same
order.</P>
<P>A second resemblance may be derived from
the expansion of their parts, which is likewise a
common property; for vegetables grow as well
as animals; and, though some difference in the
manner of expansion may be remarked, it is nei∣ther
general nor essential; since the growth of
some considerable parts of animals, as the bones,
the hairs, the nails, the horns, &amp;c. is the effect
of a genuine vegetation; and the foetus, in its
first formation, may be rather said to vegetate
than to live.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
A third resemblance arises from the following
fact: Some animals are propagated in the same
manner, and by the same means, as vegetables.
The multiplication of the vine-fretter, (<HI>puceron</HI>),
which is effected without copulation, is similar to
that of plants by seed; and the multiplication of
the polypus by cutting resembles that of plants
by slips.</P>
<P>We may now conclude, therefore, with more
certainty, that animals and vegetables are beings
of the same order, and that Nature passes from
the one to the other by imperceptible degrees;
since the properties in which they resemble each
other are universal and essential, while those by
which they are distinguished are limited and par∣ticular.</P>
<P>Let us next proceed to compare animals and
vegetables in different points of view; for ex∣ample,
with regard to number, situation, mag∣nitude,
figure, &amp;c. from which new inductions
will arise.</P>
<P>Animals exceed plants in the number of spe∣cies.
In the class of insects alone, there are,
perhaps, a greater number of species, than of the
whole species of plants on the face of the earth.
Animals differ from each other much more than
plants: It is the great similarity of plants that
has given rise to the difficulty of distinguishing
and arranging them, and to the variety of bo∣tanical
systems, which are much more numerous
than those of zoology.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
Beside being more strongly characterised, e∣very
species of animal is distinguishable from
another by copulation. Those may be regarded
as of the same species which, by copulation, u∣niformly
produce and perpetuate beings every
way similar to their parents; and those which,
by the same means, either produce nothing, or
dissimilar beings, may be considered as of diffe∣rent
species. A fox, for example, will be of a
different species from a dog, if nothing results
from the intercourse of a male and a female of
these two animals; or, if the result be a dissimilar
creature, a kind of mule, as this mule cannot
multiply, it will be a sufficient demonstration
that the fox and dog are different species of ani∣mals.
In plants we have not the same advan∣tage;
for, though sexes have been attributed to
them, and generic distinctions have been found∣ed
on the parts of fructification; yet, as these
characteristics are neither so certain nor so ap∣parent
as in animals; and, as the reproduction
of plants can be accomplished by several methods
which have no dependence on sexes, or the parts
of fructification, this opinion has not been suc∣cessful;
and it is only by the misapplication of
an analogy, that the sexual system has been
pretended to be sufficient to enable us to distin∣guish
the different species of the vegetable king∣dom.</P>
<P>Though the species of animals be more nume∣rous
than those of plants, the number of indi∣viduals
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
in each species of the latter far exceed
those of the former. In animals, as well as in
plants, the number of individuals is much great∣er
in the small than in the large kinds. Flies
are infinitely more numerous than elephants;
and there are more herbs than trees. But, if we
compare the quantity of individuals in each spe∣cies,
the number of the plant far exceeds that of
the animal. Quadrupeds, for example, produce
but few at a time, and at considerable intervals.
Trees, on the contrary, produce annually an a∣mazing
quantity of seeds. It may be alledged,
that, to render this comparison exact, the quan∣tity
of seeds produced by a tree should be com∣pared
with the quantity of germs contained in
the semen of an animal; and then, perhaps, it
would appear, that animals abound more in
germs than vegetables. But, by collecting and
sowing the seeds of a single elm tree, 100,000
young elms may be raised from the product of
one year. Though a horse, however, were fur∣nished
with all the mares he could cover in a
year, the result between the production of the
animal and of the plant would be very different.
I avoid taking notice of the quantity of germs;
because of these, especially in the animal, we
have no certain knowledge, and because the same
seminal germs may exist in the vegetable; for
the seed of a plant is not a germ, but a produc∣tion
as perfect as the foetus of an animal, and
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
which, like a foetus, requires only the expansion
of its parts.</P>
<P>To this may be opposed the prodigious mul∣tiplication
of some kinds of insects, as the bee,
a single female of which will produce 30 or 40
thousand. But, it ought to be remarked, that
I am here speaking in general of animals com∣pared
with vegetables. Besides, the bee, which
affords, perhaps, an example of the greatest
multiplication among animals, proves nothing a∣gainst
the present doctrine; for, out of 30 or
40 thousand flies produced by the mother-bee,
there are but very few females, 1500 or 2000
males; and all the rest are of neither sex, and to∣tally
incapable of procreating.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged, that some species of
insects, fishes, and shell-animals, appear to be
extremely prolific. Oysters, herrings, fleas, &amp;c.
are perhaps equally fertile as mosses, and the
most common plants. But, in general, most
species of animals are less prolific than plants;
and, upon comparing the multiplication of the
different species of plants, we find not such re∣markable
differences, with regard to number, as
take place among animals. Some animals pro∣duce
great numbers, and others very few. But,
in every species of plants, the quantity produced
is always great.</P>
<P>From what we have already observed, it ap∣pears,
that, both in the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, the smallest and most contemptible
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
species are the most prolific. In proportion as
animals seem to be more perfect, the number of
individuals decreases. Does the production of
particular forms of body, necessary for the per∣fecting
of sentiment, as those of quadrupeds, and
of birds, cost nature more expence of organic
particles than the production of inferior crea∣tures?</P>
<P>Let us now compare animals and vegetables
with regard to situation, size, and figure. Ve∣getables
can exist no where but on the earth.
Most of them are attached to the soil by roots:
Some, as truffles, are entirely covered with the
soil; and a few grow under water. But the
whole require a connection with the surface of
the earth. Animals, on the contrary, are more
generally diffused. Some inhabit the surface, and
others the interior parts of the earth. Some ne∣ver
rise above the bottom of the ocean, and o∣thers
swim in the waters. The air, the internal
parts of plants, the bodies of men and of other
animals, and even stones themselves, are stored
with inhabitants.</P>
<P>By the assistance of the microscope, many new
species of animals have been discovered. But,
what is singular, we are not indebted to this in∣strument
for above one or two species of plants.
The small moss, of which mouldiness consists,
is perhaps the only microscopic plant which has
been described. From this it would appear, that
Nature has refused existence to very small plants,
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
while she has created animalcules in the greatest
profusion. But this opinion should not be a∣dopted
without examination. Plants are so si∣milar
in their structure, that it is much more
difficult to distinguish them than animals. This
mouldiness, which we imagine to be only a very
small moss, may be a forest or a garden consist∣ing
of a multitude of different plants, though
we are unable to distinguish them.</P>
<P>Animals and vegetables differ also with regard
to size. There is a greater disproportion between
the bulk of a whale and that of one of these pre∣tended
microscopic animals, than between the
largest oak and the small moss mentioned above.
Though bulk be only a relative attribute, it may
be useful to know the limits within which na∣ture
has confined her productions. As to large∣ness,
plants differ but little from animals. The
quantity of matter in a whale and in a large tree
is nearly equal; but, as to smallness, some men
have pretended to have seen animals so extreme∣ly
minute, that a million of them collected in a
heap, would not equal the small moss on a piece
of mouldy bread.</P>
<P>The most general and most obvious distinc∣tion
between plants and animals arises from their
figure. The form of animals, though infinitely
various, has no resemblance to that of plants:
And, though the polypi, which, like plants, can
be multiplied by cuttings, may be regarded as
the link which connects the animal and vege∣table
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
kingdoms, not only from the manner of
their reproduction, but still more from their fi∣gure;
yet there is no danger of mistaking the
one for the other. The operations of some ani∣mals
resemble plants or flowers. But plants ne∣ver
produce any thing similar to an animal; and
those wonderful insects which make corals,
would never have been mistaken for flowers, if,
by a foolish prejudice, coral had not been re∣garded
as a plant. Thus the errors we may
commit in comparing plants and animals, are
confined to a few objects which lie on the ex∣tremities
of the two kingdoms; and the farther
we extend our observations, we shall be the more
convinced, that the Creator has instituted no
fixed limits between the animal and vegetable;
that these two species of organized beings pos∣sess
a greater number of common properties
than of real differences; that the production of
an animal requires, perhaps, a smaller exertion
of Nature than the production of a vegetable; or
rather, that the production of organized bodies
requires no immediate exertion at all; and,
lastly, that animation, or the principle of life,
instead of a metaphysical step in the scale of be∣ing,
is a physical property common to all
matter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="19"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Reproduction in general.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall now more closely examine this
property common to the animal and
vegetable; this faculty of producing beings si∣milar
to themselves; this successive chain of in∣dividuals
which constitutes the real existence of
the species: And, without limiting our research
to the generation of man, or of any particular
animal, let us contemplate the general phaeno∣mena
of reproduction; let us collect facts, and
enumerate the various methods employed by
Nature for the renovation and transmission of
organized existences.</P>
<P>The first, and apparently the most simple me∣thod,
is to assemble in one body an infinite num∣ber
of similar organic bodies, and to compose its
substance in such a manner, that every part shall
contain a germ or embryo of the same species,
and which might become a whole of the same
kind with that of which it constitutes a part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The intelligent reader will perceive that this sentence, though not very obvious, contains the principle upon which the subsequent theory of generation adopted by the author is founded. It means no more than that the bodies of animals and of vegetables are composed of an infinite number of or∣ganic particles, perfectly similar, both in figure and substance, to the whole animal or plant, of which they are the constituent parts.</NOTE>.
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
This apparatus appears, at first sight, to suppose
a profusion of expence. Such magnificence,
however, is not uncommon in Nature. It is dis∣cernible
even in the more common and inferior
species, as in worms, polypi, elms, willows,
and many other plants and insects, every part of
which contains a whole, and, in order to become
a plant or an insect, requires only to be unfold∣ed
or expanded. Considering organized bodies
under this point of view, an individual is a
whole uniformly constructed in all parts, a col∣lection
of an infinite number of particles every
way similar, an assemblage of germs or minute
individuals of the same species, which, in certain
circumstances, are capable of being expanded,
and of becoming new beings like those from
which they were originally separated.</P>
<P>This idea, when traced to the bottom, disco∣vers
a relation between animals, vegetables, and
minerals, which we would not have suspected.
Salts, and some other minerals, consist of parts
similar to one another, and to the whole. A
grain of sea-salt, as we distinctly perceive by the

by a larger magnifier, are themselves com∣posed
of still smaller cubes. The primitive and
constituent particles of this salt must, therefore,
unquestionably consist of cubes so minute, that
they will for ever escape our observation. Plants
and animals, which possess the power of multi∣plying
by all their parts, are organized bodies
composed of similar organic bodies, the primi∣tive
and constituent particles of which are also
organic and similar. Of these we discern the
accumulated quantity; but we can only recog∣nise
the constituent particles by reason and ana∣logy.</P>
<P>From this view, we are led to conclude, that
there exists in nature an infinity of <HI>organic, li∣ving
particles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To avoid the introduction of terms which might not be ge∣nerally understood, it is necessary to inform the reader, that the phrases <HI>corbs organiques vivans, parties organiques vivantes,</HI> et <HI>mole∣cules organiques vivantes,</HI> which occur so often in this volume, and form the basis of our auth r's theory, are uniformly, in the ver∣sion, expressed by the words <HI>organic particles.</HI></NOTE>, of the same substance with orga∣nized
beings. A similar structure we have al∣ready
remarked in more inanimated matter,
which is composed of an infinite number of mi∣nute
particles that have an exact resemblance to
the whole body. And, as the accumulation
perhaps of millions of cubes are necessary to the
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
formation of a single grain of sea-salt that is per∣ceptible
by our senses, an equal number of simi∣lar
organic particles are requisite to produce one
of those numberless germs contained in an elm,
or in a polypus. A cube of sea-salt must be dis∣solved
before we can discover, by means of
crystallization, the minute cubes of which it is
composed: In the same manner, the parts of an
elm or of a polypus must be separated, before we
can recognise, by means of vegetation, or ex∣pansion,
the small elms or polypi contained in
the different parts of these bodies.</P>
<P>The difficulty of assenting to this idea proceeds
from the well known prejudice, that we can on∣ly
judge of the compound by the simple;
that, to discover the organic structure of any
being, it must first be reduced to its simple and
unorganic parts; and that hence it is more easy
to conceive how a cube must necessarily be com∣posed
of other cubes, than how a polypus can
be composed of other polypi. But, if we ex∣amine
attentively what is meaned by simple and
compound, we shall find, that in this, as in every
thing else, the plan of Nature is very different
from the grossness and imperfection of our con∣ceptions.</P>
<P>Our senses, it is well known, convey not to
us exact representations of external objects.
When we want to calculate, to judge, to com∣pare,
to weigh, to measure, &amp;c. we are obliged
to have recourse to foreign aid, to rules, to prin∣ciples,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
to usages, to instruments, &amp;c. All these
adminicles are efforts of human genius, and be∣long
more or less to the abstraction of our ideas.
This abstraction, with regard to us, constitutes
the simplicity of things; and the difficulty of re∣ducing
them to this abstraction is the compound.
Extension, for example, being a general and ab∣stract
property of matter, is not much com∣pounded.
In order, however, to judge concern∣ing
it, we have imagined some extensions to
have no thickness, others to have neither thick∣ness
nor breadth, and points, which are exten∣sions
without being extended. All these abstrac∣tions
have been invented as supports to the un∣derstanding;
and the few definitions employed
in geometry have given rise to numberless pre∣judices
and false conceptions. Whatever is re∣ducible
under any of these definitions is called
simple; and such things as cannot be easily re∣duced
to this standard are considered as complex.
Thus, a triangle, a square, a circle, a cube, and
all those curves of which we know the geome∣trical
properties, are regarded as simple. But
every thing which we cannot reduce under these
sigures, or abstract rules, appears to us to be com∣plex.
We never reflect, that all these geometri∣cal
sigures exist no where but in our own ima∣ginations,
or that, if they are ever found in Na∣ture,
it is only because she exhibits every pos∣sible
form; and the appearance of simple figures,
as an exact cube, or an equilateral pyramid, is,
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
perhaps, more difficult and rare to be found in
nature, than the complex forms of plants or of
animals. It is in this manner that we perpetu∣ally
consider the abstract as simple, and the real
as complex. But, in nature, no abstract exists;
nothing is simple; every object is compounded.
We are unable to penetrate into the intimate
structure of bodies. We cannot, therefore, de∣termine
what objects are more or less complex,
unless by the greater or less relation they have
to ourselves, and to the rest of the universe. For
this reason, we regard the animal as being more
complex than the vegetable, and the vegetable
than the mineral. With respect to us, this no∣tion
is just; but we know not whether the ani∣mal,
vegetable, or mineral, be, in reality, the most
complex or the most simple; and we are igno∣rant
whether the production of a globe or a
cube requires a greater effort of Nature than that
of a germ, or an organic particle. If we were
to indulge in conjectures upon this subject, we
might imagine the most common and most nu∣merous
objects to be the most simple. But this
would make animals more simple than plants or
minerals, because the former exceed the latter in
number of species.</P>
<P>But, without dwelling longer on this subject,
it is sufficient to have shown, that all our no∣tions
concerning simple and compound are ab∣stract
ideas; that they cannot be applied to the
complex operations of nature; that, when we
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
attempt to reduce all bodies into elements of a
cubical, prismatic, globular, or any other regular
figure, we substitute our own imaginations in
opposition to real existences; and that the forms
of the constituent particles of different bodies
are absolutely unknown to us; and, of course, we
may believe or suppose that organized beings
are composed of similar organic particles, as well
as that a cube consists of other cubes. We have
no other method of judging but by experience.
We know that a cube of sea-salt is composed
of many lesser cubes, and that an elm consists of
a great number of minute elms; because, if we
take a piece of a branch, of a root, of the wood
separated from the trunk, or a seed, from all
these a new tree is produced. The polypus,
and some other species of animals, may likewise
be multiplied by cuttings separated from any
part of their bodies; and, as our rule of judging
in both cases is the same, why should we form
a different opinion concerning them?</P>
<P>The above reasoning renders it extremely
probable, that there really exists in nature an
infinite number of small organized beings, every
way similar to those large organized bodies
which make such a conspicuous figure in this
world; that these small organized beings are
composed of living organic particles, which are
common both to animals and vegetables, and are
their primary and incorruptible elements; that
an assemblage of these particles constitutes an
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
animal or a plant; and, consequently, that re∣production
or generation is nothing but a change
of form, effected solely by the addition of simi∣lar
particles; and the death, or resolution of
organized bodies, is only a separation of the
same particles. Of the truth of this doctrine,
not a doubt will remain, after the proofs de∣livered
in the following chapters are perused.
Besides, if we reflect on the growth of trees, and
consider what an immense mass is produced from
so small an origin, we must be persuaded that this
increase of matter is effected by the simple addi∣tion
of organic particles which are similar to one
another, and to the whole. The seed first pro∣duces
a small tree, which it contains in minia∣ture
within its coats. At the top of this small
tree a bud is formed, which contains the tree
that is to spring the next season; and this bud
is an organized body similar to the small tree of
the preceding year. The small tree of the se∣cond
year, in the same manner, produces a bud
which contains a tree for the third year; and
this process uniformly goes on as long as the
tree continues to vegetate: Buds are likewise
formed at the extremity of each branch, which
contain, in miniature, trees similar to that of the
first year. It is evident, therefore, that trees are
composed of minute organized bodies similar to
themselves, and that the whole individual is
formed by a numerous assemblage of minute and
similar individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27"/>
But, it may be demanded, were not all these
minute, and similarly organized bodies, contain∣ed
in the seed? and may not the order of their
unfolding be traced from that source? for it is
apparent, that the first bud was surmounted by
a similar bud, which was not expanded till the
second year, and the third bud was not unfold∣ed
till the third year; and, consequently, the seed
may be said to have really contained the whole
buds which would be formed for 100 years, or
till the dissolution of the plant: It is also appa∣rent,
that this seed contained not only all the
small organized bodies which must in time have
constituted the individual tree itself, but like∣wise
all the seeds, and all the individuals which
would successively arise, till the final destruction
of the species.</P>
<P>This, indeed, is a capital difficulty; and we
shall therefore examine it with the greater at∣tention.
It is true, that the seed produced a
small tree the first year, solely by the unfolding
of the bud or germ which it contained, and that
this small tree existed in miniature in the bud.
But it is not equally certain that the bud of the
second year, and those of the succeeding years,
nor that all the small organic bodies, and the
seeds which must have been formed till the end
of the world, or the destruction of the species,
were contained in the first seed. This opinion
supposes an infinite progression, and makes every
individual a source of eternal generations. The
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
first seed, for instance, must have included all
the plants of its species which have existed, or
ever will exist; and the first man must have
contained in his loins all the men who have ap∣peared,
or will appear, on the face of the earth.
Every seed, and every animal, according to this
doctrine, must have included in its own body an
infinite posterity. If we yield to reasonings of
this kind, we must lose sight of truth in the
labyringths of infinity; and, in place of solving,
or of throwing light upon the question, we will
involve it in tenfold obscurity. It is removing
the object beyond the reach of our vision, and
then complaining that we cannot see it.</P>
<P>Let us investigate the nature of the ideas of
infinite progression and expansion. How do we
acquire them? In what do they instruct us? We
derive the idea of infinity from the idea of what
is limited. It is in this manner we obtain the
ideas of infinite succession, and geometrical infi∣nity:
Every individual is a unit; several indivi∣duals
make a limited number; and a whole spe∣cies
is to us an infinite multitude. From the
same data which we have demonstrated the non∣entity
of geometrical infinity, we might prove,
that infinite succession, or propagation, rests on
no firmer basis; that it is only an abstract idea,
a mere deduction from the idea of finite objects,
by lopping off the limits which necessarily ter∣minate
every magnitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this fully demonstrated in my preface to the French translation of Newton's fluxions, p. 7.</NOTE>; and, of course, that
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
every opinion which infallibly leads to the idea
of actual existence, upon no better authority
than what is derived from geometrical or nume∣rical
infinity, ought to be rejected.</P>
<P>The partizans of this opinion are now redu∣ced
to the necessity of acknowledging, that
their infinity of succession and of multiplica∣tion
is only an indeterminable or indefinite
number. But, say they, the first seed, of an
elm for example, which weighs not a grain,
actually contains all the organic particles requi∣site
for the formation of this tree, and of all the
individuals of the same species which shall ever
appear. Is this a solution of the difficulty? Is
it not cutting the knot, in place of untying it?</P>
<P>When, is reply to the question, how beings
are multiplied? it is answered, that the multi∣plication
was compleated in the creation of the
first individuals, is not this both an acknow∣ledgment
of ignorance, and a renouncing of all
desire of farther improvement? We ask how
one being produces its like? and we receive for
answer, that the whole was created at once. A
strange solution; for, whether only one or a
thousand generations had passed, the same diffi∣culty
remains, and, instead of removing it, the
supposition of an indefinite number of germs, all
existing and contained in a single germ, increa∣ses
and renders it altogether incomprehensible.</P>
<P>I allow, that it is much easier to find fault,
than to investigate truth, and that the question
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
concerning reproduction is perhaps of such a
subtile nature, as not to admit of a full and satis∣factory
explication. But we ought at least to
inquire whether it be altogether inscrutable; and,
in the course of this inquiry, we will discover all
that can be known, and the reason why we can
know no more.</P>
<P>Questions or inquiries are of two kinds; the
first regard primary causes, the other particular
effects. If, for example, it be asked why mat∣ter
is impenetrable? we must either return no
answer, or reply by saying, that matter is
impenetrable, because it is impenetrable. The
same answer must be made, if we inquire
into the cause of gravity, of extension, of the
inertia of bodies, or of any general quality of
matter. Such is the nature of all general and
abstract qualities, that, having no mode of com∣paring
them with other objects in which they
do not exist, we are totally incapable of reason∣ing
concerning them; and therefore all inqui∣ries
of this kind, being beyond the powers of
human intellect, are perfectly uselesss.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, if the reason of par∣ticular
effects be demanded, we are always in a
condition to give a distinct answer, whenever we
can show that these effects are produced by one
of the general causes; and the question is equal∣ly
solved, whether the particular effect proceeds
immediately from a general cause, or from a
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
chain of successive effects, provided we have a
clear conception of the dependence of these ef∣fects
upon each other, and of their mutual rela∣tions.</P>
<P>But, when a particular effect appears not to
have any dependence upon more general effects,
or has no analogy to effects already known, we
are then totally unable to give any explication
of it; because we have no similar object with
which it can be compared. We cannot explain
a general cause, because it equally exists in every
object; and, on the contrary, we can give no
account of a singular or isolated effect; because
the same qualities exist not in any other subject.
To explain a general cause, we must discover one
still more general; but a singular and detached
effect may be illustrated by the discovery of an
analogous effect, which experience or accident
may exhibit.</P>
<P>There is still another kind of question, which
may be called a question of fact. For example,
why do trees, dogs, &amp;c. exist? All questions of
this kind are perfectly insoluble; for those who
solve them by final causes consider not that they
mistake the effect for the cause: The relation of
particular objects to ourselves has no connection
with their origin. Moral affinity or fitness can
never become a physical reason.</P>
<P>Questions in which we employ the word <HI>Why,</HI>
ought to be carefully distinguished from those
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
in which we employ <HI>How,</HI> and still more from
those in which we ought to use the words <HI>how
much</HI> or <HI>how many. Why</HI> always relates to the
cause of the effect, or to the effect itself; <HI>how</HI> re∣lates
to the manner in which the effect happens;
and <HI>how much</HI> relates to the measure or quantity
of the effect.</P>
<P>These distinctions being established, let us now
examine the question concerning the reproduc∣tion
of beings. If it be demanded <HI>why</HI> animals
and vegetables continue their species? we clear∣ly
perceive that this is a question of fact, and
therefore that it is useless and insolvable. But,
if it be asked <HI>how</HI> animals and vegetables are re∣produced?
we are enabled to solve the question,
by giving the history of the generation of every
species of animal, and of the reproduction of e∣very
species of plant: After tracing, however,
every possible method of propagation, and ma∣king
the most exact observations, we have only
learned the facts; but have not discovered the
causes: And, as the means Nature employs in
multiplying and continuing the species, seem to
have no relation to the effects produced, we are
still under the necessity of asking, by what secret
cause she enables beings to propagate their
kinds?</P>
<P>This question is very different from the first
and second. It admits of nice scrutiny, and e∣ven
allows us to employ the powers of imagina∣tion.
It is, therefore, by no means insolvable;
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
for it belongs not to a general cause. Neither
is it solely a question of fact: And, if we can
conceive a method of reproduction, depending
on primary causes, or which, at least, is not re∣pugnant
to them, we ought to be satisfied with
it; and the more relation it has to the other ef∣fects
of Nature, it will rest upon a firmer basis.</P>
<P>By the nature of the question, then, we are
permitted to form hypotheses, and to chuse that
which appears to have the greatest analogy to the
other phaenomena of nature. But we ought to
reject every hypothesis which supposes the thing
to be already accomplished, such, for example,
as that which supposes the first germ to contain
all the germs of the same species, or that every
reproduction is a new creation, an immediate
effect of the will of the Deity; for all hypo∣theses
of this kind are mere matters of fact, con∣cerning
which it is impossible to reason. We
must likewise reject every hypothesis which is
founded on final causes, such as, that reproduc∣tion
is ordained in order to replace the living
for the dead; that the earth may always be co∣vered
with vegetables and peopled with animals;
that men may be supplied with abundance of
nourishment, &amp;c.; for such hypotheses, in place
of explaining the effect by physical causes, stand
on no other foundation than arbitrary relations
and moral affinities. We ought, at the same
time, to despise those general axioms and phy∣sical
problems so frequently and so injudicious∣ly
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
employed as principles by some philosophers,
such as, `Nulla foecundatio extra corpus;' e∣very
living creature proceeds from an egg; ge∣neration
always supposes sexes, &amp;c. These max∣ims
must not be taken in an absolute sense; they
signify no more than that the thing happens
more commonly in this manner than in any o∣ther.</P>
<P>Let us, then, endeavour to find an hypothesis
that will be liable to none of these defects or in∣cumbrances;
and, if we shall not succeed in ex∣plaining
the mechanism employed by Nature for
the reproduction of beings, we shall, at least, be
able to approach nearer to the truth than we
have hitherto arrived.</P>
<P>In the same manner as we make moulds by
which we can bestow on the external parts of
bodies whatever figure we please, let us suppose,
that Nature can form moulds by which she
bestows on bodies both an external and internal
figure; would not this be one method by which
reproduction might be effected?</P>
<P>Let us first consider whether this supposition
be well founded; let us examine whether it
contains any thing that is absurd or contradic∣tory;
and then we shall discover what conse∣quences
may be drawn from it. Though our
senses reach not beyond the external parts of
bodies, we have clear ideas of their different si∣gures
and external affections, and we can imi∣tate
Nature, by representing external figures in
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
different ways, as by painting, by sculpture, and
by moulds. But, though our senses be limited
to external qualities, we know that bodies pos∣sess
internal qualities, some of which are general,
as gravity. This quality or power acts not in
proportion to the surfaces, but to the masses, or
quantities of matter. Thus, there are in Nature
powers, and even of the most active kind, which
penetrate the internal parts of matter. We
are unable to form distinct ideas of such qualities;
because, not being external, they fall not under
the cognisance of our senses. But we can com∣pare
their effects, and may draw analogies from
them, in order to account for the effects of simi∣lar
qualities.</P>
<P>If our eyes, in place of representing to us only
the surfaces of bodies, were so constructed as to
perceive their internal parts alone, we should then
have clear ideas of the latter, without knowing
any thing of the former. Upon this supposition,
moulds for the internal constitution, which I have
supposed to be employed by Nature, would be equal∣ly
obvious and easy to conceive as moulds for the
external figures of bodies; and we should then
be in a condition to imitate the internal parts of
bodies, as we now imitate the external. These
internal moulds, though beyond our reach, may
be in the possession of Nature, as she endows
bodies with gravity, which penetrates every par∣ticle
of matter. The supposition of internal
moulds being thus founded on analogy, let us
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
next examine whether it involves any contradic∣tion.</P>
<P>It may be alledged, that the expression, <HI>inter∣nal
mould,</HI> includes two opposite and contradic∣tory
ideas; for the idea of a <HI>mould</HI> relates only to
the furface; but the idea of internal, as here em∣ployed,
has a relation to the whole mass; and
therefore we might, with equal propriety, talk
of a massy furface as of an internal mould.</P>
<P>I allow, that, when ideas are attempted to be
represented which have never been expressed,
we are sometimes obliged to use terms that are
apparently contradictory. To avoid this incon∣venience,
philosophers have been accustomed to
employ unusual terms, in place of those which
have a received signification. But this artifice
is of no use, when we can show, that the seem∣ing
contradiction lies in the words, and not in
the idea. But a simple idea cannot include a
contradiction; i. e. whenever we can form an
idea of a thing, if this idea be simple, it cannot
be complex; it can include no other idea; and,
of course, it can contain nothing that is opposite
or contradictory.</P>
<P>Simple ideas are not only the first apprehen∣sions
received by the senses, but the first com∣parisons
which we form of these apprehensions:
For the first apprehension is always the result of
comparison. The idea of the largeness or di∣stance
of an object necessarily implies a compa∣rison
with bulk or distance in general. Thus,
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
when a idea includes nothing more than com∣parison,
it ought to be regarded as simple; and,
consequently, it can contain nothing contradic∣tory.
The idea of an internal mould is of this
species. There is in nature a quality known by
the name of gravity, which penetrates the in∣ternal
parts of bodies. I understand the idea of
an internal mould to be relative to gravity; and,
therefore, as it includes only a comparison, it
can imply no contradiction.</P>
<P>Let us now trace the consequences that may
be drawn from this supposition; let us likewise
investigate such facts as may correspond with it;
and the more analogies we can collect, the sup∣position
will be rendered the more probable. We
shall begin with unfolding the idea of external
moulds, and how it may lead us to conceive the
mode of reproduction.</P>
<P>Nature, in general, appears to have a greater
bias towards life than death: She seems anxious
to organize bodies as much as possible. Of this
the multiplication of germs, which may be in∣finitely
increased, is a convincing proof; and it
may be safely affirmed, that, if all matter is not
organized, it is only because organized beings
destroy one another; for we can increase, at
pleasure, the number of animals and vegetables;
but we cannot augment the quantity of stones
or of dead matter. This appears to indicate, that
the most ordinary and familiar operation of Na∣ture
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
is the production of organized bodies; and
here her power knows no limitation.</P>
<P>To render this more plain, we shall calculate
what may be produced by a single germ. The
seed of an elm, which weighs not above the hun∣dredth
part of an ounce, will, in 100 years, form
a tree, of which the mass will amount to ten
cubic fathoms. But, at the tenth year, this elm
will have produced 1000 seeds, each of which, in
100 years more, will consist of ten cubic fathoms.
Thus, in the space of 110 years, more than
10,000 cubic fathoms of organized matter are
produced. Ten years after, we shall have ten
million of fathoms, without including the annu∣al
increase of 10,000, which would amount to
100,000 more; and, in ten years more, the num∣ber
of cubic fathoms would be 10,000,000,000,000.
Hence, in 130 years, a single germ would pro∣duce
a mass of organized matter equal to 1000
cubic leagues; for a cubic league contains only
about 10,000,000,000 cubic fathoms; ten years
after, this mass would be increased to a thousand
times a thousand leagues, or one million of cu∣bic
leagues; and, in ten more, it would amount
to 1,000,000,000,000 cubic leagues; so that,
in the space of 150 years, the whole globe might
be converted into organized matter of a single
species. Nature would know no bounds in the
production of organized bodies, if her progress
were not obstructed by matter which is not sus∣ceptible
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
of organization; and this is a full de∣monstration
that she has no tendency to increase
brute matter; that her sole object is the multi∣plication
of organized beings; and that, in this
operation, she never stops but when irresistible
obstacles occur. What we have remarked con∣cerning
the seed of an elm, may be extended to
any other germ; and it would be easy to show,
that, by hatching all the eggs which are produ∣ced
by hens for a course of 30 years, the num∣ber
of fowls would be so great as to cover the
whole surface of the earth.</P>
<P>Calculations of this kind evince the tenden∣cy
of Nature towards the production of orga∣nized
bodies, and the facility with which she
performs the operation. But I will not stop
here. Instead of dividing matter into <HI>orga∣nized</HI>
and <HI>brute matter,</HI> the general division ought
to be into <HI>living</HI> and <HI>dead matter.</HI> That what
is called <HI>brute matter</HI> is nothing but matter
produced by the <HI>death</HI> of animals and vegetables,
might be proven from the enormous quantities
of shells, and other relicts of living bodies,
which constitute the principal part of stones,
marbles, clays, marles, earths, turfs, and other
substances that are commonly reckoned <HI>brute
matter,</HI> but are, in reality, composed of decayed
animals and vegetables. This doctrine will be
farther illustrated by the subsequent remarks,
which appear to be well founded.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40"/>
The great facility and activity of Nature in
the production of organized bodies, the existence
of infinite numbers of organic particles which
constitute life, have been already demonstrated.
We now proceed to inquire into the principal
causes of death and destruction. In general,
beings which have a power of converting matter
into their own substances, or of assimilating the
parts of other beings, are the greatest destroyers.
Fire, for example, which converts almost every
species of matter into its own substance, is the
greatest source of destruction that we are ac∣quainted
with. Animals seem to partake of the
nature of flame; their internal heat is a species
of fire next to flame. Accordingly, animals are
the greatest destroyers; and they assimilate and
convert into their own substance all bodies which
can serve them for nourishment. But, though
these two causes of destruction be very conside∣rable,
and their effects tend perpetually to the
destruction of organized bodies, the cause of re∣production
is infinitely more active and power∣ful.
It even seems to derive, from destruction
itself, fresh powers of multiplying; for assi∣milation,
which is one cause of death, is, at
the same time, a necessary mean of producing
life.</P>
<P>The destruction of organized bodies, as has
been remarked, is only a separation of the orga∣nic
particles of which they are composed. These

by some active power. But what is this
power? It is the power, possessed by animals
and vegetables, of assimilating the matter of their
food; and is not this the same, or nearly con∣nected
with the same power which is the cause
of reproduction?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Nutrition and Growth.</HEAD>
<P>AN animal body is a kind of internal mould,
in which the nutritive matter is so assi∣milated
to the whole, that, without changing
the order or proportion of the parts, each part
receives an augmentation. This increase of
bulk has, by some philosophers, been called an
expansion or unfolding of the parts; because
they fancied they had accounted for the phae∣nomenon,
by telling us, that the form of an
animal in embryo was the same as at full matu∣rity,
and that, therefore, it was easy to conceive
how its parts should be proportionally unfolded
and augmented by the addition of accessory
matter.</P>
<P>But, how can we have a clear idea of this aug∣mentation
or expansion, if we consider not the
bodies of animals, and each of their parts, as so
many internal moulds which receive the acces∣sory
matter in the order that results from their
position and structure? This expansion cannot
be effected solely by an addition to the surfaces,
but, on the contrary, by an intus-susception, or
by penetrating the whole mass; for the size of
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
the part is augmented proportionally, without
changing its form. Hence it is necessary, that
the increasing matter must, in some manner or
other, intimately penetrate the whole part in all
its dimensions: It is equally necessary, that this
penetration should be effected in a fixed order
and proportion, so that no internal point receive
more matter than another; otherwise some parts
would be more quickly unfolded than others,
which would entirely change their figure. What
can thus regulate the accessory matter, and force
it to arrive equally and proportionally to every
internal point of the body, if we have not re∣course
to an internal mould?</P>
<P>The bodies of animals and of vegetables, there∣fore,
consist of internal moulds, which uniform∣ly
preserve the same figure. But their masses
may receive a proportional increase, by the ex∣pansion
of the moulds in all their dimensions,
both internal and external; and this expansion
is effected by an intus-susception of an acces∣sory
and foreign matter, which intimately pe∣netrates
the whole, and assumes the same form
and identity of substance with the matter of the
moulds themselves.</P>
<P>But what is the nature of that matter which
an animal, or a vegetable, assimilates to its own
substance? What bestows on it that force and
activity which enables it to penetrate the inter∣nal
mould? If such a power exists, must it not
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
be similar to that by which the mould itself is
capable of being reproduced?</P>
<P>These three questions include the whole sub∣ject,
and appear to depend on one another; for
it is impossible to explain, in a satisfactory man∣ner,
the reproduction of animals or vegetables,
if we have not a clear idea how the operation
of nutrition is performed. Each question, there∣fore,
demands a separate examination, that we
may be enabled to compare their results.</P>
<P>The first, which regards the nature and qua∣lities
of the nutritive matter, is in part resolved
by the preceding reasonings, and shall be clear∣ly
unfolded in the subsequent chapters. We
shall demonstrate, that there are in nature infi∣nite
numbers of living organic particles; that
nature produces them without any expence,
because their existence is constant and invariable;
that the causes of death only disunite these par∣ticles,
but do not destroy them. Thus the mat∣ter
assimilated by an animal or vegetable, is an
organic matter of the same nature with that of
the animal or vegetable, and, consequently, may
augment the size without changing the figure or
the qualities of the original moulds; because it
has the same qualities and the same form with
the matter of which the moulds themselves are
composed. Of the quantity of aliment taken
by an animal to support its life, and to maintain
the vigour of its organs, and of the juices ab∣sorbed
by the roots and leaves of a plant, a great
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
part is rejected by transpiration, by secretions,
and by other excretories; and a small portion
only is retained for the nourishment and expan∣sion
of the parts. It is extremely probable, that,
in the bodies of animals and of vegetables, a se∣paration
is made between the <HI>brute</HI> particles of
the aliment and the organic; that the former are
carried off by the methods just mentioned; that
nothing but the organic particles remain; and
that they are distributed, by means of some active
power, to the different parts, in a proportion so
exact, that neither more nor fewer are applied
than answer the purposes of nutrition, and of an
equal growth and expansion.</P>
<P>As to the second question, What is the nature
of that active power, which enables the organic
matter to penetrate and combine with the inter∣nal
mould? It is apparent, from the preceding
chapter, that powers exist in nature, like that of
gravity, which affect the most internal parts of
matter, without having the smallest relation to
its external qualities. These powers, as former∣ly
observed, are beyond the reach of our senses;
because their action is exerted upon the intimate
structure of bodies. It is evident, therefore, that
we can never obtain a clear idea of them, nor
of their mode of acting. Their existence, how∣ever,
is not less certain, than that, by means of
them, most natural effects are produced, espe∣cially
those of nutrition and expansion, which
must be owing to a cause which penetrates the
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
most intimate recesses of the original moulds;
for, in the same manner as gravity pervades the
whole parts of matter, the power which pushes
forward or attracts the organic particles of food,
penetrates the internal parts of organized bodies;
and, as these bodies have a certain form, which
we have distinguished by the appellation of <HI>in∣ternal
moulds,</HI> the organic particles, pushed on
by the action of this penetrating force, must en∣ter
in an order relative to this form, and conse∣quently
cannot alter its figure, but only augment
its bulk, and give rise to the growth and expan∣sion
of organized bodies: And if, in the orga∣nized
body, thus expanded, there be some par∣ticles
similar to the whole, both internally and
externally, these parts will become the source of
reproduction.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the third question, name∣ly,
Is it not by a similar power that the internal
mould itself is reproduced? This power appears to
be not only similar, but the very same with that
which is the cause of expansion and reproduc∣tion;
for, in an organized and expanded body,
nothing farther is necessary for the reproduction
of a new body similar to itself, than that it should
contain some particle every way similar to the
whole. This particle, at its first separation, will
not present to our eyes a sensible figure by which
we can compare it with the whole body. But,
when separated from the body, and put in a si∣tuation
to receive proper nourishment, this simi∣lar
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
particle will begin to expand and to exhibit
the form of an entire and independent being, of
the same species with that from which it was
detached. Thus, a willow or a polypus, as they
contain a larger proportion of particles similar
to the whole, than most other substances, when
cut into any indefinite number of pieces, each
segment becomes a new body similar to the pa∣rent
from which it was separated.</P>
<P>Now, in a body of which all the particles are
similar to itself, the organization is the most
simple, as has been remarked in the first chap∣ter;
for it is only a repetition of the same form,
a congeries of figures similarly organized. It is
for this reason that the most simple bodies, the
most imperfect species, are most easily and most
abundantly reproduced. But, if an organized
body contain only few particles similar to itself,
as these alone are capable of a second expansion,
its power of reproducing will be both more dif∣ficult,
and more circumscribed as to the number
produced. The organization of bodies of this
last kind is also more complex, because it pos∣sesses
fewer parts which are similar to the whole;
and, therefore, the more perfectly a body is or∣ganized,
its power of reproduction will be pro∣portionally
diminished.</P>
<P>In this manner we discover nourishment,
growth, and propagation, to be effects of the same
cause. Organized bodies are nourished by the
particles of aliment which are similar to them;
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
they grow or are expanded by absorbing those or∣ganic
particles which correspond to their own na∣ture;
and they propagate, because they contain
some organic particles similar to themselves. It
only remains to examine whether these similar
organic particles are extracted from the food, or
have a primary and independent existence in the
bodies themselves. If we suppose the latter, we
recur to the infinity of similar parts or germs
contained within each other, an hypothesis which
we have already demonstrated to be replete with
difficulties and absurdities. We must, therefore,
hold, that the similar parts are extracted from the
food; and, after what has been said on the sub∣ject,
we hope to be able to explain the manner
of their absorption, and how the more minute
organic particles which compose them are u∣nited.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the organic parts
of food were separated from those which have
no analogy to the animal or vegetable, by tran∣spiration
and other excretions. The first re∣main,
and serve to expand and nourish the body:
But these organic parts must be of very differ∣ent
species; and, as each part of the body re∣ceives
only a proper number of those which corre∣spond
to it, the surplus, it is natural to imagine,
will be returned from all parts of the body, and
be collected in one or more reservoirs, where they
will unite and form small organic bodies similar
to the first, and which require nothing but pro∣per
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
circumstances for expanding and becoming
new individuals of the same species; for, all parts
of the body sending off organic particles similar
to those of which themselves are composed, the
result of their union must be the production of
new organized bodies similar to the original.
This being granted, may we not conclude, that
this is the reason why organized bodies, during
the time of their growth and expansion, are sel∣dom
or never capable of reproducing; because
the growing parts absorb the whole organic par∣ticles
presented to them, and no surplus being
sent from the different parts of the body, pro∣pagation
becomes, of course, impracticable?</P>
<P>This account of nutrition, and of reproduc∣tion,
will not, perhaps, be received by those phi∣losophers
who admit only a certain number of
mechanical principles, and reject every thing as
false which depends not upon them; and, as the
explication now given of nutrition and repro∣duction
has no connection with any of these
principles, they will conclude that it deserves
no credit. But I think very differently from
these philosophers. In admitting only a few
mechanical principles, they consider not how
much they contract the bounds of philosophy,
and how few phaenomena can, by this narrow
method of thinking, be fully expiscated.</P>
<P>The notion of explaining all the appearances
in nature upon the principles of mechanism, is,
doubtless, a great exertion, and was first attempt∣ed
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
by Des Cartes. But it is, at least, an unte∣nible
project; and, though it were otherwise,
we are unable to put it in execution. These
mechanical principles are, the extension of mat∣ter,
its impenetrability, its motion, its external
figure, its divisibility, the communication of mo∣tion
by impulse, by the action of springs, &amp;c.
These ideas we have acquired by our senses, and
we regard them as principles, because they are
general and common to all matter. But are we
certain that matter possesses no other qualities?
Ought we not rather to believe that these qua∣lities,
which we assume for principles, are only
modes of perception; and that, if the confor∣mation
of our senses were different, we would
recognize qualities in matter very different from
those above enumerated? It is presumptuous to
deny every quality to matter but those we are
acquainted with. Many general qualities, per∣haps,
remain to be discovered; and many may
exist which will for ever elude human discern∣ment.
The cause of impulsion, of cohesion, or
of any other mechanical principle, will always
continue to be equally inscrutable as that of at∣traction,
or of any other general quality. Hence
it may be concluded, that mechanical principles
are nothing else than general effects which ex∣perience
has enabled us to remark in matter;
and that, whenever we shall discover, either by
reflection, by analogy, or by experience, a new
general effect, it will become a new mechanical
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
principle, which may be employed with equal
advantage and certainty as any of those that are
already known.</P>
<P>The defect of Aristotle's philosophy was the
employing particular effects as causes; and that
of Des Cartes consists in the rejection of every
cause, but a few general effects. To use nothing
as causes but general effects, to endeavour to
augment the number of these, and to attempt to
generalize particular effects, would constitute the
most perfect principles of genuine philosophy.</P>
<P>In my theory of expansion and reproduction,
I first admit the mechanical principles, then the
penetrating force of gravity, and, from analogy
and experience, I have concluded the existence
of other penetrating forces peculiar to organized
bodies. I have proved by facts, that matter has
a strong tendency towards organization; and
that there are in nature an infinite number of
organic particles. I have, therefore, only gene∣ralized
particular observations, without advan∣cing
any thing contrary to mechanical principles,
when that term is used in its proper sense, as de∣noting
the general effects of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Generation of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>AS the organization of men, and of other
animals, is the most perfect, and the
most complex, the propagation of them is like∣wise
most difficult, and the number of indivi∣duals
is less abundant. I except here such ani∣mals
as can be multiplied by a separation of their
parts, or without the aid of generation, these
having been sufficiently treated of in the pre∣ceding
chapter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the Author gives an unnecessary recapitulation of Chap. III. to which the reader is referred.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But how will the theory delivered in the
former chapter apply to the generation of men,
and other animals, who are distinguished by
sexes? We understand, from what has been said,
how every individual may reproduce; but we
cannot conceive how two individuals, the one a
male, and the other a female, should uniformly
produce a third.</P>
<P>Before replying to this objection, I must ob∣serve,
that the writers on this subject have con∣fined
their ideas solely to the generation of men
and of animals, without attending to the nature
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
of reproduction in general: And, as the generation
of animals is the most complicated species of re∣production,
they have laboured under great dis∣advantages,
not only by attacking the most diffi∣cult
point, but by leaving themselves no subject
of comparison to enable them to illustrate the
question. To this circumstance I chiefly attri∣bute
the unsuccessfulness of their attempts. But,
by the route I have taken, I am persuaded that
I shall be able to give a satisfactory explanation
of every species of reproduction.</P>
<P>Let the generation of man serve as an ex∣ample.
To begin with infancy:</P>
<P>The expansion and growth of the different
parts of man's body being effected by the inti∣mate
penetration of organic particles analogous
to each of these parts, all the organic particles, in
early life, are absorbed, and entirely employed
in unfolding and augmenting his different mem∣bers.
He has, of course, little or no superflu∣ous
particles, till his growth be completed. It is
for this reason that infants are incapable of pro∣pagating.
But, when his body has nearly at∣tained
its full size, he requires not the same
quantity of organic particles; the surplus is,
therefore, sent from all parts into reservoirs de∣stined
for their reception. These reservoirs are
the testes and seminal vessels. At this very pe∣riod,
when the growth of the body is nearly
finished, puberty commences, and every phae∣nomenon
attending it discovers a superabundance
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
of nourishment: The voice changes into a
deeper tone; the beard begins to appear, and
other parts of the body are covered with hair;
the parts destined for generation are suddenly
expanded; the seminal fluid fills the reservoirs
prepared for its reception; and, without pro∣vocation,
it escapes from the body during sleep.
This superabundance is still more evident in the
female: It discovers itself by a periodic evacua∣tion,
which begins and terminates with the fa∣culty
of propagating; by a quick increase of the
breasts; and by a change in the sexual parts,
which shall be afterwards explained<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See below the Nat. Hist. of Man, chap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I conceive, then, that the organic particles
sent from all parts of the body into the testicles
and seminal vessels of the male, and into the
ovarium of the female, compose the seminal
fluid, which, in either sex, as formerly observed,
is a kind of extract from the several parts of the
body. These organic particles, instead of uni∣ting
and forming an individual similar to that in
whose body they are contained, as happens in
vegetables, and some imperfect animals, cannot
accomplish this end without a mixture of the
fluids of both sexes. When this mixture is made,
if the organic particles of the male exceed those
of the female, the result is a male; and, if those
of the female most abound, a female is gene∣rated.
I mean not that the organic particles of
the male or of the female could singly produce
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
individuals: A concurrence or union of both is
requisite to accomplish this end. Those small
moving bodies, called <HI>spermatic animals,</HI> which,
by the assistance of the microscope, are seen in
the seminal fluids of all male animals, are, per∣haps,
organized substances proceeding from the
individual which contains them; but, of them∣selves,
they are incapable of expansion, or of
becoming animals similar to those in whom they
exist. We shall afterwards demonstrate, that
there are similar animalcules in the seminal fluids
of females, and point out the place where this
fluid is to be found.</P>
<P>It is probable, that these organic bodies are
only the first rudiments of an animal, containing
nothing but its essential parts. We shall not en∣ter
into a detail of proofs on this subject, but
content ourselves with remarking, that the or∣ganization
of these pretended spermatic animals
may be very imperfect; or rather, that they
have the living organic particles mentioned above,
which are common both to vegetables and to
animals; or, at most, that they are only the first
junction of these particles.</P>
<P>But, to return to our subject. It may be ask∣ed,
how is it possible that the superfluous orga∣nic
particles should be detached from all parts of
the body, and unite upon the mixture of the
male and female fluids? Besides, are we certain
that such a mixture takes place? Has it not been
mentioned, that the female furnishes no fluid of
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
this kind? Is it an established fact, that the male
fluid enters the uterus? &amp;c.</P>
<P>To the first question I reply, that, if what I
had said concerning the penetration of the in∣ternal
mould by the organic particles, in growth
and nutrition, had been properly understood, it
would be easy to conceive, that, when these
particles are unable to penetrate the parts into
which they formerly entered, they must take
another rout, and, of course, arrive at some
other part, as the testicles and seminal vessels.
Every attempt to explain the animal oeco∣nomy,
and the various motions of the human
body, by mechanical principles alone, must be
vain and ineffectual; for it is evident, that the
circulation of the blood, muscular motion, and
other functions of an animated body, cannot be
accounted for by impulsion, or by any of the
common laws of mechanism. It is equally evi∣dent,
that growth and reproduction are effects
of laws of a different nature. Why, then, do
we refuse the existence of penetrating forces
which act upon the whole substances of bodies,
when we have examples of such powers in gra∣vity,
in magnetic attraction, in chemical affini∣ties?
Since, therefore, we are assured by facts,
and by a number of constant and uniform ob∣servations,
that there are powers in nature which
act not by impulsion, why are not these powers
ranked among mechanical principles? Why do
we reject them in the explanation of effects
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
which they are known to produce? Why are we
desirous of employing only the power of impul∣sion?
Is not this equally absurd as to judge of
painting by the touch; to explain the phaeno∣mena
that belong to the mass by those that relate
only to the surface; or to use one sense in place
of another? It is limiting the reasoning faculty
to a small number of mechanical principles,
which are by no means sufficient to explain the
various effects of nature.</P>
<P>But, if these penetrating forces be once ad∣mitted,
is it not natural to imagine, that those
par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>es which are most analogous to one ano∣ther
will unite in the most intimate manner; that
each part of the body will appropriate those
which are most agreeable to its nature; and that
the whole superfluous particles will form a semi∣nal
fluid, which shall contain all the organic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣ticles
necessary for forming a small organized
body, similar in every respect to that from which
the fluid is extracted? May not a force, similar
to that which is the cause of growth, be sufficient
to collect the superfluous organic particles, and
bestow on them the figure of the body from
which they proceed?</P>
<P>That our food contains an immense number
of organic particles, requires no formal proof;
since we are solely nourished by animals and ve∣getables,
which are organized substances. In the
stomach and intestines, the gross parts of the a∣liment
are separated and rejected by the excre∣tories.
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
The chyle, which is a purer part of
the aliment, is absorbed by the lacteal vessels;
from thence it is carried into the mass of blood,
and, in the course of circulation, it is more and
more refined, the unorganic and useless particles
being thrown out by transpiration and other se∣cretions:
But the organic particles are retained,
because they are analogous to the blood, and are
attracted by it. Hence, as the whole mass of
blood passes several times through the body,
during the course of this perpetual circula∣tion,
I suppose, that each particular part attracts
those particles which are most analagous to it,
and allows the rest to move on. In this manner
all the parts are nourished and unfolded, not, as
is commonly imagined, by a simple addition of
matter to their furfaces, but by an intimate pene∣tration
of substance, effected by a force which
acts equally upon every point of the whole mass:
And, after the different parts have acquired their
utmost growth, and are fully impregnated
with similar organic particles, as their substance
becomes then more dense and solid, I imagine
that they lose their faculty of attracting and re∣ceiving
the particles presented to them. But, as
the particles continue to be carried round in the
course of the circulation, and are no longer ab∣sorbed
in such quantities as formerly, they must,
of necessity, be deposited in some particular re∣servoir,
such as the testicles and seminal vessels.
When this fluid extract of the male is mixed
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
with that of the female, the particles which are
most analogous to each other, being actuated by
a penetrating force, unite and form a small or∣ganized
body, similar to the one or the other
sex; and this body, when once formed, requires
only an expansion of its parts, an operation
which is performed in the womb of the mother.</P>
<P>We shall now consider the second question,
namely, whether the female has a seminal fluid
similar to that of the male? In the <HI>first</HI> place,
though such a fluid exists in females, the mode of
emission is very different from that of the male,
being generally confined within the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quod intra se semen jacit, foemina vocatur; quod in hac <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acit, mas; <HI>Aristot. de animalibus, art.</HI> 18.</NOTE>. The
antients were so confident of the existence of a
female fluid, that they distinguished the two
sexes by their different modes of emission. But
those physicians who attempt to explain genera∣tion
by eggs, or by spermatic animalcules, insist,
that females have no peculiar fluid; that the
mucus issuing from the parts has been mistaken
for a seminal fluid; and that the opinion of the
antients on this subject is destitute of foundation.
This fluid, however, does exist; and the doubts
concerning it have arisen solely from attachment
to systems, and from the difficulty of discover∣ing
its reservoir. The fluid which is separated
from the glands about the neck and orifice of the
uterus, has no visible reservoir; and, as it flows
out of the body, it is natural to think that it is
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
not the prolific fluid, because it cannot co-ope∣rate
in the formation of the foetus, which is
performed within the uterus. The reservoir for the
prolific fluid of the female, therefore, must be situ∣ated
in a different part: It even flows abundant∣ly;
though, like that of the male, a small quan∣tity
is sufficient to produce a foetus. If a little
of the male fluid enters the uterus, either by its
orifice or by absorption, and meets with the
smallest drop of the female fluid, it is sufficient
for the purpose of propagation. Thus, nei∣ther
the observations of some anatomists, who
maintain that the seminal fluid of the male can
have no admission into the uterus, nor the oppo∣site
opinion maintained by their antagonists,
have any influence upon the theory we are en∣deavouring
to establish. But the discussion of
these points we leave to a future opportunity.</P>
<P>Having obviated such objections as might be
made, let us attend to the evidences that concur
in supporting our hypothesis. The first arises
from the analogy between growth and repro∣duction.
It is impossible to give a satisfactory
account of growth or expansion, without having
recourse to those penetrating forces, those affini∣ties
or attractions which we employed in explain∣ing
the formation of the small organic bodies
that are similar to the large bodies which con∣tain
them. A second analogy is derived from
this circumstance, that both nutrition and repro∣duction
proceed, not only from the same effi∣cient,
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
but from the same material cause, namely,
the organic particles of food; and what proves
the surplus of the nutritive particles to be the
cause of reproduction, is, that the body is not in
a condition to propagate till its growth be finish∣ed:
Of this we have daily examples, in dogs and
other animals, who follow, more closely than
we do, the laws of nature: They have no in∣clination
to propagate till they have nearly at∣tained
their full growth; and by this we know
whether the growth of a dog be finished; for
he seldom grows after being in a condition to
generate.</P>
<P>Another proof that the seminal fluid is form∣ed
of the surplus of the nutritive particles, arises
from the condition of eunuchs and other muti∣lated
animals: In this unnatural state, animals
grow fatter than those who retain all their parts.
The superabundance of nutriment, having no
organs for its evacuation, changes the whole ha∣bit
of their bodies. The knees and haunches
of eunuchs grow uncommonly large. The rea∣son
is evident. After their bodies have acquired
the common size, if the superfluous organic par∣ticles
found an issue, as in other men, the growth
would proceed no farther. But, as they want
organs for emitting the seminal fluid, which is
nothing but the superfluous nutritive particles,
it remains in the body, and has a constant ten∣dency
to expand the parts beyond their natural
size. Now, bones, it is well known, grow or
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
extend by their extremities, which are soft and
spongy, and, when they have once acquired so∣lidity,
they are incapable of farther extension:
Hence the superfluous organic particles can on∣ly
enlarge the spongy extremities of bones; and
this is the reason why the haunches, knees, &amp;c.
of eunuchs augment to a disproportioned bulk.</P>
<P>But the strongest proof of the truth of our present
doctrine arises from the resemblance of children
to their parents. Sons, in general, resemble their
fathers more than their mothers, and daughters
have a greater resemblance to their mothers than
their fathers; because, with regard to the gene∣ral
habit of body, a man resembles a man more
than a woman, and a woman resembles a wo∣man
more than a man. But, as to particular
features or habits, children sometimes resemble
the father, sometimes the mother, and sometimes
both. A child, for example, will have the eyes
of the father, and the mouth of the mother, or
the colour of the mother and the stature of the
father. Of such phaenomena it is impossible
to give any explication, unless we admit that
both parents have contributed to the formation
of the child, and, consequently, that there has
been a mixture of two seminal fluids.</P>
<P>These resemblances long embarrassed me, and,
till I had maturely considered the subject of ge∣neration,
led me into many errors and prejudices:
And it was not without much thought, a minute
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
examination of a great number of families, and a
multiplicity of evidence, that I could prevail on
myself to alter my former opinion, and to em∣brace
what I now believe to be truth. But the
objections which might occur concerning mulat∣toes,
mongrels, mules, and particular parental
resemblances, instead of opposing my theory,
I despair not of being able to show that they
strengthen and confirm it.</P>
<P>In youth, the seminal fluid is less copious, but
more stimulating. Its quantity continues to
augment till a certain age; because, in propor∣tion
as we approach that age, the parts of the
body become more solid, admit fewer nutritive
particles, send back more of them to the com∣mon
reservoirs, and, of course, augment the
quantity of the seminal fluid. Thus, if the ex∣ternal
organs have not been used, middle-aged
men, or even old men, procreate with more ease
than young men. This is evidently the case
with the vegetable tribes: A tree, the older it is,
produces the greater quantity of fruit.</P>
<P>Young people, who, by forced irritations, de∣termine
an unnatural quantity of this fluid into
the reservoirs prepared for its reception, imme∣diately
cease to grow, lose their flesh, and at last
fall into consumptions. The reason is apparent:
They lose, by premature and too frequent eva∣cuations,
the very substance which nature in∣tended
for the nourishment and growth of their
bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"/>
Men who are thin, but not emaciated, and
those who are plump, but not fat, are the most
vigorous. Whenever the superabundant nutri∣tive
particles begin to form fat, it is always at
the expence of the seminal fluid and other ge∣nerative
powers. When the growth of the dif∣ferent
parts of the body is compleat, when the
bones have acquired full solidity, when the car∣tilages
begin to ossify, and, lastly, when the parts
almost refuse the admission of nutritive particles,
then the fat augments considerably, and the
quantity of seminal fluid diminishes; because
the nutritive particles, instead of being sent back
to the reservoirs, are arrested in every part of
the body.</P>
<P>The quantity of seminal fluid not only in∣creases
till we arrive at a certain age, but it be∣comes
more thick. It contains, in the same
bounds, a greater quantity of matter. Its
specific gravity is nearly double that of the
blood; and, of course, it is heavier than any o∣ther
animal fluid.</P>
<P>To a man in health, an evacuation of this
fluid whets the appetite: He soon finds the ne∣cessity
of repairing the loss by fresh nourish∣ment.
Hence we may conclude, that abstinence
and hunger are the most effectual checks to lux∣ury
of every kind.</P>
<P>Many other remarks might be made on this
subject, which must be deferred till we come to
treat of the history of man: We shall, therefore,
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
conclude with a few observations. Most ani∣mals
discover no inclination for the sexes till
their growth be nearly finished: Those which
have but one season in the year, have no semi∣nal
fluid excepting at that time. Mr Needham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Needh. new microscopical discoveries, London 1745.</NOTE>
not only saw this liquor forming in the milt of
the <HI>Calmar,</HI> but likewise the spermatic animals,
and the milt itself, which have no existence till
the month of October, when this fish spawns on
the coasts of Portugal, where Needham made
the observation. After the spawning time is
over, the seminal liquor, the spermatic animals,
and the milt, dry up and totally disappear; till
the same season returns next year, when the
superfluous nutritive particles renew the milt as
formerly. The history of the deer will furnish
us with an opportunity of remarking the various
effects of rutting, the most conspicuous of which
is the extenuation of the animal; and, in those
species of animals whose rutting or spawning
happens but once in a year, the extenuation of
their bodies is proportionally great.</P>
<P>As women are smaller and weaker than men,
as their constitutions are more delicate, and, as
they take less food, it is natural to think that
their superfluous organic particles should also
be less abundant: Of course, their seminal fluid
will be weaker and smaller in quantity than that
of men; and, since the fluid of females contains
fewer organic particles, must not a greater num∣ber
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
of males than of females result from a mix∣ture
of these two fluids? This is really the case;
and to account for it has hitherto been deemed
impossible. The number of males born exceeds
that of females about a sixteenth part; and we
shall afterwards see that the same effect is pro∣duced
by the same cause in all the different spe∣cies
of animals.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Examination of the different Systems of Generation.</HEAD>
<P>PLATO, in the Timaeus, accounts not only
for the generation of men, of animals, of
plants, and of the elements, but even of the hea∣vens
and of the gods themselves, by images
reflected or extracted from the divine Creator;
which images, by an harmonic movement, are
arranged in the most perfect order, according to
the properties of number. The universe, he
says, is a copy of the Deity; time, space, mo∣tion,
and matter, are the images or representa∣tions
of his attributes; and secondary and parti∣cular
causes are results of the numeric and har∣monic
qualities of these images: The world,
from its excellency, is the most perfect animated
being. To give the world complete perfection,
it was necessary that it should contain all the o∣ther
animals, or all the possible forms and
representations of the creative power. Man is
one of these forms. The essence of all genera∣tion
consists in the unity and harmony of the
number Three, or of the Triangle, namely, that
which generates, that in which generation is
performed, and the result, or that which is
generated. The succession of individuals in the
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
species, is only a fugitive image of the immu∣table
eternity of this harmonic triangle, a uni∣versal
prototype of all existences, and of all ge∣nerations.</P>
<P>This philosopher paints only ideas. Disen∣gaged
from matter, he flies into the regions of
abstraction; and, losing sight of sensible objects,
he contemplates those of intellect alone. One
cause, one end, one mean, compose the whole
of his perceptions: God is the cause, perfection
the end, and harmonic representations the means.
This idea is sublime; the mode of philosophi∣sing
is noble and full of simplicity; but it is
perfectly vacant, and affords no objects for spe∣culation.
We are not pure intelligences. We
are unable to give real existence to our ideas.
Chained to matter, or rather depending on the
causes of our sensations, it is impossible that we
should realise abstractions. To Plato I might
reply in his own manner, 'The Creator realises
every thing he conceives; his perceptions be∣get
existence: The created being, on the con∣trary,
conceives nothing but by retrenching
from reality; and annihilation is necessary to
bring forth his ideas.'</P>
<P>Let us, without regret, therefore, confine our∣selves
to a philosophy more humble and more
material; and, keeping within the sphere which
nature has allotted us, let us examine those rapid
and daring spirits who attempt, though in vain,
to fly beyond the limits of humanity. The whole
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
of this Pythagorean philosophy, which is purely
intellectual, depends upon two principles, the
one false, and the other uncertain; namely, the
real power of abstraction, and the natural exist∣ence
of final causes. To apprehend numbers to
be real beings; to say that unity is a general
individual, which not only represents all indivi∣duals,
but even communicates existence to them;
to pretend that unity exercises the actual power
of engendering another unity nearly resembling
itself, and of creating two individuals, two sides
of a triangle, that can have no connection or
perfection without a third side, which is neces∣sarily
produced by the other two; in fine, to re∣gard
numbers, geometrical lines, and metaphy∣sical
abstractions, as real and efficient physical
causes, by which the elements are formed, plants
and animals regenerated, and all the phaeno∣mena
of nature produced, appears to be the
greatest and most absurd abuse of human rea∣son,
and an invincible obstacle to the advance∣ment
of knowledge. Besides, nothing can be
more fallacious than such chimeras. Sup∣posing
we should agree with Plato and Mal∣branche,
that matter has no existence, that ex∣ternal
objects are only ideal images of the crea∣tive
power, and that we see every thing in the
Deity himself; does it follow, that our ideas are
of the same order with those of the Creator, and
that they can produce real existences? Are we
not dependent on our sensations? Whether the
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
objects which excite sensations be real or imagi∣nary,
whether they exist without or within, whe∣ther
it be God or matter that we every where
behold, is to us of little importance: We are
not less certain of being uniformly affected in
the same manner by the same causes. The re∣lations
between our senses and the objects which
affect them, are necessary and invariable. It is
upon this basis alone that the principles of phi∣losophy
ought to be founded, otherwise our
knowledge must be useless and fallacious. Can
an harmonic triangle create the substance of the
elements? Is fire, as Plato affirms, an acute tri∣angle,
and light and heat two properties of this
triangle? Are water and air rectangular and e∣quilateral
triangles? Is the form of the element
of earth a square, because, being the least per∣fect
of the four elements, it recedes as far as
possible from a triangle, without departing alto∣gether
from its essence? Do males and females
embrace each other, for no other purpose but to
complete the triangle of generation? These Pla∣tonic
ideas have two different aspects: In spe∣culation,
they seem to proceed from sublime
principles; but the application of them in prac∣tice
leads to nothing but false and childish con∣clusions.</P>
<P>Is it difficult to perceive that our ideas origi∣nate
from our senses alone; that the objects we
regard as real existences, are those concerning
which the senses uniformly give the same testi∣mony;
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
that the objects we apprehend as having
a real existence, are those which are invariably
presented to us in the same manner; that the
mode in which they present themselves has no
dependence upon our will or inclination; that,
of course, our ideas, instead of being the causes
of things, are only particular effects, which be∣come
less similar to the objects themselves, in
proportion as they are rendered more general;
and, lastly, that mental abstractions are only ne∣gative
beings, which derive their intellectual ex∣istence
from the faculty we possess of consider∣ing
objects, without regarding their sensible qua∣lities</P>
<P>Is it not, therefore, apparent, that abstract i∣deas
can never be the principles of existence, or
of real knowledge? On the contrary, all our
knowledge is derived from comparing and ar∣ranging
the results of our sensations. These re∣sults
are known by the appellation of <HI>experience,</HI>
the only source of genuine science. The em∣ployment
of any other principle is an abuse; and
every edifice founded upon abstract ideas, is a
temple erected to Error.</P>
<P>In philosophy, error has a more extensive in∣fluence
than in morals. A thing may be false
in morals solely because it is misrepresented. But
falsehood in metaphysics consists not in misre∣presentation
alone, but in taking for granted what
has no existence at all. It is into this most per∣nicious
species of error that the Platonists and
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
the Sceptics have fallen. Their false suppositions
have obscured the natural light of truth, bewil∣dered
the reasoning faculties of men, and retard∣ed
the progress of philosophy.</P>
<P>Final causes are employed as a second prin∣ciple
by Plato and other theorists. This prin∣ciple
has even been adopted by the vulgar, and
by some modern philosophers. A moment's re∣flection,
however, will be sufficient to reduce
this principle to its proper value. To say that
light exists because we have eyes, and that sounds
exist because we have ears; or to say that we
have eyes and ears, because light and sounds
exist; is not this precisely the same thing? or,
rather, are we any wiser by this kind of reason∣ing?
Will we ever make any discoveries by such
a mode of explication? Is it not apparent, that
final causes are only arbitrary relations and
moral abstractions, which ought to have less in∣fluence
than abstractions in metaphysics, because
the origin of the former is less noble and worse
imagined? And, though Leibnitz has endeavour∣ed
to give an elevation to final causes, under the
appellation of the reasonableness and eternal fit∣ness
of things, [<HI>raison suffisante</HI>], and Plato has
represented them under the flattering picture of
absolute perfection; all these efforts are insuffi∣cient
to cover their native insignificance and
precariousness. Are we better instructed in the
operations of Nature, because we are told that
nothing exists without a reason, or that every
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
thing is created with a view to the perfection of
the whole? What is reasonableness or fitness?
What is perfection? Are they not moral beings,
created solely by the human intellect? Are they
not arbitrary relations which we have contrived
to generalise? They have no foundation but in
moral affinities, which, so far from producing
any physical or real existence, change the nature
of truth, and confound the objects of our sen∣sations,
of our perceptions, and of our under∣standings,
with those of our sentiments, of our
passions, and of our wills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The translator thinks it his duty to apprize the reader, that here, as well as in several other parts of this work, the author makes an ingenious and plausible attack against the existence and utility of final causes. Every philosopher will admit the absurdity of employing a final cause as a physical principle. M. de Buffon, if he meant only to expose the misapplication of final causes, had no occasion to betray so much warmth and anxiety about an object so apparent. But, like too many of our modern French writers, he seems to be ignorant of, or rather intentionally neglects, the distinction between final and physical causes. Final causes regard the design or the utility of particu∣lar objects, whether that utility relates to man, to the objects themselves, or to the general structure of the universe. But physical causes are limited to the explanation of particular ef∣fects, or modes of existence. <HI>Why</HI> were mountains, seas, or in∣sects, created? <HI>What</HI> useful purposes do they serve? For the so∣lution of these, and similar questions, final causes can alone be employed. But if it be asked, <HI>How</HI> were mountains and seas formed? <HI>How</HI> were insects originally produced; and <HI>how</HI> are their different species propagated? These are questions purely physical, and so different in their nature from the former, that nothing but stupidity, or worse motives, could possibly confound them.</P>
<P>It may be farther remarked, that final causes are the greatest stumbling-blocks which lie in the way of atheists and materialists. They, accordingly, strain every nerve to remove them. But their force is so irresistible; their numbers are so immense; their beauties are so striking, and correspond so intimately with the warm and benevolent feelings of the heart; the concatenation and mutual dependence of all created beings recognisable by our senses are so apparent, and so illustrious, that no powers of sophistry, no artful misrepresentations, no strokes of ridicule, will ever be able to diminish their influence, or weaken the force of those sentiments which the Supreme Being intended they should excite in the breasts of his intelligent creatures. Final causes not only demonstrate the existence of a Supreme Intelli∣gent Power, but the infinite beneficence, and minute attention of that Power to the happiness of those beings upon whom He has thought proper to confer existence.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74"/>
Much more might be said upon this subject.
But I pretend not to write a treatise on philo∣sophy;
and shall therefore return to physics,
from which the ideas of Plato, concerning uni∣versal
generation, have diverted my attention.
Aristotle, who was as great a philosopher as
Plato, and a better physician, instead of wan∣dering
in the regions of theory, collects facts,
and speaks in a language more intelligible.</P>
<P>Matter, he remarks, which is only a capacity
of receiving forms, assumes, in generation, a fi∣gure
similar to the individual which furnishes it:
And, with regard to animals which generate by
the intervention of sexes, he imagines, that the
prolific principle proceeds solely from the male<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Aristot. de Gen. lib. 1. cap. 20. and lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>:
For though, in another place, when speaking of
animals in general, he says, that the female
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
sheds a seminal fluid within the body, it appears,
that he regards not this fluid as a prolific prin∣ciple;
and yet he tells us, that the menstrual
blood serves for the formation, nourishment,
and growth of the foetus; but that the efficient
principle exists alone in the seminal fluid of
the male, which acts not as matter, but as a cause.
Averrhoes, Avicenna, and other philosophers who
embraced this opinion of Aristotle, have endea∣voured
to prove that females have no prolific
fluid. They alledge, that, as females are fur∣nished
with a menstrual fluid, which is both
necessary and sufficient for the purposes of ge∣neration,
it is unnatural to suppose them pos∣sessed
of any other, especially since it begins to
appear, like that of the male, at the age of pu∣berty.
Besides, they continue, if females really
have a prolific seminal fluid, why do they not
produce without the intercourse of the male,
since they contain the prolific principle, as well
as the matter necessary for the growth and ex∣pansion
of the embryo? This last reason is the
only one which merits attention. The men∣strual
blood appears to be necessary for the
growth and nourishment of the foetus; but still
it may contribute nothing to its first formation,
which requires the mixture of both prolific
fluids. Females, therefore, like males, may have
a prolific fluid for the formation of the embryo,
as well as menstrual blood for its growth and
nourishment. The imagination is not unnatu∣ral,
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
that, as the female possesses both a prolific
fluid extracted from all parts of her body, and
likewise the means of expanding and nourish∣ing,
she should produce females without any
communication with the male. It must be al∣lowed,
that this metaphysical argument used by
the Aristotelians for proving that females are
destitute of a prolific fluid, may be urged as the
strongest argument against every system of ge∣neration,
and, in particular, against that which
I am endeavouring to establish.</P>
<P>Let us suppose, it may be said, that the super∣fluous
organic particles are sent from every part
of the body into the testicles and seminal vessels
of the male, why do they not, by means of your
imaginary attracting forces, form small organi∣zed
bodies similar to the whole? Why are not
similar bodies generated in the female, without
any intercourse with the male? If you answer,
that the male fluid contains only males, that the
female fluid contains only females, that both pe∣rish
for want of the circumstances necessary for
expansion, and that, for the procreation of an
animal, a mixture of both is requisite; may it
not be demanded, why this most complicated,
difficult, and less fertile mode of generation, is so
invariably preferred by Nature, that all animals,
with a few trifling exceptions, generate by the
mutual commerce of sexes?</P>
<P>I shall content myself, at present, with reply∣ing,
that this is the mode actually employed by
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
Nature; and, therefore, however complicated it
may appear, it is, in fact, the most simple; be∣cause,
as I formerly remarked, whatever most
frequently happens, is, in itself, however it may
seems to us, the most simple.</P>
<P>Besides, the notion of the Aristotelians, that
females have no seminal fluid, cannot receive our
assent, if we consider the strong resemblance of
children to their mothers, and that mules, mu∣lattoes,
and mongrels of every kind, uniformly
resemble the mother more than the father; and,
if it be farther considered, that the generating
organs of the female, like those of the male, are
properly formed for preparing and receiving a
seminal fluid, we shall be easily induced to be∣lieve
the existence of such a fluid, whether it re∣sides
in the spermatic vessels, the testicles, or the
ovaria, or proceeds, by irritation, from the la∣cunae
of De Graaf, which are situated at the neck
and near the orifice of the uterus.</P>
<P>But we must examine Aristotle's ideas more
fully, as, of all the antients, this great philosopher
has treated the subject of generation in the most
extensive manner. He distinguishes animals
into three classes: 1. Those that have blood,
and, with few exceptions, propagate by copula∣tion;
2. Those that have no blood, and, being
hermaphrodites, produce of themselves without
copulation; and, 3. Those that proceed from
putrefaction, and have no parents of any kind.
I shall first remark, that this division is exceed∣ingly
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
improper: Though it be true, that ani∣mals
having blood are distinguished into male
and female, it is by no means equally true, that
bloodless animals are, for the most part, herma∣phrodites:
For the only hermaphrodites we
know, are land-snails and worms; but we are
uncertain whether all shell-animals, and all those
which have no blood, be also hermaphrodites. This
must be learned from the particular histories of
these animals. And, with regard to those that
are alledged to proceed from putrefaction, as Aris∣totle
gives no enumeration of them, many ob∣jections
occur; for most species which the an∣tients
believed to proceed from putrefaction,
have, by the moderns, been discovered to pro∣ceed
from eggs.</P>
<P>Aristotle makes a second division of animals,
namely, into those who have the faculty of pro∣gressive
motion, and those who have no such fa∣culty.
All animals who move, and have blood,
are distinguished by sexes: But those which,
like oysters, adhere to one place, or hardly move
at all, have no sexes, and, in this respect, re∣semble
plants; and it is only, he observes, from
difference in bulk that they have been distin∣guished
into male and female. It must be ac∣knowledged,
that we are still uncertain whether
shell-animals have sexes: Among oysters, some
individuals are fertile, and others not. The fer∣tile
individuals are distinguished by a delicate
edging or border which surround their bodies,
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
and they are called males<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Deslandes dans son traité de la marine. Paris 1747.</NOTE>. Our observations
on this subject are extremely limited.</P>
<P>But to proceed. The male, according to A∣ristotle,
contains the principle of motion, and
the female the material part of generation. The
organs destined for this purpose are different in
different animals. Of these the testicles are the
chief in males, and the uterus in females. Qua∣drupeds,
birds, and cetaceous animals, have tes∣ticles;
fishes and serpents are deprived of them;
but they have two canals for the reception and
maturation of the semen: These parts, so essential
to generation, are always double both in males
and females; and, in the male, they retard the
motion of that part of the blood which goes to
the formation of semen. This he proves from
the example of birds whose testicles swell consi∣derably
during the season of their amours, but
afterwards diminish so greatly that they can
hardly be discovered.</P>
<P>All quadrupeds covered with hair, and the ce∣taceous
fishes, as whales and dolphins, are vivi∣parous:
But vipers and cartilagious animals are
not properly viviparous; because they produce
an egg within their own bodies, previous to the
exclusion of the live animal. Oviparous ani∣mals
are of two kinds; those which produce
perfect eggs, as birds, lizards, turtles, &amp;c.
and those which produce imperfect eggs, as
fishes, whose eggs augment and come to perfec∣tion
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
after they have been deposited in the water
by the female: And, in every species of ovipa∣rous
animals, except birds, the females are larger
than the males, as in fishes, lizards, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After remarking these general varieties in the
animal kingdom, Aristotle begins with exami∣ning
the opinion of the antient philosophers, that
the semen, both of the male and the female, was
extracted from all parts of the body; and he
dissents from this opinion; because, says he,
though children often resemble both father and
mother, they sometimes also resemble their grand∣fathers.
Besides, they resemble their fathers and
mothers in the voice, in the hair, in the nails,
and in the gate and manner of walking. Now,
he proceeds, it is impossible for the semen to
come from the hair, from the voice, from the
nails, or from any external quality, as that of
the mode of walking. Infants, therefore, re∣semble
not their parents, because the semen
proceeds from all parts of the body, but for o∣ther
reasons. I will not expose the weakness of
these arguments; but shall only remark, that this
great man appears to have been anxious to differ
from the sentiments of former philosophers: And
I am persuaded, that, whoever peruses his trea∣tise
on generation, will discover, that a strong
passion for establishing a system different from
that of the antients, obliges him uniformly to
prefer arguments of little probability, to the
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
force of proofs, when they stand in opposition
to the general principles of his philosophy.</P>
<P>The seminal liquor of the male, according to
Aristotle, is secreted from the blood; and the
menstrual fluid of the female is likewise a secre∣tion
from the blood, and the only matter which
contributes to generation. Females, he conti∣nues,
have no other prolific fluid; no mixture,
therefore, of male and female fluid takes place:
This he attempts to prove by observing, that
some women conceive without pleasure; that
few emit any fluid during the time of copula∣tion;
that, in general, those who are brown, and
have a masculine air, have no emission; and yet
their powers of procreation are not less than
those of a fairer complection and more delicate
appearance, who emit copiously. Thus, he
concludes, women furnish nothing for the pur∣poses
of generation, but the menstrual blood.
This blood is the matter of generation, and the
male fluid contributes nothing but the form:
The male fluid is the efficient cause, and the prin∣ciple
of motion; it is to generation what the
sculptor is to a block of marble: The seminal
fluid is the sculptor, the menstrual blood the
marble, and the foetus the figure. The men∣strual
blood receives from the male semen a kind
of soul, which gives it life and motion. This
soul is neither material nor immaterial, because
it can neither act upon matter, nor augment the
menstrual blood, which is the only matter neces∣sary
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
to generation. It is a spirit, says our phi∣losopher,
similar to that of the element of the
stars. The heart is the first production of this
soul, which is the cause of its own growth, and
of the growth and disposition of all the other
members. The menstrual blood contains the
<HI>capacities</HI> of all the parts of the foetus; the soul
or spirit of the male semen makes the heart be∣gin
to <HI>act,</HI> and communicates to it the powers of
bestowing <HI>action</HI> on the other viscera; and, in
this manner, the different parts of the animal are
successively unfolded. All this appears clear and
luminous to our philosopher. He has only one
doubt, namely, whether the blood or the heart
is first realized. And of this he doubted not with∣out
reason; for, though he adopted the opinion
that the heart received its existence first, Harvey
has since alledged, from arguments similar to
those of Aristotle, that the blood, and not the
heart, is first realized.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a short view of what A∣ristotle
has delivered on the subject of genera∣tion,
and shall leave the reader to consider whe∣ther
any system of the antients be more obscure,
or more absurd, than that which he has endea∣voured
to establish. His system, however, has
been adopted by most men of learning. Har∣vey
has borrowed many of Aristotle's notions;
but he has also adopted some of his own, which
are by no means better founded. It is not sur∣prising
that Aristotle's theory of generation,
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
which was a result of his system of philosophy,
where form and matter are the great principles,
where vegetable and sensitive souls are the a∣gents
of nature, and where final causes are real
objects, should have been received in the schools:
But it is not a little astonishing to see a physi∣cian
and an acute observer, like Harvey, carried
down the stream, while, at the same time, most
philosophers followed the sentiments of Hippo∣crates
and Galen, which we shall afterwards
take notice of.</P>
<P>We mean not to convey a disadvantageous
idea of Aristotle by the account we have given
of his theory of generation. We might, with
equal propriety, judge of Descartes by his trea∣tise
on man. What these two philosophers
have remarked concerning the formation of the
foetus should rather be considered in the light
of detached observations, or as consequences
which each of them drew from their principles
of philosophy, than as compleat systems. Aris∣totle
admits, with Plato, final and efficient causes:
The latter are the sensitive and vegetable souls,
that give form to matter, which, in itself, is only
a <HI>capacity</HI> of receiving forms: And as, in ge∣neration,
the female furnishes the greatest quan∣tity
of matter, and as it was repugnant to his
system of final causes, that any effect should be
produced by two causes, when one was sufficient
for the purpose, he concludes, that the woman
alone contains the matter necessary for procrea∣tion:
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
Again, another of his principles was, that
matter, in itself, has no form, and that <HI>form</HI> is
a being distinct from matter; he therefore main∣tains,
that the male furnishes the form, and, of
course, that he contributes nothing <HI>material.</HI></P>
<P>Descartes, on the contrary, admitted into his
philosophy only a few mechanical principles.
By these he attempted to explain the formation
of the foetus; and he imagined, that he under∣stood,
and was able to communicate to others,
the manner in which a living organized body
could be formed by the laws of motion alone.
The principles he employed were different from
those of Aristotle. But both of them, instead
of directing their inquiries to the thing itself, in
place of examining it with impartiality, only
considered it in relation to their philosophic prin∣ciples,
which could never be applied with suc∣cess
to the nature of generation, because it de∣pends,
as has been already shown, upon very
different principles. Descartes, however, admits
the existence and necessary concurrence of the
seminal fluids of both sexes. He allows that both
furnish something material for the purposes of
generation; and that the fermentation occasion∣ed
by a mixture of the two fluids, is the cause of
the formation of the foetus.</P>
<P>Hippocrates, who lived about five or six hun∣dred
years before Aristotle, taught an opinion,
which was adopted by Galen, and by most phy∣sicians,
for many ages. He maintained the ex∣istence
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
of a female fluid; and even that both
male and female had two fluids, the one strong
and active, the other weaker and more inactive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hippocrat. lib. de Genitura, p. 129, et lib. de Diacta. p. 198. Lugd. Bat. tom. 1. 1665.</NOTE>.
A concurrence of the two stronger fluids produ∣ced
a male child, and, of the two weaker, a fe∣male.
Thus, according to Hippocrates, there
exist two kinds of seminal fluids both in the male
and in the female. This notion he supports in
the following manner: Several women, who
produced only girls by their first husband, have
had boys by their second; and the same thing
has often happened to men who have had two
wives. Supposing this to be fact, it admits of
an easy explanation, without having recourse to
two different fluids peculiar to each sex; for the
women who had girls only by the first husband,
and boys by the second, furnished a greater
quantity of particles proper for generation du∣ring
the first, than the second marriage; or the
second husband furnished a greater quantity of
generating particles during the time of the se∣cond
marriage, than the first. If, at the mo∣ment
of conception, the organic particles of the
male are more abundant than those of the fe∣male,
a male child is the result; and, when the
organic particles of the female most abound, a
female child is the consequence: It is not, there∣fore,
surprising, that the husband should be foil∣ed
with some women, and have the superiority
over others.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86"/>
It is farther alledged by Hippocrates, that the
male semen is secreted from the strongest and
most essential fluids of the body; and he thus
explains the manner in which the secretion is
performed: 'Venae et nervi,' says he, 'ab omni
corpore in pudendum vergunt, quibus dum ali∣quantulum
teruntur, et calescunt ac implentur,
velut pruritus incidit, ex hoc toti corpori volup∣tas
ac caliditas accidit; quum vero pudendum
teritur et homo movetur, humidum in corpore
calescit ac dissunditur, et a motu conquassatur ac
spumescit, quemadmodum alii humores omnes
conquassati spumescunt.'</P>
<P>'Sic autem in homine ab humido spumescente
id quod robustissimum est ac pinguissimum secer∣nitur,
et ad medullam spinalem venit; tendunt
enim in hanc ex omni corpore viae, et dissun∣dunt
ex cerebro in lumbos ac in totum corpus
et in medullam: Et ex ipsa medulla procedunt
viae, ut et ad ipsam humidum perferatur et ex
ipsa secedat; postquam autem ad hanc medul∣lam
genitura pervenerit, procedit ad renes, ac
enim via tendit per venas; et si renes fuerint
exulcerati, aliquando etiam sanguis defertur: A
renibus autem transit per medios testes in pu∣dendum,
procedit autem non qua urina, verum
alia ipsi via est illi contigua<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fefius's translation, tom. 1. p. 129.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will, doubtless, be perceived by anatomists,
that Hippocrates errs in tracing the route of the
seminal fluid. But this affects not his hypothesis,
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
that the semen proceeds from every part of the
body, and particularly from the head; because,
he remarks, those who have had the veins be∣hind
their ears cut, secrete only a weak and often
an unfertile semen. The female likewise sheds
a seminal fluid sometimes within the uterus, and
sometimes without, when the orifice is too open.
The male semen enters the uterus and mixes
with that of the female; and, as each has two
species of fluid, the one strong and the other
weak, if both of them furnish the strong kind,
a male foetus is the consequence; and, if both
furnish only the weak kind, the result is a fe∣male:
Besides, if in the mixture there are more
particles of the male than of the female fluid,
the child will resemble the father more than the
mother; <HI>et c contra.</HI> Here we might ask him,
what would happen, when the fluid of the one
was strong, and that of the other weak? I can∣not
conceive what reply could be made to this
question; and, therefore, we are warranted to
reject the opinion of two distinct fluids in each
sex as perfectly chimerical.</P>
<P>Let us now attend to his account of the for∣mation
of the foetus. The seminal fluids first
mix in the uterus, and gradually thicken by the
heat of the mother. The mixture extracts the
spirit of heat, and when too warm, part of the
heat escapes into the air. But a cold spirit is
likewise conveyed to it by the respiration of the
mother: Thus a cold and a hot spirit alternately
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
enter the mixture, give life to it, and cover its
surface with a pellicle, which assumes a round
figure, because the spirits acting in the center,
expand the matter equally on all sides. I have
seen, says this great physician, a foetus of six
days old: It was a ball of liquor inclosed in a
pellicle. The liquor was reddish; and the
pellicle was interspersed with red and colourless
vessels. In the middle of it there was a small e∣minence,
which I apprehended to be the umbi∣lical
vessels, by which the foetus receives nou∣rishment
and the spirit of respiration from the
mother. A second covering or pellicle gradu∣ally
forms above the first. Abundance of nou∣rishment
is furnished by the menstrual blood,
which coagulates by degrees, and is converted
into flesh. This flesh gradually articulates as it
grows; and the spirit bestows this form upon
it. Every part proceeds to take its proper place;
the solid particles unite together; the moist
particles associate by themselves; every thing
searches for what is analogous to it; and, in
fine, the foetus, by these causes and means, is
completely formed.</P>
<P>This system is more rational, and less obscure
than that of Aristotle; because Hippocrates en∣deavours
to explain every particular appearance,
and borrows only one general principle from
the philosophy of his times, namely, that heat
and cold produce spirits, and that these spirits
have the power of arranging and of bestowing
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
figure upon matter. He treats his subject more
like a physician than a philosopher; but Aristotle
explains the phaenomena of generation more as
a metaphysician than a naturalist. It is for this
reason that the errors of Hippocrates are parti∣cular
and less apparent, and that those of Aris∣totle
are general and evident.</P>
<P>These two great men have each had their fol∣lowers.
Almost all the philosophers of the
schools adopted Aristotle's theory of generation,
while most physicians adhered to the theory of
Hippocrates; and, in this manner, 17 or 18 cen∣turies
passed without the appearance of any thing
new upon this mysterious subject.</P>
<P>At last, upon the revival of literature, some a∣natomists
began to investigate the nature of gene∣ration;
and Fabricius ab Aquapendente was the
first who thought of making a course of experi∣ments
upon the impregnation and expansion of
the eggs of fowls, the substance of which we
shall lay before the reader.</P>
<P>He distinguishes the matrix of a hen into
two parts, the one superior, and the other infe∣rior.
The superior part, which he calls the
ovarium, is an assemblage of a great number of
small yellow eggs, of a round figure, the sizes
of which vary from that of a mustard seed to
that of a walnut. These eggs are attached to
one another by foot-stalks, and the whole some∣what
resembles a bunch of grapes. The smallest
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
eggs are white, and they turn yellower in pro∣portion
as they increase.</P>
<P>Having examined those yellow eggs imme∣diately
after a communication with the male, he
could perceive no sensible difference; he saw
none of the male semen in any part of the eggs:
He therefore concluded, that the whole eggs,
and even the ovarium itself, were rendered fer∣tile
by a subtile spirit which issues from the male
semen; and, he adds, that, in order to prevent
the escape of this fecundating spirit, nature has
placed, at the external orifice of the vagina of
birds, a membranous valve which permits the
seminal spirit to enter freely into the vagina,
but prevents its return.</P>
<P>When an egg is detached from the common
pedicle, it gradually descends, through a wind∣ing
canal, into the inferior part of the matrix.
This canal is filled with a liquor very similar to
the white of an egg. It is here that the egg
receives its white liquor, the membrane in which
it is inclosed, the two cords (<HI>chalazae</HI>) that run
through the white, and join it to the yolk, and
the shell which is suddenly formed immediately
before exclusion. These cords, according to
our author, are the part of the egg which is im∣pregnated
by the seminal spirit of the male; and
it is here also that the rudiments of the foetus
first appear. The egg is not only the true ma∣trix,
or the place where the chick is formed, but
the whole business of generation depends upon
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
it. The egg is the great agent in generation;
it furnishes both the matter and the organs.
The substance of the cords is the matter of
which the chick is formed; the white and the
yok afford it nourishment; and the seminal spi∣rit
of the male is the efficient cause. This spirit
communicates to the cords, first, an alterant
quality, then a forming quality, and, lastly, a
power of augmenting, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These observations of Fabricius, it is apparent,
lead not to any clear idea of generation. At the
same time that this anatomist was making his
experiments, which was about the middle of the
sixteenth century, the famous Aldrovandus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Ornithologia.</NOTE>
made some remarks upon eggs. But, as Har∣vey
properly observes of him, he followed more
the authority of Aristotle than of experiment.
The description he gives of the chick in the egg
is by no means exact. Volcher Coiter, one of
his pupils, succeeded better than his master; this
writer, together with Parisanus, a Venetian phy∣sician,
have each given descriptions of the chick
in the egg, which Harvey prefers to all the o∣thers.</P>
<P>This celebrated anatomist, who first discover∣ed
the circulation of the blood, has given an ex∣cellent
treatise on generation. He flourished
about the middle of last century, and was phy∣sician
to Charles I. of England. As he was o∣bliged
to follow this unhappy Prince during his
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
misfortunes, he lost, among other papers, what
he had written concerning the generation of in∣sects;
and it appears, that he composed from
memory his treatise on the generation of birds
and of quadrupeds. I shall give a short view of
his remarks, of his experiments, and of his the∣ory.</P>
<P>Harvey alledges, that men, and all other ani∣mals,
proceed from eggs; that, in viviparous a∣nimals,
the first produce of conception is a kind
of egg; and that the only difference between
the viviparous and oviparous is, that, in the for∣mer,
the foetuses begin to exist, increase, and
acquire their full growth in the uterus; but that,
in the oviparous animals, the foetuses begin to
exist in the body of the mother, where they are
in the form of eggs; and it is only after their
exclusion that they become real foetuses. And
it deserves to be remarked, says he, that, in ovi∣parous
animals, some retain their eggs till they
be perfect, as birds, serpents, and oviparous qua∣drupeds;
and that others exclude their eggs be∣fore
they are perfect, as fishes, crustaceous, and
testaceous animals. The eggs laid by those crea∣tures
are only the rudiments of eggs, which af∣terwards
acquire membranes and a white, and
attract nourishment from the matter with which
they are surrounded. There are even, he adds,
insects, caterpillars, for example, which are only
imperfect eggs; they search for their nourish∣ment,
and, at the end of a certain time, they ar∣rive
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
at the state of a chrysalis, which is a perfect
egg. Another difference may still be remarked
in oviparous animals: The eggs of hens, and
other birds, are of all different sizes; but those
of fishes, frogs, &amp;c. who lay them before they
are perfect, are all of the same size. He indeed
observes, that, in pigeons, who lay two eggs, all
the small eggs that remain in the ovarium are of
the same bulk; and that the two only which are
next to be excluded exceed the size of the rest.
The same thing happens in cartilaginous fishes,
as in the ray, which only brings to maturity two
eggs at a time, all the rest being of different
sizes, like those of the hen.</P>
<P>He next describes anatomically the parts ne∣cessary
to generation; and remarks, that the si∣tuation
of the anus and vulva in birds differ from
those of all other animals, the anus being placed
before, and the vulva behind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Most of these facts are taken from Aristotle.</NOTE>. And, with
regard to the cock, and all small birds, he al∣ledges,
that they have no proper penis, and that
they generate by rubbing, without any intro∣mission.
But male-ducks, geese, and ostriches,
are amply provided with this instrument.</P>
<P>Hens produce eggs without the intervention
of the cock; but, though perfect, they are
fewer in number, and unfertile. He credits
not the common opinion, that a few days inter∣course
with the cock are sufficient to impregnate
all the eggs which a hen will lay during the year;
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
but he acknowledges, that he separated a hen
from the cock for 20 days, and that all the eggs
she laid were fecundated. As long as the egg
remains attached to the ovarium, it is nourished
by the vessels of the common pedicle; but, when
it separates from this pedicle, it receives the
white liquor and the shell from the matter with
which the canal of the uterus is filled.</P>
<P>The two cords (<HI>chalazae</HI>) which Aquapen∣dente
considered to be the germ, or part produ∣ced
by the male semen, are found in unimpreg∣nated,
as well as impregnated eggs; and Harvey
properly observes, that these parts neither pro∣ceed
from the male, nor receive the impregna∣tion.
The part of the egg which receives the
impregnation is a small white circle situated up∣on
the membrane that covers the yolk, and has
the appearance of a cicatrice about the size of a
lentil. Harvey likewise remarks, that this ci∣catrice
is found in all eggs, whether they be fe∣cundated
or not; and that those are deceived who
imagine it to be produced by the seed of the
male. It is of the same size and form in fresh
eggs as in those which have been long kept.
But, as soon as the process of hatching is begun,
whether by means of artificial heat, or by the heat
of the hen, this small mark or cicatrice gradual∣ly
augments and dilates like the pupil of the
eye. This is the first change, and it is visible
after a few hours incubation.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95"/>
When the egg has been heated for 24 hours,
the yolk, which was formerly in the centre,
rises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the cavity at the thick end of the
egg This cavity continues to enlarge by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the more fluid part of the white;
and the heaviest part of the white falls down to
the small end. The cicatrice or speck on the
membrane of the yolk, is elevated along with
it, and applies itself to the membrane which
lines the cavity at the thick end. This speck
is now as large as a pea; and a white point is
distinguishable in the middle of it, with several
circles, of which this point appears to be the
common centre.</P>
<P>At the end of the second day, these circles are
larger and more conspicuous, and they divide the
speck sometimes into two, and sometimes into three
parts, of different colours. A small external pro∣tuberance
likewise appears, which nearly resem∣bles
a little eye, with a white point or cataract
on the pupil. Between the circles a liquor, as
transparent as crystal, is contained by means of
a very thin membrane. The speck, which is
now become a kind of bubble, or liquid globe,
appears as if it were situated in the white, rather
than on the membrane of the yolk. On the third
day the transparent liquor, as well as the mem∣brane
in which it is inclosed, is considerably aug∣mented.
On the 4th, a small line of blood, of
a purple colour, appears on the circumference of
the bubble; and, at a little distance from the
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
centre, we perceive a dot or point, of a bloody
colour, which beats like a heart. It is visible at
every diastole, and disappears during the systole.
From this animated point two small blood-vessels
issue, and terminate in the membrane which con∣tains
the transparent crystalline liquor. These
blood-vessels set off from the same place, nearly
in the same manner as the roots of a tree set off
from the trunk; and it is in the angle which
these roots form with the trunk, and in the mid∣dle
of the liquor, that the animated point is si∣tuated.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the fourth, or beginning
of the fifth day, the animated point is so much
enlarged, that it has the appearance of a small
bladder filled with blood; and, by its contractions
and dilatations, it is alternately filled and emp∣tied.
On the same day we distinctly perceive,
that this bladder is divided into two parts, each of
which dilates and contracts in the same manner.
Round the shortest of the blood-vessels described
above, a kind of cloud appears, which, though
transparent, obscures the view of the vessel. E∣very
hour this cloud becomes thicker; it attach∣es
itself to the root of the blood-vessel, and seems
to depend from it like a small globe. This globe
extends and appears to divide into three parts,
one of which is globular, and larger than the o∣ther
two; and here we perceive the rudiments
of two eyes, and of the whole head: And, at
the end of the fifth day, we see, in the remain∣der
of this lengthened globe, the beginnings of
the vertebrae.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97"/>
On the sixth day, the parts of the head are
more apparent. We distinguish the coats of the
eyes, the thighs, and wings; and then the liver,
the lungs, and the beak. The foetus now begins
to move and to stretch out its head, though no∣thing
but the viscera are yet formed; for the
thorax, the abdomen, and all the external co∣verings
of the fore part of the body, are still
wanting. At the end of this day, or the begin∣ning
of the seventh, the claws begin to be vi∣sible;
the chick opens and moves its beak; and
the anterior parts of the body begin to cover the
viscera. On the seventh day, the chick is en∣tirely
formed; and, from this time till it issues
from the egg, nothing happens but an expansion
of all the parts it acquired during the first seven
days. The feathers appear on the 14th or 15th
day; and, on the 21st, it escapes from the egg,
by breaking the shell with its bill.</P>
<P>These experiments of Harvey appear to have
been made with the greatest exactness and fide∣lity.
In the sequel, however, we shall demon∣strate
their imperfection, and that the author has
probably fallen into the common error of ma∣king
experiments, with a view to establish his fa∣vourite
hypothesis, that the first animated point
which appeared was the heart. But, before pro∣ceeding
to this object, it is proper to give an ac∣count
of his other experiments.</P>
<P>Every body knows the many experiments of
Harvey made upon female deer. They receive
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
the male about the middle of September. A
few days after copulation, the <HI>horns</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two fleshy processes, one of which issues from each side of the <HI>fundus uteri,</HI> in the form of little <HI>horns,</HI> and are remarkable in some quadrupeds.</NOTE> of the ute∣rus
appear to be thicker and more fleshy than
usual: They are, at the same time, more lax and
flabby; and, in each of their cavities, five ca∣runculae,
or soft warts, appear. About the 26th
or 28th of September, the uterus is still thicker;
the five carunculae are swelled nearly to the size
and form of a nurse's nipple. On opening them
with a scalpel, they appeared to be filled with an
infinite number of white points. Harvey pre∣tends
to have remarked, that, neither now, nor
immediately after copulation, had the ovarium
suffered any change; and that he never could
discover, after repeated trials, the least drop of
male semen in the uterus.</P>
<P>Towards the end of October, or the beginning
of November, when the females were separated
from the males, the thickness of the <HI>horns</HI> began
to diminish; the internal surfaces of their cavi∣ties
were swelled, and seemed to be glued toge∣ther.
The carunculae still remained; and the
whole resembled the substance of the brain, be∣ing
so soft that it could not be touched. Har∣vey
tells us, that on the 13th or 14th of Novem∣ber,
he perceived filaments, like those of a spi∣der's
web, which traversed the cavities of the
<HI>horns,</HI> and even that of the uterus itself. These
filaments arose from the superior angle of the
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
<HI>horns,</HI> and, by their number, formed a kind of
membrane or empty coat. A day or two after∣wards,
this coat or sac was filled with a white,
aqueous, viscid matter, and adhered to the ute∣rus
by means of a species of mucilage; and the
adhesion was most sensible at the superior part of
the uterus, where the rudiments of the placenta
began then to appear. In the third month, this
sac contained an embryo of two fingers breadth
in length, and also an internal sac, called the
amnios, inclosing a transparent crystalline liquor,
in which the foetus swam. The foetus, at
first, was only an animated point, like what ap∣peared
in the hen's egg. Every thing now pro∣ceeded
and terminated in the same manner as
described with regard to the chick, with this on∣ly
difference, that the eyes of the chick appear∣ed
much sooner than those of the deer. The a∣nimated
point was visible about the 19th or 20th
of November. A day or two afterwards, the
oblong body, which contained the rudiments of
the foetus, made its appearance. In six or seven
days more, the foetus was so compleatly formed,
that all its members, and even its sex, were di∣stinguishable.
But the heart and viscera were
still bare; and it was not till a day or two after,
that they were covered with the abdomen and
thorax. This is the last work, the slating of the
edifice.</P>
<P>From these experiments upon hens and deer,
Harvey concludes, that all female animals have
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
eggs; that in these eggs a separation of a transpa∣rent
crystalline liquor, contained in a sac (<HI>amnios</HI>),
takes place, and that another external sac (<HI>chorion</HI>)
incloses the whole liquors of the egg; that the
first thing which appears in the crystalline li∣quor
is an animated sanguineous point; and, fi∣nally,
that the formation of viviparous animals
is effected in the same manner with that of the
oviparous: The following is the account which
he gives of the generation of both.</P>
<P>Generation, he observes, is an operation of the
uterus alone; for not a drop of the male semen
ever enters it. The uterus conceives by a kind
of contagion, communicated to it by the semen
of the male, nearly in the same manner as the
load-stone communicates a magnetic virtue to
iron. This male contagion acts not only on the
uterus, but on the whole body of the female,
which is entirely fecundated, though the uterus
alone possesses the faculty of conception, in the
same manner as the brain has the sole power of
conceiving ideas. The ideas conceived by the
brain are similar to the images of the objects
transmitted to it by the senses; and the foetus,
which may be regarded as the idea of the uterus,
is similar to that which produces it. This is the
reason why children resemble their fathers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I will follow the system of our anatomist no
farther: What has been said is sufficient to en∣able
the reader to judge of it. But we have re∣marks
of importance to make concerning his
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
experiments. He has represented them in a
manner the most plausible and insinuating. He
appears to have often repeated them, and to have
taken every necessary precaution to avoid fallacy
and deception; and, of course, we are led to
think that he has seen every thing which possi∣bly
could be discovered. Uncertainty and ob∣scurity,
however, are perceptible in his descrip∣tions.
His observations are related from memo∣ry;
and he seems, though he often maintains
the contrary, to have made Aristotle, more than
experience, his guide; for he has seen every
thing in eggs, and very little more, than was
mentioned by that philosopher. That the most
material of his observations were made long be∣fore
his own time, we shall be convinced by at∣tending
to what follows.</P>
<P>Aristotle knew, that the cords (chalazae) in
eggs were of no use in the generation of the
chick: 'Quae ad principium lutei grandines
haerent, nil conferunt ad generationem, ut qui∣dam
suspicantur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Anim. lib. 6. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.' Parisanus, Volcher Coiter,
Aquapendente, &amp;c. had remarked the small ci∣catrice,
as well as Harvey. Aquapendente be∣lieved
it to be of no use; but Parisanus main∣tained
that it was formed by the male semen,
or, at least, that the white point in the middle
of the cicatrice was the semen of the male, and
that it was the rudiments of the foetus, 'Estque,'
says he, 'illud galli semen alba et tenuissima tu∣nica
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
abductum, quod substat duabus communi∣bus
toti ovo membranis,' &amp;c. Hence the only
discovery proper to Harvey is his having re∣marked
the existence of this cicatrice, both in
fecundated and unfecundated eggs; for the o∣ther
writers had observed, as well as he, the di∣latation
of the circles, and the growth of the
white point. These are all the remarks Harvey
has made in his account of the two first days of
incubation; what he mentions concerning the
third day is only a repetition of what Aristotle
delivers in the sixth book and fourth chapter of
his history of animals: 'Per id tempus ascendit
jam vitellus ad superiorem partem ovi acutio∣rem,
ubi et principium ovi est et foetus exclu∣ditur;
corque ipsum apparet in albumine san∣guinei
puncti, quod punctum salit et movet se∣se
instar quasi animatum; ab eo meatus vena∣rum
specie duo, sanguine pleni, flexuosi, qui,
crescente foetu, feruntur in utramque tunicam
ambientem, ac membrana sanguineas fibras ha∣bens
eo tempore albumen continet sub meati∣bus
illis venarum similibus; ac paulo post dis∣cernitur
corpus pusillum initio, omnino et can∣didum,
capite conspicuo, atque in eo oculis
maxime turgidis qui diu sic permanent, sero e∣nim
parvi siunt ac considunt. In parte autem
corporis inferiore nullum extat membrum per
initia, quod respondeat superioribus. Meatus
autem illi qui a corde prodeunt, alter ad cir∣cumdantem
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
cumdantem membranam tendit, alter ad lute∣um,
officio umbilici.'</P>
<P>Harvey, because Aristotle says that the yolk
rises to the small end of the egg, concludes that
he had seen nothing himself, but had received
his information from some other pretty accurate
observer. In this accusation, Harvey evidently
injures Aristotle; for the rising of the yolk to
either end, solely depends upon its position du∣ring
the time of incubation; for the yolk, being
lighter than the white, uniformly mounts to the
top, whether the large or the small end of the
egg be uppermost. This observation we owe to
William Langley, a physician in Dordrecht, who
made experiments on the hatching of eggs in the
year 1655, about 20 years before Harvey's
time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Langly observ. editae a Justo Schradero, Amst. 1674.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, to return to the passage we have quoted.
It is apparent, that the crystalline liquor, the
animated point, the two circles, the two blood-vessels,
&amp;c. are described by Aristotle in the same
manner as they were seen by Harvey. This
anatomist maintains, that the animated point is
the heart, that the heart is the first part of the
foetus which is formed, and that the viscera and
other members succeed. All this has been men∣tioned
by Aristotle, and seen by Harvey; and
yet it is by no means consonant to truth. To be
assured of this fact, we have only to repeat the
same experiments, or to read with attention those
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
of Malpighius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malpighii pullus in ovo.</NOTE>, which were made about 50
years after the trials of Harvey.</P>
<P>Malpighius carefully examined the cicatrice,
which is the essential part of the egg; he found
that it was large in impregnated eggs, and small
in those which had received no impregnation;
and he discovered, that, in eggs which had ne∣ver
been sit upon, the white point, mentioned by
Harvey as the first part that becomes animated,
is a small purse or bubble swimming in the li∣quor
bounded by the first circle; and that the
embryo is visible in the centre of this purse.
The membrane of the purse, which is the am∣nios,
being exceedingly thin and transparent,
allowed him to see distinctly the foetus within
it. Malpighius, from this first observation, con∣cludes
with propriety, that the foetus exists in
the egg before incubation, and that the rudi∣ments
of the embryo are even then deeply rooted.
It is unnecessary to mention how much this ex∣periment
differs from the opinion of Harvey;
for he had observed nothing begun to be formed
during the two first days of incubation; and, in
his estimation, the first vestige of a foetus is the
animated point, which appears not till the third
day. But Malpighius discovered that the rudi∣ments
of the whole foetus exist before incuba∣tion
is commenced.</P>
<P>After ascertaining this important fact, Mal∣pighius
proceeded to examine the cicatrice of
unimpregnated eggs, which, as formerly re∣marked,
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
is smaller than in those that have received
an impregnation. Its margin is often irregular,
and its texture sometimes differs in different eggs.
Near its centre, in place of a bubble including
the foetus, there is a globular mole or unorgani∣zed
mass, which, when opened, presents nothing
like regularity or arrangement of parts: It has
only some appendages filled with a thick but
transparent liquor; and this unformed mass is
surrounded and enveloped in several concentric
circles.</P>
<P>After six hours incubation, the cicatrice is con∣siderably
enlarged; and, in its centre, a bubble
or globule formed by the amnios is easily di∣stinguishable.
This globule is filled with a fluid,
in the middle of which the head and back-bone
of the chick visibly appear. Six hours after
this, every thing is enlarged, and, of course,
more apparent to the eye. In six hours more,
that is, 18 hours after the commencement of in∣cubation,
the head is larger, and the spine is
lengthened; and, at the end of 24 hours, the
head of the chick appears in a bended posture,
and the spine is of a whitish colour. The ver∣tebrae
are ranged on each side of the spine, like
small globules; and, nearly at the same time,
the wings begin to sprout, and the head, neck,
and breast, are lengthened. At the end of 30
hours, nothing new appears; but all the parts
are enlarged, and especially the amnios. Round
this membrane, may be remarked the umbilical
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
vessels, which are of a dark colour. In 38 hours,
the chick has acquired more strength; its head
is very large, and three vesicles appear in it sur∣rounded
with membranes, which likewise in∣clude
the spine of the back, through which,
however, the vertebrae are still visible. At the
end of 40 hours, it was admirable to observe,
continues our author, the chick living in the
centre of the liquor of the amnios. The back-bone
was increased, the head was bended, the
vesicles of the brain were less bare, the rudi∣ments
of the eyes appeared, the heart beat, and
the blood circulated. Here Malpighius describes
vessels and the circulation of the blood; and he
thought, with reason, that, though the heart did
not beat till 38 or 40 hours after incubation was
begun, it nevertheless existed before, as well as
the other parts of the chick. But, on exami∣ning
the heart in a dark chamber, he observed
nothing like luminous sparks issuing from it, as
Harvey seems to insinuate.</P>
<P>At the end of the second day, the foetus ap∣peared
swimming in the liquor of the amnios;
the head, which seemed to be composed of ve∣sicles,
was bended; the back-bone and verte∣brae
were lengthened; the heart, which hung
out of the breast, beat three times successively,
because the fluid it contains is pushed from the
auricle into the ventricles, from the ventricles
into the arteries, and, lastly, into the umbilical
vessels. He remarks, that, having separated the
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
chick from the white of the egg, the motion of
the heart continued for a whole day. In 14
hours more, or 62 hours from the beginning of
the incubation, the chick, though stronger, re∣mained
still with its head bended in the liquor
of the amnios: Veins and arteries were perceived
among the vessels of the brain; and the linea∣ments
of the eyes, and of the spinal marrow, ap∣peared.
At the end of three days, the body of the
chick was crooked. Beside the two eyes, five
vesicles filled with liquor appeared in the head;
the rudiments of the thighs and of the wings
were discernible; the body began to take on
flesh; and the pupils of the eyes, and likewise
the crystalline and vitreous humours, were dis∣tinguishable.
At the termination of the fourth
day, the vesicles of the brain were nearer each
other; the processes of the vertebrae were long∣er;
the wings and the thighs had become strong∣er,
in proportion as they grew longer; the whole
body was covered with an unctuous flesh; the
umbilical vessels had pierced through the abdo∣men;
and the heart was concealed within the
breast, which was now shut up by a thin mem∣brane.
On the fifth, and at the end of the sixth
day, the vesicles of the brain began to be covered;
the spinal marrow, which was now more solid,
was divided into two parts, and advanced along
the trunk; the thighs and wings were longer,
and the wings were unfolded; the abdomen was
shut and tumified; the liver was distinctly visible,
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
and of a dark colour; the two ventricles of the
heart beat; the body of the chick was covered
with skin; and the points of the feathers began
to appear. On the seventh day, the head was
very large; the brain was covered with its mem∣branes;
the beak appeared between the two
eyes; the wings, the thighs, and the legs, had
acquired their perfect form; the heart seemed
to be composed of two ventricles, like two con∣tiguous
globules, united at their superior part
with the auricles; and two successive pulses were
remarked both in the ventricles and auricles, as
if there had been two separate hearts.</P>
<P>But I will follow Malpighius no farther. The
remainder of the detail regards the growth and
perfection of the parts till the chick breaks the
shell in which it is inclosed, and becomes an in∣habitant
of a new world. The heart is the last
part that assumes its proper figure, by the union
of its ventricles, which happens not till the e∣leventh
day.</P>
<P>We are now in a condition to form a distinct
judgment concerning the value of Harvey's ex∣periments.
It is probable that this celebrated
anatomist did not make use of the microscope,
(which was, indeed, very imperfectly known in
his days), otherwise he never would have affirm∣ed,
that there was no difference between the
cicatrice of impregnated and unimpregnated
eggs; he never would have said, that the semen
of the male produced no change upon the egg,
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
and particularly upon the cicatrice; he never
would have advanced, that nothing was percep∣tible
before the end of the third day; that the
animated point appeared first; and that the white
point was transformed into the animated point:
He would have perceived that the white point
was the bubble or globule which contained the
whole apparatus of generation; and that all the
rudiments of the foetus commenced there from
the moment of receiving the impregnation of
the cock: He would likewise have discovered,
that, without this impregnation, it contains no∣thing
but an unformed mass, which could never
become animated; because, in fact, it is not
organized like an animal, and because it is only
after this mass, which ought to be regarded as a
collection of the organic particles of the female
semen, is penetrated by the organic particles of
the male semen, that an animal is formed. This
formation is instantaneous; but the motions of
the new animal are imperceptible till 40 hours
after the process of incubation has commenced:
He would not have assured us, that the heart is
first formed, and that the other parts are succes∣sively
joined to it by juxta-position; since it is
apparent, from the experiments of Malpighius,
that the rudiments of all the parts are formed at
once, but that they become perceptible only in
proportion as they are successively unfolded:
Lastly, if he had seen, as Malpighius saw, he
would not have positively asserted, that no im∣pression
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
of the male seed remained in the eggs,
and that it was only by contagion that they
were impregnated, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is also proper to remark, that what Harvey
has said concerning the parts of generation of
the cock is by no means exact. He affirms,
that the cock has no penis capable of entering
the vagina of the hen. It is certain, however,
that this animal, in place of one penis, has a
couple, which both act at the same time; and
this action is a vigorous compression, if not an
actual copulation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Regn. Graaf, p. 242.</NOTE>. It is by this double organ
that the cock throws his seminal liquor into the
uterus of the hen.</P>
<P>Let us now compare Harvey's experiments
upon female deer with those of de Graaf upon
female rabbits; and, though de Graaf believed,
as Harvey did, that all animals proceed from
eggs, we shall find a very great difference in the
manner in which these two anatomists have per∣ceived
the first formation, or rather the expan∣sion,
of the foetuses of viviparous animals.</P>
<P>After exerting every effort to prove, by ar∣guments
drawn from comparative anatomy, that
the testicles of viviparous females are true ova∣ria,
Graaf explains the manner in which the
eggs are detached from the ovaria, and fall into
the <HI>horns</HI> of the uterus; and then he relates the
remarks he made upon a rabbit which he dis∣sected
half an hour after copulation. The horns
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
of the uterus, he says, were uncommonly red;
there was no change either in the ovaria, or in
the eggs which they contained; and there was
not the least appearance of semen in the vagina,
in the uterus, or in the <HI>Fallopian tubes.</HI></P>
<P>Having dissected another rabbit, six hours af∣ter
copulation, he observed, that the follicles, or
coats, which, in his estimation, contain the eggs
in the ovarium, were become red; but he found
no male semen either in the ovaria or any where
else. Twenty hours after copulation, he dissect∣ed
a third; he remarked in one ovarium three,
and in the other five follicles much altered; for
instead of being clear and limpid, they were
become opaque and reddish. In another, dis∣sected
twenty-seven hours after copulation, the
horns of the uterus, and the superior canals
which terminate in them, were still more red,
and their extremities embraced the ovarium on
all sides. In another, which was opened forty
hours after copulation, he found in one ovarium
seven, and in the other three follicles changed.
Fifty-two hours after copulation, he examined
another, and found in one ovarium four changed
follicles, and one in the other; and having open∣ed
these follicles, he discovered in them a kind
of glandular liquor, with a small cavity in the
middle, where he could perceive no fluid, which
made him suspect that the transparent liquor
usually contained in the follicles, and which, he
says, is inclosed in its own membranes, might
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
have been discharged by some kind of rupture.
He searched for this matter in the canals which
terminate in the horns of the uterus, and in the
horns themselves; but he found nothing. He
only remarked, that the membranes which line
the horns of the uterus were much swelled. In
another rabbit, dissected three days after copu∣lation,
he observed, that the superior extremity
of the canal, which terminates in the horns of
the uterus, straitly embraced the ovarium on
every side: And, having separated it from the
ovarium, he remarked, in the right ovarium,
three follicles somewhat larger and harder than
usual. After searching with great care the ca∣nals
above mentioned, he discovered, he says, an
egg in the right canal, and two more in the
right horn of the uterus, so small that they ex∣ceeded
not mustard seeds. These little eggs
had each two membranes, and the internal one
was filled with a very limpid liquor. Having
examined the other ovarium, he found four
changed follicles; three of them were whiter,
and had likewise some limpid liquor in their
centres; but the fourth was of a darker colour,
and contained no liquor, which made him sus∣pect
that the egg had escaped from it. He there∣fore
searched the corresponding canal and horn
of the uterus; he found an egg in the superior
extremity of the horn, which was exactly simi∣lar
to those he had discovered in the right horn.
He alledges, that the eggs, when they are sepa∣rated
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
from the ovarium, are ten times less than
before their separation; and this difference in
size, he imagines, is owing to the eggs, while in
the ovarium, containing another matter, namely,
the glandulous liquor which he remarked in the
follicles.</P>
<P>Four days after copulation, he opened another
rabbit, and he found in one ovarium four, and
in the other three follicles void of eggs: In the
horns corresponding to the ovaria, he found four
eggs on one side, and three in the other. These
eggs were larger than those he had discovered
three days after copulation. They were nearly
of the size of the lead-shot used for shooting
small birds; and he remarked, that, in these
eggs, the interior membrane was separated from
the exterior, and appeared as if a second egg
was contained within the first. In another, dis∣sected
five days after copulation, he found five
empty follicles in the ovaria, and an equal num∣ber
of eggs in the uterus, to which they adhe∣red
very firmly. These eggs were as large as
the shot employed for killing hares, and the in∣ternal
membrane was still more apparent than
in the last experiment. Having opened another
rabbit, six days after copulation, he found in
one of the ovaria six empty follicles, but only
five eggs in the corresponding horn of the ute∣rus,
and they seemed to be all accumulated into
one mass: In the other ovarium, he saw four
empty follicles, and found but one egg in the
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
corresponding horn. These eggs were of the
size of the largest fowling shot. Seven days af∣ter
copulation, our anatomist opened another
rabbit, and he found in the ovaria some empty
follicles, which were larger, harder, and more
red than those he had formerly observed; and
he perceived as many transparent tumors in dif∣ferent
parts of the uterus; and, having opened
them, he took out the eggs, which were as large
as small <HI>pistol</HI> bullets. The internal membrane
was more distinct than formerly; and within this
membrane he saw nothing but a very clear li∣quor.
In another, dissected eight days after co∣pulation,
he found in the uterus the tumors or
cells which contain the egg; but they adhered
so strongly to the uterus, that he could not de∣tach
them. In another, which he opened nine
days after copulation, he found the cells con∣taining
the eggs greatly enlarged, and he per∣ceived
in the middle of the liquor inclosed by
the internal membrane a small thin cloud. In
another, which he opened ten days after copu∣lation,
the small cloud was thicker and darker,
and formed an oblong body like a little worm.
Lastly, twelve days after copulation, he distinctly
perceived the embryo, which, though two days
before, it was only an oblong body, was now so
apparent, that he could distinguish its different
members. In the region of the breast, he saw
two red and two white points, and, in the ab∣domen,
a mucilaginous reddish substance. Four∣teen
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
days after copulation, the head of the foe∣tus
was large and transparent; the eyes were
prominent; the mouth was open; the rudi∣ments
of the ears appeared; the back-bone was
whitish, and bended towards the sternum, and
small blood-vessels arose from each side of it,
the ramifications of which extended along the
back as far as the legs: The two red points
were considerably enlarged, and appeared like
the rudiments of the ventricles of the heart; on
each side of the red points he saw two white
ones, which were the rudiments of the lungs.
In the abdomen he saw the rudiments of the li∣ver,
which was reddish, and a small body twisted
like a thread, which was the stomach and inte∣stines.
After this, till the 31st day, when the
female rabbit brings forth, there was nothing to
be remarked but the gradual expansion and
growth of the parts which were already formed.</P>
<P>From these experiments, De Graaf concludes,
that all viviparous females have eggs; that these
eggs are contained in the ovaria or testicles;
that they cannot be separated till they are fecun∣dated
by the semen of the male; because, says
he, the glandular liquor, by means of which the
eggs are enabled to escape from their follicles,
is not secreted till after an impregnation by the
male. He alledges, that those who imagine they
have seen pretty large eggs in three days, have been
deceived; because, in his opinion, the eggs, though
fecundated, remain longer in the ovarium, and,
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
in place of augmenting, they become ten times
less than formerly, and they never begin to
grow till after their descent from the ovaria in∣to
the uterus.</P>
<P>By comparing these observations of Graaf
with those of Harvey, we will easily perceive
that the latter has missed the principal facts:
And, though there are several errors both in the
reasoning and in the experiments of De Graaf,
this anatomist, as well as Malpighius, have dis∣covered
themselves to be better observers than
Harvey. They agree in all fundamental points,
and both of them contradict Harvey. He per∣ceived
not the alterations which take place in the
ovaria; he saw not in the uterus those small
globules which contain the materials of genera∣tion,
and which are called eggs by De Graaf;
he never suspected that the foetus existed in this
egg; and, though his experiments give us tole∣rably
exact ideas concerning what happens du∣ring
the growth of the foetus, he furnishes no
information concerning the commencement of
fecundation, nor concerning the first expansion
of the foetus. Schrader, a Dutch physician,
who had a great veneration for Harvey, acknow∣ledges
that he cannot be trusted in many articles,
and particularly in what relates to the first for∣mation
of the embryo; for the chick really ex∣ists
in the egg before incubation; and, he says,
that Joseph of Aromatarius was the first who
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
made this material observation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Obs. Justi Schraderi, Amst. 1674.</NOTE>. Besides, though
Harvey alledged that all animals proceeded from
eggs, he never imagined that the testicles of fe∣males
contained eggs; and it was only from a
comparison between the sac, which he believed
to be formed in the uterus of viviparous ani∣mals,
with the growth and covering of the eggs
in oviparous animals, that he maintained that all
animals were produced from eggs; and even
this is only a repetition of what Aristotle had
said before him. Steno was the first who pre∣tended
to have discovered eggs in the ovaria of
females. He says, that, in dissecting a female
sea-dog, he perceived eggs in the testicles, though
this animal be viviparous; and he adds, that the
testicles of women are analogous to the ovaria
of oviparous animals, whether the eggs them∣selves
fall into the uterus, or only the matter
which they contain. Steno was the first who
discovered these supposed eggs; De Graaf is
willing to assume the discovery to himself; and
Swammerdam warmly disputes the point with
him, and alledges that Van-Horn had seen them
before De Graaf. This last writer, it is true,
has been accused of asserting many things which
have been contradicted by experiments: He
even pretended, that a certain judgment might
be formed of the number of foetuses in the ute∣rus,
by the number of cicatrices or empty fol∣licles
in the ovaria. In this he is contradicted
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
by the experiments of Verrheyen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. chap. 3. edit. De Bruxelles, 1710.</NOTE>, by those of
M. Mery<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'acad. 1701.</NOTE>, and by some of his own, where he
found fewer eggs in the uterus, than cicatrices
in the ovaria. Besides, we shall demonstrate that
what he says concerning the separation of the
eggs, and the manner in which they descend
into the uterus, is by no means exact; that no
eggs exist in the testicles of females; that what
is seen in the uterus is not an egg; and that the
systems which have been deduced from the ob∣servations
of this celebrated anatomist are per∣fectly
chimerical.</P>
<P>This pretended discovery of eggs in the testi∣cles
of females attracted the attention of most
anatomists. They only found, however, in the
testicles of viviparous females, small bladders;
those they hesitated not to consider as real eggs,
and, therefore, they called the testicles <HI>ovaria,</HI>
and the vesicles <HI>eggs.</HI> They asserted also, like
De Graaf, that these eggs differed in size in the
same ovarium; that the largest in the ovaria of
women exceeded not the bulk of a small pea;
that they are very small in young girls; but that
they increased with age and intercourse with
men; that not above 20 could be reckoned in
each ovarium; that these eggs are fecundated
in the ovarium by the spirituous part of the
male semen; that they then separate and fall
into the uterus by the Fallopian tubes, where the
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
foetus is formed of the internal substance of the
egg, and the placenta of its external part; that
the glandulous matter, which exists not in the
ovarium till after a fruitful embrace, compresses
the egg, and excludes it from the ovarium, &amp;c.
But, though Malpighius, who examined mat∣ters
more accurately, detected many errors com∣mitted
by those anatomists even before they were
received; yet most physicians adopted the o∣pinion
of De Graaf, without regarding the ob∣servations
of Malpighius, which were neverthe∣less
of the greatest importance, and which re∣ceived
much weight from the experiments of his
disciple Valisnieri.</P>
<P>Malpighius and Valisnieri, of all naturalists,
appear to have written with most judgment and
acuteness on the subject of generation. We
shall, therefore, give an account of their experi∣ments
and remarks.</P>
<P>Malpighius, having examined the testicles of
a number of cows and other female animals,
assures us, that he found, in the testicles of all
of them, vesicles of different sizes, whether the
females were very young or adults. These ve∣sicles
are enveloped in a pretty thick membrane,
the inside of which is interspersed with blood-vessels;
and they are filled with a kind of lymph
or liquor, which coagulates and hardens by the
heat of a fire, like the white of an egg.</P>
<P>In process of time, a firm yellow body ad∣heres
to the testicles. It is prominent, and in∣creases
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
to the size of a cherry, and occupies the
greatest part of the ovarium. This body con∣sists
of several angular lobes, the position of
which is very irregular, and it is covered with a
coat or membrane interspersed with nerves and
blood-vessels. The form and appearance of this
yellow body varies considerably at different
times. When it exceeds not the size of a grain
of millet, it is roundish, and its substance, when
cut, has a warty appearance. We often find an
external covering round the vesicles of the o∣varia,
which consists of the same substance with
the yellow bodies.</P>
<P>When the yellow body has become nearly of
the size of a pea, it resembles a pear; and, in the
centre of it, there is a small cavity filled with
liquor. The same thing may be remarked when
it is as large as a cherry. In some of these
yellow bodies, after they have arrived at full
maturity, Malpighius affirms that he saw, to∣wards
the centre, a small egg with its appen∣dages,
about the size of a millet seed; and, after
they had discharged these eggs, they were flaccid
and empty. They then resembled a cavernous
canal; and the void cavities were as large as
peas. He conceived that Nature designed this
yellow glandular body for the preservation of
the egg, and for making it escape from the te∣sticles;
and that, perhaps, it contributed to the
formation of the egg; consequently, he remarks,
the vesicles which are at all times found in the
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
ovarium, and always differ in size, are not the
true eggs which receive the impregnation, but
only serve to produce the yellow bodies in which
the eggs are formed. Besides, though these yel∣low
bodies are not always found in every ova∣rium;
yet we always find the rudiments of
them. Malpighius found the marks of them in
new born heifers, in cows with calf, and in preg∣nant
women; and, therefore, he properly con∣cludes,
that these yellow glandular bodies are
not, as De Graaf asserts, an effect of impregna∣tion.
The yellow bodies, he remarks, produce
unfecundated eggs, which fall out of the ova∣rium
independent of any communication with
the male, and also those which fall after impreg∣nation.
When the impregnated eggs fall into
the uterus, every thing proceeds in the manner
described by De Graaf.</P>
<P>These observations of Malpighius demonstrate,
that the testicles of females are not real ovaria;
that the vesicles they contain are not eggs; that
these vesicles never fall into the uterus; and that
the testicles, like those of males, are only reser∣voirs
containing a liquor which may be regarded
as female semen in an imperfect state. This se∣men
is matured in the yellow glandular bodies,
of which it fills the internal cavities, and flows
out after the yellow bodies have acquired their
full size.</P>
<P>But, before we form a judgment concerning
this important point, we must attend to the re∣marks
of Valisnieri.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="122"/>
In the year 1692, Valisnieri began his expe∣riments
upon the testicles of the sow. The te∣sticles
of the sow differ from those of cows, of
mares, of sheep, of she-asses, of female-dogs,
of she-goats, of women, and of most viviparous
animals; for they resemble a small bunch of
raisins, the grains of which are round and pro∣minent
on the outside; between these grains are
smaller ones, not yet arrived at maturity. These
grains appear not to be covered with a common
membrane. They are, says he, analogous to
the yellow bodies observed in cows by Malpi∣ghius;
they are round, and of a reddish colour;
their surface is interspersed with blood-vessels,
like the eggs of viviparous animals; and the
whole grains together form a mass that is larger
than the ovarium. With a little address, these
grains may be separated from the ovarium, and
each of them, after separation, leaves a nitch or
depression.</P>
<P>These glandular bodies are not of the same
colour in every sow. In some they are more
red; in others more clear; and they are of all
sizes, from the smallest seed, to that of a raisin.
On opening them, a triangular cavity appears,
filed with a limpid liquor, which coagulates
with heat, and becomes white, like that which
is contained in the vesicles. Valisnieri expected
to find the egg in some of these cavities: But in
this he was disappointed; though he made a
careful search into all the glandular bodies of a
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
number of sows, and other animals, he could
never discover the egg, which Malpighius af∣firms
he found once or twice.</P>
<P>Under these glandular bodies, the vesicles of
the ovarium appeared. They were more or less
numerous, according as the glandular bodies
were larger or smaller; for, in proportion to the
largeness of the glandular bodies, the vesicles
diminished. Some vesicles were of the size of a
lentil, and others exceeded not that of a millet
seed. In the testicles, when raw, from 20 to
35 vesicles might be reckoned; but, when boiled,
a much greater number appear, and they are so
firmly attached, that they cannot be separated
without breaking some of them.</P>
<P>Having examined the testicles of a young sow,
which had never brought forth, he found, as in
the others, the glandular bodies; and their tri∣angular
cavities were likewise filled with lymph;
but he could not discover any eggs either in the
one or the other. The vesicles of this young
sow were more numerous than in those which had
brought forth, or those which were impregnated
at the time of examination. In the testicles of
another sow, which was far advanced in preg∣nancy,
Valisnieri found two of the largest glan∣dular
bodies, which were flaccid and empty, and
others, of a lesser size, in their ordinary state;
and, in several others which he dissected when
with young, he remarked, that the number of
glandular bodies was always greater than the
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
number of foetuses. This confirms what we
observed concerning the experiments of De Graaf,
and proves that they are by no means exact.
What he calls follicles of the ovarium are only
the glandular bodies, the number of which al∣ways
exceeds that of the foetuses. In the ova∣ria
of a sow, two or three months old, the tes∣ticles
were pretty large, and interspersed with
vesicles of a considerable size. Among the ve∣sicles,
the beginnings of four glandular bodies
appeared in one testicle, and of seven in the
other.</P>
<P>After these experiments upon sows, Valisnieri
repeats those of Malpighius upon cows, and he
found them to be exactly conformable to truth.
He indeed acknowledges, that he was never
able to discover the egg which Malpighius ima∣gined
he had seen once or twice in the interior
cavity of the glandular bodies. After a fruitless
search in the testicles of so many different fe∣males,
it was natural to think, that Valisnieri
would at least have doubted the existence of such
eggs. But prejudice in favour of system made
him admit, contrary to his own experience, the
existence of eggs, which neither he nor any
other man ever saw, or will see.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, impossible to make a greater
number, or more exact experiments, than Valis∣nieri
has done. Among other animals, he ex∣amined
the ewe, and found, that she has never
any more glandular bodies in her testicles than
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
foetuses in the uterus. In young ewes, which
were never impregnated, there is but one glan∣dular
body in each testicle, and, when one is
emptied, it is succeeded by another; if a ewe
has one foetus in the uterus, she has only one
glandular body in her testicles; and if she has
two foetuses, she has likewise two glandular bo∣dies.
This glandular body occupies the greatest
part of the testicle; and, after it is emptied and
disappears, another begins to grow for the pur∣pose
of a future generation.</P>
<P>In the testicles of a she-ass, he found vesicles
as large as small cherries, which is an evident
proof that they are not eggs, as it would be im∣possible
for them to pass, by the Fallopian tubes,
into the uterus.</P>
<P>The testicles of female wolves, dogs, and
foxes, are covered with a membrane, like a purse,
which is an expansion of that which surrounds
the <HI>horns</HI> of the uterus. In a bitch which began
to be in season, but had not been approached by
the male, Valisnieri found the internal part of
this purse, which does not adhere to the testicle,
moistened with a liquor that resembled whey,
and two glandular bodies in the right testicle,
about two lines in diameter, and which occu∣pied
nearly the whole extent of the testicle.
Each glandular body had a small nipple, with a
distinct fissure, from which, without pressing it,
there issued a liquor like clear whey; he there∣fore
concluded, that this liquor was the same
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
which he found in the purse. He blew into this
fissure with a pipe, and the whole glandular
body immediatly swelled; and, having introdu∣ced
a bristle, he easily penetrated to the bottom
of it. He opened the body on that side where
he had introduced the bristle, and found an in∣ternal
cavity which communicated with the
nipple, and contained a considerable quantity of
liquor. Valisnieri was always in hopes of dis∣covering
the egg; but these hopes, notwithstand∣ing
all his researches, were uniformly frustrated.
He likewise found, in the left testicle, two glan∣dular
bodies very similar to those in the right.
He boiled two of these glandular bodies, hoping,
that, by this means, he might discover the egg,
but still without any measure of success.</P>
<P>Having dissected another bitch four or five
days after she had received the male, he found
in the testicles three glandular bodies exactly
similar to the former. He searched every where
for the egg; but he was still disappointed. By
the assistance of the microscope, he discovered
the glandular bodies to be a net-work composed
of an infinite number of globular vesicles, which
served to filtre the liquor which issued through
the nipple.</P>
<P>He then opend another bitch which was not
in season, and having tried to introduce air be∣tween
the testicle and the purse which covered
it, he found that it dilated like a bladder filled
with air. Having removed the purse, he disco∣vered
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
two glandular bodies upon the testicles;
but they had neither nipple nor fissure, and no
liquor distilled from them.</P>
<P>In another bitch that had brought forth about
five whelps two months before, he found five
glandular bodies; but they were much diminish∣ed
in size, and they began to disappear without
leaving any cicatrices; there remained only a
small cavity in their centre; but it contained no
liquor.</P>
<P>Not satisfied with these and many other ex∣periments,
Valisnieri, who passionately desired
to discover this pretended egg, called together
the best anatomists his country afforded, and, a∣mong
others, M. Morgagni; and, having open∣ed
a young bitch that was for the first time in
season, and that had been covered three days be∣fore,
they examined the vesicles of the testicles,
the glandular bodies with their nipples, their ca∣nals,
and the liquor in their internal cavities;
but they could perceive no eggs. He then, with
the same intention, made experiments on she-goats,
foxes, cats, a number of mice, &amp;c. In
the testicles of all these animals, he uniformly
found the vesicles, and frequently the glandular
bodies with the liquor they contained; but no
egg ever appeared.</P>
<P>In fine, being desirous of examining the te∣sticles
of women, he had an opportunity of o∣pening
a young country-woman, who had been
some years married, and who was killed by a
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
fall from a tree. Though of a robust and vigo∣rous
constitution, she had never born any chil∣dren.
He endeavoured to discover if the cause
of her barrenness existed in the testicles; and
he found that the vesicles were all filled with a
blackish and corrupted matter.</P>
<P>In a young girl of eighteen years of age, who
had been brought up in a convent, and who had
every appearance of real virginity, he found the
right testicle a little longer than the left: It was
of an oval figure, and its surface was somewhat
unequal. This inequality was occasioned by five
or six vesicles which protruded on the outside of
the testicle. One of these vesicles, which was more
prominent than the rest, he opened, and a quan∣tity
of lymph rushed out of it. This vesicle was
surrounded with a glandular substance, in the
shape of a crescent, and of a reddish yellow co∣lour.
He cut the testicle transversely, and found
a number of vesicles filled with limpid liquor;
and he remarked, that the Fallopian tube of this
testicle was redder and somewhat longer than the
other, as he had often observed in other animals
when they were in season.</P>
<P>The left testicle was whiter, and its furface
more smooth; for, though some vesicles were a
little prominent, none of them were in the form
of nipples; they were all similar to each other,
and the corresponding Fallopian tube was nei∣ther
swelled nor red.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129"/>
In the testicles of a girl, aged five years, he
found the testicles with their vesicles, their blood-vessels,
and their nerves.</P>
<P>In the testicles of a woman of sixty years, he
discovered some vesicles, and the vestiges of a
glandular substance, like large points of an ob∣scure
yellowish brown colour.</P>
<P>From all these observations, Valisnieri con∣cludes,
that the work of generation is carried on
in the female testicles, which he continued to re∣gard
as ovaria, though he never could find any
eggs in them, and though, on the contrary, he
had discovered that the vesicles were not eggs.
He says, likewise, that, for the impregnation of
the egg, it is not necessary that the male semen
should enter the uterus. He supposes, that the
egg escapes through the nipple of the glandular
body, after being impregnated in the ovarium;
that it then falls into the Fallopian tube; that it
gradually descends, and at last attaches itself to
the uterus: He adds, that he is fully persuaded,
that the egg is concealed in the cavity of the
glandular body, though neither he nor any other
anatomist was ever able to discover it.</P>
<P>In his estimation, the spirit of the male seed
ascends into the ovarium, penetrates the egg,
and gives motion to the foetus which previously
existed in it. In the ovarium of the original
mother of mankind, he observes, were eggs,
which contained not only all the children she
produced, but of the whole human race. If
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
this chain of infinite individuals contained in
one, be incomprehensible to us, it is entirely
owing to the imbecillity of our minds, of which
we have daily proofs. But it is not, therefore,
less consonant to truth, that all the animals which
have existed, or can exist, were created at once,
and were all included in their first mothers. The
resemblance of children to their parents is owing,
he continues, to the imagination, which acts so
forcibly on the foetus as to produce stains, mon∣strosities,
disorder of parts, and extraordinary
concretions, as well as perfect similarities.</P>
<P>This system of eggs, though it explains no∣thing,
and has no foundation in Nature, would
have obtained the universal suffrages of physi∣cians,
if, nearly about the same time, another
opinion had not sprung up, founded upon the
discovery of spermatic animals.</P>
<P>This discovery, which we owe to Leeuwen∣hoek
and Hartsoeker, was confirmed by Andri,
Valisnieri, Bourguet, and many other observers.
I shall relate what has been advanced concern∣ing
those spermatic animals which are found in
the semen of all males. Their number is so
great, that the semen seems to be entirely com∣posed
of them; and Leeuwenhoek pretends to
have seen many millions of them in a drop less
than the smallest grain of sand. Though none
of them appear in females, they are found in the
emitted semen of all males, in the testicles, and
in the vesiculae seminales. When the semen of
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
a man is exposed to a moderate heat, it thickens,
and the motion of all the animalcules is sud∣denly
stopped. But, when allowed to cool,
it dilutes, and the animals continue in motion
till the liquor again thickens by evaporating.
The more this fluid is diluted, the number of
animalcules are augmented; and, when greatly
diluted by the addition of water to it, the whole
substance of the fluid seems to be composed of
animals When the motion of the animalcules
is about to cease, either on account of heat or of
drying, they appear to approach nearer each
other, to have a common circular motion in the
centre of the small drop under observation, and
to perish, all of them, at the same instant. But,
when the quantity of liquor is greater, it is easy
to distinguish them dying in succession.</P>
<P>These animalcules are said to be of different
figures in different animals; but they are all
long, thin, without any members, and move
with rapidity in every direction. The fluid in
which they are contained, as formerly remark∣ed,
is much heavier than blood. The semen of
a bull, when chemically analyzed by Verrheyen,
yielded first phlegm, then a considerable quan∣tity
of foetid oil, a very small proportion of vo∣latile
salt, and more earth than he expected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Verrheyen sup. anat. tom. 2. p. 69.</NOTE>.
This author was surprised that he could draw no
spirit from the distillation of this liquor; and,
as he imagined it contained a great quantity of
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
spirits, he attributed the evaporation of them to
their subtility. But may we not suppose, with
more probability, that it contains little or no
spirits? Neither the consistence, nor the odor of
this fluid, indicate the presence of ardent spirits,
which never abound but in fermented liquors;
and, with regard to volatile spirits, the horns,
bones, and solid parts of animals, afford more of
them than the fluids. What has received the
appellation of seminal spirits, <HI>aura seminalis,</HI> a∣mong
anatomists, has, perhaps, no existence;
and it is certain, that the moving bodies appa∣rent
in the seminal fluid, are not agitated by these
spirits. But, that we may be enabled to pro∣nounce
more clearly concerning the nature of
the semen, and of its animalcules, we shall pre∣sent
the reader with the principal observations
which have been made on the subject.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek, having examined the semen
of a cock, perceived a number of animals similar
to river eels; but they were so minute, that 50,000
of them were not equal in bulk to a grain of
sand. Of those in the semen of a rat, it re∣quired,
he says, many millions to make the
thickness of a hair, &amp;c. This excellent obser∣ver
was persuaded, that the whole substance of
the semen was only a mass of animalcules. He
saw these animalcules in the semen of men, of
quadrupeds, of birds, of fishes, and of insects.
In the semen of a grass-hopper, the animalcules
were long, and extremely thin. They appeared,
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
he says, to be attached by their superior end;
and the other end, which he calls their tail, had
a brisk motion, like that of the tail of a serpent
when its head is fixed. In the semen of young
animals, when examined before they have any
sexual appetite, he alledges that he saw the same
minute animals, and that they had no motion:
But, when the season of love arrived, the ani∣malcules
moved with great vivacity.</P>
<P>In the semen of a male frog, he saw animal∣cules;
but, at first, they were imperfect, and
had no motion: Some time after, he found them
alive. They were so minute, he observes, that
ten thousand of them were only equal in bulk
to a single egg of the female.</P>
<P>In the semen of a man and that of a dog, he
pretended to see two species of animalcules, re∣sembling
males and females. Having shut up
the semen of the dog in a small vial, he says,
that a great number of animalcules died the first
day; that, on the second and third day, still
more of them died; and that few of them were
alive on the fourth day. But, having repeated
this experiment on the semen of the same dog,
he found, at the end of seven days, the animal∣cules
as brisk and lively as if they had been
newly extracted from the animal: And, having
opened a bitch that, some time before the expe∣riment,
had been three times covered by the same
dog he could not perceive, with his naked eye,
any male semen in the uterus or its appendages;
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
but, by the assistance of the microscope, he found
the spermatic animals of the dog in both <HI>horns</HI>
of the uterus: In that part of the uterus which
is nearest the vagina, he discovered great num∣bers,
which evidently proves, says he, that the
male semen enters the uterus, or, at least, that
the spermatic animals of the dog had arrived
their by their own motion, which enables them
to pass over 4 or 5 inches in half an hour. In
the uterus of a female rabbit, which had just re∣ceived
the male, he observed an infinite number
of spermatic animals. He remarks, that the bo∣dies
of these animals are round; that they have
long tails; and that they often change their fi∣gure,
especially when the fluid in which they
swim begins to dry up.</P>
<P>These experiments of Leeuwenhoek were re∣peated
by several people, who found them ex∣actly
consonant to truth. But Dalenpatius, and
some others, who were inclined to exceed Leeu∣wenhoek
in acuteness of vision, alledged that,
in the semen of a man, they not only found a∣nimals
resembling tadpoles, whose bodies ap∣peared
to be as large as a grain of corn, with
tails about four times as long as their trunks,
and who moved with great agility; but, what
is still more amazing, Dalenpatius saw one of
these animals break through its coat or covering:
It was then no more an animalcule, but a real
human body, in which he easily distinguished
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
the two arms and legs, the breast and the head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See nouvelles de la republic des lettres, ann. 1699, p. 552.</NOTE>.
But it is apparent, from the very figures, given
by this author, of the embryo which he pretend∣ed
to have seen escape from its covering, that
the fact is absolutely false. He believed that
he saw what he describes; but he was deceived;
for this embryo, according to his description, was
more completely formed, at the time of its trans∣migration
from the condition of a spermatic
worm, than it is in the uterus of the mother at
the end of the fourth or fifth week. Hence
this observation of Dalenpatius, instead of being
confirmed by future experiments, has been re∣jected
by all naturalists, the most acute of whom
have only been able to discover in the seminal
fluid of man, round or oblong bodies, which ap∣pear
to have long tails, but no members of any
kind.</P>
<P>One would be tempted to think that Plato had
been acquainted with those spermatic animals
which are transformed into men; for, at the
end of his Timacus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 1088, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ficini.</NOTE>, he says, 'Vulva quoque
matrixque in foeminis eadem ratione animal
avidum generandi, quando procul a foetu per
aetatis fiorem, aut ultra diutius detinetur, aegre
fert moram ac plurimum indignatur, passimque
per corpus oberrans, meatus spiritus intercludit,
respirare non sinit, extremis vexat angustiis,
morbis denique omnibus premit, quousque u∣trorumque
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
cupido amorque quasi ex arboribus
foetum fructumve producunt, ipsum deinde de∣cerpunt,
et in matricem velut agrum inspar∣gunt:
Hinc animalia primum talia, ut nec prop∣ter
parvitatem videantur, necdum appareant
formata, concipiunt; mox quae conflaverant,
explicant, ingentia intus enutriunt, demum e∣ducunt
in lucem, animaliumque generationem
perficiunt.' Hippocrates, in his treatise <HI>De
Diaeta,</HI> seems likewise to insinuate that the se∣men
of animals is full of animalcules. Demo∣critus
talks of certain worms which assume the
human figure; and Aristotle tells us, that the
first men issued from the earth in the form of
worms. But neither the authority of Plato, of
Aristotle, of Hippocrates, of Democritus, nor of
Dalenpatius, will ever be able to bestow credi∣bility
on a notion which is repugnant to the re∣peated
experience and observation of all those
who have hitherto made inquiries into this sub∣ject.</P>
<P>Valisnieri and Bourguet perceived small
worms in the semen of a rabbit: One of their
extremities was longer than the other; they were
very active in their motions, and beat the fluid
with their tails: Sometimes they raised them∣selves
to the top of the liquor, and sometimes
sunk to the bottom; at other times they turned
round, and twisted like serpents: In fine, says
Valisnieri, I clearly perceived them to be real
animals: 'E gli riconobbi, e gli giudicai senza
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
dubitamento alcuno per veri, verissimi, arcive∣rissimi
vermi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See opere del. Cav. Valisnieri, tom. 2. p. 105.</NOTE>.' This author, though preju∣diced
in favour of the ovular system, admitted
the actual existence of spermatic animals.</P>
<P>M. Andry pretends, that he could find no a∣nimals
in human semen previous to the age of
puberty; that they exist not in the semen of
very old men; that there are few of them in
those who are affected with the venerial disease,
and that these few are in a languishing state;
that none of them appear alive in impotent per∣sons;
and that the animalcules in the semen of
men have a larger head than those of other a∣nimals,
which corresponds, he observes, with
the figure of the foetus and infant; and he adds,
that those who use women too frequently have
generally few or no animalcules in their semen.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek, Andry, and others, exerted e∣very
effort against the egg-system: They disco∣vered
in the semen of all males living animal∣cules;
they proved that these animalcules could
not be regarded simply as inhabitants of this
fluid, since the quantity of them was larger than
that of the fluid itself; and since nothing simi∣lar
to them existed either in the blood, or in any
other of the animal fluids: They maintained,
that, as females furnished no animalcules, their
fecundity was solely derived from the males;
that the existence of living animals in the se∣men
throw more light upon the nature of gene∣ration
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
than all the former discoveries on this
subject; because the greatest difficulty in genera∣tion
is to conceive how life is first produced, the
future expansion and growth of the parts being
only accessory operations; and, consequently,
that not a doubt remained of these animalcules
being destined to become men, or perfect ani∣mals,
according to their species. When the im∣probability
was objected to them, that millions
of animalcules, all equally capable of becoming
men, should be employed for this purpose, while
only one of them was to enjoy the singular ad∣vantage
of being admitted into the condition of
humanity; when it was demanded of them,
why this useless profusion of human germs?
they replied, That it corresponded with the u∣sual
magnificence of Nature; that, in plants and
trees, millions of seeds were produced, while only
a few of them succeeded; and that, therefore,
we ought not to be surprised at the prodigious
number of spermatic animals. When the ex∣treme
minuteness of a spermatic worm, com∣pared
with the body of a man, was mentioned
to them as a difficulty, they answered, that the
seeds of trees, of the elm, for example, were e∣qually
minute, when compared with the perfect
individuals; and they added, with equal pro∣priety,
metaphysical arguments, by which they
proved, that largeness and minuteness were only
relations, and that the transition from small to
great, or from great to small, was performed by
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
Nature with greater facility than we could pos∣sibly
imagine.</P>
<P>Besides, they asked, are there not fre∣quent
examples of the transformation of in∣sects?
Do we not daily see small aquatic worms,
by simply throwing off their skin or covering,
from which they received their external figure,
transformed into winged animals? May not
spermatic animalcules, by a similar transforma∣tion,
become perfect animals? Every thing,
therefore, they conclude, concurs in establishing
this system of generation, and in overturning
that which is founded on the notion of eggs;
and, though eggs really existed in viviparous
animals, as well as in the oviparous, these eggs
would only be the matter necessary for the
growth and expansion of the spermatic worm,
which enters by the pedicle that attaches the
egg to the ovarium, where it finds abundance of
nourishment prepared for it. All the worms
which are so unfortunate as to miss this passage
through the pedicle into the egg, perish, and that
one alone which finds the proper road, is trans∣formed
into a perfect animal. The difficulty of
finding this passage is sufficient to account for
the great number and apparent profusion of the
spermatic animals. It is a million to one against
any individual worm's finding this passage; but,
to compensate this difficulty, there are more than
a million of worms. When a worm has once
got possession of an egg, no other can enter into
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
it; because, say they, the first worm shuts up the
passage; or rather, there is a valve at the entry
to the pedicle, which plays while the egg is not
perfectly full; but, when the worm has filled
the egg, this valve will not open, though push∣ed
by a second worm. Besides, this valve is
exceedingly well contrived; for, if the worm
should chance to descend through the passage by
which it entered, the valve prevents its escape,
and obliges it to remain till it be transformed.
The spermatic worm then becomes a real foetus;
and it is nourished by the substance of the egg,
and the membranes serve it for a covering; and,
when the nourishment contained in the egg be∣gins
to fail, the foetus attaches itself to the in∣ternal
surface of the uterus, and, by this means,
extracts nourishment from the blood of the mo∣ther,
till, by its weight, and the increase of its
strength, it at last breaks off all connection with
the uterus, and issues into the world.</P>
<P>According to this system, it was not the first
woman, but the first man, who contained all
mankind in his own body. The pre-existent
germs are no longer inanimate embryos locked
up in eggs, and included, <HI>in infinitum,</HI> within each
other. They are, on the contrary, small ani∣mals,
or organized living <HI>homunculi,</HI> included in
each other in endless succession, and which, to
render them men, or perfect animals, require
nothing but expansion, and a transformation si∣milar
to that of winged insects.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141"/>
As physicians are at present divided between
the system of spermatic worms, and that of eggs,
and, as every new writer upon generation has
adopted either the one or the other of these hy∣pothesis,
it is necessary to examine them with care,
and to show not only their insufficiency to ex∣plain
the phaenomena of generation, but that
they rest upon suppositions which are entirely
destitute of probability.</P>
<P>Both systems suppose an infinite progression,
which, as formerly remarked, is a mere illusion
of the brain. A spermatic worm is more than
a thousand million of times smaller than a man.
If, then, the body of a man be taken as an unit,
the body of a spermatic worm will be expressed
by the fraction 1/1000000000, <HI>i. e.</HI> by a number
consisting of ten cyphers; and, as man is to a
spermatic worm of the first generation in the
same proportion as this worm is to a worm of
the second generation, the size of this last sper∣matic
worm will be expressed by a number con∣sisting
of 19 cyphers; for the same reason, the
size of a spermatic worm of the third generation
must be expressed by a number consisting of 28
cyphers, that of the fourth generation by 37
cyphers, that of the fifth generation by 46 cy∣phers,
and that of the sixth generation by 55
cyphers. To form an idea of the minuteness
represented by this fraction, let us take the di∣mensions
of the sphere of the universe from the
Sun to Saturn; and, supposing the Sun to be a
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
million of times larger than the Earth, and di∣stant
from Saturn a thousand solar diameters,
we shall find that 45 cyphers are sufficient to
express the number of cubic lines contained in
this sphere; and, if we reduce each cubic line
into a thousand million of atoms, no more than
54 cyphers will be necessary to express their
number: Of course, a man will be proportional∣ly
greater, when compared with a spermatic
worm of the sixth generation, than the sphere
of the universe when compared to the smallest
atom that can be seen with the assistance of a
microscope. But, if this calculation were carried
on to the 16th generation, the minuteness would
exceed all powers of expression. It is apparent,
therefore, that the probability of this hypothesis
vanishes in proportion as the object dininishes.
This calculation applies equally to eggs as to
spermatic worms; and the want of probability
is common to both. It will, no doubt, be ob∣jected,
that, as matter is infinitely divisible, this
gradual diminution of size is not impossible.
To this I reply, that all infinities, whether in
geometry or in arithmetic, are only mental ab∣stractions,
and have no actual existence in Na∣ture.
If the infinite divisibility of matter is to
be regarded as an absolute infinite, it is easy to
demonstrate, that, in this sense, it has no ex∣istence;
for, if we once suppose the smallest pos∣sible
atom, by the very supposition, this atom
must be indivisible; because, if it were divisible,
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
it would not be the smallest possible atom, which
is contrary to the supposition. It is, therefore,
apparent, that every hypothesis which admits
an infinite progression ought to be rejected not
only as false, but as destitute of every vestige
of probability; and, as both the vermicular and
ovular systems suppose such a progression, they
should be excluded for ever from philosophy.</P>
<P>These systems are liable to another objection:
In the ovular system, the first woman contain∣ed
both male and female eggs; the male eggs
could only give origin to males; but the female
eggs behoved to contain millions of generations
of both males and females: Hence every wo∣man
must have always contained a certain num∣ber
of eggs capable of being unfolded <HI>in infini∣tum,</HI>
and another number, which could only be
unfolded once, and could have no farther ope∣ration
in the series of existence. The same
thing must take place in the vermicular system.
Hence we may conclude, that there is not the
smallest degree of probability in hypotheses of
this nature.</P>
<P>A third difficulty still remains, arising from
the resemblance of children sometimes to the
father, sometimes to the mother, and sometimes
to both, and from the evident characters of spe∣cific
differences in mules and other monstrous
productions. If the foetus proceeds from the
spermatic worm of the father, how comes the
child to resemble its mother? If the foetus pre∣exists
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
in the egg of the mother, how should the
child resemble its father? And, if the spermatic
worm of a horse, or the egg of a she-ass, be the
origin of the foetus, how should the mule par∣take
of the nature and figure both of the horse
and ass?</P>
<P>These general objections, though perfectly
invincible, are not the only difficulties with
which these systems are embarrassed. May it
not be demanded of those who embrace the ver∣micular
system, how these worms are trans∣formed,
and wherein consists the analogy be∣tween
this transformation and that which insects
undergo? The caterpillar which is to become a
butterfly, passes through a middle state, and, after
it ceases to be a chrysalis, is completely formed,
has acquired its full growth, and is instantly
capable of generating: But, in the pretended
transformation of the spermatic worm of a man,
there is no middle or chrysalis state; and, sup∣posing
this to happen during the first days of
conception, why is not the production of this
chrysalis, in place of an unformed embryo, a
perfect adult? Here all analogy ceases; and, of
course, the notion of the transformation of the
spermatic worm can receive no support from this
quarter.</P>
<P>Besides, the worm which is to be transformed
into a flie proceeds from an egg; this egg is
produced by the copulation of the male and fe∣male,
and it includes the foetus which is to pass
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
into a chrysalis, before it arrives at the perfect
state of a flie, and before it acquires the power
of generating. But the spermatic worm has no
generative faculty; neither does it proceed from
an egg: And, though it should be supposed that
the semen contains eggs which produce the sper∣matic
animals, the same difficulty still remains;
for these supposed eggs are not a result of the
copulation of two sexes, like those of insects. Con∣sequently,
the analogy fails here likewise; and
the transformation of insects, in place of strength∣ening
this hypothesis, seems entirely to destroy
it.</P>
<P>The seeds of vegetables are resorted to, in or∣der
to account for the infinite number of sper∣matic
animals: But this analogy does not ap∣ply;
for, all the spermatic animals, one only ex∣cepted,
must absolutely perish. The seeds of
vegetables, however, are not subject to the same
necessity. When they become not vegetables
themselves, they nourish other organized bodies,
and serve the purposes of growth and of repro∣duction
to animals. But the prodigious super∣fluity
of spermatic animals can answer no end
whatever. I make this remark, purely because
I wish to omit nothing that has been advanced
on the subject; for I acknowledge, that no ar∣gument
drawn from final causes can either
establish or destroy a physical theory.</P>
<P>The apparent equality in the number of sper∣matic
animalcules in all animals, has also been
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
objected to by the supporters of this doctrine.
If these animalcules are the immediate cause of
generation, why is there no proportion between
their numbers and those of the young, which
are various in men, quadrupeds, birds, fishes,
and insects? Besides, there is no proportional
difference in most species of spermatic animals,
those of a rat being nearly equal in size to those
of a man. Even when a difference in size takes
place, it has no proportion to the bulks of the
animals. The spermatic animals of the calmar,
which is a small fish, are a hundred thousand
times larger than those of a man or of a dog.
This is an additional proof that these worms
are not the sole and immediate cause of genera∣tion.</P>
<P>The particular objections to the ovular system
are not less weighty. If the foetus existed in
the egg before the junction of the male and
female, why do we not see the foetus in the egg
before impregnation, as clearly as after it? We
formerly mentioned, that Malpighius always
found the foetus in eggs which had received the
impregnation of the male, and could discover
nothing but an unformed mole or mass in the
cicatrice of unimpregnated eggs. It is, there∣fore,
evident, that the foetus is never formed till
the egg has been impregnated.</P>
<P>Farther, we not only cannot discover the foe∣tus
in eggs before the intercourse of the sexes,
but we have not been able to demonstrate the
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
existence of eggs in viviparous animals. Those
physicians who pretend that the spermatic worm
is the foetus inclosed in a coat or covering, are
at least ascertained of the existence of spermatic
worms; but those who maintain that the foetus
pre-exists in the egg, have no evidence of the
existence of the egg itself; for the probability of
their non-existence in viviparous animals a∣mounts
almost to a certainty.</P>
<P>Though the partizans of the ovular system
agree nto as to what ought to be regarded as the
real egg in the testicles of females, they all allow,
however, that impregnation is accomplished in
the testicles or ovarium. But they never con∣sider,
that, if this were the case, most foetuses
would be found in the abdomen in place of the
uterus; for, as the superior extremity of the
Fallopian tube is unconnected with the ovarium,
the pretended eggs would often fall into the ab∣domen.
Now, we know this to be at least a
very rare phaenomenon; and it is probable that
it never happens but by means of some violent
accident.</P>
<P>These objections and difficulties have not e∣scaped
the ingenious author of <HI>Venus Physique.</HI>
But, as his work is in the hands of the public,
and as it admits not of abridgement, we shall
refer the reader to the book itself; and shall
conclude with an account of a few particular
experiments, some of which appeared to favour
and others to contradict the above systems.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148"/>
In the history of the Academy of sciences,
ann. 1701, some objections are proposed by M.
Mery against the egg-system. This able anato∣mist
maintained, with propriety, that the vesicles
found in the testicles of females are not eggs;
that they adhere so firmly to the internal surface
of the testicle, as not to admit of a natural sepa∣ration;
and that, though they could separate
from the substance of the testicle, it was impos∣sible
for them to get out of it, because the tex∣ture
of the common membrane inclosing the
whole testicle is so firm and strong, that it is im∣practicable
to conceive the possibility of its being
pierced by a vesicle or round soft egg. And,
as most anatomists and physicians were prepos∣sessed
in favour of the egg-system, and imagined
that the number of cicatrices in the testicles cor∣responded
with the number of foetuses, M. Mery
showed such a quantity of these cicatrices in the
testicles of a woman, as, upon the supposition of
the truth of this system, would have argued a
fecundity beyond the power of credibility.
These difficulties stimulated other anatomists of
the academy, who were partizans of the eggs,
to make new researches. M. Duverney ex∣amined
the testicles of cows and sheep, and
maintained, that the vesicles were eggs, because
some of them adhered less firmly to the testicles
than others; and that it was natural to suppose
that they separated altogether when they arrived
at full maturity; especially as by blowing into
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
the cavity of the testicle, the air passed between
the vesicles and the adjacent parts. M. Mery
simply replied, that this proof was insufficient,
as these vesicles were never seen separate from
the testicles. M. Duverney farther remarked
the glandular bodies upon the testicles; but he
never considered them as parts essential to ge∣neration,
but as accidental excrescences, like
gall-nuts on the oak. M. Littre, whose preju∣dices
in favour of eggs were still stronger,
maintained, not only that the vesicles were eggs,
but even assured us, that he discovered in one of
them a well formed foetus, of which he could
distinguish both the head and trunk; and he has
even given their dimensions. But, admitting
this wonder, which never appeared to any eyes
excepting his own, to be convinced of the doubt∣fulness
of the fact, we have only to peruse his
memoir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Année 1701, p. 111.</NOTE>. From his own description it appears,
that the uterus was schirrous, and the testicle
very much corrupted; that the vesicle or egg,
which contained the pretended foetus, was much
less than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nuck furnishes us with a celebrated experi∣ment
in favour of eggs. He opened a bitch three
days after copulation; he drew out one of the
<HI>horns</HI> of the uterus, and tied it in the middle so
as to prevent the superior part of the Fallopian
tube from having any communication with the
inferior part. After this he replaced the <HI>horn</HI> of
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
the uterus, and closed the wound. Twenty-four
days afterwards, he again opened the
wound, and found two foetuses in the superior
part of the tube, that is, between the testicles and
the ligature; and there was no foetus in the un∣der
part. In the other horn of the uterus, that
was not tied, he found three foetuses regularly
disposed; which proves, says he, that the foetus
proceeds not from the male-semen, but that it
exists in the egg of the female. Supposing this
experiment, which is single, had been often re∣peated
with the same success, the conclusion the
author draws from it is not legitimate: It proves
no more than that the foetus may be formed in
the superior part of the horn of the uterus, as
well as in the inferior; and it is natural to think
that, by the pressure of the ligature, the seminal
liquor in the inferior part was forced out, and,
of course, frustrated the work of generation in
that region of the uterus.</P>
<P>This is all the length that anatomists and phy∣sicians
have proceeded in the subject of genera∣tion.
It only remains that I deliver the results
of my own experiments and inquiries; and I
shall leave the reader to judge whether my sy∣stem
be not infinitely more consonant to nature
than any of those of which I have given an ac∣count.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Experiments on Generation.</HEAD>
<P>I Often reflected on the above two systems of
generation, and was daily more and more
convinced that my theory was infinitely more
probable. At length I began to suspect that these
living organic particles, from which I thought all
animals and vegetables derived their origin,
might be recognized, by the assistance of good
glasses. My first notion was, that the spermatic
animalcules found in the seminal fluid of all
males, might probably be these very organic
particles; and I reasoned in this manner. If all
animals and vegetables contain an infinite num∣ber
of organic particles, these particles should be
most abundant in their seeds, because the seed is
an extract from all the organic parts, and espe∣cially
from those which are most analogous to the
individual: Perhaps the spermatic animals found
in the semen of males may actually be those very
organic particles, or at least, the first union or
assemblages of them. But, if this be the case,
then the semen of females ought to contain or∣ganic
living particles, or animalcules, similar to
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
those of the male. They ought, for the same
reason, to be found in the seeds of plants, in the
nectarium, and in the stamina, which are the most
essential parts of vegetables, and contain the or∣ganic
particles necessary for their reproduction.
I therefore determined to examine with the
microscope the seminal liquors of males and fe∣males,
and the germs of plants; and, at the same
time, I imagined that the cavities of the glandu∣lar
bodies of the uterus might be the reservoirs
of the female semen. Having communicated
my ideas of this subject to my ingenious friends
Mr Needham, M. Daubenton, M. Gueneau, and
M. Dalibard, they encouraged me to commence
a set of experiments in order to throw light up∣on
this mysterious operation of nature. All of
these gentlemen occasionally attended and assisted
me; but particularly M. Daubenton, who was
never absent, and who was witness to every ex∣periment
I made.</P>
<P>I employed a double microscope, which I had
from Mr Needham, being the same with which
he made his numerous and ingenious observa∣tions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Published in the year 1745.</NOTE>. This instrument is infinitely preferable
to those employed by Leeuwenhoek<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here M. de Buffon mentions the advantages of the double microscope, and some precautions necessary in the management of it, which, now that the instrument is well known, and much improved since the author wrote, it is unnecessary to translate.</NOTE>.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="experiment">
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT I.</HEAD>
<P>Having procured the seminal vessels of a man
who died a violent death, and whose body was
still warm, I extracted all the liquor from them,
and put it in a vial. I examined, by the micro∣scope,
a drop of this liquor, without any dilution.
As soon as the vapours, which arose from the
liquor, and obscured the glass, were dissipated, I
observed pretty large filaments [plate I. fig. 1.],
which, in some places, spread out into branches,
and, in others, intermingled with each other.
These filaments clearly appeared to be agitated
with an internal undulatory motion, like hollow
tubes, which contained some moving substance.
I saw distinctly [pl. I. fig. 2.] two of these fi∣laments,
which were joined longitudinally, se∣parate
from each other in the middle, and alter∣nately
approach and recede, like two stretched
cords, fixed by the ends, and drawn asunder at
the middle. These filaments were composed of
globules which touched one another, and resem∣bled
a chaplet of beads. I then observed fila∣ments
[pl. I. fig. 3.] which were blown up, and
swelled in certain places, and perceived small
oval globules issue from these swelled parts,
which had a vibratory motion, like that of a
pendulum [pl. I. fig. 4.] These small bodies
were attached to the filament by little threads,
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
which gradually lengthened as the bodies mo∣ved:
And, lastly, I observed these small bo∣dies
detach themselves entirely from the large
filament, and draw after them the little thread,
which resembled a tail. As the liquor was too
thick, and the filaments too near each other, I
diluted another drop with pure rain water, after
satisfying myself that it contained no animal∣cules.
I then perceived that the filaments were
more distant from each other, and saw distinctly
the motion of the small bodies above taken no∣tice
of, [pl. I. fig. 5.] which was more free,
and they appeared to swim with greater agility,
and trailed their threads after them with greater
ease; and, if I had not seen them separate from
the filaments, and draw the threads out of them,
I should have believed, from this second obser∣vation,
the moving bodies to be real animals, and
their threads to be tails. After examining with
great attention one of the filaments, which was
three times thicker than the small bodies, I per∣ceived
two of those bodies detach themselves
with much difficulty, and drag after them long
slender threads, which impeded their motion.</P>
<P>This seminal liquor was at first too thick.
But it gradually became more fluid, and, in less
than an hour, it was almost transparent; and, in
proportion as its fluidity augmented, the phae∣nomena
changed, in the manner to be just men∣tioned.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="experiment">
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
<HEAD>EXPER. II.</HEAD>
<P>When the seminal liquor became more fluid,
the filaments disappeared; but the small bodies
were exceedingly numerous [pl. I. fig. 6.].
Their motion, for the most part, resembled that
of a pendulum; each of them had a long
thread, from which they evidently endeavoured
to disengage themselves; their progressive mo∣tion
was extremely slow, during which they
vibrated to the right and left. At each vibration,
they had a rolling unsteady motion; so that,
besides their horizontal vibrations, they roll or
vibrate in a vertical direction; which proves these
bodies to be of a globular figure, or at least that
their inferior part is not a flat base sufficiently
extensive to keep them in one position.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. III.</HEAD>
<P>At the end of two or three hours, when the
liquor was more fluid, a still greater number of
these moving bodies appeared [pl. I. fig. 7.].
They were more free of incumbrances; their
threads were shorter; their progressive motion
was more direct; and their horizontal vibration
was greatly diminished; for the longer the
threads are, their vibratory motion was increased,
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
and their progress forward was diminished. The
vertical vibration was still apparent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. IV.</HEAD>
<P>In five or six hours, the liquor had almost all
the fluidity it could acquire, without being de∣composed.
We then discovered [pl. II. fig. 8.]
that most of these small moving bodies were en∣tirely
disengaged from their threads. Their fi∣gure
was oval: They moved forward with con∣siderable
quickness; and, by their motion back∣ward
and forward, and to every side, they had
now more than ever the appearance of real ani∣mals.
Those which had tails or threads sticking
to them, seemed to have less vivacity than the
others. Of those which had no threads, some ap∣peared
to change both their figure and their size.
Some of them were round; but the greatest part
of them were oval, and a few of them were
thicker at the extremities than in the middle.
The rolling and vibratory motions were still per∣ceptible.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. V.</HEAD>
<P>In 12 hours, the liquor had deposited, at the
bottom of the vial, a kind of gelatinous, bluish,
or rather ash-coloured substance; and the fluid
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
that swimmed on the top was nearly as clear as
water, only it had a tincture of blue, like water
in which a small quantity of soap has been dis∣solved.
It still, however, retained its viscosity.
The little bodies, which were now entirely freed
from their threads, moved with great activity on
all sides, and some of them turned round their
centres. Most of them were oval, though some
of them were round. I have seen them change
figures, and from oval become round: I have seen
them divide, and, from a single oval or globule,
separate into two. Their activity always in∣creased
as their size diminished.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. VI.</HEAD>
<P>At the end of 24 hours, the liquor had depo∣sited
a greater quantity of gelatinous matter,
which I diluted, with some difficulty, in water.
It appeared to consist of a multitude of opaque
tubes, resembling lace, but without any regula∣rity
or the smallest motion. In the clear semen
itself, there were a few small bodies still moving;
next day their number was still farther dimi∣nished.
After this, nothing was to be seen but
globules without the least appearance of motion.</P>
<P>These experiments were often repeated with
great exactness; and they convinced me that the
threads which adhere to the moving bodies are
not tails, nor any part proper to these bodies;
<PB REF="158" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate 3.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
for the tails or threads have no proportion to
the rest of the body; they are of different di∣mensions,
though the bodies are always nearly
of the same size at the same time. The motion
of the globule is embarrassed in proportion to the
length of the tail. When the tail is too long,
it sometimes prevents the progressive motion al∣together,
leaving nothing but the vibrations from
right to left; and the globules make evident
essorts to disentangle themselves from this in∣cumbrance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. VII.</HEAD>
<P>Having procured the seminal fluid of another
man recently dead, I put a pretty large drop of
it on the glass, which soon liquified without any
mixture. It had the appearance of a close net∣work,
the filaments of which were of a conside∣rable
length and thickness, and they seemed to
proceed from the thickest part of the liquor,
[pl. II. fig. 9.]. These filaments separated in
proportion as the liquor became more fluid; and
at last they divided into globules, which seemed
at first to have too little force to put them in
motion: But their power of moving increased
as they receded from the filaments, and they ap∣peared
to make considerable efforts to disengage
themselves. In this manner each of them gra∣dually
drew tails of different lengths out of the
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>
filaments. Some of these tails were so long and
so thin, that they had no proportion to the bo∣dies,
which were always more or less embarras∣sed,
according to the length of the threads or
tails. When the tail was long, the angle of the
vibratory motion was increased; and, when the
tail was short, the progressive motion was more
conspicuous.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>I continued my observations, almost without
interruption, for 14 hours, and I discovered, that
the length of the tails or threads gradually dimi∣nished,
and became so thin and delicate, that their
extremities successively ceased to be visible; and
at last the whole disappeared. The horizontal
vibrations of the globules then ceased, and their
progressive motion was direct, though they still
had vertical oscillations, or rather, they rolled
like a vessel at sea. The small bodies, when de∣prived
of their tails, were oval and transparent,
and resembled those pretended animals which are
seen in oyster-water on the 6th or 7th day, or
those found in the jelly of roasted veal at the end
of the 4th day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. IX.</HEAD>
<P>Between the 10th and 12th hour, the liquor
was become very fluid, and all the globules ap∣peared
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>
to proceed in troops from one side of the
drop [pl. II. fig. 10.]. They passed over the
field of the microscope in less than four seconds;
they marched in lines of seven or eight in front;
and succeeded each other without interruption,
like the defiling of soldiers. I observed this sin∣gular
phaenomenon for more than five minutes;
and, as the current of animals did not then cease,
I was desirous of discovering the cause. I there∣fore
gently shifted the glass, and perceived that
all these moving globules proceeded from a kind
of mucilage, [pl. II. fig. 11.] or net-work of fi∣laments,
which continually produced them, and
with more rapidity and copiousness than the fila∣ments
had done ten hours before. There was
still a difference more remarkable between the
globules produced by the liquor when thick, and
those produced when it was more fluid; for, in
the latter case, they drew no threads or tails af∣ter
them, their motion was quicker, and they
went in flocks like sheep. I examined the mu∣cilage
from which they proceeded for a long
time, and perceived that it gradually diminished
and was converted into moving globules, till
more than one half of it was destroyed. After
which, the liquor being too dry, this mucilage
became obscure in the middle, and it was sur∣rounded
with small threads, forming square inter∣vals,
[pl. II. fig. 12.]. These small threads seem∣ed
to be composed of the bodies of the moving
globules which had been killed by the drying of
<PB N="158" REF="162"/>
the liquor, and the whole resembled the web of
a spider besprinkled with drops of dew.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. X.</HEAD>
<P>By the first experiments, I perceived that these
small moving bodies changed their figures; and
I imagined, that, in general, they diminished in
bulk, though I was not then altogether certain
of the fact. But my subsequent observations
removed every doubt. At the 12th and 13th
hour, the bodies were visibly smaller; but, as
they diminished in bulk, their specific gravity in∣creased,
especially when they ceased to move,
which they generally did all at once, and fell
down to the bottom in the form of an ash-co∣loured
sediment, which was perceptible by the
naked eye; and, by the assistance of the micro∣scope,
it appeared to be composed of globules
attached to one another, sometimes by threads,
and at other times in groups, but always in a re∣gular
manner.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XI.</HEAD>
<P>Having procured the fresh semen of a dog,
I observed that this liquor was clear, and had
very little tenacity. I examined it without the
addition of water, and I perceived moving bodies
<PB REF="163" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate 4.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
almost entirely similar to those in the human
semen, [Pl. III. fig. 13.]. Their tails and their
form were almost precisely the same with those
represented in Pl. II. fig. 7. where the liquor had
been liquified for two or three hours. I in vain
searched this liquor for the silaments which appear∣ed
in that of men. I only remarked some long
and very delicate threads, exactly similar to those
which served for tails to the globules. These
threads contained no globules; neither had they
any motion. The globules with tails seemed to
move with more vivacity than those in the hu∣man
semen. They had hardly any horizontal
vibrations; but they always rolled vertically.
Their number was not great; and, though their
progressive motion was quicker, they took up
some time in passing over the field of the micro∣scope.
I examined this liquor during three
hours, and could observe no change. I conti∣nued
my examination, from time to time, for
several days, and remarked, that the number of
moving bodies gradually diminished. On the
second day, the greatest part of them had lost
their tails: On the third, very few of them re∣tained
their tails; on the fourth, however, some
tails still adhered. The liquor had now de∣posited
a whitish sediment, which appeared to
be composed of globules without motion, and
some small threads that seemed to be the tails
which had separated from the globules. Some
globules appeared to have dead ones attached to
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>
them; for their figure differed from that of those
in motion, [Pl. III. fig. 14.]: They were larger
than the moving globules, or the dead ones at
the bottom of the liquor, and seemed to have a
kind of fissure or opening.</P>

<P>At another time I examined the seminal fluid
of the same dog, and perceived the same phae∣nomena
which have been described. I farther
observed, in a drop of this liquor, a mucilaginous
part, [Pl. III. fig. 15.] from which globules is∣sued
as in Exper. IX. and these globules formed
a current, and moved in regular troops. This
mucilage appeared to be agitated internally with
a swelling or undulating motion, which produced
small protuberances in different parts; and these
protuberances issued suddenly in the form of
globules, which moved briskly forward in the same
direction. These globules differed not from the
others, excepting that they issued from the mu∣cilage
without tails. Some of them, I remarked,
changed their figure; they lengthened them∣selves
till they resembled small cylinders; after
which the extremities of the cylinders swelled,
and divided by the middle into two globules,
and both of them moved on in the same direction
with the rest.</P>

<P>The small glass which contained this liquor
having been overturned by accident, I took, from
the same dog, another quantity of semen. But,
whether the animal had been fatigued by two
frequent emissions, or from some other cause,
this seminal liquor contained nothing: It was
transparent and viscous, like the serum of blood;
and, though I examined it, at different times,
for 24 hours, I could perceive no moving bo∣dies,
no mucilage, nor, in a word, any thing si∣milar

<P>I then opened a dog, and took out the testicles,
and the vessels adhering to them. But I remark∣ed,
that he had no seminal vessels: The seed of
this animal probably passes directly from the
testicles into the urethra. Though the dog was
full grown and vigorous, I found very little se∣men
in the testicles. I examined with the mi∣croscope
the small quantity I could collect; but
could perceive no moving bodies: I only saw a
great number of very minute globules, the
greatest part of which were motionless; and
some of the smallest of them seemed to move
towards each other. But of this I could not be

certain; because the small drops dried in a mi∣nute
or two after they were put upon the glass.</P>

<HEAD>EXPER. XV.</HEAD>
<P>I cut the testicles of this dog into two parts,
put them into a glass-vessel, with as much wa∣ter
as was sufficient to cover them, and corked
up the glass. Three days after, I examined this
infusion with a view to discover if the flesh con∣tained
any moving bodies, and I perceived in
the water of this infusion a great number of
moving bodies, some of them of a globular,
others of an oval figure, and entirely resembling
those I had seen in the seminal fluid of the dog,
excepting that they had no threads or tails:
They moved in all directions with great viva∣city.
I observed, during a long time, these bo∣dies,
which appeared to be animated, and I per∣ceived
several of them change their figures be∣fore
my eyes. Some of them lengthened, o∣thers
contracted, and others swelled at the two
extremities. The whole of them seemed to
turn on their centres; some of them were larger,
and others smaller; but the whole were in mo∣tion,
and resembled, both in size and figure,
those which were described in Exper. IV.</P>

<P>Next day, the number of moving globules
was still increased; but they were smaller; their
motion more rapid and more irregular; and
their form and manner of moving were dif∣ferent,
and appeared to be more confused: The
day after, and the following days, till the 20th,
moving bodies still appeared in this water. They
daily diminished in size, and at last became so
small that they could be hardly perceived; but
the last of them I was able to distinguish on the
18th and 20th days, moved with the same ra∣pidity
as ever. On the top of the water there
was a pellicle which appeared to be composed of
the skins or coverings of the moving bodies, of
small threads, &amp;c. But no motion appeared in
it. This pellicle and the moving bodies could
not be introduced into the liquor by means of
the external air; for the bottle was always
closely corked.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="17" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>I opened successively, on different days, ten
rabbits, in order to examine their seminal fluid.
In the first, second, and third, I found not a
single drop, either in the testicles or seminal ves∣sels,
though I was certain that two of them were
<PB N="164" REF="169"/>
fathers of a numerous progeny. I imagined
that the presence of the female might be neces∣sary
for the secretion of the semen; I therefore
put males and females by pairs into separate
cages, so constructed that they could not possibly
copulate. Neither did this scheme at first suc∣ceed;
for I opened two of them without finding
any semen. In the sixth, however, which was
a large white rabbit, full of vigour, I found as
much liquor in the seminal vessels as would fill
a small coffee-spoon. This matter resembled
the jelly of meat, was of a citron colour, and
almost transparent. Having examined it with
the microscope, it gradually separated into fila∣ments
and large globules, several of which were
attached to each other like a string of beads;
but I could discover no distinct motion; only, as
the matter dissolved, it formed a kind of current,
by which the filaments and globules were carried
down to one side of the glass. I waited till the
matter should become more fluid; but I was dis∣appointed;
for, after liquifying a little, it dried
up, and I could observe nothing farther than
what I have already described. I then added
water to it, but without success; for the water
seemed not to penetrate or dilute the matter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="18" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I opened another rabbit, and found only a small
quantity of seminal matter, which had hardly
<PB N="165" REF="170"/>
any of the yellow colour, and was more fluid
than the former. As the quantity was very
small, I was apprehensive lest it should dry too
suddenly; I therefore instantly mixed it with
water, and could perceive in it neither the fila∣ments
nor the strings of beads that I had obser∣ved
in the other; but I discovered the large
globules, and farther remarked, that they had a
kind of trembling restless motion. They had
also a progressive motion; but it was very slow:
Some of them moved round others, and most of
them appeared to turn round their centres. I
could proceed no farther in my observations,
because the liquor dried suddenly up.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="19" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>Having dissected another rabbit, that had
been placed in the same circumstances, I found
no seminal liquor; but, in the seminal vessels of
another, I found nearly as much congealed mat∣ter
as in Exper. XVII. I examined this matter
without discovering any thing. I therefore took
the whole, and, adding to it a double quantity
of water, shook the mixture violently in a glass.
I then left it to settle for ten minutes; after
which I examined a drop taken from the surface,
and perceived the large globules formerly men∣tioned;
but they were few in number, and per∣fectly
detached from one another. They moved
<PB N="166" REF="171"/>
towards each other; but this motion was so slow,
as to be hardly perceptible. Two or three hours
after, the globules seemed to be diminished in
size; their motion was more sensible; and they
turned upon their centres. Though their trem∣bling
was more apparent than their progressive
motion; yet they plainly changed places in an
irregular manner, with respect to each other.
In six or seven hours, the globules were become
smaller, and their activity was greater. Their
number appeared to be great, and all their mo∣tions
were sensible. Next day there was a pro∣digious
multitude of moving globules, and they
were at least three times less than at first. I
continued my observations for eight days, and I
perceived that several of the globules joined;
and, though all motion ceased after this union,
it appeared only to be superficial and accidental.
Some of them were larger, and others less;
though most of them were spherical, some of
them were oval, and others cylindrical. The
largest were most transparent; and the smallest
were almost black. This difference could pro∣ceed
from no accident in the light; for they
were always of the same colour, whatever was
their situation: The motion of the small globules
was likewise more rapid. The whole gradually
diminished in size, so that, on the eight day they
were so small that it was with the utmost diffi∣culty
I could distinguish them, and at last they
totally disappeared.</P>

<P>In fine, having, with great difficulty, procured
the seminal liquor of another rabbit, in the very
state in which it is conveyed into the female, I
remarked, that it was much more fluid than that
which was extracted from the seminal vessels;
and the phaenomena it presented were also very
different: For, in this liquor there were moving
globules, filaments without motion, and a kind
of globules with tails or threads, similar to those
in the seminal fluid of man and of the dog, only
these last appeared to be less, and more active [Pl.
III. fig. 17.]. They traversed, in an instant, the
field of the microscope: Their tails seemed to
be much shorter than those of other spermatic
animals; and I acknowledge, that I was uncer∣tain
whether some of these tails were not decep∣tions
occasioned by the track of the globules in
the liquor; for they moved with such rapidity,
that I could hardly observe them; and besides,
the liquor, though sufficiently fluid, dried very
suddenly.</P>

<P>Having procured, at different times, the testi∣cles
and seminal vessels of 12 or 13 rams, re∣cently
after they were killed, I could not sind,
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
either in the epidydimis or seminal vessels, a
quantity of semen sufficient for observation. In
the small drops I could collect, I found nothing
but globules without motion. As these experi∣ments
were made in March, I imagined that, by
repeating them in October, which is the time of
rutting, I might find more liquor in the vessels.
I cut several testicles in two longitudinally, and
having collected a small drop of liquor, I still
could perceive nothing but motionless globules
of different sizes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="22" TYPE="experiment">

<P>I took three testicles of three different rams,
cut them into four parts, and put each of them
into a glass-vessel, with as much water as was
sufficient to cover them, and then shut the vessels
so close as to exclude the air. I allowed the
testicles to infuse during four days; after which
I examined the liquor in each glass with the mi∣croscope,
and found the whole full of moving
bodies, most of which were oval, and some of
them globular. They were equally large, and
greatly resembled those described in Exper. VIII.
Their motion was not rapid, but equal, uniform,
and in all directions. In each liquor, the mo∣ving
bodies were nearly of the same size; but,
in the one they were larger, in the other less, and,
in the third, still more minute: They had no
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
tails; neither were there, in the liquor, any
threads or filaments. They often changed their
figures, and seemed successively to cast their skin
or outer covering. They daily became smaller,
and, on the 16th day, they were so small as
scarcely to be visible.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="23" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the following October, I opened a ram,
and found a great quantity of seminal liquor in
the epidydimis. Having examined it with the
microscope, I saw such an innumerable multi∣tude
of moving bodies, that the liquor seemed to
be entirely composed of them. As the liquor
was too thick, I diluted it with water; but I was
astonished to find, that the water had stopped all
motion in the bodies; though I saw them di∣stinctly
in the liquor, they were all at absolute
rest. Having frequently repeated the same ex∣periment,
I discovered, that cold water, which
diluted the seminal liquors of other animals,
made that of the ram coagulate.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="24" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>I then opened another ram, and, to prevent
the liquor from coagulating by cold, I left the
parts of generation in the body of the animal,
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
which was covered with warm cloths. This pre∣caution
assorded me an opportunity of exami∣ning
with ease the seminal liquor of many rams
in its fluid state. It was filled with an infinite
number of oblong moving bodies, [pl. III. fig. 18.]
which run about in every direction. But, when∣ever
the liquor cooled, all motion instantly
ceased; so that I could never observe the same
drop above a minute or two. When I diluted
the liquor with warm water, the bodies conti∣nued
to move for three or four minutes. The
moving bodies were so numerous, that, though
the liquor was diluted, almost all of them touch∣ed
each other. They were all of the same size
and figure. None of them had tails. Their
motion was not rapid; and, when the liquor
began to coagulate, they suffered no change in
their form.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="25" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXV.</HEAD>
<P>As I was persuaded, both by my theory, and
the experiments made by others upon this sub∣ject,
that the female, as well as the male, posses∣sed
a prolific seminal fluid; and, as I had no
doubt but that the glandular bodies of the testi∣cles,
where prejudiced anatomists had in vain
searched for the egg, were the reservoirs of this
fluid; I purchased several dogs and bitches, and
male and female rabbits, which were kept sepa∣rate
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
from each other: And, that I might have
an object to compare with the female fluid, I a∣gain
examined the seminal liquor of a dog,
which had been emitted in the natural manner.
I found the moving bodies in the same state and
attended with the same circumstances as former∣ly
[pl. IV. fig. 19.].</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="26" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>A live bitch was next dissected, which had
been four or five days in season, without having
any communication with the male. The testicles
were as large as silberds. On one of them I found
a red prominent glandular body of the size of a
pea, which had a perfect resemblance to a little
nipple, with a visible fissure, that had two lips,
one of which was more prominent than the o∣ther.
Having opened this fissure, a liquor di∣stilled
from it, which we collected for exa∣mination.
The testicles were then returned
into the body of the animal, which was still
alive, in order to preserve them from cold. I
then examined this liquor with the microscope,
and had the satisfaction of perceiving, at the first
glance, moving bodies with tails, exactly similar
to those which we had observed in the seminal
fluid of the dog [pl. IV. fig. 20.]. Messrs Need∣ham
and Daubenton, who were present, were so
struck with this resemblance, that they could not
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
be persuaded that the spermatic animals were not
the very same; and they imagined that I had
forgotten to change the object-glass, or rather,
that the same pick-tooth with which the drops
of the female fluid were collected, had also been
employed in collecting those of the male. Mr
Needham, therefore, changed both the object-glass
and the pick-tooth, and took a fresh drop
from the fissure of the glandular body, and exa∣mined
it first with his own eyes. He again saw
the very same moving bodies, and was fully
convinced, not only of the existence of sperma∣tic
animals in the seminal fluid of the female,
but also of their resemblance to those in the se∣men
of the male. We repeated the experiment
with fresh drops no less than ten times, in all of
which the phaenomena were exactly the same.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="27" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Having then examined the other testicle, I
found an unripe glandular body, which was
smaller, and less red than the former, and had
no fissure; but, after opening it with a scalpel,
I found no liquor. Upon the external surface
of this testicle, there were some lymphatic vesi∣cles.
I pierced one of them with a lancet, and
there issued a clear liquor, to which I imme∣diately
applied the microscope. But it con∣tained
nothing similar to what we discovered in
<PB REF="178" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
that of the glandular body. It was a transparent
liquor, composed of very small globules, with∣out
any motion. After repeating this experi∣ment
several times, I was convinced, that the li∣quor
in the vesicles is only a species of lymph,
which contains nothing animated or similar to
what we perceive in the female semen, which is
secreted and matured in the glandular bodies.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="28" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Some time after, another bitch was opened,
which had been seven or eight days in season,
and had not received the male. I examined the
testicles, and upon each I found a glandular bo∣dy
in full perfection. The first was half open,
and had a canal which penetrated the testicle,
and was full of seminal fluid; the second was
larger and more prominent, and the fissure or
canal that contained the fluid was below the nip∣ple,
which protruded outward. I took the li∣quor
out of both the glandular bodies, and, on
comparison, found them entirely similar. This
seminal liquor of the female is equally fluid with
that of the male. After examining the liquors
extracted from each testicle, I found in them the
very same moving bodies [pl. IV. fig. 21.]. I
perceived at leisure the same phaenomena that I
had observed in the seminal liquor of the other
bitch; I saw several globules which moved with
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
great rapidity, which endeavoured to disengage
themselves from the mucilage that surrounded
them, and which dragged tails or threads after
them. Their number was equally great with
that in the male semen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="29" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>I squeezed the whole liquor out of these two
glandular bodies, and put it into the glass of a
watch. The quantity was sufficient to serve for
four or five hours observation. I remarked that
it deposited a kind of sediment, or at least began
to thicken. I took a drop of the thickest part
of the liquor, and having examined it, I disco∣vered
that the mucilaginous part of the semen
was condensed, and formed a kind of net-work.
From the anterior edge of this net-work, there
issued a current of globules which moved with
great rapidity [Pl. IV. fig. 22.]. These globules
were extremely active and lively, and they ap∣peared
to be divested of their mucilaginous co∣verings,
and of their tails. This stream of glo∣bules
resembled the motion of the blood in the
veins; for they seemed not only to be animated,
but to be pushed on by some common force,
which obliged them to follow each other in
troops or rows. From this experiment, and from
the 11th and 12th, I concluded, that, when the
fluid begins to coagulate or grow thick, the ac∣tive
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
globules break their mucilaginous covering,
and escape at that side where the liquor is most
fluid. They had no threads or tails, and most
of them were oval, and seemed to be flat below;
for they had no rolling motion.</P>

<P>I opened the horns of the uterus longitudinal∣ly,

them, I found it exhibited precisely the same
phaenomena with that obtained from the glan∣dular

that they can easily pour their liquor up∣on
the horns of the uterus: And I am persuaded
that, during the whole season of love, there is a
perpetual distillation of this liquor from the glan∣dular
bodies into the horns of the uterus; that
this distillation continues till the glandular bodies
be entirely emptied; and that they are gradual∣ly
effaced, leaving only behind them a small red∣dish

testicles were as large as a small hen's egg; on
one of them was a glandular body of the size of
a pea, which protruded from the testicle like a
little nipple: But it had no fissure or external
aperture. It was so firm and hard, that I could
press no liquor out of it with my fingers. Be∣fore
cutting this testicle, I observed two other
glandular bodies at a distance from each other.
They were very small, and of a whitish yellow
colour; but the large one, which seemed to have
pierced the membrane of the testicle, was as red
as a rose. I examined this last with great atten∣tion;
but could discover no liquor; from which I
concluded, that it was still far from being mature.</P>

to appear under the membrane. I opened them

were hard bodies, with a tincture of yellow.
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
On each testicle there were four or five lymphatic
vesicles; they were full of liquor. When ex∣amined

a cow which, though not old, had had several
young. I first examined the testicles of the
latter, and found, upon one of them, a glandu∣lar
body as large as a cherry. I perceived three
holes into which bristles might be introduced.
Having pressed the body with my fingers, a
small quantity of liquor issued out, which I ex∣amined,
and had the pleasure of seeing moving
bodies, [Pl. IV. fig. 22.], but different from what
I had observed in other seminal fluids. These
globules were small and obscure: Their pro∣gressive
motion, though distinct, was very slow.
The liquor was not thick: The moving globules
had no appearance of threads or tails, and they
were not all in motion. These are all the ob∣servations
I could make on this liquor; for,
though I again squeezed the glandular body, I

could not obtain any more liquor that was un∣mixed

<P>This glandular body was situated at one
extremity of the testicle, near the horn of
the uterus; and the liquor which it distilled
must have fallen upon that horn: But, af∣ter
opening the horn, I found no liquor. I
then opened the testicle longitudinally, and,
though its cavity was considerable, it contained
no fluid. At some distance from the large glan∣dular
body, there was a small one of the same
kind, about the size of a lentil. Two cicatrices,
or little pits, also appeared; they were of a deep
red colour, and were the relicts of old glandu∣lar
bodies which had been obliterated. Having
next examined the other testicle of the same
cow, I discovered four cicatrices and three glan∣dular
bodies, the most advanced of which was
of a red flesh-colour, and exceeded not the size
of a pea. It was solid, without any aperture,
and contained no liquor. The other two were
much smaller and harder; and their colour was
a kind of orange. The lymphatic vesicles were

were rather larger than those of the other cow.
But, what is not less remarkable than true, there
was not a single cicatrice on either of them. A
number of lymphatic vesicles appeared on one
of the testicles; but there was no vestige of glan∣dular
bodies. Upon the other testicle, I could
discern the rudiments of two glandular bodies,
one just beginning to spring up, the other as
large as a small pea. There were also many

then examined the infusions with the micro∣scope,

the globules were extremely small, but very

<P>I procured the uteri of three other cows; and
I first searched the testicles, in order to discover
if there were any mature glandular bodies. In
two of the uteri I found only small glandular
bodies on the testicles. I was not informed
whether the cows had ever brought forth; but
it is probable that they had often been in season;
for a number of cicatrices appeared on their te∣sticles.
On one of the testicles of the third cow,
I observed a glandular body as large as a cherry,
and very red; it was much swelled, and seemed
to be perfectly ripe. I pressed the nipple, which
was perforated by a hole, with my fingers, and
a considerable quantity of liquor issued out. In
this liquor, I found moving bodies [Pl. IV.
fig. 24.] perfectly similar to those described in
Exper. XXXVI. Their number was indeed
greater, and their progressive motion was quick∣er;
they seemed to be somewhat longer; and,
having observed them a long time, I perceived
that they grew longer, and changed their figure.
I then introduced a fine probe into the small
<PB N="182" REF="188"/>
aperture of the glandular body; and, having
cut along the probe as a directory, I found that
the cavity was filled with a liquid matter. This
liquor, when examined with the microscope,
presented the same phaenomena, the same mo∣ving
bodies as in Exper. XXXVI. But I could
discover in none of them either filaments or tails.

<P>On the testicles of some cows, I found a
species of bladders or vesicles, which are called
<HI>hydatides</HI> by anatomists. I observed some of
them large and others small; and they were at∣tached
to the testicle by a kind of pedicle. I
examined the liquor they contained; but it was
transparent, homogeneous, and every way simi∣lar
to the liquor in the vesicles. It had no glo∣bular
or moving particles.</P>

<DIV3 N="44" TYPE="experiment">
<HEAD>EXPER. XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>At this time, I made some experiments upon
oister-water, upon water in which pepper had
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
been boiled, upon water in which pepper had
been simply infused, and upon water in which
pink-seeds were infused. The bottles contain∣ing
all these infusions were exactly corked. At
the end of two days, I saw, in the oister-water,
a vast quantity of oval and globular bodies,
which seemed to swim like fishes in a pond, and
had every appearance of being real animals.
They had no members that could be discovered,
and no tails. They were transparent, and pretty
large; I saw them change their figures; they
became gradually smaller and smaller during
the seven or eight days that they subsisted; and,
lastly, along with Mr Needham, I saw animal∣cules
so very similar, in an infusion of the jelly
of roasted veal, which had likewise been close
corked, that I am persuaded they are not true
animals, agreeable to the common acceptation
of that term, as shall afterwards be fully ex∣plained.</P>
<P>The infusion of pink-seeds was crowded with
innumerable moving globules, which appeared
to be equally animated with those in the seminal
liquors and in infusions of the flesh of animals.
At first they were pretty large, and moved with
great rapidity in every possible direction. They
continued in this state during three weeks, and
gradually diminished in size till their minuteness
rendered them invisible.</P>
<P>The same phaenomenon took place in the in∣fusions
of pepper; but the moving bodies did
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
not appear so early as in the other infusions, and
their appearance was later in the infusion of pep∣per
that was not boiled. I then began to suspect
that what is called fermentation, might be ow∣ing
to the motion of these organic particles in
animal and vegetable substances. To discover
if there was any similarity between this species
of fermentation, and that excited by mineral sub∣stances,
I applied to the microscope a little lime∣stone
powder, and poured upon it a drop of
aquafortis. But the phaenomena were totally
different. Large bubbles rose to the surface, and
instantly darkened the lens of the microscope;
when the gross parts were dissolved, every thing
remained at rest, and nothing appeared which
had the smallest analogy to what we perceive in
the infusions of animal or vegetable bodies.</P>

<P>I examined the seminal liquor in the milts of
different fishes, extracted while the animals were
alive, and I observed a vast quantity of obscure
moving globules. I then squeezed with my

which they emit this liquor, and, in the drops
which I procured, I saw great multitudes of the
same moving globules, which were almost black,
and very small.</P>

<DIV3 N="46" TYPE="experiment">
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
<HEAD>EXPER. XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>Before I conclude this chapter, I shall relate
the experiments of Mr Needham upon the se∣men
of a species of cuttle-fish, called the <HI>Calmar.</HI>
This acute observer, having examined the sper∣matic
animals in the milts of different fishes,
found them of an uncommon magnitude in the
milt of the calmar. To the naked eye, they
were from three to four lines in length. During
a whole summer, while he dissected calmars at
Lisbon, he could find no appearance of a milt,
or of any reservoir destined to receive the semi∣nal
liquor of that fish; and it was the middle of
December before he could perceive the first ve∣stiges
of a new vessel filled with a milty juice.
This reservoir, and the juice it contained, gra∣dually
increased. In examining this seminal li∣quor
with the microscope, he saw nothing in it
but small opaque globules swimming in a kind
of serous matter, without any appearance of life.
But, some time after, he discovered, in the milt
of another calmar, organic bodies compleatly
formed, which resembled spiral springs, [<HI>a, b,</HI>
Pl. I. fig. 5.] inclosed in a transparent case.
These springs were equally perfect at the first
observation as afterwards; only they, in time,
contracted themselves, and formed a kind of
screw. The head of the case is a species of valve
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
which opens outward, and through which every
thing within may be forced out. It contains,
besides, another valve <HI>b,</HI> a little barrel, <HI>c,</HI> and a
spongy substance <HI>d, e.</HI> Thus the whole machine
consists of an outer, transparent, cartilaginous
case, <HI>a, fig.</HI> 2. the superior extremity of which
is terminated by a round head, formed by the
case itself, and performs the office of a valve.
This external case contains a transparent tube,
which includes the spring, a piston or valve, a
little barrel, and a spongy substance. The skrew
occupies the superior part of the tube and case,
the piston and barrel are situated in the middle,
and the spongy substance occupies the inferior
part. These machines pump the liquor of the
milt; the spongy substance is full of this liquor;
and, before the animal spawns, the whole milt
is only a congeries of these organic bodies, which
have absolutely pumped up and dried the mil∣ty
liquor. Whenever these small machines are
taken from the body of the animal, and put a∣mong
water, or exposed to the air, they begin to
act [Pl. V. fig. 2. and 3.]; the spring mounts
up, and is followed by the piston, the barrel, and
the spongy substance which contains the liquor:
And, as soon as the spring and the tube in which
it is contained begin to issue out of the case, the
spring plaits, and the whole internal apparatus
moves, till the spring, the piston, and the barrel
have entirely escaped from the case. When
this is effected, all the rest instantly follow, and
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
the milty liquor, which had been pumped, and
was confined in the spongy substance, runs out
through the barrel.</P>
<P>As this phaenomenon is extremely singular,
and incontestibly proves that the moving bodies
in the milt of the calmar are not real animals,
but simple machines, a species of pumps, I shall
here transcribe Mr Needham's own account of
the matter:</P>
<P>'When the small machines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Needham's New Discoveries made with the Microscope, ch. 6. p. 53.</NOTE>,' says he, 'have
come to their full maturity, several of them act
as soon as they are exposed to the air. Most
of them, however, may be commodiously
viewed by the microscope before their action
commences; and, even before they act, it is
necessary to moisten with a drop of water the
superior extremity of the external case, which
then begins to expand, while the two slender
ligaments that issue out of the case are twisted
and contorted in different ways. At the same
time, the screw rises slowly, and the spirals at
its superior end approach each other, and act
against the top of the case, those which are
lower seeming to be continually followed by
others that issue from the piston; I say, that
they <HI>seem</HI> to follow; because I believe it to be
only a deception produced by the motion of
the screw. The piston and barrel likewise
move in the same direction; and the inferior
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
part, which contains the semen, extends in
length, and, at the same time, moves towards
the top of the case, which is apparent by the
vacuity left at the bottom. As soon as the
screw, with the tube in which it is inclosed,
begins to appear out of the case, it twists, be∣cause
it is constrained by the two ligaments.
The whole internal apparatus continues to
move gradually and slowly till the screw, the
piston, and the barrel, have entirely escaped.
When that happens, the remainder issues in∣stantaneously.
The piston, <HI>b</HI> [Pl. V. fig. 2.].
separates from the barrel <HI>a</HI>; the ligament,
which is under the barrel, swells and acquires
a diameter equal to that of the spongy part
which succeeds it: This, though much broader
than when in the case, becomes also five times
longer than formerly. The tube, which in∣cluded
the whole, contracts in the middle, and
forms two knots or joints, <HI>d, e,</HI> [Pl. V. fig. 2.
and 3.], distant about one third of its length
from each extremity. Then the semen escapes
by the barrel <HI>e,</HI> [fig. 2.]. It is composed of
small opaque globules, which swim in a serous
matter, without discovering any signs of life,
and are precisely the same as I perceived them
to be when diffused through the reservoir of
the milt. In the figure, the part comprehend∣ed
between the two joints <HI>d, e,</HI> appear to be
fringed. When examined attentively, this
appearance seems to be occasioned by the spon∣gy
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
substance within the tube being broken and
divided into portions nearly equal. The fol∣lowing
phaenomena will clearly prove that
this is the case.'</P>
<P>'It sometimes happens, that the screw and
the tube break precisely above the piston <HI>b,</HI>
which remains in the barrel <HI>e,</HI> [fig. 3.]. Then
the tube instantly shuts; and, by contracting,
assumes a conical figure above the extremity of
the screw, <HI>f.</HI> This is a demonstration that it
is there very elastic; and the manner in which
it accommodates its figure to that of the sub∣stance
which includes it, when the latter un∣dergoes
the smallest change, proves that it is
every where equally elastic.'</P>
<P>M. Needham hence concludes, that it is na∣tural
to imagine that the total action of this
machine is occasioned by the spring of the screw.
But, unfortunately, he proves, by several expe∣riments,
that the screw is acted upon by a power
residing in the spongy part: As soon as the
screw is separated from the rest of the machine,
it ceases to act, and loses all motion. The au∣thor
draws the following conclusion from this
singular phaenomenon.</P>
<P>'If I had seen,' says he, 'these pretended ani∣malcules
in the semen of living animals, I should,
perhaps, have been able to ascertain whether
they are really animated beings, or only pro∣digiously
small machines, which correspond in
miniature to the larger vessels of the calmar.'</P>
<P><PB REF="198" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate VII.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="199"/>
From this and other analogies, Mr Needham
concludes, that the spermatic worms of other
animals, it is reasonable to think, are only or∣ganic
bodies; a species of machines similar to
those of the calmar, which act at different times;
for, says he, if we suppose that, of the prodi∣gious
number of spermatic animalcules which
appear in the field of the microscope, only a few
thousands act at a time, this will be sufficient to
make us believe the whole to be alive. If it be
farther supposed, he adds, that the motion of
each animalcule lasts, like that of the calmar
machines, about half a minute; in this case, the
successive action of the small machines would
continue for a considerable time, and the ani∣malcules
would die one after another. Besides,
why should the semen of the calmar alone con∣tain
machines, while that of all other animals
contain real living animalcules? Here the ana∣logy
is so strong as to be almost irresistible. Mr
Needham farther remarks, that even Leeuwen∣hoek's
experiments seem to indicate that the
spermatic animals have a great resemblance to the
organic bodies in the semen of the calmar.
Speaking of the semen of the cod, Leeuwen∣hoek
remarks, that he imagined the oval bodies
to be animalcules burst and distended, because
they were four times larger than when alive.
And, in another place, he observes of the semen
of the dog, that the animalcules often changed
<PB N="192" REF="200"/>
their figure, especially when the liquor began to
evaporate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Leeuwenh. Arc. nat. p. 306. 309. and 319.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On all these accounts, Mr Needham conjec∣tured,
that the pretended spermatic animals were
only a kind of natural machines, bodies much
more simply organized than those of real ani∣mals.
I examined the machines of the calmar
along with him, and the reader may be assured
that his description of them is both exact and
faithful. His experiments, therefore, demon∣strate,
that the seminal fluid consists of particles
in quest of organization; that, in fact, it pro∣duces
organized bodies; but that these bodies are
not animals, nor similar to the individual which
produces them. It is, indeed, probable, that
these organized bodies are only a kind of instru∣ments
for perfecting the semen, and bestowing
on it an active force; and that it is by their in∣ternal
action that they intimately penetrate the
seminal fluid of the female.</P>

<HEAD>Comparison of my own Experiments with those of
Leeuwenhoek.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH my experiments were made
with all the attention of which I was ca∣pable,
and though I often repeated them, I am
satisfied that many things must have escaped me.
I have only described what I saw, and what e∣very
man may see, at the expence of a little art
and patience. To free myself from prejudice, I
even attempted to forget what other observers
pretended to have seen, endeavouring, by this
means, to be certain of seeing nothing but what
really appeared; and it was not till I had di∣gested
my experiments, that I wished to compare
them with those of former writers, and particu∣larly
with those of Leeuwenhoek, who had oc∣cupied
himself more than 60 years in experi∣ments
of this kind.</P>
<P>Whatever authority may be due to this acute
observer, it is certainly allowable to institute a
comparison between a man's own observations,
and those of the most respectable writer on the
same subject. By an examination of this kind,
<PB N="194" REF="202"/>
truth may be established, and errors may be de∣tected,
especially when the only object of in∣quiry
is to ascertain the genuine nature of those
moving bodies which appear in the seminal fluids
of all animals.</P>
<P>In the month of November 1677, Leeuwen∣hoek,
who had formerly communicated many
microscopic observations to the Royal Society of
London, concerning the juices of plants, the
texture of trees, the optic nerve, rain-water, &amp;c.
writes to Lord Brouncker, president of the So∣ciety,
in the following terms: 'Postquam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See phil. trans. No. 141. p. 1041.</NOTE> Exc.

<P>The secretary of the Royal Society replied to
this letter of Leeuwenhoek, that it would be
proper to make similar experiments on the semi∣nal
fluids of other animals, not only to support
the original discovery, but to distinguish what∣ever
differences might appear in the number and
<PB N="197" REF="205"/>
figure of the animalcules: And, with regard to
the vascular texture of the thick part of the se∣minal
fluid, he suspected that it was only a con∣geries
of filaments, without any regular organi∣zation:
'Quae tibi videbatur vasorum congeries,

<P>I have transcribed these passages from the Phi∣losophical
Transactions, because they first ap∣peared
in that work, before Leeuwenhoek had
formed any theory; and, therefore, they must
be more agreeable to truth. After the ingenious
author had formed a system of generation, his
account of the spermatic animals varies, even in
matters that are essential<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the author attempts a formal proof that Leeuwen∣hoek invented the single microscope, and the existence of sper∣matic animals, before Hartsoeker, which interrupts the argu∣ment, is noways interesting to the reader, and is here omitted in the translation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the first place, what he says concerning the
number of these pretended animalcules is true;
but the figure of their bodies corresponds not
always to his description. Sometimes the end
next the tail is globular and sometimes cylindri∣cal;
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>
sometimes it is flat, and at other times it is
broader than long, &amp;c. With regard to the
tail, it is often thicker and shorter than
he makes it. The vibratory motion, he a∣scribes
to the tail, and by which he alledges
the animals are enabled to proceed forward, I
never could distinguish in the manner he de∣scribes
it. I have seen these moving bodies vi∣brate
eight or ten times, from right to left, or from
left to right, without advancing the breadth of a
single hair; and I have observed many of them
which never could proceed forward, because this
tail, in place of assisting them to swim, was, on
the contrary, a small thread attached to the fila∣ments
or mucilaginous part of the liquor, and,
of course, totally prevented the progressive mo∣tion
of the body. Even when the tail appeared
to have any motion, it only resembled the small
bendings of a thread at the end of a vibration.
I have seen these threads or tails fixed to the
filaments, which Leeuwenhoek calls vessels:
I have seen them separate from the fila∣ments,
after repeated efforts made by the moving
bodies; I have seen them first long, then dimi∣nish,
and at last disappear. Thus these tails
ought to be regarded as accidental appendages,
and not as real members of the moving bodies.
But, what is more remarkable, Leeuwenhoek
expressly affirms, in this letter to Lord Brouncker,
that, besides the tailed animals, he observed in
this liquor animalcules still more minute that
had no tails, and were perfectly globular: 'His
<PB REF="209" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate VIII.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="201" REF="210"/>
animalculis (caudatis scilicet) minora adhuc
animalcula, quibus non nisi globuli siguram
attribuere possum, permista erant.' This is the
truth. After Leeuwenhoek, however, had main∣tained
that these animalcules were the only effi∣cient
principle of generation, and that they were
transformed into men, he regards as real animals
only those which had tails; and, accordingly, as
it was necessary that animalcules, to be trans∣formed
into men, should have a constant and in∣variable
figure, he never afterwards mentions
the round animals without tails. I was struck
with the difference between the original compo∣sition
of this letter, and the form in which it ap∣peared
twenty years afterwards in his third vo∣lume:
For, instead of the words which we have
just now quoted, we meet with the following in
pag. 63. 'Animalculis hisce permistae jacebant
aliae minutiores particulae, quibus non aliam
quam globulorum seu sphaericam figuram as∣signare
queo.' This is a very different account
of the matter. A particle of matter, to which he
ascribes no motion, is extremely different from
an animalcule. It is astonishing that Leeuwen∣hoek,
in copying his own letter, should have
changed an article of so much consequence.
What he immediately subjoins likewise merits
attention. He says, that, at the intreaty of Mr
Oldenburg, he had examined this liquor three
or four years ago; and that he then imagined
these animalcules to be globules. Thus, these
<PB N="202" REF="211"/>
pretended animalcules are sometimes globules
without any sensible motion; sometimes they are
globules which move with great activity; some∣times
they have tails, and sometimes no tails.
Speaking of spermatic animals in general, he re∣marks
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>, 'Ex hisce meis observationibus cogitare
coepi, quamvis antehac, de animalculis in semi∣nibus
masculinis agens, scripserim me in illis
caudas non detexisse, fieri tamen posse ut illa
animalcula aeque caudis fuerint instructa, ac
nunc comperi de animalculis in gallorum gal∣linaccorum
semine masculino:' Another proof
that he has often seen spermatic animals of all
kinds, without tails.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is worthy of remark, that Leeu∣wenhoek
had very early discovered the filaments
which appear in the semen before it be liqui∣sied;
and that, at that time, when he had not
framed his hypothesis concerning the spermatic
animals, he conceived the filaments to be veins,
nerves, and arteries. He firmly believed, that
all the parts and vessels of the human body
might be clearly distinguished in the seminal
fluid. He even persisted in this opinion, not∣withstanding
the representations made to him by
Mr Oldenburg, in name of the Royal Society.
But, after he conceived the notion of transform∣ing
his spermatic animals into men, he never
again takes any notice of these vessels. Instead
of regarding them as the nerves and blood-ves∣sels
<PB N="203" REF="212"/>
of the human body already formed in the
semen, he does not even ascribe to them their
real function, which is the production of the
moving bodies. He observes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 7.</NOTE>, 'Quid fiet de
omnibus illis particulis seu corpusculis praeter
illa animalcula semini virili hominum inhae∣rentibus!
Olim et priusquam haec scriberem,
in ea sententia fui praedictas strias vel vasa ex
testiculis principlum secum ducere,' &amp;c. And,
in another place, he says, that what he had for∣merly
remarked concerning vessels in the semen
deserved no attention.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If we compare the figures 1. 2. 3. and 4.
Pl. VI. and VII. which we have represented exactly
as they appear in the Philosophical Transactions,
with those which Leeuwenhoek caused to be
engraved several years after, we shall find very
great differences, especially in those of the dead
animalcules of the rabbit, 1. 3. and 4. and in
those of the dog, which I have also delineated,
in order to give a distinct idea of the matter.
From all this, it may fairly be concluded, that
Leeuwenhoek has not always seen the same
phaenomena; that the moving bodies, which he
regards as animals, have appeared to him under
different forms; and that he has contradicted
himself with a view to make the species of men
and of animals uniform and consistent. He not
only varies as to the fundamental part of these
experiments, but also as to the manner of ma∣king
<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
them; for he expressly tells us, that he al∣ways
diluted the semen with water, to separate
its parts, and to give more freedom of motion to
the animalcules<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 92. 93.</NOTE>; and yet, in his first letter to
Lord Brouncker, he says, that, when he mixed
the semen of dogs, in which he before had seen
innumerable animals, with water, they all in∣stantly
died. Thus Leeuwenhoek's first experi∣ments
were made, like mine, without any mix∣ture;
and, it appears, that he was not in use to
mix the liquor with water till long after he be∣gan
his experiments, and till he conceived the
idea of water's killing the animalcules; which,
however, is not true: I imagine that the addi∣tion
of water only dissolves the filaments too
suddenly; for, in all my experiments, I have
seen but very few filaments in the liquor, after
its being mixed with water.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek was no sooner persuaded that
the spermatic animalcules were transformed in∣to
men and other animals, than he imagined that
he saw two distinct kinds in the semen of every
animal, the one male, and the other female.
Without this difference of sex in the spermatic
animalcules, it was difficult, he says, to conceive
the possibility of producing males and females by
simple transformation. He mentions these male
and female animalcules in his letter published in
the Philosophical Transactions, No. 145. and in
several other places<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See tom. 1. p. 163. and tom. 3. p. 101. of his works.</NOTE>. But he attempts not to
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
describe the differences between male and fe∣male
animalcules, which never existed but in
his own imagination.</P>
<P>The famous Boerhaave having asked Leeu∣wenhoek,
whether he had observed any diffe∣rences
in the growth and size of spermatic ani∣mals?
Leeuwenhoek replied, that, in the semen
of a rabbit which he had opened, he saw an in∣finite
number of animalcules: 'Incredibilem,'
says he, 'viventium animalculorum numerum
conspexerunt, cum haec animalcula scypho
imposita vitreo et illic emortua, in rariores or∣dines
disparassent, et per continuos aliquot dies
saepius visu examinassem, quaedam ad justam
magnitudinem nondum excrevisse adverti. Ad
haec quasdam observavi particulas perexiles et
oblongas, alias aliis majores, et, quantum ocu∣lis
apparebat, cauda destitutas; quas quidem
particulas non nisi animalcula esse credidi, quae
ad justam magnitudinem non excrevissent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 4. p. 280. 281.</NOTE>.'
Here we have animalcules of different sizes, and
some with tails, and others that had no tails,
which better corresponds with my experiments
than with Leeuwenhoek's system. We only
differ in a single article. He considers the oblong
bodies without tails as young animalcules which
have not yet arrived at their full growth: But I,
on the contrary, have seen these pretended ani∣mals
originally spring from the filaments with
their tails or threads, which they gradually lost.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215"/>
In the same letter to Boerhaave he says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 4. p. 28.</NOTE>, that,
in the semen of a ram he observed the animal∣cules
marching in flocks like sheep: 'A tribus
circiter annis testes arietis, adhuc calentes, ad
aedes meas deferri curaveram; cum igitur ma∣teriam
ex epididymibus eductam, ope micro∣scopii
contemplarer, non sine ingenti voluptate
advertebam animalcula omnia, quotquot inna∣tabant
semini masculino, eundem natando cur∣sum
tenere, ita nimirum ut quo itinere priora
praenatarent, eodem posteriora subsequerentur,
adeo ut hisce animalculis quasi sit ingenitum,
quod oves factitare videmus, scilicet ut praece∣dentium
vestigiis grex universus incedat.' This
observation, made by Leeuwenhoek in the 1713,
and which he regarded as new and singular, is a
sufficient proof that he had never so attentively
examined the seminal fluids of animals as to en∣able
him to give exact descriptions of them. In
the 1713, he was 71 years of age: He had been
in the constant practice of making experiments
with the microscope for 45 years: He continu∣ed
to publish his observations during 36 years:
And yet, after all this practice, he now, for the
first time, observed a phaenomenon which is ex∣hibited
in every semen, and which I have de∣scribed,
Exper. IX. in the human semen, Ex∣per.
XII. in the semen of a dog, and Exper.
XXIX in the semen of a bitch. To explain the
moving of the animalcules of the ram in flocks,
<PB REF="216" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate IX.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="207" REF="217"/>
therefore, it is unnecessary to suppose them en∣dowed
with the natural instinct peculiar to sheep;
since those of man, of the dog, and of the bitch,
move in the very same manner; and since this
motion depends upon particular circumstances,
the principal of which is, that the fluid part of
the semen should be on one side, and the thick
or filamentous part on the other; for then the
whole moving bodies disengage themselves from
the filaments, and proceed, in the same direction,
into the more fluid part of the liquor.</P>
<P>In another letter, written the same year, and
addressed to Boerhaave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 4. p. 304.</NOTE>, he relates some farther
observations concerning the semen of the ram:
He tells us, that, when the liquor was put into
separate glasses and examined, he observed flocks
of animalcules moving all in the same direction,
and other flocks returning the contrary way.
He adds: 'Neque illud in unica epididymum
parte, sed et in aliis quas praecideram partibus,
observavi. Ad haec, in quadam parastatarum
resecta portione complura vidi animalcula, quae
necdum in justam magnitudinem adoleverant;
nam et corpuscula illis exiliora et caudae triplo
breviores erant quam adultis. Ad haec, caudas
non habebant desinentes in mucronem, quales
tamen adultis esse passim comperio. Practerea,
in quandam parastatarum portionem incidi, a∣nimalculis,
quantum discernere potui, destitu∣tam,
tantum illi quaedam perexiguae inerant
<PB N="208" REF="218"/>
particulae, partim longiores partim breviores;
sed altera sui extremitate crassiunculae; istas
particulas in animalcula transituras esse non du∣bitabam.'
From this passage, it is apparent that
Leeuwenhoek had seen in this seminal liquor,
what I have found in the semen of all the ani∣mals
which I examined, moving bodies that differ∣ed
in size, figure, and motion; and these cir∣cumstances,
it is obvious, correspond better with
the notion of organic particles in motion, than
with that of real animals.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that Leeuwenhoek's ob∣servations,
though he draws very different con∣clusions
from them, perfectly correspond with
mine: And, though there be some opposition in
the facts, I am fully persuaded, that, whoever
shall take the trouble of repeating the experiments,
will easily discover the source of these diffe∣rences,
and find that I have related nothing but
truth. To enable the reader to decide in this
matter, I shall add a few remarks.</P>
<P>We do not always see, in the human semen,
the filaments I have mentioned: For this pur∣pose,
the liquor must be examined the moment
it is extracted from the body; and even then
they do not uniformly appear. When the li∣quor
is too thick, it presents nothing but large
globules, which may be distinguished with a
common lens. When examined with the mi∣croscope
they have the appearance of small oran∣ges;
they are very opaque, and one of them oc∣cupies
<PB N="209" REF="219"/>
the whole field of the microscope. The
first time I observed these globules, I imagined
them to be foreign bodies which had fallen into
the liquor. But, after examining different drops,
I found that the whole liquor was composed of
these large globules. I observed one of the
largest and roundest of them for a long time.
At first it was perfectly opaque: A little after,
I perceived on its surface, about half way be∣tween
the centre and circumference, a beautiful
coloured luminous ring, which continued more
than half an hour, then gradually approached
the centre, which became clear and coloured,
while the rest of the globule remained opaque.
This light which illuminated the centre, resem∣bled
that which appears in large air-bubbles.
The globule now began to grow flat, and to
have a small degree of transparency: And, after
observing it for three hours, I could perceive no
other change, no appearance of motion, either
internal or external. I imagined that some change
might happen by mixing the liquor with water.
The globules were indeed changed into a trans∣parent
homogeneous fluid, which presented no∣thing
worthy of remark. I left the semen to
liquify of its own accord, and examined it at the
distance of 6, 12, and 24 hours; but found no∣thing
like life or motion. I relate this experi∣ment
to show, that the ordinary phaenomena
are not always to be expected in seminal fluids,
though they be apparently similar.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="220"/>
Sometimes all the moving bodies have tails,
especially in the semen of man, and of the dog;
their motion is not then very rapid, and appears
to be performed with difficulty. If the liquor
be allowed to dry, the tails or threads are first
deprived of motion; the anterior extremity con∣tinues
to vibrate for some time, and then all mo∣tion
ceases. These bodies may be long preserved
in this state; and, if a small drop of water be then
poured upon them, their figure changes; they
fall down into several minute globules, which
appear to have a small degree of motion, some∣times
approaching each other, and sometimes
trembling, and turning round their centres.</P>
<P>The moving bodies in the human semen, and
in those of the dog and bitch, resemble each o∣ther
so strongly, that it is not easy to distinguish
them, especially when examined immediately af∣ter
they are taken from the body of the animal.
Those of the rabbit appear to be smaller and
more active. But these differences and resem∣blances
proceed more from the different states
of the fluids during the time of examination,
than from the nature of the fluids themselves,
which ought indeed to be different in different
species of animals: For example, in the human
fluid, I have remarked large filaments, as repre∣sented
in Pl. 1. fig. 3. &amp;c. and I have seen the
moving bodies separate from these filaments,
from which they appeared to derive their origin.
But I could perceive nothing of this kind in the
<PB N="211" REF="221"/>
semen of the dog. In place of distinct filaments,
it is generally composed of a compact mucilage,
in which we with difficulty perceive some fila∣mentous
parts; and yet this mucilage gives
birth to moving bodies similar to those in the
human semen.</P>
<P>The motion of these bodies continues longer
in the fluid of the dog, than in that of man,
which enables us more easily to distinguish the
change of form above taken notice of. The mo∣ment
the fluid issues from the body of the ani∣mal,
we find most of the animalcules possessed
of tails. In 12, 24, or 36 hours afterwards, al∣most
the whole tails disappear; we then per∣ceive
only oval bodies moving about, and gene∣rally
with more rapidity than at first.</P>
<P>The moving bodies are always below the sur∣face
of the liquor. Several large transparent
air-bubbles commonly appear on the surface;
but they have no motion, unless when the li∣quor
is agitated. Below the moving bodies we
often perceive others still more minute: These
have no tails; but most of them move: And, in
general, I have remarked, that, of the number∣less
globules in all these liquors, the smallest are
generally blacker and more obscure than the o∣thers;
and that those which are extremely mi∣nute
and transparent have little or no motion.
They seem likewise to have more specific gravi∣ty;
for they are always sunk deepest in the
fluid.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Reflections on the preceding Experiments.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the foregoing experiments, it ap∣pears,
that females, as well as males, have
a seminal fluid containing bodies in motion;
that these moving bodies are not real animals,
but only organic living particles; and that these
particles exist not only in the seminal fluids of
both sexes, but in the flesh of animals, and in
the seeds of vegetables. To discover whether
all the parts of animals and all the seeds of plants
contained moving organic particles, I made in∣fusions
of the flesh of different animals, and of
the seeds of more than twenty different species
of vegetables; and, after remaining some days in
close glasses, I had the pleasure of seeing organic
moving particles in all of them. In some they
appeared sooner, in others later. Some preser∣ved
their motion for months, and others soon
lost it. Some, at first, produced large moving
globules, resembling animals, which changed
their figure, split, and became gradually smaller.
Others produced only small globules whose mo∣tions
were extremely rapid; and others produ∣ced
<PB N="213" REF="223"/>
filaments, which grew longer, seemed to vege∣tate,
and then swelled, and poured out torrents
of moving globules. But it is needless to give
a detail of my experiments on the infusions of
plants, especially since Mr Needham has publish∣ed
his excellent and numerous observations on
this subject. To this able naturalist I have read
over the preceding treatise; I have often rea∣soned
with him on the resemblance between the
moving bodies in infusions of the seeds of vege∣tables,
and those in the seminal fluids of male
and female animals. He thought my views well
founded, and of sufficient importance to merit a
farther discussion. He, therefore, began to
make experiments on the different parts of vege∣tables;
and I acknowledge, that he has brought
the ideas I communicated to greater perfection,
than could have been done by me. Of this I
could give many examples: But I shall confine
myself to one, because I formerly pointed out
the fact in question, which he describes in the
following manner.</P>
<P>To ascertain whether the moving bodies which
appear in infusions of flesh were real animals,
or only, as I had imagined, organic moving par∣ticles,
Mr Needham thought that an examination
of the jelly of roasted meat would determine the
question; because, if they were animals, the fire
would destroy them, and, if not, they would
still be perceptible, in the same manner as when
the flesh was raw. Having, for this purpose, ta∣ken
<PB N="214" REF="224"/>
the jellies of veal and of other kinds of roast∣ed
meat, he put them in glasses filled with water,
and carefully corked the bottles. After some days
infusion, he found in the whole of the liquors
an immense number of moving bodies. He
showed me several of these infusions, and, among
others, that of the veal jelly, which contained
moving bodies very similar to those of man, the
dog, and the bitch, after they had lost their tails
or threads. Though they changed their forms,
their motions were so similar to those of animals
swimming, that, whoever saw them for the first
time, or had been ignorant of what has been
formerly remarked concerning them, would
certainly have apprehended them to be real ani∣mals.
I shall only add, that Mr Needham has
established, by numberless experiment, the exist∣ence
of moving organic particles in all the
parts of vegetables, which confirms what I have
alledged, and extends my theory concerning the
composition and reproduction of organized be∣ings.</P>
<P>It is them apparent, that all animals, whether
male or female, and every species of vegetable,
are composed of living organic particles. These
organic particles abound most in the seminal fluids
of animals, and in the seeds of vegetables. Re∣production
is effected by the union of these or∣ganic
particles, which are detached from all
parts of the animal or vegetable body, and are
always similar to the particular species to which
<PB N="215" REF="225"/>
they belong; for their union could not be ac∣complished
but by the intervention of an inter∣nal
mould, which is the efficient cause of the
figure of the animal or vegetable, and in which
the essence, the unity, and the continuation of
the species consists, and will invariably continue
till the end of time.</P>
<P>But, before drawing general conclusions from
the system I have established, some objections
must be removed, which will contribute still
farther to illustrate the subject.</P>
<P>It will be demanded of me, why I deny these
moving bodies to be animals, after they have
uniformly been recognized as such by every man
who has examined them? It may likewise
be asked, How is it possible to conceive the na∣ture
of living organic particles, unless we allow
them to be real animals? And to suppose an a∣nimal
to be composed of lesser animals, is near∣ly
the same idea, as when we say, that an orga∣nized
body is composed of organic living par∣ticles.
To these questions, I shall endeavour to
give satisfactory answers.</P>
<P>It is true, that almost all observers agree in
regarding the moving bodies in the seminal fluid
as real animals. But it is equally certain, both
from my experiments, and those of Mr Need∣ham
upon the semen of the calmar, that these
moving bodies are beings more simple and less
organized than animals.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="226"/>
The word <HI>animal,</HI> in its common acceptation,
represents a general idea, composed of particular
ideas which we derive from particular animals.
All general ideas include many different ideas,
which more or less approach or recede from one
another; and, of course, no general idea can
be precise or exact. The general idea we have
formed of an animal, may be derived from the
particular idea of a dog, of a horse, and of other
animals, from the power of volition, which en∣ables
them to act according to their inclination,
and from the circumstances of their being com∣posed
of flesh and blood, from their faculty of
chusing and of taking nourishment, from their
senses, from the distinction of sexes, and from
their power of reproducing. The general idea,
therefore, expressed by the word <HI>animal,</HI> includes
a number of particular ideas, not one of which
constitutes the essence of the general idea: For
there are animals which have no intelligence,
no will, no progressive motion, no flesh or blood,
and appear to be only a mass of congealed mu∣cilage:
There are others, which cannot seek for
their food, and only receive it from the element
in which they exist; others have no senses, not
even that of feeling, at least in a perceptible de∣gree.
Some have no sexes, or have both in
one individual. There remains nothing, there∣fore,
in the properties of an animal, but the
power of reproduction, which is common to
both the vegetable and animal. It is from the
<PB N="217" REF="227"/>
whole taken together that a general idea is
formed; and, as this whole is composed of dif∣ferent
parts, there must of necessity be degrees
or intervals between these parts. An insect, in
this sense, is less an animal than a dog, an oyster
than an insect, and a sea-nettle, or a fresh water
polype, than an oyster: And, as Nature proceeds
by insensible degrees, we should find beings par∣taking
of still less animation than a sea-nettle or
a polype. Our general ideas are only artificial
methods of collecting a number of objects un∣der
one point of view; and they have, like o∣ther
artificial methods, the defect of not being
able to comprehend the whole. They are in
direct opposition to the procedure of Nature,
which is uniform, insensible, and always parti∣cular.
It is to grasp a number of particular
ideas under one word, of which we have no
clearer notion than that word conveys; because,
when the word is once received, we imagine it
to be a line drawn between the different pro∣ductions
of nature; that every thing above this
line is an <HI>animal,</HI> and every thing below it a <HI>ve∣getable,</HI>
which is another word equally general,
and employed as a line of separation between
organized bodies and brute matter. But, as has
already been remarked, these lines of separation
have no existence in nature. There are bodies
which are neither animals, vegetables, nor mi∣nerals,
and every attempt to arrange them un∣der
either of these classes must be ineffectual.
<PB N="218" REF="228"/>
For example, Mr Trembly, when he first exa∣mined
the fresh water polypus, spent much
time before he could determine whether it was
an animal or a vegetable. The reason is plain;
this polypus is perhaps neither the one nor the
other; and all that can be said is, that it has
most resemblance to an animal: And, as we are
inclined to think, that every living being is ei∣ther
an animal or a plant, we believe not the ex∣istence
of any organized body, unless it falls un∣der
some of these general denominations, al∣though
there must be, and in fact there are,
many beings which belong neither to the one
nor the other. The moving bodies found in
the seminal fluids, and in infusions of the flesh
of animals, as well as in those of all parts of ve∣getables,
are of this species: We can neither
rank them under animals nor vegetables; and
no man in his senses will ever maintain them to
be minerals.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, pronounce, without hesi∣tation,
that the great division of natural pro∣ductions
into <HI>animals, vegetables,</HI> and <HI>minerals,</HI>
comprehends not all material beings; since be∣ings
exist which can be included in neither of
these classes. Nature passes, by imperceptible
steps, from the animal to the vegetable; but,
from the vegetable to the mineral, the passage is
sudden, and the interval great. Here the law
of imperceptible degrees suffers a violation. This
circumstance made me suspect, that, by exami∣ning
<PB N="219" REF="229"/>
Nature more closely, we should find inter∣mediate
organized beings, which, without ha∣ving
the faculty of reproduction, like animals
and vegetables, would still enjoy a species of life
and motion; beings which, without being either
animals or vegetables, might enter into the con∣stitution
of both; and, lastly, beings which
would consist of the first assemblages of the or∣ganic
particles mentioned in the preceding
chapters.</P>
<P>Eggs constitute the first class of this species of
beings. Those of hens and other female birds
are attached to a common pedicle, and derive
their nourishment and growth from the body
of the animal. But, when attached to the ova∣rium,
they are not properly eggs; they are only
yellow globes, which separate from the ova∣rium
as soon as they acquire a certain magnitude:
Such is their internal organization, however,
that they absorb nourishment from the lymph
contained in the uterus, and convert it into the
white, membranes, and shell. Thus the egg pos∣sesses
a species of life and organization. It grows
and assumes a form by its own peculiar powers:
It neither lives like an animal, nor vegetates like
a plant, nor enjoys the faculty of reproduction.
The egg, therefore, is a distinct being, which
can neither be ranked with the animal nor mi∣neral
kingdoms. If it be alledged, that the egg
is only an animal production destined for the
nourishment of the chick, and ought to be re∣garded
<PB N="220" REF="230"/>
as a part of the hen; I reply, that eggs,
whether impregnated or not, are always organi∣zed
in the same manner; that impregnation
changes only a part which is almost invisible;
that it grows, and acquires a uniform figure and
structure, both externally and internally, inde∣pendent
of impregnation; and, consequently,
it ought to be considered as a separate and di∣stinct
being.</P>
<P>This will be still more apparent, if we attend
to the growth and formation of the eggs of
fishes. When the female deposits them in the
water, they are properly but the rudiments of
eggs, which, being lately separated from the
body of the animal, attract and assimilate those
particles that are fitted for their nourishment;
and thus increase in size by mere absorption.
In the same manner as the egg of the hen ac∣quires
its white and membranes while floating
in the uterus, the eggs of fishes acquire their
white and membranes in the water; and,
whether they are fecundated by the male's
shedding his milt upon them, or they remain un∣impregnated,
they still arrive at full perfection.
It is plain, therefore, that eggs in general ought
to be regarded as organized bodies, and forming
a distinct genus from animals and vegetables.</P>
<P>The organized bodies found in the semen of
all animals, and which, like those in the milt of
the calmar, are natural machines, and not ani∣mals,
form a second species of the same genus.
<PB N="221" REF="231"/>
They are properly the first assemblages of those
organic particles so often mentioned; and, per∣haps,
they are the constituent particles of all a∣nimated
bodies. They appear in the semen of
every animals, because the semen is only the re∣sidue
of the organic particles which the ani∣mal
takes in with its food. The particles, as
formerly remarked, assimilated from the food,
are those which are most organized, and the
most analogous to the animal itself: It is of
these particles that the semen consists; and, of
course, we ought not to be surprised to find or∣ganized
bodies in that fluid.</P>
<P>To be satisfied that these organized bodies are
not real animals, we have only to reflect upon
the preceding experiments. The moving bo∣dies
in the semen have been considered as real
animals, because they have a progressive motion,
and something similar to tails. But, after attend∣ing,
on the one hand, to the nature of this mo∣tion,
which is suddenly finished, and never again
commences, and, on the other, to the nature of
the tails, which are only threads adhering to the
moving body, we will begin to hesitate; for an
animal goes sometimes slow, and sometimes fast;
and it sometimes stops, and reposes, without
moving at all. These moving bodies, on the
contrary, go always in the same direction at the
same time; I never saw them stop and again
begin to move; and, if they once stop, it is for
ever. I demand, if this continued motion, with∣out
<PB N="222" REF="232"/>
any repose, is common to animals; and if,
from this circumstance, we ought not to doubt
concerning the real animation of these moving
bodies? An animal should always have a uni∣form
figure, as well as distinct members: But
these moving bodies change their figure every
moment; they have no distinct members; and
their tails are only adventitious matter, and no
part of the individual. How, then, can they be
esteemed real animals? In seminal liquors, we
see silaments which stretch out, and seem to ve∣getate;
then they swell and produce moving bo∣dies.
These filaments are, perhaps, of a vege∣table
nature; but the moving bodies which proceed
from them cannot be animals; for we have no
example of vegetables giving birth to animals.
Moving bodies are found in all animal and ve∣getable
substances promiscuously. They are not
the produce of generation. They have no uni∣formity
of species. They cannot, therefore, be
either animals or vegetables. As they are to be
met with in every part of animals and of vege∣tables,
but are most abundant in their seeds, is it
not natural to regard them as the organic living
particles of which animals and vegetables are
composed, as particles which, being endowed
with motion, and a species of life, ought to
produce, by their union, moving and living
beings, and, in this manner, form animals and
vegetables?</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="233"/>
But, to remove every doubt upon this subject,
let us attend to the observations of others. Can
the active machines discovered by Mr Needham
in the milt of the calmar be regarded as animals?
Can we believe that eggs, which are active ma∣chines
of another species, are also animals? If
we examine Leeuwenhoek's representations of
the moving bodies found in many different sub∣stances,
will we not be satisfied, at the first in∣spection,
that they are not animals, since none
of them have any members, but are uniformly
either round or oval? If we attend to what this
famous observer has remarked concerning the
motion of these pretended animals, we must be
convinced that he was wrong in regarding them
as real animals, and we will be more and more
confirmed in the opinion, that they are only
organic moving particles. We shall give some
examples. Leeuwenhoek<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 51.</NOTE>, gives the figure of
the moving bodies in the seminal fluid of a male
frog. This figure represents nothing but a thin,
long body, pointed at one of the extremities.
Let us attend to what he says concerning it:
'Uno tempore caput, (that is, the largest ex∣tremity
of the moving body), crassius mihi
apparebat alio; plerumque agnoscebam ani∣malculum
haud ulterius quam a capite ad
medium corpus, ob caudae tenuitatem, et cum
idem animalculum paulo vehementius move∣retur
(quod tamen tarde fiebat) quasi volumine
<PB N="224" REF="234"/>
quodam circa caput ferebatur. Corpus fere
carebat motu, cauda tamen in tres quatuorve
flexus volvebatur.' Here we have the change
of figure that I had observed, the mucilage
from which the moving bodies with difficulty
disengage themselves, the slowness of their mo∣tion
before they escape from the mucilage, and,
lastly, a part of the pretended animal in mo∣tion
while the other is dead; for, a little after∣wards,
he observes, 'movebant posteriorem so∣lum
partem, quae ultima, morti vicinia esse
judicabam.' All this is repugnant to the na∣ture
of an animal, but exactly corresponds with
my experiments, excepting that I never saw the
tail move but in consequence of an agitation of
the body. Speaking of the seminal fluid of the
cod, he says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 52.</NOTE>, 'Non est putandum omnia ani∣malcula
in semine aselli contenta uno eodem∣que
tempore vivere, sed illa potius tantum vi∣vere
quae exitui seu partui viciniora sunt, quae
et copiosiori humido innatant prae reliquis vita
carentibus, adhuc in crassa materia, quam hu∣mor
eorum efficit, jacentibus.' If these are
animals, why were they not all alive? Why
did those only live which were in the most fluid
part of the liquor? Leeuwenhoek did not observe,
that the thick part, instead of being a humor
produced by the animalcules, is a mucilage
which gives birth to them. If he had diluted
the mucilage with water, he would at once have
<PB N="225" REF="235"/>
given life and motion to the whole. The mu∣cilage
itself is often nothing else than a mass of
those bodies, which begin to move as soon as
they can disengage themselves; and, of course,
this thick matter or mucilage, instead of being
a humour produced by the animalcules, is only
a congeries of the animals themselves, or rather,
as formerly remarked, the matter of which they
are formed. Speaking of the semen of the
cock, Leeuwenhoek, in his letter to Grew, says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 5.</NOTE>,
'Contemplando materiam (seminalem) animad∣verti
ibidem tantam abundantiam viventium
animalium, ut ea stuperem; forma seu externa
figura sua nostrates anguillas fluviatiles refe∣rebant,
vehementissima agitatione movebantur;
quibus tamen substrati videbantur multi et ad∣modum
exiles globuli, item multae plan-ova∣les
figurae, quibus etiam vita posset attribui,
et quidem propter carumdem commotiones;
sed existimabam omnes hasce commotiones et
agitationes provenire ab animalculis, sicque
etiam res se habebat; attamen ego non opi∣nione
solum, sed etiam ad veritatem mihi per∣suadeo
has particulas, planam et ovalem sigu∣ram
habentes, esse quaedam animalcula inter
se ordine suo disposita et mixta, vitaque adhuc
carentia.' Here we have animalcules, in the
same seminal fluid, of different forms; and I am
convinced, from my own experiments, that, if
Leeuwenhoek had observed those oval bodies
<PB N="226" REF="236"/>
with attention, he would have perceived that
they moved with their own proper force, and,
consequently, that they were as much alive as
the others. This change of figure, it is true,
exactly corresponds with what I had observed:
But it does not indicate a uniform species of a∣nimals;
for, in the present example, if the bo∣dies
having the figure of a serpent were genuine
spermatic animalcules, each of which was destined
to become a cock, and therefore implies a uni∣form
and invariable organization, what was the
end and destination of those of an oval figure?
He, indeed, afterwards remarks, that these oval
bodies might be the same with the serpentine,
if we suppose them rolled up in a spiral manner.
But still, how is it possible to conceive that an
animal, with its body in this restrained posture,
should be able to move without extending itself?
I, therefore, maintain, that these oval bodies
were only the organic particles separated from
their threads or tails, and that the serpentine
bodies were the same particles which had not
yet been deprived of these appendages, as I have
often remarked in other seminal fluids.</P>
<P>Besides, Leeuwenhoek, who believed all these
moving bodies to be real animals, who establish∣ed
a system upon that foundation, and who af∣firmed,
that spermatic animalcules were trans∣formed
into men and other animals, now suspec∣ted
them to be only natural machines, or moving
organic particles. He never entertained a doubt,
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
but that these animalcules contained the large
animal in miniature. He remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 67.</NOTE>, 'Progene∣ratio
animalis ex animalculo in seminibus mas∣culinis
omni exceptione major est; nam, etiamsi
in animalculo ex semine masculo, unde ortum
est, figuram animalis conspicere nequeamus,
attamen satis superque certi esse possumus
figuram animalis ex qua animal ortum est,
in animalculo quod in semine masculo re∣peritur,
conclusam jacere sive esse: Et quan∣quam
mihi saepius, conspectis animalculis in
semine masculo animalis, imaginatus fue∣rim
me posse dicere, en ibi caput, en ibi
humeros, en ibi femora; attamen cum ne mi∣nima
quidem certitudine de iis judicium ferre
potuerim, hucusque certi quid statuere super∣sedeo,
donec tale animal, cujus semina mascula
tam magna erunt, ut in iis figuram creaturae
ex qua provenit agnoscere queam, invenire
secunda nobis concedat fortuna.' This op∣portunity,
so much desired by Leeuwenhoek,
happily occurred to Mr Needham. The sper∣matic
animals of the calmar are three or four
lines in length, and are visible without the assist∣ance
of the microscope. Their whole parts
and organization are easily perceived. But they
are by no means small calmars, as Leeuwen∣hoek
imagined. They are not even animated,
though they have motion, but are only machines,
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
which ought to be regarded as the first union of
the organic particles.</P>
<P>Though Leeuwenhoek had not this opportu∣nity
of undeceiving himself, he had, however,
observed other appearances which ought to have
had this effect. He had remarked, for example,
that the spermatic animals of the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 1. p. 160.</NOTE>, often
changed their figure, especially when the fluid
was nearly evaporated; that, when dead, they
had an opening in the head, which did not ap∣pear
when they were alive; and that the head
was full and round, during the life of the pre∣tended
animal, and flat and sunk after its death;
These circumstances should have led him to he∣sitate
concerning the real animation of these
bodies, and to think that the phaenomena cor∣responded
more with a machine which emptied
itself, like that of the calmar, than with the pro∣perties
of an animal.</P>
<P>I have said that the motion of these moving
bodies, these organic particles, is not similar to
the motion of animals, and that there is no in∣tervals
in their movements. Leeuwenhoek, in
tom. 1. p. 168. makes precisely the same remark:
'Quotiescunque,' says he, 'animalcula in se∣mine
masculo animalium fuerim contemplatus,
attamen illa se unquam ad quietem contulisse,
me nunquam vidisse, mihi dicendum est, si mo∣do
sat fiuidae superesset materiae in qua sese
commode movere poterant; at eadem in con∣tinuo
<PB N="229" REF="239"/>
manent motu, et tempore quo ipsis mori∣endum
appropinquante, motus magis magisque
deficit, usquedum nullus prorsus motus in illis
agnoscendus sit.' It is difficult to conceive,
that animals should exist, which, from the mo∣ment
of their birth to their dissolution, should
continue to move rapidly, without the smallest
interval of repose; or to imagine that the sper∣matic
animals of the dog, which Leeuwenhoek
perceived to be as active on the seventh day as
the moment they proceeded from the body of
the dog, should be able, during all this time, to
move with a celerity which no animal on earth
could persist in for a single hour, especially when
the resistence arising from the density and tena∣city
of the fluid is taken into consideration. This
species of continued motion, on the contrary,
has an exact corresondence to the nature of the
organic particles, which, like artificial machines,
produce their effects by a continued operation,
and stop immediately after the end is accom∣plished.</P>
<P>In the numerous experiments made by Leeu∣wenhoek,
he doubtless observed spermatic animals
without tails. He even mentions them in some
places, and endeavours to explain the phaeno∣menon.
For example, speaking of the semen
of the cod, he says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. p. 150.</NOTE>, 'Ubi vero ad lactium ac∣cederem
observationem, in iis partibus quas a∣nimalcula
esse censebam, neque vitam neque
<PB N="230" REF="240"/>
caudam dignoscere potui; cujus rei rationem
esse existimabam, quod quamdiu animalcula
natando loca sua perfecte mutare non possunt,
tam diu etiam cauda concinne circa corpus ma∣neat
ordinata, quodque ideo singula animalcula
rotundum repraesentent corpusculum.' It would
have been more simple, and more agreeable to
truth, to have said, that the spermatic animals of
this fish sometimes have tails, and sometimes
have none, than to suppose that the tails were
so exactly would round their bodies as to give
them a spherical figure. One would be apt to
think, that Leeuwenhoek had never fixed his
eyes upon, or described any moving but those
which had tails; he has given figures of none
that wanted tails, because, though they moved,
he did not regard them as animals. This is the
reason why all Leeuwenhoek's figures of sper∣matic
animals are very similar, and all drawn
with tails. When they appeared in any other
form, he thought they were imperfect, or rather
that they were dead. Besides, it is apparent from
my experiments, that, instead of unfolding their
tails, wherever they are placed in circumstances
proper for swimming, as Leeuwenhoek insists,
these pretended animals gradually lose their tails,
in proportion to the rapidity of their motions,
till, at last, these tails, which are bodies foreign
to the animalcules, or threads which they drag
after them, totally disappear.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="241"/>
Leeuwenhoek, speaking of the spermatic ani∣mals
of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 93.</NOTE>, says: 'Aliquando etiam ani∣madverti
inter animalcula particulas quasdam
minores et subrotundas; cum vero se ea aliquo∣ties
eo modo oculis meis exhibuerint, ut mihi
imaginarer eas exiguis instructas esse caudis,
cogitare coepi annon hae forte particulae fo∣rent
animalcula recens nata; certum enim mihi
est ea etiam animalcula per generationem pro∣venire,
vel ex mole minuscula ad adultam pro∣cedere
quantitatem: Et quis seit annon ea
animalcula, ubi moriuntur, aliorum animalcu∣lorum
nutritioni atque augmini inserviant!' It
appears from this passage, that Leeuwenhoek had
seen, in the human semen, animalcules without
tails; and that he is obliged to suppose them to
be recently born, which is directly the reverse
of what I have observed; for the moving bodies
are never larger than when they separate from
the filaments, which is the period that their mo∣tion
begins: But, as soon as they are fully disen∣gaged
from the mucilage, they become smaller,
and continue to diminish till their motion entire∣ly
ceases. With regard to the generation of these
animals, which Leeuwenhoek imagines to be cer∣tain,
no vestige of copulation has been discerned
by the most acute observers. It is purely a ran∣dom
assertion, as may be easily proved from his
own experiments. He remarks, for example,
<PB N="232" REF="242"/>
with great propriety, that the milt of the cod<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 98.</NOTE>
is gradually filled with seminal liquor; and that,
after the fish has spent this liquor, the milt dries,
and leaves only a flaccid membrane, entirely
destitute of every kind of fluid. 'Eo tempore,'
says he, 'quo asellus major lactes suos emisit, rugae
illae, seu tortiles lactium partes, usque adeo con∣trahuntur,
ut nihil praeter pelliculas seu membra∣nas
esse videantur.' How should this dry mem∣brane,
which contains neither seminal liquor nor
animalcules, produce animalcules of the same spe∣cies
next season? If they were produced by a re∣gular
generation, such a long interruption could
not take place, which, in most fishes, continues
a whole year. To remove this difficulty, he af∣terwards
remarks: 'Necessario statuendum erit,
ut asellus major semen suum emiserit, in lacti∣bus
etiamnum multum materiae seminalis gig∣nendis
animalculis aptae remansisse, ex qua ma∣teria
plura oportet provenire animalcula semi∣nalia
quam anno proxime elapso emissa fuerant.'
This supposition, that part of the seminal liquor
remains in the milt for the production of sper∣matic
animals the following year, is perfectly
gratuitous, and contrary to observation; for the
milt, during this interval, is nothing but a thin
dry membrane. But how will he explain a
phaenomenon that takes place in some fishes, and
particularly in the calmar, whose seminal liquors
are not only renewed every year, but even the
<PB N="233" REF="243"/>
membranes which contain them. Here neither
the milt nor the seminal liquor are preserved till
the succeeding year; and, of course, their regular
reproduction cannot be ascribed to generation.
It is, therefore, apparent, that these pretended
spermatic animals are not multiplied, like other
animals, by generation; and this circumstance
alone would entitle us to conclude, that the mo∣ving
particles in the seminal fluid are not real
animals. Leeuwenhoek, though he tells us, in
the passage above quoted, that the spermatic a∣nimals
are certainly propagated by generation,
acknowledges, however, in another place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 26.</NOTE>, that
the manner in which these spermatic animals are
produced, is exceedingly obscure, and that he
leaves to others the farther elucidation of this
subject. 'Persuadebam mihi,' says he, speaking
of the spermatic animals of the dormouse, 'haecce
animalcula ovibus prognasci, quia diversa in
orbem jacentia et in semet convoluta videbam;
sed unde, quaeso, primam illorum originem de∣rivabimus!
an animo nostro concipiemus ho∣rum
animalculorum semen jam procreatum
esse in ipsa generatione, hocque semen tam diu
in testiculis hominum haerere, usquedum ad
annum aetatis decimum-quartum vel decimum-quintum
aut sextum pervenerint, eademque
animalcula tum demum vita donari, vel in
justam staturam excrevisse, illoque temporis
articulo generandi maturitatem adesse! sed haec
<PB N="234" REF="244"/>
lampada aliis trado.' It is, perhaps, unneces∣sary
to make many remarks on what Leeuwen∣hoek
has here advanced. He saw, in the semen
of the dormouse, spermatic animals which were
round and without tails; <HI>in semet convoluta,</HI>
says he, because he always supposes that they
ought to have tails. He was formerly certain
that these animals were propagated by genera∣tion:
Here he seems to be convinced of the re∣verse.
But, when he learned, that the vine∣fretters
(<HI>pucerons</HI>) were propagated without co∣pulation
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 499. et tom. 3. p. 271.</NOTE>, he laid hold of this idea, in order to
explain the generation of spermatic animals.
'Quemadmodum,' says he, 'animalcula haec
quae pediculorum antea nomine designavimus
(the pucerons) dum adhuc in utero materno
latent, jam praedita sunt materia seminali ex
qua ejusdem generis proditura sunt animalcula,
pari ratione cogitare licet animalcula in semi∣nibus
masculinis ex animalium testiculis non
migrare, seu ejici, quin post se relinquant mi∣nuta
animalcula, aut saltem materiam semina∣lem
ex qua iterum alia ejusdem generis ani∣malcula
proventura sunt, idque absque coitu,
eadem ratione qua supradicta animalcula ge∣nerari
observavimus.' This supposition is not
more satisfactory than the preceding; for, by
thus comparing the generation of spermatic a∣nimalcule
with that of the vine-fretter, we dis∣cover
not the reason why they are never seen in
<PB N="235" REF="245"/>
the human semen till the age of 14 or 15; nor
do we learn whence they proceed, or how they
are yearly renewed in fishes, &amp;c. Notwith∣standing
all the efforts of Leeuwenhoek to esta∣blish
the generation of spermatic animals, he
leaves the subject in the greatest obscurity, where
it probably would have for ever remained, if
we had not discovered, by the preceding expe∣riments,
that they are not animals, but organic
moving particles, contained originally in the
food, and found in vast numbers in the seminal
liquors of animals, which are the most pure and
most organic extracts derived from the food.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek acknowledges, that he did not
always find animalcules in the male semen; for
example, in that of the cock, which he often
examined, he never but once saw the eel-like
animalcules: And, some years after, he could
not discover these eels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 3. p. 370.</NOTE>, but found animalcules
with a large head and a tail, which his drawer
could not perceive. He likewise remarks, that,
during one season, he could not discover living
animals in the seminal fluid of the cod<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 306.</NOTE>. All
these disappointments proceeded from this cir∣cumstance,
that, though he saw moving glo∣bules,
he was unwilling to acknowledge them to
be animals, unless they had tails, though it is in
the form of globules that they most generally
appear, either in seminal fluids, or in infusions
<PB N="236" REF="246"/>
of animal and vegetables substances. In the
same place, he remarks, that, though he had of∣ten
distinctly seen the spermatic animals of the
cod, he was never able to make his drawer per∣ceive
them: 'Non solum,' says he, 'ob eximi∣am
eorum exilitatem, sed etiam quod eorum
corpora adeo essent fragilia, ut corpuscula pas∣sim
dirumperentur; unde factum fuit ut non∣nisi
raro, nec sine attentissima observatione, ani∣madverterem
particulas planas atque ovorum
in morem longas, in quibus ex parte caudas
dignoscere licebat; particulas has oviformes ex∣istimavi
animalcula esse dirupta, quod particu∣lae
hae diruptae quadruplo fere viderentur
majores corporibus animalculorum vivorum.'
When an animal, whatever be its species, dies, it
does not suddenly change its form; from being
long like a thread, it does not become round like a
bullet; neither does it become four times as
large after death as before it. Not a single ar∣ticle
of what is advanced by Leeuwenhoek, in
this passage, has the smallest correspondence to
the nature of an animal; but, on the contrary,
the whole agrees with a species of machines
which, like those of the calmar, burst and empty
themselves, after having performed their func∣tions.
To pursue this observation a little fur∣ther:
He tells us, that he has seen the spermatic
animals of the cod under different forms, 'Mul∣ta
apparebant animalcula sphaeram pellucidam
repraesentantia, and of different sizes,' 'Haec
<PB N="237" REF="247"/>
animalcula minori videbantur mole, quam ubi
eadem antehac in tubo vitreo rotundo exami∣naveram.'
This is an evident proof, that there
is nothing like a uniform and invariable species
in these animalcules, and, consequently, that they
are not animals, but only organic moving par∣ticles,
which, by their different combinations,
assume various figures and sizes. Of these or∣ganic
particles, vast numbers appear in the ex∣tract
and in the residue of our food. The mat∣ter
which adheres to the teeth, and which, in
healthy persons, has the same smell with the se∣minal
fluid, is only a residue of our food. In it
we accordingly find a great quantity of these
pretended animals, some of which have tails,
and resemble those of the seminal fluid. Mr
Baker has given figures of four species of them,
which are all a kind of cylinders, ovals, or glo∣bules,
some of them having tails, and others not.
But, after the strictest examination, I am per∣suaded,
that none of them are real animals, and
that they are only, like those in the semen, the
organic living particles of the food appearing
under different forms. Leeuwenhoek, who
knew not how to account for these pretended
animals in the matter adhering to the teeth, sup∣poses
them to proceed from certain species of
food, as cheese, in which they previously exist∣ed;
but they are found among the teeth of e∣very
person, whatever kind of food be eaten;
and, besides, they have no resemblance to mites,
<PB N="238" REF="248"/>
or other animalcules which appear in corrupted
cheese. In another place, he tells us that these
teeth-animals proceed from the cistern-water
which we drink, because he observed similar ani∣mals
in rain-water, especially when it had stag∣nated
upon leaden roofs. But, when we give
the history of microscopic animals, we shall de∣monstrate,
that most of those found in rain-water
are only organic moving particles, which divide,
unite, change their size and figure, and, in a word,
which can be made to move or to rest, to live
or die, as often as we please.</P>
<P>Most seminal fluids spontaneously dilute, or be∣come
more liquid, when exposed to the air, or to
a certain degree of cold, than when they issue
from the body. But they thicken upon the ap∣plication
of a moderate degree of heat. I expo∣sed
some of these fluids to a degree of cold equal
to that of water just beginning to freeze; but the
pretended animalcules suffered not the least in∣jury
from it. They moved with equal activity,
and during the same length of time, as those to
which no cold had been applied. But those which
were exposed to a small degree of heat, soon
ceased to move, because the liquor thickened.
If those moving bodies were animals, they dif∣fered
in their nature and constitution from all o∣thers,
to whom a moderate degree of heat com∣municates
force and motion, and upon whose
bodies cold has the very opposite effects.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="249"/>
Before leaving this subject, upon which I
have, perhaps, dwelt too long, I must still add
another remark, which may lead to some use∣ful
conclusions. These pretended spermatic
animals, which are nothing but the organic
living particles of food, exist, not only in
the seminal fluids of both sexes, and in the
remnants of food that adhere to the teeth, but
likewise in the chyle and in the excrements.
Leeuwenhoek, having met with them in the ex∣crements
of frogs, and of other animals which
he dissected, was at first greatly surprised; and,
not being able to conjecture from whence ani∣mals
could proceed so similar to those in the se∣minal
liquor he had just been examining, he
accuses his own want of dexterity, and supposes,
that, in diffecting the animal, he had inadver∣tantly
opened the seminal vessels, and that the
semen had in this manner been mixed with the
faeces. But, having afterwards observed the
same phaenomenon in the faeces of other ani∣mals,
and even in his own, he was then totally
non-plussed. It is worthy of remark, that
Leeuwenhoek never found animalcules in his
own faeces, but when they were liquid. When∣ever
his stomach was out of order, and his belly
was loose, the animalcules appeared; but, when
his food was properly concocted, and his faeces
were hard, not a single animalcule was to be
found, although he diluted the faeces with wa∣ter.
These facts seem perfectly to coincide
<PB N="240" REF="250"/>
with what we formerly advanced; for, when
the stomach and intestines properly perform
their functions, the faeces are only the gross
dregs of the aliment, and all the nourishing and
organic particles are absorbed by the lacteal ves∣sels:
In this case, we cannot expect to find or∣ganic
particles in the faeces, which are solely
composed of the useless and inert part of our
food. But, when the stomach and intestines,
from any indisposition, allow the food to pass
without being properly digested, then the orga∣nic
particles mix with the faeces; and, when
examined with the microscope, we discover
them in the form of living organic bodies. Hence
we may conclude, that people who are troubled
with looseness should have less seminal liquor,
and be less fitted for the purposes of generation,
than those of a contrary habit of body.</P>
<P>I have all along supposed that the female fur∣nishes
a fluid equally necessary to generation as
that of the male. In the first chapter, I endea∣voured
to prove, that every organized body con∣tains
living organic particles; and, in Chap. II.
and III. that nutrition and reproduction are ef∣fects
of the same cause; that nutrition is per∣formed
by absorption, or an intimate penetration
of organic particles through all parts of the
body; and that reproduction is effected by the
superplus of these same organic particles, col∣lected
from every part of the body, and deposit∣ed
in reservoirs destined for that purpose. In
<PB N="241" REF="251"/>
Chap. IV. I have shown how this theory applies
to the generation of man, and other animals
which have different sexes. Females being orga∣nized
bodies, as well as males, they must also
have some reservoirs for the reception of the
surplus of organic particles returned from all
parts of their bodies. This surplus, as it is ex∣tracted
from every part of the body, must ap∣pear
in the form of a fluid; and it is this sluid
to which I have given the appellation of the fe∣male
semen.</P>
<P>This fluid is not inert, as Aristotle pretends,
but prolific, and equally essential to generation
as the semen of the male. It contains particles
distinctive of the female sex, as that of the other
sex contains particles proper for the constitution
of male organs; and each of them contain all
the other organic particles which may be re∣garded
as common to both sexes: And hence,
from a mixture of the two, the son may resem∣ble
his mother, and the daughter her father.
Hippocrates maintains, that the semen consists
of two fluids, one strong, which produces males,
and the other weak, which produces females.
But, as the seminal fluid is extracted from every
part of the body, it is impossible to conceive how
the body of a female should produce particles
proper for the formation of male organs.</P>
<P>This liquor must enter, by some way or other,
into the uterus of viviparous animals; and, in
oviparous animals, it must be absorbed by the
<PB N="242" REF="252"/>
eggs, which may be regarded as portable ma∣trixes.
Each of these matrixes, or eggs, con∣tains
a small drop of the female fluid, in that
part which is called the cicatrice. This prolific
drop, when the female has had no communica∣tion
with the male, assumes, as Malpighius ob∣serves,
the form of a mole or inorganic mass;
but, when it is penetrated by the semen of the
male, it produces a foetus, which is nourished
and brought to perfection by the juices of the
egg.</P>
<P>Eggs, therefore, instead of being common to
all females, are only instruments employed by
nature for supplying the place of uteri in those
animals which are deprived of this organ. Instead
of being active and essential to the first impreg∣nation,
eggs are only passive or accidental parts,
destined for the nourishment of the foetus al∣ready
formed in a particular part of this matrix
by the mixture of the male and female semen.
Instead of existing from the creation, and each
including within itself an infinity of males and
females, eggs, on the contrary, are bodies com∣posed
of a superfluous part of the food, which
is more gross, and less organic, than that of
which the seminal fluid consists. The egg, in
oviparous females, answers the same purposes
as the uterus and menstrual flux in the vivipa∣rous.</P>
<P>To evince that eggs are only destined by na∣ture
to supply the place of an uterus in such ani∣mals
<PB N="243" REF="253"/>
as are deprived of this organ, we have on∣ly
to consider, that females produce eggs inde∣pendent
of the male. The uterus, in viviparous
animals, is a part peculiar to the female sex;
in the same manner, female fowls, who want
this organ, have the defect amply supplied by
the successive production of eggs, which neces∣sarily
exist in these females, independent of all
communication with the male. To pretend that
the foetus pre-existed in the egg, and that eggs
are contained, <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> within each other,
is equally ridiculous as to maintain that the
foetus pre-existed in the uterus, and that the
uterus of the first female contained all the uteri
that ever were or will be produced.</P>
<P>Anatomists have applied the term <HI>egg</HI> to
things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very opposite natures. Harvey, in
his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Omnia ex ovo,</HI> by the word <HI>egg,</HI>
when applied to oviparous animals, means only
the bag which includes the foetus and all its
appendages. He imagined that he perceived
the formation of this egg or bag immediately
after the junction of the male and female. But
this egg proceeded not from the ovarium of the
female: He even asserts, that he could not di∣stinguish
the smallest alteration in the ovarium.
It is apparent, that there is not here the most
distant analogy to what is commonly understood
by the word <HI>egg,</HI> unless, perhaps, the figure of
the bag might have some faint resemblance to
that of an egg. Harvey, though he dissected
<PB N="244" REF="254"/>
many viviparous females, never could perceive
any change in their ovaria: He even regards
them as glands totally unconnected with the
purposes of generation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Harvey, Exercit. 64. and 65.</NOTE>, though, as we have
seen, they undergo very considerable changes.
This able anatomist was deceived by the small∣ness
of the glandular bodies in animals of the
deer kind, to which his researches were princi∣pally
confined. Conradus Peyerus, who made
many observations on the testicles of female
deers, remarks, 'Exigui quidem sunt damarum
testiculi, sed post coitum foecundum, in alter∣utro
eorum, papilla, sive tuberculum fibrosum,
semper succrescit; scrofis autem praegnanti∣bus
tanta accidit testiculorum mutatio, ut me∣diocrem
quoque attentionem fugere nequeat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Conrad. Peyer. Merycolog.</NOTE>.'
This author ascribes, with propriety, the reason
why Harvey observed no changes in the testicles
of the deer, to their smallness. But he is wrong
when he tells us, that the changes he had re∣marked,
and which had escaped Harvey, never
happened but after impregnation.</P>
<P>Harvey was deceived in several other essential
articles. He insists, that the semen never enters
into the uterus, and that it is impossible for it to
find admittance; and yet Verheyen found a
great quantity of male semen in the uterus of a
cow, which he dissected six hours after copula∣tion
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Verheyen, sup. anat. tra. 5. cap. 3.</NOTE>. The celebrated Ruysch informs us, that,
<PB N="245" REF="255"/>
in dissecting a woman who had been killed im∣mediately
after the act of adultery, he found a
considerable quantity of male semen, not only
in the uterus, but in the Fallopian tubes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ruysch Thes. anat. p. 90. tab. VI. fig. 1.</NOTE>. Valis∣nieri
likewise assures us, that Fallopius, and other
anatomists, had discovered male semen in the u∣teri
of several women. This point, therefore,
though denied by Harvey, is established by the
positive testimony of several able anatomists, and
particularly by Leeuwenhoek, who found male
semen in the uteri of many different species of
females.</P>
<P>Harvey mentions an abortion, in the second
month, as large as a pigeon's egg, without any
appearance of a foetus. In this also he must
have been deceived; for Ruysch, and several o∣ther
anatomists, maintain, that the foetus is di∣stinguishable
by the naked eye, even in the first
month of pregnancy. In the History of the
French Academy, we have an account of a foe∣tus
compleatly formed on the twenty-first day
after impregnation. If, to these authorities, we
add that of Malpighius, who distinguished the
chick in the cicatrice immediately after the
egg issued from the body of the hen, we cannot
hesitate in pronouncing that the foetus is form∣ed
immediately after copulation; and, conse∣quently,
no credit is due to what Harvey says
concerning the increase of the parts by juxta-po∣sition;
since these parts exist from the beginning,
<PB N="246" REF="256"/>
and gradually expand till the foetus be perfectly
mature.</P>
<P>Graaf differs widely from Harvey in his ac∣ceptation
of the word <HI>egg.</HI> He maintains, that
the female testicles are real ovaria, and contain
eggs similar to those of oviparous animals, only
that they are much smaller, never fall out of the
body, nor detach themselves till after impregna∣tion,
when they descend from the ovarium into
the uterus. The experiments of Graaf have
contributed more to the belief of the existence of
eggs, than those of any other anatomist. They
are, notwithstanding, totally void of foundation;
for this celebrated author, in the first place, mi∣stakes
the vesicles of the ovarium for eggs, though
they are inseparable from the ovarium, form a
part of its substance, and are filled with a species
of lymph. 2. He is still more deceived, when
he informs us, that the glandular bodies are on∣ly
the coverings of these eggs or vesicles; for it
is certain, from the observations of Malpighius
and of Valisnieri, and from my own experi∣ments,
that the glandular bodies contain no ve∣sicles.
3. He is wrong in maintaining that the
glandular bodies never appear till after impreg∣nation.
On the contrary, these bodies are uni∣formly
found in all females, after the age of
puberty. 4. He errs in supposing that the glo∣bules
which he saw in the uterus, and which con∣tained
the foetuses, were the very vesicles that
had descended from the ovarium into the uterus,
<PB N="247" REF="257"/>
and that, he remarks, had become ten times
smaller than when they were in the ovarium.
This circumstance alone of their diminished size
should have convinced him of his mistake. 5.
He is not less unfortunate in maintaining that
the glandular bodies are only the coverings of
the fecundated eggs, and that the number of co∣verings
or empty follicles always correspond
to the number of foetuses. This assertion is the
reverse of truth; for, on the testicles of all fe∣males,
we uniformly find a greater number of
glandular bodies, or cicatrices, than of foetuses
actually produced; and they even appear in
those which never brought forth. To this we may
add, that neither he, Verheyen, nor any other
person, ever saw the egg in this pretended co∣vering,
or in its follicle, though they have thought
proper to rest their system upon that supposi∣tion.</P>
<P>Malpighius, who distinguished the growth of
the glandular bodies in the female testicle, was
deceived when he imagined that he once or twice
discovered the egg in their cavities; for this ca∣vity
contains only a fluid; besides, after number∣less
experiments, no man has ever been able to
discover any thing that had the most distant re∣semblance
to an egg.</P>
<P>Valisnieri, who is never deceived with regard
to facts, is wrong in maintaining that the egg
must exist in the glandular body, though neither
<PB N="246" REF="258"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="247" REF="259"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="248" REF="260"/>
he, nor any man else, was ever able to discover
it.</P>
<P>Let us now attend to what may be esteemed
the real discoveries of these anatomists. Graaf
was the first who discovered that the testicles of
females suffered any change; and he was right
in maintaining that they were parts essentially
necessary to generation. Malpighius demonstra∣ted,
that the glandular bodies gradually grew to
maturity, and that, immediately after, they were
obliterated, and left behind them only a slight
cicatrice. Valisnieri illustrated this subject still
farther. He discovered that these glandular
bodies were found in the testicles of all females;
that they were considerably augmented in the
season of love; that they increased at the ex∣pence
of the lymphatic vesicles of the testicle;
and that, during the time of their maturity, they
were hollow and full of liquor. These are all
the truths we have learned concerning the pre∣tended
ovaria and eggs of viviparous animals:
What conclusions are we to draw from them?
Two things appear to be evident: The one, that
no eggs exist in the testicles of females; the o∣ther,
that there is a fluid both in the vesicles of
the testicle, and in the cavity of the glandular
bodies; and we have demonstrated, in the pre∣ceding
experiments, that this last fluid is the true
female semen, because it contains, like that of the
male, spermatic animals, or rather organic par∣ticles
in motion.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="261"/>
The seminal fluid of females, therefore, be∣ing
thus fully ascertained, after what has been
said, we must be satisfied that the seminal fluid
in general is the superfluous organic part of our
food, which is transmitted from all parts of the
body to the testicles and seminal vessels of males,
and to the testicles and glandular bodies of fe∣males.
This liquor, which issues through the
nipples of the glandular bodies, perpetually be∣dews
the Fallopian tubes, and may casily find
admission into them, either by absorption, or by
the small aperture at their extremity, and in this
manner may descend into the uterus. But, on
the supposition of the existence of eggs, which
are ten or twenty times larger than the aperture
of the tubes, it is impossible to conceive the pos∣sibility
of their being transmitted to the uterus.</P>
<P>The liquor shed by females in the paroxysm
of love, which Graaf supposes to proceed from
lacunae about the neck of the uterus and the o∣rifice
of the urethra, may be a portion of the
superfluous fluid that continually distills from the
glandular bodies upon the Fallopian tubes. But
perhaps this liquor may be a secretion of a dif∣ferent
kind, and no way connected with gene∣ration.
To decide this question, microscopic
observations would be necessary; but <HI>all</HI> expe∣riments
are not permitted even to philosophers.
I am inclined to think, that, in this liquor, the
same spermatic animals, or moving bodies, would
be found as appear in the fluid of the glandular
<PB N="250" REF="262"/>
bodies. Upon this subject, I might quote the
authority of an Italian physician, who had an
opportunity of trying this experiment, which is
thus related by Valisnieri<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE>: 'Aggiugne il lo∣dato
sig. Bono d'avergli anco veduti (animali
spermatici) in questa linfa o siero, diro cosi
voluttuoso, che nel tempo dell' amorosa zuffa
scappa dalle femine libidinose, senza che si po∣tesse
sospettare che fossero di que' del maschio,'
&amp;c. If the fact be genuine, as I have no rea∣son
to doubt, it is certain that this liquor is the
same with that contained in the glandular bodies,
and, of course, that it is a real seminal fluid,
which escapes through the lacunae of Graaf, si∣tuated
about the neck of the uterus.</P>
<P>Hence we may conclude, that the most libidi∣nous
females will be the least fruitful, because
they throw out of the body that fluid which
ought to remain in the uterus for the formation
of the foetus. We likewise learn why common
prostitutes seldom conceive; and why women
in warm climates, who have more ardent desires
than those of colder regions, are less fertile.
But of this we shall afterwards have occasion to
treat.</P>
<P>It is natural to imagine that the seminal fluid
of either sex should not be fertile, unless when it
contains moving bodies. But this point is still
undetermined. The Italian physician, mentioned
above, alledges, that he never found spermatic
<PB REF="263" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate X.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="251" REF="264"/>
animals in his semen till he arrived at 40 years,
although he was the father of many children,
and continued, after the animalcules appeared,
to beget more.</P>
<P>The spermatic moving bodies may be regarded
as the first assemblages of the organic particles
which proceed from all parts of the body; and,
when a great number of them unite, they become
perceptible by means of the microscope. But,
when the number united is small, the body they
form is too minute to be visible, and no motion
will appear in the seminal fluid, a case which not
unfrequently happens. But a long train of suc∣cessive
experiments would be necessary to ascer∣tain
the causes of the different states in which
this fluid appears.</P>
<P>Of one thing I am certain, from repeated tri∣als,
that a seminal liquor, though no motion can
be perceived when it is first taken from the bo∣dy,
after being three or four days infused in
water, produces as great a number of organic
moving particles, as another semen, treated in
the same manner, which at first contained vast
multitudes. These moving bodies appear like∣wise
in infusions of the blood, of the chyle,
of the flesh, and even of the urine, as well as in
infusions of all parts of vegetables; and those which
appear in all these different substances, seem to
have nothing peculiar to them. They all move
and act nearly in the same manner. If we will
have these bodies to be animated, it must be al∣lowed,
<PB N="252" REF="265"/>
that they are very imperfect, and ought
to be regarded only as the rudiments of animals,
or rather as bodies composed of particles essen∣tial
to the existence of animals. As Nature's
productions are uniform, and advance by imper∣ceptible
degrees, there is no improbability in
supposing the existence of organized bodies which
properly belong not either to the animal or ve∣getable
kingdoms.</P>
<P>However this matter may stand, it is fully a∣scertained,
that all animal and vegetable sub∣stances
contain an infinite number of living or∣ganic
particles. These particles successively as∣sume
different forms, and different degrees of
activity, according to different circumstances.
They are more abundant in the seminal fluids of
both sexes, and in the seeds of plants, than in a∣ny
other part of the animal or vegetable. There
exists, therefore, in vegetables and animals, a li∣ving
substance which is common to them both;
and this substance is the matter necessary to their
nutrition. The animal is nourished by vegeta∣ble
or animal substances; and the vegetable is
nourished by the same substances in a decompo∣sed
state. This common nutritive substance is
always alive and active. It produces an animal
or a vegetable, whenever it finds an internal
mould or matrix accommodated to the one or
the other, as has already been explained. But,
when this active substance is collected too abun∣dantly
in a place where it has an opportunity of
<PB N="253" REF="266"/>
uniting, it forms, in the animal body, other li∣ving
creatures, as the tape-worm, the ascarides,
the worms sometimes found in the veins, in the
sinuses of the brain, in the liver, &amp;c. Animals
of this kind owe not their existence to the ge∣neration
of individuals of the same species. It
is, therefore, natural to think, that they are
produced by an extravasation of the organic
matter, or by an inability in the lacteal vessels
to absorb the quantity of it presented to them.
But we shall afterwards have occasion to exa∣mine
more in detail the nature of these worms,
and of other animals which are produced in a
similar manner.</P>
<P>When this organic matter, which may be con∣sidered
as an universal semen, is assembled in
great quantities, as in the seminal fluids, and in
the mucilaginous part of the infusions of plants,
its first effect is to vegetate, or rather to produce
vegetating beings. These zoophytes swell, ex∣tend,
ramify, and then produce globular, oval,
and other small bodies of different figures, all of
which enjoy a species of animal life; they have
a progressive motion, which is sometimes very
rapid, and sometimes more slow. The globules
themselves decompose, change their figure, and
become smaller; and, in proportion as they di∣minish
in size, the rapidity of their motion in∣creases.</P>
<P>I have sometimes imagined, that the venom of
the viper, and even the poison of enraged ani∣mals,
<PB N="254" REF="267"/>
might proceed from this active matter be∣ing
too much exalted. But I have not yet had
leisure for experiments of this kind, nor for a∣scertaining
the nature of different drugs. All I
can say at present is, that infusions of the most
active drugs abound with moving bodies, and
that they appear sooner in them than in other
substances.</P>
<P>Almost all microscopic animals are of the same
nature with the moving bodies in the seminal
fluids, and in infusions of animal and vegetable
substances. The eels in paste, in vinegar, &amp;c.
are all of the same nature, and derived from the
same origin. But the proofs and illustrations
relative to this subject, we shall reserve till we
give the particular history of microscopic a∣nimals.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Varieties in the Generation of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>THE nutrition and the reproduction of a∣nimals
and of vegetables, are thus effected
by the same matter. It is a substance universal∣ly
prolific, and composed of organic particles,
the union of which gives rise to all organized
bodies. Nature always works on the same stock,
and this stock is inexhaustible. But the means
she employs to give it value are various; and
these general varieties and affinities merit the at∣tention
of philosophers, because from them we
are enabled to account for particular exceptions
to the common plan of her operations.</P>
<P>In general, large animals are less prolific than
small ones. The whale, the elephant, the rhi∣noceros,
the horse, man, &amp;c. produce but one,
and very rarely two, at a birth. But small ani∣mals,
as rats, herrings, and insects, produce a
great number. Does this difference proceed
from the greater quantity of nourishment ne∣cessary
to support the large animals than the
small, and from the former having a less pro∣portional
quantity of superfluous nutritive par∣ticles,
<PB N="256" REF="269"/>
capable of being converted into semen,
than the former? It is certain, that the small
animals eat more, in proportion to their bulk,
than the large. But it is likewise probable, that
the prodigious increase of the smaller animals,
as bees, flies, and other insects, may be owing
to the extreme fineness and delicacy of their or∣gans
and members, by which they are enabled
to select the most substantial and most organic
parts of the animals and vegetables, from which
they extract their nourishment. A bee, which
lives upon the purest and most refined parts of
flowers, receives from its food a greater propor∣tional
quantity of organic particles than a horse,
who feeds upon hay, straw, and the grosser parts
of vegetables. The horse, accordingly, produ∣ces
but one at a time, while the bee produces
many thousands. The oviparous animals are,
in general, smaller than the viviparous, and they
are likewise much more prolific. The long time
that the foetus remains in the uterus of vivipa∣rous
animals, is another obstacle to multiplica∣tion:
During gestation, and the suckling of the
young, no new generation can take place. But
the oviparous animals, which produce, at the
same time, both uterus and foetus, and throw
them out of the body, are almost perpetually in
a condition to reproduce; and it is well known,
that, if a hen be prevented from sitting, and be
fully fed, the number of her eggs may be great∣ly
increased. If hens lay not while they brood,
<PB N="257" REF="270"/>
it is because they cease to eat; and for this pur∣pose
they leave not their nests but once a day,
and even then for a very short time, lest their
eggs should be injured by the cold. During this
operation, they take not above one tenth part of
their ordinary nourishment.</P>
<P>Animals which produce but one at a birth, ac∣quire
nearly their full growth before they are fit
for generating. But those which produce many,
generate before they are half grown. Man, the
horse, the ass, the sheep, are incapable of gene∣ration
till after they have nearly acquired the
greatest part of their growth. It is the same
with pigeons and other birds that lay but a small
number of eggs: But those that are more pro∣lific,
as cocks and hens, fishes, &amp;c. begin to ge∣nerate
much sooner. A cock is capable of this
operation at the age of three months, when he
is not above one third of his full size. A fish,
which, in 20 years, will weigh 30 pounds, ge∣nerates
the first or second year, when it weighs
not, perhaps, more than half a pound. But ex∣periments
are still wanting to ascertain the growth
and duration of fishes: Their age may be dis∣covered
by examining with a microscope the an∣nual
rings or strata of which their scales are
composed. But we are ignorant how far this
may extend. I have seen, in the Count de
Maurepas' ponds, carps which were well attested
to be at least 150 years old, and they appeared
to be equally active and lively as common carps.
<PB N="258" REF="271"/>
I will not say with Leeuwenhoek, that fishes
are immortal, or, at least, that they cannot die
of old age. Every thing, in time, must perish.
Whatever has an origin, a birth, or commence∣ment,
must arrive at a termination or death.
But fishes, by living in a uniform element, and
being sheltered from the injurious vicissitudes of
the air, must continue longer in the same state
than other animals, especially if these vicissitudes,
as Bacon remarks, be the chief causes of the
destruction of animated beings. But the prin∣cipal
cause of the longevity of fishes is, that their
bones are softer than those of other animals, and
do not perceptibly harden with age. The bones
of fishes lengthen, and turn thick without ac∣quiring
more solidity. But the density of the
bones of other animals continually increases;
and, when their interstices are completely filled
and obstructed, the circulation of their fluids
ceases, and death ensues. But, in the bones of
fishes, this augmentation of solidity, which is the
natural cause of death, proceeds in such an im∣perceptible
manner, that they must live very
long before they can feel any of the effects of
old age.</P>
<P>All quadrupeds covered with hair are vivipa∣rous,
and those covered with scales are ovipa∣rous.
The close texture of the shells or scales
of oviparous animals prevents them from losing
so much matter by transpiration, as makes its
way through the porous skins of the viviparous.
<PB N="259" REF="272"/>
May not this retention of superfluous nourish∣ment,
which cannot escape by transpiration, be
one reason of the extraordinary fertility of these
animals, and of their being able to subsist a long
time without food? All birds and flying insects
are oviparous, except some species of flies which
produce their young alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Leeuwenhoek, tom. 4. p. 91.</NOTE>. These have no
wings immediately after their birth; but they
gradually shoot out as the animal advances in
growth; and they are not in a condition to be
used till it acquires full maturity. All shell∣fishes
are viviparous; and likewise those reptiles
that have no feet, as snakes and serpents; they
change their skins, which are composed of small
scales. The viper is but a slight objection to
this general rule; for it is not properly vivipa∣rous.
It first produces eggs, from which the
young are hatched: This operation is indeed
carried on and compleated in the body of the
mother; and, in place of laying the eggs, like
other oviparous animals, the viper hatches them
within the body. The salamander, in which, as
Maupertuis remarks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad, année 1727, p. 32.</NOTE>, both eggs and young are
found at the same time, is a similar exception in
oviparous quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Most animals are multiplied and perpetuated
by copulation. But many animals, as the great∣est
number of birds, propagate rather by a kind
of compression, than a proper copulation. Some
<PB N="260" REF="273"/>
birds, indeed, as the ostrich, the male duck, &amp;c.
have considerable members, and propagate by a
real intromission. Male fishes approach the fe∣males
in the season of spawning. They seem
to rub their bellies against each other; for the
male often turns on his back to meet the belly
of the female. But no actual copulation takes
place. The part necessary for this operation
does not exist; and the males only approach the
females for the purpose of shedding the liquor
of their milts upon the eggs, which at that sea∣son
drop from the females. The male seems to
be more attached to the eggs than to the female;
for, when she ceases to throw out the eggs, the
male instantly abandons her, and follows, with
ardor, the eggs which are carried down by the
stream, or dispersed by the winds. He passes
and repasses a thousand times over every place
where he finds eggs. It is not, surely, for the
love of the mother that he makes all these move∣ments:
He cannot even be supposed to know
her; for he has been often seen shedding his
semen promiscuously on all the eggs that came
in his way, without having ever met with the
female to which they belonged.</P>
<P>Thus some animals are distinguished by sexes,
and endowed with members proper for copula∣tion.
There are others which likewise have sexes, but want the necessary members. Others,
as snails, have both members and sexes in each
individual. Others, as the vine-fretters, have
<PB N="261" REF="274"/>
no sexes, are equally fathers or mothers, and pro∣duce
of themselves without copulation. Though
they seem to copulate at pleasure, we are unable
to discover the use of their junction, or whether
it be really a sexual embrace; unless we should
suppose Nature to have endowed this small in∣sect
with generative faculties superior to those of
any other species of animals, and to have be∣stowed
on every individual not only the power
of reproduction, but likewise the power of mul∣tiplying
by sexual communications.</P>
<P>But, whatever varieties take place in the ge∣neration
of different species of animals, Nature
prepares the body for it by a new production,
which, whether it be external or internal, always
precedes generation: Immediately before the
season of impregnation, the ovaria of oviparous
animals, and the testicles of the females of the
viviparous, undergo a considerable change. The
oviparous animals produce eggs, which gradual∣ly
increase in size, till they quit the ovarium
and fall into the canal of the uterus, where they
receive their white, their membranes, and their
shell. This production marks the fecundity of
the female, and without which generation could
not be effected. In viviparous females, in the
same manner, one or more glandular bodies ap∣pear
upon the testicles, which gradually grow
under the membranes that covers them. These
glandular bodies increase, and pierce, or rather
elevate the membrane of the testicle; and, when
<PB N="262" REF="275"/>
they arrive at maturity, a fissure, or several little
holes, appear at their extremities, through which
the seminal fluid escapes, and falls into the ute∣rus.
These glandular bodies are new produc∣tions,
which always precede generation, and
without which it could not be effected.</P>
<P>Males undergo a similar change before they
are fit for the purposes of generating. In the
oviparous animals, the seminal reservoirs are
filled, and sometimes the reservoirs themselves
are annually renewed. The milts of some fishes,
and particularly of the calmar, are renewed every
year. The testicles of birds, immediately be∣fore
the season of their amours, swell to an e∣normous
degree. The testicles of the males of
viviparous animals, especially of those which have
seasons, likewise swell considerably; and, in ge∣neral,
the genitals of every species suffer an e∣rection,
which, though it be external and casu∣al,
may be regarded as a new production that
necessarily precedes the faculty of generating.</P>
<P>Thus, in all animals, whether male or female,
generation is always preceded by new produc∣tions;
and, when there is properly no new pro∣ductions,
some of the parts swell and extend to
a remarkable degree. In some animals, not on∣ly
a new production appears, but their whole
bodies are renewed, before generation can be
effected; as happens in the surprising metamor∣phosis
of insects, which seems to be intended
for no other purpose than to enable these ani∣mals
<PB N="263" REF="276"/>
to propagate their species; for their bodies
are full grown before they are transformed.
The insect, immediately before its transforma∣tion,
ceases to take nourishment; and it has no
organs proper for generation, no means of con∣verting
the nutritive particles, with which it a∣bounds
more than any other species of animals,
into eggs, or a seminal fluid. Hence the whole
of this great surplus of nutritive particles at first
unites and moulds itself into a form nearly re∣sembling
that of the original animal. The ca∣terpillar
becomes a butterfly, because, having no
organs of generation, no reservoirs for contain∣ing
the superfluous nutritive particles, and, con∣sequently,
being incapable of producing minute
organic bodies similar to the animal itself, the
organic nutritive particles, which are always ac∣tive,
assume, by their union, the form of a but∣terfly,
partly resembling that of a caterpillar,
both internally and externally, excepting that
the parts of generation are unfolded, and ren∣dered
capable of receiving and transmitting the
nutritive organic particles which form the eggs,
and individuals peculiar to the species. The
individuals produced by the butterfly ought not
to be butterflies, but caterpillars; because it was
the caterpillar that received the nourishment,
and because the organic particles of this nourish∣ment
must therefore be assimilated into the form
of a caterpillar, and not of a butterfly, which is
only an occasional production of the superfluous
<PB N="264" REF="277"/>
nourishment that precedes the real production of
animals of this species, and a method employed
by Nature to accomplish the important purposes
of generation, similar to the production of glan∣dular
bodies, and of milts, in other animals.</P>
<P>When the superabundant quantity of organic
nutritive particles is not great, as in man, and
most large animals, generation does not take
place till the growth of the body is nearly com∣pleted;
and even their prolific powers are limit∣ed
to a small number of young: But, when these
particles are more abundant, as in birds, and o∣viparous
fishes, generation is effected before the
animal be fully grown, and the production of
individuals is very numerous. When the quan∣tity
of organic nutritive particles is still greater,
as in insects, it first produces a large organized
body, retaining the internal and essential consti∣tution
of the animal, but differing in several
parts, as the butterfly differs from the caterpil∣lar;
and then it quickly generates an amazing
number of young, similar to the animal that first
prepared the organic nourishment from which
they derived their origin. Lastly, when the
quantity of superfluous nourishment is very
great, and when the animal, at the same time,
possesses the organs necessary to generation, as
in the vine-fretters, it first confers on each indi∣vidual
the power of generating, and then a
transformation, like that which other insects
undergo: The vine-fretter becomes a flie; but
<PB N="265" REF="278"/>
it can produce nothing, because it is only the
residue of the organic particles that had not
been employed in the production of the young.</P>
<P>Almost all animals, man excepted, have cer∣tain
annual seasons appropriated to the purposes
of generation. To birds, spring is the season of
love: Carps, and several other fishes, spawn in
June and August. Pikes, and some other fishes,
spawn in the spring. Cats have three seasons
annually, in the months of January, May, and
September. The roe-deer rut in December,
wolfs and foxes in January, horses in summer,
stags in September and October; and almost all
insects generate only during the autumn. Some
animals, as the insects, are totally exhausted by
generation, and die soon after it. Others, though
they die not, become feeble, are much ema∣ciated,
and require a considerable time to re∣pair
the great waste of their organic substance.
Others are less affected, and are capable of
frequently renewing their amours; lastly, man
is very little affected, or, rather, he quick∣ly
repairs the loss, and therefore is, at all
times, in a condition for propagating. All these
varieties solely depend on the particular con∣struction
of the animal organs. The limits fix∣ed
by Nature upon the modes of existing are e∣qually
conspicuous in the manner of taking and
digesting the food, in the means employed for
retaining or throwing it out of the body, and in
the instruments by which the organic particles
<PB N="266" REF="279"/>
necessary to reproduction are extracted. And,
upon the whole, it is apparent, that every thing
exists which can exist.</P>
<P>The times of the gestation of females are e∣qually
various: Some, as mares, carry their
young from eleven to twelve months; others, as
women, cows, and hinds, carry their young nine
months; others, as foxes and wolves, carry five
months; bitches carry nine weeks, cats six weeks,
and rabbits thirty-one days. Most birds are
hatched in twenty-one days; though some of
them, as the thistle-finches, hatch in thirteen or
fourteen days. Here the variety is equally great
as in every other part of the oeconomy of ani∣mals:
The largest animals produce fewer young,
and carry them longest; which confirms the doc∣trine,
that the quantity of organic nourishment
is proportionally less in large than in small ani∣mals;
for the foetus derives its growth and the
expansion of its parts from the superfluous nou∣rishment
of the mother; and, as this growth
requires longer time in large than in small
animals, it is a proof that the quantity of or∣ganic
particles is not so great in the former as in
the latter.</P>
<P>Animals, therefore, are much diversisied as to
the time and manner of gestation, of engender∣ing,
and of producing; and this variety origi∣nates
from the very causes of generation. For,
though the organic matter, which is common to
every thing that lives or vegetates, be the gene∣ral
<PB N="267" REF="280"/>
principle of reproduction, the manner of its
union, and the combinations it forms, must be
infinitely varied, that the whole may become the
sources of new productions. My experiments
clearly demonstrate, that there are no pre-exist∣ing
germs, and that the generation of animals
and vegetables is not univocal. There are, per∣haps,
as many beings, which either live or vege∣tate,
produced by a fortuitous assemblage of or∣ganic
particles, as by a constant and successive
generation. It is to such productions that we
ought to apply the axiom of the antients, <HI>Cor∣ruptio
unius, generatio alterius.</HI> The corruption
and resolution of animals and vegetables pro∣duce
an infinite variety of organized bodies:
Some of them, as those of the calmar, are only
a kind of machines, which, though exceedingly
simple, are very active. Others, as the sper∣matic
animalcules, seem to imitate the move∣ments
of animals. Others resemble vegetables
in their manner of growth and expansion. There
are others, as those of blighted wheat, which, at
pleasure, can be made alternately to live or to die;
and it is difficult to know to what they should
be compared. There are still others, and in great
numbers, which are at first a kind of animals,
then become a species of vegetables, and again
return alternately to their vegetable state. The
more we examine this species of organized bo∣dies,
we shall probably discover greater and more
singular varieties of them, in proportion as they
<PB N="268" REF="281"/>
are farther removed from our observation, and
from the structure of other animals with which
we are already acquainted.</P>
<P>For example, blighted corn, which is effected
by an alteration or resolution of the organic
substance of the grain, is composed of multitudes
of small organized bodies resembling eels. When
infused in water for ten or twelve hours, we
discover them to have a distinct wreathing, and
a small degree of progressive motion. They
cease to move as soon as the water fails them;
and their motion commences upon the addition
of fresh water: This alternate death and revivis∣cence
may be repeated for months, and even for
years; so that these small machines may be made
to act as long and as often as we please, without
destroying or diminishing their force. They
are a species of machines, which begin to act
whenever they are immersed in a fluid. These fi∣laments
sometimes open like the filaments of the
semen, and produce moving globules: We
may, therefore, conclude them to be of the same
nature, excepting that they are more fixed and
solid.</P>
<P>The eels in paste have no other origin than
the union of the organic particles of the most
essential parts of the grain. The first eels which
appear are certainly not produced by other eels;
but, though they are not propagated themselves,
they fail not to engender other living eels. By
cutting them with the point of a lancet, we dis∣cover
<PB N="269" REF="282"/>
smaller eels issuing in great numbers out
of their bodies. The body of this animal seems
to be only a sheath or sac containing a multitude
of smaller animals, which perhaps are other
sheaths of the same kind, in which the organic
matter is assimilated into the form of eels.</P>
<P>A great number of experiments would still
be necessary to distinguish these animals, which
are so singular and so little understood, into classes
and genera. Some of them may be regarded
as real zoophytes, which enjoy a kind of vege∣tation,
and which, at the same time, seem to wreath
and move like animals. Others appear, at first,
to be animals, and then join and form a species
of vegetables. A small attention to the resolu∣tion
of a single grain of corn will elucidate, at
least in part, what I have said on this subject. I
might add other examples; but those I have gi∣ven
were only produced for the purpose of exhi∣biting
the varieties of generation. There are
unquestionably several organized bodies which we
consider as real animals, but which are not engen∣dered
by others of the same species. Some of
them are only a kind of machines; and some
of these machines have a certain limited effect,
and act only for a certain time, as the machines
in the milt of the calmar; others may be made
to act as long and as often as we please, as those
of blighted grain. There are vegetables which
produce animated bodies, as the filaments of the
human semen, from which active globules issue
<PB N="270" REF="283"/>
and move by their own powers. In the corrup∣tion,
the fermentation, or rather in the resolu∣tion
of animal or vegetable substances, we find
real animals capable of propagating their species,
though they were not themselves produced in
this manner. These varieties are, perhaps, more
extensive than we imagine. Though it be right
to generalize our ideas, to assemble the effects of
Nature under one point of view, and to class her
productions; yet numberless shades, and even
degrees, in the great scale of being, will always
escape our observation.</P>

<PB REF="284"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Formation of the Foetus.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the experiments of Verheyen, who
found the semen of the bull in the uterus
of a cow, and from those of Ruysch, Fallopius,
and Leeuwenhoek, who discovered male semen
in the uteri of women and many other animals,
it seems to be a point fully ascertained, that the
semen of the male enters into the uterus of the
female. It is probable, that, during the time of
coition, the orifice of the uterus opens for the
reception of the seminal fluid: But, though this
should not happen, the active and prolific part
of the semen may penetrate the membranes and
substance of the uterus itself; for, as the semi∣nal
liquor, as formerly remarked, is almost en∣tirely
composed of organic particles, which are
very active, and extremely minute, they may
pass with the utmost facility through the mem∣branes
and substance of the uterus.</P>
<P>What proves that the active part of this fluid
may pass through the pores and substance of
the uterus, is the sudden change it undergoes
immediately after conception. The menses are
<PB N="272" REF="285"/>
obstructed, the uterus becomes flaccid, swells,
and appears to be inflated. All these changes
must be effected by an active external cause, by
the penetration of part of the seminal fluid into
the substance of the uterus. This penetration is
not confined to the surface; it extends through
all the vessels and parts of which the uterus is
composed, like that penetration by which nu∣trition,
and the expansion of the body is pro∣duced.</P>
<P>We shall the more easily believe this to be the
case, when we reflect, that, during the time of
gestation, the uterus not only augments in size,
but even in its quantity of matter, and that it
possesses a species of life, or rather of vegetation,
which continues till the child be delivered. If
the uterus were only a sac, a reservoir for re∣ceiving
the semen and retaining the foetus, it
would extend and diminish in thickness, in pro∣portion
as the foetus grew larger. But the aug∣mentation
of the uterus is not a simple exten∣sion
or dilatation of its parts. It not only extends
as the foetus enlarges, but it acquires, at the
same time, an additional thickness and solidity;
or, in other words, both its size and quantity of
matter are greatly increased. This augmenta∣tion
is a real growth or increase of substance,
similar to the expansion of the body in young
animals, which could not be effected but by an
intimate penetration of organic particles analo∣gous
to the substance of those parts. As this
<PB N="273" REF="286"/>
expansion of the uterus never happens but after
impregnation, the seminal liquor must be the
cause by which it is produced; for the uterus is
considerably augmented before the foetus has
acquired bulk enough to dilate it by pressing a∣gainst
its internal surface.</P>
<P>It appears, from my own experiments, to be
equally certain, that the female has a seminal
fluid, which begins to be formed in the testicles,
and is brought to maturity in the glandular bo∣dies.
This fluid perpetually distills through the
small apertures in the extremities of these bo∣dies,
and, like that of the male, enters the uterus
by two different ways, either through the aper∣tures
at the extremities of the horns of the ute∣rus,
or by piercing through the substance of the
uterus itself.</P>
<P>These two seminal fluids are extracts from all
parts of the body; and a mixture of them is all
that is necessary for the formation of a certain
number of males and females. The more any
animal abounds in this seminal fluid, or the more
it abounds in organic particles, the number of
young is the greater, as may be remarked in the
smaller animals; and the number of young di∣minishes
in proportion as the organic particles
are less abundant, as is the case with the larger
animals.</P>
<P>But, before taking any farther notice of other
animals, we shall examine with attention the
formation of the human foetus. In mankind,
as well as in the larger species of animals, the
<PB N="274" REF="287"/>
quantity of organic particles in the male and fe∣male
semen is not great, and, accordingly, they
very seldom produce above one foetus at a time.
This foetus is either a male or a female, accor∣ding
as the number of organic particles predo∣minates
in the male or in the female fluid; and
the child resembles the father or the mother
most, according to the proportional quantities of
male or female organic particles in the mixture
of the two liquors.</P>
<P>I conceive, therefore, that the seminal fluids,
both of the male and of the female, are equally
active, and equally necessary for the purposes of
propagation: And this, I think, is fully proven
by my experiments; for I found in both fluids
the same moving bodies; I discovered that the
male fluid enters into the uterus, where it meets
with the fluid of the female; that these two
fluids are perfectly analogous; and that they are
composed of parts not only similar in their form,
but in their action and movements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. VI.</NOTE>. Now, I
imagine, that, by the mixture of the two fluids,
the activity of the organic particles proper to
each is stopped; that the action of the one coun∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>alances the action of the other; that each or∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic
particle, by ceasing to move, remains fixed
in the place which corresponds to its nature; and
that this place can be no other than that which
it formerly occupied in the body of the animal
from which it was extracted. Thus all the orga∣nic
particles which were detached from the head
<PB N="275" REF="288"/>
of the animal, will arrange themselves in a si∣milar
order in the head of the foetus. Those
which proceeded from the back bone, will dispose
themselves in an order corresponding to the
structure and position of the vertebrae. In the
same manner, the organic particles which had
been detached from any part of the body, will
naturally assume the same position, and arrange
themselves in the same order that they observed
before they were separated from that part. Of
course, these particles will necessarily form a
small organized body, entirely similar to the ani∣mal
from which they originally proceeded.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that this mixture of
the organic particles of both sexes contains par∣ticles
that are similar, and particles that are dis∣similar.
The similar particles are those which
have been detached from all the parts that are
common to the two sexes. The dissimilar particles
are those which have been separated from the parts
that distinguish the two sexes. In this mixture,
therefore, there is a double portion of particles de∣stined
for the formation of the head, the heart, and
such parts as are common to both sexes; while
there are no more than what are necessary for the
production of the sexual parts. Now, the similar
particles may act upon each other without pro∣ducing
any disorder; and they may unite in the
same manner as if they had proceeded from the
same body. But the dissimilar parts cannot act
upon each other, nor form any intimate union,
because they have no analogy or relation: Hence
<PB N="276" REF="289"/>
these particles will preserve their original nature
without any mixture, will first fix their position,
without the necessity of being penetrated by o∣thers.
Thus the particles which proceed from
the sexual parts will be first fixed, and those that
are common to the two sexes, whether they be∣long
to the male or to the female, will then six
indiscriminately, and form an organized body,
which, in its sexual parts, will perfectly resemble
the father, if it be a male, and the mother, if it
be a female, but, which, in the other parts, may
resemble either or both.</P>
<P>If what I have advanced be properly under∣stood,
we shall, perhaps, be able to obviate an
objection made to the system of Aristotle, and
which might also be urged against the doctrine
which I am now establishing. The question is,
Why is not every individual, both male and fe∣male,
endowed with the faculty of producing an
animal of its own sex? I am aware of the diffi∣culty
of solving this question, which I have
slightly mentioned in the fifth chapter, and shall
now proceed farther to illustrate.</P>
<P>From what is delivered in the first four chap∣ters,
and from the experiments I have described,
it is apparent, that reproduction is effected by
the assemblage and union of the organic par∣ticles,
detached from every part of the animal or
vegetable body, in one or several common re∣servoirs;
that these particles are the same which
serve for the nutrition and expansion of the
<PB N="277" REF="290"/>
body; and that both effects are produced by the
same matter, and by the same laws. I think I have
established this point by so many facts and rea∣sonings,
that it is impossible to entertain a doubt
concerning its truth. But, I allow, that the
question may be put, Why every separate animal
and vegetable produces not its own likeness,
since every individual detaches from all its parts,
and collects in a common reservoir, the organic
particles necessary for the formation of a small
organized body? Why is not this organized
body formed? and why, in most animals, is a
mixture of the fluids of both sexes necessary?
If I were to reply, that in all the vegetable tribes,
in all those animals that multiply by cutting,
and in the vine-fretters, which produce without
any sexual commerce, the general intention of
Nature seems to be, that each individual should
multiply its own species, and that reproduction
by the intervention of sexes is only an exception
to this general law. It might, with propriety,
be rejoined, that the exception is perhaps more
universal than the rule itself. To maintain that
all individuals would have the faculty of re∣producing,
if they were endowed with proper
organs, and if they contained the matter neces∣sary
for nourishing the embryo, is not removing
the difficulty: For, in females, all these circum∣stances
concur; and yet the influence of the
male is indispensible to the production either of
a female or of a male foetus.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="291"/>
But, we come nearer a solution of the ques∣tion,
when we maintain, that, though the fluid
in the testicles and seminal vessels of the male
contain all the organic particles necessary for the
formation of a male foetus, yet these particles
cannot receive any local establishment or ar∣rangement
of parts, because a constant circula∣tion
of them goes on by means of absorption,
and by the perpetual succession of new supplies
from all parts of the body; and that, as the
same circulation of the organic particles takes
place in the female, neither of them can pos∣sibly
multiply without the assistance of the
other; because, in the mixture of the male and
female fluids, the different organic particles of
which they consist have a greater affinity to
each other than they have to the body of the
female where the mixture happens. But, though
this explication were admitted, why, it may still
be asked, does not the ordinary mode of gene∣ration
correspond with it? For, upon this sup∣position,
each individual would produce, and,
like snails, mutually impregnate one another,
every individual receiving the organic particles
furnished by the other, which, without being
injured by any other power, would unite solely
by the affinity between the particles themselves.
If there were no other cause by which the or∣ganic
particles could be united, perhaps this
mode of generation would be the most simple.
But it is contrary to the analogy of Nature.
<PB N="279" REF="292"/>
Few animals are endowed, like snails, with both
sexes; and, therefore, if this mode of propa∣gating
were the most simple, it would be more
generally employed by Nature. This solution,
of course, amounts to no more than a gratuitous
supposition, that males produce not, solely be∣cause
they have not organs proper for contain∣ing
and nourishing a foetus.</P>
<P>It may be still farther supposed, that the acti∣vity
of the organic particles in the semen of each
individual requires to be counterbalanced by the
force or action of those of the other individual,
in order to reduce them to a fixed state, or e∣quilibrium,
without which the formation of the
foetus cannot be effected; and that the motion
of the organic particles of the female cannot be
counterbalanced by any other cause than a con∣trary
action in the organic particles received from
the male. But this answer is too general to be
void of obscurity. However, when we attend
to all the phaenomena, it may, perhaps, admit
of some illustration. The mixture of the two
seminal fluids produces not only a male or fe∣male
foetus, but other organized bodies, which
are endowed with the faculty of growth or ex∣pansion.
The placenta, the membranes, &amp;c.
are produced at the same time, if not sooner,
than the foetus. There are, therefore, in the
seminal fluid of the male or female, or in the
mixture of both, organic particles not only suit∣ed
to the production of the foetus, but of the
<PB N="280" REF="293"/>
placenta and membranes. Since there are no
parts either in the male or female bodies from
which they could be detached, whence do these
particles proceed? It must be admitted, that the
organic seminal particles of each sex being
equally active, uniformly produce organized
bodies every time that they can six themselves,
by their mutual action upon one another; that,
of the particles destined to produce a male, those
peculiar to the male sex will fix first, and form
the sexual parts; that the particles common to
both sexes may afterwards fix themselves indif∣ferently,
in order to form the rest of the body;
and that the placenta and membranes are pro∣duced
by the excess of organic particles which
have not been employed in the formation of the
foetus. If, as we have supposed, the foetus be
a male, all the organic particles peculiar to the
female sex, which have not been employed, as
also the superfluous particles of both individuals
which have not entered into the composition of
the foetus, and which cannot be less than one half
of the whole, remain for the formation of the
membranes and placenta. If the foetus be a
female, the same quantity of superfluous organic
particles still remain, and are occupied in forming
the placenta and membranes.</P>
<P>But it may be said, that the membranes and
placenta, upon this supposition, ought to become
another foetus, which would be a male, if the
first was a female, and a female, if the first was
<PB N="281" REF="294"/>
a male; because the first foetus consumed only
the organic particles peculiar to the sex of one
individual, and the half of those particles which
were common to both sexes; and, of course,
the sexual particles of the other individual, and
the other half of the common particles, remain
still unexhausted. To this I reply, that the first
union of the organic particles prevents a second,
at least under the same form; and that the foe∣tus,
being first formed, exerts an external force
which destroys the natural arrangement of the
other organic particles, and throws them into
that order which is necessary for the formation
of the placenta and membranes.</P>
<P>From the experiments and observations for∣merly
made, it is apparent, that all animated be∣ings
contain an amazing quantity of living or∣ganic
particles. The life of an animal or vege∣table
seems to be nothing else than a result of
all the particular <HI>lives</HI> (if the expression be ad∣missible)
of each of these active particles, whose
life is primitive, and perhaps indistructible.
These living particles we have found in every
animal and vegetable substance; and we are
certain, that all these particles are equally ne∣cessary
to the nutrition, and, consequently, to the
reproduction of animals and vegetables. That
the union of a certain number of these particles,
therefore, should produce an animated being,
it is not difficult to conceive. As each particle
is animated, a whole, or any assemblage of them,
<PB N="282" REF="295"/>
must be endowed with life. These living or∣ganic
particles being common to all animated
beings, they are capable of forming particular
species of animals, or of vegetables, according
to the peculiar arrangement they assume. Now,
this arrangement depends entirely on the form
of the individuals which furnish the organic
particles. If they are furnished by an animal,
they arrange themselves under the form pecu∣liar
to its species, exactly agreeable to that ar∣rangement
they observed when they nourished
or expanded the animal itself. But, does not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> suppose the necessity
of some base or centre, round which the particles
assemble in order to unite and form a foetus?
This basis is furnished by the particles which
form the sexual parts. I shall illustrate this point.</P>
<P>As long as the organic particles of either sex
remain alone, their activity produces no effect,
because it is not opposed by any resistance or re∣action
from particles of a different kind. But,
when the male and female liquors are blended,
the particles detached from the sexual parts be∣ing
of a different kind, serve as a base to fix the
activity of the other particles.</P>
<P>Upon this supposition, that the organic par∣ticles
which, in the mixture of the two fluids,
represent the sexual parts of the male, can alone
serve as a basis to the particles which proceed from
all parts of the female; and that those proceed∣ing
from all parts of the male can only be fixed
<PB N="283" REF="296"/>
by the particles which are detached from the
sexual parts of the female; we may con∣clude,
that the sexual parts of the male foe∣tus
are formed by the organic particles of the
father, and the rest of its body by the organic
particles of the female; and, on the contrary,
that the female foetus derives nothing but its
sex from the mother, and the rest of its body
from the father. Boys, therefore, excepting in
the parts which distinguish their sex, ought to
resemble the mother more than the father, and
girls should resemble the father more than the
mother.</P>
<P>Considering generation by sexes under this
light, we should conclude it to be the most com∣mon
manner of reproduction, as it is in reality.
Beings of the most perfect organization, as ani∣mals,
whose bodies make a whole that is inca∣pable
of division, and whose powers are all con∣centrated
into one point, cannot be reproduced
in any other way; because they contain only
particles that are perfectly similar, and cannot
be united but by means of different particles
furnished by another individual. But vegetables,
which are less perfect in their organization, and
which can be divided without destruction, are
capable of being reproduced in different ways:
1. Because they contain dissimilar particles;
2. Because the form of these bodies is less fixed
and determined than that of an animal, diffe∣rent
parts may supply the functions of each o∣ther,
<PB N="284" REF="297"/>
and vary according to circumstances: The
roots of a tree, when exposed to the air, push out
branches and leaves; and thus the organic par∣ticles
of vegetables obtain a local establishment,
become fixed, and produce individuals in many
different ways.</P>
<P>The same phaenomenon is exhibited in ani∣mals
whose organization is less perfect, as in the
fresh water polypus, and others, that are capable
of reproducing by the division of their parts.
These organized bodies, instead of single ani∣mals,
may be considered as bundles of organized
beings united by a common membrane, as trees
are composed of an infinite number of minute
trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>. The vine-fretters, which propagate indi∣vidually,
likewise contain dissimilar particles;
because, after producing their young, they
change into barren flies. Snails mutually com∣municate
dissimilar particles to each other; and,
therefore, each individual is fruitful. Thus, in
every mode of generation with which we are
acquainted, we find, that the necessary union of
the organic particles cannot be effected but by
the admixture of different particles, to serve as
a common basis, and to fix or destroy their ac∣tivity.</P>
<P>According to this general idea of sexes, we
may suppose, that the distinction of sex extends
through all Nature; for <HI>sex,</HI> in this sense, is no∣thing
but that part of bodies which furnishes
<PB N="285" REF="298"/>
organic particles of a different kind from those
of the common parts, and which serve as a basis
for their union. But it is, perhaps, useless to
reason on a question which can be solved at once,
by saying, that, as God has created sexes, ani∣mals
must necessarily be produced by their in∣tervention.
We are not in a condition, as I
formerly remarked, to explain <HI>why</HI> things exist;
we are unable to explain <HI>why</HI> Nature almost
universally employs sexes for the reproduction
of animals, or <HI>why</HI> sexes exist. We ought,
therefore, to content ourselves with reasoning
concerning things as they are. If we attempt
to rise higher, we lose ourselves in the regions
of fancy, and forget the narrow limits of our
knowledge.</P>
<P>Leaving, therefore, all farther subtleties, I
shall adhere to nothing that is not founded on
facts and observation. I find that the repro∣duction
of bodies is effected in many different
modes: But, at the same time, I clearly perceive,
that animals and vegetables are reproduced by
the union of the organic particles detached from
all parts of their bodies. I am certain that these
active organic particles exist in the seeds of ve∣getables,
and in the seminal fluids of animals,
both male and female; and have no doubt that
every species of reproduction is accomplished
by the union and admixture of these particles.
It is equally unquestionable, that, in the gene∣ration
of man, and other animals, the organic
<PB N="286" REF="299"/>
particles of the male and female mix at the time
of conception; because we often see children
who resemble both father and mother: And,
what confirms this theory is, that all the particles
common to the two sexes mix together promis∣cuously,
but that the particles peculiar to the
sexes never mix; for we daily perceive children
with eyes resembling those of the father, while
their mouth and front resemble those of the
mother. But we never see any such mixture of
resemblances in the sexual parts; we never find,
in the same individual, the testicles of the father
and the vagina of the mother.</P>
<P>The formation of the foetus, therefore, is ef∣fected
by the mixture of the organic particles of
both sexes; and this mixture fixes or gives a lo∣cal
establishment to the particles, because it is
made according to the laws of affinity which
take place between the different parts, and which
determine the particles to arrange themselves in
the same order they observed when they existed
in the individuals who furnished them. The
particles which proceed from the head, for ex∣ample,
cannot, according to these laws, take up
their station in the legs, or in any other part
but the head of the foetus. All the particles are
in motion when they first unite; and this mo∣tion
must be round the point or centre of union.
This basis or central point, which is necessary
to the union of the particles, and which, by its
reaction and inertia, fixes and destroys their ac∣tivity,
<PB N="287" REF="300"/>
is probably the first assemblage of parti∣cles
that proceed from the sexual parts, because
they are the only particles in the mixture that
differ from those common to both sexes.</P>
<P>I imagine, therefore, that, in the mixture of
the two fluids, the organic particles which come
from the sexual parts of the male fix themselves
first, and cannot unite with those which pro∣ceed
from the seminal parts of the female, be∣cause
they are of a different nature, and have
less affinity to each other than the particles that
come from the eye, the arm, or any other part
of the female. Round this centre, or point of
union, the other organic particles successively ar∣range
themselves in the same order they former∣ly
existed in the body from which they were de∣rived;
and, according as the particles of the one
or of the other individual most abound, or near∣er
this central point, they enter in greater or
less quantities into the composition of the new
being, which, in this manner, is formed in the
middle of a homogeneous fluid; at the same
time, vessels begin to shoot, which increase in
proportion to the growth of the foetus, and fur∣nish
it with proper nourishment. These vessels,
which have a peculiar species of organization,
are probably formed by the excess of the orga∣nic
particles which have not been admitted into the
composition of the foetus; for, as these particles
are both active, and furnished with a base or
point of union from the organic particles pecu∣liar
<PB N="288" REF="301"/>
to the sexual parts of the other individual,
they must arrange themselves in the form of an
organized body, but not in the form of another
foetus; because their position with respect to
each other has been changed by the different
movements of the particles which entered into the
composition of the first foetus. From the union
of these superabundant particles, therefore, an
irregular body must arise, which will resemble
the foetus in nothing but its growth and expan∣sion;
because, though this body be composed of
the same organic active particles with the foetus,
their position and form must be different, as they
were thrown aside from the centre or point of
union, which served as a basis for the formation
of the foetus.</P>
<P>When the quantity of seminal fluid of both
individuals is great, or, rather, when these liquors
abound with organic particles, different centres
of attraction are formed in different parts of the
mixture; and, in that case, by a mechanism si∣milar
to what has been mentioned above, several
foetuses are formed, some of them males, and
others females, according as the particles of the
one sex or of the other are most active. But,
from the same centre of attraction, two foetuses
can never originate; because two centres are re∣quisite
for this purpose. Besides, if this were to
happen, no particles would be left for the for∣mation
of the placenta and membranes; because
they would all be employed in constituting the
<PB N="289" REF="302"/>
second foetus, which would necessarily be a fe∣male,
if the other was a male. All that could
happen in such a case would be, that some of
the particles common to both individuals, being
equally attracted by the first centre of union,
must arrive there at the same time, and produce
a monster, or a foetus with superfluous parts;
or, if some of the common particles should fix
at too great a distance from the first centre, or be
constrained by the attraction of the second, round
which the placenta is formed, a monster, defec∣tive
in some part, would be the consequence.</P>
<P>That the organic particles peculiar to the sex∣ual
parts serve for a basis or centre of union to
the other particles of which the embryo is form∣ed,
I pretend not to demonstrate: But, as they
are the only particles which differ from the rest,
it is more natural to imagine that they should
answer this purpose than those which are com∣mon
to both individuals.</P>
<P>I formerly detected the errors of those who
maintained, that the heart, or the blood, were first
formed. The whole is formed at the same time.
We learn from actual observation, that the
chicken exists in the egg before it is sit upon.
The head, the back-bone, and even the appen∣dages
which form the placenta, are all distinguish∣able.
I have opened a great number of eggs,
both before and after incubation, and I am con∣vinced,
from the evidence of my own eyes, that
the whole chicken exists, in the middle of the
<PB N="290" REF="303"/>
cicatrice, the moment the egg issues from the bo∣dy
of the hen. The heat communicated to it by
incubation, only expands the parts, by putting
the fluids in motion. But we have never been
able to determine, with certainty, what parts of
the foetus are first fixed, at the moment of its
formation.</P>
<P>I have always maintained, that the organic
particles were fixed, and that they united in con∣sequence
of their motion being suspended. Of
the truth of this fact I am fully convinced; for,
if the male and female semen be separately exa∣mined,
we find in both a great number of mo∣ving
particles; but, when these fluids are mix∣ed,
the motion of the particles is totally destroy∣ed,
and a certain degree of heat is necessary to
renew their activity; for the chicken, which ex∣ists
in the centre of the cicatrice, has no motion
before incubation; and, even 24 hours, or two
days afterwards, when we begin to perceive it
without the microscope, it has not the smallest
appearance of motion. During the first two or
three days, the foetus is only a small white mu∣cilaginous
mass, which gradually acquires con∣sistence
and magnitude. But this progress is ex∣ceedingly
slow, and has no resemblance to the
rapid movements of the organic particles in the
seminal fluid. Besides, it was not without rea∣son
that I maintained that the motion of the or∣ganic
particles was entirely destroyed; for, if
eggs be kept without exposing them to the de∣gree
<PB N="291" REF="304"/>
of heat that is necessary for the expan∣sion
of the chicken, the embryo, though com∣pleatly
formed, will remain without any motion,
and the organic particles of which it is compo∣sed
will continue fixed, without being able to
give life and motion to the embryo which was
formed by their union. Thus, after the motion
of the organic particles is stopped, and after they
have united in such a manner as to form a foe∣tus,
some external cause is still necessary to give
them life and motion. This cause, or agent, is
heat, which, by rarifying the fluids, obliges them
to circulate: This circulation makes all the or∣gans
act; and nothing farther is necessary for
the growth and expansion of the parts than the
continuation of this heat.</P>
<P>Before the action of this external heat, there
is not the smallest appearance of blood; and I
never could perceive any change of colour in
the vessels till about 24 hours after incubation.
In the vessels of the placenta, which communi∣cate
with the body of the foetus, the blood first
appears. But, it would seem that this blood lo∣ses
its red colour, as it approaches the body of
the animal; for the chicken is entirely white;
and, during the first, second, and third days af∣ter
incubation, we can with difficulty perceive
a few red particles near the animal's body, but
which seem not to make any part of it, though
these red particles are destined for the formation
of the heart. Thus the formation of blood is
an effect produced by the motion communicated
<PB N="292" REF="305"/>
to the fluids by heat; and even this blood is
formed without the body of the animal, the
whole substance of which consists of a white
mucilage.</P>
<P>The foetus, as well as the placenta, receive the
nourishment that is necessary for their expansion
by a species of absorption; and they assimilate
the organic particles of the liquor in which they
swim: For, it is an equal impropriety to say that
the placenta nourishes the animal, as that the a∣nimal
nourishes the placenta. If the placenta
nourished the foetus, the former would diminish
in proportion to the growth of the latter, which
by no means happens; for both augment toge∣ther.
I have indeed observed, that, in eggs, the
placenta at first grows much more in proportion
than the foetus, and, consequently, it may nou∣rish
the animal; or, rather, it conveys nourish∣ment
to it by means of absorption.</P>
<P>What we have said concerning the chicken,
admits of an easy application to the human foe∣tus,
which is formed by the union of the orga∣nic
particles of the two sexes. The membranes
and placenta are produced by the superabundant
particles that enter not into the composition of
the foetus, which is now inclosed in a double
membrane, containing also a quantity of fluid.
This fluid is at first, perhaps, nothing but a por∣tion
of the seminal liquors of the father and mo∣ther;
and, as the foetus is not thrown out of the
uterus, it enjoys, from the moment of its forma∣tion,
<PB N="293" REF="306"/>
as much external heat as is sufficient for its
expansion. This heat communicates motion to
the fluids; it gives play to all the organs; and
the blood is formed in the placenta, and in the
body of the foetus, solely by the motion excited
by the heat. We might even maintain, that the
formation of the blood in a child is as indepen∣dent
of the mother, as that which arises in the
egg is independent of the hen that covers it, or
of the furnace which heats it.</P>
<P>It is certain that the foetus, the membranes,
and the placenta, are all nourished and expanded
by absorption; for, at first, the sack that con∣tains
the whole product of generation does not
adhere to the uterus: And we have seen, from
the experiments of De Graaf upon female rab∣bits,
that he made the globules which contained
the foetuses roll about in the uterus. They
could receive no nourishment, therefore, but by
absorbing the fluids that constantly bedew the
uterus, to which they afterwards begin to ad∣here
by means of a mucilage that gradually gives
origin to small blood-vessels, as shall afterwards
be more fully explained.</P>
<P>But to return to the formation of the foetus,
concerning which we have to make several re∣marks,
both as to its situation, and to the differ∣ent
circumstances that may prevent or alter the
mode of its production.</P>
<P>In the human species, the semen of the male
enters into the uterus, the cavity of which is
<PB N="294" REF="307"/>
considerable; and, when it meets with a suffi∣cient
quantity of female semen, the two instantly
mix, and the organic particles unite and form
the foetus. The whole is, perhaps, performed
in a moment, especially if the two fluids be in
an active state. The cavity of the uterus is the
proper place for the formation of the foetus;
because the semen of the male has an easier ad∣mission
into the uterus than into the Fallopian
tubes or ovarium; and, as the uterus has only
a small aperture, which is always shut, excepting
when opened by the ardor of love, the materi∣als
of generation remain there in safety, unless
they be disturbed by some rare and accidental
circumstance. But, as the male fluid moistens
the vagina, before it penetrates the uterus, and,
as the organic particles are exceedingly active,
it may penetrate as far as the Fallopian tubes
and ovarium. In the same manner, as the fe∣male
fluid is already perfected in the glandular
bodies of the testicles, from which it distills and
moistens the Fallopian tubes, before it descends
into the uterus; and, as it may escape through
the lacunae round the neck of the uterus, it is
not impossible that the mixture of the two li∣quors
may take place in all these different pla∣ces.
Foetuses, therefore, may frequently be
formed in the vagina, and instantly fall out of
it, having nothing proper for their retention.
They may also be sometimes formed in the Fal∣lopian
<PB N="295" REF="308"/>
tubes; but instances of this kind must be
rare.</P>
<P>Anatomists mention, that foetuses have been
found, not only in the Fallopian tubes, but like∣wise
in the ovaria. M. Theroude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See mem. de I'acad. des sciences, tom. 2. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>, a surgeon
in Paris, showed to the academy a rude mass
which he found in the right ovarium of a girl of
18 years of age. Two open fissures, garnished
with hair like the eye-lids, were perceived in it.
Above these eye-lids was a kind of front, with
a black line in place of eye-brows. Immediate∣ly
above the front, there were several hairs col∣lected
into two separate pencils, one of them a∣bout
seven inches long, and the other three. Below
the angle of the eye, two large, hard, white
dentes molares appeared, together with their
gums: These teeth were about three lines long,
and about a line distant from each other. Se∣veral
other teeth appeared, situated at different
distances. In the same volume<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 244.</NOTE>, M. Mery is
reported to have found in the ovarium of a wo∣man
an upper jaw-bone, with several teeth in
it, so perfect that they appeared to be at least
of ten years growth. In the Medical Jour∣nal,
published by the Abbé de la Roque<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">January 1683.</NOTE>, we
have the history of a woman, who died of her
ninth child, which had been formed <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI>
one of the ovaria; for, from the description, it
is not clear whether the child was within the o∣varium,
<PB N="296" REF="309"/>
or only adjacent to it. This foetus was
about an inch thick, and compleatly formed. In
the Philosophical Transactions, examples are re∣corded
of teeth, hair, and bones being found in
the ovaria of women. If all these facts can be
credited, the seminal liquor of the male must be
supposed sometimes, though rarely, to mount up
to the ovaria. But there are many considerations
which render this point extremely doubtful:
1. The facts which seem to support it are few:
2. The only instance of a perfect foetus found
in the ovarium, is narrated in a very suspicious
manner by M. Littre. Neither is it impossible
that the seminal fluid of the female alone may
sometimes produce organized masses, as moles,
cists full of hair, of bones, or of flesh. Besides,
if we are to believe anatomists, foetuses may be
formed in the testicles of men as well as in those
of women; for, we are told by a surgeon, in the
2d volume of the history of the old academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 298.</NOTE>,
that he found a foetus, with its membranes, in
which the head, the feet, the eyes, the bones and
cartilages, were distinguishable in the scrotum of
a man. Were all these facts equally worthy of
credit, we must necessarily adopt one of the two
following hypotheses; either that the seminal
fluid of each sex can produce nothing without
being mixed with the other; or, that either of
the fluids alone is capable of producing irregu∣larly
organized masses. If we maintain the for∣mer
<PB N="297" REF="310"/>
hypothesis, to explain the facts above rela∣ted,
we shall be obliged to admit, that the male
fluid sometimes ascends to the ovarium, and, by
mixing there with the female fluid, forms or∣ganized
bodies; and also, that the female fluid,
by being copiously effused in the vagina, may,
in the time of coition, penetrate as far as the
scrotum of the male, in the same manner as the
venereal virus often reaches that part; and, con∣sequently,
that an organized body may be form∣ed
in the scrotum by a mixture of the male and
female fluids. If the other hypothesis, which is
the most probable, be adopted, namely, that the
seminal fluid of each individual may separately
produce organized masses, then all these osseous,
fleshy, and hairy bodies, which sometimes appear
in the ovaria of females, and in the scrotum of
males, may derive their origin from the seminal
fluid of the individual in which they are found.
But it is needless to speculate farther concerning
facts which seem to be more uncertain than in∣explicable;
for I am inclined to think, that the
seminal fluid of each individual may singly pro∣duce
something; and that young girls, for ex∣ample,
may produce moles, without any inter∣course
with the male, in the same manner as
hens lay eggs without the intervention of the
cock. I might support this opinion with obser∣vations
equally credible as those we have just
now quoted. M. de la Saone, a physician and
anatomist, published a treatise on this subject, in
<PB N="298" REF="311"/>
which he assures us, that nuns, though strictly
cloistered, sometimes produce moles: And why
should this be impossible, since hens produce eggs
without any communication with the cock, and
since we find, in the cicatrices of these eggs, in∣stead
of a chicken, a mole with its appendages?
The analogy here is sufficiently strong to make
us at least suspend a rash determination. What∣ever
be in this, it is certain, that a mixture of
the two fluids is necessary for the formation of
a foetus, and that this mixture cannot be pro∣perly
effected but in the uterus, or in the Fallo∣pian
tubes, where anatomists have sometimes dis∣covered
foetuses: And it is natural to imagine,
that those which have been found in the cavity
of the abdomen, have escaped by the extremity
of the tube, or by some accidental rupture of the
uterus; and that they never fall into the abdo∣men
from the ovarium, because I think it next
to impossible that the seminal fluid should ascend
so far. Leeuwenhoek has computed the motion
of his pretended spermatic animals to be four
or five inches in 40 minutes; so that, if the
whole fluid moved at this rate, in an hour or
two the animalcules might proceed from the va∣gina
into the uterus, from the uterus into the
Fallopian tubes, and from the Fallopian tubes
into the ovaria. But, how is it possible to con∣ceive,
that the organic particles, whose motion
ceases whenever they are deprived of the fluid
part of the semen, should arrive at the ovarium,
<PB N="299" REF="312"/>
unless they were accompanied with the liquor
in which they swim? The moving particles
cannot give a progressive motion to the fluid
which contains them. Thus, whatever activity
may be ascribed to these organic particles, we
cannot conceive how they should arrive at the
ovarium, and there form a foetus, unless, by
some unknown power, the fluid is absorbed by
the ovarium, a supposition which is not only gra∣tuitous,
but contrary to probability.</P>
<P>The difficulty attending this supposition con∣firms
the opinion, that the male fluid enters the
uterus, either by its orifice, or by penetrating its
substance. The female fluid may likewise find
its way into the uterus, either by the aperture at
the extremity of the Fallopian tubes, or by pe∣netrating
the substance of the tubes and uterus.
M. Weitbrech, an able anatomist of the acade∣my
of Petersburg, has clearly proved that the se∣minal
fluid can penetrate through the substance
of the uterus: 'Res omni attentione dignissima,'
says he, 'oblata mihi est in utero feminae alicu∣jus

to this acute observer, are insurmountable, accor∣ding
to the ovicular system. But the fact he re∣cords
is alone sufficient to demonstrate, that the
female fluid may penetrate the substance of the
uterus; and it is not to be doubted that the male
fluid is capable of entering it in the same man∣ner.
The change which the male fluid produ∣ces
in the uterus, and the species of vegetation
or expansion which it occasions in that viscus, is
sufficient to demonstrate the truth of the fact.
Besides, the fluid which issues through the la∣cunae
of De Graaf being of the same nature
with that of the glandular bodies, it is evident
that this liquor proceeds from the ovaria; and
yet there are no vessels through which it could
pass. We must therefore conclude, that it pene∣trates
through the spongy substance of the parts,
and that it not only enters the uterus, but may
even issue out of it, when the parts are irritated.</P>
<P>But, though this penetration should be re∣garded
as impossible, it cannot be denied, that
the female fluid, which distills from the glandu∣lar
<PB N="302" REF="315"/>
bodies of the ovaria, may fall into the uterus,
by entering the apertures at the extremities of
the Fallopian tubes, as the male fluid enters by
the orifice of the uterus itself; and, consequent∣ly,
that the foetus may be formed in the cavity
of the uterus, by the mixture of the two fluids,
in the manner already explained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Expansion, Growth, and Delivery of the
Foetus, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the expansion of the foetus, two different
species of growth are distinguishable: The
first, which immediately succeeds the formation
of the foetus, is not uniform in all the parts of
the animal. The nearer the foetus approaches
to maturity, the growth of the parts is more
proportional; and it is not till after the birth,
that all the parts grow nearly in an equable
manner. We must not imagine, that the foe∣tus,
at the time of its formation, has the exact
figure of an adult. The small embryo, it is
true, contains all the parts essential to a man;
but they differ in their successive expansion.</P>
<P>In an organized body, like that of an animal,
some parts may be supposed to be more essential
than others; and though none of them are use∣less
or superfluous, yet there are some to which
others seem to owe their growth and disposition.
Some parts may be considered as fundamental,
without which the animal could not exist, and
others as only superficial and accessory. The
<PB N="304" REF="317"/>
latter seem to derive their origin from the for∣mer,
and to be intended more for conferring
symmetry and external ornament on the animal,
than for enabling it to exist, or to perform the
functions essential to life. These two different
species of parts are successively expanded, and
are almost equally apparent at the time of birth.
But there are other parts, as the teeth, which
arrive not at full maturity till several years af∣ter;
and others, as the glandular bodies in the
female testicles, the beard of males, &amp;c. which
appear not till the age of puberty.</P>
<P>To discover the fundamental and essential
parts of an animal body, attention must be had
to the number, situation, and nature of the
whole. Those which are simple, those whose
position is invariable, and those without which
the animal cannot exist, must necessarily be the
most essential. Those, on the contrary, which
are double, or more numerous, those which
vary in size and position, and those which may
be taken away without injuring or killing the
creature, may be regarded as less essential, or
more accessory to the animal machine. Aristotle
mentions, that the only parts essential to all ani∣mals
are those with which they take and digest
their nourishment, and throw out the superflu∣ous
part of it from the body. The whole in∣testinal
canal is indeed extremely simple, and
no other part can supply its place. The head
and back-bone are likewise simple parts, the po∣sition
<PB N="305" REF="318"/>
of which is invariable. The back-bone
is the foundation of the animal frame; and the
action and movements of most members of the
body depend upon the spinal marrow which that
bone contains. It is this part, also, together with the
head, which appears first in the embryo. Now,
these simple parts, which are first formed, are
all essential to the existence and the form of the
animal.</P>
<P>The double parts in an animal body are more
numerous than the single parts; and they seem
to be produced on each side of the single parts by
a species of vegetation; for the double parts are
similar in form, and different only in position.
The left hand is perfectly similar to the right;
but, if the left hand was placed in the situation
of the right, we could not perform the same ac∣tions
with it. The same thing may be observed
of all the double parts: They are similar in
form, but differ in position, which is relative to
the body of the particular animal; and, if a line
were drawn, dividing the body into two equal
parts, the position of all the similar parts would
tend to this line as to a centre.</P>
<P>The spinal marrow, and the vertebrae in
which it is inclosed, appear to be the real axis
of all the double parts of the animal body, from
which they seem to derive their origin, and to
be only proportional branches issuing from this
trunk or common base; for, in the young chick,
we see the ribs shooting from each side of the
<PB N="306" REF="319"/>
vertebrae, as the small branches shoot out from
the principal branch of a tree. In all embryos,
the middle of the head and the vertebrae first
appear; we then see, on each side of the vesicle
which composes the middle of the head, two o∣ther
vesicles which seem to proceed from the
first: These two vesicles contain the eyes, and
the other double parts of the head. In the same
manner, we perceive an equal number of small
tubercles issuing from each side of the vertebrae,
which gradually extend, and form the ribs, and
other double parts of the trunk. Lastly, the
arms and legs appear like small tubercles on
each side of the trunk. This first growth is
very different from what afterwards takes place:
It is the production of parts which appear for
the first time; the growth which succeeds is on∣ly
an expansion of parts already formed.</P>
<P>The order and symmetry of the double parts
in all animals, their regular position, the equa∣lity
of their extension and growth, and the per∣fect
similarity of their structure, seem to indi∣cate,
that they derive their origin from the sin∣gle
parts; that a certain force resides in the sin∣gle
parts that acts equally on each side; or, which
amounts to the same, they are the bases or fulcra
against which the action of those powers that
produce the expansion of the double parts is
exerted; and that the action of these forces,
both on the right and left sides, are precisely
equal, and counterbalance each other.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="320"/>
Hence we may conclude, that, if there is any
defect, or redundance, in the matter destined for
the formation of the double parts, as the forces
are equal on each side, this defect or excess
must take place both in the right and left sides.
If, for example, from a defect of matter, a man
has but two fingers in the right hand, in place
of five, the same defect will appear in the left;
if, from an excess of matter, there be six
fingers in the right hand, he will have the same
number in the left; or, if the matter be vitiated,
and produces a change in the parts of one side,
the same change will appear in the other. Of
this fact we have daily proofs: The parts of
monsters are always deranged in a certain order
and proportion. Hence Nature, even in her er∣rors,
uniformly commits the least of possible
mistakes.</P>
<P>This harmony in the position of the double
parts of animals, is likewise apparent in vege∣tables.
The branches push out smaller ramifi∣cations
on each side; the small nerves in the
leaves are equally disposed with regard to the
principal nerve; and, if the symmetry appears
to be less exact in vegetables than in animals,
this proceeds only from its being more various,
and because its limits are more extensive, and
less precise. But the same order is easily recog∣nisable;
and the single and essential parts are
perfectly distinct from those which are double;
<PB N="308" REF="321"/>
and it is evident, that the latter derive their ori∣gin
from the former.</P>
<P>It is impossible to determine the form of these
double parts before their expansion, or in what
manner they are complicated, or what figure
results from their position in relation to the
single parts. The body of an animal, at the
instant of its formation, unquestionably con∣tains
all the parts of which it ought to be com∣posed:
But the relative disposition of these
parts is then very different from what after∣wards
appears. If we examine the expansion
of a young leaf of a tree, we will find that it is
plaited on each side of the principal nerve; and
that its figure, at this time, has no resemblance
to that which it afterwards assumes. When we
amuse ourselves with plaiting paper, in order to
give it the form of a crown, of a boat, &amp;c. the
different plaits of the paper seem to have no re∣semblance
to the figure which results from their
expansion: We only perceive that the plaits
are uniformly made in a certain order and pro∣portion,
and that, whatever is done on one side,
is also done on the other. But, to determine
the figures which may result from the expan∣sion
of any given number of folds, is a problem
beyond the powers of geometry. The science
of mathematics reaches not what immediately
depends upon position. Leibnitz's art of <HI>Ana∣lysis
situs</HI> does not yet exist; though the art of
knowing the relations that result from the posi∣tion
<PB N="309" REF="322"/>
of things would be, perhaps, more useful
than that which has only magnitude for its ob∣ject;
for we have more occasion to be acquaint∣ed
with form than with matter.</P>
<P>In the expansion of natural productions, the
folded or plaited parts not only assume different
positions, but they acquire, at the same time, ex∣tension
and solidity. Since, therefore, we are
unable to ascertain the exact result of a simple
expansion of a folded figure, in which, as in
folded paper, nothing takes place but a change
of position among the parts, without any aug∣mentation
or diminution of the quantity of
matter, how is it possible for us to judge con∣cerning
the expansion of the compound body of
an animal, in which not only the relative posi∣tion,
but likewise the quantity of matter in these
parts, suffer considerable changes? We can only
reason, therefore, on this subject, by drawing
conclusions from the examination of objects at
different periods of their expansion.</P>
<P>We, indeed, perceive the chick in the egg
before incubation: It swims in a transparent
fluid, contained in a small purse formed by a
very fine membrane in the centre of the cica∣trice.
But the chick is then only a particle of
inanimated matter, in which no organization or
determined figure can be distinguished. We can
perceive, however, that one of its extremities is
the head, and the other the back-bone. The
embryo, in this state, seems to be the first pro∣duct
<PB N="310" REF="323"/>
of fecundation, resulting from the mixture
of the male and female semen. To ascertain
this fact, several things require attention: When
the hen has, for some days, been along with the
cock, and afterwards separated from him, the
eggs produced 20 days or a month after this se∣paration,
are equally fertile as those laid during
her cohabitation with the male. The eggs pro∣duced
at the end of this period require only the
usual time of 21 days in hatching; and their
embryos are equally advanced both in form and
consistence. From this circumstance we might
be led to imagine, that the form in which the
embryo appears before incubation, is not the
immediate effect of the mixture of the two se∣minal
fluids, but that it existed in different
forms during the abode of the egg in the body
of the mother; for the embryo, in the form in
which we see it before incubation, requires only
the aid of heat in order to bring it to maturity.
Now, if this form of the embryo had existed
21 days or a month before, when the egg was
first impregnated, why was it not hatched by
the internal heat of the mother? Why do we
not find the chick compleatly formed in those
eggs which have been impregnated 21 days be∣fore
they are laid?</P>
<P>But this difficulty, though seemingly great, is
not insurmountable. When the hen cohabits
with the cock, the cicatrice of each egg, which
contains the semen of the female, receives a small
<PB N="311" REF="324"/>
quantity of the male fluid. The eggs in the o∣varium
of oviparous females are analogous to the
glandular bodies in the testicles of the vivipa∣rous:
The cicatrice of the egg corresponds to
the cavity of those glandular bodies which con∣tain
the female semen; and that of the male pe∣netrates
and mixes with it. The formation of
the embryo instantly results from this mixture
or union of the two fluids. The first egg laid
by the hen after her communication with the
cock, is fecundated and capable of being hatch∣ed.
Those which she is afterwards to lay were
all impregnated at the same instant: But, as
they want some essential parts, the production of
which has no dependence on the male fluid; as
they have neither the white, the membranes, nor
the shell, the small embryos contained in the
cicatrices of these imperfect eggs, are inca∣pable
of being hatched, though aided by the in∣ternal
heat of the mother. The embryo, there∣fore,
remains in the cicatrice, in the same state
in which it was first formed, till the egg acquires
all the parts necessary to the growth and nou∣rishment
of the foetus; and it is not till after the
egg has arrived at full perfection, that the ex∣pansion
of the embryo commences. This ex∣pansion
is effected by the external heat of incu∣bation:
But it is unquestionable, that, if the egg
could be retained in the body 21 days after it
was completely formed, the chick would be
hatched, unless the internal heat of the mother
<PB N="312" REF="325"/>
was too great; for the degrees of heat necessa∣ry
for hatching eggs are very limited; and the
least excess or defect is equally fatal to this ope∣ration.
The last eggs, therefore, laid by the hen,
containing the embryos in the same state as
the first, prove nothing more than the necessi∣ty
of their acquiring full perfection before they
can be hatched.</P>
<P>It is apparent, therefore, that the state of the
embryo when the egg is laid by the hen, is its
first state, and that which immediately succeeds
impregnation; that it undergoes no interme∣diate
changes of form; and consequently, by
tracing, as Malpighius has done, its gradual ex∣pansion,
hour after hour, we discover every
thing that it is possible for us to know, unless
we could perceive the mixture of the two fluids,
and the manner in which the particles arrange
themselves during the first formation of the em∣bryo.</P>
<P>If we reflect on this instantaneous fecundation
of a number of eggs, which are to be laid at succes∣sive
intervals, we shall discover a new argument
against the existence of eggs in viviparous ani∣mals:
For, if women contained eggs, like hens,
why are not many of them fecundated at the
same time? Why does not one impregnation
give birth to a successive race of children? And,
when women conceive two or three children,
why do they always come into the world at
the same time? If these foetuses were produced
<PB N="313" REF="326"/>
from eggs, would they not succeed each other
according to the different states of perfection of
the several eggs at the time of impregnation?
And, would not superfoetations be as frequent
as they are rare, and as natural as they are acci∣dental?</P>
<P>It is impossible to trace the gradual expansion
of the human foetus, as we can that of the chick
in the egg. The opportunities for observation
are few; and all we know of this subject is de∣rived
from the writings of anatomists, surgeons,
and accoucheurs. It is from collecting all their
particular observations, and comparing their re∣marks
with their descriptions, that the following
abridged history of the human foetus has been
compiled.</P>
<P>Immediately after the mixture of the two se∣minal
fluids, it is probable that the whole mate∣rials
of generation exist in the uterus under the
form of a small globe; for we learn from ana∣tomists,
that, three or four days after conception,
there is a small globular mass in the uterus, the
greatest diameter of which is about 6 lines, and
the least 4. This globe is formed by a de∣licate
membrane, which contains a limpid li∣quor
very like the white of an egg. We may
already perceive, in this liquor, some small fi∣bres,
which are the first rudiments of the foetus.
Upon the surface of the globe there is a net∣work
of delicate fibres, which extends from one
<PB N="314" REF="327"/>
of the extremities to the middle: These are the
first vestiges of the placenta.</P>
<P>Seven days after conception, the lineaments
of the foetus are distinguishable by the naked
eye. They are, however, very imperfect, and
have the appearance of a gelly almost transparent,
though it has acquired some degree of solidity.
The head and trunk may be easily distinguish∣ed;
because this mass is of an oblong figure, and
the trunk is longest and most delicate. Some
small fibres, resembling a plume of feathers, is∣sue
from the middle of the foetus, and termi∣nate
in the membrane in which it is inclosed.
These fibres are the rudiments of the umbilical
cord.</P>
<P>Fifteen days after conception, the head and
the most prominent features of the face are ap∣parent.
The nose resembles a small elevated
thread perpendicular to a line which marks the di∣vision
of the lips: Two small black points repre∣sent
the eyes; and we see two holes in place of ears.
The body of the foetus has also acquired some
growth. On each side of the superior and in∣ferior
parts of the trunk, those small protube∣rances
appear, which are the rudiments of the
arms and legs. The length of the whole body
is about five French lines.</P>
<P>Eight days after, in all three weeks, the body
of the foetus is only augmented about a line:
But the arms and legs are apparent. The
growth of the arms is quicker than that of the
<PB N="315" REF="328"/>
legs; and the fingers separate sooner than the
toes. The internal organization now begins to
be visible: The bones appear like fine threads.
The ribs are disposed on each side of the back-bone
like minute threads: The arms, the legs,
the fingers and toes, are also represented by si∣milar
threads.</P>
<P>At one month, the foetus is more than an
inch in length: It naturally assumes a curved
posture in the middle of the liquor that sur∣rounds
it; and the membranes in which the
whole is included, are both augmented and
thickened. The whole mass is of an oval figure,
the greatest diameter of which is about an inch
and a half, and the least about an inch and a
quarter. The human figure is no longer equi∣vocal:
All the parts of the face are already
distinguishable; the body is delineated; the
haunches and the belly are prominent; the
hands and legs are formed, and their fingers and
toes are divided; the skin is thin and transpa∣rent;
the viscera resemble a knot or plexus of
sibres; the vessels are like fine threads, and the
membranes are extremely delicate: The bones
are still soft, and it is only in a few places that
they have begun to assume some degree of soli∣dity.
The vessels which form the umbilical cord
lie parallel to each other in a straight line. The
placenta now occupies only a third of the whole
mass, instead of a half, which it did during the
first days; the superficial growth of the placenta,
<PB N="316" REF="329"/>
therefore, has not been so great as that of the
foetus and mass; but it has received a great
augmentation in solidity; it has become pro∣portionally
thicker than the membranes of the
foetus, both of which are now distinguishable.</P>
<P>According to Hippocrates, the male foetus
expands sooner than the female.</P>
<P>At the end of six weeks, the foetus is about
two inches long, and the human form begins to
be more perfect, only the head is very large in
proportion to the other parts of the body. A∣bout
this time the motion of the heart becomes
visible: In 50 days, the heart has been percei∣ved
to beat for a considerable time after the
foetus was extracted from the uterus.</P>
<P>In two months, the foetus is more than two
inches in length; and the ossisication is per∣ceptible
in the middle of the two arm-bones, in
the thigh and leg, and in the point of the under
jaw, which is then greatly advanced before the
upper. These, however, are only osseous points.
But, by means of a quicker growth, the clavi∣cles
are entirely ossified: The umbilical cord is
formed, and the vessels which compose it begin
to twist like the threads of a rope: But this
cord is very short in comparison of the length
it afterwards acquires.</P>
<P>In three months, the foetus is nearly three
inches long, and weighs about three ounces.
Hippocrates asserts, that at this time the motions
of the male foetus begin to be felt by the mo∣ther;
<PB N="317" REF="330"/>
but that those of the female are not per∣ceptible
till four months. Some women, how∣ever,
affirm that they have felt the motions of
the foetus at the beginning of the second month.
It is difficult to acquire any certain knowledge
on this subject: The sensations excited by the
first movements of the foetus depend more, per∣haps,
on the sensibility of the mother, than the
strength of the child.</P>
<P>Four months and a half after conception, the
length of the foetus is from six to seven inches.
All the parts are greatly augmented, and easily
distinguishable from each other: Even the nails
appear on the fingers and toes. The testicles of
the male are shut up in the belly above the kid∣neys.
The stomach is filled with a thick fluid,
similar to that which is contained in the amnios.
In the small guts we find a milky fluid, and a
black liquid matter in the great guts. There is
a small quantity of bile in the vesica felis, and
a little urine in the bladder. As the foetus
floats freely in the fluid that surrounds it, there
is always some space between its body and the
membranes in which it is contained. These
membranes, at first, grow more rapidly than the
foetus; but, after a certain time, the reverse
takes place. Before the end of the third month,
the head is bent forward; the chin rests on the
breast; the knees are elevated, and the legs
folded back upon the thighs. One of the hands,
and often both, touch the face. Afterwards,
<PB N="318" REF="331"/>
when the foetus acquires more strength, it per∣petually
changes its position, as we learn from
the following observations made by persons skil∣led
in the art of midwisery: 1. The umbilical
cord is often twisted round the body and mem∣bers
of the child, in a manner that necessarily
supposes different motions and positions. 2. Mo∣thers
feel the motion of the child sometimes on
one side of the uterus, and sometimes on the o∣ther;
and it often strikes against many different
places, which could not happen unless it assumed
different positions. 3. As the foetus swims in a
fluid which surrounds it on all sides, it may ea∣sily
turn, extend, and twist itself by its own
powers: It must likewise take different situations,
according to the various attitudes of the mo∣ther's
body; when the mother, for example,
lies down, the position of the foetus must differ
from what it is when she stands.</P>
<P>Most anatomists maintain, that the foetus is
obliged to bend its body, because it is too much
confined by the membranes. But this opinion
seems not to be well founded; for, during the
first five or six months, at least, there is room
more than sufficient to admit a full extension of
the foetus; and yet, during all this period, the
foetus is bended. We see likewise, that the
chick is bended in the liquor of the amnios,
while, at the same time, this membrane, and the
fluid it contains, afford room sufficient to hold a
body five or six times larger than the foetus. We
<PB N="319" REF="332"/>
may, therefore, conclude, that the bended po∣sture
of the foetus is natural, and not the effect
of restraint. I am inclined to think, with
Harvey, that the foetus takes this posture, be∣cause
it is most favourable to rest and sleep;
for all animals bend their bodies when they want
to repose themselves, or to sleep: And, as the
foetus sleeps almost continually, it naturally as∣sumes
this advantageous position. 'Certe,' says
this celebrated anatomist, 'animalia omnia, dum
quiescunt et dormiunt, membra sua ut pluri∣mum
adducunt et complicant, figuramque o∣valem
ac conglobatam quaerunt: Ita pariter
embryones qui aetatem suam maxime somno
transigunt, membra sua positione ea qua plas∣mantur
(tanquam naturalissima ac maxime in∣dolenti
quietique aptissima) componunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harvey de Generat. p. 257.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The uterus, as formerly remarked, grows
very quickly after pregnancy; and it continues
to increase proportionally with the foetus. But
the growth of the foetus at last exceeds that of
the uterus; and it is natural to think, that the
foetus, when near maturity, is too much con∣fined,
and agitates the uterus by repeated mo∣tions.
The mother feels those successive efforts,
which are called periodic pains, after the la∣bour
of child-bearing commences. The more
force the foetus exerts in order to dilate the u∣terus,
it finds an increased resistance from the
natural elasticity of the parts. Hence every ef∣fort
<PB N="320" REF="333"/>
tends to open the os tincae, or orifice of the
uterus, which has already been gradually en∣larged
during the last months of pregnancy.
The head of the foetus pushes along against the
margins of this orifice, and dilates it by a con∣stant
pressure, till the moment of delivery,
when it opens so wide as to allow a free passage
to the child.</P>
<P>What renders it probable that the labour-pains
are occasioned by the dilatation of the os
tincae is, that this dilatation is the only certain
mode of distinguishing the real from the false
pains. Women often feel very brisk pains,
which are not those that immediately precede
delivery. To distinguish those false from the
true pains, Deventer advises the accoucheur to
feel the orifice of the uterus, and maintains, that,
if the pains be true, the dilatation will augment
upon the occasion of every pain; and that, on
the contrary, if the pains be false, the orifice
will rather contract than dilate, or, at least, that
it will not continue to dilate. Hence we may
conclude, that these pains proceed not from a
forced dilatation of the orifice of the uterus.
The only thing that is embarrassing, is the alter∣nation
of pain and of ease experienced by the
mother. This circumstance does not perfectly
correspond with the cause we have assigned;
for the gradual and continued dilatation of an
orifice should produce a constant pain, without
any intervals of ease. Perhaps the alternations
<PB N="321" REF="334"/>
may be ascribed to the separation of the placen∣ta:
It adheres to the uterus by the insertions of
a number of small papillae. May we not,
therefore, suppose that these papillae separate
not from their cavities all at once; and that the
successive separation of these papillae gives rise, at
different intervals, to the fresh accessions of
pains? Here the effect perfectly corresponds
with the cause; and this conjecture may be sup∣ported
by another remark: Immediately before
delivery, there issues out a viscous whitish li∣quor,
similar to that which flows from the pa∣pillae
of the placenta, when torn from the u∣terus.
It is therefore extremely probable, that
this liquor, which issues from the uterus, is pro∣duced
by the separation of some of the papillae
of the placenta.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens, that the foetus escapes
from the uterus without bursting the membranes,
and, consequently, without discharging the li∣quor
they contain. This species of birth seems
to be the most natural, and is similar to that of
most animals. The human foetus, however,
commonly pierces the membranes, by the re∣sistance
it meets with at the orifice of the uterus:
And sometimes a part of the amnios, and even
of the chorion, is brought away adhering to the
head of the child like a cap. As soon as the
membranes are pierced or torn, the liquor, which
is called the <HI>waters,</HI> runs out, and, by lubrica∣ting
the vagina and orifice of the uterus, facili∣tates
the passage of the child. After the discharge
<PB N="322" REF="335"/>
of the waters, there is sufficient room left in the
uterus for the midwife to return the child, when
its position is unfavourable to the birth. After
the child comes into the world, the delivery is
not completed. The placenta and membranes
still remain in the uterus; and the child is at∣tached
to them by means of the umbilical cord:
They are easily brought away by the hand of
the midwife; and sometimes the weight of the
child is sufficient for that purpose. These or∣gans,
which were necessary to the existence of
the foetus, become useless, and even noxious to
the child, after its birth. They are, therefore,
instantly disengaged from the child's body, by
casting a knot on the umbilical cord, about an
inch from the navel, and by cutting the cord an
inch above the ligature. In six or seven days,
the remains of the cord dry up, and fall off close
to the navel.</P>
<P>By examining the foetus before birth, we are
enabled to form some ideas concerning the me∣chanism
of its natural functions. There are or∣gans
necessary to it while in the womb of the
mother, but which become useless immediately
after birth. The better to comprehend these
functions, we must explain more fully the na∣ture
of these accessory parts, the umbilical cord,
the membranes, with the liquor they contain,
and the placenta. The umbilical cord, which
is attached to the body of the foetus at the navel,
is composed of two arteries and a vein: By
<PB N="323" REF="336"/>
these the course of the circulation is lengthened;
but the vein is larger than the arteries. At the
extremity of the cord, each of these vessels di∣vide
into an infinite number of ramifications,
and extend themselves between two membranes.
They set off from the common trunk in such a
manner, that the whole ramifications assume a
round form, and are distinguished by the name
of placenta, because they resemble a cake. The
central part of the placenta is thicker than its
edges: Its mean thickness is about an inch, and
its diameter is eight or nine inches, and some∣times
more. The external surface of it, which
is applied to the uterus, is convex, and the in∣ternal
surface is concave. The blood of the
foetus circulates in the cord and in the placenta.
The arteries of the cord proceed from two large
arteries in the foetus, and carry the blood
through all the arterial ramifications of the pla∣centa;
and the blood is collected and returned
to the foetus by the venous branches of the pla∣centa
and the umbilical vein.</P>
<P>The concave surface of the placenta is cover∣ed
with the chorion: Its convex surface is also
covered with a soft membrane, which seems to
be a continuation of the chorion, and is easily
torn; and the foetus is inclosed in the double
covering of the chorion and amnios. The figure
of the whole is globular; because the intervals
between the foetus and membranes are filled
with a transparent fluid. This liquor is imme∣diately
<PB N="324" REF="337"/>
confined by the amnios, which is the in∣ternal
membrane: It is thin and transparent,
and folds itself round the umbilical cord, at its
insertion into the placenta, and continues to co∣ver
it the whole way to the navel of the foetus.
The chorion is the external membrane; it is
thick, spongy, and interspersed with blood-ves∣sels.
It consists of several coats, the outermost
of which covers the convex surface of the pla∣centa.
It sends off duplicatures to cover the
papillae, which are inserted into the cavities at
the fundus of the uterus, called <HI>lacunae.</HI> These
insertions connect the foetus to the uterus.</P>
<P>Some anatomists have maintained, that the
human foetus, like those of certain quadrupeds,
was furnished with an <HI>allantois,</HI> a membrane
destined for the reception of the urine; and they
have pretended to have discovered it between
the chorion and amnios, or in the middle of the
placenta, at the root of the umbilical cord, un∣der
the form of a pretty large bladder; and that
it received the urine by means of a long tube
which made a part of the cord, and which open∣ed
at one end into the bladder, and, at the others,
into the allantois, answering the same purposes
as the urachus in other animals. They acknow∣ledge,
however, that the urachus of the human
foetus is not near so large as in the quadrupeds;
but they assert that it is divided into a number
of small tubes, and that the urine passes into
their cavities.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="338"/>
To these facts are opposed the experience and
observation of most anatomists. They seldom
find any vestiges of an allantois either between
the chorion and amnios, or in the placenta;
nor do they perceive any urachus in the umbi∣lical
cord. A kind of ligament, indeed, runs
from the external surface of the bottom of the
bladder to the navel; but, when entering the
cord, it becomes so delicate as to be almost re∣duced
to nothing. Neither is this ligament
commonly hollow; and we can perceive no cor∣responding
aperture in the bottom of the blad∣der.</P>
<P>The foetus has no communication with the
open air; and the experiments made upon the
lungs demonstrate that they have never respired;
for they sink in water, while those of infants,
who have breathed, uniformly swim: The foe∣tus,
therefore, has no respiration in the womb
of the mother; consequently, it can make no
sound with its voice, and all the stories of chil∣dren
groaning and crying before birth must be
regarded as fabulous. After the waters run off,
however, the air may find admission into the
cavity of the uterus, and the child may begin
to respire before its birth. In this case, the
child may cry, in the same manner as the chick∣en
cries before the shell of the egg is broken,
which it is enabled to do by means of the air
lodged in a cavity between the external mem∣brane
and the shell: This air exists in all eggs,
<PB N="326" REF="339"/>
and is produced by the fermentation of the
matters they contain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vegetable Statics, chap. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lungs of the foetus, having no motion,
receive no more blood than is sufficient for
their nourishment and growth: Another passage,
therefore, is open for its circulation. The blood
in the right auricle of the heart, instead of pas∣sing
into the pulmonary artery, and, after cir∣culating
through the lungs, returning into the
left auricle by the pulmonary vein, passes direct∣ly
from the right to the left auricle, through an
aperture called the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> which is in
the partition of the heart that separates the two
auricles: The blood then enters the aorta, by
the ramifications of which it is distributed to
every part of the body; it is then taken up by
the numerous branches of the veins, which gra∣dually
unite into one trunk, called the <HI>vena cava,</HI>
that terminates in the right auricle of the heart.
The blood contained in this auricle does not all
pass through the foramen ovale; part of it e∣scapes
into the pulmonary artery, but it enters
not into the body of the lungs; for there is a
communication between the pulmonary artery
and the aorta, by an arterial canal which leads
immediately from the one to the other. It is
by these means that the blood circulates in the
foetus, without entering the lungs, which it
does in children, in adults, and in all animals
who respire.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="340"/>
It has been imagined by some, that the blood
of the mother passes into the body of the foetus,
by means of the placenta and umbilical cord:
They supposed, that the blood-vessels of the u∣terus
opened into the lacunae, and those of the
placenta into the papillae, and that they inoscu∣lated
with one another. But this opinion is
contradicted by experiment. When the arteries
of the umbilical cord are injected, the liquor re∣turns
by the veins, without any of it escaping
externally. Besides, the papillae can be drawn
out of the lacunae in which they are lodged,
without any extravasation of blood either from
the uterus or placenta; from both there oozes
out a milky matter, which, we have already re∣marked,
serves for the nourishment of the foe∣tus.
It is probable that this liquor enters the
veins of the placenta in the same manner as the
chyle enters the subclavian vein; and the pla∣centa,
perhaps, performs the office of the lungs
in maturating the blood. One thing is certain,
that the blood appears much sooner in the pla∣centa
than in the foetus; and I have often ob∣served,
in eggs which had been sit upon for a
day or two, that the blood appeared first in the
membranes, and that their blood-vessels are nu∣merous
and large, while the whole body of the
foetus, excepting the point where these blood-vessels
terminate, is only a white transparent
matter, in which there is not the least vestige
of blood.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="341"/>
It has been imagined that the liquor of the
amnios is a nourishment received by the mouth
of the foetus. Some have even pretended to
have found this liquor in the stomach, and to
have seen several foetuses who wanted the um∣bilical
cord entirely, and others who had only a
small portion of it, which had no connection
with the placenta. But, in this case, may not
the liquor have passed into the body of the foe∣tus
by the portion of the cord that remained, or
even by the navel itself? Besides, other facts
may be opposed to these: Foetuses have been
found, whose lips were not separated; and o∣thers
whose oesophagus had no aperture. To
reconcile these facts, some anatomists have main∣tained,
that the aliment passed into the foetus
partly by the umbilical cord, and partly by the
mouth. But none of these opinions seem to
have any foundation. The question is not, how
the foetus alone, but how the whole apparatus
of generation, receive their growth and nourish∣ment?
for the placenta, the liquor, and the
membranes, increase in bulk as well as the foe∣tus;
and, consequently, those instruments and
canals employed for receiving and transporting
nourishment to the foetus, are themselves en∣dowed
with a species of life. The expansion
of the placenta and membranes is equally diffi∣cult
to conceive as that of the foetus; and, it
may be said, with equal propriety, that the foe∣tus
nourishes the placenta, as that the placenta
<PB N="329" REF="342"/>
nourishes the foetus. At the commencement
of growth, the whole mass floats in the uterus,
without any adhesion; and, of course, the nou∣rishment
can only be conveyed by an absorption
of the lacteous fluid contained in the uterus.
The placenta appears first to attract this fluid,
which it converts into blood, and transports by
the veins into the foetus. The <HI>liquor amnii</HI> seems
to be nothing but this milky fluid in a purified
state, the quantity of which is augmented, by a
similar absorption, in proportion to the growth
of the membranes; and the foetus probably ab∣sorbs
this liquor, which seems to be necessary for
its growth and nourishment: For, it is worthy
of remark, that the foetus, during the first two
or three months, contains very little blood: It
is as white as ivory, and appears like a conge∣ries
of lymph somewhat consolidated; and, as
the skin is transparent, and all the parts extreme∣ly
soft, the body of the foetus may be easily pe∣netrated
by the fluid in which it swims, and thus
receive the matter necessary for its growth and
expansion. It may indeed be supposed that the
foetus afterwards receives nourishment by the
mouth; because we find a liquor, similar to that
of the amnios, in the stomach, urine in the blad∣der,
and meconium, or excrement, in the inte∣stines;
and, as neither urine nor meconium ap∣pear
in the amnios, it is natural to conclude,
that no excrements are voided by the foetus, e∣specially
as some are born without having the
<PB N="330" REF="343"/>
anus perforated, and yet large quantities of me∣conium
are found in their intestines.</P>
<P>Though the foetus has no immediate connec∣tion
with the uterus, but is only attached to it
by the small external papillae of the placenta;
though it has no communication with the blood
of the mother, but, in some measure, is equally
independent of her as the egg is independent of
the hen which covers it; yet it has been main∣tained,
that, whatever affects the mother, pro∣duces
a similar effect upon the foetus, and that
the impressions received by the former are com∣municated
to the sensorium of the latter. To
this imaginary influence have been attributed all
those resemblances, monstrosities, and peculiar
marks which appear on the skin of particular chil∣dren.
Many of these marks I have examined,
and they uniformly appeared to be occasioned
only by a derangement in the texture of the
skin. Every mark must necessarily have a faint
resemblance to something or other: But such
resemblances, I am persuaded, depend more on
the imagination of those who see them, than up∣on
that of the mother. On this subject, the
marvellous has been pushed to an extreme de∣gree.
The foetus has not only been said to bear
the real representations of the appetites of the
mother, but that, by a singular sympathy, the
marks which represent strawberries, cherries, &amp;c.
assumed a deeper colour during the season of
these fruits. A little attention, however, will
<PB N="331" REF="344"/>
convince us, that these changes of colour are
more frequent, and that they happen whenever
the motion of the blood is accelerated, whether
it be occasioned by the heat of summer, or by
any other cause. The marks are always either
yellow, or red, or black; because the blood gives
these colours to the skin when it enters in too
great quantities into the vessels. If these marks
were occasioned by the appetites of the mother,
why are not their forms and colours as various
as the objects of her desires? What a multitude
of strange figures would be exhibited, if all the
whimsical longings of a mother were written
upon the skin of the child?</P>
<P>As our sensations have no resemblance to the
objects which excite them, it is impossible that
desire, fear, horror, or any other passion or emo∣tion,
can produce real representations of the ob∣jects
by which they are occasioned. An infant
being, in this respect, equally independent of the
mother, as the egg is independent of the hen
that sits upon it, I should be equally induced to
believe, that the imagination of a hen, which
saw by accident a cock's neck twisted, should
produce wry-necked chickens from the eggs she
was hatching, as that a woman, who saw a man
broke upon the wheel; should produce, by the
mere force of imagination, a child with all its
limbs broken.</P>
<P>But, supposing this fact to be well attested, I
still maintain that the imagination of the mother
<PB N="332" REF="345"/>
could not be the cause of it: For, what is the
effect of horror? An internal movement, or, if
you please, a convulsion of the mother's body,
which might alternately compress and stretch
the uterus. What would be the result of this
commotion? Nothing similar to its cause; for,
if the commotion was very violent, the foetus
might be killed, wounded, or have some of its
parts deranged: But how is it possible to ima∣gine
that this commotion should produce in the
foetus any thing similar to the thoughts of the
mother, unless we suppose, with Harvey, that
the uterus possesses the faculty of conceiving
ideas, and of realising them upon the foetus?</P>
<P>But, if the imagination of the mother has no
effect upon the foetus, it may still be demanded,
Why did this child come into the world with
its members broken? Though a direct solution
of a fact, which is both extraordinary and uncer∣tain,
is not to be expected; yet, I think, this
question admits of a satisfactory answer. Phae∣nomena
of the most uncommon kind, and which
are but rarely exhibited, as necessarily happen,
as those that are usual and frequent. Among
the infinite combinations of which matter is ca∣pable
of forming, arrangements of the most pe∣culiar
and extraordinary species must sometimes
take place. Hence, out of the numberless chil∣dren
which daily come into the world, one may
sometimes appear with two heads, with four
legs, or with all its members broken. It is,
<PB N="333" REF="346"/>
therefore, within the circle of nature, that a
child, without the aid of the mother's imagina∣tion,
may be born with its arms and legs bro∣ken.
This phaenomenon may have been exhi∣bited
oftener than once; the mother of this
child may, during her pregnancy, have seen a
man broken on the wheel; and the defects of
conformation in the child may have been attri∣buted
to the impulse made, by this dreadful
spectacle, upon the imagination of the woman.
But, independent of this general solution, the
fact may be explained in a more direct manner.
The foetus, as formerly remarked, has nothing
in common with the mother. Its functions, its
organs, its blood, its movements, are all peculiar,
and belong to itself alone. The only matter it
derives from the mother, is the liquor or nutri∣tive
lymph which distills from the uterus. If
this lymph suffers any change, if it be infected
with the venereal virus, the infant is affected
with the same disease; and it is reasonable to
think that all the diseases which proceed from
viciated humours may be communicated from
the mother to the child. We know that the
small pox is communicated in this manner; and
we have too many examples of children, imme∣diately
after birth, becoming innocent victims of
the debauchery of their parents. The veneral
virus attacks the most solid parts of the bones;
and it appears to act with more force upon the
middle of the bones, which is the part where the
<PB N="334" REF="347"/>
ossification first commences, and is, of course,
the most hard and solid part. I conceive, there∣fore,
that the infant in question has been affect∣ed
with the venereal disorder while in the womb
of its mother, and that this was the reason why
it came into the world with its bones broken
through the middle.</P>
<P>The same effect might be produced by the
rickets: In the royal cabinet, there is a skeleton
of a rickety child, the bones of whose legs and
arms are joined in the middle by a callus: From
inspecting this skeleton, it appears that its bones
had been broken before birth, and afterwards re∣united
by a callus.</P>
<P>But we have dwelt too long upon a fact which
credulity alone has rendered marvellous. Pre∣judice,
especially that species of it which is
founded in wonder, will always triumph over
reason. It is needless to attempt to persuade
women that the marks on their children have no
connection with their ungratified longings. I
have sometimes asked them, before the birth of
a child, of what particular longings they had
been disappointed, and, of course, what marks
the child would bear? But I had only the satis∣faction
of perplexing, without convincing them.</P>
<P>The time of gestation is generally about nine
months; but it is sometimes longer and some∣times
shorter. Many children are born in the
seventh and eighth, and some not till after the
ninth month: But, in general, the births before
<PB N="335" REF="348"/>
the ninth month are more frequent than those
that exceed that term.</P>
<P>It is generally believed, that children born in
the eighth month cannot live, or, at least, that
more of them die than of those who come into
the world in the seventh month. This opinion
appears to be paradoxical; and, if we consult
experience, I believe it will be found to be er∣roneous.
A child born in the eighth month is
more perfectly formed, and consequently more
vigorous and lively, than one who is born in the
seventh. This opinion, however, is very com∣monly
received, and is founded on the authori∣ty
of Aristotle: 'Caeteris animantibus ferendi
uteri unum est tempus, homini vero plura sunt;
quippe et septimo mense et decimo nascitur,
atque etiam inter septimum et decimum positis;
qui enim mense octavo nascuntur, <HI>etsi minus,</HI>
tamen vivere possunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide de Generat. anim. l. 4. c. ult.</NOTE>.' The beginning of the
seventh month is the earliest term of delivery.
If the foetus be rejected sooner, it dies, and is
denominated an abortion. Thus the time of
gestation is more various in the human species
than in other animals; for it extends from the
7th to the 10th, and, perhaps, to the eleventh
month.</P>
<P>We are assured by women who have had ma∣ny
children, that females remain longer in the
womb than males. If this be true, it is not sur∣prising
that female children should sometimes be
<PB N="336" REF="349"/>
born in the 10th month. When infants come
into the world before the 9th month, they are
neither so large nor so well formed as those who
appear not till a later period. Those, on the
contrary, who remain in the womb till the 10th
month, are larger and better made; their hair is
longer; the growth of the teeth, though still
concealed within the gums, is more advanced;
and the tone of their voice is deeper and more
distinct.</P>
<P>With regard to the occasional causes of deli∣very,
there is much uncertainty. It is imagined
by some writers, that, when the foetus has ac∣quired
a certain size, the capacity of the uterus
becomes too small for its retention, and that the
restraint felt by the child obliges it to exert every
effort to break its prison. Others alledge, which
amounts nearly to the same thing, that the foe∣tus
becomes too heavy to be supported by the
uterus, which, therefore, opens to be discharged
of its load. Neither of these reasons appear to
be satisfactory: The uterus has always sufficient
capacity and strength to contain and support the
weight of a child of nine months; for it is often
loaded with two, during the same period; and it
is certain, that the weight and size of two chil∣dren
of eight months, for example, exceed those
of a single infant of the same age. Besides, it is
not unfrequent that a child of nine months is
less than another at eight months, though it still
remains in the womb.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="350"/>
Galen pretends that the foetus continues in
the uterus till it is able to take nourishment by
the mouth, and that the want of proper food
makes it restless, and anxious to escape. It has
been said by others, that the foetus is originally
nourished by the mouth, but that, in process of
time, the liquor amnii is so contaminated with
the urine and transpiration of the foetus, that it
becomes perfectly disgustful, and obliges the
child to use every method to effect its escape
from the womb.</P>
<P>These reasons seem not to be more satisfactory
than the former; for from them it would fol∣low,
that the smallest and weakest foetuses would
necessarily remain longer in the womb than
those of larger and more robust bodies; which
is by no means the case. Besides, it is not for
nourishment that the child, immediately after
birth, seems to be anxious; for it can dispense
with the want of it for a considerable time after:
It appears, on the contrary, to be extremely de∣sirous
of easing itself of the superfluous load of
nourishment (the meconium) received in the
womb. This circumstance induced Drelincourt,
and some other anatomists, to think, that the
acrimony and uneasiness, arising from an ac∣cumulation
of excrement in the bowels, is the
reason why they become restless, and use every
effort to escape from the womb. I am not, I
acknowledge, more satisfied with this explication
<PB N="338" REF="351"/>
than the others. If the child is pressed with
faeces, why does it not evacuate them in the
liquor amnii? But this never happens. It ap∣pears,
on thè contrary, that the necessity of eva∣cuating
the meconium is not felt till after birth,
when the motion of the diaphragm, occasioned
by respiration, compresses the intestines, and
gives rise to this evacuation; especially since no
meconium was found in the amnios of a foetus
of ten months, who had not respired, and since
an infant of six or seven months discharges the
meconium soon after respiration.</P>
<P>Other anatomists, and particularly Fabricius
ab Aquapendente, imagined that the foetus left
the uterus, from a desire of being refreshed by
respiration. But this cause seems to be as chi∣merical
as any that has been mentioned. It
is impossible that a foetus can have any idea of
respiration; and far less can it have any concep∣tion
whether respiration would be agreeable or
disagreeable.</P>
<P>After considering all these hypotheses, I su∣spect
that the delivery of the foetus depends on
a cause of a very different nature. The men∣strual
flux returns at stated intervals. Though
its appearance be interrupted by impregnation,
its cause is not destroyed; and, though no blood
is exhibited at the accustomed period; yet a re∣volution
in the system, similar to what happens
before impregnation, must take place. It is for
<PB N="339" REF="352"/>
this reason, that, in some women, the menses
are not entirely suppressed during the first two
or three months after conception. I imagine,
therefore, that this periodic revolution happens
as regularly after a woman has conceived as be∣fore;
but that the blood is prevented from
flowing, by the excretories of the uterus being
swelled and shut up, unless when it arrives in
such large quantities, and acts with such force,
as to overcome the resistance which is opposed
to it. In this case, a great quantity of blood
rushes out, and an abortion is the consequence.
But it frequently happens, that a small quantity
of blood appears, without producing this effect;
because the blood has only been able to open a
few of the canals or excretories of the uterus,
while the rest remain entirely obstructed.</P>
<P>Though no blood appears, which is generally
the case, the first revolution fails not to be ac∣companied
with the same painful symptoms.
During the first suppression of the menses,
therefore, the uterus is affected with a conside∣rable
agitation, which, when a little augmented,
entirely destroys the product of generation.
Hence, we may reasonably conclude, that few
of those conceptions, which happen a short time
before the accustomed return of the menses, are
successful; because the action of the menstrual
blood easily destroys the feeble roots of a germ
so tender and so delicate. Those conceptions,
on the contrary, which take place immediately
<PB N="340" REF="353"/>
after this periodic discharge, succeed much bet∣ter;
because the foetus is allowed more time to
grow, and to fortify itself against the action of
the blood, when the next revolution happens in
the system.</P>
<P>After the foetus has been enabled to resist the
action of the first revolution, the increase of its
growth, and of its attachment to the uterus, ren∣der
it still more capable of resisting any of the
subsequent revolutions: Abortions, indeed,
sometimes happen during every revolution; but
they are more rare in the middle period of ge∣station,
than either at the beginning or near the
end of it. Why they are more frequent at the
beginning, has already been explained: It only
remains to show why they are likewise more
frequent towards the end.</P>
<P>The foetus generally comes into the world du∣ring
the tenth revolution of the menses. When
it is born at the ninth or eighth, it lives, and is
not, therefore, regarded as an abortion. Some
have pretended to have seen instances of chil∣dren
born at the seventh, and even at the sixth
revolution, who, notwithstanding this unfavour∣able
circumstance, continued to live. There is
no difference between abortion and birth, but
what relates to the living powers of the child.
In general, the number of abortions in the first,
second, and third months, for the reasons already
assigned, is very great; and the number of pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="5+ letters" DISP="•••••…"/> births,
in the seventh and eighth months,
<PB N="341" REF="354"/>
is also very great, in proportion to the abortions
in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months; because,
during this middle term of gestation, the pro∣duct
of generation having acquired strength and
solidity sufficient to resist the action of the first
four periodic revolutions, a more violent effort
than any of the former is necessary to destroy
it. For the same reason, an abortion is more
difficult during the fifth and sixth months. But
the foetus, which till now was weak, and could
only exert its own force in a feeble manner,
begins to move with more vigour; and, when
the eighth revolution takes place, the efforts of
the foetus uniting with those of the uterus, and
facilitating its exclusion, the foetus may come
into the world in the seventh month, and be in
a capacity of living, whenever it happens to be
unusually strong at this period. But, if the foe∣tus
be excluded solely from a weakness of the
uterus, which renders it unable to resist the ac∣tion
of the blood during the eighth revolution,
the birth of it is considered as an abortion, and
the child dies. But such cases are uncommon;
for, it the foetus has resisted the first seven re∣volutions,
nothing but particular accidents can
prevent it from resisting the eighth, unless it has
acquired more vigour than is common at this pe∣riod.
A foetus which has acquired the same
degree of strength, but at a later period, will be
excluded at the ninth revolution; and those which
require nine months in obtaining this degree of
<PB N="342" REF="355"/>
strength, will be born at the tenth revolution,
which is the most usual term. But, when the
foetus acquires not this degree of strength and
perfection in nine months, it will remain in the
uterus till the eleventh, or even the twelfth re∣volution,
that is, till the tenth or eleventh month:
Of such late births many examples are record∣ed.</P>
<P>Other reasons, to confirm the opinion, that
the menstrual flux is the occasional cause of
births at different periods, may be produced.
The females of all animals which have no men∣ses,
bring forth very nearly at the same terms:
The difference in the times of gestation is ex∣tremely
small. We may, therefore, conclude,
that this variation, which is very great in wo∣men,
proceeds from the action of the menstrual
blood, which is exerted at every periodic revo∣lution.</P>
<P>We have already remarked, that the placenta
adheres to the uterus only by the papillae; that
there is no blood either in these papillae, or in
the lacunae in which they are inserted; and that,
when they are separated, an operation which
requires no great effort, a milky liquor only is∣sues
from them. Why, therefore, is the birth
of a child uniformly followed by a considerable
haemorrhage, first of pure blood, and afterwards
of blood mixed with a watery fluid? This blood
proceeds not from the separation of the placen∣ta;
for the papillae are drawn out of the lacunae
<PB N="343" REF="356"/>
without any effusion of blood. Delivery, there∣fore,
which is nothing more than this separa∣tion,
ought to produce no haemorrhage. Is it
not more natural, on the contrary, to think, that
the action of the blood is the cause of the birth;
and that it is this menstrual blood alone which
forces the vessels of the empty uterus, and be∣gins
to flow immediately after delivery, in the
same manner as it did before conception?</P>
<P>We know, that, for some time after conception,
the sack which contains the product of gene∣ration,
adheres not to the uterus. We have seen,
from the experiments of De Graaf, that, by
blowing upon the small globule, it is made to
change its position. The adhesion to the uterus
is never very strong: In the early periods of
gestation, the placenta is slightly applied to the
uterus; and those parts are only contiguous, or
joined by a mucilaginous matter which has hard∣ly
any adhesion. How, then, should it happen,
that, in abortions of the first or second month,
this globule never escapes without being attend∣ed
with a great effusion of blood? This effusion
cannot be occasioned by the passage of the glo∣bule,
which has no adhesion to the uterus. It
is by the action of the blood, on the contrary,
that the globule is extruded. Should we not,
therefore, conclude, that this is the menstrual
blood, which, by forcing the canals through
which it was accustomed to flow before impreg∣nation,
<PB N="344" REF="357"/>
destroys the product of conception, and
resumes its ordinary course?</P>
<P>The pains of child-bearing are principally
occasioned by this action of the blood; for, it
is well known, that they are equally violent in
abortions of two or three months, as in ordinary
births; and that many women feel, without ha∣ving
conceived, very acute pains, whenever the
menstrual flux is about to appear. These pains
are of the same kind with those which accompany
abortions or births. Ought we not, therefore,
to ascribe them to the same cause?</P>
<P>It appears, then, that the periodic revolution
of the menstrual blood has great influence in
child-bearing, and that it is the cause why the
terms of delivery in women are more various
than in other animals which are not subject to
this discharge, and which always bring forth at
the same times. It is also apparent, that the
revolution occasioned by the action of the men∣strual
blood is not the only cause of birth: The
action of the foetus itself contributes greatly to
this end; for there are instances of children ha∣ving
made their escape from the uterus after the
death of the mother, which could only happen
from an exertion peculiar to the foetus.</P>
<P>The terms of gestation in cows, sheep, and
other animals, are always the same, and no hae∣morrhage
attends their delivery. May we not,
therefore, conclude, that the blood discharged
by women after delivery is the menstrual
<PB N="345" REF="358"/>
blood, and that the action of this blood upon
the uterus, during every periodic revolution, is
the reason why the human foetus is excluded at
so many different terms? It is natural to i∣magine,
that, if the females of viviparous ani∣mals
had menses like women, their deliveries
would be followed by an effusion of blood, and
be equally various in their terms. The foetuses
of animals are brought forth covered with their
membranes; and it is seldom that the mem∣branes
are broken, or the waters flow before
their delivery. But the birth of a child, with
its membranes entire, is a rare phaenomenon.
This circumstance seems to evince, that human
foetuses make greater efforts to escape from
their prison than those of other animals, or that
the uterus of a woman affords not so free a pas∣sage
to the child; for it is by the struggles of
the foetus against the resistance it meets with at
the orifice of the uterus, that the membranes
are torn.</P>

<HEAD>RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>ALL animals are nourished by vegetables,
or by other animals which feed upon vege∣tables.
There is, therefore, in nature, a mat∣ter
common to both, which serves for the
growth and nourishment of every thing that
lives or vegetates. This matter can have no
other mode of effecting growth and nourish∣ment,
but by assimilating itself to every part of
the animal or vegetable, and by intimately pe∣netrating
the texture and <HI>form</HI> of these parts,
which I have distinguished by the appellation of
an <HI>internal mould.</HI> When this nutritive mat∣ter
abounds more than is sufficient for the
growth and expansion of the animal or vege∣table,
it is detached from all parts of the body,
and deposited in one or several reservoirs, under
the form of a fluid. This fluid contains all the
particles which are analogous to the different parts
of the body, and, of course, all that is necessary
for the reproduction of a being in miniature
perfectly similar to the first. In most animals,
this superfluity of nutritive matter does not take
place till they have nearly acquired their full
growth; and hence it is that animals are not
capable of generating before this period.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="360"/>
When this nutritive and prolific matter, which
is universally diffused, has passed through the
internal mould of an animal or vegetable, and
has found a proper matrix, it produces an ani∣mal
or vegetable of the same species. But,
when it finds not a suitable matrix, it produces
organized beings different from animals or ve∣getables,
as the moving and vegetating bodies
which appear in the seminal fluids of animals,
and in the infusions of the buds of plants, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This prolific matter is composed of organic
particles, which are always active, whose motions
and actions are fixed or arrested by the brute
parts of matter in general, and particularly by
oily and saline substances; but, as soon as they
are disengaged from this matter, which is fo∣reign
to their nature, they resume their action,
and produce different species of plants, and other
animated beings.</P>
<P>The effects of this prolific matter may be seen
by the microscope in the seminal fluids of both
male and female animals. The semen of vivi∣parous
females is siltrated through the glandu∣lar
bodies which grow upon their testicles; and
these glandular bodies contain a considerable
quantity of seminal fluid in their cavities. Ovi∣parous
females, as well as the viviparous, have
a seminal fluid, which is still more active than
that of the viviparous. The semen of the fe∣male
is, in general, similar to that of the male,
when both are in a natural state. They decom∣pose
<PB N="348" REF="361"/>
in the same manner; they contain similar
organic particles; and they exhibit the very same
appearances.</P>
<P>All animal and vegetable substances contain a
great quantity of this organic and prolific mat∣ter.
To discover it, we have only to sepa∣rate
it from the brute matter in which it is
entangled; and this operation is effected by
infusing animal or vegetable substances in water:
The salts melt; the oils separate; and the or∣ganic
particles become evident by their move∣ments.
They abound more in the seminal fluid
than in any other parts of animals; or rather,
they are there more disengaged from the brute
matter. Soon after flesh is infused, and while
it is only slightly dissolved, the organic matter
appears under the form of moving bodies, which
are nearly as large as those in the seminal fluid.
But, in proportion to the increase of the dissolu∣tion,
the size of the organic particles is diminish∣ed,
and their motion is augmented; and, when
the flesh is entirely decomposed or corrupted,
the organic particles are extremely minute, and
their motion is inconceivably rapid. It is then
that this matter may be poisonous, like that of
the viper's tooth, in which Mr Mead perceived
an infinite number of small pointed bodies, and
which he imagined to be salts, though they are
nothing but these same organic particles in an
extremely active state. The pus which pro∣ceeds
from wounds may acquire such a degree
<PB N="349" REF="362"/>
of putrescency, as to become a poison of the
most active kind; for, whenever this active
matter is exalted to a certain point, which may
always be distinguished by the rapidity and mi∣nuteness
of the moving bodies it contains, it
must become a species of poison. The same
thing may be remarked with regard to the poi∣son
of vegetables. The same matter which
nourishes us while in a natural state, will de∣stroy
us when it is corrupted, as appears from
the gangrenes which affect the limbs of men and
other animals, when they are fed with corrupt∣ed
grain; and from comparing the residue of
the food which adheres to our teeth, with that
which proceeds from the teeth of the viper or
of a mad dog, which is nothing but the same
matter too much exalted, and in the highest state
of putrefaction.</P>
<P>When large quantities of this organic and
prolific matter are collected in some part of an
animal, where it is obliged to remain, it there
forms living beings, which we have always re∣garded
as real animals. The taenia, the asca∣rides,
all the worms found in the veins, in the
liver, in wounds, in pus, and most of those which
are formed in putrified flesh, have no other ori∣gin.
The eels in paste, in vinegar, and all the
pretended microscopic animals, are only diffe∣rent
forms assumed, according to circumstances,
by this active matter, which has a perpetual
tendency to organization.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="363"/>
In infusions of all animal and vegetable sub∣stances,
this prolific matter first discovers itself
under the form of vegetation: We see it form
into filaments, which grow and expand like
plants; then their extremities and joints swell
and burst, to give passage to a multitude of mo∣ving
bodies which have the semblance of animals.
Nature, it would appear, begins all her opera∣tions
by a kind of vegetable motion: This mo∣tion
we perceive in a variety of microscopic ob∣jects,
and in the expansion of the animal embryo;
for a foetus, at first, possesses only a species of
vegetable growth or motion.</P>
<P>Sound food furnishes none of these moving
particles for a considerable time: Fresh meat,
grain, fruits, &amp;c. require some days infusion
before they exhibit any moving bodies. But
the more any matter is corrupted, decomposed,
or exalted, as pus, blighted grain, honey, the se∣minal
fluids, &amp;c. these moving bodies the sooner
make their appearance. In seminal fluids, they
are entirely free from other matter; and only a
few hours infusion are necessary to discover
them in pus, corrupted grain, honey, strong
drugs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The existence, therefore, of an organic ani∣mated
matter, universally diffused through all
animal and vegetable substances, and which e∣qually
serves for their nourishment, their growth,
and their reproduction, is apparent. Nutrition
is effected by the intimate penetration of this
<PB N="351" REF="364"/>
matter through every part of animal or vege∣table
bodies; expansion, or growth, is only a
more extensive species of nutrition, which pro∣ceeds
as long as the parts are ductile, and ca∣pable
of being stretched; and reproduction is an
effect of the same matter, when it superabounds
in the body of an animal or vegetable. Every
part of organized bodies sends off to proper re∣servoirs
the organic particles which are super∣fluous
for its nourishment: These particles are
perfectly similar to the different parts from
which they are detached, because they were
destined for the nourishment of those parts.
Hence, when the whole particles sent off from
every part of the body are assembled, they must
necessarily form a small body similar to the ori∣ginal,
because every particle is similar to the
part from which it was detached. It is in this
manner that every species of reproduction,
where only one individual is requisite, as that of
trees, plants, polypi, vine-fretters, &amp;c. is ef∣fected.
This is also the first method employed
by nature for the reproduction of such animals
as require the aid of different sexes; for the se∣minal
fluid of each sex contains all the particles
necessary for reproduction: But, to compleat
the operation, something more is requisite,
namely, the mixture of both fluids in a place
suited to the expansion and growth of the foe∣rus;
and this place is the uterus of the female.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="365"/>
There are, therefore, no pre-existing germs,
or germs infinitely contained within each other.
But there is an organic matter diffused through all
animated nature, which is always active, always
tending to form, to assimilate, and to produce
beings similar to those which receive it. The spe∣cies
of animals and of vegetables, therefore,
can never be exhausted: As long as individuals
subsist, the different species will be constantly
new; they are the same now that they were
three thousand years ago: The whole will per∣petually
exist by their own powers, unless they
be annihilated by the will of their Creator.</P>

NATURAL HISTORY

MAN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Nature of Man.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH man be much interested in ob∣taining
a knowledge of himself, yet I
suspect that he is better acquainted with every
other object. Endowed by Nature with organs
solely destined for our own preservation, we
employ them only for the reception of external
impressions. Anxious to expand our external
existence beyond the limits of our powers, and
to multiply the functions of our senses, we sel∣dom
employ that internal sense which reduces
us to our true dimensions, and distinguishes us
from every other being. If, however, we are
<PB N="354" REF="367"/>
desirous of knowing ourselves, we must cultivate
this sense, by which alone we are enabled to
form a dispassionate judgement concerning our
nature and condition. But how shall we give
to this sense its full extent and activity? How
shall we emancipate the soul, in which it resides,
from all the illusions of fancy! We have lost
the habit of employing this sense; its activity
is repressed by the tumult of corporeal sensa∣tions,
and parched with the heat of our passions;
the heart, the imagination, the senses, all con∣spire
to annihilate its exertions. Unchangeable,
however, in its nature, and invulnerable by its
essence, it continues always the same. Its
splendour may be obscured, without losing its
force; it may enlighten us less, but it guides us
with certainty. Let us collect those rays which
it still emits, and the darkness which surrounds
us will diminish; and, though the path should
not be equally illuminated from one end to the
other, we shall at least have a torch to prevent
us from wandering.</P>
<P>The first and most difficult step, in arriving at
a proper knowledge of ourselves, is to acquire
distinct ideas of the two substances of which we
are composed. Simply to affirm, that the one
is immaterial, unextended, and immortal, and
that the other is material, extended, and mor∣tal,
is only denying those qualities to the one,
which we know the other possesses. What real
knowledge can be acquired from this mode of
<PB N="355" REF="368"/>
negation? Such negative expressions can com∣municate
no positive idea. But, to say, that we
are certain of the existence of the former, and
less assured of that of the latter; that the sub∣stance
of the one is simple, indivisible, and has
no form, because it manifests itself only by a
single modification, which is that of thought;
that the other is less a substance, than a subject
capable of receiving species of forms relative to
our senses, which are all as uncertain and as va∣riable
as the organs themselves; is advancing
one step towards a distinct idea of the nature of
the two substances: It is ascribing to both dif∣ferent
and peculiar properties; it assigns to them
positive qualities, and enables us to institute a
comparison between them.</P>
<P>All our knowledge is ultimately derived from
comparison. What is absolutely incomparable,
must be incomprehensible. Of this God is the
only example: He cannot be comprehended,
because he can be compared with no other be∣ing.
But every thing which is susceptible of
being compared, and of being relatively viewed
in different lights, becomes a source of human
knowledge. The more subjects of comparison
which any object affords, the means of forming a
proper knowledge concerning it, are proportion∣ally
increased and facilitated.</P>
<P>The existence of the soul is self-evident: To
be, and to think, are, with regard to us, the same
thing. This truth is more than intuitive: It is
<PB N="356" REF="369"/>
independent of the senses, of the imagination, of
the memory, and of all our other relative facul∣ties.
But the existence of our bodies, and of
external objects, is doubtful to every unpreju∣diced
reasoner; for that extension in length,
breadth, and thickness, which we call our bodies,
and which seem to be so intimately connected
with us, is nothing more than a relation of our
senses; and the organs of sensation themselves
are only certain affinities with the objects which
affect them. Has the internal sense, the mind,
any thing common or similar to these organs?
Have the sensations produced by light or sound,
any resemblance to that subtile fluid which ex∣cites
the idea of light, or to that vibration of the
air which conveys to us the notion of sound?
These effects result solely from the necessary and
intimate relation that subsists between the eyes
and ears and the different matters which act up∣on
them. But, as we have demonstrated, that
there is no resemblance between sensations and
the objects which produce them, is not this a
sufficient proof that the nature of the soul is dif∣ferent
from that of matter?</P>
<P>We may, therefore, consider it as an establish∣ed
point, that internal sensation is totally dif∣ferent
from its cause; and we have already
shown, that, if external objects exist, they must
be very different from the ideas we form of
them; because sensation has not the most distant
resemblance to the objects by which it is excited.
<PB N="357" REF="370"/>
May we not hence conclude, that the causes of
our sensations necessarily differ from our notions
concerning them? That extension which we
perceive by the eye, that impenetrability of which
we acquire the idea by touching, and all the other
constituent properties of matter, may have no
existence; since our internal sensations of exten∣sion,
impenetrability, &amp;c. are neither extended
nor impenetrable, and possess nothing in com∣mon
with these qualities.</P>
<P>As the mind, during sleep, is affected with
sensations which are often different from those
excited by the actual presence of the objects,
is it not natural to think, that the presence of
objects is not necessary to the existence of our
sensations, and, consequently, that both mind
and body may exist independent of these objects?
For, during sleep, and after death, the body has
the same existence as before, though the mind
recognises not this existence, and, with regard to
us, the body entirely loses its being. Now I ask,
if any object that can exist, and afterwards be
no more, which affects us in a manner totally
different from what it is, and from what it has
been, can be so real as to leave no doubt of its
existence?</P>
<P>We may still, however, believe, though we
are uncertain, that something exists without us;
but we cannot hesitate concerning the real ex∣istence
of every thing within us. The existence
of the soul, therefore, is certain, and that of the
<PB N="358" REF="371"/>
body seems to be doubtful. The mind has one
mode of perception when we sleep, and another
when we are awake; after death, she will per∣ceive
in a manner still more different; and the
objects of sensation, or matter in general, may
then have no more existence with regard to her,
than our bodies, with which we have no farther
connection.</P>
<P>But, though we admit the existence of mat∣ter,
and that it exists in the very manner we per∣ceive
it; yet, on comparing it with the mind, we
shall find the latter endowed with qualities so op∣posite,
that we cannot hesitate concerning the
difference of its nature, and the superiority of
its rank.</P>
<P>It is impossible to recognise the mind under
any other form than that of thinking, which is
extremely general, simple, and uniform. This
form is not divisible, extended, impenetrable,
nor possesses any other quality of matter. The
mind, therefore, which is the subject of this
form, must be indivisible and immaterial. Our
bodies, on the contrary, as well as all external
objects, have many forms, each of which is com∣pounded,
divisible, and destructible; and the
whole are only relative to the different organs
by which we perceive them. Our bodies, and
matter in general, therefore, possess no constant,
real, or universal properties, which can enable
us to acquire a certainty of their existence. A
blind man has no idea of the images of bodies
<PB N="359" REF="372"/>
presented to us by means of light. A leper,
whose skin was insensible, could have none of
those ideas which originate from the sense of
feeling. A deaf man knows nothing of sound.
Supposing a person to be successively deprived
of these three instruments of sensation, the mind
would still exist, and manifest itself by its own
internal power of thinking. But, if you ab∣stract
colour, extension, solidity, and all the o∣ther
qualities of matter which have a relation to
our senses, matter, in this case, would be entirely
annihilated: The mind, therefore, is indestruc∣tible;
but matter may, and must perish.</P>
<P>The same reasoning applies to the other fa∣culties
of the mind, when compared with the
most essential properties of matter. The mind
wills and commands; the body obeys as far as
it is able: The mind can unite itself, in an in∣stant,
to the most distant or most elevated ob∣jects;
and nothing can prevent this union, when
she commands it to be effected. But the body
is incapable of uniting with any object; it
is wounded by every thing that makes too close
an approach to it. Every thing resists and be∣comes
an obstacle to its motions, which are na∣turally
slow. Is this will, then, nothing more
than a corporeal movement; and is contempla∣tion
only a simple contact? How could this
contact be effected with remote objects, or ab∣stract
subjects? Or how could this motion be in∣stantaneously
accomplished? Without space and
<PB N="360" REF="373"/>
time, the idea of motion is inconceivable. The
will, therefore, if it be a motion, is not a mate∣rial
motion; and, if the union of the mind with
its object be a contact, it must be a contact, or
rather an intimate penetration, at a distance!
qualities which are the reverse of those of mat∣ter,
and which, of course, can only belong to
an immaterial being.</P>
<P>But I am apprehensive of having dwelt too
long upon a subject, which, by some, may be
regarded as foreign to the nature of this work.
What connection, it may be said, have metaphy∣sical
remarks on the mind with natural history?
If I were conscious of abilities sufficient for the
discussion of a topic so elevated and extensive,
this reflection, I acknowledge, would not give
me any uneasiness; and I have abridged my
observations, solely because I despaired of being
able to comprehend a subject so immense, and
so important in its nature. Why should the
noblest part of man be rejected from his history?
Why thus preposterously debase him, by con∣sidering
him merely as an animal, while his na∣ture
is so different, and so superior to that of the
brutes, that nothing but the most brutal igno∣rance
could ever dream of confounding them?</P>
<P>Man, it is true, resembles the other animals
in the material part of his being; and, in the
enumeration of natural existences, we are obliged
to rank him in the clais of animals. But, in
nature, there are neither classes nor genera; all
<PB N="361" REF="374"/>
are mere independent individuals. Classes and
genera are only the arbitrary operations of
our own fancy: And, though we place man
in one of those classes, we change not his nature;
we derogate not from his dignity; we alter not
his real condition; we only assign him the first
rank among beings which resemble him solely
in the material part of his existence.</P>
<P>When we compare man with the animal
creation, we find in both a material organized
body, senses, flesh and blood, motion, and ma∣ny
other striking resemblances. But all these
analogies are external, and authorise us not to
pronounce, that the nature of man is similar to
that of the brute. In order to acquire a distinct
idea concerning the nature of each, it is neces∣sary
that we should have as complete a know∣ledge
of the internal qualities of animals as we
have of our own. But, as it is impossible to
know what passes within animals, or how to
rank or estimate their sensations, in relation to
those of man, we can only judge by comparing
the effects which result from the natural opera∣tions
of both.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, consider these effects; and,
while we acknowledge all the particular resem∣blances,
we shall only examine some of the most
general distinctions. The most stupid man, it
will be admitted, is able to manage the most a∣lert
and sagacious animal: He governs it, and
makes it subservient to his purposes. This he
<PB N="362" REF="375"/>
effects not so much by strength or address, as by
the superiority of his nature. He compells the
animal to obey him, by his being possessed of
reason, which enables him to project and to act
in a systematic manner. The strongest and most
sagacious animals have not the capacity of com∣manding
the inferior tribes, or of reducing them
to a state of servitude. The stronger, indeed,
devour the weaker: But this action implies on∣ly
an urgent necessity, and a voracious appe∣tite,
qualities very different from that which
produces a train of actions all directed to one
common design. If animals be endowed with
this faculty, why do not some of them assume
the reigns of government over others, and force
them to furnish their food, to watch over them,
and to relieve them when sick or wounded?
But, among animals, there is no mark of subor∣dination,
nor the least trace of any of them be∣ing
able to recognize or feel a superiority in his
nature above that of other species. We should,
therefore, conclude, that all animals are of the
same nature, and that the nature of man is not
only far superior, but likewise of a very different
kind from that of the brute.</P>
<P>Man exhibits, by external signs, what passes
within him. He communicates his sentiments
by words; and this sign is universal. The sa∣vage
and the civilized man have the same powers
of utterance; both speak naturally, and are e∣qually
understood. It is not owing, as some
<PB N="363" REF="376"/>
have imagined, to a defect in their organs, that
animals are denied the faculty of speech. The
tongue of a monkey has been discovered by a∣natomists
to be as perfect as that of a man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See M. Perault, History of Animals.</NOTE>.
The monkey, therefore, would speak, if it could
think. If the train of its thoughts were analo∣gous
to that of ours, it would speak the language
of men; and supposing the order and manner
of its thinking to be peculiar to the species, it
would still speak a language intelligible to its
neighbours. But apes have never been disco∣vere
conversing together. Instead, therefore,
of thinking in a manner analogous to man, they
seem not to have the smallest order or train in
their thoughts. As they express nothing that
exhibits combination or arrangement, it follows,
either that they do not think, or that the limits
of their thinking are extremely narrow.</P>
<P>As several species of animals are capable of
being taught to pronounce words, and even to
repeat sentences, this is an invincible proof that
the want of speech among animals is not owing
to any defect in their organs. Many other
brutes might, perhaps, be taught to articulate
words<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leibnitz mentions a dog that had been taught to pro∣nounce several French and German words.</NOTE>; but, to make them conceive the ideas
which these words express, is beyond the power
of art. They seem to articulate and to repeat
merely like an echo or a machine. They are
<PB N="364" REF="377"/>
defective, not in the mechanism of their or∣gans,
but in their intellectual powers.</P>
<P>Language implies a train of thinking; and it
is for this reason that brute animals are incapa∣ble
of speech: For, though we should allow them
to possess something similar to our first appre∣hensions,
and to our most gross and mechanical
sensations, it is certain that they are unable to
form that association of ideas in which alone the
essence of reflection and of thought consists.
They can neither think nor speak, because they
can neither join nor separate ideas; and, for the
same reason, they neither invent nor bring any
thing to perfection. If they were endowed with
the power of reflecting, even in the slightest de∣gree,
they would be capable of making some
progress, and acquire more industry; the pre∣sent
race of castors would build their houses with
more art and solidity than their progenitors; and
the bee would daily improve the cell which she
inhabits: For, by supposing that this cell has all
the perfection of which it is capable, we ascribe
to this insect a genius and understanding superi∣or
to the human, by which it is enabled, at one
glance, to perceive the utmost point of perfec∣tion
to which its work can be carried. But
man never can attain a clear view of this point:
Much time, reflection, and practice, are necessa∣ry,
before the meanest of our arts can be brought
to maturity.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="378"/>
Whence proceeds this uniformity in all the
operations of animals? Why does every species
perform the same work in the very same man∣ner?
And why is the execution of different in∣dividuals
neither better nor worse than that of
every other? Can there be a stronger proof that
their operations are only the results of pure me∣chanical
impulse? If they possessed a single spark
of that inward light which illuminates man∣kind,
we should find variety, at least, if not per∣fection,
in their works; every individual would
exhibit some difference in his mode of execution.
But such differences never appear: They all
work upon the same plan; their mode of acting
runs through the whole species, and is not pe∣culiar
to any individual: If, therefore, we a∣scribe
to animals a mind or soul, we must allow
but one to every species, of which each indivi∣dual
has an equal share: This soul would, of
course, be divisible, and, consequently, mate∣rial,
and very different from ours.</P>
<P>Why, on the contrary, is so much variety ex∣hibited
in the operations of men? Why does
servile imitation cost us more labour than origi∣nal
design? Because our souls are proper to us,
and independent of any other; and because we
possess nothing common to the species, but the
matter which constitutes our bodies, and by
which alone we have any resemblance to the
brute creation.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="379"/>
If internal sensation depended on corporeal
organs, should not as great a variety appear in
the operations of the same species of animals, as
in those of men? Would not those endowed
with finer organs build their nests, and their
cells, in a manner more solid, elegant, and com∣modious?
If any individual had more genius
than another, would it not be rendered conspi∣cuous
by its mode of acting? But nothing of
this kind is ever exhibited: The greater or les∣ser
perfection of corporeal organs, therefore, has
no influence upon the nature of internal sensa∣tion.
From this circumstance, we may safely
conclude, that animals possess no sensations of
this kind; that they neither belong to matter,
nor depend, as to their nature, upon the texture
of corporeal organs; and, of course, that there
is in man a substance totally distinct from mat∣ter,
which is the subject, and the cause that pro∣duce
these sensations.</P>
<P>But these proofs of the immateriality of the
human mind may be extended still farther. We
have often remarked, that Nature proceeds in
her operations by imperceptible degrees. This
truth, which otherwise admits of no exception,
is here totally reversed. Between the faculties
of man, and those of the most minute animal,
the distance is infinite. This is a clear proof,
that the nature of man is different from that of
the brute creation; that he himself constitutes a
separate class, from which there are numberless
<PB N="367" REF="380"/>
degrees of descent, before we arrive at the state
of the mere animal; for, if man were of the
same rank with the animals, there would be in
nature a certain number of beings less perfect
than man, and superior to any animal we are
acquainted with; and those intermediate beings
would descend imperceptibly from man to the
monkey tribes. But no such beings exist. The
passage is sudden from a thinking being to a
material one, from intellectual faculties to me∣chanical
powers, from order and design to blind
impulse, from reflection and choice to ungovern∣able
appetite.</P>
<P>This is a strong indication of the excellence
of our nature, and of the immense distance fix∣ed
by the bounty of the Creator between men
and animals. Man is a reasoning being; the a∣nimal
is totally deprived of that noble faculty:
And, as there is no intermediate point between
a positive and a negative, between a rational and
an irrational animal, it is evident that man's na∣ture
is entirely different from that of the animal;
that the latter only resembles the former in the
external or material part; and that, to form a
judgment from this material resemblance alone,
is shutting our eyes voluntarily against that light
which enables us to distinguish truth from false∣hood.</P>
<P>Having considered the internal nature of man,
and demonstrated the immateriality of his soul,
we shall next examine his external part, and
<PB N="368" REF="381"/>
give the history of his body. In the preceding
chapters, we have explained his formation and
expansion, and traced him to the very moment
of his birth: Let us now run over the different
ages of his life; and, after conducting him to
that period when he is separated from his body,
we shall leave it to moulder in the common
mass of matter to which it originally belonged.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Infancy.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING exhibits such a striking pic∣ture
of weakness, of pain, and of misery,
as the condition of an infant immediately after
birth. Incapable of employing its organs or its
senses, the infant requires every kind of succour
and assistance: It is more helpless than the young
of any other animal: Its uncertain life seems e∣very
moment to vibrate on the borders of death.
It can neither move nor support its body: It
has hardly force enough to exist, and to an∣nounce,
by groans, the pain which it suffers; as
if Nature intended to apprise the little innocent,
that it is born to misery, and that it is to be
ranked among human creatures only to partake
of their infirmities and of their afflictions.</P>
<P>Let us not disdain to consider that state in
which our existence commenced: Let us view
human nature in the cradle; and, leaving the
disgust that might arise from a detail of the cares
which infancy demands, let us inquire by what
degrees this delicate and hardly existing machine
acquires motion, consistency, and strength.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="383"/>
An infant, at birth, passes from one element
into another. When it escapes from the waters
which surrounded it in the womb of the mo∣ther,
it is exposed to the air, and instantly feels
the impressions of that active fluid. The air
acts upon the olfactory nerves, and upon the
organs of respiration. This action produces a
shock, a kind of sneezing, which expands the
chest, and gives the air a free passage into the
lungs, the vesicles of which it dilates. After
the air remains for some time, it is heated and
rarified to a certain degree, and the stimulus or
spring arising from the dilatation of the fibres
re-acts upon this rarified fluid, and expells it
from the lungs. We will not here attempt to
explain the causes of the alternate motion of
respiration, but shall confine ourselves to its
effects.</P>
<P>This function is essentially necessary to the
existence of man and of many other animals. If
respiration ceases, the animal must perish; when
once commenced, it never stops till death; and,
after the foetus begins to respire, it continues
this action without interruption. It is probable,
however, that the foramen ovale of the heart
does not close immediately after birth, and, conse∣quently,
that part of the blood must pass through
that aperture. The whole blood, therefore, en∣ters
not, at first, into the lungs; and a new-born
child may perhaps be deprived of air for a con∣siderable
time without suffocation. This con∣jecture
<PB N="371" REF="384"/>
seems to be confirmed by some expe∣riments
I lately made upon young dogs. I pro∣cured
a pregnant bitch, of the large gray-hound
kind, and, when just about to litter, I fixed her
so in a bucket full of warm water, that her hin∣der
parts were entirely covered. In this situa∣tion
she brought forth three puppies, which,
after being disengaged from their membranes,
were immersed in a fluid nearly of an equal
temperature with that of the amnios. After
assisting the mother, and washing the puppies in
this water, I suddenly removed them into a pail
of warm milk, without allowing them time to
respire. I put them into the milk, in preference
to the water, that they might have an opportu∣nity
of taking some food, if they found a desire
for it. I kept them immersed in the milk for
more than half an hour; and, when taken out
of it, all the three were alive. They began to
breathe; and they discharged a quantity of fluid
matter by the mouth. I allowed them to re∣spire
about half an hour, and again immersed
them in the warm milk, where they remained
another half hour. I then took them out: Two
of them were still vigorous; but the third seem∣ed
to languish: I therefore ordered it to be car∣ried
to the mother, which, besides the three
brought forth in the water, had littered other
six in the natural manner. The puppy which
was born in the water, and had continued one
half hour in warm milk, before it was allowed
<PB N="372" REF="385"/>
to breathe, and another half hour after it had
respired, seemed to be very little incommoded;
for it soon recovered, and was as active and live∣ly
as those which had received no injury. Of the
six that were brought forth in the air, I threw
away four; so that there remained only two
with the mother, beside the one that had been
littered in the water. I continued my experi∣ments
upon the other two which had been twice
immersed in the milk: After allowing them to
breathe about half an hour, I plunged them a
third time into the milk, where they remained
another half hour. Whether they swallowed any
of the milk, I could not determine; but, when
removed, they appeared to be nearly as vigorous
as before their immersion. Having carried them
to the mother, however, one of them died that
same day; but I know not whether its death
was owing to some accident, or to the injury it
received from being plunged into the milk, and
deprived of air. The other lived as well as the
first; and both grew up, and were equally vi∣gorous
as those which had not been subjected to
the experiment. I pushed these trials no far∣ther:
But I learned enough to convince me,
that respiration is not so indispensibly necessary
to the existence of a new-born animal, as to an
adult; and that, by employing certain precau∣tions,
it is, perhaps, possible to keep the foramen
ovale open, and, by this means, produce excel∣lent
divers, or a species of amphibious animals,
<PB N="373" REF="386"/>
which would be able to live equally in air or in
water.</P>
<P>The air, on its first entrance into the lungs,
generally meets with some obstacle, occasioned
by a fluid substance collected in the wind-pipe.
This obstacle is greater or less, in proportion to
the viscidness of the liquor. But the infant, at
birth, raises its head, which formerly reclined on
its breast; and, by this operation, the canal of
the wind-pipe is lengthened; the air, of course,
rushes in, forces this fluid into the cells of the
lungs, which it dilates; and, in this manner, the
mucous substance, which opposed the free pas∣sage
of the air, is diffused through the whole
substance of the lungs. The perpetual admis∣sion
of fresh air soon dries up this superfluous
moisture; or, if it should still incommode the
infant, it excites a cough, and is thrown off by
expectoration, which generally runs out of the
mouth, because the child has not yet strength e∣nough
to spit.</P>
<P>We can remember nothing that passes at this
early period of our existence. It is, therefore,
impossible to discover the feelings produced in
the child by the first impressions of the air. But
the cries and groans it utters immediately after
birth, are certain indications of the pain occa∣sioned
by the action of the atmosphere. Till the
moment of birth, the infant is accustomed to the
mild warmth of a tranquil fluid. It is, therefore,
consonant to reason, that the action of a fluid,
<PB N="374" REF="387"/>
unequal in its temperature, is too violent for the
lax and delicate fibres of a new-born infant. It
is equally sensible of heat and of cold: In every
situation it utters complaints; and pain appears
to be its first and only sensation.</P>
<P>Most animals are blind for some days after
birth. Infants open their eyes the moment they
come-into the world; but their eyes are fixed
and dull: They have not that lustre and bril∣liancy
they afterwards acquire; neither have they
those motions which accompany distinct vision.
But they seem to feel the impression of light;
for the pupil contracts or dilates, in proportion
to the quantity of light. A new-born infant
cannot distinguish objects; because the organs
of vision are still imperfect: The cornea is
wrinkled; and perhaps the retina is too soft and
lax for receiving the impressions of external bo∣dies,
and for producing the sensations peculiar
to distinct vision.</P>
<P>The same remark may be applied to the other
senses. They have not yet acquired that force
and consistency which their operation demand:
And, even when they arrive at this state, it is
long before the sensations of the infant can be
just and complete. The senses are instruments
of which we must gradually learn the use. That
of vision is the most noble, and the most won∣derful;
but, at the same time, it is the most un∣certain
and elusory. The sensations produced
by it, if not rectified every moment by the sense
<PB N="375" REF="388"/>
of touching, would uniformly lead us into false
conclusions. The sense of touching is the cri∣terion
of all the other senses: It alone is essen∣tial
to the animal existence, and is universally
diffused through every part of the body. But
even this sense is imperfect at birth: A new∣born
infant, indeed, discovers symptoms of pain
by its cries and its groans; but it has no expres∣sion
that indicates pleasure. It begins not to
smile in less than 40 days: It is about this time,
likewise, that it begins to weep; for its former
cries were not accompanied with tears. There
are no vestiges of the passions in the counte∣nance
of a new-born child. The features of the
face have not acquired that consistence and ela∣sticity
which are necessary for expressing the
sentiments of the mind. All the other parts of
the infant's body are extremely feeble; and
their motions are aukward and ill-directed. It
is unable to stand erect; its thighs and legs are
still bended, from the habit contracted while in
the womb of the mother; it has not strength
to stretch out its arms, or to lay hold of any
thing with its hands; and, if abandoned in this
condition, it would remain on its back without
being able to turn to one side or another.</P>
<P>From these remarks it appears, that the pain
felt by infants recently born, and which they
express by crying, is only a corporeal sensation,
similar to that of other animals, who likewise
cry the moment they are brought forth; and
<PB N="376" REF="389"/>
that the mental sensation commences not sooner
than 40 days after birth; for smiles and tears
are the effects of two internal sensations, which
both depend upon the action of the mind. The
former is an agreeable sensation, which origi∣nates
from the sight or remembrance of a
known and desirable object: The latter is a
disagreeable agitation, compounded of sympathy
and anxiety concerning our own welfare. Both
these passions presuppose a certain degree of
knowledge, and a power of reflecting, and of
comparing ideas. Smiles and tears are expres∣sions
of pleasure and pain peculiar to the hu∣man
species; for the cries, the motions, and
the other marks of bodily pains and pleasures,
are common to man and most of the other ani∣mals.</P>
<P>But we must now return to the material or∣gans
and affections of the body. The size of an
infant born at the full time is generally about
21 inches, though some exceed, and others fall
much below this standard. The breast of a
child of 21 inches, measured by the length of
the sternum, is about three inches, and only
two, when the infant exceeds not 14 inches in
length. At nine months, a foetus generally
weighs from 12 to 14 pounds. The head is
large in proportion to the body; but this dis∣proportion
gradually wears off, as the infant in∣creases
in size. The skin of a new-born child
is very fine, and of a reddish colour, its trans∣parency
<PB N="377" REF="390"/>
allowing a slight tint of the blood to
thine through. It is even alledged, that the red∣der
the skin of an infant is at birth, it will af∣terwards
become the fairer and more beautiful.</P>
<P>The form of the body and members of in∣fants,
recently after birth, is by no means per∣fect.
The parts are too much rounded; and,
even when the child is in high health, they have
a swollen appearance. A kind of jaundice ge∣nerally
comes on at the end of three days; and,
at the same time, there is milk in the breasts of
infants, which is squeezed out by the fingers.
As the growth of the child increases, the super∣fluous
juices and swelling of the parts gradually
diminish.</P>
<P>In some infants, a palpitation may be seen in
the fontanella, or open of the head; and, in
every child, the beating of the sinuses, or arte∣ries
of the brain, may be felt at this place. A∣bove
this opening, a species of scurf appears,
which is often very thick, and must be rubbed
off with a brush, when it becomes dry. This
matter seems to have some analogy to the horns
of quadrupeds, which likewise derive their ori∣gin
from an opening in the skull, and from the
substance of the brain. We shall afterwards
show, that the extremities of the nerves become
solid when exposed to the air; and that horns,
nails, claws, &amp;c. are genuine productions of this
nervous substance.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="391"/>
The fluid contained in the amnios leaves up∣on
the infant's body a viscid whitish matter,
which is sometimes so adhesive, that it requires
to be diluted with some mild liquid before it
can be removed. In this country, we always
wash the infant with warm liquors; but there
are whole nations, who inhabit climates much
colder than ours, where the infants are plunged
into cold water as soon as they are born, with∣out
receiving the smallest injury. The Laplan∣ders
are even said to leave their new-born in∣fants
in the snow till their respiration is almost
stopped with cold, and then throw them into a
warm bath. This rough treatment is continued
three times every day for the first year: And, af∣ter
that period, the children are bathed thrice a
week in cold water. The inhabitants of the
northern regions are firmly persuaded, that cold
bathing makes men more healthy and robust;
and, therefore, they enure their children to this
habit from their very birth. We are, indeed,
totally ignorant how far our bodies may be
rendered capable of suffering, of acquiring, or
of losing, by the power of habit. The savages
in the isthmus of America, when covered with
sweet, plunge themselves into cold water with
impunity: The women throw their drunk hus∣bands
into the rivers, in order the more speedily
to remove the effects of intoxication: The mo∣thers
bathe in cold water along with their in∣fants,
the moment after they are delivered; and
<PB N="379" REF="392"/>
yet much fewer of them die of child-bearing
than in other countries, where such a practice
would be regarded as extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>Infants, a few minutes after birth, and gene∣rally
after feeling the heat of a sire, discharge
urine, and likewise the meconium or excrement,
which had been formed in the intestines during
their abode in the womb. But this last evacu∣ation
does not always happen so soon; and,
when it is retarded during the first day, the
child is often affected with colic pains; the dis∣charge
must, therefore, be promoted by proper
remedies. The meconium is black; and, when
it is entirely purged off, the stools are of a whi∣tish
colour. This change generally happens on
the second or third day. The odor of the ex∣crement
becomes then more offensive than that
of the meconium; which is a proof that the
bile, and other bitter humours of the body, be∣gin
to be mixed with it.</P>
<P>The observation seems to confirm what was
formerly advanced concerning the growth and
nourishment of the foetus. We then remarked,
that the foetus was nourished by absorption,
and that it received no food by the mouth. This
change in the odor of the excrement is a proof
that the stomach and intestines of the foetus have
no action, or, at least, that they act not in the
same manner, as after the motions communica∣ted
to them by respiration; since it is only after
this period that digestion, and the mixture of
<PB N="380" REF="393"/>
the bile and pancreatic juice with the food, takes
place in the stomach and intestines. Thus,
though the bile and pancreatic juice are secreted
in the foetus, these liquors remain in their reser∣voirs,
and pass not into the intestines; because,
like the stomach, these reservoirs have yet no
motion or action sufficient to make them empty
their contents into the receptacles of the food.</P>
<P>Before the child is allowed to suck, we allow
it time to discharge the slime and meconium in
its stomach and bowels. As these substances
might sour the milk, and produce bad effects,
we first give the child a little wine and sugar, in
order to fortify its stomach, and to promote such
evacuations as are necessary to prepare it for re∣ceiving
and digesting its food. Ten or twelve
hours, therefore, ought to elapse, before the
child be allowed to suck for the first time.</P>
<P>The infant has hardly escaped from the womb
of its mother, and enjoyed the liberty of stretch∣ing
its limbs, when it is again condemned to a
more cruel and unnatural bondage. The head
of the little innocent is fixed; its legs are fetter∣ed;
and its arms are bound down to its sides;
and it is laced with bandages so strait, that it
cannot move a single joint. It is a fortunate
circumstance, when the swaddlings are not
drawn so tight as to stop respiration, or when
the midwife has the sense to lay the miserable
captive on its side, that the natural moisture may
spontaneously flow from its mouth; for it is de∣nied
<PB N="381" REF="394"/>
the liberty of turning its head to facilitate
this natural and necessary discharge. Is it not
an instance of superior wisdom in those nations,
who simply clothe their infants, without torment∣ing
them with swaddling-bands? The Siamese,
the Indians, the Japanese, the Negroes, the sa∣vages
of Canada, of Virginia, of Brasil, and al∣most
all the inhabitants of South America, lay
their infants naked into hanging beds of cotton,
or put them into cradles lined with fur. These
practices are both sensible and humane: The
restraint of swaddling-bands must be painful.
The efforts made by infants to disentangle them∣selves
have a more direct tendency to distort
their members, than any positions they could as∣sume,
if left in the full possession of liberty.
Swaddling-bands may be compared to the stays
worn by young girls, which occasion many
more deformities and diseases than they are in∣tended
to prevent.</P>
<P>If the efforts for liberty made by infants thus
fettered be hurtful, the inactivity to which they
are condemned is, perhaps, still more noxious.
The want of exercise retards the growth of their
members, and diminishes the strength of their
bodies; and, of course, those children who are
allowed full freedom of motion will be the most
vigorous and healthy. It was this motive that
induced the Peruvians to leave the arms of their
infants perfectly loose, in a wide swathing-bag:
Afterwards, when their children grew older,
<PB N="382" REF="395"/>
they put them up to the middle in a hole dug
out of the earth, and lined with linen; their
arms, by this contrivance, were at full liberty;
and they could move their heads, and bend their
bodies, without falling, or hurting themselves.
As soon as they were able to step, the breast was
presented to them at a little distance, to entice
them to walk. The children of Negroes are
often exposed to greater difficulties before they
can approach the nipple; they cling round one
of the mother's hanches with their knees and
legs; they adhere so fast, that they support
themselves without the assistance of the mother;
they lay hold of the breast with their hands;
and they continue to suck without inconveni∣ence
or danger of falling, though the mother
moves about or works at her ordinary labour.
These children begin to walk, or rather to creep
on their hands and knees, at the end of the se∣cond
month; and, by exercise, they acquire the
faculty of running, in this situation, with nearly
equal quickness as they do upon their feet.</P>
<P>Infants, recently after birth, sleep much; but
their sleep is often interrupted. As they likewise
require frequent nourishment, they ought to
have the breast once every two hours during the
day, and, in the night, as often as they awake.
At first, they sleep almost continually; and they
seem never to awake but when stimulated by
hunger or pain: Their sleep, therefore, gene∣rally
terminates by a fit of crying. As, in the
<PB N="383" REF="396"/>
cradle, they are obliged to lie in the same posi∣tion,
and are chained down by bandages, this si∣tuation
soon becomes painful. They are, besides,
often wet and chilled by their excrements, the
acrimony of which irritates their delicate and
sensible skin. In this condition, the efforts of
children are extremely feeble; and their calls
for relief are expressed by cries and groans.
This succour should always be speedily admini∣stered;
or rather the inconveniencies they feel
should be prevented, by frequently changing
part of their cloathing. The savages are so at∣tentive
to this article, that, though they cannot
change their furs so often as we do our linen∣cloths;
yet they supply this defect by employ∣ing
other substances, of which they have no oc∣casion
to be sparing. In North America, they
put wood dust, which they obtain from trees
that have been corroded by worms, into the bot∣tom
of the cradle, and renew it as often as ne∣cessary:
The children are laid upon this powder,
and covered with skins. Though this powder
may, perhaps, be as soft as our down-beds; yet
they use it not for the purposes of delicacy, but
because it quickly absorbs moisture of every kind.
In Virginia, they place the child naked upon a
board covered with cotton, and provided with
a hole for the passage of the excrement. The
cold in this country is unfavourable to such a
practice; but it is almost general in the east of
Europe, and particularly in Turkey. This pre∣caution
<PB N="384" REF="397"/>
has another advantage; it precludes all
kind of care, and prevents the dreadful effects
which too commonly result from the common ne∣gligence
of nurses. Nothing inferior to mater∣nal
affection can support that perpetual vigilance
and minute attention which the infantine state
requires. With what propriety, then, can such
exertions be expected from ignorant and mer∣cenary
nurses?</P>
<P>Some nurses desert their children for several
hours, without feeling the smallest anxiety: O∣thers
are so callous as not to be affected with
their cries. In this situation the unfortunate
infants seem to despair; they exert all the force
of which they are capable; and their cries only
cease when their strength is exhausted. This
excessive crying either occasions diseases, or at
least throws them into a state of lassitude, which
deranges their constitutions, and may have some
influence on their tempers. Indolent nurses are
guilty of another abuse: Instead of employing
proper means for pleasing the child, they rock
it violently in the cradle. This agitation con∣fuses
the brain, stops the crying, and, if long con∣tinued,
stuns the child into sleep. But this for∣ced
and unnatural sleep is only a palliative; it
removes not the original cause of complaint.
Long and violent rocking, on the contrary, may
disorder the stomach and head, and lay the foun∣dation
of future disorders.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="398"/>
Before putting children into the cradle, we
ought to be certain that they want nothing;
and they should never be rocked with such vio∣lence
as to confound or stun them. If they
sleep not sufficiently, a gentle and equal motion
may be employed. Neither should they be of∣ten
rocked; for, if they be once accustomed to
this motion, they will not afterwards sleep with∣out
it. Though children, when in health, should
sleep long without the assistance of art; yet their
constitution may be injured by too much of it.
In this case, they should be roused by gentle
motion, by soft and agreeable sounds, and by a∣musing
them with brilliant objects. This is the
period when they receive the first impressions
from the sense, which are, perhaps, of more im∣portance
during life than is generally imagined.</P>
<P>Infants always direct their eyes to the lightest
part of a room; and if, from the child's situa∣tion,
only one eye can see the most luminous
part, the other, for want of equal exercise, will
not acquire equal strength. To prevent this in∣convenience,
the foot of the cradle, whether the
light proceeds from a window or a candle, should
be placed opposite to the light: In this position
both eyes receive the light at the same time, and
consequently acquire, by exercise, an equal de∣gree
of strength: If one eye acquires more force
than the other, the child will squint; for I have
elsewhere proved, that an inequality of strength
in the eyes is the cause of squinting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'acad. des sciences, année 1743.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="399"/>
For the first two months, the infant should
receive no other food than the milk of the mo∣ther
or nurse; and, if its constitution be deli∣cate,
this nourishment alone should be continued
during the third and fourth month. A child,
however robust, may be injured, if any other food
be administered before the end of the first month.
In Holland, in Italy, in Turkey, and through
the whole Levant, children are allowed no other
food during the first year. The savages of Ca∣nada
nurse their children four or five, and some∣times
six or seven years. In our country, as
most nurses have not a sufficient quantity of milk
to satisfy the desires of their children, in order
to spare it, they give them, even from the be∣ginning,
a composition of boiled bread and milk.
This nourishment appeases hunger; but, as the
stomach and intestines are yet too weak to di∣gest
such a gross viscid substance, the children
are greatly hurt by it, and often die of indige∣stions.</P>
<P>The mile of animals, in cases of necessity,
may supply that of the mother: But then the
child should be obliged to suck the animal's teat,
that it may receive the milk in an equal and pro∣per
degree of heat, and that, by the action of
the muscles in sucking, the milk may be mixed
with saliva, which greatly promotes digestion.
I have known several peasants who had no other
nurses than ewes; and yet they were equally
<PB N="387" REF="400"/>
vigorous as those who had been nursed by their
mothers.</P>
<P>After two or three months, when the child
has acquired some strength, it may have food
somewhat more solid, as flour baked with milk,
a species of bread which gradually disposes the
stomach to receive common bread, and such o∣ther
nourishment as it must afterwards be ac∣customed
to.</P>
<P>The consistence of liquid food is thus gradu∣ally
increased, that the child's stomach may be
prepared to receive what is still more solid. In∣fants,
during the first year, are incapable of ma∣stication.
The rudiments of the teeth are still
covered with the gums, which are so soft, that
they can have little effect upon hard substances.
Some nurses, especially among the common peo∣ple,
first chew the food, and then give it to their
children. Before reflecting on this practice, we
must throw aside every idea of disgust, of which
children, at this age, have not the least concep∣tion.
They are equally disposed to receive nou∣rishment
from the mouth of the nurse, as from
her breasts. This custom seems to have origi∣nated
from some natural instinct, for we meet
with it in many countries which are exceedingly
remote from each other; as in Italy, in Turkey,
in most parts of Asia, in America, in the Antilles,
in Canada, &amp;c. As it is the only way by which
the stomachs of children can be supplied with a
proper quantity of saliva, I believe it is very use∣ful
<PB N="388" REF="401"/>
to them. If the nurse chews a bit of bread,
it is soaked in her saliva, which renders it fitter
for nourishment than if it had been diluted in
any other liquor. This practice, however, is
unnecessary after children are furnished with
teeth, which enable them to chew their food,
and to mix it with their own saliva.</P>
<P>The <HI>incisores,</HI> or cutting-teeth, are eight in
number, four in each jaw, and generally appear
about the seventh month, though, in some cases,
not till the end of the first year. These teeth
are often premature; for some children have
them at birth, and foetuses have been found with
them completely formed long before the ordina∣ry
time of gestation is finished.</P>
<P>The rudiments of the teeth are lodged in soc∣kets,
and covered with the gums: In the process
of their growth, they extend their roots to the
bottom of the socket, and break through the
gums. This process observes not the ordinary
laws of Nature, which act continually on the hu∣man
body, without occasioning any painful sen∣sation.
Here Nature makes a violent and pain∣ful
effort, which is often attended with fatal
consequences. Children, when teething, lose
their usual sprightliness, and become peevish and
fretful. The gums are at first red and swel∣led;
and, when the circulation of the blood is
nearly stopped by the pressure of the teeth,
they turn whitish. Children perpetually apply
their fingers to the affected part, in order to re∣move
<PB N="389" REF="402"/>
the irritation: To procure still farther re∣lief,
they are furnished with a piece of ivory,
coral, or any other hard smooth substance, which
they rub against the gums. This operation re∣laxes
the parts, affords a momentary cessation of
pain, renders the gums thinner, and facilitates
their rupture. But, notwithstanding every pre∣caution,
the rupture of the gums is always ac∣companied
with pain and danger. When the
gums are uncommonly strong and rigid, they
resist the pressure of the teeth for a considerable
time, and occasion a violent inflammation, which
often proves fatal. The simple operation of
cutting the gum, removes the inflammation, and
gives a free passage to the teeth.</P>
<P>The canine or dog-teeth, which are four in
number, and situated next to the cutting-teeth,
generally appear in the ninth or tenth month.
About the end of the first, or during the course
of the second year, the 16 molares or grinders,
four on each side of the canine-teeth, cut the
gums. But these periods vary greatly in differ∣ent
children.</P>
<P>The cutting-teeth, the dog-teeth, and the first
four grinders, are generally shed during the
fifth, sixth, or seventh year; and are commonly
replaced in the seventh year, though sometimes
not before the age of puberty. The shedding
of these 16 teeth is occasioned by the expansion
of the rudiments of a second set, which are si∣tuated
at the bottom of the sockets, and, by
<PB N="390" REF="403"/>
their growth, push out the first set. But there
is no second set below the other grinders; and,
therefore, they never shed but by accident, and
their loss is seldom repaired.</P>
<P>There are still other four teeth situated at the
extremity of each jaw. In some persons, these
teeth are entirely wanting: They seldom appear
before the age of puberty, and sometimes not
till a more advanced period. They are distin∣guished
by the name of <HI>Wisdom-teeth,</HI> and either
appear successively, or two at a time. It is ow∣ing
to this irregularity in the wisdom-teeth, that
the number of teeth is not uniformly the same,
which varies from 28 to 32. Women, it has
been alledged, have generally fewer teeth than
men.</P>
<P>Some authors maintain, that the human teeth,
like those of certain animals, would continue to
grow during life, if they were not constantly
worn down by grinding the food. But this
notion seems to be contradicted by experience;
for people who live upon liquid food have not
longer teeth than those who eat the hardest
kinds of aliment. Besides, those who hold this
opinion, probably mistake the tusks of certain
animals for their teeth. The tusks of the wild
bear, and of the elephant, for example, conti∣nue
to grow during life; but their increase,
after they arrive at their natural size, is extreme∣ly
doubtful. Tusks have a greater analogy to
horns than to teeth: But this is not a proper
<PB N="391" REF="404"/>
place for such discussions. We shall only re∣mark,
that, in children, the first set of teeth are
less solid, and more loosely fixed in their sockets,
than the second.</P>
<P>It has been often asserted, that the first hair
of children is always brown; and that, after it
falls off, it is replaced by hair of different co∣lours.
I am unable to determine whether this
remark be well founded; but the hair of most
children is fair, and often entirely white. In
some it is red, and in others black: But in all
those who are to have fair or brown complex∣ions,
the hair is more or less fair in early infan∣cy.
Those who are to be fair have generally
blue eyes; those who are to be red have yel∣lowish
eyes; and those who are to be brown
have eyes of a dark yellowish colour: But these
distinctions are imperfectly marked in children
recently after birth; because their eyes are then
almost always blue.</P>
<P>When infants are allowed to cry long and
violently, ruptures are frequently the conse∣quence
of the efforts it makes. These are easily
reduced by the application of bandages. But,
if this remedy be too long neglected, the disease
may continue during life. The limits to which
I have prescribed myself, permit me not to
mention all the diseases incident to children. I
shall only remark, on this subject, that worms,
with which they are often infested, are produ∣ced
from the nature of their food. Milk is a
<PB N="392" REF="405"/>
species of chyle, a purely nutritive substance,
without any mixture: It, of course, consists
entirely of organic and prolific matter, which,
when not properly digested by the stomach, and
applied to the nourishment and growth of the
body, assumes, by its natural activity, other
forms, and produces animated beings, or worms,
in such profusion, that the child is often in dan∣ger
of being destroyed by them. The bad ef∣fects
occasioned by worms might perhaps be
prevented, by allowing children to drink a little
wine; because fermented liquors have a tenden∣cy
to prevent the generation of worms: They
likewise contain few organic nutritive particles;
and it is chiefly by acting on the solids, that wine
communicates strength to the body; for it con∣tains
but little nourishment. Besides, most chil∣dren
are fond of wine; or, at least, they are
easily accustomed to drink it.</P>
<P>Though the bodies of infants be extremely
delicate, they are less sensible of cold than at
any other period of life. Their internal heat,
it would appear, is proportionally greater: The
quickness of the pulse in children seems to for∣tify
this opinion. Small animals, for the same
reason, have unquestionably more heat than large
ones; for the action of the heart and arteries
increases in proportion to the comparative small∣ness
of animals. This takes place in the same,
as well as in different species. The pulse of an
infant, or of a little man, is more frequent than
<PB N="393" REF="406"/>
that of an adult, or of a large man. The pulse
of an ox is slower than that of a man; a dog's
pulse is quicker; and the motion of the heart in
very small animals, as that of a sparrow, is so
rapid that the strokes can hardly be numbered.</P>
<P>The life of a child, till it be three years of
age, is extremely precarious. In the two or
three succeeding years, however, its life becomes
more certain; and, in the sixth or seventh year,
a child has a better chance of living than at any
other period. By consulting Simpson's tables
of the degrees of mortality at different ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Simpson's tables, published at London in the 1742.</NOTE>,
it appears, that, of a certain number of children
born at the same time, more than a fourth of
them died in the first year, more than a third
in two years, and at least one half in the first
three years. If this calculation be just, when a
child is born, we might lay a bet, that it would
not live above three years. This exhibits a
melancholy view of the human species; for,
though a man who dies at the age of 21 is ge∣nerally
lamented, as being prematurely deprived
of life; yet, according to these tables, one half
of mankind must die before the termination of
three years; and, consequently, every man who
lives more than three years, instead of complain∣ing
of his fate, ought to consider himself as pe∣culiarly
favoured by his Creator. But this mor∣tality
of children is not nearly so great in every
<PB N="394" REF="407"/>
place as in London: M. Dupré de S. Maur has
demonstrated, by a number of experiments made
in France, that one half of the children born at
the same time are not extinct in less than seven
or eight years; and, therefore, we might insure
the life of a new-born child for seven or eight
years. When a child arrives at five, six, or
seven years, it appears, from the same experi∣ments,
that its life is more certain than at any
other age; for we may then insure for 42 years
more. But, in proportion as it advances above
five, six, or seven years, the number of years it
will probably live constantly decreases. At 12,
for instance, the chance is equal only for 39
years, at 20 for 33<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, at 30 for 28, and so on,
till the age of 85, when the chance is equal for
three years more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tables at the end of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the growth of the human body, one thing
is exceedingly remarkable. The growth of the
foetus increases more and more, in equal times,
till it escapes from the womb. The growth of
the child, on the contrary, gradually diminishes,
in equal times, till the age of puberty, to which
it makes a sudden bound, and soon acquires its
full stature. The foetus, at the end of the first
month, is an inch long; at the end of the se∣cond
it is two inches and a quarter; in three
months, it is three inches and a quarter; in four
months, it is more than five inches; in five
<PB N="395" REF="408"/>
months, it is six and a half, or seven inches;
in six months, it is eight and a half, or nine
inches; in seven months, it is more than 11
inches; in eight months, it is 14 inches; and in
nine months, it is 18 inches. Though these
measures vary in different subjects, yet the uni∣form
result is, that the foetus, in equal times,
has continued to have a proportionally greater
increase. But, if a child at birth be 18 inches
long, it will not acquire, for the next 12 months,
above six or seven inches more; that is, at the
end of the first year, it will be 24 or 25 inches;
in two years it will only be 28 or 29 inches;
in three years it will be no more than 30, or, at
most, 32 inches; and afterwards, till the age of
puberty, it will not acquire above one and a
half, or two inches, every year. Thus the foe∣tus
grows more in one month, when near the
termination of its abode in the uterus, than the
child does in one year, till it arrives at the age
of puberty, when Nature seems to make a sud∣den
effort to bring her work to maturity.</P>
<P>For preserving the health of children, virtu∣ous
and wholesome nurses are of the utmost im∣portance.
We have too many melancholy ex∣amples
of certain diseases being communicated
from the nurse to the child, and from the child
to the nurse. Whole villages have, in this man∣ner,
been infected with the venereal virus.</P>
<P>Children, it is probable, would be much more
strong and vigorous, if they were nursed by
<PB N="396" REF="409"/>
their mothers, whose milk must be more agree∣able
to them than that of any other woman;
for the foetus is nourished in the womb with a
liquor which has a great resemblance to the
milk in the breasts. Thus the infant is, in some
measure, accustomed to the milk of the mother,
even before its birth. But the milk of another
woman is not only new to it, but is often of so
different a nature, that it is difficult to reconcile
the child to the use of it. We sometimes see
children, who cannot digest the milk of certain
women, languish and turn diseased; and, if
they are not speedily supplied with another nurse,
they soon perish.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more destructive to children
than the practice of crowding numbers of them
into the same hospital. Most of them die of in∣fectious
diseases, which they would certainly
escape, if they were brought up in separate
houses, and particularly at a distance from great
towns. The same expence would be sufficient
to support them; and numberless citizens, which
constitute the riches of a state, would, by this
simple and natural mode of treatment, be saved
to the public.</P>
<P>Children begin the difficult task of learning
to speak about the 12th or 15th month. They
pronounce the vowel A with most facility, be∣cause
it requires only the opening of the mouth,
and forcing out the air. E requires the tongue
<PB N="397" REF="410"/>
to be raised, at the same time that the lips are
opened. In pronouncing I, the tongue is still
more elevated, and approaches the teeth of the
upper jaw. O requires the tongue to be depres∣sed,
and the lips contracted; and, in the pro∣nunciation
of U, the lips must be still more con∣tracted,
and somewhat extended. The first con∣sonants
articulated by children are those which
require the least motion of the organs. B, M,
and P, are most easily pronounced. B and P
only require the lips to be joined, and then
opened with celerity; and for M, they must be
first opened, and then quickly shut. The arti∣culation
of the other consonants cannot be ef∣fected
without more complicated movements.
The pronunciation of C, D, G, L, N, Q, R, S,
and T, depends upon particular motions of the
tongue, which are not easily described. F re∣quires
a prolongation of sound beyond any of
the other consonants. Thus, of the vowels, A
is most easily pronounced; and, of the conso∣nants,
B, P, and M. It is for this reason that
children, in all countries, first begin to articulate
the words <HI>Baba, Papa, Mama.</HI> These words are
the most natural, only because they are most
easily pronounced; and the letters of which
they are composed must exist in every language.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, however, that, as the
sounds of several consonants are very similar,
as those of B and P, of C and S, of K and Q, of
<PB N="398" REF="411"/>
D and T, of F and V, of G and J, of G and K,
and of L and R, there may be many languages
in which these different consonants are not em∣ploved.
But, in every language, a B or a P, a
C or an S, a K or a Q, a D or a T, an F or a
V, a G or a J, an L or an R, are indispensible;
and, in the most contracted alphabets, there must
be at least six or seven consonants; because the
articulation of them is not complicated, and the
sounds by which they are uttered are all distinct
and different from each other. Children who
cannot easily pronounce R, substitute L in place
of it, and T in place of D; because the former
are more difficult to articulate than the latter:
And the softness or harshness of a language, de∣pends
on the choice of consonants which are more
or less difficult to pronounce. But it is needless
to enlarge upon this subject.</P>
<P>Some children, at two years of age, articulate
distinctly, and repeat whatever is said to them;
but most children require a longer time. It has
been remarked, that those who are long before
they learn to speak, never articulate with the
same facility as those who acquire that faculty
more early. The latter may be taught to read
before they are three years of age; and I have
known children read amazingly at four. But,
after all, it is difficult to determine whether any
advantages are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> derived from such premature
instruction. We have had so many examples of
<PB N="399" REF="412"/>
prodigies of learning at four, at eight, at twelve,
and at sixteen years, who turned out to be either
fools, or men of very little ability, at twenty-five,
that I am inclined to think, that the most
common mode of education, by which Nature is
not prematurely forced, and which is discreetly
proportioned to the strength and capacity of chil∣dren,
is still the best.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Puberty.</HEAD>
<P>PUBERTY commences where childhood
ends, and accompanies us through the af∣ter
periods of life. Before puberty, Nature seems
to have had nothing in view but the growth and
preservation of her work. The provision she
has made for the infant extends no farther than
the nourishment and expansion of its members.
It lives, or rather enjoys a kind of vegetable ex∣istence,
which is confined to itself, and which it
cannot communicate. But the principles of life
soon multiply: We are soon possessed of a stock,
sufficient not only for our own being, but which
enables us to bestow existence upon others. This
redundancy of life, the source of health and vi∣gour,
can no longer be confined, but is strongly
impelled to expand and diffuse itself. The age
of puberty is accompanied with several external
and internal marks. It is the spring of life; the
season of pleasure. May we be enabled to write
the history of this critical period, without exci∣ting
any ideas but what are strictly philosophical!
<PB N="401" REF="414"/>
In the history of man, puberty, circumcision,
castration, virginity, impotence, and many other
circumstances, are articles too essential to be o∣mitted.
We shall, therefore, endeavour to de∣scribe
them with that delicacy of style, that phi∣losophical
apathy, which annihilate every loose
desire, and bestow on words nothing more than
their simple and primitive signification.</P>
<P>Circumcision is a custom of great antiquity, and
is still practised over the greatest part of Asia. A∣mong
the Hebrews, the operation was performed
eight days after birth. In Turkey, it is delayed to
the seventh or eighth year, and sometimes to the
eleventh or twelfth. The children in Persia
are circumcised at the age of five or six; the
wound is healed with caustic or astringent pow∣ders;
and burnt paper is very generally used,
which, according to Chardin, is the best remedy.
This author tells us, that the operation, when
performed on grown persons, is attended with
considerable pain: That they are obliged to be
confined to the house three or four weeks; and
that death is sometimes the consequence.</P>
<P>In the Maldivia islands, children are circum∣cised
at the age of seven years. To render the
skin soft, they are bathed in the sea six or seven
hours before the operation. The Israelites made
use of a sharp stone: The Jews observe the same
mode in most of their synagogues. But the
Mahometans employ a knife or a razor.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="415"/>
An operation similar to circumcision is neces∣sary
in certain diseases. It is a common opi∣nion,
that the prepuces of the Turks, and of o∣ther
nations where circumcision is practised,
would naturally grow too long, if they were
not curtailed in childhood. Boulaye says, that
he has seen, in the deserts of Arabia and Meso∣potamia,
on the banks of the Tigris and Eu∣phrates,
numbers of Arabian boys whose prepuces
were so long as to render them incapable of ge∣neration,
without the aid of circumcision.</P>
<P>The people of the East have likewise longer
eye-lids than the inhabitants of other nations.
The skin of the eye-lids resembles that of the
prepuce. But what relation can take place be∣tween
the growth of those distant parts?</P>
<P>Girls as well as boys are circumcised, upon
the borders of the Persic Gulph and the Red Sea.
But these people never perform the operation
till the girls have passed the age of puberty; be∣cause
there is no redundance before that period.
In other climates, the excess of growth in the
nymphae appears more early; and is so gene∣ral
among certain people, as those upon the ri∣ver
Benin, that they circumcise both girls and
boys eight or ten days after birth. The circum∣cision
of females was an antient custom, even in
Africa. Herodotus mentions it among the u∣sages
of the Aethiopians.</P>
<P>Circumcision may, therefore, be founded on
necessity; it has, at least, propriety for its ob∣ject.
<PB N="403" REF="416"/>
But <HI>infibulation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word signifies the operation of tying or sewing parts together.</NOTE> and castration must have
arisen from jealousy alone. These ridiculous
and cruel operations have been invented by
gloomy and fanatical tyrants, who, actuated by
a mean envy, and a desire of monopolizing na∣tural
pleasures, enacted and enforced those bar∣barous
and bloody laws, which make privation
a virtue, and mutilation meritorious.</P>
<P>Boys are infibled by drawing the prepuce
forward, piercing it, and putting a small cord
through the holes, which remains till the cica∣trice
of the opposite sides be formed: The cord
is then removed, and a ring substituted in its
place, which is made of sufficient strength to last
as long as the person who ordered the opera∣tion
pleases; and sometimes it remains for life.
The eastern monks, who take on the vow of
chastity, employ a large ring, which renders a
breach of their oath impossible. We shall af∣terwards
mention the method of infibling fe∣males.
It is impossible to imagine any thing
too ridiculous upon this subject, which has not
been practised by some men, either from mo∣tives
of passion or of superstition.</P>
<P>During infancy, there is sometimes but one
testicle in the scrotum, and sometimes none. We
must not, however, conclude that children in
this situation are totally destitute of these parts.
It often happens, that the testicles remain in the
<PB N="404" REF="417"/>
abdomen, or are entangled in the rings of the
muscles. But time generally removes these ob∣stacles;
and the testes descend into their proper
receptacle at the age of eight or ten, and some∣times
not till the season of puberty. Parents,
therefore, have no reason to be anxious about
such of their children as seemingly have no te∣stes,
or but one. The testicles of adults are sel∣dom
concealed; because nature, at the age of
puberty, makes strong efforts to bring them to
light. The same effect is sometimes produced
by disease, or violent motion, such as a leap, a
fall, &amp;c. Even when the testicles never make
their appearance, the purposes of generation are
not frustraetd. Men of this kind are often en∣dowed
with uncommon vigour.</P>
<P>There are men who have but one testicle.
This defect, however, is inoffensive; for it is
always uncommonly large. Some men have
three, and are, on that account, said to possess
more vigour and bodily strength. We learn,
from the animal creation, how greatly these
parts contribute to strength and courage. How
different is an ox from a bull, a wedder from a
ram, and a capon from a cock?</P>
<P>The practice of castration among mankind is
very extensive, and of great antiquity. It was
the punishment of adultery among the Aegyp∣tians.
In the Roman dominions, the number of
cunuchs was considerable: At this day, these
mutilated males are employed through all Asia
<PB N="405" REF="418"/>
and part of Africa, as guards upon the chastity
of the ladies. In Italy, this infamous, this cruel
operation, has nothing for its object but the im∣provement
of the voice. The Hottentots cut
off one testicle, because they imagine that this o∣peration
renders them more swift in the chace.
In other countries, the poor people mutilate their
children, to make them incapable of procreation,
and to prevent them from feeling those excruci∣ating
pangs which they themselves suffer, when
they want bread to support them.</P>
<P>The species of castration vary according to the
object in view. When the improvement of the
voice is intended, the two testicles are only cut
out. But men, whose minds are inflamed with
jealousy, would not believe their females to be
safe in the custody of such eunuchs: They em∣ploy
none but such as have been deprived of the
whole external parts of generation.</P>
<P>But amputation is not the only means of ac∣complishing
this end. Formerly, the growth
of the testicles was prevented, and their struc∣ture
destroyed, without any incision: They ba∣thed
the infants in warm water and decoctions
of plants, and then pressed and rubbed the testi∣cles
for a long time, in order to destroy their
texture. Others compressed them with an in∣strument:
Some pretend, that this species of ca∣stration
does not endanger life.</P>
<P>The amputation of the testicles is not very
dangerous: It may be done at any age; the
<PB N="406" REF="419"/>
time of infancy, however, is always preferable.
But the amputation of the whole external parts
of generation is often fatal, especially if per∣formed
after the age of fifteen years. Even in
the most favourable time, which is from seven
to ten years of age, there is always great danger.
The difficulty of preserving eunuchs of this kind
render them exceedingly precious. Tavernier
informs us, that in Turkey, and Persia, they bring
five or six times the price of the other kind.
Chardin observes, that the total amputation is
accompanied with the most exquisite pain; that
it is performed pretty safely upon young chil∣dren;
and is exceedingly dangerous after the
age of fifteen; that hardly a fourth part escape
with life; and that the wound is never cured in
less than six weeks. On the other hand, Pietro
della Valle asserts, that those who suffer this pu∣nishment
in Persia for rapes, and other crimes
of that nature, heal easily, though advanced in
years; and that they apply nothing but ashes to
the wound. I know not whether those who
underwent the same punishment in Aegypt, as
Diodorus Siculus relates, escaped with equal ease.
According to Thevenot, vast numbers of ne∣groes,
who are forced by the Turks to submit to
this operation, perish, even when it is per∣formed
on children of eight or ten years of age.</P>
<P>Besides negro eunuchs, there are others at
Constantinople, throughout all Turkey, Persia,
&amp;c. who, for the most part, are brought from
<PB N="407" REF="420"/>
the kingdom of Golconda, the peninsula on this
side the Ganges, the kingdoms of Assan, Aracan,
Pegu, and Malabar, where their colour is gray;
and from the Gulf of Bengal, where they are
of an olive colour: There are some white eu∣nuchs
from Georgia and Circassia; but their
number is small. Tavernier says, that, when
he was in the kingdom of Golconda, in the year
1657, 22000 males were castrated. The black
eunuchs come from Africa, and especially from
Aethiopia. In proportion to the uggliness and
horror of their appearance, they are the more
esteemed, and bring a higher price. A very flat
nose, a frightful aspect, large thick lips, and, a∣bove
all, black teeth placed at a great distance
from each other, are admired qualities in a eu∣nuch.
These people have commonly fine white
teeth: But such teeth would be a capital defect
in a eunuch, who ought to be a hideous mon∣ster.</P>
<P>Eunuchs, who are only deprived of their testi∣cles,
have a lively sense of titulation in what re∣mains:
They have even the external sign more
frequently than other men. The part which re∣mains,
however, is generally small; for it con∣tinues
nearly in the same state in which it was
before the operation. A eunuch castrated at
seven years of age, when arrived at 20, is no
better, with regard to this affair, than a child of
seven. Those, on the other hand, who have
not undergone the operation till the age of pu∣berty,
<PB N="408" REF="421"/>
or later, have parts nearly equal to those
of sound men.</P>
<P>Peculiar relations subsist between the throat
and the parts of generation, though we are to∣tally
ignorant of their causes. Eunuchs have
no beard; their voice, though strong and pier∣cing,
can never reach a low or deep tone. Se∣cret
diseases often appear in the throat. The
remarkable sympathy which some parts of the
body have with others, though at a distance,
and of a different nature, is a subject too much
neglected: We are apt to despise effects, when
we cannot easily discover their causes. Hence
it is, that we never think of examining these re∣lations
or sympathies, although they are the
proper spring of the animal constitution. In
females, there is a remarkable sympathy between
the uterus, breasts, and head. How many cu∣rious
and useful facts of this nature might be
discovered, if physicians paid more attention to
this interesting subject? It would produce more
enlightened views, and a more extensive utility,
than can ever be expected from a mere register
of anatomical names. It is impossible to disco∣ver
the principles of animal motion: The springs
which give life to organization are not to be
found in the muscles, veins, arteries, and nerves,
described with such minuteness by anatomists.
Organized bodies are possessed of internal powers,
upon which the gross laws of mechanism have
no influence. Instead of attempting to discover
<PB N="409" REF="422"/>
these powers, by attending to their effects, they
have been treated as ideal existences; they have
ceased to be the objects of philosophical re∣search.
They have at last reassumed their native
importance in the laws of gravitation, in elec∣tive
attractions, in the phaenomena of electri∣city,
&amp;c. But, notwithstanding the evidence
and universality of their existence, as their ac∣tion
is internal, as they are solely objects of rea∣son,
and have little connection with the senses,
they are in danger of escaping our observation,
and we admit them with difficulty; for judg∣ment
is generally occupied and directed by ex∣ternal
objects. We never imagine that the in∣ternal
constitution of animated beings ought to
be a principal object of inquiry. We conceive
that the human genius is limited to external
objects; and, therefore, we overlook every thing
that might lead to a more refined and spiritual
philosophy.</P>
<P>The antients, less limited in genius, and pos∣sessed
of a more comprehensive philosophy, were
not astonished to meet with facts which were
inexplicable: They viewed Nature through a
more transparent medium. A peculiar corre∣spondence
or sympathy, was to them only a
phaenomenon; but, to us, because not reducible
to some fanciful laws of motion, it is a paradox.
They knew that Nature produced her principal
effects by laws concealed from human eyes:
They knew, that, to trace her various laws and
<PB N="410" REF="423"/>
modes of operation, exceeded the powers of our
circumscribed faculties. A certain number of
uniform and related effects, therefore, was to
them sufficient to constitute a cause, or law of
nature. Whether, according to the antients,
this sympathy shall be called a peculiar corre∣spondence
between different parts of the body,
or, according to the moderns, it shall be consi∣dered
as an unknown relation in the action of
nerves, its existence in the animal oeconomy is
universal; its effects, therefore, are of the utmost
importance to the theory of medicine, and can∣not
be too diligently scrutinized. But this is not
the place for a full investigation of such an im∣portant
subject. I shall only observe, that the
relation between the voice and the generative
organs takes place not only in eunuchs, but in
other men: It is even discoverable in females.
In men, the voice changes at the age of puberty;
and in women, who have a strong rough voice,
the passion of love is suspected to be violent.</P>
<P>The first symptom of puberty is a sense of
fullness and stiffness in the groins; which is most
perceptible when walking, or when the body is
bent forward. This stiffness is often accompa∣nied
with pretty smart pain in the different joints
of the limbs: It is likewise accompanied with a
new and peculiar sensation in those parts which
distinguish the sexes. Small whitish tubercles
also begin to appear in these parts, which are the
germs of their natural veil. The voice, for a
considerable time, is rough and unequal; after
<PB N="411" REF="424"/>
which it becomes more full, articulate, and strong.
This change is very conspicuous in boys; but it
is less distinguishable in girls, because their voices
are naturally more sharp.</P>
<P>These marks of puberty are common to both
sexes: But each sex has marks peculiar to itself;
as the eruption of the menses, and the expansion
of the breasts in women; the beard and faculty
of procreating in men. These marks, indeed,
are not always uniform. The beard, for ex∣ample,
does not always appear precisely at the
age of puberty: There are even whole nations
who have hardly any beard. On the contrary,
there is no country where the age of puberty in
women is not distinguished by the enlargement
of the breasts.</P>
<P>Among every race of mankind, the females
arrive at puberty sooner than the males. But
the age of puberty is very different in different
countries. It seems to depend upon the tempe∣rature
of the climate and the quality of the food.
The children of citizens and of opulent parents,
who are generally fed with rich and nourishing
victuals, arrive sooner at this state. But chil∣dren
brought up in the country, or whose pa∣rents
are poor, require two or three years long∣er;
because their food is not only bad, but given
too sparingly. In the southern parts of Europe,
and in cities, girls arrive at puberty about the
age of 12, and boys about 14. But, in northern
climates, and in the country, girls hardly come
<PB N="412" REF="425"/>
to maturity till they are 14, and boys not before
16.</P>
<P>It may be asked, Why are the females, in all
climates, capable of procreating sooner than the
males? The answer is easy: The bodies of men
are larger and stronger; their bones are harder,
and their muscles more compact; a longer time
is therefore necessary for their growth. Besides,
as the growth of the body must be nearly com∣pleat
before a superfluous quantity of organic
juices can be accumulated in the parts destined
for generation, women, of course, must arrive
at maturity sooner than men.</P>
<P>In the warmest climates of Asia, Africa, and
America, the age of puberty commences in girls
at ten, and sometimes at nine. The periodic dis∣charge,
though less abundant in warm climates,
appears much sooner. The interval is nearly the
same in all nations. With regard to time, a
greater diversity takes place between individuals
than between nations. In the same climate and
nation, some females suffer this evacuation every
15 days; others have an interval of six weeks:
But a month, or a few days more or less, is the
most usual period.</P>
<P>The quantity evacuated seems to depend up∣on
the quantity of nourishment and of insensible
perspiration. The discharge is greatest in fe∣males
who eat largely and take little exercise:
It is least in warm countries, where the perspi∣ration
is more copious. The quantity of this
<PB N="413" REF="426"/>
discharge has been variously estimated. It is
indeed difficult to make an accurate measure. In
different subjects, and different circumstances, it
varies from one or two ounces to a pound, and
even more. It generally continues to flow three,
four, or five days; but sometimes it remains for
six, seven, and even eight days. The cause of
this discharge is generally ascribed to a superflui∣ty
of blood and nutritious juices. The symptoms
which precede it are certain indications of a
plethora, as heat, tension, swelling, and the
pains felt not only in the parts themselves, and
their environs, but in the mammae, which also
swell, and discover a superabundance of blood
by the colour of the areolae becoming then more
deep: The eyes likewise are heavy, and the skin
below the orbits takes on a faint blue or a violet
colour: The cheeks glow; the head is heavy
and affected with pain; and, in a word, the
whole body is oppressed with a surcharge of
blood.</P>
<P>The growth of the body, in length, generally
terminates at the age of puberty. Before this
period, young people commonly shoot up several
inches in a very short time. But the quickness
of growth is most remarkable in the parts of ge∣neration
of both sexes. In males, this growth
is only an augmentation in size: But, in females,
it often produces a shrinking of some of the
parts, which has received different appellations
<PB N="414" REF="427"/>
from those who have treated of the signs of vir∣ginity.</P>
<P>Men, jealous of pre-eminence of every kind,
have always discovered a remarkable attachment
to prior and exclusive possessions. This species
of folly has bestowed a physical existence upon
female virginity. Virginity, which is a mo∣ral
being, a virtue existing solely in purity of
heart, has been metamorphosed into a physical
object, in which most men think themselves
deeply interested. This notion, accordingly, has
given rise to many absurd opinions, customs, ce∣remonies,
and superstitions; it has even given
authority to pains and punishments, to the most
illicit abuses, and to practices which shock huma∣nity.
Young women have been obliged to sub∣mit
to the examinations of ignorant matrons,
and to expose the secrets of nature to the eyes
of prejudised physicians. They did not reflect,
that every indecency of this kind is a violent at∣tack
against chastity; that every situation which
produces an internal blush, is a real prostitution.</P>
<P>I have little hope of being able to eradicate
the ridiculous prejudices which have been form∣ed
on this subject. Mankind always believe
what they wish to be true, however vain and
unreasonable the foundations of their faith. But,
as it is the province of history to narrate not on∣ly
the succession of events, and the circumstances
of facts, but likewise the origin of popular opi∣nions
and errors, I think it a necessary article in
<PB N="415" REF="428"/>
the history of man, to examine this favourite i∣dol
which he adores, to consider the reasonable∣ness
of his worship, and to inquire whether Vir∣ginity
be a real or a fabulous divinity.</P>
<P>Fallopius, Vesalius, Diemerbroek, Riolan,
Bartholin, Heister, Ruysch, and some other ana∣tomists,
maintain, that the membrane of the hy∣men
has a real existence, and that it ought to be
reckoned among the parts of generation peculi∣ar
to females. They assert, that it is a fleshy mem∣brane,
very thin in infants, but thicker in a∣dults;
that it is situated under the orifice of the
urethra, and nearly shuts up the entrance of the
vagina; that it is perforated by a round or
oval hole, so small as hardly to admit a pea
during infancy, or a large bean at the age of
puberty. The hymen, according to Winslow,
is a membranous fold, sometimes circular, and
sometimes semilunar, with an aperture of a smal∣ler
or greater size in different subjects, &amp;c. On
the other hand, Ambrose Paré, Dulaurent, Graaf,
Pineus, Dionis, Mauriceau, Palfyn, and other
anatomists of equal authority with those former∣ly
mentioned, insist, that the membrane of the
hymen is a mere chimera; that it is not natural
to young girls; and express their astonishment
that any man should talk of it as a thing which
has a real and uniform existence. They pro∣duce
a multitude of experiments and observa∣tions
made upon subjects of different ages, in
which they could never discover any appearance
<PB N="416" REF="429"/>
of this membrane. They acknowledge, that
they have sometimes, but very seldom, seen those
fleshy protuberances called carunculae myrti∣formes
connected by a membrane; but they
maintain that this membrane was preternatu∣ral.
Anatomists are not less divided with regard
to the number and qualities of these carunculae.
Are they only rugosities of the vagina? Are they
distinct and separate parts? Are they the remains
of the hymen? Is their number uniform? Does
only one, or many, accompany the state of vir∣ginity?
All these questions have been stated, and
each has received a different solution.</P>
<P>This opposition of sentiment, in a matter
which depends on inspection, is an incontestible
proof, that mankind have often an ardent desire
to discover things in Nature which exist only in
their own imaginations. Many anatomists of
reputation have never been able to discover ei∣ther
the hymen or carunculae, even before the
age of puberty. Those who support the con∣trary
opinion, at the same time acknowledge,
that these parts are not always the same; that
their form, size, and texture, vary in different
subjects; that, in place of the hymen, some∣times
there is but one caruncula, at other times
there are two or more united by a membrane;
that the shape of the aperture is not uniform,
&amp;c. What is the consequence? We must con∣clude,
that the causes of this mark of virginity
are equivocal and inconstant; and that, even
<PB N="417" REF="430"/>
when they have existence, they produce only an
effect of a transient and variable nature. Ana∣tomy
determines nothing with regard to the ex∣istence
of the hymen and carunculae; it allows
us to reject these symptoms of virginity, be∣cause
they are not only uncertain, but imaginary.</P>
<P>The effusion of blood, though a more com∣mon
symptom, is not less equivocal. It has, in
all ages, been regarded as an infallible proof of
virginity. But it amounts to nothing, in all
those cases where the entrance of the vagina is
naturally relaxed or dilated. Besides, the effu∣sion
of blood is not peculiar to virgins. Women
who have no pretensions to virginity frequent∣ly
experience this discharge. Some discharge
copiously and often; others a small quantity,
and only once; and some have no such effusion.
This phaenomenon depends upon age, health,
structure of parts, and a number of circumstan∣ces.
Of these we shall only enumerate a few,
and endeavour, at the same time, to investigate
the true causes of the various physical marks
which have been held forth as infallible charac∣teristics
of female virginity.</P>
<P>At the time of puberty, the parts of both
sexes undergo a considerable change: Those of
the male have then a growth so quick, that they
arrive, in a year or two, at full maturity. Those
of women increase likewise at this period. The
nymphae, in particular, which, though formerly
almost imperceptible, now become full and con∣spicuous.
<PB N="418" REF="431"/>
The menstrual discharge appears at
the same period. By an usual accumulation
of blood, all the parts swell, and approach to∣wards
each other. The orifice of the vagina
contracts, though the dimensions of the vagina
itself be enlarged. The appearances produced
by this contraction are different in different sub∣jects;
for we are informed by anatomists, that
there are sometimes four, and sometimes only
three, or two, <HI>carunculae</HI>; and that a circular or
semilunar ring, or rather a series of folds, is a
common phaenomenon. But anatomists have
neglected to tell us, that, whatever form this
contraction assumes, it never appears before the
age of puberty. In young girls, whom I have
had occasion to dissect, nothing of this kind
could be discerned; and, having collected many
facts concerning this subject, I can with confi∣dence
assert, that, when young women, before
puberty, have commerce with men, no effusion
of blood ever happens, unless the parts be great∣ly
disproportioned, or some violence is commit∣ted.
On the other hand, at the time of puberty,
especially when the females are regular, and in
good health, these effusions are common, and
produced by the slightest causes. But those
who are meagre, and subject to the fluor albus,
generally want this mark of virginity. The fre∣quent
repetition of this flux of blood, and even
at considerable intervals of time, is an evident
demonstration that it is only a deceitful appear∣ance.
<PB N="419" REF="432"/>
It is a certain fact, that young women,
who at first had a copious effusion, have repeat∣ed
this pretended symptom of virginity after a
few months abstinence. This phaenomenon
may, by proper management, be frequently ex∣hibited,
especially before the body has acquired
its full growth. It is equally certain, that young
women, who have not been faithful to the mar∣riage-bed,
have, notwithstanding, by the simple
expedient of abstinence, given fresh proofs of
innocence to their deluded husbands. Some
women, in the course of two or three years, have
exhibited this fictitious mark of purity five times.
But this symptom is limited to a certain time;
for it seldom appears after the age of eighteen
years. When the growth of the body is com∣pleated,
its parts become fixed and unalterable,
and cannot assume differences but by the em∣ployment
of such artifices as it would be both
unnecessary and improper to relate. Besides,
many women, particularly those who are irre∣gular
in their menses, and subject to the fluor
albus, never have any fresh marks of virginity.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, can be more chimerical
than the prejudices of men with regard to vir∣ginity,
and nothing can be more fallacious than
the pretended signs of it. A young woman may
have commerce with a man before the age of
puberty, and yet exhibit no marks of virginity.
But the same woman, after she arrives at puber∣ty,
may have very copious effusions of blood.
<PB N="420" REF="433"/>
Others, who are actual virgins, discover no such
appearances. Men, therefore, should be per∣fectly
easy as to this matter, and not indulge, as
is too often the case, unjust and ridiculous sus∣picions.</P>
<P>If we wish to obtain an evident and infallible
mark of virginity, we must search for it among
those barbarous people, who are incapable of
instilling, by education, the sentiments of virtue
and honour into their children, but secure the
chastity of their daughters by an expedient which
could only be suggested by the rudeness of their
manners. In Aethiopia, and other parts of Afri∣ca,
in Pegu, Arabia Petrea, and other nations of
Asia, the inhabitants, immediately after the birth
of females, sew up those parts which Nature has
separated, leaving only a space sufficient for the
natural evacuations. As the child grows, the
parts gradually adhere, and, when the time of
marriage arrives, they are again disunited by in∣cision.
Instead of thread, the fibres of the as∣bestos
are said to be employed, which is a sub∣stance
not liable to sudden corruption. Some
tribes content themselves with putting a ring
through the parts. To this operation wives as
well as girls are subjected, with this difference,
that the ring allotted to the latter cannot be re∣moved,
but in that allotted to the former, there
is a lock, of which the husband alone possesses
the key. But why should we mention barba∣rous
nations, when we have similar examples at
<PB N="421" REF="434"/>
no great distance? That absurd delicacy of a
neighbouring nation, with regard to the chastity
of their wives, is the offspring of a brutal and
criminal jealousy.</P>
<P>How opposite are the tastes, the dispositions,
the opinions, and the manners of different na∣tions?
After what has been related concerning
the high estimation of virginity among the bulk
of mankind, and the numberless precautions and
ignominious methods employed to secure it, is
it possible to believe that there are other people
who despise virginity, and consider the trouble
of removing it to be a mean and servile office?</P>
<P>Superstition has induced the inhabitants of
certain countries to resign the first fruits of vir∣ginity
to their idolatrous priests, and sometimes
to the idols themselves. This privilege is enjoy∣ed
by the priests of Cochin and of Calicut; and,
in Goa, the virgins are prostituted by their pa∣rents,
either voluntarily, or from choice, to an
idol of iron. Gross superstition makes these
people commit such abominable outrages, from
religious motives. But views more servile and
interested have induced men of other countries to
devote their daughters to their chiefs. The in∣habitants
of the Canary isles, and of the king∣dom
of Congo, prostitute, in this manner, their
daughters, without any injury to their reputa∣tion.
Nearly the same custom takes place in
Turkey, Persia, and several other countries both
of Asia and Africa. Their most eminent nobles
<PB N="422" REF="435"/>
think themselves highly honoured to receive
from their sovereign women with whom he him∣self
is already disgusted.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Arracan, and in the Philip∣pine
islands, a man would esteem it to be dis∣graceful
to marry a young woman who had not
been previously deflowered; and nothing but
the force of money can prevail on any person to
precede the husband. In the province of Thi∣bet,
mothers anxiously search for strangers, and
earnestly sollicit them to put their daughters in
a proper state for obtaining husbands. The
Laplanders likewise prefer girls who have had
commerce with strangers. They fancy them to
possess uncommon merit, because they have been
able to please men who are better judges of beau∣ty
and female accomplishments than themselves.
In Madagascar, and several other countries, the
most dissolute and debauched women are soonest
married. Many other examples might be given
of this strange taste, which nothing but the
grossest and most depraved manners could pro∣duce.</P>
<P>After puberty, marriage is the natural state
of man. A man ought to have but one wife,
and a woman but one husband. This is the
law of nature; for the number of females is
nearly equal to that of males. Such laws as
have been enacted in opposition to this natural
principle, have originated solely from tyranny
and ignorance. Reason, humanity, and justice
<PB N="423" REF="436"/>
revolt against those odious seraglios, in which
the liberty and the affections of many women
are sacrificed to the brutal passion of a single
man. Does this unnatural pre-eminence render
these tyrants of the human race more happy?
No! Surrounded with eunuchs, and with wo∣men,
useless to themselves and to other men,
they are tormented with the constant appear∣ance
of that accumulated load of misery they
have created.</P>
<P>Marriage, therefore, as it is established among
us, and other nations who are directed by the
lights of reason and revelation, is a state most
consonant to the nature of man, and in which
it is his duty to employ those new faculties he
acquires from puberty. By obstinately persist∣ing
in celebacy, these powers become trouble∣some,
and sometimes fatal. In either sex, too
long continency may give rise to diseases, or
create irritations so violent, that neither reason
nor religion will be able to counteract the im∣petuosity
of those passions they excite: And
thus man may be reduced to a level with the
brutes, which, under the influence of such sensa∣tions,
become perfectly furious and ungovern∣able.</P>
<P>In women, the furor uterinus is the most vi∣olent
effect of this irritation. This disease is a
species of madness, which deranges their ideas,
and deprives them of all sense of shame. Both
the nature and the seat of this melancholy dis∣temper
<PB N="424" REF="437"/>
are indicated by the most lascivious ex∣pressions,
and the most indelicate actions. I
have seen, with astonishment, a girl at the age
of twelve years, who had a brown, but lively
and florid complexion, and, though low in sta∣ture,
was strong and plump, commit the most
indecent actions upon the very appearance of a
man, from which she could not be deterred, ei∣ther
by the presence or chastisement of her mo∣ther.
She did not, however, lose her reason;
and the paroxysms of the disease ceased the mo∣ment
she was left with her own sex. Aristotle
alledges, that, at this age, the irritation is strong∣est,
and that girls ought then to be carefully
watched. The remark may be applicable to the
climate in which he lived; but, in colder coun∣tries,
the ardor of the female constitution does
not appear so early.</P>
<P>When the furor uterinus increases to a certain
degree, marriage will not remove it; and there
have been instances of its proving fatal. Hap∣pily
the force of nature is seldom the only cause
of a passion so detestible, even when there is a
predisposition to it in the habit of body. Before
it arrives at this extremity, the imagination must
be inflamed by licentious conversation, by ob∣scene
representations, or other causes. Among
women, the opposite temperament is infinitely
more common; for, with regard to this passion,
most of them are either cool or indifferent.
There are also many men to whom chastity is
<PB N="425" REF="438"/>
an easy virtue. I have known some men who,
at the age of twenty-five or thirty, enjoyed good
health, without having ever felt this passion so
strong as to render any gratification necessary.</P>
<P>Continency, however, is less to be dreaded
than excess. The number of immoderate men
is too great to require particular examples. By
excess, some have lost their memory; some have
been deprived of sight; some have become bald;
and many have perished by pure debility.
Young persons can never be sufficiently warned
of the irreparable injury to their health, which
the indulgence of the venereal appetite never
fails to produce. How many cease to be men,
or, at least, cease to enjoy the powers of manhood,
before the age of thirty? and how many, at
fifteen or eighteen, receive the seeds of a disease,
disgraceful in itself, and which it is often impos∣sible
to eradicate?</P>
<P>It has already been remarked, that, at the age
of puberty, the growth usually stops. It fre∣quently
happens, however, that, even after pu∣berty,
a tedious illness makes the body increase
in length more than it would have done in a
state of perfect health. This extraordinary in∣crease
is probably occasioned by the inactivity of
the external organs of generation during the
course of the disease. The organic particles do
not reach these parts, because they are not de∣termined
thither by irritation; and this defect
of irritation is owing to a lassitude and imbecil∣lity
<PB N="426" REF="439"/>
of the parts, which prevent the secretion of
the seminal fluid. These organic particles,
therefore, remain in the mass of blood, and ne∣cessarily
extend the extremities of the bones,
nearly in the same manner as happens to eu∣nuchs.
Thus young people, after recovering
from a long sickness, are often taller, but worse
shaped, than formerly. Some, for instance, be∣come
hunch-backed, and others crook-legged;
because the still ductile extremities of the bones
have been unnecessarily extended by a superflui∣ty
of organic particles, which, in a state of
health, would have been exhausted in the for∣mation
of seminal fluid.</P>
<P>The production of children is the chief inten∣tion
of marriage. But this intention is some∣times
frustrated. Of the different causes of ste∣rility,
some are common to both sexes. But, as
these causes are more apparent in men than in
women, they are, therefore, more commonly
ascribed to the former. In both sexes, sterility
is occasioned either by a defect in the original
conformation, or by accidental injuries done to
the organs themselves. In men, the most per∣nicious
defects of conformation are those which
affect the testicles, or the muscles called <HI>erectores
penis.</HI> A wrong direction of the urethra, which
is sometimes not only oblique, but improperly
perforated, is another obstacle to generation.
The adhesion of the prepuce to the fraenum is
another obstacle; but it is not insurmountable.
<PB N="427" REF="440"/>
In women, the conformation of the uterus may
likewise occasion sterility. If the orifice of the
uterus be always open, or always shut, concep∣tion
will be equally prevented. But the most
frequent cause of barrenness, both in men and
women, arises from some depravity in their se∣minal
fluids. I formerly quoted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remark of
Valisnieri, that a corruption of the fluid in the
testicles of women rendered them entirely bar∣ren.
It is the same with men. If the secretion
by which semen is formed be vitiated, the fluid
is unfit for impregnation. These causes of ste∣rility
are not discoverable by any external ap∣pearances.</P>
<P>In cases of sterility, different means have been
employed to discover whether the defect pro∣ceeded
from the man or the woman. Inspection
is the first resource; and, if the barrenness be
occasioned by a fault in the external conforma∣tion,
it is sufficient. But, if the defect lie in the
internal organs, it is hardly possible either to dis∣cover
or remove it. Some men, though they
appear to be perfectly formed, want the genuine
sign of a proper conformation. Others have
this sign so imperfectly, or so seldom, that it is
only a very equivocal mark of virility.</P>
<P>Every body knows that the action of this part
is not under the command of the mind. It is
the most animal part of the human body; for
it acts by a kind of instinct, the causes of which
are unknown. How many young persons, e∣ducated
<PB N="428" REF="441"/>
in perfect purity, and totally ignorant
of pleasure, have felt the most lively impres∣sions,
without being able to recognise either their
cause, or their object? How many, on the con∣trary,
remain cold and languid, notwithstand∣ing
all the efforts of sense and imagination?</P>
<P>This part of our bodies, therefore, belongs
less to us than any other of our members. It
acts or is languid without our participation.
Its functions commence or terminate at certain
periods. All this happens without our com∣mand,
and often contrary to our inclination.</P>
<P>Where, then, is the foundation for those laws,
which are so unjust in their principle, and so
disgraceful in their execution? The rules and
decrees of the Congrés<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of an infamous court in France, where trials for impotency, with a view to dissolve marriages, were held. Proofs by inspection were taken before the judge, who was assisted by surgeons and midwives. This court was abolished by an arret of the parliament of Paris, dated 18th February 1677. It is surprising that the Count de Buffon, who expresses the utmost detestation against this court, should have mentioned nothing of its dissolution.</NOTE> are an affront to hu∣man
reason. Its members should have known,
that the very means they employed to investi∣gate
truth, were not only indelicate, but infal∣libly
prevented its discovery.</P>
<P>When there is no defect in the external con∣formation,
barrenness proceeds oftener from
the woman than the man; for, independent of
the pernicious effects of the fluor albus, there
<PB N="429" REF="442"/>
seems to be another cause which has never ex∣cited
attention.</P>
<P>From my experiments, related in the sixth
chapter, it appears that the testicles of females
give birth to a kind of natural protuberances,
which I have called <HI>glandular bodies.</HI> They
grow in a gradual manner, and serve for secre∣ting
and maturating the seminal fluid. They
are in a continual fluctuating state. They be∣gin
to grow under the membrane of the testicle,
which they soon perforate; they then swell,
and their extremities spontaneously open, and
distill a seminal fluid for some time; after which
they gradually decay, leaving only a small red∣dish
cicatrice on the place from whence they
sprung. These glandular bodies no sooner dis∣appear
than they are replaced by others; so that
the testicles are continually labouring, and un∣dergoing
considerable changes. Hence any de∣rangement
in these organs, either by an unusual
thickness of the fluid, or weakness of the vessels,
prevents the proper exercise of their functions,
renders them unable to secrete, or rather vitiates
and corrupts the seminal fluid, which necessarily
gives rise to sterility.</P>
<P>Conception sometimes precedes puberty. Many
women have become mothers before the appear∣ance
of the menses; and some, who never had
any symptoms of this evacuation, are in the
habit of bearing children. Instances of this
kind happen in our climate, without travelling
<PB N="430" REF="443"/>
for them to Brazil, where whole nations are
said to be perpetuated, though not a single wo∣man
be subject to the menstrual discharge; an
evident proof that it is not the menstrual blood,
but the seminal fluid of the male and female,
which are essentially necessary to generation. It
is likewise known, that the cessation of the
menses, which generally happens about the age
of forty or fifty years, does not disqualify every
woman for conception; for some women have
become pregnant at sixty or seventy, and even
at an age still more advanced. These examples,
though pretty frequent, may be regarded as ex∣ceptions
to the general rule; but they are suffi∣cient
to demonstrate that the menstrual blood is
by no means essential to generation.</P>
<P>In the ordinary course of Nature, women
conceive not before the menses appear, nor af∣ter
they have ceased. The age at which men
first acquire the faculty of generating is not so
distinctly marked. His body must attain a cer∣tain
growth before semen is secreted; and, be∣fore
this fluid be fully maturated, the degree
of growth must be still greater. This generally
happens between the twelfth and eighteenth
years. But the period when man loses the ge∣nerative
faculty, Nature seems to have left un∣determined.
At sixty or seventy, when old age
begins to enervate the body, the semen is less
abundant, and often unprolific. In the collec∣tions
of public societies, however, there are
<PB N="431" REF="444"/>
many instances of men who have continued to
procreate at the age of eighty and ninety.</P>
<P>There are likewise examples of boys who
have propagated at eight, nine, and ten years,
and of girls who have conceived at seven, eight,
and nine years. But such facts are exceedingly
rare, and ought to be regarded as singular phae∣nomena.
The sign of virility appears in in∣fancy:
But that is not sufficient; the produc∣tion
of semen must be added; and this happens
not till the growth of the body be nearly com∣pleated.
At first the quantity is small, and ge∣nerally
sterile.</P>
<P>Two marks of conception have been men∣tioned
by authors. The first is a kind of tre∣mor,
or shivering, which is said to begin at the
moment of conception, and continues for some
days. The second is derived from the orifice
of the uterus, which, it is asserted, closes entirely
after conception. But these signs appear to be
very equivocal, if not altogether imaginary.</P>
<P>This tremor is mentioned by Hippocrates in
the following terms: 'Liquido constat harum
rerum peritis, quod mulier, ubi concepit, sta∣tim
inhorrescit ac dentibus stridet, et auricu∣lum
reliquumque corpus convulsio prehendit.'
Galen, on the authority of some women, im∣putes
this symptom to a contraction of the ute∣rus.
Others express it by a vague sensation of
cold over the whole body, and employ the words
<HI>horror</HI> and <HI>horripilatio.</HI> These, and other au∣thors,
<PB N="432" REF="445"/>
endeavour, like Galen, to establish the
fact upon the testimony of women. Hippocra∣tes
says, 'quae in utero gerunt, harum os uteri
clausum est;' or, according to another transla∣tor,
'quaecunque sunt gravidae, illis os uteri
connivet.' Opinions, however, are various as
to the changes which the uterus undergoes after
conception. Some maintain, that the edges of
the <HI>os tincae</HI> are drawn so close together, that no
vacuity is left between them; and others affirm,
that these edges are not exactly close till after
the two first months of pregnancy. They agree,
however, that, immediately after conception, the
orifice is shut up by a glutinous humour; that
the os tincae, which, previous to conception,
might admit a substance of the size of a pea,
has no perceptible aperture; and that this dif∣ference
is so evident, as to be distinguishable by
a skilful midwife. If these assertions were
founded in truth, the state of pregnancy might
be known a few days after conception.</P>
<P>It is urged, on the other hand, that if, after
conception, the orifice of the uterus were closed,
superfoctation would be impossible. To this it
may be replied, that the seminal liquor may per∣haps
penetrate through the membranes of the
uterus; that the uterus itself may open to
receive the materials necessary for superfoeta∣tion;
and that, at any rate, superfoetations so
seldom happen, that they make a very trifling
exception to the general rule. Other authors
<PB N="433" REF="446"/>
maintain, that this change in the uterus can ne∣ver
appear but in women who have formerly
conceived and brought forth children. In first
conceptions, indeed, the difference must be less
perceptible; but, though ever so conspicuous,
we have not sufficient evidence to conclude, that
it is a certain, a uniform, and a positive sign. The
study of anatomy, aided by experience, affords,
on this subject, general notions only, which va∣nish
upon a closer examination. The same ob∣servation
may be applied to the shivering, or
convulsive cold, which some women are said to
feel at the time of conception. As most women
experience not this sensation; as others, on the
contrary, assure us, that they have felt a burn∣ing
heat; and as others still confess that they are
utter strangers to all such feelings; the natural
conclusion is, that all these marks are highly e∣quivocal,
and that, when they do happen, they
ought to be considered, not as the effects of con∣ception,
but of other causes.</P>
<P>On this subject I shall add one fact from Mr
Parsons's lectures on muscular motion, p. 79.
which proves, that the orifice of the uterus does
not close immediately after conception, or, if
it does close, that the semen may find a passage
into the uterus, by penetrating through its sub∣stance.
In the year 1714, a woman of Charles∣stown
in South Carolina, was delivered of two
children, the one immediately after the other.
<PB N="434" REF="447"/>
To the astonishment of the assistants, the one
child was black and the other white. This e∣vident
testimony of the woman's infidelity to her
husband, obliged her to acknowledge, that, one
morning, her husband having just left her bed, a
negro entered her chamber, and, by threats of im∣mediate
death, compelled her to gratify his desires.
This fact shows, that the conception of two or
more children does not always happen at one
time, and supports my opinion, that the semen
penetrates through the texture of the uterus.</P>
<P>There are many other equivocal signs of preg∣nancy,
by which it is said to be early distin∣guishable;
as a slight pain in the region of the
uterus and loins; a numbness over the whole
body; a continual drowsiness; a melancholy
and capricious disposition; the toothache, head∣ache;
and a vertigo, which obscures the sight;
yellowish, blood-shot eyes, with contracted pu∣pils
and depressed eye-lids; a pale and spotted
countenance; a depraved appetite, accompanied
with vomiting and spitting; hysteric symptoms;
the fluor albus; the stoppage of the menstrual
discharge, or, instead of it, an haemorrhage; the
secretion of milk in the breasts, &amp;c. Many o∣ther
marks supposed to be peculiar to pregnan∣cy,
might be added; but they are frequently
nothing more than the effects of particular
diseases. But we shall leave the discussion of
these to physicians; details of this kind, to be
<PB N="435" REF="448"/>
useful, would require a long series of profound
investigation. This subject, like many others in
physiology, the animal oeconomy, and different
branches of the medical art, has seldom been
treated with any degree of philosophical ac∣curacy.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Manhood.</HEAD>
<P>AT the age of puberty, or a few years after
it, the human body attains its full sta∣ture.
The growth of some persons stops at the
fourteenth or fifteenth year; and, in others, it
continues till they arrive at twenty-two or
twenty-three years. During this period, most
men are of a slender make: Their thighs and
legs are small, and the muscular parts are not
properly filled up. But, by degrees, the mus∣cles
swell, the limbs and different parts of the
body assume their proper figure and proportions,
and, before the age of thirty, the body, in men,
acquires its most perfect symmetry.</P>
<P>But, in women, the body sooner attains this
symmetry. As their size is smaller, and their
muscles, and other parts, less strong, compact,
and solid, than those of men, they arrive more
early at a state of maturity. A woman at twenty
years is as perfectly formed as a man at thirty.</P>
<P>The body of a well-shaped man ought to be
square, the muscles boldly marked, and the fea∣tures
of the face distinctly defined. In women,
the parts are rounder and softer, and their features
<PB N="437" REF="450"/>
are more delicate. Man is adorned with strength
and majesty; grace and softness are the peculiar
embellishments of woman.</P>
<P>Even the external figure of the human species
declares them to be the sovereigns of the earth.
The body of man is erect; his attitude is that
of command; and his countenance, which is
turned towards the heavens, is impressed with
the signatures of superior dignity. The image
of his soul is painted in his face; the excellence
of his nature penetrates through his material
form, and animates his features with a divine
illumination. His majestic deportment, and the
firmness of his movements, announce the supe∣riority
of his rank. He touches the earth but
with his extremity: He views it only at a di∣stance,
and seems to despise it. His arms are
not pillars to support his body: His hands tread
not the earth, and lose not, by friction and pres∣sure,
that delicacy of feeling for which they
were originally destined. His arms and hands
are formed for purposes more noble, namely,
for executing the commands of his intellect, for
laying hold of distant objects, for removing ob∣stacles,
for defending him from injuries, and for
seizing and retaining objects of pleasure.</P>
<P>When the mind is at ease, all the features of
the countenance are in a state of profound tran∣quility.
Their proportion, their harmony, their
union, point out serenity of sentiment, and ac∣cord
with the calm that subsists within. When
<PB N="438" REF="451"/>
the soul, however, is agitated, the human visage
becomes a living canvas, upon which passions are
represented with equal energy and delicacy;
where every emotion is expressed by a corre∣spondent
feature; where every impression anti∣cipates
the will, and reveals, by obvious and pa∣thetic
characters, those intentions and feelings
which we are sollicitous to conceal.</P>
<P>It is in the eyes that the passions are most
strongly marked, and most readily discovered.
The eye belongs to the soul more than any o∣ther
bodily organ. It participates of every
mental emotion, the softest and most tender,
as well as the most violent and tumultuous.
It exhibits these emotions in all their force and
purity, and infuses into the soul of the spectator
the fire and the agitation of that mind in which
they originate. In fine, the eye reflects the
light of thought, and the glow of sentiment;
it is the sense of the understanding, and the lan∣guage
of intelligence.</P>
<P>Men who squint, or are short-sighted, have
less of this external soul, (as it may be termed),
whose chief residence is in the eye. These de∣fects
hurt the physiognomy, and give to the finest
countenance a disagreeable, and often a stupid
air. As nothing but strong and violent passions
are discoverable in visages of this kind, and as
they exhibit no marks of delicacy or vivacity of
sentiment, we are apt to form unfavourable
impressions of such persons, which, however
<PB N="439" REF="452"/>
ill-founded, it is difficult for us to efface. We
are so accustomed to be influenced by external
appearances, that, if no symptoms of thought
and reflection appear in a man's countenance,
we instantly decide him to be void of abili∣ty.
We even draw conclusions from the cut
of the cloaths, or a curl of the periwig; nei∣ther
are these conclusions always false. Men
ought, therefore, to pay some attention to these
minute articles; because, in the eye of strangers,
they make a part of ourselves, and contribute
not a little to the judgments they form of our
understanding and breeding.</P>
<P>A vivacious or a languid motion of the eye
has a prodigious effect on the character of the
countenance. Eyes are of different colours, dark
hazel, light hazel, green, blue, gray, and whi∣tish
gray. The iris has a smooth velvet-like
appearance, and consists of many small filaments,
regularly disposed, and directed towards the
centre of the pupil. The most usual colours of
the eye are the hazel and the blue; and both
these colours are sometimes to be found in the
same eye. The eyes commonly called black,
when narrowly inspected, are only of a dark
hazel colour. They appear black in conse∣quence
of their being contrasted with the white
of the eye. Those of a less deep hazel are like∣wise
reckoned black, but are not equally beauti∣ful.
Shades of orange, hazel, gray, and blue
are frequently to be met with in the same eye;
<PB N="440" REF="453"/>
but, wherever there is a blue tint, it becomes the
prevailing colour, and outshines all the rest.
The black and the blue are the most beautiful
colours, and give most fire and vivacity of ex∣pression
to the eye. In black eyes, there is
more force and impetuosity; but the blue ex∣cel
in sweetness and delicacy. The former
dart forth a perpetual and uniform flame, be∣cause
their colour appears always the same, and
reflects the same rays: But the modifications of
light are distinguishable in the blue; because
different rays are reflected by the various tints
of which they are composed.</P>
<P>These, and other varieties in the colours of the
eyes, are peculiar to man, the horse, &amp;c. In
most other animals, the colours of individuals
vary not. The eyes of the ox are brown; those
of the sheep are of a watry colour; those of the
goat are gray, &amp;c. Aristotle alledges, that, among
men, gray eyes are the strongest; that the blue
are weaker; that prominent eyes are short-sight∣ed;
and that brown eyes see not so well as o∣thers,
in a faint light.</P>
<P>Though the eye, in moving, seems to be
drawn towards either side, yet it only moves
round its own centre, which gives the pupil
the appearance of approaching or receding from
the angles of the orbit, and of being elevated or
depressed. In man the eyes are nearer each o∣ther
than in any other animal. In some species,
the eyes are so remotely situated, that it is im∣possible
<PB N="441" REF="454"/>
for both eyes to see the same object at
the same time.</P>
<P>Next to the eyes, the parts which give most
character to the countenance are the eye-brows.
Being totally different from every other feature,
their effect is augmented by the contrast: They
form a deep shade in the canvas, and give relief
to the other colours and features. The lashes of
the eye-lid have also their effect; when long
and bushy, they bestow beauty on the eye, and
give a mild and pleasant aspect to the face.
Lashes on both eye-lids are peculiar to man and
the ape. Other animals have hair on the upper
lid only; and, even in man, the lash of the under
lid is less than that of the upper. The eye∣brows
have only two movements; one by which
they are elevated; and the other by which they
are depressed and contracted.</P>
<P>The eye-lids guard the ball of the eye from
dust, insects, &amp;c. and keep the cornea moist.
The upper eye-lid moves up and down; but
the under lid has little or no motion. Although
the motion of the eye-lids be subject to the will,
yet, by sleep, fatigue, or surprise, we lose the
command of them. They are sometimes also
affected with convulsive motions, which we are
unable to restrain. In birds, and amphibious
quadrupeds, the under eye-lid alone moves;
and fishes and insects have no eye-lids either a∣bove
or below.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="455"/>
The fore-head occupies a large part of the
sace, and contributes greatly to its beauty. It
should be well proportioned, neither too flat nor
too prominent; neither too narrow, nor too
short; and it should be regularly adorned with
hair both above and on each side. The hair
gives great expression to the countenance; bald∣ness
is therefore a capital defect; and the prac∣tice
of employing artificial hair, which is now so
general, ought to be confined to such as are na∣turally
bald; for borrowed locks often change
the true character of the face. If every man
wore his own hair, and allowed it to float free∣ly,
it would be more easy to distinguish cha∣racters
by the general aspect of the countenance.
The crown of the head, and immediately a∣bove
the temples, are the parts which first be∣come
bald; but the hair below the temples, and
on the under part of the back of the head, seldom
falls off. Baldness is peculiar to man: Women,
in the most advanced age, though their hair be∣comes
white, are seldom affected with it: Chil∣dren
and eunuchs are not more subject to bald∣ness
than women; and the hair is stronger and
more abundant in youth than at any other pe∣riod.
The longest hair becomes dry, and gra∣dually
wastes and falls off as we advance in life.
The whiteness commences at the points; and
when the hair is totally white, it loses its
strength, and at last falls off altogether. There
have been examples of young people whose hair
<PB N="443" REF="456"/>
was rendered white by disease, and which reco∣vered
its natural colour after their health was
restored. It is alledged by Aristotle, that no
man becomes bald before having intercourse
with women, excepting such as have been bald
from their birth. The antient writers upbraid
the inhabitants of the islands of the Archipelago
with the epithet <HI>bald-heads</HI>; and assert, that these
islanders are all brought into the world with this
defect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dapper's, Voyage, p. 354. and Plin. edit. Hardouin, p. 541.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The nose is the most prominent feature in the
face. But, as it has very little motion, even in
the most violent passions, it contributes more to
the beauty than to the expression of the coun∣tenance;
and, unless it be deformed, or greatly
disproportioned, it is less attended to than those
features which are capable of motion, as the
mouth and the eyes. The form of the nose, and
its remarkable prominency, are peculiar to the
human species. Most animals have nostrils se∣parated
by a partition; but none of them have
an elevated and advanced nose. Even the apes
may be said to have only nostrils; the nose of
an ape has the same position as that of a man;
but it is so short and flat, that it can hardly be
regarded as similar. By this organ, men, and
most animals, breathe, and smell odoriferous bo∣dies.
Birds have no cartilaginous nostrils; they
have only two holes or pipes for the purposes of
respiration and smelling.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="457"/>
Next to the eyes, the mouth and lips have
both the greatest motion and expression. These
motions are excited by the passions, and the vari∣ous
forms of the mouth mark their different cha∣racters
and modifications. The organs of speech
give the mouth an animation superior to every o∣ther
part of the face. The vermilion of the lips,
and the whiteness of the teeth, so much excel
the other colours of the face, that they attract
our chief regard. We fix our eyes on the mouth
of the speaker; every word, every articulation,
produces different motions in the lips; and, how∣ever
rapid, it is easy to distinguish them from
each other. The deaf learn to distinguish these
motions so accurately, that they often know the
sentiments of the speaker merely by attending
to the motions of his lips.</P>
<P>In man, and in all other animals, the under∣jaw
alone is endowed with the power of motion.
The crocodile, the opinion of Aristotle and many
other naturalists notwithstanding, is not an ex∣ception:
I have examined many skeletons of
that animal, and have found, by the nature of
the articulation, that the under-jaw alone was
moveable. In the human foetus, and in
monkeys, the under-jaw is greatly advanced be∣fore
the upper. The deformity, in adults, is
equal, whether the under-jaw be too prominent,
or too much depressed: It ought to be nearly
on a level with the upper. Strong passions, as
well as languor, often produce an involuntary
<PB N="445" REF="458"/>
motion in the under-jaw: Pain and pleasure, as
well as languor, give rise to yawning; but, in
the former, the motion is more brisk and lively.</P>
<P>When the mind is suddenly affected with ar∣dent
desire, or keen regret, we feel a sort of
starting, or internal oppression; this motion of
the diaphragm elevates the lungs, and produces
that sudden inspiration which forms a sigh:
And, when the mind considers the cause of its
emotion, and perceives no method of accom∣plishing
its desire, or of banishing its regret, the
sighs are repeated, and sorrow, or mental pain,
succeeds. If this pain of mind be great and un∣expected,
it produces tears; the air rushes quick∣ly
into the lungs, and gives rise to many inspi∣rations,
which are accompanied with involuntary
shocks: Each inspiration makes a noise strong∣er
than that of sighing, and is distinguished
by the name of sobbing; these sobs succeed each
other more rapidly than sighs; and, in the for∣mer,
the sound of the voice is more apparent.
The accent of the voice is still more distinguish∣able
in groaning, which is a species of sob
long continued: and its slow sound is heard both
in expiration and inspiration: Its expression con∣sists
in the continuation of a plaintiff tone form∣ed
by inarticulate sounds. Groans are shorter
or longer according to the degree of sorrow or
dejection; but they are generally repeated se∣veral
times. The time of inspiration forms the
interval that takes place between each groan;
<PB N="446" REF="459"/>
and the intervals are nearly equal both in their
duration and their distance. The plaintiff shriek
is a groan expressed with force, and with a high
tone of voice. The shriek, when very sharp,
generally continues on the same tone through
its whole extent; but, when moderate, it gene∣rally
ends in a lower tone.</P>
<P>Laughter is an interrupted sound, often re∣peated,
and accompanied with a kind of con∣vulsive
motion of the belly, which is alternately
elevated and depressed. To facilitate this mo∣tion,
the breast and head are sometimes thrown
forward; the chest remains immoveable; the
angles of the mouth recede from each other;
and the cheeks swell: Every time that the belly
is depressed, the air bursts from the mouth, and
occasions a noise, which, during the fit, is often
repeated, sometimes on the same tone, and some∣times
the tones gradually diminish.</P>
<P>The lips, in immoderate laughter, and in most
violent passions, open wide; but, in the more
tranquil emotions, the angles of the mouth re∣cede,
without any opening of the lips, the
cheeks swell, and, in some persons, dimples are
formed in them near the corners of the mouth:
This charm belongs to the graces, and is com∣monly
attended with an agreeable smile, which
is a mark of benevolence, and of internal satis∣faction:
A smile is also a mode of expressing
contempt and ridicule; but, in these malignant
smiles, we press the lips close to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="460"/>
The cheeks are uniform features, and have
little motion or expression, excepting from that
involuntary redness or paleness with which they
are covered in different passions; they unite
the features, and give a contour to the face; they
contribute more to beauty than to expression;
and the same observation may be applied to the
chin, the ears, and the temples.</P>
<P>Shame, anger, pride, joy, equally give rise to
blushing; while fear, terror, and sorrow, pro∣duce
a paleness in the face. This change of
colour is involuntary; it exhibits the state of
the mind without its consent. It is an effect of
sentiment over which the will has no command.
We can easily disguise the other marks of pas∣sion;
for a moment's reflection enables us to
stop the action of the muscles of the face which
characterise particular passions, and even to
change their direction; but to stop or alter the
redness or paleness of the countenance, is be∣yond
our power; because these depend on a
peculiar motion of the blood, occasioned by the
action of the diaphragm, which is the chief in∣ternal
organ of sensation.</P>
<P>In different passions, the whole head is affected
with different motions and positions: It hangs
forward during shame, humility, and sorrow;
it inclines to one side in languor and compas∣sion;
it is elevated in pride, erect and fixed in
obstinacy and self-conceit; it is thrown back∣ward
in astonishment or surprise; and rolls from
<PB N="448" REF="461"/>
side to side in contempt, ridicule, and indigna∣tion.</P>
<P>Grief, joy, love, shame, and compassion,
make the eyes swell, and cause the tears to
flow. The effusion of tears is always accompa∣nied
with a contraction of the muscles of the
face, which opens the mouth; the tears flow
through the lachrymal ducts into the nose, and
increase the fluid with which it is naturally
moistened: The flowing of the tears is not con∣stant;
they seem to burst out at irregular inter∣vals.</P>
<P>In grief, the corners of the mouth are de∣pressed,
the under-lip rises, the eye-lids fall
down, the pupil is elevated, and half concealed
under the eye-lid: The other muscles of the
face are relaxed, which enlarges the space be∣tween
the mouth and the eyes; and, of course,
the countenance appears to be stretched out
beyond its ordinary length. (See plate VIII.
fig. 1.).</P>
<P>In consternation and terror, the brow is wrink∣led,
the eye-brows are elevated, the upper eye∣lid
opens so wide that it rises above the pupil,
and uncovers a part of the white above the pu∣pil,
which last falls down, and is partly concealed
by the under-lid. The mouth, at the same
time, opens wide, the lips recede from each
other, and expose the teeth both above and be∣low.
(See plate VIII. fig. 2.).</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="462"/>
In contempt and derision, one corner of the
upper-lip rises, and leaves the teeth bare; the
other corner moves a little, and has the appear∣ance
of a malignant smile; the nostril next the
elevated side of the lip shrivels up, and the angle
of the mouth falls down. The eye, on the same
side, is almost shut, while the other remains o∣pen;
and both pupils are depressed in the same
manner as when a person looks down from a
height. (See plate VIII. fig. 3.)</P>
<P>In jealousy, envy, and malice, the eye-brows
fall down and are wrinkled; the eye-lids rise,
and the pupils fall down; the upper lip is ele∣vated
on both sides; the angles of the mouth
sink a little, and the middle of the under-lip
rises and joins the middle of the upper one.
(See plate VIII. fig. 4.)</P>
<P>In laughing, the angles of the mouth are
drawn back, and somewhat elevated; the upper
part of the cheeks rise; the eyes are more or
less shut; the upper lip rises and the under one
sinks; the mouth opens; and, when the laugh∣ter
is immoderate, the skin of the nose wrinkles.
(See plate VIII. fig. 5.)</P>
<P>Beside these marks, the arms, the hands, and
the whole body contribute to the expression of
the passions. Gesture also concurs with the ac∣tion
of the features in expressing the different
emotions of the soul. In joy, for example, the
eyes, the head, the arms, and whole body, are
agitated with quick and various movements. In
<PB N="450" REF="463"/>
languor and grief, the eyes are sunk, the head
reclines, the arms hang down, and the whole
body remains fixed and immoveable. In admi∣ration,
surprise, and astonishment, every motion
is suspended, and the person remains in the same
uniform attitude. These expressions of the pas∣sions
are involuntary: But there is another spe∣cies
of expression, which consists in an agitation
of the eyes, head, arms, and body; and these
motions seem, at the same time, to be the effect
of reflection, and to depend on the will. They
appear to be efforts of the mind to defend the
body, and may be regarded as secondary symp∣toms,
by which particular passions may be di∣stinguished.
In love, hope, and keen desire, we
elevate the head, and turn towards heaven, as if
imploring possession; we stretch forward the
head to make a nearer approach; and we ex∣tend
the arms and open the hands, in order to
seize and embrace the beloved object. On the
other hand, in fear, hatred, and horror, we push
the arms forward with precipitation, to repel the
object of our aversion; we turn back the head
and the eyes; we recoil, and at last fly, in or∣der
to avoid it. These motions are so sudden,
that they appear to be involuntary: But this de∣ception
is the effect of habit; for these motions
are produced by reflection, and, by their alacri∣ty,
discover the perfection of those qualities of
the body which enable it to obey, with such a∣mazing
promptitude, the commands of the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="464"/>
As the passions are agitations or movements
of the mind, for the most part connected with
impressions of sensation, they may be expressed
by motions of the body, and particularly by those
of the countenance. We can, therefore, form a
judgment of the affections of the mind by the
motions of the body, and can discover the real
situation of the soul by examining the changes
in the features of the face. But, as the mind
has no figure which can have any relation to
that of matter, we can form no judgment of the
general disposition of any mind by the features
of the countenance, or by the figure of the body
with which it is connected. A deformed body
may contain an amiable mind; neither should
we pronounce concerning the natural disposition
of any person, merely because the features of
his countenance are not agreeable; for there is
no analogy between features and the nature of
the soul, upon which any reasonable conjectures
can be founded.</P>
<P>The antients, however, were much addicted
to this false notion; and there have not been
wanting, in every age, men who wished to sup∣port
a scientific divination derived from a pre∣tended
skill in physiognomy. But nothing is
more evident, than that this species of divina∣tion
can be extended no farther than to the af∣fections
of the mind, when expressed by the mo∣tion
of the eyes, visage, and other parts of the
body: The form of the nose, of the mouth,
<PB N="452" REF="465"/>
and of other features, has no more connection
with the natural disposition of any person, than
the stature, or size of the limbs, with the faculty
of thinking. Has a man more genius in pro∣portion
as his nose is well made? Is the ability
of another more circumscribed, because his eyes
are small and his mouth large? If must, there∣fore,
be acknowledged, that the divination of
physiognomists is altogether chimerical, and de∣stitute
of any foundation in nature.</P>
<P>The ears, of all the parts of the head, contri∣bute
least to the expression of the face. They
are placed at a side, and commonly concealed
under the hair. But, in quadrupeds, the ears
are more apparent; and by them we can disco∣ver
whether the creatures be in a state of vigour
or of imbecillity; their motions denote sentiment,
and correspond to the internal feelings of the
animal. The human ears, though furnished
with muscles, have hardly any motion, either
voluntary or involuntary. Small ears are said
to be most beautiful; but large ones are better
calculated for hearing. Some nations greatly en∣large
the lobes of their ears, by piercing them, and
placing in them pieces of wood or metal, which
they change successively for others of greater
dimensions, till the holes become enormous;
and the lobes uniformly increase in proportion
to the size of the holes. I have seen these round
pieces of wood, which had been brought from
India or South America, of more than an inch
<PB N="453" REF="466"/>
and a half in diameter. It is difficult to investi∣gate
the origin of this singular custom; but it
is equally difficult to trace the origin of piercing
the ears, (a practice almost general), and some∣times
the nostrils, in order to adorn them with
rings, &amp;c. unless we attribute it to those naked
savages, who contrived to carry, in the least in∣commodious
manner, such things as appeared to
them to be most precious.</P>
<P>But the whimsical varieties in the customs of
different nations are still more apparent in the
manner of dressing and wearing their beards.
The Turks shave their heads; but allow their
beards to grow. Most Europeans, on the con∣trary,
shave their beards, and wear their own or
borrowed hair. The savages of America pull
the hairs off their beards, but carefully preserve
those of the head. The Negroes shave their heads
in different figures; sometimes they cut their hair
in the shape of little stars, sometimes in the
manner of a friar, but most commonly in alter∣nate
stripes. The Talapoins of Siam shave the
heads and eye-brows of those children whose
education is entrusted to them. In this article
every nation has different usages. Some prefer
the hair on the upper lip to that of the chin;
others esteem hair on the cheek; some curl it,
and others wear it straight. It is not long since
we woere our hair behind loose and floating; we
now inclose it in a bag. Our dress is different
from that of our fathers. The differences in
<PB N="454" REF="467"/>
dress is as various as the different nations of the
globe: And, what is singular, we have adopted
that dress which is most incommodious, wastes
most time in adjusting, and is least agreeable to
nature.</P>
<P>Though fashions seem to be founded on ca∣price
and fancy; yet, when generally adopted,
they merit examination. Men have always gi∣ven
a value to those things which excite atten∣tion,
and which convey flattering ideas of riches,
power, and grandeur. The value of diamonds,
and other precious stones, arises from their
scarceness and brilliancy. The same observa∣tion
applies to those shining metals, the weight
of which we regard so little, that, for the sake
of sinery, we spread them over our garments.
Ornaments of this kind are intended to excite
the attention of spectators, to give them an idea
of splendor and wealth, and to dazzle their
fancies: How few have the capacity of distin∣guishing
the person from the dress, or of esti∣mating
the man in any other manner than by
the metal on his cloaths?</P>
<P>Every thing that is rare and brilliant will,
therefore, always be fashionable, while men de∣rive
more eminence from riches than virtue,
and while the means of acquiring respect con∣tinue
so widely different from real merit. Stran∣gers
receive their first impression of us from our
dress, which is varied according to the points of
view in which we wish to be considered. The
<PB N="455" REF="468"/>
modest man, or he who wishes to assume that
character, dresses with a simplicity correspond∣ing
to the nature of that virtue. The vain-glo∣rious,
on the contrary, neglect nothing that can
support their pride or flatter their vanity; and
they distinguish themselves by splendor or fine∣ness
in their external appearance.</P>
<P>Another very general object of dress, is to in∣crease
the size of our figure, and to occupy more
room in the world than nature has allotted to us.
We wish to enlarge our dimensions by high∣heeled
shoes and blown up garments; but, how∣ever
bulky our dress, it is exceeded by that va∣nity
which it endeavours to cover. Why is the
doctor's head loaded with an enormous quantity
of borrowed hair, while that of the beau is so
thinly covered? The former wishes to have
the extent of his learning measured by the ap∣parent
dimensions of his head; and the latter
desires to diminish his head, that he may exhi∣bit
the gaiety and sprightliness of his genius.</P>
<P>Other fashions appear to have a more rational
object, namely, to conceal the defects of nature,
or to render them less disagreeable. Taking
mankind in general, there is a greater number
of deformed bodies, and disagreeable faces, than
of handsome figures, and beautiful countenan∣ces.
Fashions are always regulated by the prac∣tice
of the majority; and, as the greatest
part of mankind have defects to conceal, it is
their interest to invent and support those modes
<PB N="456" REF="469"/>
which tend to render their deformities less con∣spicuous.
Women never think of paint, till the
natural bloom of their cheeks is faded. Paint∣ing,
however, is a very general custom. The
mode of whitening the hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The savages of New Guinea powder their heads and beards with chalk. See Recueil des Voyages, &amp;c. tom. 4. p. 637.</NOTE> with powder, and
curling it, is not so universal; but it seems to
have been intended for the same purpose, to
make the colours and features of the counte∣nance
appear with greater advantage.</P>
<P>But, leaving external ornaments, and the dra∣pery
of the picture, let us return to the figure
itself. The head of man is differently construc∣ted,
both internally and externally, from that of
any other animal. The head of the monkey
makes the nearest approach; its brain, however,
is proportionally less; and there are other dif∣ferences,
to be afterwards taken notice of. The
bodies of almost all quadrupeds are entirely co∣vered
with hair. In man, the head alone has
this ornament before the age of puberty, and it
is more amply furnished with hair than the head
of any other animal. The monkey resembles
man very much in his ears, nose, and teeth.</P>
<P>Among animals, there is a great diversity in
the size, position, and number of their teeth.
Some are furnished with teeth in both jaws;
others have them only in the under-jaw; in
some they are widely separated from each other;
<PB N="457" REF="470"/>
and are close and united in others. The pa∣late
of some fishes is a hard bony plate, stuck
full of sharp points, which perform the office of
teeth.</P>
<P>The mouths of most animals are armed with
some solid substance, which enables them to ap∣prehend
or grind their food. The teeth of men,
quadrupeds, and fishes, the beaks of birds, the
pinchers, saws, &amp;c. of insects, are all hard instru∣ments,
and, like the nails, horns, and hoofs,
derive their origin from the nerves. We for∣merly
remarked, that nerves, when exposed to
the air, acquire a surprising hardness. As the
mouth gives a free access to the air, it is there∣fore
natural to think that the nerves which ter∣minate
there should harden, and produce the
teeth, the bony plate, the beak, the pinchers,
and all the other solid parts of animals.</P>
<P>The neck supports the head, and unites it to
the body. It is larger and stronger in most
quadrupeds than in man. Fishes, and other
animals which are not furnished with lungs simi∣lar
to ours, have no neck. Birds, in general,
have longer necks than other animals. Those
birds which have short claws have likewise short
necks, and <HI>vice versa.</HI> Aristotle says, that birds
of prey, which have pounces, are all short necked.</P>
<P>The human breast is proportionally larger
than that of other animals; and none but man
and the monkey have collar-bones. The
breasts of women are larger and more promi∣nent
<PB N="458" REF="471"/>
than those of men: But their consistence
and structure are nearly the same; for the
breasts of men can secrete milk. There are
many examples of this fact; and it commonly
happens at the age of puberty. I have seen a
young man of fifteen years squeeze more than a
spoonful of milk out of one breast. Among
animals there is a great variety in the number
and situation of their paps. Some, as the mon∣key
and elephant, have only two placed on the
fore part of the breast; others have four, as the
bear; others, as the sheep, have only two situ∣ated
between the hinder legs; others have them
in great numbers upon the belly, as the bitch
and the sow. Birds, and all the oviparous
animals, have no paps. Viviparous fishes,
as the whale, the dolphin, &amp;c. have breasts,
and suckle their young. The form of the
breasts varies in different animals, and even
in the same animal at different ages. It is al∣ledged,
that women whose breasts are shaped
like a pear, make the best nurses, because the
mouth of the child comprehends not only the
nipple, but part of the breast itself.</P>
<P>Below the breast is the belly, in which the
navel makes a conspicuous figure. In other a∣nimals
it is hardly perceptible; and even the
monkey has nothing but a kind of callosity in
place of it.</P>
<P>The arms of man have little resemblance to
the fore feet of quadrupeds, and still less to
<PB N="459" REF="472"/>
the wings of birds. The monkey tribe are the
only animals which have arms and hands; but
their structure is more rude, and their propor∣tions
less exact than those of man; his shoul∣ders
are likewise larger, and differently con∣structed
from those of any other animal; and
it is on the top of the shoulders that he can bear
the heaviest burdens.</P>
<P>The form of the back differs not much from
that of some quadrupeds; the region of the
reins is indeed more muscular and strong. But
the buttocks are peculiar to the human body;
the thighs of quadrupeds are often mistaken for
these parts, though they be totally different.
Man being the only animal who can support
himself perfectly erect, the swelling, or cushion
on the top of his thighs, is necessary to sustain
him in that posture.</P>
<P>The human foot is very different from that
of all other animals, the monkey not excepted.
The foot of the ape is rather a kind of hand;
its toes are long, and situated like fingers, the
middle one being by much the longest; and it has
no heel. The sole of the foot is likewise lar∣ger
in man, and his toes are better adapted for
preserving the equilibrium of the body in walk∣ing,
running, dancing, and other movements.</P>
<P>The human nails are less than those of other
animals. If they protruded much beyond the
points of the fingers, they would obstruct the
dexterity of the hand. Those savages who al∣low
<PB N="460" REF="473"/>
them to grow to an unnatural length, use
them for flaying and tearing animals. But, al∣though
their nails be stronger and longer than
ours, they can by no means be compared to the
hoofs or claws of other animals.</P>
<P>With regard to the proportions of the human
body, we have no exact knowledge. The same
parts have not the same proportions in any two
individuals; and, even in the same person, the
corresponding parts are not perfectly similar.
For example, the right arm or leg have seldom
the same dimensions with the left. Repeated
observations alone can ascertain a standard by
which we may be enabled to form a perfect
idea of the natural and best proportions of the
human figure. It is not be comparing men, or
taking their dimensions, that we are to expect
any light upon this subject: We have more
to hope from the art of designing, and the
efforts which have been made in imitating Na∣ture.
Taste and sentiment have exceeded the
limits of mechanical operations. The square
and compass are laid aside, and we trust more
to the impressions made on the senses. Every
possible form has been realized in bronze or in
marble. We recognise the standard of Na∣ture
more by imitation of her, than by her own
productions; and we judge better concerning
the perfection of a statue by viewing it, than
by taking its different dimensions. It is by
long practice in the art of designing, and by de∣licacy
<PB N="461" REF="474"/>
of sentiment, that eminent statuaries have
been enabled to make men feel the justness of
proportion in the works of Nature. The an∣tients
made statues so exquisitely fine, that they
have uniformly been regarded as exact repre∣sentations
of the most perfect human figures.
These statues, which were only copies of the
human form, are now considered as originals;
because they were not imitated from an indivi∣dual,
but from the whole species so attentively
compared and diligently observed, that it is im∣possible
to find an equal degree of symmetry
and proportion in any one man that ever ex∣isted.
We shall, therefore, relate the dimen∣sions
of the different parts which these artists
have fixed as standards of perfection. They
commonly divide the height of the body into
ten times the length of the face; they likewise
divide each <HI>face,</HI> or tenth of the body, into three
equal parts; the first commences at the spring∣ing
of the hair on the forehead, and terminates
at the root of the nose; the nose is the second
division; and the third extends from the nose
to the end of the chin. In measuring the rest
of the body, they use the term <HI>nose,</HI> or length
of the nose, to denote the third of a face, or the
thirtieth part of the body. The first face be∣gins
at the root of the hair above the forehead,
and extends to the end of the chin; but, from
the top of the forehead to the crown, there is
still a third of a face, or a nose, in height. Thus,
<PB N="462" REF="475"/>
from the top of the head to the end of the chin,
there is a face and a third; from the chin to
the juncture of the clavicles, two thirds of a
face; and, therefore, from the top of the breast
to the crown of the head, is twice the length
of the face, or the fifth of the body; from the
joining of the clavicles to the under part of the
paps, they reckon one face; from this to the
navel is a fourth face; and the fifth extends
from the navel to the division of the inferior
extremities, which should complete half of the
length of the body. Two faces are exhausted
between the thigh and knee, to the last of which
they allow half a face, being the first half of
the eight face; two faces are assigned between
the knee and top of the foot, and from that to
the sole half a face, which completes the ten
faces, or length of the body. This division has
been made from men of ordinary size; but, in
those of a higher stature, they allow about half
a face additional between the paps and the com∣mencement
of the thighs, which, in tall men, is
not the middle of the body. When the arms
are fully stretched in a horizontal line, the space
between the tops of the middle fingers is equal
to the length of the body. From the joining of
the collar-bone to the articulation of the shoul∣der-bone
with that of the arm, is one face.
When the arm hangs down, or is bended for∣ward,
it is four faces in length; two between
the joint of the shoulder and the elbow, and
<PB N="463" REF="476"/>
two between the elbow and the root of the
little finger, in all five faces, and an equal num∣ber
for the other arm, which is precisely the
length of the body; about half a face still re∣mains
for the length of the fingers; but it must
be remarked, that half a face is lost in the joints
of the elbows and shoulders, when the arms are
extended. The hand is about a face in length, the
thumb a third of a face, or a nose, and the longest
toe is of the same length with the thumb. The
under part of the foot is equal in length to the
sixth part of the height of the body. For the
reasons already mentioned, if an experiment be
made of these dimensions upon any individual,
they will appear to be extremely imperfect. It
is still more difficult to fix the proportional
thickness of the different parts of the body.
The changes are so great when the same man is
meagre, or in good case, and the action of the
muscles in different positions, creates so much
variety in the dimensions of the parts, that it is
almost impossible to give any determinate rules
upon this subject.</P>
<P>The superior parts of the body, in infan∣cy,
are larger than the inferior; the thighs and
legs are not nearly equal to half the length
of the whole body; as the child advances in
years, the inferior parts grow more in propor∣tion
than the superior; and, when the growth
is complete, the thighs and legs are very nearly
one half of the length of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="477"/>
The anterior part of the chest, in women, is
more elevated, and its diameter larger, than in
men; but the chests of the latter are propor∣tionally
broader. The haunches of women are
likewise larger than those of men; because the
haunch-bones of women, and those which join
them and compose the pelvis, are proportionally
larger. These differences in the structure of the
chest and pelvis are so perceptible, that it is easy,
by this criterion, to distinguish the skeleton of a
woman from that of a man.</P>
<P>There are great varieties in the length of men.
Those are said to be tall who are from five feet
eight inches to six feet high. The middle sta∣ture
is from five feet five to five feet eight;
and those who fall below these dimensions are
said to be of small stature. Women, in general,
are two or three inches below the standard of
men. Of giants and dwarfs, notice shall be
taken in another place.</P>
<P>Though the human body be externally more
delicate, it is, however, very nervous, and per∣haps
stronger, for its size, than the most robust
quadrupeds. In comparing the force of a lion
to that of a man, it ought to be considered, that
the lion is armed with teeth and talons; and that
these dreadful weapons convey a false idea of
real strength. The arms which man has recei∣ved
from Nature are not offensive; and happy
had it been, if art had never put into his
<PB N="465" REF="478"/>
hands weapons more destructive than the claws
of the lion.</P>
<P>But there is a juster method of instituting a
comparison between the strength of a man and
that of the other animals, namely, by the weight
they are able to carry. It is affirmed, that the
porters of Constantinople can carry burdens of
nine hundred pounds weight; and Desaguliers
tells us, that, by means of a certain harness, by
which every part of a man's body was propor∣tionably
loaded, the person he employed in this
experiment was able to support, in an erect po∣sture,
a weight not less than 2000 pounds. A
horse, which is about six times the size of an
ordinary man, ought, therefore, when managed
in the same manner, to bear 12,000, or 14,000
pounds; an enormous weight, in comparison of
what that animal can support, even when it is
distributed with every possible advantage.</P>
<P>The strength of animals may likewise be esti∣mated
by agility and perseverance in labour.
Men accustomed to running, outstrip horses, or
at least continue their speed much longer; and
a man will accomplish a long journey sooner,
and be less fatigued, than even the best road∣horses.
The royal messengers of Ispahan, who
are trained to running, go 36 leagues in 14 or
15 hours. We are assured by travellers, that
the Hottentots out-run lions in the chace; and
that those savages who lie upon hunting, pur∣sue
and even catch deer, and other animals of
<PB N="466" REF="479"/>
equal swiftness. Many other stories are told of
the amazing nimbleness of savages, of the long
journies they accomplish on foot, over the most
craggy mountains, where there is no path to
direct, and every obstacle to obstruct their pro∣gress.
These people are said to travel 1000
leagues in six weeks, or at most two months. If
we except birds, whose muscles are proportion∣ally
stronger than those of any other animal, no
other creature could support such long continued
fatigue. The civilized man is ignorant of his
own strength; nor is he sensible how much he
is weakened by effeminacy, nor to what extent
he might recover his native force by an habitual
and vigorous exercise of his powers.</P>
<P>Men of extraordinary strength sometimes ap∣pear
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nos quoque vidimus Athanatum nomine prodigiosue osten∣tationis quingenario thorace plumbeo indutum, cothurnisque quingentorum pondo calcatum, per scenam ingredi. Plin. lib. 7.</NOTE>. But this gift of Nature, which would
be highly valuable in the savage state, is of little
use among polished nations, where more depends
on mental than corporeal powers, and where
manual labour is confined to the inferior orders
of men.</P>
<P>Men are much stronger than women; and
they have too often employed this superiority in
exercising a cruel and tyrannical dominion over
the weaker sex, who were entitled to share with
them both the pleasure and the pains of life.
Savage nations condemn the women to perpe∣tual
<PB N="467" REF="480"/>
labour. They cultivate the ground, and per∣form
every office of drudgery, while the men
indolently recline in their hammocks, from
which they never think of stirring, unless when
they go a hunting or fishing; and so averse are
they to motion, that they have often been known
to stand in the same position for several hours.
A savage has no idea of walking for amusement;
and nothing astonishes him more than to see
Europeans walking backwards and forwards in
quest of nothing. All men are naturally indo∣lent;
but the savages of warm countries are not
only the most lazy of human beings, but the
most tyrannical to their women, whom they
treat with a cruel barbarity. In nations more
civilized, men dictate laws to the women. These
laws are always more severe in proportion to
the grossness of the national manners; and it is
only among people highly polished that women
have obtained that equality of condition which
is due to them, and which contributes so power∣fully
to the happiness of society. This polite∣ness
of manners is the genuine offspring of the
softer sex; they have opposed it to the arms of
the victor, while their modesty has taught us to
acknowledge the empire of beauty, a natural ad∣vantage
greatly superior to mere strength. But,
to give it full force and value, requires the as∣sistance
of art; for the ideas of beauty are so
different, so capricious, and even contradictory,
that the women, it is probable, have gained more
<PB N="468" REF="481"/>
by the art of making themselves amiable, than
by beauty itself, of which men form such oppo∣site
judgments. Men are agreed as to the ulti∣mate
object of their passion for the other sex,
the estimation of which is augmented by the
difficulty of obtaining it. The beauty of wo∣men
commenced the moment they learned to
make themselves respectable, by refusing all ap∣proaches
to their hearts which proceeded not from
delicacy of sentiment; and, whenever the influ∣ence
of sentiment was felt, polished manners was
a necessary consequence.</P>
<P>The taste of beauty, among the antients, dif∣fered
widely from ours. With them, a small
fore-head and joined eye-brows were charming
features in a female countenance; and, in Per∣sia,
large joined eye-brows are still highly e∣steemed.
In some Indian countries, black teeth
and white hair are necessary ingredients in the
character of a beauty; and in the Marian-islands
it is a capital object with ladies to blacken
their teeth with herbs, and to bleach their hair
with certain liquors. Beauty, in China and
Japan, is composed of a large countenance,
small and half concealed eyes, a broad nose, little
feet, and a prominent belly. Some Indians of
America and of Asia compress the heads of their
children between two wooden planks, with a
view to enlarge and beautify the face; others
compress them laterally, others depress the
crown only, and others make them as round as
<PB N="469" REF="482"/>
possible. Every nation has ideas of beauty pecu∣liar
to itself; and every individual has his own
notions and taste concerning it. These peculi∣arities
probably originate from the first agree∣able
impressions we receive of certain objects;
and therefore depend more upon chance and
habit than upon difference of constitution. When
we come to treat of the senses, we shall perhaps
be able to give more determined ideas concern∣ing
those perceptions of beauty we receive by
the eye.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Old Age and Death.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY object in Nature must change and
decay. No sooner do the bodies of men
arrive at full maturity, than they instantly be∣gin
to decline. The waste is at first insensible;
several years frequently revolve before we per∣ceive
any considerable alteration. But we ought
to feel the weight of our years, better than their
number can be estimated by strangers; and, as
those are seldom deceived who judge of our age
by external characters, we would be still more
sensible of it from what passes within us, if we
were more attentive to our feelings, and de∣ceived
not ourselves by vanity and fallacious
hopes.</P>
<P>When the body has acquired its full length,
it increases in thickness: The commencement
of this augmentation is the first step towards
decay; for this extension is not a continua∣tion
of growth, which would communicate
force and activity, but merely an addition of
superfluous matter, that blows up the body, and
loads it with a useless weight. This matter,
<PB N="471" REF="484"/>
which is denominated fat, generally appears at
the age of 35 or 40 years; and, in proportion
as the quantity of it augments, the body loses
its former lightness and freedom of motion; its
generative faculty is diminished; its members
turn unwieldy; and it acquires extension at the
expence of strength and activity.</P>
<P>Besides, the bones increase in solidity; the nu∣tritious
juices, which formerly served to expand
the bones, now only increase their quantity of
matter, by filling up their internal cavities; the
membranes are changed into cartilages, and the
cartilages into bones; the fibres of the muscles
grow rigid; the skin is deprived of its moisture,
and wrinkles are gradually formed in it; the
hair turns hoary; the teeth fall out; the visage
assumes a hagard appearance, the body bends
forward, &amp;c. The first approaches of this state
are perceptible before the age of 40; they ad∣vance
by slow degrees till 60, and more rapidly
from that to 70, when decrepitude commences,
and continues to augment till 90 or 100, when
death puts a final period to our existence.</P>
<P>We shall now take a more particular survey
of these changes; and, as we have inquired into
the causes of the growth and expansion of the
human body, let us also investigate those of its
decay and dissolution. At the commencement
of our existence, the bones are only small fibres,
of a soft and ductile substance, and gradually
acquire consistence and solidity. They may be
<PB N="472" REF="485"/>
considered, in their original state, as small tubes
lined, both within and without, with a thin
membrane: This double membrane furnishes
the osseous matter; for the small interval be∣tween
the internal and external periosteum is
soon converted into a bony plate. Some idea
of the production and growth of bones may be
formed, by comparing them with the manner
in which wood and the more solid parts of ve∣getables
are produced. We shall take, for ex∣ample,
the fig-tree or the alder, which are at
first hollow in the middle, like the thigh and
other hollow bones of the body. When a bud,
that is to form a branch, begins to extend, it is
only a soft ductile matter, which, by extension,
becomes a slender herbaceous tube filled with
pith. The external and internal surfaces of
this tube are covered with a fibrous membrane,
as well as the internal partitions by which the
cavity is divided. These membranes, however
thin, are composed of several plates of fibres
lying above each other, which are still soft,
but gradually harden by deposing the sap
which they absorb for their nourishment; and
by this means a woody plate is formed, du∣ring
the first year, between the two membranes,
which is more or less thick in proportion to the
quantity of sap that has been deposited between
the external and internal membranes. But,
though each of these membranes become woody
internally, their external surfaces remain soft
<PB N="473" REF="486"/>
and ductile; and, the following year, when the
bud at the top of the branch begins to expand,
the sap rises through the soft fibres of each
membrane, and converts them, by its sediments,
into other woody plates. The same process
goes on annually; and, in this manner, the tree
or branch gradually increases in thickness. The
internal cavity likewise augments in proportion
to the growth of the branch; because the inter∣nal
membrane extends along with the other
parts, and the woody plates are only applied
successively to the plates already formed. If we
examine a branch, or ajoint, which has been the
product of one year, we shall find, that it uni∣formly
preserves the same figure through all the
stages of its growth. The joints or knots which
mark the production of each year, become fixed
points for the reaction of those powers that ex∣pand
the contiguous parts during the following
year. The superior buds react against these
points, and, by expanding themselves, form new
branches or joints in the same manner as the first
were produced.</P>
<P>The process of ossification would be very si∣milar
to that we have now described, if the fixed
points of the bones began at the extremities, in
place of the middle. At first the bones of the
foetus are only small threads, or tubes, of a duc∣tile
matter, which are easily perceived through
the delicate and transparent skin. The thigh∣bone,
for example, is then a small short tube,
<PB N="474" REF="487"/>
like the herbaceous tubes above described. This
tube is shut at both ends by a pulpy substance,
and its external and internal surfaces are cover∣ed
with two membranes composed of several
layers of soft and ductile fibres. In proportion
as this tube receives nutritious juices, the two
extremities extend and recede from the middle
point, which always preserves the same station.
The extremities cannot extend without reacting
against this middle point; and the parts which are
nearest it begin first to acquire solidity. The
first bony plate, like the first plate of wood, is
produced in the interval which separates the
two membranes or periostea. But the ossifica∣tion
commences in the middle, and gradually
extends to the extremities, which remain soft
long after the middle parts are converted into
bone. The middle parts of bones, therefore,
being first ossified, it is impossible that they
should afterwards expand equally with those
parts which remain longer in a soft and ductile
state. This is the reason why bones are always
thinnest in the middle, and thickest at the ex∣tremities.
But, independent of this difference
between the longitudinal growth of bones and
of wood, the analogy between their increase in
thickness is very striking: For the first bony
plate is produced from the internal part of the
periosteum; and, after the formation of this
plate between the two periostea, two other plates
are soon formed, one on each side of the first,
<PB N="475" REF="488"/>
to which they adhere; and, by this means, both
the circumference of the bone, and the diameter
of its cavity, are augmented. Thus the interior
parts of the two periostea continue successively
to produce bony plates, in the same manner as
woody plates are produced from the bark of
vegetables.</P>
<P>But, after the bone has acquired its full
growth, after the periostea cease to furnish osse∣ous
matter, then the nutritious juices, which
were formerly employed in augmenting the
bulk of the bone, serve only to increase its den∣sity.
These juices deposite themselves in the
internal parts of the bones, and give them more
weight and solidity, as may easily be perceived
by comparing the weight and density of an ox
with those of a calf. The substance of the bones
become, in process of time, so compact, as not
to admit the circulation of those juices which are
necessary for their support and nourishment.
The substance of the bones, therefore, must now
undergo a change similar to that which takes
place in old trees, after they have acquired their
full solidity; and this change is one of the first
causes which render the dissolution of the hu∣man
body inevitable.</P>
<P>The cartilages, which may be regarded as soft
and imperfect bones, likewise receive nutritious
juices, which gradually augment their density.
They become more and more solid as we ad∣vance
in years; and, in old age, they are almost
<PB N="476" REF="489"/>
as hard as bones. This rigidity of the cartilages
renders the motion of the joints extremely dif∣ficult,
and, at last, deprives us of the use of
our members, and produces a total cessation of
external movements. This is a second, and
more marked cause of death, because it mani∣fests
itself by a laborious performance of the
common actions of the body.</P>
<P>The membranes likewise become hard and
dry, as we advance in years. Those, for ex∣ample,
which surround the bones, soon lose
their flexibility. At the age of 20, they are in∣capable
of farther extension. The muscular
fibres suffer a similar change, in proportion to
the time of life; though, to the touch, they seem
to be softer as age increases. It is not the mus∣cles,
however, but the skin, that occasions this
perception. After the body is come to its full
growth, the fat increases, and, by being inter∣posed
between the fibres of the muscles, and be∣tween
the skin and the muscles themselves,
makes them feel softer, when, in reality, their
density is greatly increased. Of this we have
an incontestible proof by comparing the flesh of
young with that of old animals. In the for∣mer,
it is tender and delicate; but, in the latter,
it is dry, hard, and unfit for eating.</P>
<P>The skin always extends as the body increases;
but, when the body diminishes, the skin has not
elasticity enough to enable it to contract to its
former dimensions: It, therefore, continues in
<PB N="477" REF="490"/>
wrinkles and folds, which can never be effaced.
The wrinkles of the face partly arise from this
cause; but, in their production, they have a
relation to the form, to the features, and to the
habitual motions of the countenance. If we
examine the face of a man of 25 or 30 years of
age, we may trace the origin of all the wrinkles
which will appear in old age, especially when he
laughs, cries, or makes any violent grimace.
All the folds which are exhibited in these actions
will in time become indelible wrinkles.</P>
<P>In proportion as we advance in years, the
bones, the cartilages, the membranes, the flesh,
the skin, and every fibre of the body, become
more solid, hard, and dry. Every part shrinks
and contracts; and every movement is perform∣ed
with slowness and difficulty: The circulation
of the fluids is sluggish and interrupted; perspi∣ration
is diminished; the secretions change; di∣gestion
becomes slow and laborious; the nutri∣tious
juices are less abundant, and, being rejec∣ted
by parts which are already too dense, they
communicate no supplies. These parts, there∣fore,
may be regarded as already dead, because
they have ceased to receive nourishment. Thus
the body dies by inches; its motions gradually
decay; life wears away by imperceptible de∣grees;
and death is only the last term in the
succession.</P>
<P>As, in women, the bones, the cartilages, the
muscles, and every other part of the body, are
<PB N="478" REF="491"/>
softer and less solid than those of men, they
must require more time in hardening to that
degree which occasions death: Women, of
course, ought to live longer than men. This
reasoning is confirmed by experience; for, by
consulting the bills of mortality, it appears, that,
after women have passed a certain age, they live
much longer than men who have arrived at the
same age.</P>
<P>From what has been said, it may also be con∣cluded,
that men who have a weakly appear∣ance,
and approach nearer to the constitution of
women, should live longer than those who are
more robust; and likewise, that persons of either
sex, who are long before they arrive at their full
growth, should outlive those who advance more
rapidly to that point; because, in this case, the
bones, cartilages, and fibres, are later in arriving
at that degree of solidity which is necessary to
their destruction.</P>
<P>This natural cause of death is common to all
animals, and even to vegetables. An oak only
perishes, because the oldest parts of the wood,
which are in the centre, become so hard and
compact, that they can receive no farther nou∣rishment.
The moisture they contain being de∣prived
of circulation, and not being replaced by
fresh sap, ferments, corrupts, and gradually re∣duces
the fibres of the wood into powder.</P>
<P>The duration of life may, in some measure,
be computed by the time occupied in growth.
A plant or an animal that acquires maturity in
<PB N="479" REF="492"/>
a short time, perishes much sooner than those
which are longer in arriving at that period. In
animals, as well as vegetables, the longitudinal
growth is first finished. Man grows in stature
till he be 16 or 18 years of age; but his body
is not completely unfolded in thickness before
that of 30. Dogs acquire their full length in
less than one year; but their growth in thick∣ness
is not finished till the second year. A man,
who grows 30 years, lives till 90 or 100; and a
dog, whose growth terminates in two or three
years, lives only 10 or 12. The same observa∣tion
may be applied to most animals. Fishes
continue to grow for a great number of years;
they accordingly live for centuries; because
their bones never acquire the density of those of
other animals. When we give the particular
history of animals, we shall examine whether
there be any exception to this rule, which Na∣ture
seems to follow in proportioning the du∣ration
of life to the time of growth, and whether
crows and stags live so long as is commonly ima∣gined.
But it may be laid down as a general
fact, that large animals live much longer than
small animals, because they require more time
to finish their growth.</P>
<P>Thus the causes of our dissolution are inevi∣table;
and it is equally impossible to retard that
fatal period, as to change the established laws of
Nature. The ideas of those visionaries, who
conceived the possibility of perpetuating human
<PB N="480" REF="493"/>
life by the use of certain medicines, would
have perished with themselves, if self-love did
not always induce us to believe what exceeds
the powers of Nature, and to be sceptical with
regard to the most certain and invariable truths.
The universal panacea, the transfusion of the
blood, and other methods which have been pro∣posed
to render our bodies immortal, are as chi∣merical
as the fountain of youth is fabulous.</P>
<P>When the constitution is sound, life may,
perhaps, be prolonged for a few years, by mo∣derating
the passions, and by temperance. But
even this is a doubtful point; for, if it be neces∣sary
that the body should exert its whole force,
and that it should waste all its powers by labour
and exercise, what advantages can we derive
from regimen and abstinence? Some men have
indeed exceeded the ordinary term of human
life: Without mentioning those extraordinary
instances of longevity recorded in the Philoso∣phical
Transactions, such as that of Par who
lived to the age of 144, and of Jenkins who
lived 165 years, we have many examples of the
prolongation of life to 110, and even 120.
These men, however, used no peculiar arts for
the preservation of their bodies. They appear,
on the contrary, to have been peasants, hunts∣men,
labourers, and people accustomed to abuse
their bodies, if it be possible to abuse them by
any other means than those of continual idleness
and debauchery.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="494"/>
Besides, the varieties of climate, and of the
modes of living, make no difference as to the
period of our existence, which is the same in the
European, the Negro, the Chinese, the Ameri∣can,
the civilized man and the savage, the rich
and the poor, the citizen and the peasant. Nei∣ther
does the difference of races, of food, or of
accommodation, make any change on the dura∣tion
of life. Men who feed upon raw flesh or
dried fish, on sago or rice, on cassada or roots,
live as long as those who are nourished with
bread and prepared victuals. It is apparent,
therefore, that the duration of life has no de∣pendence
either on manners or customs, or the
qualities of particular food: If luxury and in∣temperance
be excepted, nothing can alter those
laws of mechanism which regulate the number
of our years.</P>
<P>Any little differences which may be remarked
in the term of human life seem to be owing to
the quality of the air. There are generally
more old men in high than in low countries.
The mountains of Scotland, of Wales, of Au∣vergne,
and of Switzerland, have furnished
more examples of extreme old age than the
plains of Holland, Flanders, Germany, or Po∣land.
But, taking mankind in general, there is
hardly any difference in the duration of life.
When men are not cut off by accidental diseases,
they every where live 90 or 100 years. Our
ancestors never exceeded this period; and, since
<PB N="482" REF="495"/>
the age of David, it has suffered no variation.
If it should be asked, why the first races of men
lived 900, 930, and even 969 years? we may,
perhaps, be able to give a satisfactory answer.
The productions of the earth were then of a
different nature. The surface of the globe, as
we remarked when treating of the Theory of the
Earth, was, in the first ages of the world, less
solid and compact; because, gravity having act∣ed
only for a short time, terrestrial bodies had
not acquired their present density and consi∣stence.
The produce of the earth, therefore,
must have been analogous to its condition. The
surface being more loose and moist, its produc∣tions
would, of course, be more ductile and ca∣pable
of extension: Their growth, therefore,
and even that of the human body, would require
a longer time of being completed. The soft∣ness
and ductility of the bones, muscles, &amp;c.
would probably remain for a longer period, be∣cause
every species of food was more soft and
succulent. Hence, the full expansion of the hu∣man
body, or when it was capable of generating,
must have required 120 or 130 years; and the
duration of life would be in proportion to the
time of growth, as is uniformly the case at
present: For, if we suppose the age of puberty,
among the first races of men, to have been 130
years, as they now arrive at that age in 14 years,
the age of the Antedeluvians will be in exact
proportion to that of the present race; since, by
<PB N="483" REF="496"/>
multiplying these two numbers by seven, for
example, the age of the present race will be 90,
and that of the Antedeluvians will be 910. The
period of man's existence, therefore, may have
gradually diminished in proportion as the sur∣face
of the earth acquired more solidity by the
constant action of gravity; and it is probable,
that the period from the creation, to the days
of David, was sufficient to give the earth all
the density it was capable of receiving from the
influence of gravitation; and, consequently, that
the surface of the earth has ever since remained
in the same state, and that the terms of growth
in the productions of the earth, as well as the
duration of life, have been invariably fixed
from that period.</P>
<P>Independent of accidental diseases, which are
more frequent and dangerous in the latter pe∣riods
of life, old men are subject to natural in∣firmities
that originate solely from the decay of
the different parts of the body. The muscles
lose their tone, the head shakes, the hands trem∣ble,
the legs totter, the sensibility of the nerves
decreases, and every sense is blunted. But the
incapacity for generating is the most characteris∣tic
infirmity of old age. This impotency may
be ascribed to two causes; an alteration in the
seminal fluid, and a want of tension in the ex∣ternal
organs. The defect of tension is easily
explained from the conformation of the organ
itself, which is a spongy cavernous substance,
<PB N="484" REF="497"/>
fitted to receive into its cavities a great quantity
of blood, in order both to increase its size, and
to render it more rigid. In youth, this organ
is soft and flexible; and, of course, it is easily
extended by the impulse of the blood. But, as
we advance in years, like every other part of
the body, it becomes more solid, and loses its
flexibility. Hence, though the impulse of the
blood were equal to what it was in youth, this
impulse is unable to dilate an organ which has
become too dense to admit blood in a quantity
sufficient to produce an erection, that will answer
the purposes of generation.</P>
<P>With regard to the change, or rather sterility of
the seminal fluid, it cannot be prolific unless when
it contains organic particles transmitted from
every part of the body; for we have already
shown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, ch. 2. 3. &amp;c.</NOTE>, that the production of a small orga∣nized
being, similar to its parent, cannot be ef∣fected
without the union of the organic particles
sent from all parts of the body. But, in very
aged men, the parts have become too solid, and
can neither receive, assimilate, nor transmit, the
nutritive and prolific particles. The bones and
other solids, therefore, can neither produce nor
transmit organic particles correspondent to their
own natures; these particles must, of course, be
wanting in the seminal fluids of old men; and
this defect is sufficient to render them incapable
of generating.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="498"/>
But, admitting the sterility of old men to be
owing to a defect in the organic particles of
their seminal fluids, this defect may still be sup∣plied
by a young woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, ch. 10.</NOTE>, which not unfre∣quently
happens; for old men sometimes, though
rarely, generate; and, when they do produce,
they have a much smaller share in their children
than young men. This is likewise one reason
why young women, who are married to old, de∣crepit,
and deformed men, often produce mon∣sters,
or children still more deformed than their
fathers. But this is not a proper place for such
discussions.</P>
<P>The greatest part of mankind die of the scur∣vy,
the dropsy, or other diseases which seem to
proceed from a vitiation of the blood and other
fluids. Whatever influence the fluids may have
in the animal oeconomy, they are only passive
and divisible substances, and obey the impulses
of the solids, which are the true organic active
parts, and upon which the motion, the quality,
and even the quantity of the fluids entirely de∣pend.
In old age, the cavities of the vessels
contract, the muscles lose their tone, the secre∣tory
organs are obstructed; the blood, the lymph,
and the other fluids, of course, grow viscid, ex∣travasate,
and produce all those diseases and
symptoms which are usually ascribed to a vitia∣tion
of the humours. But the natural decay of
the solids is the original cause of these maladies.
<PB N="486" REF="499"/>
Though it be true, that the bad state of the
fluids proceeds from a depravity in the organiza∣tion
of the solids; yet the effects resulting from
a change in the fluids produce the most alarm∣ing
symptoms, if they become stagnant, or be
obstructed in their circulation by the contrac∣tion
of the vessels; if, by the relaxation of the
vessels, they extravasate, they must soon corrupt,
and corrode the weaker parts of the solids. In
this manner the causes of destruction perpetual∣ly
multiply; our internal enemies grow more
and more powerful, and at last put a period to
our existence.</P>
<P>All the causes of decay which I have men∣tioned
above, act continually upon the human
body, and gradually lead to its dissolution. Death,
which appears so terrible to us, is only the last
term in the succession of evils. Life begins to
decay long before it is entirely extinguished;
and the changes are perhaps greater from youth
till the beginning of our decay, than from de∣crepitude
to death; for we ought here to consi∣der
life as a subject capable of augmentation and
of diminution. When the foetus is first form∣ed,
the quantity of life is almost equal to no∣thing:
It gradually extends and acquire con∣sistence
and force, in proportion to the growth
and expansion of the body. On the other hand,
when the body begins to decay, the quantity of
life diminishes, till its final extinction. Thus
<PB N="487" REF="500"/>
life both commences and terminates by imper∣ceptible
degrees.</P>
<P>Why then should we be afraid of death, if
we have no reasonable apprehensions of its con∣sequences?
Why dread this single moment, which
has been preceded by an infinity of others of the
same order; since death is fully as natural as
life, and both arrive in the same manner, without
our being able to perceive their approach? If we
inquire of physicians, and those who are accu∣stomed
to observe the actions and sentiments of
the dying, we shall find, that, excepting in a few
acute diseases, attended with agitations and con∣vulsions,
which exhibit only the appearances of
pain, most men expire quietly, and without the
smallest indication of uneasiness. Even when
patients seem to be afflicted with the most dread∣ful
agonies, they have no existence but in the
imagination of the spectator: The truth of this
has been repeatedly attested by many people
who have recovered after the most violent com∣motions
and convulsions, who, notwithstanding,
were unable to recollect a single pang they had
felt, or a single idea or sentiment that had pas∣sed
during this seemingly distressful situation.</P>
<P>The greatest part of mankind, therefore, die
without being sensible of the fatal stroke; and
of those who preserve their senses to the last
groan, there is not, perhaps, one who does not
entertain some hope of recovery. Nature, for
the happiness of man, has rendered this princi∣ple
<PB N="488" REF="501"/>
much stronger than reason. Men never
cease to flatter themselves with hopes of recove∣ry,
even though they might judge of their real
condition from the example of others who had
been afflicted with the same incurable disorders,
from the tears of their friends, and from the
countenances or desertion of their physicians.
All these mortifying circumstances are only re∣garded
as premature and ill-grounded fears; and
hope never leaves us, till death shuts the scene.</P>
<P>A sick man tells you, that he feels the hand of
death, that the king of terrors is just about to
arrive, and that recovery is impossible: But if,
from zeal or indiscretion, he is informed of his
approaching dissolution, his countenance instant∣ly
changes, and he betrays all that uneasiness
which naturally attends the first intimation of
death. This man, it is evident, gives no credit
to his own assertions. He may entertain some
doubts concerning his situation; but his hopes
are always superior to his fears: And, if he were
not alarmed by that cruel parade of grief which
too often imbitters the sick man's couch, he
would never perceive the approach of his disso∣lution.</P>
<P>Death, therefore, is not that horrible object
which we have fancied to ourselves. It is a
spectre which terrifies us at a distance, but dis∣appears
when we come more close to it. Our
conceptions of it are founded on prejudice; and
we regard it not only as the greatest of all mis∣fortunes,
<PB N="489" REF="502"/>
but as accompanied with the most ex∣cruciating
tortures. The pain, it is said, must
be extreme when the soul separates from the
body; its duration may also be long, since time
is measured by the celerity of ideas; and one
painful moment, by augmenting the rapidity of
our ideas, may have the appearance of an age,
when the train of ideas proceeds with their
usual gentleness and tranquillity. This rea∣soning
is such an abuse of philosophy, that,
if it had no influence in increasing the miseries
of human life, it merits nothing but silence and
contempt. As such arguments, however, gain
credit with weak minds, and render the aspect
of death a thousand times more hideous than
it really is, a refutation of them may be attend∣ed
with utility.</P>
<P>When the soul is first united to the body, do
we feel a joy that transports us? No. This u∣nion
is effected without our perception; why,
then, should we be conscious of their dissolution?
What reason have we to believe that the separa∣tion
of the soul and body is attended with ex∣treme
pain? What cause should produce this
pain? Does it reside in the soul or in the body?
Pain of mind can only result from thought; and
pain of body is always proportioned to its strength
or weakness. At the approach of natural death,
the body is in its weakest state, and, of course,
it can feel but very little, if any pain.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="503"/>
Let us now suppose a violent death: Can the
sufferings of a man, for example, whose head is
carried off by a cannon-ball, be more than in∣stantaneous?
Can the succession of his ideas, du∣ring
this instant, be so rapid as to make the pain
seem to continue for an hour, a day, or a cen∣tury?
We shall endeavour to discuss this point.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that the succession of our ide∣as
is the only natural measure of time, and that
we conceive it to be shorter or longer in propor∣tion
to the uniformity or irregularity of their
motions. But, in this measure, there is a unit
or sixed point, which is neither arbitrary nor in∣definite,
but is determined by nature, and cor∣responds
with the particular organization of in∣dividuals.
Two ideas, which succeed each other,
must necessarily be separated by an interval;
one thought, however rapid, must require
some portion of time before it can be follow∣ed
by another. No succession can take place
in an indivisible instant. The same remark is
applicable to sentiment or feeling. A certain
time must elapse in the transition from pain to
pleasure, or from one painful sensation to ano∣ther.
This interval between our thoughts and
sensations is the unit or fixed point formerly
mentioned; and it can neither be extremely
long nor extremely short, but must be nearly e∣qual
in its duration; because it depends on the
nature of the mind and the organization of the
body, the movements of which must have a de∣termined
degree of celerity. In the same indi∣vidual,
<PB N="491" REF="504"/>
therefore, there can be no succession of
ideas so rapid, or so slow, as to produce that e∣normous
difference in duration, by which a mo∣mentary
pain is prolonged to that of an hour, a
day, or a century.</P>
<P>A very acute pain, if continued for a certain
time, uniformly brings on either fainting or
death. Our organs, which are only endowed
with a certain degree of force, cannot resist more
than a certain quantity of pain. If the pain be∣comes
excessive, the organs are unable to sup∣port
it; and, of course, they can transmit no in∣telligence
of it to the mind, with which there
is no correspondence but by the distinct action
of these organs. In this case, the action of the
organs is interrupted; and, consequently, all
internal sensation is at an end.</P>
<P>What I have already remarked is perhaps
more than sufficient to evince, that the instant
of death is neither accompanied with extreme
nor long-continued pain. But, in order to era∣dicate
the fears of the most timid of mankind,
we shall still add a few words upon this subject.
Excessive pain extinguishes all reflection, though
some symptoms of it have sometimes appeared in
the very moment of violent death. When Charles
XII. received the blow which terminated, in an
instant, both his enterprizes and his existence,
he clapped his hand upon his sword. This mor∣tal
pang, since it excluded not reflection, could
not be excessive. He found himself attacked;
<PB N="492" REF="505"/>
he considered that he ought to defend himself;
it is evident, therefore, that he felt no greater
pain than he would have suffered from an ordi∣nary
stroke. This action could not be the re∣sult
of a mechanical impulse; for I have shewn,
in the description of man, that the most preci∣pitate
movements of the passions depend upon
reflection, and are nothing but habitual exer∣tions
of the mind.</P>
<P>I would not have dwelt so long upon this
subject, if I had not been anxious to eradicate a
prejudice so repugnant to the happiness of man.
I have seen many victims sacrificed to this pre∣judice,
especially among the female sex, who
die daily through the terror of death. Such
dreadful apprehensions seem peculiarly to affect
those who, by nature or education, are endowed
with superior sensibility; for the vulgar look
forward to their dissolution, either with indiffe∣rence,
or, at least, without any degree of ter∣ror.</P>
<P>True philosophy views objects as they exist.
Our internal feelings would uniformly accord
with this philosophy, if they were not pervert∣ed
by the illusions of imagination, and by the
unfortunate habit of creating hypothetical phan∣toms
of excessive pains, and of pleasures which
exceed the limits of human nature. Objects
are only terrible or ravishing, at a distance;
when we have the resolution or the wisdom to
take a near inspection of them, every alarming
<PB N="493" REF="506"/>
and every alluring circumstance instantly dis∣appear.</P>
<P>If this doctrine, concerning the gradual and
generally insensible decay of the vital powers,
required any farther support, no inconsiderable
aid might be derived to it from the uncertainty of
the signs of death. If we consult the writers on this
subject, and particularly those of Winslow and
Bruhier, we shall receive full conviction, that,
between life and death, the shade is often so un∣distinguishable,
as to elude all the powers of the
medical art. They inform us, 'That the co∣lour
of the face, the heat of the body, the sup∣pleness
of the joints, are uncertain marks of
life; and that the paleness of the countenance,
the coldness of the body, the rigidity of the
extremities, the cessation of motion, and the
abolition of the senses, are very equivocal signs
of death.' The same remark may be made
with regard to the apparent cessation of the pulse,
and of respiration: These motions are often so
slow, that they elude all our perceptions. A
mirror or a candle is applied near the mouth of
a sick man; if the mirror be sullied, or the flame
vibrates, life is concluded not to be extinguished.
But these effects are often produced, after death
has actually taken place; and sometimes they
appear not, though the patient be still alive.
When we wish to be certain of the death of any
person, we apply fumes of tobacco, and other
irritating bodies to the nostrils; we endeavour
<PB N="494" REF="507"/>
to excite the organs by violent agitations, by
pricking or scarifying the hands and feet, by
applying red hot iron or wax to different parts
of the body, by raising loud and unusual cries,
&amp;c. But instances have occurred where all these
and similar trials have proved abortive; and yet,
to the astonishment of the spectators, the per∣son
supposed to be dead has afterwards recover∣ed
the powers of life.</P>
<P>Hence, nothing can be more apparent, than
that a certain condition of life has a great
resemblance to actual death. Both humanity
and reason, therefore, require that we should be
cautious of abandoning the body, and of com∣mitting
it too hastily to the grave. Neither ten,
twenty, nor twenty-four hours are sufficient to
distinguish a real from an apparent death; since
instances are not wanting of persons returning
from the tomb at the end of two and of three
days. Why should we precipitate the interment
of those persons, the prolongation of whose lives
we most ardently desire? Why should a prac∣tice
subsist, in the abolition of which all men
are equally interested? Are not the frequent a∣buses
recorded by physicians sufficient to deter us
from too hasty interments? Mr Winslow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Winslow dissert. sur l'incertitude des signes de la mort, p. 34.</NOTE> in∣forms
us, 'That the body, though living, is
sometimes so completely deprived of every vi∣tal
function, that it has every external appear∣ance
<PB N="495" REF="508"/>
of death. But,' he remarks, 'both re∣ligion
and charity require, that a reasonable
time should be allowed to discover whether any
signs of life may not still manifest themselves,
otherwise we become actual murderers, by
burying people who are not dead. If we may
credit the greatest number of authors, three
days, or 72 hours, are sufficient for this pur∣pose.
If, during this period, no signs of life
appear, but, on the contrary, the body begins
to emit a cadaverous odor, which is an infal∣lible
mark of death, we may then bury it with∣out
scruple.'</P>
<P>We shall afterwards have an opportunity of
mentioning the customs of different nations with
regard to funerals, embalming, &amp;c. The great∣est
part, even of the most savage people, pay more
attention than we to their departed friends:
What we esteem a ceremony only, they regard
as a primary duty: They respect their dead;
they clothe them; they speak to them; they
recite their exploits; they praise their virtues:
But we, who pretend to superior sensibility, fly
from our dead, and inhumanly abandon them;
we desire not to see them; we have neither the
courage nor the inclination to speak of them;
we even avoid such objects or situations as might
recall the idea of them: We are, therefore, ei∣ther
more indifferent, or weaker than sava∣ges.</P>
<P><PB N="496" REF="509"/>
Having thus traced the history of life and
death with regard to the individual, let us now
consider both in relation to the whole species.
Man dies at every age; and, though the dura∣tion
of his life be longer than that of most ani∣mals;
yet it is unquestionably more various and
uncertain. Attempts have lately been made to
ascertain these uncertainties, and, by observations,
to fix some standard with regard to the morta∣lity
of mankind at different periods of life. If
these observations were sufficiently numerous
and exact, they would be of great utility in de∣termining
the number of people, their increase,
the consumption of provisions, &amp;c. Many au∣thors
have written with ability on this subject.
M. de Parcieux, of the academy of sciences, has
lately published an excellent work for regulating
tontins and annuities. But, as his principal ob∣ject
was to calculate the mortality of annuitants,
and as such persons are particularly pitched up∣on
for their apparent strength of constitution,
his calculations cannot be applied to mankind in
general. For the same reason, his curious tables
of the mortality of the different orders of re∣ligious
must be confined to their proper objects.
Hally, Grant, Kersboom, Simpson, &amp;c. have
also given tables of the mortality of the human
species. But, as their observations have been li∣mited
to the bills of mortality in a few parishes
of London, Breslau, and other large towns, they
can afford little information as to the general
<PB N="497" REF="510"/>
mortality of mankind. To make complete ta∣bels
of this kind, it is necessary to scrutinize the
parish-registers, not only of London, Paris, &amp;c.
where there is a perpetual ingress of strangers
and egress of natives, but likewise those of the
country, that, comparing the results of both,
general conclusions may be formed. M. Dupré
de St Maur, a member of the French Academy,
has executed this plan upon twelve parishes in
the country of France, and three in Paris. Ha∣ving

Many useful conclusions might be drawn from
the above tables of M. Dupré. But I shall con∣fine
myself to those which regard the probabi∣lities
of the duration of life. It is observable,
that, in the columns under the years, 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and other round numbers,
as 25, 35, &amp;c. there are, in the country-parishes,
more deaths than in the preceding or subsequent
columns. This is owing to the ages not being
justly registered, most country-people not being
able to ascertain their ages within less than two
or three years. If they die at 58 or 59, they
are registered at 60, and so of other round num∣bers.
But this irregularity gives rise to no great
inconvenience, as it can easily be corrected by
the manner in which the numbers succeed each
other in the tables.</P>
<P>It appears from the tables of the country-pa∣rishes,
that one half of the children die nearly
about the end of the fourth year; but, from the
Paris table, it appears that 16 years are neces∣sary
to produce the same effect. This great dif∣ference
proceeds from the general practice of
the Parisians sending their children to be nursed
in the country, which necessarily increases the
number of deaths during the first years of in∣fancy.
In the following calculation, I have
estimated the probabilities of the duration of life
from a combination of both tables; which must,
therefore, make a very near approach to the
truth.</P>

From this table it appears that a new born in∣fant,
or a child of 0 age, has an equal chance of
living 8 years; that a child of 1 year will live
33 more; that a child of 2 years will live 38
more; that a man of 20 years will live 33 and
5 months more; and that a man of 30 years
will live 28 more, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It may be farther observed, 1. That 7 years is
the age at which the longest duration of life is
to be expected; for there is then an equal chance
of surviving 42 years 3 months; 2. That, at 12
years, one fourth of life is expired, since we
have no reason to hope for above 38 or 39 years
more; 3. That at 28 or 29 years, we have lived
one half of our days, since there are only 28
more to be expected; and, lastly, That, at the
age of 50, three fourths of life are gone, the
remaining chance extending only to 16 or 17
years longer.</P>
<P>But these physical truths, however mortifying,
may be alleviated by moral considerations. The
first 15 years of our existence may be regarded
as nothing: Every thing that passes during this
long period, is either obliterated from the me∣mory,
or has so little connection with the views
