<HEAD>LE TOCSIN!
OR THE ADDRESS OF
CITIZEN FAMINE!</HEAD>
<P>KINGS! Ministers! Lords! Commons! and
Pressgangs!—By whatever denomination
ye are known, Oh oppressors! drop for a moment
the clamour of Corruption, and hearken to the voice
of Truth.</P>
<P>The past ages of the World have been the E∣pochs
of theory, the present is an Age of practice,
Men begin to act what they formerly thought; an
unaccountable impulse urges the Arm to perform
what the Heart dictates, and no sooner is Tyranny
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
known, than the unanimous consent of Nations
records it for destruction.</P>
<P>Beware, then; the arm of vengeance shall not be
torpid for ever! Man supports oppression as long as
his prejudices enable him, but when the increasing
Weight exceeds his strength, prejudice takes itself
away, and the oppression is tumbled to the earth;
you may make the Blind believe that there is no
Sun, or that it is not at present visible; but you
cannot perswade the awakened sight of Reason that
it is only a Farthing candle, Aristocratically lighted
up, to illumine and benefit a few.</P>
<P>When Bread is wanting, and when Men are scarce,
do not accuse Nature with sterility, do not libel
Humanity so much by asserting that destruction is
occasioned by the necessities of society; Society is
sufficient for itself, it requires no aid, no Crowned
Auxiliary, and it cannot be the cause of War or
Misery, unless some <HI>Extra</HI> Monarchy disjoints the
parts and disunites the members. War is the cause
of Famine, and Courts are the authors of War, they
write the History of man in letters of blood, and
Death is their Historian! they thin the ranks of
Life, they drive the Husbandman from the plough
to the camp, and when Corn becomes scarce be∣cause
the peasants cannot cultivate it; they exclaim
Nature has denied her increase, and men slaughter
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
one another. Let us consider for a moment, if
these things are true.</P>
<P>While a Commercial intercourse exists between
the Nations of the Earth, no scarcity can arise to
any nation, because the superfluity of one Country
will always supply the deficiency of another, this
commercial intercourse can only be impeded by the
machinations of Tyrants! Tyrants are therefore the
causes of Famine. Oh! ye oppressors of my coun∣try,
have you not violated the sacred rights of
social commerce, and have you not by that means
provoked a reciprocal injustice. If it was not e∣nough
to send our Brothers by thousands to their
graves, and to make the Fields of Flanders smoke
with the gore of our countrymen, surely it was an
unpardonable excess of cruely to invent a system
of starvation! at once to depopulate the earth, to
barrenize nature, and to invade those sacred rights
of commerce which have hitherto distributed the
effects of nature to all the Tenants of the Globe.</P>
<P>Thro' you, destructive wolves, our children cry
in vain for that sustenance, which the forsaken mo∣ther
is unable to give them; Thro' your arts, the
last patience of human nature is exhausted, and
while hunger impels the insulted Sons of poverty to
desperation, the ruffians of war, shoot them like
Dogs, and death finishes that long tale of lingering
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
misery, which you Tyrants first began: Heavens!
shall our existence be prolonged, only to make our
sufferings the medium of your prosperity and plea∣sure,
shall our scanty meals, and hard-earned mor∣sels
scarcely keep together the last remnants of a
weary being, that you may wallow in Luxury, and
tread with insolence upon the hands that feed you;
No! No! if humanity is to fall, let it fall the Heroe
of nature, and let the dagger of vengeance be the
trophy to celebrate the struggles of expiring Li∣berty,
and adorn the sepulchre of virtue.</P>
<P>This may be the language of passion, but it is also
the language of Truth; there are many truths dis∣agreeable
to Statesmen, and none more so than,
those which have an effect attatched to the non-ob∣servance
of them; patience appears to me a virtue,
in proportion as avarice and ambition are German
vices; Hanover is the Fountain-head of purgation,
and Johnny Bull can evidence the effects of the
German Spa. However let us remember, that,
tho' it is the <HI>interest</HI> of Hanover to be the receiver
of Gold, it is not his <HI>interest</HI> to take away our
sheaves of Corn, since in that case it may be our
<HI>interest</HI> to plant Hemp instead of Wheat.</P>
<P>Inform me great and awfull Justice! which is
guilty, the Monarchs, Ministers, and Priests who
advise destruction, and murder, and send our Corn
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
and Cattle to feed the Whiskered Slaves of Austria;
or the Peasant, Mechanic, or Laborer, who impel∣led
by Nature's appetites, snatches from the Con∣tractor
a morsel which they have not bought? who
great Justice! deserves most to suffer from the Mi∣litary
Assassins of the day? Justice points to the
Crown, to the Robe of Office, and the Mitre,
The Spade, the Anvil and the Loom are greater
ornaments to life,—the Children of Nature use
them,—and whatever Nature produces, is their
Heritage and Right.</P>
<P>It were well if your Red-coat Assassins would
cease to murder for you, for then your Tyranny
would cease to be. However the Soldier is not
the most faithful of your dogs, you feed him upon
hard Crusts! No sooner shall the People offer him
a better meal, then he will desert from your stand∣ard,
and unite with the People.—Already the army
is becomming enlightened; Gunpowder will soon
be a useless material, and the Soldier will shortly
be exalted from the state of a Slave into a Man.—Beware
of that day when the Cap of Liberty shall
be supported by those men, whom you now treat
as Slaves! it approaches, and Tyranny trembles
at the quickness of the step! Tyranny and Free∣dom
have engaged in a race; Tyranny which at first
gained upon humanity, thro' the violence of its
progress, now grows weary, every nerve is exhau∣sted,
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
and leaning on a broken Sword, it scarcely
pants along,—while Freedom a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mid the shouts of
Millions arives triumphant at the Goal.</P>
<P>If this is not warning sufficient to you, apply
your attention to the Vengeance which Public
misery is preparing to shower on your heads, look
at the scenes of sorrow and starvation, of which you
are the cause, and see the victims of Famine, whom
you have deprived of Bread and Cheese, feasting on
the ideas of future Justice.—Give them a Peace—Destroy
your Monopolies,—Reform your Senates,
Disband your Associations—Decline your Pensions,
and then hoping for better days, the insulted World
may relax its severity, and by comforting the exist∣ence
of others, you may perpetuate your own.</P>
<P>Whenever the thunder of human Justice is col∣lected
in the recess of human Sorrow, it is no par∣tial
rod erected on the edifice of Tyranny that can
divert the blow,—Man knows your guilt, he is sen∣sible
of the Oppression with which you goad him,
and he is preparing the Tribunal of Justice, to re∣tribute
his injuries,—Exert your caution, make use
of your Political Arithmetic and say if it is better
to multiply human Sorrows, and divide social con∣nections,
or to to reduce the sum of misery, and
cast up the general account of our Liberties and
Rights; consider well, with War, Famine and Op∣pression
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
—come Discord, Vengeance and Destruct∣ion.—with
Peace, Plenty and Principle,—come
Life, Wealth and Security. Reflect seriously, give
us BREAD, or the appetites of Nature will oblige
us to devour you? cease to Murder us with your
Military, or the Bayonet that slew the unfortunate
victims of Hunger and Poverty, may also peirce
the Flinty-heart of the wretch, whose being is the
abusé of life, and whose Tyranny is a Libel upon
the patience of MAN.</P>
