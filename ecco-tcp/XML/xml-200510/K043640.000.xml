<HEAD>THE
QUERIST, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Query I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">WHETHER there ever was, is,
or will be an industrious Nation
poor, or an idle, rich?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a People can be called
poor, where the common Sort are well fed,
cloathed, and lodged?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Drift and Aim of
every wise State should not be, to encourage
Industry in its Members? and whether those,
who employ neither Heads nor Hands for
the common Benefit, deserve not to be expel∣led
like Drones out of a well governed State?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the four Elements, and
Man's Labour therein, be not the true Source
of Wealth?</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
5. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Money be not only so
far useful, as it stirreth up Industry, enabling
Men mutually to participate the Fruits of
each others Labour?</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether any other Means, equal∣ly
conducing to excite and circulate the In∣dustry
of Mankind, may not be as useful as
Money?</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the real End and Aim of
Men be not Power? And whether he who
could have every Thing else at his Wish or
Will, would value Money?</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the public Aim in every
well govern'd State be not, that each Member,
according to his just Pretensions and Industry,
should have Power?</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Power be not referred to
Action; and whether Action doth not follow
Appetite or Will?</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Fashion doth not create
Appetites, and whether the prevailing Will of
a Nation is not the Fashion?</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Current of Industry
and Commerce be not determin'd by this pre∣vailing
Will?</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
12. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not owing to Cu∣stom
that most Fashions are agreeable?</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it may not concern the
Wisdom of the Legislature to interpose in the
making of Fashions; and not leave an Affair
of so great influence, to the management of
Women and Fops and Taylors and Vintners?</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether reasonable Fashions are
a greater restraint on Freedom than those which
are unreasonable?</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a general good Taste in
a People would not greatly conduce to their
thriving? And whether an uneducated Gen∣try
be not the greatest of national Evils?</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Customs and Fashions
do not supply the Place of Reason, in the
Vulgar of all Ranks? Whether, therefore,
it doth not very much import that they should
be wisely framed?</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the imitating those
Neighbours in our Fashions, to whom we
bear no likeness in our Circumstances, be
not one cause of Distress to this Nation?</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether frugal Fashions in the
upper Rank, and comfortable living in the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
lower, be not the Means to multiply Inha∣bitants?</P>
<P N="19">19. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the bulk of our Irish
Natives are not kept from thriving, by that
cynical Content in Dirt and Beggary, which
they possess to a Degree beyond any other
People in Christendom?</P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the creating of Wants
be not the likeliest way to produce Industry
in a People? And whether if our Peasants were
accustomed to eat Beef and wear Shoes they
would not be more Industrious?</P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether other Things being giv∣en,
as Climate, Soil, &amp;c. the Wealth be
not proportioned to the Industry, and this to
the Circulation of Credit, be the Credit cir∣culated
or transferred by what Marks or To∣kens
so ever?</P>
<P N="22">22. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether therefore less Money
swiftly circulating be not, in effect, equivalent
to more Money slowly circulating? Or whe∣ther
if the Circulation be reciprocally as the
Quantity of Coin, the Nation can be a Loser?</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Money is to be consider∣ed
as having an intrinsic Value, or as being a
Commodity, a Standard, a Measure, or a
Pledge, as is variously suggested by Writers?
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
And whether the true Idea of Money, as
such, be not altogether that of a Ticket or
Counter?</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Value or Price of
Things, be not a compounded Proportion, di∣rectly
as the Demand, and reciprocally as the
Plenty?</P>
<P N="25">25. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Terms <HI>Crown, Li∣vre,</HI>
<HI>Pound Sterling,</HI> &amp;c. are not to be con∣sidered
as Exponents or Denominations of
such Proportion? and whether Gold, Silver,
and Paper, are not Tickets or Counters for
Reckoning, Recording, and Transferring
thereof?</P>
<P N="26">26. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Denominations be∣ing
retained, although the Bullion were gone,
Things might not nevertheless be rated, bought
and sold, Industry promoted, and a Circula∣tion
of Commerce maintained?</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether an equal raising of all
Sorts of Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin can
have any effect in bringing Money into the
Kingdom? And whether altering the Propor∣tions
between the several Sorts can have any
other effect, but multiplying one Kind and
lessening another, without any increase of the
Sum total?</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
28. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether arbitrary changing the
Denomination of Coin, be not a public
Cheat?</P>
<P N="29">29. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether nevertheless the Damage
would be very considerable, if by Degrees our
Money were brought back to the English Va∣lue,
there to rest for ever?</P>
<P N="30">30. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the English Crown did
not formerly pass with us for six Shillings?
And what Inconvenience ensued to the Public,
upon its Reduction to the present Value, and
whether what hath been may not be?</P>
<P N="31">31. <HI>Qu.</HI> What makes a wealthy People?
And whether Mines of Gold and Silver are
capable of doing this? Whether Negroes
amidst the Gold Sands of Afric are not poor
and destitute?</P>
<P N="32">32. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Vertue in
Gold or Silver, other than as they set People
at Work, or create Industry?</P>
<P N="33">33. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not the Opinion
or Will of the People, exciting them to In∣dustry,
that truly enricheth a Nation? And
whether this doth not principally depend on
the Means for counting, transferring and pre∣serving
Power, that is, property of all Kinds?</P>
<P N="34"><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
34. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if there was no Silver
in the Kingdom, our Trade might not never∣theless
supply Bills of Exchange, sufficient to
answer the Demands of Absentees in England
or elsewhere?</P>
<P N="35">35. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether current Bank Notes may
not be deemed Money? And whether they
are not actually the greater part of the Money
of this Kingdom?</P>
<P N="36">36. <HI>Qu.</HI> Provided the Wheels move, whe∣ther
it is not the same Thing, as to the effect
of the Machine, be this done by the Force of
Wind or Water or Animals?</P>
<P N="37">37. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Power to command the
Industry of others be not real Wealth? And
whether Money be not in Truth, Tickets or
Tokens for conveying and recording such
Power, and whether it be of great Consequence
what Materials the Tickets are made of?</P>
<P N="38">38. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Trade, either foreign
or domestick, be in Truth any more than this
Commerce of Industry?</P>
<P N="39">39. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether to promote, transfer,
and secure this Commerce, and this Property
in human Labour, or, in other Words, this
Power, be not the sole Means of enriching a
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
People, and how far this may be done inde∣pendently
of Gold and Silver?</P>
<P N="40">40. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it were not wrong to
suppose Land it self to be Wealth? And whe∣ther
the Industry of the People is not first to
be consider'd, as that which constitutes Wealth,
which makes even Land and Silver to be
Wealth, neither of which would have any
Value, but as Means and Motives to Indu∣stry?</P>
<P N="41">41. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether in the Wastes of Ame∣rica
a Man might not possess twenty Miles
square of Land, and yet want his Dinner or
a Coat to his Back?</P>
<P N="42">42. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a fertile Land, and the
Industry of its Inhabitants, would not prove
inexhaustable Funds of real Wealth, be the
Counters for conveying and recording thereof
what you will, Paper, Gold, or Silver?</P>
<P N="43">43. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a single Hint be suffi∣cient
to overcome a Prejudice? And whether
even obvious Truths will not sometimes bear
repeating?</P>
<P N="44">44. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if human Labour be the
true source of Wealth, it doth not follow that
Idleness should of all things be discourag'd in
a wise State?</P>
<P N="45"><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
45. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether even Gold or Silver, if
they should lessen the Industry of its Inhabi∣tants,
would not be ruinous to a Country?
And whether Spain be not an Instance of
this?</P>
<P N="46">46. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Opinion of Men,
and their Industry consequent thereupon, be
not the true Wealth of Holland, and not the
Silver supposed to be deposited in the Bank at
Amsterdam?</P>
<P N="47">47. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there is in Truth any
such Treasure lying dead? And whether it be
of great consequence to the Public, that it
should be real rather than notional?</P>
<P N="48">48. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether in order to understand
the true Nature of Wealth and Commerce,
it would not be right to consider a Ship's
Crew cast upon a desert Island, and by De∣grees
forming themselves to Business and ci∣vil
Life; while Industry begot Credit, and
Credit moved to Industry?</P>
<P N="49">49. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether such Men would not
all set themselves to Work? Whether they
would not subsist by the mutual Participation
of each others Industry? Whether when one
Man had in his Way procured more than
he could consume, he would not exchange
his Superfluities to supply his Wants? Whe∣ther
this must not produce Credit? Whether
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
to facilitate these Conveyances, to record and
circulate this Credit, they would not soon
agree on certain Tallies, Tokens, Tickets or
Counters?</P>
<P N="50">50. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Reflection in the better
Sort might not soon remedy our Evils? And
whether our real Defect be not a wrong Way
of Thinking?</P>
<P N="51">51. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it would not be an un∣happy
Turn in our Gentlemen, if they should
take more Thought to create an Interest to
themselves in this or that County or Borough,
than to promote the real Interest of their
Country?</P>
<P N="52">52. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not a Bull to call
that making an Interest, whereby a Man
spendeth much and gaineth nothing?</P>
<P N="53">53. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if a Man builds a House
he doth not in the first Place provide a Plan
which governs his Work? and shall the Pub∣lic
act without an End, a View, a Plan?</P>
<P N="54">54. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether by how much the less
particular Folk think for themselves, the
Public be not so much the more obliged to
think for them?</P>
<P N="55">55. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Cunning be not one
thing and good Sense another? And whether
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
a cunning Tradesman doth not stand in his
own Light?</P>
<P N="56">56. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether small Gains be not the
way to great Profit? And if our Tradesmen
are Beggars, whether they may not thank
themselves for it?</P>
<P N="57">57. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether some way might not be
found for making Criminals useful in Public
Works, instead of sending them either to
America, or to the other World?</P>
<P N="58">58. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether we may not, as well as
other Nations, contrive Employment for
them? And whether Servitude, Chains and
hard Labour, for a term of Years, would not
be a more discouraging, as well as a more
adequate Punishment for Felons, than even
Death itself.</P>
<P N="59">59. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there are not such Things
in Holland as bettering Houses for bringing
young Gentlemen to Order? And whether
such an Institution might be useless among
us?</P>
<P N="60">60. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be true, that the Poor
in Holland have no Resource but their own
Labour, and yet there are no Beggars in their
Streets?</P>
<P N="61"><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
61. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether he whose Luxury con∣sumeth
foreign Products, and whose Industry
produceth nothing domestic to Exchange for
them, is not so far forth injurious to his Coun∣try?</P>
<P N="62">62. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, consequently, the fine
Gentlemen, whose Employment is only to
dress, drink, and play, be not a public Nui∣sance?</P>
<P N="63">63. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Necessity is not to be
hearkened to before Convenience, and Conve∣nience
before Luxury?</P>
<P N="64">64. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether to provide plentifully
for the Poor, be not feeding the Root, the
Substance whereof will shoot upwards into
the Branches, and cause the Top to flourish?</P>
<P N="65">65. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Instance of
a State wherein the People, living neatly and
plentifully, did not aspire to Wealth?</P>
<P N="66">66. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Nastiness and Beggary
do not, on the contrary, extinguish all such
Ambition, making Men listless, helpless,
and slothful?</P>
<P N="67">67. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a Country inhabited by
People well fed, cloathed, and lodged, would
not become every Day more populous? And
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
whether a numerous Stock of People in such
Circumstances would not constitute a flourish∣ing
Nation; and how far the Product of our
own Country may suffice for the compassing
of this End?</P>
<P N="68">68. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a People, who had pro∣vided
themselves with the Necessaries of Life
in good Plenty, would not soon extend their
Industry to new Arts and new Branches of
Commerce?</P>
<P N="69">69. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether those same Manufactures
which England imports from other Countries
may not be admitted from Ireland? And if
so whether Lace, Carpets, and Tapestry,
three considerable Articles of English Impor∣tation,
might not find Encouragment in Ire∣land?
And whether an Academy for De∣sign
might not greatly conduce to the perfect∣ing
those Manufactures among us?</P>
<P N="70">70. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether France and Flanders
could have drawn so much Money from Eng∣land,
for figured Silks, Lace, and Tapestry,
if they had not had Academies for Designing?</P>
<P N="71">71. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether when a Room was once
prepared, and Models in Plaister of Paris, the
Annual Expence of such an Academy need
stand the Public in above two hundred Pounds
a Year?</P>
<P N="72"><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
72. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether our Linen Manufacture
would not find the Benefit of this Institution?
And whether there be any Thing that makes
us fall short of the Dutch, in Damasks, Dia∣pers,
and printed Linen but our Ignorance in
Design?</P>
<P N="73">73. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether those Specimens of our
own Manufacture, hung up in a certain pub∣lic
Place, do not sufficiently declare such our
Ignorance? And whether for the Honour of
the Nation they ought not to be removed?</P>
<P N="74">74. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether those, who may slight
this Affair as notional, have sufficiently consi∣dered
the extensive use of the Art of Design,
and its Influence in most Trades and Manu∣factures
wherein the Forms of Things are of∣ten
more regarded than the Materials?</P>
<P N="75">75. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Art sooner
learned than that of making Carpets? And
whether our Women with little Time and
Pains may not make more beautiful Carpets
than those imported from Turky? And whe∣ther
this Branch of the Woollen Manufacture
be not open to us? <HI>See Qu.</HI> 69.</P>
<P N="76">76. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether human Industry can
produce, from such cheap Materials, a Manu∣facture
of so great Value, by any other Art
than by those of Sculpture and Painting?</P>
<P N="77"><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
77. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Pictures and Statues are
not in Fact so much Treasure? And whether
Rome and Florence would not be poor Towns
without them?</P>
<P N="78">78. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether they do not bring ready
Money as well as Jewels? Whether in Italy
Debts are not paid and Children portioned
with them, as with Gold and Silver?</P>
<P N="79">79. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it would not be more
prudent, to strike out and exert ourselves in
permitted Branches of Trade, than to fold
our Hands and repine, that we are not allow∣ed
the Woollen?</P>
<P N="80">80. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be true, that two Mil∣lions
are yearly expended by England in fo∣reign
Lace and Linnen?</P>
<P N="81">81. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether immense Sums are not
drawn yearly into the northern Countries, for
supplying the British Navy with Hempen Ma∣nufactures?</P>
<P N="82">82. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Thing more
profitable than Hemp? And whether there
should not be great Premiums for encourag∣ing
our Hempen Trade; what Advantages
may not Great Britain make of a Country
where Land and Labour are so cheap?</P>
<P N="83"><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
83. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Ireland alone might not
raise Hemp sufficient for the British Navy?
And whether it would not be vain to expect
this from the British Colonies in America,
where Hands are so scarce and Labour so ex∣cessively
dear?</P>
<P N="84">84. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if our own People want
Will or Capacity for such an Attempt, it
might not be worth while for some under∣taking
Spirits in England to make Settlements,
and raise Hemp in the Counties of Clare and
Limeric, than which perhaps there is not fit∣ter
Land in the World for that Purpose? And
whether both Nations would not find their
Advantage therein?</P>
<P N="85">85. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if all the idle Hands in
this Kingdom were employed on Hemp and
Linen, we might not find sufficient Vent for
these Manufactures?</P>
<P N="86">86. <HI>Qu.</HI> How far it may be in our own
Power to better our Affairs, without inter∣fering
with our Neighbours?</P>
<P N="87">87. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Prohibition of our
Woollen Trade ought not naturally to put us
on other Methods, which give no Jealousy?</P>
<P N="88">88. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Paper be not a valuable
Article of Commerce? And whether it be not
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
true that one single Bookseller in London,
yearly expends above four thousand Pounds,
in that foreign Commodity?</P>
<P N="89">89. <HI>Qu.</HI> How it comes to pass that the
Venetians and Genoese, who wear so much
less Linen, and so much worse than we do,
should yet make very good Paper, and in great
quantity, while we make very little and very
bad?</P>
<P N="90">90. <HI>Qu.</HI> How long it will be before my
Countrymen find out, that it is worth while
to spend a penny in order to get a groat?</P>
<P N="91">91. <HI>Qu.</HI> If all the Land were tilled that
is fit for Tillage, and all that sowed with
Hemp, and Flax, that is fit for raising them,
whether we should have much Sheep-Walk
beyond what was sufficient to supply the Ne∣cessities
of the Kingdom?</P>
<P N="92">92. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether other Countries have not
flourished without the Woollen Trade?</P>
<P N="93">93. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not a sure Sign or
Effect of a Countries thriving, to see it well
cultivated, and full of Inhabitants? And, if
so, whether a great Quantity of Sheep-Walk,
be not ruinous to a Country, rendering it
Waste and thinly Inhabited?</P>
<P N="94"><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
94. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Employing so much
of our Land under Sheep, be not in fact an
Irish Bull?</P>
<P N="95">95. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether our hankering after the
Woollen Trade, be not the true and only Rea∣son,
which hath created a Jealousy in England,
towards Ireland? And whether any Thing
can hurt us more than such a Jealousy?</P>
<P N="96">96. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not the true Interest
of both Nations, to become one People? And
whether either be sufficiently apprized of this?</P>
<P N="97">97. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the upper Part of this
People are not truly English, by Blood, Lan∣guage,
Religion, Manners, Inclination, and
Interest?</P>
<P N="98">98. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether we are not as much En∣glishmen,
as the Children of old Romans
born in Britain, were still Romans?</P>
<P N="99">99. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not our true Interest,
not to interfere with them; and, in every
other Case, whether it be not their true Interest
to befriend us?</P>
<P N="100">100. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a Mint in Ireland, might
not be of great Convenience to the Kingdom,
and whether it could be attended with any
possible Inconvenience to great Britain? And
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
whether there were not Mints in Naples and
in Sicily, when those Kingdoms were Provin∣ces
to Spain or the House of Austria?</P>
<P N="101">101. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether any Thing can be
more ridiculous, than for the North of Ire∣land
to be Jealous of a Linen Manufacture
in the South?</P>
<P N="102">102. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the County of Tipera∣ry
be not much better Land than the County
of Armagh; and yet whether the latter is not
much better improved and inhabited than the
former?</P>
<P N="103">103. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether every Landlord in the
Kingdom doth not know the Cause of this?
And yet how few are the better for such their
Knowledge?</P>
<P N="104">104. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether large Farms under few
Hands, or small ones under many, are like∣ly
to be made most of? And whether Flax
and Tillage do not naturally multiply Hands,
and divide Land into small Holdings and well
improved?</P>
<P N="105">105. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, as our Exports are
lessened, we ought not to lessen our Imports?
And whether these will not be lessened as
our Demands, and these as our Wants, and
these as our Customs or Fashions? Of how
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
great Consequence therefore are Fashions to
the Public? <HI>See Qu.</HI> 10, 11, 16.</P>
<P N="106">106. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it would not be more
reasonable to mend our State than to com∣plain
of it; and how far this may be in our
own Power?</P>
<P N="107">107. <HI>Qu.</HI> What the Nation gains by those
who live in Ireland upon the Produce of fo∣reign
Countries?</P>
<P N="108">108. <HI>Qu.</HI> How far the Vanity of our La∣dies
in dressing, and of our Gentlemen in
drinking, contributes to the general Misery of
the People?</P>
<P N="109">109. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Nations as wise and
opulent as ours, have not made sumptuary
Laws; and what hinders us from doing the
same?</P>
<P N="110">110. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether those, who drink fo∣reign
Liquors and deck Themselves and their
Families with foreign Ornaments, are not so
far forth to be reckon'd Absentees?</P>
<P N="111">111. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether as our Trade is limit∣ed,
we ought not to limit our Expences; and
whether this be not the natural and obvious
Remedy?</P>
<P N="112"><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
112. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Dirt, and Famine,
and Nakedness of the Bulk of our People,
might not be remedied even although we had
no foreign Trade? And whether this should
not be our first Care, and whether, if this were
once provided for, the Conveniencies of the
Rich would not soon follow?</P>
<P N="113">113. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether comfortable living doth
not produce Wants, and Wants Industry,
and Industry Wealth? <HI>See Qu.</HI> 20, 65.</P>
<P N="114">114. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there is not a great dif∣ference

the Attention of the Public?</P>
<P N="229">229. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether that, which increaseth
the Stock of a Nation, be not a Means of in∣creasing
its Trade? And whether that, which

<P N="255">255. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether by Degrees, as Business

our Manufactures would not flourish; and as

Danger from trusting a national Bank, with

which it shall be Felony to counterfeit, to re∣ceive
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
Goods on Loans, to purchase Lands, to
fell also or alienate them, and to deal in Bills
of Exchange, when these Powers are no other
than have been trusted for many Years with
the Bank of England, although in Truth but
a private Bank? <HI>See Qu.</HI> 222.</P>
<P N="272">272. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Objection from
Monopolies and an over-growth of Power,
which are made against private Banks, can
possibly hold against a national one?</P>
<P N="273">273. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Banks raised by private
Subscription, would be as advantageous to the
Public, as to the Subscribers? And whether
Risques and Frauds might not be more justly
apprehended from them?</P>
<P N="274">274. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the evil Effects, which,
of late Years, have attended Paper-Money
and Credit in Europe, did not spring from
Subscriptions, Shares, Dividends, Stock-job∣bing?</P>
<P N="275">275 <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether great Evils attending
Paper-Money in the British Plantations of
America have not sprung from the over-rating
their Lands, and issuing Paper without Dis∣cretion,

thus sacrificing the Public to their private Be∣nefit?
And whether a little Sense and Honesty
might not easily prevent all such Inconveni∣encies?

to judge, that will not be at the Pains to di∣stinguish?</P>
<P N="281">281. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be not a wide
Difference, between the Profits going to aug∣ment
the national Stock, and being divided
among private Sharers? And whether, in the

<P N="282">282. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it must not be ruinous
for a Nation to sit down to game, be it with
Silver or with Paper?</P>
<P N="283">283. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, therefore, the circu∣lating
Paper, in the late ruinous Schemes of
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
France and England, was the true Evil, and
not rather the circulating thereof without In∣dustry;
And whether the Bank of Amster∣dam,
where Industry had been for so many
Years subsisted, and circulated by Transfers
on Paper, doth not clearly decide this Point?</P>
<P N="284">284. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there are not to be seen
in America fair Towns, wherein the People
are well lodged, fed, and cloathed, without
a Beggar in their Streets, although there be
not one Grain of Gold or Silver current among
them?</P>
<P N="285">285. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether these People do not
exercise all Arts and Trades, build Ships, and
navigate them to all Parts of the World,
purchase Lands, till and reap the Fruits of
them, buy and sell, educate and provide for
their Children? Whether they do not even
indulge themselves in foreign Vanities?</P>
<P N="286">286. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, whatever Inconveni∣encies
those People may have incurred, from
not observing either Rules or Bounds in their
Paper-Money, yet it be not certain that they
are in a more flourishing Condition, have
larger and better built Towns, more Plenty,
more Industry, more Arts and Civility, and
a more extensive Commerce, than when they
had Gold and Silver current among them?</P>
<P N="287">287. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a View of the ruinous
Effects of absurd Schemes, and Credit misma∣naged,
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
so as to produce Gaming and Madness
instead of Industry, can be any just Objection
against a national Bank, calculated purely to
promote Industry?</P>
<P N="288">288. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a Scheme for the Wel∣fare
of this Nation should not take in the
whole Inhabitants? And whether it be not a
vain Attempt, to project the flourishing of
our Protestant Gentry, exclusive of the Bulk
of the Natives?</P>
<P N="289">289. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, therefore, it doth not
greatly concern the State, that our Irish Na∣tives
should be converted, and the whole Na∣tion
united in the same Religion, the same
allegiance, and the same Interest? And how
this may most probably be effected?</P>
<P N="290">290. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether an Oath, testifying Al∣legiance
to the King and disclaiming the
Pope's Authority in Temporals, may not be
justly required of the Roman Catholicks?
And whether, in common Prudence or Po∣licy,
any Priest should be tolerated who refu∣seth
to take it?</P>
<P N="291">291. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there have not been
Popish Recusants? And, if so, whether it
would be right to object against the foregoing
Oath, that all would take it, and none think
themselves bound by it?</P>
<P N="292">292. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether those of the Church of
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
Rome, in converting the Moors of Spain or
the Protestants of France, have not set us an
Example which might justify a similar Treat∣ment
of themselves, if the Laws of Christia∣nity
allowed thereof?</P>
<P N="293">293. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether compelling Men to a
Profession of Faith is not the worst Thing in
Popery, and, consequently, whether to co∣py
after the Church of Rome therein, were
not to become Papists ourselves in the worst
Sense?</P>
<P N="294">294. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether nevertheless we may not
imitate the Church of Rome, in certain Pla∣ces,
where Jews are tolerated, by obliging our
Irish Papists, at stated Times, to hear Prote∣stant
Sermons? And whether this would not
make Missionaries in the Irish Tongue useful?</P>
<P N="295">295. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the mere Act of hear∣ing,
without making any Profession of Faith,
or joining in any Part of Worship, be a Reli∣gious
Act? And, consequently, whether
their being obliged to hear, may not consist
with the Toleration of Roman Catholics?</P>
<P N="296">296. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, if penal Laws should
be thought Oppressive, we may not at least
be allowed to give Premiums? And, whether
it would be wrong, if the Public encouraged
Popish Families to become Hearers, by pay∣ing
their Hearth-Money for them?</P>
<P N="297"><PB N="56" REF="55"/>
297. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether in granting Toleration,
we ought not to distinguish between Doctrines
purely Religious and such as affect the State?</P>
<P N="298">298. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Case be not very
different, in regard to a Man who only eats
Fish on Fridays, says his Prayers in Latin,
or believes Transubstantiation, and one who
professeth in Temporals a Subjection to fo∣reign
Powers, who holdeth himself absolved
from all Obedience to his natural Prince and
the Laws of his Country? who is even persua∣ded,
it may be Meritorious to destroy the
Powers that are?</P>
<P N="299">299. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, therefore, a Distinc∣tion
should not be made between mere Pa∣pists
and Recusants? And whether the latter
can expect the same Protection from the Go∣vernment
as the former?</P>
<P N="300">300. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether our Papists in this King∣dom
can complain, if they are allowed to be
as much Papists, as the Subjects of France or
of the Empire?</P>
<P N="301">301. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there is any such Thing
as a Body of Inhabitants, in any Popish Coun∣try
under the Sun, that profess an absolute
Submission to the Pope's Orders in Matters of
an indifferent Nature, or that in such Points
do not think it their Duty, to obey the civil
Government?</P>
<P N="302"><PB N="57" REF="56"/>
302. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether since the Peace of Ut∣recht,
Mass was not celebrated, and the Sa∣craments
administer'd in divers Diocese's of
Sicily, notwithstanding the Pope's interdict?</P>
<P N="303">303. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether every Plea of Consci∣ence
is to be regarded? Whether, for Instance,
the German Anabaptists, Levellers, or fifth
Monarchy Men would be tolerated on that
Pretence?</P>
<P N="304">304. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Popish Children bred
in Charity Schools, when bound out in Ap∣prentiship
to Protestant Masters, do generally
continue Protestants?</P>
<P N="305">305. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a Sum, which would
go but a little Way towards erecting Hospi∣tals
for maintaining and educating the Chil∣dren
of the Native Irish, might not go far in
binding them out Apprentices to Protestant
Masters, for Husbandry, useful Trades, and
the service of Families?</P>
<P N="306">306. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if the Parents are over∣looked,
there can be any great Hopes of Suc∣cess
in converting the Children?</P>
<P N="307">307. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Instance,
of a People's being converted in a Christian
Sense, otherwise than by preaching to them
and instructing them in their own Language?</P>
<P N="308">308. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Catechists in the Irish
Tongue may not easily be procured and sub∣sisted?
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
And whether this would not be the
most practicable Means for converting the Na∣tives?</P>
<P N="309">309. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not of great Ad∣vantage
to the Church of Rome, that she
hath Clergy suited to all Ranks of Men, in
gradual Subordination from Cardinals down
to Mendicants?</P>
<P N="310">310. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether her numerous poor
Clergy are not very useful in Missions, and
of much influence with the People?</P>
<P N="311">311. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether in defect of able Missi∣onaries,
Persons conversant in low Life, and
speaking the Irish Tongue, if well instructed
in the first Principles of Religion and in the
Popish Controversy, though for the rest on a
Level with Parish Clerks, or the Schoolma∣sters
of Charity Schools, may not be fit to
mix with and bring over our poor illiterate
Natives, to the established Church? Whether
it is not to be wished that some Parts of our
Liturgy and Homilies were publickly read in
the Irish Language? And whether, in these
Views, it may not be right to breed up some
of the better sort of Children in the Charity
Schools and qualify them for Missionaries,
Catechists and Readers?</P>
<P N="312">312. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Nation of
Men governed by Reason? And yet, if there
was not, whether this would be a good Ar∣gument
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
against the use of Reason in public
Affairs?</P>
<P N="313">313. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, as others have suppos∣ed
an Atlantis or Eutopia, we also may not
suppose an Hyperborean Island inhabited by
reasonable Creatures?</P>
<P N="314">314. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether an indifferent Person,
who looks into all Hands, may not be a bet∣ter
Judge of the Play than a Party who sees
only his own?</P>
<P N="315">315. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether one, whose End is to
make his Country-Men think, may not gain
his End, even though they should not think
as he doth?</P>
<P N="316">316. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether he, who only asks, As∣serts?
And whether any Man can fairly con∣fute
the Querist?</P>
<P N="317">317. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Interest of a Part
