<HEAD>PART I. Of the PROPRIETY of ACTION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Of SYMPATHY.</HEAD>
<P>HOW selfish soever man may be sup∣posed, there are evidently some prin∣ciples in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the plea∣sure of seeing it. Of this kind is pity or compassion, the emotion which we feel for the misery of others, when we either see it, or are made to conceive it in a very lively manner. That we often de∣rive sorrow from the sorrow of others is too obvious to require any instances to prove it; for this sentiment, like all the other original passions of human nature,
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
is by no means confined to the virtuous and humane, though they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite sensi∣bility. The greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of society, is not altogether without it.</P>
<P>As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form no idea of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what we our∣selves should feel in the like situation. Though our brother is upon the rack, as long as we are at our ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. They never did and never can carry us beyond our own persons, and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations. Neither can that faculty help us to this any other way, than by representing to us what would be our own if we were in his case. It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of his, which our imaginations copy. By the imagination we place ourselves in his situation, we conceive ourselves enduring all the same torments, we enter as it were into his body and become in some measure him, and
<PB N="3" REF="14" MS="y"/>
thence form some idea of his sensations, and even feel something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike them. His agonies, when they are thus brought home to ourselves, when we have thus adopted and made them our own, begin at last to affect us, and we then tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels. For as to be in pain or distress of any kind excites the most exces∣sive sorrow, so to conceive or to imagine that we are in it, excites some degree of the same emotion, in proportion to the vivacity or dulness of the conception.</P>
<P>That this is the source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of others, that it is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer, that we come either to conceive or to be affected by what he feels, may be demonstrated by many obvious obser∣vations, if it should not be thought suf∣ficiently evident of itself. When we see a stroke aimed and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person, we natu∣rally shrink and draw back our own leg or our own arm; and when it does fall, we feel it in some measure, and are hurt by it as well as the sufferer. The mob, when they
<PB N="4" REF="15" MS="y"/>
are gazing at a dancer on the slack rope, naturally writhe and twist and balance their own bodies, as they see him do, and as they feel that they themselves must do in his situation. Persons of delicate fibres and a weak constitution of body, complain that in looking on the sores and ulcers that are exposed by beggars in the streets, they are apt to feel an itching or uneasy sensation in the correspondent part of their own bodies. The horror which they con∣ceive at the misery of those wretches af∣fects that particular part in themselves more than any other; because that hor∣ror arises from conceiving what they them∣selves would suffer, if they really were the wretches whom they are looking upon, and if that particular part in themselves was actually affected in the same miser∣able manner. The very force of this conception is sufficient, in their feeble frames, to produce that itching or uneasy sensation complained of. Men of the most robust make, observe that in looking up∣on sore eyes they often feel a very sensible soreness in their own, which proceeds from the same reason; that organ being in the strongest man more delicate than
<PB N="5" REF="16" MS="y"/>
any other part of the body is in the weakest.</P>
<P>Neither is it those circumstances only, which create pain or sorrow, that call forth our fellow-feeling. Whatever is the passion which arises from any object in the person principally concerned, an analagous emotion springs up, at the thought of his situation, in the breast of every attentive spectator. Our joy for the deliverance of those heroes of tragedy or romance who interest us, is as sin∣cere as our grief for their distress, and our fellow-feeling with their misery is not more real than that with their happiness. We enter into their gratitude towards those faithful friends who did not desert them in their difficulties; and we heartily go along with their resentment against those perfidious traitors who injured, abandon∣ed, or deceived them. In every passion of which the mind of man is susceptible, the emotions of the by-stander always correspond to what, by bringing the case home to himself, he imagines, should be the sentiments of the sufferer.</P>
<P>Pity and compassion are words appro∣priated to signify our fellow-feeling with
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
the sorrow of others. Sympathy, though its meaning was, perhaps, originally the same, may now, however, without much impropriety, be made use of to denote our fellow-feeling with any passion what∣ever.</P>
<P>Upon some occasions sympathy may seem to arise meerly from the view of a certain emotion in another person. The passions, upon some occasions, may seem to be transfused from one man to an∣other, instantaneously, and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the person principally concerned. Grief and joy, for example, strongly expressed in the look and gestures of any one, at once affect the spectator with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion. A smiling face is, to every body that sees it, a chearful object; as a sorrowful coun∣tenance, on the other hand, is a melan∣choly one.</P>
<P>This, however, does not hold univer∣sally with regard to every passion. There are some of which the expressions excite no sort of sympathy, but before we are acquainted with what gave occasion to them, serve rather to disgust and provoke
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
us against them. The furious behaviour of an angry man is more likely to exaspe∣rate us against himself than against his ene∣mies. As we are unacquainted with his provocation, we cannot bring his case home to ourselves, nor conceive any thing like the passions which it excites. But we plainly see what is the situation of those with whom he is angry, and to what vio∣lence they may be exposed from so en∣raged an adversary. We readily, there∣fore, sympathize with their fear or resent∣ment, and are immediately disposed to take party against the man from whom they appear to be in so much danger.</P>
<P>If the very appearances of grief and joy inspire us with some degree of the like emotions, it is because they suggest to us the general idea of some good or bad fortune that has befallen the person in whom we observe them: and in these passions this is sufficient to have some little influence upon us. The effects of grief and joy terminate in the person who feels those emotions, of which the expressions do not, like those of resent∣ment, suggest to us the idea of any other person for whom we are concerned, and
<PB N="8" REF="19" MS="y"/>
whose interests are opposite to his. The general idea of good or bad fortune, therefore, creates some concern for the person who has met with it, but the general idea of provocation excites no sympathy with the anger of the man who has received it. Nature, it seems, teaches us to be more averse to enter in∣to this passion, and, till informed of its cause, to be disposed rather to take part against it.</P>
<P>Even our sympathy with the grief or joy of another, before we are informed of the cause of either, is always extreme∣ly imperfect. General lamentations, which express nothing but the anguish of the sufferer, create rather a curiosity to en∣quire into his situation, along with some disposition to sympathize with him, than any actual sympathy that is very sensible. The first question that we ask is, What has befallen you? 'Till this be answered, tho' we are uneasy both from the vague idea of his misfortune, and still more from torturing ourselves with conjectures about what it may be, yet our fellow-feeling is not very considerable.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="20" MS="y"/>Sympathy, therefore, does not arise so much from the view of the passion, as from that of the situation which excites it. We sometimes feel for another, a passion of which he himself seems to be altogether incapable; because when we put ourselves in his case, that passion arises in our breast from the imagination, though it does not in his from the re∣ality. We blush for the impudence and rudeness of another, though he himself appears to have no sense of the impro∣priety of his own behaviour; because we cannot help feeling with what confusion we ourselves should be covered, had we behaved in so absurd a manner.</P>
<P>Of all the calamities to which the con∣dition of mortality exposes mankind, the loss of reason appears, to those who have the least spark of humanity, by far the most dreadful, and they behold that last stage of human wretchedness with deeper commiseration than any other. But the poor wretch, who is in it, laughs and sings perhaps, and is altogether insensible of his own misery. The anguish which humanity feels, therefore, at the sight of such an object, cannot be the reflection
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
of any sentiment of the sufferer. The compassion of the spectator must arise altogether from the consideration of what he himself would feel if he was reduced to the same unhappy situation, and, what perhaps is impossible, was at the same time able to regard it with his present reason and judgment.</P>
<P>What are the pangs of a mother when she hears the moanings of her infant that during the agony of disease cannot express what it feels? In her idea of what it suf∣fers, she joins, to its real helplessness, her own consciousness of that helplessness, and her own terrors for the unknown conse∣quences of its disorder; and out of all these forms, for her own sorrow, the most complete image of misery and distress. The infant, however, feels only the un∣easiness of the present instant, which can never be great. With regard to the fu∣ture it is perfectly secure, and in its thought∣lessness and want of foresight possesses an antidote against fear and anxiety, the great tormentors of the human breast, from which reason and philosophy will in vain attempt to defend it when it grows up to a man.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22"/>We sympathize even with the dead, and overlooking what is of real impor∣tance in their situation, that awful futu∣rity which awaits them, we are chiefly af∣fected by those circumstances which strike our senses, but can have no influence upon their happiness. It is miserable, we think, to be deprived of the light of the sun; to be shut out from life and conversation; to be laid in the cold grave a prey to corruption and the reptiles of the earth; to be no more thought of in this world, but to be obliterated in a little time from the affections and almost from the me∣mory of their dearest friends and relations. Surely, we imagine, we can never feel too much for those who have suffered so dread∣ful a calamity. The tribute of our fellow-feeling seems doubly due to them now when they are in danger of being forgot by every body: and, by the vain honours which we pay to their memory, we endea∣vour, for our own misery, artificially to keep alive our melancholy remembrance of their misfortune. That our sympathy can afford them no consolation seems to be an addition to their calamity; and to think that all we can do is unavailing,
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
and that, what alleviates all other distress, the regret, the love and the lamentation of their friends, can yield no comfort to them, serves only to exasperate our sense of their misery. The happiness of the dead, however, most assuredly, is affected by none of these circumstances; nor is it the thought of these things which can ever disturb the security of their repose. The idea of that dreary and endless melancholy, which the fancy naturally ascribes to their condition, arises altogether from our join∣ing to the change which has been pro∣duced upon them, our own consciousness of that change, from our putting ourselves in their situation, and from our lodging, if I may be allowed to say so, our own living souls in their inanimated bodies, and thence conceiving what would be our emotions in this case. It is this very illu∣sion of the imagination which renders the foresight of our own dissolution so terrible to us, and the idea of those circumstances, which undoubtedly can give us no pain when we are dead, makes us miserable while we are alive. And from thence arises one of the most important prin∣ciples in human nature, the dread of death,
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
the great poison to the happiness, but the great restraint upon the injustice of mankind, which, while it afflicts and mor∣tifies the individual, guards and protects the society.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the sentiment by which we ap∣prove or disapprove of the pas∣sions and affections of other men, as suitable or unsuitable to their objects.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the pleasure of mutual SYMPATHY.</HEAD>
<P>BUT whatever may be the cause of sympathy, or however it may be excited, nothing pleases us more than to observe in other men a fellow-feeling with all the emotions of our own breast; nor are we ever so much shocked as by the appearance of the contrary. Those who are fond of deducing all our sen∣timents from certain refinements of self-love, think themselves at no loss to ac∣count, according to their own principles, both for this pleasure and this pain. Man, say they, conscious of his own weakness
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
and of the need which he has for the as∣sistance of others, rejoices whenever he observes that they adopt his own passions, because he is then assured of that assist∣ance; and grieves whenever he observes the contrary, because he is then assured of their opposition: But both the pleasure and the pain are always felt so instantaneously, and often upon such frivolous occasions, that it seems evident that neither of them can be derived from any such self-interest∣ed consideration. A man is mortified when, after having endeavoured to divert the company, he looks round and sees that no-body laughs at his jests but himself. On the contrary, the mirth of the company is highly agreeable to him, and he re∣gards this correspondence of their senti∣ments with his own as the greatest ap∣plause.</P>
<P>Neither does his pleasure seem to arise altogether from the additional vivacity which his mirth may receive from sym∣pathy with theirs, nor his pain from the disappointment he meets with when he misses this pleasure; though both the one and the other, no doubt, do in some
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
measure. When we have read a book or poem so often that we can no longer find any amusement in reading it by ourselves, we can still take pleasure in reading it to a companion. To him it has all the graces of novelty; we enter into the surprize and admiration which it naturally excites in him, but which it is no longer capable of exciting in us; we consider all the ideas which it presents rather in the light in which they appear to him than in that in which they appear to ourselves, and we are amused by sympathy with his amuse∣ment which thus enlivens our own. On the contrary, we should be vexed if he did not seem to be entertained with it, and we could no longer take any pleasure in reading it to him. It is the same case here. The mirth of the company, no doubt, enlivens our own mirth, and their silence, no doubt, disappoints us. But tho' this may contribute both to the pleasure which we derive from the one, and to the pain which we feel from the other, it is by no means the sole cause of either; and this correspondence of the sentiments of others with our own appears to be a cause of
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
pleasure, and the want of it a cause of pain, which cannot be accounted for in this manner. The sympathy, which my friends express with my joy, might, indeed, give me pleasure by enlivening that joy; but that which they express with my grief could give me none, if it served only to enlieven that grief. Sympathy, however, enlivens joy and alleviates grief. It enlivens joy by presenting another source of satis∣faction; and it alleviates grief by insinu∣ating into the heart almost the only agree∣able sensation which it is at that time ca∣pable of receiving.</P>
<P>It is to be observed accordingly, that we are still more anxious to communicate to our friends our disagreeable than our agree∣able passions, that we derive still more satis∣faction from their sympathy with the for∣mer than from that with the latter, and that we are still more shocked by the want of it.</P>
<P>How are the unfortunate relieved when they have found out a person to whom they can communicate the cause of their sor∣row? Upon his sympathy they seem to disburthen themselves of a part of their distress: he is not improperly said to share
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
it with them. He not only feels a sorrow of the same kind with that which they feel, but as if he had derived a part of it to himself, what he feels seems to alleviate the weight of what they feel. Yet by re∣lating their misfortunes they in some mea∣sure renew their grief. They awaken in their memory the remembrance of those circumstances which occasioned their afflic∣tion. Their tears accordingly flow faster than before, and they are apt to abandon themselves to all the weakness of sorrow. They take pleasure, however, in all this, and, it is evident, are sensibly relieved by it; because the sweetness of his sympathy more than compensates the bitterness of that sorrow, which, in order to excite this sympathy, they had thus enlivened and renewed. The cruelest insult, on the con∣trary, which can be offered to the unfor∣tunate, is to appear to make light of their calamities. To seem not to be affected with the joy of our companions is but want of politeness; but not to wear a serious countenance when they tell us their afflictions, is real and gross inhumanity.</P>
<P>Love is an agreeable; resentment, a dis∣agreeable, passion: and accordingly we are
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
not half so anxious that our friends should adopt our friendships, as that they should enter into our resentments. We can forgive them though they seem to be but little affect∣ed with the favours which we may have re∣ceived, but lose all patience if they seem in∣different about the injuries which may have been done to us: nor are we half so angry with them for not entering into our gra∣titude, as for not sympathising with our resentment. They can easily avoid being friends to our friends, but can hardly avoid being enemies to those with whom we are at variance. We seldom resent their being at enmity with the first, though upon that account we may sometimes affect to make an aukward quarrel with them; but we quarrel with them in good earnest if in friendship with the last. The agreeable passions of love and joy can satisfy and sup∣port the heart without any auxiliary plea∣sure. The bitter and painful emotions of grief and resentment more strongly re∣quire the healing consolation of sympa∣thy.</P>
<P>As the person who is principally interest∣ed in any event is pleased with our sympathy, and hurt by the want of it, so we, too, seem
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
to be pleased when we are able to sympa∣thize with him, and to be hurt when we are unable to do so. We run not only to congratulate the successful, but to con∣dole with the afflicted; and the pleasure which we find in conversing with a man whom we can entirely sympathise with in all his passions, seems to do more than compensate the painfulness of that sorrow with which the view of his situa∣tion affects us. On the contrary, it is al∣ways disagreeable to feel that we cannot sympathize with him, and instead of be∣ing pleased with this exemption from sym∣pathetic pain, it hurts us to find that we cannot share his uneasiness. If we hear a person loudly lamenting his misfortunes, which, however, upon bringing the case home to ourselves, we feel, can produce no such violent effect upon us, we are shocked at his grief; and, because we can∣not enter into it, call it pusillanimity and weakness. It gives us the spleen, on the other hand, to see another too happy or too much elevated, as we call it, with any little piece of good fortune. We are disobliged even with his joy, and, because we cannot go along with it, call it levity
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
and folly. We are even put out of hu∣mour if our companion laughs louder or longer at a joke than we think it deserves; that is, than we feel that we ourselves could laugh at it.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the manner in which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of the affections of other men, by their concord or disso∣nance with our own.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the original passions of the person principally concerned are in perfect concord with the sympathetic emo∣tions of the spectator, they necessarily ap∣pear to this last just and proper, and suit∣able to their objects; and, on the contrary, when, upon bringing the case home to him∣self, he finds that they do not coincide with what he feels, they necessarily appear to him unjust and improper, and unsuitable to the causes which excite them. To ap∣prove of the passions of another, therefore, as suitable to their objects, is the same thing, as to observe that we intirely sympathize with them; and not to approve of them as such, is the same thing as to observe that we do not entirely sympathize with them. The man who resents the inju∣ries that have been done to me, and ob∣serves that I resent them precisely as he does, necessarily approves of my resentment.
<PB N="23" REF="34" MS="y"/>
The man whose sympathy keeps time to my grief, cannot but admit the reasonable∣ness of my sorrow. He who admires the same poem, or the same picture, and ad∣mires them exactly as I do, must surely al∣low the justness of my admiration. He who laughs at the same joke, and laughs along with me, cannot well deny the propriety of my laughter. On the con∣trary, the person who, upon these diffe∣rent occasions, either feels no such emo∣tion as that which I feel, or feels none that bears any proportion to mine, cannot avoid disapproving my sentiments on account of their dissonance with his own. If my animosity goes beyond what the indig∣nation of my friend can correspond to; if my grief exceeds what his most tender compassion can go along with; if my ad∣miration is either too high or too low to tally with his own; if I laugh loud and heartily at what he only smiles, or, on the contrary, only smile when he laughs loud and heartily; in all these cases, as soon as he comes from considering the ob∣ject, to observe how I am affected by it, according as there is more or less dispropor∣tion between his sentiments and mine, I
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
must incur a greater or less degree of his disapprobation: and upon all occasions his own sentiments are the standards and mea∣sures by which he judges of mine.</P>
<P>To approve of another man's opinions is to adopt those opinions, and to adopt them is to approve of them. If the same arguments which convince you convince me likewise, I necessarily approve of your conviction; and if they do not, I necessa∣rily disapprove of it: neither can I possibly conceive that I should do the one without the other. To approve or disapprove, there∣fore, of the opinions of others is acknow∣ledged, by every body, to mean no more than to observe their agreement or disagree∣ment with our own. But this is equally the case with regard to our approbation or disapprobation of the sentiments or passions of others.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, some cases in which we seem to approve without any sympathy or correspondence of sentiments, and in which, consequently, the sentiment of ap∣probation would seem to be different from the perception of this coincidence. A lit∣tle attention, however, will convince us that even in these cases our approbation
<PB N="25" REF="36" MS="y"/>
is ultimately founded upon a sympathy or correspondence of this kind. I shall give an instance in things of a very frivolous na∣ture, because in them the judgments of mankind are less apt to be perverted by wrong systems. We may often approve of a jest, and think the laughter of the com∣pany quite just and proper, though we our∣selves do not laugh, because, perhaps, we are in a grave humour, or happen to have our attention engaged with other objects. We have learned, however, from experience, what sort of pleasantry is upon most occasions capable of making us laugh, and we observe that this is one of that kind. We approve, therefore, of the laughter of the company, and feel that it is natural and suitable to its object; because, though in our present mood we cannot easily enter into it, we are sensible that upon most occasions we should very heartily join in it.</P>
<P>The same thing often happens with re∣gard to all the other passions. A stranger passes by us in the street with all the marks of the deepest affliction; and we are imme∣diately told that he has just received the news of the death of his father. It is impossible that, in this case, we should not
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
approve of his grief. Yet it may often happen, without any defect of humanity on our part, that, so far from entering into the violence of his sorrow, we should scarce conceive the first movements of con∣cern upon his account. Both he and his father, perhaps, are intirely unknown to us, or we happen to be employed about other things, and do not take time to pic∣ture out in our imagination the different circumstances of distress which must occur to him. We have learned, however, from experience, that such a misfortune naturally excites such a degree of sorrow, and we know that if we took time to consider his situation fully and in all its parts, we should, without doubt, most sincerely sym∣pathize with him. It is upon the consci∣ousness of this conditional sympathy, that our approbation of his sorrow is founded, even in those cases in which that sympa∣thy does not actually take place; and the general rules derived from our preceding experience of what, upon most occasions, our sentiments would correspond with, cor∣rect the impropriety of our present emo∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="38"/>The sentiment or affection of the heart from which any action proceeds, and upon which its whole virtue or vice must ulti∣mately depend, may be considered under two different aspects, or in two different relations; first, in relation to the cause that excites it, or the motive that gives oc∣casion to it; and secondly, in relation to the end that it proposes, or the effect that it tends to produce.</P>
<P>In the suitableness or unsuitableness, in the proportion or disproportion which the affection seems to bear to the cause or ob∣ject which excites it, consists the propriety or impropriety, the decency or ungrace∣fulness of the consequent action.</P>
<P>In the beneficial or hurtful nature of the effects which the affection aims at, or tends to produce, consists the merit or demerit of the action, the qualities by which it is en∣titled to reward, or is deserving of punish∣ment.</P>
<P>Philosophers have, of late years, consider∣ed chiefly the tendency of affections, and have given little attention to the relation which they stand in to the cause which ex∣cites them. In common life, however, when we judge of any person's conduct, and of
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
the sentiments which directed it, we con∣stantly consider them under both these as∣pects. When we blame in another man the excesses of love, of grief, of resent∣ment, we not only consider the ruinous effects which they tend to produce, but the little occasion which was given for them. The merit of his favourite, we say, is not so great, his misfortune is not so dreadful, his provocation is not so extraordinary, as to justify so violent a passion. We should have indulged, we say; perhaps, have approved of the vio∣lence of his emotion, had the cause been in any respect proportioned to it.</P>
<P>When we judge in this manner of any affection, as proportioned or dispro∣portioned to the cause which excites it, it is scarce possible that we should make use of any other rule or canon but the cor∣respondent affection in ourselves. If, upon bringing the case home to our own breast, we find that the sentiments which it gives occasion to coincide and tally with our own, we necessarily approve of them as propor∣tioned and suitable to their objects: if otherwise, we necessarily disapprove of them, as extravagant and out of proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="40"/>Every faculty in one man is the measure by which he judges of the like faculty in another. I judge of your sight by my sight, of your ear by my ear, of your rea∣son by my reason, of your resentment by my resentment, of your love by my love. I neither have, nor can have, any other way of judging about them.</P>

<PB N="30" REF="41"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. The same subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>WE may judge of the propriety or impropriety of the sentiments of another person by their correspondence or disagreement with our own, upon two different occasions; either, first, when the objects which excite them are considered without any peculiar relation, either to our∣selves or to the person whose sentiments we judge of; or, secondly, when they are con∣sidered as peculiarly affecting one or other of us.</P>
<P N="1">1. With regard to those objects which are considered without any peculiar relation either to ourselves or to the person whose sentiments we judge of; wherever his sen∣timents intirely correspond with our own, we ascribe to him the qualities of taste and good judgment. The beauty of a plain, the greatness of a mountain, the ornaments of a building, the expression of a picture, the composition of a discourse, the conduct of a third person, the proportions of different quantities and numbers, the various ap∣pearances
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
which the great machine of the universe is perpetually exhibiting, with the secret wheels and springs which produce them; in a word, all the general subjects of science and taste, are what we and our com∣panion regard, as having no peculiar relation to either of us. We both look at them from the same point of view, and we have no oc∣casion for sympathy, or for that imaginary change of situations from which it arises, in order to produce, with regard to these the most perfect harmony of sentiments and affections. If, notwithstanding, we are of∣ten differently affected, it arises either from the different degrees of attention, which our different habits of life allow us to give easily to the several parts of those com∣plex objects, or from the different degrees of natural acuteness in the faculty of the mind to which they are addressed.</P>
<P>When the sentiments of our companion coincide with our own in things of this kind, which are obvious and easy, and in which, perhaps, we never found a single person who differed from us, though we, no doubt, must approve of them, yet he seems to deserve no praise of admiration on account of them. But when they
<PB N="32" REF="43"/>
not only coincide with our own, but lead and direct our own; when in forming them he appears to have attended to many things which we had overlooked, and to have ad∣justed them to all the various circumstan∣ces of their objects; we not only approve of them, but wonder and are surprised at their uncommon and unexpected acute∣ness and comprehensiveness, and he ap∣pears to deserve a very high degree of ad∣miration and applause. For approbation heightned by wonder and surprise, consti∣tutes the sentiment which is properly call∣ed admiration, and of which applause is the natural expression. The decision of the man who judges that exquisite beauty is preferable to the grossest deformity, or that twice two are equal to four, must certainly be approved of by all the world, but will not, surely, be much admired. It is the acute and delicate discernment of the man of taste, who distinguishes the minute, and scarce perceptible, differences of beauty and deformity; it is the compre∣hensive accuracy of the experienced mathe∣matician, who unravels, with ease, the most intricate and perplexed proportions; it is the great leader in science and taste, the
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
man who directs and conducts our own sen∣timents, the extent and superior justness of whose talents astonish us with wonder and surprise, who excites our admiration and seems to deserve our applause: and upon this foundation is grounded the greater part of the praise which is bestow∣ed upon what are called the intellectual virtues.</P>
<P>The utility of those qualities, it may be thought, is what first recommends them to us; and, no doubt, the consideration of this, when we come to attend to it, gives them a new value. Originally, however, we approve of another man's judgment, not as something useful, but as right, as accurate, as agreeable to truth and reality: and it is evident we attribute those qualities to it for no other reason but because we find that it agrees with our own. Taste, in the same manner, is originally approved of, not as useful, but as just, as delicate, and as precisely suited to its object. The idea of the utility of all qualities of this kind, is plainly an after-thought, and not what first recommends them to our approba∣tion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="34" REF="45"/>2. With regard to those objects, which affect in a particular manner either our∣selves or the person whose sentiments we judge of, it is at once more difficult to preserve this harmony and correspondence, and at the same time, vastly more impor∣tant. My companion does not naturally look upon the misfortune that has befallen me, or the injury that has been done me, from the same point of view in which I consider them. They affect me much more nearly. We do not view them from the same station, as we do a picture, or a poem, or a system of philosophy, and are, there∣fore, apt to be very differently affected by them. But I can much more easily over∣look the want of this correspondence of sentiments with regard to such indifferent objects as concern neither me nor my com∣panion, than with regard to what interests me so much as the misfortune that has be∣fallen me, or the injury that has been done me. Though you despise that pic∣ture, or that poem, or even that system of philosophy, which I admire, there is little danger of our quarrelling upon that ac∣count. Neither of us can reasonably be
<PB N="35" REF="46"/>
much interested about them. They ought all of them to be matters of great indifference to us both; so that, though our opinions may be opposite, our affections may still be very nearly the same. But it is quite other∣wise with regard to those objects by which either you or I are particularly affected. Though your judgments in matters of spe∣culation, though your sentiments in matters of taste, are quite opposite to mine, I can easily overlook this opposition; and if I have any degree of temper, I may still find some entertainment in your conversation, even upon those very subjects. But if you have either no fellow-feeling for the mis∣fortunes I have met with, or none that bears any proportion to the grief which distracts me; or if you have either no in∣dignation at the injuries I have suffered, or none that bears any proportion to the resentment which transports me, we can no longer converse upon these subjects. We become intolerable to one another. I can neither support your company, nor you mine. You are confounded at my violence and passion, and I am enraged at your cold insensibility and want of feeling.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47"/>In all such cases, that there may be some correspondence of sentiments between the spectator and the person principally concern∣ed, the spectator must, first of all, endea∣vour, as much as he can, to put himself in the situation of the other, and to bring home to himself every little circumstance of distress which can possibly occur to the sufferer. He must adopt the whole case of his companion with all its minutest in∣cidents; and strive to render, as perfect as possible, that imaginary change of situa∣tion upon which his sympathy is founded.</P>
<P>After all this, however, the emotions of the spectator will still be very apt to fall short of the violence of what is felt by the sufferer. Mankind, though natu∣rally sympathetic, never conceive, for what has befallen another, that degree of passion which naturally animates the person prin∣cipally concerned. That imaginary change of situation, upon which their sympathy is founded, is but momentary. The thought of their own safety, the thought that they themselves are not really the suf∣ferers, continually intrudes itself upon them; and though it does not hinder them
<PB N="37" REF="48" MS="y"/>
from conceiving a passion somewhat analo∣gous to what is felt by the sufferer, hinders them from conceiving any thing that ap∣proaches to the same degree of violence. The person concerned is sensible of this, and, at the same time, passionately desires a more compleat sympathy. He longs for that re∣lief which nothing can afford him but the entire concord of the affections of the spec∣tators with his own. To see the emo∣tions of their hearts, in every respect, beat time to his own, in the violent and disa∣greeable passions, constitutes his sole con∣solation. But he can only hope to obtain this by lowering his passion to that pitch, in which the spectators are capable of go∣ing along with him. He must flatten, if I may be allowed to say so, the sharpness of its natural tone, in order to reduce it to harmony and concord with the emo∣tions of those who are about him. What they feel, will, indeed, always be, in some respects, different from what he feels, and compassion can never be exactly the same with original sorrow; because the secret consciousness that the change of situations, from which the sympathetic sentiment arises, is but imaginary, not only lowers
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>
it in degree, but, in some measure, varies it in kind, and gives it a quite different modification. These two sentiments, how∣ever, may, it is evident, have such a cor∣respondence with one another, as is suffi∣cient for the harmony of society. Though they will never be unisons, they may be concords, and this is all that is wanted or required.</P>
<P>In order to produce this concord, as nature teaches the spectators to assume the circumstances of the person principally con∣cerned, so she teaches this last in some measure to assume those of the spectators. As they are continually placing themselves in his situation, and thence conceiving emotions similar to what he feels; so he is as constantly placing himself in theirs, and thence conceiving some degree of that cool∣ness about his own fortune, with which he is sensible that they will view it. As they are constantly considering what they them∣selves would feel, if they actually were the sufferers, so he is as constantly led to ima∣gine in what manner he would be affected if he was only one of the spectators of his own situation. As their sympathy makes them look at it, in some measure, with his
<PB N="39" REF="50" MS="y"/>
eyes, so his sympathy makes him look at it, in some measure, with theirs, especially when in their presence and acting under their observation: and as the reflected pas∣sion, which he thus conceives, is much weaker than the original one, it necessa∣rily abates the violence of what he felt be∣fore he came into their presence, before he began to recollect in what manner they would be affected by it, and to view his situation in this candid and impartial light.</P>
<P>The mind, therefore, is rarely so disturb∣ed, but that the company of a friend will restore it to some degree of tranquillity and sedateness. The breast is, in some measure, calmed and composed the moment we come into his presence. We are immediately put in mind of the light in which he will view our situation, and we begin to view it ourselves in the same light; for the effect of sympathy is instantaneous. We expect less sympathy from a common acquaintance than from a friend: we cannot open to the former all those little circumstances which we can unfold to the latter: we assume, therefore, more tranquillity before him, and endeavour to fix our thoughts upon those
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
general outlines of our situation which he is willing to consider. We expect still less sympathy from an assembly of strangers, and we assume, therefore, still more tran∣quillity before them, and always endeavour to bring down our passion to that pitch, which the particular company we are in may be expected to go along with. Nor is this merely an assumed appearance: for if we are at all masters of ourselves, the pre∣sence of a mere acquaintance will really compose us, still more than that of a friend; and that of an assembly of strangers still more than that of a mere acquaintance.</P>
<P>Society and conversation, therefore, are the most powerful remedies for restoring the mind to its tranquillity, if, at any time, it has unfortunately lost it; as well as the best preservatives of that equal and happy temper, which is so necessary to self-satis∣faction and enjoyment. Men of retirement and speculation, who are apt to sit brooding at home over either grief or resentment, though they may often have more humani∣ty, more generosity, and a nicer sense of honour, yet seldom possess that equality of temper which is so common among men of the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the amiable and respectable virtues.</HEAD>
<P>UPON these two different efforts, upon that of the spectator to enter into the sentiments of the person principally concerned, and upon that of the person principally concerned, to bring down his emotions to what the spectator can go along with, are founded two different sets of virtues. The soft, the gentle and the ami∣able virtues, the virtues of candid conde∣scension and indulgent humanity, are founded upon the one: the great, the awful and respectable, the virtues of self-denial, of self-government, of that com∣mand of the passions which subjects all the movements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour, and the propriety of our own conduct require, take their origin from the other.</P>
<P>How amiable does he appear to be, whose sympathetic heart seems to re-echo all the sentiments of those with whom he converses, who grieves for their calamities, who re∣sents their injuries, and who rejoices at
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
their good fortune! When we bring home to ourselves the situation of his companions, we enter into their gratitude, and feel what consolation they must derive from the ten∣der sympathy of so affectionate a friend. And for a contrary reason, how disagree∣able does he appear to be, whose hard and obdurate heart feels for himself only, but is altogether insensible to the happiness or misery of others! We enter, in this case too, into the pain which his presence must give to every mortal with whom he con∣verses, to those especially with whom we are most apt to sympathize, the unfortu∣nate and the injured.</P>
<P>On the other hand, what noble pro∣priety and grace do we feel in the con∣duct of those who, in their own case, exert that recollection and self-command which constitute the dignity of every passion, and which bring it down to what others can enter into. We are disgusted with that clamorous grief, which, without any de∣licacy, calls upon our compassion with sighs and tears and importunate lamenta∣tions. But we reverence that reserved, that silent and majestic sorrow, which dis∣covers itself only in the swelling of the eyes,
<PB N="43" REF="54" MS="y"/>
in the quivering of the lips and cheeks, and in the distant, but affecting, coldness of the whole behaviour. It imposes the like silence upon us. We regard it with re∣spectful attention, and watch with anxious concern over our whole behaviour, lest by any impropriety we should disturb that concerted tranquillity, which it requires so great an effort to support.</P>
<P>The insolence and brutality of anger, in the same manner, when we indulge its fury without check or restraint, is, of all objects, the most detestable. But we ad∣mire that noble and generous resentment which governs its pursuit of the greatest injuries, not by the rage which they are apt to excite in the breast of the sufferer, but by the indignation which they natu∣rally call forth in that of the impartial spec∣tator; which allows no word, no gesture, to escape it beyond what this more equita∣ble sentiment would dictate; which never, even in thought, attempts any greater ven∣geance, nor desires to inflict any greater punishment, than what every indifferent person would rejoice to see executed.</P>
<P>And hence it is, that to feel much for others and little for ourselves, that to re∣strain
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
our selfish, and to indulge our be∣nevolent affections, constitutes the perfec∣tion of human nature; and can alone pro∣duce among mankind that harmony of sen∣timents and passions in which consists their whole grace and propriety. As to love our neighbour as we love ourselves is the great law of christianity, so it is the great precept of nature to love ourselves only as we love our neighbour, or what comes to the same thing, as our neighbour is capable of loving us.</P>
<P>As taste and good judgment, when they are considered as qualities which deserve praise and admiration, are supposed to im∣ply a delicacy of sentiment and an acute∣ness of understanding not commonly to be met with; so the virtues of sensibility and self-command are not apprehended to con∣sist in the ordinary, but in the uncommon degrees of those qualities. The amiable virtue of humanity requires, surely, a sensi∣bility, much beyond what is possessed by the rude vulgar of mankind. The great and exalted virtue of magnanimity undoubtedly demands much more than that degree of self-command, which the weakest of mor∣tals is capable of exerting. As in the com∣mon
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>
degree of the intellectual qualities, there is no abilities; so in the common de∣gree of the moral, there is no virtue. Vir∣tue is excellence, something uncommonly great and beautiful, which rises far above what is vulgar and ordinary. The ami∣able virtues consist in that degree of sensi∣bility which surprises by its exquisite and unexpected delicacy and tenderness. The awful and respectable, in that degree of self-command which astonishes by its amaz∣ing superiority over the most ungovernable passions of human nature.</P>
<P>There is, in this respect, a considerable difference between virtue and mere pro∣priety; between those qualities and actions which deserve to be admired and celebra∣ted, and those which simply deserve to be approved of. Upon many occasions, to act with the most perfect propriety, requires no more than that common and ordinary degree of sensibility or self-command which the most worthless of mankind are possest of, and sometimes even that degree is not necessary. Thus, to give a very low in∣stance, to eat when we are hungry, is cer∣tainly, upon ordinary occasions, perfectly right and proper, and cannot miss being
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>
approved of as such by every body. No∣thing, however, could be more absurd than to say it was virtuous.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there may frequently be a considerable degree of virtue in those actions, which fall short of the most per∣fect propriety; because they may still ap∣proach nearer to perfection than could well be expected upon occasions in which it was so extremely difficult to attain it: and this is very often the case upon those occasions which require the greatest ex∣ertions of self-command. There are some situations which bear so hard upon human nature, that the greatest degree of self-government, which can belong to so im∣perfect a creature as man, is not able to stifle, altogether, the voice of human weak∣ness, or reduce the violence of the passions to that pitch of moderation, in which the impartial spectator can entirely enter into them. Though in those cases, there∣fore, the behaviour of the sufferer fall short of the most perfect propriety, it may still deserve some applause, and even, in a cer∣tain sense, may be denominated virtuous. It may still manifest an effort of genero∣sity and magnanimity of which the greater
<PB N="47" REF="58"/>
part of men are incapable; and though it fails of absolute perfection, it may be a much nearer approximation towards per∣fection, than what, upon such trying oc∣casions, is commonly either to be found or to be expected.</P>
<P>In all cases of this kind, when we are determining the degree of blame or ap∣plause that seems due to any action, we very frequently make use of two different standards. The first is the idea of com∣plete propriety and perfection, which, in those difficult situations, no human con∣duct ever did, or ever can come up to; and in comparison with which the actions of all men must forever appear blameable and imperfect. The second is the idea of that degree of proximity or distance from this complete perfection, which the actions of the greater part of men commonly arrive at. Whatever goes beyond this degree, how far soever it may be removed from absolute perfection, seems to deserve ap∣plause; and whatever falls short of it, to deserve blame.</P>
<P>It is in the same manner that we judge of the productions of all the arts which ad∣dress themselves to the imagination. When
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
a critic examines the work of any of the great masters in poetry or painting, he may sometimes examine it by an idea of perfection, in his own mind, which nei∣ther that nor any other human work will ever come up to; and as long as he com∣pares it with this standard, he can see no∣thing in it but faults and imperfections. But when he comes to consider the rank which it ought to hold among other works of the same kind, he necessarily compares it with a very different standard, the com∣mon degree of excellence which is usually attained in this particular art; and, when he judges of it by this new measure, it may often appear to deserve the highest ap∣plause, upon account of its approaching much nearer to perfection than the greater part of those works which can be brought into competition with it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the degrees of the different passions which are consistent with propriety.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE propriety of every passion ex∣cited by objects peculiarly related to ourselves, the pitch which the spectator can go along with, must lye, it is evident, in a certain mediocrity. If the passion is too high, or if it is too low, he cannot enter into it. Grief and resentment for private misfortunes and injuries may easi∣ly, for example, be too high, and in the greater part of mankind they are so. They may likewise, though this more rarely happens, be too low. We denominate the excess, weakness, and fury: and we call the defect stupidity, insensibility, and want of spirit. We can enter into neither of them, but are astonished and confound∣ed to see them.</P>
<P>This mediocrity, however, in which the point of propriety consists, is different
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
in different passions. It is high in some, and low in others. There are some pas∣sions which it is indecent to express very strongly, even upon those occasions, in which it is acknowledged we cannot avoid feeling them in the highest degree. And there are others of which the strongest expressions are upon many occasions ex∣tremely graceful, even though the passions themselves do not, perhaps, arise so neces∣sarily. The first are those passions with which, for certain reasons, there is little or no sympathy: the second are those with which, for other reasons, there is the greatest. And if we consider all the different passions of human nature, we shall find that they are regarded as de∣cent, or indecent, just in proportion as mankind are more or less disposed to sympathise with them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="51" REF="62" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the passions which take their origin from the body.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is indecent to express any strong degree of those passions which arise from a certain situation or disposition of the body; because the company, not being in the same disposition, cannot be expected to sympathise with them. Violent hunger, for example, though upon many occasions not only natural, but unavoidable, is al∣ways indecent, and to eat voraciously is universally regarded as a piece of ill man∣ners. There is, however, some degree of sympathy, even with hunger. It is agree∣able to see our companions eat with a good appetite, and all expressions of loath∣ing are offensive. The disposition of body which is habitual to a man in health, makes his stomach easily keep time, if I may be allowed so coarse an expres∣sion, with the one, and not with the other. We can sympathise with the distress which excessive hunger occasions, when we read the description of it in the journal of a
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
siege, or of a sea voyage. We imagine ourselves in the situation of the sufferers, and thence readily conceive the grief, the fear and consternation, which must necessarily distract them. We feel, our∣selves, some degree of those passions, and therefore sympathise with them: but as we do not grow hungry by reading the description, we cannot properly, even in this case, be said to sympathise with their hunger.</P>
<P>It is the same case with the passion by which nature unites the two sexes. Though naturally the most furious of all the passions, all strong expressions of it are upon every occasion indecent, even between persons in whom its most com∣pleat indulgence, is acknowledged by all laws, both human and divine, to be per∣fectly innocent. There seems, however, to be some degree of sympathy even with this passion. To talk to a woman as we should to a man is improper: it is expected that their company should in∣spire us with more gaiety, more plea∣santry, and more attention; and an in∣tire insensibility to the fair sex, renders a
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>
man contemptible in some measure even to the men.</P>
<P>Such is our aversion for all the appe∣tites which take their origin from the body: all strong expressions of them are loathsome and disagreeable. According to some antient philosophers, these are the passions which we share in common with the brutes, and which having no connec∣tion with the characteristical qualities of human nature, are upon that account be∣neath its dignity. But there are many other passions which we share in common with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brutes, such as resentment, natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and even gratitude, which do not, upon that account, appear to be so brutal▪ The true cause of the peculiar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we conceive for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> body, when we see them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> men, is that we cannot enter into them. To the person himself who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, as soon as they are gratified, the object that excited them ceases to be agreeable: even its presence often be∣comes offensive to him; he looks round to no purpose for the charm which trans∣ported him the moment before, and he can now as little enter into his own
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
passion as another person. When we have dined, we order the covers to be re∣moved; and we should treat in the same manner the objects of the most ardent and passionate desires, if they were the objects of no other passions but those which take their origin from the body.</P>
<P>In the command of those appetites of the body consists that virtue which is pro∣perly called temperance. To restrain them within those bounds, which regard to health and fortune prescribes, is the part of prudence. But to confine them with∣in those limits, which grace, which pro∣priety, which delicacy, and modesty, re∣quire, is the office of temperance.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is for the same reason that to cry out with bodily pain, how intolerable so∣ever, appears always unmanly and un∣becoming. There is, however, a good deal of sympathy even with bodily pain. If, as has already been observed, I see a stroke aimed, and just ready to fall upon the leg, or arm, of another person, I naturally shrink and draw back my own leg, or my own arm; and when it does fall, I feel it in some measure, and am hurt by it as well as the sufferer. My
<PB N="55" REF="66"/>
hurt, however, is, no doubt, excessively slight, and, upon that account, if he makes any violent out-cry, as I cannot go along with him, I never fail to despise him. And this is the case of all the passions which take their origin from the body; they excite either no sympathy at all, or such a degree of it, as is altoge∣ther disproportioned to the violence of what is felt by the sufferer.</P>
<P>It is quite otherwise with those pas∣sions which take their origin from the imagination. The frame of my body can be but little affected by the altera∣tions which are brought about upon that of my companion: but my imagination is more ductile, and more readily as∣sumes, if I may say so, the shape and configuration of the imaginations of those wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h whom I am familiar. A disappoint∣ment in love, or ambition, will, upon this account, call forth more sympathy than the greatest bodily evil. Those pas∣sions arise altogether from the imagina∣tion. The person who has lost his whole fortune, if he is in health, feels nothing in his body. What he suffers is from the imagination only, which represents to him
<PB N="56" REF="67"/>
the loss of his dignity, neglect from his friends, contempt from his enemies, de∣pendance, want, and misery, coming fast upon him; and we sympathise with him more strongly upon this account, because our imaginations can more readily mould themselves upon his imagination, than our bodies can mould themselves upon his body.</P>
<P>The loss of a leg may generally be regarded as a more real calamity than the loss of a mistress. It would be a ridicu∣lous tragedy, however, of which the ca∣tastrophe was to turn upon a loss of that kind. A misfortune of the other kind, how frivolous soever it may appear to be, has given occasion to many a fine one.</P>
<P>Nothing is so soon forgot as pain. The moment it is gone the whole agony of it is over, and the thought of it can no longer give us any sort of disturbance. We ourselves cannot then enter into the anxiety and anguish which we had before conceived. An unguarded word from a friend will occasion a more durable unea∣siness. The agony which this creates is by no means over with the word. What at first disturbs us is not the object of
<PB N="57" REF="68" MS="y"/>
the senses, but the idea of the imagina∣tion. As it is an idea, therefore, which occasions our uneasiness, till time and other accidents have in some measure ef∣faced it from our memory, the imagina∣tion continues to fret and rankle within, from the thought of it.</P>
<P>Pain never calls forth any very lively sym∣pathy unless it is accompanied with danger. We sympathise with the fear, though not with the agony of the sufferer. Fear, how∣ever, is a passion derived altogether from the imagination, which represents, with an uncertainty and fluctuation that in∣creases our anxiety, not what we really feel, but what we may hereafter possibly suffer. The gout, or the tooth-ach, tho' exquisitely painful, excite very little sympa∣thy; more dangerous diseases, tho' accom∣panied with very little pain, excite the highest.</P>
<P>Some people faint and grow sick at the sight of a chirurgical operation, and that bodily pain which is occasioned by tearing the flesh, seems, in them, to excite the most excessive sympathy. We conceive in a much more lively and distinct man∣ner, the pain which proceeds from an ex∣ternal
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
cause, than we do that which arises from an internal disorder. I can scarce form an idea of the agonies of my neigh∣bour when he is tortured with the gout, or the stone; but I have the clearest con∣ception of what he must suffer from an incision, a wound, or a fracture. The chief cause, however, why such objects produce such violent effects upon us, is their novelty. One who has been witness to a dozen dissections, and as many am∣putations, sees, ever after, all operations of this kind with great indifference, and often with perfect insensibility. Though we have read or seen represented more than five hundred tragedies, we shall seldom feel so entire an abatement of our sensibility to the objects which they represent to us.</P>
<P>In some of the Greek tragedies there is an attempt to excite compassion, by the representation of the agonies of bodily pain. Philoctetes cries out and faints from the extremity of his sufferings. Hippoly∣tus and Hercules are both introduced as expiring under the severest tortures, which, it seems, even the fortitude of Hercules was incapable of supporting. In all these cases, however, it is not the pain which
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
interests us, but some other circumstance. It is not the sore foot, but the solitude, of Philoctetes which affects us, and dif∣fuses over that charming tragedy, that ro∣mantic wildness, which is so agreeable to the imagination. The agonies of Hercules and Hippolytus are interesting only be∣cause we forsee that death is to be the conse∣quence. If those heroes were to recover, we should think the representation of their sufferings perfectly ridiculous. What a tra∣gedy would that be of which the distress con∣sisted in a cholic. Yet no pain is more exquisite. These attempts to excite com∣passion by the representation of bodily pain, may be regarded as among the greatest breaches of decorum of which the Greek theatre has set the example.</P>
<P>The little sympathy which we feel with bodily pain is the foundation of the pro∣priety of constancy and patience in endur∣ing it. The man, who under the seve∣rest tortures allows no weakness to escape him, vents no groan, gives way to no passion which we do not entirely enter in∣to, commands our highest admiration. His firmness enables him to keep time with our indifference and insensibility.
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
We admire and intirely go along with the magnanimous effort which he makes for this purpose. We approve of his be∣haviour, and from our experience of the common weakness of human nature, we are surprised, and wonder how he should be able to act so as to deserve approbation. Approbation, mixed and animated by won∣der and surprize, constitutes the sentiment which is properly called admiration, of which, applause is the natural expression, as has already been observed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of those passions which take their origin from a particular turn or habit of the imagination.</HEAD>
<P>EVEN of the passions derived from the imagination, those which take their origin from a peculiar turn or habit it has acquired, though they may be ac∣knowledged to be perfectly natural, are, however, but little sympathised with. The imaginations of mankind, not having acquired that particular turn, cannot enter into them; and such passions, though they
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
may be allowed to be almost unavoidable in some part of life, are always in some measure ridiculous. This is the case with that strong attachment which natu∣rally grows up between two persons of different sexes, who have long fixed their thoughts upon one another. Our imagi∣nation not having run in the same channel with that of the lover, we cannot enter into the eagerness of his emotions. If our friend has been injured, we readily sympathise with his resentment, and grow angry with the very person with whom he his angry. If he has received a be∣nefit, we readily enter into his gratitude, and have a very high sense of the merit of his benefactor. But if he is in love, though we may think his passion just as reasonable as any of the kind, yet we never think ourselves bound to conceive a passion of the same kind, and for the same person for whom he has conceived it. The passion appears to every body, but the man who feels it, entirely dis∣proportioned to the value of the object; and love, though it is pardoned in a certain age because we know it is natural, is always laughed at, because we cannot
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
enter into it. All serious and strong ex∣pressions of it appear ridiculous to a third person; and if the lover is not good com∣pany to his mistress, he is to no body else. He himself is sensible of this; and as long as he continues in his sober senses, endea∣vours to treat his own passion with raillery and ridicule. It is the only stile in which we care to hear of it; because it is the only stile in which we ourselves are disposed to talk of it. We grow weary of the grave, pedantic, and long-sentenced love of Cow∣ley and Propertius, who never have done with exaggerating the violence of their at∣tachments; but the gaiety of Ovid, and the gallantry of Horace, are always agree∣able.</P>
<P>But tho' we feel no proper sympathy with an attachment of this kind, tho' we never approach even in imagination to∣wards conceiving a passion for that parti∣cular person, yet as we either have con∣ceived, or may be disposed to conceive, passions of the same kind, we readily en∣ter into those high hopes of happiness which are proposed from its gratification, as well as into that exquisite distress which is feared from its disappointment. It in∣terests
<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
us not as a passion, but as a situa∣tion that gives occasion to other passions which interest us; to hope, to fear, and to distress of every kind: In the same manner as in a description of a sea voy∣age, it is not the hunger which interests us, but the distress which that hunger oc∣casions. Tho' we do not properly enter into the attachment of the lover, we rea∣dily go along with those expectations of romantic happiness which he derives from it. We feel how natural it is for the mind, in a certain situation, relaxed with indolence, and fatigued with the violence of desire, to long for serenity and quiet, to hope to find them in the gratification of that passion which distracts it, and to frame to itself the idea of that life of pas∣toral tranquillity and retirement which the elegant, the tender, and the passionate Ti∣bullus takes so much pleasure in describ∣ing; a life like what the poets describe in the Fortunate Islands, a life of friend∣ship, liberty, and repose; free from la∣bour, and from care, and from all the turbulent passions which attend them. Even scenes of this kind interest us most, when they are painted rather as what is
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
hoped, than as what is enjoyed. The grossness of that passion, which mixes with, and is, perhaps, the foundation of love, disappears when its gratification is far off and at a distance; but renders the whole offensive, when described as what is im∣mediately possessed. The happy passion, upon this account, interests us much less than the fearful and the melancholy. We tremble for whatever can disappoint such natural and agreeable hopes: and thus enter into all the anxiety, and concern, and distress of the lover.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that, in some modern tra∣gedies and romances, this passion appears so wonderfully interesting. It is not so much the love of Castalio and Monimia which attaches us in the Orphan, as the distress which that love occasions. The author who should introduce two lovers, in a scene of perfect security, expressing their mutual fondness for one another, would excite laughter, and not sympathy. If a scene of this kind is ever admitted into a tragedy, it is always, in some mea∣sure, improper, and is endured, not from any sympathy with the passion that is ex∣pressed in it, but from concern for the dan∣gers
<PB N="65" REF="76" MS="y"/>
and difficulties with which the audi∣ence foresee that its gratification is likely to be attended.</P>
<P>The reserve which the laws of society impose upon the fair sex, with regard to this weakness, renders it more peculiarly distressful in them, and, upon that very account, more deeply interesting. We are charmed with the love of Phaedra, as it is expressed in the French tragedy of that name, notwithstanding all the extra∣vagance and guilt which attend it. That very extravagance and guilt may be said, in some measure, to recommend it to us. Her fear, her shame, her remorse, her horror, her despair, become thereby more natural and interesting. All the seconda∣ry passions, if I may be allowed to call them so, which arise from the situation of love, become necessarily more furious and violent: and it is with these secondary passions only that we can properly be said to sympathize.</P>
<P>Of all the passions, however, which are so extravagantly disproportioned to the va∣lue of their objects, love is the only one that appears, even to the weakest minds, to have any thing in it that is either
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
graceful or agreeable. In itself, first of all, tho' it may be ridiculous, it is not na∣turally odious; and tho' its consequences are often fatal and dreadful, its intentions are seldom mischievous. And then, tho' there is little propriety in the passion itself, there is a good deal in some of those which always accompany it. There is in love a strong mixture of humanity, gene∣rosity, kindness, friendship, esteem; pas∣sions with which, of all others, for rea∣sons which shall be explained immediately, we have the greatest propensity to sympa∣thize, even notwithstanding we are sensible that they are, in some measure, excessive. The sympathy which we feel with them, renders the passion which they accompany less disagreeable, and supports it in our imagination, notwithstanding all the vices which commonly go along with it; tho' in the one sex it necessarily leads to the last ruin and infamy; and tho' in the other, where it is apprehended to be least fatal, it is al∣most always attended with an incapacity for labour, a neglect of duty, a contempt of fame, and even of common reputa∣tion. Notwithstanding all this, the de∣gree of sensibility and generosity with
<PB N="67" REF="78" MS="y"/>
which it is supposed to be accompanied, renders it to many the object of vanity; and they are fond of appearing capable of feeling what would do them no honour if they had really felt it.</P>
<P>It is for a reason of the same kind, that a certain reserve is necessary when we talk of our own friends, our own studies, our own professions. All these are objects which we cannot expect should interest our com∣panions in the same degree in which they interest us. And it is for want of this reserve, that the one half of mankind make bad company to the other. A phi∣losopher is company to a philosopher only; the member of a club, to his own little knot of companions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the unsocial passions.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is another set of passions, which tho' derived from the imagi∣nation, yet before we can enter into them, or regard them as graceful or becoming, must always be brought down to a pitch much lower than that to which undisci∣plined
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>
nature would raise them. These are hatred and resentment, with all their different modifications. With regard to all such passions, our sympathy is divided between the person who feels them and the person who is the object of them. The interests of these two are directly oppo∣site. What our sympathy with the per∣son who feels them would prompt us to wish for, our fellow-feeling with the other would lead us to fear. As they are both men, we are concerned for both, and our fear for what the one may suffer, damps our resentment for what the other has suf∣fered. Our sympathy, therefore, with the man who has received the provocation, necessarily falls short of the passion which naturally animates him, not only upon account of those general causes which ren∣der all sympathetic passions inferior to the original ones, but upon account of that particular cause which is peculiar to itself, our opposite sympathy with another person. Before resentment, therefore, can become graceful and agreeable, it must be more humbled and brought down below that pitch to which it would naturally rise, than almost any other passion.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="80" MS="y"/>Mankind, at the same time, have a very strong sense of the injuries that are done to another. The villain, in a tragedy or romance, is as much the object of our in∣dignation, as the hero is that of our sym∣pathy and affection. We detest Iago as much as we esteem Othello; and delight as much in the punishment of the one, as we are grieved for the distress of the other. But tho' mankind have so strong a fellow-feeling with the injuries that are done to their brethren, they do not always resent them the more that the sufferer appears to resent them. Upon most occasions, the greater his patience, his mildness, his hu∣manity, provided it does not appear that he wants spirit, or that fear was the mo∣tive of his forbearance, the higher the re∣sentment against the person who injured him. The amiableness of the character exasperates their sense of the atrocity of the injury.</P>
<P>These passions, however, are regarded as necessary parts of the character of hu∣man nature. A person becomes contemp∣tible who tamely sits still, and submits to insults, without attempting either to repel or to revenge them. We cannot enter in∣to
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
his indifference and insensibility: we call his behaviour mean-spiritedness, and are as really provoked by it, as by the insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enra∣ged to see any man submit patiently to af∣fronts and ill usage. They desire to see this insolence resented, and resented by the person who suffers from it. They cry to him with fury, to defend, or to revenge himself. If his indignation rouses at last, they heartily applaud, and sympathise with it. It enlivens their own indignation a∣gainst the enemy, whom they rejoice to see him attack in his turn, and are as real∣ly gratified by his revenge, provided it is not immoderate, as if the injury had been done to themselves.</P>
<P>But though the utility of those passions to the individual, by rendering it dan∣gerous to insult or injure him, be ac∣knowledged; and though their utility to the publick, as the guardians of justice, and of the equality of its administration, be not less considerable, as shall be shewn hereafter; yet there is still something dis∣agreeable in the passions themselves, which makes the appearance of them in other men the natural object of our aversion.
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
The expression of anger towards any body present, if it exceeds a bare intimation that we are sensible of his ill usage, is regarded not only as an insult to that par∣ticular person, but as a rudeness to the whole company. Respect for them ought to have restrained us from giving way to so boisterous and offensive an emotion. It is the remote effects of these passions which are agreeable; the immediate ef∣fects are mischief to the person against whom they are directed. But it is the immediate, and not the remote effects of objects which render them agreeable or disagreeable to the imagination. A pri∣son is certainly more useful to the publick than a palace; and the person who founds the one is generally directed by a much juster spirit of patriotism, than he who builds the other. But the immediate ef∣fects of a prison, the confinement of the wretches shut up in it, are disagreeable; and the imagination either does not take time to trace out the remote ones, or sees them at too great a distance to be much affected by them. A prison, therefore, will always be a disagreeable object; and the fitter it is for the purpose for which
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
it was intended, it will be the more so. A palace, on the contrary, will always be agreeable: yet its remote effects may of∣ten be inconvenient to the publick. It may serve to promote luxury, and set the example of the dissolution of manners. Its immediate effects, however, the con∣veniency, the pleasure and the gaiety of the people who live in it, being all agree∣able, and suggesting to the imagination a thousand agreeable ideas, that faculty gene∣rally rests upon them, and seldom goes fur∣ther in tracing its more distant conse∣quences. Trophies of the instruments of musick or of agriculture, imitated in painting or in stucco, make a common and an agreeable ornament of our halls and dining-rooms. A trophy of the same kind, composed of the instruments of surgery, of dissecting, and amputation-knives; of saws for cutting the bones, of trepanning instruments, &amp;c. would be ab∣surd and shocking. Instruments of sur∣gery, however, are always more finely polished, and generally more nicely adapt∣ed to the purposes for which they are intended, than instruments of agricul∣ture. The remote effects of them too,
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
the health of the patient, is agreeable; yet as the immediate effect of them is pain and suffering, the sight of them always dis∣pleases us. Instruments of war are agree∣able, tho' their immediate effect may seem to be in the same manner pain and suf∣fering. But then it is the pain and suf∣fering of our enemies, with whom we have no sympathy; and, with regard to us, they are immediately connected with the agreeable ideas of courage, victory, and honour. They are themselves, there∣fore, supposed to make one of the noblest parts of dress, and the imitation of them one of the finest ornaments of architec∣ture. It is the same case with the quali∣ties of the mind. The antient stoics were of opinion, that as the world was governed by the all-ruling providence of a wise, powerful, and good God, every single event ought to be regarded, as mak∣ing a necessary part of the plan of the universe, and as tending to promote the general order and happiness of the whole: that the vices and follies of mankind, therefore, made as necessary a part of this plan as their wisdom or their virtue; and by that eternal art which educes good
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
from ill, were made to tend equally to the prosperity and perfection of the great system of nature. No speculation of this kind, however, how deeply so∣ever it might be rooted in the mind, could diminish our natural abhorrence for vice, whose immediate effects are so destructive, and whose remote ones are too distant to be traced by the imagination.</P>
<P>It is the same case with those passions we have been just now considering. Their immediate effects are so disagreeable, that even when they are most justly provoked; there is still something about them which dis∣gusts us. These, therefore, are the only passions of which the expressions, as I for∣merly observed, do not dispose and prepare us to sympathize with them, before we are informed of the cause which excites them. The plaintive voice of misery, when heard at a distance, will not allow us to be indifferent about the person from whom it comes. As soon as it strikes our ear, it interests us in his fortune, and, if continu∣ed, forces us almost involuntarily to fly to his assistance. The sight of a smiling countenance, in the same manner, elevates even the pensive into that gay and airy
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
mood, which disposes him to sympathize with, and share the joy which it expres∣ses; and he feels his heart, which with thought and care was before that shrunk and depressed, instantly expanded and elated. But it is quite otherwise with the expressions of hatred and resentment. The hoarse, boisterous, and discordant voice of anger, when heard at a distance, inspires us either with fear or aversion. We do not fly towards it, as to one who cries out with pain and agony. Women, and men of weak nerves, tremble and are overcome with fear, tho' sensible that themselves are not the objects of the anger. They con∣ceive fear, however, by putting themselves in the situation of the person who is so. Even those of stouter hearts are disturb∣ed; not indeed enough to make them a∣fraid, but enough to make them angry; for anger is the passion which they would feel in the situation of the other person. It is the same case with hatred. Mere expressions of spite inspire it against no body, but the man who uses them. Both these passions are by nature the ob∣jects of our aversion. Their disagreeable and boisterous appearance never excites,
<PB N="76" REF="87" MS="y"/>
never prepares, and often disturbs our sympathy. Grief does not more powerful∣ly engage and attract us to the person in whom we observe it, than these, while we are ignorant of their cause, disgust and de∣tach us from him. It was, it seems, the intention of nature, that those rougher and more unamiable emotions, which drive men from one another, should be less ea∣sily and more rarely communicated.</P>
<P>When music imitates the modulations of grief or joy, it either actually inspires us with those passions, or at least puts us in the mood which disposes us to conceive them. But when it imitates the notes of anger, it inspires us with fear. Joy, grief, love, admiration, devotion, are all of them passions which are naturally musical. Their natural tones are all soft, clear, and melo∣dious; and they naturally express them∣selves in periods which are distinguished by regular pauses, and which upon that ac∣count are easily adapted to the regular re∣turns of the correspondent airs of a tune. The voice of anger, on the contrary, and of all the passions which are akin to it, is harsh and discordant. Its periods too are all irregular, sometimes very long, and
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
sometimes very short, and distinguished by no regular pauses. It is with difficulty, therefore, that music can imitate any of those passions; and the music which does imitate them is not the most agreeable. A whole entertainment may consist, without any impropriety, of the imitation of the social and agreeable passions. It would be a strange entertainment which consisted altogether of the imitations of hatred and resentment.</P>
<P>If those passions are disagreeable to the spectator, they are not less so to the person who feels them. Hatred and anger are the greatest poison to the happiness of a good mind. There is, in the very feeling of those passions, something harsh, jarring, and convulsive, something that tears and distracts the breast, and is al∣together destructive of that composure and tranquillity of mind which is so necessary to happiness, and which is best promoted by the contrary passions of gratitude and love. It is not the value of what they lose by the perfidy and ingratitude of those they live with, which the generous and humane are most apt to regret. What∣ever they may have lost, they can gene∣rally
<PB N="76" REF="89" MS="y"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="77" REF="90"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="78" REF="91" MS="y"/>
be very happy without it. What most disturbs them is the idea of per∣fidy and ingratitude exercised towards themselves; and the discordant and dis∣agreeable passions which this excites, con∣stitutes, in their own opinion, the chief part of the injury that they suffer.</P>
<P>How many things are requisite to ren∣der the gratification of resentment com∣pleatly agreeable, and to make the spec∣tator thoroughly sympathise with our re∣venge? The provocation must first of all be such that we should become con∣temptible, and be exposed to perpetual in∣sults, if we did not, in some measure, re∣sent it. Smaller offences are always bet∣ter neglected; nor is there any thing more despicable than that froward and captious humour which takes fire upon every slight occasion of quarrel. We should resent more from a sense of the propriety of resentment, from a sense that mankind expect and require it of us, than because we feel in ourselves the furies of that disagreeable passion. There is no passion, of which the human mind is ca∣pable, concerning whose justness we ought to be so doubtful, concerning whose indul∣gence
<PB N="79" REF="92" MS="y"/>
we ought so carefully to consult our natural sense of propriety, or so diligently to consider what will be the sentiments of the cool, and impartial spectator. Mag∣nanimity, or a regard to maintain our own rank and dignity in society, is the only motive which can ennoble the expres∣sions of this disagreeable passion. This motive must characterize our whole stile and deportment. These must be plain, open, and direct; determined without posi∣tiveness, and elevated without insolence; not only free from petulance and low scurrility, but generous, candid, and full of all proper regards, even for the person who has offended us. It must ap∣pear, in short, from our whole manner, without our labouring affectedly to express it, that passion has not extinguished our humanity; and that if we yield to the dictates of revenge, it is with reluctance, from necessity, and in consequence of great and repeated provocations. When resent∣ment is guarded and qualified in this manner, it may be admitted to be even generous and noble.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the social passions.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is a divided sympathy which renders this whole set of passions, upon most occasions, so ungraceful and disagreeable; so there is another set op∣posite to these, which a redoubled sym∣pathy renders almost always peculiarly agreeable and becoming. Generosity, hu∣manity, kindness, compassion, mutual friendship and esteem, all the social and benevolent affections, when expressed in the countenance or behaviour, even to∣wards those who are peculiarly connected with ourselves, please the indifferent spec∣tator upon almost every occasion. His sympathy with the person who feels those passions, exactly coincides with his concern for the person who is the object of them. The interest, which, as a man, he is obliged to take in the happiness of this last, enlivens his fellow-feeling with the sentiments of the other, whose emotions are employed about the same object. We have always, therefore, the strongest dis∣position
<PB N="81" REF="94"/>
to sympathise with the benevolent affections. They appear in every respect agreeable to us. We enter into the sa∣tisfaction both of the person who feels them, and of the person who is the ob∣ject of them. For as to be the object of hatred and indignation gives more pain than all the evil which a brave man can fear from his enemies; so there is a satisfaction in the consciousness of be∣ing beloved, which, to a person of deli∣cacy and sensibility, is of more import∣ance to happiness than all the advantage which he can expect to derive from it. What character is so detestable as that of one who takes pleasure to sow dis∣sention among friends, and to turn their most tender love into mortal hatred? Yet wherein does the atrocity of this so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bhorred injury consist? Is it in de∣priving them of the frivolous good offi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which, had their friendship continued, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey might have expected from one ano∣ther? It is in depriving them of that friend∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip itself, in robbing them of each others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffections, from which both derived so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atisfaction; it is in disturbing the har∣mony of their hearts, and putting an end
<PB N="82" REF="95"/>
to that happy commerce which had before subsisted between them. These affections, that harmony, this commerce, are felt, not only by the tender and the delicate, but by the rudest vulgar of mankind, to be of more importance to happiness than all the little services which could be expected to flow from them.</P>
<P>The sentiment of love is, in itself, agree∣able to the person who feels it, it sooths and composes the breast, seems to favour the vital motions, and to promote the healthful state of the human constitution; and it is rendered still more delightful by the consciousness of the gratitude and satisfaction which it must excite in him who is the object of it. Their mutual regard renders them happy in one ano∣ther, and sympathy, with this mutual re∣gard, makes them agreeable to every other person.

<PB N="83" REF="96" MS="y"/>
freedom and fondness, mutual raillery, and mutual kindness, show that no op∣position of interests divides the brothers, nor any rivalship of favour sets the sisters at variance, and where every thing pre∣sents us with the idea of peace, chear∣fulness, harmony, and contentment. On the contrary, how uneasy are we made when we go into a house in which jar∣ring contention sets one half of those who dwell in it against the other; where amidst affected smoothness and complai∣sance, suspicious looks and sudden starts of passion betray the mutual jealousies which burn within them, and which are every moment ready to burst out through all the restraints which the presence of the company imposes.</P>
<P>Those amiable passions, even when they are acknowledged to be excessive, are ne∣ver regarded with aversion. There is something agreeable even in the weakness of friendship and humanity. The too tender mother, the too indulgent father, the too generous and affectionate friend, may sometimes, perhaps, on account of the softness of their natures, be looked upon with a species of pity, in which,
<PB N="84" REF="97"/>
however, there is a mixture of love, but can never be regarded with hatred and aversion, nor even with contempt, unless by the most brutal and worthless of man∣kind. It is always with concern, with sympathy and kindness, that we blame them for the extravagance of their attach∣ment. There is a helplessness in the cha∣racter of extreme humanity which more than any thing interests our pity. There is nothing in itself which renders it ei∣ther ungraceful or disagreeable. We only regret that it is unfit for the world, be∣cause the world is unworthy of it, and be∣cause it must expose the person who is en∣dowed with it as a prey to the perfidy and in∣gratitude of insinuating falshood, and to a thousand pains and uneasinesses, which, of all men, he the least deserves to feel, and which generally too he is, of all men, the least capable of supporting. It is quite otherwise with hatred and resent∣ment. Too violent a propensity to those detestable passions, renders a person the object of universal dread and abhorrence, who, like a wild beast, ought, we think, to be hunted out of all civil society.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the selfish passions.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES those two opposite sets of passions, the social and unsocial, there is another which holds a sort of middle place between them; is never ei∣ther so graceful as is sometimes the one set, nor is ever so odious as is sometimes the other. Grief and joy, when conceiv∣ed upon account of our own private good or bad fortune, constitute this third set of passions. Even when excessive, they are never so disagreeable as excessive resent∣ment, because no opposite sympathy can ever interest us against them: and when most suitable to their objects they are never so agreeable as impartial humanity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust benevolence; because no double sym∣pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> can ever interest us for them. There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, however, this difference between grief and joy, that we are generally most dis∣posed to sympathise with small joys and great sorrows. The man, who by some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udden revolution of fortune is lifted up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll at once into a condition of life, greatly
<PB N="86" REF="99"/>
above what he had formerly lived in, may be assured that the congratulations of his best friends are not all of them perfectly sincere. An upstart, though of the greatest merit, is generally disagreeable, and a sentiment of envy commonly pre∣vents us from heartily sympathising with his joy. If he has any judgment he is sensible of this, and instead of appear∣ing to be elated with his good fortune, he endeavours, as much as he can, to smother his joy, and keep down that elevation of mind with which his new circumstances naturally inspire him. He affects the same plainness of dress, and the same modesty of behaviour, which became him in his former station. He redoubles his attention to his old friends, and endea∣vours more than ever to be humble, as∣siduous, and complaisant. And this is the behaviour which in his situation we most approve of; because we expect, it seems, that he should have more sympa∣thy with our envy and aversion to his happiness, than we have with his hap∣piness. It is seldom that with all this he succeeds. We suspect the sincerity of his humility, and he grows weary of this
<PB N="87" REF="100" MS="y"/>
constraint. In a little time, therefore, he generally leaves all his old friends behind him, some of the meanest of them ex∣cepted, who may, perhaps, condescend to become his dependents: nor does he al∣ways acquire any new ones; the pride of his new connections is as much affront∣ed at finding him their equal, as that of his old ones had been by his becoming their superior: and it requires the most obstinate and persevering modesty to at∣tone for this mortification to either. He generally grows weary too soon, and is provoked by the sullen and suspicious pride of the one, and by the saucy contempt of the other, to treat the first with neglect, and the second with pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lance, till at last he grows habitually insolent, and forfeits the esteem of all. If the chief part of human happiness arises from the consciousness of being beloved, as I believe it does, those sudden changes of fortune seldom contribute much to happi∣ness. He is happiest who advances more gradually to greatness, whom the public destines to every step of his preferment long before he arrives at it, in whom, upon that account, when it comes, it
<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
can excite no extravagant joy, and with regard to whom it cannot reasonably create either any jealousy in those he overtakes, or any envy in those he leaves behind.</P>
<P>Mankind, however, more readily sym∣pathise with those smaller joys which flow from less important causes. It is decent to be humble amidst great pros∣perity; but we can scarce express too much satisfaction in all the little occurrences of common life, in the company with which we spent the evening last night, in the entertainment that was set before us, in what was said and what was done, in all the little incidents of the present con∣versation, and in all those frivolous nothings which fill up the void of human life. Nothing is more graceful than habitual chearfulness, which is always founded up∣on a peculiar relish for all the little plea∣sures which common occurrences afford. We readily sympathise with it: it inspires us with the same joy, and makes every trifle turn up to us in the same agreeable aspect in which it presents itself to the person endowed with this happy dispo∣sition. Hence it is that youth, the sea∣son
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
of gaiety, so easily engages our affec∣tions. That propensity to joy which seems even to animate the bloom, and to sparkle from the eyes of youth and beauty, tho' in a person of the same sex, exalts, even the aged, to a more joyous mood than ordinary. They forget, for a time, their infirmities, and abandon themselves to those agreeable ideas and emotions to which they have long been strangers, but which, when the presence of so much happiness recalls them to their breast, take their place there, like old acquaint∣ance, from whom they are sorry to have ever been parted, and whom they em∣brace more heartily upon account of this long separation.</P>
<P>It is quite otherwise with grief. Small vexations excite no sympathy, but deep affliction calls forth the greatest. The man who is made uneasy by every little disagreeable incident, who is hurt if either the cook or the butler have failed in the least article of their duty, who feels every defect in the highest ceremonial of polite∣ness, whether it be shewn to himself or to any other person, who takes it amiss that his intimate friend did not bid him
<PB N="90" REF="103"/>
good-morrow when they met in the fore∣noon, and that his brother hummed a tune all the time he himself was telling a story; who is put out of humour by the badness of the weather when in the country, by the badness of the roads when upon a journey, and by the want of company, and dullness of all public diversions when in town; such a person, I say, though he should have some reason, will seldom meet with much sympathy. Joy is a pleasant emotion, and we gladly abandon ourselves to it upon the slightest occasion. We readily, therefore, sympa∣thise with it in others, whenever we are not prejudiced by envy. But grief is pain∣ful, and the mind, even when it is our own misfortune, naturally resists and re∣coils from it. We would endeavour ei∣ther not to conceive it at all, or to shake it off as soon as we have conceived it. Our aversion to grief will not, indeed, always hinder us from conceiving it in our own case upon very trifling occasions, but it constantly prevents us from sympathising with it in others when excited by the like frivolous causes: for our sympathetic pas∣sions are always less irresistible than our
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
original ones. There is, besides, a malice in mankind, which not only prevents all sympathy with little uneasinesses, but renders them in some measure diverting. Hence the delight which we all take in raillery, and in the small vexation which we observe in our companion, when he is pushed, and urged, and teased upon all sides. Men of the most ordinary good breeding dissemble the pain which any little in∣cident may give them, and those who are more thoroughly formed to society, turn, of their own accord, all such inci∣dents into raillery, as they know their com∣panions will do for them. The habit which a man, who lives in the world, has acquired of considering how every thing that concerns himself will appear to others, makes those frivolous calamities turn up in the same ridiculous light to him, in which he knows they will cer∣tainly be considered by them.</P>
<P>Our sympathy, on the contrary, with deep distress, is very strong and very sin∣cere. It is unnecessary to give an in∣stance. We weep even at the feigned representation of a tragedy. If you labour, therefore, under any signal calamity, if
<PB N="92" REF="105" MS="y"/>
by some extraordinary misfortune you are fallen into poverty, into diseases, into disgrace and disappointment; even though your own fault may have been, in part, the occasion, yet you may generally de∣pend upon the sincerest sympathy of all your friends, and, as far as interest and honour will permit, upon their kindest assistance too. But if your misfortune is not of this dreadful kind, if you have only been a little baulked in your am∣bition, if you have only been jilted by your mistress, or only hen-pecked by your wife, lay your account with the raillery of all your acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Of the effects of prosperity and adver∣sity upon the judgment of mankind with regard to the propriety of action; and why it is more easy to obtain their approbation in the one state than in the other.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That though our sympathy with sorrow is generally a more lively sensation than our sympathy with joy, it commonly falls much more short of the violence of what is felt by the person prin∣cipally concerned.</HEAD>
<P>OUR sympathy with sorrow, though not more real, has been more taken notice of than our sympathy with joy. The word sympathy, in its most proper and primitive signification, denotes our fellow-feeling with the sufferings, not that with the enjoyments, of others. A late ingenious and subtile philosopher thought it necessary to prove, by arguments, that
<PB N="94" REF="107" MS="y"/>
we had a real sympathy with joy, and that congratulation was a principle of human nature. No body, I believe, ever thought it necessary to prove that com∣passion was such.</P>
<P>First of all, our sympathy with sor∣row is, in some sense, more universal than that with joy. Though sorrow is exces∣sive, we may still have some fellow-feel∣ing with it. What we feel does not, in∣deed, in this case, amount to that com∣pleat sympathy, to that perfect harmony and correspondence of sentiments which con∣stitutes approbation. We do not weep, and exclaim, and lament, with the suf∣ferer. We are sensible, on the contrary, of his weakness and of the extravagance of his passion, and yet often feel a very sensible concern upon his account. But if we do not intirely enter into, and go along with, the joy of another, we have no sort of regard or fellow-feeling for it. The man who skips and dances about with that intemperate and senseless joy which we cannot accompany him in, is the object of our contempt and indig∣nation.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="108"/>Pain besides, whether of mind or body, is a more pungent sensation than plea∣sure, and our sympathy with pain, though it falls greatly short of what is naturally felt by the sufferer, is generally a more lively and distinct perception than our sympathy with pleasure, though this last often approaches more nearly, as I shall show immediately, to the natural viva∣city of the original passion.</P>
<P>Over and above all this, we often struggle to keep down our sympathy with the sor∣row of others. Whenever we are not under the observation of the sufferer, we endeavour, for our own sake, to suppress it as much as we can, and we are not always successful. The opposition which we make to it, and the reluctance with which we yield to it, necessarily oblige us to take more particular notice of it. But we never have occasion to make this opposition to our sympathy with joy. If there is any envy in the case, we never feel the least propensity towards it; and if there is none, we give way to it without any reluctance. On the contrary, as we are always ashamed of our own envy, we often pretend, and sometimes really
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
wish to sympathise with the joy of others, when by that disagreeable sentiment we are disqualified from doing so. We are glad, we say, upon account of our neigh∣bour's good fortune, when in our hearts, perhaps, we are really sorry. We often feel a sympathy with sorrow when we would wish to be rid of it; and we often miss that with joy when we would be glad to have it. The obvious observa∣tion, therefore, which it naturally falls in our way to make, is that our pro∣pensity to sympathise with sorrow must be very strong, and our inclination to sympathise with joy very weak.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this prejudice, how∣ever, I will venture to affirm, that, when there is no envy in the case, our propen∣sity to sympathise with joy is much stronger than our propensity to sympathise with sorrow; and that our fellow-feeling for the agreeable emotion approaches much more nearly to the vivacity of what is naturally felt by the persons principally concerned, than that which we conceive for the painful one.</P>
<P>We have some indulgence for that ex∣cessive grief which we cannot entirely go
<PB N="97" REF="110"/>
along with. We know what a prodigious effort is requisite before the sufferer can bring down his emotions to compleat har∣mony and concord with those of the spectator. Though he fails, therefore, we easily pardon him. But we have no such indulgence for the intemperance of joy; be∣cause we are not conscious that any such vast effort is requisite to bring it down to what we can intirely enter into. The man who, under the greatest calamities, can command his sorrow, seems worthy of the highest admiration; but he who, in the fulness of prosperity, can in the same manner master his joy, seems hardly to de∣serve any praise. We are sensible that there is a much wider interval in the one case than in the other, between what is naturally felt by the person principally con∣cerned, and what the spectator can in∣tirely go along with.</P>
<P>What can be added to the happiness of the man who is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear conscience? To one in this situation, all accessions of fortune may properly be said to be super∣fluous: and if he is much elevated upon account of them, it must be the effect of
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
the most frivolous levity. This situation, however, may very well be called the na∣tural and ordinary state of mankind. Notwithstanding the present misery and depravity of the world, so justly lament∣ed, this really is the state of the greater part of men. The greater part of men, therefore, cannot find any great difficulty in elevating themselves to all the joy which any accession to this situation can well ex∣cite in their companion.</P>
<P>But though little can be added to this state, much may be taken from it. Tho' between this condition and the highest pitch of human prosperity, the interval is but a trifle; between it and the lowest depth of misery the distance is immense and pro∣digious. Adversity, upon this account, ne∣cessarily depresses the mind of the sufferer much more below its natural state, than prosperity can elevate him above it. The spectator, therefore, must find it much more difficult to sympathise entirely, and keep perfect time, with his sorrow, than thoroughly to enter into his joy, and must depart much further from his own na∣tural and ordinary temper of mind in the one case than in the other. It is upon this account, that, though our sympathy
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
with sorrow is often a more pungent sen∣sation than our sympathy with joy, it al∣ways falls much more short of the violence of what is naturally felt by the person principally concerned.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to sympathise with joy; and wherever envy does not oppose it, our heart abandons itself with satisfaction to the highest transports of that delightful sentiment. But it is painful to go along with grief, and we always enter into it with reluctance. When we attend to the representation of a tragedy, we struggle against that sympathetic sorrow which the entertainment inspires as long as we can, and we give way to it at last only when we can no longer avoid it: we even then endea∣vour to cover our concern from the com∣pany. If we shed any tears, we carefully conceal them, and are afraid lest the specta∣tors, not entering into this excessive ten∣derness, should regard it as effeminacy and weakness. The wretch whose misfortunes call upon our compassion feels with what reluctance we are likely to enter into his sorrow, and therefore proposes his grief to us with fear and hesitation: he even smothers the half of it, and is ashamed,
<PB N="100" REF="113" MS="y"/>
upon account of this hard-heartedness of mankind, to give vent to the fulness of his affliction. It is otherwise with the man who riots in joy and success. Wherever envy does not interest us against him, he expects our compleatest sympathy. He does not fear, therefore, to enounce him∣self with shouts of exultation, in full con∣fidence that we are heartily disposed to go along with him.</P>
<P>Why should we be more ashamed to weep than to laugh before company? We may often have as real occasion to do the one as to do the other: but we always feel that the spectators are more likely to go along with us in the agreeable, than in the pain∣ful emotion. It is always miserable to complain, even when we are oppressed by the most dreadful calamities. But the tri∣umph of victory is not always ungraceful. Prudence, indeed, would often advise us to bear our prosperity with more moderation; because prudence would teach us to avoid that envy which this very triumph is, more than any thing, apt to excite.</P>
<P>How hearty are the acclamations of the mob, who never bear any envy to their superiors, at a triumph or a public entry?
<PB N="101" REF="114"/>
And how sedate and moderate is commonly their grief at an execution? Our sorrow at a funeral generally amounts to no more than an affected gravity; but our mirth at a christening, or a marriage, is always from the heart, and without any affectation. Up∣on these, and all such joyous occasions, our satisfaction, though not so durable, is often as lively as that of the persons principally concerned. Whenever we cordially con∣gratulate our friends, which, however, to the disgrace of human nature, we do but seldom, their joy literally becomes our joy: we are, for the moment, as happy as they are: our heart swells and overflows with real pleasure: joy and complacency sparkle from our eyes, and animate every feature of our countenance, and every gesture of our body.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, when we condole with our friends in their afflictions, how little do we feel, in comparison of what they feel? We sit down by them, we look at them, and while they relate to us the circumstances of their misfortune, we listen to them with gravity and attention. But while their narration is every moment in∣terrupted by those natural bursts of passion
<PB N="102" REF="115" MS="y"/>
which often seem almost to choak them in the midst of it; how far are the languid emotions of our hearts from keeping time to the transports of theirs? We may be sensible, at the same time, that their passion is natural, and no greater than what we ourselves might feel upon the like occasion. We may even inwardly reproach ourselves with our own want of sensibility, and per∣haps, upon that account, work ourselves up into an artificial sympathy, which, how∣ever, when it is raised, is always the slight∣est and most transitory imaginable; and generally, as soon as we have left the room, vanishes, and is gone forever. Nature, it seems, when she loaded us with our own sorrows, thought that they were enough, and therefore did not command us to take any further share in those of others, than what was necessary to prompt us to relieve them.</P>
<P>It is upon account of this dull sensibility to the afflictions of others, that magna∣nimity amidst great distress appears always so divinely graceful. His behaviour is genteel and agreeable who can maintain his chearfulness amidst a number of frivo∣lous disasters. But he appears to be more
<PB N="103" REF="116"/>
than mortal who can support in the same manner the most dreadful calamities. We feel what an immense effort is requisite to silence those violent emotions which natu∣rally agitate and distract those in his situa∣tion. We are amazed to find that he can command himself so intirely. His firmness, at the same time, perfectly coincides with our insensibility. He makes no demand upon us for that more exquisite degree of sensibility which we find, and which we are mortified to find, that we do not pos∣sess. There is the most perfect correspon∣dence between his sentiments and ours, and upon that account the most perfect pro∣priety in his behaviour. It is a propriety too, which, from our experience of the usual weakness of human nature, we could not reasonably have expected he should be able to maintain. We wonder with sur∣prise and astonishment at that strength of mind which is capable of so noble and ge∣nerous an effort. The sentiment of com∣pleat sympathy and approbation, mixed and animated with wonder and surprise, con∣stitutes what is properly called admiration, as has already been more than once taken notice of. Cato, surrounded on all sides
<PB N="104" REF="117"/>
by his enemies, unable to resist them, dis∣daining to submit to them, and reduced, by the proud maxims of that age, to the neces∣sity of destroying himself; yet never shrink∣ing from his misfortunes, never supplicating with the lamentable voice of wretchedness, those miserable sympathetic tears which we are always so unwilling to give; but on the contrary, arming himself with manly forti∣tude, and the moment before he executes his fatal resolution, giving, with his usual tran∣quillity, all necessary orders for the safety of his friends; appears to Seneca, that great preacher of insensibility, a spectacle which even the gods themselves might behold with pleasure and admiration.</P>
<P>Whenever we meet, in common life, with any examples of such heroic magna∣nimity, we are always extremely affected. We are more apt to weep and shed tears for such as, in this manner, seem to feel no∣thing for themselves, than for those who give way to all the weakness of sorrow: and in this particular case, the sympathe∣tic grief of the spectator appears to go be∣yond the original passion in the person principally concerned. The friends of So∣crates all wept when he drank the last
<PB N="105" REF="118"/>
potion, while he himself expressed the gaiest and most chearful tranquillity. Upon all such occasions the spectator makes no ef∣fort, and has no occasion to make any, in order to conquer his sympathetic sorrow. He is under no fear that it will transport him to any thing that is extravagant and improper; he is rather pleased with the sen∣sibility of his own heart, and gives way to it with complacence and self-approbation. He gladly indulges, therefore, the most melancholy views which can naturally oc∣cur to him, concerning the calamity of his friend, for whom, perhaps, he never felt so exquisitely before, the tender and tear∣ful passion of love. But it is quite other∣wise with the person principally concerned. He is obliged, as much as possible, to turn away his eyes from whatever is either na∣turally terrible or disagreeable in his situa∣tion. Too serious an attention to those circumstances, he fears, might make so vi∣olent an impression upon him, that he could no longer keep within the bounds of mode∣ration, or render himself the object of the compleat sympathy and approbation of the spectators. He fixes his thoughts, there∣fore, upon those only which are agreeable,
<PB N="106" REF="119" MS="y"/>
the applause and admiration which he is about to deserve by the heroic magnani∣mity of his behaviour. To feel that he is capable of so noble and generous an effort, to feel that in this dreadful situation he can still act as he would desire to act, ani∣mates and transports him with joy, and enables him to support that triumphant gaiety which seems to exult in the vic∣tory that he thus gains over his misfor∣tunes.</P>
<P>On the contrary, he always appears, in some measure, mean and despicable, who is sunk in sorrow and dejection upon ac∣count of any calamity of his own. We cannot bring ourselves to feel for him what he feels for himself, and what, per∣haps, we should feel for ourselves if in his situation: we, therefore, despise him; un∣justly, perhaps, if any sentiment could be regarded as unjust, to which we are by na∣ture irresistibly determined. The weakness of sorrow never appears in any respect agree∣able, except when it arises from what we feel for others more than from what we feel for ourselves. A son, upon the death of an indulgent and respectable father, may give way to it without much blame. His sor∣row
<PB N="107" REF="120"/>
is chiefly founded upon a sort of sympa∣thy with his departed parent; and we readily enter into this humane emotion. But if he should indulge the same weakness upon ac∣count of any misfortune which affected him∣self only, he would no longer meet with any such indulgence. If he should be reduced to beggary and ruin, if he should be expos∣ed to the most dreadful dangers, if he should even be led out to a public execution, and there shed one single tear upon the scaffold, he would disgrace himself forever in the opi∣nion of all the gallant and generous part of mankind. Their compassion for him, however, would be very strong, and very sincere; but as it would still fall short of this excessive weakness, they would have no pardon for the man who could thus ex∣pose himself in the eyes of the world. His behaviour would affect them with shame rather than with sorrow; and the dishonour which he had thus brought upon himself would appear to them the most lamentable circumstance in his misfortune. How did it disgrace the memory of the intrepid Duke of Byron, who had so often braved death in the field, that he wept upon the scaf∣fold, when he beheld the state to which he
<PB N="108" REF="121"/>
was fallen, and remembered the favour and the glory from which his own rash∣ness had so unfortunately thrown him.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the origin of ambition, and of the distinction of ranks.</HEAD>
<P>IT is because mankind are disposed to sympathise more entirely with our joy than with our sorrow, that we make parade of our riches, and conceal our poverty. Nothing is so mortifying as to be obliged to expose our distress to the view of the pub∣lic, and to feel, that though our situation is open to the eyes of all mankind, no mor∣tal conceives for us the half of what we suffer. Nay, it is chiefly from this regard to the sentiments of mankind, that we pur∣sue riches and avoid poverty. For to what purpose is all the toil and bustle of this world? what is the end of avarice and am∣bition, of the pursuit of wealth, of power, and preheminence? Is it to supply the ne∣cessities of nature? The wages of the meanest labourer can supply them. We see that they afford him food and cloath∣ing,
<PB N="109" REF="122"/>
the comfort of a house, and of a fa∣mily. If we examine his oeconomy with rigor, we shall find that he spends a great part of them upon conveniencies, which may be regarded as superfluities, and that, upon extraordinary occasions, he can give something even to vanity and distinction. What then is the cause of our aversion to his situation, and why should those who have been educated in the highest ranks of life, regard it as worse than death, to be reduced to live, even without labour, upon the same simple fare with him, to dwell under the same lowly roof, and to be cloath∣ed in the same humble attire? Do they ima∣gine that their stomach is better, or their sleep sounder in a palace than in a cottage? The contrary has been so often observed, and, indeed, is so very obvious, though it had never been observed, that there is no∣body ignorant of it. From whence, then, arises that emulation which runs through all the different ranks of men, and what are the advantages which we propose by that great purpose of human life which we call bettering our condition? To be observ∣ed, to be attended to, to be taken notice of with sympathy, complacency and ap∣probation,
<PB N="110" REF="123"/>
are all the advantages which we can propose to derive from it. It is the vanity, not the ease, or the pleasure, which interests us. But vanity is always founded upon the belief of our being the object of attention and approbation. The rich man glories in his riches, because he feels that they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world, and that mankind are dis∣posed to go along with him in all those agreeable emotions with which the advan∣tages of his situation so readily inspire him. At the thought of this, his heart seems to swell and dilate itself within him, and he is fonder of his wealth, upon this account, than for all the other advantages it procures him. The poor man, on the contrary, is ashamed of his poverty. He feels that it either places him out of the sight of man∣kind, or, that if they take any notice of him, they have, however, scarce any fel∣low-feeling with the misery and distress which he suffers. He is mortified upon both accounts; for though to be overlook∣ed, and to be disapproved of, are things entirely different, yet as obscurity covers us from the daylight of honour and ap∣probation, to feel that we are taken no
<PB N="111" REF="124" MS="y"/>
notice of, necessarily damps the most agree∣able hope, and disappoints the most ardent desire, of human nature. The poor man goes out and comes in unheeded, and when in the midst of a croud is in the same obscuri∣ty as if shut up in his own hovel. Those hum∣ble cares and painful attentions which occu∣py those in his situation, afford no amuse∣ment to the dissipated and the gay. They turn away their eyes from him, or if the extremity of his distress forces them to look at him, it is only to spurn so disagreeable an object from among them. The fortu∣nate and the proud wonder at the insolence of human wretchedness, that it should dare to present itself before them, and with the loathsome aspect of its misery, presume to disturb the serenity of their happiness. The man of rank and distinction, on the contrary, is observed by all the world. Every body is eager to look at him, and to conceive, at least by sympathy, that joy and exultation with which his circum∣stances naturally inspire him. His actions are the objects of the public care. Scarce a word, scarce a gesture, can fall from him that is altogether neglected. In a great assembly he is the person upon whom all
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
direct their eyes; it is upon him that their passions seem all to wait with expectation, in order to receive that movement and di∣rection which he shall impress upon them; and, if his behaviour is not altogether absurd, he has, every moment, an opportu∣nity of interesting mankind, and of render∣ing himself the object of the observation and fellow-feeling of every body about him. It is this, which, notwithstanding the re∣straint it imposes, notwithstanding the loss of liberty with which it is attended, renders greatness the object of envy, and compen∣sates, in the opinion of mankind, all that toil, all that anxiety, all those mortifica∣tions which must be undergone in the pur∣suit of it; and what is of yet more conse∣quence, all that leisure, all that ease, all that careless security, which are forfeited forever by the acquisition.</P>
<P>When we consider the condition of the great, in those delusive colours in which the imagination is apt to paint it, it seems to be almost the abstract idea of a perfect and happy state. It is the very state which, in all our waking dreams and idle reveries, we had sketched out to ourselves as the final object of all our desires. We
<PB N="113" REF="126"/>
feel, therefore, a peculiar sympathy with the satisfaction of these who are in it. We favour all their inclinations, and forward all their wishes. What pity, we think, that any thing should spoil and corrupt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o agreeable a situation! We could even wish them immortal; and it seems hard to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that death should at last put an end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o such perfect enjoyment. It is cruel, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink, in nature, to compel them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir exalted stations, to that humble, but hospitable home, which she has provided for all her children. Great King, live for ever! is the compliment, which, after the manner of eastern adulation, we should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadily make them, if experience did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each us its absurdity. Every calamity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat befals them, every injury that is done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, excites in the breast of the spectator <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en times more compassion and resentment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han he would have felt, had the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings happened to other men. It is the misfortunes of Kings only which afford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he proper subjects for tragedy. They re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emble, in this respect, the misfortunes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overs. Those two situations are the chief which interest us upon the theatre; be∣cause, in spite of all that reason and expe∣rience
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
can tell us to the contrary, the pre∣judices of the imagination attach to these two states a happiness superior to any other. To disturb, or to put an end to such per∣fect enjoyment, seems to be the most atro∣cious of all injuries. The traitor who conspires against the life of his monarch, is thought a greater monster than any other murderer. All the innocent blood that was shed in the civil wars, provoked less indignation than the death of Charles I. A stranger to human nature, who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their inferiors, and the regret and in∣dignation which they feel for the misfor∣tunes and sufferings of those above them, would be apt to imagine, that pain must be more agonizing, and the convulsions of death more terrible to persons of high rank, than to those of meaner stations.</P>
<P>Upon this disposition of mankind, to go along with all the passions of the rich and the powerful, is founded the distinction of ranks, and the order of society. Our obsequiousness to our superiors more fre∣quently arises from our admiration for the advantages of their situation, than from
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
any private expectations of benefits from their good-will. Their benefits can extend but to a few; but their fortunes interest almost every body. We are eager to assist them in compleating a system of happiness that approaches so near to perfection; and we desire to serve them for their own sake, without any other recompence but the va∣nity or the honour of obliging them. Nei∣ther is our deference to their inclinations founded chiefly, or altogether, upon a re∣gard to the utility of such submission, and to the order of society, which is best sup∣ported by it. Even when the order of society seems to require that we should op∣pose them, we can hardly bring ourselves to do it. That kings are the servants of the people, to be obeyed, resisted, deposed, or punished, as the public conveniency may require, is the doctrine of reason and philosophy; but it is not the doctrine of nature. Nature would teach us to sub∣mit to them, for their own sake, to tremble and bow down before their exalted station, to regard their smile as a reward sufficient to compensate any services, and to dread their displeasure, though no other evil was to follow from it, as the severest of all
<PB N="116" REF="129" MS="y"/>
mortifications. To treat them in any re∣spect as men, to reason and dispute with them upon ordinary occasions, requires such resolution, that there are few men whose magnanimity can support them in it, unless they are likewise assisted by fa∣miliarity and acquaintance. The strongest motives, the most furious passions, fear, hatred and resentment, are scarce sufficient to balance this natural disposition to re∣spect them: and their conduct must, ei∣ther justly or unjustly, have excited the highest degree of all those passions, before the bulk of the people can be brought to oppose them with violence, or to desire to see them either punished or deposed. Even when the people have been brought this length, they are apt to relent every mo∣ment, and easily relapse into their habi∣tual state of deference to those whom they have been accustomed to look upon as their natural superiors. They cannot stand the mortification of their monarch. Com∣passion soon takes the place of resentment, they forget all past provocations, their old principles of loyalty revive, and they ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to re-establish the ruined authority of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> old masters, with the same violence wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="117" REF="130"/>
which they had opposed it. The death of Charles I. brought about the Restoration of the royal family. Compassion for James II. when he was seized by the populace in mak∣ing his escape on ship-board, had almost prevented the revolution, and made it go on more heavily than before.</P>
<P>Do the great seem insensible of the easy price at which they may acquire the pub∣lic admiration; or do they seem to imagine that to them, as to other men, it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood? By what important accomplishments is the young nobleman instructed to support the dignity of his rank, and to render him∣self worthy of that superiority over his fel∣low citizens, to which the virtue of his ancestors had raised them? Is it by know∣ledge, by industry, by patience, by self-denial, or by virtue of any kind? As all his words, as all his motions are attended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, he learns an habitual regard to every circumstance of ordinary behaviour, and studies to perform all those small duties with the most exact propriety. As he is conscious how much he is observed, and how much mankind are disposed to favour all his inclinations, he acts, upon the most
<PB N="118" REF="131"/>
indifferent occasions, with that freedom and elevation which the thought of this natu∣rally inspires. His air, his manner, his de∣portment, all mark that elegant and grace∣ful sense of his own superiority, which those who are born to inferior stations can hard∣ly ever arrive at: these are the arts by which he proposes to make mankind more easily submit to his authority, and to go∣vern their inclinations according to his own pleasure: and in this he is seldom disap∣pointed. These arts, supported by rank and preheminence, are, upon ordinary oc∣casions, sufficient to govern the world. Lewis XIV. during the greater part of his reign, was regarded, not only in France, but over all Europe, as the most perfect model of a great prince. But what were the talents and virtues by which he ac∣quired this great reputation? Was it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all his undertakings, by the immense dangers and difficulties with which they were at∣tended, or by the unwearied and unre∣lenting application with which he pursued them? Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his exquisite judgment, or by his he∣roic valour? It was by none of these qua∣lities.
<PB N="119" REF="132"/>
But he was, first of all, the most powerful prince in Europe, and consequent∣ly held the highest rank among kings; and then, says his historian,
<Q>he surpassed all his courtiers in the gracefulness of his shape, and the majestic beauty of his features. The sound of his voice, noble and affecting, gained those hearts which his presence intimidated. He had a step and a deportment which could suit only him and his rank, and which would have been ridiculous in any other person. The embarassment which he occasioned to those who spoke to him, flattered that secret satisfaction with which he felt his own superiority. The old officer, who was confounded and faultered in asking him a favour, and not being able to conclude his discourse, said to him: Sir, your ma∣jesty, I hope, will believe that I do not tremble thus before your enemies: had no difficulty to obtain what he demand∣ed.</Q>
These frivolous accomplishments, supported by his rank, and, no doubt too, by a degree of other talents and virtues, which seems, however, not to have been much a∣bove mediocrity, established this prince in the esteem of his own age, and have drawn,
<PB N="120" REF="133"/>
even from posterity, a good deal of re∣spect for his memory. Compared with these, in his own times, and in his own presence, no other virtue, it seems, ap∣peared to have any merit. Knowledge, industry, valour and beneficence, trembled, were abashed, and lost all dignity before them.</P>
<P>But it is not by accomplishments of this kind, that the man of inferior rank must hope to distinguish himself. Politeness is so much the virtue of the great, that it will do little honour to any body but themselves. The coxcomb, who imitates their manner, and affects to be eminent by the superior propriety of his ordinary behaviour, is re∣warded with a double share of contempt for his folly and presumption. Why should the man, whom nobody thinks it worth while to look at, be very anxious about the manner in which he holds up his head, or disposes of his arms while he walks through a room? He is occupied surely with a very superfluous attention, and with an attention too that marks a sense of his own importance, which no other mortal can go along with. The most per∣fect modesty and plainness, joined to as
<PB N="121" REF="134"/>
much negligence as is consistent with the respect due to the company, ought to be the chief characteristics of the behaviour of a private man. If ever he hopes to dis∣tinguish himself, it must be by more im∣portant virtues. He must acquire depen∣dants to balance the dependants of the great, and he has no other fund to pay them from, but the labour of his body, and the activity of his mind. He must cultivate these therefore: he must acquire superior knowledge in his profession, and superior industry in the exercise of it. He must be patient in labour, resolute in dan∣ger, and firm in distress. These talents he must bring into publick view, by the difficulty, importance, and, at the same time, good judgment of his undertakings, and by the severe and unrelenting applica∣tion with which he pursues them. Pro∣bity and prudence, generosity and frank∣ness, must characterise his behaviour upon all ordinary occasions; and he must, at the same time, be forward to engage in all those situations, in which it requires the greatest talents and virtues to act with propriety, but in which the greatest ap∣plause is to be acquired by those who can
<PB N="122" REF="135"/>
acquit themselves with honour. With what impatience does the man of spirit and ambition, who is depressed by his situ∣ation, look round for some great opportu∣nity to distinguish himself? No circum∣stances, which can afford this, appear to him undesireable. He even looks forward with satisfaction to the prospect of foreign war, or civil dissension; and, with secret transport and delight, sees through all the confusion and bloodshed which attend them, the probability of those wished for occa∣sions presenting themselves, in which he may draw upon himself the attention and admiration of mankind. The man of rank and distinction, on the contrary, whose whole glory consists in the propriety of his ordinary behaviour, who is contented with the humble renown which this can afford him, and has no talents to acquire any other, is unwilling to embarass himself with what can be attended either with dif∣ficulty or distress. To figure at a ball is his great triumph, and to succeed in an intrigue of gallantry, his highest exploit. He has an aversion to all publick confu∣sions, not from the love of mankind, for the great never look upon their inferiors
<PB N="123" REF="136"/>
as their fellow-creatures; nor yet from want of courage, for in that he is seldom defective; but from a consciousness that he possesses none of the virtues which are re∣quired in such situations, and that the pub∣lick attention will certainly be drawn away from him by others. He may be willing to expose himself to some little danger, and to make a campaign when it happens to be the fashion. But he shudders with horror at the thought of any situation which demands the continual and long exertion of patience, industry, forti∣tude, and application of thought. These virtues are hardly ever to be met with in men who are born to those high stations. In all governments accordingly, even in monarchies, the highest offices are gene∣rally possessed, and the whole detail of the administration conducted by men who were educated in the middle and inferior ranks of life, who have been carried forward by their own industry and abilities, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaded with the jealousy, and opposed by the resentment of all those who were born their superiors, and to whom the great, after having regarded them first with con∣tempt, and afterwards with envy, are at
<PB N="124" REF="137" MS="y"/>
last contented to truckle with the same ab∣ject meanness with which they desire that the rest of mankind should behave to themselves.</P>
<P>It is the loss of this easy empire over the affections of mankind which renders the fall from greatness so insupportable. When the family of the King of Macedon was led in triumph by Paulus Aemilius, their misfortunes, it is said, made them divide with their conqueror the attention of the Roman people. The sight of the royal children, whose tender age rendered them insensible of their situation, struck the spec∣tators, amidst the public rejoicings and prosperity, with the tenderest sorrow and compassion. The King appeared next in the procession; and seemed like one con∣founded and astonished, and bereft of all sentiment, by the greatness of his cala∣mities. His friends and ministers follow∣ed after him. As they moved along, they often cast their eyes upon their fallen sove∣reign, and always burst into tears at the sight; their whole behaviour demonstrat∣ing that they thought not of their own misfortunes, but were occupied intirely by the superior greatness of his. The gene∣rous
<PB N="125" REF="138"/>
Romans, on the contrary, beheld him with disdain and indignation, and regard∣ed as unworthy of all compassion the man who could be so mean-spirited as to bear to live under such calamities. Yet what did those calamities amount to? Accord∣ing to the greater part of historians, he was to spend the remainder of his days, under the protection of a powerful and humane people, in a state which in itself should seem worthy of envy, a state of plenty, ease, leisure, and security, from which it was impossible for him even by his own folly to fall. But he was no longer to be surrounded by that admiring mob of fools, flatterers, and dependants, who had formerly been accustomed to at∣tend upon all his motions. He was no longer to be gazed upon by multitudes, nor to have it in his power to render him∣self the object of their respect, their grati∣tude, their love, their admiration, The passions of nations were no longer to mould themselves upon his inclinations. This was that insupportable calamity which bereaved the King of all sentiment; which made his friends forget their own misfortunes; and which the Roman mag∣nanimity
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
could scarce conceive how any man could be so mean-spirited as to bear to survive.</P>
<P><Q>Love, says my Lord Rochefaucault, is commonly succeeded by ambition; but ambition is hardly ever succeeded by love.</Q>
That passion, when once it has got intire possession of the breast, will ad∣mit neither a rival nor a successor. To those who have been accustomed to the possession, or even to the hope of public admiration, all other pleasures sicken and decay. Of all the discarded statesmen who for their own ease have studied to get the better of ambition, and to despise those honours which they could no longer arrive at, how few have been able to succeed▪ The greater part have spent their time in the most listless and insipid indolence, cha∣grined at the thoughts of their own insig∣nificancy, incapable of being interested in the occupations of private life, without en∣joyment except when they talked of their former greatness, and without satisfaction except when they were employed in some vain project to recover it. Are you in earnest resolved never to barter your liber∣ty for the lordly servitude of a Court, but
<PB N="127" REF="140"/>
to live free, fearless, and independant? There seems to be one way to continue in that virtuous resolution; and perhaps but one. Never enter the place from whence so few have been able to return; never come within the circle of ambition; nor ever bring yourself into comparison with those masters of the earth who have alrea∣dy engrossed the attention of half mankind before you.</P>
<P>Of such mighty importance does it ap∣pear to be, in the imaginations of men, to stand in that situation which sets them most in the view of general sympathy and atten∣tion. And thus, place, that great object which divides the wives of aldermen, is the end of half the labours of human life; and is the cause of all the tumult and bustle, all the rapine and injustice, which avarice and ambition have introduced into this world. People of sense, it is said, in∣deed despise place; that is, they despise sitting at the head of the table, and are in∣different who it is that is pointed out to the company by that frivolous circum∣stance, which the smallest advantage is ca∣pable of overbalancing. But rank, distinc∣tion, preeminence, no man despises, unless
<PB N="128" REF="141"/>
he is either raised very much above, or sunk very much below, the ordinary stan∣dard of human nature; unless he is either so confirmed in wisdom and real philo∣sophy, as to be satisfied that, while the propriety of his conduct renders him the just object of approbation, it is of little consequence tho' he be neither attended to, nor approved of; or so habituated to the idea of his own meanness, so sunk in sloth∣ful and sottish indifference, as intirely to have forgot the desire, and almost the very wish, for superiority.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the stoical philosophy.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we examine in this manner into the ground of the different degrees of estimation which mankind are apt to bestow upon the different condi∣tions of life, we shall find, that the exces∣sive preference, which they generally give to some of them above others, is in a great measure without any foundation. If to be able to act with propriety, and to render ourselves the proper objects of the appro∣bation
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
of mankind, be, as we have been endeavouring to show, what chiefly re∣commends to us one condition above ano∣ther, this may be equally attained in them all. The noblest propriety of conduct may be supported in adversity, as well as in prosperity; and tho' it is somewhat more difficult in the first, it is upon that very account more admirable. Perils and misfortunes are not only the proper school of heroism, they are the only proper the∣atre which can exhibit its virtue to advan∣tage, and draw upon it the full applause of the world. The man, whose whole life has been one even and uninterrupted course of prosperity, who never braved any dan∣ger, who never encountered any difficulty, who never surmounted any distress, can excite but an inferior degree of admira∣tion. When poets and romance-writers endeavour to invent a train of adventures, which shall give the greatest lustre to those characters for whom they mean to interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, they are all of a different kind. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re rapid and sudden changes of fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituations the most apt to drive those who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in them to frenzy and distraction, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o abject despair; but in which their he∣roes
<PB N="130" REF="143" MS="y"/>
act with so much propriety, or at least with so much spirit and undaunted reso∣lution, as still to command our esteem. Is not the unfortunate magnanimity of Cato, Brutus, and Leonidas, as much the object of admiration, as that of the successful Caesar or Alexander? To a generous mind, therefore, ought it not to be as much the object of envy? If a more dazzling splen∣dor seems to attend the fortunes of suc∣cessful conquerors, it is because they join together the advantages of both situations, the lustre of prosperity to the high admi∣ration which is excited by dangers en∣countered, and difficulties surmounted, with intrepidity and valour.</P>
<P>It was upon this account that, accord∣ing to the stoical philosophy, to a wise man all the different conditions of life were equal. Nature, they said, had re∣commended some objects to our choice, and others to our disapprobation. Our primary appetites directed us to the pur∣suit of health, strength, ease, and perfec∣tion, in all the qualities of mind and body▪ and of whatever could promote or secure these, riches, power, authority: and the same original principle taught us to avoid
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
the contrary. But in chusing or rejecting, in preferring or postponing, those first objects of original appetite and aversion, nature had likewise taught us, that there was a certain order, propriety, and grace, to be observed, of infinitely greater conse∣quence to happiness and perfection, than the attainment of those objects themselves. The objects of our primary appetites or aversions were to be pursued or avoided, chiefly because a regard to this grace and propriety required such conduct. In di∣recting all our actions according to these, consisted the happiness and glory of hu∣man nature. In departing from those rules which they prescribed to us, its great∣est wretchedness and most compleat de∣pravity. The outward appearance of this order and propriety was indeed more ea∣sily maintained in some circumstances than in others. To a fool, however, to one whose passions were subjected to no proper controul, to act with real grace and pro∣priety, was equally impossible in every situ∣ation. Tho' the giddy multitude might admire him, tho' his vanity might some∣times be elated by their ignorant praises into something that resembled self-appro∣bation,
<PB N="132" REF="145"/>
yet still when he turned his view to what passed within his own breast, he was secretly conscious to himself of the absurd∣ity and meanness of all his motives, and inwardly blushed and trembled at the thoughts of the contempt which he knew he deserved, and which mankind would certainly bestow upon him if they saw his conduct in the light in which in his own heart he was obliged to regard it. To a wise man, on the contrary, to one whose passions were all brought under perfect subjection to the ruling principles of his nature, to reason and the love of propri∣ety, to act so as to deserve approbation was equally easy upon all occasions. Was he in prosperity, he returned thanks to Ju∣piter for having joined him with circum∣stances which were easily mastered, and in which there was little temptation to do wrong. Was he in adversity, he equally returned thanks to the director of this spectacle of human life, for having oppo∣sed to him a vigorous athlete, over whom, tho' the contest was likely to be more vio∣lent, the victory was more glorious, and equally certain. Can there be any shame in that distress which is brought upon us
<PB N="133" REF="146"/>
without any fault of our own, and in which we behave with perfect propriety? There can, therefore, be no evil, but, on the contrary, the greatest good and ad∣vantage. A brave man exults in those dangers, in which, from no rashness of his own, his fortune has involved him. They afford an opportunity of exercising that heroic intrepidity, whose exertion gives the exalted delight which flows from the consciousness of superior propriety and deserved admiration. One who is master of all his exercises has no aversion to mea∣sure his strength and activity with the strongest. And in the same manner, one who is master of all his passions, does not dread any circumstance in which the su∣perintendent of the universe may think proper to place him. The bounty of that divine being has provided him with vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues which render him superior to every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituation. If it is pleasure, he has temper∣ance to refrain from it; if it is pain, he has constancy to bear it; if it is danger or death, he has magnanimity and fortitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o despise it. He never complains of the destiny of providence, nor thinks the uni∣verse in confusion when he is out of order.
<PB N="134" REF="147"/>
He does not look upon himself, according to what self-love would suggest, as a whole, separated and detached from every other part of nature, to be taken care of by it∣self, and for itself. He regards himself in the light in which he imagines the great Genius of human nature, and of the world regards him. He enters, if I may say so, into the sentiments of that Divine Being, and considers himself as an atom, a particle, of an immense and infinite system, which must, and ought to be disposed of, according to the conveniency of the whole. Assured of the wisdom which directs all the events of human life, whatever lot be∣falls him, he accepts it with joy, satisfied that, if he had known all the connexions and dependencies of the different parts of the universe, it is the very lot which he himself would have wished for. If it is life, he is contented to live: and if it is death, as nature must have no further oc∣casion for his presence here, he willingly goes where he is appointed. I accept, said a stoical philosopher, with equal joy and satisfaction, whatever fortune can befal me. Riches or poverty, pleasure or pain, health or sickness, all is alike: nor would I
<PB N="135" REF="148"/>
desire that the Gods should in any respect change my destination. If I was to ask of them any thing, beyond what their bounty has already bestowed, it would be that they would inform me beforehand what it was their pleasure should be done with me, that I might of my own accord place myself in this situation, and demonstrate the chear∣fulness with which I embraced their allot∣ment. If I am going to sail, says Epicte∣tus, I chuse the best ship, and the best pi∣lot, and I wait for the fairest weather that my circumstances and duty will allow. Prudence and propriety, the principles which the Gods have given me for the di∣rection of my conduct, require this of me; but they require no more: and if, not∣withstanding, a storm arises, which neither the strength of the vessel, nor the skill of the pilot are likely to withstand, I give myself no trouble about the consequence. All that I had to do, is done already, The directors of my conduct never command me to be miserable, to be anxious, despond∣ing, or afraid. Whether we are to be drowned, or to come to a harbour, is the business of Jupiter, not mine. I leave it intirely to his determination, nor ever
<PB N="136" REF="149"/>
break my rest with considering which way he is likely to decide it, but receive what∣ever comes with equal indifference and se∣curity.</P>
<P>Such was the philosophy of the stoics. A philosophy which affords the noblest lessons of magnanimity, is the best school of heroes and patriots, and to the greater part of whose precepts there can be no other objection, except that honourable one, that they teach us to aim at a per∣fection altogether beyond the reach of hu∣man nature. I shall not at present stop to examine it. I shall only observe, in con∣firmation of what has formerly been said, that the most dreadful calamities are not always those which it is most difficult to support. It is often more mortifying to appear in publick, under small disasters, than under great misfortunes. The first excite no sympathy; but the second, tho' they may excite none that approaches to the anguish of the sufferer, call forth, however, a very lively compassion. The sentiments of the spectators are, in this last case, therefore, less wide of those of the sufferer, and their imperfect fel∣low-feeling
<PB N="137" REF="150"/>
lends him some assistance in supporting his misery. Before a gay assembly, a gentleman would be more mortified to appear covered with filth and rags than with blood and wounds. This last situation would interest their pity; the other would provoke their laughter. The judge who orders a criminal to be set in the pillory, dishonours him more than if he had condemned him to the scaffold. The great prince, who, some years ago, caned a general officer at the head of his army, disgraced him irrecoverably. The punishment would have been much less had he shot him through the body. By the laws of honour, to strike with a cane dishonours, to strike with a sword does not, for an obvious reason. Those slighter punishments, when inflicted on a gentle∣man, to whom dishonour is the greatest of all evils, come to be regarded among a hu∣mane and generous people, as the most dreadful of any. With regard to persons of that rank, therefore, they are univer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally laid aside, and the law, while it takes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir life upon many occasions, respects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir honour upon almost all. To scourge
<PB N="138" REF="151"/>
a person of quality, or to set him in the pillory, upon account of any crime what∣ever, is a brutality of which no European government, except that of Russia, is ca∣pable.</P>
<P>A brave man is not rendered contemp∣tible by being brought to the scaffold; he is, by being set in the pillory. His beha∣viour in the one situation may gain him universal esteem and admiration. No be∣haviour in the other can render him agree∣able. The sympathy of the spectators sup∣ports him in the one case, and saves him from that shame, that consciousness that his misery is felt by himself only, which is of all sentiments the most unsupportable. There is no sympathy in the other; or, if There is any, it is not with his pain, which is a trifle, but with his consciousness of the want of sympathy with which this pain is attended. It is with his shame, not with his sorrow. Those who pity him, blush and hang down their heads for him. He droops in the same manner, and feels himself irrecoverably degraded by the pu∣nishment, though not by the crime. The man, on the contrary, who dies with re∣solution,
<PB N="139" REF="152"/>
as he is naturally regarded with erect aspect of esteem and approbation, so he wears himself the same undaunted countenance; and, if the crime does not deprive him of the respect of others, the punishment never will. He has no suspi∣cion that his situation is the object of con∣tempt or derision to any body, and he can, with propriety, assume the air, not only of perfect serenity, but of triumph and exultation.</P>
<P><Q>Great dangers, says the cardinal de Retz, have their charms, because there is some glory to be got, even when we miscarry. But moderate dangers have nothing but what is horrible, because the loss of reputation always attends the want of success.</Q>
His maxim has the same foundation with what we have been observing just now, with regard to punish∣ments.</P>
<P>Human virtue is superior to pain, to poverty, to danger, and to death; nor does it even require its remotest efforts to despise them. But to have its misery ex∣posed to insult and derision, to be led in triumph, to be set up for the hand of scorn
<PB N="140" REF="153"/>
to point at, is a situation in which its con∣stancy is much more apt to fail. Com∣pared with the contempt of mankind, all other evils are easily supported.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the sense of merit and demerit.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is another set of qualities ascribed to the actions and con∣duct of mankind, distinct from their propriety or impropriety, their de∣cency or ungracefulness, and which are the objects of a distinct species of approba∣tion and disapprobation. These are me∣rit and demerit, the qualities of deserving reward, and of deserving punishment.</P>
<P>It has already been observed, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiment or affection of the heart, from which any action proceeds, and upon which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts whole virtue or vice depends, may be
<PB N="142" REF="155"/>
considered under two different aspects, or in two different relations: First, in re∣lation to the cause or object which ex∣cites it; and, secondly, in relation to the end which it proposes, or to the effect which it tends to produce: that upon the suitableness or unsuitableness, upon the proportion or disproportion, which the affection seems to bear to the cause or ob∣ject which excites it, depends the proprie∣ty or impropriety, the decency or ungrace∣fulness of the consequent action; and that upon the beneficial or hurtful effects which the affection proposes or tends to produce, depends the merit or demerit, the good or ill desert of the action to which it gives occasion. Wherein consists our sense o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the propriety or impropriety of actions, has been explained in the former part of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discourse. We come now to consider, where∣in consists that of their good or ill de∣sert.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="143" REF="156"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That whatever appears to be the proper object of gratitude, appears to deserve reward; and that, in the same manner, whatever appears to be the proper ob∣ject of resentment, appears to deserve punishment.</HEAD>
<P>TO us, therefore, that action must appear to deserve reward, which ap∣pears to be the proper and approved ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect of that sentiment, which most imme∣diately and directly prompts us to reward, or to do good to another. And in the same manner, that action must appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserve punishment, which appears to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he proper and approved object of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiment which most immediately and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irectly prompts us to punish, or to inflict <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil upon another.</P>
<P>The sentiment which most immediate∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and directly prompts us to reward, is gratitude; that which most immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd directly prompts us to punish, is re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entment.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="157"/>To us, therefore, that action must ap∣pear to deserve reward, which appears to be the proper and approved object of gra∣titude; as, on the other hand, that action must appear to deserve punishment, which appears to be the proper and approved ob∣ject of resentment.</P>
<P>To reward, is to recompense, to remu∣nerate, to return good for good received. To punish, too, is to recompense, to re∣munerate, though in a different manner; it is to return evil for evil that has been done.</P>
<P>There are some other passions, besides gratitude and resentment, which interest us in the happiness or misery of others; but there are none which so directly ex∣cite us to be the instruments of either. The love and esteem which grow upon acquaintance and habitual approbation, necessarily lead us to be pleased with the good fortune of the man who is the ob∣ject of such agreeable emotions, and con∣sequently, to be willing to lend a hand to promote it. Our love, however, is fully satisfied, though his good fortune should be brought about without our assistance. All that this passion desires is to see him
<PB N="145" REF="158"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appy, without regarding who was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthor of his prosperity. But gratitude is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to be satisfied in this manner. If the person to whom we owe many obliga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, is made happy without our assist∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, though it pleases our love, it does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot content our gratitude. Till we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecompensed him, till we ourselves have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een instrumental in promoting his hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness, we feel ourselves still loaded with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat debt which his past services have laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon us.</P>
<P>The hatred and dislike, in the same manner, which grow upon habitual dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pprobation, would often lead us to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> malicious pleasure in the misfortune <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the man whose conduct and character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcite so painful a passion. But though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>islike and hatred harden us against all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ympathy, and sometimes dispose us even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o rejoice at the distress of another, yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f there is no resentment in the case, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either we nor our friends have received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny great personal provocation, these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assions would not naturally lead us to wish to be instrumental in bringing it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout. Though we could fear no punish∣ment in consequence of our having had
<PB N="146" REF="159"/>
some hand in it, we would rather that it should happen by other means. To one under the dominion of violent hatred i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be agreeable, perhaps, to hear, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the person whom he abhorred and detested was killed by some accident. But if he had the least spark of justice, which, tho' thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passion is not very favourable to virtue, he might still have, it would hurt him exces∣sively to have been himself, even witho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> design, the occasion of this misfortune. Much more would the very thought of vo∣luntarily contributing to it shock him be∣yond all measure. He would reject wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> horror even the imagination of so execra∣ble a design; and if he could imagine him∣self capable of such an enormity, he would begin to regard himself in the same odio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> light in which he had considered the per∣son who was the object of his dislike. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is quite otherwise with resentment: i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the person who had done us some great in∣jury, who had murdered our father or ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brother, for example, should soon after∣wards die of a fever, or even be brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the scaffold upon account of some othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crime, tho' it might sooth our hatred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would not fully gratify our resentment.
<PB N="147" REF="160"/>
Resentment would prompt us to desire, not only that he should be punished, but that he should be punished by our means, and upon account of that particular injury which he had done to us. Resentment can∣not be fully gratified, unless the offender is not only made to grieve in his turn, but to grieve for that particular wrong which we have suffered from him. He must be made to repent and be sorry for this very action, that others, thro' fear of the like punish∣ment, may be terrified from being guilty of the like offence. The natural gratifi∣cation of this passion tends, of its own ac∣cord, to produce all the political ends of punishment; the correction of the crimi∣nal, and the example to the public.</P>
<P>Gratitude and resentment, therefore, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sentiments which most immediately and directly prompt to reward and to pu∣nish. To us, therefore, he must appear to deserve reward, who appears to be the pro∣per and approved object of gratitude; and he to deserve punishment, who appears to be that of resentment.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="148" REF="161"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the proper objects of gratitude and resentment.</HEAD>
<P>TO be the proper and approved object either of gratitude or resentment, can mean nothing but to be the object of that gratitude, and of that resentment, which naturally seems proper, and is ap∣proved of.</P>
<P>But these, as well as all the other pas∣sions of human nature, seem proper and are approved of, when the heart of every impartial spectator intirely sympathises with them, when every indifferent by-stander in∣tirely enters into, and goes along with them.</P>
<P>He, therefore, appears to deserve reward, who, to some person or persons, is the na∣tural object of a gratitude which every hu∣man heart is disposed to beat time to, and thereby applaud: and he, on the other hand, appears to deserve punishment, who in the same manner is to some person or persons the natural object of a resentment which the breast of every reasonable man
<PB N="149" REF="162"/>
is ready to adopt and sympathise with. To us, surely, that action must appear to deserve reward, which every body who knows of it would wish to reward, and therefore delights to see rewarded: and that action must as surely appear to deserve pu∣nishment, which every body who hears of it is angry with, and upon that account re∣joices to see punished.</P>
<P N="1">1. As we sympathize with the joy of our companions when in prosperity, so we join with them in the complacency and sa∣tisfaction with which they naturally regard whatever is the cause of their good for∣tune. We enter into the love and affec∣tion which they conceive for it, and begin to love it too. We should be sorry for their sakes if it was destroyed, or even if it was placed at too great a distance from them, and out of the reach of their care and protection, tho' they should lose no∣thing by its absence except the pleasure of seeing it. If it is man who has thus been the fortunate instrument of the happiness of his brethren, this is still more peculiarly the case. When we see one man assisted, pro∣tected, relieved by another, our sympathy with the joy of the person who receives the
<PB N="150" REF="163"/>
benefit serves only to animate our fellow-feeling with his gratitude towards him who bestows it. When we look upon the per∣son who is the cause of his pleasure with the eyes with which we imagine he must look upon him, his benefactor seems to stand before us in the most engaging and amiable light. We readily therefore sym∣pathize with the grateful affection which he conceives for a person to whom he has been so much obliged; and consequently applaud the returns which he is disposed to make for the good offices conferred up∣on him. As we intirely enter into the af∣fection from which these returns proceed, they necessarily seem every way proper and suitable to their object.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the same manner, as we sympa∣thize with the sorrow of our fellow-creature whenever we see his distress, so we like∣wise enter into his abhorrence and aver∣sion for whatever has given occasion to it. Our heart, as it adopts and beats time to his grief, so is it likewise animated with that spirit by which he endeavours to drive away or destroy the cause of it. The indolent and passive fellow-feeling, by which we accompany him in his sufferings,
<PB N="151" REF="164"/>
readily gives way to that more vigorous and active sentiment by which we go along with him in the effort he makes, either to repel them, or to gratify his aversion to what has given occasion to them. This is still more peculiarly the case, when it is man who has caused them. When we see one man oppressed or injured by another, the sympathy which we feel with the dis∣tress of the sufferer seems to serve only to animate our fellow-feeling with his resent∣ment against the offender. We are rejoic∣ed to see him attack his adversary in his turn, and are eager and ready to assist him whenever he exerts himself for defence, or even for vengeance within a certain degree. If the injured should perish in the quarrel, we not only sympathize with the real re∣sentment of his friends and relations, but with the imaginary resentment which in fancy we lend to the dead, who is no long∣er capable of feeling that or any other hu∣man sentiment. But as we put ourselves in his situation, as we enter, as it were, into his body, and in our imaginations, in some measure, animate anew the de∣formed and mangled carcase of the slain, when we bring home in this manner his
<PB N="152" REF="165"/>
case to our own bosoms, we feel upon this, as upon many other occasions, an emotion which the person principally concerned is incapable of feeling, and which yet we feel by an illusive sympathy with him. The sympathetic tears which we shed for that immense and irretrievable loss, which in our fancy he appears to have sustained, seem to be but a small part of the duty which we owe him. The injury which he has suffered demands, we think, a prin∣cipal part of our attention. We feel that resentment which we imagine he ought to feel, and which he would feel, if in his cold and lifeless body there remained any consci∣ousness of what passes upon earth. His blood, we think, calls aloud for vengeance. The ve∣ry ashes of the dead seem to be disturbed at the thought that his injuries are to pass unre∣venged. The horrors which are supposed to haunt the bed of the murderer, the ghosts which, superstition imagines, rise from their graves to demand vengeance up∣on those who brought them to an untimely end, all take their origin from this natu∣ral sympathy with the imaginary resent∣ment of the slain. And with regard, at least, to this most dreadful of all crimes,
<PB N="153" REF="166"/>
nature, antecedent to all reflexions upon the utility of punishment, has in this man∣ner stamped upon the human heart, in the strongest and most indelible characters, an immediate and instinctive approbation of the sacred and necessary law of retaliation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. That where there is no approbation of the conduct of the person who confers the benefit, there is little sympathy with the gratitude of him who receives it: and that, on the contrary, where there is no disapprobation of the motives of the per∣son who does the mischief, there is no sort of sympathy with the resentment of him who suffers it.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be observed, however, that, how beneficial soever on the one hand, or how hurtful soever on the other, the actions or intentions of the person who acts may have been to the person who is, if I may say so, acted upon, yet if in the one case there appears to have been no propriety in the motives of the agent, if we cannot en∣ter into the affections which influenced
<PB N="154" REF="167"/>
his conduct, we have little sympathy with the gratitude of the person who receives the benefit: or if, in the other case, there appears to have been no impropriety in the motives of the agent, if, on the contrary, the affections which influenced his con∣duct are such as we must necessarily enter into, we can have no sort of sympathy with the resentment of the person who suffers. Little gratitude seems due in the one case, and all sort of resentment seems unjust in the other. The one action seems to merit little reward, the other to deserve no pu∣nishment.</P>
<P N="1">1. First, I say, That wherever we cannot sympathize with the affections of the agent, wherever there seems to be no propriety in the motives which influenced his conduct, we are less disposed to enter into the gra∣titude of the person who received the bene∣fit of his actions. A very small return seems due to that foolish and profuse ge∣nerosity which confers the greatest benefits from the most trivial motives, and gives an estate to a man merely because his name and sirname happen to be the same with those of the giver. Such services do not seem to demand any proportionable recom∣pense.
<PB N="155" REF="168"/>
Our contempt for the folly of the agent hinders us from thoroughly entering into the gratitude of the person to whom the good office has been done. His bene∣factor seems unworthy of it. As when we place ourselves in the situation of the person obliged, we feel that we could conceive no great reverence for such a benefactor, we ea∣sily absolve him from a great deal of that submissive veneration and esteem which we should think due to a more respectable cha∣racter; and provided he always treats his weak friend with kindness and humanity, we are willing to excuse him from many attentions and regards which we should de∣mand to a worthier patron. Those Princes, who have heaped, with the greatest profu∣sion, wealth, power, and honours, upon their favourites, have seldom excited that degree of attachment to their persons which has often been experienced by those who were more frugal of their favours. The well-natured, but injudicious prodigality, of James the First of Great Britain seems to have attached no body to his person; and that Prince, notwithstanding his social and harmless disposition, appears to have lived and died without a friend. The whole gentry
<PB N="156" REF="169"/>
and nobility of England exposed their lives and fortunes in the cause of his more fru∣gal and distinguishing son, notwithstand∣ing the coldness and distant severity of his ordinary deportment.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, I say, That wherever the conduct of the agent appears to have been intirely directed by motives and affections which we thoroughly enter into and ap∣prove of▪ we can have no sort of sympathy with the resentment of the sufferer, how great soevet the mischief which may have been done to him. When two people quarrel, if we take part with, and intirely adopt the resentment of one of them, it is impossible that we should enter into that of the other. Our sympathy with the person whose motives we go along with, and whom therefore we look upon as in the right, can∣not but harden us against all fellow-feeling with the other, whom we necessarily re∣gard as in the wrong. Whatever this last, therefore, may have suffered, while it is no more than what we ourselves should have wished him to suffer, while it is no more than what our own sympathetic indigna∣tion would have prompted us to inflict upon him, it cannot either displease or pro∣voke
<PB N="157" REF="170"/>
us. When an inhuman murderer is brought to the scaffold, tho' we have some compassion for his misery, we can have no sort of fellow-feeling with his resentment, if he should be so absurd as to express any against either his prosecutor or his judge. The natural tendency of their just indig∣nation against so vile a criminal is indeed the most fatal and ruinous to him. But it is impossible that we should be displeased with the tendency of a sentiment, which, when we bring the case home to ourselves, we feel that we cannot avoid adopting.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Recapitulation of the foregoing chapters.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE do not, therefore, thoroughly and heartily sympathize with the gratitude of one man towards another, merely because this other has been the cause of his good fortune, unless he has been the cause of it from motives which we intirely go along with. Our heart must adopt the principles of the agent, and go along with all the affections which influ∣enced his conduct, before it can intirely
<PB N="158" REF="171"/>
sympathize with, and beat time to, the gra∣titude of the person who has been benefited by his actions. If in the conduct of the benefactor there appears to have been no propriety, how beneficial soever its effects, it does not seem to demand, or necessarily to require, any proportionable recom∣pence.</P>
<P>But when to the beneficent tendency of the action is joined the propriety of the affection from which it proceeds, when we intirely sympathize and go along with the motives of the agent, the love which we conceive for him upon his own account enhances and enlivens our fellow-feeling with the gratitude of those who owe their prosperity to his good conduct. His ac∣tions seem then to demand, and, if I may say so, to call aloud for a proportionable recompense. We then intirely enter into that gratitude which prompts to bestow it. The benefactor seems then to be the proper object of reward, when we thus intirely sympathize with, and approve of, that sen∣timent which prompts to reward him. When we approve of, and go along with, the affection from which the action pro∣ceeds, we must necessarily approve of the
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
action, and regard the person towards whom it is directed as its proper and suit∣able object.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the same manner, we cannot at all sympathize with the resentment of one man against another, merely because this other has been the cause of his misfortune, un∣less he has been the cause of it from mo∣tives which we cannot enter into. Before we can adopt the resentment of the sufferer, we must disapprove of the motives of the agent, and feel that our heart renounces all sympathy with the affections which influ∣enced his conduct. If there appears to have been no impropriety in these, how fa∣tal soever the tendency of the action which proceeds from them to those against whom it is directed, it does not seem to deserve any punishment, or to be the proper object of any resentment.</P>
<P>But when to the hurtfulness of the action is joined the impropriety of the affection from whence it proceeds, when our heart rejects with abhorrence all fellow-feeling with the motives of the agent, we then heartily and intirely sympathize with the resentment of the sufferer. Such actions seem then to deserve, and, if I may say so,
<PB N="160" REF="173"/>
to call aloud for, a proportionable punish∣ment; and we intirely enter into, and there∣by approve of, that resentment which prompts to inflict it. The offender neces∣sarily seems then to be the proper object of punishment, when we thus intirely sympa∣thize with, and thereby approve of, that sentiment which prompts to punish. In this case too, when we approve, and go along with, the affection from which the action proceeds, we must necessarily ap∣prove of the action, and regard the person against whom it is directed, as its proper and suitable object.</P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The analysis of the sense of merit and de∣merit.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS our sense, therefore, of the pro∣priety of conduct arises from what I shall call a direct sympathy with the affec∣tions and motives of the person who acts, so our sense of its merit arises from what I shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> call an indirect sympathy with the grati∣tude of the person who is, if I may say so, acted upon.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174"/>As we cannot indeed enter thoroughly into the gratitude of the person who re∣ceives the benefit, unless we beforehand approve of the motives of the benefactor, so, upon this account, the sense of merit seems to be a compounded sentiment, and to be made up of two distinct emotions; a direct sympathy with the sentiments of the agent, and an indirect sympathy with the gratitude of those who receive the bene∣fit of his actions.</P>
<P>We may, upon many different occa∣sions, plainly distinguish those two differ∣ent emotions combining and uniting toge∣ther in our sense of the good desert of a particular character or action. When we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead in history concerning actions of pro∣per and beneficent greatness of mind, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agerly do we enter into such designs? How much are we animated by that high-spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited generosity which directs them? How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een are we for their success? How grieved at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir disappointment? In imagination we become the very person whose actions are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epresented to us: we transport ourselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n fancy to the scenes of those distant and forgotten adventures, and imagine our∣selves acting the part of a Scipio or a Ca∣millus,
<PB N="162" REF="175" MS="y"/>
a Timoleon or an Aristides. So far our sentiments are founded upon the direct sympathy with the person who acts. Nor is the indirect sympathy with those who receive the benefit of such actions less sensibly felt. Whenever we place ourselves in the situation of these last, with what warm and affectionate fellow-feeling do we enter into their gratitude towards those who served them so essentially? We em∣brace, as it were, their benefactor along with them. Our heart readily sympathi∣zes with the highest transports of their grateful affection. No honours, no re∣wards, we think, can be too great for them to bestow upon him. When they make this proper return for his services, we heartily applaud and go along with them; but are shocked beyond all measure, if by their conduct they appear to have little sense of the obligations conferred upon them. Our whole sense, in short, of the merit and good desert of such actions, of the propriety and fitness of recompensing them, and making the person who per∣formed them rejoice in his turn, arises from the sympathetic emotions of grati∣tude and love, with which, when we bring
<PB N="163" REF="176"/>
home to our own breasts the situation of those principally concerned, we feel our∣selves naturally transported towards the man who could act with such proper and noble beneficence.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the same manner as our sense of the impropriety of conduct arises from a want of sympathy, or from a direct anti∣pathy to the affections and motives of the agent, so our sense of its demerit arises from what I shall here too call an indirect sym∣pathy with the resentment of the sufferer.</P>
<P>As we cannot indeed enter into the resentment of the sufferer, unless our heart before-hand disapproves the motives of the agent, and renounces all fellow-feeling with them; so upon this account the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense of demerit, as well as that of merit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eems to be a compounded sentiment, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be made up of two distinct emotions; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> direct antipathy to the sentiments of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gent, and an indirect sympathy with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esentment of the sufferer.</P>
<P>We may here too, upon many different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasions, plainly distinguish those two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifferent emotions combining and uniting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether in our sense of the ill desert of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articular character or action. When we
<PB N="164" REF="177"/>
read in history concerning the perfidy and cruelty of a Borgia or a Nero, our heart rises up against the detestable sentiment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which influenced their conduct, and re∣nounces with horror and abomination all fellow-feeling with such execrable motives. So far our sentiments are founded upon the direct antipathy to the affections of the agent: and the indirect sympathy with the resentment of the sufferers is still more sensibly felt. When we bring home to ourselves the situation of the persons whom those scourges of mankind insulted, mur∣dered, or betrayed, what indignation do we not feel against such insolent and inhu∣man oppressors of the earth? Our sym∣pathy with the unavoidable distress of the innocent sufferers is not more real nor more lively, than our fellow-feeling with their just and natural resentment. The former sentiment only heightens the latter, and the idea of their distress serves only to inflame and blow up our animosity against those who occasioned it. When we think of the anguish of the sufferers, we take part with them more earnestly against their oppressors; we enter with more eagerness into all their schemes of vengeance, and
<PB N="165" REF="178"/>
feel ourselves every moment wreaking, in imagination, upon such violators of the laws of society, that punishment which our sympathetic indignation tells us is due to their crimes. Our sense of the horror and dreadful atrocity of such conduct, the delight which we take in hearing that it was properly punished, the indignation which we feel when it escapes this due re∣taliation, our whole sense and feeling, in short, of its ill desert, of the propriety and fitness of inflicting evil upon the person who is guilty of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and of making him grieve in his turn, arises from the sympa∣thetic indignation which naturally boils up in the breast of the spectator, whenever he thoroughly brings home to himself the case of the sufferer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To ascribe in this manner our natural sense of the ill desert of human actions to a sympathy with the re∣sentment of the sufferer, may seem, to the greater part of people, to be a degradation of that sentiment. Re∣sentment is commonly regarded as so odious a passion, that they will be apt to think it impossible that so laudable a principle, as the sense of the ill desert of vice, should in any respect be founded upon it. They will be more willing, perhaps, to admit that our sense of the merit of good actions is founded upon a sympathy with the gratitude of the persons who receive the benefit of them; because gratitude, as well as all the other bene∣volent passions, is regarded as an amiable principle,
<PB N="166" REF="179" MS="y"/>
which can take nothing from the worth of whatever is founded upon it. Gratitude and resentment, however, are in every respect, it is evident, counterparts of one another; and if our sense of merit arises from a sympa∣thy with the one, our sense of demerit can scarce miss to proceed from a fellow-feeling with the other.</P>
<P>Let it be considered too that resentment, tho', in the degrees in which we too often see it, the most odious, perhaps, of all the passions, is not disapproved of when properly humbled and intirely brought down to the le∣vel of the sympathetic indignation of the spectator. When we, who are the bystanders, feel that our own animosity intirely corresponds with that of the sufferer, when the resentment of this last does not in any respect go beyond our own, when no word, no gesture, escapes him that denotes an emotion more violent than what we can keep time to, and when he never aims at inflict∣ing any punishment beyond what we should rejoice to see inflicted, or what we ourselves would upon his ac∣count even desire to be the instruments of inflicting, it is impossible, that we should not intirely approve of his sentiments. Our own emotion in this case must, in our eyes, undoubtedly justify his. And as experience teach∣es us how much the greater part of mankind are inca∣pable of his moderation, and how great an effort must be made in order to bring down the rude and undisci∣plined impulse of resentment to this suitable temper, we cannot avoid conceiving a considerable degree of esteem and admiration for one who appears capable of exerting so much self-command over one of the most ungovern∣able passions of his nature. When indeed the animosity of the sufferer exceeds, as it almost always does, what we can go along with, as we cannot enter into it, we necessarily disapprove of it. We even disapprove of it more than we should of an equal excess of almost any other passion derived from the imagination. And this too violent resentment, instead of carrying us along with it, becomes itself the object of our resentment and indignation. We enter into the opposite resent∣ment of the person who is the object of this unjust emo∣tion,
<PB N="167" REF="180"/>
and who is in danger of suffering from it. Re∣venge, therefore, the excess of resentment, appears to be the most detestable of all the passions, and is the object of the horror and indignation of every body. And as in the way in which this passion commonly discovers it∣self among mankind, it is excessive a hundred times for once that it is moderate, we are very apt to consider it as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>together odious and detestable, because in its most ordinary appearances it is so. Nature, however, even in the present depraved state of mankind, does not seem to have dealt so unkindly with us, as to have endowed us with any principle which is wholly and in every re∣spect evil, or which, in no degree and in no direction, can be the proper object of praise and approbation. Upon some occasions we are sensible that this passion, which is generally too strong, may likewise be too weak. We sometimes complain that a particular person shows too little spirit, and has too little sense of the in∣juries that have been done to him; and we are as ready to despise him for the defect, as to hate him for the ex∣cess of this passion.</P>
<P>The inspired writers would not surely have talked so frequently or so strongly of the wrath and anger of God, if they had regarded every degree of those passions as vicious and evil, even in so weak and imperfect a creature as man.</P>
<P>Let it be considered too, that the present inquiry is not concerning a matter of right, if I may say so, but concerning a matter of fact. We are not at present ex∣amining upon what principles a perfect being would ap∣prove of the punishment of bad actions; but upon what principles so weak and imperfect a creature as man actually and in fact approves of it. The principles which I have just now mentioned, it is evident, have a very great effect upon his sentiments; and it seems wisely ordered that it should be so. The very existence of society requires that unmerited and unprovoked ma∣lice should be restrained by proper punishments; and consequently, that to inflict those punishments should be regarded as a proper and laudable action. Though
<PB N="168" REF="181" MS="y"/>
man, therefore, be naturally endowed with a desire of the welfare and preservation of society, yet the author of nature has not intrusted it to his reason to find out that a certain application of punishments is the proper means of attaining this end; but has endowed him with an immediate and instinctive approbation of that very application which is most proper to attain it. The oeconomy of nature is in this respect exactly of a piece with what it is upon many other occasions. With re∣gard to all those ends which, upon account of their pe∣culiar importance, may be regarded, if such an expres∣sion is allowable, as the favourite ends of nature, she has constantly in this manner not only endowed man∣kind with an appetite for the end which she proposes, but likewise with an appetite for the means by which alone this end can be brought about, for their own sakes, and independent of their tendency to produce it. Thus self-preservation, and the propagation of the spe∣cies, are the great ends which nature seems to have pro∣posed in the formation of all animals. Mankind are endowed with a desire of those ends, and an aversion to the contrary; with a love of life, and a dread of disso∣lution; with a desire of the continuance and perpetuity of the species, and with an aversion to the thoughts of its intire extinction. But tho' we are in this manner endowed with a very strong desire of those ends, it has not been intrusted to the slow and uncertain determina∣tions of our reason, to find out the proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts. Hunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, the love of pleasure, and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends which the great director of nature intended to produce by them.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this note, I must take notice of a difference between the approbation of propriety and that of merit or beneficence. Before we approve of the sentiments of any person as proper and suitable to their
<PB N="169" REF="182"/>
objects, we must not only be affected in the same man∣ner as he is, but we must perceive this harmony and correspondence of sentiments between him and our∣selves. Thus, tho' upon hearing of a misfortune that had befallen my friend, I should conceive precisely that degree of concern which he gives way to; yet till I am informed of the manner in which he behaves, till I per∣ceive the harmony between his emotions and mine, I cannot be said to approve of the sentiments which in∣fluence his behaviour. The approbation of propriety therefore requires, not only that we should intirely sym∣pathize with the person who acts, but that we should perceive this perfect concord between his sentiments and our own. On the contrary, when I hear of a benefit that has been bestowed upon another person, let him who has received it be affected in what manner he pleases, if, by bringing his case home to myself, I feel gratitude arise in my own breast, I necessarily approve of the conduct of his benefactor, and regard it as me∣ritorious, and the proper object of reward. Whether the person who has received the benefit conceives grati∣tude or not, cannot, it is evident, in any degree alter our sentiments with regard to the merit of him who has bestowed it. No actual correspondence of sentiments, therefore, is here required. It is sufficient that, if he was grateful, they would correspond; and our sense of merit is often founded upon one of those illusive sympa∣thies, by which, when we bring home to ourselves the case of another, we are often affected in a manner in which the person principally concerned is incapable of being affected. There is a similar difference between our d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sapprobation of demerit, and that of impro∣priety.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Comparison of those two virtues.</HEAD>
<P>ACTIONS of a beneficent tendency which proceed from proper motives seem alone to require reward; because such alone are the approved objects of gratitude, or excite the sympathetic grati∣tude of the spectator.</P>
<P>Actions of a hurtful tendency, which proceed from improper motives, seem alone to deserve punishment; because such alone are the approved objects of re∣sentment, or excite the sympathetic resent∣ment of the spectator.</P>
<P>Beneficence is always free, it cannot be extorted by force, the meer want of it ex∣poses to no punishment: because the meer want of beneficence tends to do no real positive evil. It may disappoint of the good which might reasonably have been expected, and upon that account it may
<PB N="171" REF="184"/>
justly excite dislike and disapprobation: it cannot, however, provoke any resentment which mankind will go along with. The man who does not recompence his bene∣factor, when he has it in his power, and when his benefactor needs his assistance, is, no doubt, guilty of the blackest in∣gratitude. The heart of every impartial spectator rejects all fellow-feeling with the selfishness of his motives, and he is the pro∣per object of the highest disapprobation. But still he does no posiive hurt to anybody; he only does not do that good which in pro∣priety he ought to have done. He is the ob∣ject of hatred, a passion which is naturally excited by impropriety of sentiment and behaviour; not of resentment, a passion which is never properly called forth but by actions which tend to do real and posi∣tive hurt to some particular persons. His want of gratitude, therefore, cannot be punished. To oblige him by force to per∣form what ingratitude he ought to per∣form, and what every impartial spectator would approve of him for performing, would, if possible, be still more improper than his neglecting to perform it. His benefactor would dishonour himself if he
<PB N="172" REF="185"/>
attempted by violence to constrain him to gratitude, and it would be impertinent for any third person, who was not the superior of either, to intermeddle. But of all the duties of beneficence, those which gratitude recommends to us approach near∣est to what is called a perfect and compleat obligation. What friendship, what gene∣rosity, what charity, would prompt us to do with universal approbation, is still more free, and can still less be extorted by force than the duties of gratitude. We talk of the debt of gratitude, not of charity, or generosity, nor even of friendship, when friendship is meer esteem, and has not been enhanced and complicated with gratitude for good offices.</P>
<P>Resentment seems to have been given us by nature for defence, and for defence only. It is the safeguard of justice and the security of innocence. It prompts us to beat off the mischief which is attempted to be done to us, and to retaliate that which is already done; that the offender may be made to repent of his injustice; and that others, through fear of the like punishment, may be terrified from being guilty of the like offence. It must be reserved therefore
<PB N="173" REF="186"/>
for these purposes, nor can the spectator ever go along with it when it is exerted for any other. But the meer want of the be∣neficent virtues, though it may disappoint us of the good which might reasonably be expected, neither does, nor attempts to do, any mischief from whch we can have oc∣casion to defend ourselves.</P>
<P>There is, however, another virtue, of which the observance is not left to the freedom of our own wills, which may be extorted by force, and of which the viola∣tion exposes to resentment, and consequent∣ly to punishment. This virtue is justice: the violation of justice is injury: it does real and positive hurt to some particular persons, from motives which are naturally disapproved of. It is, therefore, the pro∣per object of resentment, and of punish∣ment, which is the natural consequence of resentment. As mankind go along with, and approve of, the violence employed to avenge the hurt which is done by injustice, so they much more go along with, and ap∣prove of, that which is employed to pre∣vent and beat off the injury, and to re∣strain the offender from hurting his neigh∣bours. The person himself who meditates
<PB N="174" REF="187"/>
an injustice is sensible of this, and feels that force may, with the utmost propriety, be made use of both by the person whom he is about to injure, and by others, either to obstruct the execution of his crime, or to punish him when he has executed it. And upon this is founded that remarkable dis∣tinction between justice and all the other social virtues, which has of late been par∣ticularly insisted upon by an author of very great and original genius, that we feel ourselves to be under a stricter obliga∣tion to act according to justice, than agreeably to friendship, charity, or gene∣rosity; that the practice of these last men∣tioned virtues seems to be left in some measure to our own choice, but that, some∣how or other, we feel ourselves to be in a peculiar manner tyed, bound, and obliged to the observation of justice. We feel, that is to say, that force may, with the utmost propriety, and with the approbation of all mankind, be made use of to constrain us to observe the rules of the one, but not to follow the precepts of the other.</P>
<P>We must always, however, carefully distinguish what is only blameable, or the proper object of disapprobation, from what
<PB N="175" REF="188"/>
force may be employed either to punish or to prevent. That seems blameable which falls short of that ordinary degree of proper be∣neficence which experience teaches us to expect of every body; and on the contrary, that seems praise-worthy which goes beyond it. The ordinary degree itself seems neither blameable nor praise-worthy. A father, a son, a brother, who behaves to the corres∣pondent relation neither better nor worse than the greater part of men commonly do, seems properly to deserve neither praise nor blame. He who surprises us by ex∣traordinary and unexpected, though still proper, and suitable kindness, or on the contrary, by extraordinary and unexpected, as well as unsuitable unkindness, seems praise-worthy in the one case, and blame∣able in the other.</P>
<P>Even the most ordinary degree of kind∣ness or beneficence, however, cannot, among equals, be extorted by force. Among equals each individual is naturally, and an∣tecedent to the institution of civil govern∣ment, regarded as having a right both to defend himself from injuries, and to exact a certain degree of punishment for those which have been done to him. Every ge∣nerous
<PB N="176" REF="189"/>
spectator not only approves of his conduct when he does this, but enters so far into his sentiments as often to be will∣ing to assist him. When one man attacks, or robs, or attempts to murder another, all the neighbours take the alarm, and think that they do right when they run, either to revenge the person who has been injured, or to defend him who is in danger of being so. But when a father fails in the ordinary degree of parental affection towards a son; when a son seems to want that filial reve∣rence which might be expected to his father; when brothers are without the usual de∣gree of brotherly affection; when a man shuts his▪ breast against compassion, and refuses to relieve the misery of his fellow-creatures, when he can with the greatest ease; in all these cases, though every body blames the conduct, nobody imagines that those who might have reason, perhaps, to expect more kindness, have any right to extort it by force. The sufferer can only complain, and the spectator can intermeddle no other way than by advice and persua∣sion. Upon all such occasions for equals to use force against one another, would
<PB N="177" REF="190"/>
be thought the highest degree of insolence and presumption.</P>
<P>A superior may, indeed, sometimes, with universal approbation, oblige those under his jurisdiction to behave, in this respect, with a certain degree of propriety to one another. The laws of all civilized nations oblige parents to maintain their children, and children to maintain their parents, and impose upon men many other duties of beneficence. The civil magistrate is en∣trusted with the power not only of preserv∣ing the public peace by restraining injustice, but of promoting the prosperity of the com∣monwealth, by establishing good disci∣pline, and by discouraging every sort of vice and impropriety; he may prescribe rules, therefore, which not only prohibit mutual injuries among fellow-citizens, but com∣mand mutual good offices to a certain de∣gree. When the sovereign commands what is meerly indifferent, and what antecedent to his orders might have been omitted with∣out any blame, it becomes not only blame∣able but punishable to disobey him. When he commands, therefore, what, antecedent to any such order, could not have been o∣mitted without the greatest blame, it surely
<PB N="178" REF="191"/>
becomes much more punishable to be want∣ing in obedience. Of all the duties of a law∣giver, however, this, perhaps, is what it requires the greatest delicacy and reserve to execute with propriety and judgment. To neglect it altogether exposes the common∣wealth to many gross disorders and shock∣ing enormities, and to push it too far is destructive of all liberty, security, and justice.</P>
<P>Though the meer want of beneficence seems to merit no punishment from equals, the greater exertions of that virtue appear to deserve the highest reward. By being productive of the greatest good, they are the natural and approved objects of the liveliest gratitude. Though the breach of justice, on the contrary, exposes to punishment, the observation of the rules of that virtue seems scarce to deserve any reward. There is, no doubt, a propriety in the practice of justice, and it merits, upon that account, all the approbation which is due to propriety. But as it does no real positive good, it is entitled to very little gratitude. Meer justice is, upon most occasions, but a negative virtue, and only hinders us from hurting our neigh∣bour.
<PB N="179" REF="192"/>
The man who barely abstains from violating either the person, or the estate, or the reputation of his neighbours, has surely very little positive merit. He ful∣fils, however, all the rules of what is pe∣culiarly called justice, and does every thing which his equals can with propriety force him to do, or which they can punish him for not doing. We may often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing.</P>
<P>As every man doth, so shall it be done to him, and retaliation seems to be the great law which is dictated to us by nature. Beneficence and generosity we think due to the generous and benificent. Those whose hearts never open to the feel∣ings of humanity, should, we think, be shut out, in the same manner, from the affec∣tions of all their fellow-creatures, and be allowed to live in the midst of society, as in a great desart where there is no-body to care for them, or to enquire after them. The violator of the laws of justice ought to be made to feel himself that evil which he has done to another; and since no re∣gard to the sufferings of his brethren is capable of restraining him, he ought to
<PB N="180" REF="193"/>
be over-awed by the fear of his own. The man who is barely innocent, who only ob∣serves the laws of justice with regard to others, and meerly abstains from hurting his neighbours, can merit only that his neighbours in their turn should respect his innocence, and that the same laws should be religiously observed with regard to him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the sense of justice, of remorse, and of the consciousness of merit.</HEAD>
<P>THERE can be no proper motive for hurting our neighbour, there can be no incitement to do evil to another, which mankind will go along with, except just in∣dignation for evil which that other has done to us. To disturb his happiness meerly because it stands in the way of our own, to take from him what is of real use to him meerly because it may be of equal or of more use to us, or to indulge, in this manner, at the expence of other people, the natural preference which every man has for his own happiness above that of
<PB N="181" REF="194"/>
other people, is what no impartial specta∣tor can go along with. Every man, is no doubt, by nature first, and principally re∣commended to his own care; and as he is fitter to take care of himself than of any other person, it is fit and right that it should be so. Every man, therefore, is much more deeply interested in whatever immediately concerns himself, than in what concerns any other man: and to hear, perhaps, of the death of another person, with whom we have no particular connection, will give us less concern, will spoil our stomach, or break our rest much less than a very insignificant disaster which has befallen ourselves. But tho' the ruin of our neighbour may affect us much less than a very small misfortune of our own, we must not ruin him to prevent that small misfortune, nor even to prevent our own ruin. We must, here, as in all other cases, view ourselves not so much according to that light in which we may naturally appear to ourselves, as according to that in which we naturally appear to others. Tho' every man may, according to the proverb, be the whole world to himself, to the rest of mankind he is a most insignificant part of
<PB N="182" REF="195"/>
it. Tho' his own happiness may be of more importance to him than that of all the world besides, to every other person it is of no more consequence than that of any other man. Tho' it may be true, therefore, that every individual, in his own breast, na∣turally prefers himself to all mankind, yet he dares not look mankind in the face, and avow that he acts according to this princi∣ple. He feels that in this preference they can never go along with him, and that how natural soever it may be to him, it must always appear excessive and extrava∣gant to them. When he views himself in the light in which he is conscious that others will view him, he sees that to them he is but one of the multitude in no respect bet∣ter than any other in it. If he would act so as that the impartial spectator may en∣ter into the principles of his conduct, which is what of all things he has the greatest desire to do, he must, upon this, as upon all other occasions, humble the arrogance of his self-love, and bring it down to some∣thing which other men can go along with. They will indulge it so far as to allow him to be more anxious about, and to pursue with more earnest assiduity, his own happi∣ness
<PB N="183" REF="196"/>
than that of any other person. Thus far, whenever they place themselves in his situation, they will readily go along with him. In the race for wealth, and honours, and preferments, he may run as hard as he can, and strain every nerve and every muscle, in order to outstrip all his compe∣titors. But if he should justle, or throw down any of them, the indulgence of the spectators is entirely at an end. It is a vio∣lation of fair play, which they cannot ad∣mit of. This man is to them, in every re∣spect, as good as he: they do not enter into that self-love by which he prefers him∣self so much to this other, and cannot go along with the motive from which he hurt him. They readily, therefore, sympathize with the natural resentment of the injur∣ed, and the offender becomes the object of their hatred and indignation. He is sen∣sible that he becomes so, and feels that those sentiments are ready to burst out from all sides against him.</P>
<P>As the greater and more irreparable the evil that is done, the resentment of the sufferers runs naturally the higher, so does likewise the sympathetic indignation of the spectator, as well as the sense of guilt in the
<PB N="184" REF="197"/>
agent. Death is the greatest evil which one man can inflict upon another, and excites the highest degree of resentment in those who are immediately connected with the slain. Murder, therefore, is the most atrocious of all crimes which affect indivi∣duals only, in the sight both of mankind, and of the person who has committed it. To be deprived of that which we are pos∣sessed of, is a greater evil than to be disap∣pointed of what we have only the expecta∣tion. Breach of property, therefore, theft and robbery, which take from us what we are possessed of, are greater crimes than breach of contract, which only disappoints us of what we expected. The most sacred laws of justice, therefore, those whose vio∣lation seems to call loudest for vengeance and punishment, are the laws which guard the life and person of our neighbour; the next are those which guard his property and possessions; and last of all come those which guard what are called his personal rights, or what is due to him from the pro∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of others.</P>
<P>The violator of the more sacred laws of justice can never reflect on the sentiments which mankind must entertain with re∣gard
<PB N="185" REF="198"/>
to him, without feeling all the ago∣nies of shame and horror, and consterna∣tion. When his passion is gratified, and he begins coolly to reflect on his past con∣duct, he can enter into none of the mo∣tives which influenced it. They appear now as detestable to him as they did always to other people. By sympathizing with the hatred and abhorrence which other men must entertain for him, he becomes in some measure the object of his own ha∣tred and abhorrence. The situation of the person, who suffered by his injustice, now calls upon his pity. He is grieved at the thought of it; regrets the unhappy effects of his own conduct, and feels at the same time that they have rendered him the pro∣per object of the resentment and indigna∣tion of mankind, and of what is the na∣tural consequence of resentment, venge∣ance and punishment. The thought of this perpetually haunts him, and fills him with terror and amazement. He dares no longer look society in the face, but ima∣gines himself as it were rejected, and thrown out from the affections of all mankind. He cannot hope for the consolation of sym∣pathy in this his greatest, and most dread∣ful
<PB N="186" REF="199"/>
distress. The remembrance of his crimes has shut out all fellow-feeling with him from the hearts of his fellow-creatures. The sentiments which they entertain with regard to him, are the very thing which he is most afraid of. Every thing seems hos∣tile, and he would be glad to fly to some inhospitable desert, where he might never more behold the face of a human creature, nor read in the countenance of mankind the condemnation of his crimes. But soli∣tude is still more dreadful than society. His own thoughts can present him with nothing but what is black, unfortunate, and disastrous, the melancholy forebod∣ings of incomprehensible misery and ruin. The horror of solitude drives him back in∣to society, and he comes again into the presence of mankind, astonished to appear before them, loaded with shame and dis∣tracted with fear, in order to supplicate some little protection from the countenance of those very judges, who he knows have already all unanimously condemned him. Such is the nature of that sentiment, which is properly called remorse; of all the sen∣timents which can enter the human breast the most dreadful. It is made up of shame
<PB N="187" REF="200"/>
from the sense of the impropriety of past conduct; of grief for the effects of it; of pity for those who suffer by it; and of the dread and terror of punishment from the consciousness of the justly provoked resent∣ment of all rational creatures.</P>
<P>The opposite behaviour naturally inspires the opposite sentiment. The man who, not from frivolous fancy, but from proper motives, has performed a generous action, when he looks forward to those whom he has served, feels himself to be the natural object of their love and gratitude, and by sympathy with them, of the esteem and approbation of all mankind. And when he looks backward to the motive from which he acted, and surveys it in the light in which the indifferent spectator will sur∣vey it, he still continues to enter into it, and applauds himself by sympathy with the approbation of this supposed impartial judge. In both these points of view his own conduct appears to him every way agreeable. His mind, at the thought of it, is filled with chearfulness, serenity, and composure. He is in friendship and har∣mony with all mankind, and looks upon his fellow-creatures with confidence and
<PB N="188" REF="201"/>
benevolent satisfaction, secure that he has rendered himself worthy of their most fa∣vourable regards. In the combination of all these sentiments consists the conscious∣ness of merit, or of deserved reward.</P>

<P>IT is thus that man, who can subsist on∣ly in society, was fitted by nature to that situation for which he was made. All the members of human society stand in need of each others assistance, and are like∣wise exposed to mutual injuries. Where the necessary assistance is reciprocally af∣forded from love, from gratitude, from friendship and esteem, the society flourishes and is happy. All the different members of it are bound together by the agreeable bands of love and affection, and are, as it were, drawn to one common centre of mu∣tual good offices.</P>
<P>But tho' the necessary assistance should not be afforded from such generous and dis∣interested
<PB N="189" REF="202"/>
motives, tho' among the different members of the society there should be no mutual love and affection, the society, tho' less happy and agreeable, will not necessa∣rily be dissolved. Society may subsist among different men, as among different mer∣chants, from a sense of its utility, with∣out any mutual love or affection; and tho' no one man in it should owe any obliga∣tion, or be bound in gratitude to any other, it may still be upheld by a mercenary ex∣change of good offices according to an agreed valuation.</P>
<P>Society, however, cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another. The moment that in∣jury begins, the moment that mutual re∣sentment and animosity take place, all the bands of it are broke asunder, and the dif∣ferent members of which it consisted are, as it were, dissipated and scattered abroad by the violence and opposition of their dis∣cordant affections. If there is any society among robbers and murderers, they must at least, according to the trite observation, abstain from robbing and murdering one another. Beneficence, therefore, is less essential to the existence of society than
<PB N="190" REF="203"/>
justice. Society may subsist, tho' not in the most comfortable state, without benefi∣cence; but the prevalence of injustice must utterly destroy it.</P>
<P>Tho' nature, therefore, exhorts mankind to acts of beneficence, by the pleasing con∣sciousness of deserved reward, she has not thought it necessary to guard and enforce the practice of it by the terrors of merited punishment in case it should be neglected. It is the ornament which embellishes, not the foundation which supports the build∣ing, and which it was, therefore, sufficient to recommend, but by no means necessary to impose. Justice, on the contrary, is the main pillar that upholds the whole edi∣fice. If it is removed, the great, the im∣mense fabric of human society, that fabric which to raise and to support seems in this world, if I may say so, to have been the peculiar and darling care of nature, must in a moment crumble into atoms. To en∣force the observation of justice, therefore, nature has implanted in the human breast that consciousness of ill-desert, those ter∣rors of merited punishment which attend upon its violation, as the great safe-guards of the association of mankind, to protect
<PB N="191" REF="204"/>
the weak, to curb the violent, and to chas∣tize the guilty. Men, tho' naturally sym∣pathetic, feel so little for another, with whom they have no particular connection, in comparison of what they feel for them∣selves; the misery of one, who is merely their fellow-creature, is of so little impor∣tance to them in comparison even of a small conveniency of their own; they have it so much in their power to hurt him, and may have so many temptations to do so, that if this principle did not stand up within them in his defence, and overawe them into a respect for his innocence, they would, like wild beasts, be at all times ready to fly up∣on him; and a man would enter an assem∣bly of men as he enters a den of lions.</P>
<P>In every part of the universe we observe means adjusted with the nicest artifice to the ends which they are intended to pro∣duce; and in the mechanism of a plant, or animal body, admire how every thing is contrived for advancing the two great pur∣poses of nature, the support of the indivi∣dual, and the propogation of the species. But in these, and in all such objects, we still distinguish the efficient from the final cause of their several motions and organi∣zations.
<PB N="192" REF="205"/>
The digestion of the food, the circulation of the blood, and the secretion of the several juices which are drawn from it, are operations all of them necessary for the great purposes of animal life. Yet we never endeavour to account for them from those purposes as from their efficient causes, nor imagine that the blood circulates, or that the food digests of its own accord, and with a view or intention to the pur∣poses of circulation or digestion. The wheels of the watch are all admirably ad∣justed to the end for which it was made, the pointing of the hour. All their vari∣ous motions conspire in the nicest manner to produce this effect. If they were endow∣ed with a desire and intention to produce it, they could not do it better. Yet we ne∣ver ascribe any such desire or intention to them, but to the watch-maker, and we know that they are put into motion by a spring, which intends the effect it produces as little as they do. But tho', in account∣ing for the operations of bodies, we never fail to distinguish in this manner the effi∣cient from the final cause, in accounting for those of the mind we are very apt to confound these two different things with
<PB N="193" REF="206"/>
one another. When by natural principles we are led to advance those ends, which a refined and enlightened reason would re∣commend to us, we are very apt to impute to that reason, as to their efficient cause, the sentiments and actions by which we advance those ends, and to imagine that to be the wisdom of man, which in reality is the wisdom of God. Upon a superficial view this cause seems sufficient to produce the effects which are ascribed to it; and the system of human nature seems to be more simple and agreeable when all its different operations are in this manner deduced from a single principle.</P>
<P>As society cannot subsist unless the laws of justice are tolerably observed, as no so∣cial intercourse can take place among men who do not generally abstain from injuring one another; the consideration of this ne∣cessity, it has been thought, was the ground upon which we approved of the enforce∣ment of the laws of justice by the punish∣ment of those who violated them. Man, it has been said, has a natural love for so∣ciety, and desires that the union of mankind should be preserved for its own sake, and tho' he himself was to derive no benefit from
<PB N="194" REF="207"/>
it. The orderly and flourishing state of society is agreeable to him, and he takes delight in contemplating it. It's disorder and confusion, on the contrary, is the ob∣ject of his aversion, and he is chagrined at whatever tends to produce it. He is sensible too that his own interest is con∣nected with the prosperity of society, and that the happiness, perhaps the preserva∣tion of his existence, depends upon its pre∣servation. Upon every account, therefore, he has an abhorrence at whatever can tend to destroy society, and is willing to make use of every means, which can hinder so hated, and so dreadful an event. Injustice necessarily tends to destroy it. Every ap∣pearance of injustice, therefore, alarms him, and he runs, if I may say so, to stop the progress of what, if allowed to go on, would quickly put an end to every thing that is dear to him. If he cannot restrain it by gentle and fair means, he must beat it down by force and violence, and at any rate must put a stop to its further progress. Hence it is, they say, that he often ap∣proves of the enforcement of the laws of justice even by the capital punishment of those who viola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them. The disturber of
<PB N="195" REF="208"/>
the public peace is hereby removed out of the world, and others are terrified by his fate from imitating his example.</P>
<P>Such is the account commonly given of our approbation of the punishment of in∣justice. And so far this account is un∣doubtedly true that we frequently have oc∣casion to confirm our natural sense of the propriety and fitness of punishment by re∣flecting how necessary it is for preserving the order of society. When the guilty is about to suffer that just retaliation, which the natural indignation of mankind tells them is due to his crimes; when the inso∣lence of his injustice is broken and hum∣bled by the terror of his approaching pu∣nishment; when he ceases to be an object of fear, with the generous and humane he begins to be an object of pity. The thought of what he is about to suffer extinguishes their resentment for the sufferings of others to which he has given occasion. They are disposed to pardon and forgive him, and to save him from that punishment which in all their cool hours they had considered as the retribution due to such crimes. Here, therefore, they have occasion to call to their assistance the consideration of the
<PB N="196" REF="209"/>
general interest of society. They counter∣balance the impulse of this weak and par∣tial humanity, by the dictates of a hu∣manity that is more generous and com∣prehensive. They reflect that mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent, and oppose to the emotions of compassion which they feel for a particular person, a more enlarged compassion, which they feel for mankind.</P>
<P>Sometimes too we have occasion to de∣fend the propriety of observing the general rules of justice by the consideration of their necessity to the support of society. We frequently hear the young and the licenti∣ous ridiculing the most sacred rules of mo∣rality, and professing, sometimes from the corruption, but more frequently from the vanity of their hearts, the most abomi∣nable maxims of conduct. Our indigna∣tion rouses, and we are eager to refute and expose such detestable principles. But tho' it is their intrinsic hatefulness and detest∣ableness, which originally inflames us against them, we are unwilling to assign this as the sole reason why we condemn them, or to pretend that it is merely be∣cause we ourselves hate and detest them.
<PB N="197" REF="210"/>
The reason, we think, would not appear to be conclusive. Yet why should it not; if we hate and detest them because they are the natural and proper objects of ha∣tred and detestation? But when we are asked why we should not act in such or such a manner, the very question seems to sup∣pose that, to those who ask it, this manner of acting does not appear to be for its own sake the natural and proper object of those sentiments. We must show them, there∣fore, that it ought to be so for the sake of something else. Upon this account we ge∣nerally cast about for other arguments, and the consideration which first occurs to us is the disorder and confusion of society which would result from the universal prevalence of such practices. We seldom fail, there∣fore, to insist upon this topic.</P>
<P>But tho' it commonly requires no great discernment to see the destructive tendency of all licentious practices to the welfare of society, it is seldom this consideration which first animates us against them. All men, even the most stupid and unthink∣ing, abhor fraud, perfidy, and injustice, and delight to see them punished. But few men have reflected upon the necessity
<PB N="198" REF="211"/>
of justice to the existence of society, how obvious soever that necessity may appear to be.</P>
<P>That it is not a regard to the preserva∣tion of society, which originally interests us in the punishment of crimes committed against individuals, may be demonstrated by many obvious considerations. The con∣cern which we take in the fortune and hap∣piness of individuals does not, in common cases, arise from that which we take in the fortune and happiness of society. We are no more concerned for the destruction or loss of a single man, because this man is a member or part of society, and because we should be concerned for the destruction of society, than we are concerned for the loss of a single guinea, because this guinea is a part of a thousand guineas, and be∣cause we should be concerned for the loss of the whole sum. In neither case does our regard for the individuals arise from our regard for the multitude; but in both cases our regard for the multitude is com∣pounded and made up of the particular regards which we feel for the different in∣dividuals of which it is composed. As when a small sum is unjustly taken from
<PB N="199" REF="212"/>
us we do not so much prosecute the injury from a regard to the preservation of our whole fortune, as from a regard to that particular sum which we have lost; so when a single man is injured or destroyed we demand the punishment of the wrong that has been done to him, not so much from a concern for the general interest of society, as from a concern for that very in∣dividual who has been injured. It is to be observed, however, that this concern does not necessarily include in it any de∣gree of those exquisite sentiments which are commonly called love, esteem and af∣fection, and by which we distinguish our particular friends and acquaintance. The concern which is requisite for this is no more than the general fellow-feeling which we have with every man merely because he is our fellow-creature. We enter into the resentment even of an odious person, when he is injured by those to whom he has given no provocation. Our disapprobation of his ordinary character and conduct does not in this case altogether prevent our fel∣low-feeling with his natural indignation; tho' with those who are not either extreme∣ly candid, or who have not been accus∣tomed
<PB N="200" REF="213"/>
to correct and regulate their natu∣ral sentiments by general rules, it is very apt to damp it.</P>
<P>Upon some occasions, indeed, we both punish and approve of punishment, mere∣ly from a view to the general interest of society, which, we imagine, cannot other∣wise be secured. Of this kind are all the punishments inflicted for breaches of what is called either civil police, or military dis∣cipline. Such crimes do not immediately or directly hurt any particular person; but their remote consequences, it is supposed, do produce, or might produce, either a considerable inconveniency, or a great dis∣order in the society. A centinel, for ex∣ample, who falls asleep upon his watch, suffers death by the laws of war, because such carelessness might endanger the whole army. This severity may, upon many oc∣casions, appear necessary, and, for that reason, just and proper. When the pre∣servation of an individual is inconsistent with the safety of a multitude, nothing can be more just than that the many should be preferred to the one. Yet this punishment, how necessary soever, always appears to be excessively severe. The natural atrocity of
<PB N="201" REF="214"/>
the crime seems to be so little, and the punishment so great, that it is with diffi∣culty that our heart can reconcile itself to it. Though such carelessness appears very blameable, yet the thought of this crime does not naturally excite any such resent∣ment, as would prompt us to take such dreadful revenge. A man of humanity must recollect himself, must make an ef∣fort, and exert his whole firmness and re∣solution, before he can bring himself either to inflict it, or to go along with it when it is inflicted by others. It is not, how∣ever, in this manner, that he looks upon the just punishment of an ungrateful mur∣derer or parricide. His heart, in this case, applauds with ardour, and even with trans∣port, the just retaliation which seems due to such detestable crimes, and which, if, by any accident, they should happen to escape, he would be highly enraged and disappointed. The very different senti∣ments with which the spectator views those different punishments, is a proof that his approbation of the one is far from being founded upon the same principles with that of the other. He looks upon the centinel as an unfortunate victim, who, indeed,
<PB N="202" REF="215"/>
must, and ought to be, devoted to the safety of numbers, but whom still, in his heart, he would be glad to save; and he is only sorry, that the interest of the many should oppose it. But if the murderer should escape from punishment, it would excite his highest indignation, and he would call upon God to avenge, in an∣other world, that crime which the injus∣tice of mankind had neglected to chastise upon earth.</P>
<P>For it well deserves to be taken notice of, that we are so far from imagining that injustice ought to be punished in this life, merely on account of the order of society, which cannot otherwise be maintained, that nature teaches us to hope, and reli∣gion authorises us to expect, that it will be punished, even in a life to come. Our sense of its ill desert pursues it, if I may say so, even beyond the grave, though the example of its punishment there cannot serve to deter the rest of mankind, who see it not, who know it not, from being guil∣ty of the like practices here. The justice of God, however, we think, still requires, that he should hereafter avenge the inju∣ries
<PB N="203" REF="216"/>
of the widow and the fatherless, who are here so often insulted with impunity.</P>
<P>That the Deity loves virtue and hates vice, as a voluptuous man loves riches and hates poverty, not for their own sakes, but for the effects which they tend to pro∣duce; that he loves the one, only because it promotes the happiness of society, which his benevolence prompts him to desire; and that he hates the other, only because it oc∣casions the misery of mankind, which the same divine quality renders the object of his aversion; is not the doctrine of nature, but of an artificial, though ingenious, re∣finement of philosophy. All our natural sentiments prompt us to believe, that as perfect virtue is supposed necessarily to ap∣pear to the Deity, as it does to us, for its own sake, and without any further view, the natural and proper object of love and reward, so must vice, of hatred and pu∣nishment. That the gods neither resent nor hurt, was the general maxim of all the different sects of the ancient philoso∣phy: and if, by resenting, be understood, that violent and disorderly perturbation, which often distracts and confounds the human breast; or if, by hurting, be un∣derstood,
<PB N="204" REF="217"/>
the doing mischief wantonly, and without regard to propriety or justice, such weakness is undoubtedly unworthy of the divine perfection. But if it be meant, that vice does not appear to the Deity to be, for its own sake, the object of abhor∣rence and aversion, and what, for its own sake, it is fit and right should be punished, the truth of this maxim can, by no means, be so easily admitted. If we consult our natural sentiments, we are apt to fear, lest before the holiness of God, vice should appear to be more worthy of punishment than the weakness and imperfection of hu∣man virtue can ever seem to be of reward. Man, when about to appear before a be∣ing of infinite perfection, can feel but little confidence in his own merit, or in the im∣perfect propriety of his own conduct. In the presence of his fellow-creatures, he may often justly elevate himself, and may of∣ten have reason to think highly of his own character and conduct, compared to the still greater imperfection of theirs. But the case is quite different when about to appear before his infinite Creator. To such a being, he can scarce imagine, that his littleness and weakness should ever seem
<PB N="205" REF="218"/>
to be the proper object, either of esteem or of reward. But he can easily conceive▪ how the numberless violations of duty, of which he has been guilty, should render him the proper object of aversion and pu∣nishment; neither can he see any reason why the divine indignation should not be let loose without any restraint, upon so vile an insect, as he is sensible that he himself must appear to be. If he would still hope for happiness, he is conscious that he can∣not demand it from the justice, but that he must entreat it from the mercy of God. Repentance, sorrow, humiliation, contri∣tion at the thought of his past conduct, are, upon this account, the sentiments which become him, and seem to be the only means which he has left for appeasing that wrath which, he knows, he has just∣ly provoked. He even distrusts the effi∣cacy of all these, and naturally fears, lest the wisdom of God should not, like the weakness of man, be prevailed upon to spare the crime, by the most importunate lamentations of the criminal. Some other intercession, some other sacrifice, some other atonement, he imagines, must be made for him, beyond what he himself is ca∣pable
<PB N="206" REF="219"/>
of making, before the purity of the divine justice can be reconciled to his ma∣nifold offences. The doctrines of revela∣tion coincide, in every respect, with those original anticipations of nature; and, as they teach us how little we can depend upon the imperfection of our own virtue, so they show us, at the same time, that the most powerful intercession has been made, and that the most dreadful atone∣ment has been paid for our manifold trans∣gressions and iniquities.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the influence of fortune upon the sen∣timents of mankind, with regard to the merit or demerit of actions.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER praise or blame can be due to any action, must be∣long either, first, to the intention or af∣fection of the heart, from which it pro∣ceeds; or, secondly, to the external action or movement of the body, which this affec∣tion gives occasion to; or last, to all the good or bad consequences, which actually, and in fact, proceed from it. These three different things constitute the whole na∣ture and circumstances of the action, and must be the foundation of whatever qua∣lity can belong to it.</P>
<P>That the two last of these three cir∣cumstances cannot be the foundation of any praise or blame, is abundantly evident; nor has the contrary ever been asserted by
<PB N="208" REF="221"/>
any body. The external action or move∣ment of the body is often the same in the most innocent, and in the most blameable actions. He who shoots a bird, and he who shoots a man, both of them perform the same external movement: each of them draws the tricker of a gun. The conse∣quences which actually, and in fact, hap∣pen to proceed from any action, are, if possible, still more indifferent either to praise or blame, than even the external movement of the body. As they depend, not upon the agent, but upon fortune, they cannot be the proper foundation for any sentiment, of which his character and conduct are the objects.</P>
<P>The only consequences for which he can be answerable, or by which he can deserve either approbation or disapprobation of any kind, are those which were some way or other intended, or those which, at least, show some agreeable or disagreeable qua∣lity in the intention of the heart, from which he acted. To the intention or af∣fection of the heart, therefore, to the pro∣priety or impropriety, to the beneficence or hurtfulness of the design, all praise or blame, all approbation or disapprobation,
<PB N="209" REF="222"/>
of any kind, which can justly be bestowed upon any action must ultimately belong.</P>
<P>When this maxim is thus proposed, in abstract and general terms, there is no body who does not agree to it. It's self-evident justice is acknowledged by all the world, and there is not a dissenting voice among all mankind. Every body allows, that, how different soever the accidental, the unintended and unforeseen consequen∣ces of different actions, yet, if the in∣tentions or affections from which they arose were, on the one hand, equally proper and equally beneficent, or, on the other, equally improper and equally male∣volent, the merit or demerit of the actions is still the same, and the agent is equally the suitable object either of gratitude or of resentment.</P>
<P>But how well soever we may seem to be persuaded of the truth of this equitable maxim, when we consider it after this manner, in abstract, yet when we come to particular cases, the actual consequen∣ces which happen to proceed from any action, have a very great effect upon our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiments concerning its merit or demerit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd almost always either enhance or di∣minish
<PB N="210" REF="223"/>
our sense of both. Scarce, in any one instance, perhaps, will our sentiments be found, after examination, to be en∣tirely regulated by this rule, which we all acknowledge ought entirely to regulate them.</P>
<P>This irregularity of sentiment, which every body feels, which scarce any body is suf∣ficiently aware of, and which no body is willing to acknowledge, I proceed now to explain; and I shall consider, first, the cause which gives occasion to it, or the me∣chanism by which nature produces it; se∣condly, the extent of its influence; and, last of all, the end which it answers, or the purpose which the author of nature seems to have intended by it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the causes of this influence of fortune.</HEAD>
<P>THE causes of pain and pleasure, whatever they are, or however they operate, seem to be the ob∣jects, which, in all animals, immediately excite those two passions of gratitude and
<PB N="211" REF="224"/>
resentment. They are excited by inani∣mated, as well as by animated objects. We are angry, for a moment, even at the stone that hurts us. A child beats it, a dog barks at it, a choleric man is apt to curse it. The least reflection, indeed, cor∣rects this sentiment, and we soon become sensible, that what has no feeling is a very improper object of revenge. When the mischief, however, is very great, the ob∣ject which caused it becomes disagreeable to us ever after, and we take pleasure to burn or destroy it. We should treat, in this manner, the instrument which had accidentally been the cause of the death of a friend, and we should often think ourselves guilty of a sort of inhumanity, if we neglected to vent this absurd sort of vengeance upon it.</P>
<P>We conceive, in the same manner, a sort of gratitude for those inanimated ob∣jects, which have been the causes of great, or frequent pleasure to us. The sailor, who, as soon as he got ashore, should mend his fire with the plank upon which he had just escaped from a shipwreck, would seem to be guilty of an unnatural action. We should expect that he would
<PB N="212" REF="225"/>
rather preserve it with care and affection, as a monument that was, in some mea∣sure, dear to him. A man grows fond of a snuff-box, of a pen-knife, of a staff which he has long made use of, and con∣ceives something like a real love and af∣fection for them. If he breaks or loses them, he is vexed out of all proportion to the value of the damage. The house which we have long lived in, the tree, whose verdure and shade we have long enjoyed, are both looked upon with a sort of re∣spect that seems due to such benefactors. The decay of the one, or the ruin of the other, affects us with a kind of melancho∣ly, though we should sustain no loss by it. The Dryads and the Lares of the ancients, a sort of genii of trees and houses, were probably first suggested by this sort of af∣fection, which the authors of those super∣stitions felt for such objects, and which seemed unreasonable, if there was nothing animated about them.</P>
<P>But, before any thing can be the proper object of gratitude or resentment, it must not only be the cause of pleasure or pain, it must likewise be capable of feeling them. Without this other quality, those passions
<PB N="213" REF="226"/>
cannot vent themselves with any sort of sa∣tisfaction upon it. As they are excited by the causes of pleasure and pain, so their gra∣tification consists in retaliating those sensati∣ons upon what gave occasion to them; which it is to no purpose to attempt upon what has no sensibility. Animals, therefore, are less improper objects of gratitude and re∣sentment than inanimated objects. The dog that bites, the ox that gores, are both of them punished. If they have been the causes of the death of any person, neither the public, nor the relations of the slain, can be satisfied, unless they are put to death in their turn: nor is this merely for the security of the living, but, in some measure, to revenge the injury of the dead. Those animals, on the contrary, that have been remark∣ably serviceable to their masters, become the objects of a very lively gratitude. We are shocked at the brutality of that officer mentioned in the Turkish Spy, who stab∣bed he horse that had carried him a-cross an arm of the sea, lest that animal should afterwards distinguish some other person by a similar adventure.</P>
<P>But, though animals are not only the causes of pleasure and pain, but are also ca∣pable of feeling those sensations, they are
<PB N="214" REF="227"/>
still far from being compleat and perfect objects, either of gratitude or resentment; and those passions still feel, that there is something wanting to their entire gratifi∣cation. What gratitude chiefly desires, is not only to make the benefactor feel plea∣sure in his turn, but to make him conscious that he meets with this reward on account of his past conduct, to make him pleased with that conduct, and to satisfy him, that the person upon whom he bestowed his good offices was not unworthy of them. What most of all charms us in our bene∣factor, is the concord between his senti∣ments and our own, with regard to what interests us so nearly as the worth of our own character, and the esteem that is due to us. We are delighted to find a person who values us as we value ourselves, and distinguishes us from the rest of mankind, with an attention not unlike that with which we distinguish ourselves. To main∣tain in him these agreeable and flattering sentiments, is one of the chief ends pro∣posed by the returns we are disposed to make to him. A generous mind often dis∣dains the interested thought of extorting new favours from its benefactor, by what
<PB N="215" REF="228"/>
may be called the importunities of its gra∣titude. But to preserve and to increase his esteem, is an interest which the greatest mind does not think unworthy of its at∣tention. And this is the foundation of what I formerly observed, that when we cannot enter into the motives of our bene∣factor, when his conduct and character appear unworthy of our approbation, let his services have been ever so great, our gratitude is always sensibly diminished. We are less flattered by the distinction; and to preserve the esteem of so weak, or so worthless a patron, seems to be an ob∣ject which does not deserve to be pursued for its own sake.</P>
<P>The object, on the contrary, which re∣sentment is chiefly intent upon, is not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as to make him conscious that he feels it upon account of his past conduct, to make him repent of that conduct, and to make him sensible, that the person whom he injured did not deserve to be treated in that manner. What chiefly enrages us against the man who injures or insults us, is the little account which he seems to make of us, the unreasonable preference which
<PB N="216" REF="229"/>
he gives to himself above us, and that ab∣surd self-love, by which he seems to ima∣gine, that other people may be sacrificed at any time, to his conveniency or his humour. The glaring impropriety of this conduct, the gross insolence and in∣justice which it seems to involve in it, often shock and exasperate us more than all the mischief which we have suffered. To bring him back to a more just sense of what is due to other people, to make him sen∣sible of what he owes us, and of the wrong that he has done to us, is frequently the principal end proposed in our revenge, which is always imperfect when it cannot accomplish this. When our enemy ap∣pears to have done us no injury, when we are sensible that he acted quite properly, that, in his situation, we should have done the same thing, and that we deserved from him all the mischief we met with; in that case, if we have the least spark either of candour or justice, we can entertain no sort of resentment.</P>
<P>Before any thing, therefore, can be the compleat and proper object, either of gra∣titude or resentment, it must possess three different qualifications. First, it must be the cause of pleasure in the one case,
<PB N="217" REF="230"/>
and of pain in the other. Secondly, it must be capable of feeling those sensations. And, thirdly, it must not only have produced those sensations, but it must have produced them from design, and from a design that is approved or in the one case, and dis∣approved of in the other. It is by the first qualification, that any object is ca∣pable of exciting those passions: it is by the second, that it is in any respect capable of gratifying them: the third qualification is both necessary for their compleat satisfac∣tion, and as it gives a pleasure or pain that is both exquisite and peculiar, it is likewise an additional exciting cause of those passions.</P>
<P>As what gives pleasure or pain, there∣fore, either in one way or another, is the sole exciting cause of gratitude and resent∣ment; though the intentions of any per∣son should be ever so proper and beneficent, on the one hand, or ever so improper and malevolent on the other; yet, if he has failed in producing either the good or the evil which he intended, as one of the ex∣citing causes is wanting in both cases, less gratitude seems due to him in the one, and less resentment in the other. And, on the contrary, though in the intentions of any
<PB N="218" REF="231"/>
person, there was either no laudable de∣gree of benevolence, on the one hand, or no blameable degree of malice on the o∣ther, yet, if his actions should produce either great good or great evil, as one of the exciting causes takes place upon both these occasions, some gratitude is apt to arise towards him in the one, and some resentment in the other. A shadow of merit seems to fall upon him in the first, a shadow of demerit in the second. And, as the consequences of actions are alto∣gether under the empire of fortune, hence arises her influence upon the sentiments of mankind, with regard to merit and demerit.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the extent of this influence of fortune.</HEAD>
<P>THE effect of this influence of for∣tune is, first, to diminish our sense of the merit or demerit of those actions which arose from the most laudable or blameable intentions, when they fail of producing their proposed effects: and, se∣condly, to increase our sense of the merit
<PB N="219" REF="232"/>
or demerit of actions, beyond what is due to the motives or affections from which they proceed, when they accidentally give occasion either to extraordinary pleasure or pain.</P>
<P N="1">I. First, I say, though the intentions of any person should be ever so proper and beneficent, on the one hand, or ever so improper and malevolent, on the other, yet, if they fail in producing their effects, his merit seems imperfect in the one case, and his demerit incompleat in the other. Nor is this irregularity of sentiment felt only by those who are immediately affec∣ted by the consequence of any action. It is felt, in some measure, even by the im∣partial spectator. The man who solicits an office for another, without obtaining it, is regarded as his friend, and seems to deserve his love and affection. But the man who not only solicits, but procures it, is more peculiarly considered as his pa∣tron and benefactor, and as intitled to his respect and gratitude. The person obliged, we are apt to think, may, with some jus∣tice, imagine himself on a level with the first; but we cannot enter in his senti∣ments, if he does not feel himself inferior
<PB N="220" REF="233"/>
to the second. It is common indeed to say, that we are equally obliged to the man who has endeavoured to serve us, as to him who actually did so. It is the speech which we constantly make upon every un∣successful attempt of this kind; but which, like all other fine speeches, must be under∣stood with a grain of allowance. The senti∣ments which a man of generosity entertains for the friend who fails, may often indeed be nearly the same with those which he conceives for him who succeeds: and the more generous he is, the more nearly will those sentiments approach to an exact level. With the truly generous, to be beloved, to be esteemed by those whom they them∣selves think worthy of esteem, gives more pleasure, and thereby excites more gratitude, than all the advantages which they can ever expect from those sentiments. When they lose those advantages therefore, they seem to lose but a trifle, which is scarce worth regarding. They still however lose something. Their pleasure therefore, and consequently their gratitude, is not perfect∣ly compleat: and accordingly if, between the friend who fails and the friend who succeeds, all other circumstances are equal,
<PB N="221" REF="234"/>
there will, even in the noblest and the best mind, be some little difference of affec∣tion in favour of him who succeeds. Nay, so unjust are mankind in this respect, that though the intended benefit should be pro∣cured, yet if it is not procured by the means of a particular benefactor, they are apt to think that less gratitude is due to the man, who with the best intentions in the world could do no more than help it a little forward. As their gratitude is in this case divided among the different per∣sons who contributed to their pleasure, a smaller share of it seems due to any one. Such a person, we hear men commonly say, intended no doubt to serve us; and we really believe exerted himself to the utmost of his abilities for that purpose. We are not, however, obliged to him for this be∣nefit; since had it not been for the con∣currence of others, all that he could have done would never have brought it about. This consideration, they imagine, should, even in the eyes of the impartial specta∣tor, diminish the debt which they owe to him. The person himself who has unsuc∣cessfully endeavoured to confer a benefit, has by no means the same dependency up∣on
<PB N="222" REF="235"/>
the gratitude of the man whom he meant to oblige, nor the same sense of his own merit towards him which he would have had in the case of success.</P>
<P>Even the merit of talents and abilities which some accident has hindered from producing their effects, seems in some mea∣sure imperfect, even to those who are ful∣ly convinced of their capacity to produce them. The general who has been hinder∣ed by the envy of ministers from gaining some great advantage over the enemies of his country, regrets the loss of the oppor∣tunity for ever after. Nor is it only upon account of the public that he regrets it. He laments that he was hindered from per∣forming an action which would have ad∣ded a new lustre to his character in his own eyes, as well as in those of every o∣ther person. It satisfies neither himself nor others to reflect that the plan or design was all that depended on him, that no greater capacity was required to execute it than what was necessary to concert it: that he was allowed to be every way ca∣pable of executing it, and that had he been permitted to go on, success was infal∣lible. He still did not execute it; and
<PB N="223" REF="236"/>
though he might deserve all the approba∣tion which is due to a magnanimous and great design, he still wanted the actual me∣rit of having performed a great action. To take the management of any affair of public concern from the man who has al∣most brought it to a conclusion, is regard∣ed as the most invidious injustice. As he had done so much, he should, we think, have been allowed to acquire the compleat merit of putting an end to it. It was ob∣jected to Pompey, that he came in upon the victories of Lucullus, and gathered those laurels which were due to the fortune and valour of another. The glory of Lu∣cullus, it seems, was less compleat even in the opinion of his own friends, when he was not permitted to finish that conquest which his conduct and courage had put in the power of almost any man to finish. It mortifies an architect when his plans are either not executed at all, or when they are so far altered as to spoil the effect of the building. The plan, however, is all that depends upon the architect. The whole of his genius is, to good judges, as compleatly discovered in that as in the ac∣tual execution. But a plan does not, even
<PB N="224" REF="237"/>
to the most intelligent, give the same plea∣sure as a noble and magnificent building. They may discover as much both of taste and genius in the one as in the other. But their effects are still vastly different, and the amusement derived from the first, ne∣ver approaches to the wonder and admi∣ration which are sometimes excited by the second. We may believe of many men, that their talents are superior to those of Caesar and Alexander; and that in the same situations they would perform still greater actions. In the mean time, however, we do not behold them with that astonish∣ment and admiration with which those two heroes have been regarded in all ages and na∣tions. The calm judgments of the mind may approve of them more, but they want the splendor of great actions to dazzle and trans∣port it. The superiority of virtues and talents have not, even upon those who acknowledge that superiority, the same effect with the superiority of atchievements.</P>
<P>As the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to do good seems thus, in the eyes of un∣grateful mankind, to be diminished by the miscarriage, so does likewise the demerit of an unsuccessful attempt to do evil. The
<PB N="225" REF="238"/>
design to commit a crime, how clearly so∣ever it may be proved, is scarce ever pu∣nished with the same severity as the actual commission of it. The case of treason is perhaps the only exception. That crime immediately affecting the being of the government itself, the government is naturally more jealous of it than of any other. In the punishment of treason, the sovereign resents the injuries which are immediately done to himself: in the pu∣nishment of other crimes, he resents those which are done to other men. It is his own resentment which he indulges in the one case: it is that of his subjects which by sympathy he enters into in the other. In the first case, therefore, as he judges in his own cause, he is very apt to be more violent and sanguinary in his punishments than the impartial spectator can approve of. His resentment too rises here upon smaller occasions, and does not always, as in other cases, wait for the perpetration of the crime, or even for the attempt to com∣mit it. A treasonable concert, tho' nothing has been done, or even attempted in con∣sequence of it, nay, a treasonable conver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, is in many countries punished in
<PB N="226" REF="239"/>
the same manner as the actual commission of treason. With regard to all other crimes, the mere design, upon which no attempt has followed, is seldom punished at all, and is never punished severely. A criminal design, and a criminal action, it may be said indeed, do not necessarily sup∣pose the same degree of depravity, and ought not therefore to be subjected to the same punishment. We are capable, it may be said, of resolving, and even of taking measures to execute, many things which, when it comes to the point, we feel ourselves altogether incapable of execu∣ting. But this reason can have no place when the design has been carried the length of the last attempt. The man, however, who fires a pistol at his enemy, but misses him, is punished with death by the laws of scarce any country. By the old law of Scotland, tho' he should wound him, yet, unless death ensues within a cer∣tain time, the assassine is not liable to the last punishment. The resentment of man∣kind, however, runs so high against thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crime, their terror for the man who show himself capable of committing it is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great, that the mere attempt to commit i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="227" REF="240"/>
ought in all countries to be capital. The attempt to commit smaller crimes is almost always punished very lightly, and some∣times is not punished at all. The thief, whose hand has been caught in his neigh∣bour's pocket before he had taken any thing out of it, is punished with ignominy only. If he had got time to take away an handkerchief, he would have been put to death. The house-breaker, who has been found setting a ladder to his neighbour's window, but had not got into it, is not exposed to the capital punishment. The at∣tempt to ravish is not punished as a rape. The attempt to seduce a married woman is not punished at all, tho' seduction is pu∣nished severely. Our resentment against the person who only attempted to do a mis∣chief is seldom so strong as to bear us out in inflicting the same punishment upon him which we should have thought due if he had actually done it. In the one case, the joy of our deliverance alleviates our sense of the atrocity of his conduct; in the other, the grief for our misfortune in∣creases it. His real demerit, however, is undoubtedly the same in both cases, since his intentions were equally criminal; and
<PB N="228" REF="241"/>
there is in this respect, therefore, an irre∣gularity in the sentiments of all men, and a consequent relaxation of discipline in the laws of, I believe, all nations, of the most civilized, as well as of the most barbarous. The humanity of a civilized people dis∣poses them either to dispense with, or to mi∣tigate punishments wherever their natural indignation is not goaded on by the conse∣quences of the crime. Barbarians, on the other hand, when no actual consequence has happened from any action, are not apt to be very delicate or inquisitive about the motives.</P>
<P>The person himself who either from passion, or from the influence of bad com∣pany, has resolved, and perhaps taken measures to perpetrate some crime, but who has fortunately been prevented by an acci∣dent which put it out of his power, is sure, if he has any remains of conscience, to re∣gard this event all his life after as a great and signal deliverance. He can never think of it without returning thanks to Heaven for having been thus graciously pleased to save him from the guilt into which he was just ready to plunge himself, and to hinder him from rendering all the rest of his life a
<PB N="229" REF="242"/>
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene of horror, remorse, and repentance. But tho' his hands are innocent, he is con∣scious that his heart is equally guilty as if he had actually executed what he was so fully resolved upon. It gives great ease to his conscience, however, to consider that the crime was not executed, tho' he knows that the failure arose from no virtue in him. He still considers himself as less de∣serving of punishment and resentment; and this good fortune either diminishes, or takes away altogether, all sense of guilt. To remember how much he was resolved upon it, has no other effect than to make him regard his escape as the greater and more miraculous: for he still fancies that he has escaped, and he looks back upon the danger to which his peace of mind was exposed, with that terror, with which one who is in safety may sometimes remem∣ber the hazard he was in of falling over a precipice, and shudder with horror at the thought.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second effect of this influence of fortune, is to increase our sense of the me∣rit or demerit of actions beyond what is due to the motives or affection from which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey proceed, when they happen to give
<PB N="230" REF="243"/>
occasion to extraordinary pleasure or pain. The agreeable or disagreeable effects of the action often throw a shadow of merit or demerit upon the agent, tho' in his inten∣tion there was nothing that deserved either praise or blame, or at least that deserved them in the degree in which we are apt to bestow them. Thus, even the messenger of bad news is disagreeable to us, and, on the contrary, we feel a sort of gratitude for the man who brings us good tidings. For a moment we look upon them both as the authors, the one of our good, the other of our bad fortune, and regard them in some measure as if they had really brought about the events which they only give an account of. The first author of our joy is natural∣ly the object of a transitory gratitude: we embrace him with warmth and affection, and should be glad, during the instant of our prosperity, to reward him as for some signal service. By the custom of all courts, the officer, who brings the news of a vic∣tory, is intitled to considerable preferments, and the general always chuses one of his principal favourites to go upon so agree∣able an errand. The first author of our sorrow is, on the contrary, just as natural∣ly
<PB N="231" REF="244"/>
the object of a transitory resentment. We can scarce avoid looking upon him with chagrine and uneasiness; and the rude and brutal are apt to vent upon him that spleen which his intelligence gives oc∣casion to. Tigranes, King of Armenia, struck off the head of the man who brought him the first account of the approach of a formidable enemy. To punish in this manner the author of bad tidings, seems barbarous and inhuman: yet, to reward the messenger of good news, is not disagree∣able to us; we think it suitable to the bounty of kings. But why do we make this difference, since, if there is no fault in the one, neither is there any merit in the other? It is because any sort of reason seems sufficient to authorize the ex∣ertion of the social and benevolent affec∣tions; but it requires the most solid and substantial to make us enter into that of the unsocial and malevolent.</P>
<P>But tho' in general we are averse to enter into the unsocial and malevolent affections, tho' we lay it down for a rule that we ought never to approve of their gratifica∣tion unless so far as the malicious and un∣just intention of the person, against whom
<PB N="232" REF="245"/>
they are directed, renders him their proper object; yet, upon some occasions, we relax of this severity. When the negligence of one man has occasioned some unintended damage to another, we generally enter so far into the resentment of the sufferer, as to approve of his inflicting a punishment upon the offender much beyond what the offence would have appeared to deserve, had no such unlucky consequence followed from it.</P>
<P>There is a degree of negligence, which would appear to deserve some chastise∣ment tho' it should occasion no damage to any body. Thus, if a person should throw a large stone over a wall into a public street without giving warning to those who might be passing by, and without regard∣ing where it was likely to fall, he would undoubtedly deserve some chastisement. A very accurate police would punish so ab∣surd an action, even tho' it had done no mischief. The person who has been guilty of it, shows an insolent contempt of the happiness and safety of others. There is real injustice in his conduct. He wanton∣ly exposes his neighbour to what no man in his senses would chuse to expose himself,
<PB N="233" REF="246"/>
and evidently wants that sense of what is due to his fellow creatures which is the ba∣sis of justice and of society. Gross negli∣gence therefore is, in the law, said to be al∣most equal to malicious design <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lata culpa prope dolum est.</NOTE>. When any unlucky consequences happen from such carelessness, the person who has been guilty of it is often punished as if he had really intended those consequences; and his conduct, which was only thoughtless and insolent, and what deserved some chastisement, is considered as atrocious, and as liable to the severest punishment. Thus if, by the imprudent action above mentioned, he should accidentally kill a man, he is, by the laws of many coun∣tries, particularly by the old law of Scot∣land, liable to the last punishment. And tho' this is no doubt excessively severe, it is not altogether inconsistent with our natu∣ral sentiments. Our just indignation a∣gainst the folly and inhumanity of his conduct is exasperated by our sympathy with the unfortunate sufferer. Nothing however would appear more shocking to our natural sense of equity, than to bring a man to the scaffold merely for having
<PB N="234" REF="247"/>
thrown a stone carelessly into the street without hurting any body. The folly and inhumanity of his conduct, however, would in this case be the same; but still our sen∣timents would be very different. The con∣sideration of this difference may satisfy us how much the indignation, even of the spectator, is apt to be animated by the actual consequences of the action. In cases of this kind there will, if I am not mis∣taken, be found a great degree of severity in the laws of almost all nations; as I have already observed that in those of an op∣posite kind there was a very general re∣laxation of discipline.</P>
<P>There is another degree of negligence which does not involve in it any sort of in∣justice. The person who is guilty of it treats his neighbour as he treats himself, means no harm to any body, and is far from entertaining any insolent contempt for the safety and happiness of others. He is not, however, so careful and circumspect in his conduct as he ought to be, and de∣serves upon this account some degree of blame and censure, but no sort of punish∣ment. Yet if by a negligence <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Culpa levis.</NOTE> of this kind
<PB N="235" REF="248"/>
he should occasion some damage to an∣other person, he is by the laws of, I be∣lieve, all countries, obliged to compensate it. And though this is no doubt a real punishment, and what no mortal would have thought of inflicting upon him, had it not been for the unlucky accident which his conduct gave occasion to; yet this de∣cision of the law is approved of by the na∣tural sentiments of all mankind. Nothing, we think, can be more just than that one man should not suffer by the carelessness of another; and that the damage occasioned by blameable negligence should be made up by the person who was guilty of it.</P>
<P>There is another species of negligence <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Culpa levissima.</NOTE>, which consists merely in a want of the most anxious timidity and circumspection, with regard to all the possible consequences of our actions. The want of this painful at∣tention, when no bad consequences follow from it, is so far from being regarded as blameable, that the contrary quality is ra∣ther considered as such. That timid circum∣spection which is afraid of every thing, is never regarded as a virtue, but as a qua∣lity which more than any other incapacitates
<PB N="236" REF="249"/>
for action and business. Yet when, from a want of this excessive care, a person hap∣pens to occasion some damage to another, he is often by the law obliged to compen∣sate it. Thus, by the Aquilian law, the man, who not being able to manage a horse that had accidentally taken fright, should happen to ride down his neighbour's slave, is obliged to compensate the damage. When an accident of this kind happens, we are apt to think that he ought not to have rode such a horse, and to regard his attempting it as an unpardonable levity; though without this accident we should not only have made no such reflection, but should have regarded his refusing it as the effect of timid weakness, and of an an∣xiety about merely possible effects, which it is to no purpose to be aware of. The person himself, who by an accident even of this kind has involuntarily hurt another, seems to have some sense of his own ill de∣sert, with regard to him. He naturally runs up to the sufferer to express his con∣cern for what has happened, and to make every acknowledgment in his power. If he has any sensibility, he necessarily desires to compensate the damage, and to do every
<PB N="237" REF="250"/>
thing he can to appease that animal resent∣ment, which he is sensible will be apt to arise in the breast of the sufferer. To make no apology, to offer no atonement, is re∣garded as the highest brutality. Yet why should he make an apology more than any other person? Why should he, since he was equally innocent with any other by∣stander, be thus singled out from among all mankind, to make up for the bad for∣tune of another? This task would surely never be imposed upon him, did not even the impartial spectator feel some indul∣gence for what may be regarded as the un∣just resentment of that other.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the final cause of this irregularity of sentiments.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the effect of the good or bad consequences of actions upon the sen∣timents both of the person who performs them, and of others; and thus, fortune, which governs the world, has some influ∣ence where we should be least willing to allow her any, and directs in some mea∣sure
<PB N="238" REF="251"/>
the sentiments of mankind, with re∣gard to the character and conduct both of themselves and others. That the world judges by the event, and not by the design, has been in all ages the complaint, and is the great discouragement of virtue. Every body agrees to the general maxim, that as the event does not depend on the agent, it ought to have no influence upon our sentiments, with regard to the merit or propriety of his conduct. But when we come to particulars, we find that our sen∣timents are scarce in any one instance ex∣actly conformable to what this equitable maxim would direct. The happy or un∣prosperous event of any action, is not on∣ly apt to give us a good or bad opinion of the prudence with which it was conduct∣ed, but almost always too animates our gratitude or resentment, our sense of the merit or demerit of the design.</P>
<P>Nature, however, when she implanted the seeds of this irregularity in the human breast, seems, as upon all other occasions, to have intended the happiness and perfec∣tion of the species. If the hurtfulness of the design, if the malevolence of the affec∣tion, were alone the causes which excit∣ed
<PB N="239" REF="252"/>
our resentment, we should feel all the furies of that passion against any person in whose breast we suspected or believed such designs or affections were haboured, though they had never broke out into any action. Sentiments, thoughts, intentions, would become the objects of punishment; and if the indignation of mankind run as high against them as against actions; if the baseness of the thought which had given birth to no action, seemed in the eyes of the world as much to call aloud for vengeance as the baseness of the action, every court of judicature would become a real inquisition. There would be no safety for the most innocent and circum∣spect conduct. Bad wishes, bad views, bad designs, might still be suspected; and while these excited the same indignation with bad conduct, while bad intentions were as much resented as bad actions, they would equally expose the person to punish∣ment and resentment. Actions therefore which either produce actual evil, or at∣tempt to produce it, and thereby put us in the immediate fear of it, are by the au∣thor of nature rendered the only proper and approved objects of human punish∣ment
<PB N="230" REF="253" MS="y"/>
and resentment. Sentiments, designs, affections, though it is from these that ac∣cording to cool reason human actions derive their whole merit or demerit, are placed by the great Judge of hearts beyond the li∣mits of every human jurisdiction, and are reserved for the cognizance of his own un∣erring tribunal. That necessary rule of justice, therefore, that men in this life are liable to punishment for their actions on∣ly, not for their designs and intentions, is founded upon this salutary and useful ir∣regularity in human sentiments concern∣ing merit or demerit, which at first sight appears so absurd and unaccountable. But every part of nature, when attentively surveyed, equally demonstrates the provi∣dential care of its author, and we may ad∣mire the wisdom and goodness of God even in the weakness and folly of men.</P>
<P>Nor is that irregularity of sentiments altogether without its utility, by which the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to serve, and much more that of meer good inclinations and kind wishes, appears to be imperfect. Man was made for action, and to promote by the exertion of his faculties such changes in the external circumstances
<PB N="241" REF="254"/>
both of himself and others, as may seem most favourable to the happiness of all. He must not be satisfied with indolent be∣nevolence, nor fancy himself the friend of mankind, because in his heart he wishes well to the prosperity of the world. That he may call forth the whole vigour of his soul, and strain every nerve, in order to produce those ends which it is the purpose of his being to advance, nature has taught him, that neither himself nor mankind can be fully satisfied with his conduct, nor be∣stow upon it the full measure of applause, unless he has actually produced them. He is made to know, that the praise of good intentions, without the merit of good of∣fices, will be but of little avail to excite either the loudest acclamations of the world, or even the highest degree of self-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pplause. The man who has performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o single action of importance, but whose whole conversation and deportment express <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he justest, the noblest, and most generous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiments, can be intitled to demand no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery high reward, even tho' his inutility <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be owing to nothing but the want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f an opportunity to serve. We can still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efuse it him without blame. We can
<PB N="242" REF="255"/>
still ask him, What have you done? What actual service can you produce, to intitle you to so great a recompence? We esteem you, and love you; but we owe you no∣thing. To reward indeed that latent vir∣tue which has been useless only for want of an opportunity to serve, to bestow upon it those honours and preferments which, tho' in some measure it may be said to deserve them, it could not with propriety have in∣sisted upon, is the effect of the most divine benevolence. To punish, on the contrary, for the affections of the heart only, where no crime has been committed, is the most insolent and barbarous tyranny. The be∣nevolent affections seem to deserve most praise, when they do not wait till it be∣comes almost a crime for them not to exert themselves. The malevolent, on the con∣trary, can scarce be too tardy, too slow or deliberate.</P>
<P>It is even of use that the evil which is done without design should be regarded as a misfortune to the doer as well as to the sufferer. Man is thereby taught to reve∣rence the happiness of his brethren, to tremble lest he should, even unknowingly, do any thing that can hurt them, and to
<PB N="243" REF="256"/>
dread that animal resentment which he feels is ready to burst out against him, if he should without design be the unhappy ins∣trument of their calamity.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, however, all these seeming irregularities of sentiment, if man should unfortunately either give occasion to those evils which he did not intend, or fail in producing that good which he intended, nature has not left his innocence altogether without consolation, nor his virtue alto∣gether without reward. He then calls to his assistance that just and equitable ma∣xim, that those events which did not de∣pend upon our conduct ought not to di∣minish the esteem that is due to us. He summons up his whole magnanimity and firmness of soul, and strives to regard him∣self, not in the light in which he at present appears, but in that in which he ought to appear, in which he would have appeared had his generous designs been crowned with success, and in which he would still appear notwithstanding their miscarriage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the sentiments of mankind were either altogether candid and equitable, or even perfectly consistent with themselves. The more candid and humane part of mankind
<PB N="244" REF="257"/>
intirely go along with the effort which he thus makes to support himself in his own opinion. They exert their whole genero∣sity and greatness of mind, to correct in themselves this irregularity of human na∣ture, and endeavour to regard his unfor∣tunate magnanimity in the same light in which, had it been successful, they would, without any such generous exertion, have naturally been disposed to consider it.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. Of the foundation of our judgments concerning our own sentiments and conduct, and of the sense of duty.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the consciousness of merited praise or blame.</HEAD>
<P>IN the two foregoing parts of this dis∣course, I have chiefly considered the origin and foundation of our judgments concerning the sentiments and conduct of others. I come now to consider the ori∣gin of those concerning our own.</P>
<P>The desire of the approbation and esteem of those we live with, which is of so much importance to our happiness, cannot be fully and intirely contented but by render∣ing ourselves the just and proper objects of those sentiments, and by adjusting our own character and conduct according to those measures and rules by which esteem and approbation are naturally bestowed. It is
<PB N="246" REF="259"/>
not sufficient, that from ignorance or mis∣take, esteem and approbation should some way or other be bestowed upon us. If we are conscious that we do not deserve to be so favourably thought of, and that, if the truth was known, we should be regarded with very opposite sentiments, our satisfac∣tion is far from being complete. The man who applauds us either for actions which we did not perform, or for motives which had no sort of influence upon our conduct, applauds not us, but another person. We can derive no sort of satisfaction from his praises. To us they should be more mor∣tifying than any censure, and should per∣petually call to our minds, the most hum∣bling of all reflexions, the reflexion upon what we ought to be, but what we are not. A woman who paints to conceal her ugli∣ness, could derive, one should imagine, but little vanity from the compliments that are paid to her beauty. These, we should ex∣pect, ought rather to put her in mind of the sentiments which her real complexion would excite, and mortify her the more by the contrast. To be pleased with such ground∣less applause is a proof of the most super∣ficial levity and weakness. It is what is
<PB N="247" REF="260"/>
properly called vanity, and is the founda∣tion of the most ridiculous and contempti∣ble vices, the vices of affectation and com∣mon lying; follies which, if experience did not teach us how common they are, one should imagine the least spark of com∣mon sense would save us from. The fool∣ish lyar, who endeavours to excite the ad∣miration of the company by the relation of adventures which never had any exis∣tence, the important coxcomb who gives himself airs of rank and distinction which he well knows he has no just pretensions to, are both of them, no doubt, pleased with the applause which they fancy they meet with. But their vanity arises from so gross an illusion of the imagination, that it is diffi∣cult to conceive how any rational creature should be imposed upon by it. When they place themselves in the situation of those whom they fancy they have deceived, they are struck with the highest admiration for their own persons. They look upon themselves, not in that light in which, they know, they ought to appear to their companions, but in that in which they believe their compa∣nions actually look upon them. Their su∣perficial weakness and trivial folly hinder
<PB N="248" REF="261"/>
them from ever turning their eyes inwards, or from seeing themselves in that despi∣cable point of view in which their own consciences should tell them that they would appear to every body, if the real truth should ever come to be known.</P>
<P>As ignorant and groundless praise can give no solid joy, no satisfaction that will bear any serious examination, so, on the contrary, it often gives real comfort to re∣flect, that tho' no praise should actually be bestowed upon us, our conduct, however, has been such as to deserve it, and has been in every respect suitable to those mea∣sures and rules by which praise and appro∣bation are naturally and commonly bestow∣ed. We are pleased not only with praise, but with having done what is praise-worthy. We are pleased to think that we have rendered ourselves the natural objects of approbation, though no approbation should ever actually be bestowed upon us: and we are mortified to reflect that we have justly incurred the blame of those we live with, though that sentiment should never actually be exerted against us. The man who is conscious to himself that he has exactly observed those measures of
<PB N="249" REF="262"/>
conduct which experience informs him are generally agreeable, reflects with satisfac∣tion on the propriety of his own behaviour; when he views it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it, he thoroughly enters into all the motives which influenced it; he looks back upon every part of it with pleasure and approbation, and tho' mankind should never be acquaint∣ed with what he has done, he regards him∣self not so much according to the light in which they actually regard him, as accord∣ing to that, in which they would regard him if they were better informed. He an∣ticipates the applause and admiration which in this case would be bestowed upon him, and he applauds and admires himself by sympathy with sentiments which do not indeed actually take place, but which the ignorance of the public alone hinders from taking place, which he knows are the na∣tural and ordinary effects of such conduct, which his imagination strongly connects with it, and which he has acquired a habit of conceiving as something that naturally and in propriety ought to flow from it. Men have often volun∣tarily thrown away life to acquire after
<PB N="250" REF="263"/>
death a renown which they could no longer enjoy. Their imagination, in the mean time, anticipated that fame which was thereafter to be bestowed upon them. Those applauses which they were never to hear rung in their ears. The thoughts of that admiration, whose effects they were never to feel, played about their hearts, banished from their breasts the strongest of all natu∣ral fears, and transported them to perform actions which seem almost beyond the reach of human nature. But in point of reality there is surely no great difference between that approbation which is not to be be∣stowed till we can no longer enjoy it, and that which indeed is never to be bestowed, but which would be bestowed if the world was ever made to understand properly the real circumstances of our behaviour. If the one often produces such violent effects, we cannot wonder that the other should always be highly regarded.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the man who has broke thro' all those measures of conduct, which can alone render him agreeable to man∣kind, tho' he should have the most perfect assurance that what he had done was for∣ever to be concealed from every human eye,
<PB N="251" REF="264"/>
it is all to no purpose. When he looks back upon it, and views it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it, he finds that he can enter into none of the motives which influenced it. He is abashed and confounded at the thoughts of it, and ne∣cessarily feels a very high degree of that shame which he would be exposed to, if his actions should ever come to be generally known. His imagination, in this case too, anticipates the contempt and derision from which nothing saves him but the ignorance of those he lives with. He still feels that he is the natural object of these sentiments, and still trembles at the thought of what he would suffer if they were ever actually exerted against him. But if what he had been guilty of was not meerly one of those improprieties which are the objects of sim∣ple disapprobation, but one of those enor∣mous crimes which excite detestation and resentment, he could never think of it, as long as he had any sensibility left, without feeling all the agony of horror and remorse; and tho' he could be assured that no man was ever to know it, and could even bring himself to believe that there was no God to
<PB N="252" REF="265"/>
revenge it, he would still feel enough of both these sentiments to embitter the whole of his life: He would still regard himself as the natural object of the hatred and indig∣nation of all his fellow-creatures; and if his heart was not grown callous by the ha∣bit of crimes, he could not think without terror and astonishment even of the man∣ner, in which mankind would look upon him, of what would be the expression of their countenance and of their eyes, if the dreadful truth should ever come to be known. These natural pangs of an afrighted conscience are the daemons, the avenging fu∣ries which in this life haunt the guilty, which allow them neither quiet nor repose, which often drive them to despair and distraction, from which no assurance of secrecy can protect them, from which no principles of irreligion can entirely deliver them, and from which nothing can free them but the vilest and most abject of all states, a com∣pleat insensibility to honour and infamy, to vice and virtue. Men of the most detest∣able characters, who, in the execution of the most dreadful crimes, had taken their measures so coolly as to avoid even the sus∣picion of guilt, have sometimes been driven
<PB N="253" REF="266"/>
by the horror of their situation, to discover of their own accord, what no human saga∣city could ever have investigated. By ac∣knowledging their guilt, by submitting themselves to the resentment of their of∣fended citizens, and by thus satiating that vengeance of which they were sensible that they were become the proper objects, they hoped by their death to reconcile themselves, at least in their own imagination, to the natural sentiments of mankind, to be able to consider themselves as less worthy of hatred and resentment, to attone in some measure for their crimes, and, if possible, to die in peace and with the forgiveness of all their fellow-creatures. Compared to what they felt before the discovery, even the thought of this, it seems, was happi∣ness.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. In what manner our own judgments re∣fer to what ought to be the judgments of others: And of the origin of general rules.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part, perhaps the greatest part of human happiness and misery arises from the view of our past conduct, and from the degree of approbation or dis∣approbation
<PB N="254" REF="267"/>
which we feel from the conside∣ration of it. But in whatever manner it may affect us, our sentiments of this kind have always some secret reference either to what are, or to what upon a certain condition would be, or to what we imagine ought to be the sentiments of others. We examine it as we imagine an impartial spectator would examine it. If upon placing ourselves in his situation we thoroughly enter into all the passions and motives which influenced it, we approve of it by sympathy with the ap∣probation of this supposed equitable judge. If otherwise, we enter into his disapproba∣tion and condemn it.</P>
<P>Was it possible that a human creature could grow up to manhood in some solitary place without any communication with his own species, he could no more think of his own character, of the propriety or demerit of his own sentiments and conduct, of the beauty or deformity of his own mind, than of the beauty or deformity of his own face. All these are objects which he cannot easily see, which naturally he does not look at, and upon which he is provided with no mirror to enable him to turn his eyes. Bring him into society, and he is imme∣diately
<PB N="255" REF="268"/>
provided with the mirror which he wanted before. It is placed in the coun∣tenance and behaviour of those he lives with, which always mark when they enter into, and when they disapprove of his senti∣ments; and it is here that he first views the propriety and impropriety of his own pas∣sions, the beauty and deformity of his own mind. To a man who from his birth was a stranger to society, the objects of his passions, the external bodies which either pleased or hurt him, would occupy his whole attention. The passions themselves, the desires or aversions, the joys or sorrows which those objects excited, tho' of all things the most immediately present to him, could scarce ever be the objects of his thoughts. The idea of them could never in∣terest him so much as to call upon his atten∣tive consideration. The consideration of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy could in him excite no new joy, nor that of his sorrow any new sorrow, tho' the con∣sideration of the causes of those passions might often excite both. Bring him into society, and all his own passions will im∣mediately become the causes of new pas∣sions. He will observe that mankind ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rove of some of them and are disgusted
<PB N="256" REF="269"/>
by others. He will be elevated in the one case, and cast down in the other; his de∣sires and aversions, his joys and sorrows will now often become the causes of new desires and new aversions, new joys and new sorrows: they will now therefore in∣terest him deeply, and often call upon his most attentive consideration.</P>
<P>To be amiable and to be meritorious, that is, to deserve love and to deserve re∣ward, are the great characters of virtue, and the contrary of vice. But both these cha∣racters have an immediate reference to the sentiments of others. Virtue is not said to be amiable or to be meritorious, because it is the object of its own love or of its own gratitude, but because it excites those sentiments in other men. The conscious∣ness that it is the object of such favourable regards is the source of that inward tran∣quillity and self-satisfaction with which it is naturally attended, as the suspicion of the contrary gives occasion to the torments of vice. What so great happiness, as to be beloved, and to know that we deserve to be beloved? What so great misery, as to be hated, and to know that we deserve to be hated?</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="270"/>To judge or ourselves as we judge of others, to approve and condemn in our∣selves what we approve and condemn in others, is the greatest exertion of candour and impartiality. In order to do this, we must look at ourselves with the same eyes with which we look at others: we must imagine ourselves not the actors, but the spectators of our own character and con∣duct, and consider how these would affect us when viewed from this new station, in which their excellencies and imperfections can alone be discovered. We must enter, in short, either into what are, or into what ought to be, or into what, if the whole circumstances of our conduct were known, we imagine would be the sentiments of others, before we can either applaud or condemn it.</P>
<P>A moral being is an accountable being. An accountable being, as the word ex∣presses, is a being that must give an ac∣count of its actions to some other, and that consequently must regulate them ac∣cording to the good-liking of this other. Man is accountable to God and his fellow creatures. But tho' he is, no doubt, prin∣cipally accountable to God, in the order of
<PB N="258" REF="271"/>
time, he must necessarily conceive himself as accountable to his fellow creatures, be∣fore he can form any idea of the Deity, or of the rules by which that Divine Be∣ing will judge of his conduct. A child surely conceives itself as accountable to its parents, and is elevated or cast down by the thought of their merited approbation or disapprobation, long before it forms any idea of its accountableness to the Dei∣ty, or of the rules by which that Divine Being will judge of its conduct.</P>
<P>Our first ideas of personal beauty and deformity, are drawn from the shape and appearance of others, not from our own. We soon become sensible however, that others exercise the same criticism upon us. We are pleased when they approve of our figure, and are disobliged when they seem to be disgusted. We become anxious to know how far our appearance deserves ei∣ther their blame or approbation. We exa∣mine our own persons limb by limb, and by placing ourselves before a looking-glass▪ or by some such expedient, endeavour, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much as possible, to view ourselves at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distance and with the eyes of other people▪ If after this examination we are satisfie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="259" REF="272"/>
with our own appearance, we can more easily support the most disadvantageous judgments of others: if, on the contrary, we are sensible that we are the natural ob∣jects of distaste, every appearance of their disapprobation mortifies us beyond all mea∣sure. A man who is tolerably handsome, will allow you to laugh at any little irregu∣larity in his person; but all such jokes are commonly insupportable to one who is real∣ly deformed. It is evident, however, that we are anxious about our own beauty and deformity, only upon account of its effect upon others. If we had no connection with society, we should be altogether in∣different about either.</P>
<P>In the same manner our first moral cri∣ticisms are exercised upon the characters and conduct of other people; and we are all very forward to observe how each of these affects us. But we soon learn, that others are equally frank with regard to our own. We become anxious to know how far we deserve their censure or applause, and whether to them we must necessarily appear those agreeable or disagreeable creatures which they represent us. We begin upon this account to examine our
<PB N="260" REF="273"/>
own passions and conduct, and to consider how these must appear to them, by consi∣dering how they would appear to us if in their situation. We suppose ourselves the spectators of our own behaviour, and en∣deavour to imagine what effect it would, in this light, produce upon us. This is the only looking-glass by which we can, in some measure, with the eyes of others, scrutinize the propriety of our own con∣duct. If in this view it pleases us, we are tolerably satisfied. We can be more in∣different about the applause, and, in some measure, despise the censure of others; secure that however misunderstood or mis∣represented, we are the natural and proper objects of approbation. On the contrary, if we are displeased with it, we are often upon that very account more anxious to gain their approbation, and, provided we have not already, as they say, shaken hands with infamy, we are altogether distracted at the thoughts of their censure, which then strikes us with double severity.</P>
<P>Unfortunately this moral looking-glass is not always a very good one. Common looking-glasses, it is said, are extremely
<PB N="261" REF="274"/>
deceitful, and by the glare which they throw over the face, conceal from the par∣tial eyes of the person many deformities which are obvious to every body besides. But there is not in the world such a smooth∣er of wrinkles as is every man's imagina∣tion, with regard to the blemishes of his own character.</P>
<P>There are two different occasions when we examine our own conduct, and endea∣vour to view it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it; first, when we are about to act, and secondly, after we have acted. Our views are very partial in both cases, but they are most so, when it is of most importance that they should be otherwise.</P>
<P>When we are about to act, the eagerness of passion will seldom allow us to consider what we are doing with the candour of an indifferent person. The violent emotions which at that time agitate us, discolour our views of things, even when we are en∣deavouring to place ourselves in the situa∣tion of another, and to regard the objects that interest us, in the light which they will naturally appear to him. The fury of our own passions constantly calls us back
<PB N="262" REF="275"/>
to our own place, where every thing ap∣pears magnified and misrepresented by self-love. Of the manner in which those ob∣jects would appear to another, of the view which he would take of them we can ob∣tain, if I may say so, but instantaneous glimpses, which vanish in a moment, and which even while they last are not altoge∣ther just. We cannot even for that mo∣ment divest ourselves entirely of the heat and keenness with which our peculiar si∣tuation inspires us, nor consider what we are about to do with the compleat impar∣tiality of an equitable judge. The pas∣sions, upon this account, as father Male-branch says, all justify themselves, and seem reasonable, and proportioned to their objects, as long as we continue to feel them.</P>
<P>When the action is over, indeed, and the passions which prompted it have sub∣sided, we can enter more coolly into the sentiments of the indifferent spectator. What before interested us, is now become almost as indifferent to us as it always was to him, and we can now examine our own conduct with his candour and impartiality. But our judgments now are of little im∣portance,
<PB N="263" REF="276"/>
compared to what they were be∣fore; and when they are most severely im∣partial, can commonly produce nothing but vain regret, and unavailing repent∣ance, without securing us from the like er∣rors for the future. It is seldom, however, that they are quite candid even in this case. The opinion which we entertain of our own character, depends entirely on our judgment concerning our past conduct. It is so disagreeable to think ill of our∣selves, that we often purposely turn away our view from those circumstances which might render that judgment unfavourable. He is a bold surgeon, they say, whose hand does not tremble when he performs an operation upon his own person; and he is often equally bold who does not hesitate to pull off the mysterious veil of self-delu∣sion, which covers from his view the de∣formities of his own conduct. Rather than see our own behaviour under so disa∣greeable an aspect, we too often, foolishly and weakly, endeavour to exasperate anew those unjust passions which had formerly misled us; we endeavour by artifice to awaken our old hatreds, and irritate afresh our almost forgotten resentments: we even
<PB N="264" REF="277"/>
exert ourselves for this miserable purpose and thus persevere in injustice, merely be∣cause we once were unjust, and because we are ashamed and afraid to see that we were so.</P>
<P>So partial are the views of mankind with regard to the propriety of their own con∣duct, both at the time of action and after it; and so difficult is it for them to view it in the light in which any indifferent spec∣tator would consider it. But if it was by a peculiar faculty, such as the moral sense is supposed to be, that they judged of their own conduct, if they were endued with a par∣ticular power of perception, which distin∣guished the beauty or deformity of passi∣ons and affections; as their own passions would be more immediately exposed to the view of this faculty, it would judge with more accuracy concerning them, than con∣cerning those of other men, of which it had only a more distant prospect.</P>
<P>This self-deceit, this fatal weakness of mankind, is the source of half the disor∣ders of human life. If we saw ourselves in the light in which others see us, or in which they would see us if they knew all,
<PB N="265" REF="278"/>
a reformation would generally be unavoid∣able. We could not otherwise endure the sight.</P>
<P>Nature, however, has not left this weak∣ness, which is of so much importance, al∣together without a remedy; nor has she abandoned us entirely to the delusions of self-love. Our continual observations up∣on the conduct of others, insensibly lead us to form to ourselves certain general rules concerning what is fit and proper either to be done or to be avoided. Some of their ac∣tions shock all our natural sentiments. We hear every body about us express the like detestation against them. This still further confirms, and even exasperates our natural sense of their deformity. It satis∣fies us that we view them in the proper light, when we see other people view them in the same light. We resolve never to be guilty of the like, nor ever, upon any account, to render ourselves in this manner the objects of universal disapprobation. We thus naturally lay down to ourselves a general rule, that all such actions are to be avoided, as tending to render us odious, contemptible, or punishable, the objects of all those sentiments for which we have
<PB N="266" REF="279"/>
the greatest dread and aversion. Other actions, on the contrary, call forth our approbation, and we hear every body a∣round us express the same favourable opi∣nion concerning them. Every body is ea∣ger to honour and reward them. They excite all those sentiments for which we have by nature the strongest desire; the love, the gratitude, the admiration of man∣kind. We become ambitious of perform∣ing the like; and thus naturally lay down to ourselves a rule of another kind, that every opportunity of acting in this manner is carefully to be sought after.</P>
<P>It is thus that the general rules of mo∣rality are formed. They are ultimately founded upon experience of what, in par∣ticular instances, our moral faculties, our natural sense of merit and propriety, ap∣prove, or disapprove of. We do not ori∣ginally approve or condemn particular ac∣tions; because, upon examination, they appear to be agreeable or inconsistent with a certain general rule. The general rule, on the contrary, is formed by finding from experience, that all actions of a certain kind, or circumstanced in a certain man∣ner, are approved or disapproved of. To
<PB N="267" REF="280"/>
the man who first saw an inhuman mur∣der, committed from avarice, envy, or un∣just resentment, and upon one too that loved and trusted the murderer, who be∣held the last agonies of the dying person, who heard him, with his expiring breath, complain more of the perfidy and ingra∣titude of his false friend, than of the vio∣lence which had been done to him, there could be no occasion, in order to conceive how horrible such an action was, that he should reflect, that one of the most sacred rules of conduct was what prohibited the taking away the life of an innocent per∣son, that this was a plain violation of that rule, and consequently a very blameable action. His detestation of this crime, it is evident, would arise instantaneously and antecedent to his having formed to himself any such general rule. The general rule, on the contrary, which he might afterwards form, would be founded upon the detesta∣tion which he felt necessarily arise in his own breast, at the thought of this, and every other particular action of the same kind.</P>
<P>When we read in history or romance, the account of actions either of generosity
<PB N="268" REF="281"/>
or of baseness, the admiration which we con∣ceive for the one, and the contempt which we feel for the other, neither of them arise from reflecting that there are certain gene∣ral rules which declare all actions of the one kind admirable, and all actions of the other contemptible. Those general rules, on the contrary, are all formed from the experience we have had of the effects which actions of all different kinds naturally pro∣duce upon us.</P>
<P>An amiable action, a respectable action, an horrid action, are all of them actions which naturally excite the love, the respect, or the horror of the spectator, for the per∣son who performs them. The general rules which determine what actions are, and what are not, the objects of each of those sentiments, can be formed no other way than by observing what actions actu∣ally and in fact excite them.</P>
<P>When these general rules, indeed, have been formed, when they are universally acknowleged and established, by the con∣curring sentiments of mankind, we fre∣quently appeal to them as to the standards of judgment, in debating concerning the de∣gree
<PB N="269" REF="282"/>
of praise or blame that is due to cer∣tain actions of a complicated and dubious nature. They are upon these occasions commonly cited as the ultimate foundations of what is just and unjust in human con∣duct; and this circumstance seems to have misled several very eminent authors, to draw up their systems in such a manner, as if they had supposed that the original judgments of mankind with regard to right and wrong, were formed like the decisions of a court of judicatory, by considering first the general rule, and then, secondly, whether the particular action under consi∣deration fell properly within its compre∣hension.</P>
<P>Those general rules of conduct, when they have been fixed in our mind by habi∣tual reflection, are of great use in correct∣ing the misrepresentations of self-love con∣cerning what is fit and proper to be done in our particular situation. The man of furious resentment, if he was to listen to the dictates of that passion, would perhaps re∣gard the death of his enemy, as but a small compensation for the wrong, he imagines, he has received; which, however, may be no more than a very slight provocation.
<PB N="270" REF="283"/>
But his observations upon the conduct of others, have taught him how horrible all such sanguinary revenges appear. Unless his education has been very singular, he has laid it down to himself as an inviolable rule, to abstain from them upon all occa∣sions. This rule preserves its authority with him, and renders him incapable of being guilty of such a violence. Yet the fury of his own temper may be such, that had this been the first time in which he considered such an action, he would un∣doubtedly have determined it to be quite just and proper, and what every impartial spectator would approve of. But that re∣verence for the rule which past experience has impressed upon him, checks the impe∣tuosity of his passion, and helps him to correct the too partial views which self-love might otherwise suggest, of what was proper to be done in his situation. If he should allow himself to be so far trans∣ported by passion as to violate this rule yet even in this case, he cannot throw of altogether the awe and respect with which he has been accustomed to regard it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the very time of acting, at the moment i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which passion mounts the highest, he hesi∣tates
<PB N="271" REF="284"/>
and trembles at the thought of what he is about to do: he is secretly conscious to himself, that he is breaking thro' those measures of conduct which, in all his cool hours, he had resolved never to infringe, which he had never seen infringed by others without the highest disapprobation, and of which the infringement, his own mind for∣bodes, must soon render him the object of the same disagreeable sentiments. Before he can take the last fatal resolution, he is tormented with all the agonies of doubt and uncertainty; he is terrified at the thought of violating so sacred a rule, and at the same time is urged and goaded on by the fury of his desires to violate it. He changes his purpose every moment; some∣times he resolves to adhere to his principle, and not indulge a passion which may cor∣rupt the remaining part of his life with the horrors of shame and repentance; and a momentary calm takes possession of his breast, from the prospect of that security and tranquillity which he will enjoy when he thus determines not to expose himself to the hazard of a contrary conduct. But immediately the passion rouses anew, and with fresh fury drives him on to commit
<PB N="272" REF="285"/>
what he had the instant before resolved to abstain from. Wearied and distracted with those continual irresolutions, he at length, from a sort of despair, makes the last fatal and irrecoverable step; but with that terror and amazement with which one flying from an enemy, throws himself over a precipice, where he is sure of meet∣ing with more certain destruction than from any thing that pursues him from behind. Such are his sentiments even at the time of acting; tho' he is then, no doubt, less sen∣sible of the impropriety of his own con∣duct than afterwards, when his passion being gratified and palled, he begins to view what he has done in the light in which others are apt to view it; and actually feels, what he had only foreseen very imper∣fectly before, the stings of remorse and repentance begin to agitate and torment him.</P>

If he has
<PB N="274" REF="287"/>
been virtuously educated, however, he will often have been made to observe how odi∣ous those actions appear which denote a want of this sentiment, and how amiable the contrary. Tho' his heart therefore is not warmed with any grateful affection, he will strive to act as if it was, and will endeavour to pay all those regards and at∣tentions to his patron which the liveliest gratitude could suggest. He will visit him regularly; he will behave to him respect∣fully; he will never talk of him but with expressions of the highest esteem, and of the many obligations which he owes to him. And what is more, he will chearfully em∣brace every opportunity of making a pro∣per return for past services. He may do all this too without any hypocrisy or blame∣able dissimulation, without any selfish in∣tention of obtaining new favours, and without any design of imposing either up∣on his benefactor or the public.

her husband which is suitable to the rela∣tion that subsists between them. If she has been virtuously educated, however, she will endeavour to act as if she felt it, to be careful, officious, faithful▪ and sincere, and to be deficient in none of those attentions which the sentiment of conjugal affection could have prompted her to perform. Such a friend, and such a wife, are neither of them, undoubtedly, the very best of their kinds; and tho' both of them may have the most serious and earnest desire to fulfil every part of their duty, yet they will fail <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n many nice and delicate regards, they will miss many opportunities of obliging, which they could never have overlooked if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey had possessed the sentiment that is pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er to their situation. Tho' not the very first of their kinds, however, they are per∣haps the second; and if the regard to the general rules of conduct has been very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trongly impressed upon them, neither of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem will fail in any very essential part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir duty.

<PB N="276" REF="289"/>
most delicate and accurate propriety. The coarse clay of which the bulk of mankind are formed, cannot be wrought up to such perfection. There is scarce any man, how∣ever, who by discipline, education, and example, may not be so impressed with a regard to general rules, as to act upon al∣most every occasion with tolerable decency, and thro' the whole of his life avoid any considerable degree of blame.</P>
<P>Without this sacred regard to general rules, there is no man whose conduct can be much depended upon. It is this which constitutes the most essential difference be∣tween a man of principle and honour and a worthless fellow. The one adheres, up∣on all occasions, steadily and resolutely to his maxims, and preserves thro' the whole of his life one even tenor of conduct. The other, acts variously and accidentally, as humour, inclination, or interest chance to be uppermost. Nay, such are the ine∣qualities of humour to which all men ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subject, that without this principle, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man who, in all his cool hours, had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most delicate sensibility to the propriety o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conduct, might often be led to act ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surdly
<PB N="277" REF="290"/>
upon the most frivolous occasions, and when it was scarce possible to assign any serious motive for his behaving in this manner. Your friend makes you a visit when you happen to be in a humour which makes it disagreeable to receive him: in your present mood his civility is very apt to appear an impertinent intrusion; and if you was to give way to the views of things which at this time occur, tho' civil in your temper, you would behave to him with coldness and contempt. What ren∣ders you incapable of such a rudeness, is nothing but a regard to the general rules of civility and hospitality, which prohibit it. That habitual reverence which your former experience has taught you for these, enables you to act, upon all such occasions, with nearly equal propriety, and hinders those inequalities of temper, to which all men are subject, from influencing your conduct in any very sensible degree. But if without regard to these general rules, even the duties of politeness, which are so easily observed, and which one can scarce have any serious motive to violate, would yet be so frequently violated, what would become of the duties of justice, of truth,
<PB N="278" REF="291"/>
of chastity, of fidelity, which it is often so difficult to observe, and which there may be so many strong motives to violate? But upon the tolerable observance of these duties, depends the very existence of hu∣man society, which would crumble into nothing if mankind were not generally im∣pressed with a reverence for those impor∣tant rules of conduct.</P>
<P>This reverence is still further enhanced by an opinion which is first impressed by nature, and afterwards confirmed by rea∣soning and philosophy, that those impor∣tant rules of morality, are the commands and laws of the Deity, who will finally re∣ward the obedient, and punish the trans∣gressors of their duty.</P>
<P>This opinion or apprehension, I say, seems first to be impressed by nature. Men are naturally led to ascribe to those myste∣rious beings, whatever they are, which happen in any country, to be the object of religious fear, all their own sentiments and passions. They have no other, they can conceive no other to ascribe to them. Those unknown intelligences which they imagine but see not, must necessarily be formed with some sort of resemblance to
<PB N="279" REF="292"/>
those intelligences of which they have ex∣perience. During the ignorance and dark∣ness of pagan superstition, mankind seem to have formed the ideas of their divinities with so little delicacy, that they ascribed to them, indiscriminately, all the passi∣ons of human nature, those not excepted which do the least honour to our species, such as lust, hunger, avarice, envy, re∣venge. They could not fail, therefore, to ascribe to those beings, for the excellence of whose nature they still conceived the highest admiration, those sentiments and qualities which are the great ornaments of humanity, and which seem to raise it to a resemblance to divine perfection, the love of virtue and beneficence, and the abhor∣rence of vice and injustice. The man who was injured, called upon Jupiter to be wit∣ness of the wrong that was done to him, and could not doubt, but that divine be∣ing would behold it with the same indig∣nation which would animate the meanest of mankind, who looked on when injus∣tice was committed. The man who did the injury, felt himself to be the proper object of the detestation and resentment of mankind; and his natural fears led
<PB N="280" REF="293"/>
him to impute the same sentiments to those awful beings, whose presence he could not avoid, and whose power he could not re∣sist. These natural hopes and fears, and suspicions, were propagated by sympathy, and confirmed by education; and the Gods were universally represented and believed to be the rewarders of humanity and mer∣cy, and the avengers of perfidy and in∣justice. And thus religion, even in its rudest form, gave a sanction to the rules of morality, long before the age of artifi∣cial reasoning and philosophy. That the terrors of religion should thus enforce the natural sense of duty, was of too much importance to the happiness of mankind, for nature to leave it dependent upon the slowness and uncertainty of philosophical researches.</P>
<P>These researches, however, when they came to take place, confirmed those ori∣ginal anticipations of nature. Upon what∣ever we suppose that our moral faculties are founded, whether upon a certain mo∣dification of reason, upon an original in∣stinct, called a moral sense, or upon some other principle of our nature, it cannot
<PB N="281" REF="294"/>
be doubted, that they were given us for the direction of our conduct in this life. They carry along with them the most evident badges of this authority, which denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions, to su∣perintend all our senses, passions, and ap∣petites, and to judge how far each of them was either to be indulged or restrained. Our moral faculties are by no means, as some have pretended, upon a level in this respect with the other faculties and appe∣tites of our nature, endowed with no more right to restrain these last, than these last are to restrain them. No other faculty or principle of action judges of any other. Love does not judge of resentment, nor resentment of love. Those two passions may be opposite to one another, but can∣not, with any propriety, be said to approve or disapprove of one another. But it is the peculiar office of those faculties now under our consideration to judge, to be∣stow censure or applause upon all the other principles of our nature. They may be considered as a sort of senses of which those principles are the objects. Every sense is supreme over its own objects.
<PB N="282" REF="295"/>
There is no appeal from the eye with re∣gard to the beauty of colours, nor from the ear with regard to the harmony of sounds, nor from the taste with regard to the agreeableness of flavours. Each of those senses judges in the last resort of its own objects. Whatever gratifies the taste is sweet, whatever pleases the eye is beau∣tiful, whatever sooths the ear is harmoni∣ous. The very essence of each of those qualities consists in its being fitted to please the sense to which it is addressed. It be∣longs to our moral faculties, in the same manner to determine when the ear ought to be soothed, when the eye ought to be indulged, when the taste ought to be gra∣tified, when and how far every other prin∣ciple of our nature ought either to be in∣dulged or restrained. What is agreeable to our moral faculties, is fit and right, and proper to be done; the contrary, wrong, unfit and improper. The sentiments which they approve of, are graceful and becom∣ing: the contrary, ungraceful and unbe∣coming. The very words right, wrong, fit, improper, graceful, unbecoming, mean only what pleases or displeases those fa∣culties.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="296"/>Since these, therefore, were plainly in∣tended to be the governing principles of human nature, the rules which they pre∣scribe, are to be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity, promulgated by those vicegerents which he has thus set up within us. All general rules are common∣ly denominated laws: thus the general rules which bodies observe in the commu∣nication of motion, are called the laws of motion. But those general rules which our moral faculties observe in approving or condemning whatever sentiment or ac∣tion is subjected to their examination, may much more justly be denominated such. They have a much greater resemblance to what are properly called laws, those gene∣ral rules which the sovereign lays down to direct the conduct of his subjects. Like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem they are rules to direct the free ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of men; they are prescribed most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urely by a lawful superior, and are at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended too with the sanction of rewards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd punishments. Those vicegerents of God within us, never fail to punish the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iolation of them, by the torments of in∣ward shame, and self-condemnation; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the contrary always reward obedience
<PB N="284" REF="297"/>
with tranquility of mind, with content∣ment, and self-satisfaction.</P>
<P>There are innumerable other considera∣tions which serve to confirm the same con∣clusion. The happiness of mankind, as well as of all other rational creatures, seems to have been the original purpose intended by the Author of Nature, when he brought them into existence. No other end seems worthy of that supreme wisdom and di∣vine benignity which we necessarily ascribe to him; and this opinion, which we are led to by the abstract consideration of his infinite perfections, is still more confirmed by the examination of the works of na∣ture, which seem all intended to promote happiness, and to guard against misery. But by acting according to the dictates of our moral faculties, we necessarily pursue the most effectual means for promoting the happiness of mankind, and may therefore be said, in some sense, to co-operate with the Deity, and to advance as far as in our power the plan of Providence. By acting otherways, on the contrary, we seem to obstruct, in some measure, the scheme which the Author of Nature has establish∣ed for the happiness and perfection of the
<PB N="285" REF="298"/>
world, and to declare ourselves, if I may say so, in some measure the enemies of God. Hence we are naturally encouraged to hope for his extraordinary favour and reward in the one case, and to dread his vengeance and punishment in the other.</P>
<P>There are besides many other reasons, and many other natural principles, which all tend to confirm and inculcate the same salutary doctrine. If we consider the ge∣neral rules by which external prosperity and adversity are commonly distributed in this life, we shall find, that notwithstand∣ing the disorder in which all things appear to be in this world, yet even here every virtue naturally meets with its proper re∣ward, with the recompense which is most fit to encourage and promote it; and this too so surely, that it requires a very extra∣ordinary concurrence of circumstances en∣tirely to disappoint it. What is the reward most proper for encouraging industry, pru∣dence, and circumspection? Success in every sort of business. And is it possible that in the whole of life these virtues should fail of attaining it? Wealth and external honours are their proper recompence, and
<PB N="286" REF="299"/>
the recompence which they can seldom fail of acquiring. What reward is most pro∣per for promoting the practice of truth, justice, and humanity? The confidence, the esteem, and love of those we live with. Humanity does not desire to be great, but to be beloved. It is not in being rich that truth and justice would rejoice, but in be∣ing trusted and believed, recompences which those virtues must almost always acquire. By some very extraordinary and unlucky circumstance, a good man may come to be suspected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable, and upon that account be most unjustly exposed for the remaining part of his life to the horror and aversion of mankind. By an accident of this kind he may be said to lose his all, notwithstanding his integrity and justice; in the same manner as a cautious man, notwithstanding his utmost circumspection, may be ruined by an earthquake or an in∣undation. Accidents of the first kind, however, are perhaps still more rare, and still more contrary to the common course of things than those of the second; and it still remains true, that the practice of truth, justice, and humanity, is a certain
<PB N="287" REF="300"/>
and almost infallible method of acquiring what those virtues chiefly aim at, the con∣fidence and love of those we live with. A person may be very easily misrepresented with regard to a particular action; but it is scarce possible that he should be so with regard to the general tenor of his conduct. An innocent man may be believed to have done wrong: this, however, will rarely happen. On the contrary, the established opinion of the innocence of his manners, will often lead us to absolve him where he has really been in the fault, notwithstand∣ing very strong presumptions. A knave, in the same manner may escape censure, or even meet with applause, for a particular knave∣ry, in which his conduct is not under∣stood. But no man was ever habitually such, without being almost universally known to be so, and without being even frequently suspected of guilt, when he was in reality perfectly innocent. And so far as vice and virtue can be either punished or rewarded by the sentiments and opinions of mankind, they both, according to the common course of things, meet even here with something more than exact and im∣partial justice.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="301"/>But tho' the general rules by which pros∣perity and adversity are commonly distri∣buted, when considered in this cool and philosophical light, appear to be perfectly suited to the situation of mankind in this life, yet they are by no means suited to some of our natural sentiments. Our na∣tural love and admiration for some virtues is such, that we should wish to bestow on them all sorts of honours and rewards, even those which we must acknowledge to be the proper recompences of other quali∣ties with which those virtues are not al∣ways accompanied. Our detestation, on the contrary, for some vices is such, that we should desire to heap upon them every sort of disgrace and disaster, those not ex∣cepted which are the natural consequences of very different qualities. Magnanimity, generosity, and justice command so high a degree of admiration, that we desire to see them crowned with wealth, and power, and honours of every kind, the natural consequences of prudence, industry, and application; qualities with which those virtues are not inseparably connected. Fraud, falsehood, brutality, and violence,
<PB N="289" REF="302"/>
on the other hand, excite in every human breast such scorn and abhorrence, that our indignation rouzes to see them possess those advantages which they may in some sense be said to have merited, by the diligence and industry with which they are some∣times attended. The industrious knave cultivates the soil; the indolent good man leaves it uncultivated. Who ought to reap the harvest? who starve, and who live in plenty? The natural course of things de∣cides it in favour of the knave: the natu∣ral sentiments of mankind in favour of the man of virtue. Man judges, that the good qualities of the one are greatly over-re∣compensed by those advantages which they tend to procure him, and that the omissions of the other are by far too severely punish∣ed by the distress which they naturally bring upon him; and human laws, the consequences of human sentiments, for∣feit the life and the estate of the industri∣ous and cautious traitour, and reward, by extraordinary recompenses, the fidelity and public spirit of the improvident and care∣less good citizen. Thus man is by nature directed to correct, in some measure, that distribution of things which she herself
<PB N="290" REF="303"/>
would otherwise have made. The rules which for this purpose she prompts him to follow, are different from those which she herself observes. She bestows upon every virtue, and upon every vice, that precise reward or punishment which is best fitted to encourage the one, or to restrain the other. She is directed by this sole consi∣deration, and pays little regard to the dif∣ferent degrees of merit and demerit, which they may seem to possess in the sentiments and passions of man. Man, on the con∣trary, pays regard to this only, and would endeavour to render the state of every vir∣tue precisely proportioned to that degree of love and esteem, and of every vice to that degree of contempt and abhorrence which he himself conceives for it. The rules which she follows are fit for her, those which he follows for him: but both are calculated to promote the same great end, the order of the world, and the perfection and happiness of human nature.</P>
<P>But tho' man is thus employed to alter that distribution of things which natural events would make, if left to themselves; tho', like the Gods of the poets, he is per∣petually interposing, by extraordinary
<PB N="291" REF="304" MS="y"/>
means, in favour of virtue, and in oppo∣sition to vice, and like them, endeavours to turn away the arrow that is aimed at the head of the righteous, but accelerates the sword of destruction that is lifted up against the wicked; yet he is by no means able to render the fortune of either quite suitable to his own sentiments and wishes. The natural course of things cannot be entirely controuled by the impotent endea∣vours of man: the current is too rapid and too strong for him to stop it; and tho' the rules which direct it appear to have been established for the wisest and best purposes, they sometimes produce ef∣fects which shock all his natural senti∣ments. That a great combination of men, should prevail over a small one; that those who engage in an enterprize with fore∣thought and all necessary preparation, should prevail over such as oppose them without any; and that every end should be acquired by those means only which na∣ture has established for acquiring it, seems to be a rule not only necessary and una∣voidable in itself, but even useful and pro∣per for rouzing the industry and attention of mankind. Yet, when in consequence
<PB N="292" REF="305"/>
of this rule, violence and artifice prevail over sincerity and justice, What indig∣nation does it not excite in the breast of every human spectator? What sorrow and compassion for the sufferings of the innocent, and what furious resentment against the success of the oppressor? We are equally grieved and enraged, at the wrong that is done, but often find it al∣together out of our power to redress it▪ When we thus despair of finding any force upon earth which can check the triumph of injustice, we naturally appeal to hea∣ven, and hope, that the great author of our nature will himself execute hereafter, what all the principles which he has given us, for the direction of our conduct, prompt us to attempt even here; that he will compleat the plan which he himself has thus taught us to begin; and will, in a life to come, render to every one accord∣ing to the works which he has performed in this world. And thus we are led to the belief of a future state, not only by the weaknesses, by the hopes and fears of hu∣man nature, but by the noblest and best principles which belong to it, by the love
<PB N="293" REF="306"/>
of virtue, and by the abhorrence of vice and injustice.</P>
<P>"Does it suit the greatness of God," says the eloquent and philosophical bishop of Clermont, with that passionate and ex∣aggerating force of imagination, which seems sometimes to exceed the bounds of decorum;
<Q>does it suit the greatness of God, to leave the world which he has created in so universal a disorder? To see the wicked prevail almost always over the just; the innocent dethroned by the usurper; the father become the victim of the ambition of an unnatural son; the husband expiring under the stroak of a barbarous and faithless wife? From the height of his greatness ought God to behold those melancholy events as a fantastical amusement, without taking any share in them? Because he is great, should he be weak, or unjust, or barbarous? Because men are little, ought they to be allowed either to be dissolute without punishment, or vir∣tuous without reward? O God! if this is the character of your Supreme Being; if it is you whom we adore un∣der such dreadful ideas; can I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="294" REF="307"/>
longer acknowledge you for my father, for my protector, for the comforter of my sorrow, the support of my weak∣ness, the rewarder of my fidelity? You would then be no more but an indolent and fantastical tyrant, who sacrifices mankind to his insolent vanity, and who has brought them out of nothing, only to make them serve for the sport of his leisure, and of his caprice.</Q></P>
<P>When the general rules which deter∣mine the merit and demerit of actions, come thus to be regarded, as the laws of an All-powerful Being, who watches over our conduct, and who, in a life to come, will reward the observance, and punish the breach of them; they necessarily ac∣quire a new sacredness from this consi∣deration. That our regard to the will of the Deity, ought to be the supreme rule of our conduct, can be doubted of by no body who believes his existence. The very thought of disobedience appears to involve in it the most shocking impro∣priety. How vain, how absurd would it be for man, either to oppose or to neglect the commands that were laid upon him
<PB N="295" REF="308"/>
by Infinite Wisdom, and Infinite Power! How unnatural, how impiously ungrate∣ful not to reverence the precepts that were prescribed to him by the infinite goodness of his Creator, even tho' no punishment was to follow their violation. The sense of propriety too is here well supported by the strongest motives of self-interest. The idea that, however, we may escape the observation of man, or be placed above the reach of human punishment, yet we are always acting under the eye, and ex∣posed to the punishment of God, the great avenger of injustice, is a motive capable of restraining the most headstrong passions, with those at least who, by constant re∣flection, have rendered it familiar to them.</P>
<P>It is in this manner that religion en∣forces the natural sense of duty: and hence it is, that mankind are generally disposed to place great confidence in the probity of those who seem deeply impress∣ed with religious sentiments. Such persons, they imagine, act under an additional tye, besides those which regulate the conduct of other men. The regard to the propriety of action as well as to reputation, the
<PB N="296" REF="309"/>
regard to the applause of his own breast, as well as to that of others, are motives which they suppose have the same influ∣ence over the religious man, as over the man of the world. But the former lies under another restraint, and never acts deliberately but as in the presence of that Great Superior who is finally to recom∣pense him according to his deeds. A greater trust is reposed, upon this account, in the regularity and exactness of his con∣duct. And wherever the natural princi∣ples of religion are not corrupted by the factious and party zeal of some worthless cabal; wherever the first duty which it re∣quires, is to fulfil all the obligations of morality; wherever men are not taught to regard frivolous observances, as more immediate duties of religion, than acts of justice and beneficence; and to imagine, that by sacrifices and ceremonies, and vain supplications, they can bargain with the Deity for fraud, and perfidy, and violence, the world undoubtedly judges right in this respect, and justly places a double confi∣dence in the rectitude of the religious man's behaviour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. In what cases the sense of duty ought to be the sole principle of our conduct; and in what cases it ought to concur with other motives.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION affords such strong mo∣tives to the practice of virtue, and guards us by such powerful restraints from the temptations of vice, that many have been led to suppose, that religious princi∣ples were the sole laudable motives of ac∣tion. We ought neither, they said, to reward from gratitude, nor punish from resentment; we ought neither to protect the helplessness of our children, nor af∣ford support to the infirmities of our pa∣rents, from natural affection. All affec∣tions for particular objects, ought to be extinguished in our breast, and one great affection take the place of all others, the love of the Deity, the desire of ren∣dering ourselves agreeable to him, and of directing our conduct in every respect ac∣cording to his will. We ought not to be grateful from gratitude, we ought not to
<PB REF="311"/>
be charitable from humanity, we ought not to be public spirited from the love of our country, nor generous and just from the love of mankind. The sole principle and motive of our conduct in the perform∣ance of all those different duties, ought to be a sense that God has commanded us to perform them. I shall not at present take time to examine this opinion particularly; I shall only observe, that we should not have expected to have found it entertained by any sect, who professed themselves of a religion in which, as it is the first precept to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength, so it is the second to love our neighbour as we love ourselves; and we love ourselves surely for our own sakes, and not merely because we are commanded to do so. That the sense of duty should be the sole prin∣ciple of our conduct, is no where the pre∣cept of Christianity; but that it should be the ruling and the governing one, as phi∣losophy, and as, indeed, common sense di∣rects. It may be a question, however, in what cases our actions ought to arise chief∣ly or entirely from a sense of duty, or from
<PB N="299" REF="312"/>
a regard to general rules; and in what cases some other sentiment or affection ought to concur, and have a principal in∣fluence.</P>
<P>The decision of this question, which cannot, perhaps, be given with any very great accuracy, will depend upon two dif∣ferent circumstances; first, upon the na∣tural agreeableness or deformity of the sen∣timent or affection which would prompt us to any action independent of all regard to general rules; and secondly, upon the precision and exactness, or the looseness and inaccuracy of the general rules them∣selves.</P>
<P N="1">I. First, I say, it will depend upon the natural agreeableness or deformity of the affection itself, how far our actions should arise from it, or entirely proceed from a regard to the general rule.</P>
<P>All those graceful and admired actions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which the benevolent affections would prompt us, ought to proceed as much from the passions themselves, as from any regard to the general rules of conduct. A benefactor thinks himself but ill requit∣ed, if the person upon whom he has be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>towed his good offices, repays them merely
<PB N="300" REF="313"/>
from a cold sense of duty, and without any affection to his person. A husband is dissatisfied with the most obedient wife, when he imagines her conduct is animated by no other principle besides her regard to what the relation she stands in requires. Tho' a son should fail in none of the offi∣ces of filial duty, yet if he wants that af∣fectionate reverence which it so well be∣comes him to feel, the parent may justly complain of his indifference. Nor could a son be quite satisfied with a parent who, tho' he performed all the duties of his si∣tuation, had nothing of that fatherly fond∣ness which might have been expected from him. With regard to all such benevolent and social affections, it is agreeable to see the sense of duty employed rather to re∣strain than to enliven them, rather to hin∣der us from doing too much, than to prompt us to do what we ought. It gives us pleasure to see a father obliged to check his own fondness, a friend obliged to set bounds to his natural generosity, a person who has received a benefit, obliged to re∣strain the too sanguine gratitude of his own temper.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="314"/>The contrary maxim takes place with regard to the malevolent and unsocial pas∣sions. We ought to reward from the gra∣titude and generosity of our own hearts, without any reluctance, and without be∣ing obliged to reflect how great the pro∣priety of rewarding: but we ought al∣ways to punish with reluctance, and more from a sense of the propriety of punish∣ing, than from any savage disposition to revenge. Nothing is more graceful than the behaviour of the man who appears to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent the greatest injuries, more from a sense that they deserve, and are the proper objects of resentment, than from feeling himself the furies of that disagreeable pas∣sion; who, like a judge, considers only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he general rule, which determines what vengeance is due for each particular of∣fence; who, in executing that rule, feels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess for what himself has suffered, than for what the offender is about to suffer; who, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' in wrath remembers mercy, and is disposed to interpret the rule in the most gentle and favourable manner, and to al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow of all the alleviations which the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andid humanity could, consistently with good sense, admit of.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="315" MS="y"/>As the selfish passions, according to what has formerly been observed, hold in other respects a sort of middle place, between the social and unsocial affections, so do they likewise in this. The pursuit of the objects of private interest, in all common, little, and ordinary cases, ought to flow rather from a regard to the general rules which prescribe such conduct, than from any passion for the objects themselves; but upon more important and extraordi∣nary occasions, we should be aukward, insipid, and ungraceful, if the objects themselves did not appear to animate us with a considerable degree of passion. To be anxious, or to be laying a plot either to gain or to save a single shilling, would degrade the most vulgar tradesman in the opinion of all his neighbours. Let his circumstances be ever so mean, no atten∣tion to any such small matters, for the sake of the things themselves, must appear in his conduct. His situation may require the most severe oeconomy, and the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> exact assiduity: but each particular exer∣tion of that oeconomy and assiduity must proceed not so much from a regard for that particular saving or gain, as for the gene∣ral
<PB N="303" REF="316"/>
rule which to him prescribes, with the utmost rigour, such a tenor of conduct. His parsimony to day must not arise from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desire of the particular three pence which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will save by it, nor his attendance in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is shop from a passion for the particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pence which he will acquire by it: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth the one and the other ought to pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed solely from a regard to the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ule, which prescribes, with the most un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elenting severity, this plan of conduct to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll persons in his way of life.

We should have little re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ect for a private gentleman who did not
<PB N="304" REF="317"/>
exert himself to gain an estate, or even a considerable office, when he could acquire them without either meanness or injustice. A member of parliament who shews no keenness about his own election, is aban∣doned by his friends, as altogether unwor∣thy of their attachment. Even a trades∣man is thought a poor-spirited fellow a∣mong his neighbours, who does not bestir himself to get what they call an extraor∣dinary job, or some uncommon advantage. This spirit and keenness constitutes the dif∣ference betwixt the man of enterprize and the man of dull regularity. Those great objects of self-interest, of which the loss or acquisition quite changes the rank of the person, are the objects of the passion properly called ambition; a passion, which when it keeps within the bounds of pru∣dence and justice, is always admired in the world, and has even sometimes a certain irregular greatness, which dazzles the ima∣gination, when it passes the limits of both these virtues, and is not only unjust but extravagant. Hence the general admira∣tion for Heroes and Conquerors, and even for Statesmen, whose projects have been
<PB N="305" REF="318"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery daring and extensive, tho' altogether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evoid of justice. Such as those of the Cardinals of Richlieu and of Retz. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bjects of avarice and ambition differ only in their greatness. A miser is as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urious about a halfpenny, as a man of ambition about the conquest of a king∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om.</P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly, I say, it will depend part∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y upon the precision and exactness, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he looseness and inaccuracy of the gene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al rules themselves, how far our conduct ought to proceed entirely from a regard to them.</P>
<P>The general rules of almost all the virtues, the general rules which determine what are the offices of prudence, of cha∣rity, of generosity, of gratitude, of friend∣ship, are in many respects loose and in∣accurate, admit of many exceptions, and require so many modifications, that it is scarce possible to regulate our conduct en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irely by a regard to them. The common proverbial maxims of prudence, being founded in universal experience, are per∣haps the best general rules which can be given about it. To affect, however, a
<PB N="306" REF="319"/>
very strict and literal adherence to them would evidently be the most absurd and ridiculous pedantry. Of all the virtues I have just now mentioned, gratitude is that, perhaps, of which the rules are the most precise, and admit of the few∣est exceptions. That as soon as we can we should make a return of equal, and if possible of superior value to the ser∣vices we have received, would seem to be a pretty plain rule, and one which admitted of scarce any exceptions. Upon the most superficial examination, how∣ever, this rule will appear to be in the highest degree loose and inaccurate, and to admit of ten thousand exceptions. If your benefactor attended you in your sick∣ness, ought you to attend him in his? or can you fulfil the obligation of gra∣titude, by making a return of a differ∣ent kind? If you ought to attend him, how long ought you to attend him? The same time which he attended you, or longer, and how much longer? If your friend lent you money in your distress, ought you to lend him money in his? How much ought you to lend him? When
<PB N="307" REF="320"/>
ought you to lend it him? Now, or to∣morrow, or next month? And for how long a time? It is evident, that no ge∣neral rule can be laid down, by which a precise answer can, in all cases, be given to any of these questions. The differ∣ence between his character and your's, be∣tween his circumstances and your's, may be such, that you may be perfectly grateful, and justly refuse to lend him a halfpenny: and, on the contrary, you may be wil∣ling to lend, or even to give him ten times the sum which he lent you, and yet justly be accused of the blackest in∣gratitude, and of not having fulfilled the hundredth part of the obligation you lie under. As the duties of gratitude, how∣ever, are perhaps the most sacred of all those which the beneficent virtues pre∣scribe to us, so the general rules which determine them are, as I said before, the most accurate. Those which ascertain the actions required by friendship, hu∣manity, hospitality, generosity, are still more vague and indeterminate.</P>
<P>There is, however, one virtue of which the general rules determine with the great∣est
<PB N="308" REF="321"/>
exactness every external action which it requires. This virtue is justice. The rules of justice are accurate in the highest degree, and admit of no exceptions or modifications, but such as may be ascer∣tained as accurately as the rules them∣selves, and which generally, indeed, flow from the very same principles with them. If I owe a man ten pounds, justice requires that I should precisely pay him ten pounds, either at the time agreed upon, or when he demands it. What I ought to per∣form, how much I ought to perform, when and where I ought to perform it, the whole nature and circumstances of the action prescribed, are all of them pre∣cisely fixt and determined. Tho' it may be aukward and pedantic, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affect too strict an adherence to the com∣mon rules of prudence or generosity, there is no pedantry in sticking fast by the rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of justice. On the contrary, the most sacred regard is due to them; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> actions which this virtue requires are ne∣ver so properly performed, as when the chief motive for performing them is a re∣verential and religious regard to thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="309" REF="322"/>
general rules which require them. In the practice of the other virtues, our conduct should rather be directed by a certain idea of propriety, by a certain taste for a par∣ticular tenor of conduct, than by any re∣gard to a precise maxim or rule; and we should consider the end and foundation of the rule, more than the rule itself. But it is otherwise with regard to justice: the man who in that refines the least, and adheres with the most obstinate stedfast∣ness, to the general rules themselves, is the most commendable, and the most to be depended upon. Tho' the end of the rules of justice be, to hinder us from hurt∣ing our neighbour, it may frequently be a crime to violate them, tho' we could pretend, with some pretext of reason, that this particular violation could do no hurt. A man often becomes a villain the moment he begins, even in his own heart, to chi∣cane in this manner. The moment he thinks of departing from the most staunch and positive adherence to what those in∣violable precepts prescribe to him, he is no longer to be trusted, and no man can say what degree of guilt he may not arrive
<PB N="310" REF="323"/>
at. The thief imagines he does no evil▪ when he steals from the rich, what he supposes they may easily want, and what possibly they may never even know has been stolen from them. The adulterer imagines he does no evil, when he cor∣rupts the wife of his friend, provided he covers his intrigue from the suspicion of the husband, and does not disturb the peace of the family. When once we begin to give way to such refinements, there is no enormity so gross of which we may not be capable.</P>
<P>The rules of justice may be compared to the rules of grammar; the rules of the other virtues, to the rules which criticks lay down for the attainment of what is sublime and elegant in composition. The one, are precise, accurate, and indispen∣sible. The other, are loose, vague, and indeterminate, and present us rather with a general idea of the perfection we ought to aim at, than afford us any certain and infallible directions for acquiring it. A man may learn to write grammatically by rule, with the most absolute infallibility; and so, perhaps, he may be taught to act justly.
<PB N="311" REF="324"/>
But there are no rules whose observance will infallibly lead us to the attainment of elegance or sublimity in writing, tho' there are some which may help us, in some mea∣sure, to correct and ascertain the vague ideas which we might otherwise have en∣tertained of those perfections: and there are no rules by the knowledge of which we can infallibly be taught to act upon all occasions with prudence, with just magnanimity, or proper beneficence. Tho' there are some which may enable us to correct and ascertain, in several respects, the imperfect ideas which we might other∣wise have entertained of those virtues.</P>
<P>It may sometimes happen, that with the most serious and earnest desire of acting so as to deserve approbation, we may mistake the proper rules of conduct, and thus be misled by that very principle which ought to direct us. It is in vain to expect, that in this case mankind should entirely approve of our behaviour. They cannot enter into that absurd idea of duty which influenced us, nor go along with any of the actions which follow from it. There is still, however, something respect∣able
<PB N="312" REF="325"/>
in the character and behaviour of one who is thus betrayed into vice, by a wrong sense of duty, or by what is called an erroneous conscience. How fatally so∣ever he may be misled by it, he is still, with the generous and humane, more the object of commiseration than of hatred or resentment. They lament the weak∣ness of human nature, which exposes us to such unhappy delusions, even while we are most sincerely labouring after perfec∣tion, and endeavouring to act according to the best principle which can possibly direct us. False notions of religion are almost the only causes which can occasion any very gross perversion of our natural sentiments in this way; and that prin∣ciple which gives the greatest authority to the rules of duty, is alone capable of distorting our ideas of them in any con∣siderable degree. In all other cases com∣mon sense is sufficient to direct us, if not to the most exquisite propriety of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣duct, yet to something which is not very far from it; and provided we are in ear∣nest desirous to do well, our behaviour will always, upon the whole, be praise-worthy. That to obey the will of the
<PB N="313" REF="326"/>
Deity, is the first rule of duty, all men are agreed. But concerning the particu∣lar commandments which that will may impose upon us, they differ widely from one another. In this, therefore, the great∣est mutual forbearance and toleration is due; and tho' the defence of society re∣quires that crimes should be punished, from whatever motives they proceed, yet a good man will always punish them with reluctance, when they evidently proceed from false notions of religious duty. He will never feel against those who commit them that indignation which he feels against other criminals, but will rather re∣gret, and sometimes even admire their un∣fortunate firmness and magnanimity, at the very time that he punishes their crime. In the tragedy of Mahomet, one of the finest of Mr. Voltaire's, it is well repre∣sented, what ought to be our sentiments for crimes which proceed from such mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves. In that tragedy, two young peo∣ple of different sexes, of the most inno∣cent and virtuous dispositions, and with∣out any other weakness except what en∣dears them the more to us, a mutual fondness for one another, are instigated
<PB N="314" REF="327"/>
by the strongest motives of a false religion, to commit a horrid murder, that shocks all the principles of human nature: a venerable old man, who had expressed the most tender affection for them both, for whom, notwithstanding he was the avow∣ed enemy of their religion, they had both conceived the highest reverence and esteem, and who was in reality their father, tho' they did not know him to be such, is pointed out to them as a sacrifice which God had expressly required at their hands, and they are commanded to kill him. While they are about executing this crime, they are tortured with all the agonies which can arise from the struggle between the idea of the indispensibleness of religi∣ous duty on the one side, and compassion, gratitude, reverence for the age, and love for the humanity and virtue of the per∣son whom they are going to destroy, on the other. The representation of this ex∣hibits one of the most interesting, and perhaps the most instructive spectacle that was ever introduced upon any theatre. The sense of duty, however, at last pre∣vails over all the amiable weaknesses of human nature. They execute the crime
<PB N="315" REF="328"/>
imposed upon them; but immediately dis∣cover their error▪ and the fraud which had deceived them, and are distracted with horror, remorse, and resentment. Such as are our sentiments for the unhappy Seid and Palmira, such ought we to feel for every person who is in this manner misled by religion, when we are sure that it is really religion which misleads him, and not the pretence of it, which is made a cover to some of the worst of human passions.</P>
<P>As a person may act wrong by following a wrong sense of duty, so nature may some∣times prevail, and lead him to act right in opposition to it. We cannot in this case be displeased to see that motive prevail, which we think ought to prevail, tho' the person himself is so weak as to think otherwise. As his conduct, however, is the effect of weak∣ness, not principle, we are far from bestow∣ing upon it any thing that approaches to compleat approbation. A bigotted Roman Catholic, who, during the massacre of St. Bartholomew, had been so overcome by compassion, as to save some unhappy pro∣testants, whom he thought it his duty to destroy, would not seem to be entitled to
<PB N="316" REF="329"/>
that high applause which we should have bestowed upon him, had he exerted the same generosity with compleat self-appro∣bation. We might be pleased with the humanity of his temper, but we should still regard him with a sort of pity which is altogether inconsistent with the admira∣tion that is due to perfect virtue. It is the same case with all the other passions. We do not dislike to see them exert them∣selves properly, even when a false notion of duty would direct the person to restrain them. A very devout Quaker, who upon being struck upon one cheek, instead of turning up the other, should so far forget his literal interpretation of our Saviour's precept, as to bestow some good discipline upon the brute that insulted him, would not be disagreeable to us. We should laugh, and be diverted with his spirit, and rather like him the better for it. But we should by no means regard him with that respect and esteem which would seem due to one who, upon a like occasion, had acted properly, from a just sense of what was proper to be done. No action can pro∣perly be called virtuous, which is not ac∣companied with the sentiment of self-ap∣probation.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. Of the EFFECT of UTILITY upon the sentiment of approbation.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the beauty which the appearance of UTI∣LITY bestows upon all the productions of art, and of the extensive influence of this species of beauty.</HEAD>
<P>THAT utility is one of the principal sources of beauty has been observed by every body, who has considered with any attention what constitutes the nature of beau∣ty. The conveniency of a house gives plea∣sure to the spectator as well as its regularity, and he is as much hurt when he observes the contrary defect, as when he sees the cor∣respondent windows of different forms, or the door not placed exactly in the middle of the building. That the fitness of any system or machine to produce the end for which it was intended, bestows a certain propriety and
<PB N="338" REF="331"/>
beauty upon the whole, and renders the very thought and contemplation of it agreeable, is so very obvious that nobody has over∣looked it.</P>
<P>The cause too, why utility pleases, has of late been assigned by an ingenious and agree∣able philosopher, who joins the greatest depth of thought to the greatest elegance of ex∣pression, and possesses the singular and happy talent of treating the abstrusest subjects not only with the most perfect perspicuity, but with the most lively eloquence. The utility of any object, according to him, pleases the master by perpetually suggesting to him the pleasure or conveniency which it is fitted to promote. Every time he looks at it, he is put in mind of this pleasure; and the object in this manner becomes a source of perpetual satisfaction and enjoyment. The spectator enters by sympathy into the sentiments of the master, and necessarily views the object un∣der the same agreeable aspect. When we visit the palaces of the great, we cannot help conceiving the satisfaction we should enjoy if we ourselves were the masters, and were pos∣sessed of so much artful and ingeniously con∣trived accommodation. A similar account is given why the appearance of inconveniency
<PB N="339" REF="332"/>
should render any object disagreeable both to the owner and to the spectator.</P>
<P>But that this fitness, this happy contri∣vance of any production of art should often be more valued, than the very end for which it was intended; and that the exact adjust∣ment of the means for attaining any conve∣niency or pleasure, should frequently be more regarded, than that very conveniency or pleasure, in the attainment of which their whole merit would seem to consist, has not, so far as I know, been yet taken notice of by any body. That this however is very frequently the case, may be observed in a thousand instances, both in the most frivo∣lous and in the most important concerns of human life.</P>
<P>When a person comes into his chamber, and finds the chairs all standing in the middle of the room, he is angry with his servant, and rather than see them continue in that disorder, perhaps takes the trouble himself to set them all in their places with their backs to the wall. The whole propriety of this new situation arises from its superior conveniency in leaving the floor free and disengaged. To attain this conveniency he voluntarily puts himself to more trouble than all he could
<PB N="340" REF="333"/>
have suffered from the want of it; since no∣thing was more easy, than to have set himself down upon one of them, which is probably what he does when his labour is over. What he wanted therefore, it seems, was not so much this conveniency, as that arangement of things which promotes it. Yet it is this conveniency which ultimately recommends that arrangement, and bestows upon it the whole of its propriety and beauty.</P>
<P>A watch, in the same manner, that falls behind above two minutes in a day, is de∣spised by one curious in watches. He sells it perhaps for a couple of guineas, and pur∣chases another at fifty, which will not lose above a minute in a fortnight. The sole use of watches however, is to tell us what o'clock it is, and to hinder us from breaking any en∣gagement, or suffering any other inconveni∣ency by our ignorance in that particular point. But the person so nice with regard to this machine, will not always be found ei∣ther more scrupulously punctual than other men or more anxiously concerned upon any other account, to know precisely what time of day it is. What interests him is not so much the attainment of this piece of know∣ledge
<PB N="341" REF="334"/>
as the perfection of the machine that serves to attain it.</P>
<P>How many people ruin themselves by lay∣ing out money on trinkets of frivolous utility? What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the utility, as the aptness of the ma∣chines that are fitted to promote it. All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniencies. They contrive new pockets, unknown in the cloaths of other people, in order to carry a greater number. They walk about loaded with a multitude of baubles, in weight and sometimes in value not inferior to an ordinary Jews-box, some of which may sometimes be of some little use, but all of which might at all times be very well spared, and of which the whole utility is certainly not worth the fatigue of bearing the burden.</P>
<P>Nor is it only with regard to such frivo∣lous objects that our conduct is influenced by this principle; it is often the secret motive of the most serious and important pursuits of both private and public life.</P>
<P>The poor man's son, whom heaven in its anger has visited with ambition, when he be∣gins to look around him admires the con∣dition of the rich. He finds the cottage of his father too small for his accommodation,
<PB N="342" REF="335"/>
and fancies he should be lodged more at his ease in a palace. He is displeased with be∣ing obliged to walk a-foot, or to endure the fatigue of riding on horseback. He sees his superiors carried about in machines, and imagines that in one of these he could travel with less inconveniency. He feels himself naturally indolent, and willing to serve him∣self with his own hands as little as possible; and judges, that a numerous retinue of ser∣vants would save him from a great deal of trouble. He thinks if he had attained all these, he could sit still contentedly, and be quiet, enjoying himself in the thought of the happiness and tranquillity of his situation. He is enchanted with the distant idea of this felicity. It appears in his fancy like the life of some superior rank of beings▪ and, in order to arrive at it, he devotes himself for ever to the pursuit of wealth and greatness. To obtain the conveniencies which these afford he submits in the first year, nay in the first month of his application, to more fa∣tigue of body and more uneasiness of mind than he could have suffered through the whole of his life from the want of them. He studies to distinguish himself in some la∣borious profession. With the most unrelent∣ing
<PB N="343" REF="336"/>
industry he labours night and day to ac∣quire talents superior to all his competitors. He endeavours next to bring those talents into public view, and with equal assiduity so∣licits every opportunity of employment. For this purpose he makes his court to all man∣kind; he serves those whom he hates, and is obsequious to those whom he despises. Through the whole of his life he pursues the idea of a certain artificial and elegant repose which he may never arrive at, for which he sacrifices a real tranquillity that is at all times in his power, and which, if in the extremity of old age he should at last attain to it, he will find to be in no respect preferable to that humble security and contentment which he had abandoned for it. It is then, in the last dregs of life, his body wasted with toil and diseases, his mind gauled and ruffled by the memory of a thousand injuries and disap∣pointments which he imagines he has met with from the injustice of his enemies, or from the perfidy and ingratitude of his friends, that he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility, no more adapted for pro∣curing ease of body or tranquillity of mind than the tweezer-cases of the lover of toys;
<PB N="344" REF="337"/>
and like them too more troublesome to the person who carries them about with him than all the advantages they can afford him are commodious. There is no other real differ∣ence between them, except that the conve∣niencies of the one are somewhat more ob∣servable than those of the other. The pa∣laces, the gardens, the equipage, the re∣tinue of the great are objects of which the obvious conveniency strikes every body. They do not require that their masters should point out to us wherein consists their utility. Of our own accord we readily enter into it, and by sympathy enjoy and thereby applaud the satisfaction which they are fitted to afford him. But the curiosity of a tooth-pick, of an ear-picker, of a machine for cutting the nails, or of any other trinket of the same kind, is not so obvious. Their conveniency may perhaps be equally great, but it is not so striking, and we do not so readily enter into the satisfaction of the man who possesses them. They are therefore less reasonable subjects of vanity than the magnificence of wealth and greatness; and in this consists the sole advantage of these last. They more effectually gratify that love of distinction so natural to man. To one who was to live
<PB N="345" REF="338"/>
alone in a desolate island it might be a matter of doubt perhaps whether a palace or a collec∣tion of such small conveniencies as are com∣monly contained in a tweezer-case, would con∣tribute most to his happiness and enjoyment. If he is to live in society, indeed, there can be no comparison, because in this, as in all other cases, we constantly pay more re∣gard to the sentiments of the spectator, than to those of the person principally concern'd, and consider rather how his situation will appear to other people, than how it will appear to himself. If we examine, however, why the spectator distinguishes with such admira∣tion the condition of the rich and the great, we shall find that it is not so much upon ac∣count of the superior ease or pleasure which they are supposed to enjoy, as of the num∣berless artificial and elegant contrivances for promoting this ease or pleasure. He does not even imagine that they are really happier than other people: but he imagines that they possess more means of happiness. And it is the ingenious and artful adjustment of those means to the end for which they were intend∣ed, that is the principal source of his admi∣ration.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="339"/>But in the languor of disease, and the wea∣riness of old age, the pleasures of the vain and empty distinctions of greatness disappear. To one in this situation they are no longer capable of recommending those toilsome pur∣suits in which they had formerly engaged him. In his heart he curses ambition, and vainly regrets the ease and the indolence of youth, pleasures which are fled forever, and which he has foolishly sacrificed for what, when he has got it, can afford him no real satisfaction.</P>
<P>In this miserable aspect does greatness ap∣pear to every man when reduced either by spleen or disease to observe with attention his own situation, and to consider what it is that is really wanting to his happiness. Power and riches appear then to be, what they are, enormous and operose machines, contrived to produce a few triffling conveniencies to the body, consisting of springs the most nice and delicate, which must be kept in order with the most anxious attention, and which in spite of all our care are ready every mo∣ment to burst into pieces, and to crush in their ruins their unfortunate possessor. They are immense fabrics, which it requires the labour of a life to raise, which threaten every
<PB N="347" REF="340"/>
moment to overwhelm the person who dwells in them, and which while they stand, though they may save him from some small∣er inconveniencies, can protect him from none of the severer inclemencies of the sea∣son. They keep off the summer shower, not the winter storm, but leave him always as much, and sometimes more exposed than before, to anxiety, to fear, and to sorrow; to diseases, to danger, and to death.</P>
<P>But tho' this splenetic philosophy, which in time of sickness or low spirits is familiar to every man, thus entirely depreciates those great objects of human desire, when in bet∣ter health and in better humour, we never fail to regard them under a more agreeable aspect. Our imagination, which in pain and sorrow seems to be confined and cooped up within our own persons, in times of ease and prosperity expands itself to every thing around us. We are then charmed with the beauty of that accomodation which reigns in the palaces and oeconomy of the great; and admire how every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing is adapted to promote their ease, to prevent their wants, to gratify their wishes, and to amuse and entertain their most frivo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous desires. If we consider the real satis∣faction which all these things are capable of
<PB N="348" REF="341"/>
affording, by itself and seperated from the beauty of that arangement which is fitted to promote it, it will always appear in the high∣est degree contemptible and trifling. But we rarely view it in this abstract and philosophi∣cal light. We naturally confound it in our imagination with the order, the regular and harmonious movement of the system, the machine or oeconomy by means of which it is produced. The pleasures of wealth and greatness, when considered in this complex view, strike the imagination as something grand and beautiful and noble, of which the attainment is well worth all the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and anxiety which we are so apt to bestow upon it.</P>
<P>And it is well that nature imposes upon us in this manner. It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the in∣dustry of mankind. It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground, to build houses, to found cities and common∣wealths, and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts, which ennoble and embel∣lish human life; which have entirely chang∣ed the whole face of the globe, have turned the rude forests of nature into agreeable and fertile plains, and made the trackless and bar∣ren
<PB N="349" REF="342"/>
ocean a new fund of subsistence, and the great high road of communication to the dif∣ferent nations of the earth. The earth by these labours of mankind has been obliged to redouble her natural fertility, and to maintain a greater multitude of inhabitants. It is to no purpose, that the proud and unfeeling land∣lord views his extensive fields, and without a thought for the wants of his brethren, in ima∣gination consumes himself the whole harvest that grows upon them. The homely and vulgar proverb, that the eye is larger than the belly, never was more fully verified than with regard to him. The capacity of his sto∣mach bears no proportion to the immensity of his desires, and will receive no more than that of the meanest peasant. The rest he is obliged to distribute among those, who pre∣pare, in the nicest manner, that little which he himself makes use of, among those who fit up the palace in which this little is to be con∣sumed, among those who provide and keep in order all the different baubles and trinkets, which are employed in the oeconomy of great∣ness; all of whom thus derive from his luxu∣ry and caprice, that share of the necessaries of life, which they would in vain have ex∣pected from his humanity or his justice. The

produce of the soil maintains at all times nearly that number of inhabitants, which it is ca∣pable of maintaining. The rich only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable. They consume little more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the poor, and in spite of their natural selfish∣ness and rapacity, tho' they mean only their own conveniency, tho' the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thou∣sands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multi∣plication of the species. When providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition▪ These last too enjoy their share of all that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> produces.

them. They make part of the great system of government, and the wheels of the political machine seem to move with more harmony and ease by means of them.

All constitutions of government, however, are valued only in proportion, as they tend to promote the hap∣piness of those who live under them. This is their sole use and end. From a certain spi∣rit of system, however, from a certain love of art and contrivance, we sometimes seem to value the means more than the end, and to be eager to promote the happiness of our fel∣low-creatures, rather from a view to perfect and improve a certain beautiful and orderly system, than from any immediate sense o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feeling of what they either suffer or enjoy▪ There have been men of the greatest public spirit, who have shown themselves in othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respects not very sensible to the feelings o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humanity.

his acquaintance instances both of the one kind and the other. Who had ever less hu∣manity, or more public spirit than the cele∣brated legislator of Muscovy? The social and well natured James the first of Great-Britain seems on the contrary to have had scarce any passion, either for the glory, or the interest of his country. Would you awaken the indu∣stry of the man, who seems almost dead to ambition, it will often be to no purpose to describe to him the happiness of the rich and the great; to tell him that they are gene∣rally sheltered from the sun and the rain, that they are seldom hungry, that they are seldom cold, and that they are rarely ex∣posed to weariness, or to want of any kind. The most eloquent exhortation of this kind will have little effect upon him. If you would hope to succeed, you must describe to him the conveniency and arrangement of the different apartments in their palaces; you must explain to him the propriety of their equipages, and point out to him the number, the order, and the different of∣fices of all their attendants. If any thing is capable of making impression upon him this will. Yet all these things tend only to keep off the sun and the rain, to save them from hunger and cold, from want and wea∣riness.
<PB N="354" REF="347"/>
In the same manner, if you would implant public virtue in the breast of him, who seems heedless of the interest of his coun∣try, it will often be to no purpose to tell him, what superior advantages the subjects of a well-governed state enjoy; that they are bet∣ter lodged, that they are better cloathed, that they are better fed. These conside∣rations will commonly make no great impres∣sion. You will be more likely to persuade, if you describe the great system of public po∣lice which procures these advantages, if you explain the connections and dependencies of its several parts, their mutual subordination to one another, and their general subservi∣ency to the happiness of the society; if you show how this system might be introduced into his own country, what it is that hinders it from taking place there at present, how those obstructions might be removed, and all the several wheels of the machine of govern∣ment be made to move with more harmony and smoothness, without grating upon one another, or mutually retarding one another's motions. It is scarce possible that a man should listen to a discourse of this kind, and not feel himself animated to some degree of public spirit. He will, at least for the mo∣ment, feel some desire to remove those ob∣structions,
<PB N="355" REF="348"/>
and to put into motion so beautiful and so orderly a machine. Nothing tends so much to promote public spirit as the study of politics, of the several systems of civil go∣vernment, their advantages and disadvan∣tages, of the constitution of our own coun∣try, its situation, and interest with regard to foreign nations, its commerce, its defence, the disadvantages it labours under, the dan∣gers to which it may be exposed, how to re∣move the one, and how to guard against the other. Upon this account political disquisi∣tions, if just, and reasonable, and practicable, are of all the works of speculation the most useful. Even the weakest and the worst of them are not altogether without their utility. They serve at least to animate the public pas∣sions of men, and rouze them to seek out the means of promoting the happiness of the so∣ciety.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the beauty which the appearance of uti∣lity bestows upon the characters and acti∣ons of men; and how far the perception of this beauty may be regarded as one of the original principles of approbation.</HEAD>
<P>THE characters of men, as well as the contrivances of art, or the institutions of civil government, may be fitted either to pro∣mote or to disturb the happiness both of the individual and of the society. The prudent, the equitable, the active, resolute and sober character promises prosperity and satisfaction▪ both to the person himself and to every one connected with him. The rash, the insolent, the slothful, effeminate and voluptuous, on the contrary forbodes ruin to the individual, and misfortune to all who have any thing to do with him. The first turn of mind has at least all the beauty which can belong to the most perfect machine that was ever in∣vented for promoting the most agreeable pur∣pose: and the second all the deformity of the
<PB N="357" REF="350"/>
most aukward and clumsy contrivance. What institution of government could tend so much to promote the happiness of mankind as the general prevalence of wisdom and virtue? All government is but an imperfect remedy for the deficiency of these. Whatever beauty, therefore, can belong to civil government up∣on account of its utility, must in a far supe∣rior degree belong to these. On the contrary, what civil policy can be so ruinous and de∣structive as the vices of men. The fatal effects of bad government arise from no∣thing, but that it does not sufficiently guard against the mischiefs which human wicked∣ness gives occasion to.</P>
<P>This beauty and deformity which charac∣ters appear to derive from their usefulness or inconveniency, are apt to strike, in a pecu∣liar manner, those who consider in an abstract and philosophical light, the actions and con∣duct of mankind. When a philosopher goes to examine why humanity is approved of, or cruelty condemned, he does▪ not always form to himself in a very clear and distinct manner, the conception of any one particular action either of cruelty or of humanity, but is com∣monly contented with the vague and inde∣terminate idea which the general names of
<PB N="358" REF="351"/>
those qualities suggest to him. But it is in particular instances only that the propriety or impropriety, the merit and demerit of actions is very obvious and discernible. It is only when particular examples are given that we perceive distinctly either the concord or disa∣greement between our own affections and those of the agent, or feel a social gratitude arise to∣wards him in the one case, or a sympathetic re∣sentment in the other. When we consider vir∣tue and vice in an abstract and general manner, the qualities by which they excite these se∣veral sentiments seem in a great measure to disappear, and the sentiments themselves be∣come less obvious and discernible. On the contrary the happy effects of the one and the fatal consequences of the other seem then to rise up to the view, and as it were to stand out and distinguish themselves from all the other qualities of either.</P>
<P>The same ingenious and agreeable author who first explained why utility pleases, has been so struck with this view of things, as to resolve our whole approbation of virtue into a perception of this species of beauty which results from the appearance of utility. No qualities of the mind, he observes, are approved of as virtuous, but such as are use∣ful
<PB N="359" REF="352"/>
or agreeable either to the person himself or to others; and no qualities are disapproved of as vitious but such as have a contrary tendency. And, nature, indeed, seems to have so hap∣pily adjusted our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation, to the conveniency both of the individual and of the society, that af∣ter the strictest examination it will be found, I believe, that this is universally the case. But still I affirm, that it is not the view of this utility or hurtfulness which is either the first or principal source of our approbation and disapprobation. These sentiments are no doubt enhanced and enlivened by the perception of the beauty or deformity which results from this utility or hurtfulness. But still, I say, they are originally and essentially different from this perception.</P>
<P>For first of all it seems impossible that the approbation of virtue should be a senti∣ment of the same kind with that by which we approve of a convenient and well contrived building; or that we should have no other reason for praising a man than that for which we commend a chest of drawers.</P>
<P>And secondly it will be found, upon exa∣mination, that the usefulness of any disposi∣tion of mind is seldom the first ground of
<PB N="360" REF="353"/>
our approbation; and that the sentiment of approbation always involves in it a sense of propriety quite distinct from the perception of utility. We may observe this with regard to all the qualities which are approved of as virtuous, both those which, according to this system, are originally valued as useful to ourselves, as well as those which are esteem∣ed on account of their usefulness to others.</P>
<P>The qualities most useful to ourselves are first of all superior reason and understand∣ing, by which we are capable of discerning the remote consequences of all our actions, and of forseeing the advantage or detriment which is likely to result from them: and se∣condly, self-command, by which we are en∣abled to abstain from present pleasure or to endure present pain, in order to obtain a greater pleasure or to avoid a greater pain in some future time. In the union of those two qualities consists the virtue of prudence, of all the virtues that which is most useful to the individual.</P>
<P>With regard to the first of those qualities, it has been observed upon a former occasion that superior reason and understanding are originally approved of as just and right and accurate, and not meerly as useful or ad∣vantageous.
<PB N="361" REF="354"/>
It is in the abstruser sciences, particularly in the higher parts of mathema∣tics, that the greatest and most admired ex∣ertions of human reason have been displayed. But the utility of those sciences, either to the individual or to the public, is not very obvi∣ous, and to prove it requires a discussion which is not always very easily comprehend∣ed. It was not, therefore, their utility which first recommended them to the public admi∣ration. This quality was but little insisted upon, till it became necessary to make some reply to the reproaches of those, who, hav∣ing themselves no taste for such sublime dis∣coveries, endeavoured to depreciate them as useless.</P>
<P>That self-command, in the same manner, by which we restrain our present appetites in order to gratify them more fully upon ano∣ther occasion is approved of as much under the aspect of propriety as under that of utility. When we act in this manner the sentiments which influence our conduct seem exactly to coincide with those of the spectator. The spectator does not feel the sollicitations of our present appetites. To him the pleasure which we are to enjoy a week hence, or a year hence, is just as interesting as that which we are to
<PB N="362" REF="355"/>
enjoy this moment. When for the sake of the present, therefore, we sacrifice the future, our conduct appears to him absurd and ex∣travagant in the highest degree, and he can∣not enter into the principles which influence it. On the contrary, when we abstain from present pleasure, in order to secure greater pleasure to come, when we act as if the re∣mote object interested us as much as that which immediately presses upon the senses, as our affections exactly correspond with his own, he cannot fail to approve of our beha∣viour: and as he knows from experience, how few are capable of this self-command he looks upon our conduct with a considera∣ble degree of wonder and admiration. Hence arises that eminent esteem with which all men naturally regard a steady perseverance in the practice of frugality, industry and ap∣plication, though directed to no other purpose than the acquisition of fortune. The resolute firmness of the person who acts in this manner, and in order to obtain a great though remote advantage, not only gives up all present pleasures, but endures the greatest labour both of mind and body, necessarily com∣mands our approbation. That view of his interest and happiness which appears to re∣gulate
<PB N="363" REF="356"/>
his conduct, exactly tallies with the idea which we naturally form of it. There is the most perfect correspondence between his sentiments and our own, and at the same time, from our experience of the common weakness of human nature, it is a correspondence which we could not rea∣sonably have expected. We not only ap∣prove, therefore, but in some measure ad∣mire his conduct, and think it worthy of a considerable degree of applause. It is the consciousness of this merited approbation and esteem which is alone capable of sup∣porting the agent in this tenor of conduct. The pleasure which we are to enjoy ten years hence interests us so little in comparison with that which we may enjoy to day, the passion which the first excites, is naturally so weak in comparison with that violent emotion which the second is apt to give occasion to, that the one could never be any balance to the other, unless it was supported by the sense of propriety, by the consciousness that we merited the esteem and approbation of every body, by acting in the one way, and that we became the proper objects of their contempt and derision by behaving in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="357"/>Humanity, justice, generosity and public spirit, are the qualities most useful to others. Wherein consists the propriety of humanity and justice has been explained upon a former occasion, where it was shewn how much our esteem and approbation of those qualities de∣pended upon the concord between the af∣fections of the agent and those of the spec∣tators.</P>
<P>The propriety of generosity and public spirit is founded upon the same principle with that of justice. Generosity is diffe∣rent from humanity. Those two qualities, which at first sight seem so nearly allied, do not always belong to the same person. Hu∣manity is the virtue of a woman, generosity of a man. The fair sex, who have com∣monly much more tenderness than ours, have seldom so much generosity. That women rarely make considerable donations is an ob∣servation of the civil law <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Raro mulieres donare solent.</NOTE>. Humanity consists merely in the exquisite fellow-feeling which the spectator entertains with the sentiments of the persons principally concerned so as to grieve for their sufferings, to resent their injuries, and rejoice at their good fortune.
<PB N="365" REF="358"/>
The most humane actions require no self-denial, no self-command, no great exertion of the sense of propriety. They consist on∣ly in doing what this exquisite sympathy would of its own accord prompt us to do. But it is otherways with generosity. We ne∣ver are generous except when in some respect we prefer some other person to ourselves, and sacrifice some great and important interest of our own to an equal interest of a friend or of a superior. The man who gives up his pretensions to an office that was the great object of his ambition, because, he imagines that the services of another are better entitled to it; the man who exposes his life to defend that of his friend, which he judges to be of more importance, neither of them act from huma∣nity, or because they feel more exquisitely what concerns that other person than what concerns themselves. They both consider those opposite interests not in the light in which they naturally appear to themselves, but in that in which they appear to others. To every bystander the success or preserva∣tion of this other person may justly be more interesting than their own, but it cannot be so to themselves. When to the interest of this other person, therefore, they sacrifice their
<PB N="366" REF="359"/>
own; they accommodate themselves to the sentiments of the spectator, and by an effort of magnanimity act according to those views of things which they feel, must naturally oc∣cur to any third person. The soldier who throws away his life in order to defend that of his officer, would perhaps be but little af∣fected by the death of that officer, if it should happen without any fault of his own, and a very small disaster which had befallen himself might excite a much more lively sor∣row. But when he endeavours to act so as to deserve applause, and to make the impar∣tial spectator enter into the principles of his conduct, he feels that to every body but him∣self his own life is a trifle compared with that of his officer, and that when he sacrifices the one to the other, he acts quite properly and agreeably to what would be the natural ap∣prehensions of every impartial bystander.</P>
<P>It is the same case with the greater exertions of public spirit. When a young officer exposes his life to acquire some inconsiderable addi∣tion to the dominions of his sovereign, it is not, because the acquisition of the new territory is to himself an object more desireable than the preservation of his own life. To him his own life is of infinitely more value than the
<PB N="367" REF="360"/>
conquest of a whole kingdom for the state which he serves. But when he compares those two objects with one another, he does not view them in the light, in which they naturally appear to himself, but in that, in which they appear to the nation he fights for. To them the success of the war is of the highest importance; the life of a private person of scarce any consequence. When he puts himself in their situation, he imme∣diately feels that he cannot be too prodigal of his blood, if by shedding it he can pro∣mote so valuable a purpose. In thus thwart∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng from a sense of duty and propriety, the strongest of all natural propensities, consists <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he heroism of his conduct. There is many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n honest Englishman, who in his private station would be more seriously disturbed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss of a guinea than by the national loss of Minorca, who yet, had it been in his power to defend that fortress, would have sacrificed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife a thousand times, rather than, through his fault, have let it fall into the hands of the enemy. When the first Brutus led forth his own sons to a capital punishment, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey had conspired against the rising liberty of Rome, he sacrificed what, if he had con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulted his own breast only, would appear to
<PB N="368" REF="361"/>
be the stronger to the weaker affection. Bru∣tus ought naturally to have felt much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the death of his own sons, than for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that probably Rome could have suffered fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the want of so great an example. But h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> viewed them, not with the eyes of a father, but with those of a Roman citizen. He en∣tered so thoroughly into the sentiments of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last character that he paid no regard to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tye, by which he himself was connected with them, and to a Roman citizen, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even of Brutus seemed contemptible, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put into the balance with the smallest inter∣est of Rome. In these and in all other ca∣ses of this kind, our admiration is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much founded upon the utility, as upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unexpected, and on that account the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ the noble and exalted propriety of such ac∣tions.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the Influence of custom and fashion upon our notions of beauty and deformity.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are other principles, besides those already enumerated, which have a considerable influence upon the moral sentiments of mankind, and are the chief causes of the many irregular and discordant opinions which prevail in different ages and nations concerning what is blameable or praise worthy. These principles are custom and fashion, principles which extend their domi∣nion over our judgments concerning beauty of every kind.</P>
<P>When two objects have frequently been seen together, the imagination acquires a ha∣bit of passing easily from the one to the other. If the first appears we lay our account that the second is to follow. Of their own ac∣cord
<PB N="372" REF="365" MS="y"/>
they put us in mind of one another, and the attention glides easily along them. Tho' independent of custom, there should be no real beauty in their union, yet when custom has thus connected them together, we feel an impropriety in their separation. The one we think is aukward when it appears without its usual companion. We miss something which we expected to find, and the habitual arangement of our ideas is disturbed by the disappointment. A suit of cloaths, for ex∣ample, seems to want something if they are without the most insignificant ornament which usually accompanies them, and we find a meanness or aukwardness in the ab∣sence even of a haunch button. When there is any natural propriety in the union, custom increases our sense of it, and makes a diffe∣rent arangement appear still more disagree∣able than it would otherwise seem to be. Those who have been accustomed to see things in a good taste are more disgusted by whatever is clumsy or aukward. Where the conjunction is improper, custom either diminishes or takes away altogether our sense of the impropriety. Those who have been accustomed to slo∣venly disorder lose all sense of neatness or elegance. The modes of furniture or dress
<PB N="373" REF="366"/>
which seem ridiculous to strangers give no offence to the people who are used to them.</P>
<P>Fashion is different from custom, or rather is a particular species of it. That is not the fashion which every body wears, but which those wear who are of a high rank, or cha∣racter. The graceful, the easy and com∣manding manners of the great, joined to the usual richness and magnificence of their dress, give a grace to the very form which they happen to bestow upon it. As long as they continue to use this form, it is connected in our imaginations with the idea of something that is genteel and magnificent, and tho' in itself it should be indifferent, it seems on ac∣count of this relation, to have something about it that is genteel and magnificent too. As soon as they drop it, it loses all the grace, which it had appeared to possess before, and being now used only by the inferior ranks of people, seems to have something of their meanness and aukwardness.</P>
<P>Dress and furniture are allowed by all the world to be entirely under the dominion of custom and fashion. The influence of those principles, however, is by no means con∣fined to so narrow a sphere, but extends it∣self to whatever is in any respect the object
<PB N="374" REF="367"/>
of taste to music, to poetry, to architec∣ture. The modes of dress and furniture are continually changing, and that fashion ap∣pearing ridiculous to-day which was admir∣ed five years ago, we are experimentally con∣vinced that it owed its vogue chiefly or en∣tirely to custom and fashion. Cloaths and furniture are not made of very durable ma∣terials. A well fancied coat is done in a twelve month, and cannot continue longer to propagate, as the fashion, that form ac∣cording to which it was made. The modes of furniture change less rapidly than those of dress; because furniture is commonly more durable, In five, or six years, however, it generally undergoes an entire revolution, and every man in his own time sees the fashion in this respect change many different ways. The productions of the other arts are much more lasting, and, when happily imagined, may continue to propagate the fashion of their make for a much longer time. A well contrived building may en∣dure many centuries: a beautiful air may be delivered down by a sort of tradition, thro' many successive generations: A well written poem may last as long as the world, and all of them continue for ages together, to
<PB N="375" REF="368"/>
give the vogue to that particular stile, to that particular taste or manner, according to which each of them was composed. Few men have an opportunity of seeing in their own times the fashion in any of these arts change very considerably. Few men have so much experience and acquaintance with the different modes which have obtained in remote ages and nations, as to be thoroughly reconciled to them, or to judge with impar∣tiality between them, and what takes place in their own age and country. Few men therefore are willing to allow that custom or fashion have much influence upon their judg∣ments concerning what is beautiful, or other∣wise, in the productions of any of those arts; but imagine, that all the rules, which they think ought to be observed in each of them, are founded upon reason and nature, not upon habit or prejudice. A very little at∣tention, however, may convince them of the contrary, and satisfy them that the influ∣ence of custom and fashion over dress and furniture is not more absolute than over ar∣chitecture, poetry, and music.</P>
<P>Can any reason, for example, be assigned why the Doric capital should be appropriated to a pillar, whose height is equal to eight dia∣meters;
<PB N="376" REF="369"/>
the Jonic volute to one of nine▪ and the Corinthian foliage to one of ten? The propriety of each of those appropriations can be founded upon nothing but habit and cus∣tom. The eye having been used to see a particular proportion connected with a parti∣cular ornament, would be offended if they were not joined together. Each of the five orders has its peculiar ornaments, which can∣not be changed for any other, without giving offence to all those who know any thing of the rules of architecture. According to some architects, indeed, such is the exquisite judg∣ment with which the antients have assigned to each order its proper ornaments, that no others can be found which are equally suit∣able. It seems, however, a little difficult to be conceived that these forms, tho' no doubt extremely agreeable, should be the only forms which can suit those proportions, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that there should not be five hundred others which, antecedent to established custom, would have fitted them equally well. When custom, however, has established particular rules of building, provided they are not ab∣solutely unreasonable, it is absurd to think of altering them for others which are only equally good, or even for others which, in
<PB N="377" REF="370"/>
point of elegance and beauty, have natu∣rally some little advantage over them. A man would be ridiculous who should appear in public with a suit of cloaths quite different from those which are commonly worn, tho' the new dress should in itself be ever so graceful or convenient. And there seems to be an absurdity of the same kind in orna∣menting a house after a quite different man∣ner from that which custom and fashion have prescribed; tho' the new ornaments should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n themselves be somewhat superior to the common ones.</P>
<P>According to the antient rhetoricians a cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain measure of verse was by nature appro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riated to each particular species of writing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s being naturally expressive of that charac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, sentiment or passion, which ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>redominate in it. One verse, they said, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for grave and another for gay works, which could not, they thought, be inter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hanged without the greatest impropriety. The experience of modern times, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eems to contradict this principle, tho' in it∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf it would appear to be extremely pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able. What is the burlesque verse in eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh is the heroic verse in French. The tra∣gedies
<PB N="378" REF="371"/>
of Racine and the Henriad of Vol∣taire, are in the same verse with
<Q>Thus said to my lady the knight full of care.</Q>
The burlesque verse in French, on the con∣trary is pretty much the same with the heroic verse of ten syllables in English. Cus∣tom has made the one nation associate the ideas of gravity, sublimity and seriousness, to that measure which the other has connected with whatever is gay, flippant and ludicrous. Nothing would appear more absurd in Eng∣lish than a tragedy written in the Alexandri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> verses of the French; or in French, than a work of the same kind in verses of ten syl∣lables.</P>
<P>An eminent artist will bring about a con∣siderable change in the established modes of each of those arts, and introduce a new fashion of writing, music, or architecture. As the dress of an agreeable man of high rank recommends itself, and how peculiar and fantastical soever, comes soon to be ad∣mired and imitated; so the excellencies of an eminent master recommend his peculia∣rities, and his manner becomes the fashion∣able stile in the art which he practises. The taste of the Italians in music and architecture has, within these fifty years, undergone a con∣siderable
<PB N="379" REF="372"/>
change, from imitating the peculia∣rities of some eminent masters in each of those arts. Seneca is accused by Quintilian of having corrupted the taste of the Romans, and of having introduced a frivolous pretti∣ness in the room of majestic reason and mas∣culine eloquence. Sallust and Tacitus have by others been charged with the same accu∣sation, tho' in a different manner. They gave reputation it is pretended to a stile, which tho' in the highest degree concise, ele∣gant, expressive, and even poetical, wanted, however, ease, simplicity, and nature, and was evidently the production of the most la∣boured and studied affectation. How many great qualities must that writer possess who can thus render his very faults agreeable? After the praise of refining the taste of a na∣tion, the highest eulogy, perhaps, which can be bestowed upon any author is to say, that he corrupted it. In our own language, Mr. Pope and Dr. Swift have each of them introduced a manner different from what was practised before, into all works that are written in Rhyme, the one in long verses, the other in short. The quaintness of Butler has given place to the plainness of Swift. The rambling freedom of Dryden,
<PB N="380" REF="373"/>
and the correct but often tedious and prosaic languor of Addison are no longer the objects of imitation, but all long verses are now writ∣ten after the manner of the nervous precision of Mr. Pope.</P>
<P>Neither is it only over the productions of the arts, that custom and fashion exert their dominion. They influence our judgments, in the same manner, with regard to the beauty of natural objects. What various and op∣posite forms are deemed beautiful in different species of things? The proportions which are admired in one animal, are altogether different from those which are esteemed in another. Every class of things has its own peculiar conformation, which is approved of, and has a beauty of its own, distinct from that of every other species. It is upon this account that a learned Jesuit, father Buffier, has determined that the beauty of every object consists in that form and colour, which is most usual among things of that particular sort to which it belongs. Thus, in the human form, the beauty of each fea∣ture lies in a certain middle equally removed from a variety of other forms that are ugly. A beautiful nose, for example, is one that is neither very long, nor very short, neither
<PB N="381" REF="374"/>
very streight, nor very crooked, but a sort of middle among all these extremes, and less different from any one of them, than all of them are from one another. It is the form which nature seems to have aimed at in them all, which, however, she deviates from in a great variety of ways▪ and very seldom hits ex∣actly; but to which all those deviations still bear a very strong resemblance. When a number of drawings are made after one pat∣tern, tho' they may all miss it in some re∣spects, yet they will all resemble it more than they resemble one another; the general cha∣racter of the pattern will run through them all; the most singular and odd will be those that are most wide of it; and tho' very few will copy it exactly, yet the most accurate delineations will bear a greater resemblance to the most careless, than the careless ones will bear to one another. In the same man∣ner in each species of creatures, what is most beautiful bears the strongest characters of the general fabric of the species, and has the strongest resemblance to the greater part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he individuals with which it is classed. Mon∣sters, on the contrary, or what is perfectly deformed, are always most singular and odd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd have the least resemblance to the genera∣lity
<PB N="382" REF="375"/>
of that species to which they belong. And thus the beauty of each species, though in one sense the rarest of all things, because few individuals hit this middle form exactly, yet in another, is the most common, because all the deviations from it resemble it more than they resemble one another. The most customary form, therefore, is in each species of things, according to him, the most beau∣tiful. And hence it is that a certain practice and experience in contemplating each species of objects is requisite, before we can judge of its beauty, or know wherein the middle and most usual form consists. The nicest judg∣ment concerning the beauty of the human species, will not help us to judge of that of flowers, or horses, or any other species of things. It is for the same reason that in dif∣ferent climates and where different customs and ways of living take place, as the genera∣lity of any species receives a different confor∣mation from those circumstances, so different ideas of its beauty prevail. The beauty of a moorish is not exactly the same with that of an English horse. What different ideas are formed in different nations concerning the beauty of the human shape and countenance? A fair complexion is a shocking deformity
<PB N="383" REF="376"/>
upon the coast of Guinea. Thick lips and a flat nose are a beauty. In some nations long ears that hang down upon the shoulders are the objects of universal admiration. In Chi∣na if a lady's foot is so large as to be fit to walk upon, she is regarded as a monster of uggliness. Some of the savage nations in North-America tie four boards round the heads of their children, and thus squeeze them, while the bones are tender and gristly, into a form that is almost perfectly square. Euro∣peans are astonished at the absurd barbarity of this practice, to which some missionaries have imputed the singular stupidity of those nations among whom it prevails. But when they condemn those savages they do not re∣flect that the ladies in Europe had, till with∣in these very few years, been endeavouring for near a century past, to squeeze the beau∣tiful roundness of their natural shape into a square form of the same kind. And that notwithstanding the many distortions and di∣seases which this practice was known to oc∣casion, custom had rendered it agreeable among some of the most civilized nations which, perhaps, the world ever beheld.</P>
<P>Such is the system of this learned and in∣genious father, concerning the nature of
<PB N="384" REF="377"/>
beauty; of which the whole charm, accord∣ing to him, would thus seem to arise from its falling in with the habits which custom had impressed upon the imagination, with re∣gard to things of each particular kind. I cannot, however, be induced to believe that our sense even of external beauty is founded altogether on custom. The utility of any form, its fitness for the useful purposes for which it was intended, evidently recom∣mends it, and renders it agreeable to us inde∣pendent of custom. Certain colours are more agreeable than others, and give more delight to the eye even the first time it ever beholds them. A smooth surface is more agreeable than a rough one. Variety is more pleasing than a tedious undiversified uniformity. Connected variety, in which each new ap∣pearance seems to be introduced by what went before it, and in which all the ad∣joining parts seem to have some natural relation to one another, is more agreeable than a disjointed and disorderly assemblage of un∣connected objects. But tho' I cannot ad∣mit that custom is the sole principle of beauty, yet I can so far allow the truth of this ingenious system as to grant, that there is scarce any one external form so
<PB N="385" REF="378"/>
beautiful as to please if quite contrary to cus∣tom and unlike whatever we have been used to in that particular species of things: Or so deformed as not to be agreeable, if custom uniformly supports it, and habituates us to see it in every single individual of the kind.</P>

Their i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fluence here, however, seems to be muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less than it is every where else. There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perhaps, no form of external objects, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> absurd and fantastical soever, to which custo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will not reconcile us, or which fashion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not render even agreeable.

<PB N="387" REF="380"/>
but the one will always be the object of dread and hatred; the other of scorn and derision. The principles of the imagination▪ upon which our sense of beauty depends, are of a very nice and delicate nature, and may easily be altered by habit and education: But the sentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation, are founded on the strongest and most vigorous passions of human nature; and tho' they may be somewhat warpt, can∣not be entirely perverted.</P>
<P>But though the influence of custom and fashion, upon moral sentiments, is not alto∣gether so great, it is however perfectly simi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar to what it is every where else. When custom and fashion coincide with the natural principles of right and wrong, they heighten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he delicacy of our sentiments, and increase our abhorrence for every thing that approach∣es to evil. Those who have been educated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n what is really good company, not in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s commonly called such, who have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccustomed to see nothing in the persons whom they esteemed and lived with, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice, modesty, humanity, and good order; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re more shocked with whatever seems to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nconsistent with the rules which those vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues prescribe. Those on the contrary, who
<PB N="388" REF="381"/>
have had the misfortune to be brought up amidst violence, licentiousness, falshood and injustice; lose, though not all sense of the impropriety of such conduct, yet all sense of its dreadful enormity, and of the vengeance and punishment that is due to it. They have been familiarized with it from their infancy, custom has rendered it habitual to them, and they are very apt to regard it as what is call∣ed the way of the world, something which either may or must be practiced to hinder us from being the dupes of our own integrity.</P>
<P>Fashion too, will sometimes give reputa∣tion to a certain degree of disorder, and on the contrary, discountenance qualities which deserve esteem. In the reign of Charles II. a degree of licentiousness was deemed the characteristic of a liberal education. It was connected, according to the notions of those times, with generosity, sincerity, magnani∣mity, loyalty, and proved that the person who acted in this manner, was a gentleman, and not a puritan; severity of manners, and regularity of conduct, on the other hand, were altogether unfashionable, and were con∣nected, in the imagination of that age, with cant, cunning, hypocrisy, and low manners. To superficial minds, the vices of the great
<PB N="389" REF="382"/>
seem at all times agreeable. They connect them, not only with the splendour of for∣tune, but with many superior virtues, which they ascribe to their superiors; with the spi∣rit of freedom and independency, with frankness, generosity, humanity and polite∣ness. The virtues of the inferior ranks of people, on the contrary, their parsimonious frugality, their painful industry, and rigid adherence to rules, seem to them mean and disagreeable. They connect them, both with the meanness of the station to which those qualities commonly belong, and with many great vices, which, they suppose, usually ac∣company them; such as an abject, coward∣ly, ill-natured, lying, pilfering disposition.</P>
<P>The objects with which men in the differ∣ent professions and states of life are con∣versant, being very different, and habituating them to very different passions, naturally form in them very different characters and manners. We expect in each rank and pro∣fession, a degree of those manners, which, experience has taught us, belong to it. But as in each species of things, we are par∣ticularly pleased with the middle confor∣mation, which in every part and feature agrees most exactly with the general stan∣dard
<PB N="390" REF="383"/>
that nature seems to have established for things of that kind; so in each rank, or, if I may say so, in each species of men, we are particularly pleased, if they have nei∣ther too much, nor too little of the charac∣ter which usually accompanies their parti∣cular condition and situation. A man, we say, should look like his trade and profes∣sion; yet the pedantry of every profession is disagreeable. The different periods of life have, for the same reason, different man∣ners assigned to them. We expect in old age, that gravity and sedateness which its in∣firmities, its long experience, and its wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out sensibility seem to render both natural and respectable; and we lay our account to find in youth that sensibility, that gaiety and sprightly vivacity which experience teaches us to expect from the lively impressions that all interesting objects are apt to make upon the tender and unpracticed senses of that early period of life. Each of those two ages, however, may easily have too much of the peculiarities which belong to it. The flirting levity of youth, and the immovable insensibility of old age, are equally disagreea∣ble. The young, according to the common saying, are most agreeable when in their be∣haviour
<PB N="391" REF="384"/>
there is something of the manners of the old, and the old, when they retain something of the gaiety of the young. Ei∣ther of them, however, may easily have too much of the manners of the other. The ex∣treme coldness, and dull formality, which are pardoned in old age, make youth ridi∣culous. The levity, the carelessness, and the vanity, which are indulged in youth, render old age contemptible.</P>
<P>The peculiar character and manners which we are led by custom to appropriate to each rank and profession, have sometimes perhaps a propriety independent of custom; and are what we should approve of for their own sakes, if we took into consideration all the different circumstances which naturally affect those in each different state of life. The propriety of a person's behaviour, de∣pends not upon its suitableness to any one circumstance of his situation, but to all the circumstances, which, when we bring his case home to ourselves we feel, should na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urally call upon his attention.

entirely go along with, because not per∣fectly adjusted to all the circumstances of his situation: yet, perhaps, the emotion he ex∣presses for the object which principally in∣terests him, does not exceed what we should entirely sympathize with, and approve of, in one whose attention was not required by any other thing. A parent in private life might, upon the loss of an only son, express without blame, a degree of grief and tenderness, which would be unpardonable in a general at the head of an army, when glory, and the public safety, demanded so great a part of his attention. As different objects ought, upon common occasions, to occupy the attention of men of different professions, so different passions ought naturally to become habitual to them; and when we bring home to ourselves their situation in this particular respect, we must be sensible, that every occurrence should naturally affect them more or less, ac∣cording as the emotion which it excites, co∣incides or disagrees with the fixt habit and temper of their minds. We cannot expect the same sensibility to the gay pleasures and amusements of life in a clergyman which we lay our account with in an officer. The man, whose peculiar occupation it is to keep
<PB N="393" REF="386"/>
the world in mind of that awful futurity which awaits them, who is to anounce what may be the fatal consequences of every devia∣tion from the rules of duty, and who is him∣self to set the example of the most exact con∣formity, is the messenger of tidings, which cannot, in propriety, be delivered either with levity or indifference. His mind is continu∣ally occupied with what is too grand and solemn, to leave any room for the impres∣sions of those frivolous objects, which fill up the attention of the dissipated and the gay. We readily feel therefore, that, inde∣pendent of custom, there is a propriety in the manners which custom has allotted to this profession; and that nothing can be more suitable to the character of a clergyman, than that grave, that austere and abstracted seve∣rity, which we are habituated to expect in his behaviour. These reflections are so very obvious, that there is scarce any man so in∣considerate, as not, at some time, to have made them, and to have accounted to him∣self in this manner for his approbation of the usual character of this order.</P>
<P>The foundation of the customary charac∣ter of some other professions is not so obvious, and our approbation of it is founded entirely
<PB N="394" REF="387"/>
in habit, without being either confirmed, or enlivened by any reflections of this kind. We are led by custom, for example, to an∣nex the character of gaiety, levity, and sprightly freedom, as well as of some degree of dissipation, to the military profession: yet, if we were to consider what mood or tone of temper would be most suitable to this situa∣tion, we should be apt to determine, per∣haps, that the most serious and thoughtful turn of mind, would best become these whose lives are continually exposed to un∣common danger; and who should therefore be more constantly occupied with the thoughts of death and its consequences than other men. It is this very circumstance, however, which is not improbably the occa∣sion why the contrary turn of mind prevail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so much among men of this profession. It requires so great an effort to conquer the fear of death, when we survey it with steadiness and attention, that those who are constantly exposed to it, find it easier to turn away their thoughts from it altogether, to wrap them∣selves up in careless security and indifference, and to plunge themselves, for this purpose, into every sort of amusement and dissipation▪ A camp is not the element of a thoughtful
<PB N="395" REF="388"/>
or a melancholy man: persons of that cast, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed, are often abundantly determined, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd are capable, by a great effort, of going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n with inflexible resolution to the most un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>voidable death. But to be exposed to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inual, though less imminent danger, to be obliged to exert, for a long time, a degree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this effort, exhausts and depresses the mind, and renders it incapable of all happi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess and enjoyment. The gay and careless, who have occasion to make no effort at all, who fairly resolve never to look before them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut to lose in continual pleasures and amuse∣ments, all anxiety about their situation, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asily support such circumstances. Whenever, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y any peculiar circumstances, an officer has no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason to lay his account with being exposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o any uncommon danger, he is very apt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose the gaiety and dissipated thoughtlesness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his character. The captain of a city guard a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commonly as sober, careful, and penurious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n animal as the rest of his fellow citizens. A long peace is, for the same reason, very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt to diminish the difference between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivil and the military character. The ordi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary situation, however, of men of this pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession, renders gaiety, and a degree of dissi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, so much their usual character; and
<PB N="396" REF="389"/>
custom has, in our imagination, so strongly connected this character with this state of life, that we are very apt to despise any man, whose peculiar humour or situation, renders him incapable of acquiring it. We laugh at the grave and careful faces of a city guard, which so little resemble those of their pro∣fession. They themselves seem often to be ashamed of the regularity of their own man∣ners, and, not to be out of the fashion of their trade, are fond of affecting that levity, which is by no means natural to them. What∣ever is the deportment which we have been accustomed to see in a respectable order of men, it comes to be so associated in our ima∣gination with that order, that whenever we see the one, we lay our account that we are to meet with the other, and when disappoint∣ed, miss something which we expected to find. We are embarassed, and put to a stand, and know not how to address ourselves to a character, which plainly affects to be of a different species from those with which we should have been disposed to class it.</P>
<P>The different situations of different ages and countries, are apt in the same manner, to give different characters to the generality of those who live in them, and their senti∣ments
<PB N="397" REF="390"/>
concerning the particular degree of each quality, that is either blameable, or praise-worthy, vary according to that degree, which is usual in their own country, and in their own times. That degree of politeness, which would be highly esteemed, perhaps would be thought effeminate adulation, in Russia, would be regarded as rudeness and barbarism at the court of France. That de∣gree of order and frugality, which, in a Polish nobleman would be considered as excessive parsimony, would be regarded as extravagance in a citizen of Amsterdam. Every age and country look upon that degree of each qua∣lity, which is commonly to be met with in those who are esteemed among themselves, as the golden mean of that particular talent or virtue. And as this varies according as their different circumstances render different qualities more or less habitual to them, their sentiments concerning the exact propriety of character and behaviour vary accordingly.</P>
<P>Among civilized nations, the virtues which are founded upon humanity, are more cultivated than those which are founded upon self-denial and the com∣mand of the passions. Among rude and barbarous nations, it is quite otherwise, the virtues of self-denial are more cultivated than
<PB N="398" REF="391"/>
those of humanity. The general security and happiness which prevail in ages of civi∣lity and politeness afford little exercise to the contempt of danger, to patience in enduring labour, hunger, and pain. Poverty may ea∣sily be avoided, and the contempt of it, therefore, almost ceases to be a virtue. The abstinence from pleasure, becomes less ne∣cessary, and the mind is more at liberty to un∣bend itself, and to indulge its natural incli∣nations in all those particular respects.</P>
<P>Among savages and barbarians it is quite otherwise. Every savage undergoes a sort of Spartan discipline, and by the necessity of his situation is inured to every sort of hard∣ship. He is in continual danger: He is often exposed to the greatest extremities of hun∣ger, and frequently dies of pure want. His circumstances not only habituate him to eve∣ry sort of distress, but teach him to give way to none of the passions which that distress is apt to excite. He can expect from his coun∣trymen no sympathy or indulgence for such weakness. Before we can feel much for o∣thers, we must in some measure be at ease ourselves. If our own misery pinches us very severely, we have no leisure to attend to that of our neighbour: And all savages are too much occupied with their own wants
<PB N="399" REF="392"/>
and necessities, to give much attention to those of another person. A savage, there∣fore, whatever be the nature of his distress, expects no sympathy from those about him, and disdains, upon that account, to expose himself, by allowing the least weakness to escape him. His passions, how furious and violent soever, are never permitted to disturb the serenity of his countenance or the com∣posure of his conduct and behaviour. The savages in North America, we are told, as∣sume upon all occasions the greatest indiffer∣ence, and would think themselves degraded if they should ever appear in any respect to be overcome, either by love or grief, or re∣sentment. Their magnanimity and self-com∣mand, in this respect, are almost beyond the conception of Europeans. In a country in which all men are upon a level, with regard to rank and fortune, it might be expected that the mutual inclinations of the two par∣ties should be the only thing considered in marriages, and should be indulged without any sort of controul. This, however, is the country in which all marriages without ex∣ception are made up by the parents, and in which a young man would think himself disgraced for ever, if he shewed the least
<PB N="400" REF="393"/>
preference of one woman above another, or did not express the most compleat indiffer∣ence, both about the time when, and the person to whom he was to be married. The weakness of love, which is so much indulg∣ed in ages of humanity and politeness, is re∣garded among savages as the most unpardon∣able effeminacy. Even after the marriage the two parties seem to be ashamed of a connection which is founded upon so sordid a necessity. They do not live together. They see one another by stealth only. They both continue to dwell in the house of their re∣spective fathers, and the open cohabitation of the two sexes, which is permitted with∣out blame in all other countries, is here con∣sidered as the most indecent and unmanly sensuality. Nor is it only over this agreeable passion that they exert this absolute self-com∣mand. They often bear in the fight of all their countrymen with injuries, reproach, and the grossest insults with the appearance of the greatest insensibility, and without expressing the smallest resentment. When a savage is made prisoner of war, and receives, as is usual, the sentence of death from his con∣querors, he hears it without expressing any
<PB N="401" REF="394"/>
emotion, and afterwards submits to the most dreadful torments, without ever bemoaning himself, or discovering any other passion but contempt of his enemies. While he is hung by the shoulders over a slow fire, he derides his tormentors, and tells them with how much more ingenuity, he himself had tor∣mented such of their countrymen as had fallen into his hands. After he has been scorched and burnt, and lacerated in all the most tender and sensible parts of his body for several hours together, he is often allow∣ed, in order to prolong his misery, a short respite, and is taken down from the stake: he employs this interval in talking upon all indifferent subjects, inquires after the news of the country, and seems indifferent about nothing but his own situation. The spec∣tators express the same insensibility; the sight of so horrible an object seems to make no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpression upon them; they scarce look at the prisoner, except when they lend a hand to torment him. At other times they smoke tobacco, and amuse themselves with any common object, as if no such matter was go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng on. Every savage is said to prepare him∣self from his earliest youth for the dreadful end. He composes, for this purpose, what
<PB N="402" REF="395"/>
they call the song of death, a song which he is to sing when he has fallen into the hands of his enemies, and is expiring under the tor∣tures which they inflict upon him. It con∣sists of insults upon his tormentors, and ex∣presses the highest contempt of death and pain. He sings this song upon all extraordinary oc∣casions, when he goes out to war, when he meets his enemies in the field, or whenever he has a mind to show that he has familiarised his imagination, to the most dreadful misfor∣tunes, and that no human event can daunt his resolution, or alter his purpose. The same contempt of death and torture prevails among all other savage nations. There is not a negro from the coast of Africa who does not, in this respect, possess a degree of mag∣nanimity which the soul of his sordid master is scarce capable of conceiving. Fortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when she subjected those na∣tions of heroes to the refuse of the jails of Europe, to wretches who possess the virtues neither of the countries which they come from, nor of those which they go to, and whose levity, brutality and baseness, so justly expose them to the contempt of the van∣quished.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="396" MS="y"/>This heroic and unconquerable firmness which the custom and education of his coun∣try demand of every savage, is not required of those who are brought up to live in civi∣lized societies. If these last complain when they are in pain, if they grieve when they are in distress, if they allow themselves either to be overcome by love, or to be discomposed by anger, they are easily pardoned. Such weaknesses are not apprehended to affect the essential parts of their character. As long as they do not allow themselves to be trans∣ported to do any thing contrary to justice or humanity, they lose but little reputation, tho' the serenity of their countenance or the com∣posure of their discourse and behaviour should be somewhat ruffled and disturbed. A hu∣mane and polished people, who have more sensibility to the passions of others, can more readily enter into an animated and passionate behaviour, and can more easily pardon some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle excess. The person principally con∣cerned is sensible of this; and being as∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured of the equity of his judges, indulges himself in stronger expressions of pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, and is less afraid of exposing himself to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir contempt by the violence of his emo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions. We can venture to express more emo∣tion
<PB N="404" REF="397"/>
in the presence of a friend than in that of a stranger, because we expect more indul∣gence from the one than from the other. And in the same manner the rules of decorum among civilized nations, admit of a more ani∣mated behaviour than is approved of among barbarians. The first converse together with the openness of friends; the second with the reserve of strangers. The emotion and viva∣city with which the French and Italians, the two most polished nations upon the conti∣nent, express themselves on occasions that are at all interesting, surprize at first those stran∣gers who happen to be travelling among them, and who having been educated among a people of duller sensibility, cannot enter into this pas∣sionate behaviour, of which they have never seen any examples in their own country. A young French nobleman will weep in the presence of the whole court upon being re∣fused a regiment. An Italian, says the abbot Dû Bos, expresses more emotion upon being condemned in a fine of twenty shillings than an Englishman upon receiving the sentence of death. Cicero, in the times of the highest Roman politeness, could, without degrading himself, weep with all the bitterness of sor∣row in the sight of the whole senate and the
<PB N="405" REF="398"/>
whole people; as it is evident he must have done in the end of almost every oration. The orators of the earlier and ruder ages of Rome could not probably, consistent with the man∣ners of the times, have expressed themselves with so much emotion. It would have been re∣garded, I suppose, as a violation of nature and propriety in the Scipio's, in the Lelius's, and in the elder Cato, to have exposed so much ten∣derness to the view of the public. Those antient warriors could express themselves, with order, gravity and good judgment, but are said to have been strangers to that sublime and passionate eloquence which was first in∣troduced into Rome, not many years before the birth of Cicero, by the two Gracchi, by Crassus and by Sulpitius. This animated elo∣quence, which has been long practised, with or without success, both in France and Italy, is but just beginning to be introduced into England. So wide is the difference between the degrees of self-command which are re∣quired in civilized and in barbarous nations. And by such different standards do they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udge of the propriety of behaviour.</P>
<P>This difference gives occasion to many others that are not less essential. A polished people being accustomed to give way in some mea∣sure
<PB N="406" REF="399"/>
to the movements of nature, become frank; open and sincere. Barbarians, on the contrary, being obliged to smother and con∣ceal the appearance of every passion, neces∣sarily acquire the habits of falshood and dis∣simulation. It is observed by all those who have been conversant with savage nations whether in Asia, Africa, or America, that they are all equally impenetrable, and that when they have a mind to conceal the truth, no examination is capable of drawing it from them. They cannot be trepanned by the most artful questions. The torture itself is incapable of making them confess any thing which they have no mind to tell. The pas∣sions of a savage too, tho' they never express themselves by any outward emotion, but lye concealed in the breast of the sufferer, are, notwithstanding, all mounted to the highest pitch of fury. Tho' he seldom shows any symptoms of anger, yet his vengeance, when he comes to give way to it, is always sangui∣nary and dreadful. The least affront drives him to despair. His countenance and dis∣course indeed are still sober and composed, and express nothing but the most perfect tran∣quility of mind: But his actions are often the most furious and violent. Among the
<PB N="407" REF="400"/>
North-Americans it is not uncommon for persons of the tenderest age and more fearful sex to drown themselves upon receiving only a slight reprimand from their mothers, and this too without expressing any passion or saving any thing, except <HI>you shall no longer have a daughter.</HI> In civilized nations the passions of men are not commonly so furious or so desperate. They are often clamorous and noisy, but are seldom very hurtful; and seem frequently to aim at no other satisfac∣tion but that of convincing the spectator, that they are in the right to be so much moved, and of procuring his sympathy and appro∣bation.</P>
<P>All these effects of custom and fashion, however, upon the moral sentiments of mankind, are inconsiderable in comparison of those which they give occasion to in some other cases; and it is not concerning the general stile of character and behaviour, that those principles produce the greatest perversion of judgment, but concerning the propriety or impropriety of particular usages.</P>
<P>The different manners which custom teaches us to approve of in the different pro∣fessions and states of life, do not concern things of the greatest importance. We ex∣pect
<PB N="408" REF="401"/>
truth and justice from an old man as well as from a young, from a clergyman as well as from an officer; and it is in matters of smaller moment only that we look for the distinguishing marks of their respective cha∣racters. With regard to these too, there is often some unobserved circumstance which, if it was attended to, would show us that, independent of custom, there was a propriety in the character which custom had taught us to allot to each profession. We cannot complain, therefore, in this case, that the perversion of natural sentiment is very great. Tho' the manners of different nations re∣quire different degrees of the same quality, in the character which they think worthy of esteem, yet the worst that can be said to happen even here, is that the duties of one virtue are sometimes extended so as to en∣croach a little upon the precincts of some other. The rustic hospitality that is in fashion among the Poles encroaches, per∣haps, a little upon oeconomy and good or∣der; and the frugality that is esteemed in Holland, upon generosity and good-fellowship. The hardiness demanded of savages diminishes their humanity; and perhaps the delicate sensibility required in civilized nations some∣times
<PB N="409" REF="402"/>
destroys, the masculine firmness of the character. In general the stile of manners which takes place in any nation, may commonly upon the whole be said to be that which is most suitable to its situation. Hardiness is the character most suitable to the circumstances of a savage; sensibility to those of one who lives in a very civilized society. Even here, therefore, we cannot complain that the mo∣ral sentiments of men are very grossly per∣verted.</P>
<P>It is not therefore in the general stile of conduct or behaviour that custom authorizes the widest departure from what is the natural propriety of action. With regard to parti∣cular usages its influence is often much more destructive of good morals, and it is capable of establishing as lawful and blameless parti∣cular actions which shock the plainest princi∣ples of right and wrong.</P>
<P>Can there be greater barbarity, for exam∣ple, than to hurt an infant? it's helplessness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's innocence, it's amiableness, call forth the compassion, even of an enemy, and not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pare that tender age is regarded as the most furious effort of an enraged and cruel con∣queror. What then should we imagine, must
<PB N="410" REF="403"/>
be the heart of a parent who could injure that weakness which even a furious enemy is afraid to violate? yet the exposition, that is, the murder of new born infants, was a prac∣tice allowed of in almost all the states of Greece even among the polite and civilized Atheni∣ans, and whenever the circumstances of the parent rendered it inconvenient to bring up the child, to abandon it to hunger, or to wild beasts, was regarded without blame or censure. This practice had probably begun in times of the most savage barbarity. The imagination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of men had been first made familiar with it in that earliest period of society, and the uniform continuance of the custom had hin∣dered them afterwards from perceiving it's enormity. We find, at this day, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> practice prevails among all savage nations; and in that rudest and lowest state of society <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is undoubtedly more pardonable than in any other. The extreme indigence of a savage is often such that he himself is frequently ex∣posed to the greatest extremity of hunger, he often dies of pure want, and it is frequently impossible for him to support both himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and his child. We cannot wonder, therefore that in this case he should abandon it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who in flying from an enemy whom it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="411" REF="404"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpossible to resist, should throw down his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfant because it retarded his flight, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urely be excusable; since by attempting to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave it he could only hope for the consolation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f dying along with it. That in this state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ociety, therefore, a parent should be allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o judge whether he can bring up his child, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught not to surprize us so greatly. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter ages of Greece, however, the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing was permitted from views of remote in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest or conveniency which could by no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eans excuse it. Uninterrupted custom had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y this time so thoroughly authorized the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ractice, that not only the loose maxims of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he world tollerated this barbarous preroga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve, but even the doctrine of philosophers, which ought to have been more just and ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urate, was led away by the established cus∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om, and upon this as upon many other occa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, instead of censuring, supported the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrible abuse by far fetched considerations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ublick utility. Aristotle talks of it as of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the magistrate ought upon many occa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons to encourage. The humane Plato is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same opinion, and, with all that love of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ankind which seems to animate all his writ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs, no where marks this practice with dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>probation. When custom can give sancti∣on
<PB N="412" REF="405"/>
to so dreadful a violation of humanity, we may well imagine that there is scarce any par∣ticular practice so gross which it cannot au∣thorize. Such a thing, we hear men every day saying, is commonly done, and they seem to think this a sufficient apology for what in itself is the most unjust and unreasonable con∣duct.</P>
<P>There is an obvious reason why custom should never pervert our sentiments with re∣gard to the general stile and character of con∣duct and behaviour, in the same degree as with regard to the propriety or unlawfullness of particular usages. There never can be any such custom. No society could subsist a mo∣ment in which the usual strain of mens con∣duct and behaviour was of a piece with the horrible practice I just now mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>PART VII. Of Systems of MORAL PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the questions which ought to be exami∣ned in a theory of moral sentiments.</HEAD>
<P>IF we examine the most celebrated and re∣markable of the different theories which have been given concerning the nature and origin of our moral sentiments, we shall find that almost all of them coincide with some part or other of that which I have been en∣deavouring to give an account of; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f every thing which has already been said be fully considered, we shall be at no loss to ex∣plain what was the view or aspect of nature which led each particular author to form his particular system. From some one or other of those principles which I have been endea∣vouring to unfold, every system of morality that ever had any reputation in the world has, perhaps, ultimately been derived. As they are all of them, in this respect founded
<PB N="414" REF="407"/>
upon natural principles, they are all of them in some measure in the right. But as many of them are derived from a partial and imper∣fect view of nature, there are many of them too in some respects in the wrong.</P>
<P>In treating of the principles of morals there are two questions to be considered. First, wherein does virtue consist; or what is the tone of temper, and tenor of conduct, which constitutes the excellent and praise-worthy character, the character which is the natural object of esteem, honour and approbation? and secondly, by what power or faculty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mind is it, that this character whatever it be, is recommended to us? or in other words, how and by what means does it come to pass, that the mind prefers one tenor of conduct to another, denominates the one right and the other wrong; considers the one as the object of approbation, honour and re∣ward, and the other of blame, censure and punishment?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the different accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE different accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue, or of the temper of mind which constitutes the excellent and praise-worthy character, may be reduced to three different classes. Ac∣cording to some, the virtuous temper of mind does not consist in any one species of affections, but in the proper government and direction of all our affections, which may be either virtuous or vitious according to the ob∣jects which they pursue, and the degree of violence with which they pursue them. Ac∣cording to these authors, therefore, virtue consists in propriety.</P>
<P>According to others, virtue consists in the judicious pursuit of our own private interest and happiness, or in the proper government and direction of those selfish affections which aim solely at this end. In the opinion of these
<PB N="417" REF="410"/>
authors, therefore virtue consists in pru∣dence.</P>
<P>Another set of authors make virtue consist in those affections only which aim at the happiness of others, not in those which aim at our own. According to them, therefore, disinterested benevolence is the only motive which can stamp upon any action the cha∣racter of virtue.</P>
<P>The character of virtue, it is evident, must either be ascribed indifferently to all our af∣fections when under proper government and direction, or it must be confined to some one class or division of them. The great divi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of our affections is into the selfish and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he benevolent. If the character of virtue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore cannot be ascribed indifferently to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll our affections when under proper govern∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent and direction, it must be confined either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o those which aim directly at our own pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate happiness, or to those which aim di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly at that of others. If virtue, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes not consist in propriety, it must consist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither in prudence or in benevolence. Be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>des these three, it is scarce possible to ima∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine that any other account can be given of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he nature of virtue. I shall endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hereafter how all the other accounts,
<PB N="418" REF="411"/>
which are seemingly different from any of these, coincide at bottom with some one or other of them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of those systems which make virtue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in propriety.</HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to Plato, to Ari∣stotle and to Zeno, virtue consists in the propriety of conduct, or in the suitable∣ness of the affection from which we act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the object which excites it.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the system of Plato <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Plato de rep. lib 4.</NOTE> the soul is con∣sidered as something like a little state or re∣publick, composed of three different facul∣ties or orders.</P>
<P>The first is the judging faculty, the faculty which determines not only what are the pro∣per means for attaining any end, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what ends are fit to be pursued, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> degree of relative value we ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon each. This faculty Plato called, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is very properly called, reason, and cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dered it as what had a right to be the govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
<PB N="419" REF="412"/>
principle of the whole. Under this ap∣pellation, it is evident, he comprehended not only that faculty by which we judge of truth and falshood, but that by which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of de∣sires and affections.</P>
<P>The different passions and appetites, the natural subjects of this ruling principle, but which are so apt to rebel against their master, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reduced to two different classes or orders. The first consisted of those passions, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded in pride and resentment, or in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he schoolmen called the irascible part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul; ambition, animosity, the love of ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our and the dread of shame, the desire of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictory, superiority and revenge; all those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assions, in short, which are supposed either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o arise from, or to denote what by a meta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor in our language we commonly call spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t or natural fire. The second consisted of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose passions which are founded in the love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f pleasure, or in what the schoolmen called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he concupiscible part of the soul. It com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ehended all the appetites of the body, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of ease and security, and of all sensual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ratifications.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="413" MS="y"/>It rarely happens that we break in upon that plan of conduct which the governing principle prescribes, and which in all our cool hours we had laid down to ourselves as what was most proper for us to pursue, but when prompted by one or other of those two different sets of passions; either by ungo∣vernable ambition and resentment, or by the importunate sollicitations of present ease and pleasure. But tho' these two orders of pas∣sions are so apt to mislead us, they are still considered as necessary parts of human na∣ture: The first having been given to defend us against injuries, to assert our rank and dignity in the world, to make us aim at what is noble and honourable, and to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s distinguish those who act in the same man∣ner; the second to provide for the suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and necessities of the body.</P>
<P>In the strength, acuteness and perfection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the governing principle was placed the essen∣tial virtue of prudence, which, according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Plato consisted in a just and clear discern∣ment, founded upon general and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ideas, of the ends which were proper to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pursued, and of the means which were pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>per for attaining them.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="414"/>When the first set of passions, those of the irascible part of the soul, had that degree of strength and firmness, which enabled them, un∣der the direction of reason, to despise all dan∣gers in the pursuit of what was honourable and noble; it constituted the virtue of for∣titude and magnanimity. This order of pas∣sions, according to this system, was of a more generous and noble nature than the other. They were considered upon many occasions as the auxiliaries of reason to check, and re∣strain the inferior and brutal appetites. We are often angry at ourselves, it was observed, we often become the objects of our own re∣sentment and indignation, when the love of pleasure prompts us to do what we disap∣prove of; and the irascible part of our na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure is in this manner called in to assist the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ational against the concupiscible.</P>
<P>When all those three different parts of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ature were in perfect concord with one an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, when neither the irascible nor concupi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cible passions ever aimed at any gratification which reason did not approve of, and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason never commanded any thing, but what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese of their own accord were willing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erform: this happy composure, this perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd compleat harmony of soul constituted
<PB N="422" REF="415"/>
that virtue which in their language is express∣ed by a word which we commonly translate temperance, but which might more properly be translated good temper, or sobriety and moderation of mind.</P>
<P>Justice, the last and greatest of the four cardinal virtues, took place, according to this system, when each of those three faculties of the mind, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined itself to it's proper office, without attempting to encroach upon that of any other; when reason directed and pas∣sion obeyed, and when each passion perform∣ed its proper duty, and exerted itself towards its proper object easily and without reluc∣tance, and with that degree of force and en∣ergy, which was suitable to the value of what it pursued. In this consisted that compleat virtue, that perfect propriety of conduct, which Plato, after some of the antient Pytha∣goreans, denominated Justice.</P>
<P>The word, it is to be observed, which ex∣presses justice in the Greek language has se∣veral different meanings; and as the corres∣pondent word in all other languages, so far as I know, has the same, there must be some natural affinity among those various significa∣tions. In one sense we are said to do justice to our neighbour when we abstain from doing
<PB N="423" REF="416"/>
him any positive harm, and do not directly hurt him, either in his person, or in his estate, or in his reputation. This is that justice which I have treated of above, the ob∣servance of which may be extorted by force, and the violation of which exposes to punish∣ment. In another sense we are said not to do justice to our neighbour unless we con∣ceive for him all that love, respect and esteem, which his character, his situation, and his connection with ourselves, render suitable and proper for us to feel, and unless we act accordingly. It is in this sense that we are said to do injustice to a man of merit who is connected with us, tho' we abstain from hurt∣ing him in every respect, if we do not exert ourselves to serve him and to place him in that situation in which the impartial specta∣tor would be pleased to see him. The first sense of the word coincides with what Ari∣stotle and the Schoolmen call commutative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice; and with what Grotius calls the <HI>jus∣titia expletrix,</HI> which consists in abstaining from what is anothers, and in doing volun∣tarily whatever we can with propriety be forced to do. The second sense of the word coincides with what some have called distri∣butive
<PB N="424" REF="417" MS="y"/>
justice <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The distributive justice of Aristotle is somewhat differe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> It consists in the proper distribution of rewards from the pub∣lick stock of a community. see Aristotle Ethic. Nic. l. 5. c. 2.</NOTE>, and with the <HI>justitia attributri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of Grotius, which consists in proper benefi∣cence, in the becoming use of what is our own, and in the applying it to those pur∣poses either of charity or generosity, to which it is most suitable in our situation that it should be applied. In this sense justice com∣prehends all the social virtues. There is yet another sense in which the word justice is sometimes taken, still more extensive than either of the former, tho' very much akin to the last; and which runs too, so far as I know, through all languages. It is in this last sense that we are said to be unjust, when we do not seem to value any particular object with that degree of esteem, or to pursue it with that degree of ardour which to the im∣partial spectator it may appear to deserve or to be naturally fitted for exciting. Thus we are said to do injustice to a poem or a picture, when we do not admire them enough, and we are said to do them more than justice when we admire them too much. In the same manner we are said to do injustice to ourselves when we appear not to give sufficient atten∣tion
<PB N="425" REF="418"/>
to any particular object of self-interest. In this last sense, what is called justice means the same thing with exact and perfect proprie∣ty of conduct and behaviour, and compre∣hends in it, not only the offices of both com∣mutative and distributive justice, but of every other virtue, of prudence, of fortitude, of temperance. It is in this last sense that Plato evidently understands what he calls justice, and which, therefore according to him, com∣prehends in it the perfection of every sort of virtue.</P>
<P>Such is the account given by Plato of the nature of virtue, or of that temper of mind which is the proper object of praise and ap∣probation. It consists, according to him, in that state of mind in which every faculty con∣fines itsself within its proper sphere without encroaching upon that of any other, and per∣forms its proper office with that precise de∣gree of strength and vigour which belongs to it. His account, it is evident, coincides in every respect with what we have said above concerning the propriety of conduct.</P>
<P N="2">II. Virtue, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Aristotle Ethic. Nic. l. 2. c. 5. et seq. et l. 3. c. 5. et seq.</NOTE> according to Aristotle, con∣sists
<PB N="426" REF="419"/>
in the habitual mediocrity of the affec∣tions according to right reason. Every par∣ticular virtue, according to him, lies in a kind of middle between two opposite vices, of which the one offends from being too much, the other from being too little affected by a particular species of objects. Thus the virtue of fortitude or courage lies in a middle be∣tween the opposite vices of cowardice and of presumptuous rashness, of which the one of∣fends from being too much, and the other from being too little affected by the objects of fear. Thus too the virtue of frugality lies in a middle between avarice and profusion, of which the one consists in an excess, the other in a defect of the proper attention to the objects of self-interest. Magnanimity, in the same manner, lies in a middle between the ex∣cess of arrogance and the defect of pusillani∣mity, of which the one consists in too extrava∣gant, the other in too weak a sentiment of our own worth and dignity. It is unnecessary to ob∣serve that this account of virtue corresponds too pretty exactly with what has been said above concerning the propriety and impro∣priety of conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="420"/>According to Aristotle <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Aristotle Ethic. Nic. lib. ii. ch. 1.2.3 and 4.</NOTE>, indeed, virtue did not so much consist in those moderate and right affections, as in the habit of this mode∣ration. In order to understand this, it is to be observed, that virtue may be considered either as the quality of an action, or as the quality of a person. Considered as the quality of an action, it consists, even accord∣ing to Aristotle, in the reasonable moderation of the affection from which the action pro∣ceeds, whether this disposition be habitual to the person or not. Considered as the quality of a person, it consists in the habit of this reasonable moderation, in it's having become the customary and usual disposition of the mind. Thus the action which proceeds from an occasional fit of generosity is undoubtedly a generous action, but the man who performs it, is not necessarily a generous person, be∣cause it may be the single action of the kind which he ever performed. The motive and disposition of heart, from which this action was performed, may have been quite just and proper: but as this happy mood seems to have been the effect rather of accidental hu∣mour than of any thing steady or permanent
<PB N="428" REF="421"/>
in the character, it can reflect no great ho∣nour upon the performer. When we deno∣minate a character generous, or charitable, or virtuous in any respect, we mean to signify that the disposition expressed by each of those appellations is the usual and customary dispo∣sition of the person. But single actions of any kind, how proper and suitable soever, are of little consequence to show that this is the case. If a single action was sufficient to stamp the character of any virtue upon the person who performed it, the most worthless of mankind might lay claim to all the virtues; since there is no man who has not, upon some occasions, acted with prudence, justice, tem∣perance and fortitude. But tho' single actions, how laudable soever, reflect very little praise upon the person who performs them, a single vitious action performed by one whose conduct is usually very regular, greatly dimi∣nishes and sometimes destroys altogether our opinion of his virtue. A single action of this kind sufficiently shows that his habits are not perfect, and that he is less to be depended upon than from the usual train of his be∣haviour we might have been apt to imagine.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="422"/>Aristotle too <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Aristotle Mag. Mor. lib. i. ch. 1.</NOTE>, when he made virtue to con∣sist in practical habits, had it probably in his view to oppose the doctrine of Plato, who seems to have been of opinion that just sen∣timents and reasonable judgments concerning what was fit to be done or to be avoided, were alone sufficient to constitute the most per∣fect virtue. Virtue, according to Plato, might be considered as a species of science, and no man, he thought, could see clearly and de∣monstratively what was right and what was wrong, and not act accordingly. Passion might make us act contrary to doubtful and uncertain opinions, not to plain and evident judgments. Aristotle, on the contrary, was of opinion, that no conviction of the under∣standing was capable of getting the better of inveterate habits, and that good morals arose not from knowledge but from action.</P>
<P N="3">III. According to Zeno <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Cicero de finibus, lib. iii. also Diogenes Laertius in Zenone, lib. vii. segment. 84.</NOTE>, the founder of the Stoical doctrine, every animal was by nature recommended to its own care, and was indowed with the principle of self-love
<PB N="430" REF="423"/>
that it might endeavour to preserve, not only its existence, but all the different parts of its nature in the best and most perfect state of which they were capable.</P>
<P>The self-love of man embraced, if I may say so, his body and all its different mem∣bers, his mind and all its different faculties and powers, and desired the preservation and maintainance of them all in their best and most perfect condition. Whatever tended to support this state of existence was, therefore by nature pointed out to him as fit to be chosen; and whatever tended to destroy it, as fit to be rejected. Thus health, strength, agility and ease of body, as well as all the ex∣ternal conveniencies which could promote these, wealth, power, honours, the respect and esteem of those we live with, were na∣turally pointed out to us as things eligible, and of which the possession was preferable to the contrary. On the other hand, sickness, infirmity, unweildiness, pain of body, as well as all the external inconveniencies which tended to occasion or bring on any of them, poverty, the want of authority, the contempt or hatred of those we live with; were in the same manner, pointed out to us as things to be shunned and avoided. In each of those two
<PB N="431" REF="424"/>
different classes of objects there were some which appeared to be more the objects either of choice or rejection than others in the same class. Thus in the first class health appeared evidently preferable to strength, and strength to agility; reputation to power and power to riches. And thus too, in the second class, sickness was more to be avoided than unweil∣deness of body, ignominy than poverty, and poverty than the want of authority. Virtue and the propriety of conduct consisted in choosing and rejecting all different objects and circumstances according as they were by nature rendered more or less the objects of choice or rejection; in selecting always from among the several objects of choice which were presented to us, that which was most to be chosen, when we could not obtain them all: and in selecting too out of the several objects of rejection which might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e offered to us, that which was least to be avoided when it was not in our power to avoid them all. By choosing and rejecting with this just and accurate discernment, by thus bestowing upon every object the precise de∣gree of attention that was due to it, accord∣ing to the place which it held in this natural scale of things, we maintained, according to the
<PB N="432" REF="425"/>
Stoics, that perfect rectitude of conduct which constituted the essence of virtue. This was what they called to live consistently, to live ac∣cording to nature, and to obey those laws and directions which nature or the author of na∣ture had prescribed for our conduct.</P>
<P>So far the Stoical idea of propriety and virtue is not very different from that of Aristotle and the antient peripatetics. What chiefly distin∣guished those two systems from one another was the different degrees of self-command which they required. The peripatetics allowed of some degree of perturbation as suitable to the weakness of human nature, and as useful to so imperfect a creature as man. If his own mis∣fortune excited no passionate grief, if his own injuries called forth no violent resentment, rea∣son, or a regard to the general rules which deter∣mined what was right and fit to done, would commonly, they thought, be too weak to prompt him to avoid the one or to beat off the other. The Stoics, on the contrary, de∣manded the most perfect apathy, and re∣garded every emotion that could in the smal∣lest degree disturb the tranquility of the mind, as the effect of levity and folly. The Peri∣patetics seem to have thought that no passion exceeded the bounds of propriety as long as
<PB N="433" REF="426"/>
the spectator, by the utmost effort of huma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, could sympathize with it. The stoics, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the contrary, appear to have regarded every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assion as improper, which made any demand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the sympathy of the spectator, or re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uired him to alter in any respect the natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ordinary state of his mind, in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep time with the vehemence of its emo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons.

Nature too had taught us that as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prosperity of two was preferable to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one, that of many or of all must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more so. That we ourselves were but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and that consequently wherever our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was inconsistent with that either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole, or of any considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the whole, it ought, even in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> choice, to yield to what was so vastly prefer∣able. As all the events in this world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conducted by the providence of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> powerful and good God, we might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that whatever happened, tended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prosperity and perfection of the whole. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we ourselves, therefore, were in poverty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sickness, or in any other calamity, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first of all to use our utmost endeavours, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far as justice and our duty to others would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to rescue ourselves from this disagr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able circumstance. But if after all we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="435" REF="428"/>
do, we found this impossible, we ought to rest satisfied that the order and perfection of the universe required that we should in the mean time continue in this situation. And as the prosperity of the whole should, even to us, appear preferable to so insignificant a part as ourselves, our situation, whatever it was, ought from that moment to become the object of our choice, and even of our de∣sire, if we would maintain that compleat pro∣priety and rectitude of sentiment and conduct in which the perfection of our nature con∣sists. If, indeed, any opportunity of extri∣cating ourselves should offer, it became our duty to embrace it. The order of the uni∣verse, it was evident, no longer required our continuance in this situation, and the great director of the world plainly called upon us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o leave it, by so clearly pointing out the road which we were to follow. It was the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase with the adversity of our relations, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riends, our country. If without violating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny more sacred obligation, it was in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower to prevent or to put an end to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alamity, it undoubtedly was our duty to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The propriety of action, the rule which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upiter had given us for the direction of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onduct, evidently required this of us. But
<PB N="436" REF="429"/>
if it was altogether out of our power to do either, we ought then to consider this event as the most fortunate which could possibly have happened: Because we might be assured that it tended most to the prosperity and or∣der of the whole; which was what we our∣selves, if we were wise and equitable, ought most of all to desire.
<Q>In what sense, says Epictetus, are some things said to be ac∣cording to our nature, and others contrary to it? It is in that sense in which we co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sider ourselves as separated and detached from all other things. For thus it may be said to be according to the nature of the foot to be always clean. But if you con∣sider it as a foot, and not as something de∣tached from the rest of the body, it must behoove it sometimes to trample in the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and sometimes to tread upon thorns, and sometimes too to be cut off for the sake of the whole body; and if it refuses this, it is no longer a foot. Thus too ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to conceive with regard to ourselves. What are you? A man. If you consider yourse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as something separated and detached, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agreeable to your nature to live to old age▪ to be rich, to be in health. But if you consider yourself as a man and as a part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a whole, upon account of that whole i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="437" REF="430"/>
will behoove you sometimes to be in sick∣ness, sometimes to be exposed to the incon∣veniency of a sea voyage, sometimes to be in want; and at last, perhaps, to die be∣fore your time. Why then do you com∣plain? Don't you know that by doing so, as the foot ceases to be a foot, so you cease to be a man <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Arrian. lib. ii. c. 5.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>This submission to the order of the uni∣verse, this entire indifference with regard to whatever concerns ourselves, when put into the balance with the interest of the whole, could derive its propriety, it is evident, from no other principle besides that upon which I have endeavoured to show that the propriety of justice was founded. As long as we view our own interests with our own eyes, it is scarce possible that we should willingly ac∣quiesce in their being thus sacrificed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterests of the whole. It is only when we view those opposite interests with the eyes of others that what concerns ourselves can appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be so contemptible in the comparison, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e resigned without any reluctance. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very body but the person principally con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erned nothing can appear more agreeable to
<PB N="438" REF="431"/>
reason and propriety than that the part should give place to the whole. But what is agree∣able to the reason of all other men, ought not to appear contrary to his. He himself therefore ought to approve of this sacrifice and acknowledge its conformity to reason. But all the affections of a wise man, accord∣ing to the stoics, are perfectly agreeable to reason and propriety, and of their own ac∣cord coincide with whatever these ruling principles prescribe. A wise man, therefore, could never feel any reluctance to comply with this disposition of things.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Besides these antient, there are some modern systems, according to which virtue consists in propriety; or in the suitableness of the affection from which we act to the cause or object which excites it. The system of Dr. Clark, which places virtue in acting ac∣cording to the relations of things, in regula∣ting our conduct according to the fitness or incongruity which there may be in the appli∣cation of certain actions to certain things, or to certain relations: That of Mr. Woollaston, which places it in acting according to the truth of things, according to their proper nature and essence, or in treating them as what they really are, and not as what they are not: that
<PB N="439" REF="432"/>
of my lord Shaftesbury, which places it in main∣taining a proper balance of the affections, and in allowing, no passion to go beyond its pro∣per sphere: are all of them more or less inac∣curate descriptions of the same fundamental idea.</P>
<P>The description of virtue which is either given, or at least meant and intended to be given in each of those systems, for some of the modern authors are not very fortunate in their manner of expressing themselves, is no doubt quite just, so far as it goes. There is no virtue without propriety, and wherever there is pro∣priety, some degree of approbation is due. But still this description is imperfect. For tho' propriety is an essential ingredient in every virtuous action, it is not always the sole in∣gredient. Beneficent actions have in them another quality by which they appear not only to deserve approbation but recompence. None of those systems account either easily or suf∣ficiently for that superior degree of esteem which seems due to such actions, or for that diversity of sentiment which they naturally excite. Neither is the description of vice more compleat. For, in the same manner, tho' impropriety is a necessary ingredient in every vitious action, it is not always the sole
<PB N="440" REF="433"/>
ingredient, and there is often the highest de∣gree of absurdity and impropriety in very harmless and insignificant actions. Deliberate actions, of a pernicious tendency to those we live with, have, besides their impropriety, a peculiar quality of their own by which they appear to deserve, not only disapprobation, but punishment; and to be the objects, not of dislike merely, but of resentment and re∣venge: and none of those systems easily and sufficiently accounts for that superior degree of detestation which we feel for such actions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of those systems which make virtue consist in prudence.</HEAD>
<P>THE most antient of those systems which make virtue consist in prudence, and of which any considerable remains have come down to us is that of Epicurus, who is said however, to have borrowed all the leading principles of his philosophy from some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who had gone before him, particularly from Aristippus; tho' it is very probable, notwithstanding this allegation of his enemies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat at least his manner of applying those principles was altogether his own.</P>
<P>According to Epicurus <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Cicero de finibus, lib. i. Diogenes Laert. l. x.</NOTE> bodily pleasure and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain were the sole ultimate objects of natu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al desire and aversion. That they were al∣ways the natural objects of those passions, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought, required no proof. Pleasure, might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed, appear sometimes to be avoided; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, however, because it was pleasure, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause, by the enjoyment of it, we should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither forfeit some greater pleasure, or expose
<PB N="442" REF="435"/>
ourselves to some pain that was more to be avoided than this pleasure was to be desired. Pain, in the same manner, might appear sometimes to be eligible; not, however, be∣cause it was pain, but because by enduring it we might either avoid a still greater pain, or acquire some pleasure of much more impor∣tance. That bodily pain and pleasure, there∣fore, were always the natural objects of de∣sire and aversion, was, he thought, abun∣dantly evident. Nor was it less so, he ima∣gined, that they were the sole ultimate ob∣jects of those passions. Whatever else was either desired or avoided was so, according to him, upon account of its tendency to pro∣duce one or other of those sensations. The tendency to procure pleasure rendered power and riches desireable, as the contrary ten∣dency to produce pain made poverty and in∣significancy the objects of aversion. Honour and reputation were valued, because the es∣teem and love of those we live with were of the greatest consequence both to procure plea∣sure and to defend us from pain. Ignominy and bad fame, on the contrary, were to be avoided, because the hatred, contempt and resentment of those we live with destroyed
<PB N="443" REF="436"/>
all security, and necessarily exposed us to the greatest bodily evils.</P>
<P>All the pleasures and pains of the mind were, according to Epicurus, ultimately de∣rived from those of the body. The mind was happy when it thought of the past plea∣sures of the body, and hoped for others to come: and it was miserable when it thought of the pains which the body had formerly endured, and dreaded the same or greater thereafter.</P>
<P>But the pleasures and pains of the mind, tho' ultimately derived from those of the body, were vastly greater than their origi∣nals. The body felt only the sensation of the present instant, whereas the mind felt also the past and the future, the one by re∣membrance, the other by anticipation, and consequently both suffered and enjoyed much more. When we are under the greatest bodily pain, he observed, we shall always find, if we attend to it, that it is not the suf∣fering of the present instant which chiefly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orments us, but either the agonizing re∣membrance of the past, or the yet more hor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible dread of the future. The pain of each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstant, considered by itself, and cut off from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that goes before and all that comes after
<PB N="444" REF="437" MS="y"/>
it is a trifle, not worth the regarding. Yet this is all which the body can ever be said to suffer. For the same manner, when we en∣joy the greatest pleasure, we shall always find that the bodily sensation, the sensation of the present instant makes but a small part of our happiness, that our enjoyment chiefly arises either from the chearful recollection of the past or the still more joyous anticipation of the future, and that the mind always contri∣butes by much the largest share of the enter∣tainment.</P>
<P>Since our happiness and misery, therefore, depended chiefly upon the mind, if this part of our nature was well disposed, if our thoughts and opinions were as they should be, it was of little importance in what man∣ner our body was affected. Tho' under great bodily pain, we might still enjoy a consider∣able share of happiness, if our reason and judg∣ment maintained their superiority. We might entertain ourselves with the remembrance of past, and with the hopes of future pleasure; we might soften the rigour of our pains, by recollecting what it was which, even in this situation, we were under any necessity of suf∣fering. That this was meerly the bodily sen∣sation, the pain of the present instant, which
<PB N="445" REF="438"/>
by itself could never be very great. That whatever agony we suffered from the dread of its continuance was the effect of an opi∣nion of the mind, which might be corrected by juster sentiments; by considering that if our pains were violent they would probably be of short duration; and that if they were of long continuance, they would probably be moderate, and admit of many intervals of ease; and that, at any rate, death was always at hand and within call to deliver us, which as, according to him, it put an end to all sen∣sation, either of pain or pleasure, could not be regarded as an evil. When we are, said he, death is not; and when death is, we are not; death therefore can be nothing to us.</P>
<P>If the actual sensation of positive pain was in itself so little to be feared, that of pleasure was still less to be desired. Naturally the sensation of pleasure was much less pungent than that of pain. If, therefore, this last could take so very little from the happiness of a well-disposed mind, the other could add scarce any thing to it. When the body was free from pain and the mind from fear and anxiety, the superadded sensation of bodily pleasure could be of very little importance; and though it might diversify, could not pro∣perly
<PB N="446" REF="439"/>
be said to increase the happiness of this situation.</P>
<P>In ease of body, therefore, and in security or tranquility of mind, consisted, according to Epicurus, the most perfect state of human nature, the most compleat happiness which man was capable of enjoying. To obtain this great end of natural desire was the sole object of all the virtues, which, according to him, were not desireable upon their own account, but upon account of their tendency to bring about this situation.</P>
<P>Prudence, for example, tho', according to this philosophy, the source and principle of all the virtues, was not desireable upon its own account. That careful and laborious and circumspect state of mind, ever watch∣ful and ever attentive to the most distant con∣sequences of every action, could not be a thing pleasant or agreeable for its own sake, but upon account of its tendency to the greatest goods and to keep off the greatest evils.</P>
<P>To abstain from pleasure too, to curb and restrain our natural passions for enjoyment, which was the office of temperance, could never be desireable for its own sake. The whole value of this virtue arose from its uti∣lity from its enabling us to postpone the pre∣sent
<PB N="447" REF="440"/>
enjoyment for the sake of a greater to come, or to avoid a greater pain that might ensue from it. Temperance, in short, was nothing but prudence with regard to pleasure.</P>
<P>To support labour, to endure pain, to be exposed to danger or to death, the situations which fortitude would often lead us into, were surely still less the objects of natural de∣sire. They are chosen only to avoid greater evils. We submit to labour, in order to avoid the greater shame and pain of poverty, and we expose ourselves to danger and to death in defence of our liberty and property, the means and instruments of pleasure and happiness; or in defence of our country, in the safety of which our own is necessarily comprehended. For∣titude enables us to do all this chearfully, as the best which, in our present situation, can possibly be done, and is in reality no more than prudence, good judgment and presence of mind in properly appreciating pain, labour and danger, always chusing the less in order to avoid the greater.</P>
<P>It is the same case with justice. To ab∣stain from what is anothers is not desireable upon its own account, and it cannot surely be better for you, that I should possess what
<PB N="448" REF="441"/>
is my own, than that you should possess it. You ought, however, to abstain from what∣ever belongs to me, because by doing other∣wise you will provoke the resentment and in∣dignation of mankind. The security and tranquility of your mind will be entirely de∣stroyed. You will be filled with fear and consternation at the thought of that punish∣ment which you will imagine that men are at all times ready to inflict upon you, and from which no power, no art, no conceal∣ment, will ever in your own fancy be suffi∣cient to protect you. That other species of justice which consists in doing proper good offices to different persons, according to the various relations of neighbours, kinsmen, friends, benefactors, superiors or equals, which they may stand in to us, is recommended by the same reasons. To act properly in all these different relations procures us the esteem and love of those we live with; as to do other∣wise excites their contempt and hatred. By the one we naturally secure, by the other we necessarily endanger, our own ease and tran∣quility, the great and ultimate objects of all our desires. The whole virtue of justice, therefore, the most important of all the vir∣tues,
<PB N="449" REF="442"/>
is no more than discreet and prudent conduct with regard to our neighbours.</P>
<P>Such is the doctrine of Epicurus concern∣ing the nature of virtue. It may seem ex∣traordinary that this philosopher, who is de∣scribed as a person of the most amiable man∣ners, should never have observed, that, what∣ever may be the tendency of those virtues, or of the contrary vices with regard to our bodily ease and security, the sentiments which they naturally excite in others are the objects of a much more passionate desire or aversion than all their other consequences; That to be amiable, to be respectable, to be the proper object of esteem, is by every well-disposed mind more valued than all the ease and secu∣rity which love, respect and esteem can pro∣cure us; That, on the contrary, to be odious, to be contemptible, to be the proper object of indignation, is more dreaded than all that we can suffer in our body from hatred, con∣tempt or indignation; and that consequently our desire of the one character, and our aver∣sion to the other, cannot arise from any regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the effects which either of them is likely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o produce upon the body.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="443"/>This system is, no doubt, altogether incon∣sistent with that which I have been endea∣vouring to establish. It is not difficult, how∣ever, to discover from what phasis, if I may say so, from what particular view or aspect of nature this account of things derives its probability. By the wise contrivance of the author of nature, virtue is upon all ordinary occasions, even with regard to this life, real wisdom, and the surest and readiest means of obtaining both safety and advantage. Our success or disappointment in our undertakings must very much depend upon the good or bad opinion which is commonly entertained of us, and upon the general disposition of those we live with, either to assist or to oppose us. But the best, the surest, the easiest and the readiest way of obtaining the advantageous and avoiding the unfavourable judgments of others, is undoubtedly to render ourselves the proper objects of the former and not of the latter.
<Q>Do you desire, said Socrates, the reputation of a good musician? The only sure way of obtaining it, is to become a good musician. Would you desire in the same manner to be thought capable of serving your country either as a general o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a statesman? The best way in this ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="451" REF="444"/>
too is really to acquire the art and expe∣rience of war and government, and to be∣come really fit to be a general or a states∣man. And in the same manner if you would be reckoned sober, temperate, just and equitable, the best way of acquiring this reputation is to become sober, tempe∣rate, just and equitable. If you can really render yourself amiable, respectable, and the proper object of esteem, there is no fear of your not soon acquiring the love, the respect and esteem of those you live with.</Q>
Since the practice of virtue, there∣fore, is in general so advantageous, and that of vice so contrary to our interest, the con∣sideration of those opposite tendencies un∣doubtedly stamps an additional beauty and propriety upon the one, and a new deformity and impropriety upon the other. Tempe∣rance, magnanimity, justice and beneficence, come thus to be approved of, not only under their proper characters, but under the addi∣tional character of the highest wisdom and most real prudence. And in the same man∣ner the contrary vices of intemperance, pu∣silanimity, injustice, and either malevolence or sordid selfishness come to be disapproved of, not only under their proper characters,
<PB N="452" REF="445"/>
but under the additional character of the most short-sighted folly and weakness. Epi∣curus appears in every virtue to have at∣tended to this species of propriety only. It is that which is most apt to occur to those who are endeavouring to persuade others to regu∣larity of conduct. When men by their prac∣tice and perhaps too by their maxims, mani∣festly show that the natural beauty of virtue is not likely to have much effect upon them, how is it possible to move them but by re∣presenting the folly of their conduct, and how much they themselves are in the end likely to suffer by it?</P>
<P>By running up all the different virtues too to this one species of propriety, Epicurus in∣dulged a propensity, which is natural to all men, but which philosophers in particular are apt to cultivate with a peculiar fondness, as the great means of displaying their inge∣nuity, the propensity to account for all ap∣pearances from as few principles as possible▪ And he, no doubt, indulged this propensity still further, when he referred all the primary objects of natural desire and aversion to the pleasures and pains of the body. The great patron of the atomical philosophy, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much pleasure in deducing all the pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="453" REF="446"/>
and qualities of bodies from the most obvious and familiar, the figure, motion and arrange∣ment of the small parts of matter, felt no doubt a similar satisfaction, when he ac∣counted, in the same manner, for all the sen∣timents and passions of the mind from those which are most obvious and familiar.</P>
<P>The system of Epicurus agreed with those of Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno, in making vir∣tue consist in acting in the most suitable man∣ner to obtain the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prima naturae.</NOTE> primary objects of natural desire. It differed from all of them in two other respects; first, in the account which it gave of those primary objects of natural de∣sire; and secondly, in the account which it gave of the excellence of virtue or of the rea∣son why that quality ought to be esteemed.</P>
<P>The primary objects of natural desire con∣sisted, according to Epicurus in bodily plea∣sure and pain, and in nothing else: whereas, according to the other three philosophers, there were many other objects, such us know∣ledge, such as the happiness of our relations, of our friends, of our country, which were ultimately desireable for their own sake.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="447"/>Virtue too, according to Epicurus, did not deserve to be pursued for its own sake, nor was itself one of the primary objects of natu∣ral appetite, but was eligible only upon ac∣count of its tendency to prevent pain and to procure ease and pleasure. In the opinion of the other three, on the contrary, it was desireable, not meerly as the means of pro∣curing the other primary objects of natural desire, but as something which was in itself more valuable than them all. Man, they thought, being born for action, his happi∣ness must consist, not meerly in the agreeable∣ness of his passive sensations, but also in the propriety of his active exertions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of those systems which make virtue con∣sist in benevolence.</HEAD>
<P>THE system which makes virtue con∣sist in benevolence, tho' I think not so antient as all of those which I have already given an account of, is, however, of very great antiquity. It seems to have been the doctrine of the greater part of those philo∣sophers who, about and after the age of Au∣gustus, called themselves Eclectics, who pre∣tended to follow chiefly the opinions of Plato and Pythagoras, and who upon that account are commonly known by the name of the latter Platonists.</P>
<P>In the divine nature, according to these authors, benevolence or love was the sole principle of action, and directed the exertion of all the other attributes. The wisdom of the deity was employed in finding out the means for bringing about those ends which his goodness suggested, as his infinite power was exerted to execute them. Benevolence,
<PB N="456" REF="449"/>
however, was still the supreme and governing attribute, to which the others were subser∣vient, and from which the whole excellency, or the whole morality, if I may be allowed such an expression, of the divine operations, was ultimately derived. The whole perfec∣tion and virtue of the human mind consisted in some resemblance or participation of the di∣vine perfections, and, consequently, in being filled with the same principle of benevolence and love which influenced all the actions of the deity. The actions of men which flowed from this motive were alone truly praise-worthy, or could claim any merit in the sight of the deity. It was by actions of cha∣rity and love only that we could imitate, as became us, the conduct of God, that we could express our humble and devout admi∣ration of his infinite perfections, that by fostering in our own minds the same divine principle, we could bring our own affections to a greater resemblance with his holy attri∣butes, and thereby become more proper ob∣jects of his love and esteem; till at last we arrived at that immediate converse and com∣munication with the deity to which it was
<PB N="457" REF="450"/>
the great object of this philosophy to raise us.</P>
<P>This system, as it was much esteemed by many antient fathers of the christian church, so after the reformation it was adopted by se∣veral divines of the most eminent piety and learning and of the most amiable manners; particularly, by Dr. Ralph Cudworth, by Dr. Henry More, and by Mr. John Smith of Cambridge. But of all the patrons of this system, antient or modern, the late Dr. Hut∣cheson, was undoubtedly beyond all compa∣rison, the most acute, the most distinct, the most philosophical, and what is of the greatest consequence of all, the soberest and most ju∣dicious.</P>
<P>That virtue consists in benevolence is a notion supported by many appearances in hu∣man nature. It has been observed already that proper benevolence is the most graceful and agreeable of all the affections, That it is recommended to us by a double sympathy, that as its tendency is necessarily beneficient, it is the proper object of gratitude and re∣ward, and that upon all these accounts it ap∣pears to our natural sentiments to possess a merit superior to any other. It has been ob∣served
<PB N="458" REF="451"/>
too that even the weaknesses of bene∣volence are not very disagreeable to us, whereas those of every other passion are al∣ways extremely disgusting. Who does not abhor, excessive malice, excessive selfishness, or excessive resentment? But the most ex∣cessive indulgence even of partial friendship is not so offensive. It is the benevolent pas∣sions only which can exert themselves with∣out any regard or attention to propriety, and yet retain something about them which is en∣gaging. There is something pleasing even in mere instinctive good-will which goes on to do good offices without once reflecting whether by this conduct it is the proper ob∣ject either of blame or approbation. It is not so with the other passions. The moment they are deserted, the moment they are unaccom∣panied by the sense of propriety, they cease to be agreeable.</P>
<P>As benevolence bestows upon those ac∣tions which proceed from it a beauty superior to all others, so the want of it, and much more the contrary inclination communicates a peculiar deformity to whatever evidences such a disposition. Pernicious actions are of∣ten punishable for no other reason than be∣cause
<PB N="459" REF="452"/>
they show a want of sufficient attention to the happiness of our neighbour.</P>
<P>Besides all this Dr. Hutcheson <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See enquiry concerning virtue sect. 1. and 2.</NOTE> observed, that whenever in any action, supposed to proceed from benevolent affections, some other motive had been discovered, our sense of the merit of this action was just so far di∣minished as this motive was believed to have influenced it. If an action supposed to pro∣ceed from gratitude, should be discovered to have arisen from an expectation of some new favour, or if what was apprehended to pro∣ceed from public spirit, should be found out to have taken its origin from the hope of a pecuniary reward, such a discovery would entirely destroy all notion of merit or praise-worthiness in either of these actions. Since, therefore, the mixture of any selfish motive, like that of a baser alloy, diminished or took away altogether the merit which would otherwise have belonged to any action, it was evident, he imagined, that virtue must consist in pure and disinterested benevo∣lence alone.</P>
<P>When those actions, on the contrary, which are commonly supposed to proceed
<PB N="460" REF="453"/>
from a selfish motive, are discovered to have arisen from a benevolent one, it greatly en∣hances our sense of their merit. If we be∣lieved of any person that he endeavoured to advance his fortune from no other view but that of doing friendly offices, and of making proper returns to his benefactors, we should only love and esteem him the more. And this observation seemed still more to confirm the conclusion, that it was benevolence only which could stamp upon any action the cha∣racter of virtue.</P>
<P>Last of all, what, he imagined, was an evi∣dent proof of the justness of this account of virtue, in all the disputes of casuists con∣cerning the rectitude of conduct, the public good, he observed, was the standard to which they constantly referred, thereby universally acknowledging that whatever tended to pro∣mote the happiness of mankind was right and laudable and virtuous, and the contrary wrong, blameable and vitious. In the late debates about passive obedience and the right of resistence, the sole point in controversy among men of sense was, whether universal submission would probably be attended with greater evils than temporary insurrections
<PB N="461" REF="454"/>
when privileges were invaded. Whether what upon the whole, tended most to the happiness of mankind, was not also morally good, was never once, he said, made a question.</P>
<P>Since benevolence, therefore, was the only motive which could bestow upon any action the character of virtue, the greater the bene∣volence which was evidenced by any action, the greater the praise which must belong to it.</P>
<P>Those actions which aimed at the happi∣ness of a great community, as they demon∣strated a more enlarged benevolence than those which aimed only at that of a smaller system, so were they, likewise, proportionally the more virtuous. The most virtuous of all affections, therefore, was that which em∣braced as its object the happiness of all intel∣ligent beings. The least virtuous, on the con∣trary, of those to which the character of vir∣tue could in any respect belong, was that which aimed no further than at the happi∣ness of an individual, such as a son, a brother, a friend.</P>
<P>In directing all our actions to promote the greatest possible good, in submitting all infe∣rior
<PB N="462" REF="455"/>
affections to the desire of the general happiness of mankind, in regarding ourselves but as one of the many, whose prosperity was to be pursued no further than it was con∣sistent with or conducive to that of the whole, consisted the perfection of virtue.</P>
<P>Self-love was a principle which could never be virtuous in any degree or in any direction. It was vitious whenever it obstructed the ge∣neral good. When it had no other effect than to make the individual take care of his own happiness, it was meerly innocent, and tho' it deserved no praise, neither ought it to incur any blame. Those benevolent actions which were performed, notwithstanding some strong motive from self-interest, were the more virtuous upon that account. They de∣monstrated the strength and vigour of the benevolent principle.</P>
<P>Dr. Hutcheson <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Inquiry concerning virtue, sect. 2. art. 4, also illustra∣tions on the moral sense, sect. 5. last paragraph.</NOTE> was so far from allowing self-love to be in any case a motive of vir∣tuous actions, that even a regard to the plea∣sure of self-approbation, to the comfortable applause of our own consciences, according
<PB N="463" REF="456"/>
to him diminished the merit of a benevolent action. This was a selfish motive, he thought, which, so far as it contributed to any action, demonstrated the weakness of that pure and disinterested benevolence which could alone stamp upon the conduct of men the character of virtue. In the common judgments of man∣kind, however, this regard to the approba∣tion of our own minds is so far from being considered as what can in any respect dimi∣nish the virtue of any action, that it is rather looked upon as the sole motive which de∣serves the appellation of virtuous.</P>
<P>Such is the account given of the nature of virtue in this amiable system, a system which has a peculiar tendency to nourish and sup∣port in the human heart the noblest, and the most agreeable of all affections, and not only to check the injustice of self-love, but in some measure to discourage that principle altogether, by representing it as what could never reflect any honour upon those who were influenced by it.</P>
<P>As some of the other systems which I have already given an account of, do not suffi∣ciently explain from whence arises the pecu∣liar excellency of the supreme virtue of be∣neficence,
<PB N="464" REF="457"/>
so this system seems to have the contrary defect, of not sufficiently explain∣ing from whence arises our approbation of the inferior virtues of prudence, vigilance, circumspection, temperance, constancy, firm∣ness. The view and aim of our affections, the beneficent and hurtful effects which they tend to produce, are the only qualities that are at all attended to in this system. Their propriety and impropriety, their suitableness and unsuitableness to the cause which ex∣cites them, are disregarded altogether.</P>
<P>Regard to our own private happiness and interest too, appear upon many occasions very laudable principles of action. The habits of oeconomy, industry, discretion, attention and application of thought, are generally supposed to be cultivated from self-interested motives, and at the same time are appre∣hended to be very praise-worthy qualities, which deserve the esteem and approbation of every body. The mixture of a selfish motive, it is true, seems often to sully the beauty of those actions which ought to arise from a be∣nevolent affection. The cause of this, how∣ever, is not that self-love can never be the
<PB N="465" REF="458"/>
motive of a virtuous action, but that the be∣nevolent principle appears in this particular case to want its due degree of strength, and to be altogether unsuitable to its object. The character, therefore, seems evidently imper∣fect, and upon the whole to deserve blame rather than praise. The mixture of a bene∣volent motive in an action to which self-love alone ought to be sufficient to prompt us, is not so apt indeed to diminish our sense of its propriety, or of the virtue of the person who performs it. We are not ready to suspect any person of being defective in selfishness. This is by no means the weak side of human nature, or the failing of which we are apt to be suspicious. If we could really believe, however, of any man that, was it not from a regard to his family and friends, he would not take that proper care of his health, his life, or his fortune, to which self-preservation ought alone to be sufficient to prompt him, it would undoubtedly be a failing, tho' one of those amiable failings, which render a per∣son rather the object of pity than of contempt or hatred. It would still, however, some∣what diminish the dignity and respectableness of his character. Carelessness and want of oeconomy are universally disapproved of▪
<PB N="466" REF="459"/>
not, however, as proceeding from a want of benevolence, but from a want of the proper attention to the objects of self-interest.</P>
<P>Tho' the standard by which casuists fre∣quently determine what is right or wrong in human conduct, be its tendency to the wel∣fare or disorder of society; it does not follow that a regard to the welfare of society should be the sole virtuous motive of action, but only that, in any competition, it ought to cast the balance against all other motives.</P>
<P>Benevolence may, perhaps, be the sole principle of action in the deity, and there are several, not improbable, arguments which tend to persuade us that it is so. It is not easy to conceive what other motive an independent and all-perfect being, who stands in need of nothing external and whose happiness is com∣pleat in himself, can act from. But what∣ever may be the case with the deity, so im∣perfect a creature as man, the support of whose existence requires so many things exter∣nal to him, must often act from many other motives. The condition of human nature were peculiarly hard, if those affections, which, by the very nature of our being, ought frequently to influence our conduct, could upon no occasion appear virtuous, or
<PB N="467" REF="460"/>
deserve esteem and commendation from any body.</P>
<P>Those three systems, that which places virtue in propriety, that which places it in prudence, and that which makes it consist in benevolence, are the principal accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue. To one or other of them, all the other descrip∣tions of virtue, how different soever they may appear, are easily reducible.</P>
<P>That system which places virtue in obe∣dience to the will of the deity, may be counted either among those which make it consist in prudence, or among those which make it consist in propriety. When it is asked, why we ought to obey the will of the deity, this question, which would be im∣pious and absurd in the highest degree, if asked from any doubt that we ought to obey him, can admit but of two different an∣swers. It must either be said that we ought to obey the will of the deity because he is a being of infinite power, who will re∣ward us eternally if we do so and punish us eternally if we do otherwise: Or it must be said, that independent of any regard to our own happiness, or to rewards and pu∣nishments
<PB N="468" REF="461"/>
of any kind, there is a con∣gruity and fitness that a creature should obey its creator, that a limited and imperfect be∣ing should submit to one of infinite and in∣comprehensible perfections. Besides one or other of these two it is impossible to con∣ceive that any other answer can be given to this question. If the first answer be the proper one, virtue consists in prudence or in the proper pursuit of our own final in∣terest and happiness; since it is upon this ac∣count that we are obliged to obey the will of the deity. If the second answer be the pro∣per one, virtue must consist in propriety, since the ground of our obligation to obe∣dience is the suitableness or congruity of the sentiments of humility and submission to the superiority of the object which excites them.</P>
<P>That system which places virtue in uti∣lity coincides too with that which makes it consist in propriety. According to this system all those qualities of the mind which are agreeable or advantageous, either to the person himself or to others are approved of as virtuous, and the contrary disapproved of as vitious. But the agreeableness or utility
<PB N="469" REF="462"/>
of any affection depends upon the degree which it is allowed to subsist in. Every af∣fection is useful when it is confined to a cer∣tain degree of violence; and every affection is disadvantageous when it exceeds the bounds of this moderation. According to this system therefore, virtue consists, not in any one af∣fection, but in the proper degree of all the affections. The only difference between it and that which I have been endeavouring to establish, is, that it makes utility, and not sympathy, or the correspondent affection of the spectator, the measure of this proper degree.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of licentious systems.</HEAD>
<P>ALL those systems, which I have hitherto given an account of, suppose that there is a real and essential distinction between vice and virtue, whatever these qua∣lities may consist in. There is a real and essential difference between the propriety and impropriety of any affection, between bene∣volence and any other principle of action, between real prudence and short sighted folly or precipitate rashness. In the main too all of them contribute to encourage the praise-worthy, and to discourage the blameable disposition.</P>
<P>It may be true, perhaps, of some of them, that they tend in some measure to break the ballance of the affections, and to give the mind a particular biass to some principles of action beyond the proportion that is due to them. The antient systems, which place virtue in propriety, seem chiefly to recom∣mend the great, the awful and the respect∣able
<PB N="471" REF="464"/>
virtues, the virtues of self-government and self-command; fortitude, magnanimity, independency upon fortune, the contempt of all outward accidents, of pain, poverty, exile and death. It is in these great exertions that the noblest propriety of conduct is displayed. The soft, the amiable, the gentle virtues, all the virtues of indulgent humanity are in comparison but little insisted upon, and seem on the contrary, by the Stoics in particular, to have been often regarded as meer weaknesses which it behoved a wise man not to harbour in his breast.</P>
<P>The benevolent system, on the other hand, while it fosters and encourages all those mil∣der virtues in the highest degree, seems en∣tirely to neglect the more awful and respect∣able qualities of the mind. It even denies them the appellation of virtues. It calls them moral abilities and treats them as qualities which do not deserve the same sort of esteem and approbation which is due to what is pro∣perly denominated virtue. All those prin∣ciples of action which aim only at our own interest, it treats, if that be possible, still worse. So far from having any merit of their own, they diminish, it pretends, the merit of benevolence, when they co∣operate
<PB N="472" REF="465"/>
with it: and prudence, it is as∣serted, when employed only in promoting private interest, can never even be imagined a virtue.</P>
<P>That system, again, which makes virtue consist in prudence only, while it gives the highest encouragement to the habits of cau∣tion, vigilance, sobriety and judicious mode∣ration, seems to degrade equally both the amiable and respectable virtues, and to strip the former of all their beauty and the latter of all their grandeur.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding these defects, the ge∣neral tendency of each of those three systems is to encourage the best and most laudable habits of the human mind: and it were well for society if either mankind in general, or even those few who pretend to live according to any philosophical rule, were to regulate their conduct by the precepts of any one of them. We may learn from each of them something that is both valuable and peculiar. If it was possible, by precept and exhorta∣tion, to inspire the mind with fortitude and magnanimity, the antient systems of pro∣priety would seem sufficient to do this. Or if it was possible, by the same means to soften
<PB N="473" REF="466"/>
it into humanity, and to awaken the affec∣tions of kindness and general love towards those we live with, some of the pictures with which the benevolent system presents us, might seem capable of producing this effect. We may learn from the system of Epicurus, tho' undoubtedly the worst of all the three, how much the practice of both the amiable and respectable virtues is conducive to our own interest, to our own ease and safety and quiet even in this life. As Epicurus placed happiness in the attainment of ease and secu∣rity, he exerted himself in a particular man∣ner to show that virtue was, not meerly the best and the surest, but the only means of acquiring those invaluable possessions. The good effects of virtue, upon our inward tran∣quility and peace of mind, are what other philosophers have chiefly celebrated. Epi∣curus, without neglecting this topic, has chiefly insisted upon the influence of that amiable quality on our outward prosperity and safety. It was upon this account that his writings were so much studied in the an∣tient world by men of all different philoso∣phical parties. It is from him that Cicero, the great enemy of the Epicurean system, borrows his most agreeable proofs that virtue
<PB N="474" REF="467"/>
alone is sufficient to secure happiness. Sene∣ca, tho' a stoic, the sect most opposite to that of Epicurus, yet quotes this philosopher more frequently than any other.</P>
<P>There are, however, some other systems which seem to take away altogether the di∣stinction between vice and virtue, and of which the tendency, is upon that account, wholly pernicious: I mean the systems of the duke of Rochefaucault and Dr. Mande∣ville. Tho' the notions of both these au∣thors are in almost every respect erroneous, there are, however, some appearances in hu∣man nature which, when viewed in a cer∣tain manner, seem at first sight to favour them. These, first slightly sketched out with the elegance and delicate precision of the duke of Rochefaucault, and afterwards more fully represented with the lively and humourous, tho' coarse and rustic eloquence of Dr. Mandeville, have thrown upon their doctrines an air of truth and probability which is very apt to impose upon the unskilful.</P>
<P>Dr. Mandeville, the most methodical of those two authors, considers whatever is done from a sense of propriety, from a regard to what is commendable and praise-worthy, as
<PB N="475" REF="468"/>
being done from a love of praise and com∣mendation, or as he calls it from vanity. Man, he observes, is naturally much more interested in his own happiness than in that of others, and it is impossible that in his heart he can ever really prefer their prospe∣rity to his own. Whenever he appears to do so, we may be assured that he imposes upon us, and that he is then acting from the same selfish motives as at all other times. Among his other selfish passions, vanity is one of the strongest, and he is always easily flattered and greatly delighted with the applauses of those about him. When he appears to sacrifice his own interest to that of his companions, he knows that this conduct will be highly agreeable to their self-love, and that they will not fail to express their satisfaction by bestowing upon him the most extravagant praises. The pleasure which he expects from this, overbalances, in his opinion, the interest which he abandons in order to procure it. His conduct, therefore, upon this occasion is in reality just as selfish, and arises from just as mean a motive as upon any other. He is flattered, however, and he flatters himself with the belief that it is entirely disin∣terested; since, unless this was supposed, it
<PB N="476" REF="469"/>
would not seem to merit any commendation either in his own eyes or in those of others. All public spirit, therefore, all preference of public to private interest, is, according to him, a meer cheat and imposition upon mankind; and that human virtue which is so much boasted of, and which is the occasion of so much emulation among men, is the meer offspring of flattery begot upon pride.</P>
<P>Whether the most generous and public spi∣rited actions may not in some sense be re∣garded as proceeding from self-love I shall not at present examine. The decision of this question is not, I apprehend, of any im∣portance towards establishing the reality of virtue, since self-love may frequently be a virtuous motive of action. I shall only en∣deavour to show that the desire of doing what is honourable and noble, of rendering ourselves the proper objects of esteem and approbation cannot with any propriety be called vanity. Even the love of well-grounded fame and reputation, the desire of acquiring esteem by what is really estimable, does not deserve that name. The first is the love of virtue, the noblest and best passion of hu∣man nature. The second is the love of true glory, a passion inferior no doubt to the for∣mer,
<PB N="477" REF="470"/>
but which in dignity appears to come immediately after it. He is guilty of vanity who desires praise for qualities which are either not praise-worthy in any degree, or not in that degree in which he expects to be praised for them; who sets his character upon the frivolous ornaments of dress and equi∣page, or the equally frivolous accomplish∣ments of ordinary behaviour. He is guilty of vanity who desires praise for what indeed very well deserves it, but what he perfectly knows does not belong to him. The empty coxcomb who gives himself airs of impor∣tance which he has no title to, the silly liar who assumes the merit of adventures which never happened, the foolish plagiary who gives himself out for the author of what he has no pretensions to, are properly accused of this passion. He too is said to be guilty of vanity who is not contented with the silent sentiments of esteem and approbation, who seems to be fonder of their noisy expressions and acclamations than of the sentiments them∣selves, who is never satisfied but when his own praises are ringing in his ears, and who sollicits with the most anxious importunity all external marks of respect, is fond of titles, of compliments, of being visited, of being
<PB N="478" REF="471"/>
attended, of being taken notice of in public places with the appearance of deference and attention. This frivolous passion is altogether different from either of the two former, and is the passion of the lowest, and the least of mankind as they are of the noblest and the greatest.</P>
<P>But tho' these three passions, the desire of rendering ourselves the proper objects of ho∣nour and esteem; or of becoming what is ho∣nourable and estimable; the desire of ac∣quiring honour and esteem by really deserv∣ing those sentiments; and the frivolous de∣sire of praise at any rate, are widely dif∣ferent; tho' the two former are always ap∣proved of while the latter never fails to be despised; there is, however, a certain remote affinity among them which, exaggerated by the humorous and diverting eloquence of this lively author, has enabled him to impose upon his readers. There is an affinity be∣tween vanity and the love of true glory, as both these passions aim at acquiring esteem and approbation. But they are different in this, that the one is a just, reasonable and equitable passion, while the other is unjust, absurd and ridiculous. The man who de∣sires esteem for what is really estimable, de∣sires
<PB N="479" REF="472"/>
nothing but what he is justly entitled to, and what cannot be refused him without some sort of injury. He, on the contrary, who desires it upon any other terms, demands what he has no just claim to. The first is easily satisfied, is not apt to be jealous or suspicious that we do not esteem him enough, and is seldom sollicitous about receiving many external marks of our regard. The other, on the contrary, is never to be satis∣fied, is full of jealousy and suspicion that we do not esteem him so much as he desires, because he has some secret consciousness that he desires more than he deserves. The least neglect of ceremony, he considers, as a mor∣tal affront and as an expression of the most determined contempt. He is restless and im∣patient and perpetually afraid that we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost all respect for him, and is upon this ac∣count always anxious to obtain new expres∣sions of esteem, and cannot be kept in tem∣per but by continual attendance and adu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation.</P>
<P>There is an affinity too between the desire of becoming what is honourable and estim∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, and the desire of honour and esteem, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etween the love of virtue and the love of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue glory. They resemble one another not
<PB N="480" REF="473"/>
only in this respect, that both aim at really being what is honourable and noble, but even in that respect in which the love of true glory resembles what is properly called vani∣ty, some reference to the sentiments of others. The man of the greatest magnanimity, who desires virtue for its own sake, and is most in∣different about what actually are the opinions of mankind with regard to him, is still, how∣ever, delighted with the thoughts of what they should be, with the consciousness that tho' he may neither be honoured nor ap∣plauded, he is still the proper object of ho∣nour and applause, and that if mankind were cool and candid and consistent with them∣selves, and properly informed of the motives and circumstances of his conduct, they would not fail to honour and applaud him. Tho' he despises the opinions which are actu∣ally entertained of him, yet he has the highest value for those which ought to be entertained of him. That he might think himself worthy of those honourable sentiments, and, whatever was the idea which other men might conceive of his character, that when he should put himself in their situation, and consider, not what was, but what ought to be their opinion, he should always have the
<PB N="481" REF="474"/>
highest idea of it himself, was the great and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xalted motive of his conduct. As even in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he love of virtue, therefore, there is still some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eference; tho' not to what is, yet to what in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason and propriety ought to be, the opinion of others, there is even in this respect some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffinity between it, and the love of true glory. There is, however, at the same time, a very great difference between them. The man who acts solely from a regard to what is right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fit to be done, from a regard to what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he proper object of esteem and approbation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' these sentiments should never be bestowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon him, acts from the most sublime and godlike motive which human nature is even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apable of conceiving. The man, on the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, who while he desires to merit appro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, is at the same time anxious to obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, tho' he too is laudable in the main, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is motives have a greater mixture of human <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfirmity. He is in danger of being morti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied by the ignorance and injustice of man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind, and his happiness is exposed to the envy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his rivals, and the folly of the publick. The happiness of the other, on the contrary, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltogether secure and independent of fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of the caprice of those he lives with.
<PB N="482" REF="475"/>
The contempt and hatred which may be thrown upon him by the ignorance of man∣kind, he considers as not belonging to him, and is not at all mortified by it. Mankind despise and hate him from a false notion of his character and conduct. If they knew him better they would esteem and love him. It is not him whom, properly speaking, they hate and despise, but another person whom they mistake him to be. Our friend, whom we should meet at a masquerade in the garb of our enemy, would be more diverted than mortified, if under that disguise we should vent our indignation against him. Such are the sentiments of a man of real magnanimity; when exposed to unjust censure. It seldom happens, however, that human nature arrives at this degree of firmness. Tho' none b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the weakest and most worthless of mankind are much delighted with false glory, yet, by a strange inconsistency, false ignominy is often capable of mortifying those who appear the most resolute and determined.</P>
<P>Dr. Mandeville is not satisfied with repre∣senting the frivolous motive of vanity, as the source of all those actions which are com∣monly accounted virtuous. He endeavours to point out the imperfection of human vir∣tue
<PB N="483" REF="476"/>
in many other respects. In every case, he pretends, it falls short of that compleat self-denial which it pretends to, and, instead of a conquest, is commonly no more than a con∣cealed indulgence of our passions. Wherever our reserve with regard to pleasure▪ falls short of the most ascetic abstinence, he treats it as gross luxury and sensuality. Every thing, ac∣cording to him, is luxury which exceeds what is absolutely necessary for the support of hu∣man nature, so that there is vice even in the use of a clean shirt, or of a convenient habi∣tation. The indulgence of the inclination to sex, in the most lawful union, he considers as the same sensuality with the most hurtful gratifi∣cation of that passion, and derides that tem∣perance and that chastity which can be prac∣tised at so cheap a rate. The ingenious so∣phistry of his reasoning, is here, as upon many other occasions, covered by the ambi∣guity of language. There are some of our passions which have no other names except those which mark the disagreeable and offen∣sive degree. The spectator is more apt to take notice of them in this degree than in any other. When they shock his own sentiments, when they give him some sort of antipathy and uneasiness, he is necessarily obliged to at∣tend
<PB N="484" REF="477"/>
to them, and is from thence naturally led to give them a name. When they fall in with the natural state of his own mind, he is very apt to overlook them altogether, and either gives them no name at all, or, if he gives them any, it is one which marks rather the subjection and restraint of the passion, than the degree which it still is allowed to subsist in, after it is so subjected and restrained. Thus the common names of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luxury and lust.</NOTE> love of pleasure, and of the <SUP>b</SUP> love of sex denote a vitious and offensive degree of those passions. The words temperance and chastity on the other hand, seem to mark rather the restraint and subjec∣tion which they are kept under than the de∣gree which they are still allowed to subsist in▪ When he can show, therefore, that they still subsist in some degree, he imagines, he has entirely demolished the reality of the virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of temperance and chastity, and shown them to be meer impositions upon the inattenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and simplicity of mankind. Those virtues, however, do not require an entire insensibi∣lity to the objects of the passions which they mean to govern. They only aim at restrain∣ing the violence of those passions so far as not
<PB N="485" REF="478"/>
to hurt the individual, and neither disturb nor offend the society.</P>
<P>It is the great fallacy of Dr. Mandeville's book <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fable of the Bees.</NOTE>to represent every passion as wholly vi∣tious which is so in any degree and in any di∣rection. It is thus that he treats every thing as vanity which has any reference either to what are or to what ought to be the senti∣ments of others: and it is by means of this sophistry that he establishes his favourite con∣clusion, that private vices are public benefits. If the love of magnificence, a taste for the elegant arts and improvements of human life, for whatever is agreeable in dress, furniture, or equipage, for architecture, statuary, paint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and music, is to be regarded as luxury, sensuality and ostentation, even in those whose situation allows, without any inconveniency, the indulgence of those passions, it is certain that luxury, sensuality and ostentation are public benefits: since, without the qualities upon which he thinks proper to bestow such opprobrious names, the arts of refinement could never find encouragement, and must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anguish for want of employment. Some popular ascetic doctrines which had been cur∣rent
<PB N="486" REF="479"/>
before his time, and which placed virtue in the entire extirpation and annihilation of all our passions, were the real foundation of this licentious system. It was easy for Dr. Mandeville to prove, first, that this en∣tire conquest never actually took place among men; and, secondly, that, if it was to take place, universally, it would be pernicious to society, by putting an end to all industry and commerce, and in a manner to the whole bu∣siness of human life. By the first of these propositions he seemed to prove that there was no real virtue, and that what pretended to be such was a meer cheat and imposition upon mankind; and by the second, that pri∣vate vices were public benefits, since with∣out them no society could prosper or flourish.</P>
<P>Such is the system of Dr. Mandeville, which once made so much noise in the world, and which, tho' perhaps it never gave occa∣sion to more vice than what would have been without it, at least taught that vice which arose from other causes to appear with more effrontery, and to avow the corruption of its motives with a profligate audaciousness which had never been heared of before.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="480"/>But how destructive soever this system may appear, it could never have imposed upon so great a number of persons, nor have occasioned so general an alarm among those who are the friends of better principles, had it not in some respects bordered upon the truth. A system of natural philosophy may appear very plausible and be for a long time very generally received in the world, and yet have no foundation in nature, nor any sort of resemblance to the truth. The vortices of Des Cartes were regarded by a very inge∣nious nation, for near a century together, as a most satisfactory account of the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. Yet it has been de∣monstrated to the conviction of all mankind that these pretended causes of those wonder∣ful effects, not only do not actually exist, but are utterly impossible, and if they did exist, could produce no such effects as are ascribed to them. But it is otherwise with systems of moral philosophy, and an author who pre∣tends to account for the origin of our moral sentiments, cannot deceive us so grossly, nor depart so very far from all resemblance to the truth. When a traveller gives us an account of some distant country, he may impose upon our credulity the most groundless and absurd
<PB N="488" REF="481"/>
as the most certain matters of fact. But when a person pretends to inform us of what passes in our own neighbourhood, and of the affairs of the very parish which we live in, tho' here too, if we are so careless as not to examine things with our own eyes, he may deceive us in many respects, yet the greatest falshoods which he imposes upon us must bear some resemblance to the truth, and must even have a considerable mixture of truth in them. An author who treats of na∣tural philosophy, and pretends to assign the causes of the great phaenomena of the uni∣verse, pretends to give an account of the af∣fairs of a very distant country, concerning which he may tell us what he pleases, and as long as his narration keeps within the bounds of seeming possibility, he need not despair of gaining our belief. But when he proposes to explain the origin of our desires and affections, of our sentiments of appro∣bation and disapprobation, he pretends to give an account, not only of the affairs of the very parish that we live in, but of our own do∣mestic concerns. Tho' here too, like indo∣lent masters who put their trust in a steward who deceives them, we are very liable to be imposed upon, yet we are incapable of pas∣sing
<PB N="489" REF="482"/>
any account which does not preserve some little regard to the truth. Some of the articles, at least, must be just, and even those which are most overcharged must have had some foundation, otherwise the fraud would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e detected even by that careless inspection which we are disposed to give. The author who should assign, as the cause of any natu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al sentiment, some principle which neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad any connection with it, nor resembled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny other principle which had some such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onnection, would appear absurd and ridicu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous to the most injudicious and unexperi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nced reader.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the different systems which have been formed concerning the principle of appro∣bation.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the inquiry concerning the na∣ture of virtue, the next question of importance in Moral Philosophy, is concern∣ing the principle of approbation, concerning the power or faculty of the mind which ren∣ders certain characters agreeable or disagree∣able to us, makes us prefer one tenor of con∣duct to another, denominate the one right and the other wrong, and consider the one as the object of approbation, honour and re∣ward; the other as that of blame, censure and punishment.</P>
<P>Three different accounts have been give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this principle of approbation. Accord∣ing to some, we approve and disapprove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our own actions and of those of others from self-love only, or from some view <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their tendency to our own happiness or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣advantage: according to others▪ reason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="491" REF="484"/>
same faculty by which we distinguish be∣tween truth and falshood, enables us to di∣stinguish between what is fit and unfit both in actions and affections: according to others this distinction is altogether the effect of im∣mediate sentiment and feeling, and arises from the satisfaction or disgust with which the view of certain actions or affections in∣spires us. Self-love, reason and sentiment, therefore, are the three different sources which have been assigned for the principle of approbation.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to give an account of those different systems, I must observe, that the determination of this second question, though of the greatest importance in specu∣lation, is of none in practice. The question concerning the nature of virtue necessarily has some influence upon our notions of right and wrong in many particular cases. That concerning the principle of approbation can possibly have no such effect. To examine from what contrivance or mechanism within, those different notions or sentiments arise, is a meer matter of philosophical curiosity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of those systems which deduce the principle of approbation from self-love.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who account for the principle of approbation from self-love, do not all account for it in the same manner, and there is a good deal of confusion and inac∣curacy in all their different systems. Accord∣ing to Mr. Hobbs, and many of his follow∣ers <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Puffendorf. Mandeville.</NOTE>, man is driven to taken refuge in so∣ciety, not by any natural love which he bears to his own kind, but because without the assistance of others he is incapable of subsist∣ing with ease or safety. Society, upon this account, becomes necessary to him, and whatever tends to its support and welfare, he considers as having a remote tendency to his own interest, and, on the contrary, whatever is likely to disturb or destroy it, he regards as in some measure hurtful or pernicious to himself. Virtue is the great support and vice the great disturber of human society. The former therefore, is agreeable, and the
<PB N="493" REF="486"/>
latter offensive to every man; as from the one he foresees the prosperity, and from the other the ruin and disorder of what is so ne∣cessary for the comfort and security of his existence.</P>
<P>That the tendency of virtue to promote, and of vice to disturb the order of society, when we consider it coolly and philosophi∣cally, reflects a very great beauty upon the one, and a very great deformity upon the other, cannot, as I have observed upon a former occasion, be called in question. Hu∣man society, when we contemplate it in a certain abstract and philosophical light, ap∣pears like a great, an immense machine whose regular and harmonious movements produce a thousand agreeable effects. As in any other beautiful and noble machine that was the production of human art, whatever tended to render its movements more smooth and easy, would derive a beauty from this effect, and, on the contrary, whatever ten∣ded to obstruct them would displease upon that account: so virtue, which is, as it were, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fine polish to the wheels of society, ne∣cessarily pleases; while vice, like the vile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ust, which makes them jarr and grate upon one another, is as necessarily offensive. This
<PB N="494" REF="487"/>
account, therefore, of the origin of appro∣bation and disapprobation, so far as it derives them from a regard to the order of society, runs into that principle which gives beauty to utility, and which I have explained upon a former occasion; and it is from thence that this system derives all that appearance of pro∣bability which it possesses. When those authors describe the innumerable advantages of a cultivated and social, above a savage and solitary life; when they expatiate upon the necessity of virtue and good order for the maintainance of the one, and demonstrate how infallibly the prevalence of vice and dis∣obedience to the laws tend to bring back the other, the reader is charmed with the no∣velty and grandeur of those views which they open to him; he sees plainly a new beauty in virtue, and a new deformity in vice, which he had never taken notice of before, and is commonly so delighted with the discovery, that he seldom takes time to reflect, that this political view, having never occurred to him in his life before, cannot possibly be the ground of that approbation and disapprobation with which he has always been accustomed to consider those different qualities.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="488"/>When those authors, on the other hand, deduce from self-love the interest which we take in the welfare of society, and the esteem which upon that account we bestow upon virtue, they do not mean, that when we in this age applaud the virtue of Cato, and de∣test the villainy of Catiline, our sentiments are influenced by the notion of any benefit we receive from the one or of any detriment we suffer from the other. It was not because the prosperity or subversion of society, in those remote ages and nations, was apprehended to have any influence upon our happiness or misery in the present times; that according to those philosophers, we esteemed the vir∣tuous, and blamed the disorderly character. They never imagined that our sentiments were influenced by any benefit or damage which we supposed actually to redound to us from either; but by that which might have redounded to us, had we lived in those distant ages and countries; or by that which might still redound to us, if in our own times we should meet with characters of the same kind. The idea, in short, which those authors were groping about, but which they were never able to unfold distinctly, was that indirect sympathy which we feel with
<PB N="496" REF="489"/>
the gratitude or resentment of those who re∣ceived the benefit or suffered the damage re∣sulting from such opposite characters: and it was this which they were indistinctly point∣ing at, when they said, that it was not the thought of what we had gained or suffered which prompted our applause or indignation, but the conception or imagination of what we might gain or suffer if we were to act in society with such associates.</P>
<P>Sympathy, however, cannot, in any sense, be regarded as a selfish principle. When I sympathize with your sorrow or your indig∣nation, it may be pretended, indeed, that my emotion is founded in self-love, because it arises from bringing your case home to my∣self, from putting myself in your situation, and thence conceiving what I should feel in the like circumstances. But tho' sympathy is very properly said to arise from an imagi∣nary change of situations with the person principally concerned, yet this imaginary change is not supposed to happen to me in my own person and character, but in that of the person with whom I sympathize. When I condole with you for the loss of your only son, in order to enter into your grief I do not consider what I, a person of such a cha∣racter
<PB N="497" REF="490"/>
and profession, should suffer, if I had a son, and if that son was unfortunately to die, but I consider what I should suffer if I was really you, and I not only change cir∣cumstances with you, but I change persons and characters. My grief, therefore, is en∣tirely upon your account, and not in the least upon my own. It is not, therefore, in the least selfish. How can that be regarded as a selfish passion which does not arise even from the imagination of any thing that has befallen or that relates to myself in my own proper person and character, but which is entirely occupied about what relates to you. A man may sympathize with a woman in child-bed; though it is impossible that he should con∣ceive himself as suffering her pains in his own proper person, and character. That whole account of human nature, however, which deduces all sentiments and affections from self-love, which has made so much noise in the world, but which, so far as I know, has never yet been fully and distinctly explained, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eems to me to have arisen from some con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used misapprehension of the system of sym∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of those systems which make reason the prin∣ciple of approbation.</HEAD>
<P>IT is well known to have been the doc∣trine of Mr. Hobbs, that a state of nature, is a state of war; and that antecedent to the institution of civil government there could be no safe or peaceable society among men. To preserve society, therefore, according to him, was to support civil government, and to dis∣troy civil government was the same thing as to put an end to society. But the existence of civil government depends upon the obe∣dience that is paid to the supreme magistrate. The moment he loses his authority, all go∣vernment is at an end. As self-preservation, therefore, teaches men to applaud whatever tends to promote the welfare of society, and to blame whatever is likely to hurt it; so the same principle, if they would think and speak consistently, ought to teach them to applaud upon all occasions obedience to the civil ma∣gistrate, and to blame all disobedience and re∣bellion.
<PB N="499" REF="492"/>
The very ideas of laudable and blameable, ought to be the same with those of obedience and disobedience. The laws of the civil magistrate, therefore, ought to be regarded as the sole ultimate standards of what was just and unjust, of what was right and wrong.</P>
<P>It was the avowed intention of Mr. Hobbs, by propagating these notions, to subject the consciences of men immediately to the civil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd not to the ecclesiastical powers, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urbulence and ambition, he had been taught, by the example of his own times, to regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the principal source of the disorders of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ociety. His doctrine, upon this account, was peculiarly offensive to Theologians, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccordingly did not fail to vent their indigna∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion against him with great asperity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itterness. It was likewise offensive to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound moralists, as it supposed that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o natural distinction between right and wrong, that these were mutable and change∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble and depended upon the meer arbitrary will of the civil magistrate. This account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f things, therefore, was attacked from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uarters and by all sorts of weapons, by sober <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason as well as by furious declamation.</P>
<P><PB N="500" REF="493"/>In order to confute so odious a doctrine it was necessary to prove, that antecedent to all law or positive institution, the mind was na∣turally indowed with a faculty by which it distinguished in certain actions and affections the qualities of right, laudable and virtuous, and in others those of wrong, blameable and vitious.</P>
<P>Law, it was justly observed by Dr. Cud∣worth <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Immutable morality. l. 1.</NOTE>, could not be the original source of those distinctions; since upon the supposi∣tion of such a law, it must either be right to obey it, and wrong to disobey it, or indiffe∣rent whether we obeyed it, or disobeyed it. That law which it was indifferent whether we obeyed or disobeyed, could not, it was evident, be the source of those distinctions; neither could that which it was right to obey and wrong to disobey, since even this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supposed the antecedent notions or ideas of right and wrong, and that obedience to the law was conformable to the idea of right, and disobedience to that of wrong.</P>
<P>Since the mind, therefore, had a notion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those distinctions antecedent to all law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seemed necessarily to follow, that it deriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="501" REF="494"/>
this notion from reason, which pointed out the difference between right and wrong, in the same manner in which it did that between truth and falsehood: and this conclusion, which tho' true in some respects, is rather hasty in others, was more easily received at a time when the abstract science of human nature was but in its infancy, and before the distinct offices and powers of the different fa∣culties of the human mind had been carefully examined and distinguished from one another. When this controversy with Mr. Hobbs was carried on with the greatest warmth and keenness, no other faculty had been thought of from which any such ideas could possibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e supposed to arise. It became at this time, therefore, the popular doctrine, that the essence of virtue and vice did not consist in the conformity or disagreement of human actions with the law of a superior, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir conformity or disagreement with reason, which was thus considered as the original <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ource and principle of approbation and dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pprobation.</P>
<P>That virtue consists in conformity to rea∣son is true in some respects, and this faculty may very justly be considered, as in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense, the source and principle of approbation
<PB N="502" REF="495"/>
and disapprobation, and of all solid judgments concerning right and wrong. It is by reason that we discover those general rules of justice by which we ought to regulate our actions: and it is by the same faculty that we form those more vague and indeterminate ideas of what is prudent, of what is decent, of what is generous or noble, which we carry con∣stantly about with us, and according to which we endeavour, as well as we can, to model the tenor of our conduct. The general maxims of morality are formed, like all other general maxims, from experience and induc∣tion. We observe in a great variety of par∣ticular cases what pleases or displeases our moral faculties, what these approve or disap∣prove of, and, by induction from this expe∣rience, we establish those general rules. But induction is always regarded as one of the operations of reason. From reason, therefore, we are very properly said to derive all those general maxims and ideas. It is by these, however, that we regulate the greater part of our moral judgments, which would be extremely uncertain and precarious if they depended altogether upon what is liable to so many variations as immediate sentiment and feeling, which the different states of health
<PB N="503" REF="496"/>
and humour are capable of altering so essen∣tially. As our most solid judgments, there∣fore, with regard to right and wrong are re∣gulated by maxims and ideas derived from an induction of reason, virtue may very properly be said to consist in a conformity to reason, and so far this faculty may be considered as the source and principle of approbation and disapprobation.</P>
<P>But tho' reason is undoubtedly the source of the general rules of morality, and of all the moral judgments which we form by means of them; it is altogether absurd and unintelli∣gible to suppose that the first perceptions of right and wrong can be derived from reason, even in those particular cases upon the expe∣rience of which the general rules are formed. These first perceptions, as well as all other experiments upon which any general rules are founded, cannot be the object of reason, but of immediate sense and feeling. It is by find∣ing in a vast variety of instances that one tenor of conduct constantly pleases in a cer∣tain manner, and that another as constantly displeases the mind, that we form the general rules of morality. But reason cannot render any particular object either agreeable or dis∣agreeable to the mind for its own sake.
<PB N="504" REF="497"/>
Reason may show that this object is the means of obtaining some other which is naturally either pleasing or displeasing, and in this man∣ner may render it either agreeable or disagree∣able for the sake of something else. But no∣thing can be agreeable or disagreeable for its own sake which is not rendered such by im∣mediate sense and feeling. If virtue, there∣fore, in every particular instance, necessarily pleases for its own sake, and if vice as cer∣tainly displeases the mind, it cannot be reason, but immediate sense and feeling, which in this manner, reconciles us to the one, and alienates us from the other.</P>
<P>Pleasure and pain are the great objects of desire and aversion: but these are distinguish∣ed not by reason but by immediate sense and feeling. If virtue, therefore, is desireable for its own sake, and if vice is, in the same man∣ner the object of aversion, it cannot be rea∣son which originally distinguishes those diffe∣rent qualities, but immediate sense and feel∣ing.</P>
<P>As reason, however, in a certain sense, may justly be considered as the principle of approbation and disapprobation, these senti∣ments were thro' inattention, long regarded as originally flowing from the operations of
<PB N="505" REF="498"/>
this faculty. Dr. Hutcheson had the merit of being the first who distinguished with any degree of precision in what respect all moral distinctions may be said to arise from reason, and in what respect they are founded upon immediate sense and feeling. In his illustra∣tions upon the moral sense he has explained this so fully, and, in my opinion, so unan∣swerably that, if any controversy is still kept up about this subject, I can impute it to no∣thing, but either to inattention to what that gentleman has written, or to a superstitious attachment for certain forms of expression, a weakness not very uncommon among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earned, especially in subjects so deeply inter∣esting as the present, in which a man of virtue is often loath to abandon, even the propriety of a single phrase which he has been accus∣tomed to.</P>

<PB N="506" REF="499"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of those systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation may be divided into two different classes.</P>
<P N="1">I. According to some the principle of ap∣probation is founded upon a sentiment of a peculiar nature, upon a particular power of perception exerted by the mind at the view of certain actions or affections; some of which affecting this faculty in an agreeable and others in a disagreeable manner, the first are stampt with the characters of right, laudable, and virtuous; the last with those of wrong, blameable and vitious. This sentiment be∣ing of a peculiar nature distinct from every other, and the effect of a particular power of perception, they give it a particular name, and call it a moral sense.</P>
<P N="2">II. According to others, in order to ac∣count for the principle of approbation, there is no occasion for supposing any new power of perception which had never been heard of
<PB N="507" REF="500"/>
before: nature, they imagine, acts here, as in all other cases, with the strictest oeconomy, and produces a multitude of effects from one and the same cause; and sympathy, a power which has always been taken notice of, and with which the mind is manifestly endowed, is, they think, sufficient to account for all the effects ascribed to this peculiar faculty.</P>
<P N="1">I. Dr. Hutcheson <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Enquiry concerning virtue.</NOTE> had been at great pains to prove that the principle of approbation was not founded on self-love. He had de∣monstrated too that it could not arise from any operation of reason. Nothing remained, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he thought, but to suppose it a faculty of a peculiar kind, with which nature had endow∣ed the human mind, in order to produce this one particular and important effect. When self-love and reason were both excluded, it did not occur to him that there was any other known faculty of the mind which could in any respect answer this purpose.</P>
<P>This new power of perception he called a moral sense, and supposed it to be somewhat analogous to the external senses. As the bodies around us by affecting these in a cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain manner appear to possess the different qualities of sound, taste, odour, colour; so
<PB N="508" REF="501"/>
the various affections of the human mind by touching this particular faculty in a certain manner, appear to possess the different qua∣lities of amiable and odious, of virtuous and vitious, of right and wrong.</P>
<P>The various senses or powers of percep∣tion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Treatise of the passions.</NOTE>, from which the human mind derives all its simple ideas, were, according to this system, of two different kinds, of which the one were called the direct or antecedent, the other the reflex or consequent senses. The direct senses were those faculties from which the mind derived the perception of such species of things as did not presuppose the antecedent perception of any other. Thus sounds and colours were objects of the direct senses. To hear a sound or to see a colour does not presuppose the antecedent perception of any other quality or object. The reflex or consequent senses, on the other hand, were those faculties from which the mind de∣rived the perception of such species of things as presupposed the antecedent perception of some other. Thus harmony and beauty were objects of the reflex senses. In order to per∣ceive the harmony of a sound, or the beauty of a colour, we must first perceive the sound
<PB N="509" REF="502"/>
or the colour. The moral sense was con∣sidered as a faculty of this kind. That fa∣culty, which Mr. Locke calls reflection, and from which he derived the simple ideas of the different passions and emotions of the human mind, was, according to Dr. Hutche∣son, a direct internal sense. That faculty again by which we perceived the beauty or deformity, the virtue or vice of those dif∣ferent passions and emotions was a reflex in∣ternal sense.</P>
<P>Dr. Hutcheson endeavoured still further to support this doctrine, by shewing that it was agreeable to the analogy of nature, and that the mind was endowed with a variety of other reflex senses exactly similar to the moral sense, such as a sense of beauty and deform∣ity in external objects; a public sense by which we sympathize with the happiness or misery of our fellow-creatures; a sense of shame and honour, and a sense of ridicule.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the pains which this ingenious philosopher has taken to prove that the principle of approbation is founded in a peculiar power of perception, somewhat analogous to the external sen∣ses, there are some consequences, which he acknowledges to follow from this doctrine,
<PB N="510" REF="503"/>
that will, perhaps, be regarded by many as a sufficient confutation of it. The qualities, he allows <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Illustrations upon the moral sense. Sect. 1. page 237, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seq. Third Edition.</NOTE>, which belong to the objects of any sense cannot without the greatest absur∣dity be ascribed to the sense itself. Who∣ever thought of calling the sense of seeing black or white, the sense of hearing loud or low, or the sense of tasting sweet or bitter? and, according to him, it is equally absurd to call our moral faculties virtuous or vicious, morally good or evil. These qualities belong to the objects of those faculties, not to the faculties themselves. If any man, therefore, was so absurdly constituted as to approve of cruelty and injustice as the highest virtues, and to disapprove of equity and humanity as the most pitiful vices, such a constitution of mind might indeed be regarded as inconveni∣ent both to the individual and to the society, and likewise as strange, surprising and un∣natural in itself; but it could not, without the greatest absurdity, be denominated vi∣cious or morally evil.</P>
<P>Yet surely if we saw any man shouting with admiration and applause at a barbarous and unmerited execution, which some insolent ty∣rant
<PB N="511" REF="504"/>
had ordered, we should not think we were guilty of any great absurdity in denominating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his behaviour vicious and morally evil in the highest degree, tho' it expressed nothing but depraved moral faculties, or an absurd appro∣bation of this horrid action, as of what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oble, magnanimous and great. Our heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imagine, at the sight of such a spectator, would forget for a while its sympathy with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sufferer, and feel nothing but horror and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etestation, at the thought of so execrable a wretch. We should abominate him even more than the tyrant who might be goaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by the strong passions of jealousy, fear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esentment, and upon that account be more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcusable. But the sentiments of the spec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ator would appear altogether without cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r motive, and therefore most perfectly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompleatly detestable. There is no perver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of sentiment or affection which our heart would be more averse to enter into, or which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would reject with greater hatred and indig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation than one of this kind, and so far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egarding such a constitution of mind as being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eerly something strange or inconvenient, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot in any respect vitious or morally evil, we
<PB N="512" REF="505"/>
should rather consider it as the very last and most dreadful stage of moral depravity.</P>
<P>Correct moral sentiments, on the contrary, naturally appear in some degree laudable and morally good. The man whose censure and applause are upon all occasions suited with the greatest accuracy to the value or unworthiness of the object, seems to deserve a degree even of moral approbation. We admire the de∣licate precision of his moral sentiments: they lead our own judgments, and upon account of their uncommon and surprizing justness, they even excite our wonder and applause. We cannot indeed be always sure that the conduct of such a person would be in any respect correspondent to the precision and accuracy of his judgments concerning the conduct of others. Virtue requires habit and resolution of mind, as well as delicacy of sentiment, and unfortunately the former qualities are some∣times wanting, where the latter is in the great∣est perfection. This disposition of mind, however, tho' it may sometimes be attended with imperfections is incompatible with any thing that is grosly criminal, and is the hap∣piest foundation upon which the superstruc∣ture of perfect virtue can be built. There are many men who mean very well and seri∣ously
<PB N="513" REF="506"/>
propose to do what they think their duty, who notwithstanding are disagreeable on ac∣count of the coarseness of their moral senti∣ments.</P>
<P>It may be said perhaps that tho' the prin∣ciple of approbation is not founded upon any power of perception that is in any respect an∣alogous to the external senses, it may still be founded upon a peculiar sentiment which an∣swers this one particular purpose and no other. Approbation and disapprobation, it may be pretended, are certain feelings or emotions which arise in the mind upon the view of different characters and actions; and as re∣sentment might be called a sense of injuries, or gratitude a sense of benefits, so these may very properly receive the name of a sense of right and wrong, or of a moral sense.</P>
<P>But this account of things, tho' it may not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e liable to the same objections with the fore∣going, is exposed to others which are equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nanswerable.</P>
<P>First of all, whatever variations any par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cular emotion may undergo, it still preserves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general features which distinguish it to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> emotion of such a kind, and these general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are always more striking and remark∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble than any variation which it may undergo
<PB N="514" REF="507"/>
in particular cases. Thus anger is an emo∣tion of a particular kind: and accordingly its general features are always more distinguish∣able than all the variations it undergoes in particular cases. Anger against a man, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, no doubt, somewhat different from anger against a woman, and that again from anger against a child. In each of those three cases, the general passion of anger receives a diffe∣rent modification from the particular charac∣ter of its object, as may easily be observed by the attentive. But still the general fea∣tures of the passion predominate in all these cases. To distinguish these, requires no nice observation: a very delicate attention, on the contrary, is necessary to discover their variati∣ons: every body takes notice of the former▪ scarce any body observes the latter. If ap∣probation and disapprobation, therefore, were, like gratitude, and resentment, emotions of a particular kind, distinct from every other, we should expect that in all the variations which either of them might undergo, it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> retain the general features which mark it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be an emotion of such a particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> clear, plain and easily distinguishable. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in fact it happens quite otherwise. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attend to what we really feel when upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ferent
<PB N="515" REF="508"/>
occasions we either approve or disap∣prove, we shall find that our emotion in one case is often totally different from that in an∣other, and that no common features can pos∣sibly be discovered between them. Thus the approbation with which we view a tender, delicate and humane sentiment, is quite dif∣ferent from that with which we are struck by one that appears great, daring and mag∣nanimous. Our approbation of both may upon different occasions be perfect and intire; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut we are softened by the one, and we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>levated by the other, and there is no sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esemblance between the emotions which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey excite in us. But, according to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ystem which I have been endeavouring to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stablish, this must necessarily be the case. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the emotions of the person whom we ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rove of are quite opposite to one another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd as our approbation arises from sympathy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith those opposite emotions, what we feel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the one occasion, can have no sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>semblance to what we feel upon the other. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut this could not happen if approbation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsisted in a peculiar emotion which had no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing in common with the sentiments we ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oved of, but which arose at the view of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntiments, like any other passion at the view
<PB N="516" REF="509"/>
of its proper object. The same thing holds true with regard to disapprobation. Our hor∣ror for cruelty has no sort of resemblance to our contempt for mean-spiritedness. It is quite a different species of discord which we feel at the view of those two different vices, between our own minds and those of the person whose sentiments and behaviour we consider.</P>
<P>Secondly, I have already observed, that not only the different passions or affections of the human mind that are approved or disap∣proved of, appear morally good or evil, but that proper and improper approbation appear to our natural sentiments to be stampt with the same characters. I would ask, therefore, how it is, that, according to this system, we approve or disapprove of proper or improper approbation. To this question, I imagine there is but one reasonable answer, which can possibly be given. It must be said th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when the approbation with which our neigh∣bour regards the conduct of a third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coincides with our own, we approve of his approbation and consider it as in some me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sure morally good, and that on the contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when it does not coincide with our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣timents, we disapprove of it, and consider
<PB N="517" REF="510"/>
as in some measure morally evil. It must be allowed, therefore, that, at least in this one case, the coincidence or opposition of senti∣ments between the observer and the person observed, constitutes moral approbation or disapprobation. And if it does so in this one case, I would ask, why not in every other? or to what purpose imagine a new power of perception in order to account for those senti∣ments?</P>
<P>Against every account of the principle of approbation which makes it depend upon a peculiar sentiment distinct from every other, I would object; that it is strange that this sen∣timent, which providence undoubtedly in∣tended to be the governing principle of hu∣man nature, should hitherto have been so little taken notice of, as not to have got a name in any language. The word moral sense is of very late formation, and cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et be considered as making part of the En∣glish tongue. The word approbation has but within these few years been appropriated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enote peculiarly any thing of this kind. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ropriety of language we approve of what∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver is entirely to our satisfaction, of the form <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a building, of the contrivance of a ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hine, of the flavour of a dish of meat. The
<PB N="518" REF="511"/>
word conscience does not immediately denote any moral faculty by which we approve or disapprove. Conscience supposes, indeed, the existence of some such faculty, and properly signifies our consciousness of having acted agreeably or contrary to its directions. When love, hatred, joy, sorrow, gratitude, resent∣ment, with so many other passions which are all supposed to be the subjects of this prin∣ciple, have made themselves considerable enough to get titles to know them by, is it not surprizing that the sovereign of them all should hitherto have been so little heeded, that, a few philosophers excepted, no body has yet thought it worth while to bestow a name upon it.</P>
<P>When we approve of any character or ac∣tion, the sentiments which we feel, are, ac∣cording to the foregoing system, derived from four sources, which are in some respects dif∣ferent from one another. First, we sympa∣thize with the motives of the agent; second∣ly, we enter into the gratitude of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive the benefit of his actions; thirdly, we observe that his conduct has been agree∣able to the general rules by which those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sympathies generally act; and, last of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when we consider such actions as making▪
<PB N="519" REF="512"/>
part of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the happiness either of the individual or of the society, they appear to derive a beauty from this utility, not unlike that which we ascribe to any well contrived machine. After deducting, in any one particular case, all that must be acknowledged to proceed from some one or other of these four principles, I should be glad to know what remains, and I shall freely allow this overplus to be ascribed to a moral sense, or to any other peculiar fa∣culty, provided any body will ascertain pre∣cisely what this overplus is. It might be ex∣pected, perhaps, that if there was any such peculiar principle, such as this moral sense is supposed to be, we should feel it, in some par∣ticular cases, separated and detached from every other, as we often feel joy, sorrow, hope and fear, pure and unmixed with any other emotion. This however, I imagine, cannot even be pretended. I have never heard any instance alledged in which this principle could be said to exert itself alone and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nmixed with sympathy or antipathy, with gratitude or resentment, with the perception <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the agreement or disagreement of any ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion to an established rule, or last of all with
<PB N="520" REF="513"/>
that general taste for beauty and order which is excited by inanimated as well as by animat∣ed objects.</P>
<P N="2">II. There is another system which attempts to account for the origin of our moral senti∣ments from sympathy, distinct from that which I have been endeavouring to establish. It is that which places virtue in utility, and accounts for the pleasure with which the spec∣tator surveys the utility of any quality from sympathy with the happiness of those who are affected by it. This sympathy is different both from that by which we enter into the motives of the agent, and from that by which we go along with the gratitude of the per∣sons who are benefited by his actions. It is the same principle with that by which we approve of a well contrived machine. But no machine can be the object of either of those two last mentioned sympathies. I have already, in the fourth part of this discourse, given some account of this system.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Of the manner in which different authors have treated of the practical rules of morality.</HEAD>
<P>IT was observed in the third part of this discourse, that the rules of justice are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he only rules of morality which are precise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd accurate; that those of all the other vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues are loose, vague, and indeterminate; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the first may be compared to the rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f grammar; the others to those which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritics lay down for the attainment of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sublime and elegant in composition, and which present us rather with a general idea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the perfection we ought to aim at than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fford us any certain and infallible directions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquiring it.</P>
<P>As the different rules of morality admit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch different degrees of accuracy, those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthors who have endeavoured to collect and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igest them into systems have done it in two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifferent manners, and one set has followed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rough the whole that loose method to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey were naturally directed by the considera∣tion
<PB N="522" REF="515"/>
of one species of virtues; while another has as universally endeavoured to introduce into their precepts that sort of accuracy of which only some of them are susceptible. The first have wrote like critics, the second like gram∣marians.</P>
<P N="1">I. The first, among whom we may count all the antient moralists, have contented them∣selves with describing in a general manner the different vices and virtues, and with point∣ing out the deformity and misery of the one disposition as well as the propriety and hap∣piness of the other, but have not affected to lay down many precise rules that are to hold good unexceptionably in all particular cases. They have only endeavoured to ascertain, as far as language is capable of ascertaining, first, wherein consists the sentiment of the heart, upon which each particular virtue is found∣ed, what sort of internal feeling or emotion it is which constitutes the essence of friend∣ship, of humanity, of generosity, of justice, of magnanimity, and of all the other virtues as well as of the vices which are opposed to them: and, secondly, What is the general way of acting, the ordinary tone and tenor of conduct to which each of those sentiments would direct us, or how it is that a friendly,
<PB N="523" REF="516"/>
a generous, a brave, a just, and a humane man, would, upon ordinary occasions, chuse to act.</P>
<P>To characterize the sentiment of the heart, upon which each particular virtue is found∣ed, tho' it requires both a delicate and an ac∣curate pencil, is a task, however, which may be executed with some degree of exactness. It is impossible, indeed, to express all the variations which each sentiment either does or ought to undergo, according to every possible variation of circumstances. They are endless, and language wants names to mark them by. The sentiment of friend∣ship, for example, which we feel for an old man is different from that which we feel for a young: that which we entertain for an austere man different from that which we feel for one of softer and gentler manners: and that again from what we feel for one of gay vivacity and spirit. The friendship which we conceive for a man is different from that with which a woman affects us, even where there is no mixture of any grosser passion. Who could enumerate and ascertain these and all the other infinite varieties which this sentiment is capable of undergoing? But still the general sentiment of friendship and fa∣miliar
<PB N="524" REF="517"/>
attachment that is common to them all, may be ascertained with a sufficient de∣gree of accuracy. The picture that is drawn of it, tho' it will always be in many respects incompleat, may, however, have such a re∣semblance as to make us know the original when we meet with it, and even distinguish it from other sentiments to which it has a considerable resemblance, such as good-will, respect, esteem, admiration.</P>
<P>To describe, in a general manner, what is the ordinary way of acting to which each virtue would prompt us, is still more easy. It is indeed scarce possible to describe the in∣ternal sentiment or emotion upon which it is founded without doing something of this kind. It is impossible by language to express, if I may say so, the invisible features of all the dif∣ferent modifications of passion as they show themselves within. There is no other way of marking and distinguishing them from one another, but by describing the effects which they produce without, the alterations which they occasion in the countenance, in the air and external behaviour, the resolutions they suggest, the actions they prompt to. It is thus that Cicero, in the first book of his offices, endeavours to direct us to the practice of the four cardinal virtues, and that Ari∣stotle
<PB N="525" REF="518"/>
in the practical parts of his ethics, points out to us the different habits by which he would have us regulate our behaviour, such as liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and even jocularity and good humour, qualities, which that indulgent philosopher has thought worthy of a place in the catalogue of the virtues, tho' the lightness of that approbation which we naturally bestow upon them, should not seem to entitle them to so venerable a name.</P>
<P>Such works present us with agreeable and lively pictures of manners. By the vivacity of their descriptions they inflame our natural love of virtue, and increase our abhorrence of vice: by the justness as well as delicacy of their observations they may often help both to correct and to ascertain our natural sentiments with regard to the propriety of conduct, and suggesting many nice and de∣licate attentions, form us to a more exact justness of behaviour, than what, without such instruction, we should have been apt to think of. In treating of the rules of mo∣rality, in this manner, consists the science which is properly called ethics, a science, which tho' like criticism, it does not admit of the most accurate precision, is, however, both highly useful and agreeable. It is of
<PB N="526" REF="519"/>
all others the most susceptible of the embel∣lishments of eloquence, and by means of them of bestowing, if that be possible, a new importance upon the smallest rules of duty. Its precepts when thus dressed and adorned are capable of producing upon the flexibility of youth the noblest and most last∣ing impressions, and as they fall in with the natural magnanimity of that generous age, they are able to inspire, for a time at least, the most heroic resolutions, and thus tend both to establish and confirm the best and most useful habits of which the mind of man is susceptible. Whatever precept and exhortation can do to animate us to the prac∣tice of virtue, is done by this science de∣livered in this manner.</P>
<P N="2">II. The second set of moralists, among whom we may count all the casuists of the middle and latter ages of the christian church as well as all those who in this and in the preceeding century have treated of what is called natural jurisprudence, do not content themselves with characterizing in this gene∣ral manner that tenor of conduct which they would recommend to us, but endeavour to lay down exact and precise rules for the di∣rection of every circumstance of our beha∣viour. As justice is the only virtue with re∣gard
<PB N="527" REF="520"/>
to which such exact rules can properly be given; it is this virtue, that has chiefly fallen under the consideration of those two different sets of writers. They treat of it, however, in a very different manner.</P>
<P>Those who write upon the principles of Jurisprudence consider only what the person to whom the obligation is due ought to think himself entitled to exact by force, what every impartial spectator would approve of him for exacting, or what a judge or arbiter to whom he had submitted his case, and who had un∣dertaken to do him justice, ought to oblige the other person to suffer or to perform. The casuists on the other hand do not so much examine what it is that might properly be exacted by force, as what it is that the per∣son who owes the obligation ought to think himself bound to perform from the most sa∣cred and scrupulous regard to the general rules of justice, and from the most conscien∣tious dread, either of wronging his neighbour, or of violating the integrity of his own cha∣racter. It is the end of jurisprudence to pre∣scribe rules for the decisions of judges and arbiters. It is the end of casuistry to prescribe rules for the conduct of a good man. By observing all the rules of jurisprudence, sup∣posing
<PB N="528" REF="521"/>
them ever so perfect, we should deserve nothing but to be free from external punish∣ment. By observing those of casuistry, sup∣posing them such as they ought to be, we should be entitled to considerable praise by the exact and scrupulous delicacy of our be∣haviour.</P>
<P>It may frequently happen that a good man ought to think himself bound, from a sacred and conscientious regard to the general rules of justice, to perform many things which it would be the highest injustice to extort from him, or for any judge or arbiter to impose up∣on him by force. To give a trite example; a highway-man, by the fear of death, ob∣liges a traveller to promise him a certain sum of money. Whether such a promise, extort∣ed in this manner by unjust force, ought to be regarded as obligatory, is a question that has been very much debated.</P>
<P>If we consider it meerly as a question of jurisprudence, the decision can admit of no doubt. It would be absurd to suppose that the highway-man can be entitled to use force to constrain the other to perform. To ex∣tort the promise was a crime that deserved the highest punishment, and to extort the per∣formance would only be adding a new crime
<PB N="529" REF="522"/>
to the former. He can complain of no inju∣ry who has only been deceived by the person by whom he might justly have been killed. To suppose that a judge ought to enforce the obligation of such promises, or that the ma∣gistrate ought to allow them to sustain action at law, would be the most ridiculous of all ab∣surdities. If we consider this question, there∣fore, as a question of jurisprudence we can be at no loss about the decision.</P>
<P>But if we consider it as a question of casu∣istry, it will not be so easily determined. Whether a good man from a conscientious regard to that most sacred rule of justice, which commands the observance of all seri∣ous promises, would not think himself bound to perform, is at least much more doubtful. That no regard is due to the disappointment of the wretch who brings him into this situa∣tion, that no injury is done to the robber, and consequently that nothing can be extorted by force, will admit of no sort of dispute. But whether some regard is not, in this case, due to his own dignity and honour, to the inviolable sacredness of that part of his cha∣racter which makes him reverence the law of truth and abhor every thing that ap∣proaches to treachery and falsehood, may,
<PB N="530" REF="523"/>
perhaps, more reasonably be made a question. The casuists accordingly are greatly divided about it. One party, with whom we may count Cicero among the antients, among the moderns, Puffendorf, Barbeyrac his commen∣tator, and above all the late Dr. Hutcheson, one who in most cases was by no means a loose casuist, determine, without any hesita∣tion, that no sort of regard is due to any such promise, and that to think otherwise is meer weakness and superstition. Another party, among whom we may reckon <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">St. Augustine, la Placette.</NOTE> some of the antient fathers of the church, as well as some very eminent modern casuists, have been of another opinion, and have judged all such promises obligatory.</P>
<P>If we consider the matter according to the common sentiments of mankind, we shall find that some regard would be thought due even to a promise of this kind; but that it is impossible to determine how much, by any general rule that will apply to all cases with∣out exception. The man who was quite frank and easy in making promises of this kind, and who violated them with as little ceremony, we should not chuse for our friend and com∣panion.
<PB N="531" REF="524"/>
A gentleman who should promise a highway-man five pounds and not perform would incur some blame. If the sum pro∣mised, however, was very great, it might be more doubtful, what was proper to be done. If it was such, for example, that the payment of it would entirely ruin the family of the promiser, if it was so great as to be sufficient for promoting the most useful pur∣poses, it would appear in some measure cri∣minal, at least extremely improper, to throw it, for the sake of a punctilio, into such worth∣less hands. The man who should beggar himself, or who should throw away a hun∣dred thousand pounds, tho' he could af∣ford that vast sum, for the sake of observ∣ing such a parole with a thief, would appear to the common sense of mankind absurd and extravagant in the highest degree. Such pro∣fusion would seem inconsistent with his duty, with what he owed both to himself and others, and what, therefore, regard to a pro∣mise extorted in this manner, could by no means authorize. To fix, however, by any precise rule, what degree of regard ought to be paid to it, or what might be the greatest sum which could be due from it, is evident∣ly impossible. This would vary according to
<PB N="532" REF="525"/>
the characters of the persons, according to their circumstances, according to the solem∣nity of the promise, and even according to the incidents of the rencounter: and if the promiser had been treated with a great deal of that sort of gallantry, which is sometimes to be met with in persons of the most aban∣doned characters, more would seem due than upon other occasions. It may be said in ge∣neral, that exact propriety requires the obser∣vance of all such promises, wherever it is not inconsistent with some other duties that are more sacred; such as regard to the public interest, to those whom gratitude, whom natural affection, or whom the laws of proper beneficence should prompt us to provide for. But, as was formerly taken notice of, we have no precise rules to determine what ex∣ternal actions are due from a regard to such motives, nor, consequently, when it is that those virtues are inconsistent with the obser∣vance of such promises.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, however, that when∣ever such promises are violated, tho' for the most necessary reasons, it is always with some degree of dishonour to the person who made them. After they are made, we may be con∣vinced of the impropriety of observing them.
<PB N="533" REF="526"/>
But still there is some fault in having made them. It is at least a departure from the highest and noblest maxims of magnanimity and ho∣nour. A brave man ought to die, rather than make a promise which he can neither keep without folly nor violate without Ignominy. For some degree of ignominy always attends a situation of this kind. Treachery and false∣hood, are vices so dangerous, so dreadful, and at the same time, such as may so easily, and, upon many occasions, so safely be indulg∣ed, that we are more jealous of them than of almost any other. Our imagination there∣fore attaches the idea of shame to all violati∣ons of faith, in every circumstance and in every situation. They resemble, in this respect, the violations of chastity in the fair sex, a virtue of which, for the like reasons, we are excessively jealous; and our sentiments are not more delicate with regard to the one, than with regard to the other. Breach of chasti∣ty dishonours irretriveably. No circumstances, no sollicitation can excuse it; no sorrow, no repentance atone for it. We are so nice in this respect that even a rape dishonours, and the innocence of the mind cannot, in our imagination, wash out the pollution of the body. It is the same case with the violation
<PB N="534" REF="527"/>
of faith, when it has been solemnly pledged, even to the most worthless of mankind. Fi∣delity is so necessary a virtue, that we appre∣hend it in general to be due even to those to whom nothing else is due, and whom we think it lawful to kill and destroy. It is to no purpose that the person who has been guilty of the breach of it, urges that he pro∣mised in order to save his life, and that he broke his promise because it was inconsistent with some other respectable duty to keep it. These circumstances may alleviate, but can∣not entirely wipe out his dishonour. He ap∣pears to have been guilty of an action with which, in the imaginations of men, some de∣gree of shame is inseparably connected. He has broke a promise which he had solemnly averred he would maintain; and his charac∣ter, if not irretrievably stained and polluted, has at least a ridicule affixed to it, which it will be very difficult entirely to efface; and no man, I imagine, who had gone thro' an ad∣venture of this kind, would be fond of telling the story.</P>
<P>This instance may serve to show wherein consists the difference between casuistry, and jurisprudence, even when both of them con∣sider
<PB N="535" REF="528"/>
the obligations of the general rules of justice.</P>
<P>But tho' this difference be real and essenti∣al, tho' those two sciences propose quite dif∣ferent ends, the sameness of the subject has made such a similarity between them, that the greater part of authors whose professed design was to treat of jurisprudence, have determined the different questions they ex∣amine, sometimes according to the principles of that science, and sometimes according to those of casuistry, without distinguishing and perhaps without being themselves aware when they did the one, and when the other.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the casuists, however, is by no means confined to the consideration of what a conscientious regard to the general rules of justice, would demand of us. It embraces many other parts of christian and moral duty. What seems principally to have given occasion to the cultivation of this species of science was the custom of auricular con∣fession, introduced by the Roman Catholic su∣perstition, in times of barbarism and igno∣rance. By that institution, the most secret actions, and even the thoughts of every per∣son, which could be suspected of receeding in the smallest degree from the rules of christi∣an
<PB N="536" REF="529"/>
purity were to be revealed to the confes∣sor. The confessor informed his penitents whether, and in what respect they had vio∣lated their duty, and what pennance it be∣hooved them to undergo, before he could ab∣solve them in the name of the offended deity.</P>
<P>The consciousness, or even the suspicion of having done wrong, is a load upon every mind, and is accompanied with anxiety and terror in all those who are not hardened by long habits of iniquity. Men, in this, as in all other distresses, are naturally eager to dis∣burden themselves of the oppression which they feel upon their thoughts, by unbosom∣ing the agony of their mind to some person whose secrecy and discretion they can confide in. The shame, which they suffer from this acknowledgment, is fully compensated by that alleviation of their uneasiness which the sympathy of their confident seldom fails to occasion. It relieves them to find that they are not altogether unworthy of regard, and that however their past conduct may be cen∣sured, their present disposition is at least ap∣proved of, and is perhaps sufficient to com∣pensate the other, at least to maintain them in some degree of esteem with their friend. A numerous and artful clergy had, in those
<PB N="537" REF="530"/>
times of superstition, insinuated themselves into the confidence of almost every private family, They possessed all the little learning which the times could afford, and their man∣ners, tho' in many respects rude and disor∣derly, were polished and regular compared with those of the age they lived in. They were regarded, therefore, not only as the great directors of all religious, but of all mo∣ral duties. Their familiarity gave reputation to whoever was so happy as to possess it, and every mark of their disapprobation stamped the deepest ignominy upon all who had the misfortune to fall under it. Being consi∣dered as the great judges of right and wrong, they were naturally consulted about all scru∣ples that occurred, and it was reputable for any person to have it known that he made those holy men the confidents of all such secrets, and took no important or delicate step in his conduct without their advice and approbation. It was not difficult for the clergy, therefore, to get it established as a ge∣neral rule, that they should be entrusted with what it had already become fashionable to entrust them, and with what they generally would have been entrusted, tho' no such rule
<PB N="538" REF="531"/>
had been established. To qualify themselves for confessors became thus a necessary part of the study of churchmen and divines, and they were thence led to collect what are called cases of conscience, nice and delicate situations in which it is hard to determine whereabouts the propriety of conduct may lie. Such works, they imagined, might be of use both to the directors of consciences and to those who were to be directed; and hence the origin of books of casuistry.</P>
<P>The moral duties which fell under the consideration of the casuists were chiefly those which can, in some measure at least, be circumscribed within general rules, and of which the violation is naturally attended with some degree of remorse and some dread of suffering punishment. The design of that institution which gave occasion to their works, was to appease those terrors of con∣science which attend upon the infringement of such duties. But it is not every virtue of which the defect is accompanied with any very severe compunctions of this kind, and no man applies to his confessor for absolu∣tion, because he did not perform the most generous, the most friendly or the most
<PB N="539" REF="532"/>
magnanimous action which, in his circum∣stances, it was possible to perform. In fai∣lures of this kind, the rule that is violated is commonly not very determinate, and is ge∣nerally of such a nature too that tho' the observance of it might entitle to honour and reward, the violation seems to expose to no positive blame, censure or punishment. The exercise of such virtues the casuists seem to have regarded as a sort of works of superero∣gation, which could not be very strictly ex∣acted, and which it was, therefore, unneces∣sary for them to treat of.</P>
<P>The breaches of moral duty, therefore, which came before the tribunal of the con∣fessor, and upon that account fell under the cognizance of the casuists, were chiefly of three different kinds.</P>
<P>First and principally breaches of the rules of justice. The rules here are all express and positive, and the violation of them is na∣turally attended with the consciousness of de∣serving, and the dread of suffering, punish∣ment both from God and man.</P>
<P>Secondly, breaches of the rules of chastity. These in all grosser instances are real breaches of the rules of justice, and no person can be
<PB N="540" REF="533"/>
guilty of them without doing the most un∣pardonable injury to some other. In smaller instances, when they amount only to a vio∣lation of those exact decorums which ought to be observed in the conversation of the two sexes, they cannot indeed justly be con∣sidered as violations of the rules of justice. They are generally, however, violations of a pretty plain rule, and, at least in one of the sexes, tend to bring ignominy upon the per∣son who has been guilty of them, and con∣sequently to be attended in the scrupulous with some degree of shame and contrition of mind.</P>
<P>Thirdly, breaches of the rules of veracity. The violation of truth, it is to be observed, is not always a breach of justice, tho' it is so upon many occasions, and consequently can not always expose to any external punish∣ment. The vice of common lying, tho' a most miserable meanness, may frequently do hurt to no person, and in this case no claim of vengeance or satisfaction can be due either to the persons imposed upon or to others. But though the violation of truth is not al∣ways a breach of justice, it is always a breach of a very plain rule, and what naturally tends
<PB N="541" REF="534"/>
to cover with shame the person who has been guilty of it. The great pleasure of conver∣sation, and indeed of society, arises from a certain correspondence of sentiments and opi∣nions, from a certain harmony of minds, which like so many musical instruments co∣incide and keep time with one another. But this most delightful harmony cannot be ob∣tained unless there is a free communication of sentiments and opinions. We all desire, upon this account, to feel how each other is affected, to penetrate into each others bosoms and to observe the sentiments and affections which really subsist there. The man who indulges us in this natural passion, who in∣vites us into his heart, who, as it were, sets open the gates of his breast to us, seems to exercise a species of hospitality more delight∣ful than any other. No man, who is in or∣dinary good temper, can fail of pleasing if he has the courage to utter his real sentiments as he feels them, and because he feels them. It is this unreserved sincerity which renders even the prattle of a child agreeable. How weak and imperfect soever the views of the open-hearted, we take pleasure to enter into them, and endeavour, as much as we can,
<PB N="542" REF="535"/>
to bring down our own understanding, to the level of their capacities, and to regard every subject in the particular light in which they appear to have considered it. This passion to discover the real sentiments of others is naturally so strong, that it often degenerates into a troublesome and impertinent curiosity to pry into those secrets of our neighbours which they have very justifiable reasons for concealing, and, upon many occasions, it re∣quires prudence and a strong sense of pro∣priety to govern this, as well as all the other passions of human nature, and to reduce it to that pitch which any impartial spectator can approve of. To disappoint this curiosity, however, when it is kept within proper bounds, and aims at nothing which there can be any just reason for concealing, is equally disagreeable in its turn. The man who eludes our most innocent questions, who gives no satisfaction to our most inoffensive inquiries, who plainly wraps himself up in impenetrable obscurity, seems, as it were, to build a wall about his breast. We run for∣ward to get within it, with all the eagerness of harmless curiosity, and feel ourselves all at once pushed back with the rudest and most
<PB N="543" REF="536"/>
offensive violence. If to conceal is so dis∣agreeable, to attempt to deceive us is still more disgusting, even tho' we could possibly suffer nothing by the success of the fraud. If we see that our companion wants to im∣pose upon us, if the sentiments and opinions which he utters appear evidently not to be his own, let them be ever so fine, we can derive no sort of entertainment from them; and if something of human nature did not now and then transpire through all the covers which falshood and affectation are capable of wraping around it, a puppet of wood would be altogether as pleasant a companion as a person who never spoke as he was affected. No man ever deceives, with regard to the most insignificant matters, who is not con∣scious of doing something like an injury to those he converses with; and who does not inwardly blush and shrink back with shame and confusion even at the secret thought of a detection. Breach of veracity, therefore, be∣ing always attended with some degree of re∣morse and self-condemnation, naturally fell under the cognizance of the casuists.</P>
<P>The chief subjects of the works of the casuists, therefore, were the conscientious
<PB N="544" REF="537"/>
regard that is due to the rules of justice; how far we ought to respect the life and property of our neighbour; the duty of re∣stitution; the laws of chastity and modesty, and wherein consisted what, in their lan∣guage are called the sins of concupiscence: the rules of veracity and the obligation of oaths, promises and contracts of all kinds.</P>
<P>It may be said in general of the works of the casuists that they attempted, to no purpose, to direct by precise Rules what it belongs to feeling and sentiment only to judge of. How is it possible to ascertain by rules the exact point at which, in every case, a delicate sense of justice begins to run into a frivolous and weak scrupulosity of consci∣ence? When it is that secrecy and reserve begin to grow into dissimulation? How far an agreeable irony may be carried, and at what precise point it begins to degenerate into a detestable lie? What is the highest pitch of freedom and ease of behaviour which can be regarded as graceful and be∣coming, and when it is that it first begins to run into a negligent and thoughtless licen∣tiousness? With regard to all such matters, what would hold good in any one case
<PB N="545" REF="538"/>
would scarce do so exactly in any other, and what constitutes the propriety and happiness of behaviour varies in every case with the smallest variety of situation. Books of ca∣suistry, therefore, are generally as useless as they are commonly tiresome. They could be of little use to one who should consult them upon occasion, even supposing their de∣cisions to be just; because, notwithstanding the multitude of cases collected in them, yet upon account of the still greater variety of possible circumstances, it is a chance, if among all those cases there be found one ex∣actly parallel to that under consideration. One, who is really anxious to do his duty, must be very weak, if he can imagine that he has much occasion for them; and with regard to one who is negligent of it, the stile of those writings is not such as is likely to awaken him to more attention. None of them tend to animate us to what is generous and noble. None of them tend to soften us to what is gentle and humane. Many of them, on the contrary, tend rather to teach us to chicane with our own consciences, and by their vain subtilties serve to authorise in∣numerable evasive refinements with regard
<PB N="546" REF="539"/>
to the most essential articles of our duty. That frivolous accuracy which they at∣tempted to introduce into subjects which do not admit of it, almost necessarily betrayed them into those dangerous errors, and at the same time rendered their works dry and dis∣agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, abounding in abstruse and meta∣physical distinctions, but incapable of ex∣citing in the heart any of those emotions which it is the principal use of books of morality to excite.</P>
<P>The two useful parts of moral philosophy, therefore, are Ethics and Jurisprudence: casuistry ought to be rejected altogether, and the ancient moralists appear to have judged much better, who, in treating of the same subjects, did not affect any such nice exact∣ness, but contented themselves with describ∣ing in a general manner, what is the senti∣ment upon which justice, modesty and vera∣sity are founded, and what is the ordinary way of acting to which those virtues would commonly prompt us.</P>
<P>Something, indeed, not unlike the doctrine of the casuists, seems to have been attempted by several philosophers. There is something of this kind in the third book of Cicero's of∣fices,
<PB N="547" REF="540"/>
where he endeavours like a casuist to give rules for our conduct in many nice cases, in which it is difficult to determine where∣abouts the point of propriety may lie. It appears too, from many passages in the same book, that several other philosophers had at∣tempted something of the same kind before him. Neither he nor they, however, ap∣pear to have aimed at giving a compleat system of this sort, but only meant to show how situations may occur, in which it is doubtful, whether the highest propriety of conduct consists in observing or in receeding from what, in ordinary cases, are the rules of duty.</P>
<P>Every system of positive law may be regarded as a more or less imperfect attempt towards a system of natural jurisprudence, or towards an enumeration of the particular rules of justice. As the violation of justice is what men will never submit to from one another, the publick magistrate is under a necessity of employing the power of the commonwealth to enforce the practice of this virtue. With∣out this precaution, civil society would be∣come a scene of bloodshed and disorder, every man revenging himself at his own hand whenever he fancied he was injured.
<PB N="548" REF="541"/>
To prevent the confusion which would at∣tend upon every man's doing justice to him∣self, the magistrate, in all governments that have acquired any considerable authority, undertakes to do justice to all, and promises to hear and to redress every complaint of in∣jury. In all well-governed states too not only judges are appointed for determining the controversies of individuals, but rules are prescribed for regulating the decisions of those judges; and these rules are, in gene∣ral, intended to coincide with those of natu∣ral justice. It does not, indeed, always hap∣pen that they do so in every instance. Some∣times what is called the constitution of the state, that is, the interest of the government; sometimes the interest of particular orders of men who tyrannize the government, warp the positive laws of the country from what na∣tural justice would prescribe. In some countries, the rudeness and barbarism of the people hinder the natural sentiments of justice from arriving at that accuracy and precision which, in more civi∣lised nations, they naturally attain to. Their laws are like their manners gross and rude and undistinguishing. In other countries the unfortunate constitution of their courts of judicature hinders any regular system of juris∣prudence
<PB N="549" REF="542"/>
from ever establishing itself among them, tho' the improved manners of the people may be such as would admit of the most accurate. In no country do the deci∣sions of positive law coincide exactly in every case with the rules which the natural sense of justice would dictate. Systems of positive law, therefore, tho' they deserve the greatest authority as the records of the sentiments of mankind in different ages and nations, yet can never be regarded as accurate systems of the rules of natural justice.</P>
<P>It might have been expected that the rea∣sonings of lawyers upon the different imper∣fections and improvements of the laws of dif∣ferent countries, should have given occasion to an enquiry into what were the natural rules of justice, independent of all positive in∣stitution. It might have been expected that these reasonings should have led them to aim at establishing a system of what might pro∣perly be called natural jurisprudence, or a theory of the general principles which ought to run through and be the foundation of the laws of all nations. But tho' the reasonings of lawyers did produce something of this
<PB N="550" REF="543"/>
kind, and though no man has treated systema∣tically of the laws of any particular country, without intermixing in his work many ob∣servations of this sort; it was very late in the world before any such general system was thought of, or before the philosophy of law was treated of by itself, and without re∣gard to the particular institutions of any one nation. In none of the ancient moralists, do we find any attempt towards a particular enu∣meration of the rules of justice. Cicero in his offices, and Aristotle in his ethics, treat of justice in the same general manner in which they treat of all the other virtues. In the laws of Cicero and Plato, where we might naturally have expected some attempts to∣wards an enumeration of those rules of natu∣ral equity, which ought to be enforced by the positive laws of every country, there is, however, nothing of this kind. Their laws are laws of police not of justice. Grotius seems to have been the first who attempted to give the world any thing like a system of those principles which ought to run thro', and be the foundation of the laws of all na∣tions; and his treatise of the laws of war and peace, with all its imperfections, is per∣haps
<PB N="551" REF="544"/>
at this day the most compleat work that has yet been given upon this subject. I shall in another discourse endeavour to give an ac∣count of the general principles of law and government, and of the different revolu∣tions they have undergone in the different ages and periods of society, not only in what concerns justice but in what concerns po∣lice, revenue and arms, and whatever else is the object of law. I shall not, therefore, at present enter into any further detail con∣cerning the history of jurisprudence.</P>
