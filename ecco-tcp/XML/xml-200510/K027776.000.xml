<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of the following production is briefly
this. A lady, fond of blank verse, demanded
a poem of that kind from the author, and gave him
the SOFA for a subject. He obeyed; and having
much leisure, connected another subject with it;
and pursuing the train of thought to which his situa∣tion
and turn of mind led him, brought forth at
length, instead of the trifle which he at first intend∣ed,
a serious affair—a Volume.</P>
<P>In the poem, on the subject of education
he would be very sorry to stand suspected of having
aimed his censure at any particular school. His ob∣jections
are such as naturally apply themselves to schools
in general. If there were not, as for the most part
there is, wilful neglect in those who manage them, and
<PB REF="4"/>
an omission even of such discipline as they are suscepti∣ble
of, the objects are yet too numerous for minute at∣tention;
and the aching hearts of ten thousand parents
mourning under the bitterest of all disappointments, at∣test
the truth of the allegation. His quarrel therefore is
with the mischief at large, and not with any particular
instance of it,</P>

<HEAD>THE SOFA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I SING the SOFA. I who lately sang</L>
<L>Truth, Hope and Charity, and touch'd with awe</L>
<L>The solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,</L>
<L>Escap'd with pain from that advent'rous flight,</L>
<L>Now seek repose upon an humbler theme;</L>
<L>The theme though humble, yet august and proud</L>
<L>Th' occasion—for the Fair commands the song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time was, when cloathing sumptuous or for use,</L>
<L>Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.</L>
<L>As yet black breeches were not; sattin smooth,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:</L>
<L>The hardy chief upon the rugged rock</L>
<L>Wash'd by the sea, or on the grav'ly bank</L>
<L>Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,</L>
<L>Fearless of wrong, repos'd his weary strength.</L>
<L>Those barb'rous ages past, succeeded next</L>
<L>The birth-day of invention, weak at first,</L>
<L>Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.</L>
<L>Joint-stools were then created; on three legs</L>
<L>Upborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm</L>
<L>A massy slab, in fashion square or round.</L>
<L>On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,</L>
<L>And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms;</L>
<L>And such in ancient halls and mansions drear</L>
<L>May still be seen, but perforated sore</L>
<L>And drill'd in holes the solid oak is found,</L>
<L>By worms voracious eating through and through.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length a generation more refined</L>
<L>Improv'd the simple plan, made three legs four,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Gave them a twisted form vermicular,</L>
<L>And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuff'd</L>
<L>Induced a splendid cover green and blue,</L>
<L>Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought</L>
<L>And woven close, or needle-work sublime.</L>
<L>There might ye see the pioney spread wide,</L>
<L>The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,</L>
<L>Lap-dog and lambkin with black staring eyes,</L>
<L>And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now came the cane from India, smooth and bright</L>
<L>With Nature's varnish; sever'd into stripes</L>
<L>That interlaced each other, these supplied</L>
<L>Of texture firm a lattice work, that braced</L>
<L>The new machine, and it became a chair.</L>
<L>But restless was the chair; the back erect</L>
<L>Distress'd the weary loins that felt no ease;</L>
<L>The slipp'ry seat betray'd the sliding part</L>
<L>That press'd it, and the feet hung dangling down,</L>
<L>Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>
These for the rich: the rest, whom fate had placed</L>
<L>In modest mediocrity, content</L>
<L>With base materials, sat on well tann'd hides</L>
<L>Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,</L>
<L>With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,</L>
<L>Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixt:</L>
<L>If cushion might be call'd, what harder seem'd</L>
<L>Than the firm oak of which the frame was form'd.</L>
<L>No want of timber then was felt or fear'd</L>
<L>In Albion's happy isle. The umber stood</L>
<L>Pond'rous, and fixt by its own massy weight.</L>
<L>But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,</L>
<L>An Alderman of Cripplegate contrived,</L>
<L>And some ascribe the invention to a priest</L>
<L>Burly and big and studious of his ease.</L>
<L>But rude at first, and not with easy slope</L>
<L>Receding wide, they press'd against the ribs,</L>
<L>And bruised the side, and elevated high</L>
<L>Taught the rais'd shoulders to invade the ears.</L>
<L>Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Complain'd, though incommodiously pent in,</L>
<L>And ill at ease behind. The Ladies first</L>
<L>'Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.</L>
<L>Ingenious fancy, never better pleas'd</L>
<L>Than when employ'd t' accommodate the fair,</L>
<L>Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised</L>
<L>The soft settee; one elbow at each end,</L>
<L>And in the midst an elbow, it receiv'd</L>
<L>United yet divided, twain at once.</L>
<L>So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne;</L>
<L>And so two citizens who take the air</L>
<L>Close pack'd and smiling in a chaise and one.</L>
<L>But relaxation of the languid frame</L>
<L>By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,</L>
<L>Was bliss reserved for happier days. So slow</L>
<L>The growth of what is excellent, so hard</L>
<L>T'attain perfection in this nether world.</L>
<L>Thus first necessity invented stools,</L>
<L>Convenience next suggested elbow chairs,</L>
<L>And luxury th' accomplished Sofa last.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<L>The nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sick</L>
<L>Whom snoring she disturbs. As sweetly he</L>
<L>Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour</L>
<L>To sleep within the carriage more secure,</L>
<L>His legs depending at the open door.</L>
<L>Sweet sleep enjoys the Curate in his desk,</L>
<L>The tedious Rector drawling o'er his head,</L>
<L>And sweet the Clerk below: but neither sleep</L>
<L>Of lazy Nurse, who snores the sick man dead,</L>
<L>Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour</L>
<L>To slumber in the carriage more secure,</L>
<L>Nor sleep enjoy'd by Curate in his desk,</L>
<L>Nor yet the dozings of the Clerk are sweet,</L>
<L>Compared with the repose the SOFA yields.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh may I live exempted (while I live</L>
<L>Guiltless of pamper'd appetite obscene)</L>
<L>From pangs arthritic that infest the toe</L>
<L>Of libertine excess. The SOFA suits</L>
<L>The gouty limb, 'tis true; but gouty limb</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Though on a SOFA, may I never feel:</L>
<L>For I have loved the rural walk through lanes</L>
<L>Of grassy swarth close cropt by nibbling sheep,</L>
<L>And skirted thick with intertexture firm</L>
<L>Of thorny boughs: have loved the rural walk</L>
<L>O'er hills, through valleys, and by rivers brink,</L>
<L>E'er since a truant boy I pass'd my bounds</L>
<L>T'enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames.</L>
<L>And still remember, nor without regret</L>
<L>Of hours that sorrow since has much endear'd,</L>
<L>How oft, my slice of pocket store consumed,</L>
<L>Still hung'ring pennyless and far from home,</L>
<L>I fed on scarlet hips and stoney haws,</L>
<L>Or blushing crabs, or berries that imboss</L>
<L>The bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere.</L>
<L>Hard fare! but such as boyish appetite</L>
<L>Disdains not, nor the palate undepraved</L>
<L>By culinary arts, unsav'ry deems.</L>
<L>No SOFA then awaited my return,</L>
<L>Nor SOFA then I needed. Youth repairs</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="13"/>
His wasted spirits quickly, by long toil</L>
<L>Incurring short fatigue; and though our years</L>
<L>As life declines, speed rapidly away,</L>
<L>And not a year but pilfers as he goes</L>
<L>Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep,</L>
<L>A tooth or auburn lock, and by degrees</L>
<L>Their length and color from the locks they spare;</L>
<L>Th' elastic spring of an unwearied foot</L>
<L>That mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence,</L>
<L>That play of lungs inhaling and again</L>
<L>Respiring freely the fresh air, that makes</L>
<L>Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me,</L>
<L>Mine have not pilfer'd yet; nor yet impair'd</L>
<L>My relish of fair prospect; scenes that sooth'd</L>
<L>Or charm'd me young, no longer young, I find</L>
<L>Still soothing and of power to charm me still.</L>
<L>And witness, dear companion of my walks,</L>
<L>Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive</L>
<L>Fast lock'd in mine, with pleasure such as love</L>
<L>Confirm'd by long experience of thy worth</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
And well-tried virtues could alone inspire—</L>
<L>Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long.</L>
<L>Thou know'st my praise of nature most sincere,</L>
<L>And that my raptures are not conjured up</L>
<L>To serve occasions of poetic pomp,</L>
<L>But genuine, and art partner of them all.</L>
<L>How oft upon yon eminence, our pace</L>
<L>Has slacken'd to a pause, and we have borne</L>
<L>The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew,</L>
<L>While admiration feeding at the eye,</L>
<L>And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene.</L>
<L>Thence with what pleasure have we just discern'd</L>
<L>The distant plough slow-moving, and beside</L>
<L>His lab'ring team that swerv'd not from the track,</L>
<L>The sturdy swain diminish'd to a boy!</L>
<L>Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain</L>
<L>Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er,</L>
<L>Conducts the eye along his sinuous course</L>
<L>Delighted. There, fast rooted in his bank</L>
<L>Stand, never overlook'd, our fav'rite elms</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="15"/>
That screen the herdsman's solitary hut;</L>
<L>While far beyond and overthwart the stream</L>
<L>That as with molten glass inlays the vale,</L>
<L>The sloping land recedes into the clouds;</L>
<L>Displaying on its varied side, the grace</L>
<L>Of hedge-row beauties numberless, square tow'r,</L>
<L>Tall spire, from which the sound of chearful bells</L>
<L>Just undulates upon the list'ning ear;</L>
<L>Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.</L>
<L>Scenes must be beautiful which daily view'd</L>
<L>Please daily, and whose novelty survives</L>
<L>Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years.</L>
<L>Praise justly due to those that I describe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor rural sights alone, but rural sounds</L>
<L>Exhilarate the spirit, and restore</L>
<L>The tone of languid Nature. Mighty winds</L>
<L>That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood</L>
<L>Of ancient growth, make music not unlike</L>
<L>The dash of ocean on his winding shore,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd branches waving in the blast,</L>
<L>And all their leaves fast flutt'ring, all at once.</L>
<L>Nor less composure waits upon the roar</L>
<L>Of distant floods, or on the softer voice</L>
<L>Of neighb'ring fountain, or of rills that slip</L>
<L>Through the cleft rock, and chiming as they fall</L>
<L>Upon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length</L>
<L>In matted grass, that with a livelier green</L>
<L>Betrays the secret of their silent course.</L>
<L>Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds,</L>
<L>But animated Nature sweeter still</L>
<L>To sooth and satisfy the human ear.</L>
<L>Ten thousand warblers chear the day, and one</L>
<L>The live-long night: nor these alone whose notes</L>
<L>Nice-finger'd art must emulate in vain,</L>
<L>But cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime</L>
<L>In still repeated circles, screaming loud,</L>
<L>The jay, the pie, and ev'n the boding owl</L>
<L>That hails the rising moon, have charms for me.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="17"/>
Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,</L>
<L>Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,</L>
<L>And only there, please highly for their sake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Peace to the artist, whose ingenious thought</L>
<L>Devised the weather-house, that useful toy!</L>
<L>Fearless of humid air and gathering rains</L>
<L>Forth steps the man, an emblem of myself,</L>
<L>More delicate his tim'rous mate retires.</L>
<L>When Winter soaks the fields, and female feet</L>
<L>Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay,</L>
<L>Or ford the rivulets, are best at home,</L>
<L>The task of new discov'ries falls on me.</L>
<L>At such a season and with such a charge</L>
<L>Once went I forth, and found, till then unknown,</L>
<L>A cottage, whither oft we since repair:</L>
<L>'Tis perch'd upon the green-hill top, but close</L>
<L>Inviron'd with a ring of branching elms</L>
<L>That overhang the thatch, itself unseen,</L>
<L>Peeps at the vale below; so thick beset</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>
With foliage of such dark redundant growth,</L>
<L>I call'd the low-roof'd lodge the <HI>peasant's nest.</HI></L>
<L>And hidden as it is, and far remote</L>
<L>From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear</L>
<L>In village or in town, the bay of curs</L>
<L>Incessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels,</L>
<L>And infants clam'rous whether pleas'd or pain'd,</L>
<L>Oft have I wish'd the peaceful covert mine.</L>
<L>Here, I have said, at least I should possess</L>
<L>The poet's treasure, silence, and indulge</L>
<L>The dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure.</L>
<L>Vain thought! the dweller in that still retreat</L>
<L>Dearly obtains the refuge it affords.</L>
<L>Its elevated scite forbids the wretch</L>
<L>Yo drink sweet waters of the chrystal well;</L>
<L>He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch,</L>
<L>And heavy-laden brings his bev'rage home</L>
<L>Far-fetch'd and little worth; nor seldom waits,</L>
<L>Dependent on the baker's punctual call,</L>
<L>To hear his creaking panniers at the door,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>
Angry and sad and his last crust consumed.</L>
<L>So farewel envy of the <HI>peasant's nest.</HI></L>
<L>If solitude make scant the means of life,</L>
<L>Society for me! thou seeming sweet,</L>
<L>Be still a pleasing object in my view,</L>
<L>My visit still, but never mine abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not distant far, a length of colonade</L>
<L>Invites us. Monument of ancient taste,</L>
<L>Now scorn'd, but worthy of a better fate.</L>
<L>Our fathers knew the value of a screen</L>
<L>From sultry suns, and in their shaded walks</L>
<L>And long-protracted bow'rs, enjoy'd at noon</L>
<L>The gloom and coolness of declining day.</L>
<L>We bear our shades about us; self depriv'd</L>
<L>Of other screen, the thin umbrella spread,</L>
<L>And range an Indian waste without a tree.</L>
<L>Thanks to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Courtney Throckmorton, Esq. of Weston Underwood.</NOTE> Benevolus—he spares me yet</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="20"/>
These chesnuts ranged in corresponding lines,</L>
<L>And though himself so polish'd, still reprieves</L>
<L>The obsolete prolixity of shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Descending now (but cautious, lest too fast)</L>
<L>A sudden steep, upon a rustic bridge</L>
<L>We pass a gulph in which the willows dip</L>
<L>Their pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink.</L>
<L>Hence ancle deep in moss and flow'ry thyme</L>
<L>We mount again, and feel at ev'ry step</L>
<L>Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft,</L>
<L>Rais'd by the mole, the miner of the soil.</L>
<L>He not unlike the great ones of mankind,</L>
<L>Disfigures earth, and plotting in the dark</L>
<L>Toils much to earn a monumental pile,</L>
<L>That may record the mischiefs he has done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The summit gain'd, behold the proud alcove</L>
<L>That crowns it! yet not all its pride secures</L>
<L>The grand retreat from injuries impress'd</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21"/>
By rural carvers, who with knives deface</L>
<L>The pannels, leaving an obscure rude name</L>
<L>In characters uncouth, and spelt amiss.</L>
<L>So strong the zeal t' immortalize himself</L>
<L>Beats in the breast of man, that ev'n a few</L>
<L>Few transient years won from th' abyss abhorr'd</L>
<L>Of blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize,</L>
<L>And even to a clown. Now roves the eye,</L>
<L>And posted on this speculative height</L>
<L>Exults in its command. The sheep-fold here</L>
<L>Pours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe.</L>
<L>At first, progressive as a stream, they seek</L>
<L>The middle field; but scatter'd by degrees</L>
<L>Each to his choice, soon whiten all the land.</L>
<L>There, from the sun-burnt hay-field homeward creeps</L>
<L>The loaded wain, while lighten'd of its charge</L>
<L>The wain that meets it, passes swiftly by,</L>
<L>The boorish driver leaning o'er his team</L>
<L>Vocif'rous, and impatient of delay.</L>
<L>Nor less attractive is the woodland scene</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>
Diversified with trees of ev'ry growth</L>
<L>Alike yet various. Here the grey smooth trunks</L>
<L>Of ash or lime, or beech, distinctly shine,</L>
<L>Within the twilight of their distant shades;</L>
<L>There lost behind a rising ground, the wood</L>
<L>Seems sunk, and shorten'd to its topmost boughs.</L>
<L>No tree in all the grove but has its charms,</L>
<L>Though each its hue peculiar; paler some,</L>
<L>And of a wannish grey; the willow such</L>
<L>And poplar, that with silver lines his leaf,</L>
<L>And ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm.</L>
<L>Of deeper green the elm; and deeper still,</L>
<L>Lord of the woods, the long-surviving oak.</L>
<L>Some glossy-leav'd and shining in the sun,</L>
<L>The maple, and the beech of oily nuts</L>
<L>Prolific, and the lime at dewy eve</L>
<L>Diffusing odors: nor unnoted pass</L>
<L>The sycamore, capricious in attire,</L>
<L>Now green, now tawny, and 'ere autumn yet</L>
<L>Have changed the woods, in scarlet honors bright.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="23"/>
O'er these, but far beyond, (a spacious map</L>
<L>Of hill and valley interpos'd between)</L>
<L>The Ouse, dividing the well water'd land,</L>
<L>Now glitters in the sun, and now retires,</L>
<L>As bashful, yet impatient to be seen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence the declivity is sharp and short,</L>
<L>And such the re-ascent; between them weeps</L>
<L>A little Naiad her impov'rish'd urn</L>
<L>All summer long, which winter fills again.</L>
<L>The folded gates would bar my progress now,</L>
<L>But that the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the foregoing note.</NOTE> Lord of this inclosed demesne,</L>

<L>Refreshing change! where now the blazing sun?</L>

<L>And stepp'd at once into a cooler clime.</L>
<L>Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="24"/>
Your fate unmerited, once more rejoice</L>
<L>That yet a remnant of your race survives.</L>
<L>How airy and how light the graceful arch,</L>
<L>Yet awful as the consecrated roof</L>
<L>Re-echoing pious anthems! while beneath</L>
<L>The chequer'd earth seems restless as a flood</L>
<L>Brush'd by the wind. So sportive is the light</L>

<L>Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,</L>
<L>And darkning and enlightning, as the leaves</L>
<L>Play wanton, ev'ry moment, ev'ry spot.</L>

<LG>
<L>And now with nerves new-brac'd and spirits chear'd</L>
<L>We tread the wilderness, whose well-roll'd walks</L>
<L>With curvature of slow and easy sweep,</L>
<L>Deception innocent—give ample space</L>
<L>To narrow bounds. The grove receives us next;</L>
<L>Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms</L>
<L>We may discern the thresher at his task.</L>
<L>Thump after thump, resounds the constant flail,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="25"/>
That seems to swing uncertain, and yet falls</L>
<L>Full on the destin'd ear. Wide flies the chaff,</L>
<L>The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist</L>

<L>Come hither, ye that press your beds of down</L>

<L>He that negotiates between God and man,</L>

<L>Of man's occasions, when in him reside</L>
<L>Grace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathom'd store?</L>

<L>In colleges and halls, in ancient days,</L>
<L>When learning, virtue, piety and truth</L>
<L>Were precious, and inculcated with care,</L>
<L>There dwelt a sage call'd Discipline. His head</L>
<L>Not yet by time completely silver'd o'er,</L>
<L>Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,</L>
<L>But strong for service still, and unimpair'd.</L>
<L>His eye was meek and gentle, and a smile</L>
<L>Play'd on his lips, and in his speech was heard</L>
<L>Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="85"/>
The occupation dearest to his heart</L>
<L>Was to encourage goodness. He would stroke</L>
<L>The head of modest and ingenuous worth</L>
<L>That blush'd at its own praise, and press the youth</L>
<L>Close to his side that pleas'd him. Learning grew</L>
<L>Beneath his care, a thriving vig'rous plant;</L>
<L>The mind was well inform'd, the passions held</L>
<L>Subordinate, and diligence was choice.</L>
<L>If e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,</L>
<L>That one among so many overleap'd</L>
<L>The limits of controul, his gentle eye</L>
<L>Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke;</L>
<L>His frown was full of terror, and his voice</L>
<L>Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe</L>
<L>As left him not, till penitence had won</L>
<L>Lost favor back again, and closed the breach.</L>
<L>But discipline, a faithful servant long,</L>
<L>Declined at length into the vale of years;</L>
<L>A palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eye</L>
<L>Was quench'd in rheums of age, his voice unstrung</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="86"/>
Grew tremulous, and moved derision more</L>
<L>Than rev'rence, in perverse rebellious youth.</L>
<L>So colleges and halls neglected much</L>
<L>Their good old friend, and Discipline at length</L>
<L>O'erlook'd and unemploy'd, fell sick and died.</L>
<L>Then study languish'd, emulation slept,</L>
<L>And virtue fled. The schools became a scene</L>
<L>Of solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts,</L>
<L>His cap well lined with logic not his own,</L>
<L>With parrot tongue perform'd the scholar's part,</L>
<L>Proceeding soon a graduated dunce.</L>
<L>Then compromise had place, and scrutiny</L>
<L>Became stone-blind, precedence went in truck,</L>
<L>And he was competent whose purse was so.</L>
<L>A dissolution of all bonds ensued,</L>
<L>The curbs invented for the muleish mouth</L>
<L>Of head-strong youth were broken; bars and bolts</L>

<L>A mock'ry of the world. What need of these</L>

<L>Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oft'ner seen</L>
<L>With belted waist and pointers at their heels,</L>

<L>If aught was learn'd in childhood, is forgot,</L>
<L>And such expence as pinches parents blue,</L>
<L>And mortifies the lib'ral hand of love,</L>
<L>Is squander'd in pursuit of idle sports</L>
<L>And vicious pleasures. Buys the boy a name,</L>
<L>That sits a stigma on his father's house,</L>
<L>And cleaves through life inseparably close</L>
<L>To him that wears it. What can atter-games</L>
<L>Of riper joys, and commerce with the world,</L>
<L>The lewd vain world that must receive him soon,</L>
<L>Add to such erudition thus acquir'd</L>

<L>Through want of care, or her whose winking eye</L>
<L>And slumb'ring oscitancy marrs the brood?</L>
<L>The nurse no doubt. Regardless of her charge</L>
<L>She needs herself correction. Needs to learn</L>

<L>Of what is excellent in man, they thirst</L>
<L>With such a zeal to be what they approve,</L>
<L>That no restraints can circumscribe them more,</L>
<L>Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake.</L>
<L>Nor can example hurt them. What they see</L>
<L>Of vice in others but enhancing more</L>
<L>The charms of virtue in their just esteem.</L>

<L>Some note of Nature's music from his lips,</L>
<L>And covetous of Shakespeare's beauty seen</L>
<L>In ev'ry flash of his far-beaming eye.</L>
<L>Nor taste alone and well contrived display</L>
<L>Suffice to give the marshall'd ranks the grace</L>

<L>Unsung, and many cares are yet behind</L>
<L>And more laborious. Cares on which depends</L>
<L>Their vigor, injured soon, not soon restored.</L>
<L>The soil must be renew'd, which often wash'd</L>
<L>Loses its treasure of salubrious salts,</L>
<L>And disappoints the roots; the slender roots</L>

<L>Well they reward the toil. The sight is pleased,</L>

<L>Its gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.</L>

<L>So manifold, all pleasing in their kind,</L>
<L>All healthful, are th' employs of rural life,</L>
<L>Reiterated as the wheel of time</L>
<L>Runs round, still ending, and beginning still.</L>
<L>Nor are these all. To deck the shapely knoll</L>
<L>That softly swell'd and gayly dress'd, appears</L>
<L>A flow'ry island from the dark green lawn</L>
<L>Emerging, must be deemed a labor due</L>
<L>To no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste.</L>
<L>Here also gratefull mixture of well match'd</L>
<L>And sorted hues, (each giving each relief,</L>

<L>Is needful. Strength may wield the pond'rous spade,</L>

<L><PB N="124" REF="126"/>
But elegance, chief grace the garden shows</L>
<L>And most attractive, is the fair result</L>
<L>Of thought, the creature of a polish'd mind.</L>
<L>Without it, all is Gothic as the scene</L>
<L>To which th' insipid citizen resorts</L>
<L>Near yonder heath; where industry mispent,</L>

<L>Has made a heav'n on earth. With suns and moons</L>
<L>Of close-ramm'd stones has charged th' incumber'd soil,</L>
<L>And fairly laid the Zodiac in the dust.</L>
<L>He therefore who would see his flow'rs disposed</L>
<L>Sightly and in just order, 'ere he gives</L>
<L>The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds</L>
<L>Forecasts the future whole. That when the scene</L>
<L>Shall break into its preconceived display,</L>
<L>Each for itself, and all as with one voice</L>
<L>Conspiring, may attest his bright design.</L>
<L>Nor even then, dismissing as perform'd</L>
<L>His pleasant work, may he suppose it done.</L>

Uninjured, but expect th' upholding aid</L>

<L>Transformed to a lean shank. The shapeless pair</L>
<L>As they designed to mock me, at my side</L>
<L>Take step for step, and as I near approach</L>
<L>The cottage, walk along the plaister'd wall</L>
<L>Prepost'rous sight! the legs without the man.</L>
<L>The verdure of the plain lies buried deep</L>

<L>And fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.</L>

<L>Their wonted fodder, not like hungr'ing man</L>
<L>Fretfull if unsupplied, but silent, meek,</L>

And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.</L>
<L>He from the stack carves out th' accustomed load,</L>
<L>Deep-plunging and again deep plunging oft</L>
<L>His broad keen knife into the solid mass.</L>
<L>Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,</L>
<L>With such undeviating and even force</L>
<L>He severs it away. No needless care,</L>
<L>Lest storms should overset the leaning pile</L>

<L>The cheerfull haunts of man, to wield the axe</L>
<L>And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,</L>
<L>From morn to eve his solitary task.</L>
<L>Shaggy and lean and shrew'd, with pointed ears</L>
<L>And tail cropp'd short, half lurcher and half cur</L>

<L>Like an unburied carcase trick'd with flow'rs</L>
<L>Is but a garnish'd nuisance, fitter far</L>
<L>For cleanly riddance than for fair attire.</L>
<L>So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,</L>
<L>More golden than that age of fabled gold</L>
<L>Renown'd in ancient song; not vex'd with care</L>
<L>Or stained with guilt, beneficent, approved</L>
<L>Of God and man, and peaceful in its end.</L>
<L>So glide my life away! and so at last</L>
<L>My share of duties decently fulfilled,</L>
<L>May some disease, not tardy to perform</L>
<L>Its destin'd office, yet with gentle stroke,</L>
<L>Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat</L>
<L>Beneath the turf that I have often trod.</L>
<L>It shall not grieve me, then, that once when called</L>
<L>To dress a Sofa with the flow'rs of verse,</L>
<L>I play'd awhile, obedient to the fair</L>
<L>With that light task, but soon to please her more</L>
<L><PB N="283" REF="281"/>
Whom flow'rs alone I knew would little please,</L>
<L>Let fall th' unfinish'd wreath, and roved for fruit.</L>
<L>Roved far and gather'd much. Some harsh, 'tis true,</L>
<L>Pick'd from the thorns and briars of reproof,</L>
<L>But wholesome, well-digested. Grateful some</L>
<L>To palates that can taste immortal truth,</L>
<L>Insipid else, and sure to be despised.</L>
<L>But all is in his hand whose praise I seek.</L>
<L>In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,</L>
<L>If he regard not, though divine the theme.</L>
<L>'Tis not in artful measures, in the chime</L>
<L>And idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyre</L>
<L>To charm his ear, whose eye is on the heart.</L>
<L>Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,</L>
<L>Whose approbation—prosper even mine.</L>

<HEAD>AN
EPISTLE
TO
JOSEPH HILL, ESQ.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEAR JOSEPH—five and twenty years ago—</L>
<L>Alas! how time escapes—'tis even so—</L>
<L>With frequent intercourse and always sweet</L>
<L>And always friendly, we were won't to cheat</L>
<L>A tedious hour—and now we never meet.</L>
<L>As some grave gentleman in Terence says,</L>
<L>('Twas therefore much the same in ancient days)</L>
<L>Good lack, we know not what to-morrow brings—</L>
<L>Strange fluctuation of all human things!</L>
<L>True. Changes will befall, and friends may part,</L>
<L>But distance only cannot change the heart:</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="283"/>
And were I call'd to prove th' assertion true,</L>
<L>One proof should serve, a reference to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence comes it then, that in the wane of life,</L>
<L>Though nothing have occurr'd to kindle strife,</L>
<L>We find the friends we fancied we had won,</L>
<L>Though num'rous once, reduced to few or none?</L>
<L>Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch?</L>
<L>No: Gold they seemed, but they were never such</L>
<L>Horatio's servant once, with bow and cringe</L>
<L>Swinging the parlour door upon its hinge,</L>
<L>Dreading a negative, and overawed</L>
<L>Lest he should trespass, begg'd to go abroad.</L>
<L>Go fellow!—whither?—turning short about—</L>
<L>Nay. Stay at home;—you're always going out.</L>
<L>'Tis but a step, sir, just at the street's end—</L>
<L>For what?—An please you sir, to see a friend.</L>
<L>A friend? Horatio cried, and seem'd to start—</L>
<L>Yea marry shalt thou, and with all my heart—</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="284"/>
And fetch my cloak, for though the night be raw</L>
<L>I'll see him too—the first I ever saw.</L>
<L>I knew the man, and knew his nature mild,</L>
<L>And was his play-thing often when a child,</L>
<L>But somewhat at that moment pinch'd him close,</L>
<L>Else he was seldom bitter or morose.</L>
<L>Perhaps his confidence just then betray'd,</L>
<L>His grief might prompt him with the speech he made,</L>
<L>Perhaps 'twas mere good-humour gave it birth,</L>
<L>The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth.</L>
<L>Howe'er it was, his language in my mind</L>
<L>Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind:</L>
<L>But not to moralize too much, and strain</L>
<L>To prove an evil of which all complain,</L>
<L>(I hate long arguments, verbosely spun)</L>
<L>One story more, dear Hill, and I have done:</L>
<L>Once on a time, an Emp'ror, a wise man,</L>
<L>No matter where, in China or Japan,</L>
<L>Decreed that whosoever should offend</L>
<L>Against the well known duties of a friend,</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="285"/>
Convicted once, should ever after wear</L>
<L>But half a coat, and show his bosom bare.</L>
<L>The punishment importing this, no doubt,</L>
<L>That all was naught within, and all found out.</L>
<L>Oh happy Britain! we have not to fear</L>
<L>Such hard and arbitrary measure here.</L>
<L>Else could a law like that which I relate,</L>
<L>Once have the sanction of our triple state,</L>
<L>Some few that I have known in days of old</L>
<L>Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold.</L>
<L>While you, my friend, whatever wind should blow,</L>
<L>Might traverse England safely to and fro,</L>
<L>An honest man, close-buttoned to the chin,</L>
<L>Broad-cloth without, and a warm heart within.</L>

<L>IT is not from his form in which we trace</L>
<L>Strength joined with beauty, dignity with grace,</L>
<L>That man, the master of this globe, derives</L>
<L>His right of empire over all that lives.</L>
<L>That form indeed, th' associate of a mind</L>
<L>Vast in its pow'rs, ethereal in its kind,</L>
<L>That form, the labour of almighty skill,</L>
<L>Framed for the service of a free-born will,</L>
<L>Asserts precedence, and bespeaks controul,</L>
<L>But borrows all its grandeur from the soul.</L>
<L>Hers is the state, the splendour and the throne,</L>
<L>An intellectual kingdom, all her own.</L>
<L><PB N="294" REF="289"/>
For her, the mem'ry fills her ample page</L>
<L>With truths pour'd down from ev'ry distant age,</L>
<L>For her amasses an unbounded store,</L>
<L>The wisdom of great nations, now no more,</L>
<L>Though laden, not incumber'd with her spoil,</L>
<L>Laborious, yet unconscious of her toil,</L>
<L>When copiously supplied, then most enlarged,</L>
<L>Still to be fed, and not to be surcharged.</L>
<L>For her, the fancy roving unconfined,</L>
<L>The present muse of ev'ry pensive mind,</L>
<L>Works magic wonders, adds a brighter hue</L>
<L>To nature's scenes, than nature ever knew,</L>
<L>At her command, winds rise and waters roar,</L>
<L>Again she lays them slumb'ring on the shore,</L>
<L>With flow'r and fruit the wilderness supplies,</L>
<L>Or bids the rocks in ruder pomp arise.</L>
<L>For her, the judgment, umpire in the strife,</L>
<L>That grace and nature have to wage through life,</L>
<L>Quick-sighted arbiter of good and ill,</L>
<L>Appointed sage preceptor to the will,</L>
<L><PB N="295" REF="290"/>
Condemns, approves, and with a faithful voice</L>
<L>Guides the decision of a doubtful choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why did the fiat of a God give birth</L>
<L>To yon fair sun and his attendant earth,</L>
<L>And when descending he resigns the skies,</L>
<L>Why takes the gent'ler moon her turn to rise,</L>
<L>Whom ocean feels through all his countless waves,</L>
<L>And owns her pow'r on ev'ry shore he laves?</L>
<L>Why do the seasons still enrich the year,</L>
<L>Fruitful and young as in their first career?</L>
<L>Spring hangs her infant blossoms on the trees,</L>
<L>Rock'd in the cradle of the western breeze,</L>
<L>Summer in haste the thriving charge receives</L>
<L>Beneath the shade of her expanded leaves,</L>
<L>'Till autumn's fiercer heats and plenteous dews</L>
<L>Dye them at last in all their glowing hues—</L>
<L>'Twere wild profusion all, and bootless waste,</L>
<L>Pow'r misemployed, munificence misplaced,</L>
<L><PB N="296" REF="291"/>
Had not its author dignified the plan,</L>
<L>And crowned it with the majesty of man.</L>
<L>Thus form'd, thus placed, intelligent, and taught</L>
<L>Look where he will, the wonders God has wrought</L>
<L>The wildest scorner of his Maker's laws</L>
<L>Finds in a sober moment time to pause,</L>
<L>To press th' important question on his heart,</L>
<L>"Why form'd at all, and wherefore as thou art?"</L>
<L>If man be what he seems, this hour a slave,</L>
<L>The next mere dust and ashes in the grave,</L>
<L>Endued with reason only to descry</L>
<L>His crimes and follies with an aching eye,</L>
<L>With passions, just that he may prove with pain</L>
<L>The force he spends against their fury, vain,</L>
<L>And if soon after having burnt by turns</L>
<L>With ev'ry lust with which frail nature burns,</L>
<L>His being end where death dissolves the bond,</L>
<L>The tomb take all, and all be blank beyond,</L>
<L>Then he, of all that nature has brought forth</L>
<L>Stands self-impeach'd the creature of least worth,</L>
<L><PB N="297" REF="292"/>
And useless while he lives, and when he dies,</L>
<L>Brlngs into doubt the wisdom of the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Truths that the learn'd pursue with eager thought,</L>
<L>Are not important always as dear-bought,</L>
<L>Proving at last, though told in pompous strains,</L>
<L>A childish waste of philosophic pains;</L>
<L>But truths on which depends our main concern,</L>
<L>That 'tis our shame and mis'ry not to learn,</L>
<L>Shine by the side of ev'ry path we tread</L>
<L>With such a lustre, he that runs may read.</L>
<L>'Tis true, that if to trifle life away</L>
<L>Down to the sun-set of their latest day,</L>
<L>Then perish on futurity's wide shore</L>
<L>Like fleeting exhalations, found no more,</L>
<L>Were all that heav'n required of human kind,</L>
<L>And all the plan their destiny designed,</L>
<L>What none could rev'rence all might justly blame,</L>
<L>And man would breathe but for his Maker's shame.</L>
<L><PB N="298" REF="293"/>
But reason heard, and nature well perused,</L>
<L>At once the dreaming mind is disabused.</L>
<L>If all we find possessing earth, sea, air,</L>
<L>Reflect his attributes who plac'd them there,</L>
<L>Fulfill the purpose, and appear design'd</L>
<L>Proofs of the wisdom of th' all-seeing mind,</L>
<L>'Tis plain, the creature whom he chose t' invest</L>
<L>With kingship and dominion o'er the rest,</L>
<L>Received his nobler nature, and was made</L>
<L>Fit for the power in which he stands array'd,</L>
<L>That first or last, hereafter if not here,</L>
<L>He too might make his author's wisdom clear,</L>
<L>Praise him on earth, or obstinately dumb</L>
<L>Suffer his justice in a world to come.</L>
<L>This once believed, 'twere logic misapplied</L>
<L>To prove a consequence by none denied,</L>
<L>That we are bound to cast the minds of youth</L>
<L>Betimes into the mould of heav'nly truth,</L>
<L>That taught of God they may indeed be wise,</L>
<L>Nor ignorantly wand'ring miss the skies.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="299" REF="294"/>
<L>In early days the conscience has in most</L>
<L>A quickness, which in later life is lost,</L>
<L>Preserved from guilt by salutary fears,</L>
<L>Or, guilty, soon relenting into tears.</L>
<L>Too careless often as our years proceed,</L>
<L>What friends we sort with, or what books we read,</L>
<L>Our parents yet exert a prudent care</L>
<L>To feed our infant minds with proper fare,</L>
<L>And wisely store the nurs'ry by degrees</L>
<L>With wholesome learning, yet acquired with ease.</L>
<L>Neatly secured from being soiled or torn</L>
<L>Beneath a pane of thin translucent horn,</L>
<L>A book (to please us at a tender age</L>
<L>'Tis call'd a book, though but a single page)</L>
<L>Presents the pray'r the Saviour deign'd to teach,</L>
<L>Which children use, and parsons—when they preach.</L>
<L>Lisping our syllables, we scramble next,</L>
<L>Through moral narrative, or sacred text,</L>
<L>And learn with wonder how this world began,</L>
<L>Who made, who marr'd, and who has ransom'd man.</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="295"/>
Points, which unless the Scripture made them plain,</L>
<L>The wisest heads might agitate in vain.</L>
<L>Oh thou, whom borne on fancy's eager wing</L>
<L>Back to the season of life's happy spring,</L>
<L>I pleased remember, and while mem'ry yet</L>
<L>Holds fast her office here, can ne'er forget,</L>
<L>Ingenious dreamer, in whose well told-tale</L>
<L>Sweet fiction and sweet truth alike prevail,</L>
<L>Whose hum'rous vein, strong sense, and simple stile,</L>
<L>May teach the gayest, make the gravest smile,</L>
<L>Witty, and well-employ'd, and like thy Lord,</L>
<L>Speaking in parables his slighted word,</L>
<L>I name thee not, lest so despised a name</L>
<L>Should move a sneer at thy deserved fame,</L>
<L>Yet ev'n in transitory life's late day</L>
<L>That mingles all my brown with sober gray,</L>
<L>Revere the man, whose <HI>Pilgrim</HI> marks the road</L>
<L>And guides the <HI>Progress</HI> of the soul to God.</L>
<L>'Twere well with most, if books that could engage</L>
<L>Their childhood, pleased them at a riper age;</L>
<L><PB N="301" REF="296"/>
The man approving what had charm'd the boy,</L>
<L>Would die at last in comfort, peace, and joy,</L>
<L>And not with curses on his art who stole</L>
<L>The gem of truth from his unguarded soul.</L>
<L>The stamp of artless piety impress'd</L>
<L>By kind tuition on his yielding breast,</L>
<L>The youth now bearded, and yet pert and raw,</L>
<L>Regards with scorn, though once received with awe,</L>
<L>And warp'd into the labyrinth of lies</L>
<L>That babblers, called philosophers, devise,</L>
<L>Blasphemes his creed as founded on a plan</L>
<L>Replete with dreams, unworthy of a man.</L>
<L>Touch but his nature in its ailing part,</L>

<L>His pride resents the charge, although the proof <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chron. Ch. 26. v. 19.</NOTE></L>

<L>Point to the cure, describe a Saviour's cross</L>
<L>As God's expedient to retrieve his loss,</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="297"/>
The young apostate sickens at the view,</L>
<L>And hates it with the malice of a Jew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How weak the barrier of mere nature proves</L>
<L>Oppos'd against the pleasures nature loves!</L>
<L>While self-betray'd, and wilfully undone,</L>
<L>She longs to yield, no sooner wooed than won.</L>
<L>Try now the merits of this blest exchange</L>
<L>Of modest truth for wits eccentric range.</L>
<L>'Time was, he closed as he began the day</L>
<L>With decent duty, not ashamed to pray.</L>
<L>The practice was a bond upon his heart,</L>
<L>A pledge he gave for a consistent part,</L>
<L>Nor could he dare prefumptuously displease</L>
<L>A pow'r confess'd so lately on his knees.</L>
<L>But now, farewell all legendary tales,</L>
<L>The shadows fly, philosophy prevails,</L>
<L>Pray'r to the winds and caution to the waves,</L>
<L>Religion makes the free by nature slaves,</L>
<L><PB N="303" REF="298"/>
Priests have invented, and the world admired</L>
<L>What knavish priests promulgate as inspired,</L>
<L>'Till reason, now no longer overawed,</L>
<L>Resumes her pow'rs, and spurns the clumsy fraud,</L>
<L>And common-sense diffusing real day,</L>
<L>The meteor of the gospel dies away.</L>
<L>Such rhapsodies our shrew'd discerning youth</L>
<L>Learn from expert enquirers after truth,</L>
<L>Whose only care, might truth presume to speak,</L>
<L>Is not to find what they prosess to seek.</L>

<L>His pride that scorns t' obey or to submit,</L>

<L>Robb'ry of gardens, quarrels in the streets,</L>

<L>Some sneaking virtue lurks in him no doubt,</L>

<L>Such youths of spirit, and that spirit too</L>

And such an age as ours baulks no expence</L>
<L>Except of caution and of common-sense,</L>

<L>No few, that would seem wise, resemble her.</L>
<L><PB N="335" REF="330"/>
But all are not alike. Thy warning voice</L>

<HEAD>THE DIVERTING
HISTORY
OF
JOHN GILPIN,
SHEWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE
INTENDED AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>JOHN Gilpin was a citizen</L>
<L>Of credit and renown,</L>
<L>A train-band Captain eke was he</L>
<L>Of famous London town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,</L>
<L>Though wedded we have been</L>
<L>These twice ten tedious years, yet we</L>
<L>No holiday have seen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="344" REF="338"/>
<L>To-morrow is our wedding-day,</L>
<L>And we will then repair</L>
<L>Unto the Bell at Edmonton</L>
<L>All in a chaise and pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My sister and my sister's child,</L>
<L>My self and children three</L>
<L>Will fill the chaise, so you must ride</L>
<L>On horse-back after we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He soon replied, I do admire</L>
<L>Of womankind but one,</L>
<L>And you are she, my dearest dear,</L>
<L>Therefore it shall be done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I am a linnen-draper bold,</L>
<L>As all the world doth know,</L>
<L>And my good friend the Callender</L>
<L>Will lend his horse to go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="345" REF="339"/>
<L>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, that's well said;</L>
<L>And for that wine is dear,</L>
<L>We will be furnish'd with our own,</L>
<L>Which is both bright and clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife,</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd was he to find</L>
<L>That though on pleasure she was bent,</L>
<L>She had a frugal mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning came, the chaise was brought,</L>
<L>But yet was not allow'd</L>
<L>To drive up to the door, lest all</L>
<L>Should say that she was proud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,</L>
<L>Where they did all get in,</L>
<L>Six precious souls, and all agog</L>
<L>To dash through thick and thin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="346" REF="340"/>
<L>Smack went the whip, round went the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>Were never folk so glad,</L>
<L>The stones did rattle underneath</L>
<L>As if Cheapside were mad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin at his horse's side</L>
<L>Seized fast the flowing main,</L>
<L>And up he got in haste to ride,</L>
<L>But soon came down again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,</L>
<L>His journey to begin,</L>
<L>When turning round his head he saw</L>
<L>Three customers come in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So down he came, for loss of time</L>
<L>Although it grieved him sore,</L>
<L>Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,</L>
<L>Would trouble him much more:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="347" REF="341"/>
<L>'Twas long before the customers</L>
<L>Were suited to their mind,</L>
<L>When Betty screaming came down stairs,</L>
<L>"The wine is left behind."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,</L>
<L>My leathern belt likewise</L>
<L>In which I bear my trusty sword</L>
<L>When I do exercise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,</L>
<L>Had two stone bottles found,</L>
<L>To hold the liquor that she loved,</L>
<L>And keep it safe and sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each bottle had a curling ear</L>
<L>Through which the belt he drew,</L>
<L>And hung a bottle on each side</L>
<L>To make his balance true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="348" REF="342"/>
<L>Then over all, that he might be</L>
<L>Equipp'd from top to toe,</L>
<L>His long red cloak well brush'd and neat</L>
<L>He manfully did throw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now see him mounted once again</L>
<L>Upon his nimble steed,</L>
<L>Full slowly pacing o'er the stones</L>
<L>With caution and good heed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But finding soon a smoother road</L>
<L>Beneath his well-shod feet,</L>
<L>The snorting beast began to trot,</L>
<L>Which gall'd him in his seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So fair and softly, John he cried,</L>
<L>But John he cried in vain,</L>
<L>That trot became a gallop soon</L>
<L>In spite of curb and rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="349" REF="343"/>
<L>So stooping down, as needs he must</L>
<L>Who cannot sit upright,</L>
<L>He grasp'd the mane with both his hands</L>
<L>And eke with all his might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His horse who never in that sort</L>
<L>Had handled been before,</L>
<L>What thing upon his back had got</L>
<L>Did wonder more and more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin neck or nought,</L>
<L>Away went hat and wig,</L>
<L>He little dreamt when he set out</L>
<L>Of running such a rig.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</L>
<L>Like streamer long and gay,</L>
<L>'Till loop and button failing both</L>
<L>At last it flew away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="350" REF="344"/>
<L>Then might all people well discern</L>
<L>The bottles he had slung,</L>
<L>A bottle swinging at each side</L>
<L>As hath been said or sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dogs did bark, the children scream'd;</L>
<L>Up flew the windows all,</L>
<L>And ev'ry soul cried out, well done,</L>
<L>As loud as he could bawl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin—who but he;</L>
<L>His fame soon spread around—</L>
<L>He carries weight, he rides a race,</L>
<L>'Tis for a thousand pound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And still as fast as he drew near,</L>
<L>'Twas wonderful to view</L>
<L>How in a trice the turnpike-men</L>
<L>Their gates wide open threw:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="351" REF="345"/>
<L>And now as he went bowing down</L>
<L>His reeking head full low,</L>
<L>The bottles twain behind his back</L>
<L>Were shatter'd at a blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Down ran the wine into the road</L>
<L>Most piteous to be seen,</L>
<L>Which made his horse's flanks to smoke</L>
<L>As they had basted been.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But still he seem'd to carry weight,</L>
<L>With leathern girdle braced,</L>
<L>For all might see the bottle necks</L>
<L>Still dangling at his waist.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all through merry Islington</L>
<L>These gambols he did play,</L>
<L>And till he came unto the wash</L>
<L>Of Edmonton so gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="352" REF="346"/>
<L>And there he threw the wash about</L>
<L>On both sides of the way,</L>
<L>Just like unto a trundling mop,</L>
<L>Or a wild-goose at play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At Edmonton his loving wife</L>
<L>From the balcony spied</L>
<L>Her tender husband, wond'ring much</L>
<L>To see how he did ride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stop, stop John Gilpin!—Here's the house—</L>
<L>They all at once did cry,</L>
<L>The dinner waits and we are tir'd,</L>
<L>Said Gilpin—so am I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But yet his horse was not a whit</L>
<L>Inclined to tarry there,</L>
<L>For why? his owner had a house</L>
<L>Full ten miles off at Ware.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="353" REF="347"/>
<L>So like an arrow swift he flew</L>
<L>Shot by an archer strong,</L>
<L>So did he fly—which brings me to</L>
<L>The middle of my song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin, out of breath,</L>
<L>And sore against his will,</L>
<L>Till at his friend's the Callender's</L>
<L>His horse at last stood still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Callender amazed to see</L>
<L>His neighbour in such trim,</L>
<L>Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,</L>
<L>And thus accosted him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What news, what news, your tidings tell,</L>
<L>Tell me you must and shall—</L>
<L>Say why bare headed you are come,</L>
<L>Or why you come at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="354" REF="348"/>
<L>Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit</L>
<L>And loved a timely joke,</L>
<L>And thus unto the Callender</L>
<L>In merry guise he spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I came because your horse would come,</L>
<L>And if I well forebode,</L>
<L>My hat and wig will soon be here,</L>
<L>They are upon the road.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Callender right glad to find</L>
<L>His friend in merry pin,</L>
<L>Return'd him not a single word,</L>
<L>But to the house went in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence strait he came with hat and wig,</L>
<L>A wig that flow'd behind,</L>
<L>A hat not much the worse for wear,</L>
<L>Each comely in its kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="355" REF="349"/>
<L>He held them up, and in his turn</L>
<L>Thus show'd his ready wit,</L>
<L>My head is twice as big as yours,</L>
<L>They therefore needs must fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let me scrape the dirt away</L>
<L>That hangs upon your face,</L>
<L>And stop and eat, for well you may</L>
<L>Be in a hungry case.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Said John, it is my wedding-day,</L>
<L>And all the world would stare,</L>
<L>If wife should dine at Edmonton</L>
<L>And I should dine at Ware.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So turning to his horse, he said,</L>
<L>I am in haste to dine,</L>
<L>'Twas for your pleasure you came here▪</L>
<L>You shall go back for mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="356" REF="350"/>
<L>Ah luckless speech, and bootless boast!</L>
<L>For which he paid full dear,</L>
<L>For while he spake a braying ass</L>
<L>Did sing most loud and clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whereat his horse did snort as he</L>
<L>Had heard a lion roar,</L>
<L>And gallop'd off with all his might</L>
<L>As he had done before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin and away</L>
<L>Went Gilpin's hat and wig;</L>
<L>He lost them sooner than at first,</L>
<L>For why? they were too big.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, Mistress Gilpin when she saw,</L>
<L>Her husband posting down</L>
<L>Into the country far away,</L>
<L>She pull'd out half a crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="357" REF="351"/>
<L>And thus unto the youth she said</L>
<L>That drove them to the Bell,</L>
<L>This shall be yours when you bring back</L>
<L>My husband safe and well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth did ride, and soon did meet</L>
<L>John coming back amain,</L>
<L>Whom in a trice he tried to stop</L>
<L>By catching at his rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not performing what he meant</L>
<L>And gladly would have done,</L>
<L>The frighted steed he frighted more,</L>
<L>And made him faster run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin, and away</L>
<L>Went post-boy at his heels,</L>
<L>The post-boy's horse right glad to miss</L>
<L>The lumb'ring of the wheels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="358" REF="352"/>
<L>Six gentlemen upon the road</L>
<L>Thus seeing Gilpin fly,</L>
<L>With post-boy scamp'ring in the rear,</L>
<L>They rais'd the hue and cry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stop thief, stop thief—a highwayman!</L>
<L>Not one of them was mute,</L>
<L>And all and each that pass'd that way</L>
<L>Did join in the pursuit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the turnpike gates again</L>
<L>Flew open in short space,</L>
<L>The toll-men thinking as before</L>
<L>That Gilpin rode a race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And so he did and won it too,</L>
<L>For he got first to town,</L>
<L>Nor stopp'd 'till where he had got up</L>
<L>He did again get down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="359" REF="353"/>
<L>Now let us sing, long live the king,</L>
<L>And Gilpin long live he,</L>
<L>And when he next doth ride abroad,</L>
<L>May I be there to see!</L>
