<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ADDITIONS to the Article concerning the
Formation of the Planets, Vol. I. p. 59.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On the distance of the Earth from the Sun.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 59. I said, <HI>That the earth is situated
thirty millions of leagues from the sun.</HI> This
was the general opinion of astronomers in the
year 1745, when I composed the treatise on the
formation of the planets. But later observa∣tions,
and particularly those derived from the
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
transit of Venus over the sun's disc in 1769,
show that this distance of thirty millions should
be augmented three or four millions of leagues.
It is for this reason that, in the <HI>Epoques de la
Nature,</HI> I have always reckoned the mean di∣stance
of the sun from the earth to be thirty-three
millions of leagues, instead of thirty. This
remark was necessary to prevent the suspicion
of my having contradicted myself.</P>
<P>I must farther remark, that the sun is not on∣ly
thirty-three or thirty-four millions of leagues
distant from the earth, but, from the same ob∣servations,
it has likewise been discovered that
the volume of the sun is a tenth part larger
than was formerly supposed; and, consequently,
that the whole mass of the planets is only an
eight hundredth part of that of the sun, and not
a six hundredth and fiftieth part, as I had ad∣vanced
from the information we possessed in the
year 1745. This difference strengthens the pro∣bability
that the matter of the planets was pro∣jected
from the body of the sun.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Matter of the Sun and Planets.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD remarked, in p. 65. That <HI>the opaque
bodies of the planets were detached from the lu∣minous
matter of which the sun is composed.</HI>
These expressions are not correct; for the mat∣ter
of the planets, when projected from the sun,
was equally luminous as that of the sun itself,
and the planets became not opaque till their
state of fluid brightness had ceased: The dura∣tion
of this state in several kinds of matter I de∣termined
by experiment; and, from analogy, I
calculated the continuation of this bright state
in each of the planets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See epoques de la nature.</NOTE>. Besides, as the tor∣rent
of matter, projected from the body of the
sun by the comet, traversed the immense atmos∣phere
of that luminary, it carried off the vola∣tile,
aqueous, and aerial parts of which the seas
and atmospheres of the different planets are now
composed. Hence we may conclude, that the
matter of the planets is the same, in every re∣spect,
with that of the sun, and that there is
no other difference but in the degree of heat,
which is extreme in the sun, and greater or
smaller in the planets, according to the compound
ratio of their thickness and density.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the relation between the Density of the Pla∣nets
and their Celerity.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 75. I said, that, <HI>according to this relation
between the celerity and density of the planets,
the density of the earth ought not to exceed</HI> 206 7/18,
<HI>instead of</HI> 400, <HI>which is its real density.</HI> The
density here ascribed to the earth is too great with
relation to the quickness of its motion round the
sun, and ought to be a little diminished for a rea∣son
which had formerly escaped me. The
moon, which, in this computation, should be re¦garded
as forming a part of the earth, is less dense
in the ratio of 702 to 1000, and the lunar globe
is 1/49th of the bulk of the terrestrial. Hence, if
the moon were as large as the earth, we should di∣minish
the density of the latter 400 in the ratio
of 1000 to 702, which produces 281, <HI>i. e.</HI> 119 of
diminution in the density 400. But, as the moon
is only 1/49th part of the bulk of the earth, it
will produce only 119/49, or 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/7ths of diminution.
Consequently, the density of our globe, with
relation to its celerity, instead of 206 7/18, ought
to be estimated at 206 7/18 + 2 7/3 <HI>i. e.</HI> nearly 209.
Besides, we may suppose that our globe, at the
beginning, was less dense than it is at present,
and that it is become much more compact both
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
by cooling, and by the sinking of vast caverns with
which its interior parts abounded. This opi∣nion
accords with those revolutions which hap∣pened,
and still continue to happen, both on the
surface of the earth, and even at considerable
depths. By the aid of this fact, we are enabled
to explain the possibility that the waters of the
sea were formerly 2000 fathoms above those
parts of the globe which are now inhabited;
for these waters would still cover the whole sur∣face
of the earth, if, by immense depressions, dif∣ferent
parts had not sunk, and formed those re∣ceptacles
for the waters which at present exist.</P>
<P>If we suppose the diameter of the globe to be
2863 leagues, it would be two leagues more
when covered with 2000 fathoms of water.
This difference in the bulk of the earth, produced
by the sinking of the waters, gives an augmen∣tation
of a 1/477th part of its density. This aug∣mentation
of the density, or diminution of the
bulk of the globe, may be doubled, and perhaps
tripled, by the sinking and overturning of moun∣tains,
and the consequent filling up of valleys;
so that, since the waters fell upon the earth, its
density may be supposed to have increased one
hundredth part.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On the relation assigned by Newton between the
density of the Planets and the degrees of Heat
to which they are exposed.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 145. I remarked, that, <HI>notwithstanding
the regard due to the conjectures of Newton, I
cannot help thinking that the densities of the pla∣nets
have a nearer relation to their celerities
than to the degrees of heat to which they are ex∣posed.</HI>
From calculating the action of the solar
heat upon the planets, it appears that this heat, in
general, is inconsiderable, and that it has never
produced any great change in the density of each
planet; for the action of the solar heat, which is
weak in itself, has no influence on the density of
the matter of which the planets are composed,
except at their surfaces. It cannot act on the in∣ternal
parts, because it penetrates to a very small
depth only. Hence the total density of a pla∣net
has no relation to the heat transmitted to it
by the sun.</P>
<P>It appears to be certain, therefore, that the
density of the planets has no dependence on the
solar heat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the contrary, that their densi∣ties
have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> relation with their celerities,
which last increase or diminish in proportion to
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
their distances from the sun. We have seen,
that, at the general projection, the more dense
parts were not removed so far from the sun as
the less dense. Mercury, which is composed of
the most dense matter projected from the sun,
remained in the neighbourhood of that luminary;
while Saturn, which consists of the lightest mat∣ter,
is removed to a great distance from the sun:
And, as the most distant planets revolve round
the sun with greater celerity than those that are
nearer, it follows, that their density has a direct
relation with their celerity, and still more with
their distance from the sun. The distances of
the six planets from the sun are as 4, 7, 10, 15,
52, 95; and their densities as 2040, 1270, 1000,
730, 292, 184. And, if we suppose the densi∣ties
to be in the inverse ratio of the distances,
they will be as 2040, 1160, 889½, 660, 210,
159. This last relation between their respective
densities is perhaps more just than the former;
because it seems to be founded on the physical
cause which must have produced the difference
of density in each planet.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On the extent of Terrestrial Continents.</HEAD>
<P>PAGE 134. I said, that <HI>the longest line which
can be drawn in the ancient Continent is a∣bout</HI>
3600 <HI>leagues.</HI> By leagues I mean those
used in the environs of Paris, which are 2000 or
2100 fathoms long, and about 27 of them make
a degree.</P>
<P>Besides, though in this article of general geo∣graphy,
I endeavoured to reach that degree of
exactness which subjects of that nature require;
yet a few slight errors have escaped me. For
example, 1. I have not used the names adopted
or given by the French to several parts of Ame∣rica.
I uniformly followed the British globes
made by Senex, of two feet diameter, from
which my charts were exactly copied. The
British are more just than the French, with re∣gard
to countries they discover, or through which
they travel. They preserve the original name
of each country, or that which was bestowed on
it by the first discoverers. We, on the contrary,
often give French names to the countries we vi∣sit,
which is the cause of that obscurity in
the geographical nomenclature of our language.
But, as the lines which traverse the two Conti∣nents
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
in their greatest length are well marked,
in my charts, by the two extreme points, and
several other intermediate ones, whose names are
generally adopted, no essential ambiguity can a∣rise
from this circumstance.</P>
<P>2. I likewise neglected to give the calculation
of the surface of the two continents, because it
is easily made on a large globe. But, as many
persons have expressed a desire to see this cal∣culation,
I here subjoin that which M. Robert
de Vaugondi transmitted to me at the time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Calculation of our Continent by geometrical leagues

From this calculation it appears, that, on the left
of the line of partitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, there are 2471092¾ of
square leagues, and 2469687 square leagues on
the right of the same line; and consequently that
the Old Continent consists of about 4940780
square leagues, which is not one fifth part of the
earth's surface.</P>
<P>In the same manner, the part on the left of
the line of partition in the New Continent▪ con∣tains
1069286 5/6 square leagues, and that on the
right of the same line consists of 1370926 1/12;
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
in all, about 2140213 square leagues; which
makes not one half of the surface of the Old
Continent. As both Continents contain but
7080993 square leagues, their superficies is not
near one third of the total surface of the globe,
which is about 26 millions of square leagues.</P>
<P>3. I ought to have mentioned the small diffe∣rence
of inclination that subsists between the two
lines by which I divided the two Continents. I
contented myself with saying, that they were both
inclined to the Equator, in opposite sides, about
30 degrees, which is not the precise fact; for
that of the Old Continent is a little more than
30 degrees, and that of the New a little less.
If I had given this explanation, I should have a∣voided
the imputation of having drawn two lines
of unequal lengths, under the same angle be∣tween
two parallels; which would have proved,
as an anonymous critic remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres à un Americain.</NOTE>, that I am un∣acquainted
with the elements of geometry.</P>
<P>4. I neglected to distinguish Upper from Low∣er
Egypt; so that, in p. 137. and 138. there is the
appearance of a contradiction. In the first of
these passages. Egypt seems to be ranked among
the most ancient lands, while, in the second, it is
reckoned among the most recent. I was wrong
in not distinguishing, as I had elsewhere done,
Upper Egypt, which is a very ancient land, from
Lower Egypt, which is a very new territory.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Form of Continents.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the figure of Continents, I
shall transcribe a passage from the ingenious au∣thor
of the Philosophical and Political History
of the two Indies.</P>
<P>'It is now thought to be certain,' he remarks,
'that the surface of the New Continent is not
one half of that of the Old. Besides, in their
figure there are some striking analogies.—They
seem to form two immense bands of earth,
which arise from the Arctic pole, terminate in
the South, and separated on the East and West
by the ocean that invests them. Independent
of the structure of these two bands, and of the
counterpoise or symmetry which takes place in
their figure; it is apparent, that their equili∣brium
depends not on their position; it is the
fluctuation of the sea which produces the stabi∣lity
of the earth. To fix the globe on its base, it
was necessary to have an element which, by
floating continually around this planet, should
counterbalance, by its weight, the other sub∣stances,
and restore that equilibrium which the
collision of the other elements might have distur∣bed.
Water, by its fluidity and gravity, is well
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
fitted to support that harmony and that balance
of the different parts of the globe around its
centre.'</P>
<P>'If the waters which still moisten the bowels
of the New Hemisphere had not deluged its
surface, man would soon have cut down the
woods, drained the marshes, and given consist∣ence
to a watery soil.—He would have opened
vents to the winds, and confined the rivers
within their banks; the climate, of course,
would have already been changed. But an
uncultivated and thinly inhabited hemisphere
announces a recent land, while the waters
which environ its coasts still creep silently
through its veins.'</P>
<P>On this subject I shall remark, that, although
there is more water on the surface of America
than on that of other countries, we ought not to
conclude from this circumstance, that an internal
sea is contained in the bowels of this new land.
We should only infer from this number of lakes,
marshes, and large rivers, that America has been
peopled long after Asia, Africa, and Europe,
where the quantity of stagnant waters is much
less. Besides, a thousand other circumstances
concur in showing, that the Continent of Ameri∣ca
in general ought to be regarded as new land,
in which Nature has not had time to acquire all
her powers, nor to exhibit them by a numerous
population.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Terra Australis, p. 140.</HEAD>
<P>To what I have said concerning the Terra
Australis, I shall add, that, within these few years,
new attempts have been made to discover it, and
that some points of it have been found after de∣parting
either from the Cape of Good Hope, or
from the Isle of France; but that these new
voyagers have uniformly met with thick fogs,
snow, and ice, in the 46th or 47th degree of
South latitude. After conversing with some of
these voyagers, and collecting all the informa∣tion
I could derive from other sources, I percei∣ved
that they all agreed with regard to this fact,
and that they found ice in much lower latitudes
than is to be met with in the northern hemi∣sphere.
They likewise uniformly met with fogs
in the same latitudes where they found ice,
though it was summer in these climates at the
time the experiments were made. It is, there∣fore,
extremely probable, that, below the 50th
degree, it will be in vain to search for temperate
countries in the southern hemisphere, where the
freezing cold is much farther extended than in
the northern. The thick fog is produced by
the presence or neighbourhood of the ice. This
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
fog consists of minute particles of snow, which
are suspended in the air, and render it obscure:
It often accompanies the great floating masses of
ice, and reigns perpetually in frozen regions.</P>
<P>Besides, the British have lately sailed round
New Holland as well as New Zealand. These
southern countries are more extensive than the
whole of Europe. New Zealand is divided into
several islands; but New Holland ought rather
to be regarded as a part of Asia, than as an island
belonging to the Southern Continent; for New
Holland is only separated from the land of the
Papous, or New Guiney, by a narrow strait, and
the whole Archipelago, which extend southward
from the Philippine isles, as far as the country of
Arnhem in New Holland, and toward the west
and south, as far as Sumatra and Java, appears
to belong as much to the Continent of New Hol∣land,
as to the southern parts of Asia.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, who ought to be regarded as
the greatest navigator of this age, and to whom
we are indebted for an infinite number of new dis∣coveries,
has not only given a chart of the coasts
of Zealand and New Holland, but has likewise
explored an immense tract of the south sea in
the neighbourhood of America. He departed
from the south point of America on the 30th of
January 1769, and he traversed a great part of
the ocean under the 60th degree, without disco∣vering
any land. From Captain Cook's chart
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
we may perceive the great extent of sea which
he explored; and his tract demonstrates, that, if
any lands exist in this part of the globe, they must
be far removed from the Continent of A∣merica;
for New Zealand, which is situated be∣tween
the 35th and 45th degrees, is very distant
from America. But it is still to be hoped, that
other navigators, following the tract of Captain
Cook, will traverse the southern ocean under the
50th degree, and that they will discover whether
these immense regions, which extend more than
two thousand leagues, consist of land or of sea.
However, I do not imagine that the southern
regions, beyond the 50th degree, are so tempe∣rate
that any advantage could be derived to us
from the discovery of them.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the invention of the Mariner's Com∣pass,
p. 153.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the invention of the Mariner's
Compass, I have to add, that, from the testi∣mony
of Chinese authors, of which M. le Rouse
and M. de Guignes have made an abridgement,
it appears to be certain, that the polarity of the
magnetic needle has been very anciently known
to the inhabitants of China. The figure of these
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
first compasses was those of a man, who turned
upon a pivot, and whose right arm pointed to
the south. The time of this invention, accor∣ding
to certain Chinese chronicles, was 11 15 years
before the Christian aera, and, according to o∣thers,
2700<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'Extrait des Annales de la China, par Mrs Rouse and de Guignes.</NOTE>. But, notwithstanding the anti∣quity
of this discovery, it does not appear that
the Chinese had ever derived from it the advan∣tage
of making long voyages.</P>
<P>Homer, in the Odyssey, tells us, that the
Greeks employed the loadstone to direct their
navigation when they went to besiege Troy;
and this aera is nearly the same with that re∣corded
in the Chinese Chronicle. Hence we
can no longer doubt, that the direction of the
loadstone toward the pole, and even the use of
the mariner's compass in navigation, were known
to the ancients at least three thousand years ago.</P>

<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the discovery of America, p. 155.</HEAD>
<P>To what I said, p. 155. concerning the disco∣very
of America, a critic of more judgment than
the author of <HI>Lettres à un Américain,</HI> has ac∣cused
me of doing a kind of injury to the me∣mory
of so great a man as Christopher Colum∣bus.
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
'It is confounding,' he remarks, 'Co∣lumbus
with his sailors, to think that he could
believe the sea rose toward the sky, and that
they perhaps touched each other on the south∣ern
part of the globe.' This criticism is ex∣tremely
just. I ought to have softened this fact,
which I had extracted from some historical re∣lation;
for this great navigator, it is to be pre∣sumed,
must have had very distinct notions con∣cerning
the figure of the earth, which he deri∣ved
both from his own voyages, and from those
of the Portuguese to the Cape of Good Hope
and the East Indies. It is well known, howe∣ver,
that Columbus, when he arrived at the
New Continent, thought himself at no great di∣stance
from the east coasts of Asia. As no man,
at that period, had circumnavigated the world,
he could not know its circumference, and did not
imagine that the earth was so extensive as it has
been demonstrated by later discoveries. Be∣sides,
it must be acknowledged, that this first
navigator toward the west, could not fail to be
astonished to find, that, when below the Antil∣les,
it was impossible for him to gain the south∣ern
regions, and that he was continually forced
back. This obstacle still subsists. We cannot,
in any season, sail directly from the Antilles to
Guiana; because the currents are extremely ra∣pid,
and constantly run from Guiana to those
islands. Ships sail from Guiana to the Antilles
in five or six days; but they require two months
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
to return. In order to return, they are obliged
to make a large circuit toward the Old Conti∣nent,
from whence they direct their course to∣ward
the Terra Firma of South America. These
rapid and perpetual currents from Guiana to the
Antilles are so violent that they cannot be sur∣mounted
by the aid of the wind; and, as this
circumstance is unexampled in the Atlantic o∣cean,
it is not sursprising that Columbus, who,
notwithstanding all the resources of his genius
and knowledge in the art of navigation, could
not advance toward the southern regions, should
think that something of a very extraordinary
nature existed in this place, and perhaps that
there was a greater elevation in this part of the
sea than in any other; for the currents from
Guiana to the Antilles actually run with as
much rapidity as if they descended from a height.</P>
<P>The motion of the following rivers, may give
rise to the currents from Cayenne to the An∣tilles.</P>
<P>1. The impetuous river of the Amazons,
whose mouth is seventy leagues broad, and its
direction more to the North than the South.</P>
<P>2. The river Ouassa is likewise rapid, has the
same direction, and its mouth is nearly a league
wide.</P>
<P>3. The Oyapok is still more rapid than the
Ouassa, passes through a greater tract of land,
and its mouth is nearly of the same dimension.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27"/>
4. The Aprouak has nearly the same extent
of course and of mouth as the Ouassa.</P>
<P>5. The river Kaw is less extensive both in
its course and mouth; but, though it issues from
a Savannah about twenty-five or thirty leagues
from the sea, it is extremely rapid.</P>
<P>6. The Oyak, which is a considerable river,
divides into two branches at its mouth, and
forms the island of Cayenne. This river, at the
distance of twenty or twenty-five leagues, re∣ceives
another called Oraput; it is very impe∣tuous,
and derives its source from a mountain of
rocks, from whence it descends in rapid torrents.</P>
<P>7. One branch of the Oyak runs, near its
mouth, into the river of Cayenne; and these
two rivers, when united, are more than a
league broad; the other branch exceeds not half
a league.</P>
<P>8. The river of Kourou, which is very rapid,
and not above half a league wide at the mouth,
without reckoning the Macousia, which, though
it furnishes much water, comes from no great
distance.</P>
<P>9. The Sinamari is an impetuous river; it
comes from a great distance, and its bed is pret∣ty
narrow.</P>
<P>10. The river Maroni, though it be very ra∣pid,
comes from a great distance. Its mouth is
more than a league broad, and, next to the A∣mazon,
it discharges the greatest quantity of
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
water. It gives rise to no islands; while the
mouths of the Amazon and Oronoko are inter∣spersed
with a great number.</P>
<P>11. The rivers of Surinam, of Barbiché, of
Essequebé, and some others, till we reach the
Oronoko, which is a very large river.</P>
<P>By the accumulations of mud and of earth
brought down from the mountains by these ri∣vers,
it should appear, all the valleys of this
vast continent have been formed; in the middle
of the continent there are some mountains, most
of which have formerly been volcanoes, and
are not sufficiently elevated to allow their sum∣mits
to be covered with snow or ice.</P>
<P>Hence it is apparent, that the united force of
all these rivers gives rise to that general current
of the sea from Cayenne, or rather from the
Amazon, to the Antilles; and that this general
current extends, perhaps, above sixty leagues
from the eastern coast of Guiana.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Concerning the Strata in different parts of the
Earth.</HEAD>
<P>WE have some examples of quarries and
pits of considerable depths, of which
the different strata have been examined and de∣scribed;
such as the pit of Amsterdam, which
descends 232 feet, and that of Marly-la-ville,
which is 100 feet deep. Many other examples
might be given, if observers had agreed in their
denominations. But some give the name of <HI>marl</HI>
to white clay; others apply the term <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int</HI> to
round calcareous stones; and others give the de∣nomination
of <HI>sand</HI> to calcareous gravel. Hence
little advantage can be derived either from their
researches or their long dissertations on these
subjects; because we are under a perpetual un∣certainty
with regard to the nature of the sub∣stanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
they describe. We shall, therefore, con∣fine
ourselves to the following examples.</P>
<P>An excellent observer has written to one of
my friends, in the following terms, concerning
the strata in the neighbourhood of Toulon:
'To the north of the city of Toulon,' he re∣marks,
'there is an immense quantity of stony
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
matter, which occupies the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>livity of the
chain of mountains, and stretches through the
valley from east to west; and one part of it
forms the soil of the valley, and loses itself in
the sea. This stony matter is commonly called
<HI>saffre</HI>; but it is that species of tufa which is
denominated <HI>marga toffacea fisiulosa</HI> by natu∣ralists.
M. Guettard desired me to furnish
him with all the information I could obtain
concerning this saffre, as well as specimens of
the matter itself, that he might examine it,
and give a detail of its qualities in his me∣moirs.
I sent them both; and I believe I have
satisfied him; for he has thanked me for the
information I communicated. He tells me,
that he is to return to Provence and Toulon
in the beginning of May. . . . . . . M. Guet∣tard,
however, will probably give us nothing
new upon this subject; for M. de Buffon has
exhausted it in the first volume of his Natural
History, under the article, <HI>Proofs of the theory
of the earth</HI>; and it appears, that, in compo∣sing
this article, he had in his eye the moun∣tains
of Toulon and their ridge.'</P>
<P>'At the commencement of this ridge, which
consists of a more or less hard tufa, we
find, in small cavities of the nucleus of the
mountain, quantities of very fine sand, which
are probably the balls mentioned by M.
de Buffon. After breaking other superficial
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
parts of the nucleus, we find numbers of sea∣shells
incorporated with the stone. . . . . . I
have several of these shells, the enamel of which
is well preserved. I will send them soon to
M. de Buffon.'</P>
<P>M. Guettard, who has made more observa∣tions
of this kind than any other naturalist,
expresses himself in the following terms, when
he treats of the mountains in the neighbourhood
of Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Buffy á M. Gue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> de Montbeill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Avril</HI> 16. 1775.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Below the vegetable soil, which exceeds
not two or three feet, is placed a bed of sand
from four or six to twenty, and often thirty
feet thick. This bed is commonly replete
with stones of the nature of grind-stone. . . . .
In some districts, we meet with detached mas∣ses
of free-stone in this sand bed.'</P>
<P>'Below this sand, we find a tufa, from ten
or twelve, to thirty, forty, and even fifty feet
thick. This tufa is not commonly of one e∣qual
thickness. It is frequently cut by diffe∣rent
strata of spurious or clayey marl, of the
<HI>cos</HI> which the workmen call <HI>tripoli,</HI> or of good
marl, and even by small beds of pretty hard
stones. . . . . Under this bed of tufa are
found those which furnish stones for building.
These beds vary in thickness: At first they
exceed not one foot. In some districts, three
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
or four of them lie above each other. They
are succeded by one of about ten feet, both the
surface and interior parts of which are inter∣spersed
with moulds or impressions of shells.
It is followed by another about four feet,
which rests upon one from seven to eight, or
rather upon two of three or four feet. After
these beds, there are several others, which
together form a mass of at least three fathoms.
This mass, after piercing a bed of sand, is suc∣ceeded
by clays.'</P>
<P>'This bed of sand is earthy and reddish, and
is from two and a half to three feet thick.
After this comes a bed of spurious clay of a
blueish colour; it is a clayey earth mixed with
sand; the thickness of this bed is about two
feet, and is followed by another of five, which
consists of a smooth black clay, the broken
portions of which are nearly as brilliant as jet.
Lastly, this black clay is succeeded by a blue,
which forms a stratum from five to six feet
thick. In these different clays we find pyrites
of a pale yellow colour, and of various fi∣gures.
. . The water found below all these
clays prevented us from penetrating any
deeper.'</P>

<P>I have given this specimen for want of a bet∣ter;
for the uncertainties with regard to the na∣ture

cannot, therefore, be too anxious in recom∣mending
to observers to be more exact in defi∣ning
the nature of those materials they attempt
to describe. They may at least distinguish
them into vitrescent and calcareous, as in the
following example.</P>
<P>The soil of Lorrain is divided into two great
zones: The eastern, which covers the chain of
<HI>Voges,</HI> which are primitive mountains, compo∣sed
entirely of vitrifiable and crystalized matters,
as granite, porphyry, jasper, and quarts, dispo∣sed
in detached blocks or groups, and not in re∣gular
strata or beds. In all this chain of moun∣tains,
there is not the smallest vestige of any
marine production; and the hills which pro∣ceed
from them consist of vitrifiable sand.
Where they terminate, and upon a continued
bounding line of their descent, the other zone
commences, which is totally calcareous, dispo∣sed
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
in horizontal beds, and replete, or rather
completely formed, of sea bodies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon, par M. l'Abbó Bexon, March 15th 1777.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The banks and beds of the earth in Peru are
perfectly horizontal, and correspond sometimes
at a great distance in different mountains, most
of which are two or three hundred fathoms
high. They are in general inaccessible, and of∣ten
as perpendicular as walls, which gives us
an opportunity of perceiving the extremities of
their horizontal strata. When any of them
happens to be round and detached from others,
each bed appears like a very flat cylinder, or a
section of a cone of no great height. These dif∣ferent
beds, placed one above another, and dis∣tinguished
by their colour and various contours,
often resemble a regular and artificial structure.
In this country, we see the mountains perpetu∣ally
assuming the appearance of ancient and
sumptuous palaces, of chapels, of castles, and
of domes. They are sometimes fortifications
composed of long curtins, and defended with
bulwarks. After examining these objects, and
the correspondence of their strata, we can hard∣ly
entertain a doubt, that the circumjacent land
has not, at some period, been really sunk. It
appears, that those mountains, whose bases were
most solidly supported, remained as monuments
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>

countries anciently possessed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bouguer, figure de la Terre, p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mountain of Birds, called in Arabic <HI>Ge∣beliter,</HI>
is so equal from top to bottom, for the
space of half a league, that it rather resembles
a wall regularly built by the hands of man,
than a rock formed in this manner by the ope∣ration
of Nature. The Nile washes this moun∣tain
a long way; and it is distant from Cairo in
Upper Egypt four and a half days journey<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage du P. Vansleb.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To these observations, I shall add a remark
made by most travellers, that, in Arabia, the
soil is of various natures. The region nearest to
Mount Libanus presents nothing but broken
and overturned rocks, and is called <HI>Arabia Pe∣trea.</HI>
The removal of the soil, by the movement
of the waters, has rendered this country almost
totally barren; whilst the lighter mud, and all
the good earth, have been carried to a greater
distance, and deposited in that part of the coun∣try
called <HI>Arabia Felix.</HI> Besides, the <HI>revers</HI> in
Arabia Felix, as well as every where else, are
more rugged toward the African sea, <HI>i. e.</HI> to
the west, than toward the Red sea, which is on
the east.</P>

<HEAD>Of the interior Rock of the Globe.</HEAD>
<P>In p. 179. I remarked, that <HI>solid rocks are
often supported by beds of earth, clay, or sand,
which have much less specific gravity. This is
the case with most hills, and is easily perceived.
But, in high mountains, the summits are not only
rocks, but these rocks are supported by others;
and this structure runs through such an extent of
country, where one mountain rises out of another,
that it is difficult to determine whether they are
founded on earth, or of what nature this earth is.
I have seen rocks cut perpendicularly for some
hundreds of feet; but these rocks rested upon other
rocks, without my being able to perceive where
they ended. May we not, however, be allowed
to conclude from the less to the greater? Since
the rocks of small mountains, the bases of which
are visible, rest upon earths less heavy and less
solid than stone, is it not reasonable to think, that
earth is likewise the basis of high mountains?</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge that this conjecture, derived
from analogy, is sufficiently founded. The
conjecture I then hazarded was written thirty-four
years ago. Since that time, I have acqui∣red
ideas and collected facts which convince me,
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
that the great mountains composed of vitrescent
materials, and produced by the action of the
primitive fire, are connected immediately with
the interior rock of the globe, which is also a
vitreous rock of the same kind. These great
mountains are a part of this immense rock, and
are only prolongations or eminences formed up∣on
the surface of the globe at the time of its
consolidation. Hence we ought to regard them
as constituent parts of the original mass of the
earth. But the hills or smaller mountains,
which rest upon clay or vitrifiable sand, have
been formed by the motion and sediments of
the waters, at a time long posterior to the for∣mation
of the great mountains by the primitive
sire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The internal parts of the primitive mountains which I have penetrated, either in pits or in the galleries of mines, to the depth of twelve and fifteen hundred feet, are entirely com∣posed of <HI>pure</HI> vitreous <HI>rock,</HI> in which there are slight and irre∣gular fissures, through which the water issues, and vitriolic and metallic solutions. From this fact we may conclude, that the whole nucleus of these mountains is a pure rock, adhering to the primitive mass of the globe. We indeed find, upon their sides, and upon the margins of the valleys, masses of clayey earth, and banks of calcareous stones, at considerable depths. But these are only the remains of those materials which filled up the cavities of the earth, and must be referred to the second epoch of Nature; <HI>Note communicated by M. de Grignon to M. de Buffon, Aug.</HI> 6. 1777.</NOTE>. It is in these points or projections which
form the nucleus of mountains, that the veins
of metals, though their height be considerable,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
are not of the highest kind, but of a mean
height, and uniformly arranged, <HI>i. e.</HI> they rise
by gradual elevations, and are connected with a
considerable chain of mountains, which are oc∣casionally
interrupted by valleys.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Vitrification of Calcareous Substances.</HEAD>
<P>In page 184. I said, that <HI>calcareous bodies are
alone incapable of being vitrified, and seem to
form a distinct class. All other substances may
be converted into glass.</HI></P>
<P>I had not then made those experiments which
have since convinced me, that calcareous sub∣stances,
like all others, may be reduced to
glass. To produce this effect, nothing more is
necessary than a fire more violent than that of
our common furnaces. I reduced lime-stone to
glass by a good burning glass. Besides, M. d'Ar∣cet,
an able chymist, melted calcareous spar,
without the addition of any other matter, by
means of a porcelain furnace belonging to M. le
Compte de Lauragais. But these operations
were performed several years after the publica∣tion
of my <HI>Theory of the earth.</HI> I knew only
that, in the iron furnaces, the light, white,
spungy matter, similar to pumice-stone, which
issues from them when over-heated, is nothing
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
but a vitreous substance, proceeding from the
calcareous bodies thrown into the furnace to as∣sist
the fusion of the iron-ore. The sole diffe∣rence
between the vitrification of calcareous and
vitrescent substances is, that the latter are immedi∣ately
vitrified by the action of a violent fire a∣lone;
but calcareous bodies, before they are vi∣trified,
pass through a state of calcination, and
form a line. But, like all other substances, they
vitrify, even in our common furnaces, whene∣ver
they are mixed with vitrescent matters, e∣specially
with those which, like the <HI>aubuë,</HI> or
slimy earth, yield most easily to the fire. Hence
we may safely conclude, that, in general, every
material of which this globe is composed, may
be reduced to its primitive state of glass, if a
sufficient degree of heat is applied.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Eossil and Petrified Shells.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what I have written, p. 202. on the
subject of the Italian letter, in which it is
remarked by this author, that <HI>the pilgrims brought
from Syria, in the time of the Crusades, those
shells peculiar to the Levant, which are now
found petrified in France, in Italy, and in other
parts of Christendom,</HI> I find that I have not
treated M. de Voltaire with sufficient respect.
I acknowledge, that I should rather have ta∣ken
no notice of this opinion, than revived it
with a jest, especially as humour is not my ta∣lent,
and as this is perhaps the only example
of pleasantry in all my works. M. de Voltaire is
a man whose superiority of genius merits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This apology was published in the year 1778.</NOTE> the
highest regard. I was furnished with this letter
at the very time I was correcting the sheet which
contains the passage in question. I read part of
it only, imagining it to be the production of
some learned Italian, who, from mere historical
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
knowledge, had followed his own prejudices,
without consulting Nature; and it was not till
after my volume on the Theory of the Earth was
printed, that I knew the letter was written by
M. de Voltaire. I then sincerely regretted the
expressions I had used. This truth I thought it
incumbent on me to make public, as well for the
sake of M. de Voltaire, as for my own and that
of posterity, to whom I would not leave a doubt
of the high esteem I have always had for a man
of such uncommon talents, and who has done
so much honour to human nature and to the age
in which he lived.</P>
<P>As the authority of M. de Voltaire made an
impression upon some persons, others have en∣deavoured
to discover whether his objection,
with regard to the shells found below ground,
has any foundation. Upon this subject, I shall
subjoin an extract of a memoir which was trans∣mitted
to me, and which appears to have been
written with that intention.</P>
<P>In traversing the different provinces of France,
and even of Italy, 'I every where saw,' le P.
Chabenat remarks, 'figured stones; and, in par∣ticular
places, their number was so great, and
they were arranged in such a manner, that it
was impossible not to be satisfied, that these parts
of the earth had formerly been covered with
the sea. I saw shells of every kind, which were
perfectly similar both in figure and size to those
which now exist. This observation was suffi∣cient
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
to convince me, that all these individuals
were of different ages, but of the same species.
I saw cornua ammonis from half an inch to
near three fect in diameter. I saw cockles of all
sizes, as well as other bivalves and univalves. I
likewise saw belemnites,' sea mushrooms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>'The form and number of these figured stones
prove, in the most incontestible manner, that
they were formerly animals which existed
in the ocean. The shells with which the
moulds are covered seem to remove every
doubt upon this subject; for, in particular spe∣cimens,
it is equally lustrous, fresh, and natu∣ral,
as in the living animal. If separated from
the mould or nucleus, we could not believe
that it was petrified. The same observation is
applicable to many other figured stones found
in that beautiful and extensive plain, which
stretches from Montauban to Toulouse, and
from Toulouse to Alby, as well as to the cir∣cumjacent
places. The whole of this vast plain
is covered with vegetable soil from half a foot
to two feet thick. Below the soil there is a bed
of coarse gravel about two feet in thickness.
The gravel is succeeded by a bed of fine sand,
which is nearly of an equal thickness; and the
rock lies immediately under this bed of sand. I
have repeatedly examined the gravel with the
greatest attention, and I found it interspersed
with an infinite number of figured stones of
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
the same form, but of various sizes. I likewise
found a number of sea hedge-hogs, and other
stones of a regular figure, and perfectly simi∣lar.
All these facts announce, in language the
most expressive, that this country, as well as
many others, had formerly been the bottom of
the sea, which, by some sudden revolution, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
retired, and left its various productions behind.
I shall, however, suspend my judgment. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
account of M. de Voltaire's objections, to re∣move
which, experience and observation must
be united.'</P>
<P>Le P. Chabenat next subjoins several experi∣ments
to prove, that the shells found in the earth
are the same with those which still exist in the
sea. These experiments I shall not relate, be∣cause
they contain nothing new; and every man
is satisfied, that fossil and marine shells are pre∣cisely
of the same nature. Le P. Chabenat con∣cludes
his Memoir with remarking, that 'all the
shells found in the bowels of the earth are un∣questionably
real shells, and relicks of animals
whose element is the ocean, which had former∣ly
covered these countries; and, consequently,
that the objections of M. de Voltaire are ill
founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoir manuscrit sur les pierres figurées, par le P. Chabenat. Mountauban, Oct. 8. 1773.</NOTE>.'</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the places where Shells are found, p. 204.</HEAD>
<P>TO the enumeration I have given of the great
quantities of shells found in all parts of the world,
I might add many particular observations which
have been communicated to me during these last
thirty-four years. I have received letters from
the American islands, by which I am assured, that,
in almost all of them, shells are found, either pe∣trified
or in their natural state, in the interior
parts of the earth, and often below the first stra∣tum
or vegetable soil. In the Malouine islands,
M. de Bougainville found stones which divided
into thin plates or leaves, and upon which were
impressions of fossil shells, of a species unknown
in these seas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage autour du monde, tom. 1. p. 100.</NOTE>. To the same purpose I have
letters from several parts of India and of Africa.
Don <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lloa informs us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 314. de son Voyage.</NOTE>, that, in that district of
Chili which extends from Talca Guano to Con∣ception,
different kinds of shells are found in
great numbers, and without any mixture of earth;
and that these shells are used to make lime. He
adds, that this peculiarity would not be so re∣markable,
if these shells were found only in low
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
places which might be covered with the sea. But
what is singular, he remarks, that the same heaps
of shells are found in the hills at the height of
fifty fathoms above the level of the sea. I relate
this fact, not because it is singular, but because
it corresponds with all the others, and is the on∣ly
one known to me concerning fossil sells in
this part of the world, where I am persuaded
that petrified shells will be found as well as
every where else, at heights much greater
than fifty fathoms above the level of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
for the same Don Ulloa has since found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
shells in the mountains of Peru at the height of
above 2000 fathoms; and, according to M.
Kalm, shells are seen in North America upon the
tops of several hills: He tells us, that he saw
them on the summit of the Blue Mountains.
They have also been found in the chalk quarries
near Montreal, in certain stones near Lake
Champlain in Canada<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1752, p. 194.</NOTE>, and in the most north∣ern
regions of this New Continent; for the
Greenlanders believe, that the world had been
drowned by a deluge, and, in evidence of this
event, they quote the shells and the bones of
whales which cover the most elevated mountains
of their country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de M. Crantz; <HI>Hist. gen. des voyages, tom.</HI> 19. <HI>p.</HI> 105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If from this we pass to Siberia, we shall find
the same proof, of the ancient abode of the
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon all our Continents. Near the moun∣tain
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are other mountains less e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the summits of which we find heaps
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> well preserved both in figure and natu∣ral
colours. These shells are all empty, and
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of them fall into powder as soon as they
are touched. <HI>The sea of this country produces
no shells similar to those found on the tops of
mountains.</HI> The largest of these shells exceed not
an inch in breadth, and others are very small<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Relation de Mess. Gmelin et Muller; <HI>Hist. gen. des voya∣ges, tom</HI> 18. <HI>p</HI> 34<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But I can exhibit facts which are still more
obvious. Every man, in his own province, has
only to open his eyes, and he will see shells in
all places where lime-stone is found, as also in
most clays, though, in general, marine produc∣tions
are more rare in clays than in calcareous
substances.</P>
<P>In the territory of Dunkirk, on the top of
the mountain of the Recollets, near that of Cas∣sel,
and at 400 feet above the level of the sea,
there is a horizontal stratum of shells, which
are so closely packed together that most of them
are broken. Above this stratum, there is a bed
of earth from seven to eight feet deep. These
shells are situated at the distance of six leagues
from the sea, and they are of the same species
with those found on its coast<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour la subdelegation de Dunkerque, relativement à l'Histoire naturelle de ce canton.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48"/>
In Mount Gannelon, near Anet, and at some
distance from Compiegne, there are several
quarries of excellent lime-stone. Between the
different strata of the lime-stone we find gravel
mixed with an infinite number of sea-shells, or
portions of shells, which are very light and
friable. In the same place, there are common
oyster-shells in fine preservation, and extend
more than a league and a quarter in length. In
one of these quarries, there are three strata of
shells in different states. In two of these strata,
they are so much broke, that their species cannot be
distinguished: But, in the third, there are oysters,
which have suffered no alteration, but that of
being excessively dried. The nature, figure, and
enamel of the shells, are the same as in the live
animals. These shells have acquired a great
lightness, and easily exfoliate. The lime-stone
quarries are situated at the foot of the mountain,
and have a small declivity. In descending to∣wards
the plain, we find oysters, which are
neither dreid nor have undergone any change,
but have the same weight, and the same ena∣mel
with those which are daily taken out of the
sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'une Lettre de M. Leschevin à M. de Buffon; <HI>Compiegnie, Oct.</HI> 8. 1772.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Paris, these ma∣rine
shells are not less common. The marl
pits of Bougival furnish a kind of middle-sized
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
oysters. They are not entire, but cut in
different directions, and finely polished. Near
Belleville, where free-stone is quarried, we find
a mass of sand in the earth, which contains
branched bodies, which may have been corals
or madrepores converted into stone. These ma∣rine
bodies are not in the sand alone, but in the
stones, which likewise contain shells of different
kinds, as volutes, univalves, and bivalves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de M. Guettard; <HI>Acad. des Sciences, anneé</HI> 1764, <HI>p.</HI> 492.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Switzerland is not less abundant in fossil ma∣rine
bodies than France and the other countries
we have mentioned. In Mount Pilate, in the
canton of Lucerne, we find petrified sea-shells,
and the bodies and relicks of fishes. In the same
mountain, there are corals, and slates which ea∣sily
exfoliate, and, between the leaves, a fish is
generally found. Some years ago, the jaws,
and even entire heads of fishes, together with
their teeth, were discovered<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Promenade au Mont Pilate; <HI>Journal étranger, mois de Mars,</HI> 1756.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Altman remarks, that, in one of the
highest parts of the Alps, near Grindelvald,
where the famous glaciers (Gletchers) are form∣ed,
there are fine marble quarries, which he
has represented in one of the engravings of
these mountains. The marble quarries are only
a few paces distant from the glacier. The mar∣ble
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
is of various colours, as white, yellow, jasper,
red, and green. The marble is drawn on sledges
above the snow as far as Underseen, where they
are embarked to be carried to Berne by lake
Thorne, and afterwards by the river Are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essai de la description des Alpes glaciales, par M. Alt∣man.</NOTE>.
Thus marble and calcareous stones are found,
at great heights, in this part of the Alps.</P>
<P>M. Cappeler, in making researches on Mount
Grimsel, one of the Alps, has remarked, that
the hills and smaller mountains which limit the
valleys, are mostly composed of free-stone, of
a grain more or less fine and close. The tops
of these mountains generally consist of lime∣stone,
of various colours and hardness. The
mountains more elevated than these calcareous
rocks, are composed of granite and other stones,
which appear to be of the nature of granite and
of emery. It is in these granity stones that rock∣crystal
begins to be formed. But, in the lime∣stone
rocks below, we find nothing but spar
and calcareous concretions. In general, it has
been remarked, concerning shells of every kind,
whether fossil or petrified, that certain species
are always found together, and that others are
never met with in these places. The same thing
happens in the ocean, where particular species
of testaceous animals are constantly found toge∣ther,
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
in the same manner as certain plants al∣ways
grow together on the surface of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres philosophiques de M. Bourguet, <HI>Biblioth. raison∣née, mois d' Avril, Mai, et Juin,</HI> 1730.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been too generally believed, that, there
are no shells, or other productions of the sea,
on the highest mountains. It is true, that there
are several summits, and a great number of peaks,
which are entirely composed of granite and vitrifi∣able
rocks, and in which no mixture can be per∣ceived.
These contain neither the moulds of shells,
nor the relicks of any marine bodies. But there
is a much greater number of mountains, and
some of them very high, where these relicks
are to be found. M. Costa, professor of anato∣my
and botany in the university of Perpignan,
in the year 1774, discovered, some fathoms be∣low
the top of Mount Nas, situated in the mid∣dle
of the Spanish Cerdagne, and one of the most
elevated parts of the Pyrennees, a great number
of lenticular stones, <HI>i. e.</HI> blocks composed of
lenticular stones, and these blocks were of dif∣ferent
figures and different sizes; the largest
might weigh from forty to fifty pounds. He
remarked, that the part of the mountain where
these lenticular stones were found, seemed to
have formerly sunk; for, in this place, he saw
an irregular, oblique depression, very much in∣clined
to the horizon; and one of its extremities
respected the top, and the other the bottom of
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
the mountain. He could not distinctly perceive
the dimensions of this depression, because most
of it was covered with snow, though it was the
month of August. The banks of rocks which
surrounded these lenticular stones, as well as
those immediately below, are calcareous for
more than a hundred fathoms. This Mount
Nas, to judge of it by the eye, seems to be as
high as Canigou, and presents no vestige of a
volcano.</P>
<P>A thousand other examples of marine shells,
found in an infinity of places, as well in France
as in different parts of Europe, might be given.
But such an enumeration of particular facts,
which are already too much multiplied, would
swell this work, without answering any useful
purpose. From the whole, however, we can∣not
refrain from drawing this obvious conclu∣sion,
that all the inhabited parts of the earth
have formerly, and during a very long course
of time, been covered with the waters of the
ocean.</P>
<P>I shall only remark, that these sea-shells are
found in different states. Some of them are
petrifactions, or stones moulded into the form
of shells; and others are in the same state as
they still exist in the ocean. The quantity of
petrisied shells, which are nothing but stones
figured by shells, is infinitely greater than that
of fossil shells, and they are never found toge∣ther,
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
nor even in places contiguous; it is only
in the neighbourhood, and some leagues di∣stant
from the sea, that we find beds of shells
in their natural state, and these are commonly
the same with those which exist in the adjacent
seas. Petrified shells, on the contrary, are
found, almost every where, at great distances
from the sea, and on the highest hills, many
species of which belong not to our seas, and seve∣ral
of them have no existing representatives; such
as those ancient species we formerly mentioned,
which only existed when the globe was much
warmer. Of more than a hundred species of
cornua ammonis, remarks one of our learned A∣cademicians,
with which we are acquainted, and
which are found in the environs of Paris, of
Rouen, of Dive, of Langres, and of Lyons, as
well as in the Cevernes, in Provence, in Poi∣tou,
in Britain, in Spain, and in other countries
of Europe, there is but one species, called the
<HI>Nautilus papyraceus,</HI> found in our seas, and five
or six others produced in foreign seas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, anneé 1772, p. 24<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>

<HI>It is probable that the cornu ammonis,
and some other species found only in a petri∣fied
state, belong to the former, and that they
have been impregnated with stony matter in the
very places where they are discovered. It is also
probable, that the specie of some animals have
been extinguished, and that these shells may be
ranked among this number. The extraordinary
fossil bones found in Siberia, in Canada, in Ire∣land,
and several other places, seem to confirm
this conjecture; for no animal has hitherto been
discovered to whom bones of such enormous size
could possibly belong.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this passage I have to make two impor∣tant
remarks:</P>
<P>1. That these cornua ammonis, which are so
different from each other both in figure and
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
size, seem to form rather a genus than a species
in the class of shell animals, are really the re∣licks
of so many species which have perished,
and no longer subsist. I have seen some of
them so small, that they exceed not a line, and
others so large that they were more than three
feet in diameter. Observers worthy of credit
have assured me, that that they have seen some
still larger, and particularly one of eight feet in
diameter, and one foot thick. These different
cornua ammonis seem to form distinct species.
Some of them are more or less fluted. They
are all spiral; but they terminate differently,
both at their centres and at their extremities.
These animals, formerly so numerous, are no
longer found in any of our seas. They are
known to us by their relicks only; and the im∣mensity
of their number cannot be better repre∣sented
than by an example which I have daily
before my eyes. In the iron mine near Etivey,
(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leagues from my forge of Buffon), which
has been wrought 150 years, and has supplied
the iron works of Aisy during all that time,
there are such quantities of cornua ammonis,
entire and in fragments, that the greatest part
of the ore seems to have been moulded in these
shells. The mine of Conflans in Lorrain, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnace of Saint Loup in Franche∣co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
is likewise entirely composed of belem∣nites
and cornua ammonis. These last ferrugi∣nous
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
shells are so different in size, that they
weigh from a drachm to two hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de physique de M. Grignon, p. 378.</NOTE>.
Other places might be mentioned where they
equally abound. In the same manner, we find
belemnites, lenticular stones, and moulds of
many other shells, which now no longer exist
in any part of the ocean, though they are al∣most
universally diffused over the surface of the
earth. I am persuaded that all these lost species
formerly subsisted during the time that the tem∣perature
of the earth and waters was warmer
than it is at present; and that, in proportion as
the globe cools, other species, which now exist,
will perish like the former, for want of heat
sufficient to support them.</P>
<P>2. That some of those enormous bones,
which I thought had belonged to unknown ani∣mals,
whose species was supposed to be lost,
have, nevertheless, after the most accurate exa∣mination,
appeared to belong to the elephant
and hippopotamus, but to species of these animals
much larger than those which now exist. Of
land-animals I know only one species which is
lost; and it is that of the animals whose grinding
teeth, with their just dimensions, are represent∣ed
in plates I. II. III. The other large teeth
and bones which I have collected belonged to
the elephant and hippopotamus.</P>

Our mathematicians who were sent to Peru, as
well as some other travellers, have measured the
height of these mountains above the level of the
South Sea. Some of them were measured geo∣metrically,
and others by the barometer, which,
being subject to little variation in that climate,
gives the heights nearly as exact as a geometrical
measurement. The following are the results of
their observations.</P>

<P>By comparing the heights of the mountains
of South America with those of our Continent,
we will perceive that, in general, they are one
fourth part higher than the mountains of Eu∣rope,
and that almost the whole of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been
and actually are volcano's. But even the highest
mountains in the interior parts of Europe, Asia,
and Africa, have been extinguished long beyond
the record of history. It is true, that, in several
of these last mountains, we evidently recognise
the ancient existence of volcano's, as well by
the black and burnt sides of precipices, as by
the nature of the matters which surround them,
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
and which extend along the ridges of the moun∣tains.
But, as these mountains are situated in the
interior parts of Continents, and now very di∣stant
from the sea, the action of the subterrane∣ous
fires, which cannot produce great effects but
by the shock of water, ceased after the seas re∣tired.
It is for this reason, that, in the Corde∣liers,
whose roots may be said to border upon the
South Sea, most of the peaks are actual volcano's;
whilst the volcano's of Auvergne, Vivarais,
Languedoc, Germany, Switzerland, &amp;c. in Eu∣rope,
and those of Mount Ararat in Asia, and of
Mount Atlas in Africa, have long been abso∣lutely
extinct.</P>
<P>The height at which vapours freeze is about
2400 fathoms in the Torrid Zone, and about
1500 in France. The tops of high mountains
sometimes surpass this line from 800 to 900
fathoms, and all this space is covered with snow
which never melts. The highest clouds rise not
above 300 or 400 fathoms above these moun∣tains,
and consequently exceed the level of the sea
about 3600 fathoms. Hence, if the mountains
were still higher, we should see, in the Torrid
Zone, a belt of snow commencing at 2400 fa∣thoms
above the level of the sea, and terminating
at 3500 or 3600 fathoms, not on account of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essation of the cold, which augments in propor∣tion
to the elevation, but because the vapours
would not rise higher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> des Sciences, année 1744.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60"/>
M. de Keralio, a learned philosopher, has col∣lected
the heights of the mountains in several
countries, from the measurements of different
persons.</P>
<P>In Greece, M. Bernoulli determined the height
of Mount Olympus to be 1017 fathoms. Hence
the snow cannot lie upon it perpetually; neither
can snow lie constantly on Pelion in Thessaly,
nor on Cathalylium and Cyllene; because the
height of these mountains does not rise to the
freezing degree. M. Bougner assigns 2500 fa∣thoms
as the height of the Peak of Teneriff, the
top of which is always covered with snow.
Mount Aetna, the Norwegian Mountains, the
Hemus, the Athos, the Atlas, the Caucasus, and
several others, such as Mounts Ararat, Taurus,
and Libanus, are perpetually covered with snow,
near their summits.</P>

<P>It is certain, that the chief mountains of Swit∣zerland

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Direction of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>In vol. I. p. 240. I remarked, that <HI>the direction
of the great mountains of America is from north to
south, and that those of the Old Continent run
from west to east.</HI> This last assertion requires to
be modified; for though, at first sight, we may
follow the mountains as far as China, by passing
from the Pyrennees in Auvergne, to the Alps in
Germany, and in Macedonia, to Caucasus and
other mountains of Asia, as far as the Tartarian
sea; and though Mount Atlas, in the same man∣ner,
appears to traverse the Continent of Africa
from west to east, the middle of this vast penin∣sula
may still consist of a chain of high moun∣tains
stretching from Mount Atlas to the Moun∣tains
of the Moon, and from these to the Cape
of Good Hope: In this view, the middle of the
Continent of Africa may be considered as con∣sisting
of mountains which run from north to
south through its whole extent, like the moun∣tains
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
of America. Those parts of Mount At∣las
which traverse Africa from west to east,
should be considered as branches only of the
principal chain. The mountains of the Moon,
which run from west to east, may likewise be
regarded as collateral branches; and, if there are
no volcano's in this prodigious range of moun∣tains,
it may be owing to the vast distance of
the sea from the middle regions of Africa;
whilst, in America, the sea is very near the foot
of the high mountains, which, instead of occu∣pying
the middle of the peninsula of South
America, are all situated to the west; and the
extensive low lands are entirely on the east side.</P>
<P>The great chain of the Cordeliers are not
the only mountains of America which run from
north to south. In the territory of Guiana, a∣bout
one hundred and fifty leagues from Cay∣enne,
there is a chain of pretty high moun∣tains,
which also extends from north to south.
On the Cayenne side, this chain is so steep, that
these mountains are almost inaccessible. This
steepness seems to indicate, that, on the other
side, the declivity is gentle, and consists of fine
land. The tradition of the country, according∣ly,
or rather the testimony of the Spaniards, is,
that, beyond the mountains, there are populous
nations of savages united into regular societies.
It is likewise said, that there is a gold mine in
these mountains, and a lake in which grains of
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
gold are found: But this fact requires confir∣mation.</P>
<P>In Europe, the chain of mountains which be∣gins
in Spain, and passes through France, Ger∣many,
and Hungary, divides into two great
branches, one of which extends into Asia by
the mountains of Macedonia, Caucasus, &amp;c.
and the other branch stretches from Hungary
into Poland and Russia, and extends as far as
the sources of the Wolga and Boristhenes; and,
stretching still farther, it joins another chain in
Siberia, and terminates in the north sea to the
west of the river Oby. These chains of moun∣tains
ought to be regarded as one continued
ridge, from which several large rivers derive
their sources: Some of these rivers, as the Ta∣gus,
and the Doura in Spain, the Garonne and
the Loire in France, and the Rhine in Germany,
empty themselves into the ocean; others, as the
Oder, the Vistula, and the Niemen, fall into
the Baltic sea; others, as the Dwina, fall into
the White sea, and the river Petzora empties
itself into the Frozen sea. On the east side, this
chain of mountains gives rise to the Yeucar and
Ebre in Spain, to the Rhone in France, and to
the Po in Italy, which fall into the Mediter∣ranean;
to the Danube and Don, which lose
themselves in the Black Sea; and, lastly, to the
Wolga, which falls into the Caspian.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65"/>
Norway is full of rocks and groups of moun∣tains.
There are plains, however, which ex∣tend,
without interruption, six, eight, and ten
miles. Their direction is not from west to east,
like that of the other European mountains. On
the contrary, they stretch, like the Cordeliers,
from south to north<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. de Norwege, par Pontoppidan. <HI>Journai étran∣ger. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d' Aout,</HI> 1755.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the south of Asia, from the island of Cey∣lon
to Cape Comorin, there is a chain of moun∣tains
which separates Malabar from Coroman∣del,
traverses the Mogul country, joins Mount
Caucasus, stretches through the country of the
Calmucks, and terminates in the North Sea to
the east of the Irtis. Another chain extends
from north to south as far as Razatgat in Ara∣bia,
and may be traced, at some distance from
the Dead Sea, as far as Jerusalem: It surrounds
the extremity of the Mediterranean, and the
point of the Black Sea, from which it traverses
Russia, and terminates in the North Sea.</P>
<P>We may likewise remark, that the mountains
of Indostan and those of Siam run from south
to north, and both unite with the rocks of Thi∣bet
and Tartary. Each side of these mountains
presents a different season: On the west, they
have six months of rain, while, on the east,
they enjoy the finest weather<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Phil. et Polit. tom. 2. p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="66"/>
All the mountains of Switzerland, as those
of the Vallese and the Grisons, those of Savoy,
Piedmont, and Tirol, from a chain, which ex∣tends,
from north to south, as far as the Me∣diterranean.
Mount Pelate, which is situated
in the centre of Lucerne, nearly in the centre
of Switzerland, forms a chain of about fourteen
leagues, extending from north to south as far
as the canton of Bern.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, conclude in general, that
the greatest eminences of this globe are situated
from north to south, and that those which run
in other directions ought to be regarded as col∣lateral
branches only of these primitive moun∣tains:
And, it is partly by this disposition of
the primitive mountains, that all the points or
terminations of continents are either south or
north; as appears from the points of Africa, of
America, of California, of Groenland, of Cape
Comorin, of Sumatra, of New Holland, &amp;c.
This fact seems to prove, as formerly remarked,
that the waters have proceeded in greater quan∣tities
from the south than from the north pole.</P>
<P>If we consult a new map of the world, in
which are represented, round the Arctic Pole,
all the lands of the four quarters of the globe,
except the north point of America, and, round
the Antarctic Pole, all the seas, and the small
portions of land to be found in the southern
hemisphere, we shall evidently perceive, that
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
many more revolutions have happened in the
latter than in the former hemisphere, and that
the quantity of water has always been, and still
is, much greater there than in our hemisphere.
Every thing concurs in proving, that the greatest
inequalities of the globe exist in the southern re∣gions,
and that the general direction of the pri∣mitive
mountains is from north to south, rather
than from east to west, through the whole ex∣tent
of the earth's surface.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the formation of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the valleys and dales on the surface of
the globe, as well as all the mountains and hills,
have originated from two causes, namely, fire
and water. When the earth first assumed its
consistence, a number of inequalities took place
on its surface; swellings and blisters arose, as
happens in a block of glass or of melted metal.
Hence this first cause produced the original and
the highest mountains, which rest on the inte∣rior
rock of the earth as their base, and below
which, as every where else, there must have
been vast caverns, which sunk in at different
periods. But, without considering this second
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
event, the falling in of the caverns, it is cer∣tain,
that, when the earth first consolidated, it
was every where furrowed with depths and e∣minences,
which were produced solely by the
action of cooling▪ Afterwards, when the wa∣ters
were precipitated from the atmosphere,
which happened when the earth cooled so much
as to be unable to repel the vapours, these wa∣ters
covered the whole surface of the globe to
the height of two thousand fathoms; and, du∣ring
their long abode upon our continents, the
motion of the tides and that of the currents,
changed the disposition of the primitive moun∣tains
and valleys. These movements would
form hills in the valleys, and would cover the
bottoms and knaps of the mountains with new
beds of earth; and the currents would produce
furrows or valleys with corresponding angles.
It is to these two causes, of which the one is
much more ancient than the other, that the pre∣sent
external form of the surface of the earth is
to be referred. Afterwards, when the seas sunk
down, they produced those steep precipices on
the west, where they ran with the greatest ra∣pidity,
and left gentle declivities on the east.</P>
<P>The structure of those eminences which were
formed by the sediments of the ocean, is very
different from that of those which owe their o∣rigin
to the primitive fire. The first are dis∣posed
in horizontal beds, and contain an infi∣nite
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
number of marine productions. The se∣cond,
on the contrary, are less regular in their
structure, and include no marks of sea-bodies.
These mountains of the first and second forma∣tion,
have nothing in common but the perpendi∣cular
fissures; but these fissures are effected by
two different causes. The vitrescent matters, in
cooling, diminished in size, and, of course, they
split, and receded to different distances. But
those composed of calcarious matters transported
by the waters, split into fissures solely by dry∣ing.</P>
<P>I have often remarked, that, in detached hills,
the first effect of the rains is gradually to carry
down from the summit the earth and other bo∣dies,
which form at the foot a pretty thick stra∣tum
of good soil, while the top is left entirely
bare. This effect is, and necessarily must be,
produced by the rains. But a previous cause
disposed these and similar matters round all hills,
not excepting those which are detached; for,
on one side, the earth is uniformly better than
on the other: The hills are always steep and
precipitant on one side, and have a gentle de∣clivity
on the other; which proves clearly that
the action, as well as the direction of the mo∣tion
of the waters, were greater on one side
than on the other.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Density which certain matters acquire by
Fire, as well as by Water.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 246, I said, <HI>that the hard points found
in free-stone consisted of metallic matter, which
appeared to have been melted by a strong fire.</HI>
This assertion seems to insinuate that the great
masses of free-stone have originated from the
action of the primitive fire. I at first imagined
that this matter owed its density and the ad∣hesion
of its particles solely to the interven∣tion
of water. But I have since learned that
the action of fire produces the same effect; and
I shall relate some experiments which at first
surprised me, but which I have repeated so of∣ten
as to remove every doubt upon this sub∣ject.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="experiments">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>I pounded free-stones of different degrees of
hardness, till they were reduced to a powder
more or less fine. These powders I employed
to cover the cements I used in converting iron
into steel. This powder of free-stone was strew∣ed
over the cement, and heaped up, in the
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
form of a dome of three or four inches in thick∣ness,
on an earthen vessel of three feet long by
two broad. After undergoing the action of the
fire in my blast furnaces, during several days
and nights without interruption, it was no long∣er
the powder of free-stone, but a mass so solid
that we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liged to break it in order to un∣cover
the vessel which contained the iron, now
converted into steel. The action of fire upon
this powder of free-stone produced masses e∣qually
solid as free-stone of a middling quality,
which does not ring under the hammer. This
fact showed that fire, as well as water, could
prove a cement to vitrifiable sand, and, conse∣quently,
might have formed those immense
masses of free-stone which compose the nucleus
of some of our mountains.</P>
<P>I am, therefore, fully persuaded, that all the
vitrescent matters, of which the interior rock of
the globe, as well as the nuclei of great moun∣tains,
are composed, have been produced by
the action of the primitive fire; and that the
waters have only formed those accessory strata
which surround these nuclei, which are all pa∣rallel
and horizontal, or equally inclined, and
in which we find the relicks of shells and other
productions of the ocean.</P>
<P>In the formation of free-stone and other vi∣trescent
matters, I pretend not to exclude the
intervention of water. On the contrary, I am
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
inclined to believe, that vitrifiable sand may ac∣quire
consistence, and unite into masses more or
less hard, perhaps more easily by means of wa∣ter
than by the action of fire. I have related
the above facts solely with the view of prevent∣ing
objections which would not fail to be made,
if it had been thought that I attributed the soli∣dity
of free-stones, and other bodies composed
of vitrifiable sand, to the intervention of water
alone. It is certain, that all the free-stone found
on the surface, or at inconsiderable depths, have
been formed by water; for, on the surface of
these masses of free-stone, we perceive marks of
undulations and rollings, and sometimes the im∣pressions
of plants and shells. But the free-stones
formed by the sediments of water are ea∣sily
distinguished from those which have been
produced by fire. The latter have a coarser
grain, and crumble down more easily than free-stone
cemented by the intervention of water,
which is more compact, and harder than that
whose particles have been united by the action
of fire.</P>
<P>Ferruginous matters assume a great degree of
hardness by fire; for nothing is harder than cast
iron. But ferruginous bodies may likewise ac∣quire
considerable density by the intervention of
water. Of this fact I was ascertained by put∣ting
a quantity of filings of iron into vessels ex∣posed
to the rain. These filings formed a mass
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
so hard, that it could only be broken by the
hammer.</P>
<P>The vitreous rock which composes the inte∣rior
mass of the globe, is harder than common
glass. But it is not harder than certain volcanic
lavas, and much softer than cast iron, which,
however, is only glass mixed with ferruginous
particles. This great hardness of the interior
rock shows that it consists of the most fixed par∣ticles
of matter, and that, from the time of their
consolidation, they assumed the consistence and
hardness which they still possess. Hence it can∣not
be objected to my hypothesis of general vi∣trification,
that bodies reduced to glass by our
furnaces are less hard than the rock of the globe;
since cast iron, some lavas, or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>salts, and even
certain porcelains, are harder than this rock,
and yet they derive their hardness from the ac∣tion
of fire alone. Besides, the elements of
iron and other minerals which give hardness to
matters liquified by fire, or attenuated by water,
existed, as well as the fixed earth, from the
time that the globe was first consolidated: And
I have already remarked, that the interior rock
ought not to be regarded as pure glass, similar
to that we make with sand and salts, but as a
vitreous product mixed with matters the most
fixed, and most capable of supporting the great
and long continued action of the primitive fire,
the great effects of which can only be compared
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
in a very distant manner with the inconside∣rable
operations of our furnaces; and yet, from
this comparison, though unfavourable, we clear∣ly
perceive what effects are common to the pri∣mitive
fire and to our furnaces; and it shows, at
the same time, that the degree of hardness de∣pends
less on the degree of heat than on the
combination of matters submitted to its action.</P>

<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the inclination of the Strata in the Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>I remarked, in Vol. I. p. 15. that, <HI>in plains, the
strata are exactly horizontal. It is in the moun∣tains
only that they are inclined to the horizon;
because they have originally been formed by sedi∣ments
deposited upon an inclined base.</HI></P>
<P>The beds of calcarious matters are not only
horizontal in the plains, but likewise in all
mountains which have not been disturbed by
earthquakes or other accidental causes: And,
when the strata are inclined, the whole moun∣tain
is likewise inclined, and has been forced in∣to
that position by a subterraneous explosion,
or by the sinking of a part of the earth, which
had served it as a basis. We may therefore
conclude, in general, that all strata formed by
the sediments of water are horizontal, like the
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
water itself, except those which have been form∣ed
on an inclined base, as is the case with the
most part of coal-mines.</P>
<P>The most external part of the earth, whether
in plains or mountains, is solely composed of ve∣getable
earth, which owes its origin to sediments
of the air, of vapours, and of dews, and to the
successive destruction of herbs, leaves, and o∣ther
parts of decomposed plants. This first stra∣tum

At some distance from the last branch of the Nile, there is a mountain composed of gra∣nite, of prophyry, and of jasper, which extends more than twenty leagues in length, by perhaps an equal number in breadth. The surface of the summit of this enormous quarry, we are assured, is absolutely devoid of vegetables, and forms a vast des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, where neither quadrupeds, nor birds, nor even insects, can exist.

The vegetable stratum is commonly much thick∣er
in valleys than on hills; and its formation is
posterior to that of the primitive strata of the

which have been formed by fire, and the new∣est

from matters transported and deposited in the

form of sediments by the motion of the waters.
These, in general, are horizontal; and it is only
by the action of particular causes that they some∣times
appear inclined. The beds of calcarious
stones are commonly horizontal, or slightly in∣clined;
and, of all calcarious substances, the
beds of chalk preserve their horizontal position
most exactly. As chalk is only the dust of de∣cayed
calcarious bodies, it has been deposited
by waters whose movements were tranquil, and
their oscillations regular; whilst the matters
which were only broken into large masses, have
been transported by currents, and deposited by
the removal of the waters; which is the reason
why their strata are not so perfectly horizontal
as those of chalk. The high coasts of Norman∣dy
are composed of horizontal strata of chalk so
regularly perpendicular, that, at a distance, they
have the appearance of fortified walls. Be∣tween
the strata of chalk there are small beds of
black flint, which give rise to the black veins in
white marble.</P>
<P>Beside the calcarious shells, the strata of which
are slightly inclined, and whose position has ne∣ver
been changed, there are many others which
have been deranged by different accidents, and
which are all much inclined. Of these there
are many examples in various parts of the Py∣rennees,

great changes have been produced in these
mountains by the sinking of subterraneous ca∣verns

<HEAD>Of the Peaks of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>I endeavoured to explain, Vol. I. p. 247. how
the peaks of mountains had been deprived of the
vitrifiable sands with which they had been ori∣ginally
invested; and my explanation errs in
this circumstance only, that I attributed the first
formation of the rocks which form the nuclei
of these peaks to the intervention of water, in∣stead
of ascribing it to the action of fire. These
peaks or horns of mountains are nothing but
prolongations of the interior rock of the globe,
which were environed with great quantities of
scoriae and dust of glass. These loose materials
must have been carried down by the movement
of the sea, when it made its retreat. After∣wards,
the rains and torrents of water would
soon deprive the masses of pure rock of all their
coverings, and make them completely bare,
as they are at present. I may remark, in gene∣ral,
that no other change falls to be made in my
theory of the earth than the following fact,
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
that the first mountains derived their origin from
the primitive fire, and not from the intervention
of water, as I had conjectured; because I had
then been induced to believe, by the authority
of Woodward and some other naturalists, that
shells were found on the tops of all mountains.
But, from more recent observations, it appears,
that there are no shells on the highest summits,
nor above two thousand fathoms above the level
of the sea. Hence the waters have never sur∣mounted
those high summits, or at least have
remained but a short time upon them; so that
they have formed only the hills and the calcari∣ous
mountains, which never rise to the height
of two thousand fathoms.</P>

<HEAD>Additional Observations on the Theory of run∣ning
Waters.</HEAD>
<P>PAGE 266. Concerning the theory of running
waters, I have to add a new observation
which I made since I established mills, by
which the different celerities of water may be
pretty accurately ascertained. These mills are
composed of nine wheels, some of which are
impelled by a fall of water of two or three feet,
and others by a fall of five or six feet high: I
was at first surprised to find, that all the
wheels turned more quickly in the night than
in the day, and that the difference was great∣er
in proportion to the height and breadth
of the column of water. For example, if the
water falls six feet, the wheel will turn a
tenth, and sometimes a ninth quicker in the
night than in the day; and, if the fall is less
high, the difference of celerity will likewise be
less; but it is always so sensible as to be easily
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
recognised. I ascertained this fact by placing
white marks upon the wheels, and reckoning
the number of revolutions in equal times, both
during the day and the night; and I uniformly
found, by a great number of observations, that
the time when the wheels moved with the great∣est
celerity was the coldest hour of the night,
and that they moved slowest when the heat of
the day was greatest. In the same manner, I
afterwards found, that the celerity of all the
wheels is greater in winter than in summer.
These facts, which have escaped the observation
of philosophers, are of importance in practice.
The theory of them is extremely simple: This
augmentation of celerity depends solely on the
density of the water, which is increased by cold
and diminished by heat: And, as the same vo∣lume
of water only can pass by the trough, this
volume, which is denser in winter and during
the night, than in summer or in the day, acts
with more force on the wheel, and, of course,
communicates to it a greater quantity of motion.
Thus, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> there will be less loss of
water, if we stop the machines during the heat
of the day, and work them during the night. By
observing this method in my forges, its influ∣ence
in the process of making iron amounted to
one twelfth part.</P>
<P>Another observation merits attention: Of two
wheels, the one nearer the canal than the other,
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
but perfectly equal in every other respect, and
both moved by an equal quantity of water, the
wheel nearest the canal moves quicker than the
one more remote, and to which the water can∣not
arrive till after it has run over a certain
space in the particular runner that terminates in
this wheel. It is well known, that the friction
of water on the sides of a canal diminishes its
celerity. But this circumstance is not sufficient
to account for the considerable difference in the
motion of these two wheels. It is owing, in the
<HI>first</HI> place, to the water in this canal not being
pressed laterally, as it is when it enters by the
trough of the canal, and to its striking immediately
the ladles of the wheel. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This inequa∣lity
of motion, depending on the distance of the
wheels from the canal, is likewise owing to the
water, which passes through a trough, not being a
column of equal dimensions with the trough; for
the water, in its passage, forms an irregular cone,
which is depressed on the sides in proportion to
the breadth of the volume of water in the canal.
If the ladles of the wheel are very near the trough,
the water acts very near as high as the aperture
of the trough: But, if the wheel is more distant
from the canal, the water sinks in the runner, and
strikes not the ladles of the wheel at the same
height, nor with equal celerity, as in the first
case. The union of these two causes produces
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
that diminution of celerity in wheels which are
distant from the canal.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the saltness of the Sea, p. 275.</HEAD>
<P>ON this subject there are two opinions, and
both of them are partly true. Halley attributes
the saltness of the sea solely to the salts of the
earth carried down by the rivers; and even sup∣poses
that the antiquity of the world may be dis∣covered
by the degree of saltness in the waters
of the ocean. Leibnitz, on the contrary, be∣lieves,
that the globe having been liquified by
fire, the sals and other empyreumatic sub∣stances
produced with the aqueous vapours a salt
lixivium, and, consequently, that the sea received
its saltness from the beginning. The opinions
of these two great philosophers, though opposite,
should be united, and may even coincide with my
own. It is extremely probable, that, at the begin∣ning,
the action of fire combined with that of wa∣ter
dissolved all the saline substances on the surface
of the earth; and, of course, that the first de∣gree
of saltness in the sea proceeded from the
cause assigned by Leibnitz; but this prevents not
the second cause assigned by Halley from having
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
considerable influence upon the actual degree of
saltness in the sea, which must always augment,
because the rivers incessantly carry down great
quantities of fixed salts, which cannot be ab∣stracted
by evaporation. They remain, therefore,
mixed with the general mass of waters, which
are, in general, more salt in proportion to their
distance from the mouths of rivers, and where
the heat of the climate produces the greatest e∣vaporation.
That the second cause acts more
powerfully than perhaps the first, is proved by
this circumstance, that all lakes from which rivers
issue are not salt, but almost all those which re∣ceive
rivers and discharge none, are impregnated
with salt. The Caspian Sea, Lake Aral, the Dead
Sea, &amp;c. owe their saltness solely to the salts
transported thither by the rivers, and which can∣not
be carried off by evaporation.</P>

that it fell from a perpendicular height of 156
feet. I have since been informed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon by M. Fresnoye.</NOTE>, that there
is a cataract in Europe, which falls from a

height of 300 feet. It is that of <HI>Terni,</HI> a small
village on the road from Rome to Bologna. It
is formed by the river Velino, which derives
its source from the mountains of Abbruzzo. Af∣ter
passing by <HI>Riette,</HI> a village on the frontier
of the kingdom of Naples, it falls into the Lac
de Luco, which seems to be supplied by abun∣dant
sources; for the river runs out of it with
more force than it enters, and proceeds to the
foot of the mountain <HI>del Marmore,</HI> from which
it is precipitated by a fall of 300 feet. It is re∣ceived
by a kind of abyss, from which it escapes
with great tumultuousness. The celerity of its
fall breaks the water with such force against
the rocks and the bottom of the abyss, that a
humid vapour arises, in which many rainbows
of various sizes are formed by the rays of the
sun; and, when the south wind blows, and
drives this mist against the mountain, instead of
several small rainbows, the whole cascade is
crowned with a very lagre one.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Limits of the South Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THE South Sea is much broader than the
Atlantic, and appears to be bounded by
two chains of mountains, which correspond as
far as the Equator. The first chain is composed
of the mountains of California, of New Mexi∣co,
of the Isthmus of Panama, of the Cordeliers,
of Peru, of Chili, &amp;c. The other chain stretches
through Kamtschatka, Yesso, and Japan, and
extends as far as the Larron islands, and even the
New Philippines. The direction of these chains
of mountains, which appear to be the ancient
limits of the Pacific Ocean, is precisely from
north to south; so that the Old Continent was
bounded on the east by one of these chains
of mountains, and the New Continent by the
other. Their separation happened at the period
when the waters, proceeding from the south
pole, began to run between these two chains
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
of mountains, which seem to unite, or at least
to make a very near approach to each other to∣wards
the northern regions. This is not the on∣ly
indication of the ancient union of the two
continents on the north. This continuity of
the two continents between Kamtschatka and the
most western land of America, seems now to
be proved by the new discoveries of navigators,
who have found, under the same parallel of lati∣tude,
a great number of islands lying so near each
other, as to leave only small intervals of sea be∣tween
the east of Asia and the west of America
under the Polar Circle.</P>

<HEAD>Of double Currents in some parts of the Ocean,
Vol. I. p. 313.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD too generally and two positively assert∣ed,
that, in no part of the sea, a superior and in∣ferior
current are to be found.</P>
<P>I have since received information, which seems
to prove, that this effect actually exists, and can
even be demonstrated, in certain parts of the
sea. On this subject, M. Deslandes, an able na∣vigator,
obligingly communicated to me the
following accurate remarks, in two letters, the
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
one dated December 6. 1770, and the other No∣vember
5. 1773.</P>
<P>'In your <HI>Theory of the Earth,</HI> Art. XI. <HI>Of
Seas and Lakes,</HI> you say, that <HI>a double current
has been alledged to run through the straits of
Gibraltar; but that those who support this opi∣nion
have been deceived by the regorging of the
water near the shores, which often produces a
motion opposite to that of the principal current.</HI>'</P>
<P>'After reading this passage, I determined to
transmit you my observations on the subject.'</P>
<P>'Two months after my departure from
France, I reconnoitered the land between
Capes Gonsalvas and Saint Catharine. The
force of the currents, the direction of which is
to the north north-west, corresponding exactly
with the situation of the lands, obliged me to
cast anchor. The general winds of this region
blow from the south south-east, south south-west,
and south-west. I spent two months
and a half in making fruitless attempts to
change my situation, and to reach the coast of
Loango, where I had some business to transact.
During this time, I remarked, that the sea de∣scended
in the above direction from half a
league to a league in the hour, and that, at
certain depths, the currents ascended below
with the same rapidity as they descended a∣bove.'</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="88"/>
'I ascertained the depth of these opposite cur∣rents
in the following manner. Being moor∣ed
in eight fathoms water, and the sea ex∣tremely
clear, I fixed a lead of thirty pounds
weight to the end of a line. At about two fa∣thoms
from the lead, I tied a table napkin to
the line by one of its corners, and allowed the
lead to sink in the water. As soon as the table
napkin entered, it took the direction of the
first current. Continuing to observe it, I made
it descend. Whenever I perceived that the
current discontinued, I stopped. It then float∣ed
indifferently around the line. In this place,
therefore, the run was interrupted. I then
sunk the table napkin about a foot lower,
and it assumed an opposite direction. By
marking the line at the surface of the water,
I found that the table napkin was at the depth
of three fathoms; from which I concluded, af∣ter
different examinations, that, of eight fa∣thoms
water, three ran north north-west, and
five ran in the contrary direction of south
south-east.'</P>
<P>'The same day, I repeated the experiment
in fifty fathoms water, being then distant from
the land six or seven leagues. I was surprised
to find that the upper current was deeper in
proportion to the depth of the bottom. Of
fifty fathoms water, I reckoned that from
twelve to fifteen ran in the first direction. This
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
phaenomenon did not take place during the
whole two months and a half that I remained
on this coast, but nearly one month only, and
at different times; during these interruptions
the whole water ran into the gulf of Guiney.'</P>
<P>'This opposition of currents suggested the
idea of a machine, which, being sunk as
far as the inferior current, and presenting a
great surface, might force my vessel against
the superior current, I made the experiment
in miniature upon a boat; and I proceed∣ed
so far as to produce an equilibrium be∣tween
the force of the superior current, join∣ed
to that of the wind, upon the boat, and
the force of the inferior current upon the ma∣chine.
I had not an opportunity of making
trials on a larger scale. What I have related,
Sir, is a truth which may be confirmed by e∣very
navigator who has visited these climates.'</P>
<P>'I imagine that the winds, as well as the ri∣vers,
which discharge themselves into the sea
along this coast, and carry great quantities of
earth into the gulf of Guiney, are the princi∣pal
causes of these effects. Besides, the bottom
of this gulf, which, by its declivity, obliges the
tide to run retrograde whenever it arrives at a
certain level, and is incessantly pressed by fresh
quanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, while the wind acts in a contrary
direction upon the surface, and constrains part
of the water to observe its ordinary course.
This seems to be the more probable, because
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
the sea enters from all quarters into this gulf,
and issues only by revolutions which seldom
happen. The moon has no apparent effect;
for the same thing takes place during all its
phases.'</P>
<P>'I had occasion to be still farther convinced
that the pressure of the water, when it comes
to its level, joined to the inclination of the bot∣tom,
are the sole causes of this phaenomenon.
I found, that these currents exist only in pro∣portion
to the smaller or greater declivity of
the shores; and I have every reason to believe,
that they are not perceived beyond twelve or
fifteen leagues from land, which is the great∣est
distance along the coast of Angola, where
we can be certain of finding the bottom. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The following circumstances seem to prove,
that similar changes in the currents take place
in the open sea. I made one of my experi∣ments
at a mean depth, namely thirty-five fa∣thoms.
I found, at the depth of six or seven
fathoms, that the course of the water ran
north north-west. On sinking two or three
fathoms more, my line stretched to the west
north-west. At three or four fathoms deeper,
the course was west south-west, then south-west,
and south. Lastly, at twenty-five and
twenty-six fathoms, the course was south
south-east, and towards the bottom it was
south-east and east south-east. From these
experiments I drew the following conclusions:
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
That I might compare the ocean between A∣frica
and America to a great river, the course
of which is almost constantly directed to the
north-west; that, as it runs along, it carries
down sand and mud, which it deposits on its
banks. These banks are, of course, heighten∣ed,
and necessarily raise the level of the water,
and oblige it to run ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ograde in proportion
to the declivity of the shore. But, as the wa∣ter
is directed by a primitive impulse, it can∣not
return in a straight line: Obeying the o∣riginal
movement, and yielding reluctantly to
the last obstacle, it must necessarily describe a
curve of greater or smaller extent, till it meets
the middle current with which it may partly
unite, or which may serve it as a fulcrum, and
give it a direction contrary to that impressed
on it by the bottom. As the mass of water is
in perpetual motion, the water towards the
bottom, being nearer the cause and more pres∣sed,
must always undergo the first changes,
and run in a direction contrary to the superior
current, while the same cause reaches not dif∣ferent
heights. These, Sir, are my ideas.
I have frequently taken advantage of these in∣ferior
currents; by sinking a machine to dif∣ferent
depths, according to the number of fa∣thoms
water I happened to be in, I was en∣abled
to sail against the upper current. I
found, that, in calm water, and with a surface
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
three times larger than that part of the prow
which is below the water, we could run from
a third to half a league in the hour. Of this
fact I was ascertained by my latitude, by boats
which I anchored, and from which I found
myself at a great distance an hour afterward;
and, lastly, by the distance of certain points a∣long
the coasts.'</P>
<P>These observations of M. Deslandes seem to
be decisive, and I accede to them with pleasure.
I cannot sufficiently thank him for demonstra∣ting
not only that my ideas on this subject were,
in general, just, but that, in particular circum∣stances,
they were liable to exceptions. It is
not less certain, however, that the ocean forced
open the strait of Gibraltar, and, consequently,
that the Mediterranean sea received a great aug∣mentation
by this irruption. I rested this opi∣nion
not only on the current of the ocean into
the Mediterranean, but on the situation of the
land and the correspondence of the strata on the
opposite coasts, which has often been remarked
by intelligent navigators. 'The irruption which
formed the Mediterranean is evident, as well
as that of the Black Sea by the strait of the
Dardanelles, where the current is always vio∣lent,
and the correspondence of the angles of
the two coasts strongly marked, as well as the
similarity of the strata, which are precisely the
same on the opposite sides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part of a letter written to M. de Buffon in 1772.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="93"/>
Besides, the idea of M. Deslandes, who con∣siders
the sea between Africa and America as a
great river, the course of which is toward the
north-west, agrees perfectly with what I ad∣vanced
concerning the water's running in great∣er
quantity from the south than from the north
pole.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Northern Parts of the Atlantic Ocean.</HEAD>
<P>ON viewing the islands and gulfs, which are
very numerous round Greenland, it is difficult,
as navigators remark, not to suspect that the
sea falls back from the Poles towards the Equa∣tor.
What favours this conjecture, the tide ri∣ses
eighteen feet at Cape des Etats, and only
eight feet in the bay of Disko, <HI>i. e.</HI> at ten de∣grees
of higher latitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This observation, joined to that of the pre∣ceding
article, seems still farther to confirm the
movement of the waters of the ocean from the
southern to the northern regions, where they
are forced, by the resistance of the lands, to re∣gorge
or flow back toward the south.</P>
<P>In Hudson's bay, vessels have to preserve
themselves from mountains of ice, which are
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
said to be from fifteen to eighteen hundred feet
thick, and which, being formed by a succes∣sion
of long winters, in small gulfs perpetually
filled with snow, have been detached by the
north-west winds, or by some other powerful
cause.</P>
<P>The north-west wind, which prevails perpe∣tually
during winter, and often in summer,
excites, in the same bay, dreadful tempests.
These are still more to be apprehended, because
shoals are here very frequent. In the countries
which bound this bay, the sun never rises nor
sets without a great cone of light. When this
phaenomenon disappears, it is succeeded by the
aurora borealis. Here the heavens are seldom
serene. In spring and autumn the air is gene∣rally
replete with thick fogs; and, during win∣ter,
with an infinity of small threads of ice,
which are visible to the eye. Though the sum∣mer
heats are considerable during two months
or six weeks, thunder and lightning are rare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Philos. et politique, tom. 6. p. 308. 309.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sea along the coasts of Norway, which
are bordered with rocks, is commonly from a
hundred to four hundred fathoms deep, and the
water is less salt than in warmer climates. The
number of oily fishes with which this sea is sill∣ed,
renders it so fat that it is almost inflamma∣ble.
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
The tide is here inconsiderable, the high∣est
not rising above eight feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Nat. hist. of Norway; <HI>journal étranger, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 1755.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some observations have lately been made up∣on the
temperature of the land and water in
the climates adjacent to the north Pole.</P>
<P>'In Greenland, the cold begins with the new
year, and becomes so piercing in the months
of February and March, that the stones split,
and the sea smokes like a furnace, especially in
the bays. In the midst of this thick fog,
however, the frost is not so intense, as when
the sky is unclouded; for, when we pass from
the land to that foggy atmosphere which co∣vers
the surface and margins of the waters,
we feel a milder air, though our hair and
clothes are stiffened with hoar-frost. This fog
produces more chilblains than a dry cold; and,
when it passes from the sea to a colder atmos∣phere,
it instantly freezes, is dispersed through
the horizon by the wind, and produces a cold
so intense that no person can go into the open
air, without running the hazard of having his
hands and feet entirely frozen. It is in this
season, that we see the water freeze on the fire
before it boils. It is then that the winter
paves a road of ice between islands, and in the
bays and straits.'</P>
<P>'Autumn is the finest season in Greenland.
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
But its duration is short, and frequently inter∣rupted
by cold frosty nights. It is also about
this time, that, in an atmosphere darkened
with vapours, we see fogs which freeze and
form a tissue on the sea similar to cobwebs;
and, in the fields, the air is impregnated with lu∣cid
atoms, or sharp icicles like small needles.'</P>
<P>'It has often been remarked, that the seasons
in Greenland assume a temperature opposite to
that which prevails in the rest of Europe.
When the winter is rigorous in the temperate
climates, it is mild in Greenland, and very
severe in this northern region, when it is mo∣derate
in our countries. At the end of the
year 1739, he winter was so mild in the bay
of Disko, that the gueese, in the month of Ja∣nuary,
passed from the temperate to the fro∣zen
zone in quest of warmer air; and that, in
1740, no ice was seen at Disko in the month
of March; while, in Europe, the ice prevail∣ed,
without interruption, from October to
May. . . . .'</P>
<P>'In winter 1763, which was extremely cold
over all Europe, the cold was so little felt in
Greenland, that some summers have been less
mild<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 20. &amp;c.</NOTE>.''</P>
<P>We are assured by voyagers, that, in the seas
adjacent to Greenland, there are very high moun∣tains
of floating ice, and others which resemble
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
rafts of two hundred fathoms in length, by six∣ty
or eighty in breadth. But these boards of ice,
which form immense plains upon the sea, are
seldom above nine or twelve feet thick. They
seem to be formed immediately on the surface
when the cold is greatest. But the floating and
very high masses come from the land, <HI>i. e.</HI> from
the environs of mountains and coasts, from
which they have been detached and carried
down to the sea by the rivers. These masses of
ice bring along with them great quantities of
wood, which are afterwards thrown by the sea
upon the eastern coasts of Greenland. This
wood, it appears, neither comes from Labrador
nor Norway; because the north-east winds,
which are very violent in these countries, would
push back the trees, and the currents which run
to the south of Davis's strait, and Hudson's bay,
would stop all that might come from America
to the coasts of Greenland.</P>
<P>The sea begins to carry boards of ice to Spitz∣bergen
in the months of April and May. A
great number come from Davis's strait, part of
them from Nova Zembla, and the greatest num∣ber
from the east coast of Greenland, being
transported from east to west according to the
general movement of the ocean.</P>
<P>The following facts and notices are to be
found in the voyage of Captain Phipps. 'The
idea of a passage to the East Indies by the
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
North Pole was suggested as early as the year
1527, by Robert Thorne, merchant of Bris∣tol. . . . .'
No voyage, however, appears to
have been undertaken to explore the circumpo∣lar
seas, till the year 1607, when 'Henry Hud∣son
was set forth, at the charge of certain wor∣shipful
merchants of London, to discover a pas∣sage
by the North Pole to Japan and China.
. . And this I can assure at this present, that
between seventy-eight degrees and a half, and
eighty-two degrees, by this way there is no
passage.'</P>
<P>'In 1609, a voyage was set forth by the
Right Worshipful Sir Thomas Smith to the
south part of Spitzbergen; and, when near
Foreland, he sent his mate ashore; and speak∣ing
of the account he gave at his return, says,
Moreover, I was certified that all the ponds
and lakes were unfrozen, they being fresh wa∣ter;
which putteth me in hope of a mild sum∣mer
here, after so sharp a beginning as I have
had; and my opinion is such, and I assure
myself it is so, that a passage may be as soon
attained this way by the Pole, as any unknown
way whatsoever, by reason the sun doth give
a great heat in this climate, and the ice (I
mean that freezeth here) is nothing so huge as
I have seen in seventy-three degrees. . . .' Se∣veral
other voyagers have attempted to disco∣ver
this passage, but without success.'</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99"/>
On the fifth of July, Captain Phipps saw great
quantities of floating ice about the 79° 34′ of la∣titude.
The weather was foggy. The next
day he continued his course as far as the 79° 59′
39″ between Spitzbergen and the ice. On the
7th, he proceeded through the floating masses of
ice in quest of an open passage to the north
by which he might gain an open sea. But the ice
to the north-north-west formed one continued
mass; and at 80° 36′ the sea was entirely frozen;
so that all the attempts of Captain Phipps to
discover a passage proved abortive.' 'On the
12th of September, Dr Irvine tried the tem∣perature
of the sea in a state of great agitation,
and found it considerably warmer than that of
the atmosphere. This observation is the more
interesting, as it agrees with a passage in Plu∣tarch's
Natural Questions, not (I believe) before
taken notice of, or confirmed by experiment,
in which he remarks,' 'that the sea becomes
warmer by being agitated in waves. . . . These
gales are as common in the spring as in the au∣tumn;
there is every reason to suppose, there∣fore,
that at an early season we should have met
with the same bad weather in going out as we
did on our return.' And, as Captain Phipps de∣parted
from England in the end of May, he
certainly took the season most favourable to his
expedition. . . . 'There was also most probabili∣ty,
if ever navigation should be practicable to the
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
Pole, of finding the sea open to the northward
after the solstice; the sun having then exerted
the full influence of his rays, though there was
enough of the summer still remaining for the
purpose of exploring the seas to the northward
and westward of Spitzbergen.'</P>
<P>I agree entirely with this able navigator; and
I suspect that the expedition to the Pole cannot
be renewed with success, and that we can never
reach beyond the 82d or 83<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> degree. We are
assured that a vessel from Whitby, in the year
1774, penetrated as far as the 80th degree, with∣out
seeing ice sufficient to prevent sailing still
farther. A Captain Robinson is likewise quo∣ted,
from whose journal it appears that, in
1773, he arrived at the 81° 30′. Lastly, a
Dutch ship of war, sent to protect the whale∣fishers,
is said to have advanced, about fifty
years ago, as far as the 88th degree. Dr Camp∣bell,
it is added, received this intelligence from
a Dr <HI>Daillie,</HI> who was in the vessel, and prac∣tised
physic in London in the year 1745<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gazette de Literature, Août 9. 1774, No. 61.</NOTE>. This
is probably the same navigator whom I formerly
quoted under the name of Captain Mouton.
But I am extremely suspicious of the fact; and
I am persuaded, that we shall in vain at∣tempt
to reach beyond the 82d or 83d degree,
and that, if a passage by the north is practicable,
it can only be by the way of Hudson's bay.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101"/>
On this subject, the following passage of the
learned and ingenious author of the history of
the Two Indies merits attention, 'Hudson's bay
always has been, and is still looked upon as the
nearest road from Europe to the East Indies,
and to the richest parts of Asia.'</P>
<P>'Cabot was the first who entertained an idea
of a north-west passage to the South-seas; but
his discoveries ended at Newfoundland. After
him followed a crowd of English navigators,
many of whom had the honour of giving their
names to savage coasts which no mortal had e∣ver
visited before. These bold and memora∣ble
expeditions were more striking than really
useful. The most fortunate of them did not
furnish a single idea relative to the object of
pursuit. The Dutch, less frequent in their at∣tempts,
and who pursued them with less ar∣dour,
were of course not more successful, and
the whole began to be treated as a chimera,
when the discovery of Hudson's bay rekindled
all the hopes that were nearly extinguished.'</P>
<P>'From this time the attempts were renewed
with fresh ardour. Those that had been made
before in vain by the mother-country, whose
attention was engrossed by her own intestine
commotions, were pursued by New England,
whose situation was favourable to the enter∣prise.
Still, however, for some time there
were more voyages undertaken than discove∣ries
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
made. The nation was a long time kept
in suspense by the contradictory accounts recei∣ved
from the adventurers. While some main∣tained
the possibility, some the probability,
and others asserted the certainty of the passage;
the accounts they gave, instead of clearing up
the point, involved it in still greater darkness.
Indeed, these accounts are so full of obscurity
and confusion, they are silent upon so many
important circumstances, and they display such
visible marks of ignorance and want of vera∣city,
that, however impatient we may be of de∣termining
the question, it is impossible to build
any thing like a solid judgment upon testimo∣nies
so suspicious. At length, the famous
expedition of 1746 threw some kind of light
upon a point which had remained enveloped in
darkness for two centuries past. But upon
what grounds have the later navigators enter∣tained
better hopes? What are the experiments
on which they found their conjectures?'</P>
<P>'Let us proceed to give an account of their
arguments. There are three facts in natural
history, which henceforward must be taken
for granted. The first is, that the tides come
from the ocean, and that they extend more
or less into the other seas, in proportion as
their channels communicate with the great
reservoir by larger or smaller openings; from
whence it follows that this periodical motion
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
is scarcely perceptible in the Mediterranean, in
the Baltic, and other gulfs of the same nature.
A second matter of fact is, that the tides are
much later and much weaker in places more
remote from the ocean, than in those which
are nearer to it. The third fact is, that vio∣lent
winds, which blow in a direction with the
tides, make them rise above their ordinary
boundaries, and that those which blow in a
contrary direction retard their motion, at the
same time that they diminish their swell.'</P>
<P>'From these principles, it is most certain that,
if Hudson's bay were no more than a gulf in∣closed
between two continents, and had no
communication but with the Atlantic, the tides
in it would be very inconsiderable; they would
be weaker in proportion as they were further
removed from the source, and would be less
strong wherever they ran in a contrary direc∣tion
to the wind. But it is proved by obser∣vations
made with the greatest skill and preci∣sion,
that the tides are very high throughout
the whole bay. It is certain that they are
higher towards the bottom of the bay than e∣ven
in the strait itself, or at least in the neigh∣bourhood
of it. It is proved that even this
height increases whenever the wind blows from
a corner opposite to the strait; it is, there∣fore,
certain, that Hudson's bay has a com∣munication
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
with the ocean, beside that which
has been already found out.'</P>
<P>'Those who have endeavoured to explain
these very striking facts, by supposing a com∣munication
of Hudson's with Baffin's bay, or
with Davis's straits, are evidently mistaken.
They would not scruple to reject this opinion,
for which indeed there is no real foundation,
if they only considered that the tides are much
lower in Davis's straits, and in Baffin's bay,
than in Hudson's.'</P>
<P>'But if the tides in Hudson's bay can come
neither from the Atlantic ocean, nor from a∣ny
other northern sea, in which they are con∣stantly
much weaker, it follows that they must
have their origin in the South Sea. And this
is still further apparent from another leading
fact, which is, that the highest tides ever
observed upon these coasts, are always occa∣sioned
by the north-west winds, which blow
directly against the mouth of the strait.'</P>
<P>'Having thus determined, as much as the na∣ture
of the subject will permit, the existence
of this passage so long and so vainly wished-for,
the next point is to find out in what part of
the bay it is to be expected. From consider∣ing
every circumstance, we are induced to
think that the attempts, which have been hi∣therto
made without either choice or method,
ought to be directed towards Welcome bay, on
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
the western coast. First, the bottom of the sea
is to be seen there at the depth of about eleven
fathom, which is an evident sign that the wa∣ter
comes from some ocean, as such a transpa∣rency
could not exist in waters discharged from
rivers, or in melted snow or rain. Secondly,
the currents keep this place always free from
ice, while all the rest of the bay is covered
with it; and their violence cannot be account∣ed
for but by supposing them to come from
some western sea. Lastly, the whales, who
towards the latter end of autumn always go in
search of the warmest climates, are found in
great abundance in these parts towards the end
of summer, which would seem to indicate that
there is an outlet for them from thence to the
south seas, not to the northern ocean.'</P>
<P>'It is probable that the passage is very short.
All the rivers that empty themselves on the
western coast of Hudson's bay are small and
slow, which seems to prove that they do not
come from any distance; and that consequent∣ly
the lands which separate the two seas are of
a small extent. This argument is strengthened
by the height and regularity of the tides.
Wherever there is no other difference between
the times of the ebb and flow, but that which
is occasioned by the retarded progression of
the moon in her return to the meridian, it is
a certain sign that the ocean from whence
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
those tides come is very near. If the passage
is short, and not very far to the north, as e∣very
thing seems to promise, we may also pre∣sume
that it is not very difficult. The rapidi∣ty
of the currents observable in these latitudes;
which prevents any flakes of ice from continu∣ing
there, cannot but give some weight to this
conjecture.'</P>
<P>I believe, with this excellent writer, that if
a practicable passage exists, it must be at the
bottom of Hudson's bay, and that all attempts
by Baffin's bay will be fruitless, because the cli∣mate
is too cold, and its coasts are always fro∣zen,
especially towards the north. But the ex∣istence
of this passage is rendered still more
doubtful by the lands discovered, in 1741, by
Bering and Tchirikow, under the same latitude
with Hudson's bay; for these lands seem to
form a part of the great Continent of America,
which appears to stretch under the same lati∣tude
as far as the Polar circle. Of course, the
passage into the south sea can only be found
about the 55th degree of north latitude.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Salt Lakes of Asia.</HEAD>
<P>IN the country of the Usian Tartars, so cal∣led
because they inhabit the banks of the river
Uf, there are, M. Pallas remarks, lakes, the
waters of which were formerly fresh, and are
now salt. He makes the same remark concern∣ing
a lake near Miacs.</P>
<P>One of the lakes most famous for the quan∣tity
of salt extracted from it, is that near the
banks of the river Isel, called <HI>Soratschya.</HI> The
salt of it, in general, is bitter, and employed by
the physicians as a good purgative. Two oun∣ces
of this salt makes a very strong dose. Near
Kurtenegsch, the shoals are covered with a bit∣ter
salt, which rises, like a field of snow, to
the height of two inches. The lake Korjack of
furnishes annually three hundred thousand cu∣bic
feet of salt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cubic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weighs thirty-five pounds each of sixteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. Lake Jennu likewise furnish∣es
a great quantity.</P>
<P>In the voyages performed under the auspices
of the Academy of Petersburg, mention is made
of the salt lake of Jamuscha in Siberia. This
lake, which is nearly round, is only about nine
leagues in circumference. Its margins are co∣vered
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
with salt, and the bottom is clothed with
crystals of salt. The water is extremely salt;
and, when the sun shines, it appears reddish like
the sky in a sine morning. The salt is as white
as snow, and forms itself into cubic crystals.
The quantity of it is so immense, that a num∣ber
of vessels may, in a short time, be loaded
with it; and, after it has been removed, it is a∣gain
replaced in five or six days. It is suffi∣cient
to remark, that it supplies the provinces
of Tobolski and Jeniseik, and that this lake
could supply fifty provinces of similar extent.
The commerce of this, as well as of all other
salt, is reserved in the hands of the crown. This
salt is exceedingly good. It surpasses all others
in whiteness, and none is more proper for cu∣ring
meat. In the south of Asia, there are
likewise salt lakes, one near the Euphrates, and
another in the neighbourhood of Barra. There
are others, it is said, near Haleb, and at Larne∣ca
in the island of Cyprus. This last borders
upon the sea. The salt valley of Barra, being
at no great distance from the Euphrates, might
be worked, if its waters were made to run into
this river, and if the earth was good: But at
present this earth yields a good salt for the
kitchen, and even in such quantity that the
Bengal vessels, when returning in ballast, take
in loadings of this salt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. de l'Arabie, par M. Nicbuhr, p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

perusal of charts and soundings both ancient
and modern, the examination of such bodies

depth nearly equal to the length of our com∣mon
plumb lines, some reflections which are
most analogous to this subject arising from
physics, cosmography, and natural history,
have made me suspect, nay, have even convinced
me, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s M. l' Abbé Dicqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mare, 'that, in some
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
places, there must be two different bottoms,
the one often covering the other at intervals:
The ancient and permanent, which may be
called the general bottom, and the other acci∣dental
or particular. The first, which ought to
form the basis of a general picture, is the soil
of the basin that contains the sea. It is com∣posed
of the same strata which we every
where find in the bowels of the earth, such as
marl, stone, clay, sand, shells, all disposed ho∣rizontally,
and of an equal thickness through
a great extent. . . Here, we find a bottom
of marl, there a bottom of clay, sand, or rock.
Lastly, the number of general bottoms disco∣verable
by sounding exceeds not six or seven
species. The most extensive and thickest of
these strata, being uncovered, or cut perpendi∣cularly,
form great spaces in the sea, where
we ought to recognise the general bottom, in∣dependent
of such foreign substances as
may be deposited by currents or other causes.
There are other permanent bottoms which
we have not hitherto mentioned: These are
those immense masses of madrepores and
corals, which often cover a bottom of rock,
and those enormous and extended banks of
shells, which a rapid multiplication, or other
causes, have accumulated, and which occur in
different places, as it were in colonies. One
species occupies a certain extent; the succeed∣ing
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
space is occupied by another species, in
the same manner as has been remarked with
regard to fossil shells, in a great part of Europe,
and perhaps every where else. It is by ob∣servations
on the interior parts of earth,
and on such places as the sea leaves uncovered,
where we always see particular species reign∣ing
over certain districts, that we have been
enabled to form some idea of the prodigious
number of individuals, and of the thickness
of the banks at the bottom of the sea, of which
we can only know the surface by our sound∣ings.'</P>
<P>'The accidental or particular bottom is
composed of immense numbers of the pric∣kles
of the sea-archin; of fragments of shells,
sometimes corrupted; of crustaceous animals;
of madrepores; of sea plants; of pyrites; of
granites rounded by friction; of pieces of mo∣ther-of-pearl;
of mica; perhaps of talc, to
which different names are given according
to their appearances; of entire shells, but in
small quantity, and seemingly dispersed
through no great extent; of small flints, some
crystals, coloured sands, a light slime, &amp;c.
All these bodies, disseminated by the currents,
the agitation of the waters, and partly proceed∣ing
from the rivers, from the sinking of hills or
high beaches, and other accidental causes, sel∣dom
perfectly cover the general bottom, which
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
pears every instant, when we sound often in the
same regions. . . . I remarked, that, during
near a century, a great part of the general
bottoms of the gulf of Gascony and la Man∣cha,
have suffered little or no change, which

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Currents in the Ocean, Vol. I. p. 365.</HEAD>
<P>TO the enumeration of currents, we shall add
the famous current of Mosckoe, Mosche, or Male,
on the coast of Norway, of which a learned
Swede has given the following description.</P>
<P>'This current, which took its name from the
rock of Moschensicle, situated between the two
islands of Tofode and Woeroen, extends four
miles from north to south.'</P>
<P>'It is extremely rapid, especially between the
rock of Mosche and the point of Lofoede. But,
in proportion as it approaches the two isles of
Woeroen and Roest, its rapidity diminishes.
It finishes its course from north to south in six
hours, and from south to north in an equal
time.'</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115"/>
'This current is so rapid, that it produces a
number of small eddies, which the Norwegians
call <HI>gargamer.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Instead of following the course of the tides,
it observes an opposite direction. When the
waters of the ocean rise, they proceed from
south to north, but the current then runs from
north to south. When the sea retires, it goes
from north to south, but the current then runs
from south to north.'</P>
<P>'It is remarkable, that, both in going and re∣turning,
it does not describe a straight line, like
other currents found in some straits, where the
waters of the sea rise and fall; but it moves in
a circular direction.'</P>
<P>'When the waters of the sea have risen one
half, those of the current run to the south south-east.
In proportion as the sea rises, the current
turns towards the south; from thence it turns
toward the south-west, and from the south-west
to the west.'</P>
<P>'When the tide is full, the current goes to∣ward
the north-west, and then toward the
north. About the middle of the reflux, the
current recommences its course, after having
been suspended during some seconds.'</P>
<P>'The principal phaenomenon is its return by
the west from the south south-east toward the
north. If it did not come back by the same
road, it would be difficult and almost impossible
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
to sail from the point of Lofoede to the two
great islands of Woeroen and Rouest. There
are two parishes, which would necessarily be un∣inhabited,
if the current observed not the course
I have described. But, as it actually observes
this course, those who pass from the point of
Lofoede to the two islands, wait till the tide
has risen one half, because the direction of the
current is then to the west. When they want
to return from these islands to the point of
Lofoede, they wait till the tide be half ebb;
because the course of the current is then toward
the Continent. This circumstance renders the
passage very easy. . . Now, there is no current
without a declivity; and here the water rises
on one side and descends by the other. . . . . .'</P>
<P>'To be convinced of this truth, we have only
to consider that there is a small tongue of land
in Norway which extends sixteen miles into
the sea, from the point of Lofoede, which in∣clines
more to the west, as far as that of Lod∣dinge,
which inclines more to the east. This
tongue of land is surrounded by the sea; and,
whether during the flux or reflux, the water
is always stopt there; because it can have no
issue but through six small straits or passages
which divide the tongue of land into an equal
number of portions. Some of these exceed not
half a quarter of a mile in breadth, and some∣times
not half so much. Hence they can con∣tain
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
only a small quantity of water. Of course,
when the sea rises, a great part of the water
coming to the north is stopt to the south of
this tongue of land. The waters are, therefore,
much more elevated toward the south than to∣ward
the north. When the sea retires, and
goes toward the south, a great part of the wa∣ter,
in the same manner, is arrested to the
north of this tongue of land, and, consequently,
is much higher towards the north than towards
the south.'</P>
<P>'The waters thus interrupted sometimes, at
the north and sometimes at the south, can find
an issue only between the point of Lofoede
and the island of Woeroen, and between this
island and that of Rouest.'</P>
<P>'The declivity of the waters, when they de∣scend,
produces the rapidity of the current;
and, for the same reason, this rapidity is greatest
toward the point of Lofoede. As this point is
nearest the place where the waters are stopt,
the rapidity there is likewise greatest; and, in
proportion as the waters of the current extend
toward the islands of Woeroen and Rouest,
their celerity decreases.'</P>
<P>'It is now easy to conceive why the current
is always diametrically opposite to the motion
of the sea. Nothing opposes the common move∣ments
of the waters, whether they rise or fall.
But the waters which are stopt above the point
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
of Lofoede can neither move in a straight
line, nor beyond this point, while the sea has
not descended lower, and has not, in retiring,
carried off the waters, which those that are
stopt above the point of Lofoede ought to re∣place. . . . .'</P>
<P>'At the commencement of the flux and reflux,
the waters of the sea cannot turn back those of
the current; but, when they have risen or
fallen one half, they are then enabled to
change the direction of the current. As it can∣not
then turn toward the east, because the water
is always stable near the point of Lofoede, as
formerly remarked, it must necessarily proceed
toward the west, where the water is lower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. du courant de Mosckoe, &amp;c. <HI>Journal étranger. Fevrier</HI> 1758, <HI>p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>.'
This explication seems to be comformable to the
true principles of the theory of running waters.</P>
<P>We must still add the description of the famous
current of Scylla and Charybdis, near the island
of Sicily concerning which Mr Brydone has late∣ly
made some observations tending to prove that
the violence and rapidity of its movements are
much diminished.</P>
<P>'It was almost a dead calm, our ship scarce
moving half a mile in an hour, so that we had
time to get a complete view of the famous rock
of Scylla, on the Calabrian side, Cape Pylorus
on the Sicilian, and the celebrated Straits of
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
the Faro that runs between them. Whilst we
were still some miles distant from the entry of
the Straits, we heard the roaring of the current,
like the noise of some large impetuous river
confined between narrow banks. This in∣creased
in proportion as we advanced, till we
saw the water in many places raised to a consi∣derable
height, and forming large eddies or
whirlpools. The sea in every other place was
as smooth as glass. Our old pilot told us, that
he had often seen ships caught in these eddies,
and whirled about with great rapidity, without
obeying the helm in the smallest degree.
When the weather is calm, there is little danger;
but when the waves meet with this violent
current, it makes a dreadful sea. He says,
there were five ships wrecked in this spot last
winter. We observed that the current set ex∣actly
for the rock of Scylla, and would infal∣libly
have carried any thing thrown into it a∣gainst
that point; so that it was not without
reason the ancients have painted it as an object
of such terror. It is about a mile from the
entry of the Faro, and forms a small promon∣tory,
which runs a little out to sea, and meets
the whole force of the waters, as they come
out of the narrowest part of the Straits. The
head of this promontory is the famous Scylla.
It must be owned that it does not altogether
come up to the formidable description that
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
Homer gives of it; the reading of which (like
that of Shakespear's Cliff) almost makes one's
head giddy. Neither is the passage so wonder∣ous
narrow and difficult as he makes it. In∣deed
it is probable that the breadth of it is great∣ly
increased since his time, by the violent im∣petuosity
of the current. And this violence, too,
must have always diminished, in proportion as
the breadth of the channel increased. The
rock is near 200 feet high. There is a kind of
castle or fort built on its summit; and the
town of Scylla, or Sciglio, containing three or
four hundred inhabitants, stands on its south
side, and gives the title of prince to a Calabrese
family. We lay just opposite to Cape Pylorus
where the light-house is now built. . . . . The
mouth of the Straits, betwixt the promontories
of Pylorus in Sicily, and the Coda de Volpe in
Calabria, appears scarcely to be a mile. But
the channel enlarges to four miles in breadth
near Messina, which is twelve miles from the
mouth of the Straits. . . The celebrated gulf
or whirlpool of Charybdis lies near to the en∣try
of the harbour of Messina, and often occa∣sions
such an intestine and irregular motion in
the water, that the helm loses most of its power,
and ships have great difficulty to get in, even
with the fairest wind that can blow. . . . Ari∣stotle
gives a long and formidable description
of it in his 125th chapter, De Admirandis,
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
which I find translated in an old Sicilian book
I have got here. It begins, 'Adeo profun∣dum,
horridumque spectaculum,' &amp;c. but it is
too long to transcribe. It is likewise described
by Homer, 12th of the Odyssey; Virgil, 3d
Aeneid; Lucretius, Ovid, Sallust, Seneca, as
also by many of the old Italian and Sicilian
poets, who all speak of it in terms of horror;
and represent it as an object that inspired terror,
even when looked on at a distance. It certain∣ly
is not now so formidable; and very proba∣bly,
the violence of this motion, continued for
so many ages, has by degrees worn smooth the
rugged rocks, and jutting shelves, that may
have intercepted and confined the waters. The
breadth of the Straits too, in this place, I make
no doubt is considerably enlarged. Indeed,
from the nature of things it must be so; the
perpetual friction occasioned by the current
must wear away the bank on each side, and
enlarge the bed of the water.'</P>
<P>'The vessels in this passage were obliged to
go as near as possible to the coast of Calabria,
in order to avoid the suction occasioned by the
whirling of the waters in this vortex; by
which means, when they came to the narrowest
and most rapid part of the Straits, betwixt
Cape Pylorus and Scylla, they were in great
danger of being carried upon that rock. From
whence the proverb, still applied to those who,
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
in attempting to avoid one evil, fall into an∣other,
'Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Carybdim.'
Here another light-house is placed to warn
sailors of their approach to Charybdis, as that
other on Cape Pylorus is intended to give them
notice of Scylla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brydone's Tour, vol. 1. p. 40. &amp;c.</NOTE>.'</P>

<HEAD>Of Reflected Wind, p. 379.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall here mention a fact which seems to
ve escaped the observation of natural
philosophers, though every man is in a condi∣tion
to convince himself of its truth. The fact is
that the reflected wind is more violent than the
direct, and still more so in proportion to the
nearness of the obstacle by which it is reflected.
I have often made the experiment by approach∣ing
a tower, of near a hundred feet high, and
situated at the north of my garden at Montbard.
When a strong south wind blows, we are vi∣olently
pushed back, at the distance of thirty
paces: After which, there is an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interval for
five or six paces, where the violence of the re∣flected
wind ceases, and seems to be in equilibri∣um
with the direct. The nearer we approach,
the strength of the reflected wind augments,
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
and pushes us back with much greater force
than the direct wind pushes us forward. The
cause of this general effect, which may be per∣ceived
opposite to any high buildings, preci∣pices,
&amp;c. it is not difficult to discover. The
air in the direct wind acts only by its celerity
and its common volume; but this volume or
mass is considerably augmented by the compres∣sion
it receives from the obstacle by which it is
reflected; and, as the quantity of every mo∣tion
consists of the celerity multiplied by the
volume, this quantity is much greater after be∣ing
compressed than before. It is a volume of
common air which acts in the first case, and
a volume of air of double or triple the density
which acts in the second.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the state of the Air at the top of high Moun∣tains.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been proved by a thousand experi∣ments,
that the higher we rise above the level
of the sea or of plains, the column of mercury in
the barometer sinks the lower; and, consequent∣ly,
that the weight of a column of air diminish∣es
in proportion to the elevation of the place;
and as air is an elastic and compressible fluid,
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
philosophers have unanimously concluded from
these experiments, that the air is much more
dense and compressed in the plains, than on
the tops of mountains. For example, if the
barometer, which stands at 27 inches in the
plain, falls, on the top of a mountain, to 18, a
difference of one third of the whole weight of
the column of air, we say, that, the compression
of this element being always proportioned to
the incumbent weight, the air at the top of the
mountain is, of course, one third less dense
than that in the plain, because it is compressed
by a weight one third less. But strong reasons
concur in making me suspect the truth of this
conclusion, which has hitherto been regarded as
natural, and perfectly legitimate.</P>
<P>Let us, for a moment, abstract this compressi∣bility
of the air, which several causes may aug∣ment
or diminish, destroy or compensate: Let
us suppose the air to be every where equally
dense; if its thickness exceeded not three
leagues, it is certain, that, in mounting one
league, the barometer, being loaded with one
third less weight, would descend from 27 to 18
inches. Now the air though compressible, ap∣pears
to me to be equally dense at all heights;
and this opinion I shall support by the following
facts and reasonings.</P>
<P>1. The winds are equally strong, and equal∣ly
violent at the tops of the highest mountains
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
as in the lowest valleys. With regard to this
fact all observers are agreed. Now, if the den∣sity
of the air were one third less, the action of
the wind would necessarily be one third weaker,
and all the winds at the height of a league
would be only zephirs, which is absolutely
contradicted by uniform experience.</P>
<P>2. Eagles, and several other birds, not only
fly to the tops of the highest mountains, but rise
to great heights above them. Now, I ask if
these animals could either fly, or even support
themselves, in a fluid one third less dense than
common air, and if the weight of their bodies,
notwithstanding all their efforts, would not o∣blige
them to sink lower?</P>
<P>3. All observers, who have climbed to the
tops of the highest mountains, agree that they
respire as freely as in any other situation, and
that the only inconveniency they feel arises
from the cold, which augments in proportion
to the elevation. Now, if the air was one
third less dense at the tops of mountains, the
respiration of man, and of birds which mount
still higher, would not only be injured, but
stopped, as actually happens to animals in an
air pump when one fourth or one third of the
air contained in the receiver is exhausted.</P>
<P>4. As cold condenses as much as heat rare∣sies
the air, and as, in proportion to the eleva∣tion
of mountains, the cold increases, does it
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
not follow, that the degrees of condensation
of the air correspond to the degrees of cold?
This condensation may equal, and even surpass
that of the air in plains, where the heat e∣scaping
from the internal parts of the earth is
much greater than at the tops of mountains,
which are the most advanced and coldest points
on the surface of the globe. Hence this con∣densation
of the air by cold, in high regions of
the atmosphere, should compensate the diminu∣tion
of density produced by a decrease of the in∣cumbent
weight; and, of course, the air should
be equally dense on the cold summits of moun∣tains
as in the plains. I am even led to think,
that the air is more dense on the tops of moun∣tains,
because there the winds seem to be more
violent, and the birds which soar above the
highest summits appear to support themselves
in the air with more ease in proportion to the
height they rise.</P>
<P>I may, therefore, conclude, that the free air
is nearly of equal density at all heights, and
that the atmosphere extends not so high as has
been determined, by considering the air as an e∣lastic
mass compressed by an incumbent weight.
Thus the total thickness of the atmosphere may
not exceed three leagues, instead of from fif∣teen
to twenty, as has been conjectured by
philosophers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Alhazen, from the duration of the twilights, pretended that the height of the atmosphere is 44331 fathoms. Kepler, upon the same principle, makes it 41110 fathoms.</P>
<P>M. de la Hire, when treating of the horizontal refraction of 32 minutes, fixes the mean height of the atmosphere at 34585 fathoms.</P>
<P>M. Mariotte, from his experiments on the compressibility of air, makes the height of the atmosphere 30000 fathoms.</P>
<P>However, comprehending under the atmosphere that part of the air only in which refractions take place, M. Bouguer ascertains the height not to be above 5158 fathoms, i. e. two and a half or three leagues; and I believe that this result is more certain and better founded than any of the others.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="128"/>
The first stratum of the atmosphere is filled
with vapours exhaled from the surface of the
globe, both by its own heat and that of the sun.
In this stratum, which extends to the height
of the clouds, the heat arising from exhalations
produces and supports a rarefaction that forms
an equipoise to the superior air; so that the
lower stratum of the atmosphere is not so dense
as it ought to be in proportion to the pressure
it receives. But, at the height where this
rarefaction ceases, the air undergoes all that
condensation which is produced by the cold of
this region, where the heat arising from the
earth is much diminished; and this condensa∣tion
appears to be even greater than that which
might be produced, by the weight of the su∣perior
strata, in the inferior regions, which
are supported by rarefaction. This idea is
strengthened by another phaenomenon, which
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
is the condensation and suspensation of the
clouds in that elevated region where they are
formed and supported. Beyond this middle
region, where the cold and condensation com∣mence,
the vapours rise, but cease to be visible,
except when a part of a cold stratum seems to
be pushed back toward the surface of the
earth, and when the heat escaping from the
earth being for some time extinguished by
rains, the vapours then collect and thicken a∣round
us in the form of mists and fogs. With∣out
these circumstances, the vapours never be∣come
visible till they arrive at that region
where the cold condenses them into clouds,
and stops their further ascension: Their gravi∣ty,
which augments in proportion as they be∣come
more dense, fixes them in an equipoise
which they cannot surmount. We perceive that
the clouds are generally higher in summer, and
still higher in warm climates. It is in this season
and in these climates that the stratum formed by
evaporation from the earth rises highest. On the
contrary, in the frozen regions near the pole,
where the evaporation produced by the heat
of the globe is much less, the stratum of dense
air seems to touch the surface, and there to re∣tain
the clouds, which never rise higher, but
surround these gloomy regions with perpetual
fogs.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of some Winds which have a regular variation.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain climates and particular
countries where the winds vary regularly; some
at the end of six months, others in a few weeks,
others from morning to night, and from night to
morning. In Vol. I. p. 388. I remarked, That,
<HI>at St Domingo, there are two different winds
which rise regularly every day; the one, which
is from the sea, comes from the east, and begins at</HI>
10 <HI>o'clock before noon; the other, which is a land∣wind,
rises at</HI> 6 <HI>or</HI> 7 <HI>in the evening, and continues
the whole night.</HI> M. Fresnaye writes me, that
my information has not been exact. 'The two
regular winds,' he remarks, 'which blow at
St Domingo, are both from the sea, and blow,
the one in the morning from the east, and the
other in the evening from the west, which is
only the same wind returned. It is evidently
occasioned by the sun; for, every man perceives
that, between one and two o'clock after noon,
a transient gust arises. When the sun de∣clines,
by rarefying the air on the west, it drives
to the east the clouds which the morning wind
had confined toward the opposite quarter.
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
These returned clouds, from April or May till
toward autumn, produce in the district of Port∣au-Prince
the regular rains which constantly
proceed from the east. There is not a single
inhabitant who does not predict the evening
rain between six and nine o'clock, when, accor∣ding
to their mode of expression, <HI>the broken
cloud has been sent back.</HI> The west wind con∣tinues
not during the whole night. It falls
regularly toward the evening; and, when it
ceases, the clouds pushed from the east are en∣abled
to fall in the form of rain, as soon as their
weight exceeds that of an equal column of air.
The wind which prevails in the night is a land∣wind,
which proceeds neither from the east
nor the west, but follows the projections of
the coast. At Port-au-Prince, the south wind,
because it traverses the course of the river, is
intolerably cold during the months of January
and February<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon by M. Fresnaye, one of the counsellors of St Domingo, dated March 10. 1777</NOTE>.'</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Lavanges, or great masses of Snow and Ice
rolling down from high mountains.</HEAD>
<P>IN high mountains, there are winds produced
by accidental causes, and particularly by <HI>lavan∣ges</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know no single English word expressive of this idea, and therefore retain the French term.</NOTE>.
In the environs of the Alpine glacieres,
several species of <HI>lavanges</HI> are distinguishable;
some of them are called <HI>windy lavanges,</HI> because
they produce a great wind. They are formed
when a new fall of snow has been put in motion,
either from melting below by the interior heat
of the earth, or by the agitation of the air. The
snow then forms itself into balls, and in rolling
accumulates, falls in vast masses into the valleys,
and produces a great agitation in the air;
because the snow runs with rapidity, and in
immense volumes, and the winds occasioned by
the motion of these masses are so impetuous, that
they overturn every thing, even the largest pines,
that oppose their passage. These lavanges
cover the whole territory over which they extend
with a very fine snow; and this powdered snow
rises in the air at the caprice of the winds, <HI>i. e.</HI>
without any fixed direction, which is extremely
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
dangerous to people in the fields; because they
know not to what side to run in order to protect
themselves; for, in a few seconds, they find
themselves surrounded, and often completely
buried with the snow.</P>
<P>Another species of <HI>lavanges,</HI> still more dange∣rous
than the first, is called by the country peo∣ple
Schlaglawen, <HI>i. e. dashing</HI> or <HI>striking lavan∣ges.</HI>
They proceed not with such rapidity as
the first kind; but they overturn every thing
in their way, and carry along with them great
quantities of earth, stones, flints, and even en∣tire
trees; so that their passage from the moun∣tain
to the valley is a vast track of destruction
and ruin. As they proceed with less rapidity
than the <HI>lavanges</HI> composed of pure snow, they
are more easily avoided. Their approach is an∣nounced
at a distance; for they shake the
mountains and the valleys by their motion and
weight, and produce a noise equal to that of
thunder.</P>
<P>These tremendous effects may proceed from
very slight causes: A small quantity of snow
falling from a tree or a rock, the sound of bells,
or the shock of a cannon or musket, provided
they detach some portions of snow from the
summit, which form into balls, and increase in
magnitude as they descend, will accumulate in∣to
a mass as large as a small mountain before
they arrive at the valley.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134"/>
The inhabitants of countries subject to <HI>lavan∣ges</HI>
have invented several precautions to prevent
their destructive effects. They place their build∣ings
opposite to small eminences, which may
break the force of the <HI>lavanges.</HI> They likewise
make plantations of wood before their habita∣tions.
At Mount St Godard, there is a forest
in a triangular form, the acute angle of which
is directed towards the mountain, and seems to
have been planted with a view to turn off the
<HI>lavanges</HI> from the village of Urseren and the
buildings situated at the foot of the mountain;
and every person is forbid, under the severest
penalties, to injure the forest, which may be re∣garded
as the safeguard of the village. With
the same intention there are, in many places,
walls erected with their acute angles turned to∣ward
the mountain. A wall of this kind may
be seen at Davis, in the country of the Grisons,
as also near the baths of Leuk or Louache in Va∣lais.
In the same country of the Grisons, and o∣ther
places, there are, in the passages through
the mountains, vaults at convenient distances,
cut out of the rock on the side of the high-way,
which serve passengers as places of refuge a∣gainst
the lavanges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. Helvetique, par Scheuchzer, tom. 1. p. 155.</NOTE>.</P>

assure us, that, when they go out to secure
their boats, they are obliged to creep on their

bellies, lest they should become the sport of the
winds. The most violent tempests come from
the south, turn to the north, and then terminate
in a calm. It is on these occasions that the ice
in the bays is raised from its bed, and dispersed
in small portions over the ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Water-Spouts.</HEAD>
<P>M. de la Nux, whom I have often quoted,
and who lived forty years in the isle of Bour∣bon,
has had an opportunity of seeing a great
number of water-spouts, and he has commu∣nicated
to me his observations, of which the
following is an abridgement.</P>
<P>The water-spouts observed by M. de la Nux
were formed, 1. In calm days, and in those in∣tervals
when the wind passes from the south to
the north; though he saw one, which was form∣ed
previous to this passage of the wind from one
quarter to another, and even in the current of a
north wind, <HI>i e.</HI> a pretty long time before this
wind had ceased: The cloud from which this
water-spout depended, and to which it was at∣tached,
was still violently driven to the south.
The sun, at the same time, was seen behind the
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
cloud to the south. It happened on the 6th day
of January, about eleven o'clock before noon.</P>
<P>2. These water-spouts are formed during the
day in detached clouds, apparently very thick,
much longer than broad, and well defined be∣low
in the direction of the horizon: The under
part of these clouds is always very black.</P>
<P>3. All these water-spouts at first appear under
the form of inverted cones, whose bases are
more or less extensive.</P>
<P>4. Several of those water-spouts that appear
under the figure of inverted cones, are some∣times
attached to the same cloud; some are
never entirely completed; some are dissipa∣ted
at a small distance from the cloud; and o∣thers
descend apparently very near to the surface
of the sea, under the form of a long flat cone,
which is narrow and pointed at the bottom. In
the centre of this cone, and through its whole
length, there is a whitish transparent canal, a∣bout
one third of the diameter of the cone, the
two sides of which were very black, especially
on their first appearance.</P>
<P>These water-spouts were observed from a
point in the isle of Bourbon elevated 150 fa∣thoms
above the level of the sea, and they were
generally three, four, or five leagues from the
place of observation, which was the house of
M. de la Nux.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138"/>
The following is a more particular description
of these water-spouts.</P>
<P>When the end of the shaft, or top of the
cone, which is then very sharp pointed, has de∣scended
about a fourth of the distance of the
cloud from the sea, we begin to perceive on its
surface, which is commonly calm and of a trans∣parent
whiteness, a small black circle, which is
produced by the agitation and whirling of the
water: In proportion as the point of this shaft
descends, the water boils; this boiling increases
in proportion as the point approaches toward
the surface, and the water of the sea rises in suc∣cessive
whirlings to a greater or smaller height,
which, in the largest water spouts, is about
twenty-feet. The end of the shaft is always a∣bove
this whirling, the size of which is propor∣tioned
to that of the water-spout which puts it
in motion. The end of the shaft seems not to
touch the surface of the sea, otherwise than by
joining itself to the boiling or whirling which
rises to meet it.</P>
<P>We sometimes see larger and smaller cones of
water-spouts proceeding from the same cloud;
some of them have the appearance of threads,
and others are much larger. We often see ten
or a dozen of small but complete water-spouts
issuing from the same cloud, most of which are
dissipated near their exit, and visibly ascend to
the cloud. In this last case, the shaft suddenly
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
swells as far as the inferior extremity, and ap∣pears
like a cylinder suspended from the cloud,
torn in pieces below, and of a small extent.</P>
<P>The water-spouts with broad bases gradually
enlarge through their whole extent, and like∣wise
in the under end, which seems to recede
from the sea and to approach the cloud. The
agitation and whirling they produce in the wa∣ter
gradually diminishes, and the under part of
the shaft soon enlarges and assumes nearly a cy∣lindrical
form. It is in this state that the two
sides of the canal widen; and we then see the
water rushing with rapidity, and in a spiral
form, into the cloud. Lastly, the appearance
of the water-spout terminates by the successive
shortening of this species of cylinder.</P>
<P>The largest water-spouts remain longest with∣out
dissipating; and some of them continue more
than half an hour.</P>
<P>A torrent of rain generally rushes out of the
samé part of the cloud from which the water∣spouts
issue, and some of them not unfrequent∣ly
still adhere to the cloud; these torrents of
rain often conceal water-spouts before they are
dissipated. I perceived distinctly, M. de la Nux
remarks, on the 26th of October 1755, a wa∣ter-spout
in the middle of one of these torrents,
which became so great that it was soon conceal∣ed
from my view.</P>
<P>The wind, or the agitation of the air below
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
the cloud, breaks neither the large nor the small
water-spouts; for this impulsion only declines
them from the perpendicular. The smallest
kinds form very remarkable curves, and even si∣nuosities.
The extremity which terminates in
the sea is often far removed from the direction
of the other which is attached to the cloud.</P>
<P>We never see new water-spouts formed after
rain has fallen from the clouds which produced
them.</P>
<P>'On the 14th day of June 1756, about four
o'clock afternoon, I was,' says M. de la Nux,
'on the margin of the sea, and above its level
twenty or twenty-five feet. I saw twelve or
fourteen water-spouts issue from the same
cloud. Three of them only were considerable,
and particularly the last. The canal in the
middle of the cylinder was so transparent, that,
as the sun shone, I saw the clouds behind it.
The cloud which produced so many water∣spouts
extended nearly from south-east to
south-west; and the large water-spout under
consideration appeared in the south-south-west
from my station. The sun was very low; for
the days were then about the shortest. I saw no
rain proceed from the cloud: Its height seem∣ed
to be from five to six hundred fathoms.'</P>
<P>The more the sky is obscured with clouds,
water-spouts, and the phaenomena which ac∣company
them, are the more easily observed.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="141"/>
M. de la Nux thinks, and perhaps with rea∣son,
that water-spouts are nothing but viscous
portions of a cloud driven off by different whirl∣winds,
<HI>i. e.</HI> by the whirlings of the superior air
sinking into the mass of vapours of which the
whole cloud is composed.</P>
<P>What seems to prove that these water-spouts
are composed of viscous parts, is the tenacious∣ness
of their cohesion; for they make inflexions
and curvatures in every direction, without
breaking: If the matter of water-spouts was not
viscous, how can we conceive that they should,
without breaking, bend and obey the motion of
the winds? If all the parts did not firmly ad∣here,
the wind would dissipate them, or, at
least, make them change their form. But, as
the form, both of the large and small water∣spouts,
is uniformly the same, this is almost a
certain indication of the viscous tenacity of the
matter of which they are composed.</P>
<P>Thus the basis of the matter of water-spouts
is a viscous substance contained in the clouds,
and every water-spout is formed by a whirlwind
of air pressing through the mass of vapours, and,
by blowing up the inferior part of the cloud,
pierces it, and descends with its covering of vis∣cous
matter. And, as complete water-spouts
descend from the cloud to the surface of the sea,
the water must boil and whirl at the place to
which the end of the water-spout is directed;
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
because the air blows from the extremity of the
water-spout like the tube of a pair of bellows.
The effects of this blowing upon the sea will
augment, in proportion as the cylinder approach∣es
the surface of the water; and, when the o∣rifice
of the tube enlarges, a greater quantity of
air is permitted to escape, and the agitation of
the water is, of course, increased.</P>
<P>It has been imagined, that water-spouts car∣ried
off and contained great quantities of sea∣water:
The rains, or rather the spray, which
often fall in the neighbourhood of water-spouts,
have strengthened this prejudice. The canal
in the middle of every species of water-spout is
always transparent, on whatever side it is view∣ed.
If the water of the sea seems to rise, it is
not in this canal, but only on its sides. Almost
every water-spout suffers inflections, and often
in opposite directions, in the form of an <HI>S,</HI> the
one end of which is in the cloud, and the other
in the sea. Hence these water-spouts of which
we have been treating, cannot contain water
either to be poured into the sea, or raised to the
cloud. Of course, they can be attended with
no danger, except what proceeds from the im∣petuosity
of the air which escapes from their in∣ferior
orifice; for we are assured by every per∣son
who has had an opportunity of observing
these water-spouts, that they are solely compo∣sed
of air confined in a viscous cloud, and de∣termined
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
by its whirling to the surface of the
sea.</P>
<P>M. de la Nux has seen water spouts around
the isle of Bourbon in the months of January,
May, June, and October, <HI>i. e.</HI> in all seasons of
the year. He has seen them in calm weather, and
during the highest winds. These phaenomena,
however, may be said to be rare, and seldom
appear but upon the sea; because the viscosity
of the clouds can only proceed from the bitumi∣nous
and greasy particles raised, by the heat of
the sun and the winds, from the waters of the
sea, and collected in the clouds near its surface.
It is for this reason that water-spouts seldom ap∣per
on land, where there is not, as on the sur∣face
of the sea, a sufficient quantity of bitumi∣nous
and oily particles to be exhaled by the ac∣tion
of the sun. They are sometimes, however,
observed on land, and even at great distances
from the sea; this effect may be produced, when
viscous clouds have been rapidly driven by a
violent wind from the sea toward the land. M.
Grignon, in the month of June 1768, saw a
well formed water-spout in Lorrain near Vau∣villier,
among the hills which are a continuation
of the Vosges. It was about fifty fathoms high.
Its form was that of a column, and it commu∣nicated
with a large thick cloud. It was impell∣ed
by one or several winds, which made the wa∣ter-spout
turn rapidly; and it produced lightning
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
and thunder. This water-spout continued seven
or eight minutes only, and broke upon the base
of the hill, which is from five to six hundred
feet high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Grignon to M. de Buffon, Aug. 6. 1777.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Water-spouts have been mentioned by several
voyagers; but no man has examined them with
such accuracy as M. de la Nux. For example,
these voyagers tell us, that, when water-spouts
are forming, a black smoke rises on the surface of
the sea: This appearance, we are certain, is de∣ceitful,
and proceeds solely from the situation
of the observer. If he is placed on a situation so
elevated that the distance of the whirling exci∣ted
in the water by the spout, exceeds not his
sensible horizon, he will see nothing but the
water rising and falling back in rains, without
any mixture of smoke. This fact is apparent
when the sun shines on the place where the
phaenomenon happens.</P>
<P>These water-spouts have nothing in common
with those agitations and smoke sometimes pro∣duced
by submarine fires, and of which we have
formerly treated. Water-spouts neither contain
nor excite any smoke. They are every where
rare: They are most frequent in the seas of warm
climates, and where, at the same time, calms
are common, and the winds are most inconstant.
They are likewise more frequent, perhaps, near
islands and coasts than in the open sea.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>EARTHQUAKES are produced by two
causes: The first is the sudden sinking
of cavities in the bowels of the earth; and the
second, which is still more frequent and more
violent than the first, is the action of subterra∣neous
fires.</P>
<P>When a cavern sinks in the middle of a con∣tinent,
it produces a commotion which extends
to a greater or smaller distance, in proportion to
the quantity of motion excited by the fall of this
mass of earth; and, if this mass is inconsidera∣ble,
or falls from no great height, it will not
produce a succussion so violent as to be perceived
at a great distance; the effect is limited to the
neighbourhood of the sunk cavern; and if the
movement is propagated to greater distances,
it is only by slight tremblings or vibrations.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="146"/>
As most of the primitive mountains rest upon
caverns, because, at the moment of their con∣solidation,
these eminences were blown up by
the action of the internal fire, sinkings in the
mountains have happened, and still happen,
whenever the vaults of the caverns are under∣mined
by water, or shaken by any convul∣sion.
An entire portion of a mountain some∣times
sinks perpendicularly, but oftener inclines,
and not unfrequently reverses. Of this we have
striking examples in several of the Pyrennees,
where the strata, formerly horizontal, are often
inclined more than forty-five degrees; which
shows, that the entire mass of each portion of
the mountain, whose strata were parallel to each
other, has inclined by the lump, and, in the
moment of its sinking, rested upon a base in∣clined
to the horizon forty-five degrees. This
is the most general cause of the inclination of
strata in mountains. For the same reason, we
often find, between the adjacent eminences,
strata which descend from the first and rise to
the second, after having traversed the valley.
These strata are horizontal, and are bedded at
the same height in the two opposite hills, be∣tween
which the cavern had fallen in. The
earth sinks down, and the valley is formed,
without producing any other derangement than
a greater or smaller inclination of the strata, ac∣cording
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
to the depth of the valley, or the decli∣vity
of the two opposite hills.</P>
<P>This is the only sensible effect of the sinking
of caverns in mountains and other parts of con∣tinents.
But, whenever this effect happens in
the bottom of the sea, where sinkings must be more
frequent than on the land, because the water per∣petually
undermines the vaults in every place
where they support the bottom of the ocean,
these sinkings not only derange and incline the
strata, but sensibly lower the level of the sea.
From the first occupation of the waters, their
level has been depressed two thousand fathoms
by these sinkings; and, as all the submarine ca∣verns
have not yet fallen in, it is more than pro∣bable,
that the basin of the sea, by growing
more and more deep, will lessen its surface,
and, of course, that the extent of all the conti∣nents
will always continue to augment by the
retreat and sinking of the waters.</P>
<P>A second and more powerful cause than the
first concurs in producing the same effect. This
cause is the rupture and sinking of caverns by
the action of submarine fires. It is certain,
that no motion or sinking in the bottom of the
sea can happen without diminishing its surface:
And, if we consider the general effects of sub∣terraneous
fires, we will perceive that, as long
as there is fire, the commotions of the earth will
not be confined to simple tremblings; for the
efforts of fire raise and open the sea and the land
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
by violent and reiterated succussions, which not
only overturn and destroy the adjacent lands,
but shake those that are distant, and ravage or
derange every thing in the route of their direc∣tion.</P>
<P>The earthquakes occasioned by subterraneous
sires generally precede eruptions of volcano's,
and sometimes cease the moment the fire opens
a passage through the earth, and carries its flames
into the air. These dreadful earthquakes some∣times
continue during the whole time of eruptions.
These two effects are intimately connected.
There is never a great eruption of a volcano
without being preceded, or at least accompa∣nied,
with an earthquake. But we often feel
very violent succussions of the earth without a∣ny
eruption of fire. Those movements in which
fire has no part, proceed not only from the first
cause, the falling in of caverns, but likewise
from the action of subterraneous winds and
storms. There are many examples of lands rai∣sed
or sunk by the force of these internal winds.
Sir William Hamilton, a man as respectable for
his private character, as admirable for the extent
of his knowledge and researches on this subject,
told me that he had seen between Trente and Ve∣rona,
near the village of Roveredo, several little
hills composed of large masses of calcarious stones,
which had evidently been raised by different ex∣plosions
of subterraneous winds. There is no
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
indication of the action of fire upon any of these
rocks or their fragments. The whole country,
on both sides of the highway, for an extent of
near a league, has, from place to place, been
overturned by the prodigious efforts of subter∣raneous
winds: The inhabitants say that it hap∣pened
suddenly, and was the effect of an earth∣quake.</P>
<P>But the force of the wind, however violent,
appears not to be a cause sufficient to produce
such great effects; and, though there be no
marks of fire in these little hills raised by the
commotion of the earth, I am persuaded that
they have been elevated by electrical explosions
of subterraneous thunder, and that the internal
winds have contributed to this effect solely by
producing electrical storms in the cavities of the
earth. Hence all convulsive movements of the
earth may be referred to three causes: The first
and most simple is the sinking of caverns; the
second, storms and subterraneous thunder; and
the third, the action of fire kindled in the inte∣rior
parts of the globe. It is easy to ascribe
to one or other of these three causes all the
phaenomena which accompany or succeed earth∣quakes.</P>
<P>Commotions of the earth sometimes give rise
to eminences; but they more frequently produce
gulfs. On the 15th day of October 1773, a
gulf opened in the territory of Induno, in the
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
State of Modena, the cavity of which was
more than four hundred fathoms wide by two
hundred deep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. hist. et politique, Dec. 10. 1773, <HI>art. Milan.</HI></NOTE>. In 1726, a mountain of a
considerable height, situated in the northern part
of Iceland, was sunk in one night by an earth∣quake,
and a very deep lake assumed its place.
The same night, about a league and a half
distant, an ancient lake, the depth of which was
unknown, was entirely dried up, and its bottom
raised in such a manner as to form a pretty high
hill, which still exists<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Melanges interassans, tom. 1. p. 159.</NOTE>. In the seas in the
neighbourhood of New Britain, M. Bougain∣ville
remarks, earthquakes have terrible effects
on navigation. On the 17th of June, the 12th
and 27th of July 1768, there were three earth∣quakes
at Boero, and on the 22d of the same
month, one at new Brittany. These earthquakes
sometimes annihilate islands and known sand∣banks,
and sometimes create them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage autour du Monde, tom. 2. p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are earthquakes which extend to great
distances; but they are always longer than broad.
One of the most considerable was that felt in
Canada in the year 1663. It extended more
than two hundred leagues in length and one
hundred in breadth, <HI>i. e.</HI> more than twenty
thousand superficial leagues. The effects of the
last earthquake in Portugal, which happened
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
in our own time, were felt still farther. M. le Che∣valier
de Saint-Sauveur, King's commandant
at Merucis, informed M. de Gensanne, that,
when walking on the left margin of Jouante
in Languedoc, the sky suddenly became very
dark, and that, in a moment after, he perceived,
at the foot of the hill which is situated to the
right of that river, a terrible bright globe of fire:
Immediately there arose from the bowels of
the earth a considerable mass of rocks, and the
whole chain of mountains split from Merucis
to Florac, an extent of near six leagues. This
rent, in some places, is more than two feet wide,
and has partly fallen in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. de Languedoc, par M. de Gensanne, tom. 1. p. 231.</NOTE>. There are other
earthquakes which produce little or no commo∣tion.
Kolbe relates, that, on the 24th of
September 1707, from eight to ten o'clock be∣fore
noon, the sea rose upon the land at the
Cape of Good Hope and descended seven times
successively, and with such rapidity, that, from
one moment to another, the place was alternate∣ly
covered and left by the waters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descript. du Cap de Bonne-Esperance, tom. 2. p. 237.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the effects of earthquakes,
the falling of mountains, and the sinking of ca∣verns,
I shall subjoin a few facts, which are
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
both recent and well attested. In Norway, a
whole promontory called <HI>Hammersfields,</HI> sud∣denly
fell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. de Norwége, par Pontoppidan; <HI>Journal étran∣ger, Aoút</HI> 1755.</NOTE>. A very high mountain, near that
of Chimboraço, one of the highest of the Cor∣deliers
in the province of Quito, tumbled down
in a moment. This fact, with all its circum∣stances,
is related in the memoirs of M. de la
Condamine and Bouguer. Similar fallings
and sinkings often happen in the southern
islands of India. At Gamma-canore, where
the Dutch have a settlement, a high mountain
fell suddenly in the year 1673, when the
weather was fine: It was followed by an earth∣quake,
which overturned the neighbouring vil∣lages,
and destroyed several thousands of per∣sons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. de Voyages, tom. 17. p. 54.</NOTE>.
On the 11th of August 1772, in the
island of Java and province of Cheribou, one of
the richest settlements of the Dutch, a mountain,
of about three leagues in circumference, sud∣denly
sunk, and rose and sunk alternately like
waves in a stormy ocean: It at the same
time threw out many globes of fire, which
were seen at a great distance, and gave a light
as brilliant as that of day: All the plantations,
together with about two thousand one hundred
and forty inhabitants, without reckoning stran∣gers,
were entirely swallowed up<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See gazette de France, 21. Maii 1773, <HI>art. de la Hai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE>. We might
recite many other examples of the sinking of
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
lands and swallowing of mountains by the rup∣ture
of caverns, and the succussions occasioned
by earthquakes and the action of volcanoe's:
But we have said enough to establish the
general conclusions we have drawn from the
facts already related.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Volcano's.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancients have left us some notices con∣cerning
the volcano's which were known to
them, and particularly those of Aetna and Ve∣suvius.
Several learned and curious observers
have in our days examined more minutely
the form and effects of these volcano's. On
comparing their descriptions, the first observa∣tion
that presents itself, is the folly of transmit∣ting
to posterity the exact topography of these
burning mountains. Their form may be said
to change daily; their surface rises or sinks in
various places; every eruption produces new
gulfs or new eminences: To attempt to de∣scribe
all these changes, is to follow and paint
the successive ruins of a burning edifice. The
Vesuvius of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ny, and the Aetna of Empedocles,
present very different aspects from those which
have been so ably delineated by Sir William
Hamilton and Mr Brydone; and, in a few a∣ges,
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
these recent descriptions will no longer re∣semble
their objects. Next to the surface of
the ocean, nothing on this globe is so fluctua∣ting
and inconstant as the surface of volcanic
mountains: But even from this inconstancy,
and from the variation of form and move∣ments,
some general conclusions may be drawn,
by bringing particular observations under one
point of view.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Changes which have happened in Vol∣cano's.</HEAD>
<P>THE base of Aetna is about sixty leagues in
circumference, and its perpendicular height a∣bout
two thousand fathoms above the level of
the Mediterranean sea. We may, therefore,
regard this enormous mountain as an obtuse
cone, the superficies of which is not less than
three hundred square leagues. This conical
surface is divided into four zones, situated con∣centrically
above each other. The first is the
largest, and, by a gradual ascent, extends above
six leagues from the most distant point at the
foot of the mountain. This zone of six leagues
broad is almost totally peopled and cultivated.
The city of Catania and several villages are situ∣ated
in this first zone, the surface of which
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
exceeds two hundred and twenty square
leagues. The basis of this vast territory consists
of various strata of ancient and modern lavas,
that have run from different parts of the moun∣tain,
from which explosions of subterraneous
fires have issued. The surface of this lava,
mixed with ashes thrown out from different
craters, is converted into a fine soil, which is now
sown with grain and planted with vines, except
in a few places where the lava is too recent,
and still remains uncovered with earth. A∣bout
the top of the zone, we still see several cra∣ters,
more or less large and deep, from which
the materials issued that have formed the up∣per
stratum or soil.</P>
<P>The second zone commences at the termina∣tion
of these six leagues. This second zone is
an ascent of about two leagues broad. Its de∣clivity
is every where more rapid than that of
the first zone; and this rapidity augments in
proportion as you approach toward the sum∣mit.
The surface of this second zone is about
forty or forty-five square leagues: Its whole
extent is covered with magnificent forests, and
form a fine belt of verdure to the white and
hoary head of this venerable mountain. The
soil of these fine forests is nothing but lava and
ashes converted by the operation of time into
excellent earth. What is still more remarkable,
the surface of this zone is so unequal, that it e∣very
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
where presents hills, or rather mountains;
all of which have been produced by different
eruptions from the summit of Aetna, and other
craters below the summit, several of which
have formerly acted in this very zone, now
converted into forests.</P>
<P>Before arriving at the summit, and after
having passed these fine forests, we traverse a
third zone, which gives birth to small vegetables
only. In winter, this region is covered with
snow, which melts in summer. We afterwards
meet with a line of permanent snow, which
marks the commencement of the fourth zone,
and extends to the top of the mountain. These
snows and ice occupy about two leagues from
the region of small vegetables to the summit,
which is likewise covered with snow and ice.
Its figure is an exact cone; and it contains
the great crater of the volcano; from which are
continually discharged immense volumes of
smoke. The internal figure of the crater is
that of an inverted cone. It is composed of no∣thing
but ashes and other burnt matters thrown
out by the mouth of the crater, which is in the
centre of the volcano. The external surface of
the summit is very rough. The snow is cover∣ed
with ashes, and the cold is very piercing:
On the north side of this region of snow, there
are several small lakes which never freeze:
In general, the surface of this last zone is pretty
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
equal, and observes the same declivity, except in
a few places; and it is below this region only
where we meet with a great number of ine∣qualities,
eminences, and hollows produced by
eruptions, and where we see hills and moun∣tains
more or less recently formed, and com∣posed
of burnt matters rejected by these dif∣ferent
mouths or craters.</P>
<P>In 1770, according to Mr Brydone, the cra∣ter
on the top of Aetna was more than a league
in circumference; and very different dimensions
have been ascribed to it both by ancient and mo∣dern
authors. All these authors, however,
were right; for the dimensions of this mouth of
fire have undergone many alterations. All
we can infer from the various descriptions that
have been given of it, is, that the crater with its
margins have been four times overturned within
these six or seven hundred years. The mate∣rials
of which it is composed fall back into the
bowels of the mountain, are again rejected by
fresh eruptions, and form a new crater, which
augments and rises by degrees, till it again falls
back into the great gulf of the volcano.</P>
<P>The top of the mountain is not the only
place from which the subterraneous fire has been
discharged. Through the whole territory which
forms the sides and ridge of Aetna, and at great
distances from the summit, there are many
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
craters which give passage to the fire, and which
are surrounded with broken rocks that had been
discharged by different eruptions. We may
even reckon several hills formed by the erup∣tions
of these small volcano's which surround
the great one. Each of these hills has a crater
at its top, in the centre of which is a deep
mouth or gulf. Every eruption of Aetna has
produced a new mountain; and, perhaps, Mr
Brydone remarks, their number would determine,
better than any other method, that of the erup∣tions
of this famous volcano.</P>
<P>The city of Catania, which is situated at the
foot of Mount Aetna, has often been laid in ruins
by the lavas which issued from these new moun∣tains
during the time of their formation. In
ascending from Catania to Nicolosi, we traverse
twelve miles through a country formed by an∣cient
lavas, where we see the mouths of extin∣guished
volcano's, which at present are fertile
lands, covered with grass, corn, and vineyards.
The lavas which form this region proceeded
from the eruptions of the small mountains,
which are every where dispersed over the sides
of Aetna: They are all without exception, ei∣ther
regular hemispheres or cones. In gene∣ral,
every eruption raised one of these moun∣tains.
Hence the action of the subterraneous
fires does not always reach the summit of Aetna.
They often issue from the sides, and even from
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
the foot of this burning mountain. Each e∣ruption
from the sides of Aetna commonly pro∣duces
a new mountain composed of rocks, stones,
and ashes projected to a great distance by the
force of the fire; and the magnitude of these
new mountains is proportioned to the duration
of the eruption. If it continues but a few days,
it produces only a little hill, about a league in
circumference at the base, and three or four
hundred feet in perpendicular height. But, if
the eruption continues some months, like that
of 1669, it then gives rise to a considerable
mountain of two or three leagues in circumfe∣rence,
and nine hundred or a thousand feet
high; and all these hills produced by Aetna,
some of which are twelve thousand feet high,
appear only as small elevations intended to ac∣company
the majesty of the parent mountain.</P>
<P>In Vesuvius, which is a very small volcano
when compared with Aetna, eruptions from the
sides of the mountain are rare, and the lava ge∣nerally
issues from the crater at the summit.
But, in Aetna, eruptions more frequently pro∣ceed
from the sides than the top, and lava is∣sues
abundantly from every new mountain form∣ed
by these eruptions. Mr Brydone, according
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the information he received from M. Recupero,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the masses of stones projected from
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to such a height that they take
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne seconds of time in descending to
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
the earth; while those of Vesuvius fall in nine
seconds; hence the stones projected by Vesuvi∣us
rise to the height of 1215 feet, and those pro∣jected
by Aetna rise 6615 feet; from which we
may conclude, if the observations be accurate,
that the force of Aetna is to that of Vesuvius as
441 to 81, <HI>i. e.</HI> five or six times greater. That
Vesuvius is a very feeble volcano, when com∣pared
to Aetna, is proved in a more forcible
manner by this circumstance, that Aetna has ac∣tually
produced other volcano's, which are
larger than that of Vesuvius.</P>
<P>'Not a great way from this cavern, are two
of the most beautiful mountains of all that
number that spring from Aetna. I mounted
one of our best mules, and with a good deal
of difficulty arrived at the summit of the high∣est
of them, just a little before sun-set. The
prospect of Sicily, with the surrounding sea
and all its islands, was wonderfully noble. The
whole course of the river Semetus, the ruins
of Hybla, and several other ancient towns;
the rich corn-fields and vineyards on the low∣er
region of the mountain, and the amazing
number of beautiful mountains below, made a
delightful scene. The hollow craters of these
two mountains are each of them considerably
larger than that of Vesuvius. They are now
filled with stately oaks, and covered to a great
depth with the richest soil. I observed that
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
this region of Aetna, like the former, is com∣posed
of lava; but this is now covered so deep
with earth, that it is no where to be seen, but
in the beds of the torrents. In many of these
it is worn down by the water to the depth of
fifty or sixty feet, and in one of them still con∣siderably
more. . . This conical mountain is of
a very great size; its circumference cannot be
less than ten miles. Here we took a second
rest, as the greatest part of our fatigue still re∣mained.
The mercury had fallen to 20:4½.
—We found this mountain excessively steep;
and although it had appeared black, yet it was
likewise covered with snow. . . . The present
crater of this immense volcano is a circle of a∣bout
three miles and a half in circumference.
It goes shelving down on each side, and forms
a regular hollow like a vast amphitheatre.
From many places of this space, issue volumes
of sulphureous smoke, which, being much
heavier than the circumambient air, instead of
rising in it, as smoke generally does, imme∣diately
on its getting out of the crater, rolls
down the side of the mountain like a torrent,
till coming to that part of the atmosphere of
the same specific gravity with itself, it shoots off
horizontally, and forms a large track in the
air, according to the direction of the wind;
which, happily for us, carried it exactly to the
side opposite to that where we were placed.
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
The crater is so hot, that it is very dangerous,
if not impossible, to go down into it; besides,
the smoke is very incommodious, and, in
many places, the surface is so soft, there have
been instances of people sinking down in it,
and paying for their temerity with their lives.
Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth
of the volcano. . . . When we arrived at the
foot of the cone, we observed some rocks of
an incredible size, that have been discharged
from the crater. The largest that has been
observed from Vesuvius, is a round one of a∣bout
twelve feet in diameter. These are much
greater; indeed almost in proportion of the
mountains to each other.'</P>
<P>As all that region from the top of Aetna, to
the distance of two leagues below, presents an e∣qual
surface, without hills or valleys, and as the
ruins of Empedocles the philosopher's tower,
who lived four hundred years before the Chri∣stian
aera, are still to be seen, it is probable, that,
during all this period, the great crater has made
few or no eruptions. Hence the force of the
fire has diminished, as it no longer acts with vio∣lence
at the summit, and as all the modern e∣ruptions
have happened in the lower regions of
the mountain. However, within these few cen∣turies,
the dimensions of the great crater have
been often changed, as appears from the mea∣surements
of Sicilian authors at different periods.
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
Sometimes it falls down, and is again gradually
elevated till it falls afresh. The first of these
fallings, which are well attested, happened in the
year 1157, a second in 1329, a third in 1444,
and the last in 1669. But, from these facts we
should not conclude, as Mr Brydone has done,
that the crater will soon suffer another overthrow.
The notion, that this effect should be produced
every hundred years, seems to have no founda∣tion.
I should rather imagine, that, as the fire
no longer acts with violence at the summit, its
force has diminished, and will continue to di∣minish,
in proportion as the sea retires: It has
already retired several miles by the action of the
volcano, which has formed large banks and bul∣warks
by vast torrents of lava. Besides, we
know, from the diminished rapidity of Scylla
and Charybdis, and several other indications, that
the Sicilian sea has sunk considerably within
these two thousand five hundred years. We may,
therefore, conclude that this sea will continue to
sink, and, of course, that the action of the
neighbouring volcano's will not relax; so that
the crater of Aetna may remain during a long
time in its present state; and, if ever it falls
back into the gulf, it will probably be for the
last time. I farther presume, that Aetna ought
to be regarded as one of the primitive moun∣tains,
on account of its height and the immen∣sity
of its size, and that it began to act at the re∣mote
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
period when the waters first retreated.
Its action, however, ceased after this retreat, and
was not renewed till that modern period when
the Mediterranean sea, being elevated by the
rupture of the Bosphorus and the Straits of
Gibraltar, deluged the land between Sicily and
Italy, and approached to the basis of Aetna. Per∣haps
the first of these eruptions is still posterior
to this epoch of Nature. 'It is evident,' Mr
Brydone remarks, 'that Aetna did not burn in
the days of Homer, nor for a long time before,
otherwise it would have been impossible that
this poet should have talked so much of Sicily,
without mentioning an object so astonishing.'
This remark of Mr Brydone is extremely just;
and, of course, the first known eruptions of Aetna
should be dated after the age of Homer. But
we perceive, from the poetical allusions of Pin∣dar
and Virgil, and from the descriptions of an∣cient
and modern authors, that, in the space of
eighteen or nineteen centuries, the whole face
of this mountain and of the adjacent country
has been changed by earthquakes, eruptions, tor∣rents
of lava, and the formation of hills and
gulfs by these commotions. For the facts above
related I am indebted to Mr Brydone's excellent
performance; and I have too high an esteem
for Mr Brydone to believe that he can be offen∣ded,
because I do not agree with him as to the
force of volcano's, and some other conclusions
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
he has drawn from these facts. No preceding
author has observed with equal acuteness, or
presented such lively pictures of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jects he
surveyed; the whole republic of letters, there∣fore,
ought to unite in celebrating a work so de∣serving
of praise.</P>
<P>Torrents of glass in fusion, which have re∣ceived
the denomination of lavas, are not the first
effects of eruptions. These eruptions are com∣monly
announced by an earthquake more or less
violent, which is the first effort of the subterra∣neous
fire to escape from the bowels of the earth:
It soon, however, opens a passage, which it en∣larges
by projecting rocks and every other ob∣struction
to its motion. These materials, which
are exploded to a great height, fall back upon
each other, and form an eminence more or less
considerable in proportion to the duration and
violence of the eruption. As all the rejected
matters are penetrated by fire, and most of them
converted into burning ashes, the eminence to
which they give rise is a mountain of solid fire,
in which a great part of the matter is melted by
the fervency of the heat. This melted matter
soon begins to run, and generally flows to the
foot of the new mountain by which it was pro∣duced.
But, in small volcano's, which have not
force sufficient to throw the ejected matters to a
great distance, the lava issues from the top of the
mountain. This effect is conspicuous in the e∣ruptions
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
of Vesuvius. The lava rises in the
centre of the crater. The volcano first throws
out stones and ashes, which fall perpendicularly
back into the old crater and augments its size.
It is through this additional matter, which has
fallen back, that the lava opens a passage. These
two effects, though different in appearance, are
nevertheless the same; for, in a small volcano,
which, like Vesuvius, has not force enough to
give birth to new mountains by projecting its
materials to a distance, the whole fall back upon
the summit and increase its height; and it is at
the foot of this new crown of matter that the
lava forces its way and flows down the moun∣tain.
This last effort is generally succeeded by
a repose of the volcano. The succussions of the
earth within, and the projections without, cease
as soon as the lava flows. But the torrents of
this glass in fusion produce effects still more ex∣tensive
and disastrous than the convulsions of the
mountain during an eruption. These rivers of
fire ravage, destroy, and disfigure the surface of
the earth. Nothing can oppose their dreadful
progress. Of this the unfortunate inhabitants
of Catania have had fatal experience. As their
city had often been destroyed, either wholly or
in part, by these torrents of lava, they built very
strong walls of fifty-five feet in height. Sur∣rounded
by these ramparts, they believe them∣selves
to be safe. The walls, it is true, resisted the
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
heat and the weight of the torrent. But this
resistance served only to dam up the lava, which
rose above the ramparts, fell back upon the city,
and ravaged ever thing in its progress.</P>
<P>These torrents of lava are often half a league,
and sometimes even two leagues broad.</P>
<P>'The last lava we crossed before our arrival at
Catania, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st extent. I thought we never
should have done with it; it certainly is not
less than six or seven miles broad, and appears
in many places to be of an enormous depth.'</P>
<P>'When we came near the sea, I was desirous
to see what form it had assumed in meeting
with the water. I went to examine it, and
found it had driven back the waves for upwards
of a mile, and had formed a large black high
promontory, where before it was deep water.
This lava, I imagined, from its barrenness, for
it is as yet covered with a very scanty soil, had
run from the mountain only a few ages ago;
but was surprised to be informed by Signior
Recupero, the historiographer of Aetna, that
this very lava is mentioned by Diodorus Sicu∣lus
to have burst from Aetna in the time of
the second Punic war, when Syracuse was be∣sieged
by the Romans. A detachment was
sent from Taurominum to the relief of the be∣sieged.
They were stopped on their march
by this stream of lava, which having reached
the sea before their arrival at the foot of the
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
mountain, had cut off their passage; and obli∣ged
them to return by the back of Aetna, up∣wards
of 100 miles about. His authority for
this, he tells me, was taken from inscriptions
on Roman monuments found on this lava,
and that it was likewise well ascertained by
many of the old Sicilian authors. Now, as
this is about 2000 years ago, one would have
imagined, if lavas have a regular progress in
becoming fertile fields, that this must long a∣go
have become at least arable; this however
is not the case, and it is as yet only covered
with a very scanty vegetation, and incapable
of producing either corn or vines. There are
indeed pretty large trees growing in the cre∣vices,
which are full of a rich earth; but in
all probability it will be some hundred years
yet, before there is enough of it to render this
land of any use to the proprietors.'</P>
<P>'We passed the river Alcantara on our way
to Piedmonte, over a large bridge built entire∣ly
of lava; and near to this the bed of the ri∣ver
is continued for a great way, through
one of the most remarkable, and probably one
of the most ancient lavas that ever run from
Aetna. In many places the current of the river,
which is extremely rapid, has worn down the
solid lava to the depth of 50 or 60 feet. Re∣cupero,
the gentleman I have mentioned, who
is engaged in writing the natural history of
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
Aetna, tells me, he had examined this lava
with great attention, and he thinks that its
course, including all its windings, is not less
than 40 miles. It issued from a mountain on
the north side of Aetna, and finding some val∣leys
that lay to the east, it took its course that
way, interrupting the Alcantara in many
places, and at last arrived at the sea not far
from the mouth of that river.'</P>
<P>'The city of Jaci or Aci, and indeed all the
towns on this coast, are founded on immense
rocks of lava, heaped one above another, in
some places to an amazing height; for it ap∣pears
that these flaming torrents, as soon as
they arrived at the sea, were hardened into
rock, which not yielding any longer to the
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssure of the liquid fire behind, the melted
matter continuing to accumulate, formed a
dam of fire, which, in a short time, run over
the solid front, pouring a second torrent into
the ocean: T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is was immediately consolidated,
and succeeded by a third, and so on. . . . The
road from Jaci to this city is entirely over la∣va,
and consequently very fatiguing and
troublesome. Within a few miles of that
place, we counted eight mountains formed by
eruptions, with every one its crater, from
whence t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e burnt matter was discharged. Some
of these are very high, and of a great compass.
It appears evidently, that the eruptions of
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
Mount Aetna have formed the whole of this
coast, and in many places have driven back
the sea for several miles from its ancient boun∣dary. . .
At Catania, near to a vault, which is
now thirty feet below ground, and has pro∣bably
been a burial place, there is a draw-well,
where there are several strata of lavas, with
earth to a considerable thickness over the sur∣face
of each stratum. Recupero has made use
of this as an argument to prove the great an∣tiquity
of the eruptions of his mountain. For
if it requires two thousand years or upwards
to form but a scanty soil on the surface of a
lava, there must have been more than that
space of time betwixt each of the eruptions
which have formed these strata. But what
shall we say of a pit they sunk near to Jaci, of
a great depth? They pierced through seven
distinct lavas one under the other, the surfaces
of which were parallel, and most of them co∣vered
with a thick bed of rich earth. Now,
says he, the eruption which formed the lowest
of these lavas, if we may be allowed to reason
from analogy, must have flowed from the
mountain at least 14,000 years ago. . . .'</P>
<P>'The great eruption of 1669, after shaking
the whole country around for four months,
and forming a very large mountain of stones
and ashes, burst out about a mile above Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe∣lieri,
and descending like a torrent, bore directly
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
against the middle of that mountain, and (they
pretend) perforated it from side to side: This
however I doubt, as it must have broken the
regular form of the mountain, which is not
the case. But certain it is, that it pierced it
to a greath depth. The lava then divided in∣to
two branches; and surrounding this moun∣tain,
joined again on its south side; and lay∣ing
waste the whole country betwixt that and
Catania, scaled the walls of that city, and
poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In
its way, it is said to have destroyed the posses∣sions of near 30,000 people, and reduced them
to beggary. It formed several hills where
there were formerly valleys, and filled up a
large lake, of which there is not now the least
vestige to be seen. . . . There is no part of the
coast from Catania to Syracuse nearer than
thirty miles to its summit; and yet there has
hardly been any great eruption, where the
lava has not reached the sea, and driven back
its waters to a great distance, leaving high
rocks and promontories, that for ever set its
waves at defiance, and prescribe their utmost
limits. What a tremendous scene must the
meeting betwixt these adverse elements have
formed?'</P>
<P>'We may easily conceive the variety of
changes this coast has undergone in the space
of some thousands of years, as every great e∣ruption
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
must have made a considerable diffe∣rence.
—Virgil is wonderfully minute and ex∣act
in his geography of Sicily; and this is the
only part of the island that seems to be mate∣rially
altered since his time. He says there was
a very large port at the foot of Aetna, where
ships were secure from every wind;'
'Portus ab accessu ventorum immotus et ingens;'
'of which, at present, there are not the least
remains. It is probably the same that was call∣ed
by the Sicilians the port of Ulysses; which
is often mentioned by their writers.—The
place of its existence is still shewn betwixt
three and four miles up the country, amongst
the lavas of Aetna. . . .'</P>
<P>'The circumference of the great base of Aet∣na,
Recupero told me, he had been at a good
deal of pains to ascertain; as it had generally
been computed only at a hundred miles, or
little more, although the radii of that circle
had ever been esteemed at thirty of those miles;
an absurdity in computation that had put him
upon making this inquiry. The result was,
that taking the supposed distances of one place
from another, all the way round, the sum of
the whole amounted to one hundred and eighty∣three
miles: An immense circle surely, and
which is still enlarged by every considerable
eruption.'</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="173"/>
Here we have a territory of about 300 super∣ficial
leagues, all covered or formed by the pro∣jections
of volcano's. In this territory, inde∣pendent
of the peak of Aetna, there are many
other mountains, all of which are furnished with
craters, and exhibit an equal number of particu∣lar
volcano's. Aetna, therefore, must not be re∣garded
as a single volcano, but as an assemblage
of volcano's, the greater part of which are extin∣guished,
or burn with a gentle fire, and a few of
them still act with violence. At present, the
summit of Aetna throws out nothing but smoke;
an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there seems to have been no eruption from
it so a very long period of time; because it is
surrounded, to the distance of two leagues, with
an equal surface, and below this high region co∣vered
with snow, we find a large zone of vast
forests, the soil of which is a fertile earth of se∣veral
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>et in thickness. This inferior zone is
int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>persed with inequalities, and presents
heights, valleys, hills, and even pretty large
mountains. But, as almost the whole of these
inequalities are covered with a great thickness
of earth, and as a long succession of time was
necessary to convert volcanic matters into vege∣table
soil, we should regard the summit of Aet∣na,
and the other mouths which surround it to
the distance of sour or five leagues, as volca∣no's
almost extinct, or, at least, stifled for a
number of ages; for all the cruptions, the dates
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
of which can be ascertained for two thousand
five hundred years, have happened in the lower
region, <HI>i. e.</HI> five, six, or seven leagues distant
from the summit. The volcano's of Sicily seem
to have had two different ages: The first very
ancient, when the summit of Aetna began to act,
and when the universal ocean left this summit
dry, and sunk some hundreds of fathoms below:
It was at this period that the first eruptions hap∣pened,
which produced lava at the summit, and
gave rise to those hills found below in the re∣gion
of forests; but afterwards, the waters con∣tinuing
to sink, they totally abandoned this
mountain, as well as all the territories of Sicily
and the adjacent continents. After this total
retreat of the waters, the Mediterranean was
only a lake of a moderate extent, and its wa∣ters
were very distant from Sicily, and all the
countries whose coasts it now washes. During
all this time, which lasted several thousand
years, Sicily was perfectly tranquil: Aetna, and
the other ancient volcano's which surround its
summit, had ceased to act; and it was not till af∣ter
the augmentation of the Mediterranean by
the waters of the ocean and of the Black sea,
<HI>i. e.</HI> after the rupture of the straits of Gibraltar
and of the Bosphorus, that the waters attacked
the bases of the new mountains of Aetna, and
produced those modern eruptions which have
happened since the age of Pindar to the present
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
time; for this poet is the first author who has
taken notice of eruptions of volcano's in Sicily.
Vesuvius was precisely in the same situation:
It was long one of the extinguished volcano's of
Italy, which are very numerous; and their e∣ruptions
were not renewed till after the waters
of the Mediterranean were increased and reach∣ed
the bases of these inflammable mountains.
The memory of the first eruptions, and even of
all those which preceded the age of Pliny, was
entirely obliterated. Neither should this circum∣stance
excite surprise; for ten thousand years
have, perhaps, elapsed since the general retreat
of the waters to the augmentation of the Medi∣terranean,
and an equal portion of time from the
first eruption of Veluvius till their removal.
All these considerations seem to prove, that sub∣terraneous
fires cannot act with violence, unless
when they are so near the sea as to receive a
shock from a great body of water. This rea∣soning
is confirmed by other phaenomena: Vol∣cano's
sometimes throw out great quantities of
water, and likewise torrents of bitumen. P. de la
Torré, an able philosopher, relates, that, on the
10th of March 1755, an immense torrent of water
issued from the foot of the mountain, which de∣luged
the neighbouring country. This torrent
brought down such a quantity of sand, that it
covered an extensive plain. These waters were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery hot. The stones and sand left on the plain
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
differed not from those found in the sea. The
torrent of water was immediately followed by
another of inflamed matter, which proceeded
from the same opening<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Mont Vesuve, par le P. J. M. de la Torré; <HI>Journal étranger, mois Janvier</HI> 1576, <HI>p.</HI> 203.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The same eruption, 1755, was preceded,
says M. D'Arthenay, by an inflammation so
great, that it illuminated more than twenty-four
miles of country along the coasts of Catania. The
explosions were soon so frequent, that, on the
3d of March, we perceived a new mountain in
the top of the old summit, in the same manner
as lately happened to Vesuvius. Lastly, the
magistrates of Mascali informed us, that, on the
9th of the same month, the explosions were
terrible; that the whole sky was darkened with
smoke; that, on the approach of night, it be∣gan
to rain a deluge of small stones, some of
which weighed three ounces, and covered all
the adjacent cantons; that this tremendous rain
continued an hour and quarter, and was suc∣ceeded
by another of black ashes, which lasted
the whole night; that next day, about eight
o'clock in the morning, the summit of Aetna
threw out a river of water, which, for magni∣tude,
might be compared to the Nile; that the
most ancient and rugged mountains of lava
were in an instant converted by this torrent in∣to
a vast plain of sand; that the water, which
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>
fortunately ran not above half a quarter of an
hour, was very hot; that the stones and sand
carried along with it differed not from those of
the sea; that, after this inundation, there issued
from the same mouth a small rivulet of fire,
which flowed during twenty-four hours; that,
on the 11th, about a mile below this mouth, a
rent happened through which issued a stream
of lava, of about a hundred fathoms broad by
two miles in length, and that it continued its
course through the country the same day in
which M. D'Arthenay wrote this relation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. des Savans étrangers, imprimés comme suite des mem. de l'acad. des sciences, tom. 4. p. 147.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us attend to what Mr Brydon has re∣marked
concerning this eruption. 'Part of the
fine forests which compose the second region
of Aetna was destroyed by a very singular e∣vent,
not later than the year 1755. During
an eruption of the volcano, an immense tor∣rent
of boiling water issued, as is imagined,
from the great crater of the mountain, and in
an instant poured down to its base; over∣whelming
and ruining every thing it met with
in its course. Our conductors shewed us the
traces of this torrent, which are still very visible;
but are now beginning to recover verdure and
vegetation, which for some time appeared to
have been lost. The track it has left seems
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>
to be about a mile and a half broad; and in
some places still more.'</P>
<P>'The common opinion, I find, is, that this
water was raised by the power of suction,
through some communication betwixt the vol∣cano
and the sea; the absurdity of which is
too glaring to need a refutation. The power
of suction alone, even supposing a perfect va∣cuum,
could never raise water to more than
thirty-three or thirty-four feet, which is e∣qual
to the weight of a column of air the whole
height of the atmosphere.'</P>
<P>I must here observe, that Mr Brydone seems
to have deceived himself; for he confounds the
force arising from the weight of the atmosphere
with the force of suction produced by the ac∣tion
of fire. The force of the air, when a va∣cuum
is made, is indeed limited to thirty-four
feet. But the force of suction by fire has no
limits: It is always proportioned to the quan∣tity
and intensity of the heat by which it is
produced, as is evident from the common ef∣fects
of blast furnaces. Hence the opinion of
the <HI>enlightened people of the country,</HI> instead of
being absurd, seems to be well founded. It is
necessary that the cavities of volcano's should
communicate with the sea: Without this com∣munication,
such immense torrents of water
could not be thrown out, nor indeed could any
eruption ever happen; for no power, except
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
the shock produced by the mingling of fire and
water, could give rise to such violent effects.</P>
<P>The volcano of Pacayita, called the <HI>water vol∣cano</HI>
by the Spaniards, in all its eruptions,
throws out torrents of water. The last erup∣tion,
in the year 1773, destroyed the city of
Guatimala, and the torrents of water and lava
descended to the South Sea.</P>
<P>With regard to Vesuvius, it has been remark∣ed,
that a wind, which blows from the sea, pe∣netrates
into the mountain. The noise it makes
in certain cavities is heard, as if some torrent
passed below: This noise ceases whenever the
land winds blow, and, at the same time, the
exhalations from the mouth of Vesuvius be∣come
less considerable. But, when the wind
blows from the sea, this noise which resembles
that of a torrent, recommences, and the exha∣lations
of flame and smoke increase. The wa∣ter
of the sea, by thus insinuating itself into the
mountain, sometimes in greater, and sometimes
in smaller quantities, is the reason why this vol∣cano
has often thrown out both ashes and wa∣ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. historique et philos. de Vesuve, par M. l'Abbé Mecatti; <HI>journal étranger, mois Oct.</HI> 1754.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The learned M. D'Arthenay, who has com∣pared
the modern with the ancient state of Ve∣suvius,
relates, that, during the interval which
preceded the eruption 1631, the funnel or cra∣ter
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
of the mountain was covered with trees and
verdure; that the small plain which bounds it
produced excellent pasture; that, in departing
from the superior margin of the crater, we have
a mile to descend before we arrive at this plain,
in the middle of which was another gulf. We
descended this gulf about a mile, by narrow
and winding roads of an equal dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivity, which
led into a vast space surrounded with caverns,
from whence there issued <HI>winds so impetuous
and so cold, that it was impossible to endure them.</HI>
According to the same observer, the summit of
Vesuvius was then five miles in circumference.
We should not, therefore, be surprised, that
some philosophers have maintained that what
seems now to be two mountains, was formerly
one; that the volcano was in the center, but
that the south side, having fallen by the force
of some eruption, produced the valley which
separates Vesuvius from Mount <HI>Somma</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observ. sur le Vesuve, par M. d'Arthenay; <HI>Journal de Savans étrangers, tom.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 147.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Steller remarks, that the volcano's in the
north of Asia are almost always <HI>isolated</HI>; that they
have nearly the same surface; and that there are
always lakes on the summits, and hot waters at
the foot of those mountains whose volcano's are
extinct. This, he adds, is a farther proof of
the correspondence established by Nature be∣tween
the sea, mountains, volcano's, and hot
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
waters. We find many springs of hot water in
different parts of Kamtschatka<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 238.</NOTE>. In the island
of Sjanw, forty leagues distant from Ternate,
there is a volcano, which often throws out wa∣ter,
ashes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 17. p. 54.</NOTE>, &amp;c. But it is unnecessary to ac∣cumulate
more facts to prove the communica∣tion
of volcano's with the sea. The violence
of their eruptions would be sufficient to justify
the presumption; and the general fact, that all
acting volcano's are situated near the sea, com∣pletes
the demonstration. However, as some
philosophers have denied the reality and even
the possibility of this communication of volca∣no's
with the sea, I shall mention another fact
related by M. de la Condamine, a man equally
enlightened as worthy of credit. 'On the 14th
of June 1755,' he remarks, 'I mounted to
the summit of Vesuvius, and even to the brink
of the funnel formed round the mouth of the
volcano by its last explosion; and I perceived
in the gulf, about forty fathoms deep, a
great cavity resembling a vault toward the
north of the mountain. I threw down large
stones into this cavity, and counted twelve
seconds before the noise of their rolling cea∣sed.
At the end of their fall I heard a noise
similar to that of a stone falling into a mire;
and, when nothing was thrown in, I heard a
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
noise like that of agitated waves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage en Italie, par. M. de la Condamine; <HI>Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année</HI> 1757, <HI>p.</HI> 371.</NOTE>.' If the
fall of the stones had been perpendicular, and
met with no obstacle, twelve seconds would
have given a depth of 2160 feet, and the bot∣tom
of the gulf would, on this supposition, be
deeper than the level of the sea; for, according
to le P. de la Torré, in 1753 this mountain
was only 1677 feet above the surface of the sea,
and this elevation has been diminished since
that period. Hence we may conclude, that the
caverns of this volcano descend below the level
of the sea, and, of course, they may have sub∣terraneous
communications.</P>
<P>On the 15th of July 1753, I received, from
an eye-witness, and an accurate observer, a di∣stinct
detail of the then condition of Vesuvius.
I shall subjoin it in the words of the author, be∣cause
it will tend to fix our ideas concerning
what is to be farther apprehended from the ef∣fects
of this volcano, the force of which seems
to be greatly diminished.</P>
<P>'Having arrived at the foot of the mountain,
which is about two leagues distant from Na∣ples,
we mounted during an hour and a half
upon asses, and an equal portion of time was
employed in completing the journey on foot.
This is the steepest and most fatiguing part of
the way. We held by the belts of two men
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
who went before, and we climbed among ash∣es
and stones formerly exploded.'</P>
<P>'In our ascent, we saw the lavas of different
eruptions. The most ancient, whose age is
uncertain, but tradition assigns it two hundred
years, is of an iron-gray colour, and has all
the appearance of a stone: It is used for pa∣ving
the streets of Naples, and in other works
of masonry. We found others, which were
said to be sixty, forty, and twenty years old.
The last was thrown out in the year 1752. . .
These different lavas, except the most ancient,
when viewed at a distance, have the appear∣ance
of a blackish brown rugged earth, more
or less recently laboured. When viewed near∣er,
it is a matter perfectly similar to the refuse
of iron founderies. It is more or less compo∣sed
of earth and ferruginous matter, and ap∣proaches
more or less to the nature of stone.'</P>
<P>'When arrived at the top, which before the
eruption was solid, we find the first basin,
whose circumference is said to be two Italian
miles, and its depth appears to be about forty
feet. It is surrounded with a crust of earth,
which gradually thickens toward the base, and
its upper margin is two feet broad. The bot∣tom
of this basin is covered with a greenish
yellow sulphureous matter, which is hard and
warm, but does not burn; and smoke issues
through different sissures.'</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="184"/>
'In the centre of this basin, we see a second,
which is about half the circumference and half
the depth of the former. Its bottom is co∣vered
with a blackish brown matter, similar to
the freshest lavas we find on the road.'</P>
<P>'In the second basin, there is a small mount
which is hollow internally, open at the top,
and likewise open from the top to the base to∣ward
that side of the mountain where we a∣scended.
This lateral opening is about twenty
feet broad at the top, and four feet at the base.
The height of this small mount is about forty
feet; the diameter of the base is about as
much, and that of the opening at the top a∣bout
twenty feet.'</P>
<P>'This base rises about twenty feet above the
second basin, and forms a third basin, which
is filled with a liquid and burning matter, and
has a perfect resemblance to the melted metal
in an iron furnace. This matter perpetually
boils with great violence. Its movements have
the appearance of a lake moderately agitated,
and the noise it produces is similar to that of
waves.'</P>
<P>'Every minute, quantities of this matter are
projected into the air, like water thrown up
by many jets-d'eaux. These projections pro∣duce
the appearance of burning sheafs of
wheat, which rise to the height of thirty or
forty feet, and fall back in various curves,
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
partly into their own basin, and partly
the second, which is covered with a black
matter. It is the reflected light of these
burning jets which is seen from Naples du∣ring
the night. The noise they make in
their elevation and fall seems to be composed
of that of fire-works, and the noise produced
by the waves of the sea, when violently dash∣ed
against a rock.'</P>
<P>'The boilings and jets produce a perpetual
evacuation of this matter. Through the aper∣ture
of four feet, at the base of the small
mount, a burning rivulet of the same dimen∣sions
with the aperture continually slows, and
descends in an inclined canal, and with a mean
movement, into the second basin, where, after
dividing into several rills, it stops and is ex∣tinguished.'</P>
<P>'This burning rivulet consists of fresh lava,
which runs only eight days. But, if it con∣tinues
to augment, it will in time produce a
new overflowing into the plain, similar to that
which happened two years ago. The whole
is accompanied with a thick smoke, which has
not the odour of sulphur, but precisely that
which proceeds from a furnace where tiles
are roasted.'</P>
<P>'We may, without danger, go round the
margin of the crater; because the little hollow
mount, from which the burning projections
are made, is sufficiently distant to prevent all
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
apprehensions. We may also, without dan∣ger,
descend into the first basin; we may even
go upon the margin of the second, if the re∣verberation
of the burning matter does not
prevent us.'</P>
<P>'This was the real state of Vesuvius on the
15th of July 1753. But it perpetually chan∣ges
its form and aspect. It now throws out
no stones, and we perceive no flame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note sent to M. de Busson from Naples in September 1753.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>These observations seem to prove, that the seat
of the burning in this volcano, and perhaps in
all others, is at no great depth in the bowels of the
mountain, and that it is not necessary to sup∣pose
their fires on a level with, or lower than
the sea, and to make their explosions from
thence during the time of eruptions. It is suffi∣cient
that there are caverns and perpendicular
fissures below, or rather at the side of the fire,
which serve as ventilators to the furnace of the
volcano.</P>
<P>M. de la Condamine, who has had more op∣portunities
than any other philosopher, of exami∣ning
a number of volcano's in the Cordelieres,
has likewise explored that of Vesuvius, and all
the adjacent territories.</P>
<P>'In the month of June 1755,' he remarks,
'the summit of Vesuvius formed an open fun∣nel
in a mass of ashes, calcarious stones, and
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
sulphur, which burned at different distances,
and tinged the surface with its colour. The
fire streamed through different crevices, in
which the heat was so great, that, in a short
time, it inflamed a stick thrust some feet down
these fissures.'</P>
<P>'For several years past, the eruptions of this vol∣cano
have been frequent; and, every time flames
and liquid matter were thrown out the moun∣tain
underwent considerable changes both in
its height and external figure. . . . In a small
plain, on the side of the mountain composed
of ashes and stones projected from the volca∣no,
there is a breast of steep semicircular rocks
of two hundred feet high, which bound this
plain on the north. We perceived, near the
crevices recently opened in the flanks of the
mountain, the places through which the tor∣rents
of lava, with which the whole of this
valley is filled, had issued during the last e∣ruption.'</P>
<P>'This spectacle presents the appearance of me∣tallic
waves cooled and congealed. We may
form an imperfect idea of it by imagining a
sea of thick and tenacious matter, the waves of
which had begun to calm. This sea has its
islands: They are detached masses, like hol∣low
spongy rocks, whimsically interspersed
with vaults and grotto's, under which the
burning liquid had made a kind of reservoirs
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
resembling furnaces. From these grotto's,
with their vaults and pillars, hang numbers of
scoriae in the form of irregular grapes of all
shades and colours. . . . .'</P>
<P>'All the mountains and coasts in the envi∣rons
of Naples, are nothing but masses of burnt
matter thrown out by volcano's which now no
longer exist, and whose eruptions, which have
been anterior to all history, probably formed
the ports of Naples and Puzzoli. The same
matters are conspicuous on the whole road
from Naples to Rome, and even at the port
of Rome itself.'</P>
<P>'The whole interior part of Mount Frascati,
the chain of hills which extends from this place
to Grotta-ferrata, Castlegandolfo, and as far
as lake Albano, a great part of Mounts Tivo∣li,
Caprarola, Viterbe, &amp;c are composed of
calcined stones, of pure ashes, of scoriae, of
matter similar to the dross of iron and burnt
earth, and of real lava; lastly, the whole mat∣ters
resemble those of which the soil of Portici
is composed, and which have issued from the
sides of Vesuvius in so many different forms.
. . . Hence we must necessarily conclude, that
all this part of Italy has been overturned by vol∣cano's. . . .'</P>
<P>'Lake Albano, whose margins are interspersed
with calcined matters, is nothing but the mouth
of an ancient volcano. . . . The chain of Ita∣lian
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
volcano's extends as far as Sicily, and
still exhibits a number of fires under different
forms; in Tuscany, we have the exhalations of
Firenzuola, and the warm waters of Pisa; in
the Ecclesiastic state, those of Viterbe, of
Norcia, of Nocera, &amp;c.; in the kingdom of
Naples, those of Ischia, Solfatara, and Vesu∣vius;
in Sicily and the islands adjacent to Aet∣na,
the volcano's of Lipari, Stromboli, &amp;c.
The other volcano's of this chain have been
extinct from time immemorial, and have left
such relicks as, though they do not always
strike us at first sight, fail not to be recognisa∣ble
on an attentive examination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage en Italie, par M. de la Condamine; Acad. des Sciences, année 1757, p. 371.—379.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'It is very probable, says M. l'Abbé Mecati,
that, in past ages, the kingdom of Naples, be∣sides
Vesuvius, was infested with several other
volcano's.'</P>
<P>'Mount Vesuvius,' le P. de la Torré remarks,
seems to be a portion detached from that chain
of mountains which, under the name of <HI>A∣pennines,</HI>
divides all Italy through its whole
length. . . . . This volcano is composed of
three different mountains, one of them is Ve∣suvius
properly so called; the other two are
Mounts Somma and Otajano. The two last
are situated toward the west, and form a kind
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
of semicircle round Vesuvius, with which they
have a common base.'</P>
<P>'This mountain was formerly surrounded
with fertile fields, and itself covered with trees
and verdure, except the summit, which was
flat and sterile, and where several open ca∣verns
were to be seen. The top was surround∣ed
with rocks, which rendered it of difficult
access. These rocks were so high, that they
concealed the valley between Vesuvius and
Mounts Somma and Otajano. The summit
of Vesuvius, which has since sunk considera∣bly,
being then much more remarkable, it is
not surprising that the ancients believed it had
only one top. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The breadth of the valley is 2220 Paris
feet, and its length nearly the same. . . .
It invests one half of Vesuvius, and, like all
the sides of the mountain, it is covered with
burnt sand and small pumice stones. The
rocks on Mounts Somma and Otajano ex∣hibit
a few herbs, and the surface of these
mountains is covered with trees and verdure.
These rocks, at first sight, have the appearance
of burnt stones; but, on a closer examination,
they are, like the rocks of other mountains,
composed of strata of natural stones, of a
chesnut coloured earth, of chalk, and of white
stones, which have not the smallest appear∣ance
of having been liquified by fire. . .'</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="191"/>
'Round Vesuvius we see openings which
have been made at different times, and through
which lavas had issued. These torrents of burn∣ing
matter, which sometimes come from the
sides, and sometimes from the top of the
mountain, descend into the plains, and some∣times
run as far as the sea, and harden like a
stone when the matter cools. . . .'</P>
<P>'On the summit of Vesuvius there is only a
small margin of four or five palms wide, and
describes a circumference of 5624 Paris feet.
Upon this margin we can walk pretty commo∣diously.
The whole of it is covered with
burnt sand, under which we find stones part∣ly
natural and partly calcined. . . . In
two elevations on this margin, we find beds
of natural stones, arranged in the same man∣ner
as in other mountains; which confutes
the notion of those who regard Vesuvius as a
mountain gradually raised above the plain of
the valley. . .'</P>
<P>'The depth of the gulf where the matter
boils is about 543 feet; and the height of the
mountain above the level of the sea is 1677
feet, which is one third of an Italian mile.'</P>
<P>'This height has been more considerable.
The eruptions which have changed the ex∣ternal
form of the mountain, have likewise
diminished its elevation; for the parts they
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
detached from the summit rolled into the
gulf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. du Mont Vesuve, par le P. de la Torré; <HI>Journal é∣tranger, Janvier</HI> 1756, <HI>p.</HI> 182.—208.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>From all these examples, if we consider the
external figure of Sicily and other countries ra∣vaged
by fire, we shall evidently perceive that
no volcano exists which is purely isolated or
detached. The surface of these countries every
where presents a succession and sometimes
groups of volcano's. This we have already
seen with regard to Aetna, and shall give a se∣cond
example of it in Hecla. A great part of
the island, like Sicily, is only a group of volca∣no's,
which I shall prove by the following
observations.</P>
<P>The whole island ought be regarded as a
vast mountain interspersed with deep cavities,
concealing in its bowels great quantities of
minerals, vitrified and bituminous substances,
and rising from the midst of the sea in the form
of a short flattened cone. Its surface presents
to the eye nothing but tops of mountains co∣vered
with snow and ice; and lower down we
have the picture of confusion and ruin. It
is an enormous mass of stones and fragments
of rocks, which are sometimes porous and half
calcined, and exhibit a hideous appearance by
their blackness and the marks of fire impressed
upon them. The fissures and hollows of rocks
are filled with a red, and sometimes with a black
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
or white sand: But, in the valleys between the
mountains, we find agreeable plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introd. a l'Hist. du Denemarck.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Most of Jokuts, which are mountains of a mid∣dle
height, and overtopped by others of a great∣er
elevation, are volcano's that occasionally
throw out flames, and produce earthquakes:
Of these there are no less than twenty in this
island. The inhabitants in the neighbourhood
of these mountains have learned by experience
and observation, that, when the ice and snow
rise to a considerable height, and stop the
mouths of these cavities, which formerly
discharged flames, that earthquakes are about
to happen, which are always succeeded by erup∣tions
of fire. It is for this reason that the Ice∣landers
are at present afraid lest the Jokuts,
which, in the year 1728, threw out flames in
the canton of Skaftfield, should soon be again
inflamed; the ice and snow being accumulated on
their summits, and appearing to obstruct those
vents which favoured the exhalations of the
subterraneous fires.</P>
<P>In 1721, the Jokut called Koëtlegan, about
five or six leagues to the west of the sea, near
the bay of Portland, broke out into flames, af∣ter
several succussions of the earth. This con∣flagration
melted masses of ice of an enormous
thickness, and gave rise to impetuous torrents,
which deluged the country, and carried down
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
to the sea prodigious quantities of earth, sand,
and stones. The solid masses of ice, and the
immense quantity of earth, stones, and sand,
transported by the inundation, so loaded the
sea, that, at half a mile from the coast, a small
mountain was formed, which still appeared
above the sea in the year 1750. We may
form some idea of the quantity of matter carri∣ed
down to the sea by this inundation, when
we consider that it was obliged to retreat
twelve miles beyond its former limits.</P>
<P>The inundation continued three days; and
it was not till after this period that a person
could pass on foot to the mountains. . . .</P>
<P>Hecla, which has always been regarded as
one of the most famous volcano's in the uni∣verse,
on account of its tremendous eruptions,
is now one of the least dangerous in the island.
Mounts Koëtlegan and Krafle have recently
made as great ravages as Hecla did of old. It
has been remarked, that this last volcano has
thrown out flames ten times only in the space
of eight hundred years, namely, in the years
1104, 1157, 1222, 1300, 1341, 1362, 1389,
1558, 1636, and, lastly, in the year 1693.
This eruption commenced on the 13th of
February, and continued to the month of Au∣gust
following. All the other eruptions lasted
a few months only. From the above dates it
appears, that Hecla made its greatest ravages
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
in the fourteenth century, having undergone no
less than four eruptions; that it remained per∣fectly
tranquil during the 15th century; and
that it threw out no fire for one hundred and
sixty years. From this period, there was one
eruption only in the sixteenth, and two in the
seventeenth century. We now perceive in this
volcano neither fire, nor smoke, nor exhalations
of any kind. We only find, in some small
hollows, as is common in many other parts of
the island, boiling water, stones, sand, and
ashes.</P>
<P>In 1726, after a few succussions of the earth,
which were felt only in the northern cantons,
Mount Krafle began to throw out, with a dread∣ful
noise, smoke, flames, ashes and stones. This
eruption continued two or three years, without
doing any damage; because the whole rejected
matter fell back upon the mountain, or round
its base.</P>
<P>In 1728, the fire communicated with some
mountains situated near Krafle, which burnt
during several weeks. When the minerals they
contained were melted, a river of fire ran gent∣ly
toward the south into the country below these
mountains. This river threw itself into a lake
about three leagues from Mount Krafle, and,
by the shock of the water, produced a horrible
noise, and clouds of vapours. The running of
the lava did not cease till 1729, when the mat∣ter
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
which formed it was probably exhausted.
The lake was filled with an immense quantity
of calcined stones, which raised its water consi∣derably.
It is about twenty leagues in circum∣ference,
and situated at an equal distance from
the sea. We shall not take notice of the other
volcano's in this island; it is sufficient that we
have mentioned the most considerable of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 9. 10. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this description we perceive, that the
Jokuts of Hecla greatly resemble the secondary
volcano's of Aetna; that, in both, the highest
summit is tranquil; that the summit of Vesu∣vius
is much sunk; and that probably those of
Aetna and Hecla were formerly higher than they
are at present.</P>
<P>Though the topography of volcano's in other
parts of the world is not so well known as that
of those in Europe, we may, nevertheless, pre∣sume,
from analogy, and the similarity of their
effects, that they resemble each other in every
respect. They are all situated in islands, or up∣on
the coasts of continents. Almost the whole
of them are surrounded with secondary vol∣cano's.
Some of them are active, and others
extinguished or quiet. The number of the lat∣ter
is greater, even in the Cordelieres, which ap∣pear
to be the most ancient domain of volcano's.
In the south of Asia, the islands of Sonde, the
Moluccas, and Philippines, bear evident marks of
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
destruction by fire, and are still infested with
volcano's. They are likewise very frequent in
the island of Japan: This country is also more
subject to earthquakes than any other part of
the globe. In many places of Japan there are
hot fountains. Most of the Indian islands, and
all the seas of these eastern regions, present to
our eyes nothing but peaks and detached sum∣mits,
which vomit out fire, and deep indented
coasts, the relicks of ancient continents which
are now no more. Here the mariner often
meets with ports which daily sink; and even
whole islands have been known to disappear,
and to be swallowed up, with their volcano's,
by the waters. The seas in China are warm,
which is a proof that there is a great efferves∣cence
in the maritime basins of this region.
The hurricanes are tremendous, and water∣spouts
are frequent. The tempests are always
preceded by general and perceptible boilings of
the waters, and by various meteors and other
exhalations with which the atmosphere is load∣ed.</P>
<P>The volcano of Teneriff has been explored
by Dr Thomas Heberden, who resided several
years in the village of Oratava, which is situated
at the foot of the Peak. In his way he found
large stones disposed on all sides at several lea∣gues
from the top of the mountain. Some of
them appeared to be entire, and others seemed
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
to have been burnt, and thrown to this distance
by the volcano. In ascending the mountain he
still saw burnt rocks scattered about in large
masses.</P>
<P>'We arrived,' Dr Heberden remarks, 'at
the famous grotto of Zegds, which is surround∣ed
on all sides with enormous masses of burnt
rocks. . . . .'</P>
<P>'A quarter of a league higher, we met with
a sandy plain, in the middle of which there is
a pyramid of sand, or yellowish ashes, called
the <HI>Sugar Loaf.</HI> Round its base, fuliginous
vapours perpetually arise. From thence to the
summit, the distance might be half a quarter of
a league. But the ascent is too difficult, on
account of its steepness and the bad footing. . .'</P>
<P>'However, we reached what is called the
<HI>Cauldron</HI> which is twelve or fifteen feet deep.
Its sides taper to the bottom, and form a cavity
which resembles a reversed cone. . . . Here
the ground is very warm; and, from about
twenty tubes or chimneys, a thick sulphureous
vapour arises. The whole ground seems to be
mixed with sulphur, which gives the surface
a brilliant appearance. . . . .'</P>
<P>'Upon almost all the stones in the neigh∣bourhood,
we perceive a greenish colour, in∣termixed
with yellow like gold. A small part
of this sugar-loaf is as white as chalk; and an∣other
<PB N="192" REF="199"/>
other part, still lower, resembles red clay co∣vered
with salt. . . . .'</P>
<P>'In the middle of another rock, we discover∣ed
a hole, which exceeded not two inches in
diameter, from whence proceeded a noise simi∣lar
to that of a considerable quantity of water
boiling over a great fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations on the Peak of Teneriff by Dr Heberden.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The Azores, the Canaries, the islands of Cape
Verd, Ascension island, and the Antilles, which
appear to be the relicks of ancient continents
that united the Old Continent with America,
offer nothing to our observation but burnt lands,
or lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s which still continue to burn. The vol∣cano's
formerly sunk under the waters with the
countries which supported them, excite such
terrible tempests, that, in one of these storms
which happened at the Azores, the suet fixed to
the end of the plumb-line melted by the heat
at the bottom of the sea.</P>

<P>THE number of extinguished volcano's ex∣ceed

They are very numerous in almost every part
of the earth. I might mention those remarked
by M. de la Condamine in the Cordelieres, and
by M. Frenaye in St Domingo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Busson, by M. Frenaye, March 10. 1777.</NOTE>, near Port-au-Prince,
and those of Japan and the other eastern
and southern islands of Asia, the whole of which
countries have been formerly ravaged by fire.
But I shall limit myself to the extinguished vol∣cano's
of the isles of France and Bourbon, which
have been recognised by some enlightened
voyagers.</P>
<P>'The soil of the isle of France,' says M. l'Ab∣bé
de la Caille, 'is covered with a prodigious
number of stones of all sizes, which are of a
blackish ash-colour. Many of them are full
of holes, like a sieve. Most of them contain a
great quantity of iron; and the surface of the
earth is covered with the ore of this metal.
We likewise find, especially on the north coast
of the island, a great many pumice stones, lavas,
or refuse of iron, profound grottos, and other
manifest vestiges of extinguished volcano's. . .'</P>
<P>'The isle of Bourbon,' continues M. l'Abbé de
la Caille, 'though larger than the isle of France,
is only a large mountain, split as it were from
its summit into three different parts. Its top is
covered with wood, and inhabited; and two
thirds of its declivity, which extends as far as
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
the sea, are cleared and cultivated. The rest
is covered with the lavas of a volcano, which
burns slowly, and without any noise. It seems
not to burn much, except during the rainy
seasons. . . . .'</P>
<P>'Ascension island has visibly been formed
and burnt by a volcano. It is covered with
a red earth, similar to brick-dust or burnt
clay. . . . . The island is composed of several
mountains from 100 to 150 fathoms high.
There is one still larger to the south of the
island, which is about 400 fathoms in height. .
Its summit is double and lengthened: But all
the others are pretty perfect cones, and cover∣ed
with red earth. The land and part of the
mountains are interspersed with prodigious
quantaties of rocks full of holes, like sieves, and
with very light calcarious stones, a number of
which resembled coagulated milk; some of
them were laid over with a dirty white varnish
approaching to green. Pumice stones are like∣wise
very frequent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1754, p. 111. 121. and 126.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The celebrated Captain Cook remarks, that,
in an excurtion to the interior parts of Otaheite,
they found burnt rocks, like those of Madeira;
that all the stones bore incontestible marks of fire;
that they likewise perceived traces of fire in the
clay upon the hills; and that Otaheite and a
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
number of adjacent islands might be supposed to
be the relicks of a continent which had been swal∣lowed

Philip Carteret tells us, that one of the Char∣lotte

is of a prodigious height and a conical figure;
that its summit is like a funnel, from which
smoke issues, but no flames; and that, on the

three mountains, from one of which proceeds a

<P>We find basalts in the isle of Bourbon, where
the volcano, though feeble, still acts; in the isle
of France, where all the fires are extinct; and
in Madagascar, where there are both active and
extinguished volcano's. But, to mention no o∣ther
basalts but those of Europe, we know that
there are considerable masses of them in Ireland,
in Britain, in Auvergne, upon the borders of the
Elbe, in Misnia upon Mount Cattener, at Ma∣rienburg,
at Weilbourg in the county of Nassau,
at Lauterback, at Billstein, in several parts of Hesse,
in Lusace, in Bohemia, &amp;c. These basalts are
most beautiful lavas produced in all these coun∣tries,
by volcano's which are now extinct. But

'The mountains of Auvergne,' says M. Guet∣tard,
'which have formerly, in my estimation,
been volcano's. . . . . are those of Volvic two
leagues from Riom, of Puy-de-dôme near Cler∣mont,
and of Mount Or. The volcano of Vol∣vic
has formed, by its different lavas, strata ly∣ing
upon each other, and composing enormous
masses, in which quarries are dug, and furnish
stones to several places at a distance. . . . . It
was at Moulins where I first discovered lava. . .
and being at Volvic, I perceived that the
mountain was almost entirely composed of
matters which had been thrown out by the e∣ruptions
of volcano's.'</P>
<P>'The figure of this mountain is conical, and
its base consists of rocks of a grayish white gra∣nite,
or of the colour of a pale rose. . . . The
rest of the mountain is composed entirely of
blackish or reddish pumice stones, heaped upon
each other without order or connection. . . . .
About two thirds up the mountain, we meet
with irregular rocks, bristled with mishapen
points turned to all sides, and of an obscure red
or dirty black. They are solid and hard, and
have no holes, like the pumice stones. . Before
arriving at the summit, we find a hole of some
fathoms wide, and of a conica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> figure, approach∣ing
to that of a funnel. . . . The part of the
mountain to the north and east, appeared to be
so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely compo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of pum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce stones. . . . . . In
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
Volvic, the beds of stone follow the inclination
of the mountain, and seem to be continued
through it, and to communicate with those dis∣covered
by the ravines a little below the sum∣mit. . .
These stones are of an iron gray co∣lour,
and seem to have a white grain, which
comes out on the surface like an efflorescence:
Though spongy, and full of small irregular
holes, they are hard.'</P>
<P>'Mount-puy-de-dôme is nothing but a mass
of matter which indicates the dreadful effects
of the most violent fire. . . . In those places
of the mountain which are not covered with
plants and trees, we travel among pumice
stones, pieces of lava, and a gravel or sand,
formed by a kind of iron dross and small bits
of pumice-stones mixed with ashes.'</P>
<P>'These mountains exhibit several peaks, and
all of them have cavities or funnels of greater
or smaller dimensions. One of these peaks, the
road which leads to it, and the whole space as
far as Puy-de-dôme, are only vast h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aps of
pumice-stones. The same observation is ap∣plicable
to the other peaks, which are fifteen
or sixteen in number, situated in the same line
from south to north, and all of them furnish∣ed
with funnels.'</P>
<P>'The top of the peak of Mount Or is a rock
composed of a tender whitish ash-coloured
stone, similar to that on the summits of all the
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
mountains in this volcanic country: It is on∣ly
a little lighter than that of Puy-de-dôme.'</P>
<P>'If I found not on this mountain as many
vestiges of a volcano as in the other two, it
must be partly ascribed to this circumstance,
that Mount Or is more covered, through its
whole extent, with trees and shrubs, than
Mounts Volvic and Puy-de-dôme. . . . How∣ever,
the south-east part is entirely bare, and
entirely composed of stones and rocks, which
seem to have been exempted from the effects
of the fire. . . .'</P>
<P>'But the peak of Mount Or is a cone similar
to those of Volvic and Puy-de-dôme. To the
east of this point is the Peak du Capuchin,
which is likewise conical, but not so regular as
those of the preceding mountains. It even
appears that this peak has undergone more
changes in its structure; for every thing is more
irregular, and broken into smaller portions. . .
There are still several other peaks, the bases of
which rest upon the ridge of the mountain; but
they are all overtopped by Mount Or, which
is 509 fathoms high. . . . The peak of Mount
Or is very rugged: It terminates in a point a∣bout
fifteen or twenty feet in diameter. . . .'</P>
<P>'There are several conical mountains between
Thiers and Saint Chaumont, which led me to
think,' says M. Guettard, 'that they might
have been burnt. . . . Though I have never

been at Pontgibault, I have sufficient proofs to
convince me that the mountains of this canton
are extinguished volcano's; I have received
fragments of lava from them, which it was
easy to recognise by the yellow and blackish

collection of volcanic matter, which they fol∣lowed
to its source. It was not difficult to re∣cognise
the volcano. It is a very high moun∣tain,
on the top of which they found a mouth
of about 80 feet in diameter. Below this mouth
the lava is partly visible. It has flowed down
the ravines in great masses, for the space of seven
or eight thousand fathoms. The matter has
heaped together while yet burning in certain
places; and, after fixing, it chapped and split
through its whole thickness, and left the whole
plain covered with innumerable columns, from
fifteen to thirty feet long by about seven inches
in diameter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Journal de Physiques, par M. l'Abbé Rozier; <HI>Mois de Decembre</HI> 1775, <HI>p.</HI> 516.</NOTE>.</P>

were a very hard lava, or a matter melted by
a volcano, which had long been extinguished.
The whole mountain of Montferrier is inter∣spersed
with these stones, and the streets are
paved and the village partly built with them.

is to be remarked of this canton, that it con∣sists
of almost nothing but a mass of lava, and

<P>I could give many other examples, which all

I must here remark, that, between these
two, there are, as in all the other operations of
Nature, intermediate states, degrees, and shades,
of which we can only lay hold of the principal
traits. For example, the Solfataras are neither
active nor extinguished volcano's, but seem to
participate of both. These no man has better
described than one of our learned Academicians,
M. Fougeroux de Bondaroy; I shall, therefore,
lay before the reader his chief observations.</P>
<P>'Solfatara, situated four miles west from Na∣ples,
and-two miles from the sea, is surround∣ed
on all sides with mountains. Before arri∣ving
at it, we must ascend about half an hour.
The space comprised between the mountains
forms a basin of about 1200 feet in length by
800 feet broad. With regard to the moun∣tains,
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
it lies in a bottom; but it is not so low
as the ground you traverse in going to it.
The soil in the bottom of the basin is a very
fine, close, beaten sand, and it is so dry and
parched that it produces no vegetables. The
colour of the sand is yellowish. . . . The sul∣phur,
which is found in great quantities among
the sand, gives it this colour. The mountains
which bound the greatest part of the basin
consist of bare rocks, without earth or plants.
Some of them are split, and their parts are
burnt and calcined; but the whole present no
arrangement or order in their position. . . . .
They are covered with greater or smaller quan∣tities
of sulphur, which is sublimed in this part
of the mountain and in the neighbouring basin.'</P>
<P>'The opposite side consists of a better soil. . .
Neither does it present furnaces similar to those
formerly mentioned, and which are common
on the other side.'</P>
<P>'In several places, we find, in the bottom of
the basin, apertures or mouths, from which
issues smoke, accompanied with a heat that
would burn the hands smartly; but it is not
strong enough to kindle paper. . . .'</P>
<P>'The adjacent places produce a heat which
is felt through the shoes, and a disagreeable
odour of sulphur exhales from them. . . When
a sharp pointed stick is thrust into the ground,
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
there soon issues a vapour or smoke, similar to
that which exhales from the natural crevices.'</P>
<P>'Through these apertures, a small quantity
of sulphur is sublimed, together with a salt
which has all the characters of sal ammoniac.'</P>
<P>'On several stones which surround Solfatara,
we find threads of allum. . . . Lastly, sulphur
is collected from Solfatara. . . . This substance
is extracted from grayish stones, intersp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsed
with shining particles, which are sulphur cry∣stallized
between the stony particles. . . These
stones are sometimes impregnated with allum.'</P>
<P>'By striking the middle of the basin with
our foot, we easily perceive that the ground is
hollow below.'</P>
<P>'If we traverse the side of the mountain,
where the mines are most numerous, we find
lavas, pumice-stones, the dross of volcano's,
&amp;c. In a word, the whole appearances, when
compared with the matters at present furnish∣ed
by Vesuvius, demonstrate that Solfatara was
formerly the mouth of a volcano. . . .'</P>
<P>'The basin of Solfatara has often changed
its form; and we may conjecture that it will
still assume others. This territory daily hol∣lows
and undermines itself. It at present
forms a vault which covers an abyss. . . . If
this vault sinks, the abyss will probably fill
with water and produce a lake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1765, p. 267.—283.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213"/>
M. Fougeroux de Bonderoy has likewise made
some observations on Solfataras in other
parts of Italy.</P>
<P>'I have been,' says he, 'at the source of a
rivulet, which we pass in the road between
Rome and Tivoli, the water of which has a
strong odour of liver of sulphur. . . . .
It forms two small lakes, about forty fathoms
in their greatest extent. . .'</P>
<P>'One of these lakes, according to the plumb∣line
we were obliged to use, was, in different
places, 60, 70, and 80 fathoms deep. . . In
these lakes we saw several floating islands,
which sometimes change their situation. . . .
They are composed of plants reduced into a
kind of light turf, upon which the waters,
though corrosive, have no effect. . . .'</P>
<P>'The heat of these waters was 20 degrees,
when the thermometer in the open air stood at
18 degrees. Thus it appears from experiment,
that the heat of these waters is inconsiderable. .
They exhale a disagreeable odour; and this
vapour changes the colour of vegetables and
of copper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1770, p. 1.—7</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'The Solfatara of Viterbe,' M. l'Abbé Ma∣zeas
remarks, 'has a mouth of from three
to four feet only. Its waters boil, exhale an
odour of the liver of sulphur, and petrify
their canals, like those of Tivoli. . . The de∣gree
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
of their heat is that of boiling water,
and sometimes more. . . The volumes of
smoke, which sometimes arise, indicate a still
greater heat; and yet the bottom of the basin
is covered with plants which grow in the
bottom of the lakes, and in the marshes.
In ferruginous soils, these waters produce vi∣triol,'
&amp;c.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. des Savans étrangers, tom. 5. p. 325.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'In several of the Apennine mountains, and
particularly in those on the road from Bologna
to Florence, we find fires, or vapours which re∣quire
only the approach of a candle to inflame
them. . . .'</P>
<P>'The fires of Mount Cenida, near Pietramala,
are situated at different heights of the moun∣tain,
upon which we find four mouths that
throw out flames. . . . One of these fires is
in a circular place surrounded with a rising
ground. . . . Here the earth appears to be
burnt, and the stones are blacker than those
in the neighbourhood; there likewise issues,
here and there, a lively, blue, clear flame,
which rises from three to four feet high. . . .
But, beyond this circular space, we see no fire,
though the heat of the ground is perceptible
at the distance of sixty feet from the centre
of these flames. . . .'</P>
<P>'Along a fissure or crevice in the neighbour∣hood
of the fire, we hear a dull noise, like that of
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
wind moving through a subterraneous passage.
Near this place, we find two sources of hot
water. . . The ground, in which fire has long
existed, is neither depressed nor elevated. . .
Near this fire we see no volcanic stones, nor
any mark which indicates that fire has ever
been thrown out. However, some little hills
in the neighbourhood have every appearance
of having been formed, or at least changed
by volcano's. . . . In 1767, succussions of an
earthquake were felt in the environs; but
no change was produced on the fire, neither
was the smoke increased or diminished. . .'</P>
<P>'About ten leagues from Modena, at a
place called <HI>Barigazzo,</HI> there are five or six

the unequivocal vestiges of extin∣guished
volcano's which subsist in most of these

volcano's forming, because they never throw
out any volcanic matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m sur le Pétrole, par M. Fougeroux de Banderoy, dans ceux de l'Acad. des sciences, aunée 1770, p. 45.</NOTE>.'</P>

When subterraneous fires exist near strata of
coal, they dissolve the coal, and give rise to most
sources of bitumen: They likewise occasion the
heat of the hot springs which run in their

now burn with tranquility; and we only recog∣nise
their ancient explosions by the substances
they have formerly rejected. They ceased to act
when the sea retired from them; and, as already
remarked, I believe there is no longer any rea∣son

that the sea will always retire farther and

<P>To what we have said on the subject of vol∣cano's,
we shall add some remarks on the mo∣tion
of lavas, and on the time necessary for
their cooling and their conversion into vegeta∣ble
soil.</P>
<P>The lava which runs from the foot of the e∣minences
formed by the matters rejected by the
volcano, is an impure glass in fusion. It is a
tenacious, viscous, and half fluid substance.
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
Hence the torrents of this vitrified matter, when
compared to torrents of water, run slowly; and
yet they often proceed to great distances. In
these torrents of fire, however, there is another
movement than what takes places in those of
water: This movement tends to elevate the
whole running mass, and is produced by the ex∣pansive
force of the heat in the interior parts of
the burning torrent. The external surface cools
first; the liquid fire continues to run below;
and, as heat acts equally on all sides, the fire,
which endcavours to escape, elevates the superior
parts that are already consolidated, and often
forces them to rise perpendicularly. This is the
origin of those large masses of lava in the form
of rocks, which are found in the course of al∣most
every torrent where the declivity is not
great. By the efforts of this internal heat, the
lava makes frequent explosions; its surface opens,
and the liquid matter springs up and forms those
masses which we see elevated above the level of
the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent. Le P. de la Torré, I believe, is the
first person who observed this internal movement
of burning lavas, which is always more violent
in proportion to their thickness and the gentle∣ness
of the declivity. This effect is common to
all matters liquified by fire, and every man may
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> examples of it in our common founderies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lava of iron founderies exhibits the same effects. When this vitreous matter runs slowly, and accumulates at the base, we see eminences arise, which are bubbles or concave hemispheres of glass. These bubbles increase, when the ex∣pansive force is great, and the matter has little fluidity: It then suddenly explodes into a flame, and makes a considerable report. When the liquified matter is sufficiently adhesive to suffer a great dilatation, these superficial bubbles acquire a volume of eight or ten inches in diameter, without breaking. When the vitrification is less complete, and the matter is vis∣cous and tenaceous, the bubbles are smaller, and in cooling form concave eminences called <HI>toad's eyes.</HI> What happens in miniature in our sounderies, is likewise exhibited upon a larger scale in the lavas of volcano's.</NOTE>.
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
If we observe those large ingots or masses of
melted iron, which run in a mould or canal with
a very small declivity, we shall perceive that
they have a tendency to rise like arches, especi∣ally
when the stream is very thick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have not mentioned some particular causes which fre∣quently produce a curvature or swelling in our melted ingots: For example, when the matter is not very fluid, or when the mould is too moist, the ingots bend considerably; because these causes concur in augmenting the effect of the first. Thus the humidity of the ground, on which the torrents of lava descend, and the internal heat concur in raising the mass, and in producing explosions, which are always accompanied with those jets of matter formerly mentioned.</NOTE>. We have
formerly shewn, by experiments, that the time
of consolidation is always proportioned to the
thickness of the ingots, and that, when their sur∣faces
are hardened, the interior parts still conti∣nue
to be liquid. It is this internal heat which
elevates the ingots and makes them blister. If
their thickness were greater, there would be pro∣duced,
as in the torrents of lava, explosions, rup∣tures
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
in the surface, and perpendicular jets of
metallic mater pushed out by the action of the
fire inclosed in the interior parts of the
ingots. This explication, drawn from the na∣ture
of the thing itself, leaves no doubt concer∣ning
the origin of those eminences so frequent
in valleys and plains, which have been over-run
or covered with lava.</P>
<P>When, after descending from the mountain
and traversing the fields, the burning lava ar∣rives
at the margin of the sea, its course is sud∣denly
interrupted, the torrent advances, and,
like a powerful enemy, makes the water at first
retire: But the water by its immensity, by the
resistance of its cold, and by its power of arrest∣ing
and extinguishing fire, soon consolidates
the torrent of burning matter, which can now
proceed no farther, but rises up, accumulates
new strata, and forms a perpendicular wall,
from the top of which the lava falls and applies
itself to the face of the wall thus formed. It is
this falling and arresting of the burning matter
that gives rise to bataltic prisms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I shall not here inquire into the origin of the term <HI>basalt,</HI> which M. Desmarets of the academy of Sciences, a learned na∣turalist, believes to have been applied by the ancients to different kinds of stones; but shall limit myself to the <HI>basaltic lava,</HI> which appears under the form of prismatic columns.</NOTE> and their joint∣ed
columns▪ These prisms have generally five,
six, or seven sides, sometimes only three or four,
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
and sometimes eight or nine. The basaltic co∣lumns
are formed by the perpendicular fall of
the lava into the sea, whether it falls from high
rocks on the shore, or from a wall raised by its
own accumulations. In both cases, the cold
and humidity of the water arrest the burning
matter, and consolidate its surfaces the moment
it falls; and the successive bundles or masses of
lava apply themselves to each other. As the in∣ternal
heat of these masses tends to dilate them,
a reciprocal resistance is created; and the same
effect is produced as happens in the swelling of
pease, or rather of cylindrical grain, when squeez∣ed
in a close vessel filled with boiling water.
Each of these grains would assume a hexagonal
figure by reciprocal compression. In the same
manner, each bundle or mass of lava assumes se∣veral
sides by dilatation and reciprocal resistance;
and, when the resistance of the surrounding
bundles is stronger than the dilatation of the
bundle surrounded, instead of becoming hexa∣gonal,
it has only three, four, or five sides.
But, if the dilatation of the surrounded bundle
is stronger than the resistance of the surrounding
bundles, it assumes seven, eight, or nine sides,
which are always longitudinal.</P>
<P>The transverse articulations of these prisma∣tic
columns are produced by a cause still more
simple: The bundles of lava f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll not in a regu∣lar
and continued stream, nor in equal masses.
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
Hence, if there are intervals in the fall of the
matter, the superior surface of the forming co∣lumn
being partly consolidated, is hollowed
by the weight of the succeeding mass, which
then moulds itself into a convex form in the con∣cavity
or depression of the first. This is the
productive cause of those joints or articulations
which appear in the greater part of prismatic co∣lumns.
But, when the lava falls in an unin∣terrupted
stream, then the basaltic column is
one continued mass, without any articulations.
In the same manner, when, by an explosion,
some detached masses are darted from the torrent
of lava, these masses assume a globular or ellipti∣cal
figure, and are even sometimes twisted like
cables. To this simple explication, all the forms
of basalts and figured lavas may be easily re∣ferred.</P>
<P>It is to the rencounter of lava with the waves,
and its sudden consolidation, that the origin of
these bold coasts, which border all the seas at
the foot of volcanic mountains, is to be ascri∣bed.
The ancient ramparts of basalt found
in the interior parts of continents, show that the
sea has been in the neighbourhood of these vol∣cano's
when they had thrown out lava. This
is an a ditional proof of the ancient abode of the
waters upon all the lands now inhabited.</P>
<P>The torrents of lava are from a hundred to
two and three thousand fathoms broad, and
sometimes one hundred and fifty, and even two
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
hundred feet thick: And, as we have found by
experience, that the time of the cooling of
glass is to that of the cooling of iron as
132 to 236, and that the times of their re∣spective
consolidation are nearly in the same
proportion, it is easy to infer, that, to consoli∣date
the thickness of ten feet of glass or lava,
201 21/59 minutes would be necessary, since it
requires 360 minutes to consolidate ten feet
thick of iron, consequently it will require
4028 minutes, or 67 hours 8 minutes,
to consolidate 200 feet thick of lava: By the
same rule we shall find, that 30 days 17/24, or
a month, will be requisite before the surface of
this lava of two hundred feet thick be sufficiently
cold to admit of being touched. Hence a year
will be necessary to cool a lava of two hundred
feet thick, so as to admit of being touched, with∣out
burning, at the depth of one foot; and, at
ten feet deep, it will be still so warm, at the end
of ten years, as not to be tangible; and a hun∣dred
will be requisite to cool it to the same
degree in the middle of its thickness. Mr
Brydone relates, that, more than four years af∣ter
the lava had flowed, in the year 1766, at the
foot of Aetna, it was not perfectly cool. Massa,
a Sicilian author worthy of credit, tells us,
'that, being at Catania, eight years after the
great eruption in 1669, he found, that the
lava in several places was not entirely
cool<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage an Sicile, tom. 1. p. 213.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223"/>
About the end of April 1771, Sir William
Hamilton dropt pieces of dry wood into a cre∣vice
in the lava at Vesuvius, and they were in∣stantly
inflamed: The lava issued from the
mountain on the 19th of October 1767, and
had no communication with the fire of the vol∣cano.
The place where this experiment was
made, was at least four miles distant from the
mouth from which the lava issued. He is firm∣ly
persuaded, that many years are necessary to
cool a lava of this thickness (about 200 feet).</P>
<P>I have had no opportunity of making experi∣ments
upon consolidation and cooling, but with
balls of some inches in diameter. The only
method of making experiments on a larger scale
would be, to observe lavas, and to compare the
times exhausted in their consolidation and cool∣ing,
according to their different thicknesses. I am
satisfied that these observations would confirm
the law I have established for the cooling of
bodies from the state of fusion to the common
temperature; and although these new observa∣tions
are by no means necessary to support my
theory, still they would help to fill up that im∣mense
gap between a cannon-ball and a pla∣net.</P>
<P>It now remains for us to examine the nature
of lava, and to show, that, in time, it is convert∣ed
into fertile earth; which recals the idea of
the first conversion of the scoriae of the primi∣tive
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
glass that covered the whole surface of
the globe after its consolidation.</P>
<P>'Under the denomination of lava, we com∣prehend
not,' says M. de la Condamine, 'all
the matter thrown out by a volcano, such
as ashes, pumice-stones, gravel, and sand; but
solely those reduced to a liquid state by the
action of fire, and which, by cooling, form
solid masses, whose hardness surpasses that
of marble. This restriction notwithstanding,
many other species of lava may be conceived,
according to the different degrees of fusion
in the mixture, the greater or smaller quanti∣ty
of metal, and its greater or lesser intimate
union with the various matters. Beside many
intermediate kinds, three species are easily
distinguishable. The purest lava resembles,
when polished, a stone of an obscure dirty
gray colour. It is smooth, hard, heavy, and
interspersed with small particles similar to
black marble, and whitish points. It seems
to contain metallic particles. At first sight,
it resembles serpentine, when the colour of
the lava does not tend to green. It re∣ceives
a pretty fine polish, which is more
or less vivid in different parts. It is made
into tables, chimney-pieces, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>'The coarsest kind of lava is rugged and un∣even.
It resembles the scoriae or dross of
iron. The most common species holds a
middle rank between the two extremes:
<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
It is that which we every where find in large
masses upon the sides of Vesuvius and in
the adjacent fields, where it has run in torrents.
In cooling, it has formed masses similar to
ferruginous and rusty rocks, which are often
many feet thick. These masses are frequent∣ly
interrupted and covered with ashes and
calcmed matter. . . . . It is under several
alternate strata of lava, ashes, and earth, the
whole of which forms a crust of from 60
to 80 feet thick, that temples, porticos, sta∣tues,
a theatre, and an entire city have been
discovered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de. l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1757, p. 374.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>M. Fougeroux de Bondaroy remarks, 'that,
immediately after an eruption of burnt earth
or of a kind of ashes, Vesuvius generally
throws out lava, which runs down the sissures
or surrows made in the mountain. . .'</P>
<P>'The mineral matter inflamed, melted, and
flowing, or lava properly so called, issues through
cracks or crevices with more or less impetu∣osity,
and in greater or smaller quantity, accor∣ding
to the violence of the eruption. It spreads
to a greater or smaller distance, according to
the degree of fluidity, and the declivity of the
mountain, which more or less retards its cool∣ing. . .'</P>
<P>'That which now covers a part of the land
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
at the foot of the mountain, and which some∣times
stretches as far as Portici, consists of
large heavy masses, bristled with points on
their upper surface. The surface which rests
on the ground is flatter: As these pieces lie
above each other, they have some resemblance
to the waves of the sea. When the pieces are
larger and more numerous, they assume the
figure of rocks. . .'</P>
<P>'In cooling, the lava affects various forms. .
The most common is that of tables or boards
of greater or smaller dimensions. Some pie∣ces
are six, seven, and eight feet long. It
breaks into this form in cooling and consoli∣dating.
This is the species of lava which is
bristled with points. . .'</P>
<P>'The second species resembles great ropes:
It is always found near the mouth of the
volcano, and appears to have been suddenly
fixed, and to have rolled before it hardened.
It is lighter, more brittle, more bituminous,
and softer, than the first species. By break∣ing
it, we likewise perceive that its substance
is not so close and compact. . .'</P>
<P>'At the top of the mountain, we find a third
species of lava, which is brilliant, and com∣posed
of threads which sometimes cross one an∣other.
It is coarse, and of a reddish violet co∣lour.
. . . Some fragments are sono∣rous,
and have the figure of stalactites. . .
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
Lastly, in certain parts of the mountain, we
find lavas of a spherical form, and appear to have
been rolled. It is easy to conceive how the
figures of these lavas might be varied by a
number of accidental circumstances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'acad. des Sciences, anneé 1766 p. 75.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>Matter of every kind enters the composition
of lavas. Iron and a small quantity of copper
have been extracted from the lava found on the
summit of Vesuvius. Some specimens are so im∣pregnated
with metallic substances as to preserve
the flexibility of metal. I have seen two large
tables of lava of two inches thick, which were
polished like marble, and bended with their
own weight. I have seen others, which were
bended by a weight, and resumed their hori∣zontal
position by their own elasticity.</P>
<P>All lavas, when reduced to pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, are, like
gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, susceptible of being converted, by the
intervention of water, first into clay, and after∣wards,
by the mixture of dust and corrupted
vegetables, into excellent soil. These facts are
apparent from the vast and beautiful forests
which surround Aetna, and grow upon a
bottom of lava covered with several feet of
good earth: The ashes are more quickly con∣verted
into earth than the powder of glass or of
lava. In the craters of old extinguished vol∣cano's,
as well as on the ancient rivers of lava,
we find very fertile soils. Hence the deva∣stations
occasioned by volcano's are limited by
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
time; and, as Nature is always more disposed
to produce than to destroy, she, in a few ages,
repairs the devastations of fire, and restores
to the earth its former fertility by the very
same materials she had employed for the pur∣poses
of destruction.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITIONS to the Article, Of Caverns,
Vol. I. p. 442.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Caverns formed by the Primitive Fire.</HEAD>
<P>IN my theory of the Earth, I mentioned on∣ly
two kinds of caverns, the one produced
by the fire of volcano's, and the other by the
motion of subterraneous waters. Those two
species of caverns are not situated at great depths.
They are even new, when compared with those
vast cavities, which were formed at the time the
globe first assumed a solid form; for, at this pe∣riod,
all the supersicial eminences and hollows,
and all the cavities in the interior parts of the
earth, especially near the surface, were produced.
Several of those caverns produced by the primi∣tive
sire, after being supported for some time,
have afterwards split by cooling, which diminish∣es
the volume of every kind of matter; these
would soon fall in, and, by their sinking, form
basins or reservoirs for the sea, into which the
waters, formerly much elevated above this level,
ran, and abandoned the lands which they origi∣nally
<PB N="223" REF="230"/>
covered. It is more than probable, that
a certain number of these ancient caverns still
subsist in the interior parts of the globe, and by
their sinking may produce similar effects, and
give rise to new receptacles to the waters. In
this case, they will partly abandon the basin
which they now occupy, and run, by their na∣tural
propensity, into these lower places. For
example, we find beds of sea shells in the Pyren∣nees
1500 fathoms above the present level of
the ocean. Hence it is certain, that the waters,
when these shells were formed, rose 1500 fa∣thoms
higher than they do at present. But,
when the caverns, which supported the lands
that are now the bed of the Atlantic ocean,
sunk, the waters which covered the Pyrennees
and the whole of Europe would run with rapi∣dity
into these reservoirs, and, of course, leave
uncovered all the lands in this part of the world.
The same revolution would extend to every o∣ther
country. The waters appear to have ne∣ver
reached the summits of the highest moun∣tains;
because they exhibit no relicks of marine
productions, and no sufficient marks of a long
abode of the waters. However, as some of the
matters of which they are composed, though all
of the vitrescent kind, seem to have derived
their solidity and consistence from the interven∣tion
and cement of water, and as they appear
to have been formed, as already remarked, in
<PB N="224" REF="231"/>
the masses of sand, or glass dust, which former∣ly
lay on the peaks of mountains, but which,
in the progress of time, have been carried down
to their bottoms by the rains, we cannot pro∣nounce
positively, that the waters of the sea ne∣ver
stood higher than the places where shells are
now found: The waters have perhaps stood
much higher, even before their temperature
permitted the existence of shells. The greatest
height reached by the universal ocean is to us un∣known.
But we know that the waters were ele∣vated
from 1500 or 2000 fathoms above their
present level; since shells are found in the
Pyrennees at 1500 hundred fathoms, and in the
Cordelieres at 2000.</P>
<P>If all the peaks of mountains were formed of
solid glass, or of other matters immediately pro∣duced
by fire, it would be unnecessary to have
recourse to the abode of the waters, or to any
other cause, in order to conceive how they as∣sumed
their consistence. But most peaks of
mountains seem to be composed of matters,
which, though vitrifiable, have acquired their so∣lidity
by the intervention of water. We cannot,
therefore, determine whether their consistence
is solely owing to the primitive fire, or whe∣ther
the intervention and cement of water were
not requisite to complete the operation of fire, and
to bestow on these vitrifiable masses the qualities
which they possess. Besides, this supposition
<PB N="225" REF="232"/>
prevents not the primitive fire, which at first
produced the greatest inequalities on the globe,
from being the chief cause of those chains of
mountains that traverse its surface, and particu∣larly
of their cores or nuclei; but the contours
of these same mountains have perhaps been dis∣posed
and fashioned by the waters at a subse∣quent
period; for it is upon these contours, and
at certain heights, that shells and other produc∣tions
of the sea are found.</P>
<P>To acquire a clear notion of the ancient ca∣verns
formed by the primitive fire, we must
suppose the globe to be deprived of all its wa∣ters,
and of all the matters which cover its sur∣face,
to the depth of ten or twelve hundred
feet. By removing in idea this external bed of
earth and water, the globe will present to us the
form it possessed about the time of its first con∣solidation.
The whole mass was composed of
vitreous rock, or, if you will, of melted glass;
and this matter, in cooling and acquiring con∣sistence,
produced, like all other melted bodies,
eminences, depressions, and cavities, upon the
whole surface of the globe. These internal ca∣vities
formed by fire, are the primitive caverns,
and they are more numerous in the southern
than in the northern regions; because the rota∣tory
motion, which elevated the equatorial re∣gions
before consolidation, likewise produced
the greatest derangement of the matter, and, by
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
retarding the consolidation, would concur with
the action of the fire in giving rise to a greater
number of inequalities in this than in any other
part of the globe. The waters coming from
the Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es could not approach those burning re∣gions
before they cooled. The vaults which
supported these regions having successively fal∣len
in, the surface sunk and broke in a thousand
places. For this reason, the greatest inequali∣tie
of the globe are found in the equatorial re∣gions:
There the primitive caverns are more
numerous than in any other part of the earth.
They are likewise more profound, <HI>i. e.</HI> perhaps
five or six leagues deep; because the matter of
the globe, while in a liquid state, was agitated
to that depth by the motion of rotation. But
all the caverns in high mountains derive not
their origin from the operation of primitive fire.
Those alone which are deeply situated below the
mountains can be ascribed to this cause. The
more exterior and more elevated have been form∣ed,
as already remarked, by the operation of
secondary causes. Hence the globe, deprived
of its waters and the matters transported by
them, would present to us a surface much more
irregular than it appears with the aid of this co∣vering.
The great chains of mountains and
their peaks and ridges, have not now the ap∣pearance
of half of their real height. The
whole are att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed by their bases to a vitrifiable
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
rock, and are of the same nature. Thus we
should reckon three species of caverns produced
by Nature: The first by the force of the primi∣tive
fire; the second by the action of water;
and the third by that of subterraneous fires:
Each of these caverns, though different in their
origin, may be distinguished by examining the
matters they contain, or by which they are sur∣rounded.</P>

<HEAD>Of the sinking and derangement of certain Lands.</HEAD>
<P>THE rupture of caverns, and the action of
sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erraneous fires, are the chief causes of
the great revolutions which happen in the earth;
but they are often produced by smaller causes.
The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ation of the water, by diluting the clay,
upon which almost all calcarious mountains rest,
has frequently made those mountains incline
and tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble down. Or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se remarkable events I
shall subjoin some examples.</P>
<P>'In the year 1757,' says M. Perronet, 'a part
of the ground situated about half-way before
we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rive at the Castle of Croix-fontaine, o∣pened
in many places, and successively tum∣bled
down. The terrace wall, which inclosed
this ground, was overturned, and the road,
which was formerly at the foot of the wall,
was obliged to be carried to a considerable di∣stance.
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
. . . . This ground rested upon a base
of inclined earth.' This learned and chief
engineer of our highways and bridges mentions
another accident of the same kind which happen∣ed,
in the year 1733, at Pardines, near Issoire in
Auvergne. The ground, for about 400 fa∣thoms
in length by 300 in breadth, descend∣ed
upon a pretty distant meadow, with all its
houses, trees, and herbage. He adds, that con∣siderable
portions of ground are sometimes trans∣ported
either by the rupture of reservoirs of wa∣ter,
or by the sudden melting of snows. In
1757, at the village of Guet, about ten leagues
from Grenoble, on the road to Briançon, the
whole ground, which lies on a declivity,
slipt and descended in an instant towards Drac,
which is about a mile distant. The earth split
in the village, and the part which moved off
was six, eight, and nine feet lower than its
former station. This ground was situated on a
pretty solid rock, which was inclined to the
horizon about forty degrees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1769, p. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To these examples I shall add another fact, of
which I have been a constant witness, and which
has cost me a considerable expence. The de∣tached
rising ground, upon which the town and
old castle of Montbard are situated, is elevated
140 feet above the level of the river, and its
most rapid descent is to the north-cast. This
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
rising ground is crowned with calcarious rocks,
the strata of which, when taken together, are
54 feet thick. They every where rest upon a
mass of clay, which, of course, before reaching
the level of the river, is 86 feet thick. My
garden, which is surrounded with several ter∣races,
is situated on the top of this rising ground.
From twenty-five to twenty-six fathoms of the
last terrace-wall on the north-east side, where the
declivity is greatest, gave way all at once, carrying
along the inferior ground which would have
gradually descended to the level of the ground
near the river, if its progressive motion had not
been prevented by taking down the whole wall.
This wall was seven feet thick and founded on
clay. The movement of the earth was very
slow: I perceived that it was evidently occa∣sioned
by the insinuation of water. All the
water which falls upon the platform on the top
of this rising ground, penetrates through the fis∣sures
of the rocks, and reaches the clay upon
which they rest: Of this fact we are ascertain∣ed
by two wells dug from the top of the rock
to the clay. All the rain-water, therefore, which
falls upon this platform and the adjacent terraces,
collect upon the clay where the perpendicular
fissures of the rock terminate. The water gives
rise to small rills in different places, which are
rendered still more apparent by several wells dug
below the rocks. Wherever this mass of clay is
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
cut by ditches, we see the water filtrating from
above. It is not, therefore, surprising that walls,
however solid, should slip upon this first bed of
moist clay, if they are not founded much lower,
as I have done in rebuilding them. The same
thing, however, has happened on the north∣west
side, where the declivity is gentler, and no
rills of water appear. The clay had been re∣moved
at the distance of twelve or fifteen feet
from a great wall, of eleven feet thick, thirty-five
feet high, and twelve fathoms long. This wall
is constructed of good materials, and has subsist∣ed
more than nine hundred years. The cut
from which the clay was removed, though not
above four or five feet deep, has produced a
movement in this immense wall. It declines
from the perpendicular about fifteen inches, and
I could only prevent its downfall by abuttments
of seven or eight feet thick, and founded at the
depth of fourteen feet.</P>
<P>From these facts I drew the following con∣clusion,
which is not so interesting at present as
it would have been in ages that are past, that
there is not a castle or fortress situated upon
heights, which might not be easily tumbled into
the plain by a simple cut of ten or twelve feet
deep and some fathoms wide. This cut should
be made at a small distance from the last wall,
and upon that side where the declivity is greatest.
This method, of which the ancients never
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
dreamed, would have saved them the operation
of battering-rams and other engines of war;
and, even at present, might be employed, in
many cases, with advantage. I am convinced
by my eyes, that, when these walls slipt, if the
cut made for rebuilding them had not been
speedily filled with strong mason-work, the an∣cient
walls, and the two towers that have subsist∣ed
in good condition nine hundred years, and
one of which is 125 feet high, would have tum∣bled
into the valley, along with the rocks upon
which they are founded. As most of our hills
composed of calcarious stones rest upon a clay
base, the first strata of which are always more
or less moistened with the waters that filtrate
through the crevices of the rocks, it appears to
be certain, that, by exposing these moistened beds
to the air by a cut, the whole mass of rocks and
earth resting upon the clay would slip, and in a
few days tumble into the cut, especially during
wet weather. This mode of dismantling a for∣tress
is more simple than any hitherto invented;
and experience has convinced me that its success
is certain.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Turf.</HEAD>
<P>TO what I have formerly remarked concern∣ing
turf, I shall subjoin the following facts:</P>
<P>In the jurisdiction of Bergues-Saint-Winock,
Furnes, and Bourbourg, we find turf at three or
four feet below the surface. These beds of turf
are generally two feet thick, and are composed
of corrupted wood, of entire trees with their
branches and leaves, and particularly of filberds
which are known by their nuts, and the whole
is interlaced with reeds and the roots of plants.</P>
<P>What is the origin of these beds of turf, which
extend from Bruges through the whole flat coun∣try
of Flanders as far as the river Aa, between
the downs and the high country in the environs
of Bergues? &amp;c. In remote ages, when Flan∣ders
was only a vast forest, a sudden inundation
of the sea must have deluged the whole country,
and, in retiring, deposited all the trees, wood,
and twigs, which it had eradicated and destroyed
in this lowest territory of Flanders; and this e∣vent
must have happened in the month of Au∣gust
or September; because we still find the leaves
of trees, as well as nuts on the filberds. This
inundation must have taken place long before
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
that province was conquered by Julius Caesar,
since no mention is made of it in the writings
of the ancients<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour la subdelegation de Dunkerque, relativement à l'Hist. Nat. de ce canton.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the bowels of the earth, we sometimes
find vegetables in a different state from that of
common tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f. For example, in Mount Gane∣lon,
near Compeigne, we find, on one side of
the mountain, quarries of fine stones and the
fossil oysters formerly mentioned, and, on the
other side, we meet with a bed of the leaves of
all kinds of trees, and also reeds, the whole
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together and inclosed in mud. When
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are stirred, we perceive the same
mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y odour which we feel on the margin of
the sea; and these leaves preserve their odour
during several years. Besides, the leaves are
not destroyed; for we can easily distinguish
their species: They are only dry, and slightly
united to each other by the mud<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Leschevin à M. de Buffon; <HI>Compeigne,</HI> S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1772.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'We distinguish,' M. Guettard remarks,
two species of turf: The one is composed of
marine, and the other of terrestrial plants. We
suppose the first to have been formed when
the sea covered all those parts of the earth
which are now inhabited. The second is sup∣posed
to have been superinduced upon the for∣mer.
According to this system, it is imagined
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
that the currents carried the sea-plants into the
hollows formed by the mountains, which were
elevated above the waters, and, after being
tossed about by the waves, were deposited in
the hollows.'</P>
<P>'This origin of turf is not impossible: The
great quantity of sea-plants is sufficient to ac∣count
for the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aenomenon. The Dutch e∣ven
alledge, that the goodness of their turf is
owing to the bitumen with which the sea-water
is impregnated, and that they were form∣ed
by sea-weeds. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The turf-pits of Villeroy are situated in the
valley through which the river Essone runs;
and part of this valley extends from Roissy to
Escharcon. . . . . It is even near Roissy that
turfs were first dug. . . . . But those near
Escharcon are the best. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The meadows where turf is dug are open
and bad: They are filled with rushes, horse-tail,
and other plants which grow in bad soils.
These meadows are dug to the depth of eight
or ten feet. . . . . Next to the upper stratum,
there is a bed of turf about a foot thick, and
impregnated with river and land-shells. . . . .'</P>
<P>'This bed of turf filled with shells is com∣monly
earthy: Those which succeed are near∣ly
of the same thickness, and are always better
as we descend. These turfs are of a blackish
brown colour, intermixed with reeds, rushes,
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
and other plants. We see no shells in these
beds. . . . .'</P>
<P>'In masses of turf we sometimes find the
stems of willow and poplars, and sometimes
the roots of these and similar trees. On the
Escharcon side, an oak was discovered at the
depth of nine feet. It was black and almost
corrupted. It crumbled into dust, after being
exposed to the air. Another was found, on the
Roissy side, between the soil and the turf, at
the depth of two feet. Near Escharcon, the
horns of a stag were found three or four feet

<HEAD>Of Subterraneous, Petrified, and Charred Wood.</HEAD>
<P>'IN the territories of the Duke of Sax-Co∣bourg,
which lie on the frontiers of Franco∣nia
and Saxe, and at some leagues from the
town of Cobourg, there were found, at a small
depth, whole trees so completely petrified, that
they were as beautiful and hard as agates.
Some specimens of them were given by the
Princes of Saxe to M. Schoepflin, who transmit∣ted
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
two of them to M. de Buffon for the royal
cabinet. Vases and other beautiful utensils
have been made of this petrified wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Schoepflin, <HI>Strasbourg, Sept.</HI> 24. 1746.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Wood in its natural state has likewise been
found at great depths. M. du Verny, an
officer of artillery, sent me some specimens of
it, accompanied with the following letter:
'The town of Fère, in the garrison of which I
am stationed, on the 15th of August 1753, or∣dered
a search to be made for water by means
of boring: At 39 feet below the surface, they
found a bed of marl, which they continued to
pierce for 121 feet: Hence, at the depth of
160 feet, they found, at two different trials,
the augre filled with marl, intermixed with
numerous fragments of wood, which every
person easily recognised to be oak. I send
you two specimens of this wood. During the
succeeding days operations, they continued to
find the same marl, but not so much mixed
with wood, as far as the depth of 210 feet,
where they ceased to bore<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Bresse du Verny; <HI>La Fère, Nov.</HI> 14. 1753.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'In the territory of Cobourg, which is a
branch of the house of Saxe, we find,' M. Jus∣ti
remarks, 'petrified wood of a prodigious
size. In the mountains of Misnia, entire trees
have been dug out of the earth, which were
converted into very fine agate. The Imperial
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
cabinet of Vienna contains many petrifications
of this kind. A great log of this wood was
sent to the same cabinet: The part which had
been wood was changed into a beautiful agate
of a grayish black colour; and, instead of bark,
the trunk was surrounded with a belt of fine
white agate. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The present Emperor wished that a method
of ascertaining the age of petrifactions might
be discovered. . . . . . He ordered his
ambassador at Constantinople to ask per∣mission
to take up from the Danube one of the
piles of Trajan's bridge, which is some miles
below Belgrade. This permission being grant∣ed,
one of the piles was drawn up, which it
was imagined would have been petrified by
the water. But, after such a lapse of time, it
was discovered that the process of petrifaction
had made very little progress. Though this
pile had remained in the Danube above 1600
years, the petrifaction had not proceeded above
three quarters of an inch, and even less. The
rest of the wood was very little altered, and
had only begun to be calcined.'</P>
<P>'If a just conclusion, with regard to all other
petrifactions, could be drawn from this single
fact, Nature would perhaps require fifty thou∣sand
years to change trees, of the size of those
found petrified in certain places, into stones.
But, in particular situations, many causes may
concur in hastening the process of petrifac∣tion. . . . .'</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="247"/>
'At Vienna there is to be seen a petrified
log, which was brought from the Carpathian
mountains in Hungary. Upon this log the
marks of the hatchet, which had been made
before its petrifaction, are distinctly visible;
and these marks are so little altered by the
change the wood has undergone, that we per∣ceive
they have been made by a small instru∣ment. . . . .'</P>
<P>'Besides, it appears that petrified wood is not
so rare as is commonly imagined; and that,
to discover it in many places, requires only
the nice eye of a naturalist. Near Mansfeld,
I saw a great quantity of petrified oak in a
place where many people daily pass, without
perceiving this phaenomenon. Some logs were
entirely petrified, and in these we distinctly
perceived the rings formed by the annual
growth, the bark, the place where they were
cut, and all the characters of oak-wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal étranger, <HI>mois d'Octobre</HI> 1756, <HI>p.</HI> 160.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>M. Clozier, who found different pieces of pe∣trified
wood upon the hills in the neighbour∣hood
of Etampes, and particularly on that of
Saint-Symphorien, imagined that these frag∣ments
might have proceeded from some petrifi∣ed
trunks in the mountains. He, therefore,
caused pits to be dug in a part of the mountain
of Saint-Symphorien that had been pointed out
to him. After digging several feet deep, he first
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
discovered a petrified root, which led him to the
trunk of a tree of the same species.</P>
<P>This root, from its extremity to its junction
with the trunk, was, says M. Clozier, five
feet in length; there were other five roots, but
not equally long. . . . .</P>
<P>The middling and small roots were not pe∣trified,
or at least their petrification was so
brittle, that they remained in the sand, where
the trunk was in the form of powder or ashes.
It is reasonable to think, that, when the process
of petrifaction was communicated to these roots,
they had been almost corrupted, and that the
ligneous parts of which they were compo∣sed,
being too much separated by petrifac∣tion,
could not acquire the degree of solidity
necessary to a genuine petrifaction. . . .</P>
<P>The thickest part of the trunk was near six
feet in circumference. Its length was three feet
ten inches, and its weight was from five to six
hundred pounds. The trunk, as well as the
roots, had all the appearance of wood, as the
bark, the inner rhind, the solid and corrupted
wood, the holes of large and small worms, and
even the excrements of these worms. All these
parts were petrified, but were not so solid and
hard as the ligneous body, which had been per∣fectly
found when the process of petrifaction
commenced. The ligneous body is converted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto a real flint of various colours, which strikes
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
fire with steel, and produces, after being struck
or rubbed, a very strong smell of sulphur. . . .</P>
<P>This petrified trunk was bedded in a hori∣zontal

<P>M. l'Abbé Mazéas, who discovered, at half a
mile from Rome, a quarry of petrified wood,
expresses himself in the following terms:</P>
<P>'This quarry of petrified wood forms a suc∣cession

shops by the appellation of <HI>colophanus.</HI> This
petrified wood is found in a soil similar to the

<P>M. du Monchau, a physician and expert na∣turalist,
has sent me, for the royal cabinet, a
<PB N="243" REF="250"/>
piece of petrified wood with the following hi∣storical
account:</P>
<P>'The piece of petrified wood, which I have
the honour of transmitting to you, was found
at the depth of more than 150 feet below the
surface. . . . Last year (1754) when digging
a pit in quest of coal, at Notre-Dame-au-bois,
a village situated between Condé, Saint-Amand,
Mortagne, and Valenciennes, we found, a∣bout
600 fathoms from Escaut, and after pas∣sing
three water-levels, first seven feet of
rock or hard stone called <HI>tourtia</HI> in the lan∣guage
of colliers; afterwards, when we ar∣rived
at a marshy earth, we found, at the depth
of 150 feet, as already remarked, the trunk of a
tree of two feet in diameter, which lay across
the pit, and, of course, we were prevented
from measuring its length. It rested upon a
large free-stone; and many pieces were cut
off from this trunk by the curious. The small
fragment I have the honour of sending you
was cut off from a specimen given to M. Lau∣rent,
a learned mechanic. . . .'</P>
<P>'This wood seemed rather to have been convert∣ed
into coal than petrified. How could a tree be
sunk so deep into the earth? Has the soil in
which the tree was found been formerly as low?
If that is the case, how could this soil be aug∣mented
150 feet? From whence did all this
earth proceed?'</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251"/>
'The seven feet of <HI>tourtia</HI> observed by M.
Laurent, which exists also in all the coal-mines
for ten leagues round, have, according to the
above supposition, been produced posterior to
this accumulation of earth.'</P>
<P>'I leave this matter, Sir, to your decision:
You are so intimately acquainted with Nature,
that none of her mysteries can be long conceal∣ed
from you; and I have no doubt that you
will be able to explain this wonderful phae∣nomenon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Dumonchau à M. de Buffon; <HI>Douai, Jan.</HI> 29. 1755.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>M. Fougeroux de Bondaroy, of the Royal
Academy of Sciences, relates several facts
concerning petrified wood, which merit atten∣tion.</P>
<P>'All the fibrous stones,' he remarks, 'which
have some resemblance to wood, are not petri∣fied
wood. But there are many others which
must be recognised as such, especially if we at∣tend
to the peculiar organization of vege∣tables. . . . .'</P>
<P>'Facts are not wanting to prove that wood
may be converted into stone, with as much
ease at least as several other substances which
incontestibly undergo this transmutation. But
it is difficult to explain how this effect is pro∣duced.
I hope I may be permitted to hazard
some conjectures on the subject, which I shall'
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
'endeavour to support by facts and observa∣tions.'</P>
<P>'We find wood which may be considered as
only half petrified, and not much heavier than
common wood. Specimens of this kind are
easily divided into plates, or even into fila∣ments,
like certain corrupted timber. Others
are more petrified, and have the weight, the
hardness, and the opacity of free-stone. O∣thers,
whose petrifaction is still more perfect,
admit the same polish as marble; while others
acquire that of fine oriental agates. I have an
excellent specimen sent from Martinico to M.
du Hamel, which is converted into a most
beautiful sardonix. Lastly, we find wood
changed into slate. Among these specimens,
there are some which have retained the orga∣nization
of wood so completely, that we dis∣cover
with a lens every appearance exhibited
in unpetrified wood.'</P>
<P>'We have seen some specimens encrusted
with a sandy iron ore, and others penetrated
with a substance which, being composed of sul∣phur
and vitriol, makes them approach the
state of pyrites. Some of them are, if we
may use the expression, larded with a very
pure iron ore; and others are traversed by
veins of very black agate.'</P>
<P>'We find pieces of wood, one part of which
is converted into a stone, and the other into
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
agate: The part converted into stone is ten∣der;
but the other has the hardness peculiar
to precious stones.'</P>
<P>'But, how should certain pieces, though con∣verted
into hard agate, preserve the distinct
characters of organization, as the concentric
circles, the insertions, the extremities of the
tubes destined to transmit the sap, the bark,
the inner rhind, and the wood? If the vege∣table
substance were entirely destroyed, we
should only see an agate, without any of the
organic characters formerly mentioned. To
preserve this appearance of organization, if we
suppose that the wood subsists, and that the
pores alone are filled with the petrifying juice,
it should appear, that the vegetable parts might
be extracted from the agate. But I could ne∣ver
make any progress in this operation: I,
therefore, think, that the specimens in question
retain no parts which have preserved the na∣ture
of wood. To give perspicuity to my i∣dea,
I beg the reader to recollect, that, when
a piece of wood is distilled in a retort, the coal
which remains after distillation is not a sixth
part of the original weight of the wood.
When this coal is burnt, we obtain only a
small quantity of ashes, which will still dimi∣nish
after the lixivial salts are abstracted.'</P>
<P>'This small quantity of ashes being the only
fixed part, the chemical analysis proves, that
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
the fixed parts of a piece of wood are really
very trifling, and that the greatest portion of
vegetable matter is destructible, and may be
gradually carried off, as the wood corrupts.'</P>
<P>'Now, if we consider that the greater part of
the wood is destroyed, and that what remains
is a light earth, and easily permeable by the
petrifying juice, its conversion into stone, a∣gate,
or sardonix, will not be more difficult to
conceive than that of bole, clay, or any other
earth. The only difference is, that the vege∣table
earth preserves the appearance of organi∣zation,
and the petrifying juice insinuates into
its pores, without destroying its original cha∣racters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1759, p. 431.—452.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Some facts and observations remain still to
be added. In August 1773, at Montigni-sur-Braine,
in the district of Challon and jurisdic∣tion
of Auxonne, when digging a copper mine,
the workmen, at the depth of 33 feet, found a
tree lying on its side; but the species of it could
not be discovered. The superior strata seemed
to have never been touched by the hand of
man; for, below the soil, there was a bed of 8
feet of clay; then 10 feet of sand; then a bed
of fullers earth about 6 or 7 feet; then another
bed of the same mixed with stones; and, lastly,
a bed of black sand of 3 feet. The tree was
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
found in the fullers earth. The river Braine
is to the east, and not above a gun-shot from
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s place. It runs in a meadow 80 feet lower
than the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the copper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettre de Mad. la Comtesse de Clermont-Montoison <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. de Grignon informed me, that, on the
borders of the Marne, near St Dizier, there is
a bed of pyritous wood, the organization of
which is apparent. This bed is situated under
a stratum of free-stone, which is covered with
a stratum of pyrites, and above the pyrites is a
stratum of lime-stone. The bed of pyritous wood
lie upon a blackish clay.</P>
<P>He likewise found, in the pits dug for disco∣vering
the subterraneous town of Châtelet, in∣struments
of iron with wooden handles. He
remarked that this wood was converted into a
genuine iron-ore of the hematites species. The
organization of the wood was not destroyed;
but it was brittle, and its whole texture was as
close as that of the hematites. These iron in∣struments
with wooden handles had been buried
in the earth sixteen or seventeen hundred years.
The conversion of the wood into hematites had
been affected by the decomposition of the iron,
which had gradually filled all the pores of the
wood.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Bones sometimes found in the interior parts of
the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>'IN the parish of Haux, which is situated
between two seas, and about half a league
from the port of Langoiran, a point of a rock,
of 11 feet high, detached itself from the coast,
which was formerly 30 feet high. By its fall
it spread over the valley a great quantity of a∣nimal
bones or fragments of bones, some of
which were petrified. That they are bones is
unquestionable; but it is difficult to ascertain the
animals to which they belong. The greatest
number consists of teeth; some of them perhaps
belong to the ox or horse; but, without marking
the difference in figure, most of them are larger
than the teeth of these animals. There are
likewise thigh or leg-bones, and a fragment
of a stag or elk's horn. The whole are cover∣ed
with common earth, and situated between
two strata of rock. We must suppose that the
carcasses of animals have been thrown into a
hollow rock, and, after the flesh had corrupt∣ed,
a rock of 11 feet high had been formed
above them, which would require the opera∣tion
of many ages. . . .'</P>
<P>'The Gentlemen of the Academy of Bour∣deaux,
who examined these bones with phi∣losophical
<PB N="250" REF="257"/>
accuracy, discovered, that, when a
number of fragments were put on a very
brisk fire, they were converted into a fine Tur∣quois
blue; and that some portions became so
hard, that, when cut by a lapidary, they re∣ceived
a fine polish. . . . It must also be re∣marked,
that bones which evidently belonged
to different animals were equally converted in∣to
Turquois<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1719, p. 24.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'On the 28th of January 1760,' says M. de
Guettard, 'there were found, 160 fathoms a∣bove
the mineral baths, bones included in a
rock with a gray surface. This rock was nei∣ther
laminated nor consisted of separate strata,
but was one continued mass of stone. . . .'</P>
<P>'After having, by means of gun-powder, pe∣netrated
five feet deep into this rock, we found
a great number of human bones belonging to
every part of the body, as jaw-bones with their
teeth, bones of the arms, thighs, limbs, ribs,
rotulae, &amp;c. jumbled together in the greatest
disorder. Entire skulls, or portions of them,
chiefly prevailed.'</P>
<P>'Beside these human bones, we met with
several fragments which could not be ascribed
to man. In some places, they are in conti∣nued
masses, and in other more dispersed. . .'</P>
<P>'When we arrived at the depth of four feet
and a half, we found six human heads in an
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
inclined position. In five of these heads, the
occiput with its appendages, except the bones
of the face, were preserved. This occiput was
partly encrusted with stone, its cavity was fill∣ed
with stone, and had assumed the same mould
or figure. In the sixth head, the face is en∣tire:
It is broad in proportion to its length.
We easily distinguish the form of the fleshy
cheeks. The eyes are shut, pretty long, but
narrow. The front is large, and the nose ve∣ry
flat, but well formed; the middle line is
distinguishable. The mouth is well made,
and shut; the upper lip is a little thick in pro∣portion
to the under. The chin is well pro∣portioned,
and the whole muscles are strongly
marked. The colour of the head is reddish,
and resembles those of the Tritons feigned by
painters. Its substance is similar to that of
the stone in which it was found; it is, proper∣ly
speaking, only the mask of the natural
head.'</P>
<P>The above relation was sent by M. le Baron
de Gaillard-Lonjumeau to Madame de Bois∣jourdain,
who transmitted it to M. Guettard, with
some specimens of the bones. That these bones
were really human, is a very doubtful point;
'for every appearance in this quarry,' M. de
Lonjumeau remarks, 'announces that it has
been formed of relicks of bodies broken in
pieces, and which had been long tossed about
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
by the waves of the sea before they were col∣lected
into one heap. As this mass of bones
lies horizontally, and has been successively co∣vered
with stony matter, it is easy to conceive
how a mask was formed on the faces of those
heads, the flesh having little time to corrupt, e∣specially
when the bodies were buried under the
water. We may, therefore, reasonably con∣clude,
that these heads were not human. . . .
They rather seem to be the heads of those fishes,
whose teeth are found in the same parts of
the stones along with the bones supposed to
belong to the human species.'</P>
<P>'It appears that the collection of bones in
the environs of Aix, are similar to those disco∣vered
some years ago by M. Borda near Dax
in Gascony. The teeth discovered at Aix, by
the description given of them, seem to resem∣ble
those found at Dax, of which an under
jaw is still preserved. This jaw unquestiona∣bly
belongs to a large fish. . . . I must, there∣fore,
conclude, that the bones in the quarry of
Aix are similar to those discovered at Dax;. .
and that these bones, whatever they are,
should be referred to the skeletons of fishes
rather than to those of man. . . .'</P>
<P>'One of the heads in question was about se∣ven
and a half inches long by three and some
lines broad. Its figure is that of an oblong
globe, flat at the base, thicker at the posterior
<PB N="253" REF="260"/>
than the anterior end, and divided in the broad∣est
part by seven or eight bands from seven
to twelve lines wide. Each band is likewise
divided into two equal parts by a slight fur∣row.
The bands extend from the base to the
summit. Those of one side are separated from
those of the other by another and deeper fur∣row,
which gradually enlarges from the ante∣rior
to the posterior part.'</P>
<P>'From this description we cannot recognize
the mould of a human head. The bones of
man's head are not divided into bands. The
human head is composed of four principal
bones, the figures of which appear not in the
mould above described. It has not an interior
crest which extends longitudinally from the
anterior to the posterior part, and divides it
into two equal parts, which might give rise to
the furrow on the superior part of the stony
mould.'</P>
<P>'These considerations induce me to think,
that this substance is rather the body of a nau∣tilus
than a human head. There are nautili
actually divided into bands or bucklers like this
mould. They have a channel or furrow which
runs along the whole curvature, and divides
them into two, from which the stony furrow
might derive its origin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1760, p. 209.—218.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261"/>
I am persuaded, as well as M. le Baron de
Lonjumeau, that these heads never belonged to
men, but to animals of the seal kind, to sea∣otters,
and to sea lions or bears. It is not at
Aix or Dax alone, that the heads and bones of
these animals are found in rocks and caverns.
His Highness the present Prince Marcgrave of
Anspach, who to great affability unites a re∣markable
taste for knowledge, has been so o∣bliging
as to give me, for the Royal Cabinet,
a collection of bones from the caverns of Gail∣lenrente
in his Marcgraviate of Bareith. M.
Daubenton has compared these bones with those
of the common bear, from which they differ
only by being larger. The head and teeth are
longer and thicker; and the muzzle is longer
and more protuberant than in our largest bears.
In this collection, with which this noble Prince
has enriched our cabinet, there is a head which
naturalists have denominated <HI>the head of M. de
Buffon's small seal</HI>; but, as we know not the form
and structure of the heads of sea lions, bears,
and large and small seals, we shall suspend our
judgment concerning the animals to which these
fossil bones have appertained.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITIONS to the Article, Of the
Changes of Sea into Land, Vol. I. p. 483.</HEAD>
<P>IN traversing the coasts of France, we perceive
that a part of Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tany, Picardy, Flanders, and
Lower Normandy, have very recently been de∣serted
by the sea; because, through all this ex∣tent
of country, we still find great quantities of
oysters, and other shells, in their natural state.
We are certain, from experience, that, for a cen∣tury
past, the sea has been retiring from the
coast of Dunkirk. When the moles of this port
were constructing in the year 1670, the fort of
Good-hope, which terminate one of these moles,
was built upon piles a great way beyond the
low water-mark. But, at present, the water
never advances nearer this fort than 300 fa∣thoms.
In 1714, when the new harbour of Mar∣dik
was deepening, the moles were likewise car∣ried
beyond the low water-mark; but now,
when the tide is ebb, there is a dry space of
more than 500 fathoms. If the sea continues
thus gradually to retire, Dunkirk, like Aigue∣mortes,
will, in a few centuries, be no longer a

<P>The bare inspection of Saintonge is sufficient
to convince us, that it was formerly covered by

of Aunis, which was anciently covered by the
sea and stagnant waters, is one of the most re∣cent
lands of France. It is even probable that
this territory was a morass about the end of the
fourteenth century<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Extrait de l'hist. de la Rochelle, art. 2. et 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that the ocean, during
some centuries, has retired many feet from all
our coasts; and if we examine those of the Me∣diterranean,
from Roussillon to Provence, we
shall find that this sea has likewise retreated
nearly in the same proportion. These facts
render it evident, that the circumference of all
the coasts of Spain and Portugal, as well as those
of France, is greatly extended. The same ob∣servation
has been made with regard to Sweden,
where some philosophers have conjectured, that,
in the course of 4000 years, the Baltic, the depth
of which exceeds not thirty fathoms, will be
totally abandoned by the waters.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264"/>
If similar observations were made in every
country, I am persuaded, that, in general, the
sea would be found to have retired from every
coast. The same causes which produced its first
retreat and successive sinking, are not absolutely
annihilated. In the beginning, the sea was two
thousand fathoms above its present level. The
immense swellings on the surface of the globe,
which first subsided, made the waters sink, at first
rapidly, and afterwards in proportion as the
more inconsiderable caverns gave way. The
sea, of course, was proportionally depressed; and,
as many caverns still exist, which must, from
time to time, sink, either by the action of vol∣cano's,
by the force of water, or by earthquakes,
we may with certainty predict, that the ocean
will continue to retire, and, consequently, that
the extent of all our continents will be gradual∣ly
augmented.</P>

<HEAD>FACTS AND ARGUMENTS
IN SUPPORT OF THE
COUNT DE BUFFON's
EPOCHS OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE treatise composed by the Count de
Buffon, under the title of <HI>Les Epoques de
la Nature,</HI> is exceedingly ingenious. It is in∣tended
to establish by facts and reasoning, his
theory of the formation of the Planets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. 1. p. 59. of this work.</NOTE>. But
as this theory, however it may be relished on
the Continent, is perhaps too fanciful to receive
the general approbation of the cool and delibe∣rate
Briton, the translator has been advised not
to render it into English. Many of the facts,
however, are too important to be omitted. In∣stead
of a regular translation, therefore, he shall
<PB N="259" REF="266"/>
give a generall view only of the positions laid
down in this treatise, together with the most in∣teresting
facts produced in support of these posi∣tions.</P>
<P>The Count de Buffon begins his subject with
a preliminary discourse, in which he endeavours
to unfold the different changes the terrestrial
globe has undergone from is first projection out
of the sun to the present time. In this discourse
the author observes the following order: 1. He
mentions such facts as may lead us to the origin
of Nature. 2. He marks those monuments
which ought to be regarded as the evidences of
the first ages. 3. He collects such traditions as
may convey some idea of the ages which succeed∣ed.
After which, says he, we shall endeavour
to connect the whole by analogies, and to form
a chain which, from the commencement of
time, shall descend to the present days.</P>

<PB N="261" REF="268"/>
<P>The first fact, namely, the elevation of the
globe at the Equator and its depression at the
poles, has been mathematically demonstrated and
physically proved by the theory of gravitation,
and by experiments with the pendulum. The
figure of the earth is precisely the same which a
fluid globe revolving round its axis with equal
celerity would assume. Hence the matter of
which the earth is composed was in a state of
fluidity the moment it assumed its form, and this
moment happened whenever it began to turn
round its own axis. Now, though heat is the
general cause of fluidity, since water itself, with∣out
heat, would form a solid mass, we have two
methods of conceiving the possibility of the pri∣mitive
fluid state of the earth. The first is the
solution of terrestrial matters in water; and
the second is their liquefaction by fire. But
most of the solid matters of which the earth is
composed are not soluble in water; and, at the
same time, the quantity of water, in proportion
to that of dry and solid matter, is so small, that
it is impossible the one could be dissolved by the
other. Of course, as this state of fluidity could
not be effected by dissolution or maceration in
water, this fluidity must have been produced by
the operation of fire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>This conclusion assumes a new degree of
probability from the second fact, and is ren∣dered
certain by the third. The internal heat
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>
of the globe, which still subsists partially, and
is greater than that afforded by the sun, shews
that this primitive fire is not yet nearly dissi∣pated.
The surface of the earth is colder
than its interior parts. Uncontrovertible and
reiterated experiments evince, that the whole
mass of the globe has a heat proper to itself,
and totally independent of that of the sun.
This heat is rendered evident by comparing
our winters with our summers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Suppl. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 1 <HI>part.</HI> 1. and particularly the two Me∣moirs <HI>sur la temperature des p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ètes,</HI> Suppl. tom. 2.</NOTE>; and it is
still more palpable when we penetrate into the
bowels of the earth. At equal depths, it is
invariably the same, and it appears to augment
in proportion as we descend.</P>
<P>'At no great depth, we perceive a heat which
never varies with the temperature of the
atmosphere We know, that the liquor of the
thermometer remains, during the whole year,
at the same height in the caves of the Observa∣tory,
which exceed not 84 feet or 14 fathoms
below the surface. Hence this point has
been fixed as the mean temperature of our
climate. This heat commonly continues
nearly the same from 14 or 15 to 60, 80, or
100 fathoms, more or less, according to cir∣cumstances,
as we experience in our mines.
Beyond this depth it augments, and some∣times
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
becomes so great, that the workmen
could not support it, if they were not cooled
by fresh air, either from air-pits, or from falls
of water. . . M. de Gensanne found, that,
in the mines of Giromagny, three leagues
from Béfort, when the thermometer was car∣ried
52 fathoms deep, it stood at 10 degrees,
as in the caves of the Observatory; that, at
106 fathoms, it stood at 10<SUP>•</SUP> degrees; that,
at 158 fathoms, it mounted to 15½ degrees;
and that, at 222 fathoms, it rose to 18⅙ de∣grees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dissert. sur la glace, par M. Mairan, p. 60.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'In proportion as we descend into the bow∣els
of the earth,' M. de Gensanne remarks,
we perceive a sensible increase of heat. 1800
feet below the level of the Rhine, at Hunin∣guen
in Alsace, I found, that the heat was so
great as to produce a sensible evaporation
from water.' A detail of my experiments on
'this subject may be seen in the last edition of
that excellent <HI>Traité de la glace</HI> composed
by my deceased illustrious friend M. Dortous
de Mairan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. de Languedoc, tom. 1. p. 24.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'All the rich veins of every species of me∣tal,'
says M. Eller, 'are in the perpendicular
fissures of the earth; and the depth of these
fissures cannot be ascertained. In Germany,
some of them have been traced above 6000
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
feet deep. In proportion as the miners de∣scend,
they feel that the temperature of the
air becomes always hotter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. sur la generation des metaux. Academie de Ber∣lin, ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e 1733.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Though our deepest mines and pits are
inconsiderable excavations; yet the internal
heat is more sensibly felt in them than on the
surface. We may, therefore, presume, that,
if we could penetrate still deeper, this heat
would increase, and that the parts near the
centre of the earth are hotter than those more
distant. This internal heat is likewise ap∣parent
from the temperature of the ocean,
the waters of which, at equal depths, ex∣hibit
nearly the same heat as that of the in∣terior
parts of the earth. 'Having plunged a
thermometer,' M. Marsigli remarks, 'into the
sea in different places and at different times,
it was found that the temperature at 10, 20,
30, and 120 fathoms, was equally from 10 to
10¾ degrees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L. Hist. physique de la mer par Marsigli, p. 16.</NOTE>'. On this subject M. de Mai∣ran
judiciously remarks, 'that the hottest wa∣ters
which are at the greatest depth, must, as
being the lightest, continually ascend above
those that are heavier. Hence, according to
Marsigli's observations, the temperature of this
immense body of water must be always near∣ly
equal, except near the surface, which is
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
exposed to the impressions of the air, where
the water sometimes freezes before it has time
to descend by its own weight and coolness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dissert. sur la glace, p. 69.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Besides, it is easy to show, that the fluidity of
the ocean ought not, in general, to be ascribed
to the powers of the solar rays; since we learn
from experience, that the light of the sun
does not penetrate the most limpid water above
six hundred feet; and, of course, that its heat
will not reach above a fourth part of that
depth, or one hundred and fifty feet. The
late M. Bouguer, a learned astronomer of the
Royal Academy of Sciences, found, that, when
sixteen pieces of common glass were applied
to each other, and making a thickness of 9½
lines, the light, in passing through these sixteen
pieces of glass, was diminished 247 times. He
then placed seventy-four pieces of the same
glass, in a tube, and at some distance from
each other. When this experiment was made,
the sun was 50 degrees above the horizon. A
very faint appearance of the sun's disk was still
perceptible through these 74 pieces of glass.
The persons who attended him could likewise
perceive, but with difficulty, a feeble light.
But, when other three pieces of glass were ad∣ded
to the seventy-four none of them could
distinguish the smallest vestige of light. Hence,
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
if we suppose eighty pieces of the same glass,
we have a thickness which will render it per∣fectly
opaque.</P>
<P>From this analogy between the transparency
of glass and water, M. Bouguer found, that, to
render sea-water, which is the most limpid of
all waters, perfectly opaque, a thickness of 256
feet is necessary, provided, by another experi∣ment,
the light of a flambeau was diminished
in the proportion of 14 to 5 in traversing 115
inches of water contained in a tube of 9 feet 7
inches in length. Hence, according to M. Bou∣guer,
no sensible light can pass deeper than 256
feet in water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ai d'Optique sur la gradation de la lumiére, p. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears to me, however, that the conclu∣sion
drawn by M. Bouguer is very distant from
the truth. His experiments should have been
made with masses of glass of different thick∣nesses,
and not with separate pieces applied to
each other. I am persuaded that the sun's
light would penetrate a greater thickness than
that of these eighty pieces, which formed a
thickness of no more than 47½ lines, or near 4
inches. Now, though these pieces he employ∣ed
were of common glass, it is certain that a
solid mass of the same glass, of four inches thick,
would not entirely intercept the light of the
sun, especially as I know, by my own experi∣ence,
that light passes easily through 6 solid
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
inches of white glass. I believe, therefore, that
the thicknesses assumed by M. Bouguer should
be more than doubled, and that the light of
the sun penetrates 600 feet deep into the waters
of the ocean; for there is another inaccuracy
in M. Bouguer's experiments. He did not
make the light of the sun pass through his tube
of 9 feet 7 inches long: He employed the
light of a flambeau, and thence concluded the
diminution to be in the proportion of 14 to 5.
But I am persuaded, that, if the light of the sun
had been employed, this diminution would not
have been so great, especially as the light of a
flambeau could only pass obliquely, whilst that
of the sun, by passing directly, would have pene∣trated
deeper by its incidence alone, independent
of its purity and intensity. Thus, taking all
circumstances into consideration, it appears, that,
to approach the truth as near as possible, we
should suppose, that the light of the sun pene∣trates
the sea to the depth of 600 feet, and that
its heat reaches 150 feet deep. The light and
heat must here be understood as sensible degrees
only of these qualities.</P>
<P>That the heat of the sun penetrates not above
150 feet deep in the waters of the ocean, I as∣certained
by analogy derived from an experi∣ment
which appears to be decisive. With a
lens of 27 inches diameter by six inches thick
at the centre, I perceived, that, by covering the
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
middle part, the lens burnt only from the cir∣cumference
as far as four inches thick, and that
all the thicker part scarcely produced any heat.
I then covered the whole lens, except an inch
round the centre, and I found, that, after pas∣sing
this thickness of six inches of glass, the
light of the sun had no influence on the thermo∣meter.
Hence I am warranted to presume, that
this same light, weakened by 150 feet thick of
water, would not produce a perceptible degree
of heat.</P>
<P>The light proceeding from the moon is un∣questionably
a reflected light of the sun. This
light, however, has no sensible heat, even when
the rays are collected into the focus of a burn∣ing-glass.
Neither would the light of the sun
have any heat, after passing through a certain
depth of water; because it would then be e∣qually
feeble as that of the moon I am, there∣fore,
persuaded, that, by allowing the rays of
the sun to pass through a large tube filled with
water, and only 50 feet long, which is no more
than a third of the depth I have supposed, this
feeble light would produce no effect upon the
thermometer, even though the liquor stood at
the freezing point. From whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may con∣clude,
that, though the light of the sun pene∣trates
600 feet in the waters of the ocean, its
heat would not reach one fourth part of that
depth. All the waters below this point would
<PB N="269" REF="276"/>
necessarily freeze, unless there was an internal
heat in the earth, which alone can maintain
their fluidity. In the same manner, it is proved
by experience that the heat of the solar rays pe∣netrates
not above 15 or 20 feet deep in the
earth, since ice is preserved at these depths du∣ring
the warmest summers. Hence, it is clear,
that, below the basin of the sea, as well as un∣der
the superior strata of the earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
perpetual emanation of heat, which supports <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
fluidity of the waters, and produces the tem∣perature
of the earth. In the interior parts of
the earth, therefore, a heat exists which is pro∣per
to it, and which is totally independent of
that communicated by the sun.</P>
<P>We might confirm this general fact by a num∣ber
of particular ones. Every man has remark∣ed,
that the snow melts in all places where the
vapours of the interior parts of the earth have
a free issue, as over pits, covered aqueducts,
vaults, cisterns, &amp;c. while in all other places,
where the earth, bound up by the frost, inter∣cepts
these vapours, the snow not only remains,
but, instead of melting, freezes. This circum∣stance
is alone sufficient to show, that these e∣manations
from the internal parts of the earth
have a real and sensible degree of heat.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>With regard to the <HI>fourth</HI> fact: After the sa∣tisfactory

<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
that the materials of which this globe is com∣posed
are of the nature of glass. This general
truth, which we can prove by experience, was
not altogether unknown to Leibnitz, a German

<P>The basis of minerals, of vegetables, and of
animals, consists of vitrifiable matter; for all
their <HI>residua</HI> may be ultimately converted into
<PB N="271" REF="278"/>
glass. The substances called <HI>refractory</HI> by chy∣mists,
and which they consider as not fusible, be∣cause
they resist the action of their furnaces
without being changed into glass, may notwith∣standing
be vitrified by the more intense heat of
burning glasses. Hence all the materials of this
globe, at least all those which are known to us,
have glass for their basis, and may be ultimately
reduced to their primitive state.</P>
<P>We have, therefore, proved the original li∣quefaction
by fire of the whole mass of this
globe, agreeably to the most rigorous rules of
logic: 1. <HI>A priori,</HI> by the first fact, namely, the
elevation of the earth at the equator, and its
depression at the poles. 2. <HI>Ab actu,</HI> by the
second and third fact, namely, the internal
heat of the globe which still subsists: 3. <HI>A po∣steriori,</HI>
by the fourth fact, which shows the ef∣fect
of this action of fire, <HI>i. e.</HI> glass in all terres∣trial
substances.</P>
<P>But, though the materials which compose this
globe have originally been of a vitreous nature,
and may all be reduced to glass, they ought to
be distinguished from each other with regard to
the different states in which they are found be∣fore
they are converted into glass by the action
of fire. They should, in the first place, be di∣vided
into vitrifiable and calcarious substances.
The first undergo no change by fire, unless it
be pushed to such a degree of intensity as is suf∣ficient
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
to reduce them to glass; but an inferior
degree of heat reduces the others to lime. The
quantity of calcarious substances, though very
considerable, is small when compared to those
which are vitrifiable. The <HI>fifth</HI> fact above laid
down proves, that calcarious bodies have been
formed at a different period, and by another ele∣ment;
and we evidently perceive, that all the
matters which have not been produced by the
immediate action of the primitive fire, have been
formed by the intervention of water; because
they are all composed of shells and other relicks
of marine bodies. Under the class of vitrifi∣able
substances are comprehended pure rock,
quartz, sand, free-stone, granite, slates, clays,
metals, and metallic minerals. These sub∣stances
form the genuine basis of the globe,
and compose its principal and greatest part. The
whole of them have been originally produced
by the primitive fire. Sand is nothing but glass
in powder; slates, dried clays, pure rock, free-stone,
and granite, are only vitreous masses, or vitri∣fiable
sand in a concreted form. Flints, cry∣stals,
metals, and most other minerals, are only
distillations, exudations, or sublimations of the
first matters, all of which unfold their primi∣tive
origin and their common nature, by their
aptitude of being converted into glass.</P>
<P>But calcarious sand and gravel, chalk, brown
free-stone, marble, alabastar, calcarious spatha,
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
both opaque and transparent, in a word, every
substance which can be converted into lime,
do not at first exhibit their original nature.
Though, like all the others, they proceed from
glass, calcarious bodies have passed through fil∣tres,
which have changed their appearance.
They have been formed by water. They are
composed entirely of madrepores, shells, and o∣ther
relicks of aquatic animals, which alone
are capable of converting fluids into solids, and
of transforming the water of the sea into stone.
Common marble and other calcarious stones are
composed of entire shells and fragments of shells,
of madrepores, astroites, &amp;c. all the parts of which
are either still evident, or easily recognisable.
Gravel is nothing but broken fragments of
marble and calcarious stones which frost and
the action of the air detach from the rocks;
and they are equally convertible into lime. Lime
may also be made of shells, chalk, and light
land-stone. Alabaster, and those marbles which
contain alabaster, may be regarded as large
stalacti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which are formed at the expence of
other marbles and common stones. Calcarious
spatha is likewise formed by exudation or distil∣lation
from calcarious substances, in the same
manner as rock-crystal originates from vitri∣siable
matters. All this may be proved by in∣specting
these different substances, and by ex∣amining
attentively the great monuments of
nature.</P>

remote than that of the formation of calcarious

five epochs of the remotest antiquity: The first,
when the matter of the globe was in fusion by
fire, when the earth assumed its form, and the
Equator was elevated and the Poles depressed by
its rotatory motion: The second, when this mat∣ter
consolidated, and formed the great masses of
vitrifiable substances: The third, when the sea
covered the whole land now inhabited, and nou∣rished
shell-animals, the remains of which have
formed calcarious bodies: The fourth, when
the waters which cover our Continents retired
to their proper basins: A fifth epoch, the indi∣cations
of which are equally clear as the other

the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gions of the north. This epoch is evident∣ly
posterior to the fourth, since the relicks of

of the Old Continent, not only in our northern
provinces, but likewise in Canada and other
parts of North America. In the Royal cabinet
there are several tusks and many bones of the
elephant, which were found in Siberia. We
have other tusks and bones of the same animal
which were found in France; as well as teeth of
the hippopotamus discovered in America, near
the river Ohio. Hence these animals, which
cannot subsist in cold countries, have formerly
existed in northern climates. Of course, the
Frozen Zone was at that period equally warm as
our Torrid Zone is at present; for it is impossible
that the bodily constitution and real habits of
these animals, which are the most permanent and
invariable things in nature, should so far change
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
as to bestow the temperature of the rain-deer upon
the elephant. Neither can we suppose that these
southern animals, which require much heat for their
subsistence, could ever live and multiply in nor∣thern
regions, if the climate were equally cold as
it is at present. M. Gmelin, who travelled in Sibe∣ria,
and there collected many bones of the elephant,
supposes that vast inundations in the south had
driven the elephants to the north, where they would
all perish at once by the rigour of the climate.
But this cause is not proportioned to the effect.
More ivory, perhaps, has already been brought
from the north than all the elephants of India now
existing could furnish. Much more will be dis∣covered
when the vast deserts of the north, which
are scarcely known, shall be peopled, and the
earth cultivated and dug by the hands of man.
Besides, it is extremely improbable, that these
animals should take the route which is most re∣pugnant
to their nature; for, if they were
pushed by inundations from the south, why did
they not rather fly to the east and west? Why
did they fly as far as the sixtieth degree of north
latitude, when they might have stopt on the
road, or turned aside to more fortunate climates?
And how is it possible to conceive, that, by an
inundation from the southern ocean, the ele∣phants
were chased a thousand leagues into the
Old Continent, and more than three thousand
into the New? It is impossible that an inunda∣tion
from the Indian ocean should drive the e∣lephants
<PB N="279" REF="286"/>
into Canada, or even into Siberia; and
it is equally impossible, that they should arrive
in such numbers as are indicated by their re∣mains.</P>
<P>Dissatisfied with this explication, I imagined
that a more plausible one might be given, and
which should perfectly correspond with my the∣ory
of the earth. But, before exhibiting my
ideas on this subject, I shall, to prevent mis∣takes,
remark, 1. That the ivory found in Sibe∣ria
and in Canada unquestionably belongs to
the elephant, and not to the morse or sea-cow,
as some voyagers have pretended. In the north∣ern
regions, we likewise find the fossil ivory of
the morse; but it is different from that of the
elephant; and they are easily distinguished by
comparing their internal texture. The tusks,
the grinders, the scapulae, the thigh-bones, and
other bones found in the northern climates, cer∣tainly
belong to the elephant; it is even impos∣sible
to hesitate concerning the identity of
the species. The large square teeth discovered
in the same northern countries, the grinding
side of which resembles the spade painted on
cards, have every mark of the dentes molares
of the hippopotamus; and those enormous teeth,
the grinding side of which is composed of large
blunt points or protuberances, have belonged
to some terrestrial animal that now no longer
exists, like the great volutes called <HI>cornua ammo∣nis,</HI>
which at present exist not in the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="287"/>
2. The bones and tusks of these ancient ele∣phants
are every way as large as those of the
Indian elephants, to which we have compared
them. This is a proof that these animals did
not inhabit the northern regions from any ne∣cessity,
since they acquired, in that situation,
their full growth and complete dimensions. Of
this fact we may be ascertained by the descrip∣tions
and dimensions of them given by M.
Daubeuton under the article <HI>Elephant.</HI> But,
since that time, I have had transmitted to me an
entire tusk and some fragments of fossil ivory,
the length and breadth of which greatly exceed
the tusks of the common elephant. I searched
all the shops of the Paris ivory-merchants; but
I found no tusk which could be compared to
that in my possession. But, of a great number, I
found only one equal to those sent from Siberia,
whose circumference at the base is nineteen in∣ches.
Ivory, which is taken from living ele∣phants,
or from recent skeletons found in the
forests, is denominated <HI>raw ivory</HI>; and the
appellation of <HI>roasied ivory</HI> is given to that ex∣tracted
from the earth, the quality of which is
more or less altered, according to the time it has
remained under ground, or according to the quali∣ty
of the earth in which it has been buried. Most
tusks which come from the North are still very
solid, and very fine works may be made of them.
The largest were sent to us by M. de L'Isle, an
astronomer, and member of the Royal Academy
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
of Sciences. He collected them in his travels
through Siberia. In all the shops of Paris, there
was not a single tusk of raw ivory which mea∣sured
nineteen inches in circumference: They
were all smaller. This tusk was six feet and an
inch in length; and it appears, that those in the
Royal Cabinet, which were found in Siberia,
were, when entire, more than six feet and a half:
But, as their extremities were cut off, we could
only make a near guess at their real length.</P>
<P>If we compare the thigh-bones found in the
same northern countries, we shall be satisfied that
they are at least equally long, and considerably
thicker, than those of the Indian elephants.</P>
<P>Besides, as formerly remarked, we have made
an exact comparison of the bones and tusks sent
from Siberia with those of the skeleton of an e∣lephant,
and we found that all these bones are
evidently the relicks of these animals. The Si∣berian
tusks have not only the figure, but the
genuine structure of elephant ivory, which M.
Daubenton describes in the following terms.</P>
<P>'When an elephant's tusk is cut transversely,
we see, at or near the centre, a black point cal∣led
the <HI>heart.</HI> But, if the tusk is cut where it
is hollow, there is only a round hole in the
centre. We perceive crooked lines which ex∣tend
in different directions from the centre to
the circumference, and, by crossing, form small
lozenges. At the circumference, there is com∣monly
a narrow circular band. The crooked
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
lines ramify in proportion as they recede from
the centre. Hence the size of the lozenges is
nearly the same throughout. Their sides, or at
least their angles, are of a more lively colour
than the areas, doubtless because their substance
is more compact. The band at the circum∣ference
is composed of straight and transverse
fibres, which, if prolonged, would terminate in
the centre. It is the appearance of these lines
and points which is considered as the grain of
the ivory. This grain is perceptible in all ivories;
but it is more or less distinct in different tusks;
and, when the grain is sufficiently apparent, the
ivory gets the name of <HI>large grained,</HI> to distin∣guish
it from that whose grain is fine.'</P>
<P>It cannot be supposed that elephants could be
transported into Siberia by men; for the state of
captivity alone, independent of the rigour of the
climate, would have reduced them to a fourth
or a third of the dimensions which their remains
exhibit. Of this effect we have sufficient proof
from the comparison we have made between an
entire skeleton of an elephant in the Royal Ca∣binet,
which had lived sixteen years at Versailles,
with the tusks of other elephants brought from
their native country. This skeleton and these
tusks, though of considerable size, are one half
smaller than the tusks and skeletons of these
which live in freedom in Asia or in Africa; and,
at the same time, they are at least two thirds
<PB N="283" REF="290"/>
smaller than the bones of the same animals found
in Siberia.</P>
<P>3. The great quantities of ivory already dis∣covered
by accident in countries nearly desert,
and where no man searches for it, show, that it
is neither by one nor by several accidents, nor
at one and the same time, that some individuals
of this species have found their way into the
northern regions, but that the species had for∣merly
existed and multiplied there, in the same
manner as they now exist and multiply in sou∣thern
latitudes.</P>
<P>The only question, therefore, which remains
to be solved, is, Whether there is or has been a
cause that could so change the temperature of
the different parts of the globe as to render the
northern regions, which are now extremely cold,
equally warm as the southern climates?</P>
<P>Some philosophers may imagine that this ef∣fect
has been produced by the change in the o∣bliquity
of the ecliptic; because, at first sight, this
change seems to indicate, that, as the inclination
of the axis of the globe is not permanent,
the earth might formerly revolve round an axis
so different from that on which it now turns, as to
make Siberia then lie immediately under the E∣quator.
Astronomers have observed, that the
change in the obliquity of the ecliptic is about
45 seconds in a century. Hence, by supposing
this augmentation to be constant and successive,
60 centuries would produce a distance of 45
<PB N="284" REF="291"/>
minutes, and 3600 centuries would produce a
change of 45 degrees. Such an alteration would
bring back the 60th degree of latitude to the
15th, <HI>i. e.</HI> the country of Siberia, where the e∣lephants
formerly existed, to the regions of In∣dia,
where they still exist and multiply. Now,
it may be said, we have only to admit this long
lapse of time in order to account for the regular
abode of elephants in Siberia: It is 360,000 years
ago since the earth revolved round an axis 45
degrees distant from that upon which it turns at
present: The 15th degree of latitude was then
the 60th, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I answer, that this idea, and the mode of
explication which results from it, cannot, upon
examination, be supported. The change in the
obliquity of the ecliptic is not a constant and suc∣cessive
diminution and augmentation. On the
contrary, it is a limited variation, and sometimes
on one side and sometimes on the other;
and, consequently, can never produce, on any
side, nor in any climate, this difference of 45
degrees of inclination; for the variation in the o∣bliquity
of the earth's axis is occasioned by
the action of the planets, which alter the situa∣tion
of the ecleptic, without affecting the equa∣tor.
To take the strongest of these attractions,
which is that of Venus, it would require
126,000 years to make a change of 180 degrees
in the ecliptic of that planet, and, of course, to
produce an alteration of 6 degrees 47 minutes
<PB N="285" REF="292"/>
in the real obliquity of the earth's axis; since 6
degrees 47 minutes are the double of the incli∣nation
of the orbit of Venus. In the same
manner, the action of Jupiter cannot, in 93,6000
years, change the obliquity of the ecliptic above
2 degrees 38 minutes; and still this effect is in
part compensated by the preceding. Hence it
is impossible that this change in the obliquity of
the earth's axis should ever amount to 6 degrees,
unless we suppose, that the orbits of all the
plane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s should likewise change; a supposition
which we cannot nor ought not to admit, since
no cause exists which could produce this ef∣fect.</P>
<P>But I am enabled to solve this difficult mat∣ter,
and to deduce it from an immediate cause.
We have already seen, that the terrestrial globe,
when it first assumed its form, was in a state
of fluidity, and that the water being unable to
dissolve terrestrial bodies, this fluidity was a
liquefaction occasioned by fire. Now, to pass
from this burning and liquified state to a mild
and temperate heat, time was necessary. The
globe could not at once cool to its present tem∣perature.
Thus, during the first ages after its
formation, the heat proper to the earth was in∣finitely
greater than that which it received
from the sun; since it is still much greater.
This immense fire being afterwards gradually
dissipated, the polar, like all other climates, un∣derwent
successive changes from heat to cold.
<PB N="286" REF="293"/>
Of course, a certain time, or rather a long tract of
time, existed, during which the northern re∣gions,
after having burnt like all others, enjoyed
the same heat which at present is felt in the
southern climates. Hence these northern coun∣tries
might and actually have been inhabited
by animals now peculiar to the south, and to
whom this degree of heat is indispensible.
The fact, therefore, instead of being extraordi∣nary,
perfectly accords with the other facts,
and is no more than a consequence of them.
Instead of opposing my theory of the earth,
this fact, on the contrary, is an accessory proof
of its reality, and confirms the most obscure
point I have advanced; <HI>i. e.</HI> when we attempt
to look back into that profundity of time
when the light of genius is apt to extinguish
itself, and when, for want of observations,
genius has no aid to lead us to a more remote
period.</P>
<P>A sixth epoch, posterior to the other five, is
that when the two Continents were separated
from each other. It is certain, that they were
not separated when the elephants lived equal∣ly
in the north of Europe, Asia, and America;
I say, equally; for we find their bones in Si∣beria,
in Russia, and in Canada. Hence the
separation of the two Continents happened po∣sterior
to the abode of these animals in the
northern regions. But, as we likewise find the
<PB N="287" REF="294"/>
tusks of the elephant in Poland, in Germany,
in France, and in Italy, we must conclude,
that, in proportion as these northern regions
cooled, the elephants retired toward the tem∣perate
zone, where the heat of the sun, and
the greater thickness of the globe, compen∣sated
the loss of the earth's internal heat; and
that, in the progress of time, the temperate
zone having also become too cold, the elephant
gradually migrated to the climates under the
Torrid Zone, which alone have longest preser∣ved,
by the greater thickness of the globe, a
superior degree of internal heat. These are
likewise the only climates where this interior
heat, united with that of the sun, is still suffi∣cient
to support their existence, and to permit
them to propagate their species.</P>
<P>Independent of the specimens transmitted
from Russia and Siberia, and which are preser∣ved
in the Royal cabinet, there are many others
in private collections. Vast numbers of them
are to be seen in the musaeum of Petersburg, as
appears from a catalogue printed in the year
1742. There are likewise many of them in the
British musaeum, in that of Copenhagen, and
in some other collections in Britain, Germany,
and Italy. This northern ivory, like the sou∣thern,
is used in manufacturing many articles of
hardware, &amp;c. Hence the great quantity of
the tusks and bones of elephants found in Sibe∣ria
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
and Russia can no longer remain a doubtful
point.</P>
<P>M. Pallas, a learned naturalist, in his late
journey through Siberia, found a great quantity
of elephants bones, and an entire skeleton of a
rhinoceros, which was buried a few feet only
under the surface of the ground.</P>
<P>'Enormous bones of the elephant were late∣ly
discovered at Swijatoki, seventeen versts
from Petersburg: They were found in a spot
which had long been covered with water.
Hence some prodigious revolution must have
changed the climate, the productions, and the
animals, in every quarter of the globe. These
medals of Nature prove, that those countries
which are now desolated by the rigours of
intense cold, have formerly enjoyed all the ad∣vantages
of the southern latitudes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal de Politique et de Literature, 5. Jan. 1776, art. <HI>Petersbourg.</HI></NOTE>.'</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The discovery of the tusks and skeletons of
elephants in Canada is but recent; and I was
first informed of them by a letter from the late
Mr Collison, fellow of the Royal Society of
London, of which the following is a transla∣tion.</P>
<P>'Mr George Croghan has assured me, that,
in the course of his travels through the coun∣tries
bordering upon the river Ohio, in the
year 1765 and 1766, about four miles south-east
<PB N="289" REF="296"/>
from this river, and 640 miles distant
from Fort du Quesne or Pitsburgh, he saw, in
the neighbourhood of a large salt marsh, where
the wild animals assemble at certain seasons of
the year, immense bones and teeth. Having
carefully examined the place, he discovered,
in a high bank on the side of the marsh, a
prodigious number of bones, which, from
their figure and magnitude, appeared to be
the bones and tusks of elephants.'</P>
<P>'But, Sir, the large grinding teeth which I
send you, were found along with these tusks.
There are others still larger than these, which
seem to indicate, and even to demonstrate,
that they belong not to elephants. How shall
we reconcile this paradox? May we not sup∣pose,
that there formerly existed a large ani∣mal
which had the tusks of an elephant and
the grinders of the hippopotamus? for these
large grinders are very different from those of
the elephant. From the great number of tusks
and grinders which he saw, Mr Croghan thinks,
that there must have been at least thirty of
these animals buried in this place. Elephants,
however, were never known in America; and
it is improbable that they could be brought
there from Asia. The impossibity of their li∣ving
in countries where the winters are so ri∣gorous,
but where great quantities of their
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
bones are found, makes a paradox, which
your great sagacity may perhaps explain.'</P>
<P>'Mr Croghan, in the month of February
1767, sent to different persons in London, the
bones and teeth he had collected in the years
1765 and 1766.'</P>
<P>'1. To my Lord Shelburn, two large tusks,
one of which was entire, and near seven feet

<HEAD>Extract from a Journal of a voyage made by Mr
Croghan on the river Ohio, and transmitted to
Dr Franklin in the month of May 1765.</HEAD>
<P>'Having passed the great river Miame, we
arrived, in the evening, at the place where the
bones of elephants are found. It is about 640
miles from Fort Pitt. In the morning, I
went to the large marsh where the wild ani∣mals
assemble at certain times of the year.
We came to this place by a road beaten with
the feet of the wild oxen, or bisons. It is a∣bout
four miles south-east from the river Ohio.
We saw a great number of bones, some of
them scattered about, and others buried five or
six feet below the surface. We saw them in a
bank of earth along the side of the road. We
found two tusks of six feet in length, which
we carried to our hut, along with other bones
and teeth. The following year we returned
<PB N="292" REF="299"/>
to the same place, in order to procure a great∣er
number of tusks and teeth.'</P>
<P>'I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M. de Buffon had any queries to make
upon this subject, I entreated him,' says Mr
Collinson, 'to transmit them to me; I shall send
them to Mr Croghan, a man of integrity and
parts, who will be happy to answer every
question.' This little Memoir was subjoined
to the letter which I have just now quoted, and
to which I shall add an extract of what Mr Col∣linson
formerly wrote me concerning these A∣merican
bones.</P>
<P>'About a mile and a half from the river Ohio,
there are six enormous skeletons buried on end,
with tusks from five to six feet long, and of
the same form and substance as elephants tusks.
They were thirty inches in circumference at
the root. They tapered to a point. But, as they
were broken, we could not perceive how they
were joined to the jaws. A thigh-bone of the
same animals was found entire. It weighed a
hundred pounds, and was four and a half feet
in length. These tusks and thigh-bones show
that the animal must have been of a prodigious
magnitude. These facts have been confirmed
by Mr Greenwood, who saw the six skeletons
in the salt-marsh. In the same place, he like∣wise
found large grinders, which appeared not
to belong to the elephant, but rather to the
hippopotamus. Some of these teeth he sent to
<PB N="293" REF="300"/>
London, among others, two of which together
weighed 9¼ pounds. He says, that the jaw∣bone
was too heavy to be carried by two men.
The interval between the orbits of the two
eyes was eighteen inches. An Englishman,
who had been taken prisoner by the savages,
and conducted to this salt-marsh in order to
teach them how to make salt by evaporating
the water, declared, that, from a peculiar cir∣cumstance,
he remembered to have seen these
enormous bones. He told, that three French∣men,
who were breaking nuts, sat upon a single
thigh-bone.'</P>
</DIV1></BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Some time after writing these letters, Mr
Collinson read to the Royal Society of London
two short essays on the same subject, in which I
found some new facts, which I shall relate, and
add elucidations of such things as may require
explanation.</P>
<P>'The salt-marsh where the elephants bones
are found is about four miles distant from the
banks of the river Ohio; but it is more than
seven hundred miles from the nearest coast of
the sea. There is a road beaten by the wild
oxen, or bisons, large enough to allow two
chariots to travel abreast. This road directly
leads to the great salt-marsh where these ani∣mals,
as well as stags and other species of the
deer, assemble at a certain season of the year
to lick the earth and drink the salt water. . . . .
<PB N="294" REF="301"/>
The elephants bones are found in a bank of
about six or seven feet high, which surrounds
the marsh. There we see teeth and bones
which had formerly belonged to some animals
of a prodigious size. Some of the tusks are
near seven feet in length, and consist of excel∣lent
ivory; and therefore we cannot entertain
any doubt that they really belong to the ele∣phant
species. It is singular, however, that,
among these tusks, we never meet with a sin∣gle
grinder of an elephant, but a vast number
of enormous teeth, each of which has five or
six blunt knobs, and must have belonged to
some animal of an immense size. These square
teeth have no resemblance to the grinders of
the elephant, which are flat, and four or five
times broader than thick; so that these e∣normous
grinders have no resemblance to the
teeth of any known animal.'</P>
<P>This last remark of Mr Collinson is extremely
just: These large grinders are totally different
from those of the elephant; and, by comparing
them with the grinders of the hippopotamus,
which they resemble by their square figure, we
shall perceive that they likewise differ in size,
as they are two, three, and even four times
more voluminous than the largest teeth of the
ancient hippopotami found in Siberia and Ca∣nada,
though these last teeth are three or four
times larger than those of the hippopotami
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
which now exist. All the teeth which I have
examined in four heads of these animals pre∣served
in the Royal Cabinet, have the grinding
side hollowed in the form of a card-spade, and
those found in Canada and Siberia have the same
character, and differ from them in size only.
But those enormous teeth with large blunt knobs
have always four and sometimes five rows;
whilst the largest teeth of the hippopotamus have
only three, as may be seen by comparing the
figures of plate CII. CIV. and CV. with those of
plate CVI. It seems, therefore, to be certain, that
these large teeth have never belonged either to
the elephant or to the hippopotamus: The differ∣ence
in size, though enormous, would not pre∣vent
us from regarding them as pertaining to
this last species, if all the characters in their
form were the same; since we know, as for∣merly
remarked, other square teeth three or
four times larger than those of the present ex∣isting
hippopotami, and which, having the pre∣cise
same characters, are unquestionably the
teeth of hippopotami that have been three times
larger than those whose heads are in the Royal
Cabinet. I meant those large teeth, which real∣ly
belong to the hippopotamus, when I remark∣ed,
that they were equally found in both Con∣tinents,
as well as the tusks of the elephant.
It is remarkable, however, that we not only
find real tusks of the elephant, and real teeth of
<PB N="296" REF="303"/>
the large hippopotamus, in Siberia and Canada,
but we likewise find in the same countries those
enormous teeth with four rows of large blunt
knobs. We may, therefore, conclude, that this
immense animal no longer exists, and that the
species is entirely extinct.</P>
<P>M. l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Compte de Vergennes, minister and se∣cretary
of state, was so obliging as to give me, in
the year 1770, the largest of all these teeth, which
is represented in plates CII. and CIII.; it weigh∣ed
eleven pounds four ounces. This immense
tooth was discovered in making a ditch in Little
Tartary. There were other bones which could
not be collected, and, among these, a thigh-bone,
of which one half only was entire, and the ca∣vity
of this half contained fifteen Paris pints of
water. M. l'Abbé Chappe, of the Academy
of sciences, brought me from Siberia a similar
tooth, but smaller, and which weighed only three
pounds twelve and a half ounces. (Plate CIV. fig.
1. and 2.) Lastly, the largest of those transmit∣ted
to me by Mr Collinson, and which is repre∣sented,
(plate CV.) was found, among several o∣thers,
near the river Ohio in America; and they
pertectly resemble other specimens brought
from Canada.</P>
<P>From all these facts it is apparent, that, inde∣pendent
of the elephant and hippopotamus,
whose relicks are equally found in the two con∣tinents,
another animal common to both has
<PB N="297" REF="304"/>
formerly existed, the size of which has greatly
exceeded that of the largest elephants; for the
square form of these enormous grinders shows,
that they were numerous in each jaw; and sup∣posing
there were only six or even four in each
side of the jaws, we may form some notion of
the magnitude of a head which could contain
sixteen grinders, each weighing ten or eleven
pounds. The elephant has only four grinders,
two on each side. They are flat, and occupy
the whole jaw; and these two flat grinders of
the elephant surpass by two inches only the
breadth of the largest square tooth of the un∣known
animal, which is double the thickness
of those of the elephant. Thus every cicum∣stance
leads us to think, that this ancient species,
which ought to be regarded as the largest of all
terrestrial animals, existed during the first ages
only; for an animal much larger than the ele∣phant
could not be so concealed in any part
of the earth as to remain perfectly unknown.
Besides, it is evident, from the figure of these
teeth, as well as from the enamel, and the disposi∣tion
of their roots, that they have no relation to
the teeth of the cetaceous tribes; and that they
have really belonged to a land-animal whose
species made a nearer approach to that of the
hippopotamus than to any other.</P>
<P>In the course of his essay. Mr Collinson in∣forms
us, that several members of the Royal

Society were equally well acquainted with the
elephants tusks daily found in Siberia, upon the
banks of the Oby, and other rivers of that coun∣try.
What system, he adds, can be formed,
which will, with any degree of probability, ac∣count
for those bones of the elephant found in
Siberia and in America? He concludes with enu∣merating
the weight and dimensions of all the
teeth brought from the salt-marsh near the river
Ohio, the largest of which belonged to Captain
Ourry, and weighed six pounds and a half.</P>
<P>Mr Collinson, in his second essay, read before
the Royal Society of London December 10. 1767,
remarks, that, as one of the tusks found in the
salt-marsh was striated or furrowed near the
thickest end, he entertained some doubts whether
these furrows were peculiar to the elephant species.
To satisfy himself on this head, he visited the
warehouse of a merchant who dealt in all kinds
of teeth; and, after examining them, he disco∣vered
that there were as many tusks furrowed
as smooth at the thick end; and, of course, he
had no difficulty in pronouncing, that the tusks
found in America were, in every respect, simi∣lar
to those of the African and Asiatic elephants.
But, as the large American square teeth have
no relation to the grinders of the elephant, he
thinks, that they are the remains of some enor∣mous
animal which had tusks like an elephant,
and grinders peculiar to its own species, their
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
magnitude and form being totally different from
those of any known animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. 1767.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1748, M. Fabri, who had made
great excursions into the northern parts of Loui∣siana
and the southern regions of Canada, in∣formed
me, that he had seen heads and skele∣tons
of an enormous quadruped, called by the
Savages the <HI>father of Oxen</HI>; and that the thigh∣bones
of these animals were from five to six
feet in length. Some time after, and previous
to the year 1767 specimens of these large teeth
belonging to the unknown animal, as well as
those of the hippopotamus, and bones of the e∣lephant,
all found in America, were transmitted
to Paris. The number of them is too conside∣rable
to leave any doubt that these animals for∣merly
existed in the northern regions of Ame∣rica,
as well as in those of Europe and Asia.</P>
<P>But elephants have likewise existed in all the
temperate countries of our Continent. I men∣tioned
tusks found in Languedoc near Simore,
and those discovered in Cominges in Gascony.
To these I shall add the largest and finest of the
whole, lately sent to the Royal Cabinet by the
Duc de la Rochefoucauld, whose zeal for pro∣moting
science is a result of his general know∣ledge.
This excellent specimen he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>found, a∣long
with M. Desmarets of the Academy of Sci∣ences,
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
when viewing the fields in the environs
of Rome. This tusk was divided into five frag∣ments,
which the Duc de la Rochfoucauld or∣dered
to be collected. One of these fragments
was stolen by the porter who had the charge of
it, and there remained only four, which were
about eight inches in diameter. When laid to∣gether,
these four fragments were seven feet
in length; and we learn from M. Desmarets,
that the fifth fragment, which was lost, was
near three feet long. Hence the total length
of the tusk must have been about ten feet. By
examining the broken ends, we discovered eve∣ry
character of elephantine ivory; though, by
being long buried under ground, it has become
light and friable, like all other fossil ivories.</P>
<P>M. Tozzetti, a learned Italian naturalist, re∣lates,
that there were found, in the valleys of
Arno, the bones of elephants and other terres∣trial
animals in great quantities, scattered here
and there in the strata of the earth. We may,
therefore, he remarks, conclude, that elephants
were formerly natives of Europe, and especially
of Tuscany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'une lettre du Docteur Tozzetti, Journal étran∣ger, mois de Decembre 1755.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'We found,' says M. Caliellini, 'about the

of an elephant's tusk lately brought from Asia,
we found that the resemblance between them
was perfect.'</P>

In the same manner, we find in France, and
in all the other nations of Europe, skeletons and
vertebrae of marine animals, which can only
subsist in the most southern seas. The same
change of temperature, therefore, has happened
in the various parts of the ocean as well as in
those of the land; and this second fact, like the
first, as it proceeds from the same cause, con∣firms
the whole.</P>
<P>When we compare those ancient monuments
of the first age of animated nature with her ac∣tual
productions, we evidently perceive that the
constituent form of each animal has remained
the same, and that there is no alteration in the
principal parts of their structure. The type of
each species has suffered no change. The inter∣nal
mould has invariably preserved its form.
However long we may suppose the succession of
time, whatever number of generations may have
passed, the individuals of each kind still exhibit
the same forms as those of the first ages, espe∣cially
in the larger species, whose characters are
more fixed, and whose nature is more permanent;
for the inferior species have, as formerly re∣marked,
been sensibly affected by the dif∣ferent
causes of degeneration. We must, how∣ever,
remark, with regard to the larger species,
such as the elephant and hippopotamus, that, by
comparing their ancient remains with those of
our times, we, in general, perceive that these a∣nimals
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
were then much larger than they are at
present. Nature was then in her primitive vi∣gour.
The internal heat of the earth bestowed
on its productions all the vigour and magnitude
of which they were susceptible. The first ages
produced giants of every kind. Dwarfs and
pigmies succeeded, after the earth had cooled;
and if, as other monuments seems to indicate,
some species of animals, which formerly existed,
are now lost, this effect could only be produced,
because their nature required a greater degree of
heat than what is now felt in the torrid zone.
Those enormous and nearly square grinders with
blunt knobs, those large cornua ammonis, of
which some are several feet in diameter, and
many other fossil fishes and shells, which no
longer have any living representatives, existed
only in those primitive times when the earth
and sea were still warm, and produced and nou∣rished
animals to whom this degree of heat was
necessary, and who exist not at present, because
they have probably perished by cold.</P>
<P>To know all the petrifactions of which there
are no living representatives, would require long
study and an exact comparison of the various
species of petrified bodies, which have been
found in the bowels of the earth. This sci∣ence
is still in its infancy. We are certain,
however, that there are many of those species,
such as, the cornua ammonis, ortoceratites, len∣ticular
<PB N="304" REF="311"/>
and numismal stones, belemnites, Judaic
stones, anthropomorphites, &amp;c. which cannot
be referred to any species now existing. We
have seen cornua ammonis of two and three feet
in diameter; and we have been assured by men
worthy of credit, that a cornua ammonis has been
found in Champagne larger than a mill-stone,
since it was eight feet in diameter and one foot
thick. I had an offer of its being sent to me.
But the enormous weight of this mass, which
is 8000 pounds, and its great distance from Pa∣ris,
prevented me from accepting the present.
These examples, and others which might be
given, are sufficient to show, that many species
of shell and crustaceous animals formerly exist∣ed
in the sea, of which there are now no living
representatives. The same observation is ap∣plicable
to some of the scaly fishes. Most of
those found in certain slates have so little resem∣blance
to the fishes with which we are acquaint∣ed,
that their species cannot be ascertained. E∣ven
those in the Royal Cabinet, which are per∣fectly
preserved in masses of stone, cannot be re∣ferred
to any of our known species. It appears,
therefore, that the sea formerly nourished ma∣ny
genera, whose species no longer exist.</P>
<P>But, with regard to terrestrial animals, we
have only a single example of a lost species,
and it appears to have been the largest, without
excepting even the elephant: And, since the
<PB N="305" REF="312"/>
examples of lost species are more rare in land
than in marine animals, is it not probable, that
the production of the former was posterior to
that of the latter?</P>
<P>From these facts and monuments we may
perceive six successive epochs in the first ages of
Nature; six species of duration, the limits of
which, though indeterminate, are not the less
real; for these epochs are not, like those of
civil history, marked by sixed points, or limited
by centuries and other portions of time which
admit of an exact measurement. They may,
however, be compared between themselves, and
their relative duration may be estimated by other
facts and monuments, which indicate contempo∣rary
dates.</P>

<P>After finishing his preliminary discourse, the
Count de Buffon proceeds to state the different
epochs of Nature, which he divides into seven

These epochs are purely hypothetical, and
depend more or less on the notion, that the
earth and planets were originally driven from
the body of the sun by the impulse of a comet,
and, of course, remained long in a state of li∣quid
fire. We shall therefore content ourselves
with having barely mentioned them, and pro∣ceed
to enumerate some facts and positions,
which, though applied in support of a fanciful
system, are curious, and may be useful.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The Count de Buffon remarks, that the ca∣vities
and eminences of the globe have been en∣crusted,
and sometimes filled with metallic sub∣stances,
which are still found in these situations.</P>
<P>'Metallic veins,' says M. Eller, 'are found
only in elevated places, in a long chain of
mountains. This chain of mountains is al∣ways
supported by a basis of hard rock. As
long as this rock preserves its continuity, there
is no chance of discovering metallic veins.
But, when we meet with crevices or fissures,
we then entertain hopes of finding metal.
Mineralogists have remarked, that, in Ger∣many,
the most favourable situation is when
the mountains rise gradually, stretch toward
the south-east, and, after attaining their
greatest elevation, descend gently toward the
north west. . . .'</P>
<P>'It is generally in a rugged rock, the extent
of which is often unlimited, but split into
<PB N="308" REF="315"/>
fissures, that metals are found sometimes pure,
but generally in the state of ores. These fis∣sures
are commonly encrusted with a white
shining substance called <HI>quartz</HI> by the miners:
When heavier, but soft and laminated nearly
like chalk, it receives the denomination of
<HI>spar.</HI> It is surrounded, on the side next the
rock, with a kind of slime, which seems to
nourish these quartzy or sparry earths. These
two coverings serve as a sheath for the vein.
The more perpendicular the vein, the more is
to be expected from it. Whenever the miners
find a perpendicular vein, they say that it
will be very productive.'</P>
<P>'In these fissures and cavities, metals are form∣ed
by a perpetual and pretty strong evaporation.
The vapours which issue from mines show
that this evaporation is still going on. Fissures
which have no exhalation are commonly bar∣ren
of metal. The most certain proof that the
exhaling vapours carry along with them mi∣neral
particles, and apply them to the sides of
the fissures, is that successive encrustation which
is apparent in the whole circumference of
these fissures or hollows of rocks, till their ca∣vities
are completely filled, and the solid vein
is formed. This fact is still farther confirmed
by the tools left in these hollows; and, several
years after, they are found to be encrusted
with metal.'</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="316"/>
'The fissures which furnish the most rich
veins of metal always incline to a perpendicular
direction. In proportion as the miners de∣scend,
the temperature of the air is always
warmer; and the exhalations are sometimes so
abundant, and so noxious, that, in order to
avoid suffocation, the miners are obliged to
fly to the pits or galleries, otherwise they
would be instantly destroyed by the arsenical
and sulphureous particles. Sulphur and arsenic
are commonly found in the four imperfect,
and in all the semimetals, and it is from these
they receive their metallic form.'</P>
<P>'Gold, and sometimes silver and copper, are
the only metals which are found pure in any
quantities. But, in general, copper, iron,
lead, and tin, when taken out of the veins,
are mineralized with sulphur and arsenic. We
know from experience, that metals lose their
metallic form by degrees of heat proportioned
to each species. This destruction of the metal∣lic
form, which the four imperfect metals under∣go,
shows that the basis of metals is an ear∣thy
matter; and, as these calces, as well as the
calcarious and gypseous earths, vitrify by the
application of a certain degree of heat, we
are certain that metallic earth belongs to the
class of vitrifiable earths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de M. Eller sur l'origine et la generation des Me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aux.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="317"/>
M. Lehman, a celebrated chymist, is the first
person who suspected that metallic substances had
a double origin. 'Gold and silver,' he remarks,
'are found in masses only in the mountains
which have veins, and iron is found only in
those mountains which have regular strata.
All the small pieces of gold and silver found
in the mountains with strata have been detach∣ed
from veins in the superior mountains in
the neighbourhood of the former.'</P>
<P>'Gold is never in the form of ore. It is al∣ways
found in a native or virgin state, though
it is often scattered about in particles so mi∣nute,
that it cannot be distinguished even by
the best microscopes. In the mountains with
strata, no gold, and very little silver, are to be
found. These two metals belong exclusively
to mountains with veins. Sometimes, how∣ever,
we find silver in small leaves, or under
the form of hair, in slate. Native copper of∣tener
occurs in slate; and this copper is also
commonly in the form of threads or hair.'</P>
<P>'A few years after iron-ores have been ta∣ken
from the earth, they are reproduced.
They are not found in the mountains with
veins, but in those with strata. Iron is sel∣dom,
if ever, met with in a native state.'</P>
<P>'With regard to native tin, it has no exist∣ence
in Nature, and is only produced by the
assistance of fire. The same remark is appli∣cable
<PB N="311" REF="318"/>
to lead, though the grains found in Sile∣sia
have been considered as native lead.'</P>
<P>'Native mercury is found in strata of fat ar∣gillaceous
earth, or in slate.'</P>
<P>'The silver ores found in slate are not nearly
so rich as those found in the mountains with
veins. This metal is found in beds of slate;
and is always in the form of minute particles,
threads, or ramifications, but never appears in
large masses. These beds of slate must like∣wise
be adjacent to the mountains with veins.
The silver-ores found in strata are never in a
solid or compact form. All the other ores,
which contain much silver, are peculiar to the
mountains with veins. There is a great deal
of silver in the strata of slate; and it is also
sometimes found in pit-coal.'</P>
<P>'Tin is the metal which most rarely appears
in strata; lead is more common in that situa∣tion.
We find it attached to slate, but never
to coal.'</P>
<P>'Iron is almost universally diffused, and is
found in beds under a number of different
forms.'</P>
<P>'Cinnabar, cobalt, bismuth, and lapis cala∣minaris,
are likewise commonly found in beds.'</P>
<P>'Pit-coal, jett, amber, and aluminous earth,
are produced by vegetables, and especially by
resinous trees which have been buried in the
earth, and have been more or less decom∣posed;
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
for we often find, above the strata of
coal, wood which is not totally decomposed; and
it is still more decomposed as we descend deep∣er.
Slate, which covers coal, is often full of the
impressions of plants, such as ferns, maiden∣hair,
&amp;c. It is remarkable, that all these im∣pressions
belong to foreign plants, and the wood
likewise appears to be foreign. Amber, which
ought to be regarded as a vegetable resin, often
includes insects, which, when attentively ex∣amined,
belong not to the climate where they
now exist. Aluminous earth is frequently la∣minated,
and resembles wood sometimes more
and sometimes less decomposed.'</P>
<P>'Sulphur, alum, and sal ammoniac, are found
in beds formed by volcano's.'</P>
<P>'Petroleum and naphtha indicate a subterra∣neous
fire, which produces a distillation from
pit-coal. We have examples of these subter∣raneous
fires which act silently, in the coal
strata of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tain and Germany. They burn
long without any explosion; and it is in the
neighbourhood of these subterraneous fires
that hot springs are found.'</P>
<P>'The mountains which contain veins include
neither coal nor bituminous and combustible
bodies: These substances are found only in the
mountains with strata.'</P>
<P>In the second epoch of Nature, the Count
de Buffon remarks, 'that, in the northern re∣gions
<PB N="313" REF="320"/>
there are mountains composed entirely
of iron.' I mention, says he, by way of ex∣ample,
the iron mines near Taberg in Smoland,
a part of the island of Gothland in Sweden.
It is the most remarkable of those mines, or ra∣ther
mountains of iron which have the quality
of yielding to the attraction of the load-stone;
which proves that they have been formed by
the action of fire. The basis of this mountain
is a very fine sand. Its height is more than
400 feet, and its circumference about one league.
It is composed entirely of a rich ferruginous
matter, and we even find in it native iron, which
is another proof that it has undergone the ac∣tion
of a violent fire. This ore, when broken,
exhibits small shining particles, which sometimes
cross each other, and sometimes are arranged
like scales. This mine has been wrought above
two hundred years.</P>
<P>The ore in this mountain is not disposed in
regular beds; neither is the iron every where of
equal goodness. Through the whole mountain
there are fisssures sometimes perpendicular, and
sometimes horizontal: These are all filled with
sand, which contains no iron. This sand is
pure, and of the same species with that on the
sea-coast. In this sand, we sometimes find the
bones of animals, and the horns of stags, which
shows that the sand has been carried thither by
the waters, and that the formation of this iron
<PB N="314" REF="321"/>
mountain by fire happened before the crevices
and the perpendicular and horizontal fissures
were filled with sand.</P>
<P>The masses of ore are rolled down from the
top of the mountain; but, in other mines, the
minerals must be drawn up from the bowels of
the earth. This o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e must be broken to pieces,
or pounded, before it is put into the furnace,
where it is smelted by means of charcoal and cal∣carious
stones.</P>
<P>This hill of iron is situated in an elevated and
mountainous district, about eighty leagues from
the sea: It seems to have formerly been altoge∣ther
covered with sand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'un article de l'ouvrage periodique qui a pour titre, <HI>Norsdilche beytrage,</HI> &amp;c. Contribution du Nord pour les progrés de la physique, des Sciences, et des arts, 1756.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>We are next informed, that there are moun∣tains
of load-stone in some countries, and parti∣cularly
in those of the North. From the fore∣going
example, we have seen that the iron
mountain of Taberg rises 400 feet above the le∣vel
of the sea. M. Gmelin, in his travels through
Siberia, remarks, that, in the northern coun∣tries
of Asia, almost all the metallic ores are
found on the surface of the earth, whilst in o∣ther
countries they are buried deep in the inte∣rior
parts of the earth. This fact, if generally
true, is a new proof that metals have been form∣ed
by the primitive fire, and that the globe be∣ing
<PB N="315" REF="322"/>
less thick in the northern regions, metals
were formed nearer the surface than in the sou∣thern
countries.</P>
<P>M. Gmelin examined the great mountain of
loadstone among the Baschkires in Siberia.
This mountain is divided into eight parts by
valleys, of which the seventh part produces the
best loadstone. The summit of this portion of
the mountain consists of a yellowish stone, which
seems to partake of the nature of jasper. We
there find stones that have the appearance of
free-stone, which weight from two to three
thousand pounds; but they all have a magne∣tic
virtue. Though covered with moss, they
fail not, at more than the distance of an inch,
to attract iron and steel. The sides exposed to
the air have the strongest magnetic power, those
covered with the earth being much weaker.
Those parts which are exposed to the injuries of
the air are softer, and, consequently, less pro∣per
for being armed. A large portion of load∣stone,
of the size above mentioned, is composed
of a number of other portions which act in dif∣ferent
directions. To work them properly,
they should be separated in such a manner that
the whole portion, which includes the virtue of
each particular magnet, should preserve its uni∣ty:
By observing this rule, we would probably
obtain magnets of an uncommon strength. But,
as they are cut without any foresight, many
<PB N="316" REF="323"/>
portions are of no value, either because they
contain little no magnetic power, or because,
in a single piece, there are two or three mag∣nets
united: Such portions have indeed a mag∣netic
virtue; but, as it is not directed to the
same point, a magnet of this kind must be sub∣ject
to great variations.</P>
<P>The loadstone of this mountain, except what
is exposed to the air, is exceedingly hard, spot∣ted
with black, and full of little knots or protu∣berances,
consisting of small angular parts, like
those often observable on the surface of blood∣stone,
from which it differs only in colour; but,
instead of these angular parts, we sometimes per∣ceive
a kind of ochrey earth. In general, load∣stones
with these angular parts have less power
than the other kinds. That part of the moun∣tain
where the loadstones are found is composed
almost entirely of a fine iron ore, which lies in
small portions among the loadstones. The
whole section of the high part of the mountain
contains a similar ore; but, in proportion as we
descend, the metal is more rare. Below the
ore of loadstone, there are other ferruginous
stones, which, if melted, would produce very
little iron. These stones have the colour of
metal, and are very heavy. Their interior
parts are irregular, and have nearly the appear∣ance
of scoriae. In their surfaces they pretty
much resemble loadstones; but they have no
<PB N="317" REF="324"/>
magnetic power. Between these stones there are
other pieces of rock which appear to be compo∣sed
of small particles of iron. The stone itself
is heavy, but very soft. The interior parts re∣semble
burned matter, and they have little or
no magnetic virtue. We likewise meet occa∣sionally
with a brown iron ore in beds of an
inch thick; but it yields very little metal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'Hist. generale des voyages, tom. 18. p. 141. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mountains of Poias in Siberia, there
are several other mines of loadstone. Ten
leagues off the road which leads from Catharin∣bourg
to Salikamskaia, there is a hill called <HI>Ga∣lazinski,</HI>
which is more than twenty fathoms
high, and is entirely composed of a loadstone
rock. It has the brown colour and the density
of iron.</P>
<P>Twenty leagues from Salikamskaia, we find
cubical loadstones of a brilliant greenish colour.
When pulverised, the grains have the appear∣ance
of fire. It is worthy of remark, that load∣stone
is found only in those chains of mountains
which stretch from south to north<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 19. p. 472.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the countries bordering upon Lapland, and
on the confines of Bothnia, two leagues distant
from Cokluanda, there is an iron-ore, from
which very fine loadstones are extracted. 'We
admired,' says Regnard, 'the surprising effects
<PB N="318" REF="325"/>
of this stone, when it remained in its natural
situaton: It required a great deal of force to
obtain pieces of the magnitude we wished; and
the large hammer employed remained so fixed
to the wedge in the stone, that the workman
required assistance to disengage it. I tried the
experiment myself; I took a large iron lever,
which was so heavy that I could hardly sup∣port
it; I brought it near the wedge by which
it was attracted and supported with an ama∣zing
force. I held a mariner's compass in the
middle of the hole where the ore lay, and the
needle revolved perpetually with an incredible
rapidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ocuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 185.</NOTE>.'</P>

<P>This passage requires explanation, as well as
some restrictions. From a thousand observa∣tions,

I advanced, from the authority of Woodward,
who first collected facts upon this subject, that
shells were likewise found on the tops of the
highest mountains. From my own observations,
as well as those of others, I know, that there
are shells in the Alps and Pyrennees at 900,
1000, 1200, and 1500 fathoms above the level
of the sea; that they are likewise found in the
mountains of Asia; and, lastly, in the Cordeli∣eres
of America, a bank of shells has lately been
discovered at the height of more than 2000 fa∣thoms
above the sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. le Gentil, of the academy of Sciences, wrote me the following letter, in December 1771: 'Don Antonia Ulloa desired me, when departing from Cadiz, to send him two petrified shells, which, in the year 1761, he had dug out of the mountain that contains the quick silver mines. This mountain is in the government of Ouanca-Velica in Peru. Its southern latitude is from 13 to 14 degrees. At the place where these shells are found, the mercury stood at 17 inches 1¼ line, which corresponds to the height of 2222⅓ fathoms above the level of the sea.'
'At the top of the mountain, which is far from being the highest in this canton, the mercury stands at 16½ inches, which implies a height of 2337 2/8 fathoms.'
'In the town of Ouanca-Velica, the mercury stands at 18 inches 1½ line, which gives a height of 1949 fathoms.'
'Don Antonio Ulloa informed me, that he detached these shells from a very thick bank, the extent of which he did not know: The shells are of the large pilgrim or scallop kind.'</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, certain, that, in all the dif∣ferent
parts of the world, and even to the height
of 1500 or 2000 fathoms above the present le∣vel
<PB N="320" REF="327"/>
of the sea, the surface of the globe has been
covered with the waters, and that they remain∣ed
long enough for the production and multi∣plication
of shell-animals; for the quantity of
them is so great, that their spoils often form
large banks, which extend many miles in length.
They compose a considerable part of the exterior
strata of the earth; for calcarious substances,
or the spoils of shells, are very common in most
countries. But, at high points of elevation,
<HI>i. e.</HI> above 1500 or 2000 fathoms, the summits
of the mountains generally consist of pure rock,
granite, and other vitrifiable bodies produced
by the primitive fire, which contain no shells,
madrepores, or any thing that has a relation to
calcarious substances. We may, therefore, con∣clude,
that the sea has never reached, or at least
for a short time only, those most elevated parts
of the earth.</P>
<P>To support the testimony of Don Ulloa, con∣cerning
the shells found in the Cordelieres, we
shall add that of Alphonso Barba. He tells us,
that, in the most mountainous part of Peru, there
are shells of all sizes, some of them concave, o∣thers
convex, and the whole finely impressed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Metallurgie d'Alphonso Barba, tom. 1. p. 64.</NOTE>.
Hence America, as well as the other quarters of
the globe, has been covered with the waters of
the sea. The first observers were probably in∣duced
to think that no shells were to be found
<PB N="321" REF="328"/>
in the Cordelieres, because most of these moun∣tains,
which are the highest on this globe, are
either active or extinguished volcano's, the e∣ruptions
of which have covered all the adjacent
countries with burned substances: Of course,
all the shells which might have been found
there, are not only buried, but completely de∣stroyed.
It is not, therefore, surprising that no
marine productions have been discovered around
these mountains, which either are at present, or
have formerly been volcano's; for the ter∣ritories
which surround these mountains must
be composed entirely of ashes, scoriae, glass, lava,
and other burned or vitrified bodies. Thus the
notion that the sea never covered the mountains,
has no other foundation than this circumstance,
that, on the tops of several of them, no shells or
other productions of the sea are now to be seen.
But, as we find, in an infinite number of pla∣ces,
and even as high as 1500 or 2000 fathoms,
shells and other sea-bodies, it is evident, that
there are few ridges of mountains which have
not been covered with the ocean; and that the
spots where no shells appear only show that the
animals which produce them have never dwelt
there, or that the motion of the waters has not
transported thither marine productions, as it has
done in every other part of the globe.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>We are next informed, that some fishes and
plants can live and vegetate in waters so hot as
<PB N="322" REF="329"/>
from 50 to 60 degrees of the thermometer.
There are many examples of plants growing in
the hottest bath-waters; and M. Sonnerat found
fishes in water the heat of which was so great
that he durst not plunge his hand into it. 'Two
leagues from Calamba,' says he, 'I found in
the isle of Luçon, near the village of Bally, a
brook, the water of which was so hot that
Reaumur's thermometer, when plunged into
it, about a league from its source, stood at
the 69th degree. Upon perceiving such a
degree of heat, I imagined, that all the produc∣tions
of nature must have been extinguished
upon the margin of this brook. But I was
much surprised when I saw three vigorous
shrubs, the roots of which were immersed in
this boiling water, and their branches sur∣rounded
with its vapour. The heat was so
great, that, when the swallows attempted to
cross the water at seven or eight feet high, they u∣niformly
fell down dead. One of these shrubs
was an <HI>agnus castus,</HI> the other two were a
species of broom called <HI>aspalathus.</HI> During my
abode in this village, I constantly drank this wa∣ter
after it was cooled. Its taste seemed to be
earthy and ferruginous. Several baths are con∣structed
along this brook, and their degrees of
heat are proportioned to their distance from its
source. When I visited the first bath, my
surprise was increased: In this water, which
<PB N="323" REF="330"/>
was so hot that I durst not plunge my hand
into it, I saw fishes swimming. I used every
effort to procure some of them; but their agi∣lity,
and the want of address in the people,
prevented me from succeeding. I examined
them in the water; but I could not distinguish
their genus, on account of the vapour rising
from the water. They had brown scales,
and the largest of them were about four inch∣es
long. I could not learn how these fishes
had got into the baths.' The testimony of
M. Sonnerat is strengthened by that of M. Pre∣vost,
who travelled with him into the interior
parts of the isle of Luçon. 'You was right,' M.
Prev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st remarks, 'to communicate to M. de
Buffon the observations you collected when
we travelled together. You desire me to con∣firm
in writing what surprised us so much in
the village of Bally, situated on the margin of
the Laguna of Manilla, at <HI>Los-bagnos.</HI> I am
sorry I have not a copy of our observations
made with Reaumur's thermometer. But I
clearly recollect, that the water of the small
brook which passed through this village to fall
into the lake, made the mercury rise to 66
or 67 degrees, though it was plunged into the
water at a league's distance from the source of
the brook. The margins of this brook were
covered with a very fine green carpet. You
cannot have forgot the <HI>agnus castus</HI> we saw
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
in flower, the roots of which were moistened
with the water of the brook, and its stem and
branches perpetually surrounded with its
steams. The curate of the village likewise
assured, me that he had seen fishes in this same
brook. This fact I cannot certify. But I
saw fishes in one of the baths, the heat of
which raised the mercury to 48 and 50 de∣grees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage à la Nouvelle Guineé, par M. Sonnerat, Corre∣spondant de l' Academie Royale des sciences, et du Cabinet du Roi, p. 38. &amp;c.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>I know not whether fishes have ever been
found in our hot waters; but it is certain that
the bottom of the hottest of them is covered
with plants. M. l'Abbé Mazéas informs us,
that, in the almost boiling water in the Solfata∣ra
of Viterbe, the bottom of the basin is covered
with the same plants which grow at the bot∣toms
of lakes and ditches<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. des Savans étrangers, tom. 5. p. 325.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of Giants.</HEAD>
<P>From monuments which still remain, it ap∣pears,
that gigantic animals of different kinds
have formerly existed.</P>
<P>The large teeth with blunt knobs which I
formerly described, indicate the existence of an
animal, whose magnitude greatly surpassed that
of the elephant. But this gigantic species is
now entirely annihilated. Other large teeth,
the grinding face of which resembles spades on
<PB N="325" REF="332"/>
cards, like those of the hippopotamus, and
which are four times larger than the teeth of
the present hippopotamus, show that there has
been a very gigantic species of this animal. The
enormous thigh-bones, which far exceed the
dimensions of those of our elephants, demon∣strate
the same thing with regard to the elephant
species.</P>
<P>In the year 1772, there was found, near
Rome, a petrified head of an ox, which P. Jac∣quier
describes in the following manner. 'The
length of the front between the two horns, is
2 feet 3 inches; the distance between the or∣bits
of the eyes, 14 inches, and that from the
superior part of the front to the orbit of the
eye one foot six inches; the circumference of
the horn at the base, is one foot six inches; the
length of the horn four feet; and the di∣stance
between the ends of the horns three
feet. The internal part of this petrefaction
is extremely hard. This head was found at
Puzzolani more than 20 feet below the surface
of the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gazette de France du 25. Septembre 1772, <HI>Article d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rome.</HI></NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'In the year 1768, I saw, in the cathedral of
Strasburg, a large horn of an ox suspended by
a chain to a pillar near the choir. It appear∣ed
to be three times bigger than those of our
largest oxen. As it was hung very high, I
could not take the exact dimensions, but I
<PB N="326" REF="333"/>
judged it to be about 4½ feet long, and from
7 to 8 inches in diameter at the base<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon by M. Grignon, Sept. 24. 1777.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Lionel Waffer relates, that he saw, in Mexi∣co,
bones and teeth of a prodigious size: A∣mong
others, he saw a tooth 3 inches broad and
4 in length. Having consulted the most intel∣ligent
people of the country, they concluded
that the head could not be less than a yard
broad<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Waffer's travels in America, p. 367.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, the same head which Acosta
mentions: 'I saw,' says he, 'a grinder which
astonished me by its enormous size; for it was
as large as a man's fist.' P. Torquemado, a
Franciscan, relates, that he had in his possession
a grinder, twice as large as a man's fist, and
which weighed two pounds. He adds, that, in
the city of Mexico, and in the Convent of St
Augustine, he saw a thigh bone so large, that the
individual to which it belonged must have been
from 11 to 12 cubits high, <HI>i. e.</HI> 17 or 18 feet;
and that the head must have been as big
as one of the large pitchers used in Castille
for holding wine.</P>
<P>Phillippe Hernandés informs us, that there
were found, at Tezcaco and Tosuca, several
bones of an extraordinary magnitude; and that
among these there are grinding teeth five inches
broad and ten high; from which he concludes,
<PB N="327" REF="334"/>
that the size of the head must have been so e∣normous
that two men could not have embraced
it with their arms. Don Lorenzo Boturini Be∣naduci
likewise tells us, that, in New Spain, and
particularly in the heights of Santa fé, and in
the territories of Puebla and Ttlascala, they find
enormous bones, and grinders, one of which,
preserved in the Royal Cabinet, is a hundred
times larger than the largest human teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gigantologie Espagnole, par le P. Torrubia, Journal é∣tranger, Nov. 1760.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The author of this Gigantologie Espagnole
attributes these enormous teeth and bones to
giants of the human species. But, is it credible
that men ever existed whose heads were eight
or ten feet in circumference? Is it not equally
astonishing that, in the species of the hippopo∣tamus
or elephant, there have been individuals
of this magnitude? We are, therefore, led to
think, that these enormous teeth are of the same
kind with those lately found in Canada near the
river Ohio, which we ascribed to an unknown
animal, whose species formerly existed in Tar∣tary,
in Siberia, and in Canada, and which exten∣ded
from the Illionois as far as Mexico. As
the Spanish authors mention not that elephants
tusks were found in New Spain along with
these large grinders, it is probable that a species
different from that of the elephant formerly ex∣isted
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>
there, to which these large grinders be∣longed,
and that this species was diffused as far
as Mexico. Besides, the large teeth of the hip∣popotamus
seem to have been anciently known;
for St Augustine tells us, that he saw a grinder
so large, that, if divided, it would have made a
hundred teeth of an ordinary man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Civitate Dei, lib. 15. cap. 9.</NOTE>. Fulgosa
likewise remarks, that teeth were found in Sici∣ly,
each of which weighed three pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cap. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John Sommer relates, that he found, near Chat∣ham
in Canterbury, at the depth of seventeen
feet below the surface of the earth, monstrous
bones, some of them entire, and others broken.
He likewise found four entire teeth, each of
them weighing more than half a pound, and
nearly as large as a man's fist. The whole
four were grinders, and, except in magnitude,
they pretty much resembled human teeth. He
farther remarks, that Louis Vives mentions a
grinder still larger, which was shewn him for a
tooth of St Christopher. He adds, that Acosta
saw in India a similar tooth dug out of the earth,
along with several other bones, which, when ar∣ranged
in proper order, represented a man of
a monstrous stature. We might have formed
the same idea, says Mr Sommer, concerning the
teeth dug out of the earth near Canterbury, if
<PB N="329" REF="336"/>
bones had not been found in the same place,
which could not belong to the human species.
Several persons who examined these bones, jud∣ged
them to be the bones and teeth of the hip∣popotamus.
Two of these teeth are engraved
in the philosophical transactions, No. 272. fig. 9.</P>
<P>From these facts we may conclude, that most
of those large bones found under the surface of
the earth belong to the elephant and hippopota∣mus:
But it seems to be certain, that, by com∣paring
the enormous teeth with blunt knobs,
with those of the elephant and hippopotamus,
they have belonged to an animal much larger
than either, and that the species of this prodigi∣ous
animal no longer exists.</P>
<P>Among the present elephants it is extremely
rare to find a tusk of six feet in length. The
longest are generally from five to six and a half
feet; and, of course, the ancient elephant, which
produced a tusk of ten feet long, whose frag∣ments
are in our possession, was a gigantic spe∣cies.
The immense thigh-bone in the Royal
Cabinet confirms the same conclusions.</P>
<P>The same remark is applicable to the species
of the hippopotamus. I caused two of the lar∣gest
grinders to be extracted from the largest
head of the hippopotamus in the Royal Cabi∣net:
One of them weighed ten, and the other
nine and a half ounces. I then weighed two
teeth, the one found in Siberia, and the other in
<PB N="330" REF="337"/>
Canada. The first weighed two pounds twelve
ounces, and the second two pounds two ounces.
Hence these ancient hippopotamis were gigan∣tic
when compared with those now existing.</P>
<P>The example already given of the enormous
petrified head of an ox, found in the environs
of Rome, proves, that there have likewise been
prodigious giants in this species of quadruped,
which we are also enabled to show, by several
other monuments of antiquity. In the Royal
Cabinet, we have, 1. A fine greenish horn,
which is very smooth and well turned, and evi∣dently
belongs to the ox. The circumference
at the base is 25, and its length 42 inches. Its
cavity contains 11¼ Paris pints of liquor; 2.
The core, or internal bone of an ox's horn,
which weighs seven pounds; whilst the largest
core of the horns of our oxen exceeds not the
weight of one pound: This internal bone was
presented to the Royal Cabinet by M. le Comte
de Tressan, a man of taste, and a good Natural
historian; 3. Two internal bones of an ox's
horn attached to a portion of the crani∣um,
were found in beds of turf, at the depth
of 25 feet, between Amiens and Abbeville,
and transmitted to me for the Royal Cabinet.
The whole weighed 17 pounds; and each horn∣bone,
when separated from the cranium, weighed
at least 7½ pounds. I compared the dimensions,
as well as the weight of these different bones;
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
that of the largest ox to be found in Paris was
only 13 inches long, and 7 in circumference at
the base. But, of the two dug out of the earth,
the one was 24 inches long, and 12 in circum∣ference
at the base, and the other 27 inches
in length, and 13 in circumference. These facts
are more than sufficient to shew, that, in the
species of the ox, as well as in those of the hip∣popotamus
and elephant, prodigious giants have
formerly existed.</P>
<P>With regard to the human species, individu∣al
giants have been produced not only in Asia,
but in every climate; for, even in our own days,
we see gigantic men in every country. We
lately saw a giant who was born in Finland, on
the very confines of Lapland. But we are not
equally certain, that permanent races, and far
less entire nations of giants, ever existed. How∣ever,
the testimony of ancient authors, and e∣specially
those of Holy Writ, seem clearly to in∣dicate,
that races of giants formerly existed in
Asia. In the book of Numbers, chap. 13. verse
33. it is said, <HI>And there we saw giants, the
sons of Anak, which came of the giants: and we
were in our own sight as grashoppers, and so
we were in their sight.</HI> Though this descrip∣tion
may have the appearance of exaggeration,
which is common in the oriental style, it is
plain that these giants were very large.</P>
<P>In 2 Samuel, chap. 21. verse 20. a giant is
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
mentioned of the race and family of Goliah,
who had six fingers and toes on his hands and
feet: In the same book, there are several other
passages which prove the existence and de∣struction
of giants.</P>
<P>In Joshua, chap. 2. verse 22. it is said, that
<HI>there was none of</HI> the giants of the race <HI>of the
Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel;
only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there re∣mained.</HI></P>
<P>Philo, St Cyrillus, and several other authors,
seem to think, that the word <HI>giants</HI> means only
proud and impious men, and not men of an ex∣traordinary
stature. But there is no foundation
for this opinion; since the amazing height and
strength of these men are often described.</P>
<P>The prophet Amos informs us, that the Lord
<HI>destroyed the Amorite, whose height was like the
height of cedars, and he was strong as the oaks.</HI></P>
<P>Ogg, king of Bashan, was nine cubits high,
and Goliah ten cubits and one palm. Ogg's bed
was nine cubits, or thirteen and a half feet long,
and four cubits, or six feet, broad. The breast∣plate
of Goliah weighed 208 pounds 4 ounces,
and the blade of his lance 25 pounds.</P>
<P>These evidences are sufficient to prove, that
there formerly existed in the continent of Asia,
not only individuals, but races of giants, who
have been destroyed, and the last of whom ap∣peared
in the days of King David. Nature, who
<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
never loses any of her rights, sometimes re∣sumes
her former powers of production; for, in
almost every climate, men of an extraordinary
stature, <HI>i. e.</HI> of seven and a half, eight, and even
nine feet high, occasionally appear. Beside the
examples already given, many others are to be
found, both in ancient and modern authors, of
giants of ten, twelve, fifteen, and eighteen feet
high. But these last dimensions, I am persuaded,
ought to be greatly reduced. The bones of ele∣phants
have often been mistaken for human
bones. Besides, Nature, in her present appear∣ance,
presents no species with such great dispro∣portions,
except, perhaps, that of the hippo∣potamus;
for the teeth of those found in the
bowels of the earth are at least four times larger
than the teeth of the hippopotamus which now
exists.</P>
<P>The bones of the supposed king Teutobochus,
found in Dauphiny, gave rise to a dispute be∣tween
Habicot, a surgeon in Paris, and Riolan,
the favous anatomist. Habicot, in his <HI>Gigantoste∣ologie,</HI>
tells us, that these bones were taken out
of a brick sepulchre, 18 feet below ground, and
surrounded with sand. He neither gives an ex∣act
description, nor the number of these bones.
He asserts that they are human, because they
belonged to no other animal. He adds, that
some masons, when working to Seignio Lan∣gon,
a gentleman of Dauphiny, on the 11th
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
day of January 1613, discovered this tomb near
the ruins of the castle of Chaumont; that the
tomb was built with brick; that it was 30 feet
long, 12 broad, and 8 high; that is was covered
with a gray stone, on the middle of which was
engraved, <HI>Theutobochus rex</HI>; that, when the
tomb was opened, a human skeleton appeared,
which was 25½ feet long, 10 broad at the shoul∣ders,
and 5 thick; that, before touching these
bones, the head was measured, and it was 5 feet
in length, and 10 in circumference. Here it is
worthy of remark, that the proportion between
the length of a human head and that of the
body, is not a fifth, but a seventh and one half;
so that this head of 5 seet supposes the body to
have been 37½ feet in length. Lastly, Habicot
tells us, that the under jaw was 6 feet round,
and the orbits of the eyes 7 inches; that each
clavicle was 7 feet long; and that most of
these bones, after being exposed to the air, crum∣bled
into dust.</P>
<P>In the same year 1613, Dr Riolan published a
tract under the title of <HI>Gigantomachie,</HI> in which
he maintains, that Habicot, in his Gigantosteol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gle,
had given false measures of the body and bones
of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pretended giant Teutobochus; that Riolan
measured the thigh-bone and the bone of the
leg together with the astragalus joined to the
calcaneum; that they exceeded not 6½ feet, e∣ven
including the os pubis; and, of course, that
<PB N="335" REF="342"/>
the length of the giant could be only 13 feet,
instead of 25. He then gives his reasons for
denying these bones to be human; and con∣cludes,
that the bones exhibited by Habicot be∣long
not to man, but to the elephant.</P>
<P>A year after the publication of Habicot's
Gigantosteologie and Riolan's Gigantomachie, a
pamphlet appeared under the title of <HI>the Impos∣ture,
concerning supposed human bones falsely at∣tributed
to King Teutobochus, discovered.</HI> In
this pamphlet, the bones are denied to be human,
and supposed to have been engendered by some
virtue in the earth. Another pamphlet was
published without a name, in which it is said,
that, among these bones, some were human and
others not.</P>
<P>In 1618, Riolan published his <HI>Gigantologie,</HI> in
which he maintains, that the bones in question
were not only not human, but that men, in ge∣neral,
were never larger than they are at present.</P>
<P>In the same year, Habicot replied to Riolan:
He says, that he presented his Gigantosteologie
to Louis XIII.; that, about the end of July in the
year 1613, the bones mentioned in this work were
exposed to the eye of the public; and that they
are real human bones. He quotes a number of
examples from ancient and modern authors, to
prove that men of immense stature have existed.
He persists in maintaining, that the calcaneum,
tibia, and femur of the giant Teutobochus, when
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
joined to each other, were more than 11 feet in
length.</P>
<P>He next gives letters written to him at the
time these bones were discovered, and which
seem to confirm the reality both of the tomb
and of the bones of the giant Teutobochus.
From a letter written by Seignior de Langon,
dated St Marcellin, in Dauphiny, and another by
the Sieur Masurier, a surgeon at Beaurepaire, it
appears, that silver coins were found along with
the bones. The first letter contains the follow∣ing
passage: 'As his Majesty,' says Seignior de
Langon, 'is desirous of having the remaining
bones of King Teutobochus, and the silver coins
found in the tomb, I declare, that your adversaries
are ill informed, and that, if they knew the mat∣ter
more perfectly, they would not entertain
any doubts that these bones really belong to the
human species. The physicians of Montpellier
came here, and would have given any money
to purchase the bones. M. le Maréchal de
Lesdiguieres made them be carried to Gre∣noble;
and the physicians and surgeons of that
place recognised them to be human bones.
This fact, of course, can only be denied by
persons who are ignorant of the real circum∣stances.'</P>
<P>In this dispute, neither Riolan nor Habicot,
the one a physician and the other a surgeon,
have had sense enough to give an exact descrip∣tion
<PB N="337" REF="344"/>
of the bones in question. Both of them,
actuated by passion and a party-spirit, have
written in a style which destroys all confidence
in their assertions. Hence it is extremely dif∣ficult
to ascertain the species to which these
bones really belonged. But, if they were found
in a brick tomb, with a stone cover, upon which
the words <HI>Teutobochus Rex</HI> were inscribed; if
coins were found in this tomb; if it contained
but a single skeleton of 24 or 25 feet in length;
and, if Seignior Langon's letter relates nothing
but truth, the general fact, <HI>i. e.</HI> the existence of
a giant of 24 feet high, unless we should sup∣pose
a very extraordinary concourse of false∣hoods,
could not admit of a doubt. But the
fact is by no means proved, in a manner so ex∣plicit
as not to leave room for much hesitation.
It is true, that several authors, otherwise wor∣thy
of credit, have mentioned giants as large,
and even larger. Pliny relates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7. cap. 16.</NOTE>, that, by an
earthquake in Crete, a mountain was split, and
discovered a human body of 16 cubits long,
which some ascribed to that of Otus, and others
to that of Orion. 16 cubits are equal to 24
feet, which is the same length with the skeleton
of King Teutobochus.</P>
<P>In a Memoir of M. le Cat, an Academician
of Rouen, we have an enumeration of several
<PB N="338" REF="345"/>
giants of enormous magnitude, namely, two,
whose skeletons were found near Athens, of
which one was 36 and the other 34 feet high;
another of 30 feet was found in Sicily near Pa∣lermo,
in the year 1548; another of 33 feet
was likewise found in Sicily in the year 1550;
and another was also found in Sicily, near Ma∣zarino,
which was thirty feet long.</P>
<P>These testimonies notwithstanding, it is dif∣ficult
to believe that men of 30 or 36 feet high
ever existed: It is perhaps too much to believe
in the existence of giants of 24 feet high.
However, evidences multiply, become more po∣sitive,
and gradually increase, in proportion as
the dimensions decrease. M. le Cat relates, that,
in the year 1705, there was found, near the
banks of the river Morderi, at the foot of Mount
Crussol, the skeleton of a giant which measured
22½ feet; and that the Dominicans of Valen∣cia
have part of the tibia with the joint of the
knee.</P>
<P>Platerus, a celebrated physician, asserts, that
he saw at Lucerne the skeleton of a man, which
was 19 feet in length.</P>
<P>The giant Ferragus, slain by Rolland, nephew
to Charlemagne, was 18 feet high.</P>
<P>In the sepulchral caverns of the island of Te∣neriff,
a skeleton was found, which measured 15
feet, and in whose jaws were 80 teeth. These
three facts, as well as the preceding, are rela∣ted
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
in M. le Cat's essay concerning giants. He
mentions another skeleton found in a ditch near
the convent of the Dominicans at Rouen, the
skull of which held a bushel of corn, and the
bone of the leg was 4 feet long: The whole bo∣dy,
of course, must have been from 17 to 18
feet in length. Upon the tomb of this giant,
the following inscription was engraved: <HI>Here
lies the noble and puissant Seigniur le Chevalier
Ricon de Valmont, together with his bones.</HI></P>
<P>In the Journal Littéraire of Abbé Nazari,
we are told, that, in High Calabria, in the
month of July 1665, there was dug out of
the gardens of Signior de Tiviolo, a skele∣ton
of 18 Roman feet long; that the head was
2½ feet; that each grinder weighed about an
ounce and a third, and the other teeth three
quarters of an ounce; and that this skeleton
was bedded in a mass of bitumen.</P>
<P>Hector Boethius, in his history of Scotland,
relates, that the bones of a man, ironically call∣ed
<HI>Little John,</HI> are still preserved, who was
supposed to have been 14 feet high.</P>
<P>In the Journal des Savans, <HI>anno</HI> 1692, there
is a letter from P. Gentil, professor of philoso∣phy
at Angers, in which he says, that, having
been informed of a gigantic body discovered
nine leagues from the town of Lassé, he went
to the spot to satisfy himself concerning the truth
of the fact. He learned from the curate of the
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
place, that, in digging his garden, a sepulchre
was discovered which contained a body of 17
feet 2 inches long. There was no skin on the
body. This body had others between its arms
and legs, which might have been the person's
children. In the same place, there were disco∣vered
fourteen or fifteen other sepulchres, some
of them 10 feet, others 12, and others 14 feet
long, which contained bodies of the same di∣mensions.
The sepulchre of this giant continu∣ed
exposed to the air more than a year; but, as
it attracted too many visitors to the Curate, he
again covered it with earth, and planted three
trees in the place. These sepulchres were con∣structed
with a stone which resembled chalk.</P>
<P>Thomas Molineux saw, in a cabinet at Ley∣den,
a prodigious human frontal bone. From
its junction with the nose to the sagittal future, it
was 9 1/12 inches; its length was 12 2/10 inches, and
its thickness half an inch, <HI>i. e.</HI> in every dimen∣sion
it was double that of an ordinary frontal
bone. Hence the person to whom this gigan∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
bone belonged must have been twice the com∣mon
size of a man, or at least 11 feet high.
This bone was unquestionably human; and it
seemed not to have acquired this uncommon
magnitude by the effects of any disease; for its
thickness was exactly proportioned to its other
dimensions, which never happens in diseased
bones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Trans. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o 168. art. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="348"/>
M. Klein tells us, that he saw, in the cabinet
of M. Witreu at Amsterdam, a frontal bone,
from the dimensions of which it appeared, that
the person to whom it appertained must have
been 13 feet 4 inches high, <HI>i. e.</HI> about 12½
French feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. No 456. art. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After all these facts; I shall leave my readers
in the same embarrassment as myself, with re∣gard
to the real existence of giants of 24 feet
in length. I cannot persuade myself, that at a∣ny
time, or by any circumstances whatever,
the human body could be elevated to such im∣moderate
dimensions. But, at the same time,
it is unquestionable, that giants of 10, 12, and
perhaps even of 15 feet high, have existed;
and it is almost certain, that, in the primaeval
ages of Nature, not only gigantic individuals,
but even permanent and successive races of giants,
were produced, of which that of the Patagoni∣ans
is the only remaining example.</P>

<P>TO prove that some of the fishes and plants
found in coal and slate belong to species which
no longer exist, the Count de Buffon produces
the following facts and observations.</P>
<P>With regard to this subject, we shall remark,
with M. Lehman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 407.</NOTE>, that there are no impres∣sions
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
of plants in slate, except when it accom∣panies
pit-coal; and that, on the contrary, im∣pressions
of fishes are seldom found but in cop∣pery
slates.</P>
<P>It has likewise been remarked, that, in the
district of Mansfield, the beds of slate which
contain petrified fishes, are covered with a stra∣tum
of stones called <HI>stinking stones.</HI> This stra∣tum
is a species of gray slate, which has deri∣ved
its origin from stagnant water, where the
fishes had corrupted before they were petrified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roth, Journal O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomique, Juillet 1752.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Hoffman, when treating of slates, says,
that the petrified fishes found in these stones
have not only been living creatures, but that
the strata of slate have originated from muddy
water, which, after fermenting and petrifying,
subsided in thin laminae or beds.</P>
<P>'In the slate of Angers,' says M. Guettard,
there are sometimes impressions of plants and
fishes, which merit the greater attention, be∣cause
the impressions of the plants represent
marine <HI>fuci,</HI> or sea-wreck, and those of the
fishes represent different species of the crusta∣ceous
tribes, the impressions of which are
more rare than those of scaly fishes, or shells.
He adds, that, after consulting several authors
who treat of fishes and crustaceous animals,
he could not discover any of them that re∣sembled
<PB N="343" REF="350"/>
the impressions in question, except
the sea-louse, which has some resemblance to
them; but it has thirteen rings, and the im∣pressions
on the slates have only seven or eight:
The impressions of these fishes are generally
interspersed with a whitish pyritous substance.
It is remarkable, that, in the slates of Angers,
as well as in those of other countries, the im∣pressions
of fishes are frequent, and those of
shells are exceedingly rare, whilst the latter are
very common in lime-stone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1757, p. 52.</NOTE>.'</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>Many proofs might be given that all pit-coal
is composed of the spoils of vegetables, mixed
with bitumen and sulphur, or rather with the
vitriolic acid, which is perceived when the coal
is burning. We often find a great quantity of
vegetables in the upper strata of coal; and, in
proportion as we descend, we see traces of the
decomposition of the same vegetables. There
are species of coal which are nót fossil wood:
That found at Sainte-Agnés, near Lons-le-Sau∣nier,
has a perfect resemblance to logs or trunks
of fir, in which we distinctly perceive the marks
of each year's growth, as well as the pith.
These trunks differ only from common fir by
being somewhat oval, and by their rings being
concentric ellipses. They exceed not a foot in
circumference, and their bark is very thick and
full of furrows, like that of old firs. But the
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
bark of common firs, of the same size, is always
smooth.</P>
<P>'I found,' M. de Gensanne remarks, 'se∣veral
veins of this kind of coal in the diocese
of Montpellier: Here the trunks are very
large; their texture resembles that of chesnut∣trees
from three to four feet in circumference.
These fossils, when burning, have only a slight
odour of asphaltis. Their flame and embers
resemble those of wood. They are found
near the surface of the earth, and commonly
indicate the existence of real pit-coal at great∣er
depths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. du Languedoc, par M. de Gensanne, tom. 1. p. 20.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>These ligneous coals ought to be regarded as
wood deposited in a bituminous earth, from
which they derive their fossil quality. They
are found only in earths of this kind, and al∣ways
near the surface. They sometimes form
the stratum immediately above the seams of real
coal. Some of them, which have been impreg∣nated
with a small quantity only of bitumen, pre∣serve
the shades and colour of wood. 'I found
this species,' says M. de Gensanne, 'at Cazarets,
near Saint-Jean-de-Culcul, four leagues from
Montpellier. But, when broken, this fossil
commonly presents a smooth surface, perfectly
similar to that of jet. In the same canton,
near Aseras, there is fossil wood changed into
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
a white ferruginous pyrites. The mineral
matter occupies the heart of the wood; and
we distinctly perceive the woody substance
furrowed and partly dissolved by the mineral
acid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. du Languedoc, tom. 1. p. 54.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>After such proofs, related by M. de Gensanne
himself, who is otherwise a good mineralogist,
I acknowledge, that I was surprised to see him
ascribe the origin of coal to clay more or less
impregnated with bitumen. This notion is not
only refuted by his own facts, but we shall be
convinced by those I am about to relate, that we
ought to attribute the origin of every species of
coal to the spoils of vegetables mixed with bitu∣men.</P>
<P>I agree with M. de Gensanne, that neither
this fossil wood, nor turf, can be considered as
coal completely formed. That found near Lons
le-Saunier has been recently examined by the
President de Ruffey, a learned Academician of
Dijon: He remarks, that this fossil wood
makes a near approach to the nature of pit∣coal;
and that it is found within two or three
feet of the surface through an extent of two
leagues; that it is from three to four feet thick;
that we easily distinguish the species of wood
to be oaks, horn-beams, and trembling poplars;
that this wood is sometimes in the form of bun∣dles
or faggots; that the bark of the logs is well
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
preserved; that the annual circles, the cuts
made by the axes, and, at different distances, col∣lections
of chips, are plainly distinguishable;
that this wood converted into coal is excellent
for soldering iron; that, when burning, it dif∣fuses
a fetid odour; and that allum has been ex∣tracted
from it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. de Dijon, tom. 1. p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Near the village called <HI>Beichlitz,</HI> about a
league from the town of Halle, two strata,
composed of a bituminous earth and fossil
wood, (of which there are several mines in the
country of Hesse,) were discovered. It is simi∣lar
to that found in the village of Sainte-Ag∣nés
in Franche-comté, two leagues from
Lons-le-Saunier. This mine is in the territo∣ry
of Saxe. The first stratum lies at the depth
of three fathoms and a half, and is from eight
to nine feet thick. To arrive at it, we cut
through a white sand, then a whitish gray clay,
which is three feet thick: Still deeper, we
meet with a considerable thickness both of sand
and clay, which cover the second stratum.
This stratum is only from three and a half to
four feet thick. We sounded deeper, but
found no other strata of that kind.'</P>
<P>'These strata are horizontal; but they sink
or rise nearly in the same manner as common
strata. They consist of a brown bituminous
earth, which is friable when dry, and resem∣bles
<PB N="347" REF="354"/>
corrupted wood. Pieces of wood of all
sizes are found, which, when taken from the
mine, where they are soft, must be cut with an
ax. This wood, when dry, breaks easily.
When broke, it shines like bitumen; but
we distinctly perceive in it the whole organi∣zation
of wood. It is less abundant than the
bituminous earth, and the workmen lay it
aside for their own use.'</P>
<P>'A bushel or two quintals of bituminous
earth sells for eighteen or twenty French
sous. In these strata there are pyrites; they
are of a vitriolic nature; when exposed to the
air they effloresce and turn white: But the bi∣tuminous
matter is of little value, as it gives
but a feeble heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages Metalurgiques de M. Jars, p. 320.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Hence this species of fossil wood, found so
near the surface of the earth, must be a much
more recent production than common pit-coal,
which is almost constantly sunk very deep. But
this idea does not preclude the ancient coal from
being formed of the spoils of vegetables; since,
in the deepest coal-mines, we recognise woody
substances, and several characters which belong
to vegetables only. Besides, there are some ex∣amples
of fossil wood found in large masses, and
in extensive beds, under strata of free-stone and
calcarious rocks. Hence there is no other dif∣ference
<PB N="348" REF="355"/>
between real pit-coal and these charred
woods, but what arises from the degree of de∣composition,
and from a greater or smaller im∣pregnation with bitumen. The basis of their
substance is the same, and both derive their o∣rigin
from the spoils of vegetables.</P>
<P>M. le Monnier, one of the King's physicians,
and a learned botanist, found, in the schist, or
false slate, which traverses a large field of pit∣coal
in Auvergne, the impressions of several
ferns, almost the whole of which were un∣known
to him: He only thought, that he
could distinguish the impression of the leaves of
the osmund-royal, of which he saw but one ex∣ample
in all Auvergne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations de Hist. Nat. par M. le Monnier, p. 193.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It were to be wished that botanists would ex∣amine
more accurately the impressions of plants
found in pit-coal and in slate. The impressions
of plants, as well as those of crustaceous animals,
shells, and fishes, found in these minerals, should
be drawn and engraved; for all this labour is
necessary to enable us to determine the actual or
the past existence of these species, or even their
relative antiquity. At present, we are satisfied,
that most of them are unknown, and that, in
those which have been referred to known spe∣cies,
the differences are always so great as to
create hesitation.</P>

<PB N="349" REF="356"/>
<P>The Count de Buffon remarks, That the mo∣tion
of the waters from east to west has dimi∣nished
the surface of the earth on the west side;
and that, in every continent of the globe, the
declivity is more rapid on the west than on the
east coasts. This is evident in the continent
of America, the declivities of which are extreme∣ly
rapid and abrupt toward the western seas;
but, towards the eastern coasts, the lands stretch
by a gentle declivity, and generally terminate in
large plains. In Europe, the line that forms
the summit of Great Britain, which runs from
north to south, is much nearer the western than
the eastern ocean: For the same reason, the
seas to the west of Britain and Ireland are much
deeper than the sea which separates Britain and
Holland. The ridge of Norway is much near∣er
the ocean than the Baltic sea. The mountains
which form the general summit of Europe are
much higher toward the west than the east;
and, if we take a part of this summit, from
Switzerland to Siberia, it is much nearer the
Baltic and White Seas, than the Black Sea and
the Caspian. The Alps and Apennines are
nearer the Mediterranean than the Adriatic sea.
The chain of mountains which runs from Tirol
to Dalmatia, and as far as the Morea, in a man∣ner
skirts the Adriatic sea; but the opposite coasts
are much lower▪ In Asia, if we follow the
chain which extends from the Dardanelles to
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
the strait of Babelmandel, we shall find that the
summits of Mount Taurus, of Libanus, and of
all Arabia, skirt the Mediterranean and the Red
Seas; and that, to the east, there are vast terri∣tories
where the long coursed rivers run, and
at last empty themselves in the Persic Gulf.
The summit of the famous mountains of Gate
approaches nearer to the western than the east∣ern
seas. The ridge which extends from the
west frontiers of China to the point of Mallacca,
is nearer the west than the east sea. In Africa,
the chain of Mount Atlas sends rivers to the sea
of the Canaries, whose courses are much shorter
than those which run into the interior parts of
the Continent, and, after traversing vast tracts
of country, lose themselves in lakes or great
marshes. The high mountains to the west of
Cape Verd, and through all Guiney, after turning
ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Congo, join the mountains of the Moon,
and stretch as far as the Cape of Good Hope,
occupy pretty uniformly the middle of Africa:
We will perceive, however, on examining the
sea to the east and west, that the sea on the
east is not deep, and is interspersed with a great
number of islands; whilst, to the west, it is
deeper, and has but few islands; so that the
deepest places of the western sea are much near∣er
this chain of mountains than the deepest pla∣ces
of the eastern or Indian seas.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="358"/>
Hence we see that, in general, all the points
of partition in the great continents are always
nearer the west than the east seas; that the plains
of these continents are always lengthened to∣ward
the east, and shortened toward the west;
that the seas on the west coasts are deeper, and
have fewer islands than those on the east; and
that, in all these seas, the west coasts of the
islands are always higher, and the seas which
wash them deeper, than those on the east.</P>

<P>We are next told, that there are animals, and
even men, so brutish, that they rather languish
in the ungrateful soil where they were brought
forth, than take the trouble of removing to a
more comfortable situation. Of this, says the
Count de Buffon, I can give a striking exam∣ple:
The Maillés, a small savage nation in
Guiana, near the mouth of the river Ouassa,
have no other habitation than trees, upon which
they dwell during the whole year, because their
country is always more or less covered with
water. They never descend from these trees,
except when they go in canoes in quest of sub∣sistence.
This is a singular example of a stupid
attachment to a native country; for these sa∣vages,
in order to procure habitations on land,
have only to remove a few leagues from those
drowned savannahs which gave them birth, and
which they obstinately refuse to abandon. This
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
fact is mentioned by some voyagers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Maill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, one of the savage nations of Guiana, dwell along the coast. Their country is often covered with water.

been confirmed to me, by several witnesses, who
have lately seen this small nation, which consists
of three or four hundred savages. They keep
themselves above the water by means of the
trees. There they remain the whole year. Du∣ring
the eight or nine rainy months, their coun∣try
is a large sheet of water; and, during the
four summer months, their soil consists of a
dirty mud, upon which a crust of five or six
inches thick is formed. This crust is rather
composed of herbage than of earth, under which
is a considerable depth of stagnant and stinking
water.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The Caspian Sea, the Count de Buffon re∣marks,
was formerly much larger than it is at
present.—'In traversing,' says M. Pallas, 'the
immense deserts which lie between the Wolga,
the Jaïk, the Caspian Sea, and the Don, I ob∣served,
that these <HI>steppes</HI> or sandy deserts, are
every way surrounded with an elevated border,
which embraces a great part of the beds of the
Jaïk, Wolga, and Don; and that these deep
rivers, before they penetrated this inclosing
belt, were full of islands and shoals, till they
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
began to fall into the deserts where the great
river Kuman loses itself in the sands. From
these observations I conclude, that the <HI>Caspian
Sea has formerly covered all these deserts</HI>; that
it anciently had no other margins than those
elevated belts which every where surround the
deserts; and that it has communicated, by
means of the Don, with the Black Sea, even
supposing this sea, as well as that of Azoff, had
never made a part of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal Historique et politique, mois de Novembre 1773, Art. Petersbourg.</NOTE>.'</P>

<P>There have been greater and more frequent
revolutions in the Indian ocean than in any o∣ther
part of the globe. But, says the Count de
Buffon, tradition has only handed down to us
the submersion of Taprobana.—The most an∣cient
tradition we have of the sinking of coun∣tries
in the south is that of the loss of Taprobana,
of which the Maldivas and Laquedivas are sup∣posed
to have been formerly a part. These
islands, as well as the rocks and banks which
prevail from Madagascar to the point of India,
<PB N="354" REF="361"/>
seem to indicate the summits of countries that
united Africa to Asia; for almost all of these
islands have, on the north side, lands and banks
which stretch very far under the waters.</P>
<P>It likewise appears, that the islands of Mada∣gascar
and Ceylon were formerly united to the
adjacent continents. Most of these separations
and revolutions in the southern seas have been
produced by the sinking of caverns, by earth∣quakes,
and by explosions of subterraneous fires.
But lands have also been carried off by the slow
and gradual movement of the waters from east
to west. The places where these effects are most
apparent are the regions of Japan, of China, and
of all the eastern parts of Asia. The seas situ∣ated
to the west of China and Japan seem to be
accidental productions, and perhaps more recent
than our Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The islands of Sunda, the Moluccas, and the
Philippines, present nothing but countries which
have been overturned; and they are still full of
volcano's. There are many volcano's in the
Japanese islands; and Japan is reputed to be
more subject to earthquakes than any other part
of the globe: It also gives rise to a number of
hot fountains. The greater part of the islands
in the Indian ocean present only peaks or sum∣mits
of detached mountains, which continually
vomit fire. The isles of France and Bourbon
appear to be two of these summits: They are
<PB N="355" REF="362"/>
almost entirely covered with matters rejected by
volcano's. These two islands, when first disco∣vered,
were uninhabited.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>In Guiana, our author remarks, the rivers
are so near each other, and at the same time so
swelled and rapid during the rainy season, that
they carry down immense quantities of mud,
and deposit them on all the low grounds and on
the bottom of the sea. The coasts of French
Guiana are so low, that they may rather be re∣garded
as beaches totally covered with mud, and
having an almost imperceptible declivity. This
mud extends to a great distance at the bottom
of the sea. Large vessels cannot approach the
river Cayenne without striking; and ships of
war are obliged to remain two or three leagues
from the land. This mud extends along the
whole margin of the sea from Cayenne to the
river of the Amazones. In this great extent of
mud there is no sand, and berry-bearing alders
are frequent all along the coast. But, seven or
eight leagues above Cayenne, westward as far
as the river Marony, we find some creeks, the
bottoms of which consist of sand and rocks,
which give rise to breakers. The mud, how∣ever,
covers the greater part of these rocks, as
well as the beds of sand; and it is thicker in pro∣portion
as it recedes from the margin of the sea.
These small rocks prevent not the ground from
<PB N="356" REF="363"/>
having a very gentle descent for several leagues
on land. This part of Guiana, which, to the
north-west of Cayenne, is more elevated than
the lands to the south-east. Of this fact we
have good evidence; for all along the borders
of the sea, we find large drowned savannahs,
most of which are dry in the north-west, whilst
they are totally covered with sea-water in the
south-east parts. Beside these lands actually
drowned by the sea, there are others more dis∣tant,
which have likewise been formerly drown∣ed.
In some places we also find savannahs of
fresh water; but they produce no alders, but
many palm-trees. On all these low coasts, not
a stone is to be seen. The tide rises seven or
eight feet, though it is opposed by the currents;
for they are all directed toward the Antilles.
When the waters of the rivers are low, the tide
is very perceptible, as high up the rivers as forty
and even fifty leagues. But, during the rainy
season, when the rivers are swelled, the tide is
scarcely perceptible at the distance of a league
or two, so great is the rapidity of the waters;
and their impetuosity is greatest during the re∣flux.</P>
<P>Upon the sandy bottoms of these creeks, the
sea-turtles deposit their eggs; and they never
frequent the muddy places; so that, from Cay∣enne
to the river of the Amazones, there are no
turtles; and the people go to fish them from
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
the river Courou to the Marony. The mud ap∣pears
to gain ground daily on the sand; and,
in the progress of time, the north-west coast of
Cayenne will be covered with it as well as
the south-east; for the turtles, who will deposit
their eggs in sand only, gradually retire from
the river Courou; and, for some years past, the
fishers are obliged to search for them near the
river Marony, the sands of which are not yet
covered.</P>
<P>Beyond the savannahs, some of which are
dry and others drowned, there is a chain of hills
that are all covered with a great depth of earth,
and every where planted with forests. These
hills are generally from 350 to 400 feet high.
But, about ten or twelve leagues farther up the
country, they are perhaps double this height.
Most of these mountains are evidently extin∣guished
volcano's. At the top of one of them,
called <HI>la Gabrielle,</HI> there is a small lake, in which
are a number of alligators, whose species seems
to have been preserved from the time that the
sea covered this hill.</P>
<P>Beyond Mount Gabrielle, we find only small
valleys, little hills, and volcanic matters, not in
large masses, but in small blocks. The most
common stone, blocks of which are carried down
by the waters as far as Cayenne, is that called
<HI>beetle-stone.</HI> It is not a stone, but the lava of
a volcano. It has received the name of <HI>beetle-stone,</HI>

which proceed from the annual meltings of
the snow, freeze in every direction, and on all the
points of the mountains from their bases to their
summits, and especially in the valleys, and on
the declivities of those that are collected to∣gether
in groups: In this manner, the waters
have formed in these valleys some mountains
which have rocks for their nucleus, and others
that consist entirely of ice: These mountains
are six, seven, and even eight leagues long by
one in breadth, and often from a thousand, to
twelve hundred fathoms high. These enor∣mous
masses of ice are continually extending
farther along the valleys; for though, in warm
and rainy seasons, their progress is not only
stopped, but their size diminished, the magni∣tude
of the glaciers is perpetually augmenting.</P>
<P>Under the equator, the point of congelation,
in detached mountains, is fixed at the height of
2440 fathoms. But this is no rule for groups
of mountains which are frozen from their sum∣mits
to their base, and never thaw. In the Alps,
<PB N="359" REF="366"/>
the point of congelation in detached mountains
is ascertained to be at the height of 1500 fathoms,
and all below this point thaws completely. But
those which are grouped together freeze at a
smaller height, and thaw from their top to their
base; which shows how much the degree of
cold is augmented by immense masses of congeal∣ed
matter confined within a narrow compass.</P>
<P>The whole frozen mountains of Switzerland,
when taken together, occupy an extent of 66
leagues from east to west, measured in a straight
line from the western borders of the canton of
Vallis towards Savoy, to the eastern borders of
the canton of Bendner towards Tirol. They
form an interrupted chain, several arms of which
extend, from north to south, about 36 leagues.
The great Gothard, the Fourk, and the Grim∣sel,
are the highest mountains in this quarter:
They occupy the center of those chains which
divide Switzerland into two parts. They are
perpetually covered with snow and ice; from
which circumstance they have received the ge∣neral
denomination of <HI>Glaciers.</HI></P>
<P>The glaciers are divided into frozen moun∣tains,
valleys of ice, fields of ice or frozen seas,
and <HI>gletchers,</HI> or heaps of icy flakes or plates.</P>
<P>The frozen mountains are those immense mas∣ses
of rocks which reach the clouds, and are
perpetually covered with ice and snow.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="367"/>
The valleys of ice are those depressions be∣tween
the mountains which are much more e∣levated
than the inhabited valleys. They are
always filled with snow, which accumulates,
and forms masses of ice several leagues in length.
These masses join the high mountains.</P>
<P>The fields of ice, or frozen seas, which lie
along the mountains, have a gentle declivity.
They cannot be called valleys, because they are
not sufficiently depressed. They are covered
with a great thickness of snow. These fields
receive water from the melting of the snow,
which descends from the mountains, and after∣wards
freeze. The surface of these fields alter∣nately
melts and freezes; and the whole are
covered with thick beds of snow and ice.</P>
<P>The gletchers are heaps of slakes or plates of
ice formed by the snows, and precipitated from
the mountains. These snows freeze again, and
are interwoven in various manners: This cir∣cumstance
has given rise to the division of glet∣chers
into mounts, mantlings, and walls of ice.</P>
<P>The mounts of ice rise between the summits
of the high mountains: They themselves form
mountains; but they contain no rocks. They
are composed entirely of ice, and are sometimes
several leagues in length, one league broad, and
half a league thick.</P>
<P>The mantlings are formed in the superior
valleys, and upon the sides of the mountains,
<PB N="361" REF="368"/>
which are covered with ice, having folds resem∣bling
drapery: They send their superfluous wa∣ters
into the lower valleys.</P>
<P>The walls of ice are rugged mantlings which
terminate the flat valleys, and appear, at a di∣stance,
like troubled seas, whose waves have
been suddenly arrested and frozen. These walls
consist not of irregular points: They often form
columns, pyramids, and enormous towers compo∣sed
of several sides. These towers are sometimes
hexagonal, and of a blue or greenish colour.</P>
<P>On the sides, and at the foot of the moun∣tains,
masses of snow are formed, which are af∣terwards
moistened with the water from the
melted snows, and then covered with fresh ac∣cumulations.
We likewise see plates of ice col∣lected
in heaps, which belong neither to the fro∣zen
valleys nor the mountains of ice. Their
position is either horizontal or inclined. These
detached heaps are called <HI>beds</HI> or <HI>strata</HI> of ice.</P>
<P>Several of these mountains of ice are undermi∣ned
by the interior heat of the earth, which
gives rise to currents of water that melts their
inferior surfaces. They then, by their own
weight, sink insensibly, and their height is re∣stored
by the waters, snow, and ice, which a∣gain
successively cover them. These sinkings
often produce horrible crashings. The crevices
which open in the ice form precipices which are
both numerous and full of danger. These a∣bysses
<PB N="362" REF="369"/>
are the more treacherous and baneful, be∣cause
they are generally covered with snow.
Travellers, and hunters who chase the fallow∣deer,
the chamois goat, &amp;c. or those who search
for crystals, are often swallowed up by these
gulfs, and again thrown upon the surface by
the waters which run at their bottoms.</P>
<P>Gentle rain quickly dissolves snows: But all
the water which proceeds from them falls not
into these gulfs. A great part of it freezes on
the surface of the ice and augments its volume.</P>
<P>The warm south winds, which generally pre∣vail
in the month of May, are the most power∣ful
agents in destroying the snows and ice.
Their melting is announced by the crashing of the
frozen lakes, and the dreadful noise produced
by the shock of stones and ice, which in hor∣rible
confusion roll down from the tops of the
mountains, and by torrents of water that fall
from the rocks of more than 1200 feet high.</P>
<P>The heat of the sun has little effect upon the
snow and ice. Experience has proved, that ice
which has existed a long time under an enor∣mous
weight, and in accumulated degrees of
cold, is so dense and so completely deprived of
air, that, when small pieces of it are exposed to
the greatest heat of the sun, during a whole
day, they scarcely melt.</P>
<P>Though the glaciers melt partially every sum∣mer,
though the winds and the heat of certain
<PB N="363" REF="370"/>
years destroy the accumulation of several pre∣ceding
years; yet it is certain, that these <HI>gla∣ciers
constantly augment in all their dimensions.</HI>
This fact is ascertained by the annals of the
country, by authentic deeds, and by invariable
tradition. Independent of these authorities, and
of daily observation, the progressive increase
of the glaciers is proved by <HI>forests of trees
which have been absorbed by the ice, some of
whose tops still appear above the surface of the
glaciers</HI>: These, as well as <HI>the tops of steeples
belonging to a village</HI> that had been buried un∣der
the snows, and which are still visible after
uncommon meltings, are irrefragable evidences
of the gradual progress of the glaciers. This
progression can proceed from no other cause
than an augmentation in the degree of cold,
which increases in proportion to the masses of
accumulated ice. It is likewise certain, that, in
the glaciers of Switzerland, the cold is at pre∣sent
more intense, though it continues shorter,
than in Iceland, the glaciers of which, as
well as those of Norway, have a great relation to
those of Switzerland.</P>
<P>The substance of the frozen mountains of
Switzerland is similar to that of all other high
mountains. The nucleus is a vitreous rock
which reaches to their summit. The parts be∣low,
which had been covered with the ocean,
are composed of calcarious stone, as well as the
<PB N="364" REF="371"/>
whole substance of the mountains of an inferior
order, which are disposed in groups at the foot
of the primitive glacier mountains. Lastly, these
calcarious masses have slate, produced by the
sediments of the waters, for their basis.</P>
<P>The vitreous masses are pure rock, granite,
and quartz. Their fissures are filled with me∣tals,
semi-metals, mineral substances, and crys∣tals.</P>
<P>The calcarious masses are lime-stone, marbles
of every species, chalk, gypsum, spar, alabaster,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The slaty masses consist of slates of various
qualities and colours, which contain plants and
fishes, and are often situated at considerable
heights. Their strata are not always horizon∣tal.
They are often inclined, sometimes sinua∣ted,
and in particular places perpendicular.</P>
<P>We cannot entertain a doubt concerning the
ancient abode of the sea upon the glacier moun∣tains.
The immense quantity of shells, as well as
the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate and other similar stones, found in these
mountains, fully ascertain this point. These
shells are either distributed in tribes, or different
species are blended together, and they are found
at very great heights.</P>
<P>It is probable, that, at a very remote period,
the glaciers had not been formed on these moun∣tains,
not even when the ocean abandoned
them; though it appears by their great distance
<PB N="365" REF="372"/>
from the sea, which is near a hundred leagues,
and by their excessive height, that they were the
first that arose above the water in the Con∣tinent
of Europe. They have likewise had their
volcano's. Mount Myssenberg, in the canton
of Schwitz, seems to have been the last volcano
that was extinguished. The two principal sum∣mits,
which are very high and detached, termi∣nate
in cones, like all the mouths of volcano's;
and we still see the crater of one of these cones,
which is very deep.</P>
<P>M. Bourrit, who had the courage to make a
number of expeditions in the glaciers of Savoy,
remarks, 'That the increase of all the glaciers in
the Alps is unquestionable; that the quantity
of snow that falls during the winters far surpas∣ses
that which melts in the summers; that the
same cause not only subsists, but the masses of
snow already formed must always augment,
because this effect is a necessary result of that
cause. Hence the glaciers must always continue
to have a progressive increase<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des glaciers de Savoie, par M. Bourrit, p. 111. 112.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The same indefatigable observer, when treat∣ing
of the <HI>glatchers</HI> or glaciers with prominent
points, says, 'that they appear to augment
daily; that the ground they now occupy was
some years ago a cultivated field; and that the
ice still continues to augment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descript. des aspects du Mont Blanc, par le même, p. 8.</NOTE>.' He relates,
<PB N="366" REF="373"/>
that the growth of the ice is evident, not on∣ly
in this place, but in several others; that the
inhabitants remembered a former communi∣cation
between Chamounis and Val-d'Aost,
which is now totally shut up by the ice; that
the ice, in general, must have first accumulated
by stretching from summit to summit, and then
from one valley to another; and that, in this
manner, a communication has been formed
between the ice of Mount Blanc and those of
the other mountains of Vallais and of Swit∣zerland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. des aspects du Mont Blanc, par M. Bourrit, p. 13. et 14.</NOTE>.
It appears,' says he, 'that all these
mountainous countries were not anciently so
much filled with ice and snow as they are at
present. . . It is only a few centuries
since various calamities have been occasioned
by the accumulation of snows and ice, in seve∣ral
valleys, and by the precipitation of moun∣tains
and rocks. It is only from these acci∣dents,
which are very frequent, and from the
annual accumulations of the ice, that we are
enabled to account for what history relates
concerning the ancient inhabitants of this coun∣try<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 62. et 63.</NOTE>.'</P>

<HEAD>Of the North-East passage.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding what has been advanced by
the Russians, it is extremely doubtful that they
ever doubled the northern point of Asia. M.
Engel, who regards the north-west passage by
Hudson's and Baffin's bay, as impossible, ap∣pears,
on the contrary, to be persuaded, that a
shorter and more certain passage will be found
by the north-east. To the feeble reasons he
gives in support of this opinion, he adds a re∣mark
of M. Gmelin, who, when speaking of
the experiments made by the Russians, in order
to discover this north-east passage, says, 'that
the manner in which they proceeded in ma∣king
these discoveries will astonish the whole
world, after an authentic relation of them
shall be made public, which depends solely
on the pleasure of the Empress.'—'There
can be nothing astonishing,' says M. En∣gel,
'in this subject, except it be to learn that
a passage, which was formerly regarded as im∣possible,
is now found to be extremely practi∣cable.
This is the only fact,' he adds, 'which
can surprise those whom the Russians have
endeavoured to terrify by relations published
for the purpose of repelling navigators from
the attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 19. p. 415.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="375"/>
I shall, in the first place, remark, that we
ought to be well ascertained with regard to
facts, before we throw an imputation of this
kind upon the Russian empire. In the second
place, the remark seems to be ill founded; for
the words employed by M. Gmelin may admit
of an opposite interpretation from that given of
them by M. Engel, namely, That we will be a∣stonished
when we shall learn that no practi∣cable
passage exists by the north-east. Indepen∣dent
of the general reasons I have given, I am
confirmed in this opinion by the following cir∣cumstance:
The Russians themselves, in their
late experiments, uniformly ascend by Kampt∣schatka,
and never descend by the point of Asia.
Captains Bering and Tschirikow, in the year
1741, reconnoitered the coast of America as far
as the 59th degree; but neither of them sailed
northward along the coasts of Asia. This fact
is a sufficient proof, that the passage is not so
practicable as M. Engel supposes; or rather,
that the Russians are satisfied that it is not prac∣ticable;
for, if otherwise, their navigators would
have been sent by this route, instead of making
them take their departure from Kamptschatka,
in order to discover the west of America.</P>
<P>M. Muller, who was sent by the Empress, a∣long
with M. Gmelin, to Siberia, is of a very
different opinion from M. Engel. After compa∣ring
all the relations on this subject, M. Muller
<PB N="369" REF="376"/>
concludes by remarking, that there is only a ve∣ry
small separation between Asia and America;
and that this strait contains several islands,
which serve as common stations to the inhabi∣tans
of both continents. This opinion, I believe,
is well founded; and, in support of it, M.
Muller has collected a great number of facts.
In the subterraneous abodes of the inhabitants
of the island of Karaga, we see beams made of
large pines, which neither this island, nor the
adjacent countries of Kamtschatka, produce.
The inhabitants say, that this wood is driven
upon their coasts by the east wind. On the
coasts of Kamtschatka, boards of ice are dri∣ven,
for several days together, during the win∣ter.
At certain seasons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lights of birds arrive,
and, after staying some months, return to the
east, from whence they came. Hence the con∣tinent
opposite to that of Asia, toward the
north, descends as far as Kamtschatka. This
continent must be the west of America. M.
Muller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 484.</NOTE>, after giving an abridgement of five or
six voyages attempted by the north sea, with a
view to double the north point of Asia, con∣cludes,
that every circumstance announces the
impossibility of this navigation, which he
proves by the following arguments. This na∣vigation
must be performed in summer: The
distance from Archangel to the Oby, and from
<PB N="370" REF="377"/>
this river to Jenisey, requires a whole season.
The passage by Waygait has cost infinite labour
to the British and Dutch. In going through
this icy strait, we meet with islands which block
up the road; and the continent, which forms
a cape between the rivers Piasida and Chatanga,
and advances beyond the 76th degree of latitude,
is likewise bordered with a chain of islands,
which scarcely leave a passage for navigation.
If we want to remove from the coasts, and
to reach the open sea toward the Pole, the al∣most
immoveable mountains of ice found at
Greenland and Spitzbergen, seem to indicate a
continuity of ice as far as the Pole. If we want
to go along the coasts, <HI>this navigation is more
difficult now than it was a hundred years ago.</HI>
There the waters of the ocean are sensibly di∣minished:
We still see, at a distance from the
shoals along the Frozen Sea, wood that had been
thrown upon the lands which formerly bounded
the ocean. These shoals have so little depth,
that very flat boats can alone be used in them:
such boats are too weak to resist the ice; neither
can they contain provisions sufficient for a long
navigation. Though the Russians have resour∣ces
for sailing these cold seas superior to those of
most other European nations, yet in none of the
voyages attempted upon the Frozen Sea has a
passage been discovered between Europe or Asia
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o America. It is only by departing from
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
Kamtschatka, or some other more easterly point
of Asia, that the westerly coasts of America have
ever been discovered.</P>
<P>Captain Bering took his departure from port
Awatscha in Kamtschatka, on the 4th day of
June 1741. After sailing south-east, and then
north-east, he discovered, on the 18th of July,
the continent of America in latitude 58° 28′.
Two days after, he anchored near an island in
the mouth of a bay, from whence he discovered
two capes, the one to the east he called Saint-Elie,
and the other to the west Saint-Hermo∣gene.
He then dispatched Chitrou, one of his of∣ficers,
to reconnoitre the gulf which he had en∣tered:
They found that it was interspersed with
islands, on one of which they saw deserted cabins
made of planks well joined, and even chamfer∣ed.
They conjectured that this island might
have been inhabited by some people from the
continent of America. M. Steller, who was
sent to make observations on these new discover∣ed
lands, found a cave, in which were a quan∣tity
of smoked salmon, ropes, furniture, and o∣ther
utensils. Advancing still farther, he saw
the Americans flying from him. He next per∣ceived
a fire on a distant hill. The savages had
unquestionably retired thither: A rugged and
steep rock covered their retreat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 19. p. 371.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="379"/>
After relating these facts, it is easy to perceive,
that it is only by taking their departure from
Kamtschatka that the Russians can carry on
commerce with China and Japan, and that it is
equally difficult, if not impossible, for the other
nations of Europe to pass by the north-east seas,
the greater part of which are entirely frozen.
Hence I cannot hesitate in repeating, that the
only possible passage is by the north-west, at
the bottom of Hudson's bay, and that this is
the place where all future attempts to discover
this useful passage ought to be made.</P>
<P>After the preceding sheets had been printed,
I received from M. le Comte Schouvaloff, that
great statesman whom all Europe esteems and
respects, an excellent memoir composed by M.
de Domascheneff, president of the Imperial So∣ciety
of Petersourg, and to whom the Empress
has assigned the department of every thing re∣lating
to arts and sciences. This illustrious per∣son
has likewise sent me a copy of the chart
drawn by the pilot Otcheredin, in which are
represented the tracks and discoveries he made
in the years 1770 and 1773, between Kamt∣schatka
and the continent of America. M. de
Domascheneff, in his memoir, remarks, that
this chart of the pilot Otcheredin is most exact,
and that the one published in the year 1773 by
the Academy of Petersburg, requires several a∣mendments,
especially with regard to the posi∣tion
<PB N="373" REF="380"/>
of the islands and the pretended Archipelago,
which are represented between the Aleutes or
Aleoutes islands, and those of Anadir, otherwise
called Andrien. The chart of Otcheredin seems
to show, that these two groups of islands, the
Aleutes and the islands of Andrien, are separa∣ted
by an open sea of more than a hundred
leagues broad. M. de Domascheneff assures us,
that the great general chart of the Russian em∣pire,
published in the year 1777, gives an accu∣rate
representation of all the coasts on the nor∣thern
extremity of Asia inhabited by the Tschut∣chis:
He says, that this chart was executed from
the most recent discoveries made in the last ex∣pedition
of Major Pawluzki against that people.
'This coast,' says M. de Domascheneff, 'bounds
the great chain of mountains which separate
Siberia from the south of Asia, and terminates
by dividing itself between the chain that stretch∣es
through Kamtschatka, and those which
occupy the territories between the rivers that
run to the east of the Lena. The known
islands between the coasts of Kamtschatka and
those of America are mountainous, as well as
the coasts of Kamtschatka and those of the
continent of America. Hence there is a distinct
continuation between the chains of mountains
belonging to both continents, the intervals of
which, perhaps less considerable formerly, may
have been enlarged by the decaying of rocks,
<PB N="374" REF="381"/>
by the perpetual currents which run from the
Frozen Sea toward the southern ocean, and by
the revolutions which the earth has undergone.'</P>
<P>But this sub-marine chain which joins the lands
of Kamtschatka to those of America is more
southerly, by seven or eight degrees, than that
of the islands of Anadir or Andrien, which,
from time immemorial, have served the Tschuts∣chis
as a passage to America.</P>
<P>According to M. de Domascheneff, it is cer∣tain,
that this voyage from the point of Asia to
the continent of America, is performed by oars,
and that these people go there to dispose of Rus∣sian
iron-works to the Americans; that the
islands in this passage are so frequent, that the
sailors may sleep every night on land; and that
the continent of America, with which the
Tschutschis traffick, is mountainous, and covered
with forests, which are full of foxes, martins,
and sables, the qualities and colours of whose
furs are totally different from those of Siberia.
These northern islands, situated between the
two continents, are known to the Tschutschis
only. They form a chain between the most eas∣tern
point of Asia and the continent of America,
under the 64th degree of latitude; and this chain
is divided by an open sea, from the other more
southern chain formerly mentioned, which lies
between Kamtschatka and America, and is under
the 56th degree. The islands of this second chain
<PB N="375" REF="382"/>
the Russians and inhabitants of Kamtschat∣ka
frequent in quest of sea-otters, and black
foxes, whose furs are very precious. Before
the year 1750, even the most eastern of the
islands which compose this chain were known.
One of these islands bears the name of Captain
Bering, and another, adjacent to the former, is
called the island of Medenoi. We next meet
with the islands of Aleutes or Aleoutes. The
two first are situated a little above, and the last a
little below the 55th degree of latitude. About
the 56th degree, we find the islands of Atkhou
and Amlaïgh, which are the first of the chain
called the Islands of Foxes: They extend as far
to the north-east as the 61st degree of latitude.
These islands have received their denomination
from the prodigious number of foxes found in
them. The two islands of Captain Bering and
Medenoi were uninhabited when first discovered.
But, in the islands of Aleutes, though advanced
farther to the east, more than sixty families were
found, whose language had no relation either
to that of Kamtschatka or to any of the ori∣ental
languages of Asia: It is a dialogue of the
language spoken in the other islands adjacent to
America, which seems to indicate that they have
been peopled by the Americans, and not by the
Asiatics.</P>
<P>The islands called by Captain Bering's crew
Saint-Julian, Saint-Theodor, and Saint-Abra∣ham,
<PB N="376" REF="383"/>
are the same with those which now re∣ceive
the name of Aleutes. In the same man∣ner,
the islands of Chommaghin and Saint-Dol∣mat,
discovered by this navigator, form a part
of those now called the Islands of Foxes.</P>
<P>'The great distance,' says M. de Domasche∣neff,
'and the open and deep sea between the
islands of Aleutes and those of Foxes, joined
to the different direction of the latter, render
it probable, that these islands never formed one
continued chain, but that the former, with
those of Medenoi and Bering, make a chain
which comes from Kamtschatka; that the
Islands of Foxes exhibit another passage to
America; and that both of these chains generally
loss themselves in the depth of the ocean, and
are promontories to the two continents. The
course of the Islands of Foxes, some of which
are of great extent, is intermixed with rocks
and breakers, and continues without interrup∣tion
as far as the continent of America. But
these most adjacent to this continent are very
little frequented by the Russian hunters; be∣cause
they are very populous, and it would be
dangerous to sojourn in them. There are se∣veral
islands in the neighbourhood of America
which are still little known. Some ships, how∣ever,
have penetrated as far as the island of
Kadjack, which is very near the continent
of America. We are assured of this fact by the
<PB N="377" REF="384"/>
relation of the islanders; and other circum∣stances
confirm the truth of their assertion: All
the islands that lie more to the west, produce
only dwarfish and mis-shapen shrubs, which
the winds from the open sea prevent from ri∣sing
higher. The island of Kadjack, on the con∣trary,
and the small adjacent islands, produce
groves of alder-trees, which seem to indicate
that they are less exposed, and that they are
sheltered on the north and east by a neigh∣bouring
continent. Besides, in Kadjack, we
find fresh water otters, which appear not
in the other islands; and we likewise find a
small species of marmot, which seems to be the
marmot of Canada. Lastly, we discover, in
that island, traces of the bear and wolf; and
the inhabitans clothe themselves with rain∣deers
skins brought to them from the conti∣nent
of America, to which they lie very con∣tiguous.'</P>
<P>'From a voyage to the island of Kadjack, con∣ducted
by one Geottof, we learn, that the con∣tinent
of America is called <HI>Atakthan</HI> by the
islanders: They say, that this great land is
mountainous and covered with forests; that
it is situated to the north of their island; and
that the mouth of a great river there goes by
the name of <HI>Alaghschak.</HI> Besides, it is un∣questionable,
that Bering, as well as Tschiri∣kow,
actually reached this great continent;
<PB N="378" REF="385"/>
for, at Cape Elie, where Bering moored his
frigate, they saw the coast rise into a chain
of mountains which were covered with thick
forests. The soil was of a nature totally dif∣ferent
from that of Kamtschatka; and Steller
collected a number of American plants.'</P>
<P>M. de Domascheneff farther observes, that all the
Islands of Foxes, as well as those of Aleutes
and Bering, are mountainous; that their coasts
are rocky, often terminate in precipices, and
are surrounded to a considerable distance with
rocks; that the country rises, from the coasts
to the middle of these islands, into rugged
mountains, which form small chains through
the whole length of each island. Besides, there
have been, and still are, volcano's in several of
these islands; and in those where the volcano's
are extinguished, there are fountains of hot
water. In the islands with the volcano's, no
metals are found, but only calcedons and
some other coloured stones of no value. In these
islands, the inhabitants have no other wood but
what is floated into them by the sea, and the
quantity is not great. More wood arrives in
the island of Bering and the Aleutes. This
floated wood seems to come from the south;
for the camphor tree of Japan has been found
on the coasts of these islands.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are pretty numerous; but, as
they lead a wandering life, and transport them∣selves
<PB N="379" REF="386"/>
from one island to another, it is not
possible to ascertain their number. It has been
remarked, in general, that the larger the islands
are, they are the nearer America, and the more
populous. It likewise appears, that all the in∣habitants
of the Islands of Foxes are of the same
nation, to which those of the Aleutes and the
islands of Andrien may also be referred, though
they differ in some customs. All these people,
in their manners, modes of living, and of feed∣ing,
have a great resemblance to the Esquimaux
and the Greenlanders. <HI>Kanaghist,</HI> the name of
these islanders in their own language, and per∣haps
corrupted by the mariners, has still a
great affinity to <HI>Karalit,</HI> the denomination of
the Esquimaux and their brethren the Green∣landers.
Among the inhabitants of all the islands
between Asia and America, no other utensils
were found but stone-hatchets, flint-knives, and
the shoulder bones of animals sharpened to cut
herbage. They have likewise darts armed
with sharp flints, and most artfully cut. They
have now a great many implements of iron,
which they have obtained from the Russians.
They make canoes like the Esquimaux; some
of them are so large that they contain twenty
persons. They are made of light wood, and are
entirely covered with the skins of seals and
other sea-animals.</P>
<P>From all these facts, it appears, that, from
<PB N="380" REF="387"/>
time immemorial, the Tschutschis, who inhabit
the eastern point of Asia between the 55th and
70th degree of latitude, have had commerce
with the Americans; that this intercourse was
the more easy to a people accustomed to all the
rigours of cold; and that the voyage, which
perhaps exceeds not a hundred leagues, might
be performed in simple canoes, conducted by
oars in summer, and probably on the ice in
winter, by landing daily upon a different island.
America, therefore, might be peopled by Asia
under this parallel; and every circumstance
seems to indicate, that, though there are now
intervals of sea between these islands, they for∣merly
constituted but one continent, by which
America was joined to Asia. It is likewise
probable, that, beyond the islands of Anadir or
Andrien, <HI>i. e.</HI> between the 70th and 75th de∣gree
of latitude, the two continents are absolute∣ly
united, though that track of land is perhaps
entirely covered with snow and ice. To ex∣plore
the regions beyond the 70th degree is an
enterprise worthy of the great Sovereign of the
Russias, and it ought to be entrusted to a navi∣gator
equally intrepid as Captain Phipps. I am
persuaded, that they would find the two conti∣nents
united; but, if otherwise, and if there
is an open sea beyond the islands of Andrien,
it appears to be certain, that they would find the
projections of the great Polar glacier at the 81st
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
or 8d degree, as Captain Phipps discovered them
at the same latitude between Spitzbergen and
Greenland.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Concerning that period when the powers of Man
aided those of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>The first men were witnesses of the convul∣sive
motions of the earth, which were then fre∣quent
and terrible. For a refuge against inun∣dations,
they had nothing but the mountains,
which they were often forced to abandon by the
fire of volcano's. They trembled on ground
which trembled under their feet. Naked in
mind as well as in body, exposed to the injuries
of every element, victims to the rapacity of fe∣rocious
animals, which they were unable to
combat, penetrated with the common sentiment
of terror, and pressed by necessity, they must
have quickly associated, at first to protect them∣selves
by their numbers, and then to afford mu∣tual
aid to each other in forming habitations
and weapons of defence. They began with sharp∣ening
into the figure of axes those hard flints,
those <HI>thunder-stones,</HI> which their descendants i∣magined
to have been produced by thunder, and
to have fallen from the clouds, but which, in
reality, are the first monuments of human art.
They would soon extract fire from these flints
by striking them against each other.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="389"/>
To destroy the brushwood and the forests,
they would employ the flames derived from vol∣cano's,
or from their burning lavas; for, with
the assistance of this powerful element, they
cleared and purified the grounds which they
chose to inhabit. With the axes of stone, they
cut trees, and fabricated those weapons and u∣tensils
of which necessity first suggested the use;
and, after being provided with clu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and other
heavy armour, would not these first men disco∣ver
the means of making lighter weapons to
annoy at a distance? The tendon of an ani∣mal,
the fibres of aloes, or the pliant bark
of some ligneous plant, would serve them for
a cord to unite the extremities of an elastic
branch; with which they made their bow:
To arm their arrows, they employed small
sharp flints. In a short time they would have
thread, rafts, and canoes; and in this state
they would remain till little nations were form∣ed.
These nations were composed of a few fa∣milies,
or rather of the descendants of the same
family, which is still the condition of those sava∣ges
who live independent in such open and spa∣cious
territories as afford them game, fishes,
and fruits. But, in territories which are nar∣rowed
by waters, or confined by high moun∣tains,
these small nations, after a great increase
of population, were obliged to divide the land
among themselves; and, from this moment,
the earth became the inheritance of man. He
<PB N="383" REF="390"/>
took possession of it by his labour and cultiva∣tion;
and the attachment to a native soil follow∣ed
rapidly the first acts of property. As indi∣vidual
interest constitutes a part of national or∣der,
government and laws must have succeed∣ed,
and society must have assumed strength and
consistence.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, these men, deeply affected with
the miseries of their original state, and having
still before their eyes the ravages of inundations,
the conflagrations of volcano's, and gulfs open∣ed
by the succussions of the earth, have pre∣served
a durable, and almost eternal, remem∣brance
of the calamities the world has suffered.
The idea, that it must perish by an universal de∣luge,
or by a general conflagration; the reve∣rence
for certain mountains upon which they
had been saved from inundations; their horror
at others which threw out fires more dreadful
than those of thunder; the view of those com∣bats
between the earth and heavens, which gave
rise to the fable of the Titans, and of their as∣saults
against the Gods; the notion of the real
existence of a malevolent being, with the terror
and superstition which it unavoidably produced;
all these sentiments, founded upon fear, took
an unconquerable possession of the human mind.
Even at present, men are not entirely emanci∣pated
from these superstitious terrors by the ex∣perience
of time, by the tranquillity which suc∣ceeded
<PB N="384" REF="391"/>
those ages of convulsions and storms,
nor by the knowledge of the effects and opera∣tions
of Nature, a knowledge which could not
be acquired till after the establishment of some
great society in a tranquil land.</P>
<P>It is neither in Africa, nor in the most south∣ern
regions of Asia, that great societies or nations
could be first formed. These countries were
still burning and desert. Neither could this e∣vent
happen in America, which, except its
chain of mountains, is evidently a new country;
nor even in Europe, which very lately derived
its learning from the East, where the first civi∣lized
men were established; for, before the
foundation of Rome, the happiest countries in this
part of the world, such as Italy, France, and Ger∣many,
were then peopled with men more than half
savage. Tacitus, in his Manners of the Ger∣mans,
exhibits a picture of those of the Hurons,
or rather of men just emerging from a state of
nature. Hence the source of human knowledge
must have arisen in the northern countries of
Asia; and power is a necessary result of know∣ledge.
The more man knows, the more he can
perform; and the less he has done, the less he
knows. All this implies an active people in a
happy climate, living under a pure sky and in
a fertile country, remote from inundations and
volcano's: It must also have been a high coun∣try,
and, of course, more anciently temperate
<PB N="385" REF="392"/>
than the more southern regions. Now, all these
conditions, all these circumstances, are united in
the centre of Asia, from the 40th to the 55th de∣gree
of latitude. The rivers which run into the
North Sea, into the Eastern Ocean, and into the
South and Caspian Seas, take their rise from
this elevated region, which at present composes
the southern part of Siberia and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artary. It
is, therefore, in this country, which is more e∣levated
than all the others, since it serves them
as a centre, and is near five hundred leagues
from any ocean; it is in this privileged country
that the first people worthy of notice were pro∣duced;
and they merit our esteem as the inven∣tors
of arts, sciences, and every useful institution.
This truth is equally evident from the monu∣ments
of natural history, and from the almost
inconceivable progress of astronomy. How
could men so new invent the lunisolar period of
six hundred years? I confine myself to this
single fact, though many others equally wonder∣ful
and permanent might be produced. These
people, therefore, knew as much of astronomy as
was known in the days of Cassini, who first de∣monstrated
the reality and exactness of this pe∣riod
of six hundered years; a knowledge of
which the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks,
were perfectly ignorant; a knowledge which
presupposes that of the exact movements of the
earth and moon, and requires great perfection in
<PB N="386" REF="393"/>
the instruments necessary to make observations;
a knowledge, which, as it implies the acquisition
of every thing derived from a long succession of
astronomical study and research, must have re∣quired
at least two or three thousand years exer∣tion
of the human mind.</P>
<P>These first people, because they had become
very learned, must have been proportionally hap∣py.
They must have enjoyed many ages of
peace and leisure, which are necessary for the
cultivation of science. Before they could enter∣tain
a suspicion concerning the period of six
hundred years, at least twelve hundred years of
astronomical observations were requisite; and,
to ascertain the fact, more than double that
number of years were necessary. Thus we
have already about three thousand years employ∣ed
in astronomical studies: Neither should this
circumstance surprise us; for, in reckoning from
the Chaldean astronomers to the present day, an
equal time has been employed in discovering
this period of six hundred years. Besides, these
three thousand years of astronomical observa∣tions
must necessarily have been preceded by
many ages in which science was unknown. Nay,
are six thousand years from the present time
sufficient to discover the most noble epoch in
the history of man, or even to trace his gradual
progress in the arts and sciences?</P>
<P>But, unhappily these sublime and beautiful
<PB N="387" REF="394"/>
sciences are lost: We can only recognise their
past existence by deformed and imperfect frag∣ments.
The invention of the <HI>formula</HI> by which
the Brahmins calculate eclipses, presupposes as
much science as the construction of our Epheme∣rides;
and yet these Brahmins have not the
smallest idea of the structure of the universe.
They possess only some false notions concerning
the motion, magnitude, and position of the pla∣nets.
They calculate eclipses without knowing
the theory of them. This operation they are
enabled to perform by machines or tables found∣ed
upon learned formulae, which they do not
comprehend, and which, probably, were not in∣vented
by their ancestors; because they have
never brought any thing to perfection, and
have not transmitted the smallest ray of science
to their descendants. In their hands, these for∣mulae
are only practical methods; but they im∣ply
profound knowledge, of which these people
have not preserved the slightest vestige, and
which, of course, they have never possessed.
Hence these methods could only proceed from
that ancient people, who had reduced into for∣mulae
the motion of the stars, and who, by a
long course of observations, could not only
predict eclipses, but, what is much more diffi∣cult,
they recognised the period of six hundred
years, and, of course, were acquainted with all
<PB N="388" REF="395"/>
those astronomical facts which this discovery ne∣cessarily
required.</P>
<P>I may affirm, that the Brahmins never in∣vented
these formulae; because all their phy∣sical
ideas are contrary to the theory on which
these formulae depend. If they had compre∣hended
this theory, even at the time they re∣ceived
its results, the science would have been
preserved, and they would not, as they do at
present, have entertained the most absurd and
ignorant notions concerning the system of the
universe; for they believe that the earth is im∣moveable,
and is supported by a mountain of
gold; that the moon is eclipsed by aerial dra∣gons;
that the planets are smaller than the
moon, &amp;c. It is therefore evident, that they
never had the first elements of astronomical the∣ory,
nor the smallest knowledge of the princi∣ples
upon which the methods they employ de∣pend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a more complete view of this subject, I refer the reader to an excellent account of ancient astronomy lately pub∣lished by Bailly, whose ideas perfectly coincide with mine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Chinese, who are a little more enlight∣ened
than the Brahmins, calculate eclipses in a
very rude manner, and they have continued to cal∣culate
them in the same manner for two or three
thousand years. As they bring nothing to perfec∣tion,
they can never invent. Hence science neither
originated in China nor in India. Though equal∣ly
near as the Indians to the first learned people,
<PB N="389" REF="396"/>
the Chinese appear not to have derived any ad∣vantage
from this favourable situation. They
are not even possessed of those astronomical for∣mulae
of which the Brahmins have preserved
the use, and which constitute the first great mo∣numents
of the knowledge and happiness of
man. Neither does it appear that the Chaldeans,
Persians, Egyptians, or Greeks, received any ad∣vantage
from this first enlightened race of
men; for, in these Levant countries, the new
astronomy must be ascribed to the indefatigable
assiduity of the Chaldean observers, and after∣wards
to the labour of the Greeks, which can
only be dated from the foundation of the Alex∣andrian
school. This science, however, after the
culture of two thousand years, and even till these
two or three last centuries, was very imper∣fect.
It seems, therefore, to be certain, that these
people, who first invented, and for a long suc∣cession
of ages so happily cultivated astronomy,
have left nothing but some fragments, some
results of the science, which might be retained
in the memory, such as that of the period of six
hundred years, which has been transmitted to us
by Josephus the Jewish historian, who did not
understand its value or import.</P>
<P>The loss of the sciences, that first wound to
humanity inflicted by the sword of barbarity,
must have been the effect of some direful revo∣lution,
which, in a few years perhaps, destroyed
<PB N="390" REF="397"/>
the labours and the ingenuity of many ages; for
those first powerful and learned people must
have continued long in a state of splendour and
prosperity, since they made so great progress in
the sciences, and, of course, in all the arts
which the study of them necessarily require.
But it is extremely probable, that, when the
regions to the north of this happy country, had
become too cold, their inhabitants, still igno∣rant,
ferocious, and barbarous, would pour in
upon this rich and cultivated country. It is e∣ven
astonishing, that these barbarians should have
been able to annihilate not only the principles,
but the remembrance of all science. Three
thousand years of ignorance, perhaps, followed
the three thousand years of light and knowledge
which had preceded them. Of all these first and
beautiful fruits of the human genius, there now
remains nothing but a meta physical religion,
which, being incomprehensible, required no
study, and could neither be altered nor lost but
by a defect of memory, which never fails when
it is struck with the marvellous. From this first
centre of the Sciences, the same metaphysical re∣ligion
diffused itself over every quarter of the
globe. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Calicut are the same with
those of Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>koi. Pilgrimages to the great
Lama are undertaken at the distance of more
that two thousand leagues. The idea of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or transmigration of souls, ex∣tends
<PB N="391" REF="398"/>
still farther, and is adopted as an article of
faith by the Indians, the Aethiopians, and the
Atlantes. The same notions, a little disguised,
were received by the Chinese, Persians, Greeks,
and Romans. Every circumstance concurs in
proving, that the first common stem of human
knowledge arose in this region of Asia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned M. Pallas remarks, that the cultivation, the arts, and the towns thinly scattered through this region, are living monuments of an empire or flourishing society, whose history is buried with its cities, temples, and arms, of which enormous ruins are daily dug out of the earth. These scatter∣ed people are the members of a great nation, which has no head. <HI>Voyage de Pallas en Siberi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>, and
that its barren or degenerated branches extended
into every part of the earth.</P>
<P>The past ages of barbarity are for ever buried
in profound darkness. Men were then so de∣formed
with ignorance, that human nature was
hardly recognisable: For rudeness, followed by
the neglect of duty, began to relax the bonds of
society, which were afterwards torn asunder by
barbarity; the laws were despised or proscribed;
manners degenerated into habits of ferocity;
the love of society, though engraven on the hu∣man
heart, was totally effaced; in a word, man,
without education, without morals, was redu∣ced
to lead a solitary and savage life, and, in∣stead
of the high dignity of his nature, presented
the picture of a being degraded below the brutes.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="399"/>
However, after the loss of the sciences, the
useful arts to which they had given birth were
preserved. The cultivation of the earth, which
became more necessary in proportion to the in∣crease
of population; all the arts and practices
which this culture requires, as well as all those
employed in the construction of buildings, in
the fabrication of idols and arms, in the weaving
of stuffs, &amp;c. survived the sciences. These arts
were gradually diffused and brought to perfec∣tion:
They followed the course of population.
The ancient empire of China first arose, and
nearly at the same time that of the Atlantes in
Africa. The empires on the continent of Asia,
those of Egypt and Aethiopia, were successively
established, and, lastly, that of Rome, to which
our Europe owes its civil existence. Hence, a∣bout
three thousand years only have elapsed
since the power of man united with that of Na∣ture,
and spread over the greatest part of the
earth. Before this period, the treasures of fer∣tility
were buried. The other resources of man,
still more profoundly interred, could not elude
his researches, but have become the reward of
his labours. When he conducted himself with
wisdom, he followed the lessons of Nature;
he derived advantage from her examples; he
employed her means, and, from the immensity
of her productions, selected all those objects from
which he could derive either utility or pleasure.
<PB N="393" REF="400"/>
By his intelligence the animals were subdued,
tamed, and reduced to perpetual slavery. By
his labours, the marshes were drained, the rivers
were restrained, and their cataracts effaced, the
forests were cleared, and the earth cultivated.
By his reflection, times were computed, spaces
were measured, the celestial motions were recog∣nised,
combined, and represented, the heavens
and the earth were compared, the universe was
augmented, and the Creator worthily adored.
By his art, which is an emanation of science,
the seas have been traversed, and the mountains
overcome; nations have been united; a new
world has been discovered; a thousand other
detached lands have been reduced under his do∣minion;
lastly, the whole face of the earth
at present exhibits the marks of his power,
which, though subordinate to that of Nature,
often exceeds, at least, so wonderfully seconds
her operations, that, by the aid of his hands, her
whole extent is unfolded, and she has gradually
arrived at that point of perfection and mag∣nificence
in which we now behold her.</P>
<P>Compare rude with cultivated Nature. Com∣pare
the small savage nations of America with
those of our civilised people, or even with those
of Africa, who are only half cultivated. Con∣template
the condition of the lands which
those nations inhabit, and you will easily per∣ceive
the insignificance of men who have made
<PB N="394" REF="401"/>
so little impression on their native soil. Whe∣ther
from stupidity or indolence, these brutish
men, these unpolished nations, great or small,
give no support to the Earth; they starve with∣out
fertilizing her; they devour every thing,
and propagate nothing. The savage state, how∣ever,
is not the most despicable condition of
mankind, but that of those nations who have
just begun to be polished, who have always been
the real scourges of human nature, and who,
even at present, can hardly be restrained by the
people who are completely civilised. They have,
as formerly remarked, ravaged the first happy
land. They have torn up the germs of happi∣ness,
and destroyed the fruits of science. How
many invasions have succeeded this first irruption
of barbarians? From these same northern re∣gions,
where every human virtue formerly ex∣isted,
all our evils afterwards proceeded. How
often have we seen these irruptions of animals
with human faces, who always come from the
north, ravage the countries of the south? Con∣sult
the annals of all nations, and you will find
twenty ages of desolation, for a few years of
ease and tranquillity.</P>
<P>Nature required six hundred ages to construct
her great works, to temper the earth, to fashion
its surface, and to arrive at repose: How many
ages would men require before they ceased to
disturb and destroy each other? When will they
<PB N="395" REF="402"/>
learn, that the peaceble possession of their own
country is sufficient for their happiness? When
will they be wise enough to give up their false
pretensions, to renounce imaginary dominions,
and distant possessions, which are often ruinous,
or at least cost more than their value? The Spa∣nish
empire in Europe is as extensive as that of
France, and ten times larger in America; Is it
ten times more powerful? Is it even as power∣ful
as if this bold and great nation were limited
to derive from its own happy country all the
benefits which it could furnish? Have not the
British, a people so sensible, and such profound
thinkers, committed a great error by extending
too far the limits of their colonies? The ancients
appear to have had more correct ideas with re∣gard
to these establishments. They never pro∣jected
emigrations till their population was too
great, and their territory and commerce were
not sufficient to supply their wants. Have not
the invasions of barbarians, which we look up∣on
with horror, had causes still more pressing,
when they found themselves too numerous in
ungrateful, cold, and naked countries, and at
the same time surrounded with fertile and culti∣vated
lands, which produced every article they
required? But, what quantities of blood, what
calamities, what losses, have accompanied and
followed these direful conquests?</P>
<P>We shall dwell no longer on the dismal spec∣tacle
of those revolutions of death and devasta∣tion,
<PB N="396" REF="403"/>
which are the genuine effects of ignorance.
Let us entertain the agreeable hopes, that the
balance, though imperfect, which subsists be∣tween
cultivated nations, will continue, and be∣come
even more stable in proportion as men
shall have better notions of their real interest;
that they will learn the value of peace and tran∣quil
happiness; that the acquisition of this object
will be the chief aim of their ambition; and
that Princes will disdain the false glory of con∣querors,
and despise the little restless vanity of
those who excite them to such dreadful com∣motions.</P>
<P>Let us suppose the world in peace, and take
a nearer prospect of the influence of man's pow∣er
over that of Nature. Nothing appears to be
more difficult, not to say impossible, than to op∣pose
the successive cooling of the earth, and to
warm the temperature of a climate; yet this
feat man can and has performed. Paris and
Quebeck are nearly under the same degeee of la∣titude;
Paris, therefore, would be as cold as
Quebeck, if France and the adjacent countries
were as thinly inhabited, and as much covered
with wood and water as the territories in the
neighbourhood of Canada. The draining, clear∣ing,
and peopling a country, will give it a
warmth which will continue for some thousand
years; and this fact will prevent the only rea∣sonable
<PB N="397" REF="404"/>
objection which can be made against my
opinion, that the earth is gradually cooling.</P>
<P>According to your system, it may be said, the
whole earth must be cooler now than it was two
thousand year ago: But tradition proves the
contrary. France and Germany formerly pro∣duced
rain-deer, lynxes, bears, and other ani∣mals
which have since retired to more northerly
regions. This progress is very different from
what you maintain, namely, from north to
south. Besides, history informs us, that the
river Seine was annually frozen during a part
of the winter. Are not these facts a direct con∣tradiction
to the gradual cooling of the earth?
They would, I acknowledge, if France and Ger∣many
were now in the same state; if we had
not cut down the forests, drained the marshes,
confined the torrents, directed the rivers, and
cleared all the lands which were overgrown
with unprofitable plants. But we ought to con∣sider,
that the heat of the globe diminishes in
an imperceptible manner; that seventy-two
thousand years were necessary to cool it to a
proper temperature, and that an equal portion
of time must elapse before it is so cold as to be
un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for the nourishment of animals and vege∣tables.
We must consider the difference be∣tween
this slow cooling of the earth and the
sudden colds produced in the atmosphere; and
we must nevertheless recollect, that the differ∣ence
<PB N="398" REF="405"/>
between the greatest heat of our summers,
and the greatest cold of our winters, exceeds not
a thirty-second part. From these considerations
it is apparent, that external causes have a much
greater influence upon the temperature of every
climate than the internal cause, and that, in all
those climates where the cold of the superior re∣gions
of the air is attracted by moisture, or push∣ed
by the winds towards the surface, the effects
of these particular causes are much more power∣ful
than that produced by the general cause.
Of this we shall give an example, which will
remove every doubt, and at the same time ob∣viate
every similar objection.</P>
<P>In the immense territories of Guiana, which
are covered with thick forests, where the sun
can hardly penetrate, where great tracts of
country are overflowed with water, where the
rivers are very near each other, and are neither
restrained nor directed, where it rains continual∣ly
during eight months of the year, the inhabi∣tants,
about a century ago, began to clear the
country arround Cayenne, which is a very small
canton of these vast forests. The difference of
temperature in this little district is already so
perceptible, that the people are too warm during
the night; but, in all the lands which are cover∣ed
with wood, the nights are so cold that sires
are necessary in the houses. The same effect is
produced with regard to the quantity and dura∣tion
<PB N="399" REF="406"/>
of the rains: They cease sooner and com∣mence
later at Cayenne than in the interior parts
of the country; neither are they so heavy, nor
so frequent. At Cayenne, there are four months
of absolute driness: But, in the interior parts of
the country, the dry season lasts only three
months; besides, a daily rain is brought down
by the south winds, which is pretty violent. An∣other
circumstance merits attention: It seldom
thunders at Cayenne; but, in the interior parts,
where the clouds are black, thick, and very low,
the thunder is violent and very frequent. These
facts show, in the clearest manner, that, in this
country, the eight months of perpetual rain
might be diminished, and the heat greatly aug∣mented,
if the forests were cut down, if the wa∣ters
were restrained, and the rivers properly di∣rected,
and if the cultivation of the earth,
which supposes the movements of a great num∣ber
of men and animals, banished that cold and
superfluous moisture which is attracted and dif∣fused
by the immense quantity of vegetables.</P>
<P>As every action, every movement, produces
heat, and as all beings endowed with the faculty
of progressive motion, may be considered as so
many little fires, it is in proportion to the num∣ber
of men and animals, that (every thing else
being equal) the local temperature of each par∣ticular
country depends. The former diffuse heat,
the latter nothing but cold and moisture. The
perpetual use men make of fire adds greatly to
<PB N="400" REF="407"/>
the artificial temperature of all populous terri∣tories.
In Paris, during great colds, the ther∣mometers
at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré stand
two or three degrees lower than those at the Fau∣bourg
Saint-Merceau; because the north wind is
heated in passing over the numerous chimneys
of that great city. A single forest in any country
is sufficient to produce some change in its tem∣perature.
Trees attract the cold; by their shade
they diminish the heat of the sun; they produce
moist vapours that form clouds and fall down in
rain, which is always colder from the greater
height it descends. When these forests are a∣bandoned
to Nature alone, the old trees fall and
coldly corrupt; but, when under the dominion
of man, they are used as fewel to the element
of fire, and become the secondary causes of e∣very
particular heat. In meadows, before the
herbage is cut down, there are always copious
dews, and often small showers of rain, which
cease as soon as the grass is carried off. These
small rains would become more abundant and
more durable, if our meadows, like the savan∣nahs
of America, were always covered with the
same quantity of herbs, which, instead of dimi∣nishing,
must increase by the accumulating ma∣nure
of all those that die and corrupt on the
surface.</P>
<P>Many other examples might be given, all
concurring to show that man can have an in∣fluence
<PB N="401" REF="408"/>
on the climate he inhabits; and; in a
manner, fix its temperature at any point that
may be agreeable to him; and; what is singular,
it is more difficult for him to cool than to heat
the earth. He is master of the element of fire;
which he can augment and propagate at plea∣sure,
but not of the element of cold, which he
can neither lay hold of nor communicate. The
principle of cold is not a real substance, but a
simple privation, or rather diminution of heat;
a diminution which ought to be very great in
the high regions of the air, and which, at the
distance of a league from the earth, converts the
aqueous vapours into hail and snow. For the
emanations of the heat proper to the globe ob∣serve
the same law as all other physical quanti∣ties
or qualities which proceed from a common
centre; and, as their intensity decreases in the
inverse ratio of the square of the distance, it ap∣pears
to be certain, that the atmosphere is four
times colder at the height of two leagues than
at that of one; each point of the earth's surface
being considered as a centre. On the other
hand, the interior heat of the globe, in every
season, is constantly ten degrees above the free∣zing
point. Hence the earth can never be cold∣er
than ten degrees above this point, except by
the fall of cold matters upon its surface from the
superior regions of the air, where the effects of
the internal heat of the globe diminish in pro∣portion
<PB N="402" REF="409"/>
to the height. Now, the power of man
extends not so far. He cannot make cold de∣scend,
as he makes heat ascend. He has no o∣ther
mode of defending himself from the ar∣dour
of the sun's rays, but by forming a shade.
But it is more easy to cut down the forests of
Guiana, in order to heat the humid earth, than
to plant trees in Arabia to refresh the burning
sands. A single forest, however, in the midst
of these parched deserts, would be sufficient
to render them more temperate, to attract
the waters from the atmosphere, to restore all
the principles of fertility to the earth, and, of
course, to make man, in these barren regions,
enjoy all the sweets of a temperate climate.</P>
<P>It is upon the difference of temperature that
the stronger or weaker energies of Nature de∣pend.
The growth, and even the production,
of all organized beings, are only particular effects
of this general cause: Hence man, by modi∣fying
this cause, may in time destroy what in∣jures
him, and give birth to every thing that is
agreeable to his feelings. Happy are those
countries where all the elements of temperature
are balanced, and so fortunately combined as to
produce only good effects! But, has any
country, from its origin, ever enjoyed this pri∣vilege?
Is there any country where the power
of man has not aided that of Nature, either by
attracting or dissipating the waters, by destroy∣ing
<PB N="403" REF="410"/>
noxious or superfluous vegetables, and by
taming and multiplying useful animals? Of
three hundred species of quadrupeds, and fifteen
hundred species of birds, man has selected nine∣teen
or twenty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The elephant, the camel, the horse, the ass, the ox, the sheep, the goat, the hog, the dog, the cat, the lama, the vigogne, the buffalo; the hen, the swan, the guiney hen, the duck, the peacock, the pheasant, and pigeon.</NOTE>; and these twenty species
make a greater figure in Nature, and are more
useful to the earth than all the others: They
make a greater figure, because they are directed
and prodigiously multiplied by man. By co-o∣perating
with him, they produce all the benefits
which could be expected from a wise distribu∣tion
of powers in cultivating the earth, in trans∣porting
the articles of commerce, in augmenting
provisions, in supplying all the wants, and in
ministering to the pleasures of their only master
who can reward their services by his industry
and attention.</P>
<P>Of the small number of animals selected by
man, the hen and the hog species, which are the
most prolific, are likewise the most generally
diffused, as if the aptitude for great multiplica∣tion
were accompanied with that vigour of con∣stitution
which braves every danger or inconve∣niency
arising from difference of climate. The
hen and the hog have been found in the most
unfrequented regions of the earth, in Otaheite
and other southern islands, which are the most
<PB N="404" REF="411"/>
remote from any continent, and have, till very
lately, remained for ever unknown. It appears
that these species have followed man in all his
emigrations. In south America, where none of
our animals could possibly arrive, we find the
pecari and wild hen, which, though smaller and
a little different from the hog and hen of our
continent, must be regarded as a species so much
allied that they might easily be reduced to a do∣mestic
state. But savage man, having no idea
of society, is not sollicitous about that of ani∣mals.
In the regions of south America, the
savages have no domestic animals. They de∣stroy
indifferently the good with the bad species.
They select none for the purposes of rearing and
multiplying them; while a single fertile species,
like that of the <HI>hocco</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A large and very prolific bird, whose flesh is as good as that of the pheasant.</NOTE>, which is at their com∣mand,
would furnish them, with very little at∣tention,
more subsistance than they can procure
by their laborious and painful huntings.</P>
<P>Thus the first mark of man's civilization is
the empire he assumes over the animals; and
this first mark of his intelligence becomes after∣wards
the greatest evidence of his power over
Nature: For it is only after he subjugates and
tames animals, that he is enabled, by their assist∣ance,
to change the face of the earth, to convert
deserts into fertile ground, and heath into corn.
By multiplying useful animals, he augments
<PB N="405" REF="412"/>
the quantity of life and motion on the surface
of the earth; he, at the same time, improves
the whole race of beings, and ennobles himself,
by transforming the vegetable into the animal,
and both into his own substance, which after∣wards
diffuses itself by a numerous multiplica∣tion.
He every where produces plenty of pro∣visions,
which is always succeeded by great po∣pulation.
Millions of men exist in the same
space which was formerly occupied by two or
three hundred savages, and millions of animals
where only a few individuals existed. By him,
and for his use, all the precious germs are un∣folded;
the productions of the noblest kinds
are alone cultivated; upon the immense tree of
fecundity the fruitful branches are alone brought
to perfection.</P>
<P>Grain, of which man makes bread, is not the
gift of Nature, but the fruit of his researches
and of his knowledge in the first of all arts. In
no quarter of the earth has wild corn been ever
found: It is evidently an herb brought to per∣fection
by his care and industry. This precious
plant he must have selected out of many thou∣sands.
He must have sown and reaped a num∣ber
of times, in order to discover its fertility,
which is always proportioned to the manure
and culture bestowed upon the soil: And the
singular quality possessed by wheat of resisting,
in its early state, the cold of our winters,
though, like all other annual plants, it perishes
<PB N="406" REF="413"/>
after yielding its seed, and its no less wonderful
qualities of being nutritious and agreeable to all
men, to many animals, accommodated to almost
every climate, and can be long preserved without
corruption, and without losing its power of re∣production;
all these circumstances concur in
proving that it is the most happy invention ever
discovered by man; and, however ancient it may
be supposed, it must have been preceded by the
art of agriculture founded upon science, and
brought to perfection by experience and obser∣vation.</P>
<P>If more modern and even recent examples of
man's power over the nature of vegetables are
required, we have only to compare our pot∣herbs,
our flowers, and our fruits with those of
the same species as they existed fifty years a∣go.
This comparison may be instantly made,
by inspecting the great collection of flowers,
which was begun in the time of Gaston d'Or∣leans,
and continued to this day, in the Royal
Garden. We shall then perceive, perhaps with
surprise, that the most beautiful flowers of that
period, as the ranunculi, pinks, tulips, auricula,
&amp;c. would now be rejected, not by florists alone,
but by the most vulgar gardeners. These flow∣ers,
though then cultivated, were not far remo∣ved
from their natural state. A single row of
petals or flower leaves, long stamina, and hard
or disagreeable colours, without variety, and
without delicate shades, are the rustic charac∣ters
<PB N="407" REF="414"/>
of savage nature. Our pot-herbs consisted
of a single species of succory, and two of lattuce,
both very bad; but we have now more than
fifty kinds of lattuce and succory, all of which
are good. Our best fruits and nuts, which are
so different from those formerly cultivated, that
they have no resemblance but in the name,
must likewise be referred to a very modern
date. In general, substances remain, and names
change with times. But, in this case, names
remain, and substances are changed. Our peach∣es,
our apricots, our pears, are new productions
with ancient names. To remove every doubt
upon this subject, we have only to compare our
flowers and fruits with the descriptions, or ra∣ther
notices of them, transmitted to us by the
Greeks and Romans. All their flowers were
single, and all their fruit trees were wild stocks,
and their species very ill chosen: Their fruits, of
course, were small, dry, sour, and had neither
the flavour nor the beauty of ours.</P>
<P>These new and good species originally sprung
from the wild kinds; but, how many thousand
times have their seeds been sown before this
happy effect was produced? It was only by sow∣ing
and rearing infinite number of vegetables
of the same species, that some individuals were
recognised to bear better and more succulent
fruit than others; and this first discovery, which
supposes much care and observation, would have
<PB N="408" REF="415"/>
remained for ever useless, if a second had not
been made, which implies an equal degree of
genius as the first required of patience; I mean the
mode of multiplying by engrafting those preci∣ous
inviduals, which unfortunately cannot propa∣gate,
or transmit their excellent qualities to their
posterity. This fact alone shows that these quali∣ties
are purely individual, and not specific; for
the seeds of these excellent fruits, like the infe∣rior
kinds, produce nothing but wild stocks,
which are essentially different.</P>
<P>By means of engrafting, however, man has
in a manner created secondary species, which
he can multiply at pleasure. The bud or small
branch, when united to the wild stock, retains
that individual quality which it could not trans∣mit
by its seed; and, in order to produce the
same fruit as its original parent, it requires only
to be developed. The fruits receive none of
the bad qualities of the wild stock; because it
has not contributed to their formation: It is not
their mother, but their nurse, which only as∣sists
their growth by conveying nourishment to
them.</P>
<P>In the animal kingdom, most of those quali∣ties
which appear to be individual, are propaga∣ted
and transmitted in the same manner as their
specific qualities. It was, therefore, more easy
for man to have influence upon the nature of a∣nimals
than upon that of vegetables. Particular
<PB N="409" REF="416"/>
races in any species of animals are only constant
varieties which are perpetuated by generation.
But, in the vegetable kingdom, there are no ra∣ces,
no varieties so constant, as to be perpetuated
by reproduction. In the species of the hen and
pigeon, a great number of races have been very
lately produced, all of which propagate their
kinds. In other species, we daily rear and improve
races by crossing the breeds. From time to time,
we naturalize and tame foreign or wild species.
All these recent examples show, that it was long
before man knew the greatness of his power,
and that he is not yet fully acquainted with its
extent: It depends entirely on the exercise of
his intellect. Thus the more he shall observe
and cultivate nature, the more expedients he will
discover for making her submit, and for draw∣ing
from her bosom fresh sources of riches,
without diminishing the inexhaustible treasures
of her fertility.</P>
<P>What influence might not man acquire over
his own species, if his inclinations were always
directed by his intelligence? Who knows to what
degree he might improve his moral as well as
his physical nature? Is there a single nation who
can boast of having arrived at the best of possi∣ble
governments, a government which would
render all men not equally happy, but less une∣qually
miserable, by attending to their preser∣vation,
by softening their labours, and sparing
<PB N="410" REF="417"/>
their blood by cultivating peace and procuring
abundance of provisions: This is the moral end
of every society of men who are anxious to im∣prove
their condition: And, with regard to the
physical part of our nature, have the medical
and other arts, whose objects are health and
preservation, made an equal progress as the arts
of destruction invented for the purposes of war
and carnage? In all ages, it appears that man
has reflected deeper and made more researches
concerning evil than good. In every society
there is a mixture of both; and as, of all senti∣ments
which affect the multitude, fear is the
most powerful, great talents in the art of doing
mischief were the first which struck the mind of
man; he was afterwards occupied with the arts
of amusement; and it was not till after long
experience in these two means of false honour
and unprofitable pleasure, that he at last recog∣nise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his true glory to be science, and his true
happiness peace.</P>
