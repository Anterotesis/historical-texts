<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters and other Artists in the Reign of JAMES I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was well for the arts that King James had no disposition to them:
He let them take their own course. Had he felt any inclination
for them, he would probably have introduced as bad a taste as he
did into litterature. A Prince who thought puns and quibbles the per∣fection
of eloquence, would have been charmed with the monkies of
Hemskirk and the drunken boors of Ostade. James loved his ease
and his pleasures and hated novelties. He gave himself up to hunting
and hunted in the most cumbrous and inconvenient of all dresses, a
ruff and trowser breeches. The nobility kept up the magnificence
they found established by Queen Elizabeth, in which predominated a
want of taste, rather than a bad one. In more ancient times the man∣sions
of the great lords, were, as I have mentioned before, built for de∣fence
and strength rather than convenience. The walls thick, the win∣dows
pierced wherever it was most necessary for them to look abroad,
instead of being contrived for symmetry or to illuminate the chambers.
To that style succeeded the richness and delicacy of the Gothic. As
this declined, before the Grecian taste was established, space and vast∣ness
seem to have made their whole ideas of grandeur. The palaces
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
erected in the reign of Elizabeth by the memorable Countess of Shrews∣bury,
Elizabeth of Hardwicke, are exactly in this style. The apart∣ments
are lofty and enormous, and they knew not how to furnish them.
Pictures, had they had good ones, would be lost in chambers of such
height: Tapestry, their chief moveable, was not commonly perfect
enough to be real magnificence. Fretted cielings, gracefull mouldings
of windows, and painted glass, the ornaments of the preceding age,
were fallen into disuse. Immense lights composed of bad glass in dia∣mond
panes, cast an air of poverty on their most costly apartments.
That at Hardwicke, still preserved as it was furnished for the reception
and emprisonment of the Queen of Scots, is a curious picture of that
age and style. Nothing can exceed the expence in the bed of state, in
the hangings of the same chamber, and of the coverings for the tables.
The first is cloth of gold, cloth of silver, velvets of different colours,
lace, fringes and embroidery. The hangings consist of figures, large
as life, representing the virtues and vices, embroidered on grounds of
white and black velvet. The cloths to cast over the tables are embroi∣dered
and embossed with gold, on velvets and damasks, The only
moveables of any taste are the cabinets and tables themselves, carved
in oak. The chimnies are wide enough for a hall or kitchen, and over
the arras are freezes of many feet deep with miserable relievos in stucco
representing huntings. There and in all the great mansions of that age
is a gallery, remarkable only for its extent. That at Hardwicke is of
sixty yards.</P>
<P>James built no palace himself. Those erected by the Nobles in
his reign are much like what I have been describing. Audley-inn, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, writing after the days of Inigo Jones, says, that this house was not to be equalled by any fabric in this realm, excepting Hampton-court. There are prints of Audley-inn in it's grandeur by Winstanley, who lived at Littlebury near it, where, within my memory, was his house, remarkable for several mecha∣nic tricks, known by the name of WINSTANLEY's WONDERS. His plates of Audley-inn are extant, but the prints are very scarce. Part of the edifice was taken down about forty years ago, and a greater part, with the magnificent gal∣lery, was demolished after the decease of the last Earl of Suffolk of that line.</NOTE>

one of the wonders of that age, deserved little notice but for the pro∣digious
space it covered. Towards the end of that monarch's reign
genius was called out and appeared. The magnificent temper or taste
of the Duke of Buckingham led him to collect pictures, and pointed
out the study of them to Prince Charles. Rubens came over, Inigo
Jones arose, and architecture broke forth in all the lustre and purity of
Rome and Athens—But before I come to that period, I must clear
my way by some account of the preceding artists. The first painter
who seems to have arrived after the accession of James was</P>
<P>PAUL VANSOMER,</P>
<P>a native of Antwerp. The accounts of him are extremely deficient,
no author of the lives of painters mentioning him but Carl Vermander,
who only says that Vansomer was living when he wrote, and then re∣sided
with his brother Bernard at Amsterdam. Yet Vansomer as a
painter of portraits was a very able master. The picture of the Lord
Chamberlain William Earl of Pembroke, half length at St. James's,
is an admirable portrait, and a whole length at Chatsworth of the first
Earl of Devonshire in his robes, though ascribed to Mytens, I should
think was painted by the same hand. Mytens was much colder in his
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
colouring and stiff in his drawing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mytens improved so much in his later portraits, that this character must be read with allowances; and on studying more of his works, I cannot determine whether the portrait at Chatsworth is not painted by him, as constant tradition says it was. In general, the portraits by Vansomer and Mytens, when at whole length, may be thus distinguished; Vansomer commonly placed his on a mat, Mytens, on a carpet.</NOTE>. Both these portraits are bold and
round, and the chiaro scuro good. The Earl of Devonshire is equal
to the pencil of Vandyck, and one of the finest single figures I have
seen. In what year Vansomer came to England we do not know; cer∣tainly
as early as 1606, between which and 1620 he did several pic∣tures.
I shall mention but a few, that are indubitably his, from
whence by comparison his manner may be known.</P>
<P>James I. at Windsor, behind him a view of Whitehall.</P>
<P>Anne of Denmark, with a prospect of the west end of St. Paul's.</P>
<P>The same King at Hampton-court, armour lying by him on the
ground; better than the former. Dated 1615.</P>
<P>His Queen in blue, with a horse and dogs; also at Hampton-court.
This picture is imitated in the tapestry at Houghton.</P>
<P>Three ladies, 1615, at Ditchley; Lady Morton in purple; another,
with yellow lace about her neck and a gauze scarf: the third in black
with a crape over her forehead.</P>
<P>Lord Chancellor Bacon and his brother Nicholas at Gorhambury.</P>
<P>Sir Simon Weston, brother of Lord Treasurer Portland, whole
length with a pike in his hand, 1608, aet. 43. This piece was in the
possession of the Lord Chief Justice Raymond.</P>

generally, but inaccurately, called Johnson, was, according to Sandrart,
born in London of Flemish parents; but Vertue, and the author of an
Essay towards an English school, say it was at Amsterdam, where the
latter asserts that he resided long, the former that he came over young,
which, considering how late he lived, I should be inclined to believe,
if Vertue did not at the same time pronounce that his earliest perfor∣mances
are his best: So good a style of colouring was hardly formed
here. His pictures are easily <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He sometimes put this mark on his pictures <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> fecit.</NOTE> distinguished by their clearness,
neatness and smoothness. They are generally painted on board, and
except being a little stiff, are often stronglly marked with a fair charac∣ter
of nature, and remarkable for a lively tranquillity in the counte∣nances.
His draperies are seldom but black. I have two portraits by
him of singular merit; one of Mr. Leneve, master of the company of
merchant-taylors; the other of Sir George Villiers, father of the great
Duke of Buckingham, less handsome, but extremely like his son. One
of his hands rests on the head of a greyhound, as fine as the animals of
Snyder.</P>
<P>Jansen's first works in England are dated about 1618. He dwelt
in the Black-friars, and had much business. His price for a head was
five broad pieces. He painted too in small in oil, and often copied his
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
own works in that manner. In the family of Verney were the por∣traits
of Sir Robert Heath and his lady in both sizes. At Cashiobury
is a large piece, curious, but so inferior to Jansen's general manner,
that if his name were not to it, I shou'd doubt it's being of his hand.
It represents Arthur Lord Capel, who was beheaded, his Lady and
Children. Behind them is a view of the Garden at Hadham, at that
time the chief seat of the family. Between the years 1630 and 1640
Jansen lived much in Kent at a small village called Bridge near Bar∣hamdown,
and drew many portraits for gentlemen in the neighbour∣hood,
particularly of the families of Auger, Palmer, Hammond and
Bowyer. One of his best works was the picture of a Lady Bowyer,
of the family of Auger, called for her exquisite beauty <HI>The Star in the
East.</HI> At Sherburn Castle in Dorsetshire is a head of Elizabeth Wri∣othesley
eldest daughter of Henry Earl of Southampton, and wife of
William Lord Spenser, her head richly dressed, and a picture in a blue
enamelled case at her breast. This picture is well coloured, tho' not
equal to another at the same seat, a half length of her mother, Eliza∣beth,
daughter of John Vernon, wife of Earl Henry. Her cloaths
are magnificent, and the attire of her head, singular, a veil turned
quite back. The face and hands are coloured with incomparable
lustre, and equal to any thing this master executed. There is also a
half length in black satten of John Digby, first Earl of Bristol, young
and remarkably handsome. It is ascribed to Jansen, but is faintly
coloured, and evidently in the manner of Vandyck, whom perhaps he
imitated as well as rivalled.</P>
<P>Jansen's fame declined <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Lord Pomfret's at Easton was a portrait of Charles I. by Jansen.</NOTE> on the arrival of Vandyck, and the civil war
<PB N="7" REF="10" MS="y"/>
breaking out, Cornelius, at the importunity of his wife, quitted Eng∣land.
His pass is recorded in the Journals of the Commons:</P>
<P>October 10, 1648. Ordered, that Cornelius Johnson, picture-drawer,
shall have Mr. Speaker's warrant to pass beyond seas with Emanuel
Passe, George Hawkins; and to carry with him such pictures and co∣lours,
bedding, houshold stuff, pewter, and brass, as belongs unto him∣self.</P>
<P>He retired first to Midelburg and then to Amsterdam, where he
continued to paint and died in 1665. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandrart, p. 314.</NOTE> His wife's name was Eliza∣beth
Beck, to whom he was married in 1622. They had a son Cor∣nelius,
bred to his father's profession, which he followed in Holland,
where he died poor, being ruined by the extravagance of a second wife.
The son drew the Duke of Monmouth's picture, as he was on the
point of sailing for his unfortunate expedition to England.</P>
<P>A sister of Cornelius Jansen the elder was second wife of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the catalogue of King Charles's pictures is mentioned a portrait drawn by George Spence of Nuremberg, and bought of Nicasius Russel, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>35.</NOTE> Nicasius
Russel or Roussel of Bruges, jeweller to the Kings James and Charles
the first. They had many children. To one of the sons born in
1619 Cornelius Jansen was godfather, and the widow of Isaac Oliver,
godmother. Theodore Russel, an elder son was born in 1614, and
lived nine years with his uncle Cornelius Jansen, and afterwards with
Vandyck, whose pictures he copied very tolerably on small pannels;
many of them are in a private apartment at Windsor, at Warwick∣castle,
and in the collection of the Duchess Dowager of Argyle.
Russel chiefly was employed in the country in the families of the Earls
of Essex and Holland, and was a lover of his ease and his bottle.
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
He was father of Antony Russel, a painter, from whom Vertue recei∣ved
these particulars, and at whose house he saw a picture of Cornelius
Jansen, his wife and son, drawn by Adrian Hanneman, who courted
Jansen's neice, but was disappointed.</P>
<P>DANIEL MYTENS</P>
<P>of the Hague, was an admired painter in the reigns of King James
and King Charles. He had certainly studied the works of Rubens
before his coming over; his landscape in the back grounds of his por∣traits
is evidently in the style of that school; and some of his works
have been taken for Vandyck's. The date of his arrival is not certain;
probably it was in hopes of succeeding Van Somer; but though he
drew several of the court, he was not formally employed as the King's
painter 'till the reign of Charles. His patent is preserved in Rymer's
Foedera, vol. xviii, p. 3.</P>

At Hampton-court are several whole lengths of Princes and Prin∣cesses
of the house of Brunswick-Lunenburgh, and the portrait of
Charles Howard Earl of Nottingham; at Kensington is Mytens's own
head. At Knowle, Lionel Cranfield Earl of Middlesex, Lord Trea∣surer,
with his white staff, whole length. A small bell on the table has
these letters D. M. F. 1623. It was more common for him to paint a
slip of paper on his pictures, inscribed only with the names or titles of
the persons represented. At Lady Elizabeth Germain's at Drayton,
is a very fine whole length of Henry Rich Earl of Holland, in a stri∣ped
habit with a walking stick. At St. James's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The picture of the Queen of Scots at St. James's is a copy by Mytens.</NOTE> is Jeffery Hudson
the dwarf, holding a dog by a string, in a landscape, coloured warmly
and freely like Snyder or Rubens. Mytens drew the same figure in a
very large picture of Charles I. and his Queen, which was in the pos∣session
of the late Earl of Dunmore, but the single figure is much bet∣ter
painted. The history of this diminutive personage was so remark∣able,
that the reader will perhaps not dislike the digression.</P>
<P> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Fuller and Wright's Rutlandshire.</NOTE> He was born at Oakham in Rutlandshire in 1619, and about the
age of seven or eight, being then but eighteen inches high, was re∣tained
in the service of the Duke of Buckingham, who resided at Bur∣leigh
on the Hill. Soon after the marriage of Charles I, the King and
Queen being entertained at Burleigh, little Jeffery was served up to
table in a cold pye, and presented by the Duchess to the Queen, who
kept him as her dwarf. From seven years of age 'till thirty he never
grew taller; but after thirty he shot up to three feet nine inches, and
there fixed. Jeffery became a considerable part of the entertainment
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
of the court. Sir William Davenant wrote a poem called Jeffreidos,
on a battel between him and a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The scene is laid at Dunkirk, and the midwise rescues him from the fury of his antagonist.</NOTE> turkey-cock, and in 1638 was publish∣ed
a very small book called The New-year's Gift, presented at court
from the Lady Parvula to the Lord Minimus (commonly called little
Jeffery) her majesty's servant, &amp;c. written by Microphilus, with a little
print of Jeffery prefixed. Before this period Jeffery was employed on
a negotiation of great importance: He was sent to France to fetch a
midwife for the Queen, and on his return with this gentlewoman, and
her majesty's dancing-master, and many rich presents to the Queen
from her mother Mary de Medici, he was taken by the Dunkirkers. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was in 1630. Besides the present he was bringing for the Queen, he lost to the value of 2500<HI>l.</HI> that he had received in France on his own account from the Queen-mother and ladies of that court.</NOTE>
Jeffery, thus made of consequence, grew to think himself really so.
He had born with little temper the teazing of the courtiers and dome∣stics,
and had many squabbles with the King's gigantic porter; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A basrelief of this dwarfand giant is to be seen fixed in the front of a house near the end of Bagnio-court on the east side of Newgate-street. Probably it was a sign. Oliver Cromwell too had a porter of an enormous height, whose standard is recorded by a large O on the back of the terrace at Windsor, almost under the window of the gallery. This man went mad and prophecied. In Whitechapel was a sign of him taken from a print of St. Peter.</NOTE> at last
being provoked by Mr. Crofts, a young gentleman of family, a chal∣lenge
ensued, and Mr. Crofts coming to the rendezvous armed only
with a squirt, the little creature was so enraged that a real duel ensued,
and the appointment being on horseback with pistols, to put them more
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
on a level, Jeffery with the first fire shot his antagonist dead. This
happened in France whither he had attended his mistress in the trou∣bles.
He was again taken prisoner by a Turkish rover, and sold into
Barbary. He probably did not long remain in slavery; for at the be∣ginning
of the civil war he was made a captain in the royal army, and
in 1644 attended the Queen to France where he remained 'till the re∣storation.
At last upon suspicion of his being privy to the Popish plot,
he was taken up in 1682, and confined in the gate-house Westminster,
where he ended his life in the sixty-third year of his age.</P>
<P>Mytens remained in great reputation 'till the arrival of Vandyck,
who being appointed the King's principal painter, the former in dis∣gust
asked his majesty's leave to retire to his own country; but the
King learning the cause of his dissatisfaction, treated him with much
kindness, and told him that he could find sufficient employment both
for him and Vandyck; Mytens consented to stay, and even grew inti∣mate,
it is probable, with his rival, for the head of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some of the first impressions the name of Isaac appears in this plate, instead of Daniel. It was corrected afterwards.</NOTE> Mytens is one
of those painted among the professors by that great master.</P>
<P>Whether the same jealousy operated again, or real decline of business
influenced him, or any other cause, Mytens did not stay much longer in
England. We find none of his works here after the year 1630. Yet
he lived many years afterwards. Houbraken quotes a register at the
Hague dated in 1656, at which time it says Mytens painted part of
the cieling of the town-hall there; the subject is, Truth writing history
on the back of Fame.</P>

These were the most considerable painters in oil in the reign of
James: There were undoubtedly several others of inferior rank, whose
names are not come down to us, except two or three; and of one of
those I find nothing but this short note from Baglione. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 186.</NOTE></P>
<P>Christophano Roncalli, pittore, andò per la Germania, per la Fian∣dra,
per l' Olanda, per l' <HI>Inghilterra,</HI> per la Francia; e finalmente ca∣rico
d' honori e di 74 anni finì il corso 1626. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He died at Rome.</NOTE> I should not mention
such slight notices, but that they may lead to farther discoveries. An
other was a more remarkable person, especially in the subsequent reign;
but in a work of this nature it is impossible not to run the subjects of
one chapter into those of another, taking care however to distribute
them, as they serve best to carry on the chronologic series. His name
was

</P>
<P>ROBERT PEAKE.</P>
<P>The earliest mention of him that appears is in the <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">They were in the collection of the late Dr. Rawlinson.</NOTE> books of the Lord

council October 4, 1612, for three several pictures made by him at the
commandment of the Duke of York his officers, and given away and
disposed of by the Duke's Grace, twenty pounds.</P>
<P>It does not appear whether these pictures were in oil or water-co∣lours;
I should rather suppose portraits in miniature of (King Charles
the First then) Duke of York; but that Peake painted in oil is ascer∣tained

Peacham himself was a limner, as he tells us in the same book, having
presented a copy of his majesty's Basilicon Doron illuminated to
Prince Henry.</P>
<P>Peake was originally a picture-seller by Holbourn-bridge, and had
the honour of being Faithorn's master, and what perhaps he thought
a greater honour, was knighted at Oxford, March 28, 1645. The
disorders of the times confounding all professions, and no profession
being more bound in gratitude to take up arms in the defence of King
Charles, Sir Robert Peake entered into the service and was made a
Lieutenant-colonel and had a command in Basing-house when it was
besieged, where he persuaded his disciple Faithorn to inlist under him,
as the latter in his dedication of the art of graving to Sir Robert ex∣presly
tells him, and where Peake himself was taken prisoner. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a Letter from Oliver Cromwell to the Speaker of the House of Com∣mons, on the reduction of Basing-house. Printed in the Annual Register for 1761.</NOTE> He

<P>PETER OLIVER,</P>

did not confine his talent to single heads. Peter copied in water∣colours
several capital pictures with signal success. By the catalogues

of King Charles I. and King James II. it appears that there were thir∣teen
pieces of this master in the royal collection, chiefly historic minia∣tures;
seven of them are still preserved in Queen Caroline's closet at
Kensington. At the Earl of Exeter's at Burleigh is the story of Venus
and Adonis, painted by Peter, and dated 1631. Vertue mentions
another, which was in Mr. Halsted's sale in May, 1726; it represented
Joseph, the Virgin, and the Child a-sleep, eight inches wide and five
high. On it was written his name, with the termination French, P.
Olivier fecit, 1628. Another piece, a fine drawing in indian ink, was
copied by him from a picture of Raphael in the collection of King
Charles, St. John presenting a cross to the child, kneeling before the
Virgin. The original was sold after the King's death to the Spanish
Embassador for 600<HI>l.</HI> Jerome Laniere bought Peter's drawing, and
sold it for twenty guineas to Mr. John Evelyn, from whom it came to
the present Sir John Evelyn. The Duke of Devonshire has the por∣trait
of Edward 6th. when an infant, the drapery highly ornamented
and finished; a copy from Holbein. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the first edition I, by mistake, ascribed this to Isaac Oliver, but Peter's mark is upon it.</NOTE> Lady Elizabeth Germain has at
Drayton the Madonna and Child. The finest work of Peter Oliver in my
opinion is the head of his own wife, in the cabinet of the Duchess of
Portland: It is life itself. I doubt whether his father ever excelled this
piece. I have a head of the same woman drawn with black lead on
the leaf of a vellom pocket-book; on the reverse is his own portrait
in profile; both masterly: And in black and red chalk I have a
boy's head, larger than he generally painted, of great nature and
vivacity. At Kensington below stairs is the portrait of Peter Oliver by
Hanneman, who painted the wise too; but I know not where the latter
is.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="22"/>
It is extraordinary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Andrew Fountaine lost many miniatures by a fire at White's original chocolate house in St. James's street, about thirty years ago, where he had hired two rooms for a repository of part of his collection. Probably some of the works of the Olivers, of Cooper, &amp;c. were destroyed there.</NOTE> that more of the works <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Peter Oliver etched a few small histories, but Vertue does not specify the subjects.</NOTE> of this excellent master
are not known, as he commonly made duplicates of his pictures, re∣serving
one of each for himself. On this subject Russel the painter,
related to or connected with the Olivers, told Vertue a remarkable
story. The greater part of the collection of King Charles being disper∣sed
in the troubles, among which were several of the Olivers, Charles
II. who remembered, and was desirous of recovering them, made many
inquiries about them after the restoration. At last he was told by one
Rogers <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vertue says he was very great at court; it was probably Progers, well known for being employed in the King's private pleasures. See Memoires de Grammont.</NOTE> of Isleworth that both the father and son were dead, but that
the son's widow was living at Isleworth and had many of their works.
The King went very privately and unknown with Rogers to see them;
the widow showed several finished and unfinished, with many of which
the King being pleased, asked if she would sell them: She replied,
she had a mind the King should see them first, and if he did not pur∣chase
them, she should think of disposing of them. The King disco∣vered
himself, on which she produced some more pictures which she
seldom showed. The King desired her to set her price; she said she did
not care to make a price with his majesty, she would leave it to him;
but promised to look over her husband's books and let his majesty
know what prices his father the late King had paid. The King took
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
away what he liked, and sent Rogers to Mrs. Oliver with the option of
1000<HI>l.</HI> or an annuity of 300<HI>l,</HI> for her life. She chose the latter. Some
years afterwards it happened that the King's mistresses having begged
all or most of these pictures, Mrs. Oliver, who was probably a prude
and apt to express herself like a prude, said, on hearing it, that if she had
thought the King would have given them to such whores, and strum∣pets
and bastards, he never should have had them. This reached the
court, the poor woman's salary was stopped, and she never received it
afterwards. The rest of the limnings which the King had not taken,
fell into the hands of Mrs. Russel's father.</P>
<P>Peter Oliver, says Vertue, died about the year 1664, aged near 60;
but this must be a mistake, as his father's drawing at Kensington
finished by the son is dated 1616, when by that account Peter was not
above twelve years old. From his age and the story of his widow it
is more likely that he died before the restoration. Probably the date
1664 should be 1654. He was buried with his father in the Black∣sryars.</P>
<P>As in none of these accounts mention is made of any children of
Peter Oliver, I conclude that Isaac Oliver, glass-painter, born in 1616,
was son of the younger brother James. Among the verses printed by
the university of Cambridge in 1638 on the death of Mr. Edward
King, Milton's Lycidas, one of the English copies is inscribed, Isaac
Oliver, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Peck's life of Milton, p. 36.</NOTE> who, I suppose, was the glass-painter, and then about the age
of twenty-two, as appears from the following inscription on a painted
window in Christ-church Oxford, <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/>liver aetat. suae 84, anno 1700,

his family, served almost alone to preserve the secret of painting on
glass—a secret which however has never been lost, as I shall show in a
moment by a regular series of the professors. The first interruption
given to it was by the reformation, which banished the art out of
churches; yet it was in some measure kept up in the escutcheons of the
nobility and gentry in the windows of their seats. Towards the end of
Queen Elizabeth it was omitted even there, yet the practice did not en∣tirely
cease. The chapel of our Lady at Warwick was ornamented
a-new by Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester and his Countess, and the
cypher of the glass-painter's name yet remains with the date 1574;
and in some of the chapels at Oxford the art again appears dating it∣self
in 1622 by the hand of no contemptible master. I could supply
even the gap of forty-eight years by many dates on Flemish glass, but
nobody ever supposed that the secret was lost so early as the reign of
James I. and that it has not perished since will be evident from the fol∣lowing
series reaching to the present hour.</P>

surpassed by his own singular modesty. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It may not be unwelcome to the curious reader to see some anecdotes of the revival of taste for painted glass in England. Price, as I have said, was the only painter in that style for many years in England. Afterwards, one Rowell, a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mber at Reading, did some things, particularly for the late Henry Earl of Pem∣broke, but Rowell's colours soon vanished. At last he found out a very durable and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tifull red, but he died in a year or two and the secret with him. A man at Birmingham began the same art in 1756, or 57, and fitted up a window for Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the church of Hagley, but soon broke. A little after him one Peckitt at York, began the same business, and has made good proficience. A few lovers of the art collected some dispersed panes from ancient buildings, particularly the late Lord Cobham, who erected a gothic temple at Stowe, and filled it with arms of the old Nobility, &amp;c. About the year 1753, one Asciotti an Italian, who had married a Flemish woman, brought a parcel of painted glass from Flanders, and sold it for a very few guineas to the Hon. Mr. Bateman of Old Windsor. Upon that I sent Asciotti again to Flanders, who brought me 450 pieces, for which, including the expence of his journey, I paid him thirty-six guineas. His wife made more journeys for the same purpose, and sold her cargoes to one Pal∣mer, a glazier in St. Martin's-lane, who immediately raised the price to one, two, five guineas for a single piece, and fitted up entire windows with them, and with mosaics of plain glass of different colours. In 176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Paterson, an auctioneer at Essex-house in the Strand, exhibited the first auctions of painted glass, imported in like manner from Flanders. All this manufacture consisted in rounds of scrip∣ture-stories,

<P>though of a very inferior walk in the profession, deserves to be remem∣bered
for his uncommon excellence in his way. He was son of Dr.
Robert Norgate, master of Bennet-college Cambridge, where Edward
was born. He was brought up by Nicholas Felton Bishop of Ely who
married his mother, and who observing his inclination to limning and
heraldry, permitted him to indulge his genius. As he had good judg∣ment
in pictures, he was sent into Italy by the great collector, Thomas
Earl of Arundel, to purchase for him, but returning by Marseilles and
by some accident being disappointed of the remittances he expected,
and totally unknown there, he was observed by a French gentleman
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
to walk many hours every day on the cours in a disconsolate manner.
The gentleman inquiring into his circumstances, told him, that percei∣ving
he was able to walk at least twenty miles a day, if he would set
out on his journey homewards, he would furnish him handsomely for
a footman, by which assistance Norgate arrived in his own country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Worthies in Cambridgeshire.</NOTE>
Among the accounts of the Lord Harrington quoted above, is the fol∣lowing
entry;</P>
<P>Paid to Edward Norgate by warrant from the council April 24,
1613, for his paynes taken to write and lymne in gold and colours
certain letters written from his majesty to the King of Persia, the sum
of ten pounds.</P>
<P>These letters were undoubtedly in answer to those brought by that
singular adventurer Sir Antony Shirley, embassador <HI>from</HI> the Sophy <HI>to</HI>
his own sovereign.</P>
<P>The warrant for restoring the use of the old English march, which
I have set forth in the Catalogue of Noble Authors, was illuminated
by this person; but the best evidence of his abilities is a curious patent
lately discovered. The present Earl of Stirling received from a relation
an old box of neglected writings, among which he found the original
commission of Charles I. appointing his Lordship's predecessor Alexan∣der
Earl of Stirling commander in chief of Nova-Scotia with the con∣firmation
of the grant of that province made by James I. In the initial
letter are the portraits of the King sitting on the throne delivering the
patent to the Earl, and round the border representations in miniature
of the customs, huntings, fishings and productions of the country, all
in the highest preservation, and so admirably executed, that it was be∣lieved
of the pencil of Vandyck. But as I know no instance of that
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
master having painted in this manner, I cannot doubt but it was the
work of Norgate, allowed the best illuminator of that age, and gene∣rally
employed, says Fuller, to make the initial letters in the patents of
Peers and commissions of Embassadors. Fuller concludes his account
of him in these words; "He was an excellent herald by the title of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> , <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is extraordinary that Fuller, who was acquainted with him, did not know the title of his office. It appears by the warrant for the march that Norgate was Windsor-herald. He was also clerk of the signet. V. Masters's History of Cor∣pus Christi Coll. Camb. p. 118.</NOTE> and which was the crown of all, a right honest man. Exem∣plary
his patience in his sickness (whereof I was an eye witness) though
a complication of diseases, stone, ulcer in the bladder, &amp;c. seized on
him." He died at the Herald's office Dec. 23, 1650.

<P>SOLOMON DE CAUS,</P>
<P>a Gascon, was Prince Henry's drawing-master. All <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have learnt that the front of Wilton by Inigo Jones, was conducted by this De Caus.</NOTE> we know of him
is that in 1612, the year of the Prince's death, he published a book,
intituled, La Perspective ou Raison des ombres et miroirs, with several
engraved plates, folio. It is addressed from Richmond palace to Prince
Henry, after he had been, as he tells his Highness two or three years
in his service; and another tract in folio on mechanic powers, 1628.</P>
<P>This young Prince was a great lover of the arts, and laid the foun∣dation
of the collection, which his brother compleated. The medals
were purchased by him, and Vanderdort, in his catalogue, mentions
several statues and pictures which King Charles inherited from Prince
Henry. In the appendix to Birch's life of this Prince are several let∣ters
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
from Sir Edward Conway, in one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 486.</NOTE> of which he mentions having
bought a picture of the Four Evangelists, whom he calls affectedly,
<HI>the most faithfull, glorious and excellent secretaries that ever were to tbe in∣finite
incomprehensible Prince</HI>; desiring Mr. Adam Newton, <HI>secretary to
the most hopefull, powerfull and glorious earthly Prince,</HI> to present it to his
Royal Highness; and in others is much talk of a negotiation in which
he was employed by the same Prince to engage an eminent painter of
Delft to come to England. This was <HI>Mireveldt,</HI> who had many solli∣citations
afterwards from King Charles on the same head; but none
succeeded. The printed letters are from the Harleian MSS. and de∣scribe
Mireveldt as very fantastic and capricious. Mr. West has two
others, one from Mireveldt to Sir Edward Conway, the other from Sir
Edward, in which appears the cause of Mireveldt's uncertainty; he was
afraid of being stayed in England by authority, and stipulated that he
should have liberty to return in three months.—In 1625 he had again
engaged to come but was prevented by the breaking out of the plague.
Mireveldt is said to have painted five thousand portraits; there
are some in England of his hand, as Henry Earl of Southampton at
Woburn; Sir Ralph Winwood; a fine whole length at Kimbolton of
Robert Rich Earl of Warwick, and a print of Robert Earl of Lindsey
by Vorst 1631, was engraved from a picture of Mireveldt, but these por∣traits
must have been painted when those persons followed the wars
and their business abroad.</P>

only positive for the former aera, but affirms that at the motion of
King James himself, who gave two thousand pounds towards the un∣dertaking,
Sir Francis Crane erected the house at Mortlack for the ex∣ecution
of the design; and this is confirmed by authentic evidence:
In Rymer's Foedera <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. xviii. p. 66.</NOTE> is an acknowledgment from King Charles in the
very first year of his reign that he owes 6000<HI>l.</HI> to Sir Francis Crane

<P>For three suits of gold tapestry for our use we stand indebted to Sir

Sir Francis Crane also allowed more 2000<HI>l.</HI> yearly for the better main∣tenance
of the said worke of tapestries for ten years to come.</P>
<P>It is plain by this deed that the manufacture was then arrived at
great perfection. Another suit of hangings, executed at the same
place, and representing the five senses, was in the palace at Oatlands:
They were sold in 1649 for 270<HI>l.</HI> At Hampton-court are some of
the cartoons.</P>
<P>The beautifull hangings at Lord Orford's at Houghton, containing
whole lengths of King James, King Charles, their Queens, and the
King of Denmark, with heads of the royal children in the borders,
were in all probability the production of the same manufacture.</P>

<P>At Knowle is a piece of the same tapestry, wrought in silk, contain∣ing
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
the portraits of Vandyck and Sir Francis himself. Mrs. Mark∣ham,
whose maiden name was Crane, and a descendent of Sir Francis,
has a half length portrait in tapestry of her ancestor, with the collar of
St. George over his shoulders. She has also a picture in the same
manufacture of St. George and the dragon. She is a Roman Catho∣lic
Lady and lives in Lincolnshire. At Lord Ilchester's at Redlinch
in Somersetshire is a suit of hangings of this manufacture, represent∣ing
the twelve months in compartments. I have seen several more sets
of the same design; the habits are of the court of Francis 1st. and one
of the months represents a Gentleman and Lady riding together to
hawk.</P>
<P>Of this person I find no farther record with relation to the arts, but
that he made a present to the King of a sea-piece painted by Persellis;
and was dead when Vanderdort drew up the catalogue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King Charles's catalogue page 13. He went to Paris to be cut for the stone in the bladder in 1635, and probably died there. He was at that time engaged in a suit in the star-chamber with Sir Robert Osborne, an old servant of King James, who had mortgaged to Crane for 7500<HI>l.</HI> the Royal manor of Grafton of which he was only tenant. See Strafford papers, vol. i. p. 361. 336. 524. He was sometime chancellor of the garter, and founded five additional Alms-knights, by his will dated in 1635. See Aubrey's history of Surrey, vol. 3 page 206. In Rymer is a patent granting to him and Frances Duchess of Richmond and Lenox the monopoly of farthings for seventeen years.

will be mentioned again in the article of Francesco Cleyne.</P>
<P>Sculpture was carried to no great height in the reign of James:

<P>NICHOLAS STONE</P>
<P>

was the statuary most in vogue. He was born at Woodbury near
Exeter, in 1586, and coming to London, lived for some time with one
Isaac James. He then went to Holland, where he worked for Peter
de Keyser, whose daughter he married; and returning to England was
employed in making monuments for persons of the first distinction.

In 1616 he was sent to Edinburgh to work in the King's chapel there.
In 1619 he was engaged on the building of the banquetting-house;
and in the beginning of the reign of King Charles he received his pa∣tent

Besides these works Stone in 1629 undertook to build for the Earl
of Holland at Kensington two piers of good Portland stone to hang a

<P>He built the great gate of St. Mary's church, and the stone gates for

Danby, by whom (as by some other persons) he was employed even as
an architect. The Earl ordered Stone to design a house for him at
Cornbury, and to direct the workmen, for which he was paid 1000<HI>l.</HI>

the pulpit in this church. Mary his wife and Nicholas his son, lye
also buried in the same grave. She died November 19th, and He on
the 17th of September, 1647. H. S. posuit."</P>
<P>Stone had three sons, Henry, Nicholas, and John. The two eldest
were sent to Italy to study; the youngest was educated at Oxford, being
designed for a clergyman, but in the civil war he entered into the army
on the King's side. During that period this John Stone published a
book on fortification, called Enchiridion, with many small cuts etched
by himself but without his name. The King's forces being routed,
young Stone and a companion made their escape; the latter was taken
and hanged before his father's door in Smithfield, but Stone hid him∣self
in his father's house in Long-acre for above a twelve-month, with∣out
the knowledge, says Vertue, of his father, whence I suppose, he
had either offended the old man by quitting his studies for arms, or the
father was too prudent to risk the emoluments of his profession by en∣gaging
in party-dissentions. John at last found means of retiring to
France, where he lived some years, and, I conclude, applied himself to
the arts, as we shall find him after his return engaged in his father's
business. Nicholas, the second son, was of a promising genius; and
while abroad modelled after the antiques so well, that his works have
been mistaken for the best Italian masters. Mr. Bird the statuary had
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
the Laocoon and Bernini's Apollo and Daphne in Terra cotta by this
Nicholas Stone, and Vertue saw a book with many of his drawings of
palaces, churches, and other buildings in Italy. He returned to Eng∣land
in 1642, and died the same year as his father.</P>
<P>Henry, the eldest son, who erected the monument for his father,
mother, and brother, carried on, in conjunction with John, the business
of statuary, after his father's death; though Henry addicted himself
chiefly to painting, and was an excellent copyist of Vandyck and the
Italian masters: He is generally known by the name of <HI>Old Stone,</HI> I
suppose to distinguish him from his brother John. Henry wrote a
book, a thin folio, entituled the third part of the art of painting, taken
mostly from the ancients. Vertue, who saw this book, was uncertain
whether the two former parts were composed by Stone, or by some
other author. The accounts of Nicholas Stone, sen. which I have
quoted above, were continued by John, while he and Henry worked in
partnership; among other articles are the following;</P>
<P>"In the year of our Lord 1659 my brother and I made a tomb for
the Lord Ashley, for which we had 60<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>"Formerly I made a little tomb of white marble, being an eagle
with an escutcheon upon his breast, sett up at Sunning in Barkshire,

<P>"In Ano. 1656 I sett up a little tomb in the Temple church for Sir
John Williams, and had for it 10<HI>l.</HI> It was an eagle of white marble."
There are but fifteen monuments entered in this account, the prices of
none of which rise above 100<HI>l.</HI> Consequently the sons, I suppose,
never attained the reputation of the father.</P>

<P>John Stone, the last of the family, died soon after the Restoration;

paintings, models, &amp;c. particularly many portraits of the family in

great works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account Vertue received from Stoakes, the relation of Stone, mentioned in the preceding article.</NOTE> here; he built Audley-inn, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Audley-Inn, near Walden in Essex, was an immense pile of building; the rooms large, but some of them not lofty in proportion, and a gallery of ninety-five yards, which with the chapel, and great Council Chamber, each projecting back∣wards from the ends of the gallery, have been demolished. The present chapel was lately fitted up. The screen accompanying the ascent of steps from the hall was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, and has no relation to the rest of the build∣ing. That injudicious architect too advised the destruction of the first court which consisted of noble corridores supported by columns of alabaster, in the room of which he built two ugly brick walls which cost 1600<HI>l.</HI> The marble pillars of the chapel were purchased by Lord Onslow. King William bought thence some suits of tapestry, now at Windsor, for which he paid 4500<HI>l.</HI> The drawing∣room, called the fish-room, is a noble chamber; the cieling and a deep frieze a∣dorned in stucco with sea-monsters and great fishes swimming. All the costly chimney-pieces have been sold: Over that in the gallery were the labours of Her∣cules, and in the cieling, the loves of the Gods. Many of the friezes still ex∣tant are in very good taste. It was erected by THOMAS Howard Earl of Suffolk, Lord Treasurer in the reign of James I. and was generally supposed to be found∣ed on Spanish gold, his Countess, who had great sway with him, being notorious∣ly corrupt. There is a whole length of her in the hall at Gorhambury. She was mother of the memorable Frances Countess of Essex and Somerset; whose escutcheon still (1762) remains entire in the chancel of the church at Walden, one of the lightest and most beautifull parish churches I have seen.</NOTE> and the greater part of Nor∣thumberland-house,

<P>Before the portal of that palace was altered by the present Earl of Nor∣thumberland,
there were in a freeze near the top in large capitals
C. AE. an enigma long inexplicable to antiquarians. Vertue found
that at the period when the house was built, lived Chrismas, an archi∣tect
and carver of reputation, who gave the design of Aldersgate, and
cut the basrelief on it of James I. on horseback, and thence concluded
that those letters signified, Chrismas aedificavit. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the new description of London vol. 5, it is said, that from some letters on the front, when it was last rebuilt, it was inferred, that one Moses Glover was the architect, which is not improbable, as that great curiosity at Sion-house, the survey of Sion and the neighbouring villages, was performed by Moses Glover, painter and architect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. In that valuable plan are views of the royal houses and seats in the neighbourhood.</NOTE> Jansen probably built
the house, which was of brick, and the frontispiece, which was of stone,
was finished by Chrismas. The carvers of the great ship, built at Wool∣wich
by Mr. Peter Pett in 1637, were John and Mathias Chrismas,
sons of Gerard. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vertue had seen a printed copy of verses in praise of the father.</NOTE></P>
<P>JOHN SMITHSON</P>
<P>was an architect in the service of the Earls of Newcastle. He built
part of Welbeck in 1604, the riding-house <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As appears by his name over the gate.</NOTE> there in 1623, and the
stables in 1625; and when William Cavendish, Earl and afterwards
<PB N="39" REF="49"/>
Duke of Newcastle, proposed to repair and make great additions to
Bolsover-castle, Smithson, it is said, was sent to Italy to collect designs.
From them I suppose it was that the noble apartment erected by that
Duke, and lately pulled down, was compleated, Smithson dying in
1648. Many of Smithson's drawings were purchased by the late Lord
Byron from his descendents who lived at Bolsover, in the chancel of
which church Smithson is buried with this inscription;

at Chatsworth.</P>
<P>I shall conclude what I have to say on the reign of King James, with
a brief account of a few of his medallists. This article is one of the
most deficient in Vertue's notes; he had found but very slight materials,
though equally inquisitive on this head with the rest. One must ex∣cept
the subject of the two Simons, of whose works as he himself pub∣lished
a most curious volume, I shall omit the mention of them in this
catalogue, only desiring that Vertue's account of the two Simons and
Hollar, and the catalogues of the collections of King Charles, King
James and the Duke of Buckingham, may be regarded as parts of this
his great design. By those specimens one sees how perfect he wished
and laboured to make the whole.</P>
<P>I was in hopes of compleating this article, by having recourse to
Mr. Evelyn's Discourse on Medals, but was extremely disappointed to
sind that in a folio volume, in which he has given the plates and in∣scriptions
of a regular series of our medals, he takes not the least no∣tice
of the gravers. I should not have expected that a virtuoso so know∣ing
would have contented himself with descriptions of the persons re∣presented,
he who had it in his inclination, and generally in his power,
to inform posterity of almost every thing they would wish to learn.
Had Mr. Evelyn never regretted his ignorance of the names of the
workmen of those inimitable medals of the Seleucidae, of the fair
<PB N="41" REF="51"/>
coins of Augustus, and of the Denarii of the other Roman Emperors?
Was he satisfied with possessing the effigies of Tiberius, Claudius, Irene,
without wishing to know the names of the ingenious and more harmless
gravers—Why did he think posterity would not be as curious to learn
who were the medallists of Charles II. James I. Mary I.? He has
omitted all names of gravers except in two or three of the plates,
and even there says not a word of the artist. For instance in a
medal of Charles I. p. 113, under the King's bust are the letters
N. R. F. I cannot discover who this N. R. was. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unless it was Norbert Rotier, who arrived in the reign of Charles II. In that case, the medal in question must have been executed after the Restoration.</NOTE> Thomas Rawlins
was a graver of the mint about that time; perhaps he had a brother
who worked in partnership with him. I was so surprized at this omis∣sion,
that I concluded Mr. Evelyn must have treated of the gravers
in some other part of the work. I turned to the index, and to my
greater surprize found almost every thing but what I wanted. In the
single letter <HI>N.</HI> which contains but twenty-six articles, are the follow∣ing
subjects, which I believe would puzzle any man to guess how they
found their way into a discourse on medals;

<P>In short, Mr. Evelyn, who loved to know, was too fond of telling
<PB N="42" REF="52"/>
the world all he knew. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other branches of science, if one can call it so, Mr. Evelyn studied Physiognomy, and found dissimulation, boldness, cruelty and ambition in every touch and stroke of Fuller's picture of Oliver Cromwell's face, which he says, was the most resembling portrait of the Protector. In Vandyck's Earl of Strafford, a steady, serious, and judicious countenance; and so in many others whose charac∣ters from knowing their history he fancied he saw in their features. How his di∣vination would have been puzzled if he had been shown a picture of Cromwell in the contemptible appearance, which, Sir Philip Warwick says, he made at his first entry into the House of Commons. Or if my Lord Strafford had continued to oppose the court, and had never changed sides, would Mr. Evelyn have sound his countenance so STEADY and JUDICIOUS?</NOTE> His virtue, industry, ingenuity, and learning,
were remarkable; one wishes he had written with a little more judg∣ment—or
perhaps it is not my interest to wish so; it would be more
prudent to shelter under his authority any part of this work that is not
much to the purpose.</P>
<P>All this author says <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 239.</NOTE> of our medallists is, that we had Symons,
Rawlins, Mr. Harris, Christian, &amp;c. and then refers us to his Chalco∣graphy,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page 49.</NOTE> where indeed he barely names two more, Restrick and John∣son,
of whom I can find no other account. The reader must therefore
accept what little is scattered up and down in Vertue's MSS. I have
already mentioned one or two in the preceding volume. The first
graver I meet in the reign of James is</P>
<P>CHARLES ANTONY,</P>
<P>to whom Sir Thomas Knyvet, master of the mint in the second of that
<PB N="43" REF="53"/>
King, paid by warrant 40<HI>l.</HI> for gold and workmanship, for graving an
offering piece of gold, Anthony having then the title of the King's
graver. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have a thin plate of silver larger than a crown piece, representing King James on his throne. It is very neat workmanship, and probably by this Antony.</NOTE> Vertue supposes this person made the medal in 1604 on the
peace with Spain, a medal not mentioned by Evelyn, and that he con∣tinued
in office 'till 1620. Mr. Anstis informed him of a warrant to
a brother of Charles Antony, called</P>
<P>THOMAS ANTONY</P>
<P>curatori monetae et sigillorum regis ad cudendum magnum sigillum

these brothers do I find any other traces.</P>
<P>THOMAS BUSHELL</P>
<P>was probably a medallist of the same age. In the year 1737 Mr.
Compton produced at the Antiquarian Society, as I find by their
minutes, a gold medal, larger than a crown piece; on one side Lord
Chancellor Bacon in his hat and robes, with this legend, Bacon Viceco.

<P>NICHOLAS BRIOT</P>

in which kingdom he was the inventor, or at least one of the first pro∣posers
<PB N="44" REF="54"/>
of coining money by a press, instead of the former manner of
hammering. As I am ignorant myself in the mechanic part of this
art, and have not even the pieces quoted by Vertue, I shall tread very
cautiously, and only transcribe the titles of some memorials which he
had seen, and from whence I conclude a litterary controversy was car∣ried
on in France on the subject of this new invention, to which, ac∣cording
to custom, the old practicioners seem to have objected, as,
probably interfering with the abuses of which they were in prescriptive
possession.</P>

The Luther, Briot, I suppose, miscarried, as we soon afterwards find
him in the service of the crown of England, where projectors were
more favorably received. From these circumstances I conclude he ar∣rived
in the reign of King James, though he did not make his way to
court before the accession of King Charles, the patron of genius.
Briot's first public work was a medal of that Prince exhibited in Eve∣lyn,
with the artist's name and the date 1628. To all or to almost all
his coins and medals he put at least the initial letter of his name. He
was employed both in England and Scotland. In 1631, as appears by
<PB N="45" REF="55"/>
Rymer's Foedera, tom xix. p. 287, a special commission was appointed
for making trial of the experience skill and industry of Nicholas
Briot, in the coinage of money at the mint, dated June 13, 1631, at
Westminster. This was the project he had attempted in France, by
instruments, mills and presses, to make better money and with less ex∣pence
to the crown than by the way of hammering. The scheme was
probably approved, for in the very next year we find him coining mo∣ney
upon the regular establishment. There is extant a parchment roll,
containing the accounts of Sir Robert Harley, Knight of the Bath,
master worker of his majesty's monies of gold and silver within the
tower of London, in the reign of King Charles I. from November 8,
1628, to August 1, 1636. In this account, in 1632 are payments to
Briot for coining various parcels of gold and silver, which are followed
by this entry.</P>
<P>"And delivered to his majestie in fair silver monies at Oatlands by
Sir Thomas Aylesbury, viz. iij crownes, and iij half crownes of Briot's
moneys, and iij crownes, and iij half crownes, and ten shillings of the
monoyers making."</P>
<P>These comparative pieces were probably presented to the King by Sir
Robert Harley, Briot's patron, to show the superior excellence of the
latter's method.</P>
<P>Briot returned to France about 1642, having formed that excellent
scholar Thomas Simon.</P>
<P>In a private family (the name of which he does not mention) Vertue
saw a peachstone, on which was carved the head of King Charles full
faced, with a laurel, and on the reverse, St. George on horseback, with
the garter round it; and on one side above the King's head, these let∣ters
<GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/>. The tradition in that family was, that the carver having been
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>
removed from the service of the crown, and at last obtaining the place
of poor Knight at Windsor, cut that curiosity to show he was not su∣perannuated
nor incapable of his office as he had been represented. If
the mark <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> signified Nicholas Briot, as is probable, either the story
is fictitious, or Briot did not return to France on the breaking out of the
civil war. The latter is most likely, as in the Treasury, where the plate
of St. George's chapel is deposited, there is such another piece, though
inferior in workmanship to that above-mentioned. In the Museum at
Oxford are two small carvings in wood, Christ on the cross and the
Nativity, with the same cypher <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> on each.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CHARLES I. His Love and Protection of the Arts, Ac∣counts
of Vanderdort and Sir Balthazar Gerbiere.
Dispersion of the King's Collection, and of the Earl
of Arundel's.</HEAD>
<P>THE accession of this Prince was the first aera of real taste in
England. As his temper was not profuse, the expence he
made in collections, and the rewards he bestowed on men of
true genius and merit, are proofs of his judgment. He knew how
and when to bestow. Queen Elizabeth was avaricious with pomp;
James I. lavish with meanness. A prince who patronizes the arts, and
can distinguish abilities, enriches his country, and is at once generous
and an oeconomist. Charles had virtues to make a nation happy; for∣tunate,
if he had not thought, that he alone knew how to make them
happy, and that he alone ought to have the power of making them so!</P>
<P>His character, as far as it relates to my subject, is thus given by
Lilly; "He had many excellent parts in nature, was an excellent
<PB N="48" REF="58"/>
horseman, would shoot well at a mark, had singular skill in limning,
was a good judge of pictures, a good mathematician, not unskillfull in
music, well read in divinity, excellently in history and law, he spoke
several languages, and writ well, good language and style." Perinchief
is still more particular; "His soul, says that writer, was stored with a
full knowledge of the nature of things, and easily comprehended almost
all kinds of arts that either were for delight or of a public use; for he
was ignorant of nothing, but of what he thought it became him to be
negligent, for many parts of learning, that are for the ornament of a
private person, are beneath the cares of a crowned head. He was well
skilled in things of antiquity, could judge of medals whether they had
the number of years they pretended unto; his libraries and cabinets
were full of those things on which length of time put the value of rari∣ties.
In painting he had so excellent a fancy, that he would supply the
defect of art in the workman, and suddenly draw those lines, give those
airs and lights, which experience and practice had not taught the
painter. He could judge of fortifications, and censure whether the
cannon were mounted to execution or no. He had an excellent skill
in guns, knew all that belonged to their making. The exactest arts of
building ships for the most necessary uses of strength or good sailing,
together with all their furniture, were not unknown to him. He un∣derstood
and was pleased with the making of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Oughtred made a horizontal instrument for delineating dials, for him; "Elias Allen, says that celebrated mathematician, having been sworn his maje∣sty's servant had a purpose to present his majesty with some new-year's gift, and requested me to devise some pretty instrument for him. I answered that I have heard that his majesty delighted much in the great concave dial at Whitehall; and what fitter instrument could he have than my horizontal, which was the very same represented in flat." Biogr. Brit. vol. 5. p. 3279. Delamain, another mathema∣tician, made a ring dial for the King, which his majesty valued so much, that, on the morning before he was beheaded, he ordered it to be given to the Duke of York, with a book showing it's use, ib. p. 3283.</NOTE> clocks and watches.
<PB N="49" REF="59"/>
He comprehended the art of printing. There was not any one gentle∣man
of all the three kingdoms that could compare with him in an uni∣versality
of knowledge. He encouraged all the parts of learning, and
he delighted to talk with all kind of artists, and with so great a facility
did apprehend the mysteries of their professions, that he did sometimes
say, "He thought he could get his living, if necessitated, by any trade
he knew of, but making of hangings;" although of these he under∣stood
much, and was greatly delighted in them; for he brought some
of the most curious workmen from foreign parts to make them here
in England." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Charles I. at the end of the Icon Basilike. edit. 1727.</NOTE></P>
<P>With regard to his knowledge of pictures, I find the following anec∣dote
from a book called the original and growth of printing by Rich∣ard
Atkyns <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> "This excellent Prince, says that author, who was
not only aliquis in omnibus, but singularis in omnibus, hearing of rare
heads (painted) amongst several other pictures brought me from Rome,
sent Sir James Palmer to bring them to Whitehall to him, where were
present divers picture-drawers and painters. He asked them all of
whose hand that was? some guest at it; others were of another opi∣nion,
but none was positive. At last said the King, This is of such a
man's hand, I know it as well as if I had seen him draw it; but, said
he, is there but one man's hand in this picture? None did discern
whether there was or not; but most concluded there was but one hand.
<PB N="50" REF="60"/>
Said the King, "I am sure there are two hands have workt in it, for
I know the hand that drew the heads, but the hand that did the rest I
never saw before." Upon this a gentleman that had been at Rome
about ten years before, affirmed that he saw this very picture, with the
two heads unfinished at that time, and that he heard his brother (who
staid there some years after him) say, that the widow of the painter
that drew it wanting money, got the best master she could find to finish
it and make it saleable." This story which in truth is but a blind one,
especially as Mr. Atkyns does not mention even the name of the
painter of his own picture, seems calculated to prove a fact, of which
I have no doubt, his majesty's knowledge of hands. The gentleman
who stood by and was so long before he recollected so circumstantial
a history of the picture, was, I dare say, a very good courtier.</P>
<P>The King is said not only to have loved painting but to have prac∣ticed
it; it is affirmed that Rubens corrected some of his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Piles, in his life of Rubens, says, that the King's mother-in-law, Mary de' Medici designed well.</NOTE> majesty's
drawings.</P>
<P>It was immediately after his accession that Charles began to form his
collection. The crown was already in possesssion of some good pictures:
Henry VIII. had several. What painters had been here had added
others. Prince Henry, as I have said, had begun a seperate collection
both of paintings and statues. All these Charles assembled, and sent
commissions into France and Italy to purchase more. Cross <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vincentio Carducci in his dialogo della pittura printed at Madrid in 1633, calls him Michael de la Crux; others say it was Henry Stone jun. who was sent to Spain. When Charles was at that court, the King of Spain gave him a cele∣brated picture by Titian called the Venus del Pardo, see catal. p. 103; and the Cain and Abel by John of Bologna, which King Charles afterwards bestowed on the Duke of Buckingham, who placed it in the garden of York-house. See Peacham, p. 108. From Whitlocke p. 24. we have the following information. "In December the Queen was brought to bed of a second daughter named Eli∣zabeth. To congratulate her majesty's safe delivery, the Hollanders sent hither a solemn ambassy and a noble present, a large piece of ambergrease, two fair china basons almost transparent, a curious clock, and four rare pieces of Tintoret's and Titian's painting. Some supposed that they did it to ingratiate the more with our King, in regard his fleet was so powerfull at sea, and they saw him resolved to maintain his right and dominion there."</NOTE> was dis∣patched

<PB N="51" REF="61"/>
as soon as the royal taste was known, many were brought over and
offered to sale at court. The ministers and nobility were not back∣ward
with presents of the same nature. Various are the accounts of
the jewels and bawbles presented to magnificent Elizabeth. In the ca∣talogue
of King Charles's collection are recorded the names of several
of the court who ingratiated themselves by offerings of pictures and
curiosities. But the noblest addition was made by the King himself:
He purchased at a great <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lowest I have heard was 20,000<HI>l.</HI> So R. Symondes said. At Ken∣sington are several pieces of the Venetian and Lombard schools, in uniform frames of black and gold, the pictures themselves much damaged. These I take to have been part of the collection from Mantua.</NOTE> price the entire cabinet of the Duke of
Mantua, then reckoned the most valuable in Europe. But several of
those pictures were spoiled by the quicksilver on the frames, owing I
suppose to carelessness in packing them up. Vanderdort, from whom
alone we have this account, does not specify all that suffered, though in
general he is minute even in describing their frames. The list, valu∣able
as it is, notwithstanding all it's blunders, inaccuracy, and bad

English, was I believe never compleated, which might be owing to the
sudden death of the composer. There are accounts in MS. of many
more pictures, indubitably of that collection, not specified in the printed
catalogue.</P>

<P>Abraham Vanderdort, a Dutchman, had worked for the Emperor
Rodolphus, whose service he left we do not know on what occasion.
He brought away with him a bust of a woman modelled in wax as
large as the life, which he had begun for that monarch, but Prince
Henry was so struck with it, that though the Emperor wrote several
times for it, the young Prince would neither part with the work nor the
workman, telling him he would give him as good entertainment as any
Emperor would—and indeed Vanderdort seems to have made no bad
bargain. He parted with the bust to the Prince upon condition, that
as soon as the cabinet, then building from a design of Inigo Jones,
should be finished, he should be made keeper of his Royal Highness's
medals with a salary of 50<HI>l.</HI> a year; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Birch's life of Prince Henry, append. p. 467, and Rymer vol. 18, p. 100.</NOTE> a contract voided by the death

great awe of Charles I. The King had recommended to him to take

young had been sent over in 1604 to draw the portrait of some lady of
great rank retired hither from Paris, was invited by King Charles with
promise of great rewards to return to England, but declined the offer. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Felibien.</NOTE>
His majesty was desirous too of having something of the hand of Ber∣nini.
Vandyck drew in one piece the full face and the three quarter
face and the profile of the King, from which Bernini made a bust,
that was consumed or stolen in the fire of Whitehall. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is very uncertain what became of this bust: Vertue from several circum∣stances, which I shall lay before the reader, believed it was not destroyed. Cooper the print-seller told him that he had often heard Norrice frame-maker to the court, and who saved several of the pictures, averr, that he was in the room where the bust used to stand over a corner chimney, and that it was taken away before that chamber was destroyed. Lord Cutts who commanded the troops, was impatient to blow up that part, and yet after he had ordered the drums to beat, it was half an hour before the explosion was begun, time enough to have saved the bust, if it was not stolen before. Sir John Stanley, then deputy-chamberlain, was of the latter opinion. He was at dinner in Craig-court when the fire began which was about three o'clock: He immediately went to the palace, and perceived only an inconsiderable smoke in a garret, not in the principal building. He found Sir Christopher Wren and his workmen there, and the gates all shut. Looking at Bernini's bust, he begged Sir Christopher to take care of That, and the statues. The latter replied, "Take you care of what you are concerned in and leave the rest to me." Sir John said it was above five hours after this before the fire reached that part. Norrice afterwards dug in the ruins of that chamber but could not dis∣cover the least fragment of marble. The crouching Venus in the same apartment was known to be stolen, being discovered after a concealment of four years and re∣taken by the crown. Vertue thought that the brazen bust of King Charles in the passage near Westminster-hall, was not taken from Bernini's, of which casts are extant, but of an earlier date. In the imperial library at Vienna, says Dr. Edward Brown in his travels, is a head of King Charles in white marble, but this cannot be Bernini's, as Brown wrote in 1673, and the fire of Whitehall happened in 1697.</NOTE> It was on
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
seeing this picture that Bernini pronounced, as is well known, that
there was something unfortunate in the countenance of Charles. The
same artist made a bust too of Mr. Baker, who carried the picture to
Rome. The Duke of Kent's father bought the latter bust at Sir Pe∣ter
Lely's sale; it is now in the possession of Lord Royston, and was
reckoned preferable to that of the King. The hair is in prodigious
quantity and incomparably loose and free; the point-band very fine.
Mr. Baker paid Bernini an hundred broad pieces for his, but for the
King's Bernini received a thousand Roman crowns. The King was
so pleased with his own, that he desired to have one of the Queen too;
but that was prevented by the war. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the church at Chelsea is a fine monument in a niche for the Lady Jane Cheyney; she is represented lying on her right side, and leaning on a bible. This tomb was the work of Bernini, and cost 500<HI>l.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Among the Strafford papers is an evidence of this Prince's affection
for his pictures: In a <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 130, vol. ii.</NOTE> letter from Mr. Garrard, dated November 9,
1637, speaking of two masks that were to be exhibited that winter, he
says, "A great room is now <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Journal of the House of Commons July 16, 1645. Ordered that the board∣ed masque-house at Whitehall, the masque-house at St. James's and the courts of guard be forthwith pulled down and sold away.</NOTE> building only for this use betwixt the
guard-chamber and banquetting-house of fir, only weather-boarded
and slightly covered. At the marriage of the Queen of Bohemia I saw
one set up there but not of that vastness that this is, which will cost too
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
much money to be pulled down, and yet down it must when the masks
are over."</P>
<P>In another of December 16, the same person says, "Here are two
masks intended this winter; the King is now in practicing his, which
shall be presented at Twelfth-tide, most of the young Lords about the
town, who are good dancers, attend his majesty in this business. The
other the Queen makes at Shrove-tide, a new house being erected in
the first court at Whitehall, which cost the King 2500<HI>l.</HI> only of deal
boards, because the King will not have his pictures in the banquetting∣house
hurt with lights."</P>
<P>The most capital purchase made by King Charles were the cartoons
of Raphael, now at Hampton-court. They had remained in Flanders
from the time that Leo X. sent them thither to be copied in tapestry,
the money for the tapestry having never been paid. Rubens told the
King of them, and where they were, and by his means they were
bought.</P>
<P>It may be of use to collectors and virtuosi, for whose service this
work is composed, to know when they meet with the ruins of that
royal cabinet, or of the Earl of Arundel's. On the King's pictures
was this mark <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> or <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> on his drawings a large star thus <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/>

<P>The dials at Whitehall were erected by the order of Charles, while
he was Prince. Mr. Gunter drew the lines, and wrote the description
and use of them, printed in a small tract by order of King James in
1624. There were five dials; afterwards some were made of glass in a
pyramidal shape by Francis Hill, and placed in the same garden. One
or two of these may still be extant; Vertue saw them at Buckingham∣house
in St. James's park, from whence they were sold.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="71"/>
It looks as if Charles had had some thoughts of erecting a monument
for his father. In the lodgings of the warden of New-college Oxford
was a mausoleum with arms, altar-tomb, columns and inscriptions in
honour of that Prince dated 1630. It is certain King Charles had no less
inclination for architecture than for the other arts. The intended pa∣lace
at Whitehall would have been the most truly magnificent and
beautifull fabric of any of the kind in Europe. His majesty did not
send to Italy and Flanders for architects as he did for Albano and Van∣dyck:
He had Inigo Jones. Under the direction of that genius the
King erected the house at Greenwich.</P>
<P>Charles had in his service another man, both architect and painter,
of whom, though excellent in neither branch, the reader will perhaps
not dislike some account, as he was a remarkable person and is little
known.</P>
<P>Sir Balthazar Gerbier D'ouvilly of Antwerp, was born about 1591,
came young into England, and was a retainer of the Duke of Bucking∣ham
as early as 1613. In Finette's master of the ceremonies it is said,
"Alonzo Contarini Embassador from Venice came to Mr. Gerbier, a
gentleman serving the Duke of Buckingham." Sanderson <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graphice page 15.</NOTE> calls him
a common penman, who pensiled the dialogue (probably the decalogue)
in the Dutch church London, his first rise of preferment." It is cer∣tain

him into Spain, where he was even employed in the treaty of marriage,
though ostensibly acting only in the character of a painter. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He painted small figures in distemper. De Piles. While in Spain he drew the Infanta in miniature, which was sent over to King James.</NOTE> Among

Tanner had a MS. catalogue of the Duke's collection drawn up by
Gerbier who had been employed by the Duke in several of the purcha∣ses.
However there is some appearance of his having fallen into dis∣grace
with his patron. In one of Vertue's MSS. is a passage that seems
to be an extract, though the author is not quoted, in which the Duke
treats Gerbier with the highest contempt. The transcript is so obscure
and imperfect, that I shall give it in Vertue's own words;</P>
<P>"King James I. ill and dying, the Duke of Buckingham was advi∣sed
to apply a plaister to his stomach, which he did with proper advice
of doctors, physicians of the King. But the King dying, the Duke
was blamed—one Eglesham printed a scurrilous <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The title was, "The Forerunners of Revenge, in two petitions, the one to the King, the other to the Parliament; concerning the Duke of Buckingham's poysoning King James, and the Marquis of Hamilton.

The piece itself was transcribed by Mr. Baker of St. John's coll. Camb. from the printed copy in possession of Dr. Za∣chary Grey, editor of Hudibrass. Vide also Loyd's State Worthies, p. 654, 655.</NOTE> libel, and flew away
into Flanders—I was told by Sir Balthazar Gerbier [though his testi∣mony
be odious to any man] that Eglesham dealt with him in Flanders
for a piece of money [not more than 400 guilders to defray the char∣ges]
<PB N="62" REF="74"/>
to imprint his recantation, of which the Duke bid Gerbier join
malice and knavery together, and spit their venom 'till they split, and
he would pay for printing that also."</P>
<P>Nothing can be built upon so vague a foundation. It is certain that
immediately after the accession of King Charles, Gerbier was employed
in Flanders to negotiate privately a treaty with Spain, the very treaty
in which Rubens was commissioned on the part of the Infanta, and for
which end that great painter came to England. Among the Conway∣papers
I found a very curious and long letter from Gerbier himself on
this occasion, which though too prolix to insert in the body of this
work, I shall affix at the end, not only as pertinent to my subject from
the part these painters had in so important a business, but as it is more
particular than any thing I know in print on that occasion.</P>
<P>Gerbier kept his ground after the death of Buckingham. In 1628
he was knighted at Hampton-court, and, as he says himself in one of
his books, was promised by King Charles the office of surveyor-general
of the works after the death of Inigo Jones.</P>
<P>In 1637 he seems to have been employed in some other private
transactions of state, negotiating with the Duke of Orleans, the King's
brother, who was discontented with the court. The Earl of Leicester,
Embassador to Paris, writes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sidney papers vol. ii, p. 528. In one of his dedications mentioned hereafter, Gerbier puts this Lord in mind of his having been in a publick employment when his Lordship was at Paris: and De Piles says that the Duke of Buckingham find∣ing him a man of good understanding, recommended him to the King, who sent him as his agent to Brussels.</NOTE> to Mr. Secretary Windebank Nov. 24.

character of author, but founder of an academy. In that year he pub∣lished

families and lovers of vertue, the first part, by Sir Balthazar Gerbier
Knight. Lond. French and English; with a <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is another print of him, half length, by Pontius after Vandyck, in which he is styled, Bruxellas Prolegatus.</NOTE> print of his head in oval

of this projector's history.</P>
<P>"Sir Balthazar Gerbier's manifestation of greater profits to be done
in the hot than the cold parts of America. Rotterdam 1660. Where∣in
is set forth that he having a commission to go there, settle and make
enquirys, he went to <HI>Cajana</HI> (Cayenne) with his family, and settled at
Surinam. A governor there from the Dutch had orders to seize upon
him and all his papers and bring him back to Holland, which they did
in a very violent manner, breaking into his house, killed one of his
children, endangered the lives of the rest of his family, and narrowly
escaped himself with his life, having a pistol charged at his breast if he
had resisted. They brought him to Holland: He complained, but got
no redress, the states disowning they had given any such orders. How∣ever,
it was just before the restoration, and knowing the obligations he
had to England, they apprehended he might give the King notice of
the advantages might be gained by a settlement there."</P>
<P>This perhaps was one among the many provocations, which, meet∣ing
his inclinations to France, led Charles II. into his impolitic, though
otherwise not wholly unjustifiable, war with Holland, a people too apt
even in their depressed state, to hazard barbarous and brutal infraction
of treaties and humanity, when a glimpse of commercial interest invites
it.</P>
<P>Gerbier probably returned to England with that Prince, for the tri∣umphal
arches erected for his reception, are said to have been designed
by Sir Balthazar.</P>
<P>In France he published a book on fortification, and in 1662 at
London a small discourse on magnificent buildings, dedicated to the
<PB N="65" REF="77"/>
King, in which he principally treats of solidity, convenience and orna∣ment,
and glances at some errors of Inigo Jones in the banquetting∣house.
Here too he mentions a large room built by himself near the
watergate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The gate itself was designed by Inigo.</NOTE> at York-stairs, thirty-five feet square, and says, that King
Charles I. being in it in 1628 at some representation of scenery, com∣mended
it, and expressed as much satisfaction with it as with the ban∣quetting-house.
In the piece he proposes to the Lords and Commons
to level the streets, Fleet-bridge and Cheapside, and erect a sumptuous
gate at Temple-bar, of which he had presented a draught to his ma∣jesty.
Before this book is a different print of him with a ribband and
a medal, inscribed C. R. 1653. The medal I suppose was given him
when appointed, as he says he was, Master of the Ceremonies to
Charles I.</P>
<P>His portrait in one piece with Sir Charles Cotterel and Dobson,
painted by the latter, is at Northumberland-house; Gerbier has been
mistaken in that picture for Inigo Jones. This piece was bought for
44<HI>l.</HI> at the sale of Betterton, the player.</P>
<P>Gerbier's last piece is a small manual, intituled, Counsel and Advice
to all builders, &amp;c. London 1663. A full half of this little piece is
wasted on dedications, of which there are no fewer than forty, and
which he excuses by the example of Antonio Perez. They are ad∣dressed
to the Queen-mother, Duke of York, and most of the principal
Nobility and Courtiers. The last is to his own disciple Captain Wil∣liam
Wind. There is a heap of a kind of various knowledge even in
these dedications, and some curious things, as well as in the book itself,
particularly the prices of work and of all materials for building at that
time. In one place he ridicules the heads of lions, which are creeping
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>
through the pilasters on the houses in Great Queen-street built by
Webb, the scholar of Inigo Jones.</P>
<P>Hempsted-marshal, the seat of Lord Craven, since destroyed by fire,
was the last production of Gerbier. He gave the designs for it, and died
there in 1667 while it was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foundation was laid in 1662.</NOTE> building, and was buried in the chancel
of that church. The house was finished under the direction of Cap∣tain
Wind above-mentioned.</P>
<P>In the library of Secretary Pepys at Magdalen-college Cambridge,
is a miscellaneous collection in French, of robes, manteaux, couronnes,
armes, &amp;c. d'Empereurs, Rois, Papes, Princes, Ducs et Comtes, an∣ciens

<P>Among the Harleian MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 3384, is one, intituled, Sir Baltha∣zar

<P>The late Prince of Wales hearing of a capital picture by Vandyck
in Holland, to which various names of English families were given, as
Sir Balthazar Arundel, Sir Melchior Arundel, Sir Balthazar Bucking∣ham,
or Sheffield, the last of which gained most credit from a resem∣blance
in the arms, his Royal Highness gave a commission to purchase
it, and it was brought to Leicester-house. It appeared that a celebrated
piece, for which Lord Burlington had bid 500<HI>l.</HI> at Lord Radnor's sale,
and which Mr. Scawen <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was again exposed at Mr. Scawen's sale, but bought in, and has since been purchased by Sampson Gideon.</NOTE> bought at a still greater price was the same
with this picture, but not so large nor containing so many figures.
Mr. Scawen's had always passed for a mistress and children of the Duke
of Buckingham; but Vertue discovered on that of the Prince of Wales
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
an almost effaced inscription, written by Vandyck's own hand, with
these words remaining, La famille de Balthazar—Chevalier; and he
showed the Prince that the arms on a flower-pot were the same with
those on two different prints of Gerbier, and allusive to his name, viz.
a chevron between three garbs or sheafs. There is a group of children
on the right hand, very inferior to the rest of the composition, and cer∣tainly
not by Vandyck. The little girl leaning on the mother's knee
was originally painted by Rubens in a separate piece, formerly belong∣ing
to Richardson the painter, since that to General Skelton and Capt.
William Hamilton, and now in the collection of the Lord Viscount
Spenser. It is finer than the large picture—but it is time to return to
King Charles.</P>
<P>The academy erected by Gerbier was probably imitated from one
established by Charles I. in the eleventh year of his reign and called
Museum Minervae. The patent of erection is still extant in the office
of the rolls. None but who could prove themselves gentlemen were
to be admitted to education there, where they were to be instructed in
arts and sciences, foreign languages, mathematics, painting, architec∣ture,
riding, fortification, antiquities and the science of medals. Pro∣fessors
were appointed, and Sir Francis Kingston, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Francis Kingston, who styled himself Corporis Armiger, printed in 1635 a translation into Latin verse of Chaucer's Troilus and Cressida.</NOTE> in whose house in
Covent-garden the academy was held, was named regent. There is a
small account of the design of this academy, with it's rules and orders,
printed in 1636. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At the end of the little edition of Busbequius's Epistles printed at Oxford 1660, is the grant of a coat of arms to the regent and professors of the Museum Minervae from Sir John Burroughs the herald, dated 1635, which arms are pre∣fixed to the rules and orders of that establishment printed 1636. Previous to it's being set on foot, a committee had been appointed in the House of Lords, consist∣ing of the Duke of Buckingham and others, for taking into consideration the state of the public schools and method of education. What progress was made by this committee is not known, but probably the Museum Minervae owed it's rise to it.</NOTE> But it fell to the ground with the rest of the King's
<PB N="68" REF="80"/>
plans and attempts—and so great was the inveteracy to him, that it
seems to have become part of the religion of the time to war on the
arts, because they had been countenanced at court. The parliament
began to sell the pictures at York-house so early as 1645, but lest the
necessity of their affairs should not be thought sufficient justification,
they coloured it over with a piece of fanatic bigotry that was perfectly
ridiculous; passing the following votes among others July 23. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal of the Commons.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ordered, that all such pictures and statues there (York-house) as are
without any superstition, shall be forthwith sold, for the benefit of Ire∣land
and the North.</P>
<P>Ordered, that all such pictures there, as have the representation of
the second person in trinity upon them, shall be forthwith burnt.</P>
<P>Ordered, that all such pictures there, as have the representation of
the Virgin Mary upon them, shall be forthwith burnt.</P>
<P>This was a worthy contrast to Archbishop Laud, who made a star∣chamber-business
of a man who broke some painted glass in the cathe∣dral
at Salisbury. The cause of liberty was then, and is always, the
only cause that can excuse a civil war: yet if Laud had not doated on
trifles, and the presbyterians been squeamish about them, I question
whether the nobler motives would have had sufficient influence to save
us from arbitrary power. They are the slightest objects that make the
<PB N="69" REF="81"/>
deepest impression on the people. They seldom fight for a liberty of
doing what they have a right to do, but because they are prohibited or
enjoined some folly that they have or have not a mind to do. One co∣mical
instance of the humour of those times I find in Aubrey's history
of Surrey; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii, page 30.</NOTE> one Bleese was hired for half-a-crown a day to break the
painted glass windows of the church of Croydon. The man probably
took care not to be too expeditious in the destruction.</P>
<P>Immediately after the death <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I cannot help inserting a short remark here, though foreign to the purpose. The very day after the execution of the King, was passed this vote, "Ordered, That the Lord Grey be desired, out of Haberdasher's-hall, to dispose of one hun∣dred pounds for the service of the commonwealth, <HI>as he shall think fit</HI>: and that the committee at Haberdasher's-hall be required forthwith to pay the same to the said Lord Grey for that purpose." This order is so covertly worded, without any particular application, at the same time that the sum is so small for any public service, that joined to the circumstance of time and the known zeal of the pay∣master, I cannot doubt but this was intended for the reward of the executioner. Mr. West has an authentic account of the execution, in which it is said, that Richard Brandon, the executioner, having sound in the King's pocket an orange stuck with cloves, was offered 20 shillings for it; which he refused, but sold it for ten on his way home.</NOTE> of the King, several votes were passed
for sale of his goods, pictures, statues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Feb. 20, 1648. It was referred to the committee of the navy to raise
money by sale of the crown, jewels, hangings, and other goods of the
late King.</P>
<P>Two days after, Cromwell, who, as soon as he was possessed of the
sole power, stopped any farther <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ludlow prevented the sale of Hampton-court, for which he was much blamed by some of his friends. V. Biogr. Brit. vol. 5. p. 3024.</NOTE> dispersion of the royal collection, and
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>
who even in this trifling instance gave an indication of his views, re∣ported
from the council of state, that divers goods belonging to the
state were in danger of being embezzled; which notification was im∣mediately
followed by this order;</P>
<P>That the care of the public library at St. James's and of the statues
and pictures there, be committed to the council of state, to be preserved
by them.</P>
<P>However, in the ensuing month, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">March 23, 1648.</NOTE> the house proceeded to vote, that
the personal estate <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Somerset-house had a narrow escape during that lust of destruction, of which an account is preserved in a very scarce tract, intituled, "An Essay on the won∣ders of God in the harmony of the times that preceded Christ, and how they met in him, written in French by John D'Espagne minister of the gospel [who died in 1650] and now published in English by his executor Henry Browne, London, 1662, octavo." In the preface the editor tells us, "that the author preached at the French church in Durham-house, where his sermons were followed by many of the nobility and gentry. That demolished, he says, it pleased God to touch the hearts of the nobility to procure us an order of the House of Peers to exercise our devotions at Somerset-house-chapel, which was the cause, not only of driving away the Anabaptists, Quakers and other sects, that had got in there, but also hindered the pulling down of Somerset-house, there having been twice an order from the late usurped powers for selling the said house; but we prevailed so, that we still got order to exempt the chapel from being sold, which broke the design of those that had bought the said house, who thought for their improvement to have made a street from the garden thro' the ground the chapel stands on, and so up the back yard to the great street of the Strand by pulling down the said chapel."</NOTE> of the late King, Queen and Prince should be inven∣toried,
appraised and sold, except such parcels of them as should be
thought fit to be reserved for the use of the state; and it was referred
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
to the council of state to consider and direct, what parcels of the goods
and personal estates aforesaid were fit to be reserved for the use of the
state. Certain commissioners were at the same time appointed to in∣ventory,
secure and appraise the said goods, and others, <HI>not members of
the house,</HI> were appointed to make sale of the said estates to the best va∣lue.
The receipts were to go towards satisfying the debts and servants
of the King, Queen and Prince, provided such servants had not been
delinquents; the rest to be applied to public uses; the first thirty thou∣sand
pounds to be appropriated to the navy. This vote in which they
seem to have acted honestly, not allowing their own members to be con∣cerned
in the sale, was the cause that the collection fell into a variety
of low hands, and were dispersed among the painters and officers of
the late King's houshold, where many of them remained on sale with
low prices affixed. The principal pieces were rated more highly, and
some of them were even sold above their valuation.</P>
<P>Ireton on the 2d of June 1648 reported the act for sale, and mention
is made of some proposition of Captain Myldmay concerning the pic∣tures
and statues, to be referred to the council of state. This proposal
it seems had been accepted but was revoked. Probably this person
might be an agent of Cromwell to prevent the dispersion. Cromwell
had greater matters to attend to; the sale proceeded. Two years after∣wards,
viz. in October and November 1650, the journals speak of sums
of money received from the sale of the King's goods, and of various
applications of the money towards discharge of his debts. From that
time I find no farther mention of the collection in the records.</P>
<P>With regard to the jewels, the parliament immediately after the
King's death ordered the crown and sceptres, &amp;c. to be locked up.
<PB N="72" REF="84"/>
The Queen had already sold several jewels abroad to raise money and
buy arms, Some had been sold in foreign countries early in the King's

The whole piece is curious, and mentions the danger there might be to the keepers of those jewels to let them go out of their hands, <HI>as they were of great value, and had long contynued as it were in a continual discent for many years togeather with the crowne of England.</HI> Foedera vol. xviii, p. 236.

it had belonged to Henry VIII. and appears on his pictures and on a
medal of him in Evelyn. His George, diamond and seales, which
Charles at his execution destined to his successor, the parliament voted
should not be so delivered. A pearl which he always wore in his ear,
as may be seen in his portrait on horseback by Vandyck, was taken out
after his death, and is in the collection of the Duchess of Portland, at∣tested
by the hand-writing of his daughter the Princess of Orange, and
was given to the Earl of Portland by King William. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tavernier book iv. chap. 17. mentions having a diamond on which were en∣graved the arms of Charles I. The Sophy of Persia and his court were extreme∣ly surprized at the art of engraving so hard a jewel; but, says Tavernier, I did not dare to own to whom it belonged, remembring what had formerly happened to the Chevalier de Reville on the subject of that King. The story, as he had re∣lated it before, in book ii. chap. 10. was, that Reville having told the Sophy that he had commanded a company of guards in the service of Charles, and being ask∣ed why he came into Persia, replied, that it was to dissipate the chagrin he felt on his master being put to death, and that since that time he cou'd not endure to live in Christendom. The Sophy fell into a rage, and asked Reville, how it was pos∣sible, if he was captain of the King's guards, that he and all his men shou'd not have shed the last drop of their blood in defence of their Prince? Reville was thrown into prison and remained there 22 days, and escaped at last by the inter∣cession of the Sophy's eunuchs.—Had all Charles's soldiers been as loyal as the Persian Monarch thought it their duty to be, we might now have the glory of being as faithfull slaves as the Asiatics.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="85"/>
A catalogue of the pictures, statues, goods, tapestries and jewels,
with the several prices at which they were valued and sold, was disco∣vered
some years ago in Moorfields, and fell into the hands of the late
Sir John Stanley, who permitted Mr. Vicechamberlain Cook, Mr. Fair∣fax
and Mr. Kent to take copies, from one of which Vertue obtained
a transcript. The particulars are too numerous to insert here. The
total of the contracts amounted to 118080<HI>l.</HI>—10<HI>s.</HI>—2<HI>d.</HI> Thirty one
pages at the beginning relating to the plate and jewels were wanting,
and other pages here and there were missing. Large quantities were
undoubtedly secreted and embezzled, and part remained unsold by the
accession of Cromwell, who lived both at Whitehall and Hampton-court.
All other furniture from all the King's palaces was brought
up and exposed to sale; there are specified particularly Denmark or So∣merset-house,
Greenwich, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the pictures from Greenwich is mentioned one piece of writing by Holbein, sold for ten pounds. I know not what this writing was.</NOTE> Whitehall, Nonsuch, Oatlands, Windsor,

Ludlow, Carisbrook and Kenelworth castles; Bewdley-house,
Holdenby-house, Royston, Newmarket, and Woodstock manor-house.
One may easily imagine that such a collection of pictures, with the re∣mains
of jewels and plate, and the furniture of nineteen palaces ought
to have amounted to a far greater sum than an hundred and eighteen
thousand pounds. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. Symonds says, the committee of Somerset-house prized the King's goods and moveables with the pictures at 200,000<HI>l.</HI> notwithstanding the Queen had car∣ried away and himself caused to be conveyed away abundance of jewels; and for this he cites Beauchamp, clerk to the committee.</NOTE></P>
<P>The sale continued to August 9, 1653. The prices were fixed, but
if more was offered, the highest bidder purchased; this happened in
some instances, not in many. Part of the goods were sold by inch of
candle. The buyers, called contractors, signed a writing for the seve∣ral
sums. If they disliked the bargain, they were at liberty to be dis∣charged
from the agreement on paying one fourth of the sum stipu∣lated.
Among the purchasers of statues and pictures were several
painters, as Decritz, Wright, Baptist Van Leemput, Sir Balthazar Ger∣bier,
&amp;c. The prices of the most remarkable lots were as follows:

Among the contractors appears Mr. John Leigh, who on August 1,

value of 109<HI>l.</HI>—5<HI>s.</HI>—0<HI>d.</HI> and on the 15th are sold to the Right hon,
the Lady Cromwell goods to the amount of two hundred pounds
more. But no sooner was Cromwell in possession of the sole power,
than he not only prevented any farther sale, but even detained from
the purchasers much of what they had contracted for. This appears
by a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Copied by Vertue from a paper in possession of Mr. Martin.</NOTE> petition, addressed, after the protector's death, to the council of
state, by major Edward Bass, Emanuel de Critz, William Latham,
and Henry Willet in behalf of themselves and divers others, in which
they represent,</P>
<P>"That in the year 1651, the petitioners did buy of the contractors
for the sale of the late King's goods, the several parcels there under∣named,
and did accordingly make satisfaction unto the Treasurer for
the same. But for as much as the said goods are in Whitehall, and
some part thereof in Mr. Kinnersley's custody in keeping, the petition∣ers
do humbly desire their honour's order, whereby they may receive
the said goods, they having been great sufferers by the late General
Cromwell's detaining thereof; and the petitioners, &amp;c."</P>
<P>The goods specified are hangings, and statues in the garden at
Whitehall. It is very remarkable that in this piece they style the Pro∣tector,
the late <HI>General</HI> Cromwell.</P>
<P>Whence Charles had his statues we learn from Peacham; "The
King also, says he, ever since his coming to the crown hath amply
testified a royal liking of ancient statues, by causing a whole army of
old foreign Emperors, Captains and Senators all at once to land on his
coasts, to come and do him homage, and attend him in palaces of
<PB N="77" REF="89"/>
St. James's and Somerset-house. A great part of these belonged to
the late Duke of Mantua; and some of the old Greek marble bases,
columns, and altars were brought from the ruins of Apollo's temple at
Delos, by that noble and absolutely compleat gentleman Sir Kenelm
Digby Knight." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compleat Gentleman, 107.</NOTE></P>
<P>Some of the most capital pictures were purchased by the King of
Spain, which arriving there while the Embassadors of Charles II. were
at that court, they were desired, by an odd kind of delicacy, to with∣draw,
they supposing that this dismission was owing to an account re∣ceived
at the same time of Cromwell's victory over the Marquis of
Argyle; "but, says Lord Clarendon, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In his life p. 119. fol. edit.</NOTE> they knew afterwards that the
true cause of this impatience to get rid of them, was that their minister
in England, having purchased many of the King's pictures and rich
furniture, had sent them to the Groyne; from whence they were ex∣pected
to arrive about that time at Madrid; which they thought could
not decently be brought to the palace while the ambassadors remain∣ed
at the court."</P>
<P>After the restoration endeavours were used to reassemble the spoils.
A commission was issued out to examine Hugh Peters concerning the
disposal of the pictures, jewels, &amp;c. that had belonged to the royal fa∣mily,
but without effect, by the obstinacy or ignorance of Peters, who
would not or could not give the desired satisfaction. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See General Dict. vol. ii. p. 384.</NOTE> Some of the pic∣tures
had been purchased by Gerard Reyntz, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">They are engraved in Reyntz's gallery.</NOTE> a Dutch collector, after
whose death they were bought of his widow by the states and presented
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
to Charles II. One only picture [the King on horseback by Vandyck]
was recovered by a process at law from Remèe or Remigius Van
Leemput, a painter then in England, who had bought it at the sale.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the havoc that had been made, it is plain from the
catalogue of the collection of James II. that the crown still possessed a
great number of valuable pictures, but the fire of Whitehall destroyed
almost all that the rage of civil war had spared. Some valuable pieces
indeed were carried to Lisbon from Somerset-house by the Queen
Dowager, when she returned to Portugal. The then Lord Chamber∣lain,
it is said, put a stop to their embarkation, 'till mollified by the
present of one of them that he admired.</P>
<P>The royal library escaped better: This was founded by James I. It
contained the collection belonging to the crown, among which were se∣veral
fine editions on vellom, sent as presents from abroad, on the re∣storation
of learning, to Henry VII. Henry VIII. and Queen Eliza∣beth;
the library of the Lord Lumley, purchased by James for Prince
Henry, the collection of Casaubon bought of his widow, and some cu∣rious
MSS. brought from Constantinople by Sir Thomas Roe. These
books have been given to the British Museum by his late majesty. To
this library Prince Henry had added a large number of coins, medals,
cameos and intaglias, the Dactyliotheca of Gorlaeus. Mr. Young, li∣brarian
to Charles I. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this library, says Perinchief, was kept a collection of his, of the excellent sayings of authors, written by his own hand, and in his youth, presented to his father King James. Life of Charles p. 219.</NOTE> was removed by the council of state in 1649, at
which time an account of the books and coins was taken; of the latter
there were 1200, of which 400 only remained at the restoration.
Among the Duke of Ormond's letters is one dated April 2, 1649,
<PB N="79" REF="91"/>
where he says, "All the rarities in the King's library at St. James's
are vanished." Yet it is evident many remained, for in June 1659 a
Vote passed "that the Lord Whitlocke be desired and authorized to
take upon him the care and custody of the library at James-house, and
of all the books, manuscripts and medals, that are in or belonging to
the said library, that the same be safely kept and preserved, and to
recover all such as have been embezzled or taken out of the same."
Charles II. after his return ordered Ashmole <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires of El. Ashmole prefixed to his Berkshire; p. 10. 24.</NOTE> to draw up an account
of the medals that were left, and placed them in the closet of Henry
VIII. at Whitehall, where they were lost at the fire.</P>
<P>What farther relates to Charles I. as protector of the arts, will be
found in the subsequent pages, under the articles of the different pro∣fessors
whom he countenanced. If this chapter has not been thought
tedious and too circumstantial, the readers who excuse it, will not per∣haps
be sorry if I add a little more to it on that other patron of genius,
the Earl of Arundel.</P>
<P> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a short view of his life in Sir Edward Walker's historical discours∣es, and some curious particulars in Lilly's observations on the life and death of King Charles. As the book is not in every body's hands, one anecdote may be worth transcribing. The King taking the part of a priest, who pretended that his majesty had a right to a rectory which the Earl challenged as his, Arundel said to Charles, "Sir, this rectory was an appendent to a manour of mine, un∣till my grandfather unfortunately lost both his life and seventeen lordships more, for the love he bore to your grandmother." P. 51.</NOTE> Thomas Howard Earl of Arundel is sufficiently known in his pub∣lic
character by that admirable portrait drawn of him by Lord Claren∣don.
Living much within himself, but in all the state of the ancient
<PB N="80" REF="92"/>
nobility, his chief amusement was his collection, the very ruins of
which are ornaments now to several principal cabinets. He was the
first who professedly began to collect in this country, and led the way
to Prince Henry, King Charles, and the Duke of Buckingham. "I
cannot, says Peacham, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compleat Gentleman p. 107.</NOTE> but with much reverence mention the every
way Right Honorable Thomas Howard Lord High Marshal of Eng∣land,
as great for his noble patronage of arts and ancient learning, as
for his high birth and place; to whose <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In one of R. Symondes's pocket-books in the museum is a character not quite so favourable of the Earl. "Mai, says he, rimunerò persona. Era molto generoso e libero a forastieri per guadagnare fama, ed in quella cosa spendea libe∣ramente." There are also the following hints. "Old Earle fece rubare pezzo di quel quadro di Veronese a Padova, but it was spoiled, says Mr. Jer. Lanier. Last Earl Thomas, molto lodato di Jer. Lanier per uom honestissimo et civile ed inten∣dentissimo: per patto furono d'accordo d'andare in Italia quest' anno 1654 per comprare disegni e quadri."

statues, with whose admired presence he began to honour the gar∣dens
and galleries of Arundel-house about twenty <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This was printed in 1634.</NOTE> years ago, and hath
ever since continued to transplant old Greece into England." The
person chiefly employed by the Earl in these researches was Mr. Petty.
It appears from Sir Thomas Roe's letters, who had a commission of the
like nature from the Duke of Buckingham, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">"Neither am I, says the Duke, so fond of antiquity, as you rightly conjec∣ture, to court it in a deformed or mishapen stone." Page 534.</NOTE> that no man was ever
better qualified for such an employment than Mr. Petty; "He en∣counters,

eats with Greeks on their work-days, lies with fishermen on planks, is
all things that may obtain his ends." Mr. Petty returning with his
collection from Samos, narrowly escaped with his life in a great storm,
but lost all his curiosities, and was imprisoned for a spy, but obtaining
his liberty pursued his searches.</P>
<P>Many curious pieces of painting and antiquities, especially medals,
the Earl bought of Henry Vanderborcht a painter of Brussels, who
lived at Frankendal, and whose son Henry, Lord Arundel finding at
Frankfort, sent to Mr. Petty then collecting for him in Italy, and af∣terwards
kept in his service as long as he lived. Vanderborcht the
younger was both painter and graver; he drew many of the Arunde∣lian
curiosities, and etched several things both in that and the royal
collection. A book of his drawings from the former, containing 567
pieces, is preserved at Paris, and is described in the catalogue of L'oran∣gerie
p. 199. After the death of the Earl, the younger Henry entered
into the service of the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II. and li∣ved
in esteem in London for a considerable time, but returned to Ant∣werp
and died there. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See English School p. 467. There is a print by Hollar of Elias Allen, from a painting of Vanderborcht.</NOTE> There are prints by Hollar of both father and
son; the former done from a painting of the latter.</P>
<P>The Earl was not a meer selfish virtuoso; he was bountifull to men
of talents, retaining some in his service, and liberal to all. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The famous Oughtred was taken into Arundel-house to instruct the Earl's son, Lord William Howard, in mathematics—but it seems was disappointed of preferment. See Biogr. Brit. vol. v. p. 3280. 3283. 3284.</NOTE> He was
<PB N="82" REF="94"/>
one of the first who discovered the genius of Inigo Jones, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some carved seats by Inigo were purchased from Tarthall and placed in a temple at Chiswick by Lord Burlington.</NOTE> and was
himself, says Lilly, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observations on the life of K. Charles, p. 51.</NOTE> the first who "brought over the new way of
building with brick in the city, greatly to the safety of the city, and
preservation of the wood of this nation." Norgate whom I have men∣tioned
partook of his favours. On his <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">An account of this embassy was drawn up and published by Crowne, who attended the Earl.</NOTE> embassy to Vienna he found
Hollar at Prague and brought him over, where the latter engraved a
great number of plates from pictures, drawings and curiosities in the
Arundelian collection. There is a set of small prints by Hollar, views
of Albury, the Earl's seat in Surrey. "Lord Arundel thought, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sculptura p. 103.</NOTE> says
Evelyn, that one who could not design a little, would never make an
honest man." A foolish observation enough, and which, if he had
not left better proofs, would give one as little opinion of the judgment
of the speaker, as it does of that of the relator. The Earl seems to
have had in his service another painter, one Harrison, now only known
to us by a chronologic diary, in which he records particulars relating
to old Parr, whom Lord Arundel had a curiosity to see. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Peck's collection of divers curious historic 1 pieces, subjoined to his lives of Cromwell and Milton. The Earl sent Parr, who was then blind, to King Charles. The King said to him, "You have lived longer other men; what have you done more than other men?" He replied, "I did penance when I was an hundred years old."</NOTE></P>
<P>At the beginning of the troubles the Earl transported himself and
<PB N="83" REF="95"/>
his collection to Antwerp, and dying not long after at Padua, he di∣vided
his personal estate between his sons Henry Lord Maltravers, and
Sir William Howard Viscount Stafford. Of what came to the eldest
branch, since Dukes of Norfolk, the most valuable part fell into the
hands of the Duchess who was divorced; the statues she sold <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutchess it is said wanted money and sold them for 300<HI>l.</HI></NOTE> to the
last Earl of Pomfret's father, which have been lately given by the
Countess Dowager to the university of Oxford, which had before been
enriched with those curious records called the Arundelian marbles:
The cameos and intaglias the Duchess of Norfolk bequeathed to her
second husband Sir John Germayne: They <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Part of this collection were the antique gems published by Apollina at Rome, 1627, and afterwards by Licetus of Genoa.</NOTE> are now in the possession
of his widow Lady Elizabeth Germayne. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Since the first edition of this book, Lady E. Germayne has given them to Lord Charles Spencer, on his marriage with her great neice Miss Beauclere, and he to his brother the Duke of Marlborough.</NOTE> Among them is that inimi∣table
cameo, the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, which I should not
scruple to pronounce the finest remain of antique sculpture in that
kind. The coins and medals came into the possession of Thomas
Earl of Winchelsea, and in 1696 were sold by his executors to Mr.
Thomas Hall. Arundel-house was pulled down in 1678. The re∣mainder
of the collection was preserved at Tarthall, without the gate
of St. James's park near Buckingham-house. Those curiosities too
were sold by auction in 1720, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. West has the printed catalogue (which was miserably drawn up) with the prices. That sale produced 6535<HI>l.</HI></NOTE> and the house itself has been lately demo∣lished.
<PB N="84" REF="96"/>
At that sale Dr. Meade bought the head of Homer, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is engraved in a print from Vandyck of the Earl and Countess, in which the Earl, who has a globe near him, is pointing to Madagascar, where he had thoughts of making a settlement.</NOTE> after
whose death it was purchased by the present Earl of Exeter, and by
him presented to the British Museum. It is believed to have been
brought from Constantinople, and to have been the head of the very
statue in the imperial palace described by Cedrenus. The rest of the
figure was melted in the fire. The Earl of Arundel had tried to pro∣cure
the obelisk, since erected in the Piazza Navona at Rome; and he
offered the value of 7000<HI>l.</HI> in money or land to the Duke of Bucking∣ham
for a capital picture of Titian called the Ecce homo, in which
were introduced the portraits of the Pope, Charles V. and Solyman the
magnificent.</P>
<P>The Earl has been painted by Rubens and Vandyck. The present
Duke of Argyle has a fine head of him by the former. By the latter
he was drawn in armour with his grandson Cardinal Howard. The
Earl had designed too to have a large picture, like that at Wilton, of
himself and family: Vandyck actually made the design, but by the in∣tervention
of the troubles it was executed only in small by Ph. Frutiers
at Antwerp, from whence Vertue engraved a plate. The Earl and
Countess are sitting under a state; before them are their children, one

noblemen are represented as hanging up near the canopy.</P>
<P>I will conclude this article and chapter with mentioning that Fran∣ciscus
Junius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his article in the General Dictionary.</NOTE> was taken by the Earl of Arundel for his librarian, and
lived in his family thirty years. The Earl had purchased part of
the library of the Kings of Hungary from Pirkeymerus; Henry

<P>Sir PETER PAUL RUBENS.</P>
<P>ONE cannot write the life of Rubens without transcribing twenty
authors. The most common books expatiate on a painter,
whose works are so numerous and so well known. His pic∣tures
were equally adapted to please the ignorant and the conoisseurs.
Familiar subjects, familiar histories, treated with great lustre and full∣ness
of colouring, a richness of nature and propriety of draperies, re∣commend
themselves at first sight to the eyes of the vulgar. The just
boldness of his drawing, the wonderfull chiaro scuro diffused through∣out
his pictures, and not loaded like Rembrandt's to force out one pe∣culiar
spot of light, the variety of his carnations, the fidelity to the cus∣toms
and manners of the times he was representing, and attention to
every part of his compositions, without enforcing trifles too much or
too much neglecting them, all this union of happy excellencies endear
the works of Rubens to the best judges: he is perhaps the single artist
who attracts the suffrages of every rank. One may justly call him the

<PB N="87" REF="100"/>
<HI>popular painter</HI>; he wanted that majesty and grace which confine the
works of the greatest masters to the fewest admirers. I shall be but
brief on the circumstances of his life; he staid but little here, in which
light only he belongs to this treatise.</P>
<P> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This extract is chiefly made from Felibien. vol. iii. p. 404. from Descamps, p. 297. and Sandrart.</NOTE> His father was doctor of laws and senator of Antwerp, which he
quitted on the troubles of that country and retired with his family to
Cologn, where on the feast of St. Peter and Paul his wife was delivered
of Rubens in 1577. Great care was taken of his education; he learned
and spoke Latin in perfection. When Antwerp was reduced by the
arms of Philip, Rubens the father returned to his native country.
The son was grown up, and was well made. The Countess of Lalain
took him for her page, but he had too elevated a disposition to throw
away his talents on so dissipated a way of life. He quitted that service,
and his father being dead, his mother consented to let him pursue his
passion for painting. Toby Verhaest, a landscape-painter, and Adam
Van Oort were his first masters, and then Otho Venius, under whom
he imbibed (one of his least merits) a taste for allegory. The perplexed
and silly emblems of Venius are well known. Rubens with nobler sim∣plicity
is perhaps less just in his. One may call some of his pictures
<HI>a toleration of all religions.</HI> In one of the compartments of the Luxem∣burgh
gallery, a cardinal introduces Mercury to Mary de' Medici, and
Hymen supports her train at the sacrament of marriage, before an al∣tar
on which are the images of God the Father and Christ. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See more on this subject at the end of Mr. Spence's Polymetis.</NOTE> At the
age of twenty-three Rubens set out for Italy, and entered into the ser∣vice
of Vincent Gonzaga Duke of Mantua. One day while he was at
<PB N="88" REF="101"/>
that court, and was painting the story of Turnus and Aeneas, intend∣ing
to warm his imagination by the rapture of poetry, he repeated
with energy those lines of Virgil. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No wonder his emulation was raised at Mantua, where the works of Homer were treated by Raphael and Julio Romano.</NOTE>
<Q>Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet, &amp;c.</Q>
The Duke who over heard him and entered the chamber, was surpriz∣ed
to find the mind of his painter cultivated with a variety of gracefull
litterature. Rubens was named Envoy to Spain, and carried magnifi∣cent
presents to the favorite Duke of Lerma; exerting at that court his
political and elegant talents with a dignity and propriety that raised
the latter without debasing the former. He conversed little with the
painters of that country except Velasquez, with whom he continued a
correspondence of letters.</P>
<P>The fame of the young painter reached Don John of Braganza, af∣terwards
King of Portugal, who invited him to Villa Viciosa. Rubens
set out with such a train, that the Duke apprehended the expence of
entertaining so pompous a visitor, and wrote to stop his journey, ac∣companying
the excuse with a present of fifty pistoles. The painter
refused the present, said he had not proposed to paint, but to pass a
week at Villa Viciosa, and had brought a thousand pistoles that he in∣tended
to spend there.</P>
<P>Returned to Mantua, the Duke sent him to Rome to copy the
works of the great masters. There he studied them, not what they
had studied, the ancients; Rubens was too careless of the antique as
Poussin copied it too servilely. The former seemed never to have seen
a statue, the latter nothing else. The reputation of Titian and Paul
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
Veronese drew Rubens to Venice; there he was in his element, in the
empire of colours. There he learned to imitate nature; at Rome he
had missed the art of improving on it. If he has not the simplicity of
Titian, he has far more than Paul Veronese. The buildings with
which he has enriched the back grounds of his compositions, do not
yield to those of the latter; his landscapes are at least equal to those of
the former. Seldom as he practiced it, Rubens was never greater
than in landscape; the tumble of his rocks and trees, the deep shadows
in his glades and glooms, the watery sunshine, and dewy verdure, show
a variety of genius, which are not to be found in the inimitable but
uniform glow of Claud Lorrain.</P>
<P>Rubens was much worse employed at Genoa, where he drew most
of their palaces, and caused them to be engraved in two volumes.
How could a genius like his overlook the ruins of Rome, the designs
of Raphael and Michael Angelo, and the restorers of ancient architec∣ture
at Venice, and waste his time on the very moderate beauties that
he found at Genoa, where their greatest art lay in crowding magnifi∣cence
into a narrow and almost useless situation? where most of their
palaces can only be seen from a sedan chair!</P>
<P>His mother's illness drew him back to Antwerp, where the Arch∣duke
Albert detained him, and where he married his first wife Eliza∣beth
Brants. He built a palace and painted it within and without.
His cabinet or rotunda was enriched with antique vases, statues, me∣dals
and pictures. The Duke of Buckingham saw and coveted it. Le
Blond, whom I have mentioned in the life of Holbein, negotiated the
bargain, to which Rubens consented with regret. The favorite, who
was bent on the purchase, gave, it is said, ten thousand pounds for what
had not cost above a thousand.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="103"/>
In Flanders he executed many great works, which created him as
many enemies. They affected to ascribe to the scholars whom he had
formed or been forced to take to assist him, as Jordaens, Van Uden,
Snyder, and Wildens, the merits of the master—but the greater the
talents of the assistants, the higher the genius of the master. Do able
painters work under an indifferent one? Abraham Janssens challenged
Rubens to a trial of their art; Rubens replied he would engage with
him, when Janssens had proved himself worthy to be his competitor.
A more friendly offer was rejected by him with equal wit. A chymist
tendered him a share of his laboratory and of his hopes of the philoso∣pher's
stone. Rubens carried the visionary into his painting room, and
told him his offer was dated twenty years too late, "for so long it is,
said he, since I found the art of making gold with my pallet and pen∣cils."</P>
<P>From Antwerp he was called to Paris by Mary de' Medici, and
painted the ostensible history of her life in the Luxemburgh. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said that she designed he should fill another gallery with the story of Henry IV. her husband, and that he had begun several of the compartments, but the troubles of that Princess prevented the execution. Abregè de la vie des pein∣tres. Vol. ii, p. 141.</NOTE> A pecu∣liar
honour, as that Princess was an Italian. It is even said that he gave
her some lessons in drawing. If the prodigious number of large pieces
painted by Rubens were not testimonies of the abundance and facility
of his genius, this gallery alone, compleated in three years, would de∣monstrate
it. As soon as it was finished, he returned to Antwerp,
where his various talents were so conspicuous, that he was pitched upon
to negotiate a treaty of peace between Spain and England. The In∣fanta
Isabella sent him to Madrid for instructions, where he ingratiated
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
himself so much with the Conde-Due D'olivarez, that besides many
valuable presents, he had a brevet for himself and his son of secretary
of the Privy-council, and was dismissed with a secret commission to
King Charles, as I have mentioned before, in which he had the honour
of succeeding.</P>
<P>Neither Charles nor Rubens overlooked in the Embassador the ta∣lents
of the Painter. The King engaged him to paint the cieling of
the Banquetting-house. The design is the apotheosis of King James,
for whom, when once deified, there seems to have been no farther
thought of erecting a monument. The original sketch for the middle
compartment is preserved at Houghton: It had belonged to Sir God∣frey
Kneller, who often studied it, as is evident by Sir Godfrey's ori∣ginal
sketch, at Houghton too, for the great equestrian picture of King
William at Hampton-court, though in the larger piece he seems to
have forgot that he ever had studied the former design. Sir Godfrey
had heard that Jordaens assisted Rubens in the execution; if true,
some of the compartments must have been painted in Holland and
sent over hither, for I do not find that Jordaens was ever in England.
Rubens received three thousand pounds for his work. The building
itself cost seventeen thousand pounds. What had it been, if compleat∣ed!
Vandyck was to have painted the sides with the history of the or∣der
of the garter. Inigo Jones, Rubens, and Vandyck! Europe could
not have shown a nobler chamber. Kent in the late reign repaired
the painting on the cieling.</P>
<P>During his residence here Rubens painted for the King a St.
George, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter in the Museum dated March 6, 1630, it is said, "My Lord Car∣lisle hath twice in one week most magnificently feasted the Spanish Embassador and Mons.

This, I suppose, was a repetition of the picture he drew for the King: One of them is now in the collection of the Earl of Lincoln.</NOTE> four feet high and seven feet wide.

<P>Theodore Rogiers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a head of Rogiers among the artists drawn by Vandyck.</NOTE> modelled for the King a silver ewer designed

Duchess of Marlborough gave any price for his pictures. They <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are sixteen pieces by this master; the best are, his own portrait with his wife and child, the offering of the Magi, and the Roman charity.</NOTE> are
the first ornaments of Blenheim but have suffered by neglect. At Wil∣ton
are two; one, the Assumption of the Virgin, painted for the Earl
of Arundel while Rubens was in England, and with which he was so
pleased himself, that he afterwards made a large picture from it for a
convent at Antwerp. The other contains four children, Christ, an
Angel, St. John, and a girl representing the church. This picture
which is far superior to the foregoing, and very fine, is said in the ca∣talogue
to be allowed to be the best picture in England of Rubens; an
hyperbole indeed. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Kennedy's account of Wilton, p. 76. 79.</NOTE> At the Earl of Pomfret's at Easton was a portrait
of Lodowic Duke of Richmond and Lenox. At Houghton is that
masterly piece, Mary Magdalen anointing the feet of Christ; and a
large cartoon of Meleager and Atalanta. There too are three pieces
in three different styles, in each of which he excelled, a landscape; and
satyrs; and lions. Animals, especially of the savage kind, he painted
beyond any master that ever lived. In his satyrs, though highly co∣loured
and with characteristic countenances, he wanted poetic imagina∣tion.
They do not seem a seperate species, but a compound of the
human and animal, in which each part is kept too distinct. His fe∣male
satyrs are scarce more indelicate than his women; one would
think that, like Swift, he did not intend that Yahoos should be too dis∣criminate
from human nature; though what the satyrist drew from
spleen, flowed in the painter from an honest love of flesh and blood.
There are besides in Lord Orford's collection the sketches for the Car∣dinal
Infant's entry into Antwerp, the family of Rubens by his scholar
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
Jordaens, and his second wife Helena Forman, a celebrated whole
length by Vandyck.</P>
<P>The fine picture of St. Martin the late Prince of Wales bought of
Mr. Bagnol, who brought it from Spain. It is remarkable that in
this piece Rubens has borrowed the head of an old man from the
cripple in one of the cartoons, of which I have said he gave informa∣tion
to King Charles, who purchased them. At Lord Spencer's at
Wimbleton is a fine portrait of Cardinal Howard. At Burleigh is an
Ebony Cabinet the front and Sides of which are painted by Rubens;
at one End are his three Wives, highly coloured.</P>
<P>I do not find how long Rubens stayed in England, probably not
above a year. He died of the gout in his own country in 1640. A
catalogue of his works may be seen in Descamps. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See also a list of the works of Rubens in Le Comte's cabinet des singularitez d' architecture, peinture, &amp;c. vol. i, p. 251.

<P>Mr. Maurice Johnson of Spalding in Lincolnshire, a great antiqua∣rian,
produced to the Society of Antiquaries some years ago a MS.
containing discourses and observations on human bodies, and on the
statues and paintings of the ancients and moderns, written partly in
Latin, partly in Italian, and some notes in Dutch, and illustrated with
several drawings, as heads, attitudes, proportions, &amp;c. habits of Greeks
and Romans, various instruments, utensils, armour, and head-dresses
from coins and statues, and comparisons of Raphael, Michael Angelo
and others. It was an octavo pocket-book, and appeared to be an
exact copy of Rubens's Album, which he used in his travels; the
drawings, and even hand-writing and different inks being exactly imi∣tated
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
This book was brought from Brussels by Capt. Johnson, Mr.
Johnson's son, and had one leaf of the original in it, with a sketch of
the head of the Farnesian Hercules. The original itself is at Paris,
where they intended to publish it. An account of it is given in the
catalogue raisonnè de monsieur Quintin de L'orangerie, par Frederic
Gersaint, 1744.</P>
<P>ABRAHAM DIEPENBECK,</P>
<P>among the various scholars of Rubens, was one of the few that came
to England, where he was much employed by William Cavendish
Duke of Newcastle, whose managed horses he drew from the life, from
whence were engraved the cuts that adorn that Peer's book of horse∣manship.
Several of the original pictures still remain in the hall at
Welbeck. Diepenbeck drew views of the Duke's seats in Nottingham∣shire
and Derbyshire, and portraits of the Duke, Duchess, and his chil∣dren,
and gave designs for several plates prefixed to the works of both
their Graces. "Diepenbeck, says De Piles, was born at Boisleduc,
and in his youth was much employed in painting upon glass, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandrart says he excelled all the other painters on glass.</NOTE> and en∣tering
afterwards into the school of Rubens, became one of his best
disciples." Several prints were made from his works, particularly
those he designed for a book, called, The Temple of the Muses, en∣graved
by Bloemart and Mattham in 1663, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sandrart. See a farther account of Diepenbeck in the Abregè de la vie des plus fameux peintres. vol. ii p. 198.

<P><PB N="96" REF="109"/>Sir ANTONY VANDYCK,</P>
<P>whose works are so frequent in England that the generality of our peo∣ple
can scarce avoid thinking him their countryman, was born at Ant∣werp
in 1598, the only son of a merchant, and of a mother, who was
admired for painting flowers in small, and for her needleworks in silk.
Vandyck was first placed with Van Balen, who had studied at Rome,
and painted figures both in large and small; but the fame of Rubens
drew away to a nobler school the young congenial artist. The pro∣gress
of the disciple speedily raised him to the glory of assisting in the
works from which he learned. Fame that always supposes jealousy is
felt where there are grounds for it, attributes to Rubens an envy of
which his liberal nature I believe was incapable, and makes him advise
Vandyck to apply himself chiefly to portraits. I shall show that jea∣lousy,
at least emulation, is rather to be ascribed to the scholar than to
the master. If Rubens gave the advice in question, he gave it with rea∣son;
not maliciously. Vandyck had a peculiar genius for portraits;
his draperies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His sattins of which he was fond, particularly white and blue, are remarkably finished; his back-grounds heavy, and have great sameness.</NOTE> are finished with a minuteness of truth not demanded in
historic compositions; besides his invention was cold and tame, nor
does he any where seem to have had much idea of the passions, and
their expression: Portraits require none. If Rubens had been jealous
of Vandyck, would he, as all their biographers agree he did, persuade
him to visit Italy, whence himself had drawn his greatest lights? Ad∣dison
did not advise Pope to translate Homer, but assisted Tickell in a
rival translation. Vandyck after making presents to Rubens of two or

three histories, and the famous portrait of the latter's wife, set out for
Italy, and made his first residence at Genoa. From thence he went to
Venice, which one may call the metropolis of the Flemish painters,
who seem so naturally addicted to colouring, that even in Italy they
see only with Flemish eyes. Vandyck imbibed so deeply the tints of
Titian, that he is allowed to approach nearer to the carnations of that
master even than Rubens; Sir Anthony had more delicacy than the
latter, but like him never reached the grace and dignity of the antique.
He seldom even arrived at beauty. His Madonnas are homely; his
ladies so little flattered, that one is surprized he had so much custom.
He has left us to wonder that the famous Countess of Carlisle could be
thought so charming; and had not Waller been a better painter, Sa∣charissa
would make little impression now. One excellence he had,
which no portrait-painter ever attained except Sir Godfrey Kneller;
the hands are often the finest part of his pictures.</P>
<P>He went to Rome and lived splendidly, avoiding the low conversa∣tion
of his countrymen, and distinguished by the appellation of the
<HI>Pittore Cavalieresco.</HI> It was at Rome he drew that capital portrait of
Cardinal Bentivoglio, who having been Nuncio in Flanders, had a par∣tiality
for their artists, and as he celebrated their history with his pen,
was in return almost immortalized by one of their best pencils.</P>
<P>Vandyck, while at Rome, received an invitation to Palermo, and
went thither. There he painted Prince Philibert of Savoy, the Vice-Roy,
and a paintress of some name, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the Lord Spenser's at Wimbledon is a good portrait of Sophonisba An∣guisciola playing on a harpsichord, painted by herself, and an old woman attend∣ing her; on the picture is written, Jussu Patris. Lord Ashburnham has a small head of her in a round.</NOTE> Sophonisba Anguisciola, then at
the age of ninety-one. But the plague soon drove him from Sicily;
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
he returned to Genoa, where he had gained the highest reputation,
and where he has left many considerable works.</P>
<P>He went back to Antwerp, and practiced both history and portrait.
Of the former kind were many applauded Altar-pieces; in the latter,
were particularly the heads of his cotemporary artists. He drew them
in Chiaro scuro on small pannels, thirty-five of which are in the collec∣tion
of the Countess of Cardigan at Whitehall. Admirable is the va∣riety
of attitudes and airs of heads; but in those pieces he meaned to
surpass as well as record. The whole collection has been thrice
published; the first edition by Vanden Enden contains fourscore plates;
the second by Giles Hendrix, one hundred; the last by Verdussen,
who effaced the names and letters of the original engravers. Some of
the plates were etched by Vandyck himself. I say nothing of the
numbers of prints from his other works.</P>
<P>Hearing of the favour King Charles showed to the arts, Vandyck
came to England, and lodged with his friend Geldorp, a painter,
hoping to be introduced to the King; it is extraordinary he was not.
He went away chagrined; but his majesty soon learning what a trea∣sure
had been within his reach, ordered Sir Kenelm Digby, who had
sat to Vandyck, to invite him over. He came, and was lodged among
the King's artists at Black-fryars, which Felibien, according to the
dignity of ignorance which the French affect, calls <HI>L'Hotel de Blaifore.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii, page 445.</NOTE>
Thither the King went often by water, and viewed his performances
with singular delight, frequently sitting to him himself, and bespeaking
pictures of the Queen, his children and his courtiers, and conferring the
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
honour of knighthood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French author of the lives of the painters says he was created Knight of the Bath; a mistake. Abregè vol. ii. p. 170. Another mistake is his supposing that Vandyck was only to give designs for tapestries in the Banquetting-house, p. 171.</NOTE> on him at St. James's July 5, 1632. This
was soon attended by the grant of an annuity of 200<HI>l.</HI> a year for life.
The patent is preserved in the rolls, and dated 1633, in which he is
styled painter to his majesty. I have already mentioned the jealousy
of Mytens on this occasion.</P>
<P>Of the various portraits by Vandyck of King Charles, the principal
are, a whole length in the coronation robes at Hampton-court; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the same palace are whole lengths of James I. his Queen, the Queen of Bohemia, and Prince Henry, copied by Vandyck from painters of the preceding reign. Prince Henry's is in armour, in which Vandyck excelled, has an amiable countenance, and is a fine picture.</NOTE> the
head has been engraved by Vertue among the Kings of England. Ano∣ther
in armour on a dun horse at Blenheim. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This was in the royal collection, was sold in the civil war, and was bought by the Duke of Marlborough from Munich.</NOTE> A whole length in armour
at Houghton. Another, a large piece at the Duke of Grafton's, in which
the King (a most gracefull figure) in white sattin, with his hat on, is just
descended from his horse; at a distance, a view of the Isle of Wight.
The <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This is the picture that was recovered from Remèe.</NOTE> King in armour on a white horse, Mons. de St. Antoine, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">He had been a chief equerry to Prince Henry, and led a mourning horse at his funeral. See Birch's life of that Prince, append. 527.</NOTE> his
equerry, holding his helmet. The head of the latter is fine; the King's
is probably not an original. This and the following are at each end of
the gallery at Kensington. The King and Queen sitting, Prince Charles,

very young standing at his knee; the Duke of York, an infant, on hers. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This picture has been heightened to make it match it's opposite.</NOTE>
At Turin is another whole length of the King, in a large piece of ar∣chitecture.
At Somerset-house, the King and Queen, half lengths,
holding a crown of laurel between them. At Windsor is a beautifull
half length of the Queen in white. Many portraits of her pretend to
be by Vandyck, but none are so lovely as this. He two or three times
drew Prince Charles in armour standing. At Kensington in one piece
are Prince Charles, Prince James, and the Princess Mary; lately en∣graved
by Strange. In the same palace is one of his finest works;
George Villiers, the second Duke of Buckingham, and Lord Francis
his brother, when children. Nothing can exceed the nature, lustre,
and delicacy of this sweet picture. At Houghton are two young
daughters of the Lord Wharton, admirable too, but rather inferior to
the foregoing. In Lord Orford's collection are several principal works <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a particular description of these pictures in the Aedes Walpolianae.</NOTE>
of this master. The holy family with a dance of Angels; it belonged
to King Charles, is a capital picture, but has it's faults. Inigo Jones,
a head; Rubens's wife in black sattin; Henry Danvers Earl of Danby
whole length, in the robes of the garter; and a half length of Sir
Thomas Chaloner, governor of Prince Henry. Besides these my fa∣ther
bought of the last Duke the whole collection of the Wharton fa∣mily:
There were twelve whole lengths, the two girls, six half lengths,
and two more by Sir Peter Lely; he paid an hundred pounds each for
the whole lengths and the double picture, and fifty pounds each for
the half lengths. Most of them were carried to Houghton, but some
not suiting the places, were brought back, and sold for a trifle after
the death of my father. Those that remain, are, King Charles, the
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
Queen, very indifferent, Sir Thomas Wharton: Of the half lengths,
Laud, a celebrated but not very fine picture; Sir Christopher Wandes∣ford,
Lady Wharton, Mrs. Wharton, Mrs. Wenman and the Lely's. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rest were, Lord Wharton, bought by Lord Royston; Lady Wharton in white, Lady Chesterfield, ditto; Countess of Worcester in blue; Lady Rich in black, very handsome, on whose death Waller wrote a poem; Mrs. Smith in blue, a homely woman, but a fine picture, now mine; Lady Carlisle, bought by Mr. West; Arthur Goodwin, father of Mrs. Smith, one of the best, given by my father to the late Duke of Devonshire; and two portraits of Prince Rupert, whole and half lengths; both very poor performances. Some of the whole lengths were engraved by Van Gunst.</NOTE></P>
<P>At Cornbury, the seat of the Earls of Clarendon in Oxfordshire, was
a noble collection of portraits of the principal persons in the reign of
King Charles, many of which were drawn by Vandyck. The collec∣tion
has since been divided between the Duchess of Queensberry, Lady
Hyde and Lady Mary Forbes, the heiresses of the family. Several
others of his works are at the Earl of Denbigh's and at Lord Spenser's
at Althrop. Among the latter, a celebrated double whole length of
the first Duke of Bedford and the famous Lord Digby, afterwards
Earl of Bristol. The whole figure of the latter is good, and both the
heads fine; the body of Bedford is flat, nor is this one of his capital
works. Here too is a good picture of Daedalus and Icarus; half
lengths; a fine surly impatience in the young man, and his body well
coloured. The Duke of Devonshire has some good pictures by him;
at Chiswick is the well known <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Burlington gave 1000<HI>l.</HI> for this picture at Paris, and had another of Luca Jordano into the bargain.</NOTE> Belisarius, though very doubtfull if by
the hand of Vandyck. The expressive figure of the young soldier re∣deems this picture from the condemnation it would deserve by the prin∣cipal
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
figure being so mean and inconsiderable. The Duke has Van∣dyck's
travelling pocket-book in which are several sketches, particu∣larly
from Titian, and of Sophonisba Anguisciola, mentioned above.</P>
<P>At Holkham is a large equestrian picture of a Count D'Aremberg;
both the rider and horse are in his best manner; and at Earl Cowper's
a large piece of John Count of Nassau and his family, lately engraved
by Baron.</P>
<P>Mr. Skinner, with the collection of the late Mr. Thomas Walker,
has a fine little picture of the Lady Venetia Digby, wife of Sir Kenelm;
though only a model for the large one at Windsor; it is exquisitely fi∣nished.
She is represented as treading on Envy and Malice, and is
unhurt by a serpent that twines round her arm. This galant compli∣ment
is a little explained in the new life of Lord Clarendon, who men∣tions
Sir Kenelm's marriage with a Lady, "though of an extraordinary
beauty, of as extraordinary fame." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is an elegy and epitaph on this Lady in Randolph's poems, page 28, in which her beauty is exceedingly commended. She was daughter and co-heiress of Sir Edward Stanley, grandson of Edward Earl of Derby, by the Lady Lucy Percy, daughter of Thomas Earl of Northumberland. Lady Venetia was found dead in her bed. Sir Kenelm erected for her a monument of black marble with her bust in copper gilt, and a lofty epitaph, in Christ-church without Newgate; but it was destroyed in the fire of London. Lodge's peerage of Ireland. vol. iv, p. 89. There are two copper busts of the Lady Venetia extant at Mr. Wright's at Gothurst in Buckinghamshire, with several portraits of the family of Digby. The house belonged to Sir Kenelm, and was purchased by Sir Nathan Wright.</NOTE> Mr. Walker's collection was
chiefly chosen for him by a set of virtuosi called Vandyck's or the club
of St. Luke, and it is plain from the pictures they recommended, that
they understood what they professed. There was another large piece
of Sir Kenelm, his lady and two children, in the collection of the Earl
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
of Oxford; and a fine half length of Sir Kenelm alone is at Kensington.
Vandyck painted too for the King a twelfth Roman Emperor, to com∣pleat
the set of Titian, in the room of one which was spoiled and left
at Mantua. They cost the King 100<HI>l.</HI> a piece, and after his death
were bought by the Spanish Embassador, the first purchaser of those
effects. As the King's collection was embezzled or taken by his ser∣vants
for their arrears, that minister laid out 500<HI>l.</HI> in those purchases
with Harrison (possibly the person mentioned p. 75.) the King's em∣broiderer
by Somerset-house, and of Murray his taylor he bought a
half figure of a Venus. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These and many other notices are taken from the Pocket-books of Richard Symonds of Black-Notley in Essex, gent. who was born at Okehampton, and was in the army of King Charles during the civil war, writing memoires of battles, actions, motions, and promotions of officers from time to time in small pocket-books; and through the several counties he passed, memorandums of churches, monuments, painted windows, arms, inscriptions, &amp;c. 'till January 1, 1648, when he left London, and travelled, first to Paris, and then to Rome and Venice (al∣ways continuing his memoires) where he stayed 'till his return to England in 1652. Eight or ten of these books were in the Harleian library, two in that of Dr. Meade, and two or three in the herald's office, where is the pedigree of his family with his picture (probably) in red wax from a seal, engraved by T. Simon, his namesake, but no relation.</NOTE> The Flemings gave any price for the works
of Vandyck from that collection. Sir Peter Lely, as may be seen in
his catalogue, had several capital ones.</P>
<P>But it is at the Earl of Pembroke's at Wilton that Vandyck is on
his throne. The great Salon is entirely furnished by his hand. There
is that principal picture of Earl Philip and his family, which though
damaged, would serve alone as a school of this master. Yet with great
admiration of him I cannot but observe how short he falls of his model
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
Titian. What heads both of age and youth are in the family of
Cornaro at Northumberland-house! How happily is the disposition of
a religious act chosen to throw expression into a groupe of portraits!
It is said that the Earl of Pembroke had obtained leave to have a piece
of the whole royal family by the same hand as a companion to his
own.</P>
<P>At Leicester-house is a double portrait, bought by the late Prince of
Wales of Mr. Bagnols. It represents two of the wits of that time, T.
Carew, of the privy-chamber to Charles I. and a poet, and Henry
Killigrew. They had a remarkable dispute before Mrs. Cecilia Crofts,
sister of the Lord Crofts, to which Vertue supposed this picture allu∣ded,
as in a play called the Wanderer, was a song against jealousy,
written on the same occasion.</P>
<P>I have reserved to the last <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have here, as in the case of Holbein, mentioned only the capital pieces, or those, which being in great collections are most easy of access. I do not pretend to enumerate all that are or are called of this master.</NOTE> the mention of the finest picture in my
opinion of this master. It is of the Earl of Strafford and his secretary,
at the Marquis of Rockingham's at Wentworth-house in Yorkshire.
I can forgive him any insipid portraits of perhaps insipid people, when
he showed himself capable of conceiving and transmitting the idea of
the greatest man of the age. There is another of these pictures at
Blenheim, but infinitely inferior.</P>
<P>In the cathedral of Glocester are two cumbent figures of an alder∣man
and his wife, evidently wrought from a design of Vandyck. It
is great pity the sculptor is not known, so successfully has he executed
the manner of the painter. The figures, even in that tasteless attitude,
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
are easy and gracefull, and the draperies have a peculiar freedom. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanderson, a quaint writer, uses a phrase, which, though affected, is expres∣sive; He says "Vandyck was the first painter, who e're put ladies dress into a careless romance." Graphice p. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>Vandyck had 40<HI>l.</HI> for a half, and 60<HI>l.</HI> for a whole length; a more
rational proportion than that of our present painters, who receive an
equal price for the most insignificant part of the picture.</P>
<P>He was indefatigable, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is evident by the number of his works, for though he was not above forty-two when he died, they are not exceeded by those of Rubens.</NOTE> and keeping a great table, often detained
the persons who sat to him, to dinner, for an opportunity of studying
their countenances, and of retouching their pictures again in the after∣noon.
Sir Peter Lely told Mrs. Beale, that Laniere assured him he had
sat seven entire days to him morning and evening, and that, notwith∣standing,
Vandyck would not once let him look at the picture, 'till he
was content with it himself. This was the portrait that determined
the King to invite him to England a second time. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is at the seat of the Lord Chancellor Henley at the Grange in Hampshire.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the summer he lived at Eltham in Kent; in an old house there,

how well he lived. He was fond of musick and generous to
musicians. His luxurious and sedentary life brought on the gout, and
hurt his fortune. He sought to repair it, not like his master by the la∣boratory
of his painting room, but by that real folly, the pursuit of the
Philosopher's stone, in which perhaps he was encouraged by the ex∣ample
or advice of his friend Sir Kenelm Digby. Towards the end of
his life the King bestowed on him for a wife, Mary the daughter of the
unfortunate Lord Gowry, which if meaned as a signal honour, might
be calculated too to depress the disgraced family by connecting them
with the blood of a painter. It is certain that the alliance does not seem
to have attached Vandyck more strongly to the King; whether he had
any disgusts infused into him by his new wife, or whether ambitious,
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
as I have hinted, of vying with the glory of his master in the Luxem∣burg,
Sir Antony soon after his marriage set out for Paris, in hopes, of
being employed there in some public work. He was disappointed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was not totally unemployed there Sir Richard Lyttelton has two small pictures in chiaro scuro, evidently designed for altar-pieces, and representing Anne of Austria and some monkish saint.</NOTE>
—their own Poussin was then deservedly the favorite at that court.
Vandyck returned to England, and in the same humour of executing
some public work, and that in competition with his master. He pro∣posed
to the King by Sir Kenelm Digby to paint the walls of the ban∣quetting-house,
of which the cieling was already adorned by Rubens,
with the history and procession of the order of the garter. The proposal
struck the King's taste, and by a small sketch <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Now at the Lord Chancellor Henley's at the Grange in Hampshire.</NOTE> in chiaro scuro for the
procession, in which, though very faint, some portraits are distinguisha∣ble,
it looks as if it had been accepted, though some say it was rejected,
on the extravagant price demanded by Vandyck: I would not specify
the sum, it is so improbable, if I did not find it repeated in Fenton's
notes on Waller. It was fourscore thousand pounds! The civil war
prevented farther thoughts of it, as the death of Vandyck would have
interrupted the execution, at least the completion of it. He died in
Black-fryars December 9, 1641, and was buried on the 11th in St.
Paul's near the tomb of John of Gaunt.</P>
<P>By Maria Ruthven his wife, he left one daughter married to Mr.
Stepney, a gentleman who rode in the horse-guards on their first
establishment by Charles II. Their grandson Mr. Stepney was Envoy
to several courts, and is known by his poems published in the collection
of the works of our minor poets. Sir John Stepney, another descen∣dent,
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>
died on the road from Bath to Wales in 1748. Lady Vandyck
the widow was married again to Richard Pryse son of Sir John Pryse
of Newton-Aberbecham in Montgomeryshire Knight. Richard, who
was created a Baronet August 9, 1641, was first married to Hesther,
daughter of Sir Hugh Middleton; by Vandyck's widow he had no
issue. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue ascertained these matches by books in the college os arms.</NOTE></P>
<P>Besides his legitimate children Vandyck had a natural daughter
called Maria Teresa, to whom, as appears by his will in Doctor's Com∣mons,
he left four thousand pounds, then in the hands of his sister
Susannah Vandyck in a convent at Antwerp, whom he appoints trus∣tee
for that daughter. To his sister Isabella he bequeaths 250 guild∣ers
yearly; and in case his daughter Maria Teresa die unmarried, he
entails 4000<HI>l.</HI> on another sister, married to Mr. Derick, and her chil∣dren.
To his wife Mary and his newborn daughter Justiniana Anna
he gives all his goods, effects and monies, due to him in England from
King Charles, the Nobility, and all other persons whatever, to be equal∣ly
divided between them. His executors are his wife, Mr. Aurelius
de Meghan, and Katherine Cowley, to which Katherine he leaves the
care of his daughter to be brought up, allowing ten pounds per ann.
'till she is eighteen years of age. Other legacies he gives to his exe∣cutors
and trustees for their trouble, and three pounds each to the poor
of St. Paul's and St. Anne's Black-friar's, and to each of his servants
male and female.</P>
<P>The war prevented the punctual execution of his will, the probate
of which was not made 'till 1663, when the heirs and executors from
abroad and at home assembled to settle the accounts and recover what
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>
debts they could—but with little effect. In 1668, and in 1703, the
heirs, with Mr. Carbonnel who had married the daughter of Vandyck's
daughter, made farther inspections into his affairs and demands on his
creditors, but what was the issue does not appear.</P>
<P>Lady Lempster, mother of the last Earl of Pomfret, who was at
Rome with her Lord, wrote a life of Vandyck, with some description
of his works.</P>

<P>DAVID BECK,</P>
<P>born at Arnheim in 1621; he was in favour with Charles I. and
taught the Prince and the Dukes of York and Glocester to draw.
Descamps says that Beck's facility in composition was so great, that
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
Charles I. said to him, "faith! Beck, I believe you cou'd paint riding
post." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 315.</NOTE> He afterwards went to France, Denmark and Sweden, and
died in 1656.</P>
<P>GEORGE GELDORP,</P>
<P>of Antwerp, a countryman and friend of Vandyck, in whose house
that painter lodged at his first arrival, had been settled here some time
before. He could not draw himself, but painted on sketches made by
others, and was in repute even by this artificial practice; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This must not be supposed to include his portraits, for which he certainly would have had no custom, if the persons had been obliged to sit to two different men. A painter may execute a head, tho' he cannot compass a whole figure. A print by Voerst of James Stewart Duke of Lenox, with Geo. Geldorp pinx. is indubitable proof that the latter painted portraits.</NOTE> though Vertue
was told by Mr. Rose that it was not his most lucrative employment,
his house being reckoned convenient for the intrigues of people of
fashion. He first lived in Drury-lane in a large house and garden
rented from the crown at 30<HI>l.</HI> per ann. and afterwards in 1653
in Archer-street. He had been concerned in keeping the King's
pictures, and when Sir Peter Lely first came over, he worked for Gel∣dorp,
who lived 'till after the restoration, and was buried at Westmin∣ster.
Another of the apprentices of Geldorp was</P>

eighty-eight, and died June 28, 1721.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> BRADSHAW</P>
<P>was another painter in the reign of Charles I. whom I only mention
with other obsolete names to lead inquirers to farther discoveries. All
I find of him is a note from one of the pocket-books of R. Symonds
above-mentioned, who says, "Pierce in Bishopgate-street told me that
Bradshaw is the only man that doth understand perspective of all the
painters in London."</P>
<P>B. VAN BASSEN</P>
<P>of Antwerp, was a very neat painter of architecture. In the private
apartment below stairs at Kensington are two pictures by him; in one
are represented Charles I. and his Queen at dinner; in the other the
King and Queen of Bohemia, distinguished by their initial letters F.
and E. The Duchess of Portland has a magnificent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Oxford paid three hundred and ten pounds for it.</NOTE> cabinet of ebony,
bought by her father the Earl of Oxford from the Arundelian collec∣tion
at Tart-hall. On each of the drawers is a small history by Polen∣burg,
and pieces of architecture in the manner of Steenwyck by this
Van Bassen, who must not be confounded with the Italian Bassans, nor
with the Bassanos, who were musicians to Charles, and of which name
there was also a herald-painter. The first Bassano, who came hither in
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
the reign of Queen Elizabeth and was related to the Italian painters of
that name, settled in Essex and purchased an estate, which was sold in
1714 by the male descendent. In the mansion was a portrait of the
musician, holding a bass-viol. It is now at Narford in Norfolk, the
seat of the late Sir Andrew Fountain.</P>
<P>CORNELIUS POLENBURG</P>
<P>the sweet painter of little landscapes and figures, was born at Utrecht
in 1586, and educated under Bloemart, whom he soon quitted to tra∣vel
to Italy, as he abandoned, say our books, the manner of Elsheimer
to study Raphael—but it is impossible to say where they find Raphael
in Polenburg. The latter formed a style entirely new, and though
preferable to the Flemish, unlike any Italian, except in having adorned
his landscapes with ruins. There is a varnished smoothness and finish∣ing
in his pictures that makes them always pleasing, though simple
and too nearly resembling one another. The Roman Cardinals were
charmed with the neatness of his works; so was the great Duke, but
could not retain him. He returned to Utrecht and pleased Rubens
who had several of his performances. King Charles invited him to
London, where he lived in Archer-street next door to Geldorp, and ge∣nerally
painted the figures in Steenwyck's perspectives. There is a
very curious picture at Earl Poulet's at Hinton St. George, represent∣ing
an inside view of Theobald's, with figures of the King, Queen, and
the two Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, William and Philip.
This piece is probably of Steenwyck, and the figures, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In King Charles's catalogue are mentioned the portraits of his majesty, and of the children of the King of Bohemia, by Polenburg: and in King James's are eight pieces by him.</NOTE> which are co∣pied
from Vandyck, either of Polenburg or Van Bassen.</P>

The works of Polenburg are very scarce; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are sixteen mentioned in the catalogue of James II.</NOTE> his scholar, John de Lis of
Breda, imitated his manner so exactly, that his pieces are often taken
for the hand of his master. The best picture in England of the latter
is at the Viscount Midleton's. I have his own and his wife's portrait
by him in small ovals on copper; they were my father's. The wife is
stiff and Dutch; his own is inimitable: Though worked up to the
tender smoothness of enamel, it has the greatest freedom of pencil, the
happiest delivery of nature.</P>
<P>Charles could not prevail on Polenburg to fix here: He returned to
Utrecht and died there in 1660, at the age of seventy-four.</P>

or when he died. It is certain he worked for King Charles. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In King James's catalogue are recorded ten of his works.</NOTE> The

I believe, was painted by him. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In France are the portraits of Charles and his Queen by him, about a soot high, in one piece, with a front of a royal palace in the back ground. Descamps says this picture is more carefully laboured than any work of Vandyck, and equal to the most valuable of Mieris. p. 385. I believe the fine piece of architecture at Houghton is by the hand of Steenwyck, the father. By the son was a capital picture of St. Peter in prison, which at Streater's sale in 1711 sold for 25<HI>l.</HI> It was afterwards in Dr. Meade's collection, who sold it to the late Prince of Wales.</NOTE> In a MS. catalogue of King Charles's
<PB N="114" REF="130"/>
collection is mentioned a perspective by Steenwyck, with the King and
Queen, in little, by Belcamp: In the same catalogue is recorded a lit∣tle
book of perspectives by Steenwyck, which on the sale of the King's
goods sold for no more than two pounds ten Shillings. Steenwyck's
name and the date 1629 are on the picture of Frobenius at Kensington,
which he altered for King Charles. It is the portrait of the son, that
is among the heads of painters by Vandyck. His son Nicholas was
in England also, painted for King Charles, and probably died here.</P>
<P>JOHN TORRENTIUS</P>
<P>of Amsterdam, is known to have been here, not by his works, but
on the authority of Schrevelius, in his history of Arlem, from whom
Descamps took his account. Torrentius, says the latter, painted admi∣rably
in small, but his subjects were not calculated to procure him ma∣ny
avowed admirers. He painted from the lectures of Petronius and
Aretine, had the confidence to dogmatize on the same subjects, and
practiced at least what he preached. To profligacy he added impiety,
'till the magistrates thought proper to put a stop to his boldness. He
underwent the question, and was condemned to an imprisonment of
twenty years; but obtained his liberty by the intercession of some men
of quality, and particularly of the English Embassador—what the
name of the latter was we are not told. Torrentius came over to
England, but giving more scandal than satisfaction, he returned to
Amsterdam, and remained there concealed 'till his death in 1640, aged
<PB N="115" REF="131" MS="y"/>

two glasses of Rhenish; the other, a naked man. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Catalogue, P p. 158, 162.</NOTE></P>
<P>KEIRINCX,</P>
<P>called here Carings, was employed by King Charles to draw views;
his works are mentioned in the royal catalogue, particularly prospects
of his majesty's houses in Scotland. In a sale of pictures in March
1745 was a landscape by him freely and brightly touched, with his
name written on it as above, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The French author of the Abregè calls him Alexander, which must be a mistake.

<P>JOHN PRIWITZER</P>
<P>was too good a painter to remain so long unknown. At Woburn,
besides some young heads of the family, is a whole length of Sir Wil∣liam
Russel, a youth, and Knight of the Bath in the robes of the order,
with a dwarf aged thirty-two. It is painted with great brightness and
neatness, and does not want freedom. Upon it is written Johannes
<PB N="116" REF="132"/>
Priwitzerus de Hungariâ faciebat 1627. I have never met with any
other mention of this name.</P>
<P>GEORGE JAMESONE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The materials of this article were communicated by Mr. John Jamisone, wine-merchant in Leith, who has another portrait of this painter by himself, 12 inches by 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>was the Vandyck of Scotland, to which title he had a double preten∣sion,
not only having surpassed his countrymen as a portrait-painter,
but from his works being sometimes attributed to Sir Antony, who
was his fellow-scholar; both having studied under Rubens at Ant∣werp.</P>
<P>Jamesone was son of Andrew Jamesone, an architect, and was born
at Aberdeen in 1586. At what age he went abroad, or how long he
continued there, is not known. After his return, he applied with inde∣fatigable
industry to portrait in oil, tho' he sometimes practiced in mi∣niature,
and in history and landscape too. His largest portraits <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His earliest works are chiefly on board, afterwards on a fine linen cloth, smoothly primed with a proper tone to help the harmony of his shadows. His best works were from 1630 to his death.</NOTE>
were generally somewhat less than life. His excellence is said to con∣sist
in delicacy and softness, with a clear and beautifull colouring, his
shades not charged, but helped by varnish, with little appearance of
the pencil. There is a print of him, his wife Isabella Tosh and a
young son, painted by himself in 1623, engraved by Alexander Jame∣sone,
his descendent, in 1728, and now in the possession of Mr. John
Alexander, limner at Edinburgh his great grandson, with several other

<PB N="117" REF="134"/>
portraits of the family, painted by George; particularly another of
himself in his school, with sketches both of history and landscape, and
with portraits of Charles 1st. his Queen, Jamesone's wife, and four
others of his works from the life.</P>
<P>When King Charles visited Scotland in 1633, the magistrates of
Edinburgh, knowing his majesty's taste, employed Jamesone to make
drawings of the Scottish monarchs, with which the King was so much
pleased, that inquiring for the painter, he sat to him and rewarded him
with a diamond ring from his own finger.</P>
<P>It is observable that Jamesone always drew himself with his hat on,
either in imitation of his master Rubens, or on having been indulged
in that liberty by the King when he sat to him.</P>
<P>Though most of the considerable families in Scotland are possessed
of works by this master, the greatest collection of them is at Tay∣mouth,
the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane; Sir Colin Campbell of
Glenorchy, his Lordship's ancestor, having been the chief and earliest
patron of Jamesone, who had attended that gentleman on his travels.
From a MS. on vellom, containing the genealogy of the house of
Glenorchy, begun in 1598, are taken the following extracts, written
in 1635, page 52;</P>
<P>"Item, The said Sir Coline Campbell (8th. Laird of Glenorchy)
gave unto George Jamesone, painter in Edinburgh, for King Robert
and King David Bruysses, Kings of Scotland, and Charles the 1st King
of Great Brittane France and Ireland, and his Majesties Quein, and for
nine more of the Queins of Scotland their portraits, quhilks are set up
in the hall of Ballock [now Taymouth] the sum of tua hundreth thrie
scor punds."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="135"/>
"Mair the said Sir Coline gave to the said George Jamesone for
the Knight of Lockow's Lady, and the first Countess of Argylle, and
six of the Ladys of Glenurquhay their portraits, and the said Sir Co∣line
his own portrait, quhilks are set up in the chalmer of Deass of Bal∣lock,
ane hundreth four scoire punds."</P>
<P>Memorandum. In the same year 1635 the said George Jamesone
painted a large genealogical tree of the family of Glenorchy, 8 feet
long and 5 broad, containing in miniature the portraits of Sir Duncan
Campbell of Lockow, of Archibald Campbell his eldest son, first Earl
of Argylle, and of Sir Coline Campbell his second son, first Laird of
Glenorchy, together with the portraits of eight successive Knights,
Lairds of Glenorchy, with the branches of their inter-marriages, and
of those of their sons and daughters, beautifully illuminated. At the
bottom of which tree the following words are painted on a scroll;
"The genealogie of the Hous of Glenurquhie, whereof is descendit
sundrie nobill and worthie houses, 1635, <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/>amesone faciebat."</P>
<P>Besides the foregoing, Lord Breadalbane has at Taymouth, by the
same hand, eleven portraits of Lords and Ladies of the first families
in Scotland, painted in 1636 and 1637.</P>
<P>From the extract above, it appears that Jamesone received no more
for each of those heads than twenty pounds Scots, or one pound thir∣teen
shillings and four-pence English: Yet it is proved by their pu∣blick
records that he died possessed of an easy fortune, which he left
to his three daughters, two of whom were honorably married. One
of them, named Mary, distinguished herself by admirable needlework,
a piece of which used to be exhibited on festivals in the Church of St.
Nicholas at Aberdeen. Her descendent Mr. Thomson of Portlethem
has an original picture of her father by himself. Three small portraits
<PB N="119" REF="136"/>
of the house of Haddington are in the possession of Thomas Hamilton
Esq. of Fala.</P>
<P>Many of Jamesone's works are in both colleges of Aberdeen. The
Sibyls there, it is said, he drew from living beauties of that city. Mr.
Baird of Auchmedden in Aberdeenshire has in one piece three young
Ladies, cousins, of the houses of Argyle, Errol and Kinnoul, their
ages, six, seven and eight, as marked on the side of the picture. The
same Gentleman has a small whole length of William Earl of Pem∣broke,
by some ascribed to Vandyck. At Mr. Lindsay's of Worme∣ston
in Fife is a double half length of two boys, of that family, play∣ing
with a dog, their ages five and three, 1636.</P>
<P>There is a perspective view of Edinburgh by Jamesone, with a
Neptune on the fore ground.</P>
<P>Having finished a fine whole length of Charles I. he expected the
magistrates of Aberdeen would purchase it for their hall, but they of∣fering
him too inconsiderable a price, he sold it to a gentleman in the
north of England.</P>
<P>Jamesone had many scholars, particularly Michael Wright, men∣tioned
in the third Volume of these Anecdotes. His own portrait is
in the Florentine chamber of Painters.</P>
<P>Though Jamesone is little known in England, his character as well
as his works were greatly esteemed in his own country. Arthur John∣ston,
the Poet, addressed to him an elegant Epigram on the picture of
the Marchioness of Huntley, which may be seen in the works of that
author printed at Middleburgh in 1642. The portrait itself is ex∣tant
in the collection of the Duke of Gordon; and in the Newton-college
of Aberdeen is the picture of Doctor Johnston himself by the
same hand. A Latin Elegy composed by David Wedderburn was
<PB N="120" REF="137"/>
printed on his death, which happened in 1644 at Edinburgh, where
he was interred in the church-yard by the Gray-friars, but without any
monument.</P>
<P>By his will, written with his own hand in July 1641, and breathing
a spirit of much piety and benevolence, he provides kindly for his wife
and children, and leaves many legacies to his relations and friends,
particularly to Lord Rothes the King's picture from head to foot, and
Mary with Martha in one piece: to William Murray he gives the
medals in his coffer, makes a handsome provision for his natural
daughter, and bestows liberally on the poor. That he should be in a
condition to do all this, seems extraordinary, his prices having been
so moderate; for enumerating the debts due to him, he charges Lady
Haddington for a whole length of her husband, and Lady Selon's of
the same dimensions, frames and all, but three hundred marks; and
Lord Maxwell for his own picture and his Lady's, to their knees, one
hundred marks; both sums of Scots money.</P>
<P>Mr. Jamisone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the name is now written, not Jamesone.</NOTE> has likewise a memorandum written and signed by
this Painter, mentioning a MS. in his possession, "containing two hun∣dred
leaves of parchment of excellent write adorned with diverse hi∣storys
of our Saviour curiously limned," which he values at two hun∣dred
pounds sterling, a very large sum at that time! What is become
of that curious book is not known.</P>
<P>WILLIAM DOBSON,</P>
<P>whom King Charles called the English Tintoret, was born in 1610, in
St. Andrew's parish in Holbourn; his family had been gentlemen of

<FIGURE>

good rank at St. Alban's, but having fallen into decay, he was put ap∣prentice
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. Symonds says he learned most of Old Cleyn.</NOTE> to Sir Robert Peake, whom I have mentioned, a painter and
dealer in pictures. Under him, though no excellent performer, but
by the advantage of copying some pictures of Titian and Vandyck,
Dobson profited so much, that a picture he had drawn being exposed
in the window of a shop on Snow-hill, Vandyck passing by was struck
with it, and inquiring for the author, found him at work in a poor
garret, from whence he took him and recommended him to the King.
On the death of Vandyck, Dobson was appointed Serjeant-painter,
and groom of the privy-chamber, and attended the King to Oxford,
and lodged in the high-street almost over against St. Mary's church in
a house where some of his works remained 'till of late years. At Oxford
his Majesty, Prince Rupert, and several of the Nobility <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres says, that Dobson being overwhelmed with business thought of a lucky way to check it. It was, obliging persons who sat to him to pay half the price down; and that he was the first who used this practice. By the swarms of portraits that are left on the hands of his successors, this method is either neglected, or has very little effect!</NOTE> sat to him;
but the declension of the King's affairs proved fatal to Dobson; he
loved his pleasures, and not having had time to enrich himself, was
involved in debts and thrown into prison, from whence he was deli∣vered
by one Mr. Vaughan of the Exchequer, whose picture he drew
and thought it the best of his portraits. He enjoyed this release but a
short time; dying at the age of thirty-six, he was buried at St. Martin's
October 28, 1646. A short life, in which he had promised much ex∣cellence.
His pictures are thought the best imitations of Vandyck;
they are undoubtedly very faithfull transcripts of nature. He painted
<PB N="122" REF="140"/>
history as well as portrait; and even the latter generally containing
more than a single figure, rise almost above that denomination.</P>
<P>Of the first sort, is the Decollation of St. John at Wilton. It is in a
good style, but the colouring is raw. The idea of St. John is said
to have been taken from the face of Prince Rupert. At Chatsworth
is a very particular picture, said to be General Monke, his child, and
his mistress, whom he took against the consent of her husband. The
man in armour, undoubtedly resembles Monke, but the whole piece has
the air of a holy family; nor is there any other tradition of any mistress
of Monke, but the famous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of her in Lord Clarendon's history of his life, in Ludlow's memoires, and in the collection of state poems, vol. i. p. 38.</NOTE> Anne Clarges whom he afterwards mar∣ried,
and who, some say, was a milliner. There are many instances of
painters who have deified their mistresses, but the character of the Vir∣gin
Mary was never more prostituted, than if assumed by Anne Clar∣ges.
Mr. Stanley has a picture extremely like this, by <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words" DISP=" _____ "/>. At
Albury in Surrey, the seat of the Earl of Arundel, was a picture by
Dobson of the woman caught in adultery, with several figures; the
heads taken from persons then living, among whom was the poet
Cowley. At Chippenham, in Cambridgeshire, formerly the seat of
Russel Earl of Orford, in one piece are Prince Rupert, Colonel John
Russel and Mr. William Murray drinking, and dipping their favour-ribbands

house is another family piece of Sir Thomas Brown, author of Reli∣gio
Medici, his wife, two sons and as many daughters. Mr. Willett,
merchant in Thames-street, has a small family-piece of Dr. Hibbard,
physician, his wife and five children. The father and mother are par∣ticularly
well painted. A little boy leans on the father's knee, evi∣dently
borrowed from the well-known attitude by Rubens of Sir B.
Gerbier's daughter. Two children on the right-hand were certainly
added afterwards, and are much inferior to the rest. The dates were
probably inserted at the same time. A whole length of Sir William
Compton is in the possession of the family. At the Lord Byron's is
the portrait of Sir Charles Lucas; and at Drayton in Northampton∣shire,
Henry Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough in armour with a page
holding his horse, and an angel giving him his helmet. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The last circumstance may relate to his preservation in the Civil War, in which he was wounded, and made his escape when taken prisoner with Duke Hamilton and Lord Holland. This picture has great merit.</NOTE> A head of
the Marquis of Montrose was taken for the hand of Vandyck: in a
corner in stone colour is a statue of peace, on the other side, his helmet.
At Mr. Skinner's (Mr. Walker's collection) is a large piece of Prince
Charles in armour, drawn about 1638, Mr. Windham, a youth, hold∣ing
his helmet; at bottom are arms and trophies. I have mentioned
a fine head of Vanderdort at Houghton. Dobson's wife, by him, is
on the stairs of the Ashmolean museum at Oxford; and his own head
is at Earl Paulett's; the hands were added long since by Gibson, as he
himself told Vertue. Charles Duke of Somerset had a picture of an old
man sitting, and his son behind him; on this picture was written the

At Rousham in Oxfordshire, the seat of the Cotterels are several
good portraits by him. Sir Charles Cotterel, when at Oxford with the
King, was engaged by his majesty to translate Davila's history of the
civil wars of France; the frontispiece designed by Sir Charles himself,
was drawn by Dobson; it represented Francis II. Charles IX. Henry
III. and IV. with two dogs, a popish and protestant cur, fighting be∣fore
them. This sketch is still preserved in the family, and in 1729
was engraved in London for the history of Thuanus. He etched his

<P>GERARD HONTHORST,</P>
<P>The favorite painter of the Queen of Bohemia, was born in 1592 at
Utrecht, and instructed in painting by Bloemart, but he compleated his
studies at Rome, where he stayed several years, and painted many
things for Prince Justiniani, and other works, excelling particularly in
night-pieces and candlelights. On his return he married well, and
having a fair character, was remarkable for the number of his disci∣ples
of rank. Sandrart who was one, says they were twenty-eight at
the same time, who each payed him an hundred florins yearly. But
his greatest honour was instructing the Queen of Bohemia and her
children, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Cashiobury, Lord Essex's, is a large picture of the Queen of Bohemia and her children by Honthorst. The elder sons are killing monsters that represent Envy, &amp;c. The King of Bohemia, like Jupiter, with the Queen again, like Juuo, are in the clouds.

Of the Princess Sophia there is a portrait in a straw hat by Hon∣thorst, at Wilton, natural, but not very good. The other Princess was Louisa Hollandina, who practiced that art with success. Two pictures painted by her were in the collection of her uncle King Charles. See catal. p. 53, No. 70, 71. One of them is at Kensington, Tobit and the Angel in water-colours, but now quite spoiled. In Lovelace's Lucasta is a poem on Princess Loysa drawing, p. 17. She was bred a protestant, but in 1664, went to Paris, turned catholic and was made Abbess of Maubuisson. She died in 1709 at the age of eighty-six.</NOTE> Sophia and the Abbess of
Maubuisson chiefly distinguished themselves. King Charles invited

him to England where he drew various <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were seven in King James's collection.</NOTE> pictures, particularly one
very large emblematic piece, which now hangs on the Queen's stair∣case
at Hampton-court. Charles and his Queen, as Apollo and Diana,
are sitting in the clouds; the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is another at Kensington of the Duke and Duchess (to the knees) sit∣ting with their two children.

The Duke had a large picture by Honthorst, representing a tooth-drawer with many figures round him, five feet by seven feet.</NOTE> Duke of Buckingham under the figure of

of his life was employed in the service of the Prince of Orange, whose
houses at the Hague, Hounslaerdyck and Reswick were adorned by
his pencil with poetic histories. At the last of the three he painted a
chamber with the habits, animals and productions of various countries,
and received 8000 florins for his labour. He died at the Hague in
1660. Descamps in his second volume says, that Honthorst brought
to England Joachim Sandrart, his scholar, and that the king bespoke
many pictures of him; and that for the Earl of Arundel he copied
from Holbein, Henry 8th, Sir T. More, Erasmus, and several others;
and that he left England and went to Venice in 1627. I find no
other authority for this account: not one work of Sandrart is mention∣ed
in K. Charles's collection; and what is more conclusive against his
having been in England, he takes not the least notice of it himself in
the life of Honthorst, tho' he relates his master's journey to England
and his works here, and calls himself one of his disciples.</P>
<P>JOHN VAN BELCAMP</P>
<P>was employed under Vanderdort as a copyer of the King's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One was of the Queen in small in a piece of perspective, sold at the disper∣sion of the collection.</NOTE> pictures,
and was reckoned to succeed. The whole length of Edward IV. in his
night-gown and slippers, (the face in profile) which hangs over the
chimney in the anti-chamber at St. James's, was painted by Belcamp,
the face probably taken from the ancient original. In the catalogue
of James II. are mentioned pictures of Edward III. the Black Prince,
Anne of Denmark, Louis XIII. and of a large stag; Edward III. and
<PB N="128" REF="148"/>
the Black Prince are still in an anti-room at St. James's, and that of
the King of France is perhaps the portrait now at Hampton-court.
At Drayton, the seat of the Lady Elizabeth Germain in Northamp∣tonshire,
are whole lengths of Henry 7th. and 8th. copied by Bel∣camp
from the large picture of Holbein, which was burned at White∣hall.
When King Charles secretly withdrew from that palace, in the

Van∣dyck was said to be in love with her, but was so ungalant as to dispute with her on the price of her picture, which he threatened to sell if she would not give him what he demanded. See a letter of Lord Conway to Lord Wentworth in a collection published by Dodsley in two volumes 1754. vol. i. p. 136. It was thought the Lord Cottington would have married her, but that she was in love with Carey Raleigh, Sir Walter's son, mentioned in the text. At last she married Poliander Kirkhoven Lord of Helmfleet in Holland, and died April 9, 1677.

At Wimpole in Cambridgeshire the seat of the Earl of Oxford, which
had been Sir Henry Pickering's and before him the seat of the Tem∣pests,
were copies by Belcamp of several English heads, remarkable

<P>Belcamp was added by a vote of the Commons June 2, 1649, to the

for the sale in 1650 are witnessed by him. In one of the pocket-books
of R. Symonds he is said to be lately dead in 1653.</P>

distinguishing himself at Florence, Rome and Genoa, he went to Savoy,
and from thence passing into France, was invited over by King Charles,
who gave him lodgings and a considerable salary, and employed him
in his palaces, particularly at Greenwich, in painting cielings. Nine
pieces, which were in that palace, were sold after the King's death for

A ceiling from thence was since at the house of Sheffield Duke of
Buckingham in St. James's park. It represented the nine muses in a
large circle. He painted too the family of Villiers, and a large picture
for him eight feet wide by five high, of a Magdalen lying in a grotto
contemplating a skull. At Hampton-court is his Joseph and Potiphar's
wife; he drew other things for the King and presented him with a
book of drawings. Of Lot and his daughters there is a print after
him, in which he is called by mistake Civis Romanus, engraved by
Lucas Vosterman. He made several attempts at portrait painting,
but with little success, and after residing here about twelve years, died
at the age of eighty-four, and was buried under the altar in the chapel
at Somerset-house. His daughter</P>

was even employed in the treaty of Mantua. One picture is said
expresly in the King's catalogue to have been changed with Mr. La∣niere.
His fame was most considerable as a musician. In Ben John∣son's
works is a masque performed at the house of the Lord Hay in
1617 for the entertainment of the French Embassador, the whole
masque after the Italian manner, stylo recitativo, by master Nicholas
Laniere, who ordered and made both scenes and music. He was em∣ployed
many years afterwards in a very different and more melancho∣ly
manner; a vocal composition for a funeral hymn on his royal mas∣ter,

got in amongst them and made them all black. Mr. Hieronymo La∣niere
told me that to cleanse them, first he tried fasting spittle; then
he mixt it with warm milk, and those would not do. At last he
cleansed them with aqua-vitae alone, and that took off all the spots and

"He would never stay in a country where they cut off their King's
head and were not ashamed of the action." It had been more sensible
to say, he would not stay where they cut off the head of a King that
rewarded painters, and defaced and sold his collection. One John

<P><PB N="134" REF="157"/>JOHN DE CRITZ</P>
<P>has been mentioned in the former volume. Though serjeant painter to
Charles I. He may more properly be called a retainer to the arts than
a professor. His life is to be collected rather from office-books than
from his works or his reputation. Yet he was not ignorant. I have
two sketches of heads drawn by him with a pen, that are masterly.
Vertue saw many more in the hands of Murray the painter who was
scholar of a son or nephew of De Critz, who, according to Murray,
painted bravely scenes for masks. Among those drawings was a sketch
from a picture of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Earl of Oxford's library was a copy of Holland's Heroologia, in which in an old hand, supposed to be done immediately after the publication of the book in 1618, was written where every picture was from which the prints were taken.

Maynard with a paper in his hand. In a book belonging to the board
of works was a payment to John De Critz for repairing pictures of
Palma and the Caesars of Titian. This was in 1632. Among the
annuities and fees payable out of the customs in the port of London
in that reign was a payment to John De Critz his majesty's serjeant∣painter,
for his annuity at 40<HI>l.</HI> a year due to him for one year ended
at Michaelmas 1633. And in a wardrobe account, lost in the fire in

of serjeant painter, it may comfort the profession to know that Solimeni,
who was inferior to no painter of any age in vanity, whatever he was in
merit, painted a coach for the present King of Spain, when King of
Naples, which cost 12000<HI>l.</HI> Indeed I can produce no precedent of any

mace-bearer to the house of parliament. A head of one Oliver De

at the Hague; and for the Heer Van Wenwing two usurers counting
their money; while he worked on this he wanted a sum himself, which
he borrowed of the person who had ordered the picture, and which
when it was finished, Wenwing would have deducted, but Hanneman
told him that all the gold he had borrowed was put into the picture,
and was what the misers were counting. He died about 1680. His
son, called William, was buried in St. Martin's in 1641.</P>
<P>There were several other painters here in the reign of Charles, who
were so inconsiderable, or of whom I find so little, that I shall mention
them very briefly.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="162"/>
Cornelius Neve drew the portraits of Richard Lord Buckhurst and
Mr. Edward Sackville in one piece in 1637. It is at Knowle. No. 73.
in the picture-gallery at Oxford is painted by him, where he is called
a celebrated painter. In 1664 he drew the portrait of Mr. Ashmole
in his herald's coat. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ashmole's Diary, p. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>K. Coker, painted a head of Colonel Massey, preserved at Codding∣ton
in Cheshire.</P>
<P>Matthew Goodricke or Gothericke, is mentioned as a painter in one
of the office books of that reign.</P>
<P>In the inventory of the pictures at Oatlands was a view of Green∣wich
by Stalband; and in Mr. Harene's sale 1764, was an octagon
landscape with the story of the Centurion, by the same hand; some∣thing
in the manner of Paul Brill, but the colours exceedingly bright
and glaring. And in another catalogue of the King's pictures was a
prospect of Greenwich by Portman.</P>
<P>Mr. Greenbury is mentioned in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 173.</NOTE> catalogue of the King's col∣lection
for copying two pictures of Albert Durer by the direction of
the Lord Marshal. Probably he was one of Lord Arundel's painters.</P>
<P>Horatio Paulin lived chiefly in Holland. He came to England,
went to Hamburgh, and thence to the Holy-land. Rotiere agreed to
go with him but was discouraged. Descamps <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page 151. vol. iii.</NOTE> expresses surprize,
"that pious painters should have exhibited to the public very licenti∣ous
<PB N="139" REF="163"/>
pieces and scandalous nudities." But by the account which he
has given of Horatio Paulin, he seemed to present himself with a very
easy solution of this paradox. Paulin set on foot a kind of promiscu∣ous
crusado to the Holy-land; they were stored with crosses, relicks,
&amp;c. and on the road made many proselytes of both sexes. A baker's
wife in particular was so devout, that she thought it a meritorious ac∣tion
to plunder her husband of his plate, that she might equip herself
for the pilgrimage. When the caravan was furnished by theft, one
may easily conceive why it's apostle painted indecent altar-pieces.</P>
<P>Povey lived in this reign and painted a head which was in the
possession of Mr. Leneve, Norroy.</P>

<P>Holderness drew the picture of an old woman with a skull, which

<P>T. Johnson made a draught of Canterbury in 1651, which hangs

</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="164"/>FRANCIS BARLOW</P>
<P>was of more note than the preceding artists. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See English School.</NOTE> He was born in Lin∣colnshire,
and placed with one Sheperd a face-painter; but his taste
lay to birds, fish and animals, in which he made great figure, though
his colouring was not equal to his designs—consequently, which is
not often the case, the prints from his works did him more honour,
than the works themselves, especially as he had the good fortune to have
some of them engraved by Hollar and Faithorn. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The title to one of his books, in which some are etched by Hollar, is, "Di∣versae Avium species studiosissimé ad vitam delineatae per Fran.

of animals from the drawings of Barlow, and a set of cuts for Aesop's
Fables. Some cielings for birds he painted for noblemen and <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">At Clandon, Lord Onslow's, are five pieces by Barlow.</NOTE> gentle∣men
in the country; and he drew some of the monuments in West∣minster-abbey,
designed for an edition of Mr. Keep's history of that
cathedral. Mr. Symonds says he lived near the drum in Drury-lane,
and received eight pounds for a picture of fishes. He once painted a
half length of General Monke; and the herse was designed by him, as
was expressed in the Lord Chamberlain's warrant to Sir Christopher
Wren to prepare timber for it at Monke's funeral. I have a curious
long roll, engraved by White, exhibiting the ceremonies and proces∣sion
of that magnificent interment, with a full description of it; the
frontispiece is well designed by Barlow. It is remarkable that forty
gentlemen of good families submitted to wait as mutes with their backs
against the wall of the chamber where the body laid in state, for three

weeks, waiting alternately twenty each day. Barlow, though inherit∣ing
a large sum of money from a friend, died poor so lately as 1702.</P>
<P>Sir TOBY MATTHEWS</P>
<P>one of those heteroclite animals who finds his place any where. His
father was Archbishop of York, and he a jesuit. He was supposed a
wit, and believed himself a politician. His works are ridiculous, and
his greatest success was a little mischief in making converts. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the Lady Newburgh being converted to popery, Lord Conway writes thus to the Earl of Strafford, "The King did use such words of Wat. Montagu and Sir Tobie Matthew, that the fright made Wat keep his chamber longer than his sickness would have detained him; and Don Tobiah was in such perplexity that I find he will make a very ill man to be a martyr; but now the dog doth a∣gain wag his tail." Strafford papers vol. ii. p. 125. It seems in this business Mat∣thews was unjustly accused; the conversion had been made by the Duchess of Buckingham and Signor Con, the Spanish resident, p. 128.</NOTE> The
famous Countess of Carlisle, as meddling as Matthews, and as affected,
was the object of his adoration. He drew a character of her, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See this character prefixed to his letters.</NOTE> which
commends her so impertinently, that with scarce straining, it might pass
for a satire. For instance, he says, "She has as much sense and grati∣tude
for the actions of friendship as so extreme a beauty will give her
leave to entertain; and that although she began to be civil to people at
first, she would rather show what she could do, than let her nature con∣tinue
in it, and that she never considered merit in others but in propor∣tion
as they had any to her. That she affected particularity so much,
that you might fear to be less valued by her for obliging her; that she
had little religion, was passionate, could suffer no condition but plenty
<PB N="142" REF="167"/>
and glory, was fickle, and gay only out of contradiction because her
physicians had told her she was inclined to melancholy"—with a heap
of such nonsense—in short, I believe, no proud beauty was ever so well
flattered to her own contentment. Mr. Garrard, master of the charter-house,
a man of more sense and more plain sense than Matthews, has
drawn this Lady's character in fewer words, and upon the whole not
very unlike Sir Toby's picture; "My lady Carlisle will be respected
and observed by her superiors, be feared by those that will make them∣selves
her equals, and will not suffer herself to be beloved but of those
that are her servants." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strafford papers vol. i. p. 363.</NOTE> Sir Toby Matthews's title to a place in this
work depends singly upon a letter from the Duchess of Buckingham to
the Duke, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">R. Symondes says, Mr. Gage, Sir Thoby Matthewes, Mr. Fl<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ill were buyers of pictures for the Duke of Buckingham.</NOTE> in which she tells him she had not yet seen the picture which
Toby Matthews had drawn of the Infanta and sent over. Vertue adds
that he had some small skill in limning; otherwise I should have con∣cluded,
that he had only drawn the Infanta's portrait in the same fan∣tastic
colours which he had employed on Lady Carlisle. However as it
is not foreign to the design of this work to throw in as many lights as
possible on the manners of the several ages, I did not unwillingly adopt
Vertue's mistake, if it is one. Whoever desires to know more of this
person, will find his life in the Athenae Oxonienses. But I have not yet
done with these motley characters; the King's taste made his court
affect to be painters and virtuosi; among these was</P>
<P>Sir JAMES PALMER,</P>
<P>often mentioned in the catalogue of the royal collection; in which he
<PB N="143" REF="168"/>
sold, gave and painted pictures. Of the latter was a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 52. for the others see p. 10. 53. 84. 115. 137. 159.</NOTE> piece of Tarquin
and Lucretia copied from Titian. Another, the feast of Bacchus, was
delivered to him by the King's own hands, to be copied in tapestry at
the manufacture in Mortlack. He had lodgings in the tennis-court at
Whitehall, and is often mentioned as a domestic servant. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He was chancellor of the garter, and married Katherine eldest daughter of William Lord Powys, widow of Sir Robert Vaughan, and was father of Roger Palmer Earl of Castlemain, husband of the Duchess of Cleveland.</NOTE> He was the
person sent to Richard Atkyns for the picture in which the King distin∣guished
two different painters; and Mr. Garrard in a letter to Lord
Strafford dated Jan. 9. 1633, says, "I had almost forgot to tell your
Lordship that the diceing-night the King carried away in James Pal∣mer's
hat 1850 pieces. The Queen was his half and brought him that
good luck; she shared presently 900." In Stone's accounts, from which
I have given some extracts above, is mention of a monument for Pal∣mer's
wife. If these men add no great ornament to our list, it will at
least be honoured by our next; the Hogarth of poetry was a painter
too; I mean,</P>
<P>SAMUEL BUTLER</P>
<P>the author of Hudibras. In his life prefixed to his works we are told,
"That for his diversion he practiced music and painting. I have seen,
adds the writer, some pictures said to be of his drawing which remained
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Several are actually extant in the possession of a person in Worcestershire.</NOTE> in that family (of Mr. Jefferys) which I mention not for the excellency
of them, but to satisfy the reader of his early inclinations to that noble
<PB N="144" REF="169"/>
art; for which also he was afterwards entirely beloved by Mr. Samuel
Cooper, one of the most eminent painters of his time."</P>
<P>FRANCIS CLEYN</P>
<P>was a painter in a different style from any we had seen here; for which
reason, though he arrived earlier than many I have mentioned, I reser∣ved
him 'till I had dispatched the performers in oil. He was born at
Rostock and retained in the service of Christian IV. King of Denmark,
but the excellence of his genius prompted him to the search of better
models than he found in that northern climate. He travelled to Italy
and stayed there four years; it was at Rome, I suppose, he learned those
beautifull grotesques, in which he afterwards shone. At Venice he
became known to Sir Henry Wotton, and Sir Robert Anstruther re∣commended
him to Prince Charles. He arrived while the Prince was
in Spain, but notwithstanding was graciously received by King James,
who mentions that circumstance in a Latin letter that he wrote to the
King of Denmark, desiring leave to detain Cleyn in England, though
with a permission to return first to Copenhagen and finish a work he
had begun there, and promising to pay the expence of his journey.
The letter is preserved by Fuller. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Worthies of Surrey, p. 77.</NOTE> The request was granted, and
Cleyn returned to London at the end of the summer. The King had
just then given two thousand pounds towards Sir Francis Crane's new
manufacture of tapestry at Mortlack. They had worked only after
old patterns; Cleyn was placed there, and gave designs both in history
and grotesque, which carried those works to singular perfection. It ap∣pears
by King Charles's catalogue that five of the cartoons were sent

thither to be copied by him in tapestry. His pension is recorded by
Rymer. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xviii, p. 112.</NOTE> "Know yee that we do give and graunt unto Francis Cleyne a certain annuitie of one hundred pounds by the year during his natural
life." He enjoyed this salary 'till the civil war; and was in such favour
with the King and in such reputation, that on a small drawing of him
in Indian ink about six inches square, which Vertue saw, he is called,
Il famosissimo pittore Francesco Cleyn, miracolo del secolo, e molto
stimato del re Carlo della gran Britania, 1646." Cleyn was not em∣ployed
solely in the works at Mortlack; he had a house near the church
in Covent-garden, and did several other things for the King and Nobi∣lity.
At Somerset-house he painted a cieling of a room near the gal∣lery
with histories and compartments in gold. The outside of Wimble∣don-house
he painted in fresco. Bolsover in Nottinghamshire, Stone∣park
in Northamptonshire, and Carew-house at Parson's-green (since
Lord Peterborough's) were ornamented by him. There is still extant
a beautifull chamber adorned by him at Holland-house, with a cieling
in grotesque, and small compartments on the chimnies, in the style and
not unworthy, of Parmegiano. Two chairs, carved and gilt, with large
shells for backs, belonging to the same room, were undoubtedly from
his designs; and are evidences of his taste. A letter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strafford papers.</NOTE> from Lord
Cottington to Lord Strafford, describing the former's house at Han∣worth,
mentions Cleyn, though not by name. "There is a certain large
low room made under the building with a fountain in it, and other rare
devises, and the open gallery is all painted by the hand of a second
Titian. Aug. 1629." In King Charles's catalogue is mention of four
<PB N="146" REF="172"/>
patterns for the great seal, drawings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed that some drawings by Cleyn are in the possession of the Earl of Moray in Scotland.</NOTE> on blue paper by Cleyn. He
made designs for various artists; particularly for several of Hollar's
plates to Virgil and Aesop: for these he received fifty shillings a piece.
There are two small books of foliages from his drawings; one contain∣ing
six small slips with animals in grotesque; the other, in five slips, of
the senses; and the initial letters of his name F. C. inv. 1646. And
two books for carvers, goldsmiths, &amp;c. containing 25 plates. It is
however uncertain whether these and a few other plates of the same
kind are not by his son, who had the same christian name, and imita∣ted
his father's manner. Such is a title-page to Lacrymae Musarum,
elegies on the Lord Hastings, who died in 1650, the day before he
was to have been married. Also, seven plates of the liberal arts, about
four or five inches square, prettily designed and neatly etched. On a
small print of the father, etched by the son, Mr. Evelyn wrote, "A
most pious man, father of two sons, who were incomparable painters
in miniature; all died in London." By the register of Mortlack it ap∣pears
that he had three sons; Francis born in 1625, who died and was
buried at Covent-garden October 21, 1650. Charles and John; and
two daughters, Sarah and Magdalen. He had another daughter, pro∣bably
born in London, and called Penelope. Vertue saw a miniature,
like Cooper's manner, but not so well, of Dorothea, youngest daughter
of Richard Cromwell, act. 4, 1668, with these letters, P. C. which he
thought signified Penelope Cleyn. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At Burleigh is a head of Cecil Lord Roos, 1677, with the same letters.</NOTE> In the catalogue of plates and
prints exhibited to sale by Peter Stent 1662, was a book of grotesques
in ten plates; Francis Cleyn inv. et sculpsit. Cleyn besides his own
<PB N="147" REF="173"/>
sons, instructed Dobson; and died himself about 1658. Mr. English <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He etched a small print from Titian, Christ and the two Disciples at Emaus.</NOTE>
a painter who died at Mortlack in 1718 had a picture of Cleyn and
his wife and several of his designs for tapestries, all which came to Mr.
Crawley of <HI>Hempsted</HI> Hertfordshire. Richard Symonds in one of his
pocket-books mentions another piece of Cleyn and his family by can∣dlelight,
and a copy by the son of a sacrifice from Raphael, which was
in the royal collection, and a drawing on coloured paper. At Ken∣sington
I have lately found a picture which I do not doubt is of Cleyn's
hand. It represents Christ and Mary in a chamber, the walls and
windows of which are painted in grotesque. Different rooms are seen
through the doors, in one I suppose is Martha employed in the business
of the family. There is merit in this piece, particularly in the per∣spective
and grotesques, the latter of which, and the figures in the
manner of the Venetian school, make me not hesitate to ascribe it to
this master.</P>
<P>JOHN HOSKINS.</P>
<P>For the life of this valuable master I find fewer <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is not even a portrait of him extant.</NOTE> materials, than of
almost any man in the list who arrived to so much excellence. Vertue
knew no more of him than what was contained in Graham's English
School, where we are only told "that he was bred a face-painter in oil,
but afterwards taking to miniature, far exceeded what he did before;
that he drew King Charles, his Queen and most of the court, and had
two considerable disciples, Alexander and Samuel Cooper, the latter of
whom became much the more eminent limner." Hoskins, though
<PB N="148" REF="174"/>
surpassed by his scholar, the younger Cooper, was a very good painter;
there is great truth and nature in his heads; but the carnations are too
bricky, and want a degradation and variety of tints. I have a head of
serjeant Maynard by him, boldly painted and in a manly style, though
not without these faults; and another good one of Lord Falkland,
more descriptive of his patriot melancholy than the common prints; it
was in the collection of Dr. Meade. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Burleigh is a portrait of David Cecil, son of John 4th. Earl of Exeter by Frances, daughter of the Earl of Rutland; it is dated 1644; and another of Sir Edward Cecil, afterwards Viscount Wimbledon.</NOTE> There is indeed one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Since the first edition of this book I have seen another at Burleigh, scarce inferior. It is the profile of a boy, in brown, holding in one hand a plaything like castanets. It is admirably natural.</NOTE> work of
Hoskins that may be called perfect; it is a head of a man, rather
young, in the gown of a master of arts, and a red satten wastecoat.
The clearness of the colouring is equal to either Oliver; the dishevelled
hair touched with exquisite freedom. It is in the possession of Mr.
Fanshaw, but not known whose portrait. Vertue mentions a son of
Hoskins of the same name, and says, that this mark <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="〈☐〉"/> distinguishes
the works of the father from those of the son, which have I. H. simply.
I meet with no other hint of a son of that name except in Sanderson,
who barely names him. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page 20. In the same place he speaks in the like transient manner of a son of Hilliard.</NOTE> One Peter Hoskins is entered into the re∣gister
of Covent-garden as buried July 1, 1681. Hoskins the father
was buried in that church Feb. 22, 1664. In the <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Page 75.</NOTE> catalogue of King
Charles are mentioned two drawings by Hoskins for the great seal.
<PB N="149" REF="175"/>
Colonel Sothby has a head of Sir Benjamin Rudyard by him, and a
profile, which Vertue thought might be Hoskins himself. Prefixed
to Coryat's Crudities is a copy of verses with his name to them.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER COOPER</P>
<P>was nephew of Hoskins, and with his brother Samuel, of whom an ac∣count
will be given in the ensuing volume, was instructed in water-colours
by their uncle. Alexander painted landscapes in this manner
as well as portraits. At Burleigh is the Story of Acteon and Diana
by him. He went abroad, resided some time at Amsterdam, and at
last entered into the service of Queen Christina.</P>
<P>ANNE CARLISLE,</P>
<P>a paintress, admired for her copies (it is not said whether in oil or mi∣niature)
from Italian masters. Graham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">English School.</NOTE> says, she was in such favour
with King Charles, that he presented her and Vandyck with as much
ultramarine at one time as cost him above five hundred pounds. If her
share was near equal, I should suppose she painted in oil. It would be
a very long time before the worth of 200<HI>l.</HI> in ultramarine could be
employed in miniatures. Vertue mentions her teaching a lady to paint,
whose picture she drew standing behind her own; herself was sitting
with a book of drawings in her lap; and he adds, that many pieces
painted by her were in the possession of a widow Lady Cotterel. Mrs.
Carlisle died about 1680.

</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="176"/>JOHN PETITOT</P>
<P>was patronized by the two monarchs, who of late years have given the
noblest encouragement to artists, Charles 1st. and Louis 14th. He
deserved their protection as a genius, and has never been equalled in
enamel. Zincke alone has once or twice, and but once or twice, pro∣duced
works that might stand in competition with any single per∣formance
of Petitot.</P>
<P>The latter was born at Geneva in 1607; his father, a sculptor and
architect, having passed part of his life in Italy, had retired to
that city. The son was designed for a jeweller, and having frequent
occasion to make use of enamel, he attained such a tone of colour, that
Bordier, who afterwards became his brother-in-law, conceived, that if
Petitot would apply himself to portrait, he might carry the art to great
perfection. Though both wanted several colours, which they knew
not how to prepare for the fire, their attempts had great success. Pe∣titot
executed the heads and hands, Bordier, the hair, draperies and
grounds.</P>
<P>In this intercourse of social labour, the two friends set out for Italy.
As painters, the treasures of the art were open to them; as enamellers,
they improved too by frequenting the best chymists of that country;
but it was in England that they were so fortunate as to learn the
choicest secrets in the branch to which they had devoted themselves.
Sir Theodore Mayern, first physician to Charles, and a great chymist,
communicated to them the process of the principal colours which
ought to be employed in enamel, and which surpassed the famous vi∣trifications
of Venice and Limoges.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="177"/>
Mayern introduced Petitot to the King, who knighted and gave
him an apartment in Whitehall. The French author of the Abregè
de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, whom I copy, and am sorry to
criticize while I am indebted to him, says, that Vandyck seeing some
designs of Petitot at the King's goldsmith's, and informing himself of
the author, advised him to quit the profession of jeweller, and apply
himself to painting portraits in enamel. But the biographer had told
us that that step was already taken; and surely had not been aban∣doned
during a long stay in Italy. What the same writer adds, that
Vandyck gave him instructions, when Petitot copied the works of
that master, and that his copies from Vandyck are his best performan∣ces,
is much more agreeable to probability and fact. The magnifi∣cent
whole length of Rachel de Rouvigny Countess of Southampton,
in the collection of the Duke of Devonshire, is painted from the origi∣nal
in oil by Vandyck, in the possession of Lord Hardwicke, and is
indubitably the most capital work in enamel in the world; it is nine
inches three quarters high, by five inches and three quarters wide; and
though the enamel is not perfect in some trifling parts, the execution
is the boldest and the colouring the most rich and beautifull that can
be imagined. It is dated 1642. His Grace has a head of the Duke
of Buckingham by the same hand; with the painter's name and the
date 1640; consequently a copy performed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is evidently copied from the Duke's portrait in his family-piece by Hon∣thorst at Kensington.</NOTE> after the Duke's death.
In the same collection is a portrait of a middle-aged man in armour, in∣closed
in a case of tortoishel, the person unknown, but inferior to none
I have seen of this master. The Duchess of Portland has another of
the Duke of Buckingham, exactly the same as the preceding; Charles
<PB N="152" REF="178"/>
first and his Queen, and the Lady Morton, governess of the royal
children, who is celebrated by Waller. I have a fine head of Charles
1st. in armour, for which he probably sat, as it is not like any I have
seen by Vandyck; James 2d. when Duke of York, freely painted,
though highly finished, and I suppose done in France; a very large
and capital one of his sister Henrietta Duchess of Orleans, exquisitely
laboured; a very small, but fine head of Anne of Austria; another of
Madame de Montespan; and a few more of less note, but all of them
touched in that minute and delicate style, into which he afterwards
fell in France, and which, though more laboured, has less merit in
richness of tints, than his English works. Vanderdort mentions a
carving by Petitot from Titian's Lucretia, in which way I find no
other account of his attempts, though, as his father was a sculptor, he
probably had given his son some instructions.</P>
<P>The tragic death of his royal protector was a dreadful stroke, says
his biographer, to Petitot, who attended the exiled family to Paris. I
question, as so few English portraits appear by his hand, and none
that I know later than 1642, whether the Civil War did not early
drive him back to France; but Bordier undoubtedly remained here
sometime longer, having been employed by the parliament to paint a
memorial of the battle of Naseby, which they presented to Fairfax
their victorious general. This singular curiosity is now in my posses∣sion,
purchased from the Museum of Thoresby, who <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have the receipt of the executors of Fairfax to Thoresby, who paid 185<HI>l.</HI> for his purchases. He has, at the end of his Ducatus Leodiensis, in the account of his own Museum, given a more minute description of these enamels.</NOTE> bought it, with
other rarities, from the executors of Fairfax. It consists of two round
plates each but an inch and half diameter, and originally served, I
<PB N="153" REF="179"/>
suppose, for the top and bottom of a watch, such enamelled plates
being frequent to old watches instead of crystals. On the outside of
that which I take for the bottom, is a representation of the House of
Commons, as exhibited on their seals by Simon. Nothing can be
more perfect than these diminutive figures; of many even the counte∣nances
are distinguishable. On the other piece, within, is delineated
the battle of Naseby; on the outside is Fairfax himself on his chestnut
horse, men engaging at a distance. The figure and horse are copied
from Vandyck, but with a freedom, and richness of colouring, per∣haps
surpassing that great master. Under the horse, one reads P. B.
fecit. This is the single work which can with certainty be allotted to
Bordier alone, and which demonstrates how unjustly his fame has been
absorbed in the renown of his brother-in-law. Charles 2d. during
his abode in that kingdom took great notice of Petitot; and introdu∣ced
him to Louis, who, when the restoration happened, retained Pe∣titot
in his own service, gave him a pension and lodged him in the
Louvre. Small portraits of that monarch by this great enameller, are
extremely common, and of the two Queens, his mother and wife.</P>
<P>In 1651 he married Margaret Cuper; the celebrated Drelincourt
performed the ceremony at Charenton; for Petitot was a zealous pro∣testant,
and dreading the consequences of the revocation of the edict
of Nantes in 1685, he begged permission of the King to retire to Ge∣neva.
Louis, who did not care to part with so favorite a painter,
and who perhaps thought that an enameller's religion was not compo∣sed
of sterner stuff, than the great Turenne's, eluded his demand; and
at last being pressed with repeated memorials, sent Petitot to Fort-l'eveque,
and Bossuet to convert him. The subtle apostle, who had
woven such a texure of devotion and ambition, that the latter was
<PB N="154" REF="180"/>
scarce distinguishable from the former, had the mortification of not
succeeding, and Petitot's chagrin bringing on a fever, he at last ob∣tained
his liberty, now almost arrived at the age of fourscore, which
makes it probable that his conversion rather than his pencil had been
the foundation of detaining him. He no sooner was free, than he
escaped with his wife to Geneva in 1685. His children, who dreaded
the King's wrath, remained at Paris, and throwing themselves at his
feet, implored his protection. His Majesty, says my author, receiv∣ed
them with great goodness, and told them, he willingly forgave an
old man, who had a whim of being buried with his fathers.—I do not
doubt but this is given, and passed at the time, for a bonmot—but a
very flat witticism cannot depreciate the glory of a confessor, who has
suffered imprisonment, resisted eloquence, and sacrificed the emolu∣ments
of court-favour to the uprightness of his conscience. Petitot
did not wish to be buried with his fathers, but to die in their religion.</P>
<P>Returned to his country, the good old man continued his darling
profession. The King and Queen of Poland desired to be painted by
his hand, and sent their portraits to be copied by him in enamel, but
the messenger finding him departed, proceeded to Geneva, where he
executed them with all the vigour of his early pencil. The Queen
was represented sitting on a trophy, and holding the picture of the
King. For this piece he received an hundred Louis d'or's.</P>
<P>So great was the concourse to visit him, that he was obliged to
quit Geneva and retire to Veray, a little town in the canton of Berne,
where as he was painting his wife, an illness seized and carried him off
in a day, in 1691, at the age of fourscore and four. He had had se∣venteen
children; one of his daughters, a widow, was living in 1752.
My portrait of Charles 1st. came from one of his sons, who was a ma∣jor
<PB N="155" REF="181"/>
in our service. Of the rest, one only attached himself to his father's
art and practiced in London, his father often sending him his works
for models. This son painted in miniature too, and left descendents,
who are settled at Dublin.</P>
<P>It is idle to write a panegyric on the greatest man in any vocation.
That rank dispenses with encomiums, as they are never wanted but
where they may be contested. Petitot generally used plates of gold
or silver, seldom copper. In the dawn of his reputation he received
twenty guineas for a picture, which price he afterwards raised to forty.
His custom was to have a painter to draw the likeness in oil, from
which he made his sketches, and then finished them from the life.
Those of Louis he copied from the best pictures of him, but generally
obtained one or two sittings for the completion. His biographer
says, that he often added <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He specifies one at Paris of Michel L'asne, the engraver, a large oval with hands, of which one rests on his breast.</NOTE> hands to his portraits; I have seen but one
such, the whole length of Lady Southampton; and that at Loretto
there is of his work an incomparable picture of the Virgin. A collec∣tor
at Paris possesses more than thirty of this great master's perfor∣mances,
particularly the portraits of Mesdames de la Valiere, Mon∣tespan,
Fontanges &amp;c. Another has those of the famous Countess
d'Olonne, the Duchess of Bouillon, and other ladies of the court. Van
Gunst engraved after Petitot the portrait of Chevreau.</P>
<P>Of Bordier, we have no fuller account than this incidental mention
of him; yet I have shown that his is no trifling claim to a principal
place among those artists whose works we have most reason to boast.
I wish this clue may lead to farther discoveries concerning him!</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="182"/>
I come now to other artists in the reign of Charles; and first of
statuaries.</P>
<P>ANDREW KEARNE</P>
<P>a German, was brother of Nicholas Stone the elder, for whom he
worked. Kearne too carved many statues for Sir Justinian Isham, at
his house near Northampton. At Somerset-stairs he carved the River∣god
which answered to the Nile, made by Stone, and a lioness on the
water-gate of York-stairs. For the Countess of Mulgrave a Venus
and Apollo of Portland stone, six feet high, for each of which he had
seven pounds. He died in England, and left a son that was alive
since 1700.</P>
<P>JOHN SCHURMAN</P>
<P>born at Emden, was another of Stone's workmen, and afterwards set
up for himself. He was employed by Sir John Baskerville; made two
shepherds sitting for Sir John Davers of Chelsea; a marble statue of
Sir T. Lucy, for his tomb in Warwickshire, for which he was paid
eighteen pounds, and fifty shillings for polishing and glazing; the same
for a statue on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This tomb of Douglas Lord Belhaven is in the church of the abbey of Holy∣rood-house.</NOTE> Lord Belhaven's tomb; a little boy on the same monu∣ment;
two sphinxes for Sir John Davers; and Hercules and Antaeus
for that gentleman's garden, at the rate of sixteen pounds.</P>
<P>EDWARD PIERCE</P>
<P>father and son, are mentioned here together, though the father was a

painter chiefly in the reign of the first Charles, the son a statuary who
worked mostly under the second Charles, but each may be allotted to
either period. The father painted history, landscape <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James II. had one of his hand. See the catalogue.</NOTE> and architecture;
but the greater part of his works consisting of altar-pieces and cielings
of churches were destroyed in the fire of London. One of his cielings
was in the church of Covent-garden. For some time he worked
under Vandyck, and several of his performances are at the Duke of
Rutland's at Belvoir. A book of freeze-work in eight leaves, etched
in 1640, was I suppose by the hand of the father; as to him must be
referred an entry in an office-book, where he is mentioned for paint∣ing
and gilding frames of pictures at Somerset-house at two shillings
the foot, Feb. 17, 1636. He also agrees to paint and gild the chimney
piece in the cross-gallery there for eight pounds. Dobson drew his pic∣ture.
He died a few years after the restoration and was buried at
Stamford. He had three sons, who all, says Graham, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">English School.</NOTE> became famous
in their different ways. One was John Pierce, a painter; of the third,
I find no account of his profession; the other was Edward the statuary
and architect. He made the statues of Sir Thomas Gresham, of Ed∣ward
III. at the Royal-exchange, and of Sir William Walworth at Fish∣monger's-hall;
a marble bust of Thomas Evans, master of, and a
great benefactor to, the company of painters in 1687: The bust is in
their hall: a model of the head of Milton, which Vertue had, the
bust of Sir Christopher Wren in the picture-gallery at Oxford, and a
bust of Cromwell sold at an auction in 1714. He much assisted Sir
Christopher in many of his designs, and built the church of St. Cle∣ment
under his direction. Edward Pierce too carved the four dragons
<PB N="158" REF="185"/>
on the monument, at fifty pounds each. The whole cost of that co∣lumn,
exclusive of the dragons, and of the basrelief which is not men∣tioned
in the account, appears by the survey of Hooke, Leybourn
and others, to have amounted to 8000<HI>l.</HI> A rich vase at Hampton-court
is another of the works of Pierce. He lived and died at his
house the corner of Surrey-street in the Strand, and was buried at St.
Mary's le Savoy, in 1698.</P>
<P>HUBERT LE SOEUR,</P>
<P>one of the sew we have had that may be called a clasfic artist, was a
Frenchman, and disciple of John of Boulogne. He arrived at least as
early as 1630, and by the only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been told that the monument of the Duchess of Lenox was Le Soeur's, but I am not certain of it.</NOTE> two of his works that remain, we may
judge of the value of those that are lost or destroyed. Of the latter were
a <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vanderdort's catalogue p. 180. I believe this very bust is now in the col∣lection of Mr. Hoare at Stourhead; I had not seen it when the first edition of this work was published.</NOTE> bust of Charles I. in brass, with a helmet surmounted by a dragon
à la Romaine, three feet high, on a black pedestal: The fountain at
Somerset-house with several statues; and six brazen statues at St.
James's. Of those extant are, the statue in brass of William Earl of
Pembroke in the picture-gallery at Oxford, given by the grand-father
of the present Earl; and the noble equestrian figure of King Charles
at Charing-cross, in which the commanding-grace of the figure and
exquisite form of the horse are striking to the most unpracticed eye.
This piece was cast in 1633 in a spot of ground near the church of
Covent-garden, and not being erected before the commencement of

the civil war, it was sold by the parliament to John Rivet a brazier li∣ving
at the dial near Holbourn-conduit, with strict orders to break it
in pieces. But the man produced some fragments of old brass, and
concealed the statue and horse under ground 'till the restoration. They
had been made at the expence of the family of Howard-Arundel,
who have still receipts to show by whom and for whom they were
cast. They were set up in their present situation at the expence of
the crown, about 1678, by an order from the Earl of Danby, after∣wards
Duke of Leeds. The pedestal was made by Mr. Grinlin Gib∣bons.
Le Soeur had a son Isaac who was buried Nov. 29, 1630, at
Great St. Bartholomew's. The father lived in the close.</P>
<P>ENOCH WYAT</P>
<P>carved two figures on the water stairs of Somerset-house, and a statue
of Jupiter. And he altered and covered the King's statues, which
during the troubles were thrust into Whitehall-garden, and which, it
seems, were too heathenishly naked to be exposed to the inflammeable
eyes of that devout generation.</P>
<P>ZACHARY TAYLOR</P>
<P>lived near Smithfield, was a surveyor and carver to the King, as he is
called in a book belonging to the board of works in 1631. In 1637
he is mentioned for carving the frames of the pictures in the cross-gallery
at Somerset-house at two shillings and two-pence per foot. He
carved some things too at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One Bowden, a captain of the trained-bands, was another carver at Wilton, I believe, at the same time with Taylor.</NOTE> Wilton. Mr. Davis of the Tennis-court
<PB N="160" REF="188"/>
at Whitehall had a good portrait of Taylor with a compass and square
in his hands.</P>
<P>JOHN OSBORN</P>
<P>was another carver of that time: Lord Oxford had a large head in re∣lievo
on tortoise-shell of Frederic Henry Prince of Orange; and these
words, Joh. Osborn, Angl. Amstelod. fecit, 1626.</P>
<P>MARTIN JOHNSON</P>
<P>was a celebrated engraver of seals, and lived at the same time with
Thomas and Abraham Simon, the medallists. He was a rival of the
former, who used puncheons for his graving, which Johnson never did,
calling Simon a puncher, not a graver. Johnson besides painted land∣scapes
from nature, selecting the most beautifull views of England,
which he executed, it is said, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">English School.</NOTE> with much judgment, freedom and
warmth of colouring. His works are scarce. He died about the be∣ginning
of the reign of James II.</P>

</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="189"/>CHRISTIAN VAN VIANEN. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was of Nuremberg. See Wren's Parentalia, p. 136.</NOTE></P>
<P>As there was no art, which Charles did not countenance, the chacers
and embossers of plate were among the number of the protected at
court. The chief was Vianen, whose works are greatly commended
by Ashmole. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Order of the Garter, p. 492.</NOTE> Several pieces of plate of his design were at Windsor,
particularly two large gilt water-pots, which cost 235<HI>l.</HI> two candlesticks
weighing 471 ounces; on the foot of one of them was chased Christ
preaching on the mount; on the other, the parable of the lost sheep;
and two covers for a bible and common-prayer book, weighing 233
ounces; the whole amounting to 3580 ounces, and costing 1564<HI>l.</HI> were
in the year 1639, when the last parcels were delivered, presented as of∣ferings
by his majesty to the chapel of St. George. But in 1642 cap∣tain
Foy broke open the treasury, and carried away all these valuable
curiosities, as may be seen more at large in Dugdale. An agreement
was made with the Earl-marshal, Sir Francis Windebank, and Sir
Francis Crane, for plate to be wrought for the King at twelve shillings
per ounce, and before the month of June 1637, he had finished nine
pieces. Some of these I suppose were the above-mentioned: others
were gilt, for Vianen complained that by the expence of the work, and
the treble-gilding, he was a great loser, and desired to be considered.
The designs themselves were thought so admirable, as to be preserved
in the royal collection. King Charles had besides four plates chased
with the story of Mercury and Argus. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vanderdort's catal. p. 74.</NOTE> Mr. West has two oval heads

in alto relievo six inches high of Charles and his Queen, with the ini∣tial

of the name, I do not know how related to him. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 137.</NOTE> King had the
portrait of a Venetian captain by Paul Vianen; and the offering <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 155.</NOTE> of
the wisemen by Octavian Vianen. There is a print of a head of Adam
Van Vianen, painted by Jan. Van Aken, and etched by Paul Vianen,
above-mentioned. Christian Vianen had a very good disciple</P>
<P>FRANCIS FANELLI,</P>
<P>a Florentine, who chiefly practiced casting in metal, and though infe∣rior
to Le Soeur, was an artist that did credit to the King's taste. Van∣derdort
mentions in the royal collection a little figure of a cupid sitting
on a horse running, by Fanelli, and calls him <HI>the one-eyed Italian.</HI> The
figures of Charles I. and his Queen in niches in the quadrangle of St.
John's college Oxford were cast by him, and are well designed. They
were the gift of Archbishop Laud, and were buried for security in the
civil war. William Duke of Newcastle was a patron of Fanelli, and
bought many of his works, still at Welbeck; particularly a head in
brass of Prince Charles 1640; with the founder's name behind the pe∣destal,
Fr. Fanellius, Florentinus, sculptor magn. Brit. regis. And se∣veral
figures in small brass; as, St. George with the dragon dead;
another combating the dragon; two horses grazing; four others in
different attitudes; a cupid and a turk, each on horseback, and a cen∣taur
with a woman. By the same hand, or Le Soeur's, are, I con∣clude,
the three following curious busts, in bronze; a head of Ed∣ward
Lord Herbert of Chirbury, the Author, in the possession of the
<PB N="163" REF="191"/>
Earl of Powis; and two different of the Lady Venetia Digby, wife
of Sir Kenelm. Behind the best of them, on which the point-lace of
her handkerchief is well expressed, is written this tender line, "Ux∣orem
vivam amare voluptas, defunctam religio." One of these was
probably saved from her monument. See before p. 102. Fanelli pu∣blished
two books of designs, of architecture, fountains, vases, &amp;c.
One consists of fourteen plates in folio, no date. The other in
twenty-one leaves, was published by Van Merle at Paris 1661, en∣graved,
as Vertue thought, by Faithorne, who was about that time
in France. Fanelli had a scholar, called John Bank, who was
living in 1713.</P>
<P>THEODORE ROGIERS</P>
<P>is mentioned by Vanderdort, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 73, 74.</NOTE> as the chaser of five square plates of
silver with poetic stories in the King's collection; and he made an ewer
from a design of Rubens, mentioned in the life of that painter. He
must not be confounded with William Rogers an Englishman, who
engraved the title-page to John Linschoten's collection of voyages to
the East Indies.</P>
<P>I shall now set down what little I have to say of the medallists of
King Charles. Briot has been mentioned under the preceding reign:
He and T. Simon, his disciple, possessed the royal favour 'till the be∣ginning
of the troubles, when Simon falling off to the parliament, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I have already referred the reader to Vertue's account of the two Simons and their works, which he intended as a part of this history of the arts, which is too long to transcribe here, and which wou'd be mangled by an abridgment. Abraham Simon, one of the brothers, a man of a very singular character, had fancied that the Queen of Sweden was in love with him, and at last had an ambition of being a bishop.</NOTE>
<PB N="164" REF="192"/>
a new medallist was employed on the few works executed for the King
during the remainder of his life; his name was</P>
<P>THOMAS RAWLINS.</P>
<P>The first work by which he was known to the public was of a nature
very foreign from his profession; in 1640 he wrote a play called The
Rebellion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Langbaine, p. 117. Subjoined to a book called Goodfriday, being me∣ditations on that day, printed in 1648, is a collection of poems called Calanthe; by T.

either a patron or relation of Rawlins, or one cannot conceive why he
should have gone back twenty one years to commemorate an obscure
person, so little connected with the singular events of the period when
it was struck. This medal was in the collection of Sir Hans Sloane,
and is now in the museum, as was and is, an oval piece of gold of
Charles II. the reverse a ship; better workmanship than the preceding.
There is but one piece more certainly known for his, a cast in lead,
thus inscribed, Rob. Bolles de Scampton in com. Lincol. Baronet;
under the shoulder T. Rawlins F. 1665. There might be and probably
were other works of his hand, to which in prudence he did not set his
name. Such is the bold medalion of Archbishop Laud, struck in
1644. He was employed by the crown 'till 1670, when he died.
There is a print of his wife, with this inscription; Dorothea Narbona

The last artist that I have to produce of this period, but the
greatest in his profession that has appeared in these kingdoms, and
so great, that in that reign of arts we scarce know the name of
another architect, was</P>
<P>INIGO JONES,</P>
<P>who, if a table of fame like that in the Tatler, were to be formed for
men of real and indisputable genius in every country, would save Eng∣land
from the disgrace of not having her representative among the arts.
She adopted Holbein and Vandyck, she borrowed Rubens, she produ∣ced
Inigo Jones. Vitruvius drew up his Grammar, Palladio showed
him the practice, Rome displayed a theatre worthy of his emulation,
and King Charles was ready to encourage, employ, and reward his
talents. This is the history of Inigo Jones as a genius. The particu∣lars
of his life have been often written, and therefore I shall run them
over very briefly; adding some less known minutiae [which, I fear,
are the characteristics of these volumes] and some catalogue of his
works.</P>
<P>He was born about 1572, the son of a cloth-worker, and by the
most probable accounts, bound apprentice to a joiner, but even in that
obscure situation, the brightness of his capacity burst forth so strongly,
that he was taken notice of by one of the great Lords at court; some
say, it was the Earl of Arundel; the greater <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among whom is Loyd in his Memoires, p. 577.</NOTE> number that it was Wil∣liam
Earl of Pembroke; though against that opinion there is, at least,
a negative evidence, which I shall mention presently. By one of these
Lords, Inigo was sent to Italy to study landscape-painting, to which
his inclination then pointed, and for which that he had a talent, ap∣pears

by a small piece preserved at Chiswick: the colouring is very in∣different,
but the trees freely and masterly imagined. He was no
sooner at Rome, than he found himself in his sphere. He felt that
nature had not formed him to decorate cabinets, but design palaces.
He dropped the pencil, and conceived Whitehall. In the state of
Venice he saw the works of Palladio, and learned how beautifully taste
may be exerted on a less theatre than the capital of an empire. How
his abilities distinguished themselves in a spot where they certainly had
no opportunity to act, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though no building at Venice is attributed to Inigo, the palace and a front of a church at Leghorn are said to be designed by him.</NOTE> we are not told, though it would not be the
least curious part of his history; certain it is, that on the strength of
his reputation at Venice, Christian IV. invited him to Denmark and
appointed him his architect; but on what buildings he was employed
in that country we are yet to learn. James I. found him at Copen∣hagen,
and Queen Anne took him in the quality of her architect to
Scotland. He served Prince Henry in the same capacity, and the
place of surveyor-general of the works was granted to him in reversion.
On the death of that Prince, with whom at least all his lamented qua∣lities
did not die, Jones travelled once more to Italy, and assisted by
ripeness of judgment perfected his taste. To the interval between
those voyages I should be inclined to assign those buildings of Inigo,
which are less pure, and border too much upon that bastard style,
which one calls <HI>King James's Gothic.</HI> Inigo's designs of that period are
not Gothic, but have a littleness of parts and a weight of ornaments,
with which the revival of the Grecian taste was encumbered, and
which he shook of in his grander designs. The surveyor's place fell
and he returned to England, and as if architecture was not all he had
<PB N="168" REF="197"/>
learned at Rome, with an air of Roman disinterestedness he gave up
the profits of his office, which he found extremely in debt, and pre∣vailed
on the comptroller and paymaster to imitate his example, 'till
the whole arrears were cleared.</P>
<P>In the reign of James I find a payment by a warrant from the coun∣cil
to Inigo Jones, Thomas Baldwin, William Portington and George
Weale, officers of his majesty's works, for certain scaffolds and other
works by them made, by the command of the Lord Chamberlain,
against the arraignment of the Earl of Somerset and the Countess his
Lady. The expence was twenty pounds.</P>

See also in the Strafford papers some letters of Mr. Gar∣rard which contain an account of proceedings under that commission, by virtue of which twenty newly erected houses in St. Martin's-lane were pulled down.</NOTE> is a commission to the Earl of Arundel, Inigo Jones
and several others, to prevent building on new foundations within two
miles of London and palace of Westminster.</P>
<P>In 1620 he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius.
King James set him upon discovering, that is, guessing, who were the
founders of Stone-henge. His ideas were all romanized; consequently
his partiality to his favorite people, which ought rather to have pre∣vented
him from charging them with that mass of barbarous clumsi∣ness,
made him conclude it a Roman Temple. It is remarkable that
whoever has treated of that monument, has bestowed it on whatever
class of antiquity he was peculiarly fond of; and there is not a heap of
stones in these Northern countries, from which nothing can be proved,
but has been made to depose in favour of some of these fantastic hy∣potheses.
Where there was so much room for vision, the Phoenicians
could not avoid coming in for their share of the foundation; and for
<PB N="169" REF="198"/>
Mr. Toland's part, he discovered a little stone-henge in Ireland, built
by the Druidess Gealcopa, (who does not know the Druidess Gealcopa?)
who lived at Inisoen in the county of Donnegal. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a summary of this controversy in the life of Inigo Jones in the Biogra∣phia Britannica.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the same year Jones was appointed one of the commissioners for
the repair of St. Paul's, but which was not commenced 'till the year
1633, when Laud, then Bishop of London, laid the first stone and
Inigo the fourth. In the restoration of that cathedral he made two capi∣tal
faults. He first renewed the sides with very bad Gothic, and then
added a Roman portico, magnificent and beautifull indeed, but which
had no affinity with the ancient parts that remained, and made his own
Gothic appear ten times heavier. He committed the same error at
Winchester, thrusting a screen in the Roman or Grecian taste into the
middle of that cathedral. Jones indeed was by no means successfull
when he attempted Gothic. The chapel of Lincoln's-inn has none of
the characteristics of that architecture. The cloyster beneath seems
oppressed by the weight of the building above. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Dugdale's Origines Judiciales, p. 34, is an account of the building of that chapel from a design of Inigo. The first proposal of building it was in 1609, but it was retarded 'till about 1617. The charge was estimated at two thousand pounds. It was finished in five years, and consecrated on Ascension-day 1623 by the Bishop of London, Dr. Donne preaching the sermon.</NOTE></P>
<P>The authors of the life of Jones place the erection of the banquet∣ting-house
in the reign of King Charles; but, as I have shown from
the accounts of Nicholas Stone, it was begun in 1619, and finished in
two years—a small part of the pile, designed for the palace of our
Kings; but so compleat in itself, that it stands a model of the most
pure and beautifull taste. Several plates of the intended palace of
<PB N="170" REF="199"/>
Whitehall have been given, but, I believe, from no finished design.
The four great sheets are evidently made up from general hints, nor
could such a source of invention and taste, as the mind of Inigo, ever
produce so much sameness. The strange kind of cherubims on the
towers at the end are proposterous ornaments, and whether of Inigo or
not, bear no relation to the rest. The great towers in the front are
too near, and evidently borrowed from what he had seen in Gothic,
not in Roman buildings. The circular court is a picturesque thought,
but without meaning or utility. The whole fabric however was so
glorious an idea, that one forgets for a moment, in the regret for it's
not being executed, the confirmation of our liberties obtained by a me∣lancholy
scene that passed before the windows of that very banquet∣ting-house.</P>
<P>In 1623 he was employed at Somerset-house, where a chapel was to
be fitted up for the Infanta, the intended bride of the Prince. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir H. Bourgchier in a letter to archbishop Usher, dated July 14, 1623, says, "The new chapel for the Insanta goes on in building." There was another chapel erected for her at St. James's, of which Don Carlos Colonna laid the first stone. V. Rushworth.</NOTE> The
chapel is still in being. The front to the river, part only of what was
designed, and the water-gate, were erected afterwards on the designs
of Inigo; as was the gate at York-stairs.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of Charles he was continued in his posts under
both King and Queen. His fee as surveyor was eight shillings and
four-pence per day, with an allowance of forty-six pounds a year for
house-rent, besides a clerk, and incidental expences. What greater re∣wards
he had are not upon record. Considering the havoc made in
offices and repositories during the war, one is glad of being able to re∣cover
the smallest notices.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="200"/>
During the prosperous state of the King's affairs, the pleasures of the
court were carried on with much taste and magnificence. Poetry,
painting, music, and architecture, were all called in to make them ra∣tional
amusements; and I have no doubt but the celebrated festivals
of Louis XIV. were copied from the shows exhibited at Whitehall, in
it's time the most polite court in Europe. Ben Johnson was the lau∣reat;
Inigo Jones, the inventor of the decorations; Laniere and Fera∣bosco
composed the simphonies; the King, the Queen, and the young
nobility danced in the interludes. We have accounts of many of these
entertainments, called masques: They had been introduced by Anne
of Denmark. I shall mention those in which Jones was concerned.</P>
<P>Hymenaei, or solemnities of masque and barriers, performed on the
twelfth-night 1606, upon occasion of the marriage of Robert Earl of
Essex, and the Lady Frances daughter of the Earl of Suffolk; at court;
by Ben Johnson. Master Alphonso Ferabosco sung; master Thomas
Giles made and taught the dances.</P>
<P>Tethys's festival, a masque, presented on the creation of Henry
Prince of Wales, June 5, 1610. The words by S. Daniel, the scenery
contrived and described by master Inigo Jones. This was called the
Queen's wake. Several of the Lords and Ladies acted in it. Daniel
owns that the machinery, and contrivance and ornaments of the scenes
made the most conspicuous part of the entertainment.</P>
<P>February 16, 1613, a masque at Whitehall on the nuptials of the
Palsgrave and the Princess Elizabeth, invented and fashioned by our
kingdom's most artfull and ingenious architect Inigo Jones; digested
and written by the ingenious poet, George Chapman. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapman was an intimate friend of Jones, and in 1616 dedicated his transla∣tion of Musaeus "To the most generally ingenious and learned architect of his time, Inigo Jones, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> surveyor of his majesty's works." See Wood's Athenac p. 591. Jones made the monument for Chapman in the church-yard of St. Gyles.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="201"/>
Jones had dabled in poetry himself: there is a copy of verses by him
prefixed to Coryat's Crudities, among many others by the wits of that
age, who all affected to turn Coryat's book into ridicule, but which at
least is not so foolish as their verses.</P>

sung, by William Davenant, her majesty's servant.</P>
<P>Love's mistress, or the Queen's masque, three times presented be∣fore
their Majesties at the Phoenix in Drury-lane, 1640. T. Hey∣wood
gives the highest commendation of Inigo's part in this perfor∣mance.</P>
<P>Lord Burlington had a folio of the designs for these solemnities, by
Inigo's own hand, consisting of habits, masks, scenes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The harmony of these triumphs was a little interrupted by a war
that broke out between the composers, Inigo and Ben; in which who∣ever
was the aggressor, the turbulent temper of Johnson took care to
be most in the wrong. Nothing exceeds the grossness of the language
that he poured out, except the badness of the verses that were the ve∣hicle.
There he fully exerted all that brutal abuse which his cotem∣poraries
were willing to think wit, because they were afraid of it; and
which only serves to shew the arrogance of the man, who presumed to
satirize Jones and rival Shakespeare. With the latter indeed he had
not the smallest pretensions to be compared, except in having some∣times
writ absolute nonsense. Johnson translated the ancients, Shake∣speare
transfused their very soul into his writings.</P>
<P>Another person who seems to have born much resentment to Jones
was Philip Earl of Pembroke; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. Symondes calls him, the bawling coward.</NOTE> in the Harleian library was an edition
of Stone-henge which formerly belonged to that Earl, and the margins
of which were full of strange notes writ by him, not on the work, but
on the author or any thing else. I have such another common-place
book, if one may call it so, of Earl Philip, the life of Sir Thomas
More. In the Stonehenge are memorandums, jokes, witticisms and
<PB N="174" REF="203"/>
abuse on several persons, particularly on Cromwell and his daughters,
and on Inigo, whom his Lordship calls, Iniquity Jones; and says, he
had 16000<HI>l.</HI> a year for keeping the King's houses in repair. This
might be exaggerated, but a little supplies the want I have mentioned
of any record of the rewards bestowed on so great a man. It is ob∣servable
that the Earl who does not spare reflections on his architect,
never objects to him his having been maintained in Italy by Earl Wil∣liam;
nor does Webb in his preface to the Stone-henge, though he
speaks of Inigo's being in Italy, say a word of any patron that sent him
thither. Earl Philip's resentment to Jones was probably occasioned
by some disagreement while the latter was employed at Wilton. There
he built that noble front, and a grotto at the end of the water. Wil∣ton
is one of the principal objects in a history of the arts, and Belles
Lettres. Sir Philip Sidney wrote his Arcadia there for his sister;
Vandyck drew many of the race, Holbein and Inigo Jones imagined
the buildings, Earl Thomas compleated the collection of pictures and
assembled that throng of statues, and the last Earl Henry has shown
by a bridge designed by himself, that had Jones never lived, Wilton
might yet have been a villa worthy of ancient Rome.</P>
<P>The works of Inigo are not scarce, though some that bear his name
were productions of his scholars: some indeed neither of the one nor
the other. Albins in Essex, I should attribute to the last class, though
always ascribed to Inigo. If he had any hand in it, it must have been
during his first profession, and before he had seen any good buildings.
The house is handsome, has large rooms and rich cielings, but all en∣tirely
of the King James's Gothic. Pishiobury in Hertfordshire is said
to have been built by him for Sir Walter Mildmay. At Woburn is
a grotto-chamber, and some other small parts by him, as there is of
<PB N="175" REF="204"/>
his hand at Thorney-abbey, and a summer-house at Lord Barrington's
in Berkshire. The middle part of each end of the quadrangle at St.
John's Oxford is ascribed to him. The supporters of the royal arms
are strangly crouded in over the niches; but I have seen instances of his
over-doing ornament. Charlton-house in Kent is another of his sup∣posed
works; but some critics have thought that only the great gate at
the entrance and the colonades may be of his hand. The cabinet at
Whitehall for the King's pictures was built by him, but we have no
drawing of it. At St. James's he designed the Queen's chapel. Surge∣on's-hall
is one of his best works; and of the most admired, the
arcade of Covent-garden and the church; two structures, of which I
want taste to see the beauties: In the arcade there is nothing remark∣able;
the pilasters, are as errant and homely stripes as any plaisterer
would make. The barn-roof over the portico of the church strikes my
eyes with as little idea of dignity or beauty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In justice to Inigo one must own, that the defect is not in the architect but in the order—who ever saw a beautifull Tuscan building? would the Romans have chosen that order for a temple? Mr. Onslow, the late speaker, told me an anecdote that corroborates my opinion of this building. When the Earl of Bed∣sord sent for Inigo, he told him he wanted a chapel for the parishioners of Co∣vent-garden, but added, he wou'd not go to any considerable expence; in short, said he, I wou'd not have it much better than a barn—well! then, replied Jones, you shall have the handsomest barn in England.</NOTE> as it could do if it covered
nothing but a barn. The expence of building that church was 4500<HI>l.</HI>
Ambresbury in Wiltshire was designed by him, but executed by his
scholar Webb, who married a cousin-german of Jones. Chevening is
another house ascribed to him, but doubtfull; Gunnersbury near Brent∣ford
was certainly his; the portico is too large, and engrosses the whole
<PB N="176" REF="205"/>
front except a single window at each end. The stair-case and salon are
noble, but destroy the rest of the house; the other chambers are small,
and crouded by vast chimney-pieces, placed with an Italian negligence
in any corner of the room. Lindsey-house <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jones was one of the first that observed the same gradual diminution of pi∣lasters as in pillars. Lindsey-house owes it's chief grace to this singularity.</NOTE> in Lincoln's-inn-fields
has a chaster front, but is not better disposed for the apartments. In
1618 a special commission was issued to the Lord Chancellor, the Earls
of Worcester, Pembroke, Arundel, and others, to plant, and reduce to
uniformity Lincoln's inn-fields, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That square is laid out with a regard to so trifling a circumstance, as to be of the exact dimensions of one of the pyramids. This would have been admired in those ages, when the keep at Kenelworth-castle was erected in the form of a horse-fetter, and the Escurial in the shape of St. Laurence's gridiron.</NOTE> as it shall be drawn by way of map
or ground-plot, by Inigo Jones, surveyor general of the works. Cole∣shill,
in Berkshire, the seat of Sir Matthew Pleydell, built in 1650,
and Cobham-hall in Kent, were his; He was employed to rebuild
Castle-Ashby, and finished one front, but the civil war interrupted his
progress, there and at Stoke-park in Northamptonshire. Shaftsbury-house,
now the London-lying-in hospital, on the east side of Alders∣gate-street,
is a beautifull front; at Wing, seven miles from his present
seat at Ethorp, in Buckinghamshire, Sir William Stanhope pulled
down a house built by Inigo. The front to the garden of Hinton St.
George in Somersetshire, the seat of Earl Poulet; and the front of
Brympton, formerly the mansion of Sir Philip Sydenham, were from
designs of Jones; as Chilham-castle, and the tower of the church at
Staines, where Inigo sometime lived, are said to be. So is a very cu∣rious
work, if really by him, as I know no other performance of his in
that kind, a bridge at Gwydder in Wales, on the estate of the Duke of
<PB N="177" REF="206"/>
Ancaster. Some alterations and additions he made at Sion. At
Oatlands remains a gate of the old palace, but removed to a little dis∣tance,
and repaired, with the addition of an inscription, by the present
Earl of Lincoln. The Grange, the seat of the Lord Chancellor
Henley in Hampshire, is entirely of this master. It is not a large
house, but by far one of the best proofs of his taste. The hall which
opens to a small vestibule with a cupola, and the staircase adjoining,
are beautifull models of the purest and most classic antiquity. The
gate of Beaufort-garden at Chelsea, designed by Jones, was purchased
by Lord Burlington and transported to Chiswick, where in a temple
are some wooden seats with lions and other animals for arms, not of
his most delicate imagination, brought from Tart-hall. He drew a
plan for a palace at Newmarket, but not that wretched hovel that
stands there at present. The last, and one of the most beautifull of
his works, that I shall mention, is the Queen's house at Greenwich.
The first idea of the hospital is said to have been taken by Webb from
his papers. The rest of his designs, and his smaller works, as chim∣nies
and cielings, &amp;c. may be seen in the editions of Kent, Ware, Var∣dy,
and Campbell.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke of Oxford had Jones's Palladio with his own notes and
observations in Italian, which the doctor bequeathed to Worcester col∣lege.
The Duke of Devonshire has another with the notes in Latin.
Lord Burlington had a Vitruvius noted by him in the same manner.
The same Lord had his head by Dobson. At Houghton, it is by
Vandyck. Hollar engraved one of them. Villamena made a print of
him while he was in Italy. Among the Strassord papers there is a
letter from Lord Cottington to the Lord deputy sending him a memo∣rial
from Inigo, relating to the procurement of marble from Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="207"/>
Inigo tasted early of the misfortunes of his master: He was not
only a favorite <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vanderdort's catalogue is mention of a picture of Stenwyck bought by Inigo for the King, p. 15, and of a waxen picture of Henry VIII. and a drawing of Prince Henry presented by him, p. 75.</NOTE> but a Roman catholic. In 1646 he paid 545<HI>l.</HI> for
his delinquency and sequestration. Whether it was before or after
this fine I know not, that he and Stone buried their joint stock of ready
money in Scotland-yard; but an order being published to encourage
the informers of such concealments, and four persons being privy to
the spot where the money was hid, it was taken up and reburied in
Lambeth-marsh.</P>
<P>Grief, misfortunes. and age, terminated his life. He died at Somer∣set-house
July 21, 1651, and on the 26th of the same month was bu∣ried
in the church of St. Bennet's Paul's-wharf, where a monument <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the frame of his picture, when bought by Sir Robert Walpole, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ermine and ermine, a lion rampant, or, within a border <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the same.</NOTE>

<P>I here conclude this long chapter on the reign of King Charles.
The admirers of that Prince will not think, I hope, that I have stinted
them in anecdotes of their favorite monarch.</P>

<P>OF these the first in rank, if not in merit, was</P>
<P>GENERAL LAMBERT,</P>
<P>who, we are told by the author of the English School, was a great en∣courager
of painting and a good performer in flowers; some of his
works were at the Duke of Leeds's at Wimbleton; and it was suppo∣sed
that he received instructions from Baptist Gaspars, whom he re∣tained
in his service. The General's son John Lambert painted por∣traits.
There is a medal of the General by Simon.</P>
<P>ROBERT WALKER,</P>
<P>a portrait-painter, cotemporary with Vandyck, but most remarkable
for being the principal painter employed by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a capital half length of General Moncke at the Countess of Mon∣trath's Twickenham park. I do not know the painter, but probably it was Walker.</NOTE> Cromwell, whose picture

he drew more than once. One of those portraits represented him with
a gold chain about his neck, to which was appendent a gold medal
with three crowns, the arms of Sweden and a pearl; sent to him by
Christina in return for his picture by Cooper, on which Milton wrote
a Latin epigram. This head by Walker is in the possession of Lord
Mountford at Horseth in Cambridgeshire, and was given to the late
Lord by Mr. Commissary Greaves, who found it in an Inn in that
County. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another is at the Earl of Essex's at Cashiobury.</NOTE> Another piece contained Cromwell and Lambert together:
This was in Lord Bradford's collection. A third was purchased for
the Great Duke, whose agent having orders to procure one, and meet∣ing
with this in the hands of a female relation of the protector, offer∣ed
to purchase it; but being refused, and continuing his sollicitation,
to put him off, she asked 500<HI>l.</HI>—and was paid it. It was on one of
these portraits that Elsum wrote his epigram, which is no better than
the rest.<Q><L>By lines o'th face and language of the eye,</L>

<P>From one of R. Symondes's pocket books in which he has set down
many directions in painting that had been communicated to him by
various artists, he mentions some from Walker, and says, the latter re∣ceived
ten pounds for the portrait of Mr. Thomas Knight's wife to the
knees; that she sat thrice to him, four or five hours at a time. That
for two half lengths of philosophers, which he drew from poor old
men, he had ten pounds each in 1652; that he paid twenty five
pounds for the Venus putting on her smock (by Titian) which was the
King's, and valued it at sixty-pounds, as he was told by Mrs. Board∣man,

and that Walker copied Titian's famous Venus, which was purchased
by the Spanish Embassador, and for which the King had been offered
2500<HI>l.</HI> He adds, Walker cries up De Critz for the best painter in
London.</P>
<P>Walker had for some time an apartment in Arundel-house and died
a little before the restoration; his own <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a good print of Walker, holding a drawing, by Lombart.</NOTE> portrait is at Leicester-house,
and in the picture-gallery at Oxford. Mr. Onslow has a fine whole
length, sitting in a chair, of Keble keeper of the great seal in 1650 by
this painter.</P>
<P>EDWARD MASCALL</P>
<P>drew another portrait of Cromwell, which the Duke of Chandos
bought of one Clark, then of the age of 106, but hearty and strong,
who had been summoned to London on a cause of Lord Coningsby.
This man had formerly been servant of Mascall and had married his
widow, and was at that time possessed of 300<HI>l.</HI> a year at Trewellin in
Herefordshire. He had several pictures painted by Mascall. Of the
latter there is an indifferent print, inscribed, Effigies Edwardi Mascall,

<P>Whereas, our most deare and royall father, Kinge James,
of blessed memory, having bene, divers yeares since, informed of the
great prejudice and daily losse which his loveing subjects did susteyne,
by the use of private and unwarranted farthing tokens of lead, brasse
and other mettale, which divers vintners, victuallers, tapsters, chaund∣lers,
bakers and other inferior tradesmen, were then wont to obtrude
and putt upon their chapmen and customers in the buying and selling
of small commodities; And finding in his royall wisdom that, besides
the inconvenience and losse that these tokens brought with them to the
poorer sort of people, the use of them was not without some wrong to
his royall prerogative, which ought not only to authorize all sorts of
coyne, but whatsoever else in the nature of coyne should serve as the
measure of buying and selling; Out of these considerations, which
were for the preservation of his Majesties own honour and the good
and benefitt of his loveing subjects, itt pleased his Majesty thereupon
to appoynt and ordeyne, by lettres patents under his great seale of
England, that a convenient quantity of one uniforme sort of farthinge
tokens should be exactly and artificially made in copper, with his Ma∣jesties
name and title thereupon, to be stamped, to be publiquely used,
and to passe betweene man and man for farthings, and did settle and
<PB REF="222"/>
establish a rechange of them into money, whereby the poorer sort of
people might buy and sell with more conveniencie, and the subject in
generall receive ease without losse;</P>
<P>Nowe,</P>

rechange of those farthing tokens of copper into money, soe

of single money, both for charity to the poore and for the more easie
tradeing in pettie commodities,</P>
<P>We have thought fitt to contynue and establishe the use thereof by
like letters patents, for the residue of the terme which our said royall
father was pleased to graunt in that behalfe, in such manner as is here∣after

dis que ie nestois nullement d'avis de bouger de la Haye ou des envi∣rons,
et fis response au dict Sr. Rubens que ie luy avois envoyé un
passeport a sa requisition, en vertu duquel il pouvoist sans auqune diffi∣culté
ce transporter luy et ses valets, en telle plasse de la Hollande qu'il
luy plaisait, que s'il faisoit difficulté de venir a la Haye, ie lirois trouver

quil escript a Mons. L' Abé de Scagliá, protestant que ceste resolution
avoist esté prise pour le bien de l'affaire, ce qu'il m'eust tres particuli∣erement
faict entendre. Quelque jours appres il arriva a Delf qui etoist
le 11/21 du mois de Juillet, où il m'a representé que si Don Diego
Messias qui est encore a Paris n'eust tardé si long temps il n'eust pas∣desiré
de me veoir avant son arrivée parce que L' Infante attandant par
luy tout ordre ne sçavoit que dire, mais craignant que l' Engleterre
prinst quelque ombrage de la longeur d'Espagne, elle lavoist envoyé
pour m'asseurer de son integritté de son Zelle, et sincere intention.
En un mot pour faire cognoistre que les ordres eussent estes plustost
envoyés si l'Espagne n'eust pris c'este resolution d'envoyer Don Diego
Messia lequel a ce quil dist a faict telle diligence qu'il est party le
lendemain de ces fiançailles, le dict Don Diego aiant aussi tardé plus
long temps par les chemains pour raison d'une fievure tierce laquelle
le tient encore a Paris. la seconde raison pourquoy ils avoyent envoyé

a la concurence des estats, et si l'on avoist meditté sur les expedients
necessaires, pour facilliter les affaires, ou les plus grandes difficultes
et obstacles ce rencontreroient en celles de Hollande, Que l'Espagne
avoist escript en ces termes. Vous continuerez de traitter avec Gerbier
jusques a ce que Don Diego vienne, non seulement d'un acomodement
entre l'Espagne et l'Engletere, mais aussi pour l'Alesmagne et
l'Hollande. Que l'Empereur mesme avoist escript tres exactement a
l'Infante que si auqúun traitté passoit par ces mains quil seroist tres
contant que les affaires d'Alesmagne s'acommodassent et qu'il tesmoig∣neroist
d'estre un Prince Chrestien. Le dict Rubens faisant des
grandes instances pour sçaveoir a quel expediants l'on avoist pensez,
<PB REF="251"/>
Je luy fis responsse que par l'escript qu' avoist esté envoyé le 9. de
mars, pour responsse de ceux que j'avois apportée de la part de l'In∣fante,
la Balle (comme dire) estoist mise a leur pietz, que c'estoist a
eux de parler, que le temps ne permet pas puis que nous ne voions
encore aultre certittude de leur part que parolles, de faire auqúune
ouverture, que bien estoist vray que Mons. Carleton se devoist disposer
a faire tout debvoir, mais qu'il nestoist possible d'avancer l'affaire sens
que de la part d'Espagne, l'on ne vist des tesmoignages eficatieux, sur
quoy il me dict que la serenissime Infante sçavoit bien quil ne se pouvoist
rien faire sans les ordres requis et si long temps attendus, mais que son
voiage tendant a nous asseurer de la bonne intention, et nous leuer de
toutte doubte. seroist acompagné de quelque advancement si en atten∣dant
la venue de Don diego Messias il ce pouvoist trouver quelques
expediants pour donner lumiere a l'acheminement du traitté, et
quainssi il retourneroit avecque quelque fruict. Je luy dis que pour
corespondre aus asseurances qu'il apportoist de la bonne intention de
l'Infante. Que ie le pouvois asseurer de celle de sa Maj. Et puis
qu'il avoist maintenant licence de ce promener par les villes de Hol∣lande,
que j'avrois loisir de veoir Mons. Carleton lequel pouroist dire
son sentiment sur quelques expedians, de la part duquel ie luy ay dict
a son despart, qu'il sesvertuera tant que sera possible, a meditter sur les
expediants necessaires et quen attandant qu'il avoist pensé a deux,
estant toutesfois dict par maniere de discours, scaveoir si pour l'Elec∣torat
il se pouvoist adjouster uné voix davantage au colege, et que le
survivant des deux succederoist, le second que dens lacommodement

confederation ratifiée il y a deux ans, qu'il esperoist de trouver jour,
estant son intention de la proposer au roy a mon retour, lors que le
dict Sr. Rubens feroist veoir ce que Don Diego Messias apporteroist.
Il a promis qu'il feroist toutte diligence, et sur ce ay esté obligé
d'attendre de ces premieres nouvelles, par advis de Mons. Carleton.
J'ay faict entendre au dict Rub. la ligue que le roy de France pretend
de faire avecq les Princes catholiques d'Alesmagne. L'argent quelle
a promis de fournir aux estats sur les premieres nouvelles quelle aura
que l'armes des estats aura assiegeé quelque plasse, de sortte que Mons.
Rubens avecq plusieurs aultres discours qu'avons eu ensemble sur la
raison d'Estast que le roy d'Espagne devroit plustost aveoir de souffeir
un Prince de la relision en Alesmagne, sen est allé avecq la puce a
l'Oreille esperant a la venue de Don Diego Messias, comme a un
Messie. Les protestations qu'ils font, et la necessite qui les semble
presser donne de l'aparence, si ce nest que l'Espagne trompe mesme
l'Infante. ce que ce cognoistra bien tost, car Rubens a promis que s'il
s'apercevoit de telle chose il en adverteroist promtement.</P>
<P>J'avois faict mention en ma premiere lettre, que l'on pouvoist aise∣ment
remarquer que plusieurs de ca pa'ys panchoient du costé de la

de ceste rupture entre la France et l'Engleterre. Je m'estois advise

Scaglia, Il a adioutté ce qu'il a creu estre convenable et utille, L'aiant

parmy ceux qui ont le plus de pouvoir et de sentiment en ce pa'ys
si telle estoist la volonte de sa Maj. c'est pourquoy ie l'envoye icy jointe,
vous suppliant den dire vostre sentiment.</P>
<P>L'Ambass. de Savoye m'a dict que les desputés des estats ont estes
invistez et porttez escripre en France, touchant l'interest qu'ils ont de
la mauvaise inteligence de ces deux couronnes. Que pourtant ils prient
sa Maj. doublier les offences receves et de vouloir suspendre les actes
d'hostillité contre l'Engleterre, representant particulierement que ce
desordre portte la ruinne de cest estats. Laquelle lettre a esté faictte
par l'artifice du Cardinal de Richelieu pour la faire inprimer a Paris,
affin que ceux de la relision de France voient que les actions d'Eng∣leterre
sont mesmes odieuses a ces amis, affin qu'ils croient qu'il y a
mesme de la desunion avecque ces estats, et faire paroistre qu'il a eu
raison de portter le roy son maistre a des animosites contre l'Engle∣terre,
puis que les estrangers mesmes cognoissent que la France par
elle a esté offencée.</P>
<P>Nonobstant ceste ditte lettre que l'on croist estre solicittée par Artsen
lequel s'est faict cognoistre du tout François en ceste conjuncture; Les
estats cognoisent bien que l'Engleterre ne peut pour ces interets, n'y
pour sa reputation permettre la pertte de la Rochelle, comme aussi
que la France aye grandes forces en Mer, et destre pour les mesmes
repects aussi bien interessez que l'Engleterre, qui donne assez de sub∣ject
de croire quil y a de la necessité de les pousser, n'y ayant pas de
doutte, quils suivroit tout a faict l'Engleterre en ce quelle vousdroit
traitter d'une paix d'Espagne, estants hors de toutte sortte despoir
d'assistance de la France, et font bien veoir le sentiment qu'ils en ont
s'aiant la province d'Hollande esvertuée de fournir deux millions de

livres, plus que par le passé pour suppleter a ce que la France manque.
Le S<SUP>r</SUP>. Rubens a veu lettres escriptes de France a l'Infante et Marquis
Spignola lesquelles sont dressées par le Cardinal de Richelieu, disant
lors que Mons. de Montagu parloit au Duc de Savoye touchant les
affaires de la France, et l'Engleterre, que l'Ambassadeur de France la
resident estoist caché derriere la tapisserie pour ovir tout ce que ce disoit,
ceste fourbe estant controuvée pour faire croire que la France est re∣cherchée
par l'Engleterre et que mesmes la France est si esloignée de
vouloir acommodement que ces ministres ne veulent pas paroistre ou
sont ceux d'Engleterre, pour traitter avecques eux.</P>
<P>Le Cardinal de Richelieu aiant ombrage du voiage de Messias, se
disant en France que c'est pour traitter avecq l'Engleterre, il a faict
promtement escripre une lettre a Artsen, si tost que l'armée des estats
assiegeroient une plasse de l'ennemy que la France leur fera tenir cinq
cents mille livres, esperant par ce moien et par les 60/m livres qu'ils ont
fourny au roy de Dennemarque d'apportter lenpeschement a l'acom∣modement
des affaires entre l'Espagne et l'Engleterre, cest un argu∣ment
que la France ne faict rien de bon que par crainte et quand elle
est forcée. Le bien qu' a desia aportté le bruict de quelque traitté
avecque l'Espagne, maxime certain que l'entretien en est bon.</P>
<P>Les Lettres de Paris du 25 font mention d'une soulevation qu'il y a
eu dens Bourdeaux n'aiants voulu accepter les nouveux edits. Ceux
de Bourdeaux n'ont aussi voulu publier la desfence du commerce
avecque l'Engleterre. Mons. L' Abé de Scaglia m'a induit descrire
qu'il seroist d'avis en ceste disposition de leur faire sçaveoir de les vou∣loir
traitter en amis, a condition qu'ils soient obliger d'assister ce que
le roy de la grand Bretagne entreprendra a leur advantage. Monsieur
<PB REF="255"/>
de Rohan a faict responsse au roy par son agent que le roy luy avoit
envoyé pour tirer promesse de luy qu'il n'eust pas a ce remùer, Il a
respondu qu'il se fera recognoistre bon serviteur du roy pourveu que la
Rochelle soit remise en toutte sortte de libertté, ce que faict cognoistre
au roy que la deliberation des armes que Mons. de Rohan prend, est
avecque le consentment des Eglises de France. Il a fait retirer Madâme
de Rohan a Geneve, et sen va en Italie affin que personne ne soupsonne
quelle sollicette le roy pour son mary.</P>
<P>La Rochelle avoist faict pendre quelques uns qui avoient voulu
persuader le peuple de s'unir avecque le roy.</P>
<P>Mons. de Guise est tres mal satisfaict pour le commendement donné
a Mons. d'Angoulesme. Il estoist party vers Poittoù environ quattre
ou cinq mille hommes et doibt estre la a la fin du mois de Juillet. Je
ne puis obmettre de faire recitt de la bonne repartie que Mons. L'Abé
de Scaglia a faict a l'Embassadeur de France et celuy de Venise issi
resident, lesquelles pressoient fort qu'il ce devoist entremettre en un
acommodement, qu'il falloit procurer que la France vint a une suspen∣tion
d'armes, sur quoy L' Abé de Scaglia demende si la France avoist
des piques longues de Calais a Douure, car pour d'aultres armes il
n'en cognoissoit pas.</P>
<P>Jay representé a Mons. de Scaglia ce que Mons. Canoué m'a com∣mandè
de la part du roy, le dict Scaglia m'a faict veoir en mesme
temps ce quil escrivoit a son Altetze touchant les affaires, pour le tenir
tousiours disposé au dessain de sa Maj. et dy engager ces amis, ce qu'il
avoit recommendé avecque toute l'ardeur que l'on pouvoist sonhaister.
Pour ce que regarde le voyage du Baron de Puseol, il attend responsse
d'un jour a aultre, de tout ce que l'on peut desirer de sa negotiation,
<PB REF="256"/>
estant party d'icy avecque touttes les instructions et mesmoires neces∣saires,
il ne doutte quil n'aye bien servy. Pour les affaires de
Geneve il a dict a Mons. de Montagù en ma presence comme il
poura asseurer son Altesse de tout ce que le roy luy a ordonné et de
plus que sa Maj. est authourdhuy au point de rendre si grand servisse
a ceux de son party en France qu'il luy donnera tant plus d'advantage
et d'authoritté parmy ceux de Geneve et ailleurs que l'on pouvoist at∣tendre
quelque bon succes. L'Abe de Scaglia s'asseurant que son
Maistre le trouvera bon, Monsieur de Montagu s'en va bien instruit de
ce qu'il aura a saire avecq Soissons, particullierement sur l'ocasion de
la Maladie du roy, laquelle enpirant pouroist bien changer beaucoup
de choses, aultrement s'il tombe en fievure cartte comme l'on dict desia,
cela fortifiera les mal contents de France, et donnera toutte sortte
d'advantage a ceux qui en sçavront profitter, et quelque sortte de
minne qu'ils fassent ils sont a present bien enpeschez, car indubitable∣ment,
yl y aura beaucoup de brouilliers dens touttes le provinces de la
France qui les rendront inutilles au roy pour le secours qu'il en pou∣voist
aveoir tiré, jusques a tant que l'on soit en estast de faire d'avan∣tage,
comme Mons. de Scaglia croit que sera si les affaires de Savoye
et de Genes sachevent.</P>
<P>L'Abe de Scaglia avroist desiré de passer au plustost en Engleterre
vers sa Maj. mais est en ce point qu'il attend quelque responsse de
Madame de Soissons, il desire de pouvoir conclure avecq Mons. de
Candalle qui luy a promis de s'unir avecq Mons. le Compte de Sois∣sons,
lequel n'attend qu'une responsse pour establir ceste affaire la,
mais il espere de partir dicy, au plus tard en quinse jours, ou trois se∣maines,
et desire que le vaisseau revienne envers le dict temps.</P>
<P><PB REF="257"/>
L'Ambass. de France a fort desiré de pouvoir escripre quelque chose
du retour de Mons. de Montagu, il s'est adresse a Mons. de Scaglia
lequel luy a faict des responses assez ridicules, en particulier luy a pro∣posé
de demander a Mons. Carleton, passeport pour asseurer les vais∣seaux
du roy de France qu'il voisdroit bien faire partir de ces ports.</P>
<P>J'avois touché en m'a precedente lettre comme l'Ambass. de Venice
et l'Agent de Florence residant en Engleterre sont personnes qui inter∣prettent
en mal tout ce qui ce faisoit en Engleterre, donnent les advis
aux ennemis de la couronne, et estoient personnes dangereuses, en aiant
souvent ouy des estranges raports. Mons. de Scaglia dict sur cela,
qu'il faut veoir de mettre l'affaire tout bellement en tel estast que l'on
aye a parler sens portter prejudice a l'Ambass. de Venice qui est en
France parce que les principalles choses que Mons. L'Abé de Scaglia
a scù, il les a de celuy de Paris, lequel est maintenant suspect a celuy
d'Engleterre.</P>
<P>Mais touchant cest agent de Florence qui est a Londres, Le Sr.
Vertselin m'a souvent donné des advis pour les dire a Mons. le Duc.
ne pouvant le dict Vertselin souffrir les malices lesquelles il faisoist
paroistre. Et j'ay remarqué selon les paroles que le dict Vertselin m'a
dittes que sens doubte cest agent de Florence a faict ce petit livret
intittullé la cronique des favorits, et dedie a Mons. le Duc de Buck∣ingham,
dens lequel ie trouve les mesmes termes que le Vertselin m'a
raconté. Mons. de Scaglia m'a faict tenir le livret que japortteray
quand et moy, sa Maj. m'aiant faict l'honneur de me commander par
le secretaire Canové d'en faire raport, a qui j'ay aussi escript un peu

Authourdhuy sont venues les lettres de France vielles de 10 jours.
Le roy est encore a Villeroy fort mal. sa fievure est double tierce,
avecque laccident de la dissanterie le rend en tres mauvais estast,
les astrologues disant sa fin, toutes les affaires cessent et plusieurs tant
dehors que dedans sont aux atentes; il fust dict au roy que le Cardinal
de Richelieu lavoit servy avecque beaucoup de passion, il dict ces mots,
il est vray ie le sçay bien, mais le peuple se plaint fort.</P>
<P>Ils ont taché dacepter le gouvernement de Grandmont, mais il la

si quelque mal arivoit.</P>
<P>Monsieur d'Angoulesme a este commendé de s'arester a Nior qui

Boulogne et quartiers sircomvoisins pour les envoyer a Mons. d'An∣goulesme.
Madame la Contesse de Soissons a mandé que le mariage
luv plaist mais dict a Mons. de Scaglia quelle ne peut resoudre que
jusques a ce que ceste maladie du roy prenne fin.</P>
<P>L'Ambassadeur de Savoye a escript par homme expres la necessite

durant la maladie du roy.</P>
<P>Don Diego Messias est fort malade a Paris d'une fievre tierce, Je
crains fort un prolonguement aux affaires, par ceste maladie.</P>
<P>Monsieur de Crecy aiant mande un courier pour faire sçaveoir au
