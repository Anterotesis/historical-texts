<Q><L>Sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis</L>

<Q><L>So water trembling in a polish'd vase,</L>
<L>Reflects the beam that plays upon its face,</L>
<L>The sportive light, uncertain where it falls,</L>
<L>Now strikes the roof, now flashes on the walls.</L></Q>
<Q>Nous sommes nés pour la vérité, et nous ne pouvons souffrir son
abord. les figures, les paraboles, les emblémes. sont toujours
des ornements nécessaires pour qu'elle puisse s'annoncer. et soit
quon craigne qu'elle ne découvre trop brusquement le défaut
qu'on voudroit cacher, ou qu'enfin elle n'instruise avec trop
peu de ménagement, ou veut, en la recevant, qu'elle soit
déguisée. <BIBL>CARACCIOLI.</BIBL></Q>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>YOU told me, I remember, glory built</L>
<L>On selfish principles, is shame and guilt.</L>
<L>The deeds that men admire as half divine,</L>
<L>Stark naught, because corrupt in their design.</L>
<L>Strange doctrine this! that without scruple tears</L>
<L>The laurel that the very light'ning spares,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Brings down the warrior's trophy to the dust,</L>
<L>And eats into his bloody sword like rust.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<L>I grant, that men continuing what they are,</L>
<L>Fierce, avaricious, proud, there must be war.</L>
<L>And never meant the rule should be applied</L>
<L>To him that fights with justice on his side.</L>
<L>Let laurels, drench'd in pure Parnassian dews,</L>
<L>Reward his mem'ry, dear to ev'ry muse,</L>
<L>Who, with a courage of unshaken root,</L>
<L>In honour's field advancing his firm foot,</L>
<L>Plants it upon the line that justice draws,</L>
<L>And will prevail or perish in her cause.</L>
<L>Tis to the virtues of such men, man owes</L>
<L>His portion in the good that heav'n bestows,</L>
<L>And when recording history displays</L>
<L>Feats of renown, though wrought in antient days,</L>
<L>Tells of a few stout hearts that fought and dy'd</L>
<L>Where duty plac'd them, at their country's side,</L>
<L>The man that is not mov'd with what he reads,</L>
<L>That takes not fire at their heroic deeds,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
Unworthy of the blessings of the brave,</L>
<L>Is base in kind, and born to be a slave.</L>
<L>But let eternal infamy pursue</L>
<L>The wretch to naught but his ambition true,</L>
<L>Who, for the sake of filling with one blast</L>
<L>The post horns of all Europe, lays her waste.</L>
<L>Think yourself station'd on a tow'ring rock,</L>
<L>To see a people scatter'd like a flock,</L>
<L>Some royal mastiff panting at their heels,</L>
<L>With all the savage thirst a tyger feels,</L>
<L>Then view him self-proclaim'd in a gazette,</L>
<L>Chief monster that has plagu'd the nations yet,</L>
<L>The globe and sceptre in such hands misplac'd,</L>
<L>Those ensigns of dominion, how disgrac'd!</L>
<L>The glass that bids man mark the fleeting hour,</L>
<L>And death's own scythe would better speak his pow'r,</L>
<L>Then grace the boney phantom in their stead</L>
<L>With the king's shoulder knot and gay cockade,</L>
<L>Cloath the twin brethren in each other's dress,</L>
<L>The same their occupation and success.</L>

<L>'Tis your belief the world was made for man,</L>
<L>Kings do but reason on the self same plan,</L>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<L>Seldom, alas! the power of logic reigns</L>
<L>With much sufficiency in royal brains.</L>
<L>Such reas'ning falls like an inverted cone,</L>
<L>Wanting its proper base to stand upon.</L>
<L>Man made for kings! those optics are but dim</L>
<L>That tell you so—say rather, they for him.</L>
<L>That were indeed a king-enobling thought,</L>
<L>Could they, or would they, reason as they ought.</L>
<L>The diadem with mighty projects lin'd,</L>
<L>To catch renown by ruining mankind,</L>
<L>Is worth, with all its gold and glitt'ring store,</L>
<L>Just what the toy will sell for and no more.</L>
<L>Oh! bright occasions of dispensing good,</L>
<L>How seldom used, how little understood!</L>
<L>To pour in virtue's lap her just reward,</L>
<L>Keep vice restrain'd behind a double guard,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>
To quell the faction that affronts the throne,</L>
<L>By silent magnanimity alone;</L>
<L>To nurse with tender care the thriving arts,</L>
<L>Watch every beam philosophy imparts;</L>
<L>To give religion her unbridl'd scope,</L>
<L>Nor judge by statute a believer's hope;</L>
<L>With close fidelity and love unfeign'd,</L>
<L>To keep the matrimonial bond unstain'd;</L>
<L>Covetous only of a virtuous praise,</L>
<L>His life a lesson to the land he sways;</L>
<L>To touch the sword with conscientious awe,</L>
<L>Nor draw it but when duty bids him draw,</L>
<L>To sheath it in the peace-restoring close,</L>
<L>With joy, beyond what victory bestows,</L>
<L>Blest country! where these kingly glories shine,</L>
<L>Blest England! if this happiness be thine.</L>

<L>Guard what you say, the patriotic tribe</L>
<L>Will sneer and charge you with a bribe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<L>A bribe?</L>
<L>The worth of his three kingdoms I defy,</L>
<L>To lure me to the baseness of a lie.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
And of all lies (be that one poet's boast)</L>
<L>The lie that flatters I abhor the most.</L>
<L>Those arts be their's that hate his gentle reign,</L>
<L>But he that loves him has no need to feign.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your smooth eulogium to one crown address'd,</L>
<L>Seems to imply a censure on the rest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<L>Quevedo, as he tells his sober tale,</L>
<L>Ask'd, when in hell, to see the royal jail,</L>
<L>Approv'd their method in all other things,</L>
<L>But where, good Sir, do you confine your kings?</L>
<L>There—said his guide, the groupe is full in view.</L>
<L>Indeed? Replied the Don—there are but few.</L>
<L>His black interpreter the charge disdain'd—</L>
<L>Few, fellow? There are all that ever reign'd.</L>
<L>Wit undistinguishing is apt to strike</L>
<L>The guilty and not guilty, both alike.</L>
<L>I grant the sarcasm is too severe,</L>

<L>King's then at last have but the lot of all,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<L>True. While they live, the courtly laureat pays</L>
<L>His quit-rent ode, his pepper-corn of praise,</L>
<L>And many a dunce whose fingers itch to write,</L>
<L>Adds, as he can, his tributary mite;</L>
<L>A subject's faults, a subject may proclaim,</L>
<L>A monarch's errors are forbidden game.</L>
<L>Thus free from censure, over-aw'd by fear,</L>
<L>And prais'd for virtues that they scorn to wear,</L>
<L>The fleeting forms of majesty engage</L>
<L>Respect, while stalking o'er life's narrow stage,</L>
<L>Then leave their crimes for history to scan,</L>
<L>And ask with busy scorn, Was this the man?</L>
<L>I pity kings whom worship waits upon</L>
<L>Obsequious, from the cradle to the throne,</L>
<L>Before whose infant eyes the flatt'rer bows,</L>
<L>And binds a wreath about their baby brows.</L>
<L>Whom education stiffen'd into state,</L>
<L>And death awakens from that dream too late.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
Oh! is servility with supple knees,</L>
<L>Whose trade it is to smile, to crouch, to please;</L>

<L>Is smiling peeresses and simp'ring peers,</L>

With all their flippant fluency of tongue,</L>
<L>Most confident, when palpably most wrong,</L>

<L>But to be rudely censur'd when they fail,</L>
<L>To doubt the love his fav'rites may pretend,</L>
<L>And in reality to find no friend,</L>

<L>Thus men whose thoughts contemplative have
dwelt,</L>

<L>The cause, tho' worth the search, may yet elude</L>

<L>Who seek it in his climate and his frame.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
Lib'ral in all things else, yet nature here</L>
<L>With stern severity deals out the year.</L>
<L>Winter invades the spring, and often pours</L>
<L>A chilling flood on summer's drooping flow'rs,</L>
<L>Unwelcome vapors quench autumnal beams,</L>
<L>Ungenial blasts attending, curl the streams,</L>
<L>The peasants urge their harvest, plie the fork</L>
<L>With double toil, and shiver at their work,</L>
<L>Thus with a rigor, for his good design'd,</L>
<L>She rears her fav'rite man of all mankind.</L>
<L>His form robust and of elastic tone,</L>
<L>Proportion'd well, half muscle and half bone,</L>
<L>Supplies with warm activity and force</L>
<L>A mind well lodg'd, and masculine of course.</L>
<L>Hence liberty, sweet liberty inspires,</L>
<L>And keeps alive his fierce but noble fires.</L>
<L>Patient of constitutional controul,</L>
<L>He bears it with meek manliness of soul,</L>
<L>But if authority grow wanton, woe</L>
<L>To him that treads upon his free-born toe,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="16"/>
One step beyond the bound'ry of the laws</L>
<L>Fires him at once in freedom's glorious cause.</L>
<L>Thus proud prerogative, not much rever'd,</L>
<L>Is seldom felt, though sometimes seen and heard;</L>
<L>And in his cage, like parrot fine and gay,</L>
<L>Is kept to strut, look big, and talk away.</L>
<L>Born in a climate softer far than our's,</L>

<L>Give him his lass, his fiddle and his frisk,</L>

<L>And feasting on an onion and a crust,</L>
<L>We never feel th' alacrity and joy</L>
<L>With which he shouts and carols, <HI>Vive le Roy,</HI></L>
<L>Fill'd with as much true merriment and glee,</L>

<L>The soul, emancipated, unoppress'd,</L>

Philosophy without his heav'nly guide,</L>

<L>And land some grave optician on the shore,</L>
<L>He claps his lens, if haply they may see,</L>

But all he gains for his harangue is—Well—</L>
<L>What monstrous lies some travellers will tell.</L>
<L>The soul whose sight all-quick'ning grace renews,</L>
<L>Takes the resemblance of the good she views,</L>
<L>As di'monds stript of their opaque disguise,</L>
<L>Reflect the noon-day glory of the skies.</L>
<L>She speaks of him, her author, guardian, friend,</L>
<L>Whose love knew no beginning, knows no end,</L>
<L>In language warm as all that love inspires,</L>
<L>And in the glow of her intense desires</L>
<L>Pants to communicate her noble fires.</L>
<L>She sees a world stark blind to what employs</L>
<L>Her eager thought, and feeds her flowing joys,</L>
<L>Though wisdom hail them, heedless of her call,</L>
<L>Flies to save some, and feels a pang for all:</L>
<L>Herself as weak as her support is strong,</L>
<L>She feels that frailty she denied so long,</L>
<L>And from a knowledge of her own disease,</L>

<L><PB N="201" REF="204"/>
Though scorn repay her sympathetic tears,</L>
<L>She still is kind, and still she perseveres;</L>
<L>The truth she loves, a sightless world blaspheme,</L>
<L>'Tis childish dotage, a delirious dream,</L>
<L>The danger they discern not, they deny,</L>
<L>Laugh at their only remedy, and die:</L>
<L>But still a soul thus touch'd, can never cease</L>
<L>Whoever threatens war to speak of peace,</L>
<L>Pure in her aim and in her temper mild,</L>
<L>Her wisdom seems the weakness of a child,</L>
<L>She makes excuses where she might condemn,</L>
<L>Reviled by those that hate her, prays for them;</L>
<L>Suspicion lurks not in her artless breast,</L>
<L>The worst suggested, she believes the best;</L>
<L>Not soon provoked, however stung and teaz'd,</L>
<L>And if perhaps made angry, soon appeas'd,</L>
<L>She rather waves than will dispute her right,</L>
<L>And injur'd, makes forgiveness her delight.</L>

<L>Some seek, when queazy conscience has its
qualms,</L>
<L>To lull the painful malady with alms;</L>
<L>But charity not feign'd, intends alone</L>
<L>Another's good—theirs centers in their own;</L>
<L>And too short-lived to reach the realms of peace,</L>

<HEAD>REPORT
Of an adjudged Case not to be found in any of the Books.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>BETWEEN Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,</L>
<L>The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;</L>
<L>The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,</L>
<L>To which the said spectacles ought to belong.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<PB N="316" REF="319"/>
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>So the Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause</L>
<L>With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning,</L>
<L>While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,</L>
<L>So fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,</L>
<L>And your lordship he said, will undoubtedly find,</L>
<L>That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,</L>
<L>Which amounts to possession time out of mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<L>Then holding the spectacles up to the court—</L>
<L>Your lordship observes they are made with a
straddle,</L>
<L>As wide as the ridge of the Nose is, in short,</L>
<L>Design'd to sit close to it, just like a saddle.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>Again would your lordship a moment suppose</L>
<L>('Tis a case that has happen'd and may be again)</L>
<L>That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,</L>
<L>Pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<PB N="317" REF="320"/>
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<L>On the whole it appears, and my argument shows</L>
<L>With a reasoning the court will never condemn,</L>
<L>That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,</L>
<L>And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<L>Then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how,</L>
<L>He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes,</L>
<L>But what were his arguments few people know,</L>
<L>For the court did not think they were equally
wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<L>So his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,</L>
<L>Decisive and clear without one if or but—</L>
<L>That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on</L>
<L>By day-light or candle-light—Eyes should be
shut.</L>

<L>O'erheard and check'd this idle talk.</L>
<L>And your fine sense, he said, and yours,</L>
<L>Whatever evil it endures,</L>
<L>Deserves not, if so soon offended,</L>
<L>Much to be pitied or commended.</L>
<L>Disputes though short, are far too long,</L>
<L>Where both alike are in the wrong;</L>
<L>Your feelings in their full amount,</L>
<L>Are all upon your own account.</L>
<L>You in your grotto-work inclos'd</L>
<L>Complain of being thus expos'd,</L>
<L>Yet nothing feel in that rough coat,</L>
<L>Save when the knife is at your throat,</L>
<L><PB N="365" REF="368"/>
Wherever driv'n by wind or tide,</L>
<L>Exempt from every ill beside.</L>
<L>And as for you, my Lady Squeamish,</L>
<L>Who reckon ev'ry touch a blemish,</L>
<L>If all the plants that can be found</L>
<L>Embellishing the scene around,</L>
<L>Should droop and wither where they grow,</L>
<L>You would not feel at all, not you.</L>
<L>The noblest minds their virtue prove</L>
<L>By pity, sympathy, and love,</L>
<L>These, these are feelings truly fine,</L>
<L>And prove their owner half divine.</L>
<L>His censure reach'd them as he dealt it,</L>
<L>And each by shrinking shew'd he felt it.</L>

<L>UNWIN, I should but ill repay,</L>
<L>The kindness of a friend,</L>
<L>Whose worth deserves as warm a lay</L>
<L>As ever friendship penn'd,</L>
<L>Thy name omitted in a page,</L>
<L>That would reclaim a vicious age.</L>

<L>An union form'd, as mine with thee,</L>
<L>Not rashly or in sport,</L>
<L>May be as fervent in degree,</L>
<L>And faithful in its sort,</L>
<L>And may as rich in comfort prove,</L>
<L>As that of true fraternal love.</L>

<L>Not rich, I render what I may,</L>
<L>I seize thy name in haste,</L>
<L>And place it in this first assay,</L>
<L>Lest this should prove the last.</L>
<L>'Tis where it should be, in a plan</L>
<L>That holds in view the good of man.</L>

<L>The poet's lyre, to fix his fame,</L>

<L>Affection lights a brighter flame</L>
<L>Than ever blaz'd by art.</L>
<L>No muses on these lines attend,</L>
<L>I sink the poet in the friend.</L>
