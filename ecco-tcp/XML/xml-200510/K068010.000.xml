But still that Lordly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reature, who should rule other Creatures,
<PB REF="4"/>
being wanting, he was framed more glorious than all the Creatures, as not made without mature Counsel and Deliberation and stam∣ped in the Divine Similitude, inspired with the infused Breath of Life, beyond what any other Creature durst to boast: The Contem∣plation of which, long since made the Royal Psalmist break out into this Rapture; <HI>What is Man that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of Man that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the Angels, and hast crowned him with Glory and Honour. Thou makest him to have Dominion over the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of thy Hands, and hast put all thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under his Feet.</HI> Psal. <HI>8.4, 4, 6.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, <HI>I say,</HI> when God had created the world and furnished it with whatsoever seemed good i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Sight, and that there was nothing wantin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for necessary use, Commodity and Pleasure, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seemed good to him then, to make one that migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use them to his Glory, and take delight in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joicing in them. Wherefore when Natures Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naments were all compleat, he brought Man in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the World, as into his own possession; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he might not be disconsolate, nor solitary gave him a Woman for a Helper and Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nion, infusing into them a Fource of Love, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="5"/>
Desire towards each other, and of procreating their Likeness; having prepared for that pur∣pose, a swelling Humour or Spirit, and organi∣cal Parts; and that the one through fear of neg∣lect, should not be induced to decline the Society of the other, he added Allurements and Desire of mutual Embracings, that so they might in Procreation be sweetly affected and delighted by wondrous Ways: For unless this was natural to all kind of Creatures, they would be regard∣less of Posterity, and Proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eation would cease, whereby Mankind would quickly be lost; and the Affairs of Mortals of no continuance. But that this passionate Desire might strongly operate, as well in sensual Felicity, as on the Imagina∣tion, God has firmly impressed it on all Crea∣tures subject thereto, both Male and Female, but more especially on Man. And lest it should prove unruly in him, and not easily subdued; he has thought it convenient to prescribe him Bounds, and confine him to the Vse of the Ma∣trimonial Bed; that so <HI>they</HI> might not defile themselves with wandring Lust, <HI>who</HI> want the <HI>Gift</HI> of <HI>Continency.</HI> Wherefore so soon as Copulation is finished, and the Woman hap∣pens to prove with Child, great is Nature's Cunning in furnishing the <HI>Embryo</HI> with con∣venient Nutriment, that at the set time, when Nine Months are run over, <HI>Man,</HI> that <HI>Ruler</HI> and <HI>Ornament</HI> of the <HI>Sublunary World,</HI> may

come forth; in relation to which Mystery of Generation Holy <HI>Job,</HI> in the Tenth Chapter of his Book, thus ex∣presses himself; <HI>Hast thou not poured me out as Milk, and curdled me like Cheese? Thou hast cloathed me with Skin and Flesh, and hast senced me with Bones and Sinews. Thou bast granted me Life and Favour, and thy Visitation hath pre∣served my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>But not to be too tedious upon this Subject, I shall proceed to unravel the <HI>Mistery</HI> of <HI>Generation,</HI> and di∣vers other <HI>Misteries:</HI> which I hope will be to the Satisfaction of the Learned and Ingenious of the Age, whose Discretion, I need not doubt, will keep them from wresting it to any other end than what it was designed for, <HI>viz.</HI> The Benefit and Advantage of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dest of either Sex, not desiring that this Book should fal into the Hands of any <HI>Obscene</HI> and <HI>Wanton Person.</HI> whose Folly or Malice may turn that into Ridicule, that loudly proclaims the Infinite Wisdom of an Omnipotent Creator, who by his mighty working is able to subdue all things to himself.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Marriage, and at what Age <HI>Virgins</HI> and <HI>Youths</HI> are capable of the Marriage-Bed, and the Reasons that prompts them to desire it, with the Signs of Barrenness, and how long a <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>VVoman</HI> are capable of having <HI>Children.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT Marriage is an Ho∣nourable State, ordain'd by God in Paradice, and since confirm'd by our Blessed Saviour, who wrought his first Miracle at a Wed∣ding, I hope no Body will deny. There∣fore it is convenient that PARENTS will take care of their Daughters Chastity;
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
and when they find them <HI>inclinable</HI> to Mar∣riage, not violently to restrain their Affecti∣ons, but rather to provide for them, if pos∣sible, such Husbands as may be for their Ad∣vantage, and with whom they may live comfortably in that blessed State, lest being crossed in their Purposes, and delayed, they part with their Honour dishonourable ways.</P>
<P>The propension and inclination of <HI>Maids</HI> to Marriage, is to be discovered by many Symptoms; For when they arrive to Maturity (which is usually about the 14th or 15th Year of their Age, according to their respe∣ctive Habits or Constitutions) then their <HI>Menses,</HI> or Natural Purgations begin to flow: and the <HI>Blood,</HI> which is no longer ta∣ken to augment their Bodies, abounding, incites their Minds and Imaginations to Venery. External Causes also may pro∣mote and excite them to it; for the Spirits being <HI>brisk,</HI> and in a manner <HI>inflamed</HI>▪ when they arrive at this Age, if they eat <HI>salt, sharp Things, Spices, &amp;c.</HI> whereby the Body be∣comes <HI>still more and more heated,</HI> then the <HI>In∣clination</HI> and <HI>Proneness</HI> to <HI>Venerial Embraces</HI> is very great: nay, sometimes almost inse∣parable. And a due use of these Enjoy∣ments being denied to Virgins, very often produces very <HI>dismal Effects,</HI> as green and Weasel-Colour, short Breathings, Trem∣blings of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if they hap∣pen
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
to be married to their own Content, those Afflictions vanish, and their Native Beauty returns more gay than before. Nor is their eager gazing, and desiring to associate themselves with Men a less Sign that Na∣ture <HI>prompts them</HI> to desire <HI>what she ordained</HI> their due; of which being sometimes by obdurate Parents debarr'd in a lawful Way, they break the Bounds of Modesty rather than endure such violent Agitations and Conflicts <HI>within themselves,</HI> and so satiate their Desires in unlawful Love. The same may in all particulars be observed in young brisk Widows. whom Death (that Enemy of sweet conjugal Love) has separated from the Bosom of their Husbands.</P>
<P>At 14 Years of Age, commonly the <HI>Menses</HI> in Virgins begin to flow, and their they are capable of conceiving, and so conti∣tinue generally to Forty-four; at what time for the most part they are no longer capable of Generation, unless such as are exceeding healthful, strong of Body, and have used themselves to Temperance, who have ap∣peared to be delivered of Children till 55 Years; but such Prodigies rarely happen, altho' the <HI>Menses</HI> continue longer in some Women than in others, but many times such Efflux proceeds not from any natural cause, but by reason of some violent Straining, or other Violence, and doth often endanger
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
the Life of the Party: And therefore <HI>Young Men</HI> that marry <HI>Women</HI> surmounting the Age aforesaid, if they expect Children un∣less by Miracle, must labour against the Wind: Though if an <HI>Old Man,</HI> that is not worn out by Diseases and Incontinency, marry a brisk lively Lass, there is hopes even to Threescore and Ten, and some that are extraordinary lusty, till Fourscore.</P>
<P><HI>Hypocrates,</HI> that Famous and Learned Physician, is of Opinion, that a <HI>Youth</HI> at 16 Years, or between that and 17, having much Vital Strength, may be capable of getting Children, and that Force and Heat of procreating Matter continually increases till 45, 50, and 65. And at the end of the latter begins to flag, the Seed by little and little becoming unfruitful, the natural Spi∣rits being extinguished, and the Humours dried up; and in general, most Physicians to this day do observe it; but as to parti∣culars, as I have before mentioned, it of∣ten hapneth otherwise; nay, 'tis reported by a credible Author, that in the Reign of <HI>Ere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> a Man was mar∣ried at an Hundred Years old to a Bride of Thirty, and had many Children by her; but looked so fresh, that such as knew him not, took him not to exceed that Age.</P>
<P>In <HI>Campania,</HI> where the Air is temperate, serene, and calm, <HI>Men</HI> of 80 Year usually
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
marry <HI>Young Virgins,</HI> and have Children by them; which argues that Age in <HI>Men</HI> hin∣ders not Procreation, unless they be exhau∣sted in their Youth, and their Members shrivelled up. If any ask why a <HI>Woman</HI> is sooner barren than a <HI>Man? I answer,</HI> The Cause is the natural Heat, which is more predominant in the latter than in the former: For since a <HI>Woman</HI> is more moist than a Man, as her Monthly Purgations do most evidently demonstrate, as also the softness of her Body; 'tis also apparent that he doth exceed her in native Heat; and as for that Heat, it is the chief thing that concocts the Humours into good and proper Aliment; which the <HI>Woman</HI> want∣ing, grows fat; when a <HI>Man,</HI> by reason of that Heat, melts his Fat by Degrees and his Humours are dissolved, and by the Be∣nefit thereof they are elaborated into Seed. And this may, for the better confirmation of what I propose, be added, That the <HI>Woman</HI> generally is not so strong as a <HI>Man,</HI> nor so wise and ingenious in contriving her Affairs, whereby the Faculties are hin∣der'd in their Operation. And so I con∣clude my Assertion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. General and Particular Rules laid down by Learned Physicians▪ how to proceed in getting a Male, or Female Child, and of the <HI>Em∣bryo</HI> and perfect Birth, and the fittest Season for Copulation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a young likely Couple have entered the holy State of Wedlock, and are desirous of mutual Enjoyment for Generation-sake, which is the chief end for which Wedlock was ordained, and rather covet to be bless'd with one Sex than ano∣ther, let them know fitst for certain, that the success of <HI>such things</HI> depends upon Di∣vine Providence tho' secondary Causes must be <HI>active</HI> and <HI>instrumental</HI> therein, and those are especially two; <HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Genital Hu∣mour,</HI> which is brought by the <HI>Arteriae Prae∣parantes</HI> to the <HI>Testes</HI> in the Form of Blood, and there elaborated into Seed by the <HI>Semi∣nifical Faculty</HI> resident in them. To which may be added the Appetite and Desire to Copulation, which fires the Imagination with unusual Fancies, or by the sight of a brisk, charming Beauty, whose Wit and Liveliness may much intice, and more in∣flame the Courage; But if Nature be en∣feebled, then are there fit Artificial Reme∣dies to restore it, <HI>viz.</HI> Such Meats as most
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
conduce to the affording such Aliment as proves to make Seed abound, and restore the Decays of Nature, that the Faculties may freely operate: For as dung and good muturing restores Ground that is worn out, and heartless, even so seasonable and pro∣per Diet operates to the restoring the faint Heart, weak Spirit, coldness and driness of the Genital parts, and reduceth the weakness of the Nerves to their Tempera∣ment, and removes Impediments, obstruct∣ing the Procreation of Children. Then since Diet may and will after the evil state of the Body to a better, it is necessary that such as are subject to Barrenness, should eat such Meats only as tend to render them fruitful; and among such things as are inducing and stirring up thereto, are all Meats of good Juice, that nourish well, and make the Body lively and full of Sap, of which faculty are all hot moist Meats: for according to <HI>Galen,</HI> the substance of Seed is made of the pure con∣cocted and windy superfluity of Blood; from whence we may conclude there is in many things a power to accumulate or heap up Seed, as also to augment it, and other things of force to cause Erection, as Hen-Eggs, Pheasants, Wood-cocks, Gnatsappers Thrushes, Black-birds, young Pidgeons, Spar∣rows, Patridges, Capons, Almonds, Pine-Nuts, Raysons, Currants, all strong Wines
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
moderately taken, especially those made of the Grapes of <HI>Italy</HI>; but Erection is chiefly caused and provoked by <HI>Styrium, Eringoes, Cresses. Erysimum, Parsnip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Artichoaks, Tur∣nips, Rapes, Asparagus, Candy'd Ginger, Gal∣linga, Acorns</HI> bruised to Powder, and drank in <HI>Muscadine, Scallions, Sea-Shell-Fish,</HI> &amp;c. All these (tho' excellent Restoratives) will not have present Operation, but you must use yourself to them for a considerable time or else you will reap little or no benent by them. The Act of <HI>Coition</HI> being over, (<HI>wheren the force of Imagination is certainly very prevalent in the causing of the Child to be of this or that Sex</HI>) the Woman (say the <HI>Antients</HI>) must gently repose on her Right Side, with her Head lying low, and her Body sinking down, that by sleeping in that posture, the <HI>Cell</HI> on the Right Side of the <HI>Matrix</HI> may prove the <HI>Place of Conception,</HI> in which is the greatest force of Generative Heat, which is the chief Inducement to the Procreation of <HI>Male</HI> Children, and rarely fails to answer the expectation of those that experience it, especially if they keep them∣selves warm, and without much Motion, leaning for the most part to the Right, and drinking a little of <HI>Spirit of Saffron, and Juice of Hysop</HI> in a <HI>Glass of Mallaga,</HI> or <HI>Aligant,</HI> when they lie down and rise, for the space of a Week. Now the fittest time (they say)
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
for the Procreation of <HI>Male Children</HI> is, when the <HI>Sun</HI> is in <HI>Leo,</HI> and the <HI>Moon</HI>'s in <HI>Virgo, Scorpio</HI> or <HI>Sagittarius.</HI></P>
<P>This Order they will also have observed for a <HI>Female Child,</HI> by lying as aforesaid on the left side, and strongly fancying a <HI>Female</HI> in the time of Procreation, especially if the <HI>Woman</HI> drink the <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Female Mercury,</HI> 4 days from the 1st day of Purgation; the <HI>Male Mercury</HI> (both Herbs so called) having the like Operation in case of a <HI>Male Child</HI>; for the Juice or Decoction of those Simples are of Force, the <HI>one</HI> to purge the <HI>Right,</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> the <HI>Left Side</HI> of the <HI>Womb,</HI> and thereby open the <HI>Receptacles,</HI> making way for the Seminary of Generation: And the best time to <HI>copulate</HI> for this Sex is, when the <HI>Moon</HI> is in the <HI>wane,</HI> and the sign in <HI>Libra</HI> or <HI>Aquarius,</HI> for <HI>then</HI> they will be of a most gentle, affable temper, very fair, and perfect in all their members. <HI>Avicenna,</HI> an Author of good repute, describes the <HI>time</HI> of <HI>Procreation</HI> thus: <HI>When</HI> (saith he) <HI>the Menses are spent, and the Womb is cleansed, which is commonly</HI> 5 <HI>days, or</HI> 7 <HI>at most, if a man lie with his wife from the first day she is purged to the fifth, she will conceive a Male; but from the fifth to the eight a Female, and from the eighth to the twelfth a Male again: But after that number of days, perhaps neither distinctly, but both in an</HI> Hermophradite.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16"/>In a word, They that would be commen∣ded to their Wedlock Actions, and be happy in the fruit of their Labour, must observe to copulate at distance of time, not too often, nor yet too seldom, for <HI>both these</HI> hurt Fruit∣fulness alike; for to eject immoderately weakens a <HI>Man</HI> and wasts his Spirits, and <HI>too often</HI> causes the Seed by long continuance to be ineffectual and not Manly enough. And thus much for the first general and particu∣lar; from whence I shall proceed to the se∣cond, which is to give the Reader to under∣stand <HI>how</HI> the <HI>Child</HI> is formed in the <HI>Womb,</HI> and what Accidents it is incident to, <HI>how,</HI> nourished, and <HI>how</HI> brought forth,</P>
<P>Certain it is, there are various Opinions concerning this matter: therefore I shall for the satisfaction of the curious, lay down the Opinion of the Learned, as thus, Man con∣sists of an <HI>Ovum,</HI> or <HI>Eg</HI> impregnated in the <HI>O∣varia</HI> or <HI>Testieles</HI> of the <HI>Woman,</HI> by the more subtile part of <HI>Man</HI>'s Seed; but there is a forming Faculty and <HI>Virtue</HI> in the <HI>Seed</HI> from a Divine and Heavenly Gift, it being a∣bundantly endued with Vital and Etherial Spirit, which gives Shape and Form to the <HI>Embryo</HI>; so that all the parts and bulk of the Body which is made up in the space of many months, and is by Degrees fram'd and form'd into a decent and comely Figure of a Man, do consist in that, and are adumbrated
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
thereby: On which holy <HI>David</HI> contempla∣ting, fell into his Divine Rapture and Ad∣miration, expressed in <HI>Psal.</HI> 138. <HI>I will praise thee▪ O Lord, because I am wonderfully made: Thy Works are wonderful. My Soul searcheth and knoweth it right well. Thou knowest all my Bones when I was Fashioned in the secret place, and when I was wonderfully formed in my Mo∣ther's Womb. Thy Eyes beheld me yet unmade, and in thy Book were all my Members written, which day by day were fashioned. Thy Know∣ledge is wonderful unto me, whereby I was made, I cannot understand it,</HI> &amp;c. And Physicians that have narrowly contemplated Man's Nature, constitute four different Times, wherein this Microsm, or little World, is framed, and perfected in the Womb.</P>
<P>The first is immediately after Coition, and is said to be perfected in the first Week, if no Efflux happen, which sometimes fall out through the slipperiness of the Matrix, or the Head thereof that shifts over like a Rose-bud, opening on a sudden, by reason of some cold Distemper, or over-weariness in Travel.</P>
<P>The second time of forming is constitu∣ted when Nature, and the force of the Womb, by the use of her own imbred For∣ces and Virtue, makes a manifest Mutation in the Conception, so that all the Substance seems Congealed Flesh and Blood, which
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
happens about the Twelfth and Fourteenth day after Copulation; and though this Con∣creation, or Fleshly Mass abound with hot fiery Blood, yet it remains undistinguishable without form of Figure, and may be called the rough Draught, or <HI>Embrio,</HI> and well likened to Seed which is sown in the Ground, which through kindly Heat and Moisture, grows up by degrees into a per∣fect Form, either in Plant or Grain; or as when a <HI>Potter</HI> Fashons a Vessel out of a rude lump of Clay.</P>
<P>The third time to make up this Fabrick, is set when the principle Parts shew them∣selves evidently and perspiciously; as the Heart, from whence proceeds the Arteries; the Brain, from which the Nerves proceed like many small Threads running through the whole Body; and the Liver, whose Office it is to seperate the Bile from the Blood, brought to it by the <HI>Vana Portae.</HI> The two first are the Seeds and Fountains of Life, that nourish and support each part of the Body; in framing which, the Faculty of the Womb is busied from the time of Conception to the Eighteenth Day of the first Month.</P>
<P>But Lastly, which time reacheth to the 28 or 30th day, the outward parts are seen exquisitely elabourted and distinguished by Joints, and then the Child begins to grow
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
and pant; from which progress of days, by reason the Limbs are divided, and the whole frame is perfect, it is no longer held an imperfect Child or <HI>Embrio,</HI> that is, a <HI>Con∣cretion</HI> that springs forth, but is held to be a perfect and absolute <HI>Child. Males</HI> for the most part are perfect by the 30th day, but <HI>Females</HI> seldom, till the 42 or 45 day; and the reason why the one is sooner perfected than the other, is, That the heat of the Womb is greater in producing the <HI>Male</HI> than the <HI>Female</HI>: For heat extends the Humour like soft Wax, diffusing and dilating it, and then by its force, Contracting, Framing, and Fashoning it, so Heat and Vigour of the Body, and Alacrity of Nature in the Man, makes the <HI>Male</HI> to move in 3 Months but the Female rarely under 4, at which time also his Hair and Nails comes forth, and the Child begins to stir, kick and tumble in the Womb; so that the motion is plainly perceived, and the Woman are troubled with <HI>Nauseating</HI> and <HI>Loathing</HI> of their Meat, and oftentimes covet, and greedily long for things contrary to Nutriment; as Coals, Rubbish, Chalk, Lime, Starch, Oat-meal, raw Flesh and Fish, or the like, which De∣sire proceeds from a former contraction of evil Humours, occasioning impure Blood in their contained Vessel within, and often occasions Abortion and Miscarriages; some

Women, as it has been noted by divers Authors of Credit, have been so extravagent in their Longings, that they have coveted Hob-Nails, Leather, Man's Flesh, Horse-Flesh, and the Flesh of divers Ravenous Beasts, for want of which they have cast their Birth untimely, or the Child has con∣tinued Dead in the Womb for many days, to the eminent hazard of the Woman's Life: But to proceed in this great Mystery, I shall unfold by what means the Infant is sustain'd in the Womb, and what posture it there remains in.</P>
<P>The Disputes among both Philosophers and Physicians, with what, and by what way the <HI>Faetus</HI> is nourished, have been ve∣ry great; some affirming by Blood only, from the <HI>Vmbilical</HI> Vein; others only by Chyle, received in by the Month, but the Truth is, it is nourished diversly, accord∣ing to the different degrees of Perfection, that an <HI>Ovum,</HI> or Egg passes from a Con∣ception to a <HI>Faetus,</HI> ready for the Birth.</P>
<P>But before we proceed, it will not be amiss to explain what we mean by this <HI>Ovum,</HI> or Egg. You must know then, that there are in the Generation of the <HI>Faetus</HI> two Principles, Active, and Passive: The Active is the Man's Seed,, which is elabora∣ted in the Testicles out of the Arterial Blood, and Animal Spirits. The Passive
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
Principle is an <HI>Ovum,</HI> or Egg, impregnated by the Man's Seed. For to say that Wo∣man has true Seed, is false, and erroneous. But the manner of Conception is thus; The most Spirituous part of Man's Seed in the Act of Generation, reaching up to the <HI>Ovarium,</HI> or Testicles of the Woman (which contain divers Eggs, sometimes more, some∣times fewer) secundates one of them, which being convey'd by the <HI>Ovi-ducts,</HI> to the bottom of the Womb, presently begins to swell bigger and bigger, and imbibes the moisture that is sent plentifully thither, af∣ter the same manner that Seeds in the ground suck the fertile moisture thereof to make them sprout.</P>
<P>When the parts of the <HI>Embryo</HI> begin to be a little more perfect, and the <HI>Chorion</HI> becomes so thick, that the Liquor cannot soak through it, the <HI>Vmbilical</HI> Vessels be∣gin to be formed, and to extend the side of the <HI>Amnios,</HI> which they pass through, and also through the <HI>Allantides</HI> and <HI>Chorion</HI> and are implanted in the <HI>Placenta,</HI> which gathering upon the <HI>Chorion,</HI> joyns into the <HI>Vterus.</HI> And now the Arteries that before sent out the nutritious juice into the <HI>Cavity</HI> of the Womb, open by the Orifices into the <HI>Placenta,</HI> where they deposite the said Juice, which is drunk up by the <HI>Vmbilical Vein,</HI> and conveyed by it first to the Liver
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and then to the Heart, where its more thin and spirituous part is turned into Blood, whilst the grosser part of it de∣scending by the <HI>Aorta,</HI> enters the <HI>Vmbilical Arteries,</HI> and is discharged into its Cavity by those Branches of them that run through the <HI>Amnios,</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as the <HI>Mouth, Stomach,</HI> and <HI>Gul∣let, &amp;c.</HI> are formed so perfecty that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Faetus</HI> can swallow, it sucks in some of the grosser <HI>Nutritious Juice,</HI> that is deposited in the <HI>Amnios,</HI> by the <HI>Vmbilical Arteries</HI>▪ which descending into the Stomach and Intestines, is received by the <HI>Lacteal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> as in <HI>Adust Persons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Faetus</HI> being perfected at the times before specified in all its parts, it lies e∣qually ballanced in the midst of the Womb as in the Center, all on a Head, and being something long, is turned round, so that the Head, a little inclines, and it lays his Chin on its Breast, his Heels and Ancles upon its Buttocks, its Hands on its Cheeks▪ and its Thumbs to its Eyes; but its Legs and Thighs are carried upwards, with its Hams bending, so that they touch the bottom of its Belly; the former, and that part of the Body which is over against us, as the Fore∣head, Nose, Face, are turned towards the Mother's Back, and the Head inclining downwards towards the Cocyx or Rump∣bone

them in vain, and genital Testicles inter∣verted, if the <HI>Woman</HI> wanted <HI>Seminal Excres∣sence</HI>; for being Nature doth nothing in vain, therefore it must be granted, that they were made for the Use of Seed and Procreation, and fixed in their proper Pla∣ces, both the Testicles and Receptacles of Seed, whose nature and force is to operate, and afford fruitful virtue to the Seed: and to prove this there needs no stronger Ar∣gument (say they) than that, if a Woman do not use Copulation to eject her Seed, she oftentimes falls into strange Diseases, as appears by young Widows and Virgins, A second Reason they urge, That although the Society of a <HI>lawful Bed</HI> consist not alto∣gether in these things, yet it is apparent, that the Female Sex is not better won and appear more blithe and jocund than when they are often satisfied this way, which is an inducement to believe that they have <HI>greater</HI> Pleasure and receive more Con∣tent than a Man: For since by Nature much Delight accompanies Ejection by the brea∣king forth of the swelling Spirit, and the stiffness of the Nerves, in which case the Operation of the Woman's Part is double, she suffering both ways, even by <HI>Ejection</HI> and <HI>Reception,</HI> whereby she is more recrea∣ted and delighted in the <HI>Venereal Act.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it is (they say) that the Child
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
more frequently resembles the <HI>Mother</HI> than the Father, because the <HI>Mother</HI> con∣fers the most towards its Generation: And they think it may be further instanced from the great love they bear them; for that besides their contributing <HI>Seminal Matter,</HI> they, during the time they are in the <HI>Womb</HI>▪ feed and nourish the <HI>Child</HI> with the <HI>purest Fountain of Blood</HI>; which Opinion <HI>Galen</HI> confirms, by allowing the Child to parti∣cipate more of the <HI>Mother</HI> than the Fa∣ther, and refers the Difference of the Sex to the Influence of Menstrual Blood; but the Reason of the Likeness he attributes to the Force of the Seed; for as Plants receive more from fruitful Ground than from the Industry of the Husbandman, so the Infant in more abundance receives from the <HI>Mo∣ther</HI> than the Father; for first, the Seed of both is heaped and fostered in the Womb, and there grows to perfection, being nourished with Blood. And hence they will have it that <HI>Children</HI> for the most part <HI>affect</HI> their <HI>Mother</HI> best, for it proceeds from the nearness of Nature by a natural Instinct, because the <HI>Mothers</HI> force was most employed about 'em. For 9 Months, and sometimes 10, she nourisheth the Child with her purest Blood, then her love towards it newly born, and the Likeness do clearly demonstrate, that the Woman
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
affordeth Seed, and that Women do con∣tribute more towards making the Child than Men. But in all this the <HI>Antients</HI> were very much in an Error, for the Te∣sticles (so called) in Womem, do not afford any Seed, but are two Eggs, analogous to those of Fowls and other Creatures; nei∣ther have they any such Office as those of Men, but are indeed <HI>Ovarium,</HI> wherein those Eggs are nourished by the sanguinary Vessels dispersed through them, and from whence one or more, (as they are fecundated by the Man's Seed) separated, and are con∣veyed into the Womb by the <HI>Ovi duces,</HI> The Truth of this is plain; for if you boile them, their liquor will have the same colour, taste, and consistency with the Whites of Birds Eggs; to say they want shells is nothing at all; for the Eggs of Fowls while they are in the <HI>Ovary,</HI> nay, after they have fallen down into the <HI>Vterus,</HI> have no Shell. And though when they are laid they have one, yet that is no more than a Fence which Nature has provided them against outward Injuries, while they are hatched without the Body, whereas those of Wo∣men, being hatced within the Body, need no other Fence than the Womb, by which they are sufficiently guarded.</P>
<P>And thus much for the clearing of this Point also; and now to the third thing pro∣posed,
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
<HI>viz.</HI> Whence grows the Kind, and whether the Man or the Woman is the Cause of the Male or Female Infant.</P>
<P>The primal Cause, as justly due in this and all other Cases, we must ascribe to God the Ruler and Disposer of all things, yet many things by his high Sufferance, proceed in regular order, by the Rules of Nature, and are carried on by their in-bred <HI>Motion,</HI> according to their usual and natu∣ral Course, without Variation, tho' indeed by favour from on high. <HI>Sarah</HI> conceived <HI>Isaac; Hannah, Samuel</HI>; and <HI>Elizabeth, John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI>; but these were to fulfil the Almighty's Decree; nor since those times have the Prayers of the righteous been un∣successful in obtaining Children; but pas∣sing over such Supernatural and Extraor∣dinary Causes that have their peculiar Ef∣fects, I shall proceed to speak of things natural and common. The Antient Phy∣sitians and Philosophers say, That since there are two Principles, out of which the Body of Man is made, and which ren∣der the Child like the Progenitors, and to be of one or the other Sex, <HI>viz.</HI> Seed com∣mon to both Sexes, and menstrual Blood proper to the Woman only: The Simili∣tude (say they) must needs consist in the Force of the Male or Female Seed, so that it proves like to the one or the other, as
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
more or less Plenty is afforded by either, but that the difference of Sex is not referr'd to the Seed, but to the Menstrual Blood, which is proper to the Woman; for were that force (say they) altogether retained in the Seed, the Man's Seed being of a hot∣ter quality than the Woman's, Male Chil∣dren would be superabundant, and none of the other Sex (or very rarely) would be propagated, whereof the kind of the Creature is attributed to the Temperament of the <HI>active qualities,</HI> which consist in Heat and cold, and to the substances or nature of the Matter under them, that is, to the flow∣ing of the Menstrual Blood: Now the Seed (say they) affords both Force to procreate and form the Child, and Matter for its Generation, and that in the menstrual Blood there is both Matter and Force; for as the Seeds most helps the material Principles, so likewise the menstrual Blood, the potential Seed, is (saith <HI>Galen</HI>) Blood well conco∣cted by the Vessels that contain it, so that Blood is not only the Matter of generating the Child, but also Seed, in possibility that Menstrual Blood hath both Principles, as Matter and Faculty of offering. The <HI>An∣cients</HI> say further, That the Seed is not the strongest Effi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent, the Matter of it being very little in quantity, but that the poten∣tial or efficient Faculty of it is very feeble:
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
Wherefore if the material part or Prin¦ciple of Generation, according to which the Sex is made, were only (say they) in the menstrual Blood, then would the Chil∣dren be all, or mostly Females, as if the efficient force was in the Seed, they would be all Males; but that since both have Operation in menstrual Blood, Matter pre∣dominates in quantity, and in the Seeds Force and Virtue. Deservedly (saith <HI>Galen</HI>) the Child receives its Sex rather from the Mother than from the Father, although his Seed do contribute something to the material Principles, though more weakly. But as for Similitude, although Imagina∣tion (say the <HI>Antients</HI>) be of extraordinary Force, it is referred rather to the Father than the Mother, as to the Quality of the Seed, at, or for a short time after Copula∣tion, but continues not long so to do, for that the Woman's Seed receiving Facul∣ty from the menstrual Blood, for the space of Nine Months, over-powers the Man's as to that Particular, because the men∣strual Blood flowing into the Vessels, ra∣ther cherishes and augments the one than the other; from which it may be more ea∣sily conjectur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that the Woman not on∣ly affords Matter to make the Child, but Force and Virtue to perfect the Concep∣tion, though the Woman's Seed be fit Nu∣triment
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
for the Man's by Reason of the moisture and thinness of it, being more fit to frame and make up Conception thereby; for as with soft Wax and moist Clay, the Workman can frame what he intends, so (say they) the Man's Seed mixing with the Woman's, as also with the Menstrual Blood, helps effectually to make the form and perfect Part of Man; but (with all the Respect and Difference imaginable to the Wisdom of the <HI>Ancients</HI>) we must needs say, that their Ignorance in Anatomy has led them into many and great mistakes; and their <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of the Formation of the <HI>Embryo,</HI> from a Commixture of Seeds, and the Nutrition of it from the menstruous Blood being altogether false, their Opinion in this Case must needs be false also.</P>
<P>Therefore (to conclude this Chapter) we say, <HI>That although a strong Imagination of the Mother may sometimes determine the Sex, (that is, make it Male or Female, accor∣ding as her Imagination is) yet the main A∣gent in this Case is the Plastick or Formative Principle, which is the Efficient in Forming the Child, that gives it this or that Sex, accor∣ding to those Laws and Rules that are prescri∣bed to it by the wise Creator of all things.</HI></P>

<P>THE Soul of Man is of so Divine a Na∣ture and Excellency, that Man him∣self cannot any wise comprehend it, it be∣ing the infused breath of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Almighty, Immortal and Incomprehensible, but by him that gave it, it being as it well may be termed, a part of himself; for <HI>Moses</HI> by ho∣ly Inspiration relating the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ginal of Man, tells us that <HI>God had breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life, and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me a living Soul.</HI> Now, as for all other Creatures, at his word, they were made and had Life; but the Creature that God hath appointed to set over his works, was favoured with the more immediate hand of the Almighty, forming him out of the Dust of the Earth; and se∣condly, condescending to breath into his Nostr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls the Breath of Life, which implies that there was more care and (if we may so te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m it) labour used about Man, than about all other Creatur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ated things, he only partaking and participating with

the Divine Nature, being made in his like∣ness, bearing the Image of God, that is, in Innocence and Purity, whilst he stood firm, but in his Fall, that lively Image was defa∣ced; yet such was the Infinite love of God towards him, that altho' he Rebelled a∣gainst him, he would not altogether cast him off, but found a way to restore him. Nay, so much in esteem was he thought, not deserving the least favour, that the Son of God, the second Person in the Glorious Trinity; when the fulness of Time was come, laying aside his Crown of Stars, left the Right hand of Glory, Majesty, and the bright effulgence that adorned him, and descending, took upon him our Nature. O infinite and unspeak∣able Love! Nay more, endured Shame, Reproach, Scourging, Buffetting, Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting on, and the Death of the Cross, that he might bruise the Head of the Serp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, and deliver the beloved Man from the Jaws and Brink of utte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ruin. And the better to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irm his love towards us is ascended on high, leading Captivity Captive, where he is so far from forgetting us, that he is become our Mediato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and makes daily Intercession for us to the Father, whose of∣fend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stice he has sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed as to the O∣riginal Sin. But to come nearer to my pur∣pose.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="38"/>If Man would understand the Ex∣cellency of the Soul, for as it is capa∣ble of comprehending it self, let him (after serious Recollection, descend into himself and search diligently his own Mind, and there he shall find so many admirable Gifts and excellent Ornaments, that it must needs strike him with <HI>Wonder</HI> and <HI>A∣maz, ment,</HI> as <HI>Reason, Vnderstanding,</HI> true <HI>Choice, Ability of Wit, Memory,</HI> and divers other Faculties, that absolutely ap∣prove the Soul to be more admirable, than that any should imagine it be finite, or subject to Annihilation, yet by Reason of its many Offices and Operations, whilst in the Body it is specified under sundry <HI>deno∣minations.</HI> For (as S. <HI>Augustine</HI> saith) when it enlivens the Body it is called the <HI>Soul,</HI> when it gives it Knowledge, the <HI>Judgment</HI>; the <HI>Mind,</HI> when it recalls things past, the <HI>Memory</HI>; whilst it discourseth and discer∣neth, <HI>Reason</HI>; whilst it contemplates, the <HI>Spirits</HI>; whilst it is in the sensitive Parts, the <HI>Senses</HI>; and as these are the principal Offices whereby the <HI>Soul</HI> declares its <HI>Pow∣er,</HI> and performs it <HI>Actions</HI>; for placed in the highest Part of the Body, and the nearest Heaven, it difuseth or disperseth effectual∣ly its Force into every Member, not propa∣gated from the Parents, nor mixed with gross Matter, but the infused Breath of

the Almighty, immediatly proceeding from him, nor passing from one to ano∣ther, as fondly and absurdly the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> have insinuated in their Opinions about the Transmigration of the Soul; and so vain were they that they did not only imagine the Souls of the deceased Men passed into new-born Infants, but into Beasts also; and from thence it was they forbid the eating of Flesh, and abstained themselves from so doing, lest, as they fondly fansied, they might (as <HI>Tertullian</HI> records it) eat their Grandfather in a Calf. But such frivolous and superstitious Notions are to be rejected by Christians, and those true ones obser∣ved, which are both reasonable and agree∣able to humane Capacities: For <HI>Orthodox Divines</HI> conclude in general, that the Soul is given to any Infant by Infusion, when he or she is perfected in the Womb, which happens about the 45th Day after Concep∣tion, especially for Males that in likelyhood will be born at the end of Nine Months, but in Femals, who are of a weaker Con∣stitution, and not so soon formed and be perfected thro' the defect of Heat) not till the 50th Day.</P>
<P>And altho this Day in all cases cannot be <HI>perfectly</HI> set down, yet <HI>Hypocrates</HI> has un∣dertaken to give his absolute Opinion, when the Child has its perfect form, whom
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
it begins to move, and when born, if in due Season; for in his Book of the Nature of Infants, he affirmeth, That if it be a Male, and he be perfect on the thirtieth day, and move at the sixtieth, he will come forth at the Seventh Month; but if he be per∣fectly formed on the 35<HI>th</HI> day, he will move on the 70<HI>th,</HI> and be born in the 8<HI>th Month.</HI> Again, if he be perfectly formed on the 45<HI>th</HI> day he will move on the 90<HI>th</HI> day, and be born in the <HI>Ninth Month.</HI> Now from these passing of Days and <HI>Months,</HI> it plain∣ly appears that the day of Forming being doubled makes up the day of moving; and that day three times reckoned makes up the day of Birth.</P>
<P>As for Example, where 35 perfect the Form, if you double it, it makes 70; the day of Motion, and three times 70 amounts to 210 Days or 7 Months, allowing 30 Days to one Month, and so you must con∣sider the rest: But as for the Female, it is longer perfecting in the Womb, and the <HI>Mother</HI> ever goes longer with a Boy than a Girl, so that there is difference in the Ac∣compt; for a Female formed in 30 Days moves not till the 70 day, and is born in the 7 Month; when she is formed in the 40 day she moves not till the 80 day, and is born in the 8 Month; but if she be perfectly formed on the 45 Day, she moves on the 90, and
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
is born in the 9<HI>th month</HI>; but she that is for∣med on the 50<HI>th day</HI> moves on the 100<HI>th day,</HI> then will she be born in the 10<HI>th month.</HI> And thus I have more largely demonstrated it to the <HI>Reader,</HI> that he may know the reasona∣ble Soul is not propagated by the Parents, but is infused by God, when the Child hath its perfect Form, and is exactly di∣stinguished in its Lineaments.</P>
<P>Now as the Life of every other Creature, as it is testified in the 17<HI>th</HI> Chap. of <HI>Leviti∣cus,</HI> is in the Blood, so the life of Man con∣sisteth in the Soul; the which although subject to Passion, by Reason of the gross Composure of the Body, in which it has a temporary Confinement, yet it is immor∣tal, and cannot in it self corrupt, or suffer change, it being a spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Divine mind, and a bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Almighty Breath, that di∣stinguishes Man from other Creatures, and renders him Immo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al; and that every Man has a peculiar Soul, it plainly appears by the vast difference between the Wit, Judg∣ment, Opinion, Manners, Affections, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Men. And this <HI>David</HI> observes, when he says, <HI>God hath in particular fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>oned the Hearts and Minds of all Men, and has given to every one its own being, and a Soul of its own Nature.</HI> Hence <HI>Solomon</HI> rejoyced that God had given him a happy Soul, and Bo∣dy agreeable and suitable to it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="42"/>It has caused many Disputes amongst the Learned, especially Philosophers, in what part of the Body the Soul chuses to reside; and some have given their Opinion that its Residence is in the middle of the Heart, and from thence communicates its self to every Part; which <HI>Solomon</HI> in the Fourth of his Proverbs seems to assert, when he says, <HI>Keep thy Heart with all thy Diligence, because Life proceedeth therefrom</HI>: but many curious Physicians searching the Works of Nature in Man's Anatomy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do give their Opinion, That its chief Seat is in the Brain, from whence proceed the Senses, Faculties and Actions, dif∣fusing the Operation of the Soul through all Parts of the Body, whereby it is enli∣vened with Heat and Force; but it doth communicate particular Force to the Heart by Arteries, Carotides, or sleepy Arteries, that part upon the Throat; the which, if they happen to be broke or cut, cause Barrenness, and if stopped, an Apoplexy; for there must necessarily be some Ways, thro' which the Spirits Animal and Vital may have intercourse and convey Native Heat from the Soul. For although the Soul is said to reside in one place, it ope∣rates in every part, exercising every Member, which are the Souls Instruments by which she manifesteth her Power; but
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
if it so happen, that any of the Original Parts are out of Tune, the Work is confu∣sed; as it may appear in case of Idiots, Mad∣men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Though in some of them the Soul by forcibly working recovers her <HI>super∣natural Vigour,</HI> and they become right af∣ter a long Despondency of Mind, and in some it is lost in this Life; For as Fire un∣der Ashes, or the Sun obscured from our sight by thick Clouds, afford not their full Lustre, so the Soul overwhelmed in moist or faulty Matter. is darkned, and Reason thereby overclouded; and altho' Reason shines less in Children than in those that are arrived to maturity, yet no man must ima∣gine that the Soul is an Infant and grows up with the Child; for then would it again decay; but it suits it self to the Weakness of Nature, and the Imbecility of Body wherein it is placed, that it may the bet∣ter operate. And as the Body is more and more capable of receiving its Influence, so it shews it self in its proper Lustre, having force and endowments at the time it enters the former Child in the Womb, for the substance of it can receive nothing less: and thus much to prove that the Soul comes not from the Parents, but is infused by God. And the next thing now to be handled is its Immortality, and thereby I shall demon∣strate the certainty of its Resurrection.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="44"/>That the Soul of Man is a Divine Ray, infu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by God, I have already made appa∣rent, and now come to shew you that what∣ever immediately proceeds from him, must participate of his Nature, and from thence consequently be as immortal as the Origi∣nal; for although all other Creatures are indued with Life and Motion, yet want they a reasonable Soul; and from thence 'tis concluded, that Life is in their Blood and that being corruptible, they perish, and after expiring are no more. But Man being indued with a reasonable Soul, and stamped with the Divine Image, is of a dif∣ferent Nature; and though his Body be corruptible, yet his Soul cannot perish, but must, when it is expelled its Earthly Taber∣nacle, return to God that gave it, either to receive reward or punishment; now that the Body can sin of it self is impossible, because wanting the Soul, it cannot act nor Proceed to any thing, either good or evil, for could it do so, additional Sins might be accumulated, even in the Grave; but 'tis plain, that after Death there is a Cessation; <HI>for as death leaves us, so Judgment finds us.</HI> And St. <HI>John,</HI> in the Fifth Chapter of his Gospel, tells us. <HI>That the hour shall come, that all that are in the Grave shall hear his Voice, and they that have done well shall com forth to the Resurrection of Life, and they that have

<HI>Reader,</HI> to enquire into the cause of such preposterous Forms.</P>
<P>Now a Monstrous Habit, or Shape of Bo∣dy, is contracted divers ways, as from Fear, sudden Frights, exstraordinary Passion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Influence of the Stars, the Mother's strange Imaginations, and divers Phantasms which the Mind conceive, deform the Bo∣dy, and render the Children of an impro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Shape, and many times not perfect in either Sex; sometimes the whole course of Nature is changed, either when the Principles of Generation are vitiated, on the Organs unfit; so that the natural Fa∣culties, to propogate and form the Child, cannot perform their Office exactly; for as the most ingenious Artist can bring no∣thing to perfection, if his Materials be bad, or out of order, so Nature wanting the force of her Faculties▪ or not having fit matter, must of necessity proceed to prepo∣sterously in forming the Child.

over-ruling Providence; but above all, unseasonable or intemperate Ve∣nery, is the cause of so many monstrous Shapes.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Low-Countrey</HI> Women especially those living near the Sea-side, being rest∣less, and troubled in Copulation, bring forth mishapen <HI>Embroy's,</HI> or rude and de∣formed Burthens, not only without moti∣on, but some that pant, and are alive, and these most commonly happen in case of Sailors, or Mariners who coming home, rashly Marry, or run upon their Wives without any due regard to their Menstrual Flux, or the Wombs cleansing it self to the Season of the Year, or the Moon, or Sun's Progress through the Coelestial Signs; not are the Women without regard to the Health or Shape of their Posterity, less de∣sirous to receive them, after a long separa∣tion, which is not only exceeding hurtful to themselves, from thence proceed not monstrous and untimely Births only, but dangerous Diseases often, to those who rashly proceed. The first (say the <HI>Antiants</HI>) is because the Seed mixing with Menstru∣al Blood, contract an unnatural Mass of corrupt Matter, which either turns to Mis∣carrage, Abortion, or a Monstrous and Deformed Birth; for by that means the Fa∣culty of the Womb (say they) loseth its

force to Generation, and success of Breed∣ing the Child, or if it try to come to any thing. it is at most some monstrous Form, not shaped like a man, unless in some parts which, after a long continuance in the Womb, will come forth with great pain and labour, not like to this: There is an Efflux that greatly trobles such, as by their inconsiderate rashness are subject to it.</P>
<P>Our Women, because Conception begins in the forth Moon, when the <HI>Menses</HI> flow down by force, and that Planet in Conjun∣ction, call it a Moon-birth, or many kinds. And some are of Opinion that this Copu∣lation may be made without the help of a Man, by force of Imagination, in those that are extreamly Lascivious; for that by often feeling, and touching their Husbands, at the same time strongly fancying them∣selves in the Act, their Seed flows to the Blood, and is by the Heat of the Womb formed into a foul Mass, but arrives at no perfection. And to the same purpose is it when Men strive against the Stream; en∣tring into Copulation in the forth and si∣lent Moon, and in the forth day of its Conjunction; for then not observing Na∣ture's Rules, he either loseth his labour, or Generates a monstrous Birth, or if it chance, which is almost next to a miracle to be perfect, it is by the <HI>Latins</HI> called a

<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
whence they had their Name, after this a Monster came forth of her Womb, with a crooked Back, long round Neck, and fiery Eyes, and a pointed Tail, being very nimble-footed; for as soon as it came forth it gave the affrighted Midwife the slip, and run up and down the Room to seek a hi∣ding place, till at last, one Woman more couragious than the rest, fell upon it with a Cushion and smothered it: This Monster had sucked the Blood from the Child, which came forth after it, being a Male, and so eaten the Flesh, that it scarcely lived to be Christned; nor could the Woman be in a long time restored to her Strength: And farther adds, that upon his Enquiry, she told him, that it had proceeded (as she thought) from unreasonable, and extraor∣dinary and insatiate Venery: <HI>Hereupon</HI> (says he) <HI>I prescribed her a wholsom Course of Life, and Medicines to restore her Forces; for she was become wonderful Lean.</HI></P>
<P>These and many such like things should teach all Men and Women to use Decency, and orderly Proceedings, in their mutual Embracings, lest Nature wronged thereby, monstrous Births ensue, in which Respect some lascivious People are much to be con∣demned, who suppose they may do what they list▪ and will by no means have their Pleasure bounded; and above all, Pocket

<P>The last thing in this Chapter to be con∣sidered is, whether monstrous Births have <HI>Reasonable Souls,</HI> and whether such shall appear at the Day of Resurrection; in dis∣cussing of which, I shall cite the Opinions of such learned <HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>Physitians</HI> as have made curious search, and diligently weigh∣ed these great Mysteries. And first, it is their Opinion, not jointly, but severall, that all those that are like Men, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder of Generation, deduced from our
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
primitive Parents, proceeded by natural means from either Sex, though they are deformed, and of monstrous shape, having notwithstanding a Reasonable Soul shall, when they have run the Date of Mortality, be capable of Resurrection to Immortality: but those that proceed not from Man, but by the Woman's unnaturally mixing with other Creatures, shall not participate of Immortality, but perish as brute Beasts, because such a monstrous Birth is not ca∣pacitated to receive a divine Part or Soul, which should entail him to the Resurre∣ction.</P>
<P>There are indeed amongst the number of Men and Women, that tread the Ter∣restial Globe, divers that are monstrously deformed, and of horrid Aspect, with di∣storted Jaws, and Goggle-Eyes, and many other marks of Deformity; but these tho' by their Parents rashness in indecent or un∣seasonable Copulation or the Defect of Na∣ture being thus disordered, yet are they referred to the number of Men and Wo∣men, because they speak, understand and act, which demonstrate them to have rea∣sonable Souls; and therefore shall they stand upon the Earth at the last Day, and at the <HI>Resurruction</HI> all Deformity shall be done away, and they shall appear in per∣fect Shape, and the Organical Parts ren∣der

<P>CErtainly the joyning of Hearts in a ma∣trimonial State is of all Conditions the happiest; for then a Man has whom to un∣ravel his Thoughts to, as well as a sweet Companion in his Labour; he has an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ternus Sensus,</HI> another Self, one in whose Breast, as in a safe Cabinet, is reposed his inmost Secrets, especially where reciprocal Love and inviolate Faith is centred; for there no Cares, Fears, Jealousies, Mistrust o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hatred can ever interpose; for what Man, as 'tis observed in Holy Writ, ever hated his own Flesh, and indeed a Wife is no less, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rightly considered; for our grand Paren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well observed, she is, or ought to be so e∣steemd of every honest Man, <HI>Bone of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bone, and Flesh of his Flesh, &amp;c.</HI> Nor wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>IF any be desirous to enter into the Holy State of Matrimony, let them observe their Ability and Constitution of Body, and not run themselves rashly upon Inconveni∣encies; for those who marry too young may rightly be termed to marry unseason∣ably; not considering their Inability; nor examining the Force of Nature; as divers there are, before they are ripe for the con∣summation
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
of so weighty a matter, who either rashly of their own accords, (by the instigation of Bawds. Procures, or Mar∣riage-brokers, or forced thereto by their Parents, who covet a larg Dowrey) take upon them this Yoke, to their great Preju∣dice: <HI>Lavinus Lemnius</HI> says, That he has known some of them who before the expi∣ration of a year, have been thereby so in∣feebled and weakned, that all their vital Moisture was exausted; so that he was upon their applying themselves to him, ob∣liged with Medicaments to restore their Strength that was fallen, and sunk down wherefore his advice is, That it is no way convenient to suffer Children, or such as are not of Age to mary, or get Children: But whosoever proposes to marry, must chieft observe this, that he choose one to his Companion and Partner in his Felicity, that is of an honest Stock and proceeding from temperate Parents. though her Dow∣ry be not so large as he could wish; that he observe the Conversation, and find there∣in that she is chaste, well bred, and of good manners. For a woman, (as the <HI>Comedi∣an</HI> saith) if she hath good Conditions▪ she has Portion enough. That of <HI>Alcamena</HI> in <HI>Plau∣tus</HI> is a witty saying; which all Maids and others of the Female Sex, should retain shew in remembrance: I do not think

(saith she) that to be my Dowry, which is called so: But Chastity, Modesty, and a setled desire to fear God, to love my Pa∣rents; and agree with my Kindred; to obey my Husband, to be bountiful, and to do good to such as are Virtuous and Ho∣nest. Now, if she proved as good as she promised, such a Wife was to be valued above the Price of Rubies.</P>
<P>'Tis Duty incombent upon Parents, to be careful in bringing up their Children in the way of Virtue, and have ever a re∣gard that they fully not their Honour and Reputation, especially the Females, and most of all Virgins, when they grow up to be marriageble; for if through the unnatu∣ral severity of rigid Parents they be crossed and frustrated in their love, many of them, out of a mad humour, if temptations lie in their way, throw themselves into the un∣chaste Arms of a subtle charming Temp∣ter; being through ahe softness of good Nature, and strong Desire, to pursue their Appetites, easily induced to believe Men's Flatteries, and feigned Vows of promised Marriage, to cover the shame; and then too late the Parents find the effects of their rash Severity, which brought a lasting stain upon their Family. Now, as 'tis an Error in marrying too young, so it is unequality of Mariage between Age and Youth, as a
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
young Man, who to make his Fortune, marries to a Woman, that for Age might be his Grand-mother, between whom, for the most part Jealousies and Discontents happen; nor is it possible such Women should have Children, be the Man never so sprightly and young, The like may be said, though with a little more excuse, when an old doting Fellow marries a young Virgin, in the Summer Season of her youth and Vigour, who whilst he strives and vain∣ly strains to please her, is the sooner wed∣ded to the Grave. For, as in Child-hood, or green Youth, 'tis unfit and unreasonable to think of Marriage, so in old Age to mar∣ry unequal, is altogether the same; for they that enter upon it too soon, are soon exhausted, and fall into Consumption, and divers other Diseases; and those that Pro∣crastinate and marry unseemly, fall into the like ill conveniences on the other side, having only the Honour to be dubbed a Knight of the Forked Order, and have their Names inrolled in the Collony of Cuckoldom; especially if their Wives have not been trained up in the Paths of Virtue, and lie to much open to Importunity and Temptation of lewd and debanched Men▪ And thus much for Errors or Over-sights in rash, and unseasonable preposterous Mar∣riages.</P>

<P>THE former of these Inconveniences is too apparent in Virgins, especially such as are of a Flegmatick Complection, evidently shewing it self by discolouring the Face, in making it look Green, Pale, or of a dusky Yellow, which proceeds from raw undigested Humours, nor only doth it appear to the Eye, but sensibly afflicts such as it possesses, with difficulty of brea∣thing, Pains in the Head, Palpitations of the Heart. unusual beatings, and small throb∣ings of the Arteries in the Temples, Neck and Back, many times casting them into Fe∣vers, if the Humour be very vitious, also loathing of Meat, and the distension of the Hypocondriack Part, by reason of the Inordinate Efflux of the <HI>Menstruous Blood</HI> to the greater Vessels, and by reason of the a∣bundance of Humour, the whole Body is often troubled with swelling, or if not, at least the Thighs, Legs, and Ankles, all

<P>The <HI>Galeni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> say, That this Distemper proceeds chiefly from the Obstruction of those Vessels that are about the Womb, occasioned by the abundance of gross vis∣cid and crude Humours, arising from the several inward causes; but there are also outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which have a share in the production of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as taking cold in the Feet, drinking of Water, Intemperance in Diet, and also the Eating of things wholly contrary to Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> raw, or burnt Flesh, Ashes; Coals, old S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Chalk, Wax, Nut-shells, Mortar, Lime, Oat-meal, To∣baeco-pipes, which occasion not only a Suppression of the <HI>Menses,</HI> but likewise ob∣structions through the whole Body, There∣fore the first thing necessary to eradicate the Cause, is Matrimonial Conjunction, and such Copulation that may prove to the satisfaction of her that is afflicted; for by that means the <HI>Menses</HI> will begin to flow according to their natural and due Course, and the <HI>Humours</HI> being diffus'd and disper∣sed, will soon waste themselves, and then no more matter being administred to in∣crease them, they will vanish, and a good temperament of Body will return: But in case such a Conjunction cannot be had so

soon as necessity requires, then let th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Damsel</HI> blood in the Ankle, and if she be about 16, you may likewise do it in the Arm, though suffer her not to bleed overmuch especially if the Blood be good. If the Dis∣ease be of any Continuance, then it is to be eradicated by <HI>Purgation: Perpetration</HI> of the <HI>Humour</HI> being first considered, which may be done by the Virgins drinking De∣coction of <HI>Cuaiacum,</HI> with <HI>Dittany</HI> of <HI>Creet.</HI> But the best Purge in this Case ought to be made of <HI>Aloes, Agarick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Rhub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> And then for strengthening the Bowels, and opening Obstructions, <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lyheet Medicines</HI> are chiefly to be used.

one or other violent Distemper; I shall somewhat largely treat thereof.</P>
<P>Sterility proceeds from divers Causes, but most commonly from some Defect in the Organs of Generation. Upon the Woman's Part it most commonly happens from the strict Closure of the Mouth of the <HI>Womb,</HI> which will not admit the Seed, and some∣times from the straitness of the Share-bone, which denies Entrance to the <HI>Penis</HI>; some∣times also from Ulcers or Exorescences in the Neck of the <HI>Womb.</HI> To these may be added too much Fatness, which straitens the Passage of the <HI>Matrix.</HI></P>
<P>Most of the Antients are of Opinion, that Conception is hindered commonly by the Humidity and Moisture of the Womb, when by reason thereof it cannot retain the Seed, or by bad Humours heaped up there, and corrupting it, or strange Defect of the <HI>Menstruous</HI> Blood. But certain it is, that it proceeds, either from some Tumour, Ul∣cer, Excrescence, or by some faults or o∣ther of the <HI>Womb, Ovaria,</HI>, or <HI>Oviducts</HI>: For if the Eggs are not impregnated with the <HI>Aura virilis,</HI> or Seminal Spirits, there can be no Conception, the Testicles of Women having no such Office as those of Men, but containing Eggs analogous to those of Fowl and other Creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="81"/><HI>Now, if the Orifice of the Womb be closed that the Seed cannot enter, or ra∣ther the</HI> Two Wings <HI>or</HI> Nymphae, <HI>so far that the</HI> Penis <HI>cannot pass the Neck of the Womb, it must be opened with an Instru∣ment; and subject to this Defect in Nature are many Women, especially in hot Countries, but most of all in</HI> Egypt, <HI>where the Chy∣rurgeons are forced with Silver Instruments to make way for the Instrument of Genera∣tion, a thing not altogether unpracticable in</HI> England.</P>

<P>If the Neck of the Womb be ulcerated, or any Excrescences happen there, which equally hinder Copulation, then may they be known by the <HI>Pain</HI> and <HI>Shooting,</HI> upon the least <HI>Compressure,</HI> and the Issuing forth of <HI>Putrid Humour,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Blood,</HI> if the Ulcers be great, and the <HI>Menses</HI> flow, the <HI>Water hot, Pains arising</HI> in the <HI>Fore∣part</HI> of the <HI>Head,</HI> and oftentimes they oc∣casion <HI>Gentle Feavers,</HI></P>

<P>Now some are in the outward part, and may be the easier come at, and External Applica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions are most convenient to be ap∣plied thereto; but those that cannot be come at, must be cured if possible, by <HI>In∣jection</HI>; the best <HI>Injection</HI> in this Case is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Others there are that are not so violent, and therefore admit of any easie Cure, not being so deep, known by a <HI>Putrid Greenish Matter</HI> that flows from them. To Cure this, Take Water wherein Barly has been boiled, Honey of Roses, new Milk and Sugar, with the Decoction of Lentils and after that gentle Astringents must be ap∣plied; some again are sordid, having much contagious Humour flowing from them; to cure which, stronger Medica∣ments must be applied: Others there are that eat into the Flesh, having a green con∣tagion flowing from them, to cleanse which, Aloes and Wormwood concocted in White-wine are most requisite.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="84"/>Another sort of Ulcers there are which ap∣pear long eating away the Skin from off the Neck of the Womb, and are discerned by the Blood and Pain they occasion im∣mediately upon the Concression appearing in the neck of the <HI>Womb,</HI> much like Chil∣blains, occasioned by ill Lying, extraordi∣nary Venery, by violent Inflammation or Flux of sharp Humours: The best Cure, af∣ter a gentle Purge, is an Astringent Cly∣ster, and after that to anoint them with the Grease that fryes out of a Ladle often used in a Kitchen, when it is held to the Fire, mixed with <HI>Vnguentum Album,</HI> or <HI>Pomatum.</HI> If the Defect be in the Seed, through ten∣derness of Age in the Woman, then the best Remedy is, convenient Diet, mode∣rate Exercise, and temperate Air, together with the Patience in the Man, till Nature in process of time operates so effectually, that all things appear and conspire to mutual satisfaction.</P>

<P>If Sterility be occasioned by Obstructi∣ons in the Vessels which it often does, then the Cause must be enquired into, and this often happens, the which is known by the small desire to <HI>Venery,</HI> and that little or no Satisfaction receiv'd thereby, a settling in the Courses, and a slimy Flegmatick mat∣ter mixed therewith, as also by their In∣ordinate flowing occasion'd by the Plenty of <HI>Humours</HI> collected in the <HI>Womb,</HI> which by reason of the abundance of windy Va∣pours contracted therein, cause Obstructi∣ons, to which may be added a cold <HI>Fleg∣matick Constitution,</HI> and from thence it is▪ that sudden Paleness arises in the Face; to remedy this, the Party must alter her Diet, not eating any Cold, Raw, Flegmatick Substance, but rather such things as are apt to stir up <HI>Cholerick Hot Humours</HI> in the Body, as <HI>Anniseeds,</HI> or <HI>Carraway-seeds,</HI> in her Bread, store of <HI>Penny-Royal</HI> in her Broth: let her likewise, each Morning for a Week together, make a Posse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in which she must boil the Roots of <HI>Birth∣wort.

<P>If the Womb be defective in its Reten∣tive Faculty, Men frequently labour in vain; in such a Case the Women must avoid Sor∣row, Anger, or much Sleep, Eating new Cheese, Milk, and raw Food, especially Lettuce, Endive, Spinage, Beets, Nuts, Cherries, Pussane, Onions, Garlick, and the like, they all being hurtful to Genera∣tion: Nor must she drink nor use Vinegar, nor eat the Fat of Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t too frequently, but the Womb must be cleansed from the over-a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undant Moisture, with the Deco∣ction of Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts-Tongue, (an herb so call'd) Cummin, Fennel, and Aniseed, and strengthned with the Syrup of <HI>Wormwood,</HI>

Operation in changing Sexes in the Womb.</P>
<P>This Point is of much necessity, by rea∣son of the different Opinions of Men rela∣ting to it. Therefore before any thing positive can be asserted, it will be altogether convenient to recite what has been deliver∣ed, as well in the Negative as the Affirma∣tive. And first, of the first, <HI>Severus Plinius,</HI> who argues for the Negatives, writes thus▪ The Genital parts (saith he) of both Sexes, are one so unlike other, in <HI>Substance, Com∣position, Situation, Figure, Action,</HI> and <HI>Vse,</HI> that nothing is more unequal, and by how much more all other parts of the Body (the Breast excepted, which in Women swell more because of their secondary Use) have an exact Resemblance, so much the more in Resemblance are the Genital Parts of one Sex, compared with the other, una∣like; and if their Figure be thus different▪ much more is their Use. The Venerial Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>petite also proceeds from different Causes for in Men it proceeds from a Desire of E∣mission, and in Women from a Desire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Completion, in Women also the chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of those Parts are concave and apt to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceive, but in Men they are only por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and in a Woman solid.</P>

In the first place, let her be diligent to leave nothing unsearched, which may be advantagious to her <HI>Practice,</HI> never imagining her self so perfect but she may add to her Knowledge by Study and Experience; yet never let her apply any Remedies in that Case, unless she has try'd them, or known them try'd with Success, or at least is conscious of their Force, that they will do no harm, doing nothing in that nature to practice upon Poor or Rich, but speaking freely of what she knows, and giving Reason for the further Confirmation thereof, by no means daring to give directi∣ons for such Medicine as will cause Abor∣tion, to pleasure those that have unlawful∣ly conceived, which to do, is a high degree of wickedness, and may be ranked with Murther▪ but if any come to her with spe∣cious Pretences, let her send them to able Physicians, and neither for fair Words nor
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
lucre, be won to hearken to them. If she be sent for, let her know to whom she goes, and be careful therein, lest by laying any one that has an inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctious Disease, as the Pox, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> she get it, and so spoil other Wo∣men as a Midwife once did, who laying a Strumpet that had an inveterate Pox, which occasioning a Bubo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon her right Hand, and she not leaving off her Calling, spoiled divers Women, not the Women only, but the Men also, to whom it was communicated by their Wives, which made them think hard of each other, and for a long time could not imagine how it hap∣pened; but at last it was discovered by an able Physician, and the Midwife for ever af∣ter debarr'd her Practice, and not so only, but follow'd with Curses even to her grave. She must likewise observe that she enter∣tains no great-belly'd Women at Bed and Board in her House, lest thereby she bring a Scandal upon her self, and so lose her Practice. If the Birth at any time be hard and difficult, she must not be dismayed, but chear up the Woman, and try her utmos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Skill to make the Labour easie, Directions for which shall hereafter be inserted; nor must she ever think of any thing but doing well, and using her utmost Skill, causing all necessary things that are proper for the Work, Consolation of the Woman, and
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
Reception of the Child to be in a readiness; and above all let her use her diligence, ei∣ther by perswasion or otherwise, to keep the Woman from being unruly in her Pangs, lest thereby she destroy both her self and her Child, and not in any wise to proceed too hastily in her Business, but wait God's leisure in all things, and by no means let her suffer her Wits to scatter by dismay or doubt, if things go not well, for fear it disorders the Senses, and a Person that keeps her Wits together, is capable of giving Assistance in weighty Affairs, for when we are most at a Plunge, then there is most need of Prudence to set things right. And seeing she can never be an expert Mid∣wife that has no farther Knowledge than of the external Parts, I shall not think it amiss, briefly with modesty to proceed in describing the generative Part of a Woman; as they have been anatomized by the Lear∣ned of the present and past Ages, and shew the Use of such Vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as are contri∣buting Generation.</P>

<P>WAS it not for the benefit of Practiti∣oners and Professors of the Art of Midwifry, I should above all things spare to treat of these particulars, because they may be turned by some Lascivious and lewd Persons into ridicule, but they being absolutely necessary to be known, I will hope the best, and proceed in order.</P>
<P>The parts that offer themselves to view, without any Deduction, at the bottom of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Belly are the <HI>Fiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra Magna,</HI> or the Great Chink, with its <HI>Libia,</HI> or Lips, the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns Veneris,</HI> and the Hair.

<P><PB N="97" REF="105"/>The next things that offer, are the <HI>Nym∣phae</HI> and <HI>Clytoris,</HI> the former of which is of a membrany and filmy Substance, spongy, soft▪ and partly fleshy, being of a bloody Colour in the shape of Wings, two in num∣ber, though from their Rise they are joined in an acute Angle p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oducing there a fleshy Substance, which cloaths the <HI>Clyeoris,</HI> and many times they spread so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that incision is required to make way for the Man's In∣strument of Generation,</P>
<P>The <HI>Clytoris</HI> is a substance in the upper Part of the <HI>Division,</HI> where the two Wings concur, and is the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of <HI>Venereal</HI> Pleasure, being like a Yard in Situation, Substance, Composition and Erection growing some∣times out of the Body two Inches, but that never happens, unless thro' extream Lust or extraordinary Accident. But to proceed, this <HI>Clytoris</HI> consists of two spongy and skinny Bodies, containing a distinct Origi∣nal from the <HI>Pubis</HI> Bone, the Head of it being covered with a tender Skin, having a hole or passage like the <HI>Penis,</HI> or Yard of a Man, though not quite through, in which, and the bigness, it only differs from it.</P>
<P>The next things in course are the Fleshy Knobs, and the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Neck of the Womb. And these <HI>Knobs</HI> are behind the Wings, be∣in four in number, much resembling Myr∣tle-Berries, being placed in Quadrangle,

one against the other, and in this Place i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> incerted to the Orifice of the Bladder which opens it self into the Fissure to eva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuate the Urine, for securing of which from Cold or the like inconveniency, one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Knobs are placed before it, and shut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up the Passage.</P>

<P>The <HI>Hymen,</HI> or <HI>Claustrum Virginale,</HI> is that which closes the Neck of the Womb, being, as I have before cited in the Chapter relating to Virginity, broken in the first Copulation, its use being rather to stay the untimely Courses in Virgins, than to any other end, and commonly when 'tis broke in Copulation, or by any other Accident, a small quantity of Blood flows, with some between the Duplicity of the <HI>two Tunicles</HI> which constitute the Neck of the Womb, there are many Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns and Arteries running along, and arising from the Vessels, descend∣ing on both sides the <HI>Thighs,</HI> and passing in∣to the <HI>Neck</HI> of the <HI>Womb,</HI> being extreamly large, and the reason of their Largeness is, for that the Neck of the Bladder requires to be filled with abundance of Spirit, there∣by to be extend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lated for its bet∣ter taking hold of the <HI>Penis</HI>▪ great Heat be∣ing required in such motions, which be∣coming more Intense by the Act of Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tion does consume a considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uantity of Moisture, in supplying which large Ves∣sels are altogether necessary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XIV. A Description of the Wombs Fabrick, the prepa∣ring Vessels and Testicles in Women, as also of the deferent or ejaculatory Vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the lower part of the Hypogastrion, where the Hips are widest and broadest (they being greater and broader therea∣bouts than those of Men, which is the rea∣son they have likewise broader Buttocks than Men) is the Womb joined to its Neck, and is placed between the Bladder and strait Gut, which keeps it from sway∣ing or rowling, yet give it liberty to stretch and dilate it self, and again to contract as Nature in that case disposes it: Its Figure is in a manner round, and not unlike a Gourd, lessening a little and growing more acute toward one end, being knit to∣gether by its proper Ligaments, its Neck likewise is joined by its <HI>own Substance,</HI> and certa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Membranes that fasten it to <HI>Os Sa∣crum</HI> and the Share-bone. As to its large∣ness, that much differs in Woman, especial∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Difference is great between such as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave born Children, and such as have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn none. In Substance it is so thick, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exceeds a Thumbs Breadth, which after Conception, it is so far from decreasing,
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
that it augments to a greater Proportion, and the more to strengthen and confirm it, it is interwoven with Fibres overthwart, strait, and winding, and its proper Ves∣sels are Veins, Arteries and Nerves, and amongst these are two little Veins, which pass from the Spermatick Vessels to the Bottom of the Womb, and two larger from the Hypogastricks, which visit both the Bottom and the Neck, the Mouth of these Veins, piercing as far as the inward Concavity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Womb</HI> hath also two <HI>Arteries</HI> on both sides, the <HI>Spermatick Vessels</HI> and the <HI>Hypo∣gastricks.</HI> which still attend or accompany the Veins, and besides these there are di∣vers little Nerves and intwined in the Form of a Net, which extend throughout even from the Bottom to the <HI>Pudenda</HI> them∣selves, being chiefly placed for Sense and Pleasure moving in Sympathy between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Head and Womb,</P>
<P>Now it is to be farther noted, that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason of two Ligaments that hang on ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther side of the <HI>Womb,</HI> from the Share-bone and piercing through the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are joyned to the Bone it self: that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Womb</HI> is moveable upon sundry Occasions often falling low, or rising high; as for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Neck of Womb,</HI> it is of an exquisite Feel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, so that if it be any time out of Order
<PB N="103" REF="111"/>
by being troubled with a schirrous Brawn, Over-fatness▪ Moisture, or Relaxation, the Womb is subjected thereby to Barrenness: In those that are with Child there frequent∣ly stays a most glutinous Matter in the Entrance to facilitate the Birth; for at the time of Delivery the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Womb</HI> is opened in a strange Manner, to such a Wideness as is conformable to the bigness of the Child, suffering an equal Dilation from the Bottom to the Top.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Preparatery</HI> or <HI>Spermatick Ves∣sels</HI> in Women, they are made of two Veins and 2 Arteries, not differing from those in a Man, but only in their <HI>largeness</HI> and <HI>man∣ner of Insertion</HI>; for as to their Number there are so many Veins, and the like <HI>pro∣portion of Arteries,</HI> as in Men, the Right Vein issuing from the trunk of the hollow Vein descending, and the left from the emulgent Vein, and on the side of them are two Arteries, which grow from the <HI>Aorta.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Longitude</HI> and <HI>Latitude</HI> of these Vessels they are narrow, and shorter in Women than in Men; only observe where they are wrinkled or crumpled, they are more wreathed and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orted than in Men, as shrinking together, by reason of their shortness, they may by their Loosness be the better stretched out when Occasion requires it. And these Vessels in Women
<PB N="104" REF="112"/>
are carried on with an oblique Course thro' the leser Guts to the Testicles or Stones, but are in the mid-way divided into two Branches, the greater going to the Stones, constitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the various or windy Body, and wonderful Inoculating; the lesser Branch end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in the Womb, in the side of which it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sperseth it self, and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iefly at the higher Part of the bottom of the Womb, for the Nourishment thereof, and that part of the Courses may purge through these Vessels; and seeing the Testicles in Wo∣men are seated near the Womb, for that cause these Vessels fall not from the <HI>Perito∣naeum,</HI> neither make they such Passages as in Men, nor extend themselvs to the Share-bone.</P>
<P>The Stones in Women, commonly cal∣led the Testicles, perform not the same Action as Men; they are also different in their Situation, Magnitude, Temperament, Substance Form and Covering. As for their Seat, it is in the Hollowness of the <HI>Abdo∣men,</HI> neither are they extreamly pendulous, but rest upon the Muscles of the Loins, that so they may, by contracting the grea∣ter heat, be more fruitful, their Office be∣ing to contain the <HI>Ova,</HI> or <HI>Eggs,</HI> which being impregnated by the Man's Seed, in∣gender Man; yet they Differ from those of Men in Figure, by reason of their less∣ness
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
or flatness at either end, not being so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound or Oval. The External Superficies being likewise more unequal, appearing like the Composition of a great many Knots and Kernels mixed together, there is also another difference in their Substance, they being much more soft and pliable, loose, not so well compacted.</P>
<P>Their magnitude and temparament be∣ing also different, for they are much colder and lesser then those in Men; as for their covering or inclosure, it likewise differs ex¦treamly, for as Men's are wrapped or co∣vered in divers Tunicles, by reason they are externally Pendulous, and subject to divers Injuries, unless so fenced by Nature so Womens Stones being internal and less subject to casualty, are covered with one Tunicle or Membrance, the which though it closely adhere to them, yet are they like∣wise half covered with the <HI>Peritonaeum.</HI></P>
<P>The Different or Ejaculatory Vessels are two obscure Passages, and on either side, nothing differing from the Spermatick Veins in substance; rise they do, on one part from the bottom of the Womb, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaching from the other extremity either to the Stones, or any other part, but shut up and unpassable, adhering to the Womb as the Colon does to the blind Gut, and winding half way about; the Testicles
<PB N="106" REF="114"/>
are every way remote to them, yet though they touch them not, they are tied to them by certain Membranes, resembling the Wings of a Bat, or Flutter-mouse through which certain Veins and Arteries passing from the End of the Testicles, in these beginning, or may be termed here to have their Passages, proceeding from the Corners of the Womb to the Testicle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and are accounted the proper Ligament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by which the Testicles and Womb are united, and strongly knit together, and these Ligaments in Women are the Cre∣mesters in Men, of which I shall speak more largely, when I come to describ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Masculine parts conducing to Gene∣ration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. A Discourse of the Vse and Action of the seve∣ral Parts in Women appropriated to Genera∣tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Externals commonly called the <HI>Pudenda,</HI> are designed to cover the great Orifice, and that to receive the <HI>Penis</HI> or Yard in the <HI>act of Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion,</HI> and give Passage to the <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Vrine.</HI> The use of the Wings and Knobs like Mirtle-berries are for the security of the Internal parts, shutting the <HI>Orifice</HI> and <HI>Neck</HI> of the <HI>Bladder,</HI> and by their swelling up cause <HI>Titulation</HI> in those <HI>parts,</HI> and also to ob∣struct the <HI>unvoluntary Passage</HI> of the Urine.</P>
<P>The Action of the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ftoris</HI> in Women, is like that of the <HI>Penis</HI> in Men, <HI>viz.</HI> Erection; and its outer end is like the <HI>Glans</HI> of the <HI>Penis,</HI> viz. and has the same Name. And as the <HI>Glans</HI> in Man is the Seat of the greatest Pleasure in Copulation, so is this in Women, whence 'tis called <HI>Amoris dulce∣do</HI> and <HI>Aestum Veneris.</HI></P>
<P>The Action and Use of the Neck of the Womb is also equal with that of the <HI>Penis, viz.</HI> Erection, occasioned divers ways. First, in case of Copulation, it is e∣rected and made strait for the Passage of the <HI>Penis</HI> to the Womb. Secondly, Whilst
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
the Passage is repleated with Spirit and <HI>Vi∣tal Blood,</HI> it becomes more strait for embra∣cing the <HI>Penis,</HI> as for the Convenience of E∣rection it is twofold; <HI>First,</HI> Forasmuch as if the <HI>Neek</HI> of the <HI>Womb</HI> was not erected, the <HI>Yard</HI> could have no convenient Passage to the <HI>Womb. Secondly,</HI> It hinders any hurt or damage that might ensue through the vio∣lent Concussion of the <HI>Yard</HI> during the time of <HI>Copulation.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Vessels that pass thro' the <HI>Neck</HI> of the Womb, their Office is to repleat it with <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> that still as the Moi∣sture consumes the Heat contracted there in <HI>Copulation,</HI> it may by those Vessels be re∣newed. But their principal Business is to convey Nutriment to the Womb.</P>
<P>The <HI>Womb</HI> it self has many Properties at∣tributed to it, as <HI>First,</HI> Retention of the fe∣cundated Egg, which is properly called <HI>Conception.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To cherish and nourish it, til by the help of Nature, it has framed the Child, and brought it to Perfection. And then it strongly operates in sending forth the Birth when the time of its remaining there is expired, dilating and spreading it self in a wonderful Manner: And indeed is the Field of Man's Generation, being de∣signed for no other Purpose, and so aptly
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
removed from the Senses, that nothing of Injury can proceed from thence, retaining in it self a Power and Strength to operate and cast forth the Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, unless by Accident or the like it be rendred deficient. When to strengthen and enable it, besides the Helps of Nature, sundry Remedies are to be applied by skilful Hands Direction. For which shall be hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P>The Use of the preparing Vessels is this: The Arteries convey the <HI>Blood</HI> to the <HI>Testicles,</HI> where part of it is spent in the nourishment of them, and the Production of those little Bladders (which do in all things resemble Eggs) through which the <HI>Vasa Praeparantia</HI> run, and are obliterate in them. And as for the Veins, their Office is only to bring back what <HI>Blood</HI> remains from the uses aforesaid.</P>
<P>The Vessels in this kind are much shorter in Women than in Men, by reason of their <HI>nearness</HI> to the <HI>Stones,</HI> which Defect is yet legthenned and made good by the many In∣tricacies or Windings, to which those Ves∣sels are subject, for in the middle Way they drive themselves into two Branches, tho' different in Magnitude, for one being grea∣ter than the other, passes by the Stone.</P>
<P>The Stones in a Woman are very useful for when they are defective, Generation
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
is at an end; for altho' those little Blad∣ders, which are on their outward Superfi∣cies, contain nothing of Seed, as the fol∣lowers of <HI>Galen</HI> and <HI>Hipocrates</HI> did erro∣neously imagine, yet they contain several Eggs commonly to the number of twenty in each Testicle) one of which being im∣pregnated by the most spirituous part of the Man's Seed in the Act of Coition, descends through the <HI>Ovi-ducts</HI> into the Womb, and from thence, in process of time becomes a living Child.</P>
<P>Their Figure is not exactly round, but flat and dispersed on the sides; in their low∣er part Oval, but in their upper, where the Blood-Vessels enter them, more plain; and have but one Membrane to encompass 'em, probably that the Heat may have the easier Access.</P>

If the womb wax round and swell, the Courses stay, the Thighs swell with some pain, the whole Body grows Weak, the Face at times becomes Pale, the Urine white with a little Cloud after some standing at the top of it, if many Atoms appear in it▪ Eightly, If Urine be put in a Glass three days, and the Woman have conceived, cer∣tain live things will appear to stir in it: If a bright Needle be put in a whole Night and she have conceived, divers little red Specks will be thereon, but if not, it will

be blackish or rusty. Nor are these Imagi∣nations, but the proved Assertions of the Learned in Physick, and Skilful in Mid∣wifry, who have made it their Study to search into the Depths of Natures Secrets: And next comes a nicer Point to be treated of, not without the Patronage of such whose Wisdom and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efatigable Labour have rendred them famous to Posterity; The which take as followeth,</P>

than the other having commonly its first Motion on the right side on the 60th Day, if her Courses flow the 40th Day af∣ter Conception, if her Belly be more acute towards the Navel, and as she goes, she puts her Right Leg foremost, and rising observe to ease her self on the Right Side more than on the Left.</P>
<P>Now in case a Female be conceived, the to∣kens are averse to those, for the most part the first Motion rarely happening before the 19th day after Conception, and then it is made on the left Side. Females are carried with more Pains than Males, thro' Defect of Heat in the Womb, to attract the Sub∣stance; also the Thighs and Genital Mem∣bers of the Woman swell more than ordi∣nary, her Colour departs, and her Long∣ings are extream, and her Courses flow the Thirtieth Day after Conception.</P>
<P>If Twins are conceived, which many times happens thro' the Impregnating o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Eggs at the same time, the sign there∣of will not appear till the third or fourth Month after Conception, and then the first Appearance will be by the Motion of the Infants both ways. that is on either side of the Womb at once, for they receive their Souls at one and the same time; also if her two Flanks swell higher than the middle of the Belly; if there does appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>The windy Mole is occasioned through defect of Heat in the Womb and parts adja∣cent, as the Liver and Spleen, which ingen∣der a polite or windy Vapour which fills the membranous Part, and puffs up the Concavity of the Matrix.</P>
<P>The watry Mole is ingendred of divers apt confluences of thin Matter or watry Fluxes, which passing thro' the Vessels, evacuates into the Womb, having its Original from the Spleen, Liver, or parts adjoyning; or rather, it proceeds from the weakness of the Matrix, which cannot assimilate the Blood that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s brought to nourish it; part whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s turned into Water, and not being avoid∣ed, stayeth in the Womb.</P>
<P>The Humorous Mole is ingendred by moist attracted Humours, as the Whites, or certain watry Purgation, which distil from the menstruous Veins, and gathering into a glutinous Substance, stay in the con∣cavity of the Womb.</P>
<P>The Membranous Mole is no other than a contraction of Blood within a Skin or Membrane, to which is fastened many white and transparent Vessels, filled with Blood, the which coming forth, and being thrown into Water, the Blood goeth out▪ and the Membrane rumples toge∣ther,

move freely and lively in all parts of the <HI>Womb,</HI> for although there is a Motion in a <HI>false Conceeption,</HI> yet it is dull, and not quick nor active in Motion, the Motion not being in it self, but in the expulsive Faculty of the <HI>Mother.</HI> And further, if the <HI>Woman</HI> observe, she may perceive it fall always to the side she lies on, and she lying on her Back, if her Belly be stroaked down, the Burthen will descend, and not have, for want of in∣bred Force, Power to recover its Station. But what confirms it more is, that nine Months expired, no Travel ensues, but her Belly still increases▪ whilst all the rest of the Body grows lean and out of order.</P>
<P>The Signs of the Windy Mole are divers, as the sudden stretching of the Belly like a Bladder, yet soft and spungy, especially near the Groins, and swelling thereof, when if it be struck it sounds like a Drum, and that the swelling is sometimes more and sometimes less; so that according to its In∣crease and Decrease the <HI>Woman</HI> feels more heavy or more light.</P>
<P>The Watry Mole is known by its Di∣stention of the Belly, and especially, when she lies upon her Back, the sides thereof are more swelled than the middle, or the bottom which grows flatter by reason the watry humour falls to the sides, moving up and down, as if it were a fluctuation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Water, and much to the same purpose a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Symptoms of the <HI>Humorous Mole,</HI> only with the Distinction, that the Flanks and Thighs are more stretched by the Watery Mole than by the other, because the Water being thinner than the Humour, or not con∣fined in Cells, flows thither, and that which in case of a watery Mole comes through Nature's Conduit is clear, when in case of a humorous Mole, the Water is red, and of a Blood Colour.</P>
<P>Further, observe, in case of a <HI>false Con∣ception</HI> the Courses come not down, and the Navel of the <HI>Mother</HI> advanceth it self little or nothing; which in the true <HI>Concep∣tion</HI> is otherwise.</P>
<P>Other <HI>false Conceptions</HI> there are occasio∣ned by divers Tumours, which the Igno∣rant take for Moles, when they are only Rotundities and Swelling the Belly, which are not discovered till the Womb be open∣ed; and then though the Womb be not all out of order, there does appear at one or both <HI>corners</HI> thereof, little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ags full of Water, in others, there are to be seen a Heap of Kernels, or superfluous Flesh like a Cluster of Grapes in the Womb, causing it to swell. Yet, in such Cases, the Courses are obser∣ved to proceed in due order, which denotes the <HI>Womb</HI> to be in good Order.</P>
<P>Another Excrescency of Flesh there is,
<PB N="121" REF="129"/>
which some call a <HI>Pendant Mole,</HI> being a peice of fleshy Substance, hanging within the interior Neck of the Womb, being in breadth about a finger at the Place where it is fastned, increasing bigger and bigger towards the bottom, like a small Bell pos∣sessing the whole Orifices, nay, sometimes appearing outward to a great bigness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Instructions for Women how to govern them∣selves during their being with Child.</HEAD>
<P>THese Instructions being exceeding neces∣sary, I thought fit to lay them down for a Rule to such as are desirous of Self-preservation. And indeed, for want of due Observance, divers Diseases afflict Child-bearing Women, nay, the Child is frequent∣ly lost, or, if it come to a perfect Birth, proves sickly and disordered through the Mother's Misobservance.</P>
<P>In the first place then, the <HI>Woman</HI> with Child ought to chuse a temperate Air, not affected with Fogs arising from Marshes, Ditches, Ponds, Lakes or Rivers, and not to go abroad in too hot; nor too cold Wea∣ther, nor when the <HI>South-wind</HI> blows <HI>strong</HI>; for that Wind, above all others, dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rbs and disorders <HI>Women with Child,</HI> oftentimes
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
causing Abortion: And next to it the <HI>North-wind</HI> is hurtful, causing <HI>Catarrhs, Coughs</HI> and <HI>Rheums,</HI> which; opening the Body, causes the <HI>Woman</HI> to bring forth before her time. In short, if any evil Vapour be drawn in during Purgancy, it causes divers Diseases.</P>
<P>In case of Diet, she ought to be very cau∣tious in chusing such Meats as create whol∣som nourishment, all Meats that are mode∣rately dry, being taken so to do; and let her observe not to fast immoderately; for that renders the Child sickly and weak, and of∣ten for want of nourishment, constrains it to be born before its time; nor on the o∣ther hand must she be too gluttonous, for that again stuffs it, and causes it to swell beyond its natural Bounds.</P>
<P>All Meats, either too hot or too cold, and moist, are to be avoided, as Salads, Spiced meats, and the extraordinary Use of other Meats, which makes the Children come forth oftentimes without Nails, which is a Sign of short Life. The most wholsom Meats in this case are Pidgeons, Turtles, Larks, Partridges, Pheasants, Veal Mutton, or any such Meat that is of good Juice, and contributing to kindly Nourishment; as al∣so such Fruits as are sweet and of easy Di∣gestion, as <HI>Cherries, Pears, Damsons,</HI> &amp;c. but let her avoid such things as subject her Body to Windiness.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="131"/>Her Longings if extravagant she must re∣strain, at least as much as in her lies, not eating any thing that is filthy or contrary to Nourishment, nor let her sleep imme∣diately after Meals, and not at all in the Day-time if she can avoid it; the Night being preferable in such cases when she may sleep her fill, so it exceed not nine hours.</P>
<P>Her Exercise ought to be moderate, for <HI>violent motion,</HI> either in Walking or other∣wise, <HI>molests</HI> and <HI>disturbs</HI> the <HI>Womb,</HI> Riding in a Coach, especially upon the Stones or in uneven Way (the last three Months are dangerous) as also extraordinary Sounds or Noises, and above all, the Ringing of Bells, and Discharging of Guns.</P>
<P>Laughing, Crying, or immoderate An∣ger, or any other Passion is extreamly hurt∣ful; nor in the first four Months after <HI>Con∣ception</HI> ought she to lie with her Husband, forasmuch as the Act of <HI>Copulation</HI> moves and shakes the <HI>Womb,</HI> and consequently the Fruit therein, and causes the Courses to de∣scend. She must likewise in the 6<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th Month</HI> abstain, but in the 7<HI>th</HI> and 9<HI>th</HI> it is not forbidden, but rather to be encouraged, by reason, as Physicians affirm, it opens the Passage, and thereby facilitates the Birth; and the better to help it, the <HI>Woman</HI> ought to take such things as may keep her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody soluble, as Syrrups and other loosening

<HEAD>CHAP XX. Rules to be observed upon a Womans lying down, and her Delivery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving thus far proceeded in what, as I conceived, is highly necessary to be known by the Professors of this Art, I shall gradually proceed to what remains: And, <HI>First,</HI> to inform the <HI>Reader</HI> what is necessa∣ry to be observed upon the Woman's lying, down in order to her Delivery.</P>
<P>The Hour according to Computation of Time, and the Disposition of the Body ap∣proaching, let the Woman send for a skil∣ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Midwife, not delaying so to do, but ra∣ther <HI>too soon</HI> than <HI>too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate</HI>; at what time let her prepare a little Bed or Couch, of a moderate Heighth, and so situate, that it be far from the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or,</HI> near the <HI>Fire,</HI> and con∣venient for the Midwife and her Assistants to pass round and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iding on every side, as Occasion requires, having Change of Linnen, and a small Cricket or little Log of Timber to rest her Feet against, she ha∣ving more Force when they are bowed than otherwise.</P>
<P>Having thus provided, when the Wo∣man feels her Pains come, if the Weather be not extream cold, let her walk leisurely
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
about the <HI>Room,</HI> resting her self by turns upon the Bed, expecting so the coming down of her Water, which is a Humour that is contracted in one of the outward Membranes and flows thence when it is broke by the struggling of the Child, or some other Accident, there being no <HI>direct time</HI> affixed for its Efflux, though for the most part it flows not above two hours before the Birth. Motion likewise will cause the Womb to open and dilate it self, when ly∣ing along in Bed will prove troublesome, yet if she be much spent and weakened, she may take some gentle Cordial to refresh her self, if her Pains will Permit.</P>
<P>If her Travel be tedious, to revive her Spirits, she may take any <HI>Broth of Chickens</HI> or <HI>Mutton,</HI> and after it a poach'd Egg, but must not take any thing to excess. As for the Posture Women are delivered in, they are divers; <HI>some</HI> lying in their Bed, <HI>others</HI> siting in a Chair▪ supported and held by others, or resting upon the side of the Bed or Chair; <HI>some again</HI> upon their Knees, being supported under their Arms; but the <HI>safest</HI> and <HI>most cemmodious</HI> Way is in the Bed, whenas the <HI>Midwife</HI> ought to observe these following Rules:</P>
<P>Let her see that the Woman be laid upon her Back, her Head a little elevated▪ by the help of a Pillow, having the like
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>
help to support her Reins and Buttocks, and that her Rump lie high; for if she lie low, she cannat be well delivered; then let her keep her <HI>Knees</HI> and <HI>Thighs</HI> as far asun∣der as she can, her Legs bowed together, her Buttocks, the Soles of her Feet and Heels being fix'd upon a little Log of Tim∣ber, placed for that purpose, that she may have the greater Force to strain: Now in case her <HI>Back</HI> be <HI>exceeding weak,</HI> a Swath∣band may be cast under it, the Band being four double, and about 12 Inches broad, and this must be held by two Persons, who with steady hands and equal motion must raise her up at the time the Pains happen; but if they be not exact in their Motion, 'tis better evaded, and at the same time let two Women hold her Shoulders that she may the better strain out the Birth with more Advantage; and the better to facili∣tate it, let a Woman stroak or press the up∣per Part of her Belly gently, and by degrees. Nor must the Woman her self be faint-hearted, but couragious, and of a good Heart; forcing her self by straining and stopping her Breath.</P>
<P>In case of Delivery, the Midwife must wait with Patience till the Child's Head or other Members burst the Membrane; for through Ignorance, or haste to be gone to other Women, as some have done, the
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
Midwife tear the Membranes with her Nails, she endangers both the Woman and the Child; for it lying dry, and wanting that Slipperiness that should facilitate it, its Egress comes forth with greater Pain.</P>
<P>When the Head appears, the Midwife must gently hold it between her two hands, and draw the Child at such times as the Womans Pangs are upon her, and at no other, slipping by degrees her four fingers under its Armpits, not using a ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh hand in drawing it forth, lest by such means the Child, through its tenderness, receive any Deformity of Body.</P>
<P>As <HI>soon</HI> as the Child is taken forth, which is commonly with its Face downwards, let it be laid upon its Back, that it may more freely receive External Respiration; then cut the Navel-string with a sharp Instrument about three Inches from the Body, tying that which adheres to the Belly, with a silk∣en string, as near as you can, then cover the Head and Stomach of the Child well, suf∣fering nothing to come upon the Face.</P>
<P>The Child being thus drawn forth, and in Health, lay it aside, and let the Midwife regard the Patient, in drawing, or causing to come forth the Secundine: And this may be done by wagging and stirring them up and down, and afterwards with a gentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hand drawing them forth, or if the Work
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
be difficult, let the Woman hold Salt in her Hands, shut them close, and breath hard into them, whereby she shall know whether the said Membranes be broken or not: The like may be known by causing a Strain or Vomiting, by putting one Finger down her Throat, by straining or moving her inferiour Parts, being all observed to be done out of Hand. If this fail she may take a draught of raw Elder-water, or the Yolk of a raw Egg, or smell to a piece of <HI>Assa foetida,</HI> if she be troubled with the Wind-Cholick, a Remedy for which, I shall hereafter prescribe. If she have taken cold, it is a great Obstruction to the coming down of the Secundines; and in such cases the Midwife ought to chafe the Woman's Belly with a gentle Hand, which breaks not only the Wind, but obliges the Secun∣dines to come down. And these proving ineffectual, the Midwife must dilate with her Hand the exterior Orince of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omb, and gently draw it forth. Having discour∣sed of common Births, or such as for the most part are easie, I shall proced to give Directions in case of Extremity.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. In case of Extremity, what ought to be ob∣served, especially to Women who in their Travel are accompanied with an Efflux of Blood, Convulsion, or Fits of the Wind.</HEAD>
<P>IN case of Extremity, greater Regard must be had than at other times; and first of all, the Situation of the Womb, and her Posture of Lying must be cross the Bed, being held by such as have Strength to pre∣vent her slipping down, or moving her self in the Operation of the Man-midwife or Chirurgeon; her Thighs must be sundered as wide as may be, and so held, whilst her Legs invert and bend backward towards her Hips, her Head leaning upon a Bolster, and the Reins of her Back supported with the like, her Rump and Buttocks likewise elevated, observing to cover her Stomach, Belly and Thighs with warm Linnen, to keep them from cold Wind.</P>
<P>The Woman being in the Posture afore∣said, let the Operator put up his Hand, if he finds the Neck of the Womb dilated, and remove the contracted Blood that ob∣structs the Passage of the Birth, and having by degrees, with much gentleness made Way, let him tenderly move the Infant,
<PB N="133" REF="141"/>
his Head being first anointed with sweet Butter, or a harmless <HI>Pomatum,</HI> and if the Waters are not come down, then without any difficulty may they be let forth, when if the Infant attempts to break forth with the Head foremost or cross, he may gently turn it to find the Feet, which having done, let him draw forth one, and fasten it to a Ribband, then put it up again and by de∣grees find the other, when bringing them as close and as even as may be, and be∣tween whiles giving the Woman leave to breathe, urging her to strain in helping Na∣ture to perfect the Birth, he may draw it forth: and the better to do it, that his hold may be surer, he must fasten or wrap a Linnen-Cloth about the Child's Thighs, observing to bring it into the World with its Face downward.</P>
<P>In case of a Flux of <HI>Blood,</HI> if the Neck of the Womb be open, it must then be mature∣ly considered, whether the Infant or the Secundines come first, which often the lat∣ter happening to do, stop the Mouth of the <HI>Womb,</HI> and hinder the Birth, to the endan∣gering both the Woman and Child; in such a case, I say, the Secundine must be be removed by swift turn, and indeed they have by their so coming down deceived many, who feeling their Softness, supposed the Womb was not dilated, and by their
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
being so deceived, the Woman and Child, or at least the latter has been lost, the Secun∣dines removed, the Child must be sought for and drawn forth as has been directed; and if in such a case the Woman or Child die, the Midwife or Chirurgeon is blame∣less, because they did their true Endeavour.</P>
<P>If it appear, upon <HI>Enquiry,</HI> that the <HI>Secun∣dine</HI> comes first, let the Woman be deliver∣ed with all convenient Expedition, be∣cause great flux of Blood will follow, for then the Veins are opened, and upon this Account, two things are to be considered. <HI>First,</HI> the <HI>bigness</HI> or <HI>smallness</HI> of the <HI>Secundines</HI> advancing; if the former, and the Head of the Child appear first, it must be guided and directed towards the Neck of the Womb, as in Case of Natural Births, but if there, thro' the Weakness of the Child or Mother, appear any Difficulty in the Delivery, the best Way is to search for the Feet, and thereby draw it forth; but if the latter, the <HI>Secundines</HI> may be put back with a gentle Hand, and the Child first taken forth,</P>
<P>Another matter is more worthy, <HI>viz</HI> If the <HI>Secundine</HI> be far advanced, so that it cannot be put back, and the Child follow it close, then are the <HI>Seundines</HI> to be taken forth with much Care, as swift as may be, and laid aside, without cutting the En∣tail that is fastned to them, for by that you
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
may be guided to the Infant, the which, whether alive or dead, must be drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth by the Feet with all Expedition, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is not to be acted unless in case of great Necessity, for in other cases the Secundine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught to come last.</P>
<P>As for a dead Child, in drawing it forth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et these directions be carefully observed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Chirurgeon, <HI>viz.</HI> if the Child be found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tead with its Head foremost, the danger is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he greater, and more difficult will be the Delivery; for it is an apparent Sign the Woman's Strength begins to fail her, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the <HI>Child</HI> being <HI>dead,</HI> and wanting its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-bred Force, can be no Ways assisted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Delivery; wherefore the most certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd safe way is for the Chirgeon to put up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his <HI>lets hand,</HI> sliding it as hollow in the <HI>Palm</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he can, into the Neck of the Womb, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the lower part thereof, towards the Feet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that between the Head of the Infant and the Neck of the Matrix, when ha∣ving a Hook in the right Hand, chuch it close, and slip it up above the Left Hand, between the Head of the Child, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat of his hand, fixing it in the bone of the Temple towards the Eye, or else in the hol∣low of the Eye, or for want of conve∣niently coming at these in the occipital Bone, observing still to keep the left hand in its place, with it gently moving and

<P>If a Child come forward with its Shoul∣ders, the Neck being bowed as it often happens, as also the Hands and Feet stretched upwards: in such a case the Mid∣wife must with much diligence move the Shoulders, that she may direct the Head to the passage, and the better to perfect it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Woman must rock her self, &amp;c. These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd such like methods are to be observed
<PB N="144" REF="152"/>
in all single Births: And the same may be observed in case of Twins or Treble Births, for as the single Birth has but one Na∣tural way and many unnatural Forms even so it happens with the Birth of many Children; wherefore the Midwife must ob∣serve (if Twins be in the Womb and press foreward according to the natural Form) that she receive that first which is nearest the passage▪ not letting the other go, lest by retiring, it should chang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Form; nor must she, when one is born, delay to bring forth the other; and this Birth in the na∣tural form is the more easie because the Chil∣dren are most commonly less then the sin∣gle Births, and consequently require a lesser passage; but if this Birth happen in an un∣natural form, it is the more difficult and dangerous. In the Birth of Twins, let the Midwife be exceeding careful that the Se∣cundines be naturally brought forth, lest in such a case, the Womb being delivered of its burthen, falls, and by its so doing the Se∣cundines continue there longer than is re∣quisite, to the indangering of the Woman.</P>
<P>If it so happen, that the Woman is preg∣nant with Twins, and one come naturally, and the other unnaturally, as the one with the Head, the other with the Feet foremost, then must the Midwife consider to deli∣ver the Natural-Birth first, and then i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>
she cannot turn the other, draw it out in the posture it presses forward, but if that with the Feet downwards, be much before the other, then may she deliver that first, turning the Head on the other side.</P>
<P>In this case the Midwife must be diligent to search that instead of Twins, it be not a Monstrous Birth; as a Body with two Heads, or two bodies Joined together, which she may observe, if both the Hands come foremost, by putting up her Hands betwen them as high as she can and if she find they are Twins, she must gently put one of them aside, to make way for the o∣ther, taking at first that which is most ad∣vanced, having regard to the other, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he change not its situation.</P>
<P>Now to prevent the first Child's being in danger of its Life, the Midwife, as soon as 'tis come forth, must tye the Navel-string, as has been before directed, and also bind it again, with a long and large Fillet to that part of the Navel, that is fastned to the Se∣cundines, the more readily to find them.</P>
<P>The second Infant born, let her dili∣gently inquire whether there be not two Se∣cundines, for by the shortness of the Liga∣ments it often happens that it retires back, to the damage of the Woman: wherefore least in such a case the Womb should close it is most expedient to hasten them forth with all convenient speed.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="154"/>if two Infants are joyned togather by the Body, as sometimes monstrously falls out, then although the Heads come fore∣most, yet it is convenient, if possible to turn, them, and draw them forth by the Feet, observing when they come to the Hips, to draw them forth as swift as may be: and in this case great care ought to be observed in anointing and widening the Passage.</P>
<P>And thus much for extremity or Unnatural Births. And the next thing I shall proceed to, is how to order the Woman after Natu∣ral or Unnatural Births, or Delivery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP, XXII. What ought to be observed after Delivery.</HEAD>
<P>PResently after Delivery, in case of a Na∣tural Birth, especially if the Woman has had hard labour, it is convenient to wrap her in the Skin of a Sheep taken off before it is cold, putting the flesh side to her Reens and Belly, or for want of this the Skin of a Hare, or Coney, being flayed off as soon as killed, may be applied to her Belly: and in so doing the dilation made in the Birth will be closed up, and the melancoly Blood, expelled from those parts; And these may be contributed
<PB N="147" REF="155"/>
in Summer the space of an hour, and in Win∣ter too, after which let the Woman be swathed with a fine linnen Cloth, about a quarter of a Yard in bredth chafing her Belly before with Oyle of St. <HI>Jons-wort,</HI> after that raise up the Matreix with a linnen Cloth many times fol∣ded, then with a lettle Pillow or Quilt over her Flanks, then use the Swath somewhat above the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nches winding it prety stif, ap∣plying at the same time a warm Cloth to her Nipples, nor presently applying Remedies to drive back the Milk, by reason the body at such a time is disordered, and as it were out of frame, for there is neither Vein nor Artrey which does not strongly beat, where such re∣medies to drive back the Milk being all of a dissolving Nature, it is improper to apply them to the Breast during such confusion and disorder, lest by so doing evel Humours be stay∣ed or contracted into the Brest, wherefore Twelve hours ought to be the least space allowed for the Circulation and settlement of the Blood and what was cast upon the Lungs by the vehement Agitation during the Labour, to retire to its proper Receptacles.</P>
<P><HI>A while after Delivery you may make a restrictive of the Yolk of two Eggs, and a quartter of a point of White Wine, an Ounce of Oyl of</HI> Saint John's∣wort, <HI>as much of the Oyl of Roses,
<PB N="148" REF="156"/>
Plantain and Rose-water, of each One Ounce, bray them together, fold a Linnen cloath, and dip it therein, warm it before a gentle Fire, and apply it to the Breast, and the pains of those parts will be greatly</HI> eased.</P>
<P>Present sleep is not convenient, but about four hours after Delivery, she may take Broath, Candle or what other liquid matter is nourishing, and afterwards if she be dis∣posed to sleep, it may be safely permitted, And this is as much in case of a Natural Birth, as ought immediately to be done.</P>
<P>In case of Extremity or an unnatural Birth, these Rules ought to be observed: In the fii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st place let the Woman keep a tempe∣rate Diet, by no means overcharging her self, aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r such an Excessive Evacuation and to say true, her Diet, must be equal to that of wounded Persons, not being ruled or giving Credit to unskilful Nurses, who admonish them to feed lustily, the better to repair the loss of blood, for that blood is not for the most part pure, but such as has been detained in the Vessels or Membranes, better avoided for the Health of the Woman than kept, unless there happens an extraordinary Flux of Blood, for if her nou∣rishment be over-great, it will endanger her falling into a fever, nay more, it will increase the Milk to superfluity, which crudling sometimes, turns to Aposthumes;
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
wherefore it is requisite, for the first five days especially, that she take moderately Panado, Broath, Poach'd Eggs, Gelly of Chickens, or Calves Feet, French Barly-Broath, each day somewhat increasing her allowance; if she intend to be a Nurse to her Child, she may take a little more then ordi∣nary to increase the Milk by degrees which must be of no continuance, but drawn off, either by the Child, or otherwise. In this case likewise, let her have Coriander or Fennel-Seeds, boiled in her barly-broath; but by any means, for the time specified let her abstain from Meat. If no Fever trouble her, she may drink now and then a small quantity of White-wine or Claret as also Syrup of Maiden-hair, or other Syrup that is Astringent, taking it in a little water well boiled: And after the suspi∣cion of a Fever, or fear of contraction of Hu∣mours in the Breast, she may be nourished more plentifully with the Broath of Pullets, Capons, Pidgeons, Mutton, Veal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which must not be till after eight days, from the day of delive∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is over, at what time the Womb, unless some accident hinder, has purged it self; it will be then likewise expedient to give her cold Meat sparingly, that so she may be enabled to gather strength, she during the time resting quiet and free from disturbance not sleeping in the day time if she can avoid it. If there
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
happen any obstruction in the Evacuation of the Excrement, a Glyster may be adminstred to help the defect, made after the manner following.</P>

<P>Take of both the Mallows and Pelletory of the Wall, a handfull of each, Cammomile and Mellylot Flowers, of each a handfull, Anny-seeds and Fennel-seeds, of each two ounces, boil them in the decoction of a Sheeps head, and take of this three quarts disolving in them of common Honey and course Suger, two Ounces strained well, and administer it Glysterwise, but if it not operate to your mind, then may you take an Ounce of Catholicox.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. What ought to be done to the Child when new∣ly born, with divers other matters relating thereto,</HEAD>
<P>THE Navel of the Child having been before recited, the Midwife must cleanse the Infant, not only in the Face, but likwise the whole Body, anointing the Groin, Hips, Buttocks, with Oyl of sweet Almonds, or Oyl of Ros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to make the Skin supple and cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se the Pores, thereby to exclude the penetration of the Air, and strengthen the Members, nor would it be a∣miss if she should take the decoction of Ro∣ses or Rose-cakes, and red Sage decocted in White-wine, and bathe the Child there∣with, the decoction being blood-warm.</P>
<P>The Infant being thus well anointed, or supplied, and well dried, wrap it up warm, and give it a spoonful of Suger and Molla∣go, or a scruple of Mithridate or Venice-Treacle, dissolved in half a spoonfull of Ca∣nary, and after it a lettle Cardus-water, observing to bathe or anoint it each morn∣ing as aforesaid. If the Child have extream throws immediately after it comes into the World, it must be rubbed with Juice of Pellitry or the Decoction unto which fresh
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
Butter is melted, or for want of that Spinage-Juice, with Hogs Grease applied to the Navel, with new layed Eggs, mix∣ed or cemented with Nut Oyl, laying them likewise to the Navel; or you may admi∣nister a Clyster made with milk, the Yolk of an Egg, and a small quantity of Sugar, which will undoubtedly ease the Pain.</P>
<P>Now some Children are born of evil con∣stituted Parents, or are defective thro' the evil nourishment the Woman has unadvi∣sedly taken during her Pregnancy, which occasions the Child to be much afflicted with flegmatick Humours, to expell which you may lay the Child on one side, and then turn it to the other, for if you lay it upon the Back, it will be subject to Suffoca∣tion or strangling, by the ascent of the hu∣mor, the Belly must above all things, be kept soluble, causing the Infant to void the Blood kept in the Intrails, from the time of its being in the Womb, by giving it a small quantity of Suppository of black Soap mix∣ed with fresh Butter, to take away the Acrimony of it, after which immediately let the Infant take a Spoonfull of Syrup of Violets which will oblige Flegm to pass down; but if heat be defective add to the Syrup half the quantity of Oyl of sweet Almonds, bathing the Belly and Stomach of it as it is undressed.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="161"/>If it happens that the Child's Cods be full of wind, the Child must be gently moved to and fro, and the Cods anointed with Oyl of Mirrh, giving it the liquid Anni∣seeds boiled in small Drink, if they be swelled or extended with Water, rub and chafe the Skin with fresh Butter, and the Water will swet out. But what is more to be regarded than any other thing, is the chusing a good Nurse, for upon that choice depends the thriving or not thriving of the Child, and in such Cases these things ought to be regarded, <HI>viz.</HI> Observe that she be not dull sighted, squint-eyed, have down cast looks; that she be not con∣sumptive, or subject to Fits, that her Breath is pure, that no noisom Vapour be con∣veyed to the Lungs of the Child, that she be not infected with Bloaches, Boyls Blains, or that she or her Husband never were afflicted with the <HI>French Di∣sease,</HI> that she is not given to excessive Drinking, or Gluttony, nor in the least subject to Epilepsie or falling Evil. For the Nurse being in a manner the second Mother to the Child, it drawing from her good or evil humours, especial care must therefore be taken that the Nurse be good conditioned, moderate in meat and drink, wakeful and vigilant, not fretful nor sub∣ject to passion, that her Milk be clean and
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
sweet, flowing sufficiently, her Breasts well fixed and large, not over-fleshy nor she over-fat; and above all, that she be not too desirous of carnal Copulation, by which means the Milk will be rendred unwhol∣som. Having thus far proceeded in these af∣fairs, I shall thro' God's Blessing lay down divers necessary matters for the Preserva∣tion of Childing Women and Infants, thereby to prevent the hazard and Loss which too often happens in such Cases.</P>

<P>IN the Business of Generation, nothing is more to be regarded by the Woman, than the time of her <HI>Conception</HI> and <HI>Quick∣ning,</HI> that thereby she may be enabled to be exact in the time of her delivery, every natu∣ral Delivery being at the End of 9 months, especial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y if at the time or near it the Wo∣man is wont to have her Natural Purga∣tions or that the time fall out with the Full or New Moon: Nay, tho' a day or two before or after▪ for these things so falling out, not only hasten, but facilitate Delivery, and
<PB N="155" REF="163"/>
the knowledge of this must extend to the Woman for many Reasons. First, that she may prepare and dispose of her self for so great a task. Second, for that at such a time divers Maladies are incident to her, nor can their Cause be penetrated into, un∣less those things be well known, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now one thing necessary the better to enable the Woman to understand it, is the time of Natural Courses, for in case she have for∣got, or by not rightly understandeng their natural Efflux, or is puzzled therein by reason of some unnatural Retention or ex∣traordinary Evacuation, she may rectify her Judgment by these Directions, <HI>viz.</HI> From the Age of 14 to 21, Women have their courses according to the most natural cour∣ses of the new Moon; from 21 to 30 in the first Quarter; from 30 to 37 or 38 in the Full Moon: and from that time to the time they cease in the last Quarter.</P>
<P>Beside what is before-mentioned she will be made sensible of the approaching time by pain in her Groin, Thighs, the small of her Back, the lower part of her Navel, together with swelling and hardness in the said pla∣ces, shivering and quaking throut the Body, as if possessed with an Ague, and sud∣denly after with flushing Heat, Feebleness and Lassitude, sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Sweats on the Face, and Flushings of the Blood there, and her Bo∣dy

will be in a manner restless, she shall per∣ceive the Child move downward with more force than ordinary, and a bloody water will distill from the inferiour parts, in case of these Fore-runners, she may be assured her time is at hand, when as she must not delay sending for her Midwife whose Office tis to order her to the best advan∣tage, directions for which I have already given, for wonderful it is that Nature has so well ordred her works that the Ma∣trix opens not unless upon some extra∣ordinary Casualty, before the time▪ perfixd and not till then do these Signs appear. But appearing they ought to be much re∣garded, if the Woman desires her own safety and the preservation of the Child.</P>
<P>In case the Woman be subject to Mis∣carriage, or to come before her time, let her take Mint, Roses Marjorum, of each a small handful bruise them together, put them in a bag flat, and hang it about the Womans Neck, so that it might reach to the pit of her Stomach, and it will draw the Womb upwards, or keep it in its place that it shall not fall down, or give the Child occasion to seek for an untimely passage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. A Tumour in the Breast, its Cause and Cure.</HEAD>
<P>OF Tumours there are several sorts, but first of the Flagitious Tumour, the Cause of which proceeds from a thick and unnatural Vapour, arising from the Men∣strual Blood, which is retained corrupted in the Matrix, and that again occasioned by the suppression of the Courses, or when Nature is defective in discharging them in∣to their proper Place in due time; as also from Corruption of Humours, whereby are ingendred evil Vapours, and their pas∣sing by several Ways, causes the Breast to swell or distend as if it were a true swel∣ling, and is known by a shooting pain, and disorder of Heart, by Reason of the Wind that oppresseth it, the left Breast being for the most part more swelled than the right, communicating Pains to the Arms and Shoulders, as likewise the Ribs on the same side, the Breast being white and shining, sounding like a Drum if touched gently, and swelled in all Parts alike: to cure this, as also the windy Tu∣mour, you must order to observe a mode∣ration in Diet, and thereby Crudities may be avoided, and all such things as contract windy Humours in the Veins, suffering her
<PB REF="179"/>
to drink Water wherein Cinnamon and Anniseeds have been boiled, as also the Rind of Citron, and then let her observe to take such things as are proper to provoke the Courses, in doing which she will find the Humours abate, then let her take Ce∣lundine, Camomile, Groundsil, and Ground-Juice, stamp them and boil them in White wine, and in so doing, you will ease the Pain and restore the Breast. As for Dis∣eases and Accidents incident to young Children, there are few Women of any Experience, but are skilful in curing and ordering them, wherefore for brevities sake I shall pass them over and proceed to Anatommize the Genital Parts of a Man, that one thing remaining necessary in this Trreatise; as also to instance what Men and Women ought to marry, that their Issue may be fair, healthful, and prosperous.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP, XXVI. What Women ought to Marry, with what Men, that they might have Children</HEAD>

<PB N="175" REF="183"/>
sort that no Vapour nor Fume may issue out, and if within a while after she feel the Savour of the Incense in her Mouth she may then conclude that the Barrenness comes not through her own Defect, but through her Husband's forasmuch as the Fumes found the Passage open, whereby it pierced up the Nostrils. But although this proof perform that Effect which <HI>Hy∣pocrates</HI> speaketh of; namely the piercing up to the Inner part of the Mouth; yet is this no infallible Argument of the Hus∣bands Barrenness, nor of the Fruitfulness of the Wife, since Want of Children may arise through an unapt disposition in them both in respect of the Correspondency of Qualities, for it hath oftentimes appeared that a Man that could not have Children by one Wife, hath had them by another; the like also hath befallen Women.</P>
<P><HI>Hypocrates</HI> gives us his Opinion concer∣ning the correspondency that ought in that respect to be betwixt Man and Wife, in these Words; If the Hot and Dry, answer not the Cold and Moist, in Measure and Quantity, that is if there meet in the Womb two Seeds, the one <HI>Hot,</HI> the other <HI>Cold</HI>; the one <HI>Dry,</HI> the other Moist, ex∣tended in equal Degree, there can be no Generation. For so marvellous a Work as the Formation of Man (says he) could
<PB N="176" REF="184"/>
not be performed without proportionable Commixture of Seed. To exemplifie this Assertion of his, the Ancient Physicians go on, and say, That a Woman, who is wilely, ill-conditioned, shrill-voic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, lean, swarthy-coloured and deformed; (which are the signs of <HI>Cold and Moist in the first Degree</HI>) may conceive by a Man who is ignorant, good-natur'd, sweet-voic'd▪ cor∣pulent, having little hair, a well-col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur'd Face, and a handsome Body, (which are the Signs of <HI>Hot and Dry in the first Degree</HI>) in regard she retaineth a mean in all those signs above-mentioned, is most like to be fruitful, because she comes nearest in pro∣portion to Men of each several Tempera∣ture. But from the first of these Unions or Conjoining of Man and Woman, are most likely to issue the wisest Children (say they) because the dryness of the Mother correcteth and amendeth the Defect of the Father. But this being chiefly grounded upon that old Opinion, of the Commix∣ture of the Seed of the Man and Woman together, and of the Child's being formed from thence we think fit to reject it, and to affirm, That Youth, Strength, and Vi∣gour, a sound body, and a Mind free from Cares, with a mutual Love and Amity betwixt the Man and Woman seldom fail of their desired Effects.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII. A Word of Advice to both Sexes in the Act of Copulation.</HEAD>
<P>THE Act of Copulation being ordai∣ned by Nature as the Ground of all Generation, and without which no Birth can be produced; somewhat must be said of it; but we shall cloath it in the modest Dress, that the chastest Ears may hear, without being put to the Trouble of a Blush.</P>
<P>It is convenient on this Occasion to che∣rish the Body with generous Restoratives, to charm the Imagination with Musick, to drown all Cares in good Wine; that so the Mind being elevated to a Pitch of Joy and Rapture, the sensual Appetite may be more freely encouraged to gratifie it self in the Delights of Nature: For Melancholy and Grief and whatsoever is troublesome to the Senses and Fancy, are Enemies to the Pastime of the Nuptial-Bed. Yet is it ne∣cessary to avoid Excesses in Eating and Drinking; for if the Body be over-charg'd with Wine or Meat, the Spirits will be∣come dull and unactive, and unable to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rform their Office. This you may take for a good Rule, That a little of what is
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>
good and well-digested, breeds good blood, good blood creates good Spirits, and when a Man is invigorated with a plentiful Stock of such, he is able to do Miracles. Also when the Husband and Wife meet with an equal Ardour in their conjugal Embraces, it is very rare if it be not at∣tended with Conception. But when that Act is over, all is not done; for, that it may have the better Suceess, the Husband must not presently seperate himself from his Wife's Embraces, lest the Air should suddenly strike in, and so prevent the Issue of their Labours.
