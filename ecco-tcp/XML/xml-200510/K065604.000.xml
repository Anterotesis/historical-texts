<HEAD>THE
Minute Mathematician, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Cambridge, <DATE>June 13, 1735.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Freely own to you, when I sat
down to write my defense of
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> and the Bri∣tish
Mathematicians, I was not
a little moved at the treatment
you had been pleased to give to one or two
of those Great Men, whom I am proud to call
my Master, and whose memories on that ac∣count
I shall always reverence and honour.
<HI>But now,</HI> you tell me, <HI>I may be supposed cool.</HI>
I am so: partly through the length of time
that has intervened; and partly by consider∣ing
the severity of the discipline you have
undergone. It has had, I see, a marvellous
effect upon you. One may plainly perceive
an alteration, notwithstanding your endea∣vours
to conceal it, not only in your senti∣ments,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
but in your language, your behaviour,
and your very air. You no longer breathe
that superiority and contempt of all mankind
you were wont to shew. This change in you
has greatly mitigated <HI>the passion</HI> with which I
was before <HI>overcome.</HI></P>
<P>In this calm and cool state therefore when
I reflect upon what is past, I am not a little
startled at my own audaciousness and pre∣sumption,
in entring the lists against so re∣doubtable
an adversary as the Author of the
Minute Philosopher. To you, likewise, I
find, this presumption of mine appeared so
extraordinary, that though you are so good as
to qualify it by the softer name of <HI>courage,
you could not but admire it, it seemed unaccount∣able
to you, till you reflected on my seeming se∣cure
in the favour of one part of my readers,
and the ignorance of the other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nevertheless you are persuaded there are fair
and candid men among the Mathematicians.</HI> I
likewise am persuaded not only that there are
fair and candid men among the Mathemati∣cians;
but that generally speaking Mathema∣ticians
are fair and candid men. What should
make them otherwise? Are their opinions di∣gested
into Creeds and Articles, and establish∣ed
by Law? Has the Publick thought fit to
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
bestow dignities and large possessions on
them, which are not to be obtained without
embracing those opinions, nor to be retained
without persevering in them? Were even
this the Case; yet surely there would be
found among them fair and candid men. I
am sure I know many such among another
set of men in these very circumstances.</P>
<P>Ay, but this other set of men, you will
say, have nothing but truth to defend. I
grant it. And I take this to be the case of
the Mathematicians likewise. They are at
least as good reasoners as any other set of
men whatsoever, and consequently are as
likely to know truth, when they meet it, and
have nothing to hinder them from embra∣cing
it. It is therefore on their judgment,
not their favour, that I depend.</P>
<P>But you speak of <HI>the ignorance of the other
part of my Readers.</HI> Alas! Sir, of what ad∣vantage
can that be to me? To me, <HI>Phila∣lethes,</HI>
who aim at truth alone, who have
no interest in deceiving them?</P>
<P>Were I indeed the Author of the Minute
Philosopher: <HI>Had</HI> I any <HI>other end to serve
than truth</HI>: Were I master of assurance e∣nough
to mislead my reader at the instant
that I call out to him to mind his way; to
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
desire him to examine, while I am misin∣forming
him; to throw dust in his eyes, and
bid him see: then undoubtedly much might
be done. But these are arts I neither need
nor practise. I content my self with the
plain honest way of giving my Reader the
best light I can, neither misleading him my
self, nor suffering him to be misled by others.
With this view it is that I divide my reply
into the same number of sections with your
defense, and confine my sections to the same
matter with yours. This will indeed make
what I have to say somewhat less methodical,
but then it will enable the Reader more ea∣sily
to compare us together, and to make a
more certain decision between us.</P>
<P>The taking this method, Sir, will make it
plainly appear, that what I aim at is only
manifesting the truth; and consequently that
the reason of my courage in encountering
you, is my being verily persuaded that I have
truth and justice on my side. I know and am
aware of your superior accomplishments:
But <HI>Philalethes</HI> is my name: And truth will
prevail against the pens of men or angels.
Your vanity has engaged you in a difficulty,
from which all your abilities shall never ex∣tricate
you.</P>
<Q><PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<L>Verte omnes tete in facies, &amp; contrahe quicquid</L><L>Sive animis, sive arte vales.</L></Q>
<P>Your arms are wedged in the oak you have
presumptuously attempted to rend: Your
strength is no longer of any use to defend
you: A woman, a child may be too hard
for you.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. Your second section teaches us, <HI>that
things obscure are not therefore sacred; and
that it is no more a crime to canvass and detect
unsound principles or false reasonings in Mathe∣maticks,
than in any other part of Learning.</HI>
I agree with you. I go farther. It can never
be a crime, but on the contrary is highly lau∣dable,
to canvass and to examine the princi∣ples
and reasoning made use of in any science
whatsoever, and that with the utmost free∣dom
and impartiality. All ingenuous minds
will be pleased with such an examination:
They will readily consent that the science
they profess, be brought to the severest and
strictest trial. Truth can never be hurt by
Inquiry: Truth loves the light: But error,
falshood and imposture dread and abhor it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P><PB N="6" REF="13"/>
III. I am much at a loss here. You speak
of<HI> men who reject that VERY THING in Reli∣gion
which they admit in human Learning.</HI> Do
they <HI>admit that Fluxions are</HI> to them <HI>most in∣comprehensible
Mysteries</HI>? Do they, notwith∣standing
this concession, <HI>believe them to be
clear and scientifick</HI>? Do they, notwithstand∣ing
this belief, <HI>entertain an implicit faith in
the Author of that Method</HI>? These things seem
hard to reconcile.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>IV. I do not ask, Why you chose to de∣fame
Mathematicians in the month of <HI>March,</HI>
<HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1734, rather than at any time be∣fore?
The only question with me was, Whe∣ther
Vanity or Christianity were the motive
to writing the Analyst. <HI>Quae relligio aut quae
machina belli?</HI> I have fully proved there was
no Religion, no Christianity in it. It was
partly Vanity, partly Machine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>V. Here I would observe, that whoever
admires Fluxions, must admire them for
something of excellence he sees in the Me∣thod
of Fluxions, and consequently cannot
justly be said to <HI>yield Faith</HI> to the Inventor
of that Method. But this whole section seems
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
to me to be matter of secret history and de∣clamation
of the worst sort, namely, the de∣famatory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>VI. More secret history and declamation,
partly about what no body denies, and part∣ly
about what no body believes. You give
us to understand, <HI>you have a right to examine
Fluxions, even though Religion were quite un∣concerned,
and though you had no end to serve
but Truth.</HI> No body disputes your right of
examining: but surely no good can be ex∣pected
from the examination of a Person
who has any end to serve but Truth, let that
end be what it will. But pray what is this
other end, this end different from Truth, that
you have to serve? It looks as if Religion
were meant. But I hope better things of
you, a Christian, and a Preacher of the Go∣spel.
Truth and the Christian Religion are
one. I profess I am greatly puzzled. <HI>I have
taken as much pains</HI> to understand this passage
as, I sincerely believe, you <HI>have done to make
sense of Sir</HI> Isaac Newton'<HI>s principles.</HI> A
friend of mine is of opinion the passage has
been corrupted either by the transcribers or
the printer, and bids me for <HI>Religion</HI> read
<HI>Promotion. Ita legendum censeo,</HI> says he, <HI>re∣clamantibus</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
<HI>centum</HI> Tonsonis. I am apt to
think he is in the right, partly because I take
him to be a very able Critick, and partly be∣cause
this emendation, though considerably
differing from the vulgar reading, serves to
confirm the proof I had before given, that
your end was neither Truth nor Religion.</P>
<P>You tell me I am very angry, and refer to
page 13 and 14 of my Defense. I have
looked over those pages to see what signs of
anger I have there shown, what injury, what
affront I have there offered you. All I can
find is, that I have proposed to you the ex∣ample
of our Saviour and of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> I
beg your pardon, Sir: I took you for one of
their followers.</P>
<P><HI>You will not take upon you to say you know
me to be a Minute Philosopher.</HI> I am much
obliged to you for this tenderness, and should
be more so, if it appeared that you knew so
much as one letter of my name. But it
seems, you would not be concerned if others
should take me to be such a one. You speak
of <HI>my spleen against the Clergy</HI>; and you tell
me <HI>the Minute Philosophers make just such com∣pliments
as I do to our Church.</HI> Here I appre∣hend
you mistake the compliments I make
to yourself, and a few of your credulous
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
friends, for compliments to the body of the
Clergy. I assure you, I look upon the body
of the Clergy as a body of learned and use∣ful
men. I know and am known to a great
many individuals among them, whom I
highly esteem and honour: I have spoke of
some of them in my Defence with singular
respect. If I laugh at any, it is at such as
think you do service to the Church in wri∣ting
the <HI>Analyst</HI>: If I dislike any, they are
such as are perpetually grasping at dominion
and riches. No wonder. I am a Layman.
If the Clergy obtain more power, I shall
have less liberty: If they will have more
wealth, I am one of those must pay to it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>VII. The chief purport of this section
seems to be to strengthen the proof you had
before given of the infidelity of Mathema∣ticians.
You had told us in the <HI>Analyst,</HI><HI>you were not a stranger to it: It was known:
You were credibly informed.</HI> Now you go far∣ther.
<HI>You make no doubt of it: You have seen
shrewed signs: You have been</HI> VERY <HI>credibly in∣formed.</HI>
Can any thing be plainer? I declare
myself fully satisfied with this proof, even
without the story told you by Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI>
of <HI>a witty man who was an Infidel,</HI> because
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
of <HI>the infidelity of a certain noted Mathema∣tician.</HI>
Surely this witty man was in jest; at
least he was no wise man.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8-10" TYPE="section">
<P>VIII, IX, X. In these three sections I
meet with nothing but declamation. The
subject of it is <HI>my passion and injustice, my
railing and raging, my rhetorick</HI> and writing
<HI>tragedy</HI>; your own sincerity and laudable en∣deavours
to do service to mathematical learn∣ing;
the <HI>proper respect</HI> you treat Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI> with, and the <HI>decency</HI> with which
you dissent from him. For which last the
reader is desired to have recourse to the <HI>Ana∣lyst,</HI>
particularly to the thirty-first Query,
where Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> is plainly charged
with writing nonsense.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>frightful visions and tragical up∣roars
about the Inquisition and the Gallows,</HI>
you may laugh at them as much as you
please: But I have heard of persons hanged
and burnt upon as slender evidence as that
which you bring against Mathematicians.
And what has been, may be: Especially if
the wholsome, ancient discipline should ever
be restored, which some persons say is much
to be wished. I confess I am not of their
mind: And I hope the body of the <HI>British</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
Laity see too plainly the use that would be
made of such a power, ever to trust you Gen∣tlemen
with it.</P>
<Q><L>Hoc regnum Dea gentibus esse,</L>
<L>Si qua fata sinant, jam jam tendit{que} fovet{que}</L></Q>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<P>XI. You say, you heartily abhor an Inqui∣sition
in Faith. Upon my word you have a
great deal of reason. You have been a grie∣vous
Free-thinker in your time: I do not
mean in Mathematicks only. As great a <HI>Bi∣got</HI>
as I am, possessed with <HI>the true spirit of
an Inquisitor,</HI> I assure you, I should be very
sorry that you and I were at the mercy of
some men I could name. They seem to me
to be singularly well qualify'd to preside in
the holy Office, and I doubt they would
make us confess that something else existed
in Nature besides SPIRIT AND IDEAS.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<P>XII. More declamation about my declaim∣ing,
and your own Modesty, and the <HI>compli∣ment</HI>
you pay <HI>to Sir Isaac Newton's Under∣standing.</HI>
But, Sir, I don't like that word
<HI>Sophism.</HI> It seems not very consistent with
the <HI>decency</HI> and <HI>proper respect</HI> you so lately
talked of.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13-16" TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
<P>XIII, XIV, XV, XVI. You tell me, <HI>The
adoration that I pay to Sir</HI> Isaac Newton,
<HI>you will pay only to truth: That I may be an
Idolater of whom I please; but I have no right
to insult and exclaim at other men, because they
do not adore my Idol: That I inveigh against
you, because you are not guilty of my mean Ido∣latry.</HI></P>
<Q><L>—To deify his power,</L>
<L>Who from the terror of this arm so late</L>
<L>Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed.</L></Q>
<P>Now give me leave to ask you a question.
Do you really and <HI>bona fide</HI> believe that I pay
idolatrous worship to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> that
I make him the object of that adoration
which you say you will pay only to truth,
and which I will pay only to the God of
truth? And this because I apply to Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> a Verse which an inferior Poet appli∣ed
to <HI>Virgil</HI>? Is <HI>adorare vestigia</HI> to be literal∣ly
taken, think you? What can be meant by
these <HI>vestigia</HI>? The mark of his foot in
<HI>Crane Court</HI>? Or the truths discovered by
him? If the last; to what purpose all this
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
declamation, and ridiculous rant about Ido∣latry
for four sections together?</P>
<Q>—Quo numine laeso?</Q>
<P>You seem to dislike my professing that <HI>the
highest honour I can ever arrive at, or even
desire, is in any the lowest degree to imitate
Sir</HI> Isaac Newton<HI>'s example.</HI> You think
<HI>It might have suited better with my appellation
of</HI> Philalethes, <HI>and been altogether as laudable,
if my highest ambition had been to discover
truth.</HI> Why so it is. The discovering of
truth, and his clear, candid, humane way of
making it known to Mankind, is the very
thing in which I should desire to imitate Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>You say, <HI>I speak of it as a sort of crime to
think it possible I should ever see farther, or go
beyond Sir</HI> Isaac Newton. <HI>But there are others
who think it no crime to desire to know not only
beyond Sir</HI> Isaac Newton, <HI>but beyond all Man∣kind.</HI>
You intimate your self to be one of these.
Now, Sir, I am for seeing as much beyond
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> as you can be: But first let
us see as far as he has done. I agree with you
in this desire of knowledge; make it as un∣bounded
as you please. I assure you I think
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
it no crime. The only difference between
us is this. You seem to think you have this
knowledge already. I am sensible I have it
not.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but such a Man as you,
or one much inferior to you, may carry a
particular point, or many particular points,
farther than Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has done.
But that such a Man as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> af∣ter
long consideration of one thing, after
touching and retouching it at different times
for above half a Century, after setting it in
several various lights, after applying it in an
infinite number of examples, after giving
several different demonstrations of it, such as
had satisfied all the Mathematicians in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
should all this while have taken error
for truth, and given <HI>Sophisms</HI> for demon∣strations,

<P>XVII. You begin this section with ad∣dressing
your self to me in the following
manner. "I have said (and I venture still to
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
say) that a fluxion is incomprehensible:
That second, third and fourth fluxions
are yet more incomprehensible: That it is
not possible to conceive a simple infinite∣simal:
That it is yet less possible to con∣ceive
an infinitesimal of an infinitesimal,
and so onward. What have you to say to
this?" Truly very little. Only I don't
well comprehend, how one incomprehensi∣ble
can be MORE incomprehensible than
another incomprehensible: How it can pos∣sibly
be LESS possible to conceive one thing
than to conceive another thing, which other
thing it is not at all possible to conceive.</P>
<P>For clearing up these assertions I have had
recourse, pursuant to your directions, to the
fourth section of the Analyst, which is the
only one relating to fluxions, of the three
you refer me to. But all the satisfaction I
there meet with is, That <HI>your imagination is
very much strained and puzzled</HI> with one
thing; That <HI>it seems still more difficult to con∣ceive</HI>
another thing; That a third <HI>seems an
obscure mystery</HI>; That a fourth <HI>exceeds, if you
mistake not, all human understanding</HI>; That
<HI>take</HI> another <HI>in what light one pleases, the
clear conception of it will, if you mistake not,
be found impossible.</HI> This to me seems to
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
amount to thus much. The Author of the
<HI>Minute Philosopher</HI> cannot comprehend the
principles of fluxions: Therefore no man
living can comprehend them. He cannot
understand them: Therefore they exceed
all human understanding. A notable proof
of my Hypothesis, that that Gentleman has
too good an opinion of himself, and too
mean a one of all other men.</P>
<P>You go on addressing your self to me;
<HI>Do you attempt to clear up the notion of a
fluxion? Nothing like it.</HI> Very true, nor did
I ever undertake it. Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has
done it incomparably well to those who are
qualified to read his Works, and thither I
refer you. May not I expose your blunders,
without pretending to explain his doctrine
better than he has done it himself?</P>
<P>But you tell me, <HI>I only assure you (upon my
bare word) from my own experience, and that
of several others whom I could name, that the
doctrine of fluxions may be clearly conceived and
distinctly comprehended.</HI> Why pray, Sir, what
did you require more? <HI>You appealed to the
trial of every thinking reader.</HI> I am one of
your <HI>thinking readers.</HI> I have made the <HI>trial</HI>
you desired. I acquaint you with the result
of that <HI>trial,</HI> and all the return you make
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
me is, <HI>Can you think I will take your word
when I refuse to take your Master's?</HI> I appeal
to all my thinking readers whether this be
civil usage. You say, you don't understand
fluxions. I say I do. I believe you: And
yet you won't believe me.</P>
<P>This, Sir, my judgment tells me is all the
answer I ought to make to the invitations you
so frequently give me upon this head. I am
sensible it were better to hold so slippery an
adversary to the points we have already in
hand, than before these are settled, to go up∣on
new matter. Besides, I am afraid of incur∣ring
the common fate of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s
interpreters, to be less intelligible than my
Master. I apprehend likewise that, let me
take ever so much pains to satisfy and oblige
you, I shall meet with no better usage than
when you appealed to me: That all the re∣turn
I am to expect is, <HI>Alas! I find no sense
or reason in what you say.</HI> And yet I am so
desirous of contributing my assistance to∣wards
your laudable design of <HI>putting this
controversy in such a light as that every reader
may judge thereof,</HI> that I think I must run
that hazard. But I desire it may be remem∣bred
that I do not here intend, nor indeed
think my self at all qualified to write a com∣plete
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
treatise of Fluxions, that being ex∣pected
from better hands. All that you re∣quire
of me is to shew that the principles of
Fluxions may be clearly conceived. This
therefore is what I shall endeavour to do, and
in order to render those principles as intelli∣gible
as I can, I shall make use of the plain∣est
and easiest example possible, that I may
give my Reader no other trouble than only
that of comprehending the principles them∣selves.</P>
<P>The foundation of the Method of Fluxions
I take to be contained in the following</P>

<P N="4">4. A nascent increment is an increment
just beginning to exist from nothing, or just
beginning to be generated, but not yet ar∣rived
at any assignable magnitude how small
soever. An evanescent increment is the same
thing as a nascent increment, but only con∣sidered
in a different manner, as by a conti∣nual
diminution becoming less than any
assignable quantity, and at last vanishing in∣to
nothing, or ceasing to exist.</P>

<HEAD>Explanation of the Postulatum by an example.</HEAD>
<P>If a point as <HI>A</HI> move in one direction from
<HI>A</HI> to <HI>B</HI> with a continued motion, it will de∣scribe
and generate the right line <HI>AB.</HI>

it will describe, and may thereby be sup∣posed
to destroy or annihilate the same

<HEAD>The definitions explained by the same example.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. While the generating point is in mo∣tion
either way, the line described by it is
called a flowing line. This flowing line per∣petually
increases, while the generating point
is moving in the direction <HI>AB,</HI> and perpe∣tually
decreases, while the generating point
is moving in the direction <HI>BA.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The velocity with which the genera∣ting
point moves either way, or the velocity
with which the flowing line increases or de∣creases,
is called the fluxion of the flowing
line. <HI>Ex. gr.</HI> The velocity of the generating
point in <HI>C</HI> is called the fluxion of the flow∣ing
line <HI>AC</HI>; and the velocity of the gene∣rating
point in <HI>B</HI> is the fluxion of the flowing
line <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If in a very small particle of time the
generating point move from <HI>C</HI> to <HI>c,</HI> or from
<HI>c</HI> to <HI>C,</HI> the small line <HI>Cc</HI> is in the first case cal∣led
the increment of the flowing line <HI>AC</HI>;
and in the second case is called the decrement
of the flowing line <HI>Ac.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. When the generating point, in descri∣bing
the line <HI>AB,</HI> is arrived at the point <HI>C,</HI>
and proceeds from thence towards <HI>B</HI>: At the
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
instant of time that it sets out or departs from
the point <HI>C,</HI> at that very instant of time an
increment begins to be generated, or begins
to exist, which therefore is properly called a
nascent increment. And as the generating
point at that instant of time is supposed to be
just setting out, and not as yet to have moved
to the least imaginable distance from the
point <HI>C,</HI> nor consequently to have generated
the least imaginable increment, it is plain that
the nascent increment here considered will
be less than any quantity that can be assigned.</P>
<P>In like manner when the generating point
returns back from <HI>c</HI> to <HI>C,</HI> in order to annihi∣late
the increment <HI>cC,</HI> that increment will
continually grow less and less, will become
less than any assignable quantity, and will at
last entirely vanish and become nothing by
the return of the generating point to the
point <HI>C.</HI> At that instant of time therefore
that the generating point returns to <HI>C,</HI> at
that very instant I say the increment vanishes,
and therefore is then properly called an
evanescent increment.</P>
<P>Behold good Reader, the <HI>difficult,</HI> the <HI>ob∣scure,</HI>
the <HI>mysterious,</HI> the <HI>incomprehensible</HI> prin∣ciples
of Fluxions! I am much mistaken if
a little attention do not enable thee clearly
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
to conceive them. When thou hast done
this, then wilt thou be rightly prepared for
understanding the following fundamental
proposition, upon which Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
has established his Method of Fluxions: the
whole business of which Method is, from
the proportion between the Fluxions, or be∣tween
the nascent increments, of flowing
quantities, to determine the proportion be∣tween
the flowing quantities themselves;
<HI>&amp; vice versa.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>The Fluxions, or Velocities, of flowing
quantities are very nearly as the increments
of those flowing quantities, generated in very
small equal particles of time: And they are
exactly in the first proportion of the nascent
increments, or in the last proportion of the
evanescent increments.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="demonstration">
<HEAD>DEMONSTRATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If the velocities are uniform, it is
plain that the increments generated in any
equal times must be as those velocities.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="30"/>
2. And if the velocities are not uniform,
but are perpetually changing, yet in a very
small particle of time their change will be
very little, and the increments will be very
nearly the same as if the velocities were
uniform, <HI>i. e.</HI> the increments will be very
nearly as the velocities with which they begin
to be generated.</P>
<P N="3">3. And as the first ratio of the nascent in∣crements
must be the same, whether the ve∣locities
be uniform or variable, it follows
that the nascent increments must be exactly
as the velocities with which they begin to be
generated. <HI>Q. E. D.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, I must beg leave to observe to
you, that if Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> had proceeded
no farther than the first part of this proposi∣tion,
and had contented himself with esta∣blishing
the proportion between the incre∣ments
and their velocities very nearly, with∣out
going to the utmost exactness, yet his
Method had been no less scientifical and no
less demonstrative than it now is. Conse∣quently
you were very much overseen in
charging him and his followers with pro∣ceeding
blindfold, and not knowing what
they were doing, even though you had suc∣ceeded
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
in proving that his Method did not
come up to the rigor of Geometry.</P>
<P>To prevent cavils, I must farther observe
that the third part of this demonstration
might easily be put into a more diffusive
form, and might be deduced step by step
from the <HI>Methodus rationum primarum &amp; ul∣timarum.</HI>
But this at present is no way ne∣cessary,
especially as you admit the proposi∣tion
to be true. All that I have to do there∣fore
is to explain it a little more particularly,
and this I shall be the more careful in doing;
because this proportion of nascent or evane∣scent
increments is what I apprehend, you
are so often pleased to call a proportion be∣tween
nothings. With what justice you do
so the Reader may easily judge, if he gives
himself the trouble of considering what
follows.</P>
<P>In the first place, and above all, it is here
to be diligently attended to, that Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI> no where settles or determines the
magnitude of nascent or evanescent incre∣ments
any farther than to say it is less than
any finite magnitude. On the contrary, he
expresly declares that their magnitude can∣not
be assigned or determined. Nor indeed
has he any occasion to determine their mag∣nitude,
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
but only the proportion between
them, this being all that is requisite in his
Method.</P>
<P>Now the proportion between two evane∣scent
increments is easily to be conceived,
though the absolute magnitude of those in∣crements
is utterly imperceptible to the ima∣gination.
For those increments may be ex∣pounded
or represented by any two finite
quantities bearing the same proportion to
one another: And as these finite quantities
may be clearly conceived, the proportion
between them may likewise be clearly con∣ceived,
<HI>i. e.</HI> the proportion of the evane∣scent
increments may be clearly conceived
by this means. Of this several examples
may be found in Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s <HI>Methodus ratio∣num
primarum &amp; ultimarum,</HI> and one in imi∣tation
of him may be seen in this Letter, Sect.
XXXII.</P>
<P>This being premised, I come now to il∣lustrate
and explain the Proposition, to
which end I shall make use of the following
easy example.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
Let the right

line <HI>AbB,</HI> di∣vided
into two
equal parts in
the point <HI>b,</HI>
revolve about
the point <HI>A,</HI> and with any continued motion,
even or uneven, remove into the situation
<HI>AcC.</HI> Then will the points <HI>B</HI> and <HI>b</HI> describe
the circular arcs <HI>BC, bc:</HI> The velocity of
the point <HI>B</HI> will be always double of the ve∣locity
of the point <HI>b:</HI> The arc <HI>BC</HI> will be
double of the arc <HI>bc:</HI> And the increment
<HI>BD</HI> will be double of the increment <HI>bd.</HI>
In all this there is no difficulty between us.</P>
<P>I say farther, The nascent or evanescent
increment of the arc <HI>BC</HI> is double of the
nascent or evanescent increment of the arc
<HI>bc.</HI> This you won't understand. I explain
it thus, beginning first with the nascent in∣crements.</P>
<P>As soon as the line <HI>AbB</HI> begins to revolve
upon the point <HI>A,</HI> and thereby begins to de∣part
from the situation <HI>AbB</HI>; at that instant
of time do the points <HI>B</HI> and <HI>b</HI> begin to gene∣rate
their several increments. And as the
velocity of the point <HI>B</HI> is always double of
the velocity of the point <HI>b,</HI> it is manifest that
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
the increment of the arc <HI>BC</HI> begins to be
generated with twice the velocity that the
increment of the arc <HI>bc</HI> begins to be gene∣rated
with; <HI>i.e.</HI> that the nascent increment
of <HI>BC</HI> is generated with twice the velocity
that the nascent increment of <HI>bc</HI> is generated
with; and consequently that the former
nascent increment is by this proposition
double of the latter nascent increment.</P>
<P>To come now to the evanescent incre∣ments,
let us suppose the line <HI>AbB</HI> to have
removed into the situation <HI>AdD</HI> very near
to <HI>AbB,</HI> whereby the increments <HI>BD, bd</HI>
have been generated. Next let us imagine
the line <HI>AbD</HI> to return gradually to its first
situation <HI>AbB,</HI> and thereby let the incre∣ments
<HI>BD, bd</HI> grow continually less and
less, and at last entirely vanish and become
nothing. Then as the first of these two incre∣ments
is double of the second, and decreases
twice as fast as the second, it must perpe∣tually
bear the same proportion to the se∣cond;
and consequently the last proportion
of these two increments, their proportion at
the instant of evanescence will be the same as
at first, namely that of 2 to 1. You tell
me, when they vanish, they become nothing.
I allow it. You say, to talk of a proportion
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
between nothings is to talk nonsense. I a∣gree
with you. But their last proportion is
not their proportion after they are vanished
and are become nothing: It is their propor∣tion
when they vanish: It is the proportion
with which they vanish.</P>
<P>You will tell me, perhaps, this is unintel∣ligible.
I expect it. I ask you therefore,
which vanishes first? The increments them∣selves?
Or the proportion between them?
I think, Sir, even you will not venture to say,
that the increments vanish before their pro∣portion
vanishes; or that the proportion va∣nishes
before the increments vanish. If so;
we are agreed thus far, that the increments
vanish and their proportion vanishes at one
and the same instant of time. This propor∣tion
therefore which vanishes at the same in∣stant
of time that the increments vanish, is
the proportion with which the increments
vanish, or, in other words, is the last pro∣portion
of the evanescent increments.</P>
<P>This, I hope, will appear sufficiently
clear to an attentive Reader: But for his
farther satisfaction I shall beg leave to lay
before him another example.</P>
<P>Let the point <HI>A</HI> with a given uniform ve∣locity
describe or generate the flowing line <FIGURE>
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
</FIGURE>
<HI>AB:</HI> And let the point <HI>D</HI> with a velocity
continually increasing describe or generate
the flowing line <HI>DE:</HI> Also let both points
arrive at the line <HI>CF,</HI> (cutting the two flow∣ing
lines) at the same instant of time, and
with velocities exactly equal.</P>
<P>Then it is plain, that if we take two in∣crements
<HI>Ff, Cc,</HI> generated in the same
particle of time, <HI>Ff</HI> will a little exceed <HI>Cc.</HI>
But if we suppose the generating points to
return towards the line <HI>CF,</HI> and their re∣spective
velocities in every point of the incre∣ments
<HI>Ff, Cc,</HI> to be the very same in re∣turning
as they had been before in proceed∣ing
from the line <HI>CF</HI>; it is manifest that the
more the increments are diminished by the
gradual return of the generating points to∣wards
the line <HI>CF,</HI> the nearer will the pro∣portion
between them approach to that of a
perfect equality. This is easily conceived,
and admits of no dispute.</P>
<P>Farther, if the generating points be supposed
to return exactly to the line <HI>CF,</HI> and there∣by
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
by the increments vanish and become no∣thing;
the ratio with which the increments
vanish into nothing, or the last proportion
of the evanescent increments, will be that of
a perfect equality. For, as during the time
that the generating points are returning to∣wards
the line <HI>CF,</HI> the increments <HI>Ff, Cc</HI>
are continually more and more diminished,
and the velocities with which the increments
decrease, approach more and more to the
ratio of equality; so at the instant of time
that those points actually arrive at the line
<HI>CF,</HI> at that same instant the increments en∣tirely
vanish, and at the very same instant
the velocities with which they decrease
and in decreasing vanish, arrive at the ra∣tio
of perfect equality: which therefore is
the ratio of the velocities with which the in∣crements
vanish, and consequently, by this
proposition, is the ratio of the evanescent
increments.</P>
<P>It is to be carefully attended to, that the
proportion here given as the proportion of
the evanescent increments, is not their pro∣portion
before they vanish. For then <HI>Ff</HI>
will exceed <HI>Cc.</HI> Nor is it their proportion
after they have vanished. For then they are
become nothing and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proportion.
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
But it is their proportion at the instant that
they vanish, or the proportion with which
they vanish.</P>
<P>I might observe farther, that as the incre∣ments
do not come to this proportion before
they vanish, so neither do they vanish before
they come to this proportion: but at one and
the same instant of time they come to this
proportion and vanish, they vanish and come
to this proportion. But I am now afraid I
have taken up too much of my reader's
time in explaining a point sufficiently clear
before.</P>

instead of fairly giving Sir <HI>Isaac

of a second Fluxion, you are pleased to lay
down three or four definitions of your own,
as obscure, mysterious and absurd as you
can possibly devise.</P>
<Q><L>Eripiunt subito nubes coelumque diemque</L>
<L>Lectorum ex oculis.</L></Q>
<P>After which <HI>you appeal to the trial of every
thinking reader, whether the clear Conception
of them is not impossible.</HI> This I had taken
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
notice of as a pious art of misleading and
confounding your reader, instead of instruct∣ing
him, and had put the two following
questions to you, which I shall here tran∣scribe
at large; because with another pious
art you have thought fit to truncate the one,
and to leave out the other, for particular
reasons which I shall by and by lay before
the reader. Where, said I, do you find
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> using such expressions as
<HI>the velocities of the velocities, the second,
third and fourth velocities, the incipient ce∣lerity
of an incipient celerity, the nascent aug∣ment
of a nascent augment</HI>? Is this the true
and genuine meaning of the words <HI>fluxionum
mutationes magis aut minus celeres</HI>?</P>
<P>To these two Questions you are sensible
it is incumbent upon you to seem to give an
answer, and you are likewise sensible you
have none to give. In this <HI>perplexity</HI> it is wor∣thy
the observation of a curious reader to see
<HI>what arts and shifts a great Genius may be
driven to in grappling with an insuperable diffi∣culty.</HI></P>
<P>In the first place you curtail my first que∣stion,
cutting off the latter part of it with an
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> By this means you hide from your rea∣der
one of your definitions, and that the least
justifiable of them all, namely <HI>the incipient</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
<HI>celerity of an incipient celerity.</HI> There's one
difficulty cleverly got over.</P>
<P>In the next place you entirely cut off my
second question. In which I find you have
two advantages. The first is to avoid giving
an answer to it. The second, not to let your
reader see Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s definition,
which I had inserted into that question.</P>
<P>But setting all this aside, after you have
proposed my question in your own manner,
what answer do you give to it? Do you
shew me where Sir <HI>I. N.</HI> uses such expres∣sions?
No. You don't pretend to it. What
then? Why truly you endeavour to shew,
by comparing together two independent Pas∣sages
taken from two different treatises of
Sir <HI>I. N.</HI> that you may justifiably call a se∣cond
fluxion so and so. Be it so: Though I
think otherwise. Yet still this will only
shew that a definition of your own may be
used; but will not shew it to be Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI>'s definition, nor to be equally clear
with Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s definition. There∣fore
the <HI>pious art</HI> I at first mentioned, still
subsists with the addition of two or three
more pious arts to support it, as it generally
happens when such arts come to be exami∣ned
into by any of our family of <HI>Philalethes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44"/>
In order to get out of this <HI>Egyptian</HI> dark∣ness
in which you have studiously involved
the matter in debate, as well as to complete
what I had begun in my seventeenth section
towards clearing up the first principles of
fluxions, I shall now endeavour to give my
reader and you too, Sir, if you please, a
clear and intelligible conception not only of
second, but of third, fourth and fifth fluxi∣ons,
<HI>&amp;c. ad infinitum,</HI> upon the foot of Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s definition of second fluxions.</P>
<Q><L>Adspice, nam{que} omnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti</L>
<L>Mortales visus hebetat tibi, &amp; humida circum</L>

<P>That great Man making use of the liberty
which has always been allowed to Inventors,
of giving new names to new conceptions,
and of defining those names as they thought
fit, has been pleased to call by the name of
fluxion, the velocity with which a flowing
quantity increases or decreases. If this velo∣city
do not always continue the same, but
undergo any change, the velocity of that
change is called a fluxion of a fluxion, or a se∣cond
fluxion; and as the change is swifter or
slower, the second fluxion is said to be greater
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
or less. For instance, if the first fluxion or
velocity of the flowing quantity continually
increase, the second fluxion is the velocity
with which the first velocity increases, and
is proportional to the momentaneous increase
of that first velocity.</P>
<P>In like manner the third fluxion is the ve∣locity
of the change of the second fluxion;
the fourth fluxion is the velocity of the
change of the third; the fifth the velocity
of the change of the fourth, <HI>&amp;c. ad infini∣tum.</HI></P>
<P>Here perhaps it may not be amiss to assist
the reader's imagination by representing the
proportions betwen fluxions of all the several
orders in a sensible manner. I say their pro∣portions:
for, as I said before, Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI> makes no enquiry into, nor ever
considers the absolute magnitude of fluxions,
or moments, or nascent increments, but on∣ly
the proportion between them. And this
I desire may be carefully remembred.</P>

velocity with which it flows, will be the
fluxion of the fluxion 2<HI>F,</HI> or the second

fluxion of the line <HI>A.</HI> And it is visible that

<P>Observing the same analogy, let 1<HI>f</HI> repre∣sent
the first fluxion of the flowing line <HI>a:</HI>
2<HI>f,</HI> the first fluxion of 1<HI>f,</HI> or the second
fluxion of the line <HI>a:</HI> 3<HI>f</HI> the first fluxion of

<P>Then is it manifest that the proportion
between the first fluxion of <HI>A</HI> and the first

<P>XXIV, XXV, XXVI. I do not remem∣ber
to have met with a greater instance of
distingenuity and wilful misrepresentation in
any controversy I have ever looked into,
than what the reader will observe to run
through these three sections. You had in the
Analyst charged the Mathematicians with
unjustly omitting a certain rectangle in their
computation of the increment of the rectan∣gle
of two flowing quantities, and thereupon
had thought fit to represent them as <HI>not pro∣ceeding
scientifically,</HI> as <HI>not seeing their way
distinctly,</HI> as <HI>proceeding blindfold,</HI> as <HI>arriving
at the truth they know not how nor by what
means,</HI> with abundance of the like compli∣ments
plentifully dispersed all over the
Analyst.</P>
<P>To this I had replied, First, that this
omission, at the worst, could not cause them
to deviate from the truth the least imaginable
quantity, in computing the most immense
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
magnitude: Secondly, that as they clearly
saw and could plainly demonstrate this insig∣nificancy
of the omission, they could not
justly be said to proceed blindfold: Thirdly,
that this pretended error or omission of theirs
was only a blunder of your own.</P>
<P>In answer to this, you spend three sections
in endeavouring to make your reader believe,
that the main stress of my defence of Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton</HI> and his followers is, That this
error of theirs is <HI>of no significancy in practice</HI>;
without taking the least notice of the second
part of my reply, and barely mentioning the
third. Upon this you declaim very abun∣dantly
in the style which the Learned call the
tautological.</P>
<P>You tell me, and it might have been suffi∣cient
once to have told me, that <HI>the applica∣tion
in gross practice is not the point questioned.</HI>
I grant it is not. Why then have I said so
much about the smallness of the error? I
will even tell you the plain truth. Though,
as you take notice, I <HI>live in the university,</HI>
yet I have been in <HI>London</HI> too, and <HI>am</HI> a little
<HI>acquainted with the humour of the times and the
characters of men.</HI> Now, Sir, I had ob∣served
some of those Gentlemen, who are
not greatly pleased that other Persons should
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
be possessed of any learning, which they
themselves have not, to be not a little tick∣led
with the rebuke that you had given to
the <HI>pride of Mathematicians</HI>: I found them
curious to know what this discovery was,
that was like to do so much service to the
Church: I did my best to give them satis∣faction,
and to let them see the greatness
and importance of it. They see it plainly,
and apply the old saying, <HI>Parturiunt montes.</HI></P>
<P>One of them indeed could make nothing
of what I had said about the length of a
subtangent, or the magnitude of the orb of
the fixed stars; but was fully satisfied by
the information given him by one of his ac∣quaintance
to the following effect. The
Author of the Minute Philosopher has found
out that, if Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> were to mea∣sure
the height of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church by
Fluxions, he would be out about three quar∣ters
of a hair's breadth: But yonder is one
<HI>Philalethes</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who pretends that
Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> would not be out above the tenth
part of a hair's breadth. Hearing this, and
that two books had been written in this
controversy, the honest Gentleman flew in∣to
a great passion, and after muttering some∣thing
to himself about some body's being
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
overpaid, he went on making reflections,
which I don't care to repeat, as not being
much for your honour or mine, any more
than for that of another person, whom I too
highly reverence to name upon this occasion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="section">
<P>XXVII. Now, gentle Reader, we come
to the point. You are to be shown the first
instance of <HI>my courage in affirming with such
undoubting assurance things so easily disproved.</HI>
My antagonist <HI>intreats you to observe how
fairly I proceed.</HI> I desire you to be upon
your guard, to look well about you. After
this, if either of us endeavour to throw dust
in your eyes, knock him down: Which∣soever
of us shall attempt to falsify the
words of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> or those of his
opponent, to the Pump, to the <HI>Thames,</HI>
to the <HI>Liffy</HI> with him, pump him, duck
him for a Pickpocket. The dispute here is
about a matter of fact, and I will endeavour
to state the case so plainly, that it shall be
impossible either to mistake or to evade it.</P>
<P>In Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s demonstration of
the rule for finding the moment of the re∣ctangle
of two flowing quantities, mention
is made of three several rectangles, to each
of which the flowing rectangle is equal, at
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
three different times, or in three different
states.</P>
<P>The first of these is the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>−½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−½<HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>The second is the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the rectangle <HI>A</HI>+½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>+½<HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>I had observed, Sir, that you were mi∣staken
in taking it for granted, that what
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> was endeavouring to find
by the suppositions made in this demonstra∣tion,
was the increment of the second of
these rectangles, the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> The
reason I gave for supposing you in a mistake,
was expressed in the following words. "For
neither in the demonstration it self, nor
in any thing preceding or following it,
is any mention so much as once made of
the increment of the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI>" This
therefore is a matter of fact that you dispute
with me: But how you dispute it, is worth
observing. It greatly imports you to con∣tradict
me, and yet you cannot, you dare
not contradict what I say. Notwithstanding
this you will contradict me. Methinks I see
my reader stare. I shall be taken for a Mad∣man:
And yet I speak the words of truth
and soberness. <HI>I affirm,</HI> say you, <HI>the direct
contrary.</HI> Contrary to what? To what I
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
have said? No. You cannot, you dare not
do it. Your reader would immediately turn
to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> and detect you. But you
can first alter what I say, and then contra∣dict
me. Instead of my words alone, you can
give the reader other words which are not
mine, and yet are so intermixed with mine
and distinguished by inverted comma's, that
every reader shall take them for mine; and
then you can <HI>affirm the direct contrary.</HI> You
cannot say Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> makes mention
of the increment of the rectangle <HI>AB:</HI> But
you can affirm that he makes mention of the
rectangle <HI>of such flowing quantities:</HI> That he
makes express mention of the increment of
<HI>such rectangle:</HI> Of the increment of <HI>that
rectangle whose sides have</HI> a <HI>and</HI> b <HI>for their
incrementa tota:</HI> That he understands his <HI>in∣crementum</HI>
as belonging to the <HI>rectangulum
quodvis.</HI> You go on declaiming about <HI>the
words, the sense, the context, the conclusion
of the demonstration</HI> and <HI>the thing to be de∣monstrated:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Involvere diem nubes, nox humida coelum</L>
<L>Abstulit.—</L></Q>
<P>And when the reader has lost all sight of the
point in question, you <HI>refer it to his own eyes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="54"/>
I refer it to him likewise, and reply to
all you have here said, that the first of the
three rectangles mentioned above, namely
the rectangle <HI>A</HI>−½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−½<HI>b</HI> is the re∣ctangle
of two flowing quantities, but is
not the rectangle <HI>AB</HI>; is a rectangle whose
sides have <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for their <HI>incrementa tota,</HI>
but is not the rectangle <HI>AB</HI>; is the <HI>rectan∣gulum
quodvis</HI> in its first state, but still is not
the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> The question is, as
your self declare, about <HI>matter of fact.</HI> It
is not therefore about what Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI>
means, but what he mentions: Not a∣bout
what he understands, but what he
declares: Not about his sense, but his
words. And in all his words throughout
this demonstration and every thing prece∣ding
and following it, I affirm and aver that
he does not so much as once mention the in∣crement
of the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> Deny it, if
you dare.</P>

<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="section">
<P>XXVIII. You tell me, <HI>I would fain per∣plex
this plain case by distinguishing between an</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
<HI>increment and a moment. But it is evident
to every one, who has any notion of demonstra∣tion,
that the</HI> incrementum <HI>in the conclusion
must be the</HI> momentum <HI>in the Lemma; and
to suppose it otherwise is no credit to the Author.</HI>
Now, Sir, to shew you how little I am in∣clined
to <HI>perplex the case,</HI> I hereby declare
that I absolutely and fully agree with you
that the <HI>incrementum</HI> in the conclusion is the
<HI>momentum</HI> in the Lemma. Let us now see
whither this our agreement will lead us.</P>
<P>The <HI>momentum</HI> in the Lemma we both
agree to be the <HI>momentum</HI> of the rectangle
<HI>AB.</HI> The <HI>incrementum</HI> in the conclusion
is manifestly the excess of the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>+½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>+½<HI>b,</HI> above the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>−½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−½<HI>b,</HI> i.e. the increment of the
rectangle <HI>A</HI>−½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−½<HI>b.</HI> Therefore we
are agreed that the moment of the rectangle
<HI>AB</HI> is the increment of the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>−½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−½<HI>b.</HI> Consequently you were
mistaken in supposing that the moment of
the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> was the increment of the
same rectangle <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>You quote Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s words a∣gainst
me to shew that a moment is an in∣crement
or decrement. Why Sir! You
make me stare. Did not I plainly tell you
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
in my defence that the moment of <HI>AB</HI>
was an increment? Did not I likewise tell
you what increment it was, namely the in∣crement
of <HI>A</HI>−½<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−½<HI>b</HI>? If you will
be pleased to put on your mathematical
spectacles, or rather to put on the ingenuity
of a Scholar and a Gentleman, (for your
eyes are good enough) you will plainly see
that the distinction I make, is not between a
moment in general and an increment in ge∣neral,
but between a particular moment and
a particular increment, between the mo∣ment
of the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> and the increment
of the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> i.e. the excess of the
rectangle <HI>A</HI>+<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>+<HI>b</HI> above the rectangle
<HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>Observe me well, Sir, what I have affirm∣ed,
and what I still affirm, and what before
I have done, I shall prove past a possibility
of being denied, is this. The moment of
<HI>AB</HI> is neither the increment nor the decre∣ment
of <HI>AB</HI>; neither the excess of <HI>A</HI>+<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>+<HI>b</HI> above <HI>AB</HI>; nor the defect of <HI>A</HI>−<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−<HI>b</HI> from <HI>AB.</HI> This seems to you <HI>a won∣derful</HI>
assertion. But one of yours, which
you call a <HI>very plain and easy</HI> one, is to me
much more wonderful.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="57"/>
I asked, which of these two quantities,
the increment of <HI>AB,</HI> or the decrement of
<HI>AB,</HI> you would be pleased to call the mo∣ment
of <HI>AB</HI>? Your answer is, <HI>Either of
them.</HI> This to me is a very wonderful an∣swer
for so great and so accurate a Mathema∣tician
to make, and if I have not quite for∣got
my Logick, I shall draw as wonderful
an inference from it. The moment of <HI>AB</HI>
is equal to the increment of <HI>AB:</HI> The same
moment of <HI>AB</HI> is equal to the decrement
of <HI>AB. Ergo,</HI> the increment of <HI>AB</HI> is e∣qual
to the decrement of <HI>AB.</HI> That is,
<HI>Ab</HI>+<HI>Ba</HI>+<HI>ab</HI>=<HI>Ab</HI>+<HI>Ba</HI>−<HI>ab,</HI> i.e.
2<HI>ab</HI>=<HI>o.</HI> Therefore the rectangle <HI>ab,</HI> a∣bout
which the Author of the Minute Phi∣losopher
has made such a pother, is by his
own confession equal to nothing.</P>
<P>Your example in numbers does by no
means come up to our case. I shall beg leave
to state it a little more pertinently. It is a∣greed
that all numbers are either odd, or e∣ven.
Upon this you pronounce an unknown
number to be even, without giving any rea∣son
for it. I represent to you that, since the
number is unknown, it may as well be odd
as even; and therefore to pronounce it either
the one or the other, without any reason for
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
so doing, is no better, and no more like an A∣rithmetician,
than to toss up cross or pile
what you shall call it. You may call this
mirth, if you please; but the argument is
not the less strong against you for this seem∣ing
levity.</P>
<P>Nor is the accommodation I proposed in
the dispute between an increment and a de∣crement
for the title of moment, at all the
less reasonable for being delivered in a ludi∣crous
manner, under which other persons
can plainly discern a serious argument, and I
perceive you find it much easier to rally than
to answer that argument. To say truth,
there is no answer to be given to it; it is a
demonstration against you as strong as any in
<HI>Euclid,</HI> that the moment of the rectangle
<HI>AB</HI> is a middle arithmetical proportional
between the increment and decrement of the
same rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> If so;</P>
<Q>Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?</Q>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="section">
<P>XXIX. You are pleased to take notice
that <HI>I very candidly represent my case to be that
of an Ass between two pottles of hay.</HI> I find
by this you are duly sensible of my candour.
Had I been less candid, you see plainly I had
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
a fair occasion of representing another per∣son
in that perplexity, who might not have
had a Ghost so ready at hand to help him out.</P>
<P>The question with me was, Whether the
velocity of the flowing rectangle <HI>AB</HI> was
the velocity with which the increment, or
the velocity with which the decrement, of
the same rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> might be generated?
I could see no possibility of a reason to deter∣mine
me either way. This led me to fix up∣on
a middle arithmetical proportional be∣tween
these two velocities, for the velocity
of the rectangle <HI>AB:</HI> As I had before shewn
its moment to be a middle arithmetical pro∣portional
between the increment and decre∣ment.
But you, who talk so much of rea∣soning
and logick, and who set up for the
great and sole Master of the <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Geome∣trica,
are of opinion that either of these veloci∣ties
may be deemed the velocity</HI> of the rectangle
<HI>AB.</HI> That is, in your opinion, of two un∣equal
velocities, either the one, or the other,
may be deemed equal to a third velocity;
or two velocities may be deemed equal and
unequal at the same time.</P>
<P>You tell me, <HI>For your part, in the rectan∣gle</HI>
AB <HI>considered simply in itself, without ei∣ther
increasing or diminishing, you can conceive</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
<HI>no velocity at all.</HI> Nor I neither. But in
the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> considered as flowing,
whether increasing or diminishing, I can
conceive some velocity or other: And if it
flow with an accelerated velocity; I can con∣ceive
that velocity to be different in every
point of time: And if we suppose the incre∣ment
of the rectangle to be generated in a
given particle of time, and the decrement of
the same rectangle to be generated in ano∣ther
equal particle of time; I can conceive
the uniform velocity that would generate the
increment in the given time, to exceed the
uniform velocity that would generate the de∣crement
in the same time: And these two ve∣locities
being unequal, I can conceive an a∣rithmetical
mean between them; in like
manner as I had before supposed an arithme∣tical
mean between the increment and decre∣ment
of <HI>AB,</HI> which mean is the moment of
<HI>AB:</HI> And lastly, while <HI>AB</HI> flows, I can con∣ceive
that the first arithmetical mean is con∣stantly
proportional to the last, <HI>i.e.</HI> that the
velocity of <HI>AB</HI> is proportional to the mo∣ment
of <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>Upon my asserting that the moment of the
rectangle <HI>AB</HI> is neither the increment nor
decrement of that same rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> you
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
tell me this is <HI>in direct opposition to what Sir</HI>
Isaac <HI>himself has asserted</HI> in a passage you
quote from him, and you <HI>bid the reader not
believe you, but believe his eyes.</HI> Now certain∣ly
would any reasonable man, that did not
thoroughly know the Author of the Minute
Philosopher, conclude that I denied what is
expressed in the passage here quoted against
me, <HI>viz.</HI> that moments are either increments
or decrements; that increments are affirma∣tive
moments, and decrements are negative
moments. Little would any one imagine
from the assurance with which you here ex∣press
yourself, that all I maintain is, as I
said a while ago, That one particular deter∣mined
moment is not one particular deter∣mined
increment. But your chicaneries are
so many, so gross, and every way so shame∣ful
for a Scholar, a Gentleman, and above
all for one professing piety and christian zeal,
that I grow weary of exposing and refuting
them. I solemnly aver, that after I have de∣tected
so many, almost in every paragraph of
your Reply, I have knowingly and volunta∣rily
passed by many more, particularly those
scandalous ones of almost perpetually chang∣ing
the Words I use, for others that seem to
make more for your advantage. One would

<P>But, in the name of falshood, what is the
meaning of this question? Would you have
me tell you, what a Moment is? Or, what
the magnitude of a Moment is? If the for∣mer;
I tell you what Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has
told you before, a moment is a momenta∣neous,
or nascent increment, proportional
to the velocity of the flowing quantity. If
the latter; I have no business at all to con∣sider
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
the magnitude of a moment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Princ. Lib. 11. Lemm. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Neque
enim spectatur,</HI> says Sir <HI>Isaac Newton, mag∣nitudo
momentorum, sed prima nascentium pro∣portio.</HI>
I may tell you farther, that the
magnitude of a moment is nothing fixed nor
determinate, is a quantity perpetually fleet∣ing
and altering till it vanishes into nothing;
in short, that it is utterly unassignable.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Princ. Lib. 1. Sect. 1. Schol.</NOTE>
<HI>Dantur ultimae quantitatum evanescentium
rationes, non dantur ultimae magnitudines.</HI></P>
<P>You seem much at a loss to conceive how
a nascent increment, a quantity just begin∣ning
to exist, but not yet arrived to any as∣signable
magnitude, can be divided or di∣stinguished
into two equal parts. Now to
me there appears no more difficulty in con∣ceiving
this, than in apprehending how any
finite quantity is divided or distinguished in∣to
halves. For nascent quantities may bear
all imaginable proportions to one another, as
well as finite quantities. One example of this
I have already given in sect. 17. p. 27. where
the nascent increments <HI>BD, bd,</HI> bear to
each other the proportion of 2 to 1; and
consequently the nascent increment <HI>bd</HI> is
equal to one half of the nascent increment
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
<HI>BD.</HI> And by dividing the revolving line
<HI>AbB</HI> into any other assignable parts, it is
very easy to conceive what number one
pleases of nascent increments bearing any
assignable proportions to one another.</P>
<P>It is possible you may be so exceedingly
scrupulous as to object that, though a mo∣ment
as <HI>bd,</HI> is here shewn to be equal to
half of another moment <HI>BD,</HI> yet still this
does not come up to the case of Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton's</HI> demonstration, where one mo∣ment
is supposed not only to be double of
another, as in this case, but to be actually
divided into two equal parts. I am willing
to have all possible regard for the tenderness
and delicacy of your understanding in con∣ceiving
any thing that makes against you,
and therefore shall readily you give the best
assistance I can towards overcoming this dif∣ficulty
likewise. And perhaps it may be
most easy to your imagination, if we first
suppose our moments to be finite quantities,
and afterwards to become evanescent, as
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> generally does, and ob∣serves
to be agreeable to the geometry of
the ancients.</P>
<P>Let therefore the line <HI>AC</HI> be bisected in
the point <HI>B,</HI> and at a given instant of time <FIGURE>
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
</FIGURE>
let a point set out from <HI>A</HI> to describe the
line <HI>AC</HI> with any given velocity. It is plain
this point will arrive at <HI>C</HI> in a given time.
Let another point at the same given instant
of time set out from <HI>B</HI> with one half of the
former velocity, to describe the line <HI>BC.</HI>
Then will this second point arrive at <HI>C</HI> in
the same given time as the first point will
arrive there. Now let us suppose the lines
<HI>AC, BC,</HI> to be gradually destroyed by this
motion of their respective describing points
<HI>A</HI> and <HI>B.</HI> It is manifest that these lines will
be to one another as 2 to 1, not only at the
first, but all the time they are diminishing.
And as by the approach of the points <HI>A</HI> and
<HI>B</HI> to the point <HI>C</HI> these lines will be dimi∣nished
<HI>sine fine,</HI> and will at last vanish into
nothing by the actual arrival of those points
at <HI>C</HI>; the proportion beforesaid of 2 to 1
will still subsist between them to the instant
of their evanescence, and even at that very in∣stant.
Here then we have the evanescent
line <HI>AB</HI> actually divided into two equal
parts, as was above proposed. For this di∣vision
does not cease before the line vanishes,
any more than the line vanishes before the
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
division ceases. The whole line <HI>AC</HI> does
not vanish before its half <HI>BC</HI>; nor the half
<HI>BC</HI> before the whole <HI>AC:</HI> But the whole
line <HI>AC</HI> and the half line <HI>BC</HI> vanish at one
and the same instant of time.</P>
<P>I am satisfied that what I have here laid
before you, in order to assist you in conceiv∣ing
an evanescent quantity distinguished into
two equal parts, will be of little use, unless
I clear up the rest of those <HI>strange conceits,
if words without a meaning may be called so,
which,</HI> you say, <HI>I utter with that extreme
satisfaction and complacency,</HI> that <HI>unintelli∣gible
account, in which you find no sense or
reason, and bid the reader find it if he can.</HI></P>
<P>And here, I own, you have fairly gra∣velled
me. I am at a stand, at a loss, in as
great a perplexity, as when my hunger was
equally divided between the two bottles of
hay, without seeing any possibility of its
being satisfied. Oh for a whisper from ano∣ther
Ghost! But alas! What would even
that avail me against a Freethinker in Mathe∣maticks,
against a man so hardened in in∣fidelity,
that he will not believe, though
one should arise from the dead, not upon
<HI>the word of a Ghost, how venerable soever</HI>?
What then can be done? I had, I thought,
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
rendered that account as clear as words
could make it. I had shown not only what
a moment was, but to prevent, as far as
possible, all mistakes about it, I had most
carefully and circumspectly shown what it
was not. Since that account was published,
I had observed several persons to be greatly
satisfied with that paragraph, and some to
have rectified their notions by it. What
then can be the reason of this <HI>phaenomenon,</HI>
that the perspicacious Author of the Minute
Philosopher cannot comprehend what every
body else so easily understands, cannot see
what to others appears as clear as the day?
Is it that he has hurt his sight by poring so
long upon objects too small to be discerned,
as <HI>a triangle in a point</HI>? Or has he blinded
himself by gazing upon a light too strong
for his eyes, with endeavouring to find spots
in the Sun? Or has he crack'd his brain by
his meditations upon a science too hard for

But hold! These circumstances surely
can never suit my correspondent; and be∣sides,

be mistaken.</P>
<P>Is it then, that by having been long in
the dark, and fixing his attention upon dim
and obscure objects which he had not light
enough to perceive distinctly, his pupil is
so dilated as not to be able to distinguish
things in open day? I was going to say,
like a Cat that had lost her <HI>Membrana nicti∣tans.</HI>
But perhaps this comparison, though
with so sagacious an Animal, may give
him offence. What then shall I say? I have
it. I beg his pardon for these offensive guesses.
It was my own fault I was not understood
by him. This comes of saving sixpence to
one's reader. Had I put a figure in that
place, all had been right. But I was resol∣ved
to have none. For, I knew, my Book-seller,
who understands his business as well
as <HI>Jacob Tonson,</HI> would not have failed of
clapping on the other sixpence to the price
of my performance, which would have dis∣appointed
me in my design of making Truth
come cheaper than error. But it will be
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
asked, why the want of a figure to that ac∣count
should be of greater disadvantage to
him than to other readers. I answer, this
proceeds from an infirmity that I have long
observed in him, though every body may
not have taken notice of it, and though it
is, as I believe, unknown to himself. It is,
that his Ideas are almost all sensible. He has
few or none of those Ideas which are pure∣ly,
or partly, intellectual, and which have no
sensible images to represent them. But of
this disease I may perhaps speak more large∣ly
another time; at present I shall endea∣vour
to obviate this defect in him by the
following figure.

<P>Let therefore <HI>RALB,</HI> or <HI>RL,</HI> represent

<P>Let us now see if by the help of this
figure my <HI>unintelligible account</HI> of a moment
can be cleared up.
<FIGURE>
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>First then, the moment of the rectangle
<HI>AB,</HI> or <HI>RL,</HI> is neither the increment from
<HI>AB</HI> to <HI>A</HI>+<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>+<HI>b</HI>; nor the decrement
from <HI>AB</HI> to <HI>A</HI>−<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−<HI>b</HI>: i.e. <HI>rs</HI>; is nei∣ther
<HI>Lt</HI> nor <HI>Lq.</HI></P>
<P>It is not a moment common to <HI>AB</HI> and
<HI>A</HI>+<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>+<HI>b,</HI> which may be considered as
the increment of the former, or as the de∣crement
of the latter: <HI>i. e. rs</HI>; is not <HI>Lt,</HI>
common to <HI>RL</HI> and <HI>Rt,</HI> which may be
considered as the increment of <HI>RL,</HI> or as
the decrement of <HI>Rt.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it a moment common to <HI>AB</HI> and
<HI>A</HI>−<HI>a</HI> × <HI>B</HI>−<HI>b,</HI> which may be considered as
the decrement of the first, or as the incre∣ment
of the last: <HI>i.e. rs</HI>; is not <HI>Lq</HI> com∣mon
to <HI>RL</HI> and <HI>Rq,</HI> which may be consi∣dered
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
as the decrement of <HI>RL,</HI> or as the in∣crement
of <HI>Rq.</HI></P>
<P>But it is the moment of the very indivi∣dual
rectangle <HI>AB</HI> itself, and peculiar to
that only; and such as being considered in∣differently
either as an increment or decre∣ment,
shall be exactly and perfectly the
same: <HI>i.e. rs</HI>; is the moment of <HI>RL,</HI> and
peculiar only to <HI>RL</HI>; and if <HI>RL</HI> be consi∣dered
as an increasing quantity, <HI>rs</HI>; may be
considered as an increment; if <HI>RL</HI> be look∣ed
upon as decreasing, <HI>rs</HI>; may be considered
as a decrement. But whether <HI>rs</HI>; be consi∣dered
as increment or decrement of <HI>RL,</HI> it
is one and the same quantity.</P>
<P>And the way to obtain such a moment,
(<HI>viz.</HI> such as being considered either as an in∣crement
or decrement of the rectangle <HI>RL,</HI>
shall be exactly the same, such as is not com∣mon
to <HI>RL</HI> and some other rectangle, but
peculiar to <HI>RL</HI> only) is not to look for a
moment lying between <HI>AB</HI> and <HI>A</HI>+<HI>a</HI> ×
<HI>B</HI>+<HI>b,</HI> i.e. between <HI>RL</HI> and <HI>Rt</HI>; nor to
look for one lying between <HI>AB</HI> and <HI>A</HI>−<HI>a</HI> ×
<HI>B</HI>−<HI>b</HI> i.e. between <HI>RL</HI> and <HI>Rq</HI>: Not to
suppose <HI>AB</HI> as lying at either extremity of
the moment, but as extended to the middle

<FIGURE>
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
</FIGURE>
of it, <HI>i.e.</HI> not to suppose <HI>Lt</HI> to be the mo∣ment
and <HI>RL</HI> lying at the inner extremity of
it, nor to suppose <HI>Lq</HI> to be the moment and
<HI>RL</HI> lying at the outer extremity of it, but
to suppose <HI>rs</HI>; to be the moment, and <HI>RL</HI> ex∣tended
to the middle of it; as having acqui∣red
<HI>rL</HI> the one half of the moment, and be∣ing
about to acquire the other half <HI>Ls</HI>; or
as having lost <HI>Ls</HI>; the one half of the mo∣ment,
and being about to lose the other half
<HI>Lr.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, by this time, Sir, you may have
discovered some <HI>sense and reason in what I say</HI>
in my account of a moment: but if you can∣not
or will not discover any, I flatter myself
the reader both will and can. And having
now a figure before me, I shall take the op∣portunity
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
of shewing you, that there is some
<HI>reasoning</HI> couched under what you are plea∣sed
to take for <HI>mirth and humour,</HI> in
the proof that I have given, <HI>pag.</HI> 45, 46.
of my Defence, that the moment of the rect∣angle
<HI>AB</HI> is not the increment or decrement
of <HI>AB,</HI> but a middle arithmetical propor∣tional
between them.</P>
<P>After proposing to you what by your own
confession is the increment, and what the de∣crement
of the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> I ask, you
say, <HI>with an intention to puzzle you,</HI> which
of these you will call the moment of <HI>AB.</HI>
I supposed it impossible for you to give any
answer to that question, and therefore I de∣cided
it my own way. You now say, <HI>Either
of them:</HI> And you call this a <HI>plain and easy
answer.</HI> My question was, What is the
moment of the rectangle <HI>RL</HI>? You answer,
<HI>EITHER Lt,</HI> or <HI>Lq.</HI> I ask again, How
can I take EITHER <HI>Lt,</HI> or <HI>Lq,</HI> for the
moment of <HI>RL,</HI> when <HI>Lt</HI> and <HI>Lq</HI> are une∣qual?
If the moment be equal to <HI>Lt,</HI> then
must <HI>Lq</HI> be less than the moment: And if
the moment be equal to <HI>Lq,</HI> then must <HI>Lt</HI>
be greater than the moment. Which then
must I take for the moment, since each of
them can never be equal to the moment?
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
All the Answer I can get out of you is, <HI>EI∣THER
of them.</HI></P>
<P>Things standing thus, I offer this argu∣ment
to your consideration. Since, accord∣ing
to you, I may take <HI>Lt</HI> for the moment
of <HI>RL</HI>; and since, according to you I may
likewise take <HI>Lq</HI> for the moment of <HI>RL</HI>;
it is manifest that, according to you, I may
take <HI>Lt</HI> and <HI>Lq</HI> added together for twice
the moment of <HI>RL.</HI> Consequently, accord∣ing
to you, I may take the half of <HI>Lt</HI> and
the half of <HI>Lq</HI> added together for the
moment of <HI>RL,</HI> i.e. I may take <HI>rs</HI>; for the
moment of <HI>RL.</HI> I hope I may now be al∣lowed
to say, "Believe me there is no re∣medy,
you must acquiesce."</P>
<Q>—Frustra cerno te tendere contra.</Q>
<P>I suppose, Sir, you may now compre∣hend
my meaning, when I say, that the mo∣ment
of <HI>AB</HI> is not the increment of <HI>AB,</HI>
tho' I allow the moment of <HI>AB</HI> to be an in∣crement,
agreeably to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s
definition of the word moment. But still it
is possible, you may doubt whether the sense
I assign to the word moment, be Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI>'s sense of that term, or a new one that
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
I have affixed to it in opposition to you.
This is the next point to be cleared up.</P>
<P>And here I beg leave to observe in the first
place, the presumption is strong in my fa∣vour,
that by the moment of <HI>AB</HI> Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>
means something different from the incre∣ment
of <HI>AB.</HI> For if these two words signi∣fied
precisely the same thing, it is probable
he would have used them indifferently,
sometimes the one and sometimes the other.
Whereas the fact is, that, after he has done
with defining his terms, he never mentions
the word increment but in one place, and
then he does not speak of the increment of
the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> but only of the increment
of the rectangle, <HI>i.e.</HI> of the flowing rectan∣gle
taken at large. But where he names his
rectangle, or other flowing quantity, as <HI>AB,</HI>
<HI>ABC, A</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, <HI>A</HI><SUP>3</SUP>, &amp;c. He never mentions
the increment of <HI>AB,</HI> of <HI>ABC,</HI> of <HI>A</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, &amp;c.
but always the moment of <HI>AB,</HI> the moment
of <HI>ABC,</HI> the moment of <HI>A</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, of <HI>A</HI><SUP>3</SUP>, &amp;c.
And when such a writer as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
chuses constantly to use one term, rather than
another seemingly of the same signification,
it is to be presmed he has some reason for
so doing.</P>
<P>But farther, we are to take notice that, ac∣cording
to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> the moment of
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
a flowing quantity is ever proportional to the
velocity of the same flowing quantity. Let
the velocity and the moment of a flowing
quantity vary as they will, yet if any instant
of time be taken, these three things will be
given, such as they are at that same instant,
namely, the rectangle itself, its velocity, and
its moment. And this velocity and moment
are always proportional. If therefore it shall
be shown, that the moment of a flowing
quantity, such as I suppose it, is proportio∣nal
to the velocity of that same flowing quan∣tity;
it will follow that what I suppose to
be the moment, is the same with the mo∣ment
intended by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>In order therefore to render the concep∣tion
of this point as easy and as clear as
possible, I shall once more have recourse to
that well known and familiar instance of a
flowing quantity I have so often made use of,
<HI>viz.</HI> that of a line described by the motion
of a point.</P>
<P>Let <HI>x</HI> represent the time, in which a flow∣ing
line is generated, in all the following
cases, and since time flows uniformly, let
the constant quantity <HI>ẋ</HI> represent the mo∣ment,
or increment, (for in this particular
case they are both one) of the time <HI>x.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="79"/>
Case 1. If the velocity of the genera∣ting
point be uniform, the flowing line will
be as the time in which it is generated, and
consequently the line may also be represent∣ed
by <HI>x,</HI> and its moment or increment may
be represented by <HI>ẋ</HI> In this case therefore
the moment <HI>ẋ,</HI> being constant, must be pro∣portional
to the velocity, which is likewise
constant.</P>
<P>Case 2. Let the velocity be equably acce∣lerated,
as in the case of a falling body ac∣cording
to <HI>Galileo</HI>'s Theory. Then will the
velocity be as the time, and consequently
the velocity likewise may be represented by
<HI>x.</HI> And the flowing line being as the time
and velocity jointly, that line may be repre∣sented
by <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>. Now the supposed moment
of this line <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, is 2<HI>xẋ,</HI> and I say, 2<HI>xẋ</HI> is
proportional to <HI>x</HI> the velocity of the flow∣ing
line. For since <HI>ẋ</HI> is a constant quantity,
it is evident that 2<HI>xẋ</HI> is as 2<HI>x</HI>; and 2<HI>x</HI> is
as <HI>x.</HI> Therefore 2<HI>xẋ</HI> is as <HI>x.</HI> In this case
therefore the supposed moment is as the ve∣locity
of the flowing quantity.</P>
<P>Case 3. Let the velocity be as the square
of the time, and be represented by <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>. Then
will the flowing line still be as the velocity
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
and the time jointly, and consequently may be
represented by <HI>x</HI><SUP>3</SUP>, the supposed moment
of which, <HI>viz.</HI> 3<HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>ẋ,</HI> is evidently as <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, or as
the velocity.</P>
<P>Case 4. In general, let the velocity be as
any power of the time, and consequently be
represented by <HI>x</HI><SUP><HI>n</HI>−1</SUP>. Then may the flowing
line be represented by the time and the velo∣city
jointly, or by <HI>x</HI> × <HI>x</HI><SUP><HI>n</HI>−1</SUP>, <HI>i.e.</HI> by <HI>x</HI>^<HI>n.</HI> And
the supposed moment of this line will be
<HI>nx</HI><SUP><HI>n</HI>−1</SUP><HI>ẋ,</HI> which is manifestly as <HI>x</HI><SUP><HI>n</HI>−1</SUP>, that is,
as the velocity.</P>
<P>The moment therefore supposed by me
is ever proportional to the velocity, and con∣sequently
is the moment supposed by Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>While I am upon this consideration, it
may not be amiss for a more compleat illu∣stration
of what we have been talking of,
to consider a little more particularly the se∣cond
case, or that of the flowing quantity
<HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, answering to the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> of Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> I shall therefore take the li∣berty
of laying before my reader in one
view, the decrement, the moment, and the
increment of the flowing quantity <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, toge∣ther
with the several velocities that would ge∣nerate
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
them respectively, with an uniform
motion, in a given time.</P>

<P>Here it appears that as the moment is a
middle arithmetical proportional between
the decrement and increment; so is the ve∣locity
of the flowing line, or the velocity that
would generate the moment in the given
time 2<HI>ẋ,</HI> a middle arithmetical propor∣tional
between the velocities that would re∣spectively
generate the decrement and incre∣ment
in the same given time. And this pro∣portion
equally holds, whether the mo∣ments
be evanescent, or finite quantities of
whatsoever magnitude.</P>
<P>Whence I infer, that although it were not
possible to conceive an evanescent moment
divided into two equal parts, yet as finite
ones may be conceived to be so divided, that
demonstration of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s which
you object against, will still hold firm and
entire, by substituting finite moments in the
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
room of evanescent moments. Which is a
secret you were not aware of.</P>
<P>One more observation, and I have done.
You would have us take the increment of
<HI>AB,</HI> or in this case the increment of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, for
the moment of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>; that is, you would have
us take 2<HI>xẋ</HI>+<HI>ẋẋ,</HI> and not 2<HI>xẋ,</HI> for the
moment of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>: And yet you allow that the
moment of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP> is proportional to the velo∣city
of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>. But the velocity of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP> is <HI>x</HI>; and
the quantity you give us as the moment,
namely 2<HI>xẋ</HI>+<HI>ẋẋ,</HI> is not proportional to
this velocity <HI>x.</HI> Therefore by your own
concession, that quantity is not the true mo∣ment.
But the quantity that Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI>
assigns, namely 2<HI>xẋ,</HI> has just now been
shown to be proportional to <HI>x,</HI> the velocity
of <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, and therefore is the true moment.
Now therefore I may safely repeat my que∣stion,
and <HI>ask with my accustomed air,</HI>
"What say you, Sir? Is this a just and le∣gitimate
reason for Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s proceeding
as he did? I think you must acknowledge
it to be so."</P>
<P>But hark you! Why all this outcry about
Ghosts and Visions? Pray who first intro∣duced
them? If I brought in one, you
might consider it was to a very good pur∣pose,
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
to help my self out, or rather to help
you out, at a dead lift. Whereas you had
before needlesly introduced an innumerable
multitude of <HI>Ghosts of departed quantities,</HI> for
no other intent or purpose in the world but
your own diversion.</P>
<P>In consideration of which I hope I may
be pardoned for bringing in one more,
though I can give no better reason for it,
than that the Apparition runs strongly in my
fancy.</P>

<P>XXXI. It is now so evident even to your

is not the increment of the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI>
that I expect to be complimented upon my

You have indeed <HI>replièd, that this charge is as
untrue as it is peremptory.</HI> But that was in
your state of blindness, and I forgive you
without your asking pardon. You say in

<P>XXXII. Before I proceed to vindicate
that assertion of mine which makes the sub∣ject
of this section, I crave leave to observe,
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
that this assertion, true or false, is no way
material to the point in debate between us.
You were fully answered before I laid down
that assertion: And all the subterfuges you
have since made use of, are clearly removed
before I vindicate it. Why therefore did I
make that assertion? Dear Sir, the true rea∣son
is a secret. I see plainly it never entered
your <HI>Pericranium,</HI> any more than that of
some other persons much superior to you
in this part of science. In due time it may
come out. In the mean while all I shall say
is, it was made to guard, not against pre∣sent,
but future objections.</P>
<P>Do not mistake me, Sir, I am not going
to excuse that assertion, much less to give
it up. I intend to vindicate it to the last
drop of my pen. Like <HI>Mackbeth</HI> in blood,</P>
<Q><L>—I am in ink</L>
<L>Stept in so far, that should I wade no more,</L>
<L>Returning were as tedious as go o'er.</L></Q>
<P>My assertion was, That the moment of
the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> determined by Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> namely <HI>aB</HI>+<HI>bA,</HI> and the incre∣ment
of the same rectangle determined by
your self, namely <HI>aB</HI>+<HI>bA</HI>+<HI>ab,</HI> are per∣fectly
and exactly equal, supposing <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
to be diminished <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; and this by
<HI>Lemma</HI> 1. <HI>Sect.</HI> 1. <HI>Libr.</HI> 1. <HI>Princip.</HI></P>
<P>You answer, <HI>If</HI> a <HI>and</HI> b <HI>are real quanti∣ties,
then</HI> ab <HI>is something, and consequently
makes a real difference; but if they are nothing,
then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients,
become nothing likewise; and consequently the</HI>
momentum <HI>or</HI> incrementum, <HI>whether Sir</HI>
Isaac<HI>'s or mine, are in that case nothing at
all.</HI></P>
<P>By giving this for an answer to my asser∣tion,
it is plain you have no notion of what
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> means by a quantity being
infinitely diminished, though he has so fully
and clearly explained himself in the <HI>scholium</HI>
of that section of the <HI>Principia,</HI> which I so
often refer you to.</P>
<P>Suppose a given line to be gradually dimi∣nished,
during a given time, by the conti∣nued
motion of a point, so that at the end of
the given time the line would entirely vanish
and become nothing. Then if the motion
of the point, and the gradual diminution
of the line consequent thereupon, be sup∣posed
to stop before the expiration of the
given time, it is plain that the line will not
as yet have been diminished <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; it
will still be something, it will be a real
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
quantity, it will be a finite quantity. But
if the motion go on, without stop or stay, to
the end of the given time, it is manifest that
the line must be diminished <HI>sine fine, sine
limite,</HI> it must be diminished <HI>ad infinitum,</HI>
it must vanish, it must become nothing.
The end of this diminution <HI>ad infinitum,</HI>
the vanishing of the line, and its becoming
nothing, these three must all happen at one
and the same instant of time, namely at the
expiration of the given time. So that an in∣stant
before the expiration of the given time,
or before the quantity becomes nothing, it
cannot truly be said to be actually diminished
<HI>ad infinitum.</HI> Therefore while <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are
real quantities, they are not yet diminished
<HI>ad infinitum,</HI> they may be farther dimi∣nished.
And consequently the first part of
your answer is quite beside the purpose: It
tends only to shew that there is a real diffe∣rence
between the moment and increment,
before the instant of time when I suppose
them to become equal; that while they are
unequal, there is a difference between them.
A great discovery, and undoubtedly true!</P>
<P>You proceed in your answer, <HI>If they,</HI> i.e.
a <HI>and</HI> b, <HI>are nothing, then the rectangles where∣of
they are coefficients, become nothing likewise:</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
<HI>and consequently the</HI> momentum <HI>or</HI> incremen∣tum,
<HI>whether Sir</HI> Isaac'<HI>s or mine, are in that
case nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>This likewise is undoubtedly true. But it
is so far from contradicting Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton</HI>'s
doctrine, that it is perfectly agreeable
to it. What he says, and what I contend
for, is this.</P>
<P>Though so long as <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are real quanti∣ties,
their rectangle <HI>ab</HI> is a real quantity,
and there is a real difference between the
two quantities <HI>aB</HI>+<HI>bA</HI> and <HI>aB</HI>+<HI>bA</HI>+<HI>ab</HI>:
Yet, when by a continual diminution
<HI>ad infinitum a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> vanish, their rectangle
<HI>ab,</HI> or the difference between the two quan∣tities
<HI>aB</HI>+<HI>bA</HI> and <HI>aB</HI>+<HI>bA</HI>+<HI>ab,</HI> vani∣shes
likewise, and there is no longer any dif∣ference
left between those quantities, <HI>i.e.</HI>
those quantities are equal. But you say,
when <HI>ab,</HI> when the difference between these
two quantities vanishes, the quantities them∣selves
do likewise vanish. I agree with you.
Their difference therefore vanishes when
they vanish: And they vanish when their
difference vanishes: Or, The quantities
themselves, and the difference between them,
vanish at one and the same instant of time.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="92"/>
You see I agree perfectly with you, that
the moment and increment vanish at the
same instant that their difference vanishes.
All I contend for is this, That the moment
and increment vanish with a ratio of equali∣ty,
and that they do so, I am going to de∣monstrate
after Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s manner.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Let the rectangle <HI>AE</HI> represent 2<HI>xẋ,</HI> the
moment, and let the rectangle <HI>AF</HI> represent
2<HI>xẋ</HI>+<HI>ẋẋ,</HI> the increment of the flowing
square <HI>x</HI><SUP>2</SUP>. I say when <HI>ẋ</HI> vanishes, the mo∣ment
2<HI>xẋ,</HI> and the increment 2<HI>xẋ</HI>+<HI>ẋẋ,</HI> will
vanish with a ratio of equality.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="demonstration">

<P>Produce the lines <HI>AD, BE, CF,</HI> to the

<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
rectangles <HI>AE, AF</HI> be proportional to the
rectangles <HI>Ae, Af.</HI> Now let <HI>CB</HI> be dimi∣nished
<HI>ad infinitum,</HI> and vanish into nothing
by the coincidence of the point <HI>C</HI> with the
point <HI>B.</HI> At the instant that these points
coincide, the lines <HI>CFf, BEe</HI> will likewise
coincide, <HI>i.e.</HI> the rectangles <HI>Ae, Af,</HI> will
coincide and become perfectly equal, and at
the same instant the rectangles <HI>AE, AF,</HI>
i.e. the moment and increment, will vanish.
But at the instant that the rectangles <HI>Ae, Af</HI>
become equal, the rectangles proportional to
these, <HI>AE</HI> and <HI>AF</HI> must likewise become e∣qual.
Therefore these rectangles vanish and
become equal at one and the same instant of
time, or vanish with a ratio of equality.
<HI>Q.E.D.</HI></P>
<P>I am so desirous of leaving both you, Sir,
and my reader without any scruple upon this
point, that I cannot content myself with on∣ly
demonstrating, that in fact the thing is as
I say, unless I likewise shew you by what
means it comes to be so. The case is this.</P>
<P>While <HI>ẋ</HI> is gradually diminished, the ra∣tio
between the increment and moment is
likewise perpetually diminished, and tends
to a certain limit which it can never pass,
and can never arrive at till <HI>ẋ</HI> is diminished <HI>ad</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
<HI>infinitum,</HI> and vanishes into nothing. That
limit is equality.</P>
<P>Likewise while <HI>ẋ</HI> is gradually diminished,
the increment and moment are perpetually
diminished, and tend to a certain limit, which
they can never arrive at till <HI>ẋ</HI> is diminished
<HI>ad infinitum,</HI> and vanishes into nothing. That
limit is nothing.</P>
<P>So that the ratio of the increment and
moment, and the increment and moment, do
both arrive at their several limits, <HI>i.e.</HI> at e∣quality
and at nothing, at one and the same
instant of time. That is, the increment and
moment become equal and vanish, vanish
and become equal, at the same instant.</P>
<P>Methinks, Sir, you and I are now so far
agreed, that it is pity there should be any
difference between us about the <HI>Lemma</HI> I
quoted to you. But as it may be of some
service to you, and may possibly save trouble
to us both another time, I am willing to
take a little farther pains for your informa∣tion;
though I greatly fear it will be lost
upon you, and that you will make no better
use of it, than you did of the friendly advice I
gave you in my last letter, to weight very well
what Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> says, before you cen∣sure
him. For I see my hypothesis about
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
the cause of your errors still holds good:
You have too good an opinion of your own
understanding, to think you can ever be mi∣staken.
Else how was it possible for you to
say, when such a man as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
was laying down the foundation of the Me∣thod
of Fluxions, <HI>That his very first and
fundamental</HI> Lemma <HI>was incompatible with
and subversive of the Doctrine of Fluxions?
That it seemed the most injudicious step that could
be taken? That it was directly demolishing the
very doctrine I would defend?</HI> Pray let us see

of that book which is the admiration and

<P>You suppose Sir <HI>Isaac Newton to argue,
that quantities must be equal, because they have

<P>XXXIII. We come now to the method
for obtaining a rule to find the fluxion of any
power of a flowing quantity, which is deli∣vered
in the introduction to the Quadratures,
and considered in the Analyst. <HI>And here,</HI>
say you, <HI>the question between us is, whether
I have rightly represented the sense of those
words,</HI> evanescant jam augmenta illa, <HI>in ren∣dering
them, let the increments vanish,</HI> i.e.
<HI>let the increments be nothing, or let there be no
increments?</HI> And so, Sir, you would have
the Reader believe that this is the whole of
the question between us: That we have each
of us spent four or five pages, and may pos∣sibly
spend twice as many more before we
have done, in wrangling about the transla∣tion
of four <HI>Latin</HI> words. If so, methinks
his best way will be to let us wrangle by our
selves, and to translate those four words
himself as he thinks fit, without ever trou∣bling
his head about us.</P>
<P>But I take the question between us to be
of a little more extent, and of somewhat
more importance. What I have endeavour∣ed
to establish the sense of, is not those four
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
words alone, but the whole passage taken
together, <HI>i.e.</HI> in the style of divines, the
text and the context. The whole passage is,
<HI>Evanescant jam augmenta illa &amp; eorum ratio
ultima erit,</HI> and I have endeavoured to settle
the meaning of this whole passage taken toge∣ther,
by comparing it with an equivalent pas∣sage,
but expressed in such terms as not to be
liable to any sophistication, <HI>Nascantur jam
augmenta illa &amp; eorum ratio prima erit.</HI></P>
<P>The question therefore between us is not
barely how those four words may be tran∣slated:
If they stood alone, they might be tran∣slated
twenty different ways: But the question
is, how these four words ought to be translated
in conjunction with the other words that
follow; how the whole passage ought to be
translated, so as to let the Reader understand
the meaning and design of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
in that passage. His design is manifestly to
consider the proportion between the evane∣scent
augments, or to consider the pro∣portion
with which the augments vanish.
He plainly makes two suppositions in
this passage. The first is, that the aug∣ments
vanish, or become nothing. The se∣cond,
that the augments have a last ratio.
And his business is to determine what this
last ratio is: Now the question between you
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
and me is, when, at what instant of time
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> supposes the augments to
have this last ratio? You will needs have it,
that he supposes the augments first to vanish,
to become nothing, and then considers the
proportion between those nothings. I
maintain, that he considers the proportion
between the augments, not after they are va∣nished,
but at the instant that they vanish,
in the very point of evanescence. And I am
justified by his own words, where he more
fully explains himself,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schol. Sect. 1. Libr. 1. Princip.</NOTE> <HI>intelligendam esse ra∣tionem
quantitatum non antequam evanescutn
NON POSTEA, sed quacum evanescunt.</HI>
You see therefore, Sir, the hard words, you
say, I have used, do not fall upon my Friends,
but fall where I intended them. The blun∣der
of making the quantities first become no∣thing,
and then settling the proportion be∣tween
those nothings, stands just as it did.
It puts me in mind of an Evidence, who was
instructed to swear that a certain will was
made just as the Testator was dying, and
was therefore subsequent to another will
made some time before his death. This per∣son
resolved to make sure work, and swore
positively that this was the last will, for it
was made after the Testator was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101"/>
You see likewise you had no reason to de∣spair
of making me acknowledge, that va∣nishing
and becoming nothing were equiva∣lent
terms with Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> Indeed,
how was it possible to think otherwise? A
nascent augment must have been nothing
before it began to exist, and an evanescent
augment must be nothing after it ceases to
exist.</P>
<P>As it is my business chiefly to keep upon
the defensive, and I have hitherto had very
little occasion to act offensively, I did in my
first Letter consider your important <HI>Lemma</HI>
and reasoning upon it, no farther than was
necessary to justify Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> against
the consequences you draw from that <HI>Lem∣ma.</HI>
But now, as you are pleased to shew
more than ordinary arrogance in this and the
following section, I hope the reader will ex∣cuse
me, if I step out of my way to call you
a little to account. A vigilant General,
who is assaulted in his entrenchments by an
overbearing and insolent Enemy, may some∣times
observe that Enemy in the heat of his
attack, to lay himself so open, as to give a
fair opportunity of sallying out and chastising
him.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="102"/>
And it may not be amiss to shew, that
Mathematicians are not the only persons,
who <HI>falsely imagine their rational faculties to
be more improved than those of other men, which
have been exercised in a different manner, and
on different subjects.</HI> That there are other
persons, who <HI>erect themselves into judges and
oracles, concerning matters,</HI> which they have
<HI>never</HI> sufficiently <HI>considered nor comprehended.</HI>
And if this appear, it will surely <HI>furnish a
fair</HI> argumentum ad hominem <HI>against men,
who reject that very thing in</HI> Geometry <HI>which
they admit in</HI> Logick. It will be <HI>a proper way
to abate the pride, and discredit the pretensions
of these</HI> Logicians and Metaphysicians, <HI>who
insist upon clear Ideas in points of</HI> Mathe∣maticks,
<HI>if it be shewn that they do without
them in their own science.</HI></P>
<P>The substance of your <HI>Lemma</HI> is this. If
one supposition be made, and be afterwards
destroy'd by a CONTRARY supposition;
then every thing that followed from the
first supposition, is destroyed with it. This
being laid down, you proceed thus. Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton</HI> supposes certain increments to
exist, or that there are certain increments.
In consequence of their supposed existence,
he forms certain expressions of those incre∣ments,
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
with intent to deduce the proportion
of the increments from those expressions.
He afterwards supposes that those incre∣ments
vanish, <HI>i.e.</HI> say you, that the incre∣ments
are nothing, that there are no incre∣ments.</P>
<P>I forbear making any remarks upon your
interpretation of the word vanish. I admit
it to be as you are pleased to make it, that
the first supposition is, there are increments;
and that the second supposition is, there are
no increments. What do you infer from
this? The second supposition, say you, is
contrary to the former, and destroys the for∣mer,
and in destroying the former it de∣stroys
the expressions, the proportions, and
every thing else derived from the former
supposition. Not too fast, good Mr. <HI>Logi∣cian.</HI>
If I say, the increments now exist,
and, the increments do not now exist; the
latter assertion will be contrary to the for∣mer,
supposing now to mean the same in∣stant
of time in both assertions. But if I
say at one time, the increments now exist;
and say an hour after, the increments do not
now exist; the latter assertion will neither
be contrary, nor contradictory to the for∣mer,
because the first now signifies one
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
time, and the second now signifies another
time, so that both assertions may be true.
The case therefore in your argument does
not come up to your <HI>Lemma,</HI> unless you will
say Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> supposes that there are
increments, and that there are no increments,
at the same instant of time. Which is what
you have not said, and what, I hope, you will
not dare to say.</P>
<P>But perhaps you will still maintain, that
whether the second supposition be esteemed
contrary, or not contrary, to the first, yet
as the increments, which were supposed at first
to exist, are now supposed not to exist, but
to be vanished and gone, all the consequen∣ces
of their supposed existence, as their ex∣pressions,
proportions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must now be sup∣posed
to be vanished and gone with them.
I cannot allow of this neither.</P>
<P>Let us imagine your self and me to be
debating this matter, in an open field, at a di∣stance
from any shelter, and in the middle
of a large company of Mathematicians and
Logicians. A sudden violent rain falls.
The consequence is, we are all wet to the
skin. Before we can get to covert, it clears
up, and the Sun shines. You are for going
on with the dispute. I desire to be excused,
I must go home and shift my cloaths, and
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
advise you to do the same. You endeavour
to persuade me I am not wet. The shower,
say you, is vanished and gone, and conse∣quently
your coldness, and wetness, and every
thing derived from the existence of the
shower, must have vanished with it. I tell
you I feel my self cold and wet. I take my
leave, and make haste home. I am persuaded
the Mathematicians would all take the same
course, and should think them but very in∣different
Logicians, that were moved by your
arguments to stay behind.</P>
<P>Another example may make all clear. I
know a certain Gentleman, who about the
first day of <HI>April</HI> 1734, was verily persua∣ded
he saw more clearly into the principles
of fluxions, than Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> had ever
done. The consequence of this persuasion
was, that he published a book, which imme∣diately
convinced all mankind of the con∣trary.
He has since had such reasons given
him, as have entirely altered his opinion.
His former persuasion is vanished and gone;
but the book that was the consequence of
that persuasion, is not vanished and gone
with it. It would have been much for his
credit, and for the quiet of the poor Genle∣man's
mind, if it had.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="35" TYPE="section">
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
<P>XXXV. You mistake me, Sir: What I
dislike in you is not your <HI>modesty,</HI> but your
arrogance. 'Tis your unparallel'd and ama∣zing
insolence, to the greatest discoverer of
truth, of a mere mortal, that ever appeared
in the world.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that <HI>placing the same
point in various lights is of great use to ex∣plain
it.</HI></P>
<P>You have not shown Sir Isaac Newton'<HI>s
various accounts of fluxions</HI> to be <HI>inconsistent.</HI>
I find them perfectly consistent, and do
again profess my self greatly obliged to him
for his condescension, in setting his doctrine
in several different lights, without which, <HI>I</HI>
still <HI>doubt, I should never have understood it.</HI></P>
<P>But you seem to think it great vanity in
me, to talk as if I understood the doctrine
of Fluxions. Why, Sir! I hope Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI> wrote so as to be understood by
somebody. I have taken pains to under∣stand
him, and I suppose many others to
understand him likewise: I prefer my self to
no body, and I never compare my self with
any body but one. It is where I speak
of such ordinary Proficients in Mathema∣ticks,
as you and me. Even there, you see,
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
I have the good manners to place you first.
Had I said, no body understands him, but I:
Or, I don't understand him, and therefore
no body can understand him, it were unpar∣donable
vanity.</P>
<P>You say, I insult you, in asking what it is
you are offended at, who do not still under∣stand
him? I neither insult you, nor blame
you, for not understanding him: But it is, I
think, pretty extraordinary for a man, who
so often professes not to understand Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> to complain that Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> takes too
much pains to explain and illustrate his do∣ctrine,
by setting it in several different lights.
As to your request to help you out of the
dark, I have done my best, and hope you see
much better than you did. The eye-water I
have applied, might possibly give you some
pain; but it will do you a power of good.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="36" TYPE="section">
<P>XXXVI. I flatter my self, I have already
done to your mind what you here request.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="section">
<P>XXXVII. If I were to say, there are a
hundred mean and low artifices in a certain
pamphlet, scarce a section without one or
more too scandalous and too trifling to men∣tion:
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
This is plain to me; but I will not
undertake to demonstrate it to others: Is
this the same as to say, I cannot demonstrate
it to others? No. But it would take up too
much of my time, it would swell my letter
to too great a bulk to demonstrate it. You
say below, I neither <HI>will,</HI> nor <HI>can.</HI> You
make therefore a difference between the
meaning of these two words.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="section">
<P>XXXVIII. In this Section you address
yourself to me in the following words.
"You will have it, that I represent Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI>'s conclusions as coming out right,
because one error is compensated by ano∣ther
contrary and equal error, which per∣haps
he never knew himself nor thought
of: that by a twofold mistake he arrives,
though not at Science yet at Truth: that
he proceeds blindfold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which is
untruly said by you, who have misapplied
to Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> what was intended
for the <HI>Marquis de l'Hospital</HI> and his fol∣lowers."
If this was untruly said by me,
I assure you it was not a wilful untruth. You
see Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> fell into that mistake as well
as I. And I do not know a single person
who has read the Analyst, but is in the same
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
mistake. However, a mistake it undoubt∣edly
is; no body ought in the least to dispute
it, after a person of your character has made
the publick declaration just now recited, and
has farther assured us, that <HI>this double error
doth concern the Marquis alone, and not Sir</HI>
Isaac Newton. Far be it from me to call the
truth or sincerity of this declaration in que∣stion.
On the contrary, I ask your pardon
for my mistake; and to make you all the sa∣tisfaction
in my power, I do hereby retract,
recant and abjure my error, and abandon my
picture, my <HI>ingenious portraiture of Sir</HI> Isaac
Newton <HI>and</HI> Dame Fortune, to the flames.
If you are not yet satisfied, I beg leave to al∣ledge
the following reasons in mitigation of
my offence.</P>
<P N="1">1. Your discourse seemed to me to be di∣rected
to a follower of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI>
And as in Sect. XX. of the Analyst, where
this affair of the double error begins, you
perpetually address yourself to him in the
second person, as <HI>you demonstrate, you are
conversant, you conceive, you proceed, you ap∣ply,
your conclusions, your logick and method,</HI>
&amp;c. I too hastily judged that the double er∣ror
related to this follower, and consequently
to his master.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="103" REF="110"/>
2. As this affair is pursued through eleven
Sections, beginning at Sect. XX. and ending
with Sect. XXX. I find Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s
way of notation to be used in three of those
Sections, and the <HI>Marquis</HI>'s notation in two.
I find Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s language and expression, as
increments, moments, fluxions, infinitely
diminished, vanish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be used in nine
of those Sections, and the <HI>Marquis</HI>'s language
and expression, as differences, infinitesimals,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in seven of those Sections. Whence it
seemed to me, that Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> was as
much concerned in this matter, as the <HI>Mar∣quis.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In one of those Sections, namely Sect.
XXVI. you refer to Sect. XII, and XIII.; in
the first of which Sections, <HI>viz.</HI> Sect. XII. I
find this Quotation, <HI>Philosophiae Naturalis
Principia Mathematica, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>lemm.</HI> 2. and
Sect. XIII. contains nothing else but your
instance of false reasoning taken from Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Book of Quadratures. Like∣wise
in another of those Sections, namely
Sect. XXVIII. I find the same thirteenth
Section quoted. From all which it seemed
to me, that Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> was rather more
concerned in this affair than the <HI>Marquis,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
whose works I do not find to be quoted in
any of those Sections, so much as once.</P>
<P N="4">4. The arguments used in the Analyst
seemed to me to bear equally hard against
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> and the <HI>Marquis</HI>; so that I
could not see how you could condemn the
one, and acquit the other, of either of the
two errors.</P>
<P>These considerations had so fully posses∣sed
my mind, that Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> was sup∣posed
by you to be guilty of this double er∣ror,
that nothing, but my firm persuasion of
your veracity and integrity, could ever have
removed that apprehension. I must own, I
have still one scruple upon my thoughts. If
you will be so good as to remove that, my
mind will be perfectly easy about this affair.
It is this.</P>
<P>The first error in giving 2<HI>xdx</HI> for the dif∣ference,
or 2<HI>xẋ</HI> for the moment of <HI>xx,</HI> is
common to the <HI>Marquis</HI> and Sir <HI>Isaac New∣ton.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Marquis</HI> makes a second error, which
perfectly corrects the first, whence his con∣clusion
comes out right.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> makes no second error to
correct his first, and therefore his conclusion
ought to come out wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112"/>
And yet Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s conclusion comes out
exactly right, and is the same with the <HI>Mar∣quis</HI>'s
conclusion. The more I consider this,
the more it puzzles me: Possibly, for want of
the <HI>Philosophia prima,</HI> which you are so great
a master of.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="section">
<P>XXXIX. As you do not <HI>persist,</HI> nay, on
the contrary, desist, and entirely disown your
accusing Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> of this double er∣ror,
methinks there is now no occasion for
my producing any evidence to justify him.
But you are pleased to <HI>call publickly upon me
to produce it,</HI> to <HI>deny as strongly as I affirm,</HI>
to <HI>aver, that my declaring I have such evidence,
is an unquestionable proof of the matchless con∣tempt
that I,</HI> Philalethes, <HI>have for truth.</HI>
Why this indeed is matchless—Blindness,
or assurance, shall I call it? I beg the Reader
will turn to <HI>p.</HI> 70. of my Defence. There
he will see I have already produced my e∣vidence,
and have named the passages, where
these very objections of yours appear to have
been foreseen, and to be clearly and fully re∣moved.
I have there named the passages, I
say, though you have suppressed them, and
every Reader, who is qualified to examine
those passages, will find what I say to be
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
true; and that the pretence of your first er∣ror
is fully removed by <HI>Lemma</HI> 7. and that
of the second by <HI>Lemma</HI> 1.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="40" TYPE="section">
<P>XL. I have nothing to say to the princi∣ples
of the <HI>Marquis de l'Hospital,</HI> I defend
nothing but his reasoning. You say, <HI>he re∣jects
infinitesimals in virtue of a Postulatum,
and this you venture to call rejecting them with∣out
ceremony.</HI> I know of no greater ceremo∣ny
used by <HI>Euclid,</HI> than to reject a thing in ne∣cessary
and unavoidable consequence of a <HI>Po∣stulatum.</HI>
You tell me, <HI>he inferreth a conclusion
accurately true, contrary to the rules of Lo∣gick,
from inaccurate and false premises.</HI>
This I deny: for if his premises be allowed,
his conclusion will follow by the strictest
rules of <HI>Logick,</HI> though those premises are
false. Allow him his first <HI>postulatum,</HI> and
then 2<HI>xdx</HI> will be equal to 2<HI>xdx</HI>+<HI>dxdx.</HI>
Allow him his second <HI>Postulatum,</HI> and then
<HI>RN</HI> in your figure (Analyst, p. 32.) will be
equal to <HI>RL.</HI> And his conclusion must
come out right. It seems therefore, that the
<HI>Marquis</HI> is acquitted of this double error, as
well as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> and that it is you
alone, who <HI>have acted blindfold, as not know∣ing
the true reason of the conclusion's coming out
accurately right, which I shew</HI> not <HI>to have</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
<HI>been the effect of a double error,</HI> but of his two
<HI>Postulata.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="41" TYPE="section">
<P>XLI. To all this declamation I shall need
to give no other reply, than one you furnish
me with, <HI>p.</HI> 27. of this very answer. <HI>It
must be owned,</HI> say you, <HI>that after you have
misled and amused your less qualified reader▪
(as you call him) you return to the REAL
POINT in controversy, and set your self to
justify Sir</HI> Isaac'<HI>s method in getting rid of the
above-mentioned quantity.</HI> I think I have
already told you, that I had talked so much
of the smallness of the error, only for the
information of some great Churchmen,
to make them sensible of the consequence
of your discovery, in order to induce
them the more readily to join in the hymn
to your honour.</P>
<P>You say to me, <HI>You affirm, (and indeed
what can you not affirm?) that the difference
between the true subtangent and that found
without any compensation is absolutely nothing
at all.</HI> These are not my words. You will
perhaps affirm, that they express my sense.
I deny it. I neither speak thus, nor mean
thus, nor have any meaning like this, but
the direct contrary, with regard to the
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>
subtangent determined without any compen∣sation,
upon the principles of the <HI>Marquis
de l'Hospital,</HI> who alone is here referred to.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="42" TYPE="section">
<P>XLII. Empty, childish declamation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="section">
<P>XLIII. The same, or something worse.
I apprehend it was, as you say, <HI>discreetly</HI>
done, to fix upon two or three of the main
points, and to <HI>overlook</HI> the rest of the <HI>difficul∣ties
proposed in the Analyst,</HI> particularly the
Queries, threescore and seven in number.
You tell me, I am <HI>not afraid nor ashamed
to represent the Analysts as very clear and
uniform in their conceptions of these matters.</HI>
Where have I so represented them? I
know there is a great diversity of opinions
among Analysts: Some follow <HI>Monsieur Leib∣nitz,</HI>
some the <HI>Marquis de l'Hospital,</HI>
some, other writers, and some, whom I take
to be the better judges, follow Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> and these are <HI>uniform</HI> so far as they
follow their master, and <HI>clear</HI> so far as they
understand him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="44" TYPE="section">
<P>XLIV. If you have met with all these dif∣ferent
opinions, in conversation with Ana∣lysts,
in ten months time, and some Analysts,
perhaps 5 or 6, of every one of those opi∣nions,
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
one would think that Country, where
you have resided for those ten months, must
be better stocked with Mathematicians
than all the rest of <HI>Europe.</HI> I hope they are
not all <HI>Infidels.</HI> If they are, it is a mercy
they are not very able <HI>Infidels,</HI> at least so far
as one can judge of them by their mathema∣tical
opinions. Otherwise, I should appre∣hend
Religion to be in great danger there,
unless that Country be well stocked with
men able <HI>to deal with them at their own wea∣pons,
and to shew, they are by no means those
masters of reason, which they would fain pass
for.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="45-48" TYPE="section">
<P>XLV, XLVI, XLVII, XVIII. You come
now to the point of Metaphysicks in dispute
between us, about which you write, con∣trary
to your usual manner, so very inaccu∣rately
and unintelligibly, as plainly con∣vinces
me <HI>you have some other end to serve
than truth.</HI> And upon revising what I had
before addressed to you upon this subject, I
think I neither can, nor need, set that matter
in a clearer light, than I have already done. I
perceive likewise, my rebukes have had a good
effect upon you. You make excuses. <HI>It was
not,</HI> you say, <HI>with intent to carp or cavil at</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
<HI>a single passage.</HI> You talk no more of <HI>mani∣fest,
staring contradictions.</HI> No, you express
your self with some modesty, <HI>all this looks
very like a contradiction</HI>; with some other
signs of grace, that give me hopes, as you
are now made to see your errors, you may
in time be brought to acknowledge them.</P>
<P>It must be owned in your favour, you
have already recanted the principal of them,
and that which led to all the rest, as amply
and fully, as from you could possibly be ex∣pected.
You had expressed your self in Art.
CXXV of your new Theory of Vision, in the
following words. "After reiterated endea∣vours
to apprehend the GENERAL
IDEA of a Triangle, I have found it al∣together
incomprehensible." But now,
<Q>Ut primum discussaeumbrae, &amp; lux redditamenti,</Q>
your eyes being opened, (pardon me this va∣nity)
by the arguments I have done my
self the honour of laying before you, you
are pleased to say, "This implies that I
hold, there are no GENERAL IDEAS.
But I hold the direct contrary, that there
are INDEED GENERAL IDEAS,
but not formed by abstraction in the man∣ner
set forth by Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118"/>
I am so much pleased with this piece of
ingenuity and candid proceeding, that for
the sake of it I willingly excuse all that fol∣lows,
however inconsistent with this recanta∣tion:
Particularly your making no difference
between a round square, and a space com∣prehended
by three right lines. For the
same reason I willingly pass by your suppo∣sing,
that the words of my definition have no
ideas, or conceptions of the mind, joined with
them, and consequently that the definition
has no meaning. For to make the defi∣nition
have a meaning, some particular idea,
simple or compound, must be joined to every
word used in it; and a compound idea, made
up of all those particular ideas, must be joined
to, and always go along with the whole defini∣tion:
And these two, the compound idea
and the definition are inseparable, if the de∣finition
be understood. Methinks therefore,
instead of separating these, it were better to
make a distinction between this compound
idea answering to the definition of a triangle,
and the image, or sensible representation of
a triangle; two things which I have observ∣ed
you often to confound, both here and in
your other writings. The compound idea
is general, but the image, if exactly attend∣ed
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
to and adequately perceived by the mind,
must always be particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="49" TYPE="section">
<P>XLIX. You here propose some points for
the Reader <HI>to reflect</HI> upon <HI>and examine by my
light,</HI> when you well know I never endea∣voured
to give him any light about them.
In this second letter indeed I have, at your re∣quest,
endeavoured to explain some part of
them. But there are some others, which I
am so far from being able to explain, that I
never heard of them before, and cannot ima∣gine
what you mean by them. Possibly they
may be some <HI>arcana</HI> of the Boeotian Ana∣lysis,
explicable only by the <HI>Philosophia
