<HEAD>ADVICE
TO THE
Tories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Wickedness of the
Times hath been a just
Complaint in all Ages,
Passion having been ever
powerful and on the side
of Vice, which is the great∣est
Enemy to Religion. But in the pre∣sent
Age, Vice and Scepticism join their
Forces to destroy Christianity. If Men
were wicked in former Times, their
Wickedness was attended with Remorse
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
and Shame. But now they are openly
and couragiously wicked, being so upon
Principle, and endeavouring to support
themselves by Argument, and by the ge∣neral
Example of the Age. Whatever
may occasion this Growth of Impiety,
the Zeal you at all Times express for
the Church, encourages me to think
your Endeavours will not be wanting to
put a Stop to it: At least, it is to be
hoped, that you will avoid being your
selves instrumental to the propagating so
great an Evil.</P>
<P>Two Things there are which influence
Men with a Regard for Religion; a
Sense of its <HI>Truth,</HI> and a Sense of its
<HI>Usefulness.</HI> The first of these can affect
those alone who are really Christians:
The latter may have a more extensive
Influence, and cause even Infidels to pay
an outward Respect to that whereon
they apprehend the common Welfare to
depend. In proportion as you lessen ei∣ther
of these Motives, you do a manifest
Disservice to Religion. But your being
at any Time guilty of Sedition or Re∣bellion
against that Sovereign to whom
you have sworn Allegiance, will very
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
much contribute to make both lose their
Force upon the Minds of Men. For, If
the Christian Religion doth not restrain
Men from wicked Actions, such as
Fraud, Violence, Perjury, and the like,
how is it useful to Mankind? Or if it
doth, how can you pretend to believe
it, and at the same Time act in direct
Opposition to its Precepts? And what
Thoughts will other Men be tempted
to have of Religion, when its great
Assertors shall shew themselves to be∣lieve
nothing of what they assert?</P>
<P>I have neither so ill an Opinion of
you, nor so good a one of your Ad∣versaries,
as to believe every Thing
which they report to your Disadvan∣tage.
But as it is now the general
Discourse and Suspicion, that many of
you, who are bound by the most so∣lemn
Oaths to be true and faithful
Subjects to King <HI>George,</HI> do neverthe∣less,
contrary to those Oaths, endeavour
to undermine his Government, and in∣troduce
that of the Person whom you
have abjured; I thought it my Duty
to dissuade you from so infamous a
Practice, not with any Intention to fix
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
the Scandal, but to remove the Cause
of it, if there be any on your Side;
or, if there be not, to prevent your
being provoked to deserve it by the
unmerited Censures and Reproaches of
your Enemies.</P>
<P>Those among you, who remain firm
to the Allegiance you have sworn, cannot
be displeased that I endeavour to make
others like your selves: And if this
Paper fall into the Hands of any who
have betrayed Faith, Honour and Reli∣gion,
their own Conscience will be the
best Justification for the making it Pub∣lick;
I shall, therefore, not as a Po∣litician,
who is carrying on a private
Scheme for the Interest of any Prince
or Ministry, but as a Christian, who in∣tends
the Advancement and Honour of
Religion, proceed to lay before you the
ill Consequences, which the Violation of
your Oaths is like to have upon that
Church for whose Interest you profess
so great Concern.</P>
<P>It is plain then, that the publick and
avowed Breach of your Oaths would
prove the greatest Injury to the Church,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
inasmuch as it would be destructive of
all Religion. If Oaths are no longer
to be esteemed sacred, what sufficient
Restraint can be found for the irregular
Inclinations of Men? Common mutual
Faith is the great Support of Society;
and an Oath, as it is the highest Obli∣gation
to keep our Faith inviolate, be∣comes
the great Instrument of Justice
and Intercourse between Men. What∣ever,
therefore, lessens the Sacredness
or Authority of an Oath must be acknow∣ledged
at the same time to be highly
detrimental both to the Church and the
Commonwealth.</P>
<P>Men, by concealing other Crimes, may
prevent the Scandal of them; but the
Perjury of those who should attempt to
subvert the Government is an avowed
and open Crime. Other Crimes may
admit of some Diminution, either on
Account of the Inconsiderableness of
their Object, or the Infirmity which at∣tends
the Commission of them: But
this is a Crime of the highest Nature,
not only as it affects the Person of the
Prince under whose Protection we live,
but as it is in a peculiar Manner, above
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
other Crimes, an Insult on the Deity it
self. State-Perjury doth not spring from
a sudden Gust of Passion; it is no sensual
Vice to which you are stimulated by the
Frailty of the Flesh. It is a cool, deli∣berate
Crime, and sheweth a stedfast
Resolution to do Evil without Regard
either to God or Man.</P>
<P>It may, indeed, seem needless to use
any more Arguments in order to con∣vince
you, either that the Cause of Vir∣tue
and Religion is likely to suffer by the
common Practice of Perjury and Breach
of Faith, or that the Interest of the
Church is inseparable from the Interest
of Religion. But I shall insist further
on a Point which, how clear soever, is
not much attended to. It cannot be de∣nied,
that the visible Interest of the
Church depends upon her Credit and
Reputation; which Men will be apt to
measure by the Reputation of those who
stand up most zealously in her Defence.
If therefore you, who would be thought
true Sons of the Church, and warm As∣sertors
of her Priviledges, should lose
your own Credit by Perfidiousness and
Perjury, how great a Blemish will you
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
throw upon her? How must the Ho∣nour
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> sink in
the Opinion of those among us, who
are already <HI>hardly Christians,</HI> when they
see the basest Immoralities practised to
promote her Interest? There are too
many who cannot or will not be at
the Pains to inquire into the Merits of
the Cause; but, judging only by Appear∣ances,
will, from the Lives of Church∣men,
form their Idea of the Church it
self. Consider therefore what Scandal
you give, and how far you participate
the Guilt of these Men, whom you en∣courage
and harden in their Contempt
of the Church, by making her a Pretext
for Hypocrisy and Prevarication.</P>
<P>Besides, you are to reflect that the
Ills of Rebellion are certain, but the
Event doubtful: And considering the
Disadvantages the Rebels must lie under,
you ought in Reason to apprehend the
worst. In case therefore of a Defeat,
what Quarter are you to expect, I will
not say for your selves, but for that
Church whose Interest you pretend to
interweave with your own? One Thing
is evident, that if the Rulers among
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
the Whigs are, what by many of
you they are represented to be, dis∣affected
to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
they will then have the fairest Pretext,
as well as Opportunity, to destroy
her. It may be thought necessary to
bind those who call themselves the
<HI>Church-Party</HI> with something stronger
than Oaths.</P>
<Q>Dicta nihil metuere nihil perjuria curant.</Q>
<P>And with the same Iniquity that her
Name was used to sanctify the wicked
Actions of her Children, may their Wick∣edness
be then made use of in order to
throw an <HI>Odium</HI> upon her. This is <HI>Argu∣mentum
ad Hominem,</HI> and should influ∣ence
those among you who are for∣ward
to think the worst of your Ad∣versaries.
What Thoughts or Resolu∣tions
the Whigs may have with re∣gard
to the Church, I know not:
But I am sure they give her the deep∣est
Wounds who dishonour her by
their. Friendship; who would be
thought zealous to promote her In∣terest,
at the same Time that they
deny her Power in their Lives and
Practices.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
That which, in the Eye of Reason,
gives any Church or Religion the Ad∣vantage
above others, is the Influence it
hath upon the Lives of its Professors.
It is upon this foot that the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> ever espousing the Cause of
Virtue, Loyalty, and all Things lauda∣ble,
in opposition to Libertines, Rebels,
and Fanaticks, hath maintain'd her Cre∣dit
and Esteem with wise Men. And if
we are really concern'd to support her
Honour, the right Way is to put her
Principles in practice, to be true to our
Oaths and Engagements, and live in every
respect as becometh peaceable and loyal
Subjects. The Diffenters have been a
long time stigmatiz'd for Men of no
Loyalty, not acting upon Principle, but
govern'd by the narrow unsteady Views
of Passion and Interest. But will not the
Satyr be doubly keen upon our selves,
if ever we are found guilty of those
very Things that we so heartily condemn
in others?</P>
<P>It is no easy matter to find out Eva∣sions
in so plain a Case; and yet it can
hardly be suppos'd that a Man, who has
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
any Sense of Religion, should commit
Perjury without some Salvo to his Con∣science.
Perhaps you will say, that if it
be never lawful for a Subject to break
his Oath of Allegiance to his King, then
the Revolution cannot be justified: Or, if
it may sometimes be allow'd, why not
now as well as then? I answer, when
any Person, by Forfeiture or Abdication,
loseth Dominion, He is no longer Sove∣reign:
Now the Subject swore Allegiance
to the Sovereign, and not to the Person:
When therefore the Person ceaseth to be
Sovereign, the Allegiance ceaseth to be
due to him, and the Oath of course
to bind. In the Judgment of most Men
this was the Case at the Revolution. But
nothing like this can be pretended now.
King <HI>George</HI> legally administers that Go∣vernment
to which he came with the
joint Consent and Acclamations of his
People; there being nothing done by
which he is less <HI>King</HI> now than he was
at the time you swore to him: And con∣sequently
there can be no Parallel be∣tween
the Revolution and the present
Case. I will not undertake to justifie
every thing that is now done in point of
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
Policy; but neither will impolitick Mea∣sures
justify Subjects in taking the same
Steps they formerly did on the score of
illegal Measures. It is one thing to sub∣vert
a State, and another to turn out a
Ministry.</P>
<P>If you should have the Hardiness to
object, that King <HI>George</HI> is in truth no
rightful King; and that therefore you are
not obliged to pay Obedience to him:
I ask, how you came then to acknow∣ledge
him and swear to him as rightful
<HI>King</HI>? You will surely be ashamed to
own, that in so doing you acted against
your Opinion; or that since that time
your Eyes have been open'd, by the
Disgrace of Friends, or the Loss of an
Employment. But though we should
grant that he had originally no Right
to the Crown, yet when a Prince is once
in Possession of it, and you have sworn
Allegiance to him, you are no longer at
liberty to enquire by what unrighteous
steps he might have obtain'd it. But
there is nothing of that so much as
suspected in the present Case; it being
known to every body that <HI>King George</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
came to the Crown without Force or Ar∣tifice,
meerly in Compliance with the
Laws of the Land, and the unanimous
Request of his People.</P>
<P>To determine the Rights of Princes
is a difficult Point, as requiring more
Skill in the Laws, more Knowledge of
particular Facts, more Leisure, and more
Understanding than most Men are Masters
of. But it is an easy matter to know
the Obligation and plain Sense of an
Oath. You know evidently that you
have sworn to King <HI>George,</HI> and abjured
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and that you ought not to
forswear your self. But, Do you as evi∣dently
know that Hereditary is prefe∣rable
to Parliamentary Right, and that
the Hereditary Right belongs to the <HI>Pre∣tender</HI>?
If you do not, as I am sure you
cannot, why will you violate the plain
manifest Duties of Religion, under pre∣tence
of observing what is at best but
obscure and dubious? But though the
<HI>Pretender</HI>'s Right to the Crown were ne∣ver
so clear, it would not therefore be a
clear Point that you ought to be assisting
to him. On the contrary, it would be
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
clear that you <HI>ought</HI> not, since you have
sworn that you <HI>would</HI> not.</P>
<P>I must repeat to you, that what hath
been said was not done with a Design to
spread or confirm the Reports of your
Adversaries; but only to contribute, so
far as in me lay, to remove or prevent
any just Occasion of them. Least of all
was it my Intention to insinuate any thing
dishonourable of the Clergy, for whose
Character I have a high Respect, and
whom I verily take to have been injured
by the Reports of warm Men. I shall
say no more, but leave you to consider
the Oaths which you have taken.</P>
