<HEAD TYPE="sub">DONNA ISABELLA to DONNA

<P>EACH day that dawns on me is
attended by some new wo.
This morning the Duke sent for me,
and addressed me in the following
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
words: "You have been in danger
of degrading yourself by a marriage
with a vile fellow,—who, if he has
his deserts, will spend the remain∣der
of his days in the mines.</P>
<P>"As a punishment, <HI>you</HI> were con∣demned
to pass the remainder of <HI>your</HI>
days in a convent's solitary gloom:
But a brighter prospect now discloses
itself to your view. The Count of
Altina has notified his ambition to be
allied to the house of Arandina. His
family, though not of the <HI>first</HI> class,
is ancient and noble. He will be
here in a few days:—Prepare
therefore to receive your destined
Lord."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
SCARCELY had the Duke ceased to
speak, when I sunk motionless at
his feet. This accident he attribu∣ted
to excess of joy; and in that mis∣take
did he continue till about an
hour ago, when the receipt of the
inclosed letter undeceived him.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DON JOHN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You will not, I trust, attri∣bute
my conduct to so contemptible
a vice as ingratitude, when I solicit
the execution of my former sentence
in preference to my becoming Coun∣tess
of Altina. As the misfortunes
of my parents early determined me
never to marry, I flattered myself,
that, beneath this roof, I should be
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
sheltered from the storms of fortune;
and that, when age, with its con∣comitant
infirmities, should attack
my benefactor, I might, by unre∣mitting
attention to the preservation
of his health, and by anticipating
all his wishes, express my gratitude
for his past goodness in protecting
a helpless orphan. But since he no
longer esteems me worthy of his pro∣tection,
I will now retire to that
cloister whence his goodness called
me, and will there offer up daily
prayers for his happiness. In this
manner do I mean to spend the re∣mainder
of a life, which, had it not
been for your goodness, might have
been passed in penury and want,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
You will, I trust, pardon my refusal
of the Count Altina's hand: A re∣fusal
which it would not have been
in my power to give, had I not had
the honour to be connected with
you; as the small stock of merit
which I possess would never have
been sufficient to procure me the no∣tice
of a Spanish grandee. I re∣main,</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA</HEAD>
<P>POOR Isabella's sufferings in∣crease
daily. You know that
she has refused the Count of Altina,
and that she is now condemned,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
without hopes of a reprieve, to pass
her days in the convent of Ven∣tina.
Her conduct has been highly
proper in refusing to marry Altina,
when her hand only was at her dis∣posal.
I endeavour to comfort her
as much as possible, and to support
her in all her distresses. That she
may receive from Heaven that sup∣port
which she so much needs, shall
be the constant prayer of her af∣flicted
friend.</P>
<P>SHE is to be with you in about three
weeks. I think with pleasure that
amidst all her distresses, Heaven has
spared so amiable and so real a friend
as she has ever found in you. I
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
wondered much that the Duke so
readily gave up all thoughts of mar∣rying
her to Altina. But it seems
he did not think it consistent with
his <HI>dignity</HI> to <HI>force</HI> her consent; as
<HI>that,</HI> he said, would have appeared
as if the match was an object of im∣portance
to his family;—now, said
he, there is no family, by a con∣nection
with which the house of
Arandina would receive additional
lustre.</P>
<P>THUS, for once, has poor Isa∣bella
been benefited by that pride
which has been the source of her
<HI>own</HI> and her <HI>parents</HI> wo! Heaven
support her, poor girl. I must go

Count of Altina, as cannot well be
conceived. Not that I suppose Isa∣bella
would bestow her hand on
Altina, unless she were compelled
by that tyrant her uncle, who is
indebted to her for the life which he
now possesses — I will not say <HI>enjoys;</HI>
as it is impossible that such a tyrant
should find, enjoyment in any thing
but in torturing those whom fortune
has subjected to him. Do, let me
know how, you are. I fear you
are still an invalid. For mercy's
sake write without delay. All I
ask, is to be told that you are
well and happy; for if such is the

nobly. You will at once possess the
pity and the respect of those who
shall become acquainted with your
sad tale. Next week I shall cease
to rank Isabella amongst the number
of my <HI>correspondents;</HI> she shall ever
possess the first place in the catalogue
of my <HI>friends.</HI> That you may,
within these walls, experience peace,
is all which I can hope for; hap∣piness
will, I fear, never prove
the lot of my friend on this side
the grave. But rest assured, that
such distinguished virtue as a∣dorns
Isabella will, in a <HI>future</HI>
state, meet that reward which
Heaven often for a time with∣holds,
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
but never in the end re∣fuses.</P>
<P>WHEN our prospects in this world
are overshadowed with impene∣trable
gloom, it is at once our inte∣rest

with the eye of hope the bright
prospects of a future state. There
the virtuous will experience bliss

<P>I HAVE just received Laura's
kind letter. I am much indebt∣ed
to it for the small share of tran∣quillity
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
I now enjoy. Small, in∣deed,
is the portion of happiness
which I ever possessed; but it was
more than I deserved. This morn∣ing
I shall consecrate to the melan∣choly
employment of bidding adieu
to several old friends. I think I
hear you express your astonishment
at the term, as you have always
esteemed poor Isabella a friendless
and deserted orphan; and such she
is. But the friends, to whom I
must now bid adieu, are the vene∣rable
oaks which surround these
ancient walls; — those oaks which
have for ages sheltered beneath their
branches the ancestors of her who is
now to bid them an <HI>eternal</HI> adieu.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
I feel a regret at parting with them
that may to you appear weak and
childish, and perhaps is so. But
when I reflect that, through the
whole course of my misfortunes,
they have received me under their
shade, that they have never censu∣red
my imprudence, and have even
appeared to express their sympathy
with my sufferings by solemn wa∣vings
of their aged arms, my sorrow
at leaving them is great. — But to
what an excess of weakness does my
grief lead me! Whither am I run∣ning!
With what nonsense am I
pestering Laura? Adieu. I can
no longer restrain my tears. Wretch∣ed
as I am, I can never be <HI>completely</HI>

<P>AS a few days will now termi∣nate
our correspondence, I
cannot permit the arrival of that pe∣riod
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
without expressing my gratitude
for the comfort I have ever experi∣enced

As I am now to enjoy the

(for such I shall ever esteem you),
I have, at the request of that ami∣able
man Father Alberto, deposited
in his hands all your letters, as well
as copies of all that I ever wrote to
you. Those of Alonzo he has ob∣tained
from the Duke. He says,
that, when we are parted, he shall
enjoy a melancholy pleasure in per∣using
the letters which contain a
sketch of my misfortunes. Oh how
truly amiable he is! How I shall

regret his loss! I which, however,
will in some degree be compensated
by his correspondence; and he like∣wise
assures me, that no year shall
elapse without his visiting the con∣vent

<P>I HAVE just been visiting the
apartment which was allotted to my
father when he was an inhabitant
of this Castle. I could not refrain
from tears. Indeed I never visit
that apartment without weeping, as
the train of ideas which rush into
my mind at the sight of it are very
melancholy indeed. Oh how often
have I wept, when the good old

woman that nursed him has descri∣bed
him to me. She speaks of him
with rapture, and mingles her tears
with mine, good creature! She
has never ceased to weep since
the news of my departure was
known. Oh, Laura, what do I not
suffer!</P>
<P>OH Heaven, look down with pity;
and, when it shall please thee, ter∣minate
by death the woes of a
wretch to whom life is a heavy
burden; a burden, however, which
she hopes to bear with becoming
patience, till time shall being the

<P>YESTERDAY I entered these
walls; and I blush to own,
that when the iron gate, grating on
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
its hinges, closed with apparent re∣luctance,
I wept. Not even the
appearance of Laura, who flew to
embrace me, was sufficient to sup∣port
my drooping spirits. I instant∣ly
retired to her apartment, and
there I remained till the hour of rest.
Laura endeavoured to sooth my agi∣tated
soul, but in vain; for I have
never ceased to weep since my arri∣val.
Oh what I felt when, in pas∣sing
through the saloon, I found it
filled with weeping domestics! To
see the poor old woman, that had
nursed my father, wringing her
hands in an agony of despair, and
tearing those venerable locks that
were silvered by the hand of time!
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
Oh, it was too much! who could
bear it? — And when I was enter∣ing
the carriage, the poor old house-dog
licked my hand, and gave a
short howl; as if he knew that I
was wretched, and pitied me. Oh
what I suffered when you waved
your hand from the battlements,
and bid me adieu in all the silent
agony of wo! Oh God, it was too
much! At our sad parting, the
conscious heavens wept; all nature
seemed overcast with melancholy
gloom. Ah, no! not <HI>nature;</HI> but
my <HI>heart</HI> was sad; and when all
<HI>within</HI> is dark and gloomy, nought

be true (and true it is) never shall

I again behold the laughing fields,

<P>I MUST begin this letter with
imploring your forgiveness of
the deceit which I have practised on
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
you: but I was unwilling that you
should be acquainted with my in∣tention
of retiring to this sad retreat,
till it should be too late to prevent
it; as I dreaded the force of your
attachment to me, unworthy as I
am, might hurry you into the com∣mission
of some violence which
would have involved both of us in
fresh difficulties. When you have
heard the motives that influenced,
you will, I trust, approve the con∣duct
of Isabella. My uncle gave
me the choice of two <HI>evils,</HI> and I
have chosen what to me appeared
the least. I was necessitated either
to marry Altina or to retire to this
convent. My reasons for preferring
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
the latter were two. The <HI>first,</HI> that
I scorn so far to injure any man
as to yield my <HI>hand</HI> to his solicita∣tion,
when my <HI>heart</HI> was devoted to
another. The <HI>second,</HI> that I ima∣gined
you would suffer much less
from seeing me for ever secluded
from the world, than from seeing
me the property of another. In∣deed,
had I become Countess of
Altina, I could not, consistently
with the dictates of honour or of
virtue, have fulfilled my promise of
corresponding with you; a promise
which I made merely to preserve
the life of my uncle, as I dreaded
the effects of unappeased anger.
Had I not been influenced by so
weighty a reason, I never would
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
have granted a request, the com∣pliance
with which will certainly
tend to embitter the remainder of our
respective lives, as well as constant∣ly
call to our remembrance, and
perhaps greatly increase, an unhappy
passion, which can never now be
gratisied; for whenever the year of
probation shall expire, I must assume
the veil, and bind myself by the
most solemn vows to consecrate to
Heaven the remainder of a life that
has indeed been wretched. If you
wish to regain that peace you have
lost, and not to embitter the re∣mainder
of my days, you will re∣lease
me from my promise; — if
you are so blinded by your passion
as to insist on its performance, you
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
shall find that the laws of honour
will never be violated by me.</P>
<P>DIRECT your answer to me at the

<P>OH Isabella, how have you de∣ceived
me! Was this the ex∣cursion
you so slightly mentioned in
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
your last letter? You are indeed ig∣norant
when you are to revisit Vil∣larea.
Had you entertained for Alonzo
that regard you prosess towards him,
you would have imitated the con∣duct
of your heroic mother; you
would have blessed Alonzo with
your hand. He would have asked
from Heaven no other boon; he
would have supported in afflu∣ence,
he would, have adored Isabel∣la:
He does adore her; he ever <HI>must</HI>
adore her. But why so obstinately
cruel? why regret that she is bound
by honour to correspond with Alon∣zo?
why mention that favour as the
the price of her uncle's life? Her
commands will alone be sufficient to
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
prevent Alonzo from terminating
the existence of such a monster. But
why am I never more to behold the
amiable Isabella? Why am I doomed
to perpetual misery? Oh, Isabella!
'tis to the pride of your uncle, and to
the cold insensibitity of your friend,

<P>I WAS, as you observed, greatly af∣fected
by your departure, and do
not wonder that you were as much so;
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
but I trust, that, the bitter scene
once past, you will become every

will be moderated by time. You
are, undoubtedly, a great object of
pity; I never knew a greater: but
still, amidst all your distresses, you
will find great consolation by reflect∣ing
on your retiring from the world
so early; for, believe me, we are
better calculated to struggle with,
misfortune in youth than in age.
At the first dawn of life the world is
tolerable, because it is novel: but in
the evening of our day (for the life
of man, when compared with eter∣nity,
is no more), when life has lost
its only charm of novelty; the an∣chor

of hope, unless it rest beyond
die grave, proves but a slight support
to the being who, oppressed with
misfortune, relies on it alone for
comfort and for happiness.</P>
<P>YOUR uncle sets out for Madrid
to-morrow, having received a sudden
and unexpected call to court. He
proposes writing to you on his re∣turn.
I am to accompany him to the
capital, where, he says, our stay is
to be short. I am sorry to hear, that
the Count of Altina is much dis∣pleased
with your uncle's conduct;
not so much by his refusal, as by
the manner of it: he has, I hear,
vowed to be revenged; but I trust

a destiny which is indeed severe:
but I am grateful to heaven for the

<P>I HAVE written to Alonzo, in∣forming
him of my return, and the
motives that induced me to prefer it
to the hand of Altina. He seems
much disatisfied with my conduct,
and even accuses me of treachery;
but he will, I trust, in the calm mo∣ments
of reflection, approve the, con∣duct
of Isabella. I trust my uncle
will not feel the effects of Altina's
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
vengeance: I, alas! cannot avert
them, as I did those of the injured
Alonzo. I have no other heart to
offer as a bribe; and if I <HI>had,</HI> Altina
would not esteem the atonement to
his injured honour sufficient. How
fatal to repose are the effects of
pride! The truth of this assertion is
proved by every page of my sad
tale. Pride has been the source of
all my parents' wo, and of my own.
Had my uncle not been proud, Isa∣bella
had never been wretched; or
at least not so wretched as she now
is. But what am I saying? am I
not censuring the conduct of my
uncle; and in so doing, am I not to
blame? I may in private lament;

the errors of one whose protection
I once enjoyed; though now I can,

<P>SCARCE had I finished the per∣usal
of your last, — where you
observe how fatal to happiness are
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
the effects of pride, — when the Duke
was brought home in the arms of
two servants, covered with wounds
and blood. He was followed by
Alonzo, who was also wounded; but
not so severely. When the Duke
was placed on a couch, and the sur∣geons
had dressed his wounds, Alon∣zo
addressed him in the following
words: "Learn, Don John, from
this night's adventure, that a man
may act with <HI>honour,</HI> though his <HI>an∣cestors</HI>
were not <HI>ennobled.</HI>" On say∣ing
these words, he retired to his
own house, attended by the sur∣geons;
who have; declared that <HI>he</HI> is
not in any danger. About the <HI>Duke</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
they art still doubtful; but I hope
the best.</P>
<P>FROM Alonzo, whom I this day
visited, I learned the following ac∣count
of the adventure. As the
Duke was returning home in his
coach, he passed through a retired
street, where the carriage was at∣tacked,
by three Villains armed with
daggers. They ordered the coach∣man
to stop instantly. The Duke,
on hearing their voices, and seeing
them attempt to force open the door
of the carriage, opened the door on
the oposite side, and jumped out. He
then set his back against a wall; and,
throwing his cloke over his left arm,
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
stood on his defence. He was in∣stantly
attacked by the ruffians, who
wounded him desperately; his lac∣keys
having in the mean time run
off, leaving their master to be assas∣sinated.
Whilst the Duke was en∣gaged
in this unequal contest, Alon∣zo
happened to pass that way. He
easily recognized the person who
was calling loudly for assistance; and
without delay stabbed two of the
villains, who instantly fell; whilst
the other is secured and has con∣fessed
that he was hired by the Count
of Altina to murder the Duke.—You,
Isabella, refused to bestow
your, hand on one man when your
heart was the property of another
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
Heaven has, you see, rewarded you;
by delivering you from being united
to a man who is in fact an assassin.
A character; alas! too common in
Spain: The Duke's misfortune has
not produced the least change in his
sentiments. I flattered myself, that
the person to whom he owed his
life might have been rewarded with
the hand of Isabella: but, on my
suggesting the matter to him, he was
much enraged; and said, "that he
would rather have experienced a still
more hateful death, than have his
life prolonged only to behold the
disgrace of his family! — A family
that will soon be extinct; and of
which it may then be said, that, du∣ring
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
a course of nine hundred years,
it has retained its nobility unconta∣minated.
As to the young man
(continued he) who assisted me
in dispatching those villains, I shall
reward him in a manner becoming
his station, by bestowing on him a
large sum of money; — a reward
much fitter for a, merchant than an
illustrious wife!"—How Alonzo
will bear this fresh insult I know
not; but as he is strongly attached
to you, I trust you will be able to
pacify his just resentment.</P>
<P>I. FLATTER myself that you are
now somewhat more composed than

that I communicate to you the dread∣ful
intelligence.</P>
<P>THREE nights ago, this convent
was near being reduced to ashes by
the heedlessness of a servant, who
neglected to extinguish the fire of
the kitchen before she went to rest.
About eleven at night, I was alarm∣ed
by the cry of fire; and as soon as I
had left my apartment, I found that,
owing to the violence of the wind
which then blew high, the flames
had made a considerable progress.
I ordered the doors to be instantly
thrown open; and advised every one
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
to secure herself by flight: an ad∣vice
which was followed by all but the
amiable girl, who was so lately
added to our society. After we had
retired to a neighbouring church,
I inquired if all the sisterhood were
there in safety; and was shocked to
find that she was still missing. I in∣stantly
returned to the convent,
where I found the flames still raging
with the utmost violence, notwith∣standing
every attempt to extinguish
them; but in vain I endeavoured to
learn any thing concerning the love∣ly
Isebella. You will easily conceive
what must have been my feelings.
The next morning, however, I re∣ceived
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
the melancholy information
that she was seen, after we had quit∣ted
the convent, lying at the foot of
the altar: but the confusion was so
great, that no one was sufficiently
recollected to render her the least
assistance; and as that part of the
chapel was totally destroyed, there is,
alas! no room to doubt that she pe∣rished
in the flames. All attempts
to discover even the least remains of
the dear girl have proved totally in∣effectual.
You will do me the ju∣stice
to believe, that amongst all the
fatal consequences of this sad catas∣trophe,

The sad catastrophe, as you obser∣ved,

indeed sustained a loss, in some re∣spects,
severer than mine; as I was,

<P>THE happiest of beings has now
the pleasure to address you;
and to inform you, that Isabella,
<PB N="111" REF="110"/>
whom you doubtless consider as no
more, is in perfect health in New
Spain. To explain this mystery,
you must know, that after I had em∣barked
for that country, whence I
never thought to return, I found it
would be impossible to sail till one
in the morning. On receiving this
intelligence, I got into a boat, and
went on shore to contemplate, for
the last time, those hated walls that
deprived me of Isabella. As the
convent is, you know, almost close
to the shore, I soon found myself
there; and desiring the men to wait
a little, I quitted them to indulge
myself in walking round the walls of
the garden. But as I was going to
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
return to the boat, observing the
convent in flames, and the doors
thrown wide open, I instantly flew
to the gate, and passed unobserved
through the crowd of nuns who
were rushing out, and who were
too much engaged by attention to
their own preservation even to ob∣serve
me. As I knew that my Isa∣bella
had not yet assumed the con∣ventual
dress, I was sure she had
not escaped me in the crowd. I
flew therefore to that part of the
convent where she resided; and as
I passed through the chapel, I ob∣served
a female prostrate at the foot
of the altar; who, on a nearer ap∣proach,
proved to be that dear angel,
<PB N="113" REF="112"/>
who had fallen down in a swoon, and
lay there without any signs of life.
I, however, lost no time; but,
catching the lovely burden in my
arms, bore her, still senseless, to
the boat that waited for me; which,
as the nuns had all fled the other
way, I reached totally unobserved.
No sooner had I placed her in the
boat, than I tried every possible
means to restore her; but to no pur∣pose.
My agonies were now incon∣ceivable,
but I still continued my
endeavours; and after rowing about
thirteen minutes, we reached the
vessel, which was just going to hoist
sail. The Captain, who had ob∣served
the fire, easily guessed whence
<PB N="114" REF="113"/>
I had stolen so invaluable a treasure,
and objected to receiving her for fear
of consequences; till observing that
she had not the dress of a nun, at
my earnest entreaties he consented
to receive the dear girl; who now,
to my inexpressible joy, began to
discover signs of life. As soon as
we were on board, the vessel got
under way, whilst I conveyed Isa∣bella
into the great cabin; where
she was soon restored, owing to the
kindness of a lady, who, with her
husband, was going to New Spain.
As soon as she recovered and learned
her situation, she instantly relapsed,
and it was with difficulty that she was
the second time restored at all. When
<PB N="115" REF="114"/>
she came to herself, I informed her
of the situation in which I had found
her; and that, had I not arrived at
the instant I did, she must have pe∣rished
in the flames, as every one
had fled and left her to meet her
fate. She in <HI>time</HI> became more re∣conciled
to her situation; but at <HI>first</HI>
she earnestly intreated to be put on
shore. This, however, the Captain
assured her, was impossible; as the
ship run nine notes in the hour, and
our distance was then near twenty
miles from the shores of Spain. She
expressed her gratitude to me for
preserving her life, but regretted
that I had taken advantage of the
general confusion to elope with her.
<PB N="116" REF="115"/>
I pleaded only in my defence, that
I was human, and that no man could
have neglected to embrace so heaven∣born
an opportunity of possessing all
he held dear on earth. But, an∣swered
she, my uncle will always
suspect that mine was a <HI>voluntary</HI>
escape, and will never pardon me.
Nay, perhaps good Alberto may
even suspect me (and here she wept
bitterly.) If Laura still live (Hea∣ven
grant she do), every she may su∣spect
Isabella. — I assured her, that
those who knew Isabella would never
suppose her capable of acting but
as an angel would do, were it in her
situation. As to Laura, I could only
say, that I <HI>thought</HI> she passed me in
<PB N="117" REF="116"/>
the crowd which rushed out as I
entered; and that as I saw no one in
the convent, I hoped and believed
she was safe. In about a week, I
presumed to solicit the blessing of
her hand, exerted all the persuasion
I was master of, and with great
difficulty prevailed on her to confer
on me a reward that would have
overpaid whole ages of misery. As
there was a priest on board, who was
also a passenger, we were married,
and have now been here five months;
but no ship having failed since we
arrived, I could not sooner commun∣icate
to you the agreeable intelli∣gence
contained in this letter. It is

<P>LITTLE did you know the heart
of Alberto, if you thought that
when the heavenly news of your
<PB N="122" REF="121"/>
escape reached him, he would, with
all the insensibility of a Dutch pro∣fessor
of ethics, proceed to inquire
how far you were culpable in suf∣fering
yourself to be so delivered.
Far from making these inquiries, I
had no sooner read the letter than I
burst into tears of joy — of ecstacy;
and have never ceased, since I heard
the news, to thank the Heaven that
delivered you from death and from
misery.</P>
<P>IT is with regret I inform you,
that the Duke can never be made
acquainted with the; story of your
escape; as he has been for some
<PB N="123" REF="122"/>
time delirious, and all attempts
to recal his banished reason have
proved ineffectual. This sad cala∣mity
was occasioned totally by his
pride; which, of late, became ex∣cessive
indeed! He is now attended
by a medical man, who never loses
sight of him for an instant; but
who says, he does not apprehend
that his life will last long, as his
blood is in a horrid state.</P>
<P>I WOULD wish you to return as
soon as possible that, should any
thing happen, you may be ready to
claim your family possessions. Poor
man! it is really dreadful to see how
<PB N="124" REF="123"/>
his pride increases! Even now he
desires that no servant will present
him any thing but on the knee; and
gives every day some fresh instance
of growing arrogance. He is indeed
an object of pity and terror to all
who see him. Heaven restore him
to reason before it call him hence.</P>
<P>LAURA is, as you will hear from
herself, in health, and happy be∣yond
conception to find <HI>that Isabella
living</HI> over whom she had shed so
many tears. As she writes by this
packet, I shall now conclude with
wishing, that as much happiness

<P>No sooner did I behold the
well-known hand of Isabella,
than I swooned for joy. No sooner
<PB N="127" REF="126"/>
was I recovered than I tore open the
letter with the utmost anxiety. I
was so much affected by the contents,
that it was with difficulty I ever got
through it. I wept, but it was from
excess of joy. Oh, Isabella! su∣spected
you of having acted impro∣perly!
— No. Joy so wholly occu∣pies
my breast, that suspicion will
find no admission; and if it did, at
the name of <HI>Isabella</HI> it would vanish
— the charm would be too powerful
for it. Oh, Isabella! hasten to Old
Spain: I die with anxiety to embrace
you.</P>
<P>I HAVE read Alonzo's letter to
Alberto, and have sent yours to that
<PB N="128" REF="127"/>
excellent man. You are to receive
from him an account of the Duke's
misfortune. Poor wretch! cruel as
he has been, I pity him. He is a
sad instance of the melancholy effect
of pride, when carried to that dread∣ful
length. Happy had it been for
him, if all his ancestors had been
honest peasants, instead of illustrious
Dukes. The only effect that a long
train of coroneted ancestry ought to
produce in the mind of their repre∣sentative
is, to encourage him in at∣tempting
to imitate the virtues of
those illustrious men from whom he
boasts his descent. If it produce
this effect, a long train of ancestors
may indeed be esteemed an import∣ant
<PB N="129" REF="128"/>
advantage; but if it be only
considered as conserring on us a
power of insulting those whose ance∣stors
were unknown, it may be just∣ly
esteemed a misfortune. Of the
truth of this assertion the poor Duke
is too fatal an instance — But I
must conclude, as Father Alberto
has sent for my letter that he may
inclose it with his. Do, write to

<P>I HAVE been much questioned
concerning Isabella's escape by
all our sisterhood; many of whom
<PB N="162" REF="131"/>
now recollect having seen a young
man rush into the convent the mo∣ment
the doors were opened. They
all rejoice greatly that the dear an∣gel
has escaped, and are very anxious

cannot, however, be <HI>so</HI> anxious as I
am. I believe there is not <HI>one</HI> here

where she was till the ship had fail∣ed;
and if she did, I do not think
her conduct reprehensible. The

noised about, and has every where
occasioned much joy. Several people
who visited the convent have desired
to see me, though I was totally; un∣known
to them, merely that they

<P>I WAS this day alarmed with a
great noise issuing from the
Duke's apartment. I instantly went
<PB N="165" REF="136"/>
to learn the reason of the tumult;
and the moment I entered the room,
perceived the Duke weltering in his
blood. The physician who attended
him told me, that he had left the
Duke only an instant, whilst he went
to the next apartment to bring him
some medicine; and when he return∣ed,
he found him in this horrid con∣dition,
with a dagger in his hand;
which it seems he had procured, but
<HI>how</HI> I have not been able to disco∣ver.
When I arrived, there were
scarce any signs of life; and in a few
moments the Duke breathed his
last. Poor wretched man! he is a
sad instance of the fatal effects of
pride.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="137"/>
I HAVE ordered several hundred
masses to be offered up for his soul,
that, through the infinite mercy of
the Almighty, she may at last gain
admission into the bright regions of
eternal day; where the vain distinc∣tions
of birth are unknown, and
where humility is preferred to ela∣tion
of heart. May his example
warn others to shun those errors that
embittered his <HI>present,</HI> and clouded
his <HI>prospects</HI> of a <HI>future,</HI> life!</P>
<P>BY his death Isabella succeeds
to his enormous property; which,
had she not escaped that fatal
night, would have devolved to the
<PB N="167" REF="138"/>
Crown. I have sent immediate
intelligence to the Marchioness of
Villarea (for the dukedom being
extinct, that title devolves to the
amiable Isabella); and have, in
her name, taken possession of the
estate.</P>
<P>THE Duke's funeral is fixed for
to-morrow, and as his rank was

<P>YESTERDAY a vessel from
New Spain arrived here; on
board of which there was a lady of
<PB N="170" REF="141"/>
distinction, whose husband had been
drowned in the course of the voyage;
and I was informed that she was in a
very bad state. On receiving this in∣telligence,
I, as was my duty, went
on board the ship, and found that
the lady was of Villarea; and that
her only son, an infant of nine
months old, was with her. She was
so weak as not to be able to speak,
and it was apprehended she could
not survive many days. I had her
landed and placed in one of the best
houses here where she is attended
by the faculty of the place; and
they give me hopes that she may
yet recover. I learnt from one of
her attendants, that you are her

<P>I TOLD you in my last hurried
scrawl, that our Isabella was ar∣rived
in Spain, and what misfortunes
<PB N="173" REF="144"/>
had befallen her. The instant I had
scratched these few lines to you, I
set off for Cadiz, and found the sad
mourner in a very miserable state,
as you will suppose. She had, how∣ever,
recovered her strength so much
as to be able to speak; and showed
great pleasure at my arrival. She
was in bed, and appeared wan and
much exhausted. On a little couch,
near the bed, lay a smiling insant
that seems to inherit all its mo∣ther's
charms. She wept bitterly
on my kissing the sweet babe;
and said, it was all she had by
which to remember her Alonzo.
It was about nine months old;
<PB N="174" REF="145"/>
and she has named it Frederick
Alonzo.</P>
<P>I HOPE God will support her
in all her distresses, of which Hea∣ven
has given her a large propor∣tion.
Indeed I have never ceased
to weep since I arrived here. To
see the mother hang in agony over
her infant son, to hear her sighs,
and to witness. her sorrows, is too
much for me.</P>
<P>OF poor, amiable, Alonzo's death,
I received the following account
from one of her attendants. After
they had embarked for Old Spain,
<PB N="175" REF="146"/>
and were just out of the harbour,
Isabella recollected a casket, con∣taining
the certificate of her mar∣riage,
which she had left on shore.
Alonzo insisted on going to fetch it
himself, and got into a boat; they
were about this time two miles from
shore. Scarce had the boat got half
way, when a hurricane overset her;
all her crew perished, and the ship
was driven out to sea. The hurri∣cane
continued for twelve hours; du∣ring
which time the ship was in the
greatest danger of foundering. When
the hurricane subsided, they found
themselves far out at sea; and the
wind was so contrary, that they
<PB N="176" REF="147"/>
could not return to inquire if the
corpse of Alonzo had been driven on
shore; for there were no hopes of his
life being preserved, as the hurricane
was so violent that no one could
gain the shore. Poor Isabella was
for a long time quite delirious, and
accused herself as the cause of his
death. I trust, however, that she
will yet recover, and that the young
Alonzo will not be deprived of both
his parents.</P>
<P>SHE says, whenever she is able
to hold a pen, she will write to
you. She sends her love to you:
and I must now lay down my
<PB N="177" REF="148"/>
pen, as the physicians are arrived;
and I always attend her when they

<P>O LAURA, what ecstacy will

<PB N="182" REF="153"/>
and I were walking in the grove, a
figure approached us, which so near∣ly
resembled Alonzo that I started;
but on a nearer approach it proved
to be that very Alonzo, whose sup∣posed
death had nearly proved fatal
to Isabella. The interview, as you
will suppose, was interesting in the
extreme. I will not attempt to de∣scribe
it, lest I should not do justice
to such a scene. Suffice it to say,
that pleasure now reigns unrivalled
within these happy walls. The
escape of Alonzo was indeed nearly
miraculous! He alone, of all the
crew, escaped by clinging to a plank,
and at length reached the shore near∣ly

dead with fatigue. His suffer∣ings,
during his absence from Isa∣bella,
were doubtless of the severest
nature. Ignorant of her fate, and
Unable to acquaint her with his
escape, he embarked for Old Spain
in the next fleet that failed; and
immediately oh his arrival, wrote to
