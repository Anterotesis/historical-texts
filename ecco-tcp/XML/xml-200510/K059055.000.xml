into his Sense, and sist his Meaning,

<HEAD>The CATECHISM.</HEAD>
<P>"LET them ask him, whether he
can conceive Velocity without
Motion, or Motion without Extension,
or Extension without Magnitude? If
he answers that he can, let him teach
them to do the same. If he cannot,
let him be asked, how he reconciles
the Idea of a Fluxion which he gives
(P. 13.) with common Sense? Again,
let him be asked, whether nothing be
not the Product of nothing multiply'd
by something? And if so, when the
Difference between the Gnomon and
the Sum of the Rectangles vanisheth,
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
whether the Rectangles themselves do
not also vanish? that is, when <HI>ab</HI> is
nothing, whether A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> be not also
nothing? that is, whether the Momen∣tum
of AB be not nothing? Let him
then be asked, what his Momentums
are good for, when they are thus brought
to nothing? Again, I wish he were
asked to explain the Difference be∣tween
a Magnitude infinitely small and
a Magnitude infinitely diminish'd? If
he faith there is no Difference, then
let him be asked, how he DARES to
explain the Method of Fluxions by the
<HI>Ratio</HI> of Magnitudes infinitely dimi∣nish'd
(P.9.) when Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
hath expresly excluded all Considera∣tion
of Quantities infinitely small? If
this able Vindicator should say that
Quantities infinitely diminish'd are no∣thing
at all, and consequently that,
according to him, the first and last
<HI>Ratios</HI> are Proportions between no∣things,
let him be desired to make
Sense of this or explain what he means
by '<HI>Proportion between nothings.</HI> If
he should say the ultimate Proportions
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
are the Ratios of mere Limits, then
let him be asked how the Limits of
Lines can be proportioned or divided?
After all, who knows but this Gentle∣man,
who hath already complained of
me for an uncommon Way of treating
Mathematics and Mathematicians, may
(as well as the <HI>Cantabrigian</HI>) cry out
<HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Inquisition</HI> when he
finds himself thus closely pursued and
beset with Interrogatories? That we
may not therefore seem too hard on an
innocent Man, who probably meant
nothing, but was betray'd by following
another into Difficulties and Straits that
he was not aware of, I shall propose
one single Expedient, by which his
Disciples (whom it most concerns) may
soon satisfy themselves, whether this
Vindicator really understands what he
takes upon him to vindicate. It is in
short, that they would ask him to ex∣plain
the second, third or fourth Fluxi∣ons
upon his Principles. Be this the
Touchstone of his Vindication. If he
can do it, I shall own my self much
mistaken: If he cannot, it will be evi∣dent
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
that he was much mistaken in
himself, when he presumed to defend
Fluxions without so much as knowing
what they are. So having put the Me∣rits
of the Cause on this Issue, I leave
him to be tried by his Scholars."</P>
<P N="3">III. In this CATECHISM I am first
to be: asked, "Whether I can conceive
Velocity without Motion, or Motion
without Extension, or Extension with∣out
Magnitude?" These Questions are
more clearly express'd in the 29th and
30th Queries of his <HI>Analyst,</HI> where he asks,
"Whether we can form an Idea or Notion
of Velocity distinct from and exclusive
of its Measures? Whether Motion can
be conceived in a Point of Space? And
if Motion cannot, whether Velocity
can? And if not, whether a first or last
Velocity can be conceived in a mere Li∣mit,
either initial or final, of the describ∣ed
Space?" I answer, I can conceive
Velocity and Motion in a <HI>Point of Space</HI>;
that is without any assignable Length or
Extension described by it, and so might
he too if he had understood and consider'd
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
the Nature of Motion. For Moti∣on
is an Effect of some Cause acting on
the Thing moved; which Effect setting
aside all Resistance, will ever be propor∣tional
to the whole Action of the gene∣rating
Cause: And therefore if a Cause
acts continually upon a given Thing with∣out
any Interruption, there must be a con∣tinual
Increase of its Velocity. The Ve∣locity
cannot be the same in any two
different Points of the Space described,
however near those Points may be to
each other. For if it was, there must: be
a Cessation of the Action of the moving
Cause during the Passage of the Thing
thro' the Space comprehended between
the two Points; which is contrary to
the Supposition.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
If the Thing moved be a Point, and
the Space described by this Point setting
out from a State of Rest at A, be AD;
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
and if the Point be acted upon con∣tinually
by a moving Cause during
the Time of its going from A to D,
and the Cause act continually with
the same Degree of Strength during
that Time; the Velocity will con∣tinually
increase with the Time of
the Motion, or with the Square
Root of the Space described; that
is, the Velocities in the Points C
and D, will be in the same Proportion
as the Times of describing AC and AD,
or as the Square Roots of AC and AD.
These are the Laws of Motion observed
by Bodies falling from small Heights to
the Surface of the Earth, setting aside
the Resistance of the Air, and supposing
the Bodies to have exactly the same
Weights during the Times of their Fall.</P>
<P>If the Cause acts continually upon the
moving Point, but with different Degrees
of Strength during the Time of the Mo∣tion;
the Velocity will not increase with
the Time, nor with the Square Root of the
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Space described; but will still increase
from the Beginning to the End of the
Motion, and not be the same in any two
different Points of the Space described,
however near to each other. Let the
Velocity increase with the <HI>n</HI> Power of
the Time, that is, let V be as T<SUP><HI>n</HI></SUP>; and
then V will be as <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or as
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, putting S for the Space describ'd:
Whence it appears that the Velocity will
not be the same in any two different
Points of the Space described: For it must
vary upon the least Change of the Space
S, and consequently be different in every
different Point of AD; which shews that
this Author has been greatly mistaken in
imagining that there can be no Motion,
no Velocity, in a Point of Space.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The next Questions in the CA∣TECHISM,
depending upon each other,
run thus. "Let him be asked, whether
nothing be not the Product of nothing
multiply'd by something? And if so,
when the Difference between the Gno∣mon
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
and Sum of the two Rectangles
vanisheth, whether the Rectangles
themselves do not also vanish? that is
when <HI>a b</HI> is nothing, whether A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI>
be not also nothing? that is, whether
the Momentum of AB be not nothing?
And let him be asked what his Mo∣mentums
are good for when thus they
are reduced to nothing?" As to the
first of these Questions I agree with him
that nothing is the Product of nothing
multiply'd by something; but must know
what he means by the vanishing of
the Gnomon and Sum of the two
Rectangles in the second, before I give
him a direct Answer. If by vanishing he
means that they vanish and become no∣thing
as Areas, I grant they do; but ab∣solutely
deny, upon such an Evanescence
of the Gnomon and Sum of the two Rect∣angles
by the moving back of the Sides
of the Gnomon till they come to coin∣cide
with those of the Rectangle, that
nothing remains. For there still remain
the moving Sides, which are now become
the Sides of the Rectangle; into which
Sides both the Gnomon and the Sum of
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
the two Rectangles are now turned by
this retroverted Motion. And as the Gno∣mon
and Sum of the two Rectangles, up∣on
the Evanescence of their Areas by
this retroverted Motion, are both con∣verted
into the two Sides of the Rect∣angle
AB, so in the Instant of that Con∣version,
their Motions are exactly the
same; or the Motion of the Gnomon is
the same with the Sum of the Motions of
the two Rectangles, when they evanesce,
and are converted into the two Sides of
the Rectangle AB.</P>
<P>If a Point moves forward to generate
a Line, and afterwards the same Point
moves back again to destroy the Line
with the very same Degrees of Velocity,
in all Parts of the Line which it had in
those Parts when moving forward to ge∣nerate
it; in the Instant the Line vanishes
as a Length, nothing of a Line will re∣main;
but still the generating Point will
remain, together with the Velocity it had
at the very Beginning of its Motion. And
the Case is the very same with respect to
a Rectangle increasing by the Motion of
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
its Sides: For upon the Evanescence of
a generated Gnomon, there still remain
the Sides of the Rectangle into which the
Gnomon by its Evanescence is converted,
together with the Velocities of those
Sides that is, when the Gnomon eva∣nesces
there still remains A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>To make this more evident to Sense;
let the Point which generated the Line
AD, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> move back again from D to C with the very same Degrees of Ve∣locity
in every Part of the Incre∣ment
CD which it had in that part
in moving forward from C to D;
and when the Increment CD eva∣nesces
and becomes nothing as a Line
by being converted into the moving
Point in C; there will remain that
that Point together with its Motion in C;
for neither the Point nor its Motion in
C is destroy'd by the Evanescence of the
Line CD.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>
If the Rectangle CDK be generated
by the Motions of two indefinite right
Lines IB and IA, of IB down IA and
of IA along IB, and from a Continuance
of the Motions of these Lines, be in∣creased
by the Gnomon CGK; and if
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the generating Lines return from L and E
to K and C, with the very same Degrees
of Velocity in the several Points of LK
and EC which they had in those Points
in moving from K and C to L and E; it
is evident, when the Gnomon CGK or
the Increment of the Rectangle CDK
evanesces and becomes nothing as an Area,
by being converted into the Sides DK
and DC; that there will remain those
Sides and their Velocities in D; neither
the Sides nor the Velocities of those
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
Sides being destroy'd by the Evanescence
of the Area of the Gnomon. But per∣haps
he will say, that when the Gnomon
evanesces it turns into something more
than the Sum of the Sides DK and DC:
For the Rectangles LD and FC turn into
those Sides, and the Rectangle FH turns
into a Point at D; and therefore the Mo∣tion
of the Gnomon in the Instant it eva∣nesces,
will become the Sum of the Mo∣tions
of the Sides DK and DC, and of
the Point in D; that is, putting A and
B for DK and DC, and <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for the
Velocities in D towards F and H, and <HI>p</HI>
for a Point; it will be equal to A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI>
+ <HI>ap</HI> + <HI>bp</HI>: Let it be so, and yet <HI>a</HI>+<HI>b</HI> × <HI>p</HI>
will be nothing when compared with A<HI>b</HI>
+ B<HI>a,</HI> nor make the least Augmentation
to that Sum when added to it. For let
<HI>a</HI> be to <HI>b</HI> as 3 to 2, and A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <HI>ap</HI>
+ <HI>bp</HI> will be 2A + 3B + 5<HI>p</HI>: But 5<HI>p</HI> or
five Points added to a Line, make no∣thing
but the Line itself; a Point being
no Part of a Line; and consequently not
in the least increasing its Length when
added to it: And therefore the Motion
of the Gnomon when it evanesces and
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
turns into the Sides of the Rectangle
CDK, will be A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a,</HI> as Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton</HI> makes it.</P>
<P>If the Curvilineal Area ABD be gene∣rated
by the Motion of any indefinite
Line AH down AG, While a Point set∣ting
out from A moves in the Line AH
from A towards H; and if from a Con∣tinuance
of these two Motions that Area
be increased by the Augment BDFE,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
consisting of the Rectangle BC and of
the Triangle CFD; the Motion with
which the Increment BDFE begins to
be generated, is the Sum of the two Mo∣tions
towards C and H in the Point D;
which Sum, putting <HI>b</HI> for the Velocity
towards C, <HI>a</HI> for the Velocity towards H
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
and <HI>p</HI> for a Point, will be BD×<HI>b</HI> + <HI>ap.</HI>
Now suppose the Ordinate EF to move
back to BD, and the Point F to move back
in the Line HE to C, and that in moving
back they have the same Degrees of Ve∣locity
in every Point of EB and EH,
which they had before in moving for∣ward;
it is manifest, that when the Aug∣ment
BDFE vanishes and becomes no∣thing
as an Area, by being converted into
the Ordinate BD, and into a Point at the
Extremity of that Ordinate; there will
remain BD and the Point in D, together
with their Velocities in that Point; for
the Motions of that Line and Point, are
not destroy'd by the Evanescence of the
Area BDFE, In the Instant EF coin∣cides
with BD, and the Point F with D,
the Area BDFE will be converted into
BD + <HI>p,</HI> and its Motion will become BD ×
<HI>b</HI> + <HI>pa,</HI> as before. But <HI>pa,</HI> being only so
many Points as <HI>a</HI> contains Units, is real∣ly
and truly nothing with respect to
BD × <HI>b</HI>; and consequently does not at all
increase it when added to it. And there∣fore
the <HI>Fluxion</HI> of the curvilineal Area
ABD, will be BD × <HI>b</HI>; or as BD if <HI>b</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
be given, or the Line AH move down
AG with a Velocity which is exactly
the same in every Part of GA.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that if mathematical
Quantities be increased in equal Times
by Motion, their isochronal Increments
must be made to vanish by a Retroversion
of the Motion, before we can obtain the
Motions with which they vanish, or begin
to be generated; that is, before we can
obtain the <HI>Fluxions</HI> of the Quantities,
the Name given by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
to those Motions. So then, this Author
has been much out in supposing that upon
the Evanescence of the Gnomon CGK,
or of the curvilineal Figure BDFE, the
Momentum or <HI>Fluxion</HI> of the Rectangle
CDK, or of the Area ABD, vanishes.
Consequently, he has been greatly mista∣ken
in every one of these Questions.</P>
<P N="5">V. But he goes on. "I wish he were
asked to explain the Difference between
a Magnitude infinitely small and a Mag∣nitude
infinitely diminished. If he
saith there is no Difference: Then let
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
him, be further asked, how he DARES
to explain the Method of Fluxions by
the <HI>Ratio</HI> of Magnitudes infinitely di∣minish'd,
when Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> hath
expresly excluded all Consideration of
Quantities infinitely small? If this able
Vindicator shou'd say that Quantities
infinitely diminish'd are nothing at all,
and consequently that, according to
him, the first and last <HI>Ratios</HI> are Pro∣portions
between nothings, let him be
desired to make Sense of this, or ex∣plain
what he means by <HI>Proportion
between nothings.</HI> If he shou'd say
the ultimate Proportions are the <HI>Ratios</HI>
of mere Limits, then let him be asked
how the Limits of Lines can be pro∣portioned
or divided?"</P>
<P>As all this Part of the CATECHISM
relates to the Measures of Fluxions by
the first and last <HI>Ratios</HI> of isochronal
Increments generated and destroy'd by
Motion, so I have taken it together, and
shall answer the whole in one Section.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20"/>
Neither Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> nor I have
said, that <HI>Fluxions</HI> are measured by the
Proportions of Magnitudes infinitely
small, nor by the Proportions of any
Magnitudes whatever generated in equal
Times; but that <HI>they are measured by
the first or last Proportions of isochro∣nal
Increments generated or destroy'd
by Motion</HI>; which Proportions are the
<HI>Ratios</HI> with which such Increments be∣gin
to exist before they have acquired
any Magnitude, or with which they
cease to exist and vanish after they have
lost all Magnitude. These <HI>Ratios</HI> sub∣sist
when the isochronal Increments have
no Magnitude, for as much as the Moti∣ons
subsist with which those Increments,
<HI>just now, in this very Instant,</HI> begin
or cease to exist; to which Motions
these <HI>Ratios</HI> are proportional.</P>
<P>For Example, the first or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of the
Increments CD and EF generated in equal
Times, has a real Existence; for as much
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
as it is equal to the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Motions
in C and E, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> 
which are the Mo∣tions
subsisting in those Points
when the ischronal Increments
<HI>just</HI> begin or cease to exist.
The Existence of the Motions
preserves the Existence of <HI>these
Ratios</HI> of the Increments CD
and EF. If the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the
Motions in C and E, be that of
4 to 3; the first or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of
the isochronal Increments CD
and EF, will likewise be that of
4 to 3, even tho' no Part of those Incre∣ments
has any Existence.</P>
<P>The Motions in C and E, are as the
moving Quantities and Velocities taken
together; or as two Points and their Ve∣locities,
taken together; or as the Veloci∣ties,
all Points being equal. And the first
or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of the isochronal Incre∣ments
CD and EF, is compounded of
the first or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of these Spaces,
and of the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the moving Quanti∣ties.
For the Velocities in C and E be∣ing
in the first or last <HI>Ratios</HI> of these
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
isochronal Spaces, the Motions, which are
as the moving Quantities and Velocities
taken together, will be as the same
moving Quantities and the first or
last <HI>Ratio</HI> of the isochronal Spaces
taken together. If Q and <HI>q</HI> denote the
moving Quantities in C and E, V and <HI>v</HI>
their Velocities, S and <HI>s</HI> the isochronal
Spaces CD and EF, and Ṡ and <HI>ṡ</HI> the first
or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of those isochronal Spaces;
then QV will be to <HI>qv,</HI> as QṠ to <HI>qṡ</HI>;
and in this case V will be to <HI>v,</HI> as Ṡ to <HI>ṡ,</HI>
because Q and <HI>q</HI> are equal.</P>
<P>Again, the first or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of the
isochronal Spaces FD and DH in the
augmented Rectangle EGL (See the <HI>Fi∣gure</HI>
in <HI>Page</HI> 14.) has a real Existence;
for as much as it is equal to the <HI>Ratio</HI> of
the two Motions of two Points in D, of
one towards F, and the other towards H;
which Motions, subsisting when the iso∣chronal
Spaces FD and DH are nothing,
preserve the Existence of the first or last
<HI>Ratio</HI> of these Spaces, or keep it from
being a <HI>Ratio of nothings.</HI> If V and <HI>v,</HI>
denote the Velocities in D towards F
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
and H, Q and <HI>q</HI> the Sides of the Rect∣angle
DK and DC, and Ṡ and <HI>ṡ</HI> the first
or last <HI>Ratio</HI> of the isochronal Spaces
FD and DH; then Q <HI>v</HI> will be to <HI>q</HI>V,
as Q<HI>ṡ</HI> to <HI>q</HI>Ṡ; but Q<HI>v</HI> + <HI>q</HI>V is the Fluxi∣on
or Motion of the Rectangle CDK,
as I have shewn before; and therefore the
Moment or Measure of the Fluxion of the
Rectangle will be Q<HI>ṡ</HI> + <HI>q</HI>Ṡ. This is
a full and clear Answer to this Part of
the CATECHISM, and shews that its
Author has been greatly mistaken in sup∣posing
that I explained the Doctrine of
Fluxions by the <HI>Ratio of Magnitudes
infinitely deminish'd,</HI> or by <HI>Proportions
between nothings.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. I come now to the last Part of
the CATECHISM, which stands thus.
"I shall propose one single Expedient,
by which his Disciples (whom it most
concerns) may soon satisfy themselves,
whether this Vindicator really under∣stands
what he takes upon him to vindi∣cate.
It is in short, that they wou'd ask
him to explain the second, third, or fourth
Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
the Touchstone of his Vindication:
If he can do it, I shall own my self
much mistaken: If he cannot it will
be evident that he was much mistaken
in himself, when he <HI>presumed</HI> to de∣send
Fluxions without so much as
knowing what they are. So having
put the Merits of the Cause on this
Issue, I leave him to be tried by his
Scholars."</P>
<P>I do not wonder that this Author shou'd
have no clear Ideas or Conceptions of
second, third or fourth Fluxions, when
he has no clear Conceptions of the com∣mon
Principles of Motion, nor of the first
and last <HI>Ratios</HI> of the isochronal Increments
of Quantities generated and destroy'd
by Motion. For Fluxions, according to Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> are the <HI>Motions</HI> with which
the isochronal Increments of Quantities be∣gin
or cease to exist, or the Motions of the
generating Quantities in the very Limits
or Extremities of the <HI>Fluents</HI>: Thus
the Fluxions of Solids are the Motions of
Surfaces; the Fluxions of Surfaces, the
Motions of Lines; the Fluxions of Lines,
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
the Motions of Points; and the Fluxions
of Points are nothing, for Points in their
own Nature are invariable, and therefore
incapable of being generated or increased
by Motion: And if the first Fluxions of
Quantities be Motions, it follows, that
the Mutations of these Motions and the
Mutations of those Mutations, which
are the second and third Fluxions of the
Quantities, must likewise be Motions.</P>
<P>First, second and third Fluxions do real∣ly
exist, and may be clearly and distinct∣ly
conceiv'd by attending to the Motions
of the several Parts of a Cube, namely,
of its Surfaces of their Lines and Points,
in the Instant it begins to be increas'd by
Motion. For if A denotes the Side of a Cube
generated by an uniform Motion, whose
Velocity is express'd by <HI>a</HI>; the first Fluxion
of the Cube, according to these Principles,
will be expressed by 3<HI>a</HI>A<SUP>2</SUP>; its second
Fluxion, which is the Fluxion of 3<HI>a</HI>A<SUP>2</SUP>, will
be expressed by 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP>A, or by 6<HI>a</HI>A × <HI>a</HI>;
its third Fluxion, which is the first Fluxi∣on
on of 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP>A, will be express'd by 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>3</SUP> or
by 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP> × <HI>a</HI>; and its fourth Fluxion will
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
be nothing: But all these Fluxions or Mo∣tions
do exist, and may be clearly and
distinctly conceived in the Motion of a
Cube, at the very End of its Generation,
or at the very Beginning of its Augmen∣tation,
by Motion; for it begins to be
augmented by the Sum of the Motions
of three of its Squares comprehending
any one of its solid Angles, each of which
Squares being denoted by A<SUP>2</SUP> and their
Velocity outward by <HI>a,</HI> the Fluxion of
the Cube or the Motion with which it
begins to increase or to be enlarged, will
be 3<HI>a</HI>A<SUP>2</SUP>; and this is the first Fluxion
of the Cube; and the three moving
Squares begin to be augmented, in the
very same Instant wherein the Cube be∣gins
to enlarge, each by the Sum of the
Motions of its two adjoining Sides, and
consequently the Motions of those Sides
to augment the cubic Surface, will be
express'd by 6<HI>a</HI>A, but that Surface at
the same Instant of Time moves outward
to augment the Solid with a Velocity
which is also denoted by <HI>a,</HI> and there∣fore
the whole Motion of the fix moving
Sides of the three Squares for increasing
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
or enlarging the Cube, will be expressed
by 6<HI>a</HI>A × <HI>a</HI> or by 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP>A; and this is the
second Fluxion of the Cube; and when
the three moving Squares begin thus to
increase, sideways and outwards, for the
Enlargement of the Cube, their six mo∣ving
Sides begin to be augmented by the
Motion of six Points; and the common
Velocity of those Points in order to in∣crease
the Sides of the Squares, being the
same with the Velocity of those Sides to
increase the Cubic Surface, and with the
Velocity of that Surface to augment the
Solid; the whole Motion with which
those Points begin to enlarge the Cube,
will be express'd by 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>3</SUP> or by 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>3</SUP><HI>p</HI>; and
this is the third Fluxion of the Cube:
These three Kinds of Motion do all ne∣cessarily
exist and may be clearly and
distinctly conceived in the System of
Motion whereby a Cube begins to be
augmented: And therefore the first, se∣cond
and third Fluxions of Quantities
may be distinctly conceived, and fully ex∣plained
upon the Principles of Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28"/>
As first, second and third Fluxions are
explained by the several Motions neces∣sarily
existing in the very Instant a Cube
begins to be augmented, so they may like∣wise
be explain'd and distinctly compre∣hended,
by considering the nascent or
evanescent Increments of the several Parts
of a Cube, generated by Motion; pro∣vided
always that by nascent or evane∣scent
Increments be understood not gene∣rated
Increments of any Magnitude what∣ever,
but only such Quantities or Mag∣nitudes
as are proportional to and Conse∣quently
Measures of the Motions with
which those isochronal Increments begin
or cease to exist. For if <HI>a,</HI> which before
denoted Velocity, be now put for the
first or last Ratio of the Space described
by that Velocity in a given Time; 3<HI>a</HI>A<SUP>2</SUP>
will denote the nascent Increment of the
Cube generated by the Motion of three
of its Squares comprehending any one of
its solid Angles; and 6<HI>a</HI>A will express the
Sum of the nascent Increments of the
three moving Squares, which Sum mul∣tiply'd
into <HI>a</HI> will be the Increment of
the nascent Solid 3<HI>a</HI>A<SUP>2</SUP>; consequently
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP>A will be the second nascent Incre∣ment
of the Cube; and the nascent In∣crement
of 6A<HI>a,</HI> or of six Rectangles
each denoted by A<HI>a,</HI> will be 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP>, which
multiply'd into <HI>a</HI> gives 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>3</SUP> for the nascent
Increment of 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP>A, and therefore 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>3</SUP> is
the third nascent Increment of the Cube:
All this may be clearly conceiv'd and
made evident to Sense by the <HI>Figure</HI>
in <HI>Page</HI> 14. For let CDK represent one
of the three moving Squares compre∣hending
any of the solid Angles of a
Cube increasing by Motion, and then
three times CDK multiply'd into <HI>a,</HI> or
3<HI>a</HI>A<SUP>2</SUP>, will expound the first nascent In∣crement
of the Cube; and 3FC + 3LD
or 6A<HI>a</HI> (which is the nascent Increment
of the three moving Squares) multiply'd
into <HI>a,</HI> will be the second nascent Incre∣ment
of the Cube; and, the Rectangle
FH or <HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP> being the nascent Increment of
the Rectangle FC or LD, and 2FH or
2<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP> the nascent Increment of FC + LD
or of 2A<HI>a,</HI> and 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP> the nascent Incre∣ment
of 6A<HI>a,</HI> it follows that 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP> multi∣ply'd
into <HI>a,</HI> or that 6<HI>a</HI><SUP>3</SUP>, will be the nascent
Increment of 6A<HI>a</HI><SUP>2</SUP> and consequently
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
the third nascent Increment of the Cube.
And these three distinct Orders of Incre∣ments,
all begin to exist together, in the
very Instant the Cube begins to be aug∣mented
by Motion.</P>
<P>This may serve as an Answer to the
last Part of the CATECHISM, concern∣ing
the Author's <HI>Touchstone</HI> of my <HI>Vin∣dication</HI>:
Whether he will <HI>own himself
mistaken</HI> I know not; but I think he
ought after his unjust and shameful Treat∣ment
of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>; who in <HI>the
Introduction to his Quadrature of
Curves,</HI> in <HI>the second Lemma of the
second Book, and in the Scholium to the
first Section of the first Book of his
Principles of Philosophy,</HI> has deliver'd
his Doctrine of <HI>Fluxions</HI> in so clear and
distinct a Manner, without the least <HI>In∣consistency</HI>
in Terms or Arguments, that
one wou'd have thought it impossible for
any Person not to have understood him,
particularly for this Author, who says, <HI>he
had long and maturely considered those
Principles, and taken as much pains as</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="31"/> <HI>any Man living to understand and make
Sense of them.</HI></P>
<P>I have now done with the CATECHISM;
but beg leave before I conclude this Pa∣per,
in order to prevent my being CATE∣CHISED
any more by this Author, to give
the World a short Account of some Part
of my Faith in Religion. I believe that
there is one supreme, incorporeal, ever∣living,
intelligent and omnipresent Being,
called GOD, who made and governs the
World. I believe that GOD is endued
with infinite Power, Knowledge, Wis∣dom
and Goodness; and that to <HI>deny</HI> or
<HI>limit</HI> any one of these Attributes, is in
Effect to <HI>deny</HI> a GOD. I believe, that
to say GOD <HI>cannot</HI> create Spirits with a
Power, inherent in themselves and result∣ing
from their own Frame and Make,
of perceiving and knowing. Things of a
quite different Nature from their own,
by Ideas and Sensations; is in Effect to
<HI>deny</HI> a GOD; for as much as by this
Principle his Almighty Power is denied.
And lastly, I believe that this Supreme
Being has revealed his Will to Mankind
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
by <HI>Moses,</HI> the Prophets, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>
and the Apostles; and that the Doctrine
by them deliver'd is therefore divine,
and cannot be altered by any Power or
Authority upon Earth, nor even by an
Angel from Heaven, who is pronounced
accursed shou'd he preach any other <HI>Gos∣pel</HI>
than what is delivered.</P>
