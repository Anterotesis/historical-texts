<HEAD>PREFACE,
To all that are concerned in the
EDUCATION of CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is an awful and important
Charge that is committed
to you. The Wisdom and
Welfare of the succeeding Generation
are intrusted with you beforehand, and
depend much on your Conduct. The
Seeds of Misery or Happiness in this
World, and that to come are often∣times
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
sown very early; and therefore
whatever may conduce to give the
Minds of Children a Relish for Vir∣tue
and Religion, ought, in the first
Place, to be proposed to you.</P>
<P>VERSE was at first designed for the
Service of GOD, though it hath been
wretchedly abused since. The Ancients,
among the Jews and the Heathens,
taught their Children and Disciples the
Precepts of Morality and Worship in
Verse. The Children of Israel were
commanded to learn the Words of the
Song of Moses, <HI>Deut. xxxi.</HI> 19, 30. and
we are directed in the New Testament,
not only to sing <HI>with Grace in the Heart,</HI>
but to <HI>teach, and admonish one another
by Hymns and Songs,</HI> Ephes. v. 19. And
there are these four Advantages in it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
I. THERE is a great Delight in the
very learning of Truths and Duties this
Way. There is something so amusing
and entertaining in Rhymes and Metre,
that will incline Children to make this
Part of their Business a Diversion. And
you may turn their very Duty into a
Reward, by giving them the Privilege
of learning one of these SONGS every
Week, if they fulfil the Business of
the Week well, and promising them
the Book itself, when they have learnt
ten or twenty Songs out of it.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT is learnt in Verse, is
longer retained in Memory, and sooner
recollected. The like Sounds, and the
like Number of Syllables, exceedingly
assist the Remembrance. And it may
often happen, that the End of a Song
running in the Mind, may be an ef∣fectual
means to keep off some Tempta∣tions,
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
or to incline to some Duty, when
a Word of Scripture is not upon their
Thoughts.</P>
<P N="3">III. THIS will be a constant Furni∣ture
for the Minds of Children, that
they may have something to think
upon when alone, and sing over to
themselves. This may sometimes give
their Thoughts a divine Turn, and
raise a young Meditation. Thus they
will not be forced to seek Relief for an
Emptiness of Mind, out of the loose
and dangerous Sonnets of the Age.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THESE <HI>Divine Songs</HI> may be a
pleasant and proper Matter for their
Daily or Weekly Worship, to sing one
in the Family, at such Time as the
Parents or Governors shall appoint;
and therefore I have confined the Verse
to the most usual Psalm Tunes.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
THE greatest part of this little Book
was composed several Years ago, at the
Request of a Friend, who has been
long engaged in the Work of Cate∣chising
a very great Number of Chil∣dren
of all kinds, and with abundant
Skill and Success. So that you will
find here nothing that savours of a
Party: The Children of high and low
Degree, of the Church of England, or
Dissenters, baptised in Infancy, or not,
may all join together in these Songs.
And as I have endeavoured to sink the
Language to the Level of a Child's Un∣derstanding,
and yet to keep it, if pos∣sible,
above Contempt; so I have de∣signed
to profit all, if possible, and of∣fend
none. I hope the more general
the Sense is, these Composures may be
of the more universal Use and Service.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8"/>
I HAVE added at the End, some
Attempts of SONNETS on MORAL
SUBJECTS, for Children, with an Air
of Pleasantry, to provoke some fitter
Pen to write a little Book of them.</P>
<P>MAY the Almighty GOD make you
faithful in this important Work of Edu∣cation;
may he succeed your Cares
with his abundant Grace, that the
rising Generation of Great Britain may
be a Glory among the Nations, a Pat∣tern
to the Christian World, and a
Blessing to the Earth.</P>

<L>HOW glorious is our heav'nly King,</L>

<L>How shall a Child presume to sing</L>
<L>His dreadful Majesty?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>How great his Pow'r is, none can tell,</L>

<L>Not Men below, nor Saints that dwell</L>
<L>On high before his Face.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Not Angels that stand round the LORD,</L>
<L>Can search his secret Will;</L>
<L>But they perform his heav'nly Word,</L>
<L>And sing his Praises still.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Then let me join this holy Train,</L>
<L>And my first Off'rings bring;</L>
<L>Th' eternal GOD will not disdain</L>
<L>To hear an Infant sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>My Heart resolves, my Tongue obeys,</L>
<L>And Angels shall rejoice,</L>
<L>To hear their mighty Maker's Praise</L>
<L>Sound from a feeble Voice.</L>

<L>The Moon shines full at his Command,</L>
<L>And all the Stars obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>I sing the Goodness of the LORD,</L>
<L>That fill'd the Earth with Food;</L>
<L>He form'd the Creatures with his Word,</L>
<L>And then pronounc'd them Good.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>LORD, how thy Wonders are display'd,</L>
<L>Where'er I turn mine Eye!</L>
<L>If I survey the Ground I tread,</L>
<L>Or gaze upon the Sky!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>There's not a Plant or Flow'r below,</L>
<L>But makes thy Glories known;</L>
<L>And Clouds arise and Tempests blow,</L>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Creatures (as num'rous as they be)▪</L>

<L>In Heav'n he shines with Beams of Love,</L>

<L>'Tis on his Earth I stand or move,</L>
<L>And 'tis his Air I breathe.</L>
</LG>

<L>That join'd in Counsel to restore,</L>
<L>And save our ruin'd Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Our Father ate forbidden Fruit,</L>

<L>To make our Peace with GOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>

<L>Which we have disobey'd;</L>
<L>He bore our Sins upon the Cross,</L>
<L>And our full Ransom paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">

Genius would undertake for the Use of
Children, and perform much better.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sense and Subjects might be bor∣rowed
plentifully from the <HI>Proverbs
of Solomon,</HI> from all the common Appear∣ances
of Nature, from all the Occurrences
in Civil Life, both in City and Coun∣try:
(Which would also afford Matter for
other divine Songs.) Here the Language
and Measures should be easy and flowing
with Cheerfulness, with or without the So∣lemnities
of Religion, or the sacred Names
of GOD and Holy Things; that Children
might find Delight and Profit together.</P>
<P>This would be one effectual Way to de∣liver
them from the Temptation of loving
or learning those idle, wanton, or profane
Songs, which give so early an ill Taint to
the Fancy and Memory; and become the
Seeds of future Vices.</P>
