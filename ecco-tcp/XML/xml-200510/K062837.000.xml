an Honour to have re∣ceived,

any Favours done

me as I Travell'd thro'

some Account: For

they who have been

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is certainly no
Place in the World where
a Man may Travel with
greater Pleasure and Ad∣vantage
than in <HI>Italy.</HI>
One finds something more particu∣lar
in the Face of the Country, and
more astonishing in the Works of
Nature, than can be met with in
any other Part of <HI>Europe.</HI> It is
the great School of Musick and
Painting, and contains in it all the
noblest Productions of Statuary and
Architecture both Ancient and Mo∣dern.
It abounds with Cabinets of
Curiosities, and vast Collections of
all Kinds of Antiquities. No o∣ther
Country in the World has such
a Variety of Governments, that
are so different in their Constitu∣tions,
and so refined in their Po∣liticks.
<PB REF="9"/>
There is scarce any Part
of the Nation that is not Famous
in History, nor so much as a Moun∣tain
or River that has not been the
Scene of some extraordinary Action.</P>
<P>As there are few Men that have
Talents or Opportunities for exa∣mining
so copious a Subject, one
may observe among those who have
written on <HI>Italy,</HI> that different Au∣thors
have succeeded best on diffe∣rent
sorts of Curiosities. Some have
been more particular in their Ac∣counts
of Pictures, Statues and
Buildings; some have search'd in∣to
Libraries, Cabinets of Rarities,
and Collections of Medals, as others
have been wholly taken up with In∣scriptions,
Ruins and Antiquities.
Among the Authors of our own Coun∣try,
we are obliged to the Bishop of
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> for his masterly and uncom∣mon
Observations on the Religion and
Governments of <HI>Italy</HI>: <HI>Lassels</HI> may
be useful in giving us the Names of
such Writers as have treated of the
several States through which he
<PB REF="10"/>
pass'd: Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> is to be valu'd for
his Observations on the Natural
Productions of the Place. Monsieur
<HI>Mission</HI> has wrote a more correct
Account of <HI>Italy</HI> in general than
any before him, as he particularly
Excels in the Plan of the Country,
which he has given us in true and
lively Colours.</P>
<P>There are still several of these
Topicks that are far from being
exhausted, as there are many new
Subjects that a Traveller may find
to employ himself upon. For my
own part, as I have taken Notice of
several Places and Antiquities that
no Body else has spoken of, so, I
think, I have mentioned but few
Things in common with others, that
are notei ther set in a new Light,
or accompany'd with different Re∣flections.
I have taken care parti∣cularly
to consider the several Pas∣sages
of the Ancient Poets, which
have any Relation to the Places
or Curiosities that I met with: For
before I entered on my Voyage I took
<PB REF="11"/>
care to refresh my Memory among
the <HI>Classic</HI> Authors, and to make
such Collections out of them as I
might afterwards have Occasion
for. I must confess it was not one
of the least Entertainments that I
met with in Travelling, to examine
these several Descriptions, as it
were, upon the Spot, and to compare
the Natural Face of the Country
with the Landskips that the Poets
have given us of it. However,
to avoid the Confusion that might
arise from a Multitude of Quotati∣ons,
I have only cited such Verses
as have given us some Image of the
Place, or that have something else
besides the bare Name of it to re∣commend
them.</P>

admire,</L>
<L>And from <HI>Britannia</HI>'s publick Posts

<L>Nor longer, her ungrateful Sons to please,</L>
<L>For their Advantage sacrifice your Ease;</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="13"/>
Me into Foreign Realms my Fate conveys,</L>
<L>Through Nations fruitful of Immortal Lays,</L>
<L>Where the soft Season and inviting Clime</L>
<L>Conspire to trouble your Repose with rhime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd Eyes,</L>
<L>Gay gilded Scenes and shining Prospects rise,</L>
<L>Poetick Fields encompass me around,</L>
<L>And still I seem to tread on Classic Ground:</L>
<L>For here the Muse so oft her Harp has strung,</L>
<L>That not a Mountain rears its Head unsung;</L>
<L>Renown'd in Verse each shady Thicket grows,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Stream in Heav'nly Numbers flows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How am I pleas'd to search the Hills and Woods</L>
<L>For rising Springs and celebrated Floods!</L>
<L>To view the <HI>Nar,</HI> tumultuous in his Course,</L>
<L>And trace the smooth <HI>Clitumnus</HI> to his Sourse,</L>
<L>To see the <HI>Mincio</HI> draw his watry Store</L>
<L>Through the long Windings of a fruitful Shore,</L>
<L>And hoary <HI>Albula</HI>'s infected Tide</L>
<L>O'er the warm Bed of smoaking Sulphur glide.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="iii" REF="14"/>
<L>Fir'd with a thousand Raptures I survey</L>
<L><HI>Eridanus</HI> through flow'ry Meadows stray,</L>
<L>The King of Floods! that rowling o'er the Plains</L>
<L>The tow'ring <HI>Alps</HI> of half their Moisture drains,</L>
<L>And, proudly swoln with a whole Winter's Snows,</L>
<L>Distributes Wealth and Plenty where he flows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes, misguided by the tuneful Throng,</L>
<L>I look for Streams immortaliz'd in Song,</L>
<L>That lost in Silence and Oblivion lye,</L>
<L>(Dumbare their Fountains and their Channels dry)</L>
<L>Yet run for ever by the Muses Skill,</L>
<L>And in the smooth Description murmur still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes to gentle <HI>Tiber</HI> I retire,</L>
<L>And the fam'd River's empty Shores admire,</L>
<L>That destitute of Strength derives its Course</L>
<L>From thrifty Urns and an unfruitful Sourse;</L>
<L>Yet, sung so often in Poetick Lays,</L>
<L>With Scorn the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Nile</HI> surveys.</L>
<L>So high the deathless Muse exalts her Theme!</L>
<L>Such was the <HI>Boin,</HI> a poor inglorious Stream,</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="15"/>
That in <HI>Hibernian</HI> Vales obscurely stray'd,</L>
<L>And unobserv'd in wild <HI>Meanders</HI> play'd;</L>
<L>Till by <HI>Your</HI> Lines and <HI>Nassau</HI>'s Sword renown'd,</L>
<L>Its rising Billows through the World refound,</L>
<L>Where-e'er the Heroe's Godlike Acts can pierce,</L>
<L>Or where the Fame of an Immortal Verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh could the Muse my ravish'd Breast inspire</L>
<L>With Warmth like yours, and raise an equal Fire,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd Beauties in my Verse shou'd shine,</L>
<L>And <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Italy</HI> shou'd yield to mine!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See how the Golden Groves around me smile,</L>
<L>That shun the Coast of <HI>Britain</HI>'s stormy Isle;</L>
<L>Or when transplanted and preserv'd with Care,</L>
<L>Curse the Cold Clime, and starve in Northern Air.</L>
<L>Here kindly Warmth their mounting Juice ferments</L>
<L>To nobler Tastes, and more exalted Scents.</L>
<L>Ev'n the rough Rocks with tender Myrtle bloom,</L>
<L>And trodden Weeds send out a rich Perfume.</L>
<L>Bear me some God to <HI>Baja</HI>'s gentle Seats,</L>
<L>Or cover me in <HI>Umbria</HI>'s Green Retreats;</L>
<L><PB N="v" REF="16"/>
Where Western Gales eternally reside,</L>

<L>Blossoms, and Fruits, and Flowers together rise,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Immortal Glories in my Mind revive,</L>
<L>And in my Soul a thousand Passions strive,</L>
<L>When <HI>Rome</HI>'s exalted Beauties I descry</L>
<L>Magnificent in Piles of Ruin lye:</L>
<L>An Amphitheater's amazing Height</L>
<L>Here fills my Eye with Terror and Delight,</L>
<L>That on its publick Shows unpeopled <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>And held uncrowded Nations in its Womb.</L>
<L>Here Pillars rough with Sculpture pierce the Skies,</L>
<L>And here the proud Triumphal Arches rise,</L>
<L>Where the old <HI>Romans</HI> deathless Acts display'd</L>
<L>Their base degenerate Progeny upbraid.</L>
<L>Whole Rivers here forsake the Fields below,</L>
<L>And wondring at their height through airy Chan∣nels
flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still to new Scenes my wandring Muse retires,</L>
<L>And the dumb show of breathing <HI>Rocks</HI> admires;</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="17"/>
Where the smooth Chissel all its Force has shown,</L>
<L>And soften'd into Flesh the rugged Stone.</L>

<L>Stern Tyrants, whom their Cruelties renown,</L>
<L>And Emperors in <HI>Parian</HI> Marble frown:</L>
<L>While the bright Dames, to whom they humbly su'd,</L>

<L>Fain wou'd I <HI>Raphael</HI>'s Godlike Art rehearse,</L>

<L>A new Creation rises to my Sight.</L>
<L>Such Heav'nly Figures from his Pencil flow,</L>
<L>So warm with Life his blended Colours glow.</L>
<L>From Theme to Theme with secret Pleasure tost,</L>
<L>Amidst the soft Variety I'm lost:</L>
<L>Here pleasing Airs my ravish'd Soul confound</L>
<L>With circling Notes and Labyrinths of Sound;</L>
<L>Here Domes and Temples rise in distant Views,</L>
<L>And opening Palaces invite my Muse.</L>

<L>How has kind Heav'n adorn'd the happy Land,</L>

<L>Her blooming Mountains and her sunny Shores,</L>
<L>With all the Gifts that Heav'n and Earth impart,</L>
<L>The Smiles of Nature, and the Charms of Art,</L>
<L>While proud Oppression in her Vallies reigns,</L>
<L>And Tyranny usurps her happy Plains?</L>
<L>The poor Inhabitant beholds in vain</L>
<L>The red'ning Orange and the swelling Grain:</L>
<L>Joyless he sees the growing Oils and Wines,</L>
<L>And in the Myrtle's fragrant Shade repines:</L>
<L>Starves in the midst of Nature's Bounty curst,</L>
<L>And in the loaden Vineyard dies for Thirst.</L>

<LG>
<L>Oh <HI>Liberty,</HI> thou <HI>Goddess</HI> Heav'nly bright,</L>
<L>Profuse of Bliss, and pregnant with Delight,</L>
<L>Eternal Pleasures in thy Presence reign,</L>
<L>And smiling Plenty leads thy wanton Train!</L>
<L>Eas'd of her Load, Subjection grows more light,</L>
<L>And Poverty looks chearful in thy Sight;</L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="19"/>
Thou mak'st the Gloomy face of Nature Gay,</L>
<L>Giv'st Beauty to the Sun, and Pleasure to the Day.</L>

<L>Thee, Goddess, Thee, <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Isle adores;</L>
<L>How has she oft exhausted all her Stores,</L>
<L>How oft in Fields of Death thy Presence sought?</L>
<L>Nor thinks the mighty Prize too dearly bought.</L>
<L>On Foreign Mountains may the Sun refine</L>
<L>The Grape's soft Juice, and mellow it to Wine,</L>
<L>With Citron Groves adorn a distant Soil,</L>
<L>And the fat Olive swell with Floods of Oil:</L>
<L>We envy not the warmer Clime that lies</L>
<L>In ten Degrees of more indulgent Skies,</L>
<L>Nor at the Coarseness of our Heav'n repine,</L>
<L>Tho' o'er our Heads the frozen <HI>Pleiads</HI> shine:</L>
<L>'Tis Liberty that Crowns <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Isle,</L>

A nicer Touch to the stretcht Canvas give,</L>

<L>And hold in Balance each contending State.</L>
<L>To threaten bold presumptuous Kings with War,</L>

<L>Soon as her Fleets appear, their Terrors cease,</L>
<L>And all the Northern World lies hush'd in Peace.</L>

<L>By Foreign Gold, or by Domestick Spite;</L>
<L>But strives in vain to Conquer or Divide,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Nassau</HI>'s Arms defend and Counsels guide.</L>

<LG>
<L>Fir'd with the Name, which I so oft have found</L>
<L>The distant Climes and different Tongues resound;</L>

<HEAD>MONACO,
GENOA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the Twelfth of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI>
1699, I set out from
<HI>Marseilles</HI> to <HI>Genoa</HI> in a
Tartane, and arrived late
at a small <HI>French</HI> Port call∣ed
<HI>Casses,</HI> where the next
Morning we were not a little surprized
to see the Mountains about the Town
covered with Green Olive-trees, or laid
out in beautiful Gardens, which gave
us a great Variety of pleasing Prospects,
even in the Depth of Winter. The
most uncultivated of them produce a∣bundance
of sweet Plants, as Wild-Time,
Lavender, Rosemary, Balme and Mirtle.
<PB N="2" REF="23"/>
We were here shown at a distance the
Desarts, which have been rendered so fa∣mous
by the Penance of <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI>
who, after her Arrival with <HI>Lazarus</HI> and
<HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> is said
to have wept away the rest of her Life
among these solitary Rocks and Moun∣tains.
It is so Romantic a Scene, that it
has always probably given occasion to
such Chimerical Relations; for it is per∣haps
of this Place that <HI>Claudian</HI> speaks,
in the following Description.<Q><L>Est locus extremum pandit qua Gallia littus</L>
<L>Oceani praetentus aquis, quà fertur Ulysses</L>
<L>Sanguine libato populum movisse Silentûm,</L>

<L>Thin airy Shapes, that o'er the Fur∣rows
rise,</L>
<L>(A dreadful Scene!) and skim before
his Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>I know there is nothing more unde∣termined
among the Learned than the
Voyage of <HI>Vlysses</HI>; some confining it to
the Mediterranean, others extending it
to the great Ocean, and others ascribing
it to a World of the Poet's own making;
tho' his Conversations with the Dead
are generally supposed to have been in
the <HI>Narbon Gaul.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Incultos adiit Laestrigonas Antiphatenque, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>

<L>On real Seas to real Shores he stray'd;</L>
<L>Or, by the Fable driv'n from Coast to

<P>The next Day we again set Sail, and
made the best of our way 'till we were
<PB N="4" REF="25"/>
forced, by contrary Winds, into St. <HI>Re∣mo,</HI>
a very pretty Town in the <HI>Genoese</HI>
Dominions. The Front to the Sea is not
large, but there are a great many Houses
behind it, built up the Side of the Moun∣tain,
to avoid the Winds and Vapours
that come from Sea. We here saw se∣veral
Persons, that in the midst of <HI>De∣cember</HI>
had nothing over their Shoulders
but their Shirts, without complaining of
the Cold. It is certainly very lucky for
the poorer sort, to be born in a Place that
is free from the greatest Inconvenience,
to which those of our Northern Nati∣ons
are subject; and indeed without this
natural Benefit of their Climates, the ex∣tream
Misery and Poverty that are in
most of the <HI>Italian</HI> Governments would
be insupportable. There are at St. <HI>Re∣mo</HI>
many Plantations of Palm-trees, that
do not grow in other Parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> We
failed from hence directly for <HI>Genoa,</HI> and
had a fair Wind that carried us into the
middle of the Gulf, which is very re∣markable
for Tempests and Scarcity of
Fish. It is probable one may be the
Cause of the other, whether it be that
the Fisher-men cannot employ their Art
with so much Success in so troubled a
Sea, or that the Fish do not care for in∣habiting
such stormy Waters.<Q><PB N="5" REF="26"/>

great Danger, that he fell upon his
Knees and confessed himself to a Capu∣chin
who was on Board with us. But
at last, taking the Advantage of a Side∣wind,
we were driven back in a few Hours
time as far as <HI>Monaco. Lucan</HI> has given
us a Description of the Harbour that we
found so very welcome to us, after the
great Danger we had escaped.<Q><L>Quaque sub Herculeo Sacratus nomine portus</L>

<P>There are but Three Towns in the

Men, paid and officer'd by the
<HI>French</HI> King. The Officer who showed
me the Palace told me, with a great deal of
Gravity, that his Master and the King
of <HI>France,</HI> amidst all the Confusions of
<PB N="7" REF="28"/>
<HI>Europe,</HI> had ever been good Friends and
Allies. The Palace has handsome Apart∣ments,
that are many of them hung with
Pictures of the reigning Beauties in the
Court of <HI>France.</HI> But the best of the
Furniture was at <HI>Rome,</HI> where the Prince
of <HI>Monaco</HI> resided at that time Ambassa∣dor.
We here took a little Boat to creep
along the Sea-shore as far as <HI>Genoa</HI>; but
at <HI>Savona,</HI> finding the Sea too rough,
we were forced to make the best of our
way by Land, over very rugged Moun∣tains
and Precipices: For this Road is
much more difficult than that over
Mount <HI>Cennis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Genoese</HI> are esteemed extremely
Cunning, Industrious, and inur'd to
Hardship above the rest of the <HI>Italians</HI>;
which was likewise the Character of the
old <HI>Ligurians.</HI> And indeed it is no won∣der,
while the Barrenness of their Coun∣try
continues, that the Manners of the
Inhabitants do not change: Since there is
nothing makes Men sharper, and sets
their Hands and Wits more at work than
Want. The <HI>Italian</HI> Proverb says of the
<HI>Genoese,</HI> that they have a Sea without
Fish, Land without Trees, and Men
without Faith. The Character the
<HI>Latin</HI> Poets have given of them is not
much different.<Q><PB N="8" REF="29"/><L>Assuetumque malo Ligurem</L><BIBL>Virg. G. 2.</BIBL>

<P>There are a great many beautiful Pa∣laces
standing along the Sea-shore on both
sides of <HI>Genoa,</HI> which make the Town ap∣pear
<PB N="9" REF="30"/>
much longer than it is, to those that
fail by it. The City it self makes the noblest
Show of any in the World. The Houses are
most of them painted on the Outside; so
that they look extreamly gay and lively,
besides that they are esteemed the highest
in <HI>Europe,</HI> and stand very thick together.
The New-Street is a double Range
of Palaces from one end to the other,
built with an excellent Fancy, and fit
for the greatest Princes to inhabit. I
cannot however be reconciled to their
manner of Painting several of the <HI>Genoese</HI>
Houses. Figures, Perspectives, or Pieces
of History are certainly very ornamental,
as they are drawn on many of the Walls,
that would otherwise look too naked and
uniform without them: But instead of
these, one often sees the Front of a Pa∣lace
covered with painted Pillars of diffe∣rent
Orders. If these were so many true
Columns of Marble, set in their proper
Architecture, they would certainly very
much adorn the Places where they stand,
but as they are now, they only shew us
that there is something wanting, and that
the Palace, which without these Coun∣terfeit
Pillars would be beautiful in its
kind, might have been more perfect by
the Addition of such as are real. The
Front of the <HI>Villa Imperiale,</HI> at a Mile
<PB N="10" REF="31"/>
distance from <HI>Genoa,</HI> without any thing
of this Paint upon it, consists of a <HI>Doric</HI>
and <HI>Corinthian</HI> Row of Pillars, and is
much the handsomest of any I there saw.
The Duke of <HI>Doria</HI>'s Palace has the best
Outside of any in <HI>Genoa,</HI> as that of <HI>Du∣razzo</HI>
is the best furnished within. There
is one Room in the first, that is hung
with Tapestry, in which are wrought the
Figures of the great Persons, that the Fa∣mily
has produced; as perhaps there is
no House in <HI>Europe,</HI> that can show a lon∣ger
Line of Heroes, that have still acted
for the Good of their Country. <HI>Andrew
Doria</HI> has a Statue erected to him at the
Entrance of the Doge's Palace, with the
glorious Title of Deliverer of the Com∣mon-wealth;
and one of his Family ano∣ther,
that calls him its Preserver. In the
Doge's Palace, are the Rooms, where the
great and little Council with the Two
Colleges hold their Assemblies; but as
the State of <HI>Genoa</HI> is very poor, tho' se∣veral
of its Members are extreamly rich,
so one may observe infinitely more Splen∣dor
and Magnificence, in particular Per∣sons
Houses, than in those that belong
to the Publick. But we find in most of
the States of <HI>Europe,</HI> that the People show
the greatest Marks of Poverty, where
<PB N="11" REF="32"/>
the Governors live in the greatest Mag∣nificence.
The Churches are very fine,
particularly that of the Annunciation,
which looks wonderfully beautiful in the
Inside, all but one Corner of it being co∣vered
with Statues, Gilding and Paint.
A Man would expect, in so very ancient
a Town of <HI>Italy,</HI> to find some considera∣ble
Antiquities; but all they have to show
of this Nature is an old <HI>Rostrum</HI> of a <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Ship, that stands over the Door of
their Arsenal. It is not above a Foot long,
and perhaps would never have been
thought the Beak of a Ship, had not it
been found in so probable a Place as the
Haven. It is all of Iron, fashioned at the
End like a Boar's Head; as I have seen
it represented on Medals, and on the <HI>Co∣lumna
Rostrata</HI> in <HI>Rome.</HI> I saw at <HI>Genoa</HI>
Signior <HI>Micconi</HI>'s famous Collection of
Shells, which, as Father <HI>Buonani</HI> the Je∣fuite
has since told me, is one of the best
in <HI>Italy.</HI> I know nothing more remark∣able,
in the Government of <HI>Genoa,</HI> than
the Bank of St. <HI>George,</HI> made up of such
Branches of the Revenues, as have been
set apart, and appropriated to the dis∣charging
of several Sums, that have been
borrowed from private Persons, during
the Exigencies of the Common-wealth.
<PB N="12" REF="33"/>
Whatever Inconveniencies the State has
laboured under, they have never enter∣tained
a Thought of violating the Pub∣lick
Credit, or of alienating any Part of
these Revenues to other Uses, than to
what they have been thus assigned. The
Administration of this Bank is for Life,
and partly in the Hands of the chief Ci∣tizens,
which gives them a great Autho∣rity
in the State, and a powerful Influ∣ence
over the common people. This
Bank is generally thought the greatest
Load on the <HI>Genoese,</HI> and the Managers
of it have been represented as a second
kind of Senate, that break the Unifor∣mity
of Government, and destroy, in some
measure, the Fundamental Constitution
of the State. It is however very certain,
that the People reap no small Advantages
from it, as it distributes the Power a∣mong
more particular Members of the
Republick, and gives the Commons a Fi∣gure:
So that it is no small Check up∣on
the Aristocracy, and may be one Rea∣son,
why the <HI>Genoese</HI> Senate carries it with
greater Moderation towards their Sub∣jects,
than the <HI>Venetian.</HI></P>
<P>It would have been well for the Re∣publick
of <HI>Genoa,</HI> if she had followed the
Example of her Sister of <HI>Venice,</HI> in not
<PB N="13" REF="34"/>
permitting her Nobles to make any Pur∣chase
of Lands or Houses in the Domi∣nions
of a Foreign Prince. For at pre∣sent
the Greatest, among the <HI>Genoese,</HI> are
in part Subjects to the Monarchy of
<HI>Spain,</HI> by reason of their Estates that lye
in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> The <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
Tax them very high upon occasion,
and are so sensible of the Advantage this
gives them over the Republick, that
they will not suffer a <HI>Neapolitan</HI> to buy
the Lands of a <HI>Genoese,</HI> who must find
a Purchaser among his own Country∣men,
if he has a Mind to sell. For this
Reason, as well as on Account of the
great Sums of Mony which the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI>
owes the <HI>Genoese,</HI> they are under a
Necessity, at present, of being in the In∣terest
of the <HI>French,</HI> and would probably
continue so, tho' all the other States of
<HI>Italy</HI> entered into a League against them.
<HI>Genoa</HI> is not yet secure from a Bombard∣ment,
tho' it is not so exposed as former∣ly;
for, since the Insult of the <HI>French,</HI>
they have built a Mole, with some little
Ports, and have provided themselves with
long Guns and Mortars. It is easie for
those that are strong at Sea to bring them
to what Terms they pleafe; for having but
very little Arable Land, they are forced to
<PB N="14" REF="35"/>
fetch all their Corn from <HI>Naples, Sicily,</HI>
and other Foreign Countries; except
what comes to them from <HI>Lombardy,</HI>
which probably goes another way,
whilst it furnishes Two great Armies
with Provisions. Their Fleet, that for∣merly
gained so many Victories over the
<HI>Saracens, Pisans, Venetians, Turks</HI> and <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
that made them Masters of <HI>Crete,</HI>
<HI>Sardinia, Majorca, Minorca, Negrepont,</HI>
<HI>Lesbos, Malta,</HI> that settled them in <HI>Scio,</HI>
<HI>Smyrna, Achaia, Theodosia,</HI> and several
Towns on the Eastern Confines of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
is now reduced to Six Gallies. When
they had made an Addition of but Four
new ones, the King of <HI>France</HI> sent his
Orders to suppress them, telling the Re∣publick
at the same time, that he knew
very well how many they had Occasion
for. This little Fleet serves only to fetch
them Wine and Corn, and to give their
Ladies an Airing in the Summer-season.
The Republick of <HI>Genoa</HI> has a Crown
and Scepter for its Doge, by reason of
their Conquest of <HI>Corsica,</HI> where there
was formerly a <HI>Saracen</HI> King. This in∣deed
gives their Ambassadors a more ho∣nourable
Reception at some Courts, but,
at the same time, may teach their Peo∣ple
to have a mean Notion of their own
<PB N="15" REF="36"/>
Form of Government, and is a tacit Ac∣knowledgment
that Monarchy is the
more honourable. The old <HI>Romans,</HI> on
the contrary, made use of a very barba∣rous
kind of Politicks to inspire their
People with a Contempt of Kings, whom
they treated with Infamy, and dragged
at the Wheels of their Triumphal Cha∣riots.</P>

<P>FROM <HI>Genoa</HI> we took Chaise for <HI>Mi∣lan,</HI>
and by the way stopped at <HI>Pa∣via,</HI>
that was once the Metropolis of a
Kingdom, but is at present a poor Town.
We here saw the Convent of <HI>Austin</HI>
Monks, who about Three Years ago
pretended to have found out the Body
of the Saint, that gives the Name to
their Order. King <HI>Luitprand,</HI> whose
Ashes are in the same Church, brought
hither the Corps, and was very industri∣ous
to conceal it, lest it might be abused
by the barbarous Nations, which at that
time ravaged <HI>Italy.</HI> One would there∣fore
rather wonder that it has not been
found out much earlier, than that it is
discovered at last. The Fathers howe∣ver
do not yet find their Account in the
Discovery they have made; for there are
Canons Regular, who have half the same
<PB N="17" REF="38"/>
Church in their Hands, that will by no
means allow it to be the Body of the
Saint, nor is it yet recognised by the
Pope. The Monks say for themselves,
that the very Name was written on the
Urn where the Ashes lay, and that in
an old Record of the Convent, they are
said to have been interred between the
very Wall and the Altar where they
were taken up. They have already too,
as the Monks told us, begun to justifie
themselves by Miracles. At the Corner
of one of the Cloisters of this Convent
are bury'd the Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who were both killed
in the famous Battel of <HI>Pavia.</HI> Their

<P>In <HI>Pavia</HI> is an University of Seven Col∣leges,
one of them called the College of
<HI>Borromee,</HI> very large, and nearly built.
There is likewise a Statue in Brass, of
<HI>Marcus Antoninus</HI> on Horseback, which
the People of the Place call <HI>Charles</HI> the
Fifth, and some learned Men <HI>Constantine</HI>
the Great.</P>
<P><HI>Pavia</HI> is the <HI>Ticinum</HI> of the Ancients,
which took its Name from the River
<HI>Ticinus</HI> which runs by it, and is now
call'd the <HI>Tesin.</HI> This River falls into the
<HI>Po,</HI> and is excessively rapid. The Bishop
of <HI>Salisbury</HI> says, that he ran down with
the Stream Thirty Miles in an Hour, by
the help of but one Rower. I do not
know therefore why <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> has re∣presented
it as so very gentle and still a
River, in the beautiful Description he
has given us of it.<Q><L>Caeruleas Ticinus aquas et Stagna vadoso</L>

<L>And tuneful Birds that warble on its Sides,</L>
<L>Within its gloomy Banks the Limpid Li∣quor
glides.</L></Q></P>
<P>A Poet of another Nation would not
have dwelt so long upon the Clearness
and Transparency of the Stream, but in
<HI>Italy</HI> one seldom sees a River that is ex∣treamly
bright and limpid, most of them
falling down from the Mountains, that
make their Waters very troubled and
muddy, whereas the <HI>Tesin</HI> is only an Out∣let
of that vast Lake, which the <HI>Italians</HI>
now call the <HI>Lago Maggiore.</HI></P>
<P>I saw between <HI>Pavia</HI> and <HI>Milan</HI> the
Convent of <HI>Carthusians,</HI> which is very spa∣cious
and beautiful. Their Church is
extreamly fine, and curiously adorned,
but of a <HI>Gothic</HI> Structure.</P>
<P>I could not stay long in <HI>Milan</HI> with∣out
going to see the Great Church that
<PB N="21" REF="42"/>
I had heard so much of, but was never
more deceived in my Expectation than
at my first entering: For the Front,
which was all I had seen of the Outside,
is not half finished, and the Inside is so
smutted with Dust, and the Smoak of
Lamps, that neither the Marble, nor
the Silver, nor Brass-Works show them∣selves
to an Advantage. This vast <HI>Gothic</HI>
Pile of Building is all of Marble, except
the Roof, which would have been of the
same Matter with the rest, had not its
Weight rendered it improper for that
part of the Building. But for the Rea∣son
I have just now mentioned, the Out∣side
of the Church looks much whiter
and fresher than the Inside; for where
the Marble is so often washed with Rains,
it preserves it self more beautiful and un∣sullyed,
than in those Parts that are not
at all exposed to the Weather. That
Side of the Church indeed, which faces
the Tramontane Wind, is much more
unsightly than the rest, by reason of the
Dust and Smoak that are driven against
it. This Profusion of Marble, tho' asto∣nishing
to Strangers, is not very won∣derful
in a Country that has so many
Veins of it within its Bowels. But tho'
the Stones are cheap, the working of
them is very expensive. It is generally
<PB N="22" REF="43"/>
said there are Eleven Thousand Statues
about the Church, but they reckon in∣to
the Account every particular Figure
in the History-pieces, and several little
Images which make up the Equipage of
those that are larger. There are indeed a
great Multitude of such as are bigger
than the Life: I reckoned above Two
Hundred and Fifty on the Outside of
the Church, tho' I only told Three Sides
of it; and these are not half so thick
set as they intend them. The Statues are
all of Marble, and generally well cut; but
the most valuable one they have is a
St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> new-flead, with his Skin
hanging over his Shoulders: It is esteemed
worth its weight in Gold: They have
inscribed this Verse on the Pedestal, to
show the Value they have for the Work∣man.</P>
<Q><L>Non me Praxiteles sed Marcus finxit Agrati.</L><LG>
<L>Lest at the Sculptor doubtfully you guess,</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Marc Agrati,</HI> not <HI>Praxiteles.</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
<P>There is, just before the Entrance of
the Quire, a little Subterraneous Chap∣pel,
Dedicated to St. <HI>Charles Borromee,</HI>
where I saw his Body, in Episcopal
Robes, lying upon the Altar in a Shrine
<PB N="23" REF="44"/>
of Rock-Crystal. His Chappel is adorned
with abundance of Silver Work: He
was but Two and Twenty Years old
when he was chosen Arch-Bishop of <HI>Mi∣lan,</HI>
and Forty Six at his Death; but
made so good use of so short a time, by
his Works of Charity and Munificence,
that his Countrymen bless his Memory,
which is still fresh among them. He was
Cannonised about a Hundred Years ago:
and indeed if this Honour were due to
any Man, I think such Publick-spirited
Virtues may lay a juster Claim to it, than
a sour Retreat from Mankind, a fiery
Zeal against <HI>Heterodoxies,</HI> a Set of Chi∣merical
Visions, or of Whimsical Pe∣nances,
which are generally the Qualifica∣tions
of <HI>Roman</HI> Saints. Miracles indeed
are required of all who aspire to this Dig∣nity,
because they say an Hypocrite may
imitate a Saint in all other Particulars,
and these they attribute in great Num∣ber,
to him I am speaking of. His Me∣rit,
and the Importunity of his Country∣men,
procured his Canonization before
the ordinary time; for it is the Policy of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church not to allow this Ho∣nour,
ordinarily, 'till Fifty Years after
the Death of the Person, who is a Candi∣date
for it; in which time it may be sup∣posed
that all his Contemporaries will be
<PB N="24" REF="45"/>
worn out, who could contradict a pre∣tended
Miracle, or remember any Infir∣mity
of the Saint. One would wonder
that <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who are for this
kind of Worship, do not generally ad∣dress
themselves to the Holy Apostles,
who have a more unquestionable Right
to the Title of Saints than those of a
Modern Date; but these are at present
quite out of Fashion in <HI>Italy,</HI> where
there is scarce a great Town, which does
not pay its Devotions, in a more particu∣lar
manner, to some one of their own
making. This renders it very suspicious,
that the Interests of Particular Families,
Religious Orders, Convents or Churches,
have too great a Sway in their Canoni∣zations.
When I was at <HI>Milan</HI> I saw a
Book newly published, that was Dedica∣ted
to the present Head of the <HI>Borromean</HI>
Family, and entitled, <HI>A Discourse on the
Humility of</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>and of St.</HI> Charles
Borromee.</P>
<P>The Great Church of <HI>Milan</HI> has Two
Noble Pulpits of Brass, each of them run∣ning
round a large Pillar, like a Gallery,
and supported by huge Figures of the
same Metal. The History of our Savi∣our,
or rather of the Blessed Virgin,
for it begins with her Birth, and ends
with her Coronation in Heaven, that of
<PB N="25" REF="46"/>
our Saviour coming in by way of <HI>Episode</HI>)
is finely cut in Marble by <HI>Andrew Biffy.</HI>
This Church is very Rich in Relicks,
which run up as high as <HI>Daniel, Jonas</HI>
and <HI>Abraham.</HI> Among the rest they show
a Fragment of our Countryman <HI>Becket,</HI>
as indeed there are very few Treasuries
of Relicks in <HI>Italy</HI> that have not a Tooth
or a Bone of this Saint. It would be end∣less
to count up the Riches of Silver,
Gold, and Precious Stones, that are
amass'd together in this and several other
Churches of <HI>Milan.</HI> I was told, that in
<HI>Milan</HI> there are Sixty Convents of Wo∣men,
Eighty of Men, and Two Hun∣dred
Churches. At the <HI>Celestines</HI> is a
Picture in Fresco of the Marriage of
<HI>Cana,</HI> very much esteem'd; but the
Painter, whether designedly or not, has
put Six Fingers to the Hand of one of
the Figures: They show the Gates of
a Church that St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> shut against
the Emperor <HI>Theodosius,</HI> as thinking him
unfit to assist at Divine Service, 'till he
had done some extraordinary Penance
for his barbarous Massacring the Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Thessalonica.</HI> That Emperor
was however so far from being displeas'd
with the Behaviour of the Saint, that
at his Death he committed to him the
Education of his Children. Several have
<PB N="26" REF="47"/>
pick'd Splinters of Wood out of the
Gates for Relicks. There is a little Chap∣pel
lately re-edify'd, where the same
Saint baptis'd St. <HI>Austin.</HI> An Inscription
upon the Wall of it says, that it was in
this Chappel, and on this Occasion, that
he first sung his <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and that his
great Convert answered him Verse by
Verse. In one of the Churches I saw
a Pulpit and Confessional, very finely In∣laid
with <HI>Lapis-Lazuli,</HI> and several kinds
of Marble, by a Father of the Convent.
It is very lucky for a Religious, who has
so much Time on his Hands, to be
able to amuse himself with Works of
this Nature; and one often finds parti∣cular
Members of Convents, who have
excellent Mechanical Genius's, and di∣vert
themselves, at leisure Hours, with
Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Gar∣dening,
and several kinds of Handy-Crafts.
Since I have mention'd Con∣fessionals,
I shall set down here some In∣scriptions
that I have seen over them in

I saw the <HI>Ambrosian</HI> Library,
where, to show the <HI>Italian</HI> Genius, they
have spent more Money on Pictures than
on Books. Among the Heads of several
learned Men I met with no <HI>Englishman,</HI>
except Bishop <HI>Fisher,</HI> whom <HI>Henry</HI> the
Eighth put to Death for not owning his
Supremacy. Books are indeed the least
part of the Furniture that one ordinarily
goes to see in an <HI>Italian</HI> Library, which
they generally set off with Pictures, Sta∣tues,
and other Ornaments, where they
can afford them, after the Example of
the old <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI><Q><L>—Plena omnia gypso</L>

<P>In an Apartment behind the Library
are several Rarities often described
by Travellers, as <HI>Brugeal</HI>'s Elements, a
Head of <HI>Titian</HI> by his own Hand, a
Manuscript in <HI>Latin</HI> of <HI>Josephus,</HI> which
the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI> says was written
about the Age of <HI>Theodosius,</HI> and another
of <HI>Leonardus Vincius,</HI> which King <HI>James</HI>
the First could not procure, tho' he
proffered for it Three Thousand <HI>Spanish</HI>
Pistols. It consists of Designings in Me∣chanism
and Engineering: I was shown
in it a Sketch of Bombs and Mortars, as
they are now used. Canon <HI>Settala</HI>'s Ca∣binet
is always shown to a Stranger a∣mong
the Curiosities of <HI>Milan,</HI> which I
shall not be particular upon, the Print∣ed
Account of it being common enough.
Among its Natural Curiosities I took
particular notice of a Piece of Chrystal,
that enclos'd a couple of Drops, which
look'd like Water when they were sha∣ken,
tho' perhaps they are nothing but
Bubbles of Air. It is such a Rarity as
this that I saw at <HI>Vendome</HI> in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="50"/>
which they there pretend is a Tear that
our Saviour shed over <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and was
gather'd up by an Angel, who put it
in a little Chrystal Vial, and made a Pre∣sent
of it to <HI>Mary Magdalene.</HI> The
Famous <HI>Pere Mabillon</HI> is now engag'd in
the Vindication of this Tear, which a
learned Ecclesiastic, in the Neighbour∣hood
of <HI>Vendome,</HI> would have suppressed,
as a false and ridiculous Relick, in
a Book that he has Dedicated to
his Diocesan the Bishop of <HI>Blois.</HI> It is
in the Possession of a <HI>Benedictin</HI> Convent,
which raises a considerable Revenue out
of the Devotion that is paid to it, and
has now retained the most learned Father
of their Order to write in its Defence.</P>
<P>It was such a Curiosity as this I have
mention'd, that <HI>Claudian</HI> has celebrated
in about half a Score Epigrams.<Q><L>Solibus indomitum glacies Alpina rigorem</L>

<L>That through the Chrystal darts its spu∣rious
Rays,</L>
<L>And the proud Stone's Original betrays:</L>
<L>But common Drops, when thus with
Chrystal mixt,</L>
<L>Are valu'd more, than if in Rubies fixt.</L>

<P>As I walk'd thro' one of the Streets

The Citadel of <HI>Milan</HI> is thought a
strong Fort in <HI>Italy,</HI> and has held out
formerly after the Conquest of the
rest of the Dutchy. The Governor of it
is independent on the Governor of <HI>Mi∣lan</HI>;
as the <HI>Persians</HI> used to make the
Rulers of Provinces and Fortresses of
different Conditions and Interests, to pre∣vent
Conspiracies.</P>
<P>At Two Miles distance from <HI>Milan</HI>
there stands a Building, that would have
been a Master-piece in its kind, had the
Architect design'd it for an Artificial
Echo. We discharg'd a Pistol, and had
the Sound return'd upon us above Fifty
Six times, tho' the Air was very foggy.
The first Repetitions follow one ano∣ther
very thick, but are heard more di∣stinctly
in proportion as they decay:
There are Two parallel Walls which beat
the Sound back on each other, 'till the
Undulation is quite worn out, like the
several Reverberations of the same Image
from two opposite Looking-Glasses.
Father <HI>Kircher</HI> has taken notice of this
particular Echo, as Father <HI>Bartolin</HI> has
done since in his Ingenious Discourse on
Sounds. The State of <HI>Milan</HI> is like a
vast Garden, surrounded by a Noble
Mound-Work of Rocks and Mountains:
Indeed if a Man considers the Face of
<PB N="33" REF="54"/>
<HI>Italy</HI> in general, one would think that
Nature had laid it out into such a Varie∣ty
of States and Governments as one
finds in it. For as the <HI>Alpes</HI> at one End,
and the long Range of <HI>Appenines,</HI> that
passes thro' the Body of it, branch out
on all sides into several different Divisi∣ons;
they serve as so many natural Boun∣daries
and Fortifications to the little Ter∣ritories
that lye among them. Accor∣dingly
we find the whole Country cut
into a Multitude of particular King∣doms
and Common-wealths in the oldest
Accounts we have of it, 'till the Power
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> like a Torrent that o∣verflows
its Banks, bore down all before
it, and spread it self into the remotest
Corners of the Nation. But as this Ex∣orbitant
Power became unable to sup∣port
it self, we find the Government of
<HI>Italy</HI> again broken into such a Variety
of Sub-Divisions, as naturally suits with
its Situation.</P>
<P>In the Court of <HI>Milan,</HI> as in several
others of <HI>Italy,</HI> there are many who fall
in with the Dress and Carriage of the
<HI>French.</HI> One may however observe a kind
of Awkwardness in the <HI>Italians,</HI> which ea∣sily
discovers the Airs they give them∣selves
not to be natural. It is indeed
very strange there should be such a
<PB N="34" REF="55"/>
Diversity of Manners, where there is
so small a difference in the Air and Cli∣mate.
The <HI>French</HI> are always Open,
Familiar and Talkative: The <HI>Italians,</HI>
on the contrary, are Stiff, Ceremonious
and Reserved. In <HI>France</HI> every one
aims at a Gaiety and Sprightliness of Be∣haviour,
and thinks it an Accomplish∣ment
to be brisk and lively: The <HI>Itali∣ans,</HI>
notwithstanding their natural Fieri∣ness
of Temper, affect always to appear
Sober and Sedate; insomuch that one
sometimes meets Young Men walking
the Streets with Spectacles on their
Noses, that they may be thought to
have impaired their Sight by much
Study, and seem more Grave and Judi∣cious
than their Neighbours. This Dif∣ference
of Manners proceeds chiefly
from Difference of Education: In <HI>France</HI>
it is usual to bring their Children into
Company, and to cherish in them, from
their Infancy, a kind of Forwardness
and Assurance: Besides, that the <HI>French</HI>
apply themselves more universally to their
Exercises than any other Nation in the
World, so that one seldom sees a Young
Gentleman in <HI>France</HI> that does not Fence,
Dance, and Ride in some tolerable Per∣fection.
These Agitations of the Body
do not only give them a free and easie
<PB N="35" REF="56"/>
Carriage, but have a kind of Mechani∣cal
Operation on the Mind, by keeping
the Animal Spirits always awake and in
Motion. But what contributes most
to this light airy Humour of the <HI>French,</HI>
is the Free Conversation that is allowed
them with their Women, which does
not only communicate to them a certain
Vivacity of Temper, but makes them
endeavour after such a Behaviour as is
most taking with the Sex.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians,</HI> on the contrary, who are
excluded from making their Court this
way, are for recommending themselves
to those they Converse with by their
Gravity and Wisdom. In <HI>Spain</HI> there∣fore,
where there are fewer Liberties
of this Nature allowed, there is some∣thing
still more serious and composed in
the manner of the Inhabitants. But
as Mirth is more apt to make Proselytes
than Melancholy, it is observed that the
<HI>Italians</HI> have many of them for these late
Years given very far into the Modes
and Freedoms of the <HI>French</HI>; which pre∣vail
more or less in the Courts of <HI>Italy,</HI>
as they lye at a smaller or greater Di∣stance
from <HI>France.</HI> It may be here
worth while to consider how it comes
to pass, that the Common People of <HI>Ita∣ly</HI>
have in general so very great an Aversion
<PB N="36" REF="57"/>
to the <HI>French,</HI> which every Traveller
cannot but be sensible of, that has pas∣sed
thro' the Country. The most obvi∣ous
Reason is certainly the great Diffe∣rence
that there is in the Humours and
Manners of the Two Nations, which
always works more in the meaner
sort, who are not able to vanquish the
Prejudices of Education, than with the
Nobility. Besides, that the <HI>French</HI> Hu∣mour,
in regard of the Liberties they
take in Female Conversations, and their
great Ambition to Excel in all Compa∣nies,
is in a more particular manner very
shocking to the <HI>Italians,</HI> who are natu∣rally
Jealous, and value themselves upon
their great Wisdom. At the same time
the common People of <HI>Italy,</HI> who run
more into News and Politicks than those
of other Countries, have all of them
something to exasperate them against the
King of <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>Savoyards,</HI> not∣withstanding
the present Inclinations
of their Court, cannot forbear re∣senting
the infinite Mischiefs he did
them in the last War. The <HI>Milanese</HI>
and <HI>Neapolitans</HI> remember the many In∣sults
he has offer'd to the House of
<HI>Austria,</HI> and particularly to their De∣ceased
King, for whom they still retain
a natural kind of Honour and Affection.
<PB N="37" REF="58"/>
The <HI>Genoese</HI> cannot forget his Treatment
of their Doge, and his Bombarding their
City. The <HI>Venetians</HI> will tell you of his
Leagues with the <HI>Turks</HI>; and the <HI>Romans,</HI>
of his Threats to Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the Ele∣venth,
whose Memory they adore. It is
true, that Interest of State, and Change
of Circumstances, may have sweetened
these Reflections to the Politer sort, but
Impressions are not so easily worn out
of the Minds of the Vulgar. That how∣ever,
which I take to be the Principal
Motive among most of the <HI>Italians,</HI> for
their favouring the <HI>Germans</HI> above the
<HI>French,</HI> is this, that they are entirely
persuaded it is for the Interest of <HI>Italy,</HI>
to have <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> rather in the
Hands of the first than of the other.
One may generally observe, that the
Body of a People has juster Views for
the Publick Good, and pursues them
with greater Uprightness than the No∣bility
and Gentry, who have so many
private Expectations and particular In∣terests,
which hang like a false Biass upon
their Judgments, and may possibly dis∣pose
them to sacrifice the Good of their
Country to the Advancement of their
own Fortunes; whereas the Gross of the
People can have no other Prospect in
Changes and Revolutions than of Pub∣lick
<PB N="38" REF="59"/>
Blessings, that are to diffuse them∣selves
thro' the whole State in general.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Milan</HI>: I shall here set
down the Description <HI>Ausonius</HI> has given
of it, among the rest of his great
Cities.<Q><L>Et Mediolani mira omnia, copia rerum:</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>ROM <HI>Milan</HI> we travell'd

cross'd the River <HI>Adda,</HI> that
falls into the <HI>Lago di Como,</HI>
which <HI>Virgil</HI> calls the Lake <HI>Larius,</HI> and
running out at the other End loses it self
at last in the <HI>Po,</HI> which is the great Re∣ceptacle
of all the Rivers of this Coun∣try.
The Town and Province of <HI>Bre∣scia</HI>
have freer Access to the Senate of
<HI>Venice,</HI> and a quicker Redress of Injuries,
than any other Part of their Dominions.
They have always a mild and prudent
Governor, and live much more happily
than their Fellow-Subjects: For as they
were once a Part of the <HI>Milanese,</HI> and
are now on their Frontiers, the <HI>Veneti∣ans</HI>
dare not exasperate them, by the
<PB N="41" REF="62"/>
Loads they lay on other Provinces, for
fear of a Revolt; and are forc'd to Treat
them with much more Indulgence than
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do their Neighbours, that
they may have no Temptation to it.
<HI>Brescia</HI> is famous for its Iron-Works.
A small Day's Journey more brought us
to <HI>Verona.</HI> We saw the Lake <HI>Benacus</HI>
in our way, which the <HI>Italians</HI> now call
<HI>Lago di Garda</HI>: It was so rough with
Tempests when we pass'd by it, that it
brought into my Mind <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Noble

round it are almost entirely ruined, and
the Area is quite filled up to the lower
Seat, which was formerly deep enough
to let the Spectators see in Safety the
Combats of the Wild Beasts and Gladi∣ators.

Then rearing on his hinder Paws retires,</L>
<L>And the vast hissing Multitude admires.</L></Q></P>
<P>There are some other Antiquities in
<HI>Verona,</HI> of which the Principal is the
Ruin of a Triumphal Arch erected to
<HI>Flaminius,</HI> where one sees old <HI>Doric</HI> Pil∣lars
without any Pedestal or Basis, as <HI>Vi∣truvius</HI>
has described them. I have not
yet seen any Gardens in <HI>Italy</HI> worth ta∣king
notice of. The <HI>Italians</HI> fall as far
short of the <HI>French</HI> in this Particular, as
they excel them in their Palaces. It
must however be said, to the Honour
of the <HI>Italians,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> took from
them the first Plans of their Gardens, as
well as of their Water-Works; so that
their surpassing of them at present is to
be attributed rather to the Greatness of
their Riches, than the Excellence of
their Taste. I saw the Terrace-Garden
of <HI>Verona,</HI> that Travellers gene∣rally
mention. Among the Churches of
<HI>Verona,</HI> that of St. <HI>George</HI> is the hand∣somest:
Its chief Ornament is the Mar∣tyrdom
of the Saint, drawn by <HI>Paul
Veronese</HI>; as there are many other Pi∣ctures
about the Town by the same
Hand. A Stranger is always shown the
Tomb of Pope <HI>Lucius,</HI> who lyes buried
in the Dome. I saw in the same Church
<PB N="46" REF="67"/>
a Monument erected by the Publick to
one of their Bishops: The Inscription
says, that there was between him and
his Maker, <HI>Summa Necessitudo, Summa
Similitudo.</HI> The <HI>Italian</HI> Epitaphs are
often more extravagant than those of o∣ther
Countries, as the Nation is more
given to Compliment and Hyperbole.
From <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Padua</HI> we travelled thro'
a very pleasant Country: It is planted
thick with Rows of White Mulberry-trees,
that furnish Food for great Quan∣tities
of Silk-worms with their Leaves,
as the Swine and Poultry consume the
Fruit. The Trees themselves serve, at
the same time, as so many Stays for their
Vines, which hang all along like Garlands
from Tree to Tree. Between the seve∣ral
Ranges lye Fields of Corn, which in
these warm Countries ripens much bet∣ter
among the Mulberry Shades, than if
it were exposed to the open Sun. This
was one Reason why the Inhabitants of
this Country, when I passed thro' it,
were extreamly apprehensive of seeing
<HI>Lombardy</HI> the Seat of War, which must
have made miserable Havock among
their Plantations; for it is not here as in
the Corn Fields of <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the
whole Product of the Place rises from
Year to Year. We arrived so late at <HI>Vi∣cenza,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="68"/>
that we had not time to take a
full Sight of the Place. The next Day
brought us to <HI>Padua.</HI> St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who
lived about Five Hundred Years ago, is
the great Saint to whom they here pay
their Devotions. He lyes buried in the
Church that is Dedicated to him at pre∣sent,
tho' it was formerly Consecrated
to the Blessed Virgin. It is extreamly
magnificent, and very richly adorned.
There are narrow Clefts in the Monu∣ment
that stands over him, where good
Catholicks rub their Beads, and smell
his Bones, which they say have in them
a natural Perfume, tho' very like Apo∣plectic
Balsom; and what would make
one suspect that they rub the Marble
with it, it is observed that the Scent is
stronger in the Morning than at Night.
There are abundance of Inscriptions and
Pictures hung up by his Votaries in se∣veral
Parts of the Church: For it is the
way of those that are in any Signal Dan∣ger
to implore his Aid, and if they come
off safe they call their Deliverance a Mi∣racle,
and perhaps hang up the Picture
or Description of it in the Church. This
Custom spoils the Beauty of several <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Catholick Churches, and often co∣vers
the Walls with wretched Daub∣ings,
impertinent Inscriptions, Hands,
<PB N="48" REF="69"/>
Legs, and Arms of Wax, with a Thou∣sand
idle Offerings of the same Nature.</P>
<P>They sell at <HI>Padua</HI> the Life of St.
<HI>Anthony,</HI> which is read with great De∣votion;
the most remarkable Part of it
is his Discourse to an Assembly of Fish.
As the Audience and Sermon are both
very extraordinary, I will set down the
whole Passage at length.<Q><P>Non curando gli Heretici il suo parlare,
egli si come era alla riva del mare, dove
shocca il fiume Marecchia, chiamò da parte
di Dio li pesci, che venissero à sentir la sua
santa parola. Et ecco che di subito sopra
l'acque nuotando gran moltitudine di varii,
&amp; diversi pesci, e del mare, e del fiume, si
unirono tutti, secondo le specie loro, e con
bell ordine, quasi che di ragion capaci stati
fossero, attenti, e cheti con gratioso spetta∣colo
s'accommodaro per sentir la parola di
Dio. Ciò veduto il santo entro al cuor suo
di dolcezza stillandosi, &amp; per altretanta ma∣raviglia
inarcando le ciglia, della obedientia
di queste irragionevoli creature così cominciò
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oro à parlare. Se bene in tutte le cose create
(cari, &amp; amati pesci) si scuopre la potenza,
&amp; providenza infinita di Dio, come nel
Cielo, nel Sole, nella Luna, nelle stelle, in
questo mondo inferiore, nell huomo, e nelle
altre creature perfette, nondimeno in Voi
particolarmente lampeggia e risplende la bontà
<PB N="49" REF="70"/>
della maestà divina; perche se bone siete chi∣amati
Rettili, mezzi frà pietre, e bruti,
confinati nelli profondi abissi delle ondeggiante
acque: agitati sempre da flutti: mossi sem∣pre
da procelle; sordi al' udire, mutoli al
parlare, &amp; horridi al vedere; con tutto ciò
in Voi maravigliosamente si scorge la Divina
grandezza; e da voi si cavano li maggiori
misterii della bontà di Dio, ne mai si parla
di voi nella Scrittura Sacra, che non vi sia
ascosto qualche profondo Sacramento; Cre∣dete
voi, che sia senza grandissimo misterio,
che il primo dono fatto dall' onnipotente Id∣dio
all' huomo fosse di voi Pesci? Credete voi
che non sia misterio in questo, che di tutte le cre∣ature,
e di tutti gl' animali si sien fatti sacrifi∣cii,
eccetto, che di voi Pesci? Credete, che non
vi sia qualche secreto in questo, che Chri∣sto
nostro salvatore dall' agnelo pasquale in
poi, si compiacque tanto del cibo di voi pesci?
Credete, che sia à caso questo, che dovendo
il Redentor del mondo, pagar, come huomo,
il censo à Cesare la volesse trovaare nella boc∣ca
di un pesce? Tutti, tutti sono misteri è
Sacramenti: perciò siete particolarmente ob∣ligati
a lodare il vostro Creatore: amati pe∣sci
di Dio havete rivevuto l'essere, la vita,
il moto, e'l senso; per stanza vi hà dato il
liquido elemento dell' Acqua, secondo che alla
vostra naturale inclinatione conviene: ivi hà
fatti amplissimi alberghi, stanze, caverne,

senza contrastro alcuno; nè algor d'inverno,
nè calor di state vi offende, ò nuoce; siasi

siasi pure abbondevole de suoi tesori, ò scar∣sa
de suoi frutti la terra, che a voi nulla

il mondo, che a voi ciò poco importa;
verdeggi prinavera, scaldi la state, fruttifi∣chi
l' Autunno, &amp; assideri li inverno, questo

nè correr de giorni, nè volar de mesi, ne fug∣gir
d'anni, ne mutar de tempi, ne cangiar de sta∣gioni
vi dan pensiero alcuno, ma sempre sicura,
&amp; tranquilla vita liatamente vivere: O quan∣to,
o quanto grande la Maestâ di Dio in voi si
scuopre, O quanto mirabile la potenza sua; O
quanto stupenda, &amp; maravigliosa la sua provi∣denza;
poi che frà tutte le creature dell' univer∣so
<PB N="51" REF="72"/>
so voi solo non sentisti il diluvio universale dell'
acque; nè provasti i danni, che egli face almon∣do;
e tutto questo ch' io ho detto dovrebbe muo∣vervi
à lodar Dio a ringratiare sua divina
maestà di tanti e cosi singolari beneficii, che vi
ha fatti, di tante gratie: che vi ha conferite, di
tanti favori, di che vi ha fatti degna; per
tanto, se non potete snodar la lingua à ringrati∣ar
il vostro Benefattore, &amp; non sapete con pa∣role
esprimer le sue lodi, fatele segno di rive∣renza
almeno; chinatevi al suo nome; mo∣strate
nel modo che potete sembiante di gratitu∣dine;
rendetevi benevoli alla bontà sua, in quel
miglior modo che potete; O sapete, non siate
sconoscenti de suoi beneficii, &amp; non siate in∣grati
de suoi favori. A questo dire, O mara∣viglia
grande, come si quelli pesci havessero
havuto humano intelletto, e discorso, con gesti
di profonda Humiltà, con riverenti sembi∣anti
di religione, chinarono la testa, blandiro
co'l corpo, quasi approvando ciò che detto
havea il benedetto padre S. Antonio.</P></Q><Q><P>When the Hereticks would not re∣gard
his Preaching, he betook himself
to the Sea-shore, where the River
<HI>Marecchia</HI> disembogues it self into the
Adriatic. He here called the Fish to∣gether
in the Name of God, that
they might hear his Holy Word. The
Fish came swimming towards him in
such vast Shoals, both from the Sea
<PB N="52" REF="73"/>
and from the River, that the Surface
of the Water was quite covered with
their Multitudes. They quickly ran∣ged
themselves, according to their se∣veral
Species, into a very beautiful
Congregation, and, like so many ra∣tional
Creatures, presented themselves
before him to hear the Word of God.
St. <HI>Antonio</HI> was so struck with the mi∣raculous
Obedience and Submission of
these poor Animals, that he found a
secret Sweetness distilling upon his
Soul, and at last addressed himself to
them in the following Words.</P>
<P>Altho' the Infinite Power and Pro∣vidence
of God (my dearly beloved
Fish) discovers it self in all the Works
of his Creation, as in the Heavens, in
the Sun, in the Moon, and in the
Stars, in this lower World, in Man,
and in other perfect Creatures; never∣theless
the Goodness of the Divine
Majesty shines out in you more emi∣nently,
and appears after a more par∣ticular
manner, than in any other Cre∣ated
Beings. For notwithstanding
you are comprehended under the
Name of <HI>Reptiles,</HI> partaking of a mid∣dle
Nature between Stones and Beasts,
and Imprisoned in the Deep Abyss of
Waters; notwithstanding you are
<PB N="53" REF="74"/>
tost among Billows, thrown up and
down by Tempests, deaf to Hearing,
dumb to Speech, and terrible to be∣hold:
Notwithstanding, I say, these
natural Disadvantages, the Divine
Greatness shows it self in you after a
very wonderful manner. In you are
seen the mighty Mysteries of an In∣finite
Goodness. The Holy Scripture
has always made use of you, as the
Types and Shadows of some profound
Sacrament.</P>
<P>Do you think that, without a My∣stery,
the first Present that God al∣mighty
made to Man, was of you, O
ye Fishes? Do you think that, with∣out
a Mystery, among all Creatures
and Animals which were appointed for
Sacrifices, you only were excepted, O
ye Fishes? Do you think there was
nothing meant by our Saviour Christ,
that next to the Paschal Lamb he
took so much Pleasure in the Food of
you, O ye Fishes? Do you think it
was by meer Chance, that when the
Redeemer of the World was to pay a
Tribute to <HI>Caesar,</HI> he thought fit to
find it in the Mouth of a Fish? These
are all of them so many Mysteries and
Sacraments, that oblige you in a more
particular manner to the Praises of
your Creator.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="75"/>
It is from God, my beloved Fish,
that you have received Being, Life,
Motion and Sense. It is he that has
given you, in Compliance with your
natural Inclinations, the whole World
of Waters for your Habitation<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> It is
he that has furnished it with Lodgings,
Chambers, Caverns, Grottoes, and
such magnificent Retirements as are not
to be met with in the Seats of Kings,
or in the Palaces of Princes: You have
the Water for your Dwelling, a clear
transparent Element, brighter than
Chrystal; you can see from its deepest
Bottom every thing that passes on its
Surface; you have the Eyes of a <HI>Lynx,</HI>
or of an <HI>Argus</HI>; you are guided by a
secret and unerring Principle, delight∣ing
in every thing that may be bene∣ficial
to you, and avoiding every thing
that may be hurtful; you are carried
on by a hidden Instinct to preserve
your selves, and to propagate your
Species; you obey, in all your Acti∣ons,
Works and Motions, the Di∣ctates
and Suggestions of Nature,
without the least Repugnancy or Con∣tradiction.</P>
<P>The Colds of Winter, and the
Heats of Summer, are equally inca∣pable
of molesting you. A Serene or
<PB N="55" REF="76"/>
a clouded Sky are indifferent to you.
Let the Earth abound in Fruits, or be
cursed with Scarcity, it has no Influ∣ence
on your Welfare. You live se∣cure
in Rains and Thunders, Light∣nings
and Earthquakes; you have no
Concern in the Blossoms of Spring,
or in the Glowings of Summer, in
the Fruits of Autumn, or in the
Frosts of Winter. You are not so∣licitous
about Hours or Days, Months
or Years; the Variableness of the
Weather, or the Change of Seasons.</P>
<P>In what dreadful Majesty, in what
wonderful Power, in what amazing
Providence did God Almighty distin∣guish
you among all the Species of
Creatures that perished in the Univer∣sal
Deluge! You only were insensible
of the Mischief that had laid waste
the whole World.</P>
<P>All this, as I have already told you,
ought to inspire you with Gratitude
and Praise towards the Divine Maje∣sty,
that has done so great things
for you, granted you such parti∣cular
Graces and Privileges, and
heaped upon you so many distinguish∣ing
Favours. And since for all this
you cannot employ your Tongues in
the Praises of your Benefactor, and are
<PB N="56" REF="77"/>
not provided with Words to express
your Gratitude; make at least some
Sign of Reverence; bow your selves
at his Name; give some show of Gra∣titude,
according to the best of your
Capacities; express your Thanks in
the most becoming manner that you
are able, and be not unmindful of all
the Benefits he has bestowed upon you.</P>
<P>He had no sooner done speaking,
but behold a Miracle! The Fish, as
tho' they had been endued with Rea∣son,
bowed down their Heads with
all the Marks of a profound Humility
and Devotion, moving their Bodies
up and down with a kind of Fond∣ness,
as approving what had been spo∣ken
by the Blessed Father, St. <HI>Antonio.</HI>
The Legend adds, that after many
Hereticks, who were present at the
Miracle, had been converted by it,
the Saint gave his Benediction to the
Fish, and dismissed them.</P></Q></P>
<P>Several other the like Stories of St.
<HI>Antony</HI> are represented about his Monu∣ment
in a very fine <HI>Basso Relievo.</HI></P>
<P>I could not forbear setting down the
Titles given to St. <HI>Antony</HI> in one of the
Tables that hangs up to him, as a To∣ken
of Gratitude from a poor Peasant,
who fancied the Saint had saved him
from breaking his Neck.<Q><PB N="57" REF="78"/>

<P>The Custom of hanging up Limbs in
Wax, as well as Pictures, is certainly de∣rived
from the old Heathens, who used,
upon their Recovery, to make an Of∣fering
in Wood, Metal or Clay, of the
Part that had been afflicted with a Di∣stemper,
to the Deity that delivered
them. I have seen, I believe, every
<PB N="58" REF="79"/>
Limb of a Human Body figured in Iron
or Clay, which were formerly made on
this Occasion, among the several Col∣lections
of Antiquities that have been
shown me in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Church of St.
<HI>Justina,</HI> designed by <HI>Palladio,</HI> is the most
handsom, luminous, disencumbered Build∣ing
in the Inside that I have ever seen,
and is esteemed by many Artists one of
the finest Works in <HI>Italy.</HI> The long Nef
consists of a Row of Five Cupola's, the
cross-one has on each side a single Cu∣pola
deeper and broader than the others.
The Martyrdom of St. <HI>Justina</HI> hangs o∣ver
the Altar, and is a Piece of <HI>Paul Ve∣ronese.</HI>
In the great Town-Hall of <HI>Pa∣dua</HI>
stands a Stone superscribed <HI>Lapis Vi∣tuperii.</HI>
Any Debtor that will swear him∣self
not worth Five Pound, and is set by
the Bailifs thrice with his bare Buttocks
on this Stone in a full Hall, clears him∣self
of any farther Prosecution from his
Creditors; but this is a Punishment that
no Body has submitted to these Four and
Twenty Years. The University of <HI>Pa∣dua</HI>
is of late much more regular than
it was formerly, tho' it is not yet safe
walking the Streets after Sun-set. There
is at <HI>Padua</HI> a Manufacture of Cloth,
which has brought very great Revenues
into the Republick. At present the
<PB N="59" REF="80"/>
<HI>English</HI> have not only gained upon the
<HI>Venetians</HI> in the <HI>Levant,</HI> which used
chiefly to be supplyed from this Manu∣facture,
but have great Quantities of
their Cloth in <HI>Venice</HI> it self; few of the
Nobility wearing any other sort, not∣withstanding
the Magistrate of the
Pomps is obliged by his Office to see
that no Body wears the Cloth of a For∣reign
Country. Our Merchants indeed
are forced to make use of some Artifice
to get these Prohibited Goods into Port.
What they here show for the Ashes of
<HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Antenor</HI> is disregarded by the
best of their own Antiquaries.</P>

<HEAD>VENICE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving often heard <HI>Venice</HI> re∣presented
as one of the most
defensible Cities in the
World, I took Care to in∣form
my self of the Particu∣lars
in which its Strength consists. And
these I find are chiefly owing to its ad∣vantagious
Situation; for it has neither
Rocks nor Fortifications near it, and yet
is, perhaps, the most impregnable Town
in <HI>Europe.</HI> It stands at least Four Miles
from any part of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> nor are
the Shallows that lye about it, ever
frozen hard enough to bring over an Ar∣my
from the Land-side. The constant
Flux and Reflux of the Sea, or the na∣tural
Mildness of the Climate, hindering
the Ice from gathering to any Thick∣ness;
which is an Advantage the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
want, when they have laid all
their Country under Water. On the
Side that is exposed to the Adriatic, the
Entrance is so difficult to hit, that they
have marked it out with several Stakes
driven into the Ground, which they
<PB N="62" REF="83"/>
would not fail to cut upon the first ap∣proach
of an Enemy's Fleet. For this
Reason they have not fortified the little
Islands, that lye at the Entrance, to the
best Advantage, which might otherwise
very easily command all the Passes that
lead to the City from the Adriatic. Nor
could an ordinary Fleet, with Bomb-Ves∣sels,
hope to succeed against a Place that
has always in its Arsenal a considerable
Number of Gallies and Men of War rea∣dy
to put to Sea on a very short warning.
If we could therefore suppose them block∣ed
up on all sides, by a Power too strong for
them, both by Sea and Land, they would
be able to defend themselves against every
thing but Famine; and this would not
be a little mitigated by the great Quan∣tities
of Fish that their Seas abound with,
and that may be taken up in the midst
of their very Streets, which is such a
natural Magazine as few other Places
can boast of.</P>
<P>Our Voyage-Writers will needs have
this City in great Danger of being left,
within an Age or two, on the <HI>Terra
Firma</HI>; and represent it in such a man∣ner,
as if the Sea was insensibly shrink∣ing
from it, and retiring into its Chan∣nel.
I asked several, and among the rest
Father <HI>Coronelli,</HI> the State's Geographer,
<PB N="63" REF="84"/>
of the Truth of this Particular, and they
all assured me that the Sea rises as high
as ever, tho' the great Heaps of Dirt
it brings along with it are apt to
choak up the Shallows, but that they
are in no Danger of losing the Benefit
of their Situation, so long as they are at
the Charge of removing these Banks of
Mud and Sand. One may see abun∣dance
of them above the Surface of the
Water, scattered up and down like so
many little Islands, when the Tide is
low; and they are these that make the
Entrance for Ships difficult to such as
are not used to them, for the deep Ca∣nals
run between them, which the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI>
are at a great Expence to keep
free and open.</P>
<P>This City stands very convenient for
Commerce. It has several Navigable
Rivers that run up into the Body of <HI>I∣taly,</HI>
by which they might supply a great
many Countries with Fish and other
Commodities; not to mention their Op∣portunities
for the <HI>Levant,</HI> and each side
of the Adriatic. But, notwithstanding
these Conveniencies, their Trade is far
from being in a flourishing Condition for
many Reasons. The Duties are great that
are laid on Merchandises. Their Nobles
think it below their Quality to engage
<PB N="64" REF="85"/>
in Traffick. The Merchants who are
grown Rich, and able to manage great
Dealings, buy their Nobility, and ge∣nerally
give over Trade. Their Manu∣factures
of Cloth, Glass and Silk, for∣merly
the best in <HI>Europe,</HI> are now ex∣celled
by those of other Countries. They
are tenacious of old Laws and Customs
to their great Prejudice, whereas a Tra∣ding
Nation must be still for new Chan∣ges
and Expedients, as different Jun∣ctures
and Emergencies arise. The State
is at present very sensible of this Decay
in their Trade, and as a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI>
who is still a Merchant, told me, they
will speedily find out some Method to
redress it; possibly by making a free
Port, for they look with an Evil Eye
upon <HI>Leghorne,</HI> which draws to it most of
the Vessels bound for <HI>Italy.</HI> They have
hitherto been so negligent in this Parti∣cular,
that many think the Great Duke's
Gold has had no small Influence in their
Councils.</P>
<P><HI>Venice</HI> has several Particulars which
are not to be found in other Cities, and
is therefore very entertaining to a Tra∣veller.
It looks, at a distance, like a great
Town half floated by a Deluge. There
are Canals every where crossing it, so
that one may go to most Houses either
<PB N="65" REF="86"/>
by Land or Water. This is a very great
Convenience to the Inhabitants; for a
<HI>Gondola</HI> with Two Oars at <HI>Venice,</HI> is as
magnificent as a Coach and Six Horses,
with a large Equipage, in another Coun∣try;
besides that it makes all Carriages
extreamly cheap. The Streets are gene∣rally
Paved with Brick or Free-stone,
and always kept very neat, for there is
no Carriage, not so much as a Chair,
that passes thro' them. There is an in∣numerable
Multitude of very handsome
Bridges, all of a single Arch, and with∣out
any Fence on either side, which
would be a great Inconvenience to a
City less sober than <HI>Venice.</HI> One would
indeed wonder that Drinking is so little
in Vogue among the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who are
in a moist Air and a moderate Climate,
and have no such Diversions as Bowling,
Hunting, Walking, Riding, and the
like Exercises to employ them without
Doors. But as the Nobles are not to
Converse too much with Strangers, they
are in no Danger of learning it; and
they are generally too distrustful of one
another for the Freedoms that are used
in such kind of Conversations. There
are many Noble Palaces in <HI>Venice.</HI> Their
Furniture is not commonly very Rich,
if we except the Pictures, which are
<PB N="66" REF="87"/>
here in greater plenty than in any other
Place in <HI>Europe,</HI> from the Hands of the
best Masters of the <HI>Lombard</HI> School; as
<HI>Titian, Paul Veronese</HI> and <HI>Tintoret.</HI> The
last of these is in greater Esteem at <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
than in other Parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> The
Rooms are generally hung with Gilt
Leather, which they cover on extraor∣dinary
Occasions with Tapestry, and
Hangings of greater Value. The Floor∣ing
is a kind of Red Plaister made of
Brick ground to Powder, and afterwards
work'd into Mortar. It is rubbed with
Oil, and makes a smooth, shining and
beautiful Surface. These Particularities
are chiefly owing to the Moisture of the
Air, which would have an ill Effect on
other kinds of Furniture, as it shows it
self too visibly in many of their finest
Pictures. Tho' the <HI>Venetians</HI> are ex∣treamly
jealous of any great Fame or
Merit in a living Member of their Com∣mon-wealth,
they never fail of giving a
Man his due Parises, when they are in
no Danger of suffering from his Ambi∣tion.
For this Reason, tho' there are a
great many Monuments erected to such
as have been Benefactors to the Repub∣lick,
they are generally put up after their
Deaths. Among the many Elogiums
that are given to the Doge <HI>Pisauro,</HI> who
<PB N="67" REF="88"/>
had been Ambassador in <HI>England,</HI> his E∣pitaph
says, <HI>In Angliâ Jacobi Regis obi∣tum
mirâ calliditate celatum mirâ sagacita∣te
rimatus priscam benevolentiam firmavit.</HI>
The particular Palaces, Churches, and
Pictures of <HI>Venice,</HI> are enumerated in se∣veral
little Books that may be bought on
the Place, and have been faithfully
Transcribed by many Voyage-Writers.
When I was at <HI>Venice,</HI> they were putting
out very curious Stamps of the several
Edifices which are most famous for their
Beauty or Magnificence. The <HI>Arsenal</HI>
of <HI>Venice</HI> is an Island of about three Miles
round. It contains all the Stores and
Provisions for War, that are not actu∣ally
employed. There are Docks for
their Gallies and Men of War, most of
them full, as well as Work-Houses for
all Land and Naval Preparations. That
Part of it, where the Arms are laid,
makes a great show, and was indeed very
extraordinary about a Hundred Years
ago, but at present a great part of its
Furniture is grown useless. There seem
to be almost as many Suits of Armour as
there are Guns. The Swords are old-fashion'd
and unwieldy in a very great
Number, and the Fire-Arms fitted with
Locks of little Convenience in compa∣rison
of those that are now in use. The
<PB N="68" REF="89"/>
<HI>Venetians</HI> pretend they could set out, in
Case of great Necessity, Thirty Men of
War, a Hundred Gallies, and Ten Ga∣leasses,
tho' I cannot conceive how they
could Man a Fleet of half the number.
It was certainly a mighty Error in this
State to affect so many Conquests on the
<HI>Terra Firma,</HI> which has only served to
raise the Jealousie of the Christian Prin∣ces,
and about Three Hundred Years
ago had like to have ended in the utter
Extirpation of the Common-wealth;
whereas, had they applyed themselves
with the same Politics and Industry to
the Increase of their Strength by Sea,
they might perhaps have had all the
Islands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> in their Hands,
and, by Consequence, the greatest Fleet,
and the most Sea-men of any other State
in <HI>Europe.</HI> Besides, that this would have
given no Jealousie to the Princes their
Neighbours, who would have enjoyed
their own Dominions in Peace, and
have been very well contented to have
seen so strong a Bulwark against all the
Forces and Invasions of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em∣pire.</P>
<P>This Republick has been much more
powerful than it is at present, as it is still
likelier to sink than increase in its Domini∣ons.
It is not impossible but the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="90"/>
may, some time or other, demand of them
<HI>Creme, Brescia,</HI> and <HI>Bergame,</HI> which have
been torn from the <HI>Milanese</HI>; and in case
a War should arise upon it, and the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI>
lose a single Battel, they might
be beaten off the Continent in a single
Summer, for their Fortifications are ve∣ry
Inconsiderable. On the other side,
the <HI>Venetians</HI> are in continual Apprehen∣sions
from the <HI>Turk,</HI> who will certainly
endeavour at the Recovery of the <HI>Mo∣rea,</HI>
as soon as the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire has
recruited a little of its antient Strength.
They are very sensible that they had
better have pushed their Conquests on
the other side of the Adriatick into <HI>Al∣bania,</HI>
for then their Territories would
have lain together, and have been nearer
the Fourtain-Head to have received Suc∣cours
on occasions; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> are
under Articles with the Emperor, to re∣sign
into his Hands whatever they con∣quer
of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, that has
been formerly dismembered from the
Empire. And having already very much
dissatisfied him in the <HI>Frioul</HI> and <HI>Dalma∣tia,</HI>
they dare not think of exasperating
him further. The Pope disputes with
them their Pretensions to the <HI>Polesin,</HI> as
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> lays an equal Claim
to the Kingdom of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> 'Tis surpri∣sing
<PB N="70" REF="91"/>
to consider with what Heats these
Two Powers have contested their Title
to a Kingdom that is in the Hands of
the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>Among all these Difficulties the Re∣publick
will still maintain it self, if Po∣licy
can prevail upon Force; for it is
certain the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate is one of
the wisest Councils in the World, tho'
at the same time, if we believe the Re∣ports
of several that have been well
versed in their Constitution, a great part
of their Politics is founded on Maxims
which others do not think consistent with
their Honour to put in practice. The
Preservation of the Republick is that to
which all other Considerations submit.
To encourage Idleness and Luxury in
the Nobility, to cherish Ignorance and
Licentiousness in the Clergy, to keep
alive a continual Faction in the Common
People, to connive at the Viciousness
and Debauchery of Convents, to breed
Dissensions among the Nobles of the
<HI>Terra Firma,</HI> to treat a brave Man with
Scorn and Infamy: In short, to stick at
nothing for the Publick Interest, are re∣presented
as the refined Parts of the <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
Wisdom.</P>
<P>Among all the Instances of their Po∣litics,
there is none more admirable than
<PB N="71" REF="92"/>
the great Secrecy that reigns in their
Public Councils. The Senate is gene∣rally
as numerous as our House of Com∣mons,
if we only reckon the sitting
Members, and yet carries its Resoluti∣ons
so privately, that they are seldom
known 'till they discover themselves in
the Execution. It is not many Years
since they had before them a great De∣bate
concerning the Punishment of one
of their Admirals, which lasted a Month
together, and concluded in his Condem∣nation;
yet was there none of his Friends,
nor of those who had engaged warmly
in his Defence, that gave him the least
Intimation of what was passing against
him, 'till he was actually seiz'd, and in
the Hands of Justice.</P>
<P>The Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> think themselves
equal at least to the Electors of the Em∣pire,
and but one Degree below Kings;
for which reason they seldom travel in∣to
Foreign Countries, where they must
undergo the Mortification of being treat∣ed
like private Gentlemen: Yet it is ob∣served
of them, that they discharge them∣selves
with a great deal of Dexterity in
such Embassies and Treaties as are laid
on them by the Republick; for their
whole Lives are employed in Intrigues
<PB N="72" REF="93"/>
of State, and they naturally give them∣selves
Airs of Kings and Princes, of
which the Ministers of other Nations
are only the Representatives. Monsieur
<HI>Amelot</HI> reckons in his Time, Two Thou∣sand
Five Hundred Nobles that had
Voices in the great Council, but at pre∣sent,
I am told, there are not at most
Fifteen Hundred, notwithstanding the
Addition of many new Families since
that time. It is very strange, that with
this Advantage they are not able to keep
up their Number, considering that the
Nobility spreads equally thro' all the
Brothers, and that so very few of them
are destroyed by the Wars of the Re∣publick.
Whether this may be imputed
to the Luxury of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> or to
the ordinary Celibacy of the younger Bro∣thers,
or to the last Plague which swept
away many of them, I know not. They
generally thrust the Females of their Fa∣milies
into Convents, the better to pre∣serve
their Estates. This makes the <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
Nuns famous for the Liberties they
allow themselves. They have Opera's
within their own Walls, and often go
out of their Bounds to meet their Ad∣mirers,
or they are very much misrepre∣sented.
They have many of them their
Lovers, that converse with them daily at
<PB N="73" REF="94"/>
the Grate, and are very free to admit a
Visit from a Stranger. There is indeed
one of the <HI>Cornara's,</HI> that not long ago
refused to see any under a Prince.</P>
<P>The Carnaval of <HI>Venice</HI> is every where
talked of. The great Diversion of the place
at that Time, as well as on all other high
Occasions, is Masking. The <HI>Venetians,</HI>
who are naturally Grave, love to give into
the Follies and Entertainments of such Sea∣sons,
when disguised in a false Personage.
They are indeed under a necessity of
finding out Diversions that may agree
with the Nature of the Place, and make
some Amends for the Loss of several Plea∣sures
which may be met with on the Con∣tinent.
These Disguises give Occasion
to abundance of Love Adventures; for
there is something more intriguing in the
Amours of <HI>Venice,</HI> than in those of other
Countries, and I question not but the
Secret History of a Carnaval would make
a Collection of very diverting Novels.
Opera's are another great Entertain∣ment
of this Season. The Poetry of them
is generally as exquisitely ill, as the
Musick is good. The Arguments are
often taken from some celebrated Action
of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> which
sometimes looks ridiculous enough; for
who can endure to hear one of the rough
<PB N="74" REF="95"/>
old <HI>Romans</HI> squeaking thro' the Mouth
of an Eunuch, especially when they may
chuse a Subject out of Courts where Eu∣nuchs
are really Actors, or represent by
them any of the soft <HI>Asiatic</HI> Monarchs?
The Opera that was most in Vogue,
during my Stay at <HI>Venice,</HI> was built on
the following Subject. <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI>
are Rivals for <HI>Cato</HI>'s Daughter. <HI>Cae∣sar</HI>'s
first Words bid his Soldiers fly, for
the Enemies are upon them. <HI>Si Leva
Cesare, e dice a Soldati. A la fugga. A'
lo Scampo.</HI> The Daughter gives the Pre∣ference
to <HI>Caesar,</HI> which is made the
Occasion of <HI>Cato</HI>'s Death. Before he
kills himself, you see him withdrawn in∣to
his Library, where, among his Books,
I observed the Titles of <HI>Plutarch</HI> and
<HI>Tasso.</HI> After a short Soliloquy he strikes
himself with the Dagger that he holds
in his Hand, but, being interrupted by
one of his Friends, he stabs him for his
Pains, and by the Violence of the Blow
unluckily breaks the Dagger on one of
his Ribs, so that he is forced to dispatch
himself by tearing up his first Wound.
This last Circumstance puts me in Mind
of a Contrivance in the Opera of St. <HI>An∣gelo,</HI>
that was acted at the same time.
The King of the Play endeavours at a
Rape, but the Poet being resolved to
<PB N="75" REF="96"/>
save his Heroine's Honour, has so or∣dered
it, that the King always acts with
a great Case-Knife stuck in his Girdle,
which the Lady snatches from him in
the Struggle, and so defends her self.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian</HI> Poets, besides the cele∣brated
Smoothness of their Tongue, have
a particular Advantage, above the Wri∣ters
of other Nations, in the difference
of their Poetical and Prose Language.
There are indeed Sets of Phrases that in
all Countries are peculiar to the Poets,
but among the <HI>Italians</HI> there are not only
Sentences, but a Multitude of particu∣lar
Words that never enter into common
Discourse. They have such a different
Turn and Polishing for Poetical Use, that
they drop several of their Letters, and
appear in another Form, when they
come to be ranged in Verse. For this
Reason the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera seldom sinks
into a Poorness of Language, but, a∣midst
all the Meanness and Familiarity
of the Thoughts, has something beau∣tiful
and sonorous in the Expression.
Without this natural Advantage of the
Tongue, their present Poetry would
appear wretchedly low and vulgar, not∣withstanding
the many strained Allego∣ries
that are so much in use among the
Writers of this Nation. The <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="97"/>
and <HI>French,</HI> who always use the same
Words in Verse as in ordinary Conver∣sation,
are forced to raise their Language
with Metaphors and Figures, or, by
the Pompousness of the whole Phrase,
to wear off any Littleness that appears
in the particular Parts that compose it.
This makes our Blank Verse, where
there is no Rhime to support the Ex∣pression,
extreamly difficult to such as
are not Masters in the Tongue, especi∣ally
when they write on low Subjects;
and 'tis probably for this Reason that
<HI>Milton</HI> has made use of such frequent
Transpositions, Latinisms, antiquated
Words and Phrases, that he might the
better deviate from vulgar and ordinary
Expressions.</P>
<P>The Comedies that I saw at <HI>Venice,</HI>
or indeed in any other Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> are
very indifferent, and more lewd than
those of other Countries. Their Poets
have no Notion of gentile Comedy, and
fall into the most filthy double Mean∣ings
imaginable, when they have a Mind
to make their Audience merry. There
is no Part generally so wretched as that
of the fine Gentleman, especially when
he Converses with his Mistress; for then
the whole Dialogue is an insipid mix∣ture
of Pedantry and Romance. But
<PB N="77" REF="98"/>
'tis no wonder that the Poets of so Jea∣lous
and Reserved a Nation fail in such
Conversations on the Stage, as they have
no Patterns of in Nature. There are
Four Standing Characters which enter
into every Piece that comes on the Stage,
the <HI>Doctor, Harlequin, Pantalone</HI> and <HI>Co∣viello.</HI>
The <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Character com∣prehends
the whole Extent of a Pedant,
that with a deep Voice, and a Magi∣sterial
Air breaks in upon Conversation,
and drives down all before him: Every
thing he says is backed with Quotati∣ons
out of <HI>Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Vir∣gil,</HI>
or any Author that rises uppermost,
aad all Answers from his Companion are
looked upon as Impertinencies or Inter∣ruptions.
<HI>Harlequin</HI>'s Part is made up
of Blunders and Absurdities: He is to
mistake one Name for another, to for∣get
his Errands, to stumble over Queens,
and to run his Head against every Post
that stands in his way. This is all at∣tended
with something so Comical in
the Voice and Gestures, that a Man,
who is sensible of the Folly of the Part,
can hardly forbear being pleased with it.
<HI>Pantalone</HI> is generally an old Cully, and
<HI>Coviello</HI> a Sharper.</P>
<P>I have seen a Translation of the <HI>Cid</HI>
acted at <HI>Bolonia,</HI> which would never
<PB N="78" REF="99"/>
have taken, had they not found a Place
in it for these Buffoons. All Four of
them appear in Masks that are made
like the old <HI>Roman Personae,</HI> as I shall
have occasion to observe in another
Place. The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> have
probably derived this Custom of shew∣ing
some of their Characters in Masks,
from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Theater. The
old <HI>Vatican Terence</HI> has at the Head of
every Scene the Figures of all the Per∣sons
that are concerned in it, with the
particular Disguises in which they acted;
and I remember to have seen in the <HI>Vil∣la
Mattheio</HI> an Antick Statue mask'd,
which was perhaps designed for <HI>Gnatho</HI>
in the Eunuch, for it agrees exactly
with the Figure he makes in the <HI>Vati∣can</HI>
Manuscript. One would wonder
indeed how so Polite a People, as the
ancient <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Athenians,</HI> should
not look on these borrowed Faces as un∣natural.
They might do very well for
a Cyclops, or a Satyr, that can have no
Resemblance in Human Features; but
for a Flatterer, a Miser, or the like Cha∣racters,
which abound in our own Spe∣cies,
nothing is more ridiculous than to
represent their Looks by a painted Vi∣zard.
In Persons of this Nature the
Turns and Motions of the Face are of∣ten
<PB N="79" REF="100"/>
as agreeable as any part of the Action.
Could we suppose that a Mask represent∣ed
never so naturally the general Hu∣mour
of a Character, it can never suit
with the Variety of Passions that are in∣cident
to every single Person in the whole
Course of a Play. The Grimace may
be proper on some Occasions, but is too
steady to agree with all. The Rabble
indeed are generally pleased at the first
Entry of a Disguise, but the Jest grows
cold even with them too when it comes
on the Stage in a Second Scene.</P>
<P>Since I am on this Subject, I cannot
forbear mentioning a Custom at <HI>Venice,</HI>
which they tell me is particular to the
common People of this Country, of sing∣ing
Stanza's out of <HI>Tasso.</HI> They are set
to a pretty Solemn Tune, and when one
begins in any part of the Poet, it is odds
but he will be answered by some Body
else that over-hears him: So that some∣times
you have Ten or a Dozen in the
Neighbourhood of one another, taking
Verse after Verse, and running on with
the Poem as far as their Memories will
carry them.</P>
<P>On Holy-<HI>Thursday,</HI> among the seve∣ral
Shows that are yearly exhibited, I
saw one that is odd enough, and parti∣cular
to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> There is a Set
<PB N="80" REF="101"/>
of Artisans, who by the help of several
Poles, which they lay across each others
Shoulders, build themselves up into a
kind of Pyramid; so that you see a
Pile of Men in the Air of Four or Five
Rows rising one above another. The
Weight is so equally distributed, that
every Man is very well able to bear his part
of it, the Stories, if I may so call them,
growing less and less as they advance high∣er
and higher. A little Boy represents the
Point of the Pyramid, who, after a
short space, leaps off, with a great deal
of Dexterity, into the Arms of one that
catches him at the Bottom. In the same
manner the whole Building falls to pie∣ces.
I have been the more particular on
this, because it explains the following
Verses of <HI>Claudian,</HI> which show that the
<HI>Venetians</HI> are not the Inventors of this
Trick.<Q><L>Vel qui mere avium sese jaculantur in auras,</L>
<L>Corporaque aedificant, celeri crescentia nexu,</L>
<L>Quorum compositam puer augmentatus in

Show.</L></Q></P>
<P>Tho' we meet with the <HI>Veneti</HI> in the

to find a Place among them. <HI>San∣nazarius</HI>'s

this City in Two other Places

the very Reason why the <HI>Danube</HI> is

that which really makes the <HI>Po</HI> as great

<P>Accordingly the old Geographers re∣present
it as situated among Marshes and
Shallows. The Place which is shown
for the Haven, is on a Level with the
Town, and has probably been stopped
up by the great Heaps of Dirt that the Sea
has thrown into it; for all the Soil on
that side of <HI>Ravenna</HI> has been left there
insensibly by the Sea's discharging it self
upon it for so many Ages. The Ground
must have been formerly much lower,
for otherwise the Town would have
lain under Water. The Remains of the
<HI>Pharos,</HI> that stand about Three Miles
from the Sea, and Two from the Town,
have their Foundations covered with
Earth for some Yards, as they told me,
<PB N="90" REF="111"/>
which notwithstanding are upon a Level
with the Fields that lye about them,
tho' 'tis probable they took the Advan∣tage
of a rising Ground to set it upon.
It was a square Tower of about Twelve
Yards in Breadth, as appears by that
part of it which yet remains entire, so
that its Height must have been very con∣siderable
to have preserved a Proportion.
It is made in the Form of the <HI>Venetian
Campanello,</HI> and is probably the high
Tower mentioned by <HI>Pliny, Lib.</HI> 36.
<HI>cap.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>On the side of the Town, where the
Sea is supposed to have lain formerly,
there is now a little Church called the
<HI>Rotonda.</HI> At the Entrance of it are Two
Stones, the one with an Inscription in
<HI>Gothic</HI> Characters, that has nothing in
it remarkable; the other is a square
Piece of Marble, that by the Inscription
appears ancient, and by the Ornaments
about it shows it self to have been a lit∣tle
Pagan Monument of Two Persons
who were Shipwreck'd, perhaps in the
Place where now their Monument stands.
The first Line and a half, that tells their
Names and Families in Prose, is not le∣gible;
the rest runs thus,<Q><L>—Raniae domus hos produxit alumnos,</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="112"/>
Libertatis opus contulit una Dies.</L>
<L>Naufraga mors pariter rapuit quos junxe∣rat
antè,</L>
<L>Et duplices luctus mors periniqua dedit.</L><LG>
<L>Both with the same Indulgent Master
bless'd,</L>
<L>On the same Day their Liberty possess'd:</L>
<L>A Shipwreck slew whom it had join'd
before,</L>
<L>And left their common Friends their
Fun'rals to deplore.</L>
</LG></Q>

</P>
<P>There is a Turn in the Third Verse
that we lose, by not knowing the Cir∣cumstances
of their Story. It was the
<HI>Naufraga mors</HI> which destroyed them,
as it had formerly united them; what
this Union was is expressed in the pre∣ceding
Verse, by their both having been
made Free-men on the same Day. If
therefore we suppose they had been for∣merly
Shipwreck'd with their Master,
and that he made them Free at the same
time, the <HI>Epigram</HI> is unriddled. Nor is
this Interpretation perhaps so forc'd as
it may seem at first sight, since it was
the Custom of the Masters, a little be∣fore
their Death, to give their Slaves
their Freedom, if they had deserv'd it at
their Hands; and it is natural enough
<PB N="92" REF="113"/>
to suppose one, involved in a common
Shipwreck, would give such of his Slaves
their Liberty, as should have the good
Luck to save themselves. The Chancel
of this Church is vaulted with a single
Stone of Four Foot in Thickness, and
a Hundred and Fourteen in Circumfe∣rence.
There stood on the Outside of
this little Cupola a great Tomb of <HI>Por∣phyry,</HI>
and the Statues of the Twelve A∣postles;
but in the War that <HI>Louis</HI> the
Twelfth made on <HI>Italy,</HI> the Tomb was
broken in pieces by a Cannon-Ball.
It was, perhaps, the same Blow that
made the Flaw in the Cupola, tho' the
Inhabitants say it was crack'd by Thun∣der,
that destroyed a Son of one of their
<HI>Gothic</HI> Princes, who had taken Shelter
under it, as having been foretold what
kind of Death he was to die. I asked an
Abbot, that was in the Church, what
was the Name of this <HI>Gothic</HI> Prince, who,
after a little Recollection, answered me,
That he could not tell precisely, but
that he thought it was one <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI>
There is a Convent of <HI>Theatins,</HI> where
they show a little Window in the
Church, thro' which the Holy Ghost
is said to have entered in the Shape of
a Dove, and to have settled on one of
the Candidates for the Bishoprick. The
<PB N="93" REF="114"/>
Dove is represented in the Window, and
in several Places of the Church, and is
in great Reputation all over <HI>Italy.</HI> I should
not indeed think it impossible for a Pi∣geon
to fly in accidentally thro' the Roof,
where they still keep the Hole open,
and by its fluttering over such a parti∣cular
Place, to give so superstitious
an Assembly an Occasion of favouring a
Competitor, especially if he had many
Friends among the Electors that would
make a politick Use of such an Acci∣dent:
But they pretend the Miracle has
happened more than once. Among the
Pictures of several famous Men of their
Order, there is one with this Inscripti∣on.

The Statue of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Se∣venth
stands in the large Square of the
Town; it is cast in Brass, and has the
Posture that is always given the Figure
of a Pope; an Arm extended, and bles∣sing
the People. In another Square on
a high Pillar is set the Statue of the bles∣sed
Virgin, arrayed like a Queen, with
a Scepter in her Hand, and a Crown up∣on
her Head; for having delivered the
Town from a raging Pestilence. The
Custom of Crowning the Holy Virgin
<PB N="94" REF="115"/>
is so much in Vogue among the <HI>Itali∣ans,</HI>
that one often sees in their Churches
a little Tinsel Crown, or perhaps a Cir∣cle
of Stars glew'd to the Canvas over
the Head of the Figure, which some∣times
spoils a good Picture. In the Con∣vent

<HI>Ravenna</HI> I came to <HI>Rimini,</HI> having pas∣sed
the <HI>Rubicon</HI> by the way. This Ri∣ver
is not so very contemptible as it is

by the melting of the Snows

<P><HI>Rimini</HI> has nothing modern to boast of.
Its Antiquities are as follow: A Marble

and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> for the Inscription is still
legible, tho' not rightly transcrib'd by
<HI>Gruter.</HI> A Triumphal Arch raised by <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
which makes a Noble Gate to the
Town, tho' part of it is ruined. The
Ruins of an Amphitheater. The <HI>Sug∣gestum,</HI>
on which it is said that <HI>Julius
Caesar</HI> harangued his Army after having
passed the <HI>Rubicon.</HI> I must confess I can
by no means look on this last as Authen∣tick:
It is built of hewn Stone, like the
Pedestal of a Pillar, but something high∣er
than ordinary, and is but just broad
enough for one Man to stand upon it.
On the contrary, the ancient <HI>Sugge∣stums,</HI>
as I have often observed on Me∣dals,
<PB N="96" REF="117"/>
as well as on <HI>Constantine</HI>'s Arch,
were made of Wood like a little kind of
Stage, for the Heads of the Nails are
sometimes represented, that are supposed
to have fastened the Boards together. We
often see on them the Emperor, and
Two or Three General Officers, some∣times
sitting and sometimes standing, as
they made Speeches, or distributed a
Congiary to the Soldiers or People.
They were probably always in readiness,
and carried among the Baggage of the
Army, whereas this at <HI>Rimini</HI> must have
been built on the Place, and required
some time before it could be finished.</P>

<P>If the Observation I have here made
is just, it may serve as a Confirmation
to the Learned <HI>Fabretti</HI>'s Conjecture on
<HI>Trajan</HI>'s Pillar; who supposes, I think,
with a great deal of Reason, that the
Camps, Intrenchments, and other Works
<PB N="98" REF="119"/>
of the same Nature, which are cut out
as if they had been made of Brick or
hewn Stone, were in reality only of
Earth, Turf, or the like Materials; for
there are on the Pillar some of those <HI>Sugge∣stums</HI>
which are figured like those on Me∣dals,
with only this difference, that they
seem built of Brick or Free-Stone. At
Twelve Miles distance from <HI>Rimini</HI> stands
the little Republick of St. <HI>Marino,</HI> which
I could not forbear visiting, tho' it lyes
out of the common Tour of Travellers,
and has excessively bad Ways to it. I
shall here give a particular Account of
it, because I know of no Body else that
as done it. One may, at least, have
the Pleasure of seeing in it something
more singular than can be found in great
Governments, and form from it an Idea
of <HI>Venico</HI> in its first Beginnings, when it
had only a few Heaps of Earth for its
Dominions, or of <HI>Rome</HI> it self, when it
had as yet cover'd but one of its Seven
Hills.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>THE
REPUBLICK
OF
St. MARINO.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Town and Republick of
St. <HI>Marino</HI> stands on the Top
of a very high and craggy
Mountain. It is generally
hid among the Clouds, and
lay under Snow when I saw it, tho' it
was clear and warm Weather in all the
Country about it. There is not a Spring
or Fountain, that I could hear of, in the
whole Dominions, but they are always
well provided with huge Cisterns and
Reservoirs of Rain and Snow-Water.
The Wine that grows on the sides of
their Mountain is extraordinary good,
and I think much better than any I met
with on the cold side of the <HI>Appenines.</HI>
This puts me in Mind of their Cellars,
which have most of 'em a natural Ad∣vantage
that renders 'em extreamly cool
<PB N="100" REF="121"/>
in the hottest Seasons, for they have ge∣nerally
in the Sides of them deep Holes
that run into the Hollows of the Hill,
from whence there constantly issues a
breathing kind of Vapour, so very chil∣ling
in the Summer time, that a Man
can scarce suffer his Hand in the Wind of
it.</P>
<P>This Mountain, and a few neighbour∣ing
Hillocks that lye scatter'd about the
Bottom of it, is the whole Circuit of
these Dominions. They have, what
they call, Three Castles, Three Convents,
and Five Churches, and can reckon about
Five Thousand Souls in their Communi∣ty.
The Inhabitants as well as the Histori∣ans,
who mention this little Republick,
give the following Account of its Original.
St. <HI>Marino</HI> was its Founder, a <HI>Dalmatian</HI>
by Birth, and by Trade a Mason. He
was employed above Thirteen Hundred
Years ago in the Reparation of <HI>Rimini,</HI>
and, after he had finish'd his Work,
retired to this solitary Mountain, as find∣ing
it very proper for the Life of a Her∣mit,
which he led in the greatest Ri∣gours
and Austerities of Religion. He
had not been long here before he wrought
a reputed Miracle, which, join'd with
his extraordinary Sanctity, gained him
so great an Esteem, that the Princess of
<PB N="101" REF="122"/>
the Country made him a Present of the
Mountain to dispose of it at his own Di∣scretion.
His Reputation quickly Peo∣pled
it, and gave Rise to the Republick
which calls it self after his Name. So that
the Common-wealth of <HI>Marino</HI> may boast
at least of a nobler Original than that of
<HI>Rome,</HI> the one having been at first an
<HI>Asylum</HI> for Robbers and Murderers, and
the other a Resort of Persons eminent for
their Piety and Devotion. The best of
their Churches is Dedicated to the Saint,
and holds his Ashes. His Statue stands
over the high Altar, with the Figure of
a Mountain in its Hands, crown'd with
Three Castles, which is likewise the
Arms of the Common-wealth. They at∣tribute
to his Protection the long Dura∣tion
of their State, and look on him as
the greatest Saint next the Blessed Virgin.
I saw in their Statute-Book a Law a∣gainst
such as speak disrespectfully of him,
who are to be punished in the same man∣ner
as those who are Convicted of Blas∣phemy.</P>
<P>This petty Republick has now lasted
Thirteen hundred Years, while all the
other States of <HI>Italy</HI> have several times
changed their Masters and Forms of Go∣vernment.
Their whole History is com∣pris'd
in Two Purchases, which they
<PB N="102" REF="123"/>
made of a neighbouring Prince, and in
a War in which they assisted the Pope
against a Lord of <HI>Rimini.</HI> In the Year
1100 they bought a Castle in the Neigh∣bourhood,
as they did another in the
Year 1170. The Papers of the Condi∣tions
are preserv'd in their Archives,
where 'tis very remarkable that the
Name of the Agent for the Common-wealth,
of the Seller, of the Notary,
and the Witnesses, are the same in both
the Instruments, tho' drawn up at Seven∣ty
Years distance from each other. Nor
can it be any Mistake in the Date, be∣cause
the Popes and Emperors Names,
with the Year of their respective Reigns,
are both punctually set down. About
290 Years after this they assisted Pope
<HI>Pius</HI> the Second against one of the <HI>Ma∣latesta's,</HI>
who was then Lord of <HI>Rimini</HI>;
and when they had helped to conquer
him, received from the Pope, as a Re∣ward
for their Assistance, Four little Ca∣stles.
This they represent as the flou∣rishing
Time of the Common-wealth,
when their Dominions reach'd half way
up a neighbouring Hill; but at present
they are reduced to their old Extent.
They would probably sell their Liberty
as dear as they could to any that attacked
them; for there is but one Road by
<PB N="103" REF="124"/>
which to climb up to them, and they
have a very severe Law against any of
their own Body that enters the Town
by another Path, lest any new one
should be worn on the Sides of their
Mountain. All that are capable of bear∣ing
Arms are exercis'd, and ready at a
Moment's Call.</P>
<P>The Sovereign Power of the Repub∣lick
was lodg'd originally in what they
call the <HI>Arengo,</HI> a great Council in which
every House had its Representative. But
because they found too much Confusion
in such a Multitude of Statesmen, they
devolv'd their whole Authority into the
Hands of the Council of Sixty. The
<HI>Arengo</HI> however is still called together
in Cases of extraordinary Importance;
and if, after due Summons, any Mem∣ber
absents himself, he is to be Fin'd to
the value of about a Penny <HI>English,</HI> which
the Statute says he shall pay, <HI>Sine ali∣quâ
diminutione aut gratiâ.</HI> In the ordi∣nary
Course of Government, the Coun∣cil
of Sixty (which, notwithstanding
the Name; consists but of Forty Persons)
has in its Hands the Administration of
Affairs, and is made up half out of the
Noble Families, and half out of the
<HI>Plebeian.</HI> They decide all by Baloting,
are not admitted 'till Five and Twenty
<PB N="104" REF="125"/>
Years old, and chuse the Officers of the
Common-wealth.</P>
<P>Thus far they agree with the Great
Council of <HI>Venice,</HI> but their Power is
much more extended; for no Sentence
can stand that is not confirmed by Two
Thirds of this Council. Besides, that
no Son can be admitted into it during
the Life of his Father, nor Two be in it of
the same Family, nor any enter but by E∣lection.
The chief Officers of the Com∣mon-wealth
are the Two <HI>Capitaneos,</HI> who
have such a Power as the old <HI>Roman</HI> Con∣suls
had, but are chosen every Six Months.
I talk'd with some that had been <HI>Capi∣taneos</HI>
Six or Seven times, tho' the Office
is never to be continu'd to the same Per∣sons
twice successively. The Third Of∣ficer
is the Commissary, who judges in
all Civil and Criminal Matters. But be∣cause
the many Alliances, Friendships,
and Intermarriages, as well as the Per∣sonal
Feuds and Animosities that happen
among so small a People might obstruct
the Course of Justice, if one of their
own Number had the Distribution of it;
they have always a Foreigner for this Em∣ploy,
whom they chuse for Three Years,
and maintain out of the Publick Stock.
He must be a Doctor of Law, and a
Man of known Integrity. He is join'd
<PB N="105" REF="126"/>
in Commission with the <HI>Capitaneos,</HI> and
acts something like the Recorder of
<HI>London</HI> under the Lord Mayor. The
Common-wealth of <HI>Genoa</HI> was forc'd to
make use of a foreign Judge for many
Years, whilst their Republick was torn
into the Divisions of <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibe∣lines.</HI>
The Fourth Man in the State is
the Physician, who must likewise be a
Stranger, and is maintain'd by a publick
Salary. He is oblig'd to keep a Horse,
to visit the Sick, and to inspect all
Drugs that are imported. He must be
at least Thirty Five Years old, a Do∣ctor
of the Faculty, and eminent for
his Religion and Honesty; that his Rash∣ness
or Ignorance may not unpeople the
Common-wealth. And that they may
not suffer long under any bad Choice, he
is elected only for Three Years. The
present Physician is a very understand∣ing
Man, and well read in our Country∣men,
<HI>Harvey, Willis, Sydenham,</HI> &amp;c.
He has been continu'd for some time
among 'em, and they say the Common-wealth
thrives under his Hands. Ano∣ther
Person, who makes no ordinary Fi∣gure
in the Republick, is the School-Master.
I scarce met with any in the
Place that had not some Tincture of
Learning. I had the Perusal of a <HI>La∣tin</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="127"/>
Book in <HI>Folio,</HI> Entituled, <HI>Statuta Il∣lustrissimae
Reipublicae Sancti Marini,</HI> Print∣ed
at <HI>Rimini</HI> by Order of the Common-wealth.
The Chapter on the publick
Ministers says, that when an Ambassa∣dor
is dispatch'd from the Republick to
any Foreign State he shall be allow'd,
out of the Treasury, to the Value of a
Shilling a Day. The People are esteem'd
very honest and rigorous in the Execu∣tion
of Justice, and seem to live more
happy and contented among their Rocks
and Snows, than others of the <HI>Italians</HI>
do in the pleasantest Vallies of the
World. Nothing indeed can be a
greater Instance of the natural Love
that Mankind has for Liberty, and of
their Aversion to an Arbitrary Govern∣ment,
than such a Savage Mountain co∣ver'd
with People, and the <HI>Campania</HI> of
<HI>Rome,</HI> which lyes in the same Country,
almost destitute of Inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia,

To ROME.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>ROM <HI>Rimini</HI> to <HI>Loretto</HI> the
Towns of Note are <HI>Pesaro,</HI>
<HI>Fano, Senigallia</HI> and <HI>Ancona.
Fano</HI> received its Name from
the Fane or Temple of For∣tune
that stood in it. One may still see
the Triumphal Arch erected there to
<HI>Augustus</HI>: It is indeed very much de∣fac'd
by Time, but the Plan of it, as it
stood entire with all its Inscriptions, is
neatly cut upon the Wall of a neigh∣bouring
Building. In each of these
Towns is a beautiful Marble Fountain,
where the Water runs continually thro'
several little Spouts, which looks very
refreshing in these hot Countries, and
gives a great Coolness to the Air about
them. That of <HI>Pesaro</HI> is handsomly de∣signed.
<HI>Ancona</HI> is much the most con∣siderable
<PB N="108" REF="129"/>
of these Towns. It stands on
a Promontory, and looks more beauti∣ful
at a distance than when you are in
it. The Port was made by <HI>Trajan,</HI>
for which he has a Triumphal Arch e∣rected
to him by the Sea-side. The
Marble of this Arch looks very white
and fresh, as being exposed to the Winds
and Salt Sea-Vapours, that by continu∣ally
fretting it preseves it self from that
mouldy Colour, which others of the
same Materials have contracted. Tho'
the <HI>Italians</HI> and Voyage-Writers call
these of <HI>Rimini, Fano,</HI> and <HI>Ancona</HI> Tri∣umphal
Arches, there was probably
some Distinction made among the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
between such Honorary Arches e∣rected
to Emperors, and those that
were rais'd to them on the Account of
a Victory, which are properly Trium∣phal
Arches. This at <HI>Ancona</HI> was an In∣stance
of Gratitude to <HI>Trajan</HI> for the
Port he had made there, as the two o∣thers
I have mention'd were probably
for some Reason of the same Nature.
One may however observe the Wisdom
of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> who to encou∣rage
their Emperors in their Inclina∣tion
of doing good to their Coun∣try,
gave the same Honours to the great
Actions of Peace, which turn'd to the
<PB N="109" REF="130"/>
Advantage of the Publick, as to those
of War. This is very remarkable in the
Medals that were stamp'd on the same
Occasions. I remember to have seen
one of <HI>Galba</HI>'s with a Triumphal Arch
on the Reverse, that was made by the
Senate's Order for his having remitted
a Tax. <HI>R. XXXX. REMISSA. S. C.</HI>
The Medal which was made for <HI>Trajan</HI>
in Remembrance of his Benificence to
<HI>Ancona</HI> is very common. The Reverse
has on it a Port with a Chain running
a-cross it, and betwixt them both a Boat

<P>I know <HI>Fabretti</HI> would fain ascribe this
Medal to another Occasion, but <HI>Bellorio,</HI> in
his Additions to <HI>Angeloni,</HI> has sufficiently
refuted all he says on that Subject.</P>
<P>At <HI>Loretto</HI> I enquir'd for the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Jesuits Lodgings, and on the
Stair-Case that leads to 'em I saw seve∣ral
Pictures of such as had been Execu∣ted
in <HI>England,</HI> as the Two <HI>Garnets, Old-Corn,</HI>
and others to the Number of
Thirty. Whatever were their Crimes,
the Inscription says they suffer'd for their
Religion, and some of 'em are represent∣ed
lying under such Tortures as are not
in use among us. The Martyrs of 1679
are set by themselves, with a Knife
stuck in the Bosom of each Figure, to
signify that they were Quarter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="132"/>
The Riches in the Holy House and
Treasury are surprizingly great, and as
much surpass'd my Expectation as other
Sights have generally fallen short of it.
Silver can scarce find an Admission, and
Gold it self looks but poorly among such
an incredible number of precious Stones.
There will be, in a few Ages more, the
Jewels of the greatest Value in <HI>Europe,</HI>
if the Devotion of its Princes continues
in its present Fervour. The last Offer∣ing
was made by the Queen Dowager
of <HI>Poland,</HI> and cost her 18000 Crowns.
Some have wonder'd that the <HI>Turk</HI> ne∣ver
attacks this Treasury, since it lyes
so near the Sea-shore, and is so weakly
guarded. But besides that he has at∣tempted
it formerly with no Success, it
is certain the <HI>Venetians</HI> keep too watch∣ful
an Eye over his Motions at present,
and would never suffer him to enter the
Adriatic. It would indeed be an easie
thing for a Christian Prince to surprize
it, who has Ships still passing to and fro
without Suspicion, especially if he had
a Party in the Town, disguis'd like Pil∣grims,
to secure a Gate for him; for
there have been sometimes to the Num∣ber
of 100000 in a Day's time, as it is
generally reported. But 'tis probable
the Veneration for the Holy House, and
<PB N="112" REF="133"/>
the Horror of an Action that would be
resented by all the Catholick Princes of
<HI>Europe,</HI> will be as great a Security to the
Place as the strongest Fortification. It
is indeed an amazing thing to see such a
prodigious Quantity of Riches lye dead,
and untouch'd in the midst of so much
Poverty and Misery as reign on all sides
of 'em. There is no question, how∣ever,
but the Pope would make use of
these Treasures in case of any great Cala∣mity
that should endanger the Holy See;
as an unfortunate War with the <HI>Turk,</HI> or a
powerful League among the Protestants.
For I can't but look on those vast Heaps
of Wealth, that are amass'd together in
so many Religious Places of <HI>Italy,</HI> as the
hidden Reserves and Magazines of the
Church, that she would open on any
pressing Occasion for her last Defence
and Preservation. If these Riches were
all turn'd into current Coin, and em∣ploy'd
in Commerce, they would make
<HI>Italy</HI> the most flourishing Country in
<HI>Europe.</HI> The Case of the Holy House
is nobly design'd, and executed by the
great Masters of <HI>Italy,</HI> that flourish'd
about a hundred Years ago. The Sta∣tues
of the <HI>Sibyls</HI> are very finely wrought,
each of 'em in a different Air and Po∣sture,
as are likewise those of the Pro∣phets
<PB N="113" REF="134"/>
underneath 'em. The Roof of
the Treasury is painted with the same
kind of Device. There stands at the up∣per
End of it a large Crucifix very much
esteem'd, the Figure of our Saviour re∣presents
him in his last Agonies of Death,
and amidst all the Ghastliness of the Vi∣sage
has something in it very amiable.
The Gates of the Church are said to be
of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Brass, with many Scripture
Stories rising on 'em in <HI>Basso Relievo.</HI>
The Pope's Statue, and the Fountain
by it, would make a noble Show in a
Place less beautified with so many other
Productions of Art. The Spicery, the
Cellar and its Furniture, the great Re∣venues
of the Convent, with the Story
of the Holy House, are too well known
to be here insisted upon.</P>
<P>Whoever were the first Inventors of
this Imposture, they seem to have taken
the hint of it from the Veneration that
the old <HI>Romans</HI> paid to the Cottage of
<HI>Romulus,</HI> which stood on Mount <HI>Capitol,</HI>
and was repair'd from time to time as
it fell to decay. <HI>Virgil</HI> has given a pret∣ty
Image of this little thatch'd Palace,
that represents it standing in <HI>Manlius</HI>'s
Time, 327 Years after the Death of
<HI>Romulus.</HI><Q><PB N="114" REF="135"/>

<P>From <HI>Loretto,</HI> in my way to <HI>Rome,</HI> I
pass'd thro' <HI>Recanati, Macorata, Tolenti∣no</HI>
and <HI>Foligni.</HI> In the last there is a
Convent of Nuns call'd <HI>la Contessa,</HI> that
has in the Church an incomparable <HI>Ma∣donna</HI>
of <HI>Raphel.</HI> At <HI>Spoletto,</HI> the next
Town on the Road, are some Antiqui∣ties.
The most remarkable is an Aquae∣duct
of a <HI>Gothic</HI> Structure, that conveys
the Water from Mount St. <HI>Francis</HI> to
<HI>Spoletto,</HI> which is not to be equall'd for
its height by any other in <HI>Europe.</HI> They
reckon from the Foundation of the low∣est
Arch to the Top of it 230 Yards.
In my way hence to <HI>Terni</HI> I saw the
River <HI>Clitumnus,</HI> celebrated by so many
of the Poets for a particular Quality in
its Waters of making Cattle white that
<PB N="115" REF="136"/>
drink of it. The Inhabitants of that
Country have still the same Opinion of
it, as I found upon Enquiry, and have
a great many Oxen of a whitish Colour
to confirm 'em in it. It is probable this
Breed was first settled in the Country,
and continuing still the same Species,
has made the Inhabitants impute it to a
wrong Cause; tho' they may as well
fancy their Hogs turn black for some
Reason of the same Nature, because there
are none in <HI>Italy</HI> of any other Breed.
The River <HI>Clitumnus,</HI> and <HI>Mevania</HI> that
stood on the Banks of it, are famous for
the Herds of Victims with which they
furnish'd all <HI>Italy.</HI><Q><L>Qua formosa suo Clitumnus flumina luco</L>

<P><HI>Terni</HI> is the next Town in Course,
formerly call'd <HI>Interamna,</HI> for the same
Reason that a part of <HI>Asia</HI> was nam'd
<HI>Mesopotamia.</HI> We enter at the Gate of
the Three Monuments, so call'd because
there stood near in a Monument erected
to <HI>Tacitus</HI> the Historian, with two others
to the Emperors <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Florianus,</HI> all
of them Natives of the Place. These
were a few Years ago Demolish'd by
Thunder, and the Fragments of them are
in the Hands of some Gentlemen of the
Town. Near the Dome I was shown a
square Marble, inserted in the Wall,
with the following Inscription.<Q><L>Saluti perpetuae Augustae</L>
<L>Libertatique Publicae Populi Romani</L><BIBL>Genio municipi Anno post Interamnam Conditam.
D. CC. IV.</BIBL>

<L>Ad Cnejum Domitium</L><L>Ahenobarbum.—</L><BIBL>Coss. providentiae Ti. Caesaris <PB N="118" REF="139"/>Augusti nati ad Aeternitatem Romani nomi∣nis

F. C. <HI>that is,</HI> pecunia sua fieri curavit.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This Stone was probably set up on
occasion of the Fall of <HI>Sejanus.</HI> After
the Name of <HI>Ahenobarbus</HI> there is a little
Furrow in the Marble, but so smooth
and well polish'd, that I should not have
taken notice of it had not I seen <HI>Coss.</HI>
at the end of it, by which it is plain
there was once the Name of another
Consul, which has been industriously
razed out. <HI>Lucias Aruncius Camillus
Scribonianus</HI> was Consul under the Reign
of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fast. Consul. Sicul.</NOTE> <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and was afterwards put to
Death for a Conspiracy that he had
form'd against the Emperor <HI>Claudius</HI>;
at which time it was order'd that his
Name and Consulate should be effaced
out of all publick Registers and Inscrip∣tions.
It is not therefore improbable,
that it was this long Name which fill'd
up the Gap I am now mentioning.
There are near this Monument the Ru∣ins
of an ancient Theatre, with some of
the Caves entire. I saw among the Ru∣ins
<PB N="119" REF="140"/>
an old Heathen Altar, with this Par∣ticularity
in it, that it is hollow'd, like
a Dish, at one End; but it was not this
End on which the Sacrifice was laid,
as one may guess from the Make of the
Festoon, that runs round the Altar,
and is inverted when the Hollow
stands uppermost. In the same Yard,
among the Rubbish of the Theatre, lye
Two Pillars, the one of Granate, and
the other of a very beautiful Marble.
I went out of my way to see the Famous
<HI>Cascade</HI> about Three Miles from <HI>Terni.</HI>
It it form'd by the Fall of the River
<HI>Velino,</HI> which <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions in the
Seventh <HI>Aeneid—Rosed rura Velini.</HI></P>
<P>The Channel of this River lyes very
high, and is shaded on all sides by a Green
Forest, made up of several kinds of Trees
that preserve their Verdure all the Year.
The neighbouring Mountains are co∣ver'd
with them, and by reason of their
height are more expos'd to the Dews and
drizzling Rains than any of the adjacent
Parts, which gives occasion to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Ro∣sea
rura,</HI> (Dewy Countries.) The River
runs extreamly rapid before its Fall, and
rushes down a Precipice of a Hundred
Yards high. It throws it self into the Hol∣low
of a Rock, which has probably been
<PB N="120" REF="141"/>
worn by such a constant Fall of Water.
It is impossible to see the Bottom on
which it breaks for the Thickness of the
Mist that rises from it, which looks at
a Distance like Clouds of Smoak as∣cending
from some vast Furnace, and
distils in perpetual Rains on all the Pla∣ces
that lye near it. I think there is
something more astonishing in this <HI>Cas∣cade,</HI>
than in all the Water-Works of
<HI>Versailles,</HI> and could not but wonder
when I first saw it, that I had never
met with it in any of the old Poets,
especially in <HI>Claudian,</HI> who makes his
Emperor <HI>Honorius.</HI> go out of his way to
see the River <HI>Nar</HI> which runs just be∣low
it, and yet does not mention what
would have been so great an Embellish∣ment
to his Poem. But at present I don't
in the least question, notwithstanding
the Opinion of some Learned Men to
the contrary, that this is the Gulf thro'
which <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Alecto</HI> shoots her self into
Hell: for the very Place, the great Re∣putation
of it, the Fall of Waters, the
Woods that encompass it, with the
Smoak and Noise that arise from it,
are all pointed at in the Description. Per∣haps
he would not mention the Name
of the River, because he has done it in
the Verses that precede. We may add
<PB N="121" REF="142"/>
to this, that the <HI>Cascade</HI> is not far off
that part of <HI>Italy</HI> which has been call'd
<HI>Italiae Meditullium.</HI><Q><L>Est locus Italiae medio, sub montibus altis,</L>

<P>It was indeed the most proper Place in
the World for a Fury to make her <HI>Exit,</HI>
after she had fill'd a Nation with Di∣stractions
and Alarms; and I believe e∣very
Reader's Imagination is pleas'd,
when he sees the angry Goddess thus
sinking, as it were, in a Tempest, and
plunging herself into Hell, amidst such
a Scene of Horror and Confusion.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Velino,</HI> after having found
its way out from among the Rocks
where it falls, runs into the <HI>Nera.</HI> The
Channel of this last River is white with
Rocks, and the Surface of it, for a long
Space, cover'd with Froth and Bubbles;
for it runs all along upon the Fret, and
is still breaking against the Stones that
oppose its Passage: So that for these
Reasons, as well as for the Mixture of
Sulphur in its Waters, it is very well de∣scrib'd
by <HI>Virgil,</HI> in that Verse which
mentions these Two Rivers in their old
<HI>Roman</HI> Names.<Q><PB N="123" REF="144"/>

From this River our next Town on the
Road receives the Name of <HI>Narni.</HI> I
saw hereabouts nothing remarkable ex∣cept
<HI>Augustus</HI>'s Bridge, that stands half
a Mile from the Town, and is one of
the stateliest Ruins in <HI>Italy.</HI> It has no
Cement, and looks as firm as one entire
Stone. There is an Arch of it unbro∣ken,
the broadest that I have ever seen,
tho' by reason of its great height it does
not appear so. The middle one was still
much broader. They join together
Two Mountains, and belong'd, without
doubt, to the Bridge that <HI>Martial</HI> men∣tions,
tho' Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> takes 'em to be the
Remains of an ancient Aquaeduct.<Q><L>Sed jam parce mihi, nec abutere Narnia

<L>So, <HI>Narni,</HI> may thy Bridge for ever

<P>From <HI>Narni</HI> I went to <HI>Otricoli,</HI> a very
mean little Village, that stands where
the Castle of <HI>Ocriculum</HI> did formerly. I
turn'd about half a Mile out of the Road
to see the Ruins of the old <HI>Ocriculum,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="146"/>
that lye near the Banks of the <HI>Tiber.</HI>
There are still scatter'd Pillars and Pe∣destals,
huge Pieces of Marble half bu∣ry'd
in the Earth, Fragments of Tow∣ers,
Subterraneous Vaults, Bathing Pla∣ces,
and the like Marks of its ancient
Magnificence.</P>
<P>In my way to <HI>Rome,</HI> seeing a high
Hill standing by it self in the <HI>Campania,</HI>
I did not question but it had a <HI>Classic</HI>
Name, and upon Enquiry found it to be
Mount <HI>Soracte.</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> at present
call it, because its Name begins with
an <HI>S.</HI> St. <HI>Oreste.</HI></P>
<P>The Fatigue of our crossing the <HI>Ap∣penines,</HI>
and of our whole Journey from
<HI>Loretto</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> was very agreeably re∣liev'd
by the Variety of Scenes we pass'd
thro'. For not to mention the rude
Prospect of Rocks rising one above
another, of the deep Gutters worn
in the Sides of 'em by Torrents of Rain
and Snow-Water, or the long Channels
of Sand winding about their Bottoms,
that are sometimes filled with so many
Rivers: We saw, in Six Days Travel∣ling,
the several Seasons of the Year in
their Beauty and Perfection. We were
sometimes Shivering on the Top of a
bleak Mountain, and a little while af∣ter
Basking in a warm Valley, covered
<PB N="126" REF="147"/>
with Violets and Almond-trees in Blos∣som,
the Bees already swarming over
'em, tho' but in the Month of <HI>February.</HI>
Sometimes our Road led us thro'
Groves of Olives, or by Gardens of O∣ranges,
or into several hollow Apart∣ments
among the Rocks and Mountains,
that look like so many natural Green-Houses;
as being always shaded with a
great Variety of Trees and Shrubs that
never lose their Verdure.</P>
<P>I shall say nothing of the <HI>Via Flami∣nia,</HI>
which has been spoken of by most
of the Voyage-Writers that have pass'd
it, but shall set down <HI>Claudian</HI>'s Ac∣count

NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>PON my Arrival at <HI>Rome</HI>
I took a View of St. <HI>Peters,</HI>
and the <HI>Rotunda,</HI> leaving
the rest 'till my Return from
<HI>Naples,</HI> when I should have
time and leisure enough to consider
what I saw. St. <HI>Peters</HI> seldom answers
Expectation at first entering it, but en∣larges
it self on all Sides insensibly, and
mends upon the Eye every Moment.
The Proportions are so very well observ'd,
that nothing appears to an Advantage,
or distinguishes it self above the rest. It
seems neither extreamly high, nor long,
nor broad, because it is all of them in a
just Equality. As on the contrary in
our <HI>Gothic</HI> Cathedrals, the Narrowness
<PB N="133" REF="154"/>
of the Arch makes it rise in Height, or
run out in Length; the Lowness often
opens it in Breadth, or the Defectiveness
of some other Particular makes any single
Part appear in greater Perfection. Tho'
every thing in this Church is admirable,
the most astonishing Part of it is the
Cupola. Upon my going to the Top
of it, I was surpriz'd to find that the
Dome, which we see in the Church, is
not the same that one looks upon with∣out
Doors, the last of 'em being a kind
of Case to the other, and the Stairs lying
betwixt 'em both, by which one as∣cends
into the Ball. Had there been
only the outward Dome, it would not
have shewn it self to an Advantage to
those that are in the Church; or had
there only been the inward one, it would
scarce have been seen by those that are
without; had they both been one solid
Dome of so great a Thickness, the Pil∣lars
would have been too weak to have
supported it. after having survey'd this
Dome, I went to see the <HI>Rotunda,</HI> which
is generally said to have been the Mo∣del
of it. This Church is at present so
much chang'd from the ancient <HI>Panthe∣on,</HI>
as <HI>Pliny</HI> has describ'd it, that some
have been inclin'd to think it is not the
same Temple; but the Cavalier <HI>Fonta∣na</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="155"/>
has abundantly satisfy'd the World in
this Particular, and shewn how the an∣cient
Figure, and Ornaments of the <HI>Pan∣theon,</HI>
have been chang'd into what they
are at present. This Author, who is
now esteem'd the best of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Architects, has lately written a Treatise
on <HI>Vespasian</HI>'s Amphitheater, which is
not yet Printed.</P>
<P>After having seen these Two Ma∣ster-pieces
of Modern and Ancient Ar∣chitecture,
I have often consider'd with
my self whether the ordinary Figure
of the Heathen, or that of the Christian
Temples be the most beautiful, and the
most capable of Magnificence, and can't
forbear thinking the Cross Figure more
proper for such spacious Buildings than
the <HI>Rotund.</HI> I must confess the Eye is
better fill'd at first entering the <HI>Rotund,</HI>
and takes in the whole Beauty and Mag∣nificence
of the Temple at one view.
But such as are built in the Form of a
Cross, give us a greater Variety of No∣ble
Prospects. Nor is it easie to conceive
a more glorious Show in Architecture,
than what a Man meets with in St. <HI>Pe∣ters,</HI>
when he stands under the Dome.
If he looks upward he is astonish'd at
the spacious Hollow of the Cupola, and
has a Vault on every side of him, that
<PB N="135" REF="156"/>
makes one of the beautifullest <HI>Vistas</HI>
that the Eye can possibly pass thro'. I
know that such as are profess'd Admirers
of the Ancients will find abundance
of Chimerical Beauties, the Archi∣tects
themselves never thought of, as
one of the most Famous of the Moderns
in that Art tells us, the Hole in the
Roof of the <HI>Rotunda</HI> is so admirably con∣triv'd,
that it makes those who are in
the Temple look like Angels, by dif∣fusing
the Light equally on all sides
of 'em.</P>
<P>In all the old High-ways, that lead
from <HI>Rome,</HI> one sees several little Ruins
on each side of 'em, that were formerly
so many Sepulchres; for the ancient <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
generally bury'd their Dead near
the great Roads.</P>
<Q><L>Quorum Flaminiâ tegitur cinis atque La∣tinâ.</L><BIBL>Juv. S. 1.</BIBL></Q>
<P>None, but some few of a very extra∣ordinary
Quality, having been interred
within the Walls of the City.</P>
<P>Our Christian Epitaphs, that are to
be seen only in Churches, or Church-Yards,
begin often with a <HI>Siste Viator-Viator
precare salutem,</HI> &amp;c. probably in
Imitation of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Inscriptions,
that generally address'd themselves to the
<PB N="136" REF="157"/>
Travellers; as it was impossible for 'em
to enter the City, or to go out of it
without passing thro' one of these me∣lancholly
Roads, which for a great Length
was nothing else but a Street of Fune∣ral
Monuments.</P>
<P>In my way from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples</HI> I
found nothing so remarkable as the
Beauty of the Country, and the extream
Poverty of its Inhabitants. It is indeed
an amazing thing to see the present De∣solation
of <HI>Italy,</HI> when one considers
what incredible Multitudes of People
it abounded with during the Reigns of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors: And notwithstand∣ing
the Removal of the Imperial Seat,
the Irruptions of the Barbarous Nations,
the Civil Wars of this Country, with
the Hardships of its several Govern∣ments,
one can scarce imagine how so
plentiful a Soil should become so mise∣rably
unpeopled in Comparison of what
it once was. We may reckon, by a
very moderate Computation, more In∣habitants
in the <HI>Campania</HI> of Old <HI>Rome,</HI>
than are now in all <HI>Italy.</HI> And if we
could number up those prodigious Swarms
that had settled themselves in every Part
of this delighful Country, I question
not but that they would amount to more
than can be found, at present, in any Six
<PB N="137" REF="158"/>
Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> of the same Extent.
This Desolation appears no where greater
than in the Pope's Territories, and yet
there are several Reasons would make
a Man expect to see these Domini∣ons
the best regulated, and most flou∣rishing
of any other in <HI>Europe.</HI> Their
Prince is generally a Man of Learning
and Virtue, mature in Years and Expe∣rience,
who has seldom any Vanity or
Pleasure to gratify at his People's Ex∣pence,
and is neither encumber'd with
Wife, Children or Mistresses; not to
mention the suppos'd Sanctity of his
Character, which obliges him in a more
particular manner to consult the Good
and Happiness of Mankind. The Di∣rection
of Church and State are
lodg'd entirely in his own Hands, so
that his Government is naturally free
from those Principles of Faction and Di∣vision
which are mix'd in the very
Composition of most others. His Sub∣jects
are always ready to fall in with his
Designs, and are more at his Disposal
than any others of the most absolute
Government, as they have a greater Ve∣neration
for his Person, and not only
court his Favour but his Blessing. His
Country is extreamly fruitful, and has
good Havens both for the Adriatic and
<PB N="138" REF="159"/>
Mediterranean, which is an Advantage
peculiar to himself and the <HI>Neapolitans</HI>
above the rest of the <HI>Italians.</HI> There is
still a Benefit the Pope enjoys above all
other Soveraigns, in drawing great Sums
out of <HI>Spain, Germany</HI> and other Coun∣tries
that belong to Foreign Princes,
which one would fancy might be no
small Ease to his own Subjects. We
may here add, that there is no Place in
<HI>Europe</HI> so much frequented by Strangers,
whether they are such as come out of
Curiosity, or such who are obliged to
attend the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> on several Oc∣casions,
as are many of the Cardinals and
Prelates, that bring considerable Sums
into the Pope's Dominions. But not∣withstanding
all these promising Cir∣cumstances,
and the long Peace that
has reign'd so many years in <HI>Italy,</HI> there
is not a more miserable People in <HI>Europe</HI>
than the Pope's Subjects. His State is
thin of Inhabitants, and a great Part of
his Soil uncultivated. His Subjects are
wretchedly poor and idle, and have nei∣ther
sufficient Manufactures nor Traffick
to employ 'em. These ill Effects may
arise, in a great measure, out of the Ar∣bitrariness
of the Government, but I
think they are chiefly to be ascrib'd to
the very Genius of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick
<PB N="139" REF="160"/>
Religion, which here shews it self in
its Perfection. It is not strange to find
a Country half unpeopled, where so
great a proportion of the Inhabitants of
both Sexes is ty'd under such Vows of
Chastity, and where at the same time an
Inquisition forbids all Recruits out
of any other Religion. Nor is it less
easy to account for the great Poverty
and Want that are to be met with in a
Country which invites into it such
Swarms of Vagabonds, under the Title
of Pilgrims, and shuts up in Cloisters such
an incredible Multitude of young and
lusty Beggars, who, instead of encrea∣sing
the Common Stock by their La∣bour
and Industry, lye as a dead Weight
on their Fellow Subjects, and consume
the Charity that ought to support the
Sickly, Old and Decrepid. The many
Hospitals, that are every where erected,
serve rather to encourage Idleness in the
People, than to set 'em at Work; not
to mention the great Riches which lye
useless in Churches and Religious Hou∣ses,
with the Multitude of Festivals that
must never be violated by Trade or Bu∣siness.
To speak truly, they are here
so wholly taken up with Mens Souls,
that they neglect the good of their Bo∣dies;
and when, to these natural Evils
<PB N="140" REF="161"/>
in the Government and Religion, there
arises among 'em an Avaritious Pope,
who is for making a Family, it is no
wonder if the People sink under such a
Complication of Distempers. Yet it is
to this Humour of Nepotism that <HI>Rome</HI>
owes its present Splendor and Magni∣ficence,
for it would have been impos∣sible
to have furnish'd out so many glo∣rious
Palaces with such a Profusion of
Pictures, Statues, and the like Ornaments,
had not the Riches of the People at
several times fallen into the Hands of
many different Families, and of particu∣lar
Persons; as we may observe, tho'
the Bulk of the <HI>Roman</HI> People was more
rich and happy in the times of the Com∣mon-wealth,
the City of <HI>Rome</HI> receiv'd
all its Beauties and Embellishments under
the Emperors. It is probable the <HI>Cam∣pania</HI>
of <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as other Parts of
the Pope's Territories, would be culti∣vated
much better than it is, were there
not such an Exorbitant Tax on Corn,
which makes 'em plow up only such Spots
of Ground as turn to the most Advantage:
Whereas were the Money to be rais'd
on Lands, with an Exception to some
of the more barren Parts, that might
be Tax-free for a certain Term of Years,
every one would turn his Ground to the
<PB N="141" REF="162"/>
best Account, and in a little time per∣haps
bring more Money into the Pope's
Treasury.</P>
<P>The greatest Pleasure I took in my
Journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples</HI> was in see∣ing
the Fields, Towns, and Rivers that
have been describ'd by so many <HI>Classic</HI>
Authors, and have been the Scenes of
so many great Actions; for this whole
Road is extreamly barren of Curiosities.
It is worth while to have an Eye on
<HI>Horace</HI>'s Voyage to <HI>Brundisi,</HI> when one
passes this way; for by comparing his
several Stages, and the Road he took,
with those that are observ'd at present,
we may have some Idea of the Changes
that have been made in the Face of this
Country since his Time. If we may
guess at the common Trevelling of Per∣sons
of Quality, among the ancient <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
from this Poet's Description of his
Voyage, we may conclude they seldom
went above Fourteen Miles a Day over
the <HI>Appian</HI> Way, which was more us'd
by the Noble <HI>Romans</HI> than any other in
<HI>Italy,</HI> as it led to <HI>Naples, Baïae,</HI> and the
most delightful Parts of the Nation. It
is indeed very disagreeable to be carry'd
in haste over this Pavement.</P>
<Q><L>Minùs est gravis Appia tardis.</L><BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="142" REF="163"/>
<HI>Lucan</HI> has describ'd the very Road
from <HI>Anxur</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Horace</HI> took
from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Anxur.</HI> It is not indeed
the ordinary Way at present, nor is it
mark'd out by the same Places in both
Poets.<Q><L>Jamque &amp; praecipites superaverat Anxuris

<L>Ascends high <HI>Alba,</HI> whence with new

<L>He sees the City rising to his Sight.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="164"/>
In my way to <HI>Naples</HI> I cross'd the
Two most considerable Rivers of the <HI>Cam∣pania
Felice,</HI> that were formerly call'd the
<HI>Liris</HI> and <HI>Vulturnus,</HI> and are at present
the <HI>Garigliano</HI> and <HI>Vulturno.</HI> The First
of these Rivers has been deservedly ce∣lebrated
by the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets for the Gen∣tleness
of its Course, as the other for its
Rapidity and Noise.<Q><L>—Rura quae Liris quietâ</L>

<HEAD>NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y First Days at <HI>Naples</HI> were
taken up with the Sight of
Processions, which are al∣ways
very magnificent in the
Holy-Week. It would be
tedious to give an Account of the seve∣ral
Representations of our Saviour's
Death and Resurrection, of the Figures
of himself, the Blessed Virgin, and the
Apostles, which are carry'd up and down
on this Occasion, with the Cruel Penan∣ces
that several inflict on themselves, and
the Multitude of Ceremonies that at∣tend
these Solemnities. I saw, at the
same time, a very splendid Procession for
the Accession of the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> to
the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> in which the Vice-Roy
bore his Part at the Left Hand of
Cardinal <HI>Cantelmi.</HI> To grace the Pa∣rade,
they expos'd, at the same time, the
Blood of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> which lique∣fy'd
at the approach of the Saint's Head,
tho', as they say, it was hard congeal'd
before. I had twice an Opportunity
of seeing the Operation of this pretended
<PB N="149" REF="170"/>
Miracle, and must confess I think it so
far, from being a real Miracle, that I
look upon it as one of the most Bung∣ling
Tricks that I ever saw: Yet it is
this that makes as great a Noise as any in
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and that Monsieur
<HI>Paschal</HI> has hinted at among the rest, in
his Marks of the true Religion. The
modern <HI>Neapolitans</HI> seem to have copy'd
it out from one, which was shown in a
Town of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> as
long ago as in <HI>Horace</HI>'s Time.<Q><L>—Dehinc Gnatia lymphis</L>

<L>Without a Fire th' unheated Gums to
fry;</L>
<L>Believe who will the Solemn Sham,

<P><PB N="150" REF="171"/>
One may see at least that the Heathen
Priesthood had the same kind of Secret
among them, of which the <HI>Roman</HI> Ca∣tholicks
are now Masters.</P>
<P>I must confess, tho' I had liv'd above
a Year in a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Country,
I was surpriz'd to see many Ceremonies
and Superstitions in <HI>Naples,</HI> that are not
so much as thought of in <HI>France.</HI> But
as it is certain there has been a kind of
Secret Reformation made, tho' not pub∣lickly
own'd, in the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick
Church, since the spreading of the Pro∣testant
Religion, so we find the several
Nations are recover'd out of their Ig∣norance,
in proportion as they converse
more or less with those of the Reform'd
Churches. For this Reason the <HI>French</HI>
are much more enlighten'd than the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Italians,</HI> on occasion of
their frequent Controversies with the
<HI>Huguenots</HI>; and we find many of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Gentlemen of our
own Country, who will not stick to
laugh at the Superstitions they sometimes
meet with in other Nations.</P>
<P>I shall not be particular in describing
the Grandeur of the City of <HI>Naples,</HI>
the Beauty of its Pavement, the Regu∣larity
of its Buildings, the Magnificence
of its Churches and Convents, the Mul∣titude
<PB N="151" REF="172"/>
of its Inhabitants, or the Delight∣fulness
of its Situation, which so many
others have done with a great deal of
Leisure and Exactness. If a War should
break out, the Town has reason to ap∣prehend
the exacting of a large Contri∣bution,
or a Bombardment. It has but
Seven Gallies, a Mole, and Two little
Castles, which are capable of hindering
an Enemy's Approaches. Besides, that
the Sea which lyes near it is not subject
to Storms, has no sensible Flux and Re∣flux,
and is so deep that a Vessel of Bur∣den
may come up to the very Mole.
The Houses are flat Roof'd to walk
upon, so that every Bomb that fell on
them would take Effect.</P>
<P>Pictures, Statues, and Pieces of An∣tiquity
are not so common at <HI>Naples,</HI> as
one might expect in so great and anci∣ent
a City of <HI>Italy</HI>; for the Vice-Roys
take care to send into <HI>Spain</HI> every thing
that is valuable of this Nature. Two
of their finest modern Statues are those
of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> plac'd on each
side of <HI>Sannazarius</HI>'s Tomb. On the
Face of this Monument, which is all of
Marble, and very neatly wrought, is re∣presented,
in <HI>Bas relief, Neptune</HI> among
the Satyrs, to show that this Poet was
the Inventer of Piscatory Eclogues. I
<PB N="152" REF="173"/>
remember <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> describes him∣self
in one of his Poems, as the first that
brought the Muses to the Sea-side, but
he must be understood only of the Po∣ets
of his own Country. I here saw the
Temple that <HI>Sannazarius</HI> mentions in
his Invocation of the Blessed Virgin, at
the beginning of his <HI>De partu Virginis,</HI>
which was all rais'd at his own Expence.<Q><L>—Niveis tibi si solennia templis</L>

There are several very delightful Pro∣spects
about <HI>Naples,</HI> especially from some
of the Religious Houses; for one sel∣dom
finds in <HI>Italy</HI> a Spot of Ground
more agreeable than ordinary, that is
not cover'd with a Convent. The Cu∣pola's
of this City, tho' there are many
of them, don't appear to the best Ad∣vantage
when one surveys them at a di∣stance,
as being generally too high and
narrow. The Marquis of <HI>Medina Cido∣nia,</HI>
in his Vice-Royalty, made the Shell
of a House, which he had not time to
finish, that commands a View of the
whole Bay, and would have been a very
noble Building had he brought it to
Perfection.</P>
<P>It stands so on the side of a Mountain
that it would have had a Garden to e∣very
Story, by the help of a Bridge
which was to have been laid over each
Garden.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Naples</HI> is the most delight∣ful
one that I ever saw. It lyes in al∣most
a round Figure of about Thirty
Miles in the Diameter. Three Parts of
it are shelter'd with a noble Circuit of
Woods and Mountains. The high Pro∣montory
of <HI>Surrentum</HI> divides it from
the Bay of <HI>Salernum.</HI> Between the ut∣most
Point of this Promontory, and the
<PB N="154" REF="175"/>
Isle of <HI>Caprea,</HI> the Sea enters by a
Streight of about Three Miles wide.
This Island stands as a vast Mole, which
seems to have been planted there on pur∣pose
to break the Violence of the Waves
that run into the Bay. It lyes long∣ways,
almost in a parallel Line to <HI>Na∣ples.</HI>
The excessive Height of its Rocks
secures a great part of the Bay from
Winds and Waves, which enter again
between the other End of this Island
and the Promontory of <HI>Miseno.</HI> The
Bay of <HI>Naples</HI> is call'd the <HI>Crater</HI> by the
old Geographers, probably from this its
Resemblance to a round Bowl half fill'd
with Liquor. Perhaps <HI>Virgil,</HI> who
compos'd here a great part of his <HI>Ae∣neids,</HI>
took from hence the Plan of that
beautiful Harbour, which he has made
in his First Book, for the <HI>Libyan</HI> Port is

<P><HI>Naples</HI> stands in the Bosom of this
Bay, and has the pleasantest Situation in
the World, tho', by reason of its We∣stern
Mountains, it wants an Advantage
<HI>Vitruvius</HI> would have to the Front of his
Palace, of seeing the Setting Sun.</P>
<P>One would wonder how the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI>
who have but very few Forces in
the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> should be able
to keep a People from Revolting, that
has been famous for its Mutinies and
Seditions in former Ages. But they
<PB N="156" REF="177"/>
have so well contriv'd it, that tho' the
Subjects are miserably harass'd and op∣press'd,
the greatest of their Oppressors
are those of their own Body. I shall not
mention any thing of the Clergy, who are
sufficiently reproached in most Itinera∣ries
for the universal Poverty that one
meets with in this noble and plentiful
Kingdom. A great Part of the People
is in a State of Vassallage to the Barons,
who are the harshest Tyrants in the
World to those that are under them.
The Vassals indeed are allow'd, and in∣vited
to bring in their Complaints and
Appeals to the Vice-Roy, who, to fo∣ment
Divisions, and gain the Hearts of
the Populace, does not stick at Impri∣soning
and Chastising their Masters ve∣ry
severely on occasion. The Subjects
of the Crown are notwithstanding much
more rich and happy than the Vassals
of the Barons. Insomuch that when
the King has been upon the point of
selling a Town to one of his Barons,
the Inhabitants have rais'd the Sum up∣on
themselves, and presented it to the
King, that they might keep out of so
insupportable a Slavery. Another way
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken to grind the
<HI>Neapolitans,</HI> and yet to take off the <HI>O∣dium</HI>
from themselves, has been by ere∣cting
<PB N="157" REF="178"/>
several Courts of Justice, with a
very small Pension for such as fit at the
Head of them, so that they are tempted
to take Bribes, keep Causes undecided,
encourage Law-suits, and do all they
can to fleece the People, that they may
have wherewithal to support their own
Dignity. It is incredible how great a
Multitude of Retainers to the Law there
are at <HI>Naples.</HI> It is commonly said, that
when <HI>Innocent</HI> the Eleventh had desir'd
the Marquis of <HI>Carpio</HI> to furnish him
with Thirty Thousand Head of Swine,
the Marquis answer'd him, that for his
Swine he could not spare them, but if
his Holiness had occasion for Thirty Thou∣sand
Lawyers he had them at his Service.
These Gentlemen find a continual Em∣ploy
for the fiery Temper of the <HI>Nea∣politans,</HI>
and hinder them from uniting
in such common Friendships and Allian∣ces
as might endanger the Safety of the
Government. There are very few Per∣sons
of Consideration who have not a
Cause depending; for when a <HI>Neapoli∣tan</HI>
Cavalier has nothing else to do, he
gravely shuts himself up in his Closet,
and falls a tumbling over his Papers to
see if he can start a Law Suit, and
plague any of his Neighbours. So much
is the Genius of this People chang'd since
<HI>Statius</HI>'s Time.<Q><PB N="158" REF="179"/>

Gown.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is another Circumstance which
makes the <HI>Neapolitans,</HI> in a very particu∣lar
manner, the Oppressors of each other.
The Gables of <HI>Naples</HI> are very high on
Oil, Wine, Tobacco, and indeed on al∣most
every thing that can be eaten,
drank or worn. There would have been
one on Fruit, had not <HI>Massianello</HI>'s Re∣bellion
abolish'd it, as it has probably
put a stop to many others. What makes
these Imposts more intolerable to the
poorer sort, they are laid on all Butchers
Meat, while at the same time the Fowl
and Gibier are Tax free. Besides, all
Meat being Taxed equally by the Pound,
it happens that the Duty lyes heaviest
<PB N="159" REF="180"/>
on the coarser sorts, which are most
likely to fall to the share of the common
People, so that Beef perhaps pays a Third,
and Veal a Tenth of its Price to the
Government, a Pound of either sort ha∣ving
the same Tax fix'd on it. These
Gabels are most of them at present in
the Hands of private Men; for as the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> has had occasion for Mo∣ny
he has borrow'd it of the Rich <HI>Nea∣politans,</HI>
on Condition that they should
receive the Interest out of such or such
Gabels 'till he could repay them the
Principal.</P>
<P>This he has repeated so often that at
present there is scarce a single Gabel
unmortgag'd; so that there is no Place
in <HI>Europe</HI> which pays greater Taxes,
and at the same time no Prince who
draws less Advantage from them. In
other Countries the People have the Sa∣tisfaction
of seeing the Mony they give
spent in the Necessities, Defence, or Or∣nament
of their State, or at least in the
Vanity or Pleasures of their Prince: but
here most of it goes to the enriching
of their Fellow-Subjects. If there was
not so great a Plenty of every thing in
<HI>Naples</HI> the People could not bear it. The
<HI>Spaniard</HI> however reaps this Advantage
from the present posture of Affairs, that
<PB N="160" REF="181"/>
the Murmurs of the Peeple are turn'd
upon their own Countrymen, and what
is more considerable, that almost all the
Persons, of the greatest Wealth and
Power in <HI>Naples,</HI> are engag'd by their
own Interests to pay these Impositions
chearfully, and to support the Govern∣ment
which has laid them on. For this
Reason, tho' the poorer sort are for the
Emperor, few of the Persons of Conse∣quence
can endure to think of a Change
in their present Establishment; tho'
there is no question but the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> will Reform most of these Abu∣ses,
by breaking or retrenching the Pow∣er
of the Barons, by cancelling several
unnecessary Employs, or by ransoming or
taking the Gabels into his own Hands. I
have been told too, there is a Law of
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth something like our Sta∣tute
of Mort-main, which has laid dormant
ever since his Time, and will probably
have new Life put into it under the
Reign of an active Prince. The Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Naples</HI> have been always very
notorious for leading a Life of Laziness
and Pleasure, which I take to arise part∣ly
out of the wonderful Plenty of their
Country, that does not make Labour so
necessary to them, and partly out of the
Temper of their Climate, that relaxes
<PB N="161" REF="182"/>
the Fibres of their Bodies, and disposes
the People to such an idle indolent Hu∣mour.
Whatever it proceeds from, we
find they were formerly as famous for it
as they are at present.</P>
<P>This was perhaps the Reason that the
Ancients tell us one of the <HI>Sirens</HI> was
bury'd in this City, which thence re∣ceiv'd

<HEAD>THE
ANTIQUITIES
AND
Natural Curiosities
That lye near the
CITY of Naples.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T about eight Miles Distance
from <HI>Naples</HI> lyes a very noble
Scene of Antiquities. What
they call <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Tomb is
the first that one meets with
on the Way thither. It is certain this Poet
was bury'd at <HI>Naples,</HI> but I think it is al∣most
as certain that his Tomb stood on the
other side of the Town which looks to∣wards
<HI>Vesuvio.</HI> By this Tomb is the
Entry into the Grotto of <HI>Pausilypo.</HI>
The common People of <HI>Naples</HI> believe
it to have been wrought by Magick, and
<PB N="165" REF="186"/>
that <HI>Virgil</HI> was the Magician; who
is in greater Repute among the <HI>Neapo∣litans</HI>
for having made the Grotto, than
the <HI>Aeneid.</HI></P>
<P>If a Man would form to himself a just
Idea of this Place, he must fancy a vast
Rock undermin'd from one End to the
other, and a Highway running thro' it,
near as long and as broad as the Mall in
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park. This Subterraneous
Passage is much mended since <HI>Seneca</HI>
gave so bad a Character of it. The En∣try
at both Ends is higher than the mid∣dle
Parts of it, and sinks by degrees, to
fling in more Light upon the rest. To∣wards
the middle are Two large Fun∣nels,
bor'd thro' the Roof of the Grot∣to,
to let in Light and fresh Air.</P>
<P>There are no where about the Moun∣tain
any vast Heaps of Stones, tho' it is
certain the great Quantities of 'em that
are dug out of the Rock could not easi∣ly
conceal themselves, had they not pro∣bably
been consum'd in the Moles and
Buildings of <HI>Naples.</HI> This confirm'd me
in a Conjecture which I made at the
first sight of this Subterraneous Passage,
that it was not at first design'd so much for
a High-way as for a Quarry of Stone, but
that the Inhabitants, finding a double Ad∣vantage
by it, hew'd it into the Form we
<PB N="166" REF="187"/>
now see. Perhaps the same Design gave
the Original to the <HI>SibyL</HI>'s Grotto, con∣sidering
the prodigious Multitude of Pa∣laces
that stood in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I remember when I was at <HI>Chateau∣dun</HI>
in <HI>France</HI> I met with a very curious
Person, a Member of one of the <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
Universities. He had stay'd a Day
or Two in the Town longer than ordi∣nary,
to take the Measures of several
empty Spaces that had been cut in the
Sides of a neighbouring Mountain.
Some of 'em were supported with Pil∣lars
form'd out of the Rock, some were
made in the Fashion of Galleries, and
some not unlike Amphitheaters. The
Gentleman had made to himself several
ingenious Hypotheses concerning the
use of these Subterraneous Apartments,
and from thenee collected the vast mag∣nificence
and Luxury of the ancient
<HI>Chateaudunois.</HI> But upon communicat∣ing
his Thoughts on this Subject to one
of the most Learned of the Place, he
was not a little surpriz'd to hear that
these stupendous Works of Art were
only so many Quarries of Free-Stone,
that had been wrought into different
Figures, according as the Veins of it di∣rected
the Workmen.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="188"/>
About Five Miles from the Grotto
of <HI>Pausilypo</HI> lye the Remains of <HI>Puteoli</HI>
and <HI>Bajae,</HI> in a soft Air and a delicious
Situation.</P>
<P>The Country about 'em, by reason of
its vast Caverns and Subterraneous Fires,
has been miserably torn in Pieces by
Earthquakes, so that the whole Face of
it is quite chang'd from what it was for∣merly.
The Sea has overwhelm'd a
Multitude of Palaces, which may be seen
at the Bottom of the Water in a calm
Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lucrine</HI> Lake is but a Puddle in
Comparison of what it once was, its
Springs having been sunk in an Earth∣quake,
or stopp'd up by Mountains that
have fallen upon 'em. The Lake of <HI>A∣vernus,</HI>
formerly so famous for its Steams
of Poison, is now plentifully stock'd with
Fish and Fowl. Mount <HI>Gaurus,</HI> from
one of the fruitfullest Parts in <HI>Italy,</HI> is
become one of the most barren. Seve∣ral
Fields, which were laid out in beau∣tiful
Groves and Gardens, are now na∣ked
Plains, smoaking with Sulphur, or
encumber'd with Hills that have been
thrown up by Eruptions of Fire. The
Works of Art lye in no less Disorder
than those of Nature, for that which
was once the most Beautiful Spot of <HI>I∣aly,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="189"/>
cover'd with Temples and Palaces,
adorn'd by the greatest of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Common-wealth, embelish'd by many
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and celebrated
by the best of their Poets, has now no∣thing
to show but the Ruins of its an∣cient
Splendor, and a great Magnificence
in Confusion.</P>
<P>The Mole of <HI>Puteoli</HI> has been mista∣ken
by several Authors for <HI>Caligula</HI>'s
Bridge. They have all been led into
this Error from the Make of it, because
it stands on Arches. But to pass over
the many Arguments that may be
brought against this Opinion, I shall here
take away the Foundation of it, by set∣ting
down an Inscription mention'd by
<HI>Julius Capitolinus</HI> in the Life of <HI>Antoni∣nus
Pius,</HI> who was the Repairer of this
Mole. <HI>Imp. Caesari. Divi. Hadriano. fi∣lio.

<P>It would have been very difficult to
have made such a Mole as this of <HI>Pute∣li,</HI>
in a Place where they had not so na∣tural
a Commodity as the Earth of <HI>Puz∣zuola,</HI>
which immediately hardens in the
<PB N="169" REF="190"/>
Water, and after a little lying in it looks
rather like Stone than Mortar. It was
this that gave the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> an
Opportunity of making so many En∣croachments
on the Sea, and of laying
the Foundations of their Villas and Pa∣laces
within the very Borders of it, as
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 2. O. 18. L. 3. O. 1. L. 3. O. 24. Epist. L. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Horace</HI> has elegantly described it more
than once.</P>
<P>About Four Years ago they dug up a
great Piece of Marble near <HI>Puzzuola,</HI>
with several Figures and Letters Engra∣ven
round it, which have given occasi∣on
to some Disputes among the Antiqua∣ries.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Gronovium, Fa bretti, Bulifon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> But they all agree that it is the
Pedestal of a Statue erected to <HI>Tiberius</HI>
by the Fourteen Cities of <HI>Asia,</HI> which
were flung down by an Earthquake; the
same that, according to the Opinion of
many Learned Men, happen'd at our
Saviour's Crucifixion. They have found
in the Letters, which are still legible,
the Names of the several Cities, and dis∣cover
in each Figure something particu∣lar
to the City, of which it represents
the Genius. There are two Medals of
<HI>Tiberius</HI> stamp'd on the same Occasion
<PB N="169" REF="191"/>
with this Inscription to one of 'em, <HI>Ci∣vitatibus
Asiae Restitutis.</HI> The Emperor
is represented in both sitting, with a <HI>Pa∣tera</HI>
in one Hand, and a Spear in the o∣ther.<FIGURE>

<P><PB N="171" REF="192"/>
It is probable this might have been
the Posture of the Statue, which in all
likelihood does not lye far from the Place
where they took up the Pedestal; for
they say there were other great Pieces
of Marble near it, and several of 'em In∣scrib'd,
but that no Body would be at
the Charges of bringing them to light.
The Pedestal it self lay neglected in an
open Field when I saw it. I shall not
be particular on the Ruins of the Am∣phitheater,
the ancient Reservoirs of
Water, the <HI>Sibyl</HI>'s Grotto, the <HI>Centum
Camerae,</HI> the Sepulchre of <HI>Agrippina Ne∣ro</HI>'s
Mother, with several other Anti∣quities
of less Note, that lye in the
Neighbourhood of this Bay, and have
been often describ'd by many others. I
must confess, after having survey'd the
Antiquities about <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> I
cannot but think that our Admiration of
'em does not so much arise out of their
Greatness as Uncommonness.</P>
<P>There are indeed many extraordinary
Ruins, but I believe a traveller would
not be so much astonish'd at 'em, did he
find any Works of the same kind in his
own Country. Amphitheatres, Trium∣phal
Arches, Baths, Grotto's, Cata∣combs,
Rotunda's, Highways pav'd for
so great a Length, Bridges of such an
<PB N="172" REF="193"/>
amazing Height, Subterraneous Build∣ings
for the Reception of Rain and
Snow-Water, are most of 'em at pre∣sent
out of Fashion, and only to be met
with among the Antiquities of <HI>Italy.</HI>
We are therefore immediately surpriz'd
when we see any considerable Sums laid
out in any thing of this Nature, tho'
at the same time there is many a <HI>Gothic</HI>
Cathedral in <HI>England,</HI> that has cost
more Pains and Mony than several of
these celebrated Works. Among the
Ruins of the old Heathen Temples they
show'd me what they call the Chamber
of <HI>Venus,</HI> which stands a little behind
her Temple. It is wholly dark, and has
several Figures on the Cieling wrought
in <HI>Stucco,</HI> that seem to represent Lust and
Strength by the Emblems of naked <HI>Ju∣piters</HI>
and <HI>Gladiators, Tritons</HI> and <HI>Cen∣taurs,</HI>
&amp;c. so that one would guess it
has formerly been the Scene of many
lewd Mysteries. On the other side of
<HI>Naples</HI> are the Catacombs. These must
have been full of Stench and Loathsom∣ness,
if the dead Bodies that lay in 'em
were left to rot in open Nitches, as an
Eminent Author of our own Country
Imagine's. But upon examining 'em I
find they were each of 'em stop'd up:
<PB N="173" REF="194"/>
without doubt, as soon as the Corps
was laid in it. For at the Mouth of the
Nitch one always finds the Rock cut in∣to
little Channels, to fasten the Board
or Marble that was to close it up, and I
think I did not see one which had not
still some Mortar sticking in it. In some
I found pieces of Tiles that exactly tal∣ly'd
with the Channel, and in others a
little Wall of Bricks, that sometimes
stopp'd up above a quarter of the Nitch,
the rest having been broken down. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Proculus</HI>'s Sepulchre seems to have a kind
of Mosaic Work on its Covering, for I
observ'd at one End of it several little
Pieces of Marble rang'd together after
that manner. 'Tis probable they were
adorn'd, more or less, according to the
Quality of the Dead. One would in∣deed
wonder to find such a Multitude of
Nitches unstopp'd, and I can't imagine
any Body should take the Pains to do
it, who was not in Quest of some sup∣pos'd
Treasure.</P>
<P><HI>Bajae</HI> was the Winter Retreat of the
old <HI>Romans,</HI> that being the proper Sea∣son

<P>The Natural Curiosities about <HI>Naples</HI>
are as numerous and extraordinary as the
Artificial. I shall set them down, as I
have done the other, without any re∣gard
to their Situation. The Grotto
<HI>del Cani</HI> is famous for the poisonous
Steams which float within a Foot of its
Surface. The Sides of the Grotto are
mark'd with Green, as high as the Ma∣lignity
of the Vapour reaches. The com∣mon
Experiments are as follow: A Dog,
that has his Nose held in the Vapour,
loses all Signs of Life in a very little
time; but if carry'd into the open Air,
or thrown into a Neighbouring Lake,
he immediately recovers, if he is not
<PB N="176" REF="197"/>
quite gone. A Torch, Snuff and all,
goes out in a Moment when dipp'd in∣to
the Vapour. A Pistol cannot take Fire
in it. I split a Reed, and laid in the
Channel of it a Train of Gun-powder,
so that one End of the Reed was above
the Vapour, and the other at the Bot∣tom
of it; and I found, tho' the Steam
was strong enough to hinder a Pistol
from taking Fire in it, and to quench a
lighted Torch, that it could not inter∣cept
the Train of Fire when it had once
begun Flashing, nor hinder it from run∣ning
to the very End. This Experiment
I repeated twice or thrice, to see if I
could quite dissipate the Vapour, which
I did in so great a measure, that one
might easily let off a Pistol in it. I ob∣serv'd
how long a Dog was in Expiring
the first time, and after his Recovery,
and found no sensible difference. A Vi∣per
bore it Nine Minutes the first time
we put it in, and Ten the Second. When
we brought it out after the first Trial,
it took such a vast quantity of Air into
its Lungs, that it swell'd almost twice
as big as before; and it was perhaps on
this Stock of Air that it liv'd a Minute
longer the second time. Doctor <HI>Connor</HI>
made a Discourse in one of the Acade∣mies
at <HI>Rome</HI> upon the Subject of this
<PB N="177" REF="198"/>
Grotto, which he has since Printed in
<HI>England.</HI> He attributes the Death of A∣nimals,
and the Extinction of Lights, to
a great Rarefaction of the Air, caus'd
by the Heat and Eruption of the Steams.
But how is it possible for these Steams,
tho' in never so great quantity, to resist
the Pressure of the whole Atmosphere?
And as for the Heat, it is but very in∣considerable.
However, to satisfie my
self, I plac'd a thin Viol, well stopp'd
up with Wax, within the Smoak of
the Vapour, which would certainly have
burst in an Air rarefy'd enough to kill
a Dog, or quench a Torch, but nothing
follow'd upon it. However, to take a∣way
all further Doubt, I borrow'd a
Weather-glass, and so fix'd it in the
Grotto, that the <HI>Stagnum</HI> was wholly
cover'd with the Vapour, but I could
not perceive the Quicksilver sunk after
half an Hour's standing in it. This Va∣pour
is generally suppos'd to be Sul∣phureous,
tho' I can see no Reason for
such a Supposition. He that dips his
Hand in it finds no Smell that it leaves
upon it; and tho' I put a whole Bun∣dle
of lighted Brimstone Matches to the
Smoak, they all went out in an Instant,
as if immers'd in Water. Whatever is
the Composition of the Vapour, let it
<PB N="178" REF="199"/>
have but one Quality of being very
Glewy or Viscous, and I believe it will
mechanicaly solve all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI>
of the Grotto. It's Unctuousness will
make it heavy, and unfit for mounting
higher than it does, unless the Heat of
the Earth, which is just strong enough
to agitate, and bear it up at a little di∣stance
from the Surface, were much grea∣ter
than it is to rarifie and scatter it. It
will be too gross and thick to keep the
Lungs in play for any time, so that A∣nimals
will die in it sooner or later, as
their Blood Circulates slower or faster.
Fire will live in it no longer than in
Water, because it wraps it self in the
same manner about the Flame, and by
its Continuity hinders any quantity of
Air or Nitre from coming to its Suc∣cour.
The Parts of it however are not
so compact as those of Liquors, nor
therefore tenacious enough to intercept
the Fire that has once caught a Train
of Gun-Powder, for which Reason they
may be quite broken and dispers'd by the
Repetition of this Experiment. There
is an unctuous clammy Vapour that a∣rises
from the Stum of Grapes, when
they lye mash'd together in the Vat,
which puts out a Light when dipp'd
into it, and perhaps would take away
<PB N="179" REF="200"/>
the Breath of weaker Animals, were it
put to the Trial.</P>
<P>It would be endless to reckon up the
different Baths, to be met with in a Coun∣try
that so much abounds in Sulphur.
There is scarce a Disease which has not
one adapted to it. A Stranger is gene∣rally
led into that they call <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Bath,
and several Voyage-Writers pretend
there is a cold Vapour rising from the
Bottom of it, which refreshes those
who stoop into it. 'Tis true the Heat
is much more supportable to one that
stoops, than to one that stands upright,
because the Steams of Sulphur gather
in the Hollow of the Arch about
a Man's Head, and are therefore
much thicker and warmer in that
Part than at the Bottom. The Three
Lakes of <HI>Agnano, Avernus,</HI> and the <HI>Lu∣crin,</HI>
have now nothing in them particu∣lar.
The <HI>Monte Novo</HI> was thrown out
by an Eruption of Fire, that happen'd
in the Place where now the Mountain
stands. The <HI>Sulfatara</HI> is very surprising
to one who has not seen Mount <HI>Vesuvio.</HI>
But there is nothing about <HI>Naples,</HI> nor
indeed in any Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> which de∣serves
our Admiration so much as this
Mountain. I must confess the Idea I
had of it, did not answer the real Image
<PB N="180" REF="201"/>
of the Place when I came to see it; I
shall therefore give the Description of
it as it then lay.</P>
<P>This Mountain stands at about Six
<HI>English</HI> Miles distance from <HI>Naples,</HI> tho'
by reason of its Height, it seems much
nearer to those that survey it from the
Town. In our Way to it we pass'd by
what was one of those Rivers of burn∣ing
Matter, that ran from it in a late E∣ruption.
This looks at a distance like a
new plow'd Land, but, as you come
near it you see nothing but a long Heap
of heavy disjointed Clods lying one up∣on
another. There are innumerable Ca∣vities
and Interstices among the several
Pieces, so that the Surface is all broken
and irregular. Sometimes a great Frag∣ment
stands like a Rock above the rest,
sometimes the whole Heap lyes in a
kind of Channel, and in other Places
has nothing like Banks to confine it,
but rises Four or Five Foot high in the
open Air, without spreading abroad on
either side. This, I think, is a plain
Demonstration that these Rivers were
not as they are usually represented, so
many Streams of running Matter; for
how could a Liquid, that lay hardening
by degrees, settle in such a furrow'd un∣compact
Surface? Were the River a
<PB N="181" REF="202"/>
Confusion of never so many different
Bodies, if they had been all actually dis∣solved,
they would at least have form'd
one continu'd Crust, as we see the <HI>Sco∣rium</HI>
of Metals always gathers into a so∣lid
Piece, let it be compounded of a Thou∣sand
Heterogeneous Parts. I am apt to
think therefore, that these huge unwiel'dy
Lumps that now lye one upon another,
as if thrown together by Accident, re∣main'd
in the melted Matter rigid and
unliquify'd, floating in it like Cakes of
Ice in a River, and that, as the Fire and
Ferment gradually abated, they adjusted
themseves together as well as their irre∣gular
Figures would permit, and by this
means fell into such an interrupted dis∣orderly
Heap, as we now find it. What
was the melted Matter lyes at the Bot∣tom
out of sight. After having quitted
the Side of this long Heap, which was
once a Stream of Fire, we came to the
Roots of the Mountain, and had a very
troublesome March to gain the Top of
it. It is cover'd on all Sides with a kind
of burnt Earth, very dry, and crumbled
into Powder, as if it had been artifici∣ally
sifted. It is very hot under the Feet,
and mix'd with several burnt Stones and
Cakes of Cinders, which have been
thrown out at different times. A Man
<PB N="182" REF="203"/>
sinks almost a Foot in the Earth, and
generally loses half a Step by sliding
backwards. When we had climb'd this
Mountain we discover'd the Top of it
to be a wide naked Plain, smoaking with
Sulphur in several Places, and probably
undermin'd with Fire, for we conclu∣ded
it to be hollow by the Sound it
made under our Feet. In the midst of
this Plain stands a high Hill in the shape
of a Sugar-loaf, so very steep that there
would be no mounting or descending it,
were not it made up of such a loose
crumbled Earth as I have before descri∣bed.
The Air of this Place must be
very much impregnated with Salt-peter,
as appears by the Specks of it on the
Sides of the Mountain, where one can
scarce find a Stone that has not the Top
white with it. After we had, with
much ado, conquer'd this Hill, we saw
in the midst of it the present Mouth of
<HI>Vesuvio,</HI> that goes shelving down on all
Sides 'till above a Hundred Yards deep,
as near as we could guess, and has about
Three or Four Hundred in the Diame∣ter,
for it seems a perfect Round. This
vast Hollow is generally fill'd with
Smoak, but, by the Advantage of a
Wind that blew for us, we had a very
clear and distinct sight of it. The Sides
<PB N="183" REF="204"/>
appear all over stain'd with Mixtures of
White, Green, Red and Yellow, and
have several Rocks standing out of
them that look like pure Brimstone.
The Bottom was entirely cover'd, and
tho' we look'd very narrowly we could
see nothing like a Hole in it; the Smoak
breaking through several imperceptible
Cracks in many Places. The very Mid∣dle
was firm Ground when we saw it,
as we concluded from the Stones we
flung upon it, and I question not but
one might then have cross'd the Bottom,
and have gone up on the other Side of
it with very little Danger, unless from
some accidental Breath of Wind. In
the late Eruptions this great Hollow
was like a vast Caldron fill'd with
glowing and melted Matter, which, as
it boil'd over in any Part, ran down the
Sides of the Mountain, and made Five
such Rivers as that before-mention'd.
In proportion as the Heat slacken'd, this
burning Matter must have subsided with∣in
the Bowels of the Mountain, and as
it sunk very leisurely had time to Cake
together, and form the Bottom which
covers the Mouth of that dreadful Vault
that lyes underneath it. The next E∣ruption
or Earthquake will probably
break in Pieces this false Bottom, and
<PB N="184" REF="205"/>
quite change the present Face of
Things.</P>
<P>This whole Mountain, shaped like a
Sugar-loaf, has been made at several
times, by the prodigious Quantities of
Earth and Cinders, which have been
flung up out of the Mouth that lyes in
the midst of them, so that it encreases in
Bulk at every Eruption, the Ashes still
falling down the Sides of it, like the
Sand in an Hour-Glass. A Gentleman
of <HI>Naples</HI> told me, that in his Memo∣ry
it had gain'd Twenty Foot in Thick∣ness,
and I question not but in length of
time it will cover the whole Plain, and
make one Mountain with that on which
it now stands.</P>
<P>In those Parts of the Sea, that are not
far from the Roots of this Mountain,
they find sometimes a very fragrant Oil,
which is sold dear, and makes a rich Per∣fume.
The Surface of the Sea is, for a
little Space, cover'd with its Bubbles
during the time that it rises, which they
skim off into their Boats, and afterwards
set a separating in Pots and Jars. They
say its Sources never run but in a calm
warm Weather. The Agitations of the
Water perhaps hinder them from dis∣covering
it at other times.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="206"/>
Among the Natural Curiosities of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI>
I cannot forbear mentioning their
manner of furnishing the Town with
Snow, which they here use instead of
Ice, because, as they say, it cools or
congeals any Liquor sooner. There is
a great Quantity of it consum'd yearly,
for they drink very few Liquors, not
so much as Water, that have not lain
in <HI>Fresco,</HI> and every Body, from the
highest to the lowest, makes use of it;
insomuch that a Scarcity of Snow would
raise a Mutiny at <HI>Naples,</HI> as much as a
Dearth of Corn or Provisions in another
Country. To prevent this the King
has sold the Monopoly of it to certain
Persons, who are oblig'd to furnish the
City with it all the Year at so much
the Pound. They have a high Moun∣tain
at about Eighteen Miles from the
Town, which has several Pits dug into
it. Here they employ many poor Peo∣ple
at such a Season of the Year to roll
in vast Balls of Snow, which they ram
together, and cover from the Sun-shine.
Out of these Reservoirs of Snow they
cut several Lumps, as they have occasi∣on
for them, and send them on Asses to
the Sea-side, where they are carry'd off
in Boats, and distributed to several Shops
at a settled Price, that from time to time
<PB N="186" REF="207"/>
supply the whole City of <HI>Naples.</HI> While
the <HI>Banditti</HI> continu'd their Disorders
in this Kingdom, they often put the
Snow-Merchants under Contribution,
and threaten'd them, if they appear'd
tardy in their Payments, to destroy their
Magazines, which they say might easily
have been effected by the Infusion of some
Barrels of Oil.</P>
<P>It would have been tedious to have
put down the many Descriptions that
the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets have made of several
of the Places mention'd in this Chapter:
I shall therefore conclude it with the
general Map which <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> has
given us of this great Bay of <HI>Naples.</HI>
Most of the Places he mentions lye
within the same Prospect, and if I have
pass'd over any of them, it is because I
shall take them in my Way by Sea,

<HEAD>THE
ISLE of CAPREA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving stay'd longer at <HI>Naples</HI>
than I at first design'd, I could
not dispense with my self from
making a little Voyage to
the Isle of <HI>Caprea,</HI> as being
very desirous to see a Place which had
been the Retirement of <HI>Augustus</HI> for
some time, and the Residence of <HI>Tiberi∣us</HI>
for several Years. The Island lyes
Four Miles in Length from East to West,
and about one in Breadth. The Western
Part, for about Two Miles in Length,
is a continu'd Rock vastly high, and in∣accessible
on the Sea-side. It has how∣ever
the greatest Town in the Island,
that goes under the Name of <HI>Ano-Ca∣prea,</HI>
and is in several Places cover'd with
a very fruitful Soil. The Eastern End
of the Isle rises up in Precipices very
near as high, tho' not quite so long,
as the Western. Between these Eastern
and Western Mountains lyes a Slip of
lower Ground, which runs across the
Island, and is one of the pleasantest Spots
<PB N="193" REF="214"/>
I have seen. It is hid with Vines,
Figs, Oranges, Almonds, Olives, Myr∣tles,
and Fields of Corn, which look
extremely fresh and beautiful, and make
up the most delightful: little Landskip
imaginable, when they are survey'd from
the Tops of the neighbouring Moun∣tains.
Here stands the Town of <HI>Caprea,</HI>
the Bishop's Palace, and Two or Three
Convents. In the midst of this fruitful
Tract of Land rises a Hill, that was
probably cover'd with Buildings in <HI>Ti∣berius</HI>'s
Time. There are still several
Ruins on the Sides of it, and about the
Top are found Two or Three dark Gal∣leries
low built, and cover'd with Ma∣son's
Work, tho' at present they appear
over-grown with Grass. I enter'd one
of 'em that is a Hundred Paces in Length.
I observed, as some of the Countrymen
were digging into the Sides of this
Mountain, that what I took for solid
Earth was only Heaps of Brick, Stone,
and other Rubbish, skinn'd over with a
Covering of Vegetables. But the most
considerable Ruin is that which stands
on the very Extremity of the Eastern
Promontory, where are still some Apart∣ments
left, very high and arch'd at Top.
I have not indeed seen the Remains of
any ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Buildings, that have
<PB N="194" REF="215"/>
not been Roof'd with either Vaults or
Arches. The Rooms I am mentioning
stand deep in the Earth, and have no∣thing
like Windows or Chimnies, which
makes me think they were formerly ei∣ther
Bathing Places or Reservoirs of
Water. An old Hermit lives at present
among the Ruins of this Palace, who
lost his Companion a few Years ago by
a Fall from the Precipice. He told me
they had often found Medals and Pipes
of Lead, as they dug among the Rub∣bish,
and that not many Years ago they
discover'd a pav'd Road running under
Ground, from the Top of the Moun∣tain
to the Sea-side, which was after∣wards
confirm'd to me by a Gentleman
of the Island. There is a very noble
Prospect from this Place. On the one
side lyes a vast Extent of Seas, that runs
abroad further than the Eye can reach.
Just opposite stands the Green Promon∣tory
of <HI>Surrentum,</HI> and on the other side
the whole Circuit of the Bay of <HI>Naples.</HI>
This Prospect, according to <HI>Tacitus,</HI>
was more agreeable before the burning
of <HI>Vesuvio</HI>; that Mountain probably,
which after the first Eruption look'd
like a great Pile of Ashes, was in <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI>'s
Time shaded with Woods and Vine∣yards;
for I think <HI>Martial</HI>'s Epigram
<PB N="195" REF="216"/>

that fruitful Bottom, which I have be∣fore
mention'd, are still to be seen the
Marks of ancient Edifices: Particularly
on that which looks towards the South
there is a little kind of Mole, which
seems to have been the Foundation of a
Palace; unless we may suppose that the
<HI>Pharos</HI> of <HI>Caprea</HI> stood there, which
<HI>Statius</HI> takes notice of in his Poem that
invites his Wife to <HI>Naples,</HI> and is, I

They found in <HI>Ano-Caprea,</HI> some Years
ago, a Statue and a rich Pavement un∣der
Ground, as they had occasion to
turn up the Earth that lay upon 'em.
One still sees, on the Bendings of these
Mountains, the Marks of several anci∣ent
Scales of Stairs, by which they us'd
to ascend 'em. The whole Island is so
unequal that there were but few Diver∣sions
to be found in it without Doors,
but what recommended it most to <HI>Tibe∣rius</HI>
was its wholsome Air, which is warm
in Winter and cool in Summer, and its
inaccessible Coasts, which are generally
so very steep, that a handful of Men
might defend 'em against a powerful
Army.</P>
<P>We need not doubt but <HI>Tiberius</HI> had
his different Residences, according as the
Seasons of the Year, and his different
Sets of Pleasure requir'd. <HI>Suetonius</HI> says,
<HI>Duodecim Villas totidem nominibus orna∣vit.</HI>
The whole Island was probably
cut into several easie Ascents, planted
with Variety of Palaces, and adorn'd
with as great a Multitude of Groves
and Gardens as the Situation of the Place
would suffer. The Works under Ground
were however more extraordinary than
those above it: For the Rocks were all
undermin'd with High-ways, Grotto's,
<PB N="199" REF="220"/>
Galleries, Bagnio's, and several Subter∣raneous
Retirements, that suited with
the Brutal Pleasures of the Emperor.
One would indeed very much wonder to
see such small Appearances of the many
Works of Art, that were formerly to be
met with in this Island, were we not
told that the <HI>Romans,</HI> after the Death
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> sent hither an Army of Pio∣neers
on purpose to Demolish the Build∣ings,
and deface the Beauties of the
Island.</P>
<P>In sailing round <HI>Caprea</HI> we were en∣tertain'd
with many rude Prospects of
Rocks and Precipices, that rise in
several Places half a Mile high in
Perpendicular. At the Bottom of 'em
are Caves and Grotto's, form'd by the
continual breaking of the Waves upon
'em. I enter'd one which the Inhabi∣tants
call <HI>Grotto Oscuro,</HI> and after the
Light of the Sun was a little worn off
my Eyes, could see all the Parts of it
distinctly, by a glimmering Reflection
that play'd upon 'em from the Surface
of the Water. The Mouth is low and
narrow, but, after having enter'd pretty
far in, the Grotto opens it self on both
Sides in an oval Figure of an Hundred
Yeads from one Extremity to the other,
as we were toln, for it would not have
<PB N="200" REF="221"/>
been safe measuring of it. The Roof
is vaulted, and Distils fresh Water from
every Part of it, which fell upon us as
fast as the first Droppings of a Shower.
The Inhabitants and <HI>Neapolitans</HI> who
have heard of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Grotto's, will
have this to be one of 'em, but there
are several Reasons that show it to be na∣tural.
For besides the little use we can
conceive of such a dark Cavern of Salt
Waters, there are no where any Marks
of the Chissel; the Sides are of a soft
mouldering Stone, and one sees many
of the like hollow Spaces worn in the
Bottoms of the Rocks, as they are more
or less able to resist the Impressions of
the Water that beats against 'em.</P>
<P>Not far from this Grotto lye the <HI>Sire∣num
Scopuli,</HI> which <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> men∣tion
in <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Voyage; they are Two
or Three sharp Rocks that stand about
a Stone's Throw from the South-side of
the Island, and are generally beaten by
Waves and Tempests, which are much
more violent on the South than on the
North of <HI>Caprea.</HI><Q><L>Jamque adeo Scopulos Sirenum advecta

<P>I have before said that they often find
Medals in this Island. Many of those
they call the <HI>Spintriae,</HI> which <HI>Aretin</HI> has
copy'd, have been dug up here. I know
none of the Antiquaries that have writ∣ten
on this Subject, and find nothing sa∣tisfactory
of it where I thought it most
likely to be met with, in <HI>Patin</HI>'s Edi∣tion
of <HI>Suetonius</HI> illustrated by Medals.
Those I have convers'd with about it,
are of Opinion they were made to ridi∣cule
the Brutality of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> tho' I
cannot but believe they were stamp'd by
his Order. They are unquestionably An∣tique,
and no bigger than Medals of the
Third Magnitude. They bear on one
Side some lewd Invention of that Hel∣lish
Society which <HI>Suetonius</HI> calls <HI>Mon∣strosi
concubitûs repertores,</HI> and on the o∣ther
the Number of the Medal. I have
seen of 'em as high as to Twenty. I can't
<PB N="202" REF="223"/>
think they were made as a Jest on the
Emperor, because Raillery on Coins is
of a Modern Date. I know but Two
in the Upper Empire, besides the <HI>Spin∣triae,</HI>
that lye under any Suspicion of it.
The first is one of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI>
where, in Compliment to the Emperor
and Empress, they have stamp'd on the
Reverse the Figure of <HI>Venus</HI> caressing
<HI>Mars,</HI> and endeavouring to detain him
from the Wars.<FIGURE>

<L>Qui tegitur, parmâ &amp; galeâ—</L><BIBL>Juv. Sat. 5.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This unluckily brings to Mind <HI>Fau∣stina</HI>'s
Fondness for the Gladiator, and
is therefore interpreted by many as a
hidden Piece of Satyr. But besides, that
such a Thought was inconsistent with
the Gravity of a Senate, how can one
imagine that the Fathers would have
dar'd Affront the Wife of <HI>Aurelius,</HI> and
the Mother of <HI>Commodus,</HI> or that they
could think of giving Offence to an Em∣press
whom they afterwards deify'd, and
to an Emperor that was the Darling of
the Army and People?</P>
<P>The other Medal is a Golden one of
<HI>Gallienus</HI> preserv'd in the <HI>French</HI> King's
Cabinet; it is inscrib'd <HI>Gallienae Augustae,</HI>
<HI>Pax Ubique,</HI> and was stamp'd at a time
when the Emperor's Father was in Bon∣dage,
and the Empire torn in Pieces by
several Pretenders to it. Yet, if one
considers the strange Stupidity of this Em∣peror,
with the senseless Security which
<PB N="204" REF="225"/>
appears in several of his Sayings that are
still left on Record, one may very well
believe this Coin was of his own Inven∣tion.
We may be sure, if Raillery had
once enter'd the old <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, we
should have been over-stock'd with Me∣dals
of that Nature; if we consider
there were often Rival Emperors pro∣claim'd
at the same time, who endea∣vour'd
at the lessening of each others
Character, and that most of 'em were
succeeded by such as were Enemies to
their Predecessor. These Medals of <HI>Ti∣berius</HI>
were never current Mony, but ra∣ther
of the Nature of Medalions, which
seem to have been made on purpose to
perpetuate the Discoveries of that infa∣mous
Society. <HI>Suetonius</HI> tells us, that
their monstrous Inventions were Regi∣ster'd
several ways, and preserv'd in the
Emperor's private Apartments. <HI>Cubicu∣la

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Took a Falucca at <HI>Naples</HI>
to carry me to <HI>Rome,</HI> that I
might not be forc'd to run
over the same Sights a Se∣cond
time, and might have
an Opportunity of seeing many things
in a Road which our Voyage-Writers
have not so particularly describ'd. As
in my Journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples</HI> I
had <HI>Horace</HI> for my Guide, so I had the
Pleasure of seeing my Voyage, from <HI>Na∣ples</HI>
to <HI>Rome,</HI> described by <HI>Virgil.</HI>
It is indeed much easier to trace out the
Way <HI>Aeneas</HI> took, than that of <HI>Horace,</HI>
because <HI>Virgil</HI> has mark'd it out by
Capes, Islands, and other Parts of Na∣ture,
which are not so subject to change
<PB N="208" REF="229"/>
or decay as are Towns, Cities, and the
Works of Art. Mount <HI>Pausilypo</HI> makes
a beautiful Prospect to those who pass
by it: At a small distance from it lyes
the little Island of <HI>Nisida,</HI> adorned with
a great Variety of Plantations, rising
one above another in so beautiful an Or∣der,
that the whole Island looks like a
large Terrace-Garden. It has Two lit∣tle
Ports, and is not at present troubled
with any of those noxious Steams that
<HI>Lucan</HI> mentions.<Q><L>—Tali spiramine Nesis</L>

<L>And the blue breathing Pestilence dif∣fuse.</L></Q></P>
<P>From <HI>Nifida</HI> we row'd to Cape <HI>Mi∣seno.</HI>
The Extremity of this Cape has
a long Cleft in it, which was enlarg'd
and cut into Shape by <HI>Agrippa,</HI> who
made this the great Port for the <HI>Roman</HI>
Fleet that serv'd in the Mediterranean;
as that of <HI>Ravenna</HI> held the Ships de∣sign'd
for the <HI>Adriatic</HI> and <HI>Archipelago.</HI>
The highest End of this Promontory
<PB N="209" REF="230"/>
rises in the fashion of a Sepulchre or Mo∣nument
to those that survey it from the
Land, which perhaps might occasion
<HI>Virgil</HI>'s burying <HI>Misenus</HI> under it. I
have seen a grave <HI>Italian</HI> Author, who
has written a very large Book on the
<HI>Campania Felice,</HI> that from <HI>Virgil</HI>'s De∣scrption
of this. Mountain, concludes it
was call'd <HI>Aërius</HI> before <HI>Misenus</HI> had gi∣ven
it a new Name.<Q><L>At pius Aeneas ingenti mole Sepulchrum</L>

<P>There are still to be seen a few Ruins
of old <HI>Misenum,</HI> but the most conside∣rable
Antiquity of the Place is a Sett of
Galleries that are hewn into the Rock,
and are much more spacious than the
<HI>Piscina Mirabilis.</HI> Some will have them
to have been a Reservoir of Water,
but others more probably suppose them
to have been <HI>Nero</HI>'s Baths. I lay the
first Night on the Isle of <HI>Procita,</HI> which
is pretty well cultivated, and contains
about Four Thousand Inhabitants, who
<PB N="210" REF="231"/>
are all Vassals to the Marquis <HI>de Va∣sto.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning I went to see the
Isle of <HI>Ischia,</HI> that stands further out
into the Sea. The ancient Poets call
it <HI>Inarime,</HI> and lay <HI>Typhaeus</HI> under it, by
reason of its Eruptions of Fire. There
has been no Eruption for near these
Three Hundred Years. The last was
very terrible, and destroy'd a whole Ci∣ty.
At present there are scarce any Marks
left of a Subterraneous Fire, for the Earth
is cold, and over-run with Grass and
Shrubs, where the Rocks will suffer it.
There are indeed several little Cracks in
it, thro' which there issues a constant
Smoke, but 'tis probable this arises from
the warm Springs that feed the many
Baths with which this Island is plenti∣fully
stock'd. I observ'd, about one of
these Breathing Passages, a Spot of Myr∣tles
that flourish within the Steam of
these Vapours, and have a continual
Moisture hanging upon them. On the
South of <HI>Ischia</HI> lyes a round Lake of
about Three Quarters of a Mile Diame∣ter,
separate from the Sea by a narrow
Tract of Land. It was formerly a <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Port. On the North End of the
Island stands the Town and Castle, on
an exceeding high Rock, divided from
<PB N="211" REF="232"/>
the Body of the Island, and inaccessible
to an Enemy on all Sides. This Island
is larger, but much more Rocky and
Barren than <HI>Procita. Virgil</HI> makes them
both shake at the Fall of part of the
Mole of <HI>Bajae,</HI> that stood at a few Miles
distance from them.<Q><L>Qualis in Euböico Bajarum littore quon∣dam</L>

<P>I don't see why <HI>Virgil</HI> in this noble
Comparison has given the Epithet of
<HI>Alta</HI> to <HI>Procita,</HI> for it is not only no
high Island in it self, but is much lower
than <HI>Ischia,</HI> and all the Points of Land
that lye within its Neighbourhood. I
should think <HI>Alta</HI> was join'd adverbially
with <HI>Tremit,</HI> did <HI>Virgil</HI> make use of so

<P>Among other Subterraneous Works
there is the beginning of a Passage,
which is stopp'd up within less than a
Hundred Yards of the Entrance, by
the Earth that is fallen into it. They
suppose it to have been the other Mouth
of the <HI>Sibyl</HI>'s Grotto. It lyes indeed in
the same Line with the Entrance near
the <HI>Avernus,</HI> is fac'd alike with the <HI>O∣pus
Reticulatum,</HI> and has still the Marks
<PB N="216" REF="237"/>
of Chambers that have been cut into
the Sides of it. Among the many Fa∣bles
and Conjectures which have been
made on this Grotto, I think it is high∣ly
probable, that it was once inhabited
by such as perhaps thought it a better
Shelter against the Sun than any other
kind of Building, or at least that it was
made with smaller Trouble and Expence.
As for the Mosaic, and other Works
that may be found in it, they may very
well have been added in later Ages, ac∣cording
as they thought fit to put the
Place to different Uses. The Story of
the <HI>Cimmerians</HI> is indeed clogg'd with
Improbabilities, as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates it, but
it is very likely there was in it some

cannot but think they would have taken
notice of its Original. The Port, Town,
Castle, and Antiquities of this Place
have been often describ'd.</P>
<P>We touch'd next at <HI>Monte Circeio</HI>
which <HI>Homer</HI> calls <HI>Insula Aeëa,</HI> whether
it be that it was formerly an Island, or
that the <HI>Greek</HI> Sailors of his Time thought
it so. It is certain they might easily
have been deceived by its appearance, as
being a very high Mountain join'd to
the main Land by a narrow Tract of
Earth, that is many Miles in Length, and
almost of a Level with the Surface of
the Water. The End of this Promon∣tory
is very rocky, and mightily expos'd
to the Winds and Waves, which per∣haps
gave the first Rise to the Howl∣ings
of Wolves, and the Roarings of Li∣nos,
that us'd to be heard thence. This
I had a very lively Idea of, being forc'd
<PB N="219" REF="240"/>
to lye under it a whole Night. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s
Description of <HI>Aeneas</HI> passing by this
Coast can never be enough admir'd. It
is worth while to observe how, to heigh∣ten
the Horror of the Description, he
has prepar'd the Reader's Mind, by the
Solemnity of <HI>Cajeta</HI>'s Funeral, and the
dead Stillness of the Night.<Q><L>At pius exequiis Aeneas rite solutis</L>

<P><HI>Virgil</HI> calls this Promontory <HI>Aeëae In∣sula
Circes</HI> in the Third <HI>Aeneid,</HI> but 'tis
<PB N="222" REF="243"/>
the Heroe, and not the Poet that speaks.
It may however be look'd upon as an
Intimation, that he himself thought it
an Island in <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Time. As for the
thick Woods, which not only <HI>Virgil</HI>
but <HI>Homer</HI> mentions, in the beautiful
Description that <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Longinus</HI>
have taken notice of, they are most of
'em grubb'd up since the Promontory
has been cultivated and inhabited, tho'
there are still many Spots of it which
show the natural Inclination of the Soil
leans that way.</P>
<P>The next Place we touch'd upon was
<HI>Nettuno,</HI> where we found nothing re∣markable
besides the extream Poverty
and Laziness of the Inhabitans. At Two
Miles distance from it lye the Ruins of
<HI>Antium,</HI> that are spread over a great
Circuit of Land. There are still left the
Foundations of several Buildings, and
what are always the last Parts that perish
in a Ruin, many Subterraneous Grotto's
and Passages of a great Length. The
Foundations of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Port are still to
be seen. It was altogether Artificial,
and compos'd of huge Moles running
round it, in a kind of Circular Figure,
except where the Ships were to enter,
and had about Three Quarters of a Mile
in its shortest Diameter. Tho' the mak∣ing
<PB N="223" REF="244"/>
of this Port must have cost prodigious
Sums of Mony, we find no Medal of it,
and yet the same Emperor has a Medal
struck in his own Name for the Port of
<HI>Ostia,</HI> which in Reality was a Work of
his Predecessor <HI>Claudius.</HI> The last Pope
was at considerable Charges to make a
little kind of Harbour in this Place, and
to convey fresh Water to it, which was
one of the Artifices of the Grand Duke,
to divert his Holiness from his Project
of making <HI>Civita-vecchia</HI> a free Port.
There lyes between <HI>Antium</HI> and <HI>Nettu∣no</HI>
a Cardinal's <HI>Villa,</HI> which is one of
the pleasantest for Walks, Fountains,
Shades, and Prospects that I ever saw.</P>
<P><HI>Antium</HI> was formerly famous for the
Temple of Fortune that stod in it. All
agree there were Two Fortunes worship∣ped
here, which <HI>Suetonius</HI> calls the <HI>Fortunae
Antiates,</HI> and <HI>Martial</HI> the <HI>Sorores Antii.</HI>
Some are of Opinion, that by these Two
Goddesses were meant the Two <HI>Nemeses</HI>
one of which rewarded good Men, as
the other punish'd the wicked. <HI>Fabretti</HI>
and others are apt to believe, that by
the Two Fortunes were only meant in
general the Goddess who sent Prosperity,
or she who sent Afflictions to Mankind,
and produce in their Behalf an ancient
<PB N="224" REF="245"/>
Monument found in this very Place, and
superscrib'd <HI>Fortunae Felici,</HI> which indeed
may favour one Opinion as well as the
other, and shows at least they are not
mistaken in the general Sense of their
Division. I don't know whether any
Body has taken notice, that this double
Function of the Goddess gives a consi∣derable
Light and Beauty to the Ode
which <HI>Horace</HI> has address'd to her. The
whole Poem is a Prayer to Fortune, that
she would prosper <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Arms, and
confound his Enemies, so that each of
the Goddesses has her Task assign'd in
the Poet's Prayer; and we may observe
the Invocation is divided between the
Two Deities, the first Line relating in∣differently
to either. That which I have
mark'd speaks to the Goddess of Prospe∣rity,
or if you please to the <HI>Nemesis</HI> of
the Good, and the other to the Goddess
of Adversity, or to the <HI>Nemesis</HI> of the
Wicked.<Q><L>O Diva gratum quae regis Antium,</L>
<L><HI>Praesens vel imo tollere de gradu</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mortale corpus,</HI> vel superbos</L>
<L>Vertere funeribus triumphos! <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="225" REF="246"/>Great Goddess, <HI>Antium</HI>'s Guardian

<L><HI>To bring the Haughty lower,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And turn proud Triumphs to a Funeral,</HI> &amp;c.</L><BIBL>Creech.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>If we take the first Interpretation of
the Two Fortunes for the double <HI>Neme∣sis,</HI>
the Compliment to <HI>Caesar</HI> is the
greater, and the Fifth Stanza clearer than
the Commentators usually make it, for
the <HI>Clavi trabales, cunei, uncus, liquidum∣que,

Punishment of Criminals.</P>
<P>Our next Stage brought us to the
Mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> into which we en∣ter'd
with some Danger, the Sea being
generally very rough in these Parts, where
the River rushes into it. The Season of
the Year, the Muddiness of the Stream,
with the many Green Trees hanging o∣ver
it, put me in Mind of the delight∣ful
Image that <HI>Virgil</HI> has given us when
<HI>Aeneas</HI> took the first View of it.<Q><L>Atque hic Aeneas ingentem ex aequore lucum</L>

<P>The Seas may very properly be said to

the <HI>Pharos</HI> in the Second Line. The
Two Moles that we must suppose are
join'd to the Land behind the <HI>Pharos,</HI> are
very Poetically describ'd by the
<Q><L>—Porrectaque brachia, rursus</L>

Compass they make, 'till their Two
Ends almost meet a Second time in the

<PB N="229" REF="250"/>
of <HI>Neptune</HI> sits. The Poet's Reflection
on the Haven is very just, since there
are few Natural Ports better Land∣lock'd,
and closed on all Sides than this
seems to have been. The Figure of
<HI>Neptune</HI> has a Rudder by him, to mark
the Convenience of the Harbour for Na∣vigation,
as he is represented himself at
the Entrance of it, to show it stood in
the Sea. The Dolphin distinguishes him
from a River <HI>God,</HI> and figures out his
Dominion over the Seas. He holds the
same Fish in his Hand on other Medals.
What it means we may learn from the

<HEAD>ROME.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is generally observ'd, that
Modern <HI>Rome</HI> stands higher
than the Ancient; some have
computed it about Fourteen
or Fifteen Feet, taking one
Place with another. The Reason given
for it is, that the present City stands up∣on
the Ruins of the former, and indeed
I have often observed, that where any
considerable Pile of Building stood an∣ciently
one still finds a rising Ground,
or a little kind of Hill, which was doubt∣less
made up out of the Fragments and
Rubbish of the ruin'd Edifice. But be∣sides
this particular Cause, we may assign
another that has very much contributed
to the raising the Situation of several
Parts of <HI>Rome</HI>: It being certain the great
Quantities of Earth, that have been
wash'd off from the Hills by the Vio∣lence
of Showers, have had no small
share in it. This any one may be sensi∣ble
of who observes how far several
Buildings, that stand near the Roots of
Mountains, are sunk deeper in the Earth
<PB N="231" REF="252"/>
than those that have been on the Tops
of Hills, or in open Plains; for which
Reason the present Face of <HI>Rome</HI> is much
more Even and Level than it was for∣merly;
the same Cause that has rais'd
the lower Grounds having contributed
to sink those that were higher.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Rome</HI> Two Setts of
Antiquities, the Christian and the Hea∣then.
The former, tho' of a fresher
Date, are so embroil'd with Fable and
Legend, that one receives but little Sa∣tisfaction
from searching into them. The
other give a great deal of Pleasure to
such as have met with them before in
ancient Authors; for a Man who is in
<HI>Rome</HI> can scarce see an Object that does
not call to Mind a Piece of a <HI>Latin</HI> Po∣et
or Historian. Among the Remains
of Old <HI>Rome,</HI> the Grandeur of the Com∣mon-wealth
shows it self chiefly in Works
that were either necessary or convenient,
such as Temples, High-ways, Aqueducts,
Walls and Bridges of the City. On
the contrary the Magnificence of <HI>Rome,</HI>
under the Emperors, is seen principally
in such Works as were rather for O∣stentation
or Luxury, than any real Use∣fulness
or Necessity, as in Baths, Am∣phitheaters,
Circus's, Obelisks, Trium∣phant
Pillars, Arches and Mausoleums;
<PB N="232" REF="253"/>
for what they added to the Aqueducts
was rather to supply their Baths and Nau∣machias,
and to embellish the City with
Fountains, than out of any real Necessi∣ty
there was for them. These several
Remains have been so copiously describ'd
by abundance of Travellers, and other
Writers, particularly by those concern'd
in the learned Collection of <HI>Graevius,</HI> that
it is very difficult to make any new Dis∣coveries
on so beaten a Subject. There
is however so much to be observ'd in so
spacious a Field of Antiquities, that it
is almost impossible to survey them with∣out
taking new Hints, and raising diffe∣rent
Reflections, according as a Mans na∣tural
Turn of Thoughts, or the Course
of his Studies, direct him.</P>
<P>No Part of the Antiquities of <HI>Rome</HI>
pleas'd me so much as the ancient Sta∣tues,
of which there is still an incredi∣ble
Variety. The Workmanship is of∣ten
the most exquisite of any thing in
its kind. A Man would wonder how
it were possible for so much Life to en∣ter
into Marble, as may be discover'd in
some of the best of them; and even in
the meanest one has the Satisfaction of
seeing the Faces, Postures, Airs and
Dress of those that have liv'd so many
Ages before us. There is a strange Re∣semblance
<PB N="233" REF="254"/>
between the Figures of the
several Heathen Deities, and the Descri∣ptions
that the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets have given
us of them; but as the first may be look∣ed
upon as the ancienter of the Two, I
question not but the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets were
the Copiers of the <HI>Greek</HI> Statuaries.
Tho' on other Occasions we often find
the Statuaries took their Subjects from
the Poets. The <HI>Laocoon</HI> is too known
an Instance among many others that are
to be met with at <HI>Rome.</HI> In the <HI>Villa
Aldabrandina</HI> are the Figures of an Old
and Young Man, engag'd together at
the <HI>Caestus,</HI> who are probably the <HI>Dares</HI>
and <HI>Entellus</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI>; where by the
way one may observe the Make of the
ancient <HI>Caestus,</HI> that it only consisted of
so many large Thongs about the Hand,
without any thing like a Piece of Lead at
the End of them, as some Writers of
Antiquities have falsely imagin'd.</P>
<P>I question not but many Passages in
the old Poets hint at several Parts of
Sculpture, that were in Vogue in the
Author's Time, tho' they are now ne∣ver
thought of, and that therefore such
Passages lose much of their Beauty in the
Eye of a Modern Reader, who does not
look upon them in the same Light with
the Author's Contemporaries. I shall
<PB N="234" REF="255"/>
only mention Two or Three out of <HI>Ju∣venal,</HI>
that his Commentators have not
taken notice of. The first runs thus,
<Q><L>Multa pudicitiae veteris vestigia forsan,</L>
<L>Aut aliqua extiterint, et sub Jove, sed Jo∣ve
nondum</L>
<L>Barbato—</L><BIBL>Sat. 6.</BIBL><L>Some thin Remains of Chastity ap∣pear'd</L>
<L>Ev'n under <HI>Jove,</HI> but <HI>Jove</HI> without a
Beard.</L><BIBL>Dryden.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I appeal to any Reader, if the Hu∣mour
here would not appear much more
natural and unforced to a People that
saw every Day some or other Statue of
this God with a thick bushy Beard, as
there are still many of them extant at
<HI>Rome,</HI> than it can to us who have no
such Idea of him; especially if we con∣sider
there was in the same City a Tem∣ple
Dedicated to the Young <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
call'd <HI>Templum Vaejovis,</HI> where, in all
probability, there stood the particular
Statue of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Ov. de fastis, Li. 3. Ecl. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Jupiter Imberbis. Juve∣nal,</HI>
in another Place, makes his Flatte∣rer
compare the Neck of one that is
<PB N="235" REF="256"/>
but feebly built, to that of <HI>Hercules</HI> hold∣ing
up <HI>Antaeus</HI> from the Earth.<Q><L>Et longum invalidi collum cervicibus ae∣quat</L>

<L>You'd think they were describing <HI>Her∣cules</HI></L>
<L>Lifting <HI>Anteus</HI>—</L><BIBL>Dryden.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>What a strain'd unnatural Similitude
must this seem to a Modern Reader, but
how full of Humour, if we suppose it
alludes to any celebrated Statues of these
Two Champions, that stood perhaps in
some publick Place or High-way near
<HI>Rome</HI>? And what makes it more than
probable there were such Statues, we
meet with the Figures, which <HI>Juvenal</HI>
here describes, on Antique Intaglio's and
Medals. Nay, <HI>Propertius</HI> has taken no∣tice
of the very Statues.<Q><L>—Luctantum in pulvere signa</L>

<L>And both the grappling Statues seem to
live.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot forbear observing here, that
the Turn of the Neck and Arms is of∣ten
commended in the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets a∣mong
the Beauties of a Man, as in <HI>Ho∣race</HI>
we find both put together, in that
beautiful Description of Jealousie.<Q><L>Dum tu Lydia Telephi</L>

<L>The silent, slow, consuming Fires,</L>
<L>Which on my inmost Vitals prey,</L>

<P>This we should be at a Loss to account
for, did we not observe in the Old <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Statues, that these Two Parts were
always bare, and expos'd to View, as
much as our Hands and Face are at pre∣sent.
I cannot leave <HI>Juvenal</HI> without ta∣king
notice that his

was not anciently so great an Hyperbole
as it is now, for I have seen old <HI>Roman</HI>
Rings so very thick about, and with such
large Stones in 'em, that 'tis no Won∣der
a Fop should reckon 'em a little cum∣bersome
in the Summer Season of so hot
a Climate.</P>
<P>It is certain that Satyr delights in such
Allusions and Instances as are extreamly
<PB N="238" REF="259"/>
natural and familiar: When therefore
we see any thing in an old Satyrist that
looks forc'd and pedantick, we ought to
consider how it appear'd in the Time
the Poet writ, and whether or no there
might not be some particular Circum∣stances
to recommend it to the Readers
of his own Age, which we are now de∣prived
of. One of the finest ancient Sta∣tues
in <HI>Rome</HI> is a <HI>Meleager</HI> with a Spear
in his Hand, and the Head of a Wild
Boar on one Side of him. It is of <HI>Pa∣rian</HI>
Marble, and as yellow as Ivory. One
meets with many other Figures of <HI>Mele∣ager</HI>
in the ancient <HI>Basso Relievo's,</HI> and
on the Sides of the <HI>Sarcophagi,</HI> or Fune∣ral
Monuments. Perhaps it was the Arms
or Device of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Hunters;
which Conjecture I have found con∣firm'd
in a Passage of <HI>Manilius,</HI> that lets
us know the Pagan Hunters had <HI>Melea∣ger</HI>
for their Patron, as the Christians
have their St. <HI>Hubert.</HI> He speaks of the
constellation which makes a good Sports-Man.<Q><L>—Quibus aspirantibus orti</L>

<P>I question not but this sets a Verse, in
the Fifth Satyr of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> in a much
<PB N="239" REF="260"/>
better Light than if we suppose that the

I think is more humorous than the other,
<PB N="240" REF="261"/>

<P>There is a Passage in the Sixth Satyr
of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> that I could never tell what
to make of, 'till I had got the Interpre∣tation
of it from one of <HI>Bellorio</HI>'s ancient
<HI>Basso Relievo's.</HI><Q><L>Magnorum Artificum frangebat pocula miles</L>

<L>Where various Warlike Figures were
Inlaid:</L>
<L>The <HI>Roman</HI> Wolf suckling the Twins
was there,</L>
<L>And <HI>Mars</HI> himself, arm'd with his Shield
and Spear,</L>
<L>Hov'ring above his Crest, did dreadful
show,</L>
<L>As threat'ning Death to each resisting
Foe.</L><BIBL>Dryden's Juvenal.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="262"/>
<HI>Juvenal</HI> here describes the Simplicity
of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers, and the Fi∣gures
that were generally Engraven on
their Helmets. The First of 'em was
the Wolf giving Suck to <HI>Romulus</HI> and
<HI>Rhemus</HI>: The Second, which is com∣prehended
in the Two last Verses, is not
so Intelligible. Some of the Commen∣tators
tell us, that the God here men∣tion'd
is <HI>Mars,</HI> that he comes to see his
Two Sons sucking the Wolf, and that
the old Sculptors generally drew their
Figures naked, that they might have the
Advantage of representing the different
Swelling of the Muscles, and the Turns
of the Body. But they are extremely
at a Loss to know what is meant by the
Word <HI>Pendentis</HI>; some fancy it expresses
only the great Embossment of the Fi∣gure,
others believe it hung off the Hel∣met
in <HI>Alto Relievo,</HI> as in the foregoing
Translation. <HI>Lubin</HI> supposes that the
God <HI>Mars</HI> was Engraven on the Shield,
and that he is said to be hanging, because
the Shield which bore him hung on the
Left Shoulder. One of the old Inter∣preters
is of Opinion, that by hanging
is only meant a Posture of bending for∣ward
to strike the Enemy. Another will
have it, that whatever is placed on the
Head may be said to hang, as we call
<PB N="242" REF="263"/>
hanging Gardens, such as are planted on
the Top of the House. Several learned
Men, who like none of these Explica∣tions,
believe there has been a Fault in
the Transcriber, and that <HI>Pendentis</HI> ought
to be <HI>Perdentis</HI>; but they quote no Ma∣nuscript
in Favour of their Conjecture.
The true Meaning of the Words is cer∣tainly
as follows. The <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers,
who were not a little proud of their
Founder, and the Military Genius of
their Republick, us'd to bear on their
Helmets the First History of <HI>Romulus,</HI>
who was begot by the God of War, and
suckled by a Wolf. The Figure of the
God was made as if descending upon the
Priestess <HI>Ilia,</HI> or as others call her <HI>Rhea
Silvia.</HI> The Occasion required his Body
should be naked,
<Q><L>Tu quoque inermis eras cum te formosa Sa∣cerdos</L>
<L>Cepit: ut huic urbi Semina magna dares.</L><BIBL>Ov. de Fas. L. 3.</BIBL><L>Then too, our mighty Sire, thou stood'st
disarm'd,</L>
<L>When thy rapt Soul the lovely Priestess
charm'd,</L>
<L>That <HI>Rome</HI>'s high Founder bore—</L></Q>

<PB N="243" REF="264"/>
tho' on other Occasions he is drawn, as
<HI>Horace</HI> has describ'd him, <HI>Tunicâ cinctum
adamantinâ.</HI> The Sculptor however, to
distinguish him from the rest of the Gods,
gave him what the Medallists call his
proper Attributes, a Spear in one Hand,
and a Shield in the other. As he was
represented descending, his Figure ap∣pear'd
suspended in the Air over the Ve∣stal
Virgin, in which Sense the Word
<HI>Pendentis</HI> is extremely proper and Poeti∣cal.
Besides the Antique <HI>Basso Relievo,</HI>
that made me first think of this Inter∣pretation,
I have since met with the same
Figures on the Reverses of a couple of an∣cient
Coins, which were stamp'd in the
Reign of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> as a Compli∣ment
to that Emperor, whom for his
Excellent Government and Conduct of
the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Senate regarded
as a Second kind of Founder.

<P>I cannot doubt but the Poet had here in
view the Posture of <HI>Zetus</HI> in the famous
Groupe of Figures, which represents the
Two Brothers binding <HI>Dirce</HI> to the Horns
of a mad Bull.</P>
<P>I could not forbear taking particular
notice of the several Musical Instruments,
that are to be seen in the Hands of the
<HI>Apollo's,</HI> Muses, Fauns, Satyrs, Baccha∣nais
and Shepherds, which might cer∣tainly
give a great Light to the Dispute
for Preference between the Ancient and
<PB N="247" REF="268"/>
Modern Musick. It would perhaps be
no impertinent design to take off all their
Models in Wood, which might not only
give us some Notion of the ancient Mu∣sick,
but help us to pleasanter Instru∣ments
than are now in use. By the Ap∣pearance
they make in Marble, there is
not One String-Instrument that seems
comparable to our Violins, for they are
all play'd on, either by the bare Fingers,
or the <HI>Plectrum,</HI> so that they were in∣capable
of adding any length to their
Notes, or of varying 'em by those in∣sensible
Swellings, and wearings away of
Sound upon the same String, which give
so wonderful a Sweetness to our Modern
Musick. Besides, that the String-Instru∣ments
must have had very low and feeble
Voices, as may be guess'd from the small
Proportion of Wood about 'em, which
could not contain Air enough to render
the Strokes, in any considerable mea∣sure,
full and sonorous. There is a great
deal of difference in the Make, not only
of the several kinds of Instruments, but
even among those of the same Name.
The <HI>Syringa,</HI> for Example, has sometimes
Four, and sometimes more Pipes, as high
as to Twelve. The same Variety of
Strings may be observed on their Harps,
and of Stops on their <HI>Tibiae,</HI> which shows
<PB N="248" REF="269"/>
the little Foundation that such Writers
have gone upon, who from a Verse per∣haps
in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Eclogues, or a short Pas∣sage
in a <HI>Classic</HI> Author, have been so
very nice in determining the precise Shape
of the ancient Musical Instruments, with
the exact Number of their Pipes, Strings
and Stops. It is indeed the usual Fault
of the Writers of Antiquities, to streighten
and confine themselves to particular Mo∣dels.
They are for making a kind of
Stamp on every thing of the same Name,
and if they find any thing like an old De∣scription
of the Subject they Treat on,
they take care to regulate it on all Oc∣casions,
according to the Figure it makes
in such a single Passage: As the learned
<HI>German</HI> Author, quoted by Monsieur
<HI>Baudelot,</HI> who had probably never seen
any thing of a Houshold-God, more than
a <HI>Canopus,</HI> affirms roundly, that all the
ancient <HI>Lares</HI> were made in the Fashion
of a Jug-Bottle. In short, the Antiqua∣ries
have been guilty of the same Fault
as the Systeme-Writers, who are for
cramping their Subjects into as narrow a
Space as they can, and for reducing the
whole Extent of a Science into a few
general Maxims. This a Man has occa∣sion
of observing more than once, in the
several Fragments of Antiquity that are
<PB N="249" REF="270"/>
still to be seen in <HI>Rome.</HI> How many
Dresses are there for each particular De∣ity?
What a Variety of Shapes in the
ancient Urns, Lamps, Lachrymary Ves∣sels,
<HI>Priapus's,</HI> Houshold-Gods, which
have some of 'em been represented under
such a particular Form, as any one of 'em
has been describ'd with in an ancient
Author, and would probably be all so,
were they not still to be seen in their
own Vindication? Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> from
some old Cuts of <HI>Terence,</HI> fancies that the
<HI>Larva</HI> or <HI>Persona</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Actors,
was not only a Vizard for the Face, but
had false Hair to it, and came over the
whole Head like a Helmet. Among all
the Statues at <HI>Rome,</HI> I remember to have
seen but Two that are the Figures of
Actors, which are both in the <HI>Villa Mat∣thei.</HI>
One sees on 'em the Fashion of
the old Sock and <HI>Larva,</HI> the latter of
which answers the Description that is
given of it by this learned Lady, tho' I
question not but several others were in
use; for I have seen the Figure of <HI>Tha∣lia,</HI>
the Comic Muse, sometimes with
an entire Head-piece in her Hand, some∣times
with about half the Head, and a
little Friz, like a Tower, running round
the Edges of the Face, and sometimes
with a Mask for the Face only, like those
<PB N="250" REF="271"/>
of a Modern Make. Some of the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
Actors wear at present these Masks
for the whole Head. I remember for∣merly
I could have no Notion of that
Fable in <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> before I had seen the
Figures of these entire Head-pieces.<Q><L>Personam Tragicam fortè vulpes viderat:</L>
<L>O Quanta Species, inquit, cerebrum non
habet!</L><BIBL>L. 1. Fab. 7.</BIBL><L>As wily <HI>Renard</HI> walk'd the Streets at
Night,</L>
<L>On a Tragedian's Mask he chanc'd to
light,</L>
<L>Turning it o'er, he mutter'd with Dis∣dain,</L>
<L>How vast a Head is here without a
Brain!</L></Q></P>
<P>I find Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has taken no∣tice
of this Passage in <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> upon the
same Occasion; but not of the follow∣ing
one in <HI>Martial,</HI> which alludes to the
same kind of Masks.<Q><L>Non omnes fallis, scit te Proserpina ca∣num,</L>
<L>Personam capiti detrahet illa tuo.</L><BIBL>L. 3. Ep. 43.</BIBL>
<L><PB N="251" REF="272"/>Why should'st thou try to hide thy self

<L>Impartial <HI>Proserpine</HI> beholds the Truth,</L>
<L>And, laughing at so fond and vain a

Mask.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>Villa Borghese</HI> is the Bust of
a young <HI>Nero,</HI> which shows us the Form
of an ancient <HI>Bulla</HI> on the Breast, which
is neither like a Heart, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> de∣scribes
it, nor altogether resembles that
in Cardinal <HI>Chigi</HI>'s Cabinet; so that with∣out
establishing a particular Instance in∣to
a general Rule, we ought, in Subjects
of this Nature, to leave room for the
Humour of the Artist or Wearer. There
are many Figures of Gladiators at <HI>Rome,</HI>
tho' I don't remember to have seen any
of the <HI>Retiarius,</HI> the <HI>Samnite,</HI> or the
Antagonist to the <HI>Pinnirapus.</HI> But what
I could not find among the Statues, I
met with in Two Antique Pieces of
Mosaic, which are in the Possession of
a Cardinal. The <HI>Retiarius</HI> is engag'd
with the <HI>Samnite,</HI> and has had so lucky
a Throw, that his Net covers the whole
Body of his Adversary from Head to
Foot, yet his Antagonist recover'd him∣self
out of the Toiles, and was Con∣queror,
<PB N="252" REF="273"/>
according to the Inscription.
In another Piece is represented the Com∣bat
of the <HI>Pinnirapus,</HI> who is arm'd
like the <HI>Samnite,</HI> and not like the <HI>Reti∣arius,</HI>
as some learned Men have suppo∣sed:
On the Helmet of his Antagonist
are seen the Two <HI>Pinnae,</HI> that stand up
on either Side like the Wings in the
<HI>Petasus</HI> of a <HI>Mercury,</HI> but rise much
higher, and are more pointed.</P>
<P>There is no part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Anti∣quities
that we are better acquainted
with, than what relates to their Sacri∣fices.
For as the Old <HI>Romans</HI> were ve∣ry
much devoted to their Religion, we
see several Parts of it entering their an∣cient
<HI>Basso Relievo's,</HI> Statues and Me∣dals,
not to mention their Altars, Tombs,
Monuments, and those particular Or∣naments
of Architecture which were
borrow'd from it. An Heathen Ritual
could not instruct a Man better than these
several Pieces of Antiquity, in the parti∣cular
Ceremonies and Punctilio's that at∣tended
the different kinds of Sacrifices.
Yet there is a much greater Variety in
the Make of the Sacrificing Instruments,
than one finds in those who have Treat∣ed
of them, or have given us their Pi∣ctures.
For not to insist too long on
such a Subject, I saw in Signior <HI>Anto∣nio
<PB N="253" REF="274"/>
Politi</HI>'s Collection a <HI>Patera</HI> without
any rising in the middle, as it is gene∣nerally
Engraven, and another with a
Handle to it, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> describes it,
tho' it is quite contrary to any that I
have ever seen cut in Marble; and I
have observed perhaps several Hundreds.
I might here enlarge on the Shape of
the Triumphal Chariot, which is diffe∣rent
in some Pieces of Sculpture from
what it appears in others; and on the
Figure of the <HI>Discus,</HI> that is to be seen
in the Hand of the celebrated <HI>Castor</HI>
at Don <HI>Livio</HI>'s, which is perfectly round,
and not oblong, as some Antiquaries
have represented it, nor has it any thing
like a Sling fasten'd to it, to add force
to the Toss.<Q><L>Protinus imprudens, actusque cupidine lu∣sus</L>

<P>Notwithstanding there are so great a
Multitude of cloath'd Statues at <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="275"/>
I could never discover the several diffe∣rent
<HI>Roman</HI> Garments, for 'tis very dif∣ficult
to Trace out the Figure of a Vest,
thro' all the Plaits and Foldings of the
Drapery; besides, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Gar∣ments
did not differ from each other,
so much by the Shape as by the Em∣broidery
and Colour, the one of which
was too nice for the Statuary's Observa∣tion,
as the other does not lye within
the Expression of the Chissel. I obser∣ved,
in abundance of <HI>Bas Reliefs,</HI> that
the <HI>Cinctus Gabinus</HI> is nothing else but
a long Garment, not unlike a Surplice,
which would have trail'd on the Ground
had it hung loose, and was therefore ga∣ther'd
about the middle with a Girdle.
After this it is worth while to read the
laborious Description that <HI>Ferrarius</HI> has
made of it. <Q>Cinctus Gabinus non aliud
fuit quàm cum togae lacinia laevo brachio
subducta in tergum ita rejiciebatur, ut
contracta retraheretur ad pectus, atque i∣ta
in nodum necteretur; qui nodus sive cin∣ctus

C. 14.</BIBL></Q><HI>Lipsius</HI>'s Description of the <HI>Sam∣nite</HI>
Armour, seems drawn out of the
very Words of <HI>Livy</HI>; yet not long ago
a Statue, which was dug up at <HI>Rome,</HI>
dress'd in this kind of Armour, gives a
<PB N="255" REF="276"/>
much different Explication of <HI>Livy</HI> from
what <HI>Lipsius</HI> has done. This Figure was
superscrib'd <HI>BA. TO. NI.</HI> from whence
<HI>Fabretti</HI> concludes, that it was a Monu∣ment
erected to the Gladiator <HI>Bato,</HI> who
after having succeeded in Two Com∣bats,
was kill'd in the Third, and ho∣nourably
Interr'd by Order of the Em∣peror
<HI>Caracalla.</HI> The manner of Pun∣ctuation
after each Sillable is to be met
with in other Antique Inscriptions. I
confess I could never learn where this
Figure is now to be seen, but I think it
may serve as an Instance of the great Un∣certainty
of this Science of Antiquities. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fabr. de Columnâ Trajani.</NOTE> </P>
<P>In a Palace of Prince <HI>Cesarini</HI> I saw

is suppos'd to have stood a <HI>Villa</HI> of <HI>Mar∣cus

of seeing many noble Pieces of Sculp∣ture
which are still undiscovered, for
doubtless there are greater Treasures of

are yet brought to Light. They have
often dug into Lands that are describ'd
in old Authors, as the Places where such
particular Statues or Obelisks stood, and

<P>But whether it be that the richest of
these Discoveries fall into the Pope's
Hands, or for some other Reason, it is
said that the Prince <HI>Farnese,</HI> who is the
present Owner of this Seat, will keep
it from being turn'd up 'till he sees one
of his own Family in the Chair. There
are Undertakers in <HI>Rome</HI> who often pur∣chase
the digging of Fields, Gardens,
<PB N="228" REF="279"/>
or Vineyards, where they find any like∣lihood
of succeeding, and some have
been known to arrive at great Estates by
it. They pay according to the Dimen∣sions
of the Surface they are to break
up, and after having made Essays into
it, as they do for Coal in <HI>England,</HI> they
rake into the most promising Parts of
it, tho' they often find, to their Disap∣pointment,
that others have been before∣hand
with 'em. However they gene∣rally
gain enough by the Rubbish and
Bricks, which the present Architects va∣lue
much beyond those of a Modern
Make, to defray the Charges of their
Search. I was shown Two Spaces of
Ground, where part of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Golden
House stood, for which the Owner has
been offer'd an extraordinary Sum of
Mony. What encourag'd the Undertakers
are several very ancient Trees, which
grow upon the Spot, from whence they
conclude that these particular Tracts of
Ground must have lain untouch'd for
some Ages. 'Tis pity there is not some∣thing
like a publick Register, to preserve
the Memory of such Statues as have been
found from time to time, and to mark
the particular Places where they have
been taken up, which would not only
prevent many fruitless Searches for the
<PB N="259" REF="280"/>
future, but might often give a considera∣rable
Light into the Quality of the Place,
or the Design of the Statue.</P>
<P>But the great Magazine for all kinds
of Treasure is supposed to be the Bed of
the <HI>Tiber.</HI> We may be sure, when the
<HI>Romans</HI> lay under the Apprehensions of
seeing their City sack'd by a barbarous
Enemy, as they have done more than
once, that they would take care to be∣stow
such of their Riches this way as
could best bear the Water: besides what
the Insolence of a Brutish Conqueror
may be supposed to have contributed, who
had an Ambition to waste and destroy all
the Beauties of so celebrated a City. I
need not mention the old Common-shore
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which ran from all Parts of
the Town with the Current and Vio∣lence
of an ordinary River, nor the fre∣quent
Inundations of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> which
may have swept away many of the Or∣naments
of its Banks, nor the several
Statues that the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves flung
into it, when they would revenge them∣selves
on the Memory of an ill Citizen,
a dead Tyrant, or a Discarded Favourite.
At <HI>Rome</HI> they have so general an Opini∣on
of the Riches of this River, that the
<HI>Jews</HI> have formerly proffer'd the Pope
to cleanse it, so they might have, for

their Pains, what they found in the Bo∣some
of it. I have seen the Valley near
<HI>Ponte molle,</HI> which they propos'd to fa∣shion
into a new Channel for it, 'till they
had clear'd the old for its Reception.
The Pope however would not comply
with the Proposal, as fearing the Heats
might advance too far before they had
finished their Work, and produce a Pesti∣lence
among his People; tho' I don't
see why such a Design might not be ex∣ecuted
now with as little Danger as in
<HI>Augustus</HI>'s Time, were there as many
Hands employ'd upon it. The City of
<HI>Rome</HI> would receive a great Advantage
from the Undertaking, as it would raise
the Banks and deepen the Bed of the
<HI>Tiber,</HI> and by Consequence free 'em from
those frequent Inundations to which
they are so subject at present; for the
Channel of the River is observed to be
narrower within the Walls, than either
below or above them.</P>
<P>Before I quit this Subject of the Sta∣tues,
I think it very observable, that a∣mong
those which are already found there
should be so many not only of the same
Persons, but made after the same Design.
One would not indeed wonder to see se∣veral
Figures of particular Deities and
Emperors, who had a Multitude of Tem∣ples
<PB N="261" REF="282"/>
erected to 'em, and had their seve∣ral
Sets of Worshippers and Admirers.
Thus <HI>Ceres,</HI> the most beneficent and
useful of the Heathen Divinities, has
more Statues than any other of the Gods
or Goddesses, as several of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperesses took a Pleasure to be re∣presented
in her Dress. And I believe
one finds as many Figures of that excel∣lent
Emperor <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> as of all
the rest together; because the <HI>Romans</HI>
had so great a Veneration for his Memo∣ry,
that it grew into a part of their Re∣ligion
to preserve a Statue of him in al∣most
every private Family. But how
comes it to pass, that so many of these
Statues are cut after the very same Mo∣del,
and not only of these, but of such
as had no Relation, either to the Inte∣rest
or Devotion of the Owner, as the
dying <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> the <HI>Narcissus,</HI> the Faune
leaning against the Trunk of a Tree, the
Boy with the Bird in his Hand, the <HI>Leda</HI>
and her Swan, with many others of the
same Nature. I must confess I always
look upon Figures of this kind, as the
Copies of some celebrated Master-piece,
and question not but they were famous
Originals, that gave Rise to the several
Statues which we see with the same Air,
Posture, and Attitudes: What confirms
<PB N="262" REF="283"/>
me in this Conjecture, there are many
ancient Statues of the <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI>
the <HI>Silenus</HI> with the young <HI>Bacchus</HI> in
his Arms, the <HI>Hercules Farnese,</HI> the <HI>An∣tinöus,</HI>
and other beautiful Originals of
the Ancients, that are already drawn
out of the Rubbish, where they lay
conceal'd for so many Ages. Among
the rest I have observed more that are
form'd after the Design of the <HI>Venus</HI> of
<HI>Medicis</HI> than of any other, from whence
I believe one may conclude, that it was the
most celebrated Statue among the Anci∣ents,
as well as among the Moderns. It has
always been usual for Sculptors to work
upon the best Models, as it is for those that
are Curious to have Copies of them.</P>
<P>I am apt to think something of the
same Account may be given of the
Resemblance that we meet with in many
of the Antique <HI>Basso Relievo's.</HI> I re∣member
I was very well pleased with
the Device of one that I met with on
the Tomb of a young <HI>Roman</HI> Lady,
which had beem made for her by her
Mother. The Sculptor had chosen the
Rape of <HI>Proserpine</HI> for his Device, where
in one End you might see the God of
the Dead (<HI>Pluto</HI>) hurrying away a beau∣tiful
young Virgin, (<HI>Proserpine</HI>) and at
the other the Grief and Distraction of
<PB N="263" REF="284"/>
the Mother (<HI>Ceres</HI>) on that Occasion. I
have since observed the same Device up∣on
several <HI>Sarcophagi,</HI> that have enclos'd
the Ashes of Men or Boys, Maids or
Matrons; for when the Thought took,
tho' at first it received its Rise from
such a particular Occasion as I have
mention'd, the Ignorance of the Sculptors
apply'd it promiscuously. I know there
are Authors who discover a Mystery in
this Device.</P>
<P>A Man is sometimes surprized to find
so many extravagant Fancies as are cut
on the old Pagan Tombs. Masks, Hun∣ting-matches,
and Bacchanals are very
common; sometimes one meets with a
lewd Figure of a <HI>Priapus,</HI> and in the
<HI>Villa Pamphilia</HI> is seen a Satyr coupling
with a Goat. There are however many
of a more serious Nature, that shadow
out the Existence of the Soul after
Death, and the Hopes of a happy Im∣mortality.
I cannot leave the <HI>Basso Relie∣vo's</HI>
without mentioning one of 'em,
where the Thought is extreamly noble.
It is call'd <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Apotheosis,</HI> and con∣sists
of a Groupe of Figures cut in the
same Block of Marble, and rising one a∣bove
another by Four or Five different
Ascents. <HI>Jupiter</HI> sits at the Top of it
with a Thunderbolt in his Hand, and,
<PB N="264" REF="285"/>
in such a Majesty as <HI>Homer</HI> himself re∣presents
him, presides over the Ceremony.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="2 lines" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q></P>
<P>Immediately beneath him are the Fi∣gures
of the Nine Muses, suppos'd to
be celebrating the Praises of the Poet.
<HI>Homer</HI> himself is placed at one End of
the lowest Row, sitting in a Chair of
State, which is supported on each Side
by the Figure of a kneeling Woman.
The one holds a Sword in her Hand to
represent the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or Actions of <HI>Achil∣les,</HI>
as the other has an <HI>Aplustre</HI> to repre∣sent
the <HI>Odyssy,</HI> or Voyage of <HI>Ulysses.</HI>
About the Poet's Feet are creeping a
Couple of Mice, as an Emblem of the
<HI>Batracho-myomachia.</HI> Behind the Chair
stands Time, and the Genius of the
Earth, distinguish'd by their proper At∣tributes,
and putting a Garland on the
Poet's Head, to intimate the mighty Re∣putation
he has gain'd in all Ages, and
in all Nations of the World. Before
him stands an Altar with a Bull ready
to be Sacrific'd to the new God, and
behind the Victim a Train of the several
Vertues that are represented in <HI>Homer</HI>'s
<PB N="265" REF="286"/>
Works, or to be learnt out of them,
lifting up their Hands in Admiration of
the Poet, and in Applause of the Solem∣nity.
This Antique Piece of Sculpture
is in the Possession of the Constable <HI>Co∣lonna,</HI>
but never shown to those who see
the Palace, unless they particularly desire it.</P>
<P>Among the great Variety of ancient
Coins which I saw at <HI>Rome,</HI> I could not
but take particular notice of such as re∣late
to any of the Buildings or Statues
that are still Extant. Those of the
First kind have been already publish∣ed
by the Writers of the <HI>Roman</HI> An∣tiquities,
and may be most of them
met with in the last Edition of <HI>Donatus,</HI>
as the Pillars of <HI>Trajan</HI> and <HI>Antonine,</HI> the
Arches of <HI>Drusus Germanicus,</HI> and <HI>Sep∣timius
Severus,</HI> the Temples of <HI>Janus,</HI>
<HI>Concord, Vesta, Jupiter tonans, Apollo</HI>
and <HI>Faustina,</HI> the <HI>Circus Maximus, Ago∣nalis,</HI>
and that of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> or, accor∣ding
to <HI>Fabretti,</HI> of <HI>Galienus,</HI> of <HI>Vespa∣sian</HI>'s
Amphitheater, and <HI>Alexander Se∣verus</HI>'s
Baths; tho', I must confess, the
Subject of the last may be very well
doubted of. As for the <HI>Meta sudans</HI>
and <HI>Pons Aelius,</HI> which have gain'd a
Place among the Buildings that are now
standing, and to be met with on old
Reverses of Medals: The Coin that
<PB N="266" REF="287"/>
shows the first is generally rejected as
spurious: nor is the other, tho' cited in the
last Edition of Monsieur <HI>Vaillant,</HI> esteem'd
more Authentick by the present <HI>Roman</HI>
Medallists, who are certainly the most
skilful in the World, as to the Mecha∣nical
Part of this Science. I shall close
up this Set of Medals with a very Cu∣rious
one, as large as a Medalion, that
is singular in its kind. On one Side is
the Head of the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> the
Reverse has on it the <HI>Circus Maximus,</HI>
and a View of the Side of the <HI>Palatine</HI>
Mountain that faces it, on which are
seen several Edifices, and among the rest
the famous Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> that has
still a considerable Ruin standing. This
Medal I saw in the Hands of Monseig∣neur
<HI>Strozzi,</HI> Brother to the Duke of
that Name, who has many Curiosities
in his Possession, and is very obliging to
a Stranger who desires the Sight of
'em. It is a surprising thing; that among
the great Pieces of Architecture repre∣sented
on the old Coins, one can never
meet with the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> the <HI>Mausolaeum</HI>
of <HI>Augustus, Nero</HI>'s Golden House, the
<HI>Moles Adriani,</HI> the <HI>Septizonium</HI> of <HI>Seve∣rus,</HI>
the Baths of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> &amp;c. But
since it was the Custom of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperors thus to Register their most
<PB N="267" REF="288"/>
remarkable Buildings, as well as Actions,
and since there are several in either of
these kinds not to be found on Medals,
more extraordinary than those that are;
we may, I think, with great Reason
suspect our Collections of old Coins to
be extremely deficient, and that those
which are already found out scarce bear
a Proportion to what are yet undisco∣ver'd.
A Man takes a great deal more
Pleasure in surveying the ancient Statues,
who compares them with Medals, than
it is possible for him to do without some
little Knowledge this way; for these
Two Arts illustrate each other; and as
there are several Particulars in History
and Antiquities which receive a great
Light from ancient Coins, so would it
be impossible to Decipher the Faces of
the many Statues that are to be seen at
<HI>Rome,</HI> without so Universal a Key to
them. It is this that teaches to distin∣guish
the Kings and Consuls, Emperors
and Emperesses, the Deities and Virtues,
with a Thousand other Particulars re∣lating
to Statuary, and not to be learnt
by any other Means. In the <HI>Villa Pam∣philia</HI>
stands the Statue of a Man in
Woman's Cloaths, which the Anti∣quaries
do not know what to make of,
and therefore pass it off for an <HI>Her∣maphrodite</HI>;
<PB N="268" REF="289"/>
But a learned Medallist
in <HI>Rome</HI> has lately fix'd it to <HI>Clodius,</HI>
who is so famous for having intruded into
the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emnities of the <HI>Bona Dea</HI> in a
Woman's Habit, for one sees the same
Features and Make of Face in a Medal
of the <HI>Clodian</HI> Family.</P>
<P>I have seen on Coins the Four finest
Figures perhaps that are now Extant:
The <HI>Hercules Farnese,</HI> the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Me∣dicis,</HI>
the <HI>Apollo</HI> in the <HI>Belvidere,</HI> and
the famous <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> on Horse∣back.
The oldest Medal that the First
appears upon is one of <HI>Commodus,</HI> the
Second on one of <HI>Faustina,</HI> the Third
on one of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> and the last
on one of <HI>Lucius Verus.</HI> We may con∣clude,
I think, from hence, that these
Statues were extremely celebrated a∣mong
the old <HI>Romans,</HI> or they would
never have been honoured with a Place
among the Emperor's Coins. We may
further observe, that all Four of 'em
make their first Appearance in the <HI>An∣tonine</HI>
Family, for which Reason I am apt
to think they are all of them the Pro∣duct
of that Age. They would proba∣bly
have been mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> the
Naturalist, who liv'd in the next Reign,
save one, before <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> had they
been made in his Time. As for the
<PB N="269" REF="290"/>
Brazen Figure of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> on
Horseback, there is no doubt of its be∣ing
of this Age, tho' I must confess it
may be doubted, whether the Medal I
have cited represents it. All I can say
for it is, that the Horse and Man on the
Medal are in the same Posture as they
are on the Statue, and that there is a
Resemblance of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI>'s Face,
for I have seen this Reverse on a Meda∣lion
of <HI>Don Livio</HI>'s Cabinet, and much
more distinctly in another very beautiful
one, that is in the Hands of Signior <HI>Marc.
Antonio.</HI> It is generally objected, that
<HI>Lucius Verus</HI> would rather have placed
the Figure of himself on Horseback up∣on
the Reverse of his own Coin, than
the Figure of <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> But it
is very well known that an Emperor
often stamp'd on his Coins the Face or
Ornaments of his Collegue, as an In∣stance
of his Respect or Friendship for
him; and we may suppose <HI>Lucius Verus</HI>
would omit no Opportunity of doing
Honour to <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> whom he
rather revered as his Father, than treat∣ed
as his Partner in the Empire. The
Famous <HI>Antinous</HI> in the <HI>Belvidere</HI> must
have been made too about this Age, for
he dyed towards the middle of <HI>Adrian</HI>'s
Reign, the immediate Predecessor of
<PB N="270" REF="291"/>
<HI>Antoninus Pius.</HI> This entire Figure,
tho' not to be found in Medals, may be
seen in several precious Stones. Monsi∣eur
<HI>La Chausse,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Mu∣saeum
Romanum,</HI> show'd me an <HI>Antinous</HI>
that he has published in his last Volume,
cut in a <HI>Cornelian,</HI> which he values at
Fifty Pistoles. It represents him in the
Habit of a <HI>Mercury,</HI> and is the finest <HI>In∣taglia</HI>
that I ever saw.</P>
<P>Next to the Statues, there is nothing
in <HI>Rome</HI> more surprising than that a∣mazing
variety of ancient Pillars of so
many kinds of Marble. As most of the
old Statues may be well supposed to have
been cheaper to their first Owners, than
they are to a Modern Purchaser, several
of the Pillars are certainly rated at a
much lower Price at present than they
were of old. For not to mention what
a huge Column of <HI>Granite, Serpentine,</HI>
or <HI>Porphyry</HI> must have cost in the Quar∣ry,
or in its Carriage from <HI>Egypt</HI> to
<HI>Rome,</HI> we may only consider the great
Difficulty of hewing it into any Form,
and of giving it the due Turn, Propor∣tion
and Polish. It is well known how
these sorts of Marble resist the Impres∣sions
of such Instruments as are now in
use. There is indeed a <HI>Milanese</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>
who works in them, but his Advances
<PB N="271" REF="292"/>
are so very slow, that he scarce lives up∣on
what he gains by it. He show'd me
a Piece of <HI>Porphyry</HI> work'd into an or∣dinary
Salver, which had cost him Four
Months continual Application, before
he could bring it into that Form. The
Ancients had probably some Secret to
harden the Edges of their Tools, with∣out
recurring to those Extravagant Opi∣nions
of their having an Art to mollifie
the Stone, or that it was naturally softer
at its first cutting from the Rock, or
what is still more absurd, that it was an
artificial Composition, and not the na∣tural
Product of Mines and Quarries.
The most valuable Pillars about <HI>Rome,</HI>
for the Marble of which they are made,
are the Four Columns of Oriental Ja∣sper
in St. <HI>Paulina</HI>'s Chappel at St. <HI>Ma∣ria
Maggiore</HI>; Two of Oriental Gra∣nite
in St. <HI>Pudenziana</HI>; One of Tran∣sparent
Oriental Jasper in the <HI>Vatican</HI>
Library; Four of <HI>Nero-Bianco</HI> in St.
<HI>Cecilia Trans-tevere</HI>; Two of <HI>Brocatel∣lo,</HI>
and Two of Oriental Agate in Don
<HI>Livio</HI>'s Palace; Two of <HI>Giallo Antico</HI> in
St. <HI>John Lateran,</HI> and Two of <HI>Verdi
Antique</HI> in the <HI>Villa Pamphilia.</HI> These are
all entire and solid Pillars, and made of
such kinds of Marble as are no where
to be found but among Antiquities, whe∣ther
<PB N="272" REF="293"/>
it be that the Veins of it are un∣discovered,
or that they were quite ex∣hausted
upon the ancient Buildings.
Among these old Pillars I cannot forbear
reckoning a great Part of an Alablaster
Column, which was found in the Ruins
of <HI>Livia</HI>'s <HI>Portico.</HI> It is of the Colour
of Fire, and may be seen over the high
Altar of St. <HI>Maria</HI> in <HI>Campitello,</HI> for
they have cut it into Two Pieces, and
fix'd it in the Shape of a Cross in a Hole
of the Wall that was made on purpose
to receive it; so that the Light passing
thro' it from without, makes it look,
to those who are in the Church, like a
huge transparent Cross of Amber. As
for the Workmanship of the old <HI>Roman</HI>
Pillars, Monsieur <HI>Desgodetz,</HI> in his ac∣curate
Measures of these Ruins has ob∣served,
that the Ancients have not kept
to the nicety of Proportion, and the
Rules of Art, so much as the Moderns
in this Particular. Some, to excuse this
Defect, lay the Blame of it on the Work∣men
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and of other Nations,
who sent most of the ancient Pillars ready
shap'd to <HI>Rome</HI>: Others say that the An∣cients,
knowing Architecture was chiefly
design'd to please the Eye, only took
care to avoid such Disproportions as
were gross enough to be observ'd by the
<PB N="273" REF="294"/>
Sight, without minding whether or no
they approach'd to a Mathematical Ex∣actness:
Others will have it rather to be
an Effect of Art, and of what the <HI>Italians,</HI>
call the <HI>Gusto grande,</HI> than of any Negli∣gence
in the Architect; for they say
the Ancients always consider'd the Situ∣ation
of a Building, whether it were
high or low, in an open Square or in a
narrow Street, and more or less devia∣ted
from their Rules of Art, to comply
with the several Distances and Elevations
from which their Works were to be re∣garded.
It is said there is an <HI>Ionic</HI> Pillar
in the <HI>Santa Maria Transtevere,</HI> where
the Marks of the Compass are still to be
seen on the Volute, and that <HI>Palladio</HI>
learnt from hence the working of that
difficult Problem; but I never could find
time to examine all the old Columns
of that Church. Among the Pil∣lars
I must not pass over the Two no∣blest
in the World, those of <HI>Trajan</HI> and
<HI>Antonine.</HI> There could not have been
a more magnificent Design than that of
<HI>Trajan</HI>'s Pillar. Where could an Empe∣ror's
Ashes have been so nobly lodg'd,
as in the midst of his Metropolis, and
on the Top of so exalted a Monument,
with the greatest of his Actions under∣neath
him? Or, as some will have it,
<PB N="274" REF="295"/>
his Statue was on the Top, his Urn at
the Foundation, and his Battles in the
midst. The Sculpture of it is too well
known to be here mention'd. The most
remarkable Piece in <HI>Antonine</HI>'s Pillar is the
Figure of <HI>Jupiter Pluvius,</HI> sending down
Rain on the fainting Army of <HI>Marcus
Aurelius,</HI> and Thunderbolts on his Ene∣mies,
which is the greatest Confirma∣tion
possible of the Story of the Christian
Legion, and will be a standing Evidence
for it, when any Passage in an old Au∣thor
may be supposed to be forged. The
Figure that <HI>Jupiter</HI> here makes among
the Clouds, puts me in Mind of a Passage
in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which gives just such a∣nother
Image of him. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Inter∣preters
are certainly to blame, that sup∣pose
it is nothing but the Air which is
here meant by <HI>Jupiter.</HI><Q><L>Quantus ab occasu veniens pluvialibus

<P><PB N="278" REF="299"/>
It is pity the Obelisks in <HI>Rome</HI> had
not been charged with several Parts of
the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Histories instead of Hie∣rogliphics,
which might have given no
small Light to the Antiquities of that
Nation, which are now quite sunk out
of sight in those remoter Ages of the
World. Among the Triumphal Arches,
that of <HI>Constantine</HI> is not only the no∣blest
of any in <HI>Rome,</HI> but in the World.
I search'd narrowly into it, especially
among those Additions of Sculpture
made in the Emperor's own Age, to see
if I could find any Marks of the Appa∣rition,
that is said to have preceded the
very Victory which gave Occasion to
the Triumphal Arch. But there are
not the least Traces of it to be met with,
which is not very strange, if we consi∣der
that the greatest Part of the Orna∣ments
were taken from <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Arch,
and set up to the new Conqueror in no
small haste, by the Senate and People of
<HI>Rome,</HI> who were then most of them
Heathens. There is however something
in the Inscription, which is as old as the
Arch it self, that seems to hint at the
Emperor's Vision. <HI>Imp. Caes. Fl. Con∣stantino

triumphis insignem dicavit.</HI> There is no
Statue of this Emperor at <HI>Rome</HI> with a
Cross to it, tho' the Ecclesiastical Hi∣storians
say there were many such ere∣cted
to him. I have seen of his Medals
that were stamp'd with it, and a very
remarkable one of his Son <HI>Constantius,</HI>
where he is Crown'd by a Victory on
the Reverse with this Inscription, <HI>In hoc
Signo Victor eris</HI> ☧. This Triumphal
Arch, and some other Buildings of the
same Age, show us that Architecture
held up its Head after all the other
Arts of Designing were in a very weak
and languishing Condition, as it was pro∣bably

If I was surprized not to find the Cross in
<HI>Constantine</HI>'s Arch, I was as much dis∣appointed
not to see the Figure of the
Temple of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> on that of <HI>Titus,</HI>
where are represented the Golden Can∣dlestick,
the Table of Shew-bread, and
the River <HI>Jordan.</HI> Some are of Opini∣on,
that the composite Pillars of this
Arch were made in Imitation of the
Pillars of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple, and observe
that these are the most ancient of any
that are found of that Order.</P>

It is almost impossible for a Man to
form, in his Imagination, such beautiful
and glorious Scenes as are to be met
with in several of the <HI>Roman</HI> Churches
and Chappels; for having such a pro∣digious
Stock of ancient Marble within
the very City, and at the same time so
many different Quarries in the Bowels
of their Country, most of their Chap∣pels
are laid over with such a rich Va∣riety
of Incrustations, as cannot possibly
be found in any other Part of the World.
And notwithstanding the incredible
Sums of Mony which have been alrea∣dy
laid out this way, there is still the
same Work going forward in other
Parts of <HI>Rome,</HI> the last still endeavour∣ing
to out-shine those that went before
them. Painting, Sculpture and Archi∣tecture
are at present far from being in
a flourishing Condition, but 'tis thought
they may all recover themselves under
the present Pontificate, if the Wars and
Confusions of <HI>Italy</HI> will give them leave.
For as the Pope is himself a Master of
polite Learning, and a great Encourager
of Arts, so at <HI>Rome</HI> any of these Arts
immediately thrives under the Encou∣ragement
of the Prince, and may be
fetched up to its Perfection in Ten or a
Dozen Years, which is the Work of an
<PB N="281" REF="302"/>
Age or Two in other Countries, where
they have not such excellent Models to
form themselves upon.</P>
<P>I shall conclude my Observations on
<HI>Rome,</HI> with a Letter of King <HI>Henry</HI> the
Eighth to <HI>Ann</HI> of <HI>Bulleyn,</HI> transcribed
out of the famous Manuscript in the Va∣tican,
which the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>
assures us is written with the King's own
Hand.<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>The Cause of my Writing at this

I can no less do than send her some

touching your Sister's Mother, I have
consign'd <HI>Walter Welsh</HI> to write to

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Spent Three or Four Days
on <HI>Tivoli, Frescati, Palestri∣na</HI>
and <HI>Albano.</HI> In our way
to <HI>Tivoli</HI> I saw the Rivulet
of <HI>Solforata,</HI> formerly call'd
<HI>Albula,</HI> and smelt the Stench that arises
from its Waters some time before I saw
them. <HI>Martial</HI> mentions this offensive
Smell in an Epigram of the Fourth

<L>Where <HI>Albula</HI>'s sulphureous Waters flow.</L></Q></P>
<P>The little Lake that gives Rise to this
River, with its floating Islands, is one
of the most extraordinary natural Curi∣osities
about <HI>Rome.</HI> It lyes in the very
Flat of <HI>Campania,</HI> and as it is the Drain
of these Parts, 'tis no Wonder that it
is so impregnated with Sulphur. It has
at Bottom so thick a Sediment of it,
that upon throwing in a Stone the Wa∣ter
boils for a considerable time over the
Place which has been stirr'd up. At the
same time are seen little Flakes of Scurfe
rising up, that are probably the Parts
which compose the Islands, for they of∣ten
mount of themselves, tho' the Wa∣ter
is not troubled.</P>
<P>I question not but this Lake was for∣merly
much larger than it is at present,
and that the Banks have grown over it
by degrees, in the same manner as the
Islands have been form'd on it. Nor is
it improbable but that, in Process of
<PB N="285" REF="306"/>
Time, the whole Surface of it may be
crusted over, as the Islands enlarge them∣selves,
and the Banks close in upon them.
All about the Lake, where the Ground
is dry, we found it to be hollow by the
Trampling of our Horses Feet. I could
not discover the least Traces of the <HI>Si∣byls</HI>
Temple and Grove, which stood on
the Borders of this Lake. <HI>Tivoli</HI> is seen
at a distance lying along the Brow of
a Hill. Its Situation has given <HI>Horace</HI>
occasion to call it <HI>Tibur Supinum,</HI> as <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>
perhaps for the same Reason entitles
it <HI>Superbum.</HI> The <HI>Villa de Medicis</HI> with
its Water-Works, the Cascade of the
<HI>Teverone,</HI> and the Ruins of the <HI>Sibyls</HI> Tem∣ple
(of which <HI>Vignola</HI> has made a little
Copy at <HI>Peters de Montorio</HI>) are descri∣bed
in every Itinerary. I must confess
I was most pleased with a beautiful Pro∣spect
that none of them have mentio∣ned,
which lyes at about a Mile di∣stance
from the Town. It opens on one
Side into the <HI>Roman Campania,</HI> where
the Eye loses it self on a smooth spaci∣ous
Plain. On the other Side is a more
broken and interrupted Scene, made up
of an infinite Variety of Inequalities and
Shadowings, that naturally arise from an
agreeable Mixture of Hills, Groves and
Vallies. But the most enlivening Part
<PB N="286" REF="307"/>
of all is the River <HI>Teverone,</HI> which you
see at about a Quarter of a Mile's di∣stance
throwing it self down a Preci∣pice,
and falling by several Cascades from
one Rock to another, 'till it gains the
Bottom of the Valley, where the Sight
of it would be quite lost, did not it
sometimes discover it self thro' the Breaks
and Openings of the Woods that grow
about it. The <HI>Roman</HI> Painters often
work upon this Landskip, and I am apt
to believe that <HI>Horace</HI> had his Eye upon
it in those Two or Three beautiful Tou∣ches
which he has given us of these Seats.
The <HI>Teverone</HI> was formerly call'd the
<HI>Anio.</HI><Q><L>Me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon,</L>
<L>Nec tam Larissae percussit campus opimae,</L>
<L>Quàm domus Albuneae resonantis,</L>

<L>Nor <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> charms me more,</L>
<L>Than high <HI>Albunea</HI>'s airy Walls</L>
<L>Resounding with her Water-falls,</L>
<L>And <HI>Tivoli</HI>'s delightful Shades,</L>
<L>And <HI>Anio</HI> rolling in Caseades,</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="308"/>
That through the flow'ry Meadows
glides,</L>
<L>And all the beauteous Scene divides.</L></Q></P>
<P>I remember Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> explains
<HI>Mobilibus</HI> by <HI>Ductilibus,</HI> and believes that
the Word relates to the Conduits, Pipes,
and Canals that were made to distribute
the Waters up and down, according to
the Pleasure of the Owner. But any
one who sees the <HI>Teverone</HI> must be of a∣nother
Opinion, and conclude it to be
one of the most <HI>moveable</HI> Rivers in the
World, that has its Stream broken by
such a Multitude of Cascades, and is so
often shifted out of one Channel into a∣nother.
After a very turbulent and noi∣sie
Course of several Miles among the
Rocks and Mountains, the <HI>Teverone</HI> falls
into the Valley before-mentioned, where
it recovers its Temper, as it were, by
little and little, and after many Turns
and Windings glides peaceably into the
<HI>Tiber.</HI> In which Sense we are to under∣stand
<HI>Silius Italicus</HI>'s Description, to give
it its proper Beauty.<Q><L>Sulphureis gelidus quà serpit leniter un∣dis,</L>

<P>At <HI>Frescati</HI> I had the Satisfaction of
seeing the First Sketch of <HI>Versailles</HI> in
the Walks and Water-Works. The
Prospect from it was doubtless much
more delightful formerly, when the <HI>Cam∣pania</HI>
was set thick with Towns, Villas
and Plantations. <HI>Cicero</HI>'s <HI>Tusculum</HI> was
at a Place call'd <HI>Grotto Ferrate,</HI> about
Two Miles off this Town, tho' most
of the Modern Writers have fix'd it to
<HI>Frescati. Nardini</HI> says, there was found
among the Ruins at <HI>Grotto Ferrate</HI> a
Piece of Sculpture which <HI>Cicero</HI> himself
mentions in one of his familiar Epistles.
In going to <HI>Frescati</HI> we had a fair View
of Mount <HI>Algido.</HI></P>
<P>On our Way to <HI>Palaestrina</HI> we saw
the Lake <HI>Regillus,</HI> famous for the Ap∣parition
of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> who were
here seen to give their Horses Drink af∣ter
the Battel between the <HI>Romans</HI> and
the Son-in-Law of <HI>Tarquin.</HI> At some
distance from it we had a View of the
<HI>Lacus Gabinus,</HI> that is much larger than
<PB N="289" REF="310"/>
the former. We left the Road for a∣bout
half a Mile to see the Sources of
a Modern Aqueduct. It is entertaining
to observe how the several little Springs
and Rills, that break out of the Sides
of the Mountain, are glean'd up, and
conveyed thro' little covered Channels
into the main Hollow of the Aqueduct.
It was certainly very lucky for <HI>Rome,</HI>
seeing it had occasion for so many A∣queducts,
that there chanced to be such
a Range of Mountains within its Neigh∣bourhood.
For by this means they could
take up their Water from what height
they pleased, without the Expence of
such an Engine as that of <HI>Marli.</HI> Thus
the <HI>Claudian</HI> Aqueduct ran Thirty Eight
Miles, and sunk after the Proportion
of Five Foot and a half every Mile, by
the Advantage only of a high Source
and the low Situation of <HI>Rome. Palae∣strina</HI>
stands very high, like most other
Towns in <HI>Italy,</HI> for the Advantage of
the cool Breezes, for which Reason <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>
calls it <HI>Altum,</HI> and <HI>Horace, Frigidum
Praeneste. Statius</HI> calls it <HI>Praeneste Sa∣crum,</HI>
because of the Famous Temple
of Fortune that stood in it. There are
still great Pillars of Granite, and other
Fragments of this ancient Temple. But
the most considerable Remnant of it is
<PB N="290" REF="311"/>
a very beautiful <HI>Mosaic</HI> Pavement, the
finest I have ever seen in Marble. The
Parts are so well join'd together, that
the whole Piece looks like a continued
Picture. There are in it the Figures of
a Rhinoceros, of Elephants, and of se∣veral
other Animals, with little Land∣skips
which look very lively and well
painted, tho' they are made out of the
natural Colours and Shadows of the
Marble. I do not remember ever to
have met with any old <HI>Roman Mosaic,</HI>
composed of little Pieces of Clay half
vitrify'd, and prepared at the Glass-Hou∣ses,
which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Smalte.</HI> These
are much in use at present, and may be
made of what Colour and Figure the
Work-man pleases, which is a Modern
Improvement of the Art, and enables
those who are employ'd in it to make
much finer Pieces of <HI>Mosaic</HI> than they
did formerly.</P>
<P>In our Excursion to <HI>Albano</HI> we went
as far as <HI>Nemi,</HI> that takes its Name from
the <HI>Nemus Dianae.</HI> The whole Coun∣try
thereabouts is still over-run with
Woods and Thickets. The Lake of
<HI>Nemi</HI> lyes in a very deep Bottom, so
surrounded on all Sides with Mountains
and Groves, that the Surface of it is ne∣ver
ruffled with the least Breath of
<PB N="291" REF="312"/>
Wind, which perhaps, together with
the Clearness of its Waters, gave it for∣merly
the Name of <HI>Diana</HI>'s Looking-Glass.<Q><L>—Speculumque Dianae.</L><BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Prince <HI>Caesarini</HI> has a Palace at <HI>Jen∣sano,</HI>
very near <HI>Nemi,</HI> in a pleasant Situ∣ation,
and set off with many beautiful
Walks. In our Return from <HI>Jensano</HI>
to <HI>Albano</HI> we passed through <HI>la Ricca,</HI> the
<HI>Aricia</HI> of the Ancients, <HI>Horace</HI>'s First
Stage from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Brundisi.</HI> There
is nothing at <HI>Albano</HI> so remarkable as
the Prospect from the <HI>Capucin</HI>'s Garden,
which for the Extent and Variety of
pleasing Incidents is, I think, the most
delightful one that I ever saw. It takes
in the whole <HI>Campania,</HI> and terminates
in a full View of the Mediterranean.
You have a Sight at the same time of
the <HI>Alban</HI> Lake, which lyes just by in
an Oval Figure of about Seven Miles
round, and, by reason of the continued
Circuit of high Mountains that encom∣pass
it, looks like the <HI>Area</HI> of some vast
Amphitheater. This, together with the
several green Hills and naked Rocks,
within the Neighbourhood, makes the
most agreeable Confusion imaginable.
<PB N="292" REF="313"/>
<HI>Albano</HI> keeps up its Credit still for Wine,
which perhaps would be as good as it
was anciently did they preserve it to as
great an Age; but as for Olives there
are now very few here, tho' they are
in great plenty at <HI>Tivoli.</HI><Q><L>—Albani pretiosa senectus.</L><BIBL>Juv. Sat. 13.</BIBL>

<P>We saw afterwards, in the Progress

<HI>Bolsena.</HI> The last is reckon'd One and
Twenty Miles in Circuit, and is plenti∣fully
stock'd with Fish and Fowl. There
are in it a couple of Islands, that are
perhaps the Two floating Isles menti∣oned
by <HI>Pliny,</HI> with that improbable
Circumstance of their appearing some∣times
like a Circle, and sometimes like
a Triangle, but never like a Quadran∣gle.
It is easie enough to conceive how
they might become fix'd, tho' they
once floated; and it is not very credi∣ble,
that the Naturalist could be decei∣ved
in his Account of a Place that lay,
<PB N="297" REF="318"/>
as it were, in the Neighbourhood of
<HI>Rome.</HI> At one End of this Lake stands
<HI>Montefiascone,</HI> the Habitation of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s
<HI>Aequi Falisci,</HI> Aen. 7. and on the Side

<P>I saw in the Church-yard of <HI>Bolsena</HI>
an antique Funeral Monument (of that
kind which they call'd a <HI>Sarcophagus</HI>)
very entire, and what is particular, En∣graven
<HI>on all Sides</HI> with a curious Re∣presentation
of a Bacchanal. Had the
Inhabitants observed a couple of lewd
Figures at one End of it, they would
not have thought it a proper Ornament
for the Place where it now stands. Af∣ter
having travell'd hence to <HI>Aquapen∣dente,</HI>
that stands in a wonderful pleasant
Situation, we came to the little Brook
which separates the Pope's Dominions
from the Great Duke's. The Frontier
Castle of <HI>Radicofani</HI> is seated on the
highest Mountain in the Country, and
is as well fortify'd as the Situation of
<PB N="298" REF="319"/>
the Place will permit. We here found
the natural Face of the Country quite
changed from what we had been enter∣tain'd
with in the Pope's Dominions.
For instead of the many beautiful Scenes
of green Mountains and fruitful Vallies,
that we had been presented with for
some Days before, we saw now nothing
but a wild naked Prospect of Rocks and
Hills, worn on all Sides with Gutters
and Channels, and not a Tree or Shrub
to be met with in a vast Circuit of several
Miles. This Savage Prospect put me
in Mind of the <HI>Italian</HI> Proverb, that
<HI>The Pope has the Flesh, and the Great
Duke the Bones of</HI> Italy. Among a large
Extent of these Barren Mountains I saw
but a single Spot that was cultivated, on
which there stood a Convent.</P>

Towers of Brick, which in
the Time of the Common-wealth
were erected to
such of the Members as had done
any considerable Service to their Coun∣try.
These Towers gave us a sight of
the Town a great while before we en∣ter'd
it. There is nothing in this City
so extraordinary as the Cathedral, which
a Man may view with Pleasure after he
has seen St. <HI>Peters,</HI> tho' 'tis quite of a∣nother
Make, and can only be look'd
upon as one of the Master-pieces of <HI>Go∣thic</HI>
Architecture. When a Man sees
the prodigious Pains and Expence, that

<PB N="300" REF="321"/>
barbarous Buildings, one cannot but fan∣cy
to himself what Miracles of Archi∣tecture
they would have left us, had
they only been instructed in the right
way; for when the Devotion of those
Ages was much warmer than it is at pre∣sent,
and the Riches of the People

there was so much Mony consumed on

are form'd like so many Scenes of Per∣spective,
with a Multitude of little Pil∣lars
retiring one behind another, the
great Columns are finely engraven with
Fruits and Foliage that run twisting about
them from the very Top to the Bottom,
the whole Body of the Church is che∣quer'd
with different Lays of White and
Black Marble, the Pavement curiously
cut out in Designs and Scripture-Stories,
and the Front cover'd with such a Va∣riety
of Figures, and over-run with so
many little Mazes and Labyrinths of
Sculpture, that nothing in the World

can make a prettier Show to those who
prefer false Beauties, and affected Orna∣ments,
to a Noble and Majestick Sim∣plicity.
Over-against this Church stands

nor the Beauty of its Piazza, which so
many Travellers have described. As this
is the last Republick that fell under the
Subjection of the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> so
is it still supposed to retain many Han∣kerings
after its ancient Liberty: For
this Reason, when the Keys and Page∣ants
of the Duke's Towns and Govern∣ments
pass in Procession before him, on
St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist's Day, I was told that
<HI>Sienna</HI> comes in the Rear of his Do∣minions,
and is push'd forward by those
who follow, to show the Reluctancy
it has to appear in such a Solemnity. I
shall say nothing of the many gross and
absurd Traditions of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Si∣enna</HI>
who is the great Saint of this Place.
I think there is as much Pleasure in
hearing a Man tell his Dreams, as in
reading Accounts of this Nature: A
Traveller, that thinks them worth his
<PB N="302" REF="323"/>
Observation, may fill a Book with them
at every great Town in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Sienna</HI> we went forward to
<HI>Leghorne,</HI> where the Two Ports, the
Bagnio, and <HI>Donatelli</HI>'s Statue of the
Great Duke, amidst the Four Slaves
chain'd to his Pedestal, are very noble
Sights. The Square is one of the lar∣gest,
and will be one of the most beau∣tiful
in <HI>Italy,</HI> when this Statue is ere∣cted
in it, and a Town-house built at
one End of it to front the Church that
stands at the other. They are at a con∣tinual
Expence to cleanse the Ports, and
keep 'em from being choak'd up, which
they do by the help of several Engines
that are always at work, and employ
many of the Great Duke's Slaves. What∣ever
part of the Harbour they scoop in,
it has an Influence on all the rest, for
the Sea immediately works the whole
Bottom to a Level. They draw a dou∣ble
Advantage from the Dirt that is ta∣ken
up, as it clears the Port, and at the
same time dries up several Marshes a∣bout
the Town, where they lay it from
time to time. One can scarce imagine
how great Profits the Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI>
receives from this single Place, which
are not generally thought so considera∣ble,
because it passes for a Free Port.
<PB N="303" REF="324"/>
But, it is very well known how the
Great Duke, on a late occasion, not∣withstanding
the Privileges of the
Merchants, drew no small Sums of Mo∣ny
out of them; tho' still, in respect of
the exorbitant Dues that are paid at
most other Ports, it deservedly retains
the Name of Free. It brings into his
Dominions a great Increase of People
from all other Nations. They reckon in
it near Ten Thousand <HI>Jews,</HI> many of
them very Rich, and so great Traffic∣kers,
that our <HI>English</HI> Factors complain
they have most of our Country Trade
in their Hands. 'Tis true the Strangers
pay little or no Taxes directly, but out
of every thing they buy there goes a
large Gabel to the Government. The
very Ice-Merchant at <HI>Leghorne</HI> pays a∣bove
a Thousand Pound Sterling annu∣ally
for his Privilege, and the Tobacco-Merchant
Ten Thousand. The Ground
is sold by the Great Duke at a very
high Price, and Houses are every Day
rising on it. All the Commodities that
go up into the Country, of which
there are great Quantities, are clogg'd
with Impositions as soon as they leave
<HI>Leghorne.</HI> All the Wines, Oils, and
Silks that come down from the fruitful
<PB N="304" REF="325"/>
Vallies of <HI>Pisa, Florence,</HI> and other Parts
of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> must make their Way thro'
several Duties and Taxes before they
can reach the Port. The Canal that
runs from the Sea into the <HI>Arno</HI> gives
a convenient Carriage to all Goods that
are to be shipp'd off, which does not
a little enrich the Owners; and in pro∣portion,
as private Men grow wealthy,
their Legacies, Law-Suits, Daughter's the
Portions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> encrease, in all which the
Great Duke comes in for a considerable
Share. The <HI>Lucquese,</HI> who Traffick at this
Port, are said to bring in a great deal into
the Duke's Coffers. Another Advantage,
which may be of great use to him, is,
that at Five or Six Days warning he
might find Credit in this Town for
very large summs of Money, which no
other Prince in <HI>Italy</HI> can pretend to. I
need not take notice of the Reputati∣on
that this Port gives him among Fo∣reign
Princes, but there is one Benefit
arising from it, which, tho' never thrown
into the Account, is doubtless very con∣siderable.
It is well known how the
<HI>Pisans</HI> and <HI>Florentines</HI> long regretted the
Loss of their ancient Liberty, and their
Subjection to a Family that some of
them thought themselves equal to, in
the flourishing Times of their Com∣mon-wealths.
<PB N="305" REF="326"/>
The Town of <HI>Leghorne</HI>
has accidentally done what the greatest
Fetch of Politicks would have found
difficult to have brought about, for it
has almost unpeopled <HI>Pisa,</HI> if we com∣pare
it with what it was formerly, and
every Day lessens the Number of the
Inhabitants of <HI>Florence.</HI> This does not
only weaken those Places, but at the
same time turns many of the busiest Spi∣rits
from their old Notions of Honour
and Liberty, to the Thoughts of Traf∣fick
and Merchandise: And as Men en∣gaged
in a Road of Thriving are no
Friends to Changes and Revolutions,
they are at present worn into a Habit of
Subjection, and push all their Pursuits
another way. It is no Wonder there∣fore
that the Great Duke has such Ap∣prehensions
of the Pope's making <HI>Civi∣ta
Vecchia</HI> a Free Port, which may in
time prove so very prejudicial to <HI>Leg∣horne.</HI>
It would be thought an impro∣bable
Story, should I set down the se∣veral
Methods that are commonly re∣ported
to have been made use of, during
the last Pontificate, to put a stop to this
Design. The Great Duke's Mony was
so well bestow'd in the Conclave, that
several of the Cardinals dissuaded the
Pope from the Undertaking, and at last
<PB N="106" REF="327"/>
turn'd all his Thoughts upon the little
Port which he made at <HI>Antium,</HI> near
<HI>Nettuno.</HI> The chief Work-men that were
to have convey'd the Water to <HI>Civita
Vecchia</HI> were bought off, and when a
poor <HI>Capucin,</HI> that was thought Proof
against all Bribes, had undertaken to
carry on the Work, he dy'd a little
after he had enter'd upon it. The pre∣sent
Pope however, who is very well
acquainted with the Secret History, and
the Weakness of his Predecessor, seems
resolved to bring the Project to its Per∣fection.
He has already been at vast
Charges in finishing the Aqueduct, and
had some Hopes that, if the War should
drive our <HI>English</HI> Merchants from <HI>Sicily</HI>
and <HI>Naples,</HI> they would settle here. His
Holiness has told some <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men,
that those of our Nation should
have the greatest Privileges of any but
the Subjects of the Church. One of
our Countreymen, who makes a good
Figure at <HI>Rome,</HI> told me the Pope has
this Design extremely at his Heart, but
that he fears the <HI>English</HI> will suffer no∣thing
like a Resident or Consul in his
Dominions, tho' at the same time he
hoped the Business might as well be trans∣acted
by one that had no publick Cha∣racter.
This Gentleman has so busied
<PB N="107" REF="328"/>
himself in the Affair, that he has of∣fended
the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Cardinals,
insomuch that Cardinal <HI>Janson</HI> refused
to see him when he would have made
his Apology for what he had said to the
Pope on this Subject. There is one
great Objection to <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> that
the Air of the Place is not wholsome;
but this they say proceeds from want of
Inhabitants, the Air of <HI>Leghorne</HI> having
been worse than this before the Town
was well peopled.</P>
<P>The great Profits which have accrued
to the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> from his Free
Port have set several of the States of <HI>Italy</HI>
on the same Project. The most likely
to succeed in it would be the <HI>Genoese,</HI>
who lye more convenient than the <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI>
and have a more inviting Form
of Government than that of the Church,
or that of <HI>Florence.</HI> But as the Port of
<HI>Genoa</HI> is so very ill guarded against
Storms, that no Privileges can tempt
the Merchants from <HI>Leghorne</HI> into it, so
dare not the <HI>Genoese</HI> make any other of
their Ports Free, least it should draw to
it most of their Commerce and Inhabi∣tants,
and by Consequence ruin their
chief City.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leghorne</HI> I went to <HI>Pisa,</HI> where
there is still the Shell of a great City,
<PB N="808" REF="329"/>
tho' not half furnish'd with Inhabitants.
The Great Church, Baptistery, and
and Leaning Tower are very well worth
seeing, and are built after the same Fan∣cy
with the Cathedral of <HI>Sienna.</HI> Half
a Day's Journey more brought me into
the Republick of <HI>Lucca.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE
REPUBLICK
OF
LVCCA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is very pleasant to see how
the small Territories of this
little Republick are cultiva∣ted
to the best Advantage,
so that one cannot find the
least Spot of Ground, that is not made
to contribute its utmost to the Owner.
In all the Inhabitants there appears an
Air of Chearfulness and Plenty, not of∣ten
to be met with in those of the
Countries which lye about 'em. There
is but one Gate for Strangers to enter
at, that it may be known what Num∣bers
of them are in the Town. Over
it is written in Letters of Gold, <HI>Li∣bertas.</HI></P>
<P>This Republick is shut up in the
Great Duke's Dominions, who at pre∣sent
<PB N="110" REF="331"/>
is very much incensed against it, and
seems to threaten it with the Fate of
<HI>Florence, Pisa,</HI> and <HI>Sienna.</HI> The Oc∣casion
as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lucquese</HI> plead Prescription for
Hunting in one of the Duke's Fo∣rests,
that lyes upon their Frontiers,
which about Two Years since was
strictly forbidden them, the Prince in∣tending
to preserve the Game for his
own Pleasure. Two or Three Sports∣men
of the Republick, who had the
Hardiness to offend against the Prohi∣bition,
were seized, and kept in a neigh∣bouring
Prison. Their Country-men,
to the number of Threescore, attack'd
the Place where they were kept in Cu∣stody,
and rescued them. The Great
Duke redemands his Prisoners, and, as
a further Satisfaction, would have the
Governor of the Town, where the
Threescore Assailants had combined toge∣ther,
deliver'd into his Hands; but re∣ceiving
only Excuses, he resolved to do
himself Justice. Accordingly he order'd
all the <HI>Lucquese</HI> to be seiz'd that were
found on a Market-Day, in one of his
Frontier Towns. These amounted to
Fourscore, among whom were Persons
of some Consequence in the Republick.
They are now in Prison at <HI>Florence,</HI> and
<PB N="111" REF="332"/>
as it is said, treated hardly enough, for
there are Fifteen of the Number dead
within less than Two Years. The King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> who is Protector of the Com∣mon-wealth,
received Information from
the Great Duke of what had pass'd, who
approved of his Proceedings, and order'd
the <HI>Lucquese,</HI> by his Governour or <HI>Mi∣lan,</HI>
to give a proper Satisfaction. The
Republick, thinking themselves ill used
by their Protector, as they say at <HI>Flo∣rence,</HI>
have sent to Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to de∣sire
the Emperor's Protection, with an
offer of Winter-Quarters, as it is said,
for Four Thousand <HI>Germans.</HI> The Great
Duke rises on them in his Demands,
and will not be satisfy'd with less than
a Hundred Thousand Crowns, and a
Solemn Ambassy to beg Pardon for the
past, and promise Amendment for the
future. Thus stands the Affair at pre∣sent,
that may end in the Ruin of the
Common-wealth, if the <HI>French</HI> succeed
in <HI>Italy.</HI> It is pleasant however to hear
the Discourse of the Common People of
<HI>Lucca,</HI> who are firmly persuaded that
One <HI>Lucquese</HI> can beat Five <HI>Florentines,</HI>
who are grown low spirited, as they pre∣tend,
by the Great Duke's Oppressions,
and have nothing worth fighting for.
They say they can bring into the Field
<PB N="312" REF="333"/>
Twenty or Thirty Thousand fighting
Men, all ready to Sacrifice their Lives for
their Liberty. They have Quantity of
Arms and Ammunition, but few Horse.
It must be own'd these People are more
happy, at least in Imagination, than the
rest of their Neighbours, because they
think themselves so; tho' such a Chi∣merical
Happiness is not peculiar to Re∣publicans,
for we find the Subjects of
the most absolute Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> are
as proud of their Monarch as the <HI>Luc∣quese</HI>
of being subject to none. Should
the <HI>French</HI> Affairs prosper in <HI>Italy,</HI> it is
possible the Great Duke may bargain for
the Republick of <HI>Lucca,</HI> by the help of
his great Treasures, as his Predecessors
did formerly with the Emperor for that
of <HI>Sienna.</HI> The Great Dukes have ne∣ver
yet attempted any thing on <HI>Lucca,</HI>
as not only fearing the Arms of their
Protector, but because they are well as∣sured,
that should the <HI>Lucquese</HI> be re∣duced
to the last Extremities, they would
rather throw themselves under the Go∣vernment
of the <HI>Geneose,</HI> or some strong∣er
Neighbour, than submit to a State
for which they have so great an Aver∣sion.
And the <HI>Florentines</HI> are very sen∣sible,
that it is much better having a
weak State within their Dominions,
<PB N="313" REF="334"/>
than the Branch of one as strong as
themselves. But should so formidable a
Power, as that of the <HI>French</HI> King, sup∣port
them in their Attempts, there is
no Government in <HI>Italy</HI> that would
dare to interpose. This Republick, for
the Extent of its Dominions, is estee∣med
the richest and best peopled State
of <HI>Italy.</HI> The whole Administration of
the Government passes into different
Hands at the End of every Two Months,
which is the greatest Security imagina∣ble
to their Liberty, and wonderfully
contributes to the quick Dispatch of all
publick Affairs: But in any Exigence
of State, like that they are now pressed
with, it certainly asks a much longer
time to conduct any Design, for the
Good of the Common-wealth, to its
Maturity and Perfection.</P>

<P>There are some beautiful Palaces it
<HI>Florence</HI>; and as <HI>Tuscan</HI> Pillars and <HI>Ru∣stic</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="336"/>
Work owe their Original to this
Country, the Architects always take care
to give them a Place in the great Edifi∣ces
that are raised in <HI>Tuscany.</HI> The
Duke's new Palace is a very noble Pile,
built after this manner, which makes
it look extremely Solid and Majestick.
It is not unlike that of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> at
<HI>Paris,</HI> which was built by <HI>Mary</HI> of
<HI>Medicis,</HI> and for that Reason perhaps
the Workmen fell into the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Hu∣mour.
I found in the Court of this Pa∣lace
what I could not meet with any
where in <HI>Rome.</HI> I mean an Antique Sta∣tue
of <HI>Hercules</HI> lifting up <HI>Antaeus</HI> from
the Earth, which I have already had
occasion to speak of. It was found in
<HI>Rome,</HI> and brought hither under the
Reign of <HI>Leo</HI> the Tenth. There are
abundance of Pictures in the several A∣partments,
by the Hands of the greatest
Masters.</P>
<P>But 'tis the Famous Gallery of the
Old Palace, where are perhaps the no∣blest
Collections of Curiosities to be
met with in any Part of the whole World.
The Gallery it self is made in the Shape
of an L, according to Mr. <HI>Lassel,</HI> but,
if it must needs be like a Letter, it re∣sembles
the <HI>Greek</HI> Π most. It is adorn∣ed
with admirable Pieces of Sculpture,
<PB N="316" REF="337"/>
as well Modern as Ancient. Of the last
Sort I shall mention those that are rarest,
either for the Person they represent, or
the Beauty of the Sculpture. Among
the Busts of the Emperors and Empe∣resses
there are these that follow, which
are all very scarce, and some of them
almost singular in their kind. <HI>Agrippa,</HI>
<HI>Caligula, Otho, Nerva, Aelius Verus,</HI>
<HI>Pertinax, Geta, Didius, Julianus, Albi∣nus</HI>
extremely well wrought, and what
is seldom seen in Alabaster, <HI>Gordianus
Africanus</HI> the elder, <HI>Eliogabalus, Galien</HI>
the elder, and the younger <HI>Pupienus.</HI> I
have put <HI>Agrippa</HI> among the Emperors,
because he is generally ranged so in Sets
of Medals, as some that follow among
the Emperesses have no other Right to
the Company they are joined with. <HI>Do∣mitia,</HI>
<HI>Agrippina</HI> Wife of <HI>Germanicus,</HI>
<HI>Antonia, Matidia, Plotina, Mallia Scan∣tilla,</HI>
falsely inscribed under her Bust
<HI>Julia Severi, Aquilia Severa, Julia Mae∣sa.</HI>
I have generally observed at <HI>Rome,</HI>
which is the great Magazine of these
Antiquities, that the same Heads which
are rare in Medals are also rare in Mar∣ble,
and indeed one may commonly as∣sign
the same Reason for both, which
was the Shortness of the Emperor
Reigns, that did not give the Work
<PB N="317" REF="338"/>
men time to make many of their Fi∣gures;
and as the Shortness of their
Reigns was generally occasioned by the
Advancement of a Rival, it is no Won∣der
that no Body worked on the Figure
of a Deceased Emperor, when his Ene∣my
was in the Throne. This Observa∣tion
however does not always hold. An
<HI>Agrippa</HI> or <HI>Caligula,</HI> for Example, is a
common Coin, but a very extraordina∣ry
Bust; and a <HI>Tiberius</HI> a rare Coin, but
a common Bust, which one would the
more wonder at, if we consider the In∣dignities
that were offered to this Em∣peror's
Statues after his Death. The
<HI>Tiberius in Tiberim</HI> is a known Instance.</P>
<P>Among the Busts of such Emperors
as are common enough, there are seve∣ral
in the Gallery that deserve to be ta∣ken
notice of for the Excellence of the
Sculpture, as those of <HI>Augustus, Vespa∣sian,</HI>
<HI>Adrian, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius
Verus, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Ge∣ta.</HI>
There is in the same Gallery a beau∣tiful
Bust of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, cast∣ing
up his Face to Heaven, with a no∣ble
Air of Grief or Discontentedness in
his Looks. I have seen Two or Three
antique Busts of <HI>Alexander</HI> in the same
Air and Posture, and am apt to think
the Sculptor had in his Thoughts the
<PB N="318" REF="339"/>
Conqueror's weeping for new Worlds,
or some other the like Circumstance of
his History. There is also in <HI>Porphyry</HI>
the Head of a Faun, and of the God
<HI>Pan.</HI> Among the entire Figures I took
particular notice of a Vestal Virgin,
with the Holy Fire burning before her.
This Statue, I think, may decide that
notable Controversie among the Anti∣quaries,
whether the Vestals, after hav∣ing
received the Tonsure, ever suffered
their Hair to come again, for it is here
full grown, and gathered under the Veil.
The Brazen Figure of the Consul, with
the Ring on his Finger, reminded me
of <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s <HI>majoris pondera Gemmae.</HI>
There is another Statue in Brass, suppo∣sed
to be of <HI>Apollo,</HI> with this Modern
Inscription on the Pedestal, which I
must confess I do not know what to
make of. <HI>Ut potui huc veni musis et fra∣tre
relicto.</HI> I saw in the same Gallery
the Famous Figure of the Wild Boar,
the Gladiator, the <HI>Narcissus,</HI> the <HI>Cupid</HI>
and <HI>Psyche,</HI> the <HI>Flora,</HI> with some Mo∣dern
Statues that several others have de∣scribed.
Among the Antique Figures
there is a fine one of <HI>Morpheus</HI> in Touch∣stone.
I have always observed, that this
God is represented by the ancient Sta∣tuaries
under the Figure of a Boy asleep,
<PB N="319" REF="340"/>
with a Bundle of Poppy in his Hand.
I at first took it for a <HI>Cupid,</HI> 'till I had
taken notice that it had neither Bow nor
Quiver. I suppose Doctor <HI>Lister</HI> has
been guilty of the same Mistake in the
Reflections he makes on what he calls,
the sleeping <HI>Cupid</HI> with Poppy in his
Hands.<Q><L>—Qualia namque</L>
<L>Corpora nudorum tabulâ pinguntur Amo∣rum</L>

<L>A loaden Quiver to his Shoulders tie,</L>
<L>Or bid the <HI>Cupids</HI> lay their Quivers by.</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis probable they chose to represent
the God of Sleep under the Figure of
a Boy, contrary to all our Modern De∣signers,
because it is that Age which
has its Repose the least broken by Cares
and Anxieties. <HI>Statius,</HI> in his celebra∣ted
Invocation of Sleep, addresses him∣self
to him under the same Figure.<Q><PB N="320" REF="341"/>

<P>I never saw any Figure of Sleep that
was not of Black Marble, which has
probably some Relation to the Night,
that is the proper Season for Rest. I
should not have made this Remark, but
that I remember to have read in one of
the ancient Authors, that the <HI>Nile</HI> is
generally represented in Stone of this
Colour, because it flows from the Coun∣try
of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI>; which shows us
that the Statuaries had sometimes an Eye
to the Person they were to represent,
in the Choice they made of their Mar∣ble.
There are still at <HI>Rome</HI> some of
<PB N="321" REF="342"/>
these Black Statues of the <HI>Nile</HI> which
are cut in a kind of Touchstone.<Q><L>Usque coloratis amnis devexus ab Indis.</L><BIBL>Virg. Geor. 4. de Nilo.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>At one End of the Gallery stand Two
antique Marble Pillars, curiously wrought
with the Figures of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Arms
and Instruments of War. After a full
Survey of the Gallery, we were led in∣to
Four or Five Chambers of Curiosities
that stand on the Side of it. The First
was a Cabinet of Antiquities, made up
chiefly of Idols, Talismans, Lamps and
Hieroglyphics. I saw nothing in it that
I was not before acquainted with, except
the Four following Figures in Brass.</P>
<P N="1">I. A little Image of <HI>Juno Sispita,</HI> or
<HI>Sospita,</HI> which perhaps is not to be met
with any where else but on Medals. She
is cloathed in a Goats-skin, the Horns
sticking out above her Head. The Right
Arm is broken that probably supported
a Shield, and the Left a little defac'd,
tho' one may see it held something in its
Grasp formerly. The Feet are bare. I
remember <HI>Tully</HI>'s Description of this
Goddess in the following Words.
<HI>Hercle inquit quàm tibi illam nostram

<P N="2">II. An antique Model of the Famous
<HI>Laocöon</HI> and his Two Sons, that stands
in the <HI>Belvidera</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> This is the
more remarkable, as it is entire in those
Parts where the Statue is maim'd. It was
by the help of this Model that <HI>Ban∣dinelli</HI>
finished his admirable Copy of the
<HI>Laocöon,</HI> which stands at one End of
this Gallery.</P>
<P N="3">III. An <HI>Apollo</HI> or <HI>Amphion.</HI> I took
notice of this little Figure for the Sin∣gularity
of the Instrument, which I
never before saw in ancient Sculpture.
It is not unlike a Violin, and play'd on
after the same manner. I doubt howe∣ever
whether this Figure be not of a
<PB N="323" REF="344"/>
later Date than the rest, by the Mean∣ness
of the Workmanship.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A <HI>Corona Radialis</HI> with only Eight
Spikes to it. Every one knows the usu∣al

<P>The two next Chambers are made up
of several Artificial Curiosities in Ivory,
Amber, Crystal, Marble, and precious
Stones, which all Voyage-Writers are
full of. In the Chamber that is shown
last stands the celebrated <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Medi∣cis.</HI>
The Statue seems much less than
the Life, as being perfectly naked, and
in Company with others of a larger
Make: It is notwithstanding as big as
the ordinary size of a Woman, as I
<PB N="324" REF="345"/>
concluded from the Measure of her
Wrist; for from the Bigness of any one
Part it is easie to guess at all the rest,
in a Figure of such nice Proportions.
The Softness of the Flesh, the Delica∣cy
of the Shape, Air and Posture, and
the Correctness of Design in this Statue
are inexpressible. I have several Rea∣sons
to believe that the Name of the
Sculptor on the Pedestal is not so old
as the Statue. This Figure of <HI>Venus</HI>
put me in Mind of a Speech she makes
in one of the <HI>Greek</HI> Epigrams.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="2 lines" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L><LG>
<L><HI>Anchises, Paris,</HI> and <HI>Adonis</HI> too</L>
<L>Have seen me naked, and expos'd to
view;</L>
<L>All these I frankly own without deny∣ing:</L>
<L>But where has this <HI>Praxiteles</HI> been pry∣ing?</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>There is another <HI>Venus</HI> in the same
Circle, that would make a good Figure
any where else. There are among the old
<HI>Roman</HI> Statues several of <HI>Venus</HI> in different
Postures and Habits, as there are many
particular Figures of her made after the
<PB N="325" REF="346"/>
same Design. I fancy it is not hard to
find among them some that were made
after the Three Statues of this Goddess,
which <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions. In the same
Chamber is the <HI>Roman</HI> Slave whetting
his Knife and listning, which from the
Shoulders upward is incomparable. The
Two Wrestlers are in the same Room.
I observed here likewise a very curious
Bust of <HI>Annius Verus,</HI> the young Son
of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who dy'd at Nine
Years of Age. I have seen several other
Busts of him at <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' his Medals
are exceeding rare.</P>
<P>The Great Duke has ordered a large
Chamber to be fitted up for old Inscrip∣tions,
Urns, Monuments, and the like
Sets of Antiquities. I was shown seve∣ral
of them which are not yet put up.
There are the Two Famous Inscripti∣ons
that give so great a light to the Hi∣stories
of <HI>Appius,</HI> who made the High∣way,
and of <HI>Fabius</HI> the Dictator; they
contain a short Account of the Honours
they pass'd through, and the Actions
they performed. I saw too the Busts of
<HI>Tranquillina,</HI> Mother to <HI>Gordianus Pius,</HI>
and of <HI>Quintus Herennius,</HI> Son to <HI>Trajan
Decius,</HI> which are extremely valuable
for their Rarity, and a beautiful old Fi∣gure
<PB N="326" REF="347"/>
made after the celebrated Herma∣phrodite
in the <HI>Villa Borghese.</HI> I saw
nothing that has not been observed by
several others in the <HI>Argenteria,</HI> the
Tabernacle of St. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s Chapel,
and the Chamber of Painters. The Cha∣pel
of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> will be perhaps the
most costly Piece of Work on the Face
of the Earth when compleated, but it
advances so very slowly, that 'tis not im∣possible
but the Family of <HI>Medicis</HI> may be
Extinct before their Burial Place is
finish'd.</P>
<P>The Great Duke has lived many Years
separate from the Dutchess, who is at
present in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and in∣tends
there to end her Days. The Car∣dinal
his Brother is old and infirm, and
could never be induced to resign his
Purple for the uncertain Prospect of
giving an Heir to the Dukedom of <HI>Tus∣cany.</HI>
The Great Prince has been mar∣ry'd
several Years without any Chil∣dren,
and notwithstanding all the Pre∣cautions
in the World were taken for
the Marriage of the Prince his younger
Brother (as the finding out a Lady for
him who was in the Vigour and Flow∣er
of her Age, and had given Marks of
her Fruitfulness by a former Husband)
they have all hitherto proved unsuccess∣ful.
<PB N="327" REF="348"/>
There is a Branch of the Family of
<HI>Medicis</HI> in <HI>Naples</HI>: The Head of it has been
own'd as a Kinsman by the Grand Duke,
and 'tis thought will succeed to his Do∣minions,
in case the Princes his Sons
die Childless; though 'tis not impossi∣ble
but in such a Conjuncture, the Com∣mon-wealths,
that are thrown under
the Great Dutchy, may make some
Efforts towards the Recovery of their
ancient Liberty.</P>
<P>I was in the Library of Manuscripts
belonging to St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> of which there
is a Printed Catalogue. I look'd into
the <HI>Virgil</HI> which disputes its Antiquity
with that of the <HI>Vatican.</HI> It wants the
<HI>Ille ego qui quondam,</HI> &amp;c. and the Twen∣ty
Two Lines in the Second <HI>Aeneid,</HI>
beginning at <HI>Jamque adeo super unus e∣ram</HI>—I
must confess I always thought
this Passage left out with a great deal of
Judgment by <HI>Tucca</HI> and <HI>Varius,</HI> as it
seems to contradict a Part in the Sixth
<HI>Aeneid,</HI> and represents the Heroe in a
Passion, that is, at least, not at all be∣coming
the Greatness of his Character.
Besides, I think the Apparition of <HI>Ve∣nus</HI>
comes in very properly to draw him
away from the Sight of <HI>Priam</HI>'s Mur∣der;
for without such a Machine to take
him off, I can't see how the Heroe could,
<PB N="328" REF="349"/>
with Honour, leave <HI>Neoptolemus</HI> trium∣phant,
and <HI>Priam</HI> unrevenged. But
since <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Friends thought fit to let
drop this Incident of <HI>Helen,</HI> I wonder
they would not blot out, or alter a
Line in <HI>Venus</HI>'s Speech, that has a Re∣lation
to the Rencounter, and comes in
improperly without it.<Q><L>Non tibi Tyndaridae facies invisa La∣caenae,</L>

<P>The Way from <HI>Florence</HI> to <HI>Bolonia</HI>
runs over several Ranges of Moun∣tains,
and is the worst Road, I be∣lieve,
of any over the <HI>Appennines</HI>; for
this was my Third Time of crossing
them. It gave me a lively Idea of <HI>Si∣lius

<P>We here quickly felt the Difference
of the Northern from the Southern
Side of the Mountains, as well in the
Coldness of the Air, as in the Badness
of the Wine. This Town is Famous
for the Richness of the Soil that lyes
about it, and the Magnificence of its
Convents. It is likewise esteemed the
Third in <HI>Italy</HI> for Pictures, as having
<PB N="333" REF="354"/>
been the School of the <HI>Lombard</HI> Pain∣ters.
I saw in it Three Rarities of dif∣ferent
kinds, which pleased me more
than any other Shows of the Place. The
first was an Authentick Silver Medal of
the younger <HI>Brutus,</HI> in the Hands of an
Eminent Antiquary. One may see the
Character of the Person in the Features
of the Face, which is exquisitely well
cut. On the Reverse is the Cap of Li∣berty,
with a Dagger on each side of it,
subscribed <HI>Id. Mar.</HI> for the Ides of <HI>March,</HI>
the famous Date of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Murder.
The Second was a Picture of <HI>Raphel</HI>'s
in St. <HI>Giouanni</HI> in <HI>Monte.</HI> It is extreme∣ly
well preserved, and represents St. <HI>Ce∣cilia</HI>
with an Instrument of Musick in
her Hands. On one side of her are the
Figures of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>; and
on the other, of <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> and
St. <HI>Austin.</HI> There is something won∣derfully
Divine in the Airs of this Pi∣cture.
I cannot forbear mentioning, for
my Third Curiosity, a new Stair-Case
that Strangers are generally carryed to see,
where the Easiness of the Ascent with∣in
so small a Compass, the Disposition
of the Lights, and the convenient Land∣ing
are admirably well contrived. The
Wars of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Season of the
Year, made me pass thro' the Dutchies
<PB N="334" REF="355"/>
of <HI>Modena, Parma,</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> with
more haste than I would have done at
another time. The Soil of <HI>Modena</HI> and
<HI>Parma</HI> is very rich and well cultivated.
The Palaces of the Princes are magni∣ficent,
but neither of them is yet fini∣shed.
We procured a Licence of the
Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> to enter the Theater
and Gallery, which deserve to be seen
as well as any thing of that Nature in
<HI>Italy.</HI> The Theater is, I think, the
most spacious of any I ever saw, and at
the same time so admirably well contri∣ved,
that from the very depth of the
Stage the lowest Sound may be heard
distinctly to the farthest part of the Au∣dience,
as in a Whispering Place; and
yet if you raise your Voice as high as
you please, there is nothing like an E∣cho
to cause in it the least Confusion.
The Gallery is hung with a numerous
Collection of Pictures, all done by ce∣lebrated
Hands. On one Side of the
Gallery is a large Room adorned with
Inlaid Tables, Cabinets, Works in Am∣ber,
and other Pieces of great Art and
Value. Out of this we were led into
another great Room, furnished with
old Inscriptions, Idols, Busts, Medals,
and the like Antiquities. I could have
spent a Day with great Satisfaction in
<PB N="335" REF="356"/>
this Apartment, but had only time to
pass my Eye over the Medals, which
are in great Number, and many of them
very rare. The scarcest of all is a <HI>Pe∣scennius
Niger</HI> on a Medalion well pre∣served.
It was coined at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where
this Emperor trifled away his Time 'till
he lost his Life and Empire. The Re∣verse
is a <HI>Dea Salus.</HI> There are Two
of <HI>Otho,</HI> the Reverse a <HI>Serapis</HI>; and
Two of <HI>Messalina</HI> and <HI>Poppaea</HI> in mid∣dle
Brass, the Reverses of the Emperor
<HI>Claudius.</HI> I saw Two Medalions of <HI>Plo∣tina</HI>
and <HI>Matidia,</HI> the Reverse to each
a <HI>Pietas</HI>; with Two Medals of <HI>Perti∣nax,</HI>
the Reverse of one <HI>Vota Decenna∣lia,</HI>
and of the other <HI>Diis Custodibus</HI>;
and another of <HI>Gordianus Africanus,</HI> the
Reverse I have forgot.</P>
<P>The Principalities of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Par∣ma</HI>
are much about the same Extent,
and have each of them Two large
Towns, besides a great Number of lit∣tle
Villages. The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> how∣ever
is much richer than the Duke of
<HI>Modena.</HI> Their Subjects would live in
great Plenty amidst so rich and well cul∣tivated
a Soil, were not the Taxes and
Impositions so very Exorbitant; for the
Courts are much too splendid and mag∣nificent
for the Territories that lye a∣bout
<PB N="336" REF="357"/>
them, and one cannot but be ama∣zed
to see such a Profusion of Wealth
laid out in Coaches, Trappings, Tables,
Cabinets, and the like precious Toys,
in which there are few Princes of <HI>Europe</HI>
who equal them, when at the same time
they have not had the Generosity to
make Bridges over the Rivers of their
Countries for the Convenience of their
Subjects, as well as Strangers, who are
forced to pay an unreasonable Exaction
at every Ferry upon the least Rising of
the Waters. A Man might well expect
in these small Governments a much great∣er
Regulation of Affairs, for the Ease
and Benefit of the People, than in large
over-grown States, where the Rules of
Justice, Beneficence, and Mercy may be
easily put out of their Course, in passing
thro' the Hands of Deputies, and a long
Subordination of Officers. And it would
certainly be for the Good of Mankind
to have all the mighty Empires and
Monarchies of the World cantoned out
into petty States and Principalities, that,
like so many large Families, might lye
under the Eye and Observation of their
proper Governors; so that the Care of
the Prince might extend it self to every
individual Person under his Protection.
But since such a general Scheme can
<PB N="337" REF="358"/>
never be brought about, and if it were,
it would quickly be destroyed by the
Ambition of some particular State as∣piring
above the rest, it happens very
ill at present to be born under one of
these petty Soveraigns, that will be still
endeavouring, at his Subjects Cost, to
equal the Pomp and Grandeur of great∣er
Princes, as well as to out-vie those
of his own Rank.</P>
<P>For this Reason there are no People
in the World who live with more Ease
and Prosperity than the Subjects of lit∣tle
Common-wealths, as on the contrary
there are none who suffer more under
the Grievances of a hard Government,
than the Subjects of little Principalities.
I left the Road of <HI>Milan</HI> on my Right
Hand, having before seen that City, and
after having passed through <HI>Asti,</HI> the
Frontier Town of <HI>Savoy,</HI> I at last came
within Sight of the <HI>Po,</HI> which is a fine
River even at <HI>Turin,</HI> though within Six
Miles of its Source. This River has
been made the Scene of Two or Three
Poetical Stories. <HI>Ovid</HI> has chosen it
out to throw his <HI>Phaeton</HI> into it, after
all the smaller Rivers had been dryed up
in the Conflagration.</P>
<P>I have read some Botanical Criticks,
who tell us the Poets have not rightly
<PB N="338" REF="359"/>
followed the Traditions of Antiquity
in Metamorphosing the Sisters of <HI>Phae∣ton</HI>
into Poplars, who ought to have
been turned into Larch-trees; for that
it is this kind of Tree which sheds a
Gum, and is commonly found on the
Banks of the <HI>Po.</HI> The Change of <HI>Cyc∣nus</HI>
into a Swan, which closes up the
Disasters of <HI>Phaeton</HI>'s Family, was
wrought on the same Place where the
Sisters were turned into Trees. The
Descriptions that <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> have
made of it cannot be sufficiently admi∣red.</P>

<P>The River <HI>Po</HI> gives a Name to the
chief Street of <HI>Turin,</HI> which fronts the
Duke's Palace, and, when finish'd, will
be one of the noblest in <HI>Italy</HI> for its
Length. There is one Convenience in
this City that I never observed in any
<PB N="341" REF="362"/>
other, and which makes some amends
for the Badness of the Pavement. By
the help of a River, that runs on the
upper Side of the Town, they can con∣vey
a little Stream of Water through
all the most considerable Streets, which
serves to cleanse the Gutters, and carries
away all the Filth that is swept into it.
The Manager opens his Sluce every
Night, and distributes the Water into
what Quarters of the Town he pleases.
Besides the ordinary Convenience that
arises from it, it is of great use when a
Fire chances to break out, for at a few
Minutes warning they have a little Ri∣ver
running by the very Walls of the
House that is Burning. The Court of
<HI>Turin</HI> is reckoned the most splendid and
Polite of any in <HI>Italy</HI>; but by reason
of its being in Mourning, I could not
see it in its Magnificence. The com∣mon
People of this State are more ex∣asperated
against the <HI>French</HI> than even
the rest of the <HI>Italians.</HI> For the great
Mischiefs they have suffered from them
are still fresh upon their Memories, and
notwithstanding this Interval of Peace,
one may easily trace out the several Mar∣ches
which the <HI>French</HI> Armies have made
through their Country, by the Ruin
and Desolation they have left behind
<PB N="342" REF="363"/>
them. I passed through <HI>Piemont</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI>
at a time when the Duke was forced,
by the Necessity of his Affairs, to be in
Alliance with the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I came directly from <HI>Turin</HI> to <HI>Gene∣va,</HI>
and had a very easie Journey over
Mount <HI>Cennis,</HI> though about the Begin∣ning
of <HI>December,</HI> the Snows having not
yet fallen. On the Top of this high
Mountain is a large Plain, and in the
midst of the Plain a beautiful Lake, which
would be very extraordinary were there
not several Mountains in the Neighbour∣hood
rising over it. The Inhabitants there∣about
pretend that it is unfathomable,
and I question not but the Waters of it
fill up a deep Valley, before they come
to a Level with the Surface of the Plain.
It is well stocked with Trouts, though
they say it is covered with Ice Three
Quarters of the Year.</P>
<P>There is nothing in the natural Face
of <HI>Italy</HI> that is more delightful to a Tra∣veller,
than the several Lakes which are
dispersed up and down among the ma∣ny
Breaks and Hollows of the <HI>Alps</HI> and
<HI>Appennines.</HI> For as these vast Heaps of
Mountains are thrown together with so
much Irregularity and Confusion, they
form a great Variety of hollow Bot∣toms,
that often lye in the Figure of
<PB N="343" REF="364"/>
so many artificial Basins; where, if any
Fountains chance to rise, they naturally
spread themselves into Lakes before they
can find any Issue for their Waters.
The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> took a great deal
of Pains to hew out a Passage for these
Lakes to discharge themselves into some
neighbouring River, for the bettering
of the Air, or the recovering of the
Soil that lay underneath them. The
Draining of the <HI>Fucinus</HI> by the Empe∣ror
<HI>Claudius,</HI> with the prodigious Mul∣titude
of Spectators who attended it,
and the Famous <HI>Naumachia</HI> and splendid
Entertainment which were made upon
it before the Sluces were opened, is a
known Piece of History. In all our
Journey through the <HI>Alps,</HI> as well when
we climbed as when we descended them,
we had still a River running along with
the Road, that probably at first occasi∣oned
the Discovery of this Passage. I
shall end this Chapter with a Descripti∣on
of the <HI>Alps,</HI> as I did the last with
those of the <HI>Appennines.</HI> The Poet per∣haps
would not have taken notice, that
there is no Spring nor Summer on these
Mountains, but because in this Respect
the <HI>Alps</HI> are quite different from the
<HI>Appennines,</HI> which have as delightful
Green Spots among them as any in <HI>Italy.</HI><Q><PB N="344" REF="365"/>

<HEAD>GENEVA
AND THE
LAKE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EAR St. <HI>Julian</HI> in <HI>Savoy</HI> the
<HI>Alps</HI> begin to enlarge them∣selves
on all sides, and open
into a vast Circuit of Ground,
which in Respect of the o∣ther
Parts of the <HI>Alps</HI> may pass for a plain
Champian Country. This Extent of
Lands, with the <HI>Leman</HI> Lake, would make
one of the prettiest and most defensible
Dominions in <HI>Europe</HI> was it all thrown
into a single State, and had <HI>Geneva</HI> for
its Metropolis. But there are Three
powerful Neighbours who divide among
them the greatest part of this fruitful
Country. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has the
<HI>Chablais,</HI> and all the Fields that lye be∣yond
the <HI>Arve,</HI> as far as to the <HI>Ecluse.</HI>
The King of <HI>France</HI> is Master of the
whole Country of <HI>Gex</HI>; and the Canton of
<PB N="347" REF="368"/>
<HI>Bern</HI> comes in for that of <HI>Vaud. Gene∣va</HI>
and its little Territories lye in the
Heart of these Three States. The great∣est
part of the Town stands upon a Hill,
and has its Views bounded on all Sides by
several Ranges of Mountains, which are
however at so great a Distance, that
they leave open a wonderful Variety of
beautiful Prospects. The Situation of
these Mountains has some particular Ef∣fects
on the Country, which they en∣close.
As first, they cover it from all
Winds, except the South and North.
'Tis to the last of these Winds that the
Inhabitants of <HI>Geneva</HI> ascribe the Health∣fulness
of their Air; for as the <HI>Alps</HI> sur∣round
them on all sides, they form a vast
kind of Bason, where there would be a
constant Stagnation of Vapours, the
Country being so well water'd, did not
the North Wind put them in Motion,
and scatter them from time to time.
Another Effect the <HI>Alps</HI> have on <HI>Ge∣neva</HI>
is, that the Sun here rises later,
and sets sooner than it does to other
Places of the same Latitude. I have
often observed that the Tops of the
neighbouring Mountains have been co∣vered
with Light above half an Hour
after the Sun is down, in respect of
those who live at <HI>Geneva.</HI> These Moun∣tains
<PB N="348" REF="369"/>
likewise very much increase their
Summer Heats, and make up a Hori∣zon
that has something in it very sin∣gular
and agreeable. On one Side you
have the long Tract of Hills, that goes
under the Name of Mount <HI>Jura,</HI> co∣vered
with Vineyards and Pasturage, and
on the other huge Precipices of naked
Rocks rising up in a Thousand odd Fi∣gures,
and cleft in some Places, so as to
discover high Mountains of Snow that
lye several Leagues behind them. Towards
the South the Hills rise more insensibly,
and leave the Eye a vast uninterrupted
Prospect for many Miles. But the most
beautiful View of all is the Lake, and
the Borders of it that lye North of the
Town.</P>
<P>This Lake resembles a Sea in the Co∣lour
of its Waters, the Storms that are
raised on it, and the Ravage it makes on
its Banks. It receives too a different
Name from the Coasts it washes, and in
Summer has something like an Ebb and
Flow, which arises from the melting of
the Snows that fall into it more copious∣ly
at Noon, than at other times of the
Day. It has Five different States bor∣dering
on it, the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI>
the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Canton of
<HI>Bern,</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Sion,</HI> and the
<PB N="349" REF="370"/>
Republick of <HI>Geneva.</HI> I have seen Pa∣pers
fix'd up in the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> with
this magnificent Preface; <HI>Whereas we
have been informed of several Abuses com∣mitted
in our Ports and Harbours on the
Lake,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I made a little Voyage round the Lake,
and touch'd on the several Towns that
lye on its Coasts, which took up near
Five Days, tho' the Wind was pretty
fair for us all the while.</P>
<P>The Right Side of the Lake from
<HI>Geneva</HI> belongs to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and
is extreamly well cultivated. The great∣est
Entertainment we found in coasting
it were the several Prospects of Woods,
Vineyards, Meadows, and Corn-Fields
which lye on the Borders of it, and run
up all the Sides of the <HI>Alps,</HI> where the
Barrenness of the Rocks, or the Steep∣ness
of the Ascent will suffer them.
The Wine however on this side of the
Lake is by no means so good as that
on the other, as it has not so open a Soil,
and is less expos'd to the Sun. We here
pass'd by <HI>Yvoire,</HI> where the Duke keeps his
Gallies, and lodg'd at <HI>Tonon,</HI> which is the
greatest Town on the Lake belonging to
the <HI>Savoyard.</HI> It has Four Convents,
and they say about six or seven Thou∣sand
Inhabitants. The Lake is here about
Twelve Miles in Breadth. At a little
<PB N="350" REF="371"/>
Distance from <HI>Tonon</HI> stands <HI>Ripaille,</HI> where
is a Convent of <HI>Carthusians.</HI> They have
a large Forest cut out into Walks, that are
extremely thick and gloomy, and very
suitable to the Genius of the Inhabitants.
There are <HI>Vista</HI>'s in it of a great Length,
that terminate upon the Lake. At one
Side of the Walks you have a near Pro∣spect
of the <HI>Alps,</HI> which are broken in∣to
so many Steps and Precipices, that they
fill the Mind with an agreeable kind of
Horror, and form one of the most ir∣regular
mis-shapen Scenes in the World.
The House that is now in the Hands of
the <HI>Carthusians</HI> belong'd formerly to the
Hermites of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> and is famous
in History for the Retreat of an
Anti-Pope, who call'd himself <HI>Felix</HI> the
Fifth. He had been Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI>
and after a very glorious Reign took on
him the Habit of a Hermite, and retired
into this Solitary Spot of his Domini∣ons.
His Enemies will have it, that he
lived here in great Ease and Luxury,
from whence the <HI>Italians</HI> to this Day
make use of the Proverb, <HI>Andare a Ri∣paglia</HI>;
and the <HI>French, Faire Ripaille,</HI> to
express a delightful kind of Life. They
say too, that he had great Managements
with several Eccelesiasticks before he
turned Hermite, and that he did it in
the View of being advanced to the Pon∣tificate.
<PB N="351" REF="372"/>
However it was, he had not
been here half a Year before he was cho∣sen
Pope by the Council of <HI>Basil</HI> who
took upon them to Depose <HI>Eugenio</HI> the
Fourth. This promised fair at first, but
by the Death of the Emperor, who fa∣voured
<HI>Amadeo,</HI> and the Resolution of
<HI>Eugenio,</HI> the greatest part of the Church
threw it self again under the Govern∣ment
of their deposed Head. Our An∣ti-Pope
however was still supported by
the Council of <HI>Basil,</HI> and owned by <HI>Sa∣voy,</HI>
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> and a few other little
States. This Schism lasted in the Church
Nine Years, after which <HI>Felix</HI> voluntarily
resigned his Title into the Hands of Pope
<HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth, but on the following
Conditions, That <HI>Amadeo</HI> should be the
First Cardinal in the Conclave; That
the Pope should always receive him
standing, and offer him his Mouth to
kiss; That he should be perpetual Car∣dinal-Legate
in the States of <HI>Savoy</HI> and
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> and in the Archbishopricks
of <HI>Geneva, Sion, Bress,</HI> &amp;c. And last∣ly,
That all the Cardinals of his Crea∣tion
should be recognized by the Pope.
After he had made a Peace so acceptable
to the Church, and so honourable to
himself, he spent the Remainder of his
Life with great Devotion at <HI>Ripaille,</HI>
<PB N="352" REF="373"/>
and dy'd with an extraordinary Repu∣tation
of Sanctity.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tonon</HI> they showed us a Fountain
of Water that is in great Esteem for its
Wholesomness. They say it weights
Two Ounces in a Pound less than the
same Measure of the Lake Water, not∣withstanding
this last is very good to
Drink, and as clear as can be imagined.
A little above <HI>Tonon</HI> is a Castle and small
Garrison. The next Day we saw other
small Towns on the Coast of <HI>Sa∣voy,</HI>
where there is nothing but Misery
and Poverty. The nearer you come to
the End of the Lake the Mountains on
each side grow thicker and higher, 'till
at last they almost meet. One often sees
on the Tops of the Mountains several
sharp Rocks that stand above the rest;
for as these Mountains have been doubt∣less
much higher than they are at pre∣sent,
the Rains have washed away a∣bundance
of the Soil, that has left the
Veins of Stone shooting out of them;
as in a decay'd Body the Flesh is still
shrinking from the Bones. The Natu∣ral
Histories of <HI>Switzerland</HI> talk very
much of the Fall of these Rocks, and
the great Damage they have sometimes
done, when their Foundations have been
mouldered with Age, or rent by an
Earthquake. We saw in several Parts
<PB N="353" REF="374"/>
of the <HI>Alps</HI> that bordered upon us vast
Pits of Snow, as several Mountains that
lye at a greater Distance are wholly co∣vered
with it. I fancy'd the Confusion
of Mountains and Hollows, I here ob∣served,
furnished me with a more proba∣ble
Reason than any I have met with for
those Periodical Fountains in <HI>Switzer∣land,</HI>
which flow only at such particular
Hours of the Day. For as the Tops of
these Mountains cast their Shadows upon
one another, they hinder the Sun's shining
on several Parts at such certain times, so
that there are several Heaps of Snow which
have the Sun lying upon them Two or
Three Hours together, and are in the
Shade all the Day afterwards. If there∣fore
it happens that any particular Foun∣tain
takes its Rise from any of these Re∣servoirs
of Snow, it will naturally begin
to flow on such Hours of the Day as
the Snow begins to melt: but as soon as
the Sun leaves it again to freeze and
harden, the Fountain dries up, and re∣ceives
no more Supplies 'till about the
same time the next Day, when the Heat
of the Sun again sets the Snows a run∣ning
that fall into the same little Con∣duits,
Traces, and Canals, and by Con∣sequence
break out and discover them∣selves
always in the same Place. At the
<PB N="354" REF="375"/>
very Extremity of the Lake the <HI>Rhone</HI>
enters, and, when I saw it, brought a∣long
with it a prodigious Quantity of
Water; the Rivers and Lakes of this
Country being much higher in Summer
than in Winter, by reason of the melt∣ing
of the Snows. One would wonder
how so many Learned Men could fall
into so great an Absurdity, as to believe
this River could preserve it self unmix'd
with the Lake 'till its going out again
at <HI>Geneva,</HI> which is a Course of many
Miles. It was extreamly muddy at its
Entrance when I saw it, though as clear
as Rock-Water at its going out. Be∣sides,
that it brought in much more Wa∣ter
than it carryed off. The River in∣deed
preserves it self for about a Quar∣ter
of a Mile in the Lake, but is af∣terwards
so wholly mixed, and lost with
the Waters of the Lake, that one dis∣covers
nothing like a Stream 'till within
about a Quarter of a Mile of <HI>Geneva.</HI>
From the End of the Lake to the Source
of the <HI>Rhone</HI> is a Valley of about Four
Days Journey in Length, which gives
the Name of <HI>Vallesins</HI> to its Inhabitants,
and is the Dominion of the Bishop of
<HI>Sion.</HI> We lodged the Second Night at
<HI>Ville Neuve,</HI> a little Town in the Can∣ton
of <HI>Bern,</HI> where we found good Ac∣commodations,
<PB N="355" REF="376"/>
and a much greater Ap∣pearance
of Plenty than on the other
side of the Lake. The next Day, hav∣ing
passed by the Castle of <HI>Chillon,</HI> we
came to <HI>Versoy,</HI> another Town in the
Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> where <HI>Ludlow</HI> retired
after having left <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Lausanne.</HI>
The Magistrates of the Town warned
him out of the First by the Sollicitation
of the Dutchess of <HI>Orleans,</HI> as the Death
of his Friend <HI>Lisle</HI> made him quit the o∣ther.
He probably chose this Retreat
as a Place of the greatest Safety, it be∣ing
an easie matter to know what Stran∣gers
are in the Town, by Reason of its
Situation. The House he lived in has
this Inscription over the Door:
<Q>Omne solum forti patria
quia patris.</Q>
The first Part is a Piece of a Verse in
<HI>Ovid,</HI> as the last is a Cant of his own.
He is buryed in the best of the Churches

The Inhabitants of the
Place could give no Account of this
<HI>Broughton,</HI> but, I suppose, by his Epi∣taph,
it is the same Person that was
Clerk to the pretended High Court of
Justice, which passed Sentence on the
Royal Martyr.</P>
<P>The next Day we spent at <HI>Lausanne,</HI>
the greatest Town on the Lake, after
<HI>Geneva.</HI> We saw the Wall of the Ca∣thedral
Church that was opened by an
Earthquake, and shut again some Years
after by a Second. The Crack can but
be just discerned at present, though there
are several in the Town still living who
have formerly passed through it. The
Duke of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who was killed in
<HI>Savoy,</HI> lyes in this Church, but without
any Monument or Inscription over him.
<HI>Lausanne</HI> was once a Republick, but is
now under the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> and go∣verned,
<PB N="358" REF="379"/>
like the rest of their Dominions,
by a Baily who is sent them every Three
Years from the Senate of <HI>Bern.</HI> There
is one Street of this Town that has the
Privilege of acquitting or condemning
any Person of their own Body, in Mat∣ters
of Life and Death. Every Inha∣bitant
of it has his Vote, which makes
a House here sell better than in any o∣ther
Part of the Town. They tell you
that not many Years ago it happened,
that a Cobler had the Casting Vote for
the Life of a Criminal, which he very
graciously gave on the merciful Side.
From <HI>Lausanne</HI> to <HI>Geneva</HI> we coasted a∣long
the Country of the <HI>Vaud,</HI> which
is the fruitfullest and best cultivated Part
of any among the <HI>Alps.</HI> It belonged for∣merly
to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but was
won from him by the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI>
and made over to it by the Treaty of St.
<HI>Julian,</HI> which is still very much regret∣ted
by the <HI>Savoyard.</HI> We called in at
<HI>Morge,</HI> where there is an artificial Port,
and a show of more Trade than in any
other Town on the Lake. From <HI>Morge</HI>
we came to <HI>Nyon.</HI> The <HI>Colonia E∣questris,</HI>
that <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> settled in this
Country, is generally supposed to have
been planted in this Place. They have
often dug up old <HI>Roman</HI> Inscriptions
<PB N="359" REF="380"/>
and Statues, and as I walked in the Town
I observed in the Walls of several Houses
the Fragments of vast <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars,
with several other Pieces of Architecture,
which must have formerly belonged to
some very Noble Pile of Building. There
is no Author that mentions this Colo∣ny,
yet it is certain by several old <HI>Roman</HI>
Inscriptions that there was such an one.
<HI>Lucan</HI> indeed speaks of a Part of <HI>Cae∣sar</HI>'s
Army, that came to him from the
<HI>Leman</HI> Lake in the beginning of the
Civil War.<Q>Deseruere cavo tentoria fixa Lemanno.</Q></P>
<P>At about Five Miles distance from
<HI>Nyon</HI> they show still the Ruins of <HI>Cae∣sar</HI>'s
Wall, that reached eighteen Miles
in Length from Mount <HI>Jura</HI> to the
Borders of the Lake, as he has descri∣bed
it in the First Book of his Com∣mentaries.
The next Town upon the
Lake is <HI>Versoy,</HI> which we could not
have an opportunity of seeing, as belong∣ing
to the King of <HI>France.</HI> It has the
Reputation of being extremely poor and
beggarly. We sailed from hence di∣rectly
for <HI>Geneva,</HI> which makes a very
noble Show from the Lake. There are
near <HI>Geneva</HI> several Quarries of Free∣stone
<PB N="360" REF="381"/>
that run under the Lake. When
the Water is at lowest they make with∣in
the Borders of it a little Square en∣closed
with Four Walls. In this Square
they sink a Pit, and dig for Freestone;
the Walls hindering the Waters from
coming in upon them, when the Lake
rises and runs on all Sides of them. The
great Convenience of Carriage makes
these Stones much cheaper than any
that can be found upon firm Land.
One sees several deep Pits that have been
made at several times as one sails over
them. As the Lake approaches <HI>Geneva</HI>
it grows still narrower and narrower,
'till at last it changes its Name into the
<HI>Rhone,</HI> that turns all the Mills of the
Town, and is extremely rapid, notwith∣standing
its Waters are very deep. As
I have seen a great Part of the Course
of this River, I cannot but think it has
been guided by the particular Hand of
Providence. It rises in the very Heart
of the <HI>Alps,</HI> and has a long Valley that
seems hewn out on purpose to give its
Waters a Passage amidst so many Rocks
and Mountains which are on all Sides
of it. This brings it almost in a direct
Line to <HI>Geneva.</HI> It would there over∣flow
all the Country, were there not
one particular Cleft that divides a vast
<PB N="361" REF="382"/>
Circuit of Mountains, and conveys it off
to <HI>Lyons.</HI> From <HI>Lyons</HI> there is another
great Rent, which runs across the whole
Country in almost another streight Line,
and notwithstanding the vast height of
the Mountains that rise about it, gives
it the shortest Course it can take to fall
into the Sea. Had such a River as this
been left to it self to have found its way
out from among the <HI>Alps,</HI> whatever
Windings it had made it must have for∣med
several little Seas, and have laid ma∣ny
Countries under Water before it had
come to the End of its Course. I shall
not make any Remarks upon <HI>Geneva,</HI>
that is a Republick so well known to
the <HI>English.</HI> It lyes at present under
some Difficulties by reason of the Em∣peror's
Displeasure, who has forbidden
the Importation of their Manufactures
into any Part of the Empire, which
will certainly raise a Sedition among the
People, unless the Magistrates find some
way to remedy it: and they say it is al∣ready
done by the Interposition of the
States of <HI>Holland.</HI> The Occasion of the
Emperor's Prohibition was their furnish∣ing
great Sums to the King of <HI>France</HI>
for the Payment of his Army in <HI>Italy.</HI>
They obliged themselves to remit, after
the rate of Twelve Hundred Thousand
<PB N="362" REF="383"/>
Pounds Sterling, <HI>per Annum,</HI> divided in∣to
so many Monthly Payments. As the
Interest was very great, several of the
Merchants of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who would not
trust their King in their own Names,
are said to have contributed a great
deal under the Names of <HI>Geneva</HI>
Merchants. The Republick fancies
it self hardly treated by the Em∣peror,
since it is not any Action of the
State, but a Compact among private
Persons that hath furnished out these se∣veral
Remittances. They pretend how∣ever
to have put a stop to them, and by
that means are in hopes again to open
their Commerce into the Empire.</P>

which is but a mean
Town for the Capital of so
large a Canton: Its Situati∣on
is so irregular, that they are forced
to climb up to several Parts of it by
Stair-Cases of a prodigious Ascent. This
Inconvenience however gives them a ve∣ry
great Commodity in case a Fire breaks
out in any Part of the Town, for by
reason of several Reservoirs on the Tops
of these Mountains, by the opening of
a Sluce they convey a River into what
Part of the Town they please. They
have Four Churches, Four Convents of
Women, and as many for Men. The
little Chappel, called the <HI>Salutation,</HI> is
very neat, and built with a pretty Fancy.
The College of Jesuits is, they say, the
finest in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> There is a great
<PB N="364" REF="385"/>
deal of Room in it, and several beauti∣ful
Views from the different Parts of it.
They have a Collection of Pictures re∣presenting
most of the Fathers of their

their Piety or Learning. Among the

either by Force or Promises, to change
his Religion, they Hanged and Quarte∣red
him. At the <HI>Capucins</HI> I saw the Es∣cargatoire,
which I took the more no∣tice
of because I do not remember to
have met with any thing of the same in
other Countries. It is a square Place
boarded in, and filled with a vast quan∣tity
of large Snails, that are esteemed
excellent Food when they are well dres∣sed.
The Floor is strowed about half a
Foot deep with several kinds of Plants,
among which the Snails nestle all the
Winter Season. When <HI>Lent</HI> arrives they
open their Magazines, and take out of
them the best meagre Food in the
World, for there is no Dish of Fish
that they reckon comparable to a Ra∣goût
of Snails.</P>
<P>About Two Leagues from <HI>Fribourg</HI>
we went to see a Hermitage, that is
<PB N="365" REF="386"/>
reckon'd the greatest Curiosity of these
Parts. It lyes in the prettiest Solitude
imaginable, among Woods and Rocks,
which at first Sight dispose a Man to be
serious. There has lived in it a Hermite
these Five and Twenty Years, who with
his own Hands has worked in the Rock
a pretty Chappel, a Sacristie, a Chamber,
Kitchin, Cellar, and other Convenien∣ces.
His Chimney is carry'd up through
the whole Rock, so that you see
the Sky through it, notwithstanding
the Rooms lye very deep. He has cut
the Side of the Rock into a Flat for a
Garden, and by laying on it the waste
Earth that he has found in several of
the neighbouring Parts, has made such
a Spot of Ground of it as furnishes out
a kind of Luxury for a Hermite. As
he saw Drops of Water distilling from
several Parts of the Rock, by following
the Veins of them, he has made him∣self
Two or Three Fountains in the
Bowels of the Mountain, that serve his
Table, and water his little Garden.</P>
<P>We had very bad Ways from hence
to <HI>Bern,</HI> a great Part of them through
Woods of Fir-trees. The great Quan∣tity
of Timber they have in this Coun∣try
makes them mend their High-ways
with Wood instead of Stone. I could
<PB N="366" REF="387"/>
not but take notice of the Make of se∣veral
of their Barns I here saw. After
having laid a Frame of Wood for the
Foundation, they place at the Four
Corners of it Four huge Blocks; cut
in such a Shape as neither Mice nor a∣ny
other sort of Vermin can creep up
the Sides of them, at the same time that
they raise the Corn above the Moisture
that might come into it from the Ground.
The whole weight of the Barn is sup∣ported
by these Four Blocks.</P>
<P>What pleased me most at <HI>Bern</HI> was
their publick Walks by the Great
Church. They are raised extremely
high, and that their Weight might not
break down the Walls and Pilasters
which surround them, they are built
upon Arches and Vaults. Tho' they are,
I believe, as high as most Steeples in
<HI>England</HI> from the Streets and Gardens
that lye at the Foot of them, yet about
Forty Years ago a Person in his Drink
fell down from the very Top to the Bot∣tom,
without doing himself any other
Hurt than the Breaking of an Arm.
He dy'd about Four Years ago. There
is the noblest Summer-Prospect in the
World from this Walk, for you have
a full View of a huge Range of Moun∣tains
that lye in the Country of the <HI>Gri∣sons,</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="388"/>
and are bury'd in Snow. They
are about Twenty Five Leagues distance
from the Town, though by Reason of
their Height and their Colour they seem
much nearer. The Cathedral Church
stands on one side of these Walks, and
is perhaps the most Magnificent of any
Protestant Church in <HI>Europe</HI> out of
<HI>England.</HI> It is a very bold Work, and
a Master-piece in <HI>Gothic</HI> Architecture.</P>
<P>I saw the Arsenal of <HI>Bern,</HI> where
they say there are Arms for Twenty
Thousand Men. There is indeed no
great Pleasure in visiting these Maga∣zines
of War after one has seen Two
or Three of them, yet it is very well
worth a Traveller's while to look into
all that lye in his Way; for besides the
Idea it gives him of the Forces of a
State, it serves to fix in his Mind the
most considerable Parts of its History.
Thus in that of <HI>Geneva</HI> one meets with
the Ladders, Petard, and other Utensils
which were made use of in their Fa∣mous
Escalade, besides the Weapons they
took of the <HI>Savoyards, Florentines,</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> in the several Battels mentioned
in their History. In this of <HI>Bern</HI> you
have the Figure and Armour of the
Count who founded the Town, of the
Famous <HI>Tell,</HI> who is represented as shoot∣ing
<PB N="368" REF="389"/>
at the Apple on his Son's Head.
The Story is too well known to be re∣peated
in this Place. I here likewise
saw the Figure and Armour of him that
headed the Peasants in the War upon
<HI>Bern,</HI> with the several Weapons which
were found in the Hands of his Follow∣ers.
They show too abundance of Arms
that they took from the <HI>Burgundians</HI> in the
Three great Battels which establish'd
them in their Library, and destroy'd the
Great Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> himself, with
the bravest of his Subjects. I saw no∣thing
remarkable in the Chambers where
the Council meet, nor in the Fortifica∣tions
of the Town. These last were
made on Occasion of the Peasants In∣surrection,
to defend the Place for the
future against the like sudden Assaults.
In their Liberty I observed a couple of
antique Figures in Metal, of a Priest
pouring Wine between the Horns of a
Bull. The Priest is veil'd after the
manner of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Sacrificers, and
is represented in the same Action that
<HI>Virgil</HI> describes in the Third <HI>Aeneid.</HI><Q><L>Ipsa tenens dextrâ pateram pulcherrima
Dido</L>
<L>Candentis vaccae media inter cornua fun∣dit.</L></Q><PB N="369" REF="390"/>
This Antiquity was found at <HI>Lausanne.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Bern</HI> is plentifully fur∣nish'd
with Water, there being a great
Multitude of handsome Fountains plan∣ted
at set Distances from one End of the
Streets to the other. There is indeed
no Country in the World better sup∣ply'd
with Water, than the several Parts
of <HI>Switzerland</HI> that I travell'd through.
One meets every where in the Roads
with Fountains continually running in∣to
huge Troughs that stand underneath
them, which is wonderfully commodi∣ous
in a Country that so much abounds
with Horses and Cattle. It has so ma∣ny
Springs breaking out of the Sides of
the Hills, and such vast Quantities of
Wood to make Pipes of, that it is no
Wonder they are so well stock'd with
Fountains.</P>
<P>On the Road between <HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>So∣leurre</HI>
there is a Monument erected by the
Republick of <HI>Bern,</HI> which tells us the
Story of an <HI>English</HI> Man, who is not to
be met with in any of our own Wri∣ters.
The Inscription is in <HI>Latin</HI> Verse
on one side of the Stone, and in <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
on the other. I had not Time to
Copy it, but the Substance of it is this.<Q>One <HI>Cussinus,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man, to
whom the Duke of <HI>Austria</HI> had giv∣en
<PB N="370" REF="391"/>
his Sister in Marriage, came to
take her from among the <HI>Swiss</HI> by
Force of Arms, but after having ra∣vaged
the Country for some time, he
was here overthrown by the Can∣ton
of <HI>Bern.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Soleurre</HI> is our next considerable Town,
that seemed to me to have a greater Air
of Politeness than any I saw in <HI>Switzer∣land.</HI>
The <HI>French</HI> Ambassador has his
Residence in this Place. His Master
contributed a great Sum of Mony to
the Jesuits Church, which is not yet quite
finished. It is the finest Modern Build∣ing
in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The old Cathedral
Church stood not far from it. At the
Ascent that leads to it are a couple of an∣tique
Pillars which belonged to an old
Heathen Temple, Dedicated to <HI>Hermes</HI>:
They seem <HI>Tuscan</HI> by their Proportion.
The whole Fortification of <HI>Soleurre</HI> is
faced with Marble. But its best Forti∣fications
are the high Mountains that
lye within its Neighbourhood, and sepa∣rate
it from the <HI>Franche Comptè.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day's Journey carry'd us
through other Parts of the Canton of
<HI>Bern,</HI> to the little Town of <HI>Meldingen.</HI>
I was surprised to find in all my Road
through <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the Wine that
grows in the Country of <HI>Vaud</HI> on the
<PB N="371" REF="392"/>
Borders of the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> which
is very cheap, notwithstanding the great
Distance between the Vineyards and the
Towns that sell the Wine. But the Na∣vigable
Rivers of <HI>Switzerland</HI> are as
commodious to them in this Respect, as
the Sea is to the <HI>English.</HI> As soon as
the Vintage is over, they Ship off their
Wine upon the Lake, which furnishes
all the Towns that lye upon its Borders.
What they design for other Parts of the
Country they unload at <HI>Very,</HI> and after
about half a Day's Land-Carriage con∣vey
it into the River <HI>Aar,</HI> which brings
it down the Stream to <HI>Bern, Soleurre,</HI>
and, in a Word, distributes it through
all the richest Parts of <HI>Switzerland</HI>; as
it is easie to guess from the first sight of
the Map, which shows us the natural
Communication Providence has formed
between the many Rivers and Lakes of a
Country that is at so great a distance from
the Sea. The Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> is rec∣koned
as powerful as all the rest together.
They can send a Hundred Thousand Men
into the Field; tho' the Soldiers of the
Catholick Cantons, who are much poor∣er,
and therefore forced to enter oftner
into Foreign Armies, are more esteemed
than the Protestants.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="393"/>
We lay one Night at <HI>Meldingen,</HI> which
is a little <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Town with
one Church, and no Convent. It is a
Republick of it self under the Protecti∣on
of the Eight ancient Cantons. There
are in it a Hundred Bourgeois, and about
a Thousand Souls. Their Government
is modelled after the same manner with
that of the Cantons, as much as so small
a Community can imitate those of so
large an Extent. For this Reason though
they have very little Business to do, they
have all the Variety of Councils and Of∣ficers
that are to be met with in the
greater States. They have a Town-House
to meet in, adorn'd with the Arms
of the Eight Cantons their Protectors.
They have Three Councils, the Great
Council of Fourteen, the Little Coun∣cil
of Ten, and the Privy Council of
Three. The chief of the State are the
Two Avoyers: When I was there the
Reigning Avoyer, or Doge of the Com∣monwealth,
was Son to the Inn where
I was lodged. His Father having enjoy'd
the same Honours before him. His Re∣venue
amounts to about Thirty Pound a
Year. The several Councils meet every
<HI>Thursday</HI> upon Affairs of State, such as
the Reparation of a Trough, the mend∣ing
of a Pavement, or any the like
<PB N="373" REF="394"/>
Matters of Importance. The River that
runs through their Dominions puts them
to the Charge of a very large Bridge,
that is all made of Wood, and coped
over Head, like the rest in <HI>Switzerland.</HI>
Those that travel over it pay a certain
Due towards the Maintenance of this
Bridge. And as the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador
has often occasion to pass this way, his
Master gives the Town a Pension of
Twenty Pound Sterling, which makes
them extremely industrious to raise all
the Men they can for his Service, and
keeps this powerful Republick firm to
the <HI>French</HI> Interest. You may be sure
the Preserving of the Bridge, with
the Regulation of the Dues arising
from it, is the grand Affair that cuts out
Employment for the several Councils of
State. They have a small Village be∣longing
to them, whither they punctu∣ally
send a Bailiff for the Distribution of
Justice; in Imitation still of the Great Can∣tons.
There are Three other Towns that
have the same Privileges and Protectors.</P>
<P>We Dined the next Day at <HI>Zurich,</HI>
that is prettily situated on the Out-let
of the Lake, and is reckoned the hand∣somest
Town in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The chief
Places shown to Strangers are the Arse∣nal,
the Library, and the Town-House.
<PB N="374" REF="395"/>
This last is but lately finished, and is a
very fine Pile of Building. The Fron∣tispiece
has Pillars of a beautiful Black
Marble streaked with White, which is
found in the neighbouring Mountains.
The Chambers for the several Councils,
with the other Apartments are very neat.
The whole Building is indeed so well de∣signed,
that it would make a good Figure
even in <HI>Italy.</HI> It is pity they have spoil'd
the Beauty of the Walls with abundance
of childish <HI>Latin</HI> Sentences, that consist
often in a Jingle of Words. I have in∣deed
observed in several Inscriptions of
this Country, that your Men of Learn∣ing
here are extremely delighted in play∣ing
little Tricks with Words and Fi∣gures;
for your <HI>Swiss</HI> Wits are not yet
got out of Anagram and Acrostick. The
Library is a very large Room, pretty well
filled. Over it is another Room fur∣nished
with several artificial and natural
Curiosities. I saw in it a huge Map of
the whole Country of <HI>Zurich</HI> drawn
with a Pensil, where they see eve∣ry
particular Fountain and Hillock in
their Dominions. I ran over their Ca∣binet
of Medals, but don't remember
to have met with any in it that are ex∣traordinary
rare. The Arsenal is better
than that of <HI>Bern,</HI> and they say has Arms
<PB N="375" REF="396"/>
for Thirty Thousand Men. At about a
Day's Journey from <HI>Zurich</HI> we entered
on the Territories of the Abbot of St.
<HI>Gaul.</HI> They are Four Hours Riding in
Breadth, and Twelve in Length. The
Abbot can raise in it an Army of Twelve
Thousand Men well armed and exercised.
He is Soveraign of the whole Country,
and under the Protection of the Cantons
of <HI>Zurich, Lucerne, Glaris</HI> and <HI>Switz.</HI>
He is always chosen out of the Abby of
<HI>Benedictines</HI> at St. <HI>Gaul.</HI> Every Father
and Brother of the Convent has a Voice
in the Election, which must afterwards
be confirmed by the Pope. The last
Abbot was Cardinal <HI>Sfondrati,</HI> who was
advanced to the Purple about Two
Years before his Death. The Abbot
takes the Advice and Consent of his
Chapter before he enters on any Matter
of Importance, as the levying of a Tax,
or declaring of a War. His chief Lay-Officer
is the Grand <HI>Maître d' Hôtel,</HI> or
High-Steward of the Houshold, who
is named by the Abbot, and has the Ma∣nagement
of all Affairs under him.
There are several other Judges and Di∣stributers
of Justice appointed for the se∣veral
Parts of his Dominions, from
whom there always lyes an Appeal to
the Prince. His Residence is gene∣raliy
at the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Convent at
<PB N="376" REF="397"/>
St. <HI>Gaul,</HI> notwithstanding the Town of
St. <HI>Gaul</HI> is a little Protestant Republick,
wholly independent of the Abbot, and
under the Protection of the Cantons.</P>
<P>One would wonder to see so many
rich Bourgeois in the Town of St. <HI>Gaul,</HI>
and so very few poor People in a Place
that has scarce any Lands belonging to
it, and little or no Income but what
arises from its Trade. But the great
Support and Riches of this little State is
its Linnen Manufacture, which employs
almost all Ages and Conditions of its
Inhabitants. The whole Country about
them furnishes them with vast Quanti∣ties
of Flax, out of which they are said
to make yearly Forty Thousand Pieces
of Linnen Cloath, reckoning Two Hun∣dred
Ells to the Piece. Some of their
Manufacture is as finely wrought as any
that can be met with in <HI>Holland</HI>; for
they have Excellent Artizans, and great
Commodities for Whitening. All the
Fields about the Town were so covered
with their Manufacture, that com∣ing
in the Dusk of the Evening we
mistook them for a Lake. They send off
their Works upon Mules into <HI>Italy,</HI>
<HI>Spain, Germany,</HI> and all the adjacent
Countries. They reckon in the Town
of St. <HI>Gaul,</HI> and in the Houses that lye
scattered about it, near Ten Thousand
<PB N="377" REF="398"/>
Souls, of which there are Sixteen Hun∣dred
Burgeois. They chuse their Coun∣cils
and Burgo-Masters out of the Body
of the Burgeois, as in the other Govern∣ments
of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> which are every
where of the same Nature, the diffe∣rence
lying only in the Numbers of
such as are employed in State Affairs,
which are proportioned to the Grandeur
of the States that employ them. The
Abby and the Town bear a great Aver∣sion
to one another; but in the General
Diet of the Cantons their Representatives
sit together, and act by Concert. The
Abbot deputes his <HI>Grand Maître d' Hô∣tel,</HI>
and the Town one of its Burgo-Masters.</P>
<P>About Four Years ago the Town and
Abby wou'd have come to an open Rup∣ture,
had it not been timely prevented by
the Interposition of their common Pro∣tectors.
The Occasion was this, A <HI>Bene∣dictine</HI>
Monk, in one of their annual Pro∣cessions,
carried his Cross erected through
the Town with a Train of Three or
Four Thousand Peasants following him.
They had no sooner entered the Convent
but the whole Town was in a Tumult,
occasion'd by the Insolence of the Priest,
who, contrary to all Precedents, had
presumed to carry his Cross in that
<PB N="378" REF="399"/>
manner. The Burgeois immediately put
themselves in Arms, and drew down
Four Pieces of their Cannon to the
Gates of the Convent. The Procession
to escape the Fury of the Citizens durst
not return by the Way it came, but af∣ter
the Devotions of the Monks were
finish'd, pass'd out at a Back-door of
the Convent, that immediately led into
the Abbot's Territories. The Abbot on
his Part raises an Army, blocks up the
Town on the Side that faces his Domi∣nions,
and forbids his Subjects to fur∣nish
it with any of their Commodities.
While things were just ripe for a War,
the Cantons, their Protectors, inter∣pos'd
as Umpires in the Quarrel, con∣demning
the Town that had appear'd
too forward in the Dispute to a Fine of
Two Thousand Crowns; and Enacting
at the same time, That as soon as any
Procession enter'd their Walls, the Priest
should let the Cross hang about his
Neck without touching it with either
Hand, 'till he came within the Precincts
of the Abby. The Citizens could bring
into the Field near Two Thousand Men
well exercis'd, and arm'd to the best
Advantage, with which they fancy they
could make Head against Twelve or
Fifteen Thousand Peasants, for so many
<PB N="379" REF="400"/>
the Abbot could easily raise in his Ter∣ritories.
But the Protestant Subjects of
the Abby, who they say make up a good
Third of its People, would probably, in
case of a War, abandon the Cause of
their Prince for that of their Religion.
The Town of St. <HI>Gaul</HI> has an Arsenal,
Library, Town-Houses, and Churches
proportionable to the Bigness of the
State. It is well enough fortify'd to re∣sist
any sudden Attack, and to give the
Cantons time to come to their Assi∣stance.
The Abby is by no means so
Magnificent as one would expect from
its Endowments. The Church is one
huge Nef with a double Aisle to it. At
each End is a large Quire. The one of
them is supported by vast Pillars of
Stone, cas'd over with a Composition
that looks the most like Marble of any
thing one can imagine. On the Cieling
and Walls of the Church are Lists of
Saints, Martyrs, Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Bishops,
Kings and Queens that have
been of the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Order. There
are several Pictures of such as have been
distinguish'd by their Birth, Sanctity, or
Miracles, with Inscriptions that let you
into the Name and History of the Per∣sons
represented. I have often wish'd
that some Traveller would take the Pains
<PB N="380" REF="401"/>
to gather together all the Modern In∣scriptions
which are to be met with in
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Countries, as <HI>Gruter</HI>
and others have copy'd out the ancient
Heathen Monuments. Had we Two
or Three Volumes of this Nature, with∣out
any of the Collector's own Refle∣ctions,
I am sure there is nothing in the
World could give a truer Idea of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion, nor expose
more the Pride, Vanity and Self-Inte∣rest
of Convents, the Abuse of Indul∣gencies,
the Folly and Impertinence of
Votaries, and in short the Superstition,
Credulity, and Childishness of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Catholick Religion. One might
fill several Sheets at St. <HI>Gaul,</HI> as there
are few considerable Convents or
Churches that would not afford large
Contributions.</P>
<P>As the King of <HI>France</HI> distributes his
Pensions through all the Parts of <HI>Swit∣zerland,</HI>
the Town and Abby of St. <HI>Gaul</HI>
come in too for their Share. To the
First he gives Five Hundred Crowns
<HI>per Annum,</HI> and to the other a Thou∣sand.
This Pension has not been paid
these Three Years, which they attribute
to their not acknowledging the Duke
of <HI>Anjou</HI> for King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Town
and Abby of St. <HI>Gaul</HI> carry a Bear for
<PB N="381" REF="402"/>
their Arms. The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks
have this Bear's Memory in very great
Veneration, and represent him as the
first Convert their Saint made in the
Country. One of the most Learned of
the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks gave me the fol∣lowing
History of him, which he deli∣ver'd
to me with Tears of Affection in
his Eyes. St. <HI>Gaul</HI> it seems, whom they
call the great Apostle of <HI>Germany,</HI> found
all this Country little better than a vast
Desart. As he was walking in it on a
very cold Day he chanc'd to meet a Bear
in his Way. The Saint, instead of be∣ing
startled at the Rencounter, order'd
the Bear to bring him a Bundle of Wood,
and make him a Fire. The Bear serv'd
him to the best of his Ability, and at
his Departure was commanded by the
Saint to retire into the very Depth of
the Woods, and there to pass the rest of
his Life without ever hurting Man or
Beast. From this time, says the Monk,
the Bear liv'd irreproachably, and ob∣serv'd
to his dying Day the Orders that
the Saint had given him.</P>
<P>I have often consider'd, with a great
deal of Pleasure, the profound Peace
and Tranquillity that reigns in <HI>Switzer∣land</HI>
and its Alliances. It is very won∣derful
to see such a Knot of Govern∣ments,
<PB N="382" REF="403"/>
which are so divided among them∣selves
in Matters of Religion, maintain
so uninterrupted an Union and Corre∣spondance,
that no one of them is for
Invading the Rights of another, but re∣mains
content within the Bounds of its
First Establishment. This, I think, must
be chiefly ascribed to the Nature of the
People, and the Constitution of their
Governments. Were the <HI>Swiss</HI> animated
by Zeal or Ambition, some or other of
their States would immediately break in
upon the rest; or were the States so ma∣ny
Principalities, they might often have
an ambitious Soveraign at the Head of
them, that would embroil his Neigh∣bours,
and sacrifice the Repose of his
Subjects to his own Glory. But as the In∣habitants
of these Countries are naturally
of a heavy Phlegmatick Temper, if any
of their leading Members have more Fire
and Spirit than comes to their Share, it
is quickly temper'd by the Coldness and
Moderation of the rest who sit at the
Helm with them. To this we may add,
that the <HI>Alps</HI> is the worst Spot of
Ground in the World to make Conquests
in, a great Part of its Governments be∣ing
so naturally intrench'd among Woods
and Mountains. However it be, we
find no such Disorders among them as
<PB N="383" REF="404"/>
one would expect in such a Multitude
of States; for as soon as any Publick
Rupture happens, it is immediately clos'd
up by the Moderation and good Offices
of the rest that interpose.</P>
<P>As all the considerable Governments
among the <HI>Alps</HI> are Common-wealths,
so indeed it is a Constitution the most
adapted of any other to the Poverty
and Barrenness of these Countries. We
may see only in a neighbouring Govern∣ment
the ill Consequences of having a
Despotic Prince, in a State that is most
of it composed of Rocks and Moun∣tains;
for notwithstanding there is a
vast Extent of Lands, and many of them
better than those of the <HI>Swiss</HI> and <HI>Gri∣sons,</HI>
the common People, among the
latter, are much more at their Ease, and
in a greater Affluence of all the Conve∣niences
of Life. A Prince's Court eats
too much into the Income of a poor
State, and generally introduces a kind
of Luxury and Magnificence, that sets
every particular Person upon making a
higher Figure in his Station than is ge∣nerally
consistent with his Revenue.</P>
<P>It is the great Endeavour of the se∣veral
Cantons of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> to banish
from among them every thing that looks
like Pomp or Superfluity. To this End
<PB N="384" REF="405"/>
the Ministers are always Preaching, and
the Governors putting out Edicts against
Dancing, Gaming, Entertainments, and
fine Cloaths. This is become more ne∣cessary
in some of the Governments,
since there are so many Refugees settled
among them; for tho' the Protestants
in <HI>France</HI> affect ordinarily a greater Plain∣ness
and Simplicity of Manners, than
those of the same Quality who are of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Communion, they
have however too much of their Coun∣try-Gallantry
for the Genius and Con∣stitution
of <HI>Switzerland.</HI> Should Dres∣sing,
Feasting, and Balls once get among
the Cantons, their Military Roughness
would be quickly lost, their Tempers
would grow too soft for their Climate,
and their Expences out-run their In∣comes,
besides that the Materials for
their Luxury must be brought from o∣ther
Nations, which would immediate∣ly
ruin a Country that has few Commo∣dities
of its own to export, and is not
over-stock'd with Mony. Luxury in∣deed
wounds a Republick in its very Vi∣tals,
as its natural Consequences are Ra∣pine,
Avarice and Injustice; for the
more Mony a Man spends, the more
must he endeavour to augment his
Stock; which at last sets the Liberty
<PB N="385" REF="406"/>
and Votes of a Common-wealth to Sale,
if they find any Foreign Power that is
able to pay the Price of them. We see no
where the pernicious Effects of Luxury
on a Republick more than in that of
the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> who immediately
found it self poor as soon as this Vice
got Footing among them, though they
were possess'd of all the Riches in the
World. We find in the Beginnings
and Increases of their Common-wealth
strange Instances of the Contempt of
Mony, because indeed they were utter
Strangers to the Pleasures that might be
procured by it; or in other Words, be∣cause
they were wholly ignorant of the
Arts of Luxury. But as soon as they
once enter'd into a Taste of Pleasure,
Politeness and Magnificence, they fell
into a Thousand Violences, Conspira∣cies,
and Divisions that threw them in∣to
all the Disorders imaginable, and ter∣minated
in the utter Subversion of the
Common-wealth. It is no wonder there∣fore
the poor Common-wealths of <HI>Swit∣zerland</HI>
are ever labouring at the Sup∣pression
and Prohibition of every thing
that may introduce Vanity and Luxury.
Beside the several Fines that are set up∣on
Plays, Games, Balls and Feastings,
they have many Customs among them
<PB N="386" REF="407"/>
which very much contribute to the
keeping up of their ancient Simplicity.
The Bourgeois, who are at the Head
of the Governments, are obliged to ap∣pear
at all their publick Assemblies in a
Black Cloak and a Band. The Wo∣mens
Dress is very plain, those of the
best Quality wearing nothing on their
Heads generally but Furs, which are to
be met with in their own Country.
The Persons of different Qualities in
both Sexes are indeed allowed their dif∣ferent
Ornaments, but these are gene∣rally
such as are by no means costly, be∣ing
rather designed as Marks of Di∣stinction
than to make a Figure. The
chief Officers of <HI>Bern,</HI> for Example,
are known by the Crowns of their Hats,
which are much deeper than those of
an inferior Character. The Peasants are
generally cloathed in a coarse kind of
Canvas, that is the Manufacture of the
Country. Their Holy-day Cloaths go
from Father to Son, and are seldom worn
out, 'till the Second or Third Genera∣tion:
So that it is common enough to
see a Countryman in the Doublet and
Breeches of his Great-grand-father.</P>
<P><HI>Geneva</HI> is much politer than <HI>Switzer∣land,</HI>
or any of its Allies, and is there∣fore
looked upon as the Court of the
<PB N="387" REF="408"/>
<HI>Alps,</HI> whither the Protestant Cantons
often send their Children to improve
themselves in Language and Education.
The <HI>Genevois</HI> have been very much re∣fin'd,
or as others will have it, corrup∣ted
by the Conversation of the <HI>French</HI>
Protestants, who make up almost a Third
of their People. It is certain they have
very much forgotten the Advice that
<HI>Calvin</HI> gave them in a great Council a
little before his Death, when he recom∣mended
to them, above all Things, an
Exemplary Modesty and Humility, and
as great a Simplicity in their Manners
as in their Religion. Whether or no
they have done well, to set up for mak∣ing
another kind of Figure, Time will
witness. There are several that fancy
the great Sums they have remitted into
<HI>Italy,</HI> though by this means they make
their Court to the King of <HI>France</HI> at
present, may some time or other give
him an Inclination to become the Ma∣ster
of so wealthy a City.</P>
<P>As this Collection of little States a∣bounds
more in Pasturage than in Corn,
they are all provided with their pub∣lick
Granaries, and have the Humanity
to furnish one another in publick Exi∣gencies,
when the Scarcity is not Uni∣versal.
As the Administration of Af∣fairs
<PB N="388" REF="409"/>
relating to these publick Grana∣ries,
is not very different in any of the
particular Governments, I shall content
my self to set down the Rules observed
in it by the little Common-wealth of
<HI>Geneva,</HI> in which I had more Time to
inform my self of the Particulars than
in any other. There are Three of the
Little Council deputed for this Office.
They are obliged to keep together a
Provision sufficient to feed the People
at least Two Years, in case of War or
Famine. They must take care to fill
their Magazines in Times of the great∣est
Plenty, that so they may afford cheap∣er,
and increase the publick Revenue
at a small Expence of its Members.
None of the Three Managers must, up∣on
any Pretence, furnish the Granaries
from his own Fields, that so they may
have no Temptation to pay too great
a Price, or put any bad Corn upon the
Publick. They must buy up no Corn
growing within Twelve Miles of <HI>Ge∣neva,</HI>
that so the filling of their Maga∣zines
may not prejudice their Mar∣ket,
and raise the Price of their Provi∣sions
at Home. That such a Collection
of Corn may not spoil in keeping, all
the Inns and Publick-Houses are obliged
to furnish themselves out of it, by which
means is raised the most considerable
<PB N="389" REF="410"/>
Branch of the publick Revenues; the
Corn being sold out at a much dearer
Rate than 'tis bought up. So that the
greatest Income of the Common-wealth,
which pays the Pensions of most of
its Officers and Ministers, is raised on
Strangers and Travellers, or such of their
own Body as have Mony enough to
spend at Taverns and Publick-Houses.</P>
<P>It is the Custom in <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Swit∣zerland</HI>
to divide their Estates equally
among all their Children, by which
means every one lives at his Ease with∣out
growing dangerous to the Repub∣lick,
for as soon as an overgrown E∣state
falls into the Hands of one that
has many Children, it is broken into so
many Portions as render the Sharers of
it Rich enough, without raising them
too much above the Level of the rest.
This is absolutely necessary in these lit∣tle
Republicks, where the Rich Mer∣chants
live very much within their E∣states,
and by heaping up vast Sums
from Year to Year might become for∣midable
to the rest of their Fellow-Ci∣tizens,
and break the Equality, which is
so necessary in these kinds of Govern∣ments,
were there not means found out
to distribute their Wealth among seve∣ral
Members of their Republick. At
<HI>Geneva,</HI> for Instance, are Merchants
<PB N="390" REF="411"/>
reckon'd worth Twenty Hundred Thou∣sand
Crowns, though, perhaps, there
is not one of them who spends to the
value of Five Hundred Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>Though the Protestants and Papists
know very well that it is their com∣mon
Interest to keep a steddy Neutra∣lity
in all the Wars between the States
of <HI>Europe,</HI> they cannot forbear siding
with a Party in their Discourse. The
Catholicks are zealous for the <HI>French</HI>
King, as the Protestants do not a little
glory in the Riches, Power, and good
Success of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> whom
they look upon as the Bulwarks of the
Reformation. The Ministers in parti∣cular,
have often preached against such
of their Fellow-Subjects as enter into
the Troops of the <HI>French</HI> King; but so
long as the <HI>Swiss</HI> see their Interest in it,
their Poverty will always hold them
fast to his Service. They have indeed
the Exercise of their Religion, and
their Ministers with them, which is the
more remarkable, because the very same
Prince, refused even those of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> who follow'd their Master
to St. <HI>Germains,</HI> the publick Exercise
of their Religion.</P>
<P>Before I leave <HI>Switzerland</HI> I cannot
but observe, that the Notion of Witch∣craft
<PB N="391" REF="412"/>
reigns very much in this Country.
I have often been tired with Accounts
of this Nature from very sensible Men,
that are most of them furnish'd with
Matters of Fact which have happened,
as they pretend, within the compass of
their own Knowledge. It is certain
there have been many Executions on this
Account, as in the Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> there
were some put to Death during my
Stay at <HI>Geneva.</HI> The People are so u∣niversally
infatuated with the Notion,
that if a Cow falls sick, it is Ten to
One but an Old Woman is clapt up in
Prison for it, and if the poor Creature
chance to think her self a Witch, the
whole Country is for hanging her up
without Mercy. One finds indeed the
same Humour prevail in most of the
rocky Barren Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Whe∣ther
it be that Poverty and Ignorance,
which are generally the Products of
these Countries, may really engage a
Wretch in such dark Practices, or whe∣ther
or no the same Principles may not
render the People too credulous, and
perhaps too easy to get rid of some of
their unprofitable Members.</P>
<P>A great Affair that employs the <HI>Swiss</HI>
Politicks at present is the Prince of <HI>Con∣ti</HI>'s
Succession to the Dutchess of <HI>Ne∣mours</HI>
<PB N="392" REF="413"/>
in the Government of <HI>Neuf-Cha∣tel.</HI>
The Inhabitants of <HI>Neuf-Chatel</HI> can
by no means think of submitting them∣selves
to a Prince who is a <HI>Roman</HI> Ca∣tholick,
and a Subject of <HI>France.</HI> They
were very attentive to his Conduct in
the Principality of <HI>Orange,</HI> which they
did not question but he would Rule with
all the Mildness and Moderation imagina∣ble,
as it would be the best Means in the
World to recommend him to <HI>Neuf-Cha∣tel.</HI>
But notwithstanding it was so much
his Interest to manage his Protestant
Subjects in that Country, and the strong
Assurances he had given them in pro∣tecting
them in all their Privileges, and
particularly in the free Exercise of their
Religion, he made over his Principality
in a very little time for a Sum of Mony
to the King of <HI>France.</HI> It is indeed ge∣nerally
believed the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> would
rather still have kept his Title to <HI>Orange,</HI>
but the same Respect which induced him
to quit this Government, might at ano∣ther
time tempt him to give up that of
<HI>Neuf-Chatel</HI> on the like Conditions. The
King of <HI>Prussia</HI> lays in his claim for
<HI>Neuf-Chatel,</HI> as he did for the Principa∣lity
of <HI>Orange,</HI> and 'tis probable would
be more acceptable to the Inhabitants
than the other, but they are generally
<PB N="393" REF="414"/>
dispos'd to declare themselves a Free
Common-wealth, after the Death of the
Dutchess of <HI>Nemours,</HI> if the <HI>Swiss</HI> will
support them. The Protestant Cantons
seem much inclin'd to assist them, which
they may very well do, in case the Dut∣chess
dies whilst the King of <HI>France</HI> has
his Hands so full of Business on all sides
of him. It certainly very much concerns
them not to suffer the <HI>French</HI> King to
Establish his Authority on this side
Mount <HI>Jura,</HI> and on the very Borders
of their Country; but it is not easie to
foresee what a round Sum of Mony,
or the Fear of a Rupture with <HI>France,</HI>
may do among a People who have
tamely suffer'd the <HI>Franche Comptè</HI> to
be seiz'd on, and a Fort to be built
within Cannon-shot of one of their
Cantons.</P>
<P>There is a new Sect sprung up in
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> which spreads very much
in the Protestant Cantons. The Pro∣fessors
of it call themselves <HI>Pietists,</HI> and
as Enthusiasm carries Men generally to
the like Extravagancies, they differ but
little from several Sectaries in other
Countries. They pretend in general to
great Refinements, as to what regards
the Practice of Christianity, and to ob∣serve
the following Rules. To retire
<PB N="394" REF="415"/>
much from the Conversation of the
World. To sink themselves into an
entire Repose and Tranquillity of Mind.
In this State of Silence to attend the se∣cret
Illapse and Flowings in of the Ho∣ly
Spirit, that may fill their Minds with
Peace and Consolation, Joys or Rap∣tures.
To favour all his secret Intima∣tions,
and give themselves up entirely
to his Conduct and Direction, so as
neither to speak, move, or act, but as
they find his Impulse on their Souls.
To retrench themselves within the Con∣veniencies
and Necessities of Life. To
make a Covenant with all their Senses,
so far as to shun the Smell of a Rose or
Violet, and to turn away their Eyes from
a beautiful Prospect. To avoid, as much
as is possible, what the World calls In∣nocent
Pleasures, lest they should have
their Affections tainted by any Sensuali∣ty,
and diverted from the Love of him
who is to be the only Comfort, Repose,
Hope, and Delight, of their whole Beings.
This Sect prevails very much among the
Protestants of <HI>Germany,</HI> as well as those
of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and has occasion'd se∣veral
Edicts against it in the Dutchy
of <HI>Saxony.</HI> The Professors of it are ac∣cus'd
of all the ill Practices which may
seem to be the Consequence of their
<PB N="395" REF="416"/>
Principles, as that they ascribe the worst
of Actions, which their own vicious
Tempers throw them upon, to the Di∣ctates
of the Holy Spirit; that both
Sexes under Pretence of Devout Con∣versation
visit one another at all Hours,
and in all Places, without any regard to
common Decency, often making their
Religion a Cover for their Immorali∣ties;
and that the very best of them are
possess'd with Spiritual Pride, and a
Contempt for all such as are not of their
own Sect. The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who
reproach the Protestants for their break∣ing
into such a Multitude of Religions,
have certainly taken the most effectual
way in the World for the keeping their
Flocks together; I don't mean the Pu∣nishments
they inflict on Mens Persons,
which are commonly look'd upon as the
chief Methods by which they deter them
from breaking through the Pale of the
Church, though certainly these lay a
very great Restraint on those of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Persuasion. But I
take one great Cause why there are so
few Sects in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to
be the Multitude of Convents, with which
they every where abound, that serve as
Receptacles for all those fiery Zealots
who would set the Church in a Flame,
<PB N="396" REF="417"/>
were not they got together in these
Houses of Devotion. All Men of dark
Tempers, according to their Degree of
Melancholy or Enthusiasm, may find
Convents fitted to their Humours, and
meet with Companions as gloomy as
themselves. So that what the Prote∣stants
would call a Fanatick, is in the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church a Religious of such or
such an Order; as I have been told of
an <HI>English</HI> Merchant at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> who af∣ter
some great Disappointments in the
World was resolv'd to turn Quaker or
Capuchin; for, in the Change of Reli∣gion,
Men of ordinary Understandings
don't so much consider the Principles,
as the Practice of those to whom they
go over.</P>
<P>From St. <HI>Gaul</HI> I took Horse to the
Lake of <HI>Constance,</HI> which lyes at Two
Leagues Distance from it, and is form'd
by the Entry of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> This is the
only Lake in <HI>Europe</HI> that disputes for
Greatness with that of <HI>Geneva</HI>; it ap∣pears
more beautiful to the Eye, but
wants the fruitful Fields and Vineyards
that border upon the other. It receives
its Name from <HI>Constance,</HI> the chief Town
on its Banks. When the Cantons of
<HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>Zurich</HI> proposed, at a general
Diet, the Incorporating <HI>Geneva</HI> in the
<PB N="397" REF="418"/>
Number of the Cantons, the <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick Party, fearing the Protestant
Interest might receive by it too great a
Strengthning, proposed at the same time
the Incantoning of <HI>Constance,</HI> as a Coun∣terpoise;
to which the Protestants not
consenting, the whole Project fell to
the Ground. We cross'd the Lake to
<HI>Lindaw,</HI> and in several Parts of it ob∣served
abundance of little Bubbles of
Air, that came working upward from
the very Bottom of the Lake. The
Watermen told us, that they are ob∣served
always to rise in the same Places,
from whence they conclude them to be
so many Springs that break out of the
Bottom of the Lake. <HI>Lindaw</HI> is an Im∣perial
Town on a little Island that lyes
at about Three Hundred Paces from the
firm Land, to which it is join'd by a
huge Bridge of Wood. The Inhabitants
were all in Arms when we pass'd through
it, being under great Apprehensions of
the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> after his having
fallen upon <HI>Ulm</HI> and <HI>Memminghen.</HI> They
flatter themselves, that by cutting their
Bridge they could hold out against his
Army: But, in all Probability, a Shower
of Bombs would quickly reduce the
Burgeois to Surrender. They were for∣merly
Bombarded by <HI>Gustavus Adolphus.</HI>
<PB N="398" REF="419"/>
We were advis'd by our Merchants, by
no means to venture our selves in the
Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Country, so that we
had the Mortification to lose the Sight
of <HI>Munich, Ausburg,</HI> and <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> and
were forced to take our Way to <HI>Vienna</HI>
through the <HI>Tirol,</HI> where we had very
little to Entertain us besides the natural
Face of the Country.</P>

<HEAD>TIROL,
INSPRUCK,
HALL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER having coasted the
<HI>Alps</HI> for some time, we at last
entered them by a Passage
which leads into the long
Valley of the <HI>Tirol,</HI> and fol∣lowing
the Course of the River <HI>Inn</HI> we
came to <HI>Inspruck,</HI> that receives its Name
from this River, and is the Capital Ci∣ty
of the <HI>Tirol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Inspruck</HI> is a handsome Town, though
not a great one, and was formerly the
Residence of the Arch-Dukes who were
Counts of <HI>Tirol</HI>: The Palace where they
used to keep their Court is rather Con∣venient
than Magnificent. The great
Hall is indeed a very noble Room, the
Walls of it are painted in <HI>Fresco,</HI> and
<PB N="400" REF="421"/>
represent the Labours of <HI>Hercules.</HI> Ma∣ny
of them look very finely, though a
great part of the Work has been crack'd
by Earthquakes, which are very fre∣quent
in this Country. There is a lit∣tle
Wooden Palace that borders on the
other, whither the Court used to retire
at the first shake of an Earthquake. I
saw here the largest Menage that I have
met with any where else. At one End
of it is a great Partition designed for an
Opera. They showed us also a very
pretty Theatre. The last Comedy that
was acted on it was designed by the Je∣suits
for the Entertainment of the Queen
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who pass'd this way from
<HI>Hanover</HI> to <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Compliment
which the Fathers made her Majesty on
this occasion was very particular, and
did not a little expose them to the
Raillery of the Court. For the Arms of
<HI>Hanover</HI> being a Horse, the Fathers
thought it a very pretty Allusion to re∣present
the Queen by <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> that
would let no Body get upon him but
<HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. The Wooden
Horse that acted this nobtale Part is still
to be seen behind the Scenes. In one
of the Rooms of the Palace which is
hung with the Pictures of several Illu∣strious
Persons, they showed us the Por∣trait
<PB N="401" REF="422"/>
of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who
was beheaded in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The Gardens about
the House are very large, but ill kept.
There is in the middle of them a beau∣tiful
Statue in Brass of an Arch-Duke
<HI>Leopold</HI> on Horseback. There are near
it Twelve other Figures of Water-Nymphs
and River-Gods well Cast, and
as big as the Life. They were designed
for the Ornaments of a Water-Work,
as one might easily make a great Vari∣ety
of Jetteaus at a small Expence in a
Garden that has the River <HI>Inn</HI> running
by its Walls. The late Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI>
had this Palace, and the Govern∣ment
of the <HI>Tirol</HI> assigned him by the
Emperor, and his Lady the Queen Dow∣ager
of <HI>Poland</HI> lived here several Years
after the Death of the Duke her Hus∣band.
There are covered Galleries that
lead from the Palace to Five different
Churches. I passed through a very long
one which reaches to the Church of the
<HI>Capucin</HI> Convent, where the Duke of
<HI>Lorrain</HI> used often to assist at their Mid∣night
Devotions. They showed us in
this Convent the Apartments of <HI>Maxi∣milian,</HI>
who was Arch-Duke and Count
of <HI>Tirol</HI> about Fourscore Years ago. This
Prince at the same time that he kept the
<PB N="402" REF="423"/>
Government in his Hands, lived in this
Convent with all the Rigor and Auste∣rity
of a <HI>Capucin.</HI> His Anti-Chamber
and Room of Audience are little square
Chambers Wainscoated. His private
Lodgings are Three or Four small
Rooms faced with a kind of Fret-work,
that makes them look like little Hollow
Caverns in a Rock. They preserve this
Apartment of the Convent uninhabited,
and show in it the Altar, Bed and Stove,
as likewise a Picture and a Stamp of this
Devout Prince. The Church of the
<HI>Franciscan</HI> Convent is famous for the Mo∣nument
of the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the
First, which stands in the midst of it. It
was erected to him by his Grand-Son
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> the First, who probably looked
upon this Emperor as the Founder of
the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness. For as by his
own Marriage he annexed the Low-Countries
to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> so
by matching his Son to <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Arra∣gon</HI>
he settled on his Posterity the King∣dom
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by the Marriage of
his Grand-Son <HI>Ferdinand</HI> got into his
Family the Kingdoms of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and
<HI>Hungary.</HI> This Monument is only Ho∣norary,
for the Ashes of the Emperor
lye elsewhere. On the Top of it is a
Brazen Figure of <HI>Maximilian</HI> on his
<PB N="403" REF="424"/>
Knees, and on the Sides of it a beau∣tiful
<HI>Bas Relief</HI> representing the Actions
of this Prince. His whole History is
digested into Twenty Four square Pan∣nels
of Sculpture in <HI>Bas Relief</HI>: The
Subject of Two of them is his Confede∣racy
with <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, and the
Wars they made together upon <HI>France.</HI>
On each Side of this Monument is a
Row of very noble Brazen Statues much
bigger than the Life, most of them re∣presenting
such as were some way or o∣ther
related to <HI>Maximilian.</HI> Among the
rest is one that the Fathers of the Con∣vent
tell us represents King <HI>Arthur</HI> the
old <HI>British</HI> King. But what Relation
had that <HI>Arthur</HI> to <HI>Maximilian</HI>? I don't
question therefore but it was de∣signed
for Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> Elder Bro∣ther
of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, who had es∣poused
<HI>Catharine,</HI> Sister of <HI>Maximilian,</HI>
whose Divorce afterwards gave occasi∣on
to such signal Revolutions in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
This Church was built by <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
the First. One sees in it a kind of Offer at
Modern Architecture, but at the same
time that the Architect has shown his
Dislike of the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner, one may
see very well that in that Age they were
not, at least in this Country, arrived
at the Knowledge of the true Way.
<PB N="404" REF="425"/>
The Portal, for Example, consists of a
composite Order unknown to the Anci∣ents;
the Ornaments indeed are taken
from them, but so put together that you
see the Volutes of the <HI>Ionic,</HI> the Foliage
of the <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and the Uovali of the
<HI>Doric</HI> mix'd without any Regularity on
the same Capital. So the Vault of the
Church, tho' broad enough, is encum∣ber'd
with too many little Tricks in
Sculpture. It is indeed supported with
single Columns instead of those vast
Clusters of little Pillars that one meets
with in <HI>Gothic</HI> Cathedrals, but at the
same time these Columns are of no regu∣lar
Order, and at least Twice too long
for their Diameter. There are other
Churches in the Town, and Two or
Three Palaces which are of a more Mo∣dern
Make, and built with a good Fan∣cy.
I was shown the little <HI>Notredame</HI>
that is handsomly design'd, and topp'd
with a Cupola. It was made as an Of∣fering
of Gratitude to the Blessed Vir∣gin,
for having defended the Country
of the <HI>Tirol</HI> against the Victorious Arms
of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> who could not
enter this Part of the Empire after ha∣ving
over-run most of the rest. This
Temple was therefore built by the Con∣tributions
of the whole Country. At
<PB N="405" REF="426"/>
about half a League's distance from <HI>In∣spruck</HI>
stands the Castle of <HI>Amras,</HI> fur∣nish'd
with a prodigious Quantity of
Medals, and many other sorts of Rari∣ties
both in Nature and Art, for which
I must refer the Reader to Monsieur <HI>Pa∣tin</HI>'s
Account in his Letter to the Duke
of <HI>Wirtemburg,</HI> having my self had nei∣ther
Time or Opportunity to enter into
a particular Examination of them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Inspruck</HI> we came to <HI>Hall,</HI> that
lyes at a League distance on the same
River. This Place is particularly fa∣mous
for its Salt-Works. There are in
the Neighbourhood vast Mountains of
a transparent kind of Rock not unlike
Allum, extreamly solid, and as piquant
to the Tongue as Salt it self. Four or
Five Hundred Men are always at Work
in these Mountains, where as soon as
they have hewn down any Quantities of
the Rock they let in their Springs and
Reservoirs among their Works. The
Water eats away and dissolves the Par∣ticles
of Salt which are mix'd in the
Stone, and is convey'd by long Troughs
and Canals from the Mines to the Town
of <HI>Hall,</HI> where 'tis received in vast Ci∣sterns,
and boil'd off from time to
time.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="427"/>
They make after the rate of Eight
Hundred Loaves a Week, each Loaf
Four Hundred Pound Weight. This
would raise a great Revenue to the Em∣peror,
were there here such a Tax on
Salt as there is in <HI>France.</HI> At present he
clears but Two Hundred Thousand
Crowns a Year, after having defray'd
all the Charges of working it. There
are in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and other Parts of
the <HI>Alps,</HI> several of these Quarries of
Salt that turn to very little Account, by
Reason of the great Quantities of Wood
they consume.</P>
<P>The Salt-Works at <HI>Hall</HI> have a great
Convenience for Fuel which swims down
to them on the River <HI>Inn.</HI> This Ri∣ver,
during its Course through the <HI>Ti∣rol,</HI>
is generally shut up between a dou∣ble
Range of Mountains that are most
of them cover'd with Woods of Fir-Trees.
Abundance of Peasants are em∣ploy'd
in the hewing down of the lar∣gest
of these Trees, that, after they are
Bark'd and cut into Shape, are tumbled
down from the Mountains into the
Stream of the River, which carries them
off to the Salt-Works. At <HI>Inspruck</HI>
they take up vast Quantities for the Con∣vents
and publick Officers, who have a
certain Portion of it alloted them by the
<PB N="407" REF="428"/>
Emperor: the rest of it passes on to
<HI>Hall.</HI> There are generally several Hun∣dred
Loads afloat, for they begin to cut
above Twenty Five Leagues up the Ri∣ver
above <HI>Hall,</HI> and there are other Ri∣vers
that flow into the <HI>Inn,</HI> which bring
in their Contributions. These Salt-Works,
and a Mint that is establish'd at
the same Place, have render'd this Town,
notwithstanding the Neighbourhood of
the Capital City, almost as populous as
<HI>Inspruck</HI> it self. The Design of this
Mint is to work off part of the Metals
which are found in the neighbouring
Mountains; where, as we were told,
there are Seven Thousand Men in con∣stant
Employ. At <HI>Hall</HI> we took a Boat
to carry us to <HI>Vienna.</HI> The First Night
we lay at <HI>Rottenburg,</HI> where is a strong
Castle above the Town. Count <HI>Serini</HI>
is still close Prisoner in this Castle, who,
as they told us in the Town, had lost his
Senses by his long Imprisonment and Af∣flictions.
The next Day we Din'd at
<HI>Kuff-stain,</HI> where there is a Fortress on
a high Rock above the Town almost
inaccessible on all Sides: This being
a Frontier Place on the Dutchy of
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> where we enter'd after about
an Hour's Rowing from <HI>Kuff-stain.</HI> It
was the pleasantest Voyage in the World
<PB N="408" REF="429"/>
to follow the Windings of this River
<HI>Inn</HI> through such a Variety of pleasing
Scenes as the Course of it naturally led
us. We had sometimes on each Side
us a vast Extent of naked Rocks and
Mountains, broken into a Thousand ir∣regular
Steeps and Precipices; in other
Places we saw a long Forest of Fir-Trees
so thick set together, that it was impos∣sible
to discover any of the Soil they
grew upon, and rising up so regularly
one above another, as to give us the
View of a whole Wood at once. The
time of the Year, that had given the
Leaves of the Trees so many different
Colours, compleated the Beauty of the
Prospect. But as the Materials of a fine
Landskip are not always the most profi∣table
to the Owner of them, we met
with but very little Corn or Pasturage
for the Proportion of Earth that we
pass'd through, the Lands of the <HI>Tirol</HI>
not being able to feed the Inhabitants.
This long Valley of the <HI>Tirol</HI> lyes en∣closed
on all Sides by the <HI>Alps,</HI> tho'
its Dominions shoot out into several
Branches that lye among the Breaks and
Hollows of the Mountains. It is go∣vern'd
by Three Councils residing at
<HI>Inspruck,</HI> one sits upon Life and Death,
the other is for Taxes and Impositions,
<PB N="409" REF="430"/>
and a third for the common Distributi∣ons
of Justice. As these Courts regulate
themselves by the Orders they receive
from the Imperial Court, so in many
Cases there are Appeals from them to
<HI>Vienna.</HI> The Inhabitants of the <HI>Tirol</HI>
have many particular Privileges above
those of the other Hereditary Countries
of the Emperor. For as they are natu∣rally
well fortify'd among their Moun∣tains,
and at the same time border upon
many different Governments, as the <HI>Gri∣sons,</HI>
<HI>Venetians, Swiss, Bavarians,</HI> &amp;c.
a severe Treatment might tempt them
to set up for a Republick, or at least
throw themselves under the milder Go∣vernment
of some of their Neighbours:
Besides that their Country is poor, and
that the Emperor draws considerable In∣comes
out of its Mines of Salt and Me∣tal.
They are these Mines that fill the
Country with greater Numbers of Peo∣ple
than it would be able to bear
without the Importation of Corn from
Foreign Parts. The Emperor has Forts
and Cittadels at the Entrance of all the
Passes that lead into the <HI>Tirol,</HI> which
are so advantagiously placed upon Rocks
and Mountains, that they command all
the Vallies and Avenues that lye about
them. Besides, that the Country it self
<PB N="410" REF="431"/>
is cut into so many Hills and Inequali∣ties,
as would render it defensible by a ve∣ry
little Army against a numerous Enemy.
It was therefore generally thought the
Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would not attempt
the cutting off any Succours that were
sent to Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>; or the forcing
his Way through the <HI>Tirol</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI>
The River <HI>Inn,</HI> that had hitherto been
shut up among Mountains, passes gene∣rally
through a wide open Country dur∣ing
all its Course through <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
which is a Voyage of Two Days, after
the rate of Twenty Leagues a Day.</P>
