<HEAD>THE
LIFE <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
OF
GILBERT LANGLEY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Pages contain the Ad∣ventures
of <HI>Gilbert Langley,</HI> Gold∣smith,
written by his own Pen. It
is conceived, that a liker Picture
cannot well be drawn than that which
he has given us of himself, it is published chiefly
for the Use of such as may resemble him in some
Respects. Many would fly from Vice if they saw
her Face all at once, and in Day Light; here she is,
never was was she better known to any than to this
Man, and he has sent her abroad in her own Cloaths.
His Stile is the Stile of a Man of Pleasure, and
was not altered, because it may be of Use to know
what sort of Stile that is.</P>
<P>Some People may perhaps fancy the reading such
a Life dangerous, for their Sakes this Advertise∣ment
is prefixed. If they see young People make
ill Use of it, let them set them right, let them bid
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
these inconsiderate Folks make the Growth and
Progress of Vice, from abusing Education to cheat∣ing
a Father, to defrauding the World, from de∣frauding
the World to downright Robbery, and so
to the Gallows; an open broad Road, and his un∣happy
Journey makes the Stages for others, that
they stop or ride back in Time, according to the
old approved Maxim.
<Q><L>Satius est recurrere quam currere male.</L>

<L>Better return, than in an ill Road run.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>We commonly hear the young Spendthrists of
our Times, discourse exactly in Mr. <HI>Langley's</HI> Lan∣guage,
and reason, or rather pervert Reason as he
does. In such a Case, point out a similar Passage
in this fine History of modern Gallantry, and put
him in Mind of the Conclusion; tell him, which
is a certain Truth, that <HI>Greenwich</HI> Rambles lead to
<HI>Maidstone</HI> Goal, that Intrigues with Prostitutes in
the Pleasure rather of a Goat, than of a Man, and
that the Digressions from the Paths of Virtue, is
walking for the Air in <HI>Tyburn Road,</HI> where you run
more Hazards than one of Choaking. But to
proceed to his own Account.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Langley,</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Holdenby Langley,</HI>
an eminent <HI>Goldsmith</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and Nephew to
Sir <HI>Thomas Langley,</HI> Bart. was born <HI>Nov.</HI> 19, 1710;
at three Years of Age he was sent down to his
Grandmother's Seat at <HI>Peldersley</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> un∣der
whose Care he continued till he was seven
Years of Age, when his Mother growing impa∣tient
at his long Continuance in the Country, came
down from <HI>London</HI> to setch him Home. No sooner
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
had he received the Visits common on such Occa∣sions,
and recovered from the Fatigue of his
Journey, but he was put to School to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>
in <HI>Red-lion-street,</HI> from whose prudent Instructions
he in his tenders Years made so great an Improve∣ment,
that few or none in the same School were
thought his Equals, and his Father unwilling to
curb the promising Genuis of his Child, by the
Advice and Consent of his Master, removed him
from thence to the <HI>Charter-House,</HI> and thereby
gave him a further Opportunity of exerting his na∣tural
Parts. Here in a short Time he began to
read <HI>Virgil, Ovid, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> and
had as great Knowledge of those Authors as his
tender Years would admit. But such is the Mis∣fortune
of some of our <HI>English</HI> Schools, that the
Masters, either to please the Parents, or indulge
the Child, hurry their Pupils, from Class to Class
without consulting whether they are sufficiently
grounded in the first Rudiments of Learning,
Hence it is, that so many Youths who have ran
through all the Classic Authors, after a Year or
two's Absence from School, are almost as far to
seek, as if their Parents had not expended any
Thing on their Education.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert's</HI> Father being sully persuaded of this al∣most
universal Error and Corruption in our <HI>English</HI>
Schools, resolved to send him over to the Bene∣dictine
Monks at <HI>Doway</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> there to have
him brought up in his own Religion; but not∣withstanding
the great Disparity between a Foreign
and <HI>English</HI> Education, was so fully proved by se∣veral
of Mr. <HI>Langley's</HI> Friends, yet his Wife could
not by Arguments, be induced to a Compliance in
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
parting with her Child, preferring rather the Pre∣sence
of her Son in Ignorance, before his Absence,
in a Place where he was sure to have the fairest Op∣portunity
of acquiring solid and useful Learning.
Thus her Fondness triumph'd over her Reason,
and she could not bear the Thoughts of a Separa∣tion
from her Darling, who to please her, though
to his own Prejudice, was continued at Home, till
Providence, was pleased to take her away, and by
that removed the sole Obstacle to the intended Pro∣gress
of our young Student; for no sooner was
his too-fond Mamma dead, and decently interred,
but the Father, earnestly bent on his Son's Ad∣vancement,
made diligent Search for a proper Per∣son,
to whom he might commit the Trust of his
Son, until he should arrive at <HI>Doway,</HI> the Place
designed for his future Education. Upon Enqui∣ry,
he found out Mr. <HI>Sturton,</HI> the Prior of the
<HI>Benedictine Monks,</HI> who being come to <HI>London</HI> a∣bout
some particular Business, was now returning
to his Convent; with this Gentleman he agreed on
an annual Sum for my Board, Learning, and all
other necessary Expences, and it was agreed my
Departure was to be as soon as possible. The Day
been fixed, we met at the <HI>Cross-Keys,</HI> in <HI>Grace∣church-Street,</HI>
where my indulgent Father, with
reiterated Entreaties, sollicited Mr. <HI>Sturton,</HI> to a
peculiar Care of his young Pupil, and after he had
tenderly embraced me, with flowing Eyes, com∣mitted
me to the Management of my new Tutor.
For my Part, I readily consess, that being fond
of Novelty, and having a roving Disposition, I
was rather pleased than concerned at our Parting,
and with Joy resigned myself to a new strange
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Guardian. In short, we lay at the Inn that Eight,
and in the Morning took Coach for <HI>Dover,</HI> from
whence (the Packet being ready to Sail) we em∣barked
for Calais, and in a fw Hours, with a fresh
and favourable Gale, we reached the wished-for
Haven. My Tutor being intimately acquainted
with Mr. <HI>Francia,</HI> (commonly known in <HI>England</HI>
by the Name of <HI>Francia</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI>) we lodged in his
House, and were civilly and agreeably entertained
by him for the Space of three Days.</P>
<P>Now all Things appear'd to me very uncom∣mon,
and being unable to understand the Native
Language, Manners, or Customs, I thought my∣self
in a New World, asking several impertinent
Questions of my Guardian, who well pleased with
my Curiosity, and juvenile Observations, gave me
such Answers as my tender Age was capable to
understand. Now after Thanks to Mr. <HI>Francia</HI>
for his kind Entertainment, we proceeded on our
Journey, and the next Day arrived at St. <HI>Omers,</HI>
where we spent the whole Day viewing the Curio∣sities
of that Town, which I shall not presume to
describe, being then but in the 12th Year of my
Age; yet I cannot forbear taking Notice of the
Cathedral of St. <HI>Bartin</HI>'s, an ancient and stately
Structure, adorned with several curious Pieces of
Painting, and embellished with numerous Orna∣ments;
but what struck me most with Wonder
and Surprize, were the Skins of a Toad and a
Crocodile, each of an enormous Size, that were
fixed to one of the Columns of the Church; but
since there are so many various Reports, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣mantick
Fables devised by the Populace concern∣ing
the prodigious Dimensions of those Animals,
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
and the Manner of their being discovered, I shall
omit troubling my Reader any farther on that
Head, since where I cannot give a full, true, and
satisfactory Account, my Resolution is to be
silent.</P>
<P>Adjoining to this noble Cathedral, is a magni∣ficent
and splendid Convent, resembling more the
Palace of a grand Monarch, than the Receptacle
of Persons, who under the spacious Pretence of
Religion retire thither; although in Reality, they
much more fully iudulge their irregular Passions and
inordinate Desires, than those who struggling in
the tempestuous Ocean of the World, boldly ex∣pose
themselves to all Dangers, and to the utmost
of their Abilities, serve and glorify their great
Creator▪ In this Convent are upwards of 150 Je∣suits,
and near 100 Students, who all pay the an∣nual
Salary of 25<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, except twelve of
them, who are upon the Pope's Foundation. My
Guardian and I paid a Visit to the Prior, who en∣tertained
us in a sumptuous and elegant Manner,
none being so profuse in their Entertainments as
the <HI>Romish</HI> Clergy one among another. The next
Morning we set out for <HI>Doway,</HI> where we arrived
in the Evening, to the great Satisfaction and Com∣fort
of the <HI>Benedictines,</HI> who with all possible De∣monstrations
of Joy, received their Superior, and
(as I was afterwards informed) highly applauded
him for the due Execution of his Commission, and
commended his Diligence and unwearied Endea∣vours,
in encreasing the Number of the Faithful.
At the Expiration of three Days, which are usu∣ally
allowed to young Sparks, to initiate themselves
in the Forms and Precepts of the College, I was
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
examined by three Reverend Fathers, and upon a
strict Examination, was found capable of nothing
higher than <HI>Alvarus's</HI> Grammar, and <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Com∣mentaries,
a plain Proof of the Vanity of some of
our <HI>English</HI> Schools. But since my Readers may
be curious, and willing to be informed of the Man∣ners
and Customs of our Collegiate Life, I shall
for their Satisfaction give a true Account thereof.
The annual Salary is 25<HI>l.</HI> Sterling for an elder
Brother, and 20 ditto for a younger; at our first
Entrance we are divested of our secular Garb, and
cloathed with a Cassock and a Gown, resembling
in Form those of the Foundation of the <HI>Charter-House,</HI>
which Dress, according to the ancient
Rules of the House, is allowed to each Student
new every Year. The Scholars are divided accord∣ing
to their different Abilities and Capacities into
several Classes, each apart, to prevent Noise and
Interruption, and over each Class presides a pro∣per
Master, whose Business is to instruct his Pupils
in the Knowledge of such Authors as he thinks
most proper and suitable to their Genius and Un∣derstanding.
We were obliged to continue twelve
Months in the same Study, that we may be entire∣ly
perfect therein, and during that Time, have
Monthly Examinations, in which the most perfect
is for his Encouragement to receive a Praemium
from the Hands of the Prior, at the three several
grand Examinations, that are held before the whole
House; at <HI>Easter, Michaelmas,</HI> and <HI>Christmas.</HI> All
(except those who are in the <HI>Accidence</HI>) are com∣pell'd
at all Times, and on all Occasions to speak
the Latin Tongue. We have a large Dormitory,
where each Student has a Bed a-part, a Cale-facto∣ry,
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
and at each End thereof, a large fire Place,
though but small Allowance of Wood, having but
one Faggot, and two Billets to each Fire, and that
only in the Evening, which causes some of our
young Sparks, sometimes privately, and sometimes
by open Force, to break into the Wood-house,
that stands in our Area or Yard. Our Refectory
or Dining-Room, is large and commodious, and
served with due Oeconomy, where each Scholar
has the first Choice of the Portions of Meat, ac∣cording
to his Superiority in Learning. Our Diet
is Bread and Butter every Morning, at Noon half
a Pound of boil'd Meat, with a Porringer of Broth,
and at Night, the same Allowance of Roast, with
a Sallad, except on Fasts; but at Meals, we have
as much Bread and Beer as we desire, although at
all other Times, we are debarr'd even from a crust
of Bread, or a Draught of Beer, which makes us
Frequently convey out the same under our Cassocks,
and sometimes like ravenous Wolves, make bold
Incursions into the Kitchen, and there plunder and
carry away all that we can meet with; but of this
more hereafter. Over the Students, which are
never less than fifty or threescore, a Prefect is ap∣pointed
by the Prior, who ought to be a Person of
great Sagacity and Discretion, for to his Care the
Direction of all the Scholars (when out of their re∣spective
Schools) is committed; he hears all De∣bates,
settles all Controversies, and appeases all
Quarrels that arise amongst his Pupils; his Busi∣ness
is to call them at five in the Morning, as well
in Winter as Summer, he rings the Bell to Prayers,
at their Meals says Grace, and orders one of the
Scholars in his Turn to mount the Pulpit, and
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
read the Martyrology, during the Time of Repast,
whilst he himself stands at the upper End of the
Refectory to keep Silence, and prevent any Con∣fusion
or Irregularities, that might otherwise hap∣pen
among such Boys. Hours of Study are from
Five till half an Hour after Seven, the other half
Hour being allowed for washing and breakfast
Time; at Eight we go to School, at Eleven to
Prayers, at Noon to Dinner, at One to Study, at
Two to School, at half an Hour after Four to
Play, at Five to Study, at Six to Supper, and
afterwards to play if in the Summer Time, or in
the Winter to our respective Seats in the Calefac∣tory.
None dares presume to go into the Town
without the Prefect's Leave; we have a capacious
Area or Yard, wherein is a Terras Walk, and a
Place very proper for the Exercise of Hand-Ball,
in which we strove to surpass each other.</P>
<P>At <HI>Christmas</HI> the Scholars are allowed to chuse
a King to promote Pastime, and all the great Of∣ficers
of his Court; which occasions a great deal
of Diversion. On Twelfth Night, the King sends
his Ambassadors to invite the Prior, and some of
the Grandees of the House, to an elegant and
costly Supper, to which none except the great
Officers of State, are admitted; all the rest being
then in waiting, and receive, as his Majesty's
Bounty, what comes from his Royal Table. For
my Readers Satisfaction, I shall mention an odd
Accident that happened to me, whilst I had the
Honour of serving in Quality of an Ambassa∣dor.</P>
<P>On the Eve of the Epiphany, I received an Order
to take three of the Lords of the Bed-chamber, and
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
go about two Miles out of Town to a Publick-house,
and there to purchase four Gallons of Brandy for the
abovementioned Entertainment. As I could speak the
<HI>French</HI> Language, I soon executed the Commission, at
a far more reasonable Rate than I could possibly have
done in the Town, there being a large Duty on the
Import of any Spirituous Liquors into the Garrison,
and that farm'd by a <HI>Comis,</HI> or Officer, that hath his
Myrmidons constantly attending at the Entrance of
the Town Gate, who search all comers in; but it be∣ing
usual to let the Students of different Colleges pass
and repass, without Hindrance or Examination, we
thought ourselves secure from any Danger that might
arise on that Head; so after our Bottles were filled,
we sat down in the House, and drank a Glass or two
to refresh ourselves; but, as ill Fortune would have
it, a Soldier coming into the same House, privately
took Notice of our Bottles that stood on the Table,
and went to the Searcher's Office, and gave Informa∣tion
that four Students of the Benedictine Monks,
were going to convey Brandy into the Garrison. We
were entirely ignorant of the private Information that
he had given, and therefore in a merry Mind, paid
the Reckoning, and returned homeward with the Li∣quor
under our Cassocks, when, to our great Surprize,
as we were going in at the Gate, we were stopped,
the Brandy found upon us, and we secured in the ad∣joining
Office, till they had called a File of Musque∣teers
to conduct us to the head Comis's House for fur∣ther
Examination. I had then a Pistole in my
Pocket, and knowing the mighty Force of Gold, of∣fered
it to the Searchers for our Enlargement; but
they were inflexible, and therefore any one may judge,
what Horror and Confusion we were in, at the ap∣proaching
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
Danger. In short, as we marched along
with the Guard of Soldiers, the Inhabitants won∣dered
what Crime such Youths could be guilty of, that
had thus exposed them to publick Scandal and Shame.
Some pitied our Misfortune, and others condemned our
Folly, but by a lucky Accident, we met with two <HI>Irish</HI>
Franciscan Fryers, who enquiring of the Serjeant the
Cause of this unusal Treatment, reprimanded him se∣verely
for his Folly, in carrying us to the Officer of
the Customs, and at the same Time advised him to
conduct us to our own College, and inform the Prior
of what had happened, it being properly his Business
to answer for the Misdemeanors and Trepasses of all
Students under his immediate Care and Direction.
This sage Advice of the Fathers, prevailed on the
rigid Officer, who conveyed us safe to our own Convent
and asterwards made his Report to the abovemention'd
Officer, who next Morning sent to demand four hun∣dred
Florins of the Prior, the usual Forfeiture, or
Fine imposed for the infringement of his Dues and
Privileges. Our Prior was startled at this exorbi∣tant
Demand, and absolutely refused to give the least
Satisfaction, which so exasperated the Comis, that he
resolved to prosecute us with the utmost Rigour.
Hereupon the Prior consulting the Sages of the Law,
was advised to quiet the impending Storm, and
bring this unlucky Accident to an amicable Composi∣tion,
which was accordingly effected on the Payment
of one hundred Florins, and a further Promise that
none of his Pupils should ever be guilty of the like
Offence.</P>
<P>The <HI>March</HI> following, another Misfortune hap∣pened
to me that had likely to have proved fatal,
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
and of greater Consequence than the former,
which was as follows:</P>
<P><HI>John Hussey, William Etherington, George
Pigot, John Racket, William Brown, and my∣self,</HI>
formed a Conspiracy against the Peace of the
Common-wealth, and by a mutual and solemn Engage∣ment,
were fully determined to make an Irruption in∣to
the Kitchen, and there plunder all that we could
meet with. The Night before the Execution of our
Plot, we, by the Help of Gimblets, had secretly bored
two Holes in the Kitchen Door, that leads to the Re∣fectory,
and fixed two Pieces of Packthread, blacked
on purpose to prevent their being observed, to the
Bolts that fastened the Door on the Inside; this
Scheme, though artfully managed, was perceived by
one of the Scullions, who immediately gave Notice
thereof, to the rest of the Servants, who judging our
Intent, armed themselves with Bludgeons, and resolv'd
to dispute the Entrance into their sooty Kingdom a∣gainst
all Invaders. They likewise furnished them∣selves
with a dark Lanthorn, either to descry the
Number of the Assailants, and loudy complain against
such publick Acts of Rapine and Hostility. No less
diligent were we to execute our Intent, and having pro∣vided
ourselves with lusty Cudgels, and a Chissel to
open the Refectory Door, between the Hours of twelve
and One, we began to attack the Garrison; first with
little or no Noise, forced open the Door, and gained
an easy Entrance into the Kitchen Passage by the Help
of those Cords we had fastened to the Bolts of the
said Door that guarded the Entrance. We now
thought ourselves secure, and found in the said inlett
into our intended Port, two large Barrels of Raisins,
with the Heads of them open; this unexpected Prize
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
overjoyed us, and we immediately fell to plunder, and
filled a large sack that we had brought with us,
to carry away our Booty; but to our great Astonish∣ment,
we were suddenly saluted with repeated Blows
on our Heads, Backs, and Shoulders, from different
Quarters laid heavily on us, by the numerous company
of Servants, that were fully bent to retrieve their lost
Reputation, and make us Prisoners of War. We
straitway quitted our Prize, and fell Pell-mell on the
Enemy, with true <HI>English</HI> courage, and Bravery,
and returned their blows so briskly, that they began
to give Ground, which so redoubled our Ardour, that
we drove them out of their Fortifications, into the
open Garden, belonging to the Religious; where find∣ing
themselves unable to withstand our Fury, they
immediately set up a great cry, calling out, <HI>Laroon,</HI>
<HI>Laroon,</HI> which is in English, Thieves, Thieves, and
the <HI>Shoemaker,</HI> who was one of the Gang, stretching
forth his dark Lanthorn, looked stedfastly on us;
whereupon <HI>Hussey</HI> knocked it out of his Hand, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
too late, for he already knew us, and their Out-cry
by this Time having alarmed the House, we were
obliged to make a precipitate Retreat, and endeavour
to regain our Quarters before the Perfect's Arrival,
which was happily effected, and we all in our respec∣tive
Beds, pretending to be fast asleep; but this Arti∣fice
would not pass on him, for we not having Time to
Undress, our Cassocks were not as usual spread over
our Bed-cloaths, and he thereby easily discovered
us.</P>
<P>The next Morning we were summoned before the
Grand Prior, where the poor battered and bruised
servants made a most pitious complaint of their bar∣barous
Treatment, vowing that they would all leave
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
the House, except they had ample Satisfaction for the
Injury done them. The Prior taking this Affair into
his consideration, rightly judged, that if he counte∣nanced
snch open Acts of Theft and Hostility, that
none would ever serve in the Convent, and that it
vastly derogated from his character, whose Office was
to maintain Peace and good Tranquility throughout
his Jurisdiction, and therefore he pronounced this harsh,
tho' just sentence, that we should for this unparallel'd
crime, be expelled the college, as an Example to deter
others from the like notorious Offence. We were now
like criminals under Sentence of Death, none caring to
converse with us, least they should be suspected to be
infected with our wicked and perverse Dispositions.
However, as Mercy is sometimes extended to the most
abandoned Wretches, we all (except <HI>Brown</HI>) by great
Itnerest, and the characters our Masters gave of our
being Youths of a promising Genius, were reprieved,
and once more on promise of our future good behavi∣our,
again admitted into Favour. Notwithstanding
this unexpected clemency, we could not suppress our
Resentment, at the Expulsion of our old confederate
<HI>Brown,</HI> but vowed to revenge the Injury and Injustice
that we thought was done to our former companion,
in the most secret Manner that possibly we could; and
therefore we had frequent Debates and consultations
how to bring about our intended Project. At last,
the following Method was unanimously resolved on.
In our Area stands the Wood-house, to which the
Scullion (the Informer of our first Attack) usually came
every Day with a Wheelbarrow to fetch Wood, be∣tween
the Hours of four and five in the Afternoon,
for the Use of the Kitchen. We therefore provided
ourselves with a cloak belonging to one of the minor
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
Students to prevent Suspicion, ready against his
Entrance, to surprize him in the following Man∣ner.</P>
<P>There was a Ladder standing in the Yard, by
the Help of which, we privately got in at the
Window, and hid ourselves behind the Faggots,
and there with Impatience waited his coming, hav∣ing,
in the mean Time, well provided ourselves
with smart Switches, to lash the bare Bumb of our
inveterate Enemy. No sooner had he opened the
Door, and began to load his Barrow, but the
Cloak was thrown over his Head, and fastened with
a Cord round his Neck, so that being blinded, he
was uncapable to discover who was the Foe, or
make any Defence to prevent his intended Punish∣ment.
In short, we first shut the Door, to prevent
his Cries being heard, then knocked him down, let
down his Breeches, and paid his bare Buttocks in
Turns, 'till we were all weary▪ Nor were his hide∣ous
Cries, or loud Invocations of his Tutelar
Saints, able to abate our Rage, or defend him
from the severe Punishment, that we were in Ho∣nour
bound to inflict on this Delinquent, as a Re∣taliation,
and Satisfaction for the Disgrace of our
former Companion. No sooner was this bloody
Flagellation, or Scourging ended, but the Bell
rang to Study, and we left the poor unhappy
Wretch alone to bemoan his dire Misfortune, and
vainly vonjecture who were the Persons who had
thus irreverently prophaned their Characters, and
went in a decent Manner to the <HI>Musaeum,</HI> where we
took our respective Seats, as innocently in Appear∣ance,
as if nothing had happened, though well
pleased in our Conceits at the good Success of
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
what we had so long and so earnestly wished for.
The Scullion had no sooner freed himself from his
Hood-wink, and recovered his lost Sight, but he
ran crying out, <HI>le Diable, le Diable,</HI> with the utmost
Speed into the Kitchen, and there after having re∣covered
his Breath, recounted the dismal Story to
his Fellow-Servants, who were all amazed, and
sorely affrighted lest the same Devils should unex∣pectedly
surprize and punish them for the said Of∣fence.
However, when the pannic Fear and Ter∣ror
they were in, was something abated, they in a
whole Posse, with the injured Party at their Head,
went to the Prior, and loudly exclaimed against
the Insult and barbarous Treatment of their Coun∣tryman,
by those <HI>Bougre de Chiens,</HI> or <HI>English Dogs,</HI>
as they were pleased to call us, his Students. The
Prior calmly heard their just Accusation, and faith∣fully
promised them, in <HI>Verbo Sacerdotis,</HI> to redress
their Grievances, and inflict condign Punishment
on those who should be sound guilty of this vil∣lainous
and unpardonable Act of Cruelty. Accord∣ingly
he came into the <HI>Musaeum,</HI> and cast a piercing
and observant Look over all the Scholars, hoping
thereby to discern by their Countenances, who
were the guilty Persons; but as the most sagacious
and cunning, are sometimes deceived, so was he.
All his Artifices proved ineffectual, and therefore,
he with Reason good, as we were formerly prov'd
guilty of a Misdemeanor, positively charged us
with the Fact, and called us one by one, into a
private Room, for further Examination; but we,
who were alway true to each other, absolutely de∣nied
that we either directly or indirectly, were
privy to, or knew any Thing of what we were
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
thus charged with: And I, for my Part, to clear
myself and Co-partners in the Crime, swore by the
Holy Cross of Christ, that then stood on a Table,
in the Room, that we were no ways accessary, or
concerned in the Commission of this horrid Vil∣lainy,
and in Confirmation thereof on bended
Knees, kissed and embraced the same. This so∣lemn
Protestation had its desired Effect, and the
Prior being thoroughly satisfied with this frank and
unprecedented Manner of acquitting ourselves, af∣terwards
treated us with more than usual Marks of
his Civility and Esteem. Nor was it ever known
during my Stay in the College, who were the Au∣thors
of the abovementioned Riot,</P>
<P>Affairs being thus happily accommodated, all
Things seemed to bear the chearful Air of Joy,
Peace and Tranquility, and I plyed my Studies so
very diligently, that for the two following Years,
I had the Honour to receive the annual Praemiums,
given for the Encouragement of the industrious
Student. Now the Eyes of the whole Synod
was fix'd on me, of whom they had great Hopes,
if they could by any Means or Arguments induce
me, to relinquish all Thoughts of a gay and se∣cular
Life, and embrace a religious Monastical
State, and to accomplish this their Design, they
treated me in a Manner different from that used
towards the rest of my Contemporaries, and by
their artful and engaging Behaviour easily per∣suaded
me to promise that, with my Father's Consent and Approbation, I would accept of the Habit,
and add one more to the Number of the Faithful.
But mark how Providence, by an unexpected and
unforeseen Accident, subverted and frustrated wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
they with so much Art had endeavoured to obtain.
As by the Benevolence, and kind Indulgence of
my Father, I was constantly supplied with Money,
I frequently went into the Town, partly for my
Recreation, and partly to improve myself in the
French Language, which I was very desirous to
become Master of, and therefore one <HI>Thursday</HI> in
the Afternoon, which is always a Holyday with
us, I asked Leave of the Prefect for me and my
Companion, <HI>Roger Meynel,</HI> to go out and walk
on the Ramparts. The Prefect being vexed at
some Disappointment or other, was in a sullen
morose Humour, and theresore denied our Re∣quest.
Exasperated at this unexpected Denial,
we determined <HI>Nolens Volens</HI> to accomplish our
Intent, and thus resolved, we boldly went out at
the Convent-Gate, into the Town, and from
thence to a Tavern, where we gave a loose to
Pleasure and revelled at large, till we were weary
and intoxicated with Liquor, and then to sober
ourselves we stagger'd about an Hour on the
Ramparts; not unobserved by many, and from
thence we reel'd Home, but had the Wit to steal
privately to Bed: When the Bell rang to Supper,
we being missing, were enquired for; however,
Answer was made by some of our Friends, that
we were taken ill and gone to Bed. This Excuse
pass'd for two or three Days, till a Gentleman who
knew us, came to visit the Prior, and informed
him in what a scandalous, foolish Condition we
had been observed on the publick Ramparts, which
so highly incens'd our Governor, that after several
Reprimands, he ordered us both to be smartly
slogg'd. I was then in Poetry, and therefore was
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
so highly exasperated at this Insult, that I resolved
to lay aside all thoughts of any further Progress in
my Learning, and therefore betook myself to a
sullen and continued Silence, which I strictly ob∣served
for near a Month, and no Persuasions were
able to alter my perverse Disposition, till Father
<HI>Howard</HI> took me to task, and by his winning Af∣fability,
prevail'd on my sullen Temper. This
Gentleman indulged me with the free Use of his
Chamber, where I spent my leisure Hours with
the umtost Pleasure in the Perusal of his Books,
and was highly delighted with his ingenious Re∣marks
and Observations, on such Authors as best
suited my Genius, and heightened the natural Con∣ceptions
of my growing Capacity. Thus having
relinquished all Desires of coming to England, I
closely followed my Studies, and having ran
through all the Classicks, I proceeded to Philo∣sophy,
pass'd through my Dialect of Logick, and
was just entring upon a Course of Metaphysicks,
when an Order came for my immediate return
Home.</P>
<P>This unexpected News greatly surprized the
whole House, and the Prior with my Consent
wrote to my Father, in the most moving Terms,
urg'd the future Advantage I should reap by a full
Conclusion of what I had so happily began; but
all his Endeavours were in vain, for the old Gen∣tleman
remained inflexible, and once more sent a
positive Order for my Removal, and also for five
Guineas for my Return Home. Thus having
bid adieu, and taken my last Farewell of the Re∣ligious,
and all my Fellow-Students, with Tears
in my Eyes, I took Coach to St. <HI>Omers.</HI> We had
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
not drove above a Mile or two out of Town, but
my gloomy Melancholy was dispers'd and dissipat∣ed,
by the Sprightliness and Alacrity of my Fellow-Travellers,
consisting of two <HI>French</HI> Officers and
three Ladies. The Thoughts of a College Life,
were now turned into Gaiety and Pleasure, and I
was emulous to outshine the Officers in Point of
Complaisance to my fair female Companions. At
Night we arrived at St. <HI>Omers,</HI> where we had an
elegant Supper, and spent the Evening with the
utmost Mirth and Delight. The Ladies being
excused from any Part in the Reckoning, accord∣ing
to the Custom of <HI>France.</HI> From thence I took
Post to <HI>Calais,</HI> and lodged at the Sign of the <HI>Ville
des Londres</HI> (or the City of <HI>London</HI>) where I met
with several <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen and Ladies that
were waiting a Passage to <HI>England.</HI> Next Day hav∣ing
a Letter of Recommendation to my old Friend
Mr. <HI>Francia,</HI> I went and din'd with him, who ge∣nerously
offered me the free Use of his House dur∣ing
my stay at <HI>Calais</HI>; but pleased with the Va∣riety
of diverting Company at my Inn, I modestly
declined his courteous Offer, because thereby I
had a greater Freedom of indulging my juvenile
Follies and Extravagancies. The Wind continuing
<HI>N. W.</HI> for near three Weeks, no Vessel could stir
out of the Harbour, wherefore my Money being
almost exhausted by this unexpected Delay, I was
obliged to make Proof of Mr. <HI>Francia's</HI> Friend∣ship,
who procured me a Passage on board the
<HI>Mary</HI> Sloop, Capt. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> who quartered at the
same Inn with me and the rest of the Company,
who were all his Passengers. At last the Wind
chopping about to the Southward, we all embark'd,
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
cast of from the Key, and had a pleasant Passage
to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where we went ashore, and supped at
the <HI>Faulcon</HI> Tavern and drank plentifully; but
here I confess I sat on Thorns, for having expend∣ed
all my Money, I was at a great Loss how to
discharge my Share of the Reckoning. At last I
assumed an Air of Boldness, and putting my Hand
in my Pocket, asked the Gentleman that sat next
to me, if he would favour me with Change of a
Pistole, telling him that I had no <HI>English</HI> Coin;
the Gentleman replied, Sir, a Crown is at your Ser∣vice.
I humbly thank'd him and readily accepted
the pleasing Proffer, which was sufficient to dis∣charge
my Dividend of the Reckoning; highly
delighted at my good Luck, and the generous
Treatment of a Stranger.</P>
<P>At last we arrived at <HI>Tower-stairs,</HI> and having
returned many Thanks to the abovementioned
Gentleman, and gave him Directions where my
Father liv'd, I took my leave of the rest of the
Company, went ashore, and call'd a Coach, and
order'd him to drive to <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</HI> My
Father was standing at his Door, but scarcely knew
me, habited like a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and dressed <HI>Ala∣mode
de Paris,</HI> till at last recovering himself from
his Surprize, he took me into the Parlour and
there tenderly embraced me. Numbers of the
Neighbours came to compliment me on my safe
return Home. Sometime after I had refreshed my∣self,
the good old Gentleman asked me, what
Course of Life I was willing to embrace, for my
future Support and Maintenance. I proposed the
Study of the Law, or Physic, both which the re∣jected,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
and I at last by his earnest Sollicitations,
was bound Apprentice to him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Gilpin,</HI> (my Fellow Apprentice)
having then about one Year and a half to serve, my
Father made use of this Opportunity, of giving
me a further Education, and more suitable for the
Transaction of Public Business than the former,
and therefore he sent me to Mr. <HI>Yeate</HI>'s Academy,
in <HI>Chancery-Lane,</HI> there to be perfect in Arithme∣tic.
He likewise provided me a <HI>French</HI> Master,
who daily came to instruct me in the Theory of
that useful Language, of which before I had no∣thing
but the practick Part. In the Evening, I
went to a <HI>German</HI> Limner, in <HI>Craven-Buildings,</HI>
there to learn that noble and ingenious Science of
Drawing, so vastly beneficial in all the Stages of
human Life. Thus for a considerable Time, my
Thoughts were wholly intent on the Pursuit of the
abovementioned Accomplishments; till by Degrees
falling into Company with some other gay Sparks▪
I grew weary of my habitual Exercises, and soo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
found that my weekly Allowances was not suffi∣cient
to furnish out those frequent Excursions. and
Irregularities, that my unlimitted Desires urged on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and excited by lewd Company, often subjecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

(though at first with an Intent to repay) from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
several Quantities of old Silver, that were brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into the Shop, and was grown so expert and cun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning

be any Ways concerned in such base wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Practices.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25"/>
One Summer's Evening being sent with a Bag
of Plate to a Gentleman's House in <HI>Grosven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
square,</HI> as I crossed <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> I cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced to
meet with a beautiful Lady, well dressed and gay,
who by her airy Appearance, seemed to be a W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣man
of the Town; this Nymph, so struck me at
the first Sight, that I resolved at all Events to fol∣low
her Home, which as it happened was not far
off that Part of the Town, being the usual Resi∣dence
for those of her Stamp. In short, seeing her
go into a House, I thought myself secure, and
went to a neighbouring Publican's, where calling
for a Quartern of Brandy, by the Description of
my fair Charmer, I soon found that that was the
usual Place of her Residence and Abode. How∣ever,
having then a Charge of Plate, and being in
a Dishable, I durst not presume to gratify my ar∣dent
Desires with my fair <HI>Phillis</HI> for the present,
but resolved at all Events to visit her, the <HI>Sunday</HI>
following, and therefore I discharged my Trust
and went Home. Her lovely Form, filled my
Soul, and therefore all my earnest Care and Study
was, how to raise Money sufficient to indulge and
gratify my eager Wishes in the Possession of those
Charms, with which I was so passionately enamour'd.
Now Fortune, by the following unexpected Ac∣cident,
gave me an Opportunity to furnish myself
with a Sufficiency to execute my amorous Exploit.
My Father according to Custom, being gone to
smoak a Pipe after Dinner, I was left alone in the
Shop, and knowing that he would not return in
less than an Hour, I thought this a proper Time to
execute my intended Project; then going to his
Desk, to my great Joy and Surprize found the
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Key in it, and willingly embracing this favourable
Opportunity, opened the Desk, and took seven
Guineas out of the three several Bags, least that
Sum, if taken out of one, should be missed, and
I suspected of the Fraud. No sooner had I put
the Money in my Pocket, but I called up the
Maid to look after the Shop, whilst I went back∣wards
and hid the Money, least perchance I should
be discovered, and the Cash found upon me. But
the old Gentleman who never kept any regular
Account thereof, never missed it, and I the <HI>Sunday</HI>
following, having dressed myself to the best Ad∣vantage,
put three Guineas of my stolen Treasure
into my Pocket, and about three in the Afternoon
went to visit my lovely Goddess. Her Apartment
was up one-Pair-of-Stairs, well furnished, her At∣tendant
an old superannuated Curtezan, worn out
in the Wars of <HI>Venus,</HI> who in a snuffling Tone,
asked me what I would please to have? I briskly
reply'd, your Lady. Sir, says she, please to walk
in, and she will be here immediately. I obeyed
the old Hag's Command, and seated myself in the
Dining Room, where the old Bawd fatigued me
with the fulsome and impertinent Discourse, con∣cerning
her former antiquated Amours, and de∣sired
me to treat her with a Glass of Wine; I rea∣dily
consented, and flung down two Shillings for a
Bottle; presently after, in came my <HI>Phillis,</HI> I a∣rose,
and paying my Respects, civilly saluted her.
She returned the Compliment, and seating herself
by me, with a pleasing Air of Gaiety, and careless
Negligence, orders her Servant to put on the Tea
Kettle. Her Discourse was melting and amorous,
which so raised my youthful Vigour, that unable
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
any longer to oppose the mighty Force of Love,
with eager Haste, I conducted her to the Bed∣chamber;
but not willing so soon to quit the Com∣pany
of my Darling, I proposed a Supper at the
<HI>Fountain</HI> Tavern, in <HI>Katherine-street,</HI> and she readily
yielded to my Request. But it being Summer-Time,
and a fine Day, I handed her to the above∣mentioned
Place of Rendezvous, but was (to my
Sorrow afterward) observed and taken Notice of
by my Father, who watched my Motions, and saw
me go into the said Tavern. Nevertheless, for
some secret Cause unknown to me, he avoided my
Sight; and I wholly intent on my amorous Dalli∣ances
of Love, never so much as saw him, nor had
the least Suspicion of his being privy to my secret
Amour. In short, we had an elegant Supper,
Arrack Punch, Jellies, and other Provocations to
Lust, and about Three in the Morning I discharg'd
the Reckoning, satisfied my mercenary Nymph for
her Attendance, and well pleased with this my first
Entrance into this new Scene of Life, went
Home, little thinking how dearly I should pay
for so trivial and transitory a Pleasure.</P>
<P>The next Day my Father called me to him, and
with an angry and frowning Countenance, asked me
where I had been Yesterday in the Afternoon, and
what induced me to keep such unreasonable
Hours? I replied that I had been at Church, and
afterwards in Company with two or three of my
Companions. Mr. <HI>Gilpert,</HI> says he, I know your
Tricks, and therefore think myself in Duty bound
to chastise, and restrain your libidinous Excesses, by
a timely and severe Punishment; so taking me
down into the Cellar, he made me strip, and there
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
scourg'd me very heartily with a Horsewhip, and
afterwards ordered that I should not be admitted
again to his Table, until by my future and good
Behaviour, I had amply atoned for my former past
Offence. But this harsh Treatment had not the
desired Effect; for being banished from my Fa∣ther's,
I dined with the Maid, and my Desires
daily waxed more fierce and ardent; wherefore to
appease the Rage and Torrent of Lust, I made a
vigorous Attack on the Servant, who neither
armed with the Shield of Modesty or Virtue, made
a faint Resistance, and soon rendered herself a
Victim. Nor was I wanting in Generosity to my
new and pretty. I cannot omit to tell you, that
one Day having bought a Pair of Gold laced Shoes
for my <HI>Chloe,</HI> (my Father being out) I called her
up into the Parlour, and shut the Shop Door. Ma∣dam,
said I, saluting her; please to accept of this
Trifle, and with it the Heart of your Admirer.
This, I presume, is a Proof of your being sole
Mistress of my Esteem and Affections, which I
shall always maintain fixed and unalterable. Chloe
well pleased with the Present, fondly caressed me,
which so fann'd the amorous Flame, that notwith∣standing
my Father's expected immediate Return,
or any one's coming about Business, I hasten'd to
enjoy her. But as the Devil would have it my
Father knock'd at the Door, at which Confusion
and Shame o'erspread my Countenance. However,
<HI>Chloe</HI> had the good Fortune to get off unperceived
by him, who seeing the lac'd Shoes standing on
the Table, said, Pray whose are these? methink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they are very gay. I replied, Sir, a Lady of
whom I bought some Silver Lace, desir'd she
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
might leave them here till her return. This An∣swer
as I plainly perceived was not satisfactory to
the old Gentleman, who ever after kept a stricter
Eye both on my Conduct in Point of Honesty, and
Behaviour towards the Maid; wherefore I grew
more cautious and artful in tricking him of Cash,
and more vigilant and circumspect in the Pursuit
of my Amours, till having by Hypocrisy, and
a well dissembled good Behaviour, reinstated my
self in the Love and Esteem of my Father.</P>
<P>I was again admitted to his Table, and all for∣mer
Flights of Youth buried in Oblivion, till one
<HI>Sunday</HI> Night coming Home drunk, and finding
no body there, but the Maid, I out of a Frolick,
toyed with her on the Kitchen Floor, but by ill
Fortune was again surpriz'd by my Father, who
contrary to Custom opening the Shutters of the
Kitchen Window, saw me engaging in the amo∣rous
Combat.</P>
<P>The Wench and I were both ignorant of this
unexpected Discovery, and he for that Night took
no Notice thereof; but the next Morning he called
up the Maid, whom he immediately discharged,
and severely reprimanded me, vowing by all that
was good and sacred, that if I ever was guilty of
the like Impudence, he would totally discard, and
turn me like a Vagabond out of Doors; and fur∣thermore
to prevent such Disorders in his House,
he hired a grave, sedate Matron, and who (as he
thought) was past the Follies and Dalliances of
Love; but as there can be no Reason assigned for
that bewitching Passion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o neither the wrinkled
Furrows of her aged Face, nor the Vigilancy of
my Father, were able to restrain my furious and
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
ardent Desires of enjoying that living Sepulchre;
but as Youth and Age are as opposite as Fire and
Water, so the cold and feeble Embraces of this
antiquated Dame, serv'd only to allay and quench
my lustful Ardour, which reillumin'd by the va∣rious
and pleasing Objects of the Town, therefore
in the Bloom of vigorous Youth I pursed the wil∣ling
Fair ones, who tho' like the Apples of <HI>Go∣morrah,</HI>
they appear beauteous and alluring without,
yet are their Insides both rotten and pestilen∣tial.</P>
<P>I soon grew tainted by their poisonous Infection,
for the Cure of which, I secretly apply'd myself to
an able Surgeon, who religiously kept my Secret,
and faithfully discharged his Trust with Honour
and Integrity.</P>
<P>One Evening being in Liquor, as I crossed <HI>Drury
Lane,</HI> I was saluted by a Female, who in a soft
and engaging Voice said, Come my Dear, won't
you give me a Pint of Wine, and as <HI>Bacchus</HI> is
the constant Companion of Love, I replied, Yes,
my Angel; so in I carried her to the <HI>Feathers</HI> Ta∣vern,
up Stairs we went, and I called for a Bottle
of Wine, when as soon as we had drank a Glass
or two a-piece, I grew passionately fond of my
new Prize, which she observing, and seeing me
disguised in Liquor, resolved to make her Market,
and therefore insisted upon Half a Crown before
Hand; I condescended, and foolishly gave it her,
but was then no nearer the Point I aim'd at than
before: Well said she, give me the other two Shil∣lings
and Sixpence, and you shall be feasted, which
I had no sooner parted with, and was preparing for
the wanton Engagement, but upon a Stamp that
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
she gave with her Foot, in rush'd four more bold
Viragoes, who seizing me, held my Hands, and
rifled my Pockets, swearing that if I offered to
make a Noise, or cry out, that they would charge
me with a Constable, for attempting to abuse them.
At the Word Constable, I was sorely affrighted,
fearing I should be exposed, and my Father be∣come
acquainted therewith; wherefore I seem∣ingly
condescended to what I could by no Means
prevent.</P>
<P>When they had robbed me of every Thing valu∣ble
except my Cloaths, they swore they would
strip me, if I did not call for a Bottle of Arrack,
wherefore to prevent the impending Ruin, that
would have proved my total Overthrow, I readily
submitted to their Imposition, and ringing the
Bell odrered the Drawer to bring in my Forfeit,
(for that was the Term they ordered me to make
use of;) no sooner was the Bottle out, but the she
devils disappeared, and left me alone to bemoan
my unfortunate disappointment.</P>
<P>In short, I went to the Bar, and loudly com∣plained
of the ill Treament I had met with, but it
availed nothing, for the Landlady insisted on her
Reckoning, and said, Sir, I know nothing of the
Women, they came in with you, had you applied
to me for a Lady I should have provided you one,
and been accountable for her Civility and good
Behaviour; at length finding it in vain to dispute,
I left my Waistcoat to satisfy her Demands, and
went Home much sobered by the Fright and Sur∣prize
that I had been in.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, standing alone at the Shop Door,
an old Woman came and gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me a Letter sealed with
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
a Thimble, (a Mark peculiar to fallen Women) I
opened it, and found by the Scrawl, that it came from
the Maid whom my Father had formerly discharged
on my Account; the Contents were, that she was big
with Child, and expected in a Fortnight or three
Weeks to be brought to Bed; and therefore if I was
willing to screen myself from Shame and Disgrace,
I must take Care, pursuant to the Directions in the
Letter, either to come and see her, or else send a con∣stant
supply during her lying-in; but that if I failed
to comply with her request, that she should through
necessity be forced to expose me. I was not a little
startled at this sudden, and, as I thought, unreason∣able
demand; however, I gave the Bearer half a
crown for her use, and sixpence for her own trouble in
bringing the unwelcome letter, with a promise shortly
to visit my Molly, and ease her under her misfortunes;
but as the old saying is, <HI>Out of sight out of Mind,</HI>
I forgot my promise, but she strictly observed hers, for
in less than three Weeks she swore the bastard to me▪
and I was taken into custody for the same. Hereupon
I immediately wrote to my father, who came and
passed his word to see the affair compounded, which he
in three days time, upon the payment of 15 <HI>l.</HI> with
the utmost secrecy effected.</P>
<P>This was a standing memorial of my folly, and
therefore to blot out the remembrance of it, I seemed
vastly uneasy and shagrined, insomuch, that my father
took notice thereof, and kindly compassionating my
anxious troubles, and disquietude of mind, gener ously
forgave the offence, and promised never to reflect on
these my former f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights of youth. Having thus freed
myself from this scandalous reflection, I pursued my
former pleasures, and being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in high esteem and
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
credit with my father, I artfully altering the figures
and current of the cash book, amassed together a con∣siderable
sum, which I hid in the cellar, making use
thereof on extraordinary occasions. My reigning fa∣vourit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
were <HI>Molly St. Gerrge, Phebe Player,</HI>
and <HI>Sally King,</HI> with whom I indulged myself in all
libidinous excesses, as often as time or opportunity
would permit.</P>
<P>Being now almost grown to man's estate, and my
father was taken very ill, and obliged to keep his bed,
and therefore the whole charge of the business lay upon
my hands, and to do myself justice, (during the time
of his sickness) I faithfully discharged the great trust
reposed in me; honour, gratitude, and filial duty,
gaining the ascendant over the base allurements of a
depraved nature. Now the good gentleman dying, left
me a large fortune, and a shop well stocked with a∣bundance
of plate, jewels, and other valuable effects,
as also a set of worthy gentlemen for my customers,
who (to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onour and credit be it spoken) dis∣charged
their debts due to the deceased, and continued
their favours to me his unworthy son. My father no∣minated
three Executors, viz. <HI>Francis Cunning,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Richard Lacon,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Gilpin,</HI>
who all unanimously agreed, that I, altho' under age,
should carry on the business, and Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> as an
Overseer and observer of my behaviour in this new
scene of life, boarded with me in the house.</P>
<P>Now the goddess of fortune seemed to shower down
her favours on me, and my trade daily encreasing, I
found it absolutely necessary to hire a journeyman, and
a boy to run on errands. I now totally relinquished
all thoughts of extravagancy, abhorred and detested
my former vicious course of life, and therefore for my
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
instruction and amusement, I furnished myself with a
select library of books, and was so constant and dili∣gent
in my business, that it was the received and ge∣neral
opinion of the town, that young <HI>Langley</HI> would
in a few years gain a plentiful estate; and had I been
so happy as to have maintained the prudent and dis∣creet
Oeconomy that I observed at my first launching
out into the world, I had certainly verified those can∣did
conceptions that the town in general had conceiv'd
of me; for in the first year that I followed business,
upon the ballance of accounts, I found myself 700 <HI>l.</HI>
gainer by my trade, and that more likely to encrease
than diminish, if I trod those paths in which I had so
wisely began. But alass! what is so prevalent on
youth as bad example, disguised under the false pre∣text
of paternal care, and inviolable friendship.</P>
<P>M. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (whom I mentioned before) was the
only acting executor, wherefore to please him was all
my earnest care and study; now this gentleman hav∣ing
imprudently entrusted me with my brother's for∣tunes,
which were 1000 <HI>l.</HI> on the payment of 5 <HI>l.</HI> per
cent, I naturally grew fond of his company, and made
him a present of a gold watch and chain, thinking
thereby, more firmly to rivet myself in his affections,
and wholly engage him to my interest; and by my art∣ful
and engaging behaviour, I won so insensibly upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him, that (laying aside the respect and awe du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to a guardian) he not only reposed an entire confidenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in me, and never examined into the state of my affairs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
but chose, nay even insisted on my being his companion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and partner in his frequent debauches, which by the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
continual repetitions so vitiated my former principle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that the young goldsmith was soon metamorphosed in
to the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use prodigal and spend thrift.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35"/>
Thus having none to awe and restrain my unbound∣less
and unlimited desires, I soon became a profest rake,
and whoremaster; I cannot forget one night, being in
company with <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and having drank very plenti∣fully,
I proposed to conduct him to the apartments of
one of my favourite ladies; he seemed highly pleased
with the proffer, and took coach and drove to madam's
lodgings, who being a well bred woman, entertained us
in a courteous and obliging manner: The old gentle∣man
was soon captivated with her charms, and burn'd
for enjoyment, which I observing, called her aside,
and said, Madam, the gentleman is my uncle, and
therefore I desire you would oblige him, and me also,
in the request I am now going to make you; she, with
a smile consented; whereupon, I ordered her, whilst
the fumbler was in the vain pursuit of delight, to
pick his pocket of some notes that I knew he had
about him. She faithfully performed her promise,
and afterwards gave them into my Hands.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, she and he (after several at∣tempts
to do, what in reality he could not effect) re∣turned
into the dining-room, little thinking of the
merry trick that had been put upon him. To be brief,
we staid till about three in the morning, then calling a
coach, went home.</P>
<P>The next day, recollecting himself where he had
been, and missing his bills, called for me, and acquaint∣ed
me with his loss, and that he suspected that, that
damn'd painted whore had stolen them from him. I
seemed to be in a passion, and sware, that I believed
she would scorn so base an action, but that for his
satisfaction, I would go and enquire into the matter,
and at the same time let him know, that if she had
them, she would insist on a handsome present on the
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
delivery of the same; damn her, says he, give her two
guineas, and place them to my account. Thus the old
gentleman paid the forfeit due to his folly, and Mrs.
<HI>Morris</HI> and I revelled the ensuing night at his cost
and charge. This imposition gave the old fool such a
distaste and abhorrence to the female prostitutes, that
after I had returned him his notes, he solemly vowed
and declared never to converse with any of them for
the future.</P>
<P>Sometime after, (as the Biter is Bit at last) a
Gentleman well dressed, stopt at my Door in a
Coach, and coming into the Shop, complimented
me on my Father's Decease, and expressed the
great Value and Esteem he had for him, and that
upon his Account he was willing to continue his
Favours, for the Encouragement of me his Son.
I humbly thank'd him for his Civility, and told
him, I should strenuously endeavour to maintain
the good Repute, and fair Character of my deceas∣ed
Father, by a strict Adherence to his Principles
of inviolable Honour, and Integrity. He, full
fraught with Deceit, seem'd highly pleased with
my Reply; and therefore, as a seeming Promise of
his Friendship, bespoke 150<HI>l.</HI> worth of Plate, and
after he had given me the Impression of his Coat
of Arms, from a Seal that hung to his Gold
Watch, said, He should be glad to take a Glass of
Wine with me. I was proud of the Honour, and
we went to a neighbouring Tavern, where drink∣ing
plentifully, he took the Opportunity, whilst I
was elevated with Liquor, to propose a Lady to me
in Marriage, who (altho' deform'd) he said, had
50,000<HI>l.</HI> Fortune; and further more he added▪
that she was under his Tuition, and Direction of
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
his Spouse; and that if I pleased to come down to
his Country Seat, he would engage to gain her
Consent, and bring her to a very speedy Compli∣ance.</P>
<P>This artful Bait had its desir'd Effect, for I now
not only look'd on him as a good Customer, but
as a worthy Friend, and therefore I invited him
to Dinner with me the next Day, and he in return
engaged me to sup with him the next Evening at
his Lodgings in Tavistock-Street where an elegant
Entertainment was provided. The Chambers
were richly furnish'd, and illuminated with Wax
Candles▪ in silver Candlesticks, and Sconces, in
the same Metal; two Footmen in lac'd Liveries
waited at Supper, and every Thing augmented
the Opinion I had already received of his being
a Gentleman of a large and plentiful Estate. A∣bout
Twelve I took my Leave of him, and the
next Day gave Orders for getting ready his Plate
as soon as possible, which being done, he in about a
Week's Time came to me; I shew'd him the
Plate, with which he was extreamly pleased, and
highly commended the curious Workmanship
thereof; and said, Sir, Come let's take a Bottle
before we part, for to Morrow Morning I must go
to my Country Seat. I with Pleasure yielded to
his Request, and whilst we were in the Tavern,
he pull'd out his Pocket-Book, and gave me a
Note on a Vintner in Bartholomew-Close, for
150 <HI>l.</HI> payable in three Weeks; saying, Sir, This
I presume is the same to you as ready Cash; but
please for your own Satisfaction, to send immedi∣ately
and enquire into the Character of the Man▪
I readily obey'd his Order, and finding by the
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
Account I receiv'd from my Servant, that the
Vintner was a Person of a fair Character; upon
his Endorsement of the Note, I accepted it in full
Payment for my Goods, and sent the Plate pack'd
up to the Gun Tavern at Billingsgate, pursuant to
his Order; neither did I forget to take a Direction
where he liv'd in the Country, but promised, as
soon as possible to visit my intended▪ wealthy
Bride.</P>
<P>In short, we parted, and I went Home quite
blown up with the aspiring Thoughts of raising my
Fortune at once and making a splendid and gay
Appearance in the World; but as I lay one Night
in my Bed, ruminating on the imaginary Possession
of the Nymph, who (like the Goddess of Riches)
was to load me with her Favours a sudden Thought
eclipsed my Joys, perhaps (says I to myself) I am
deceived, and this great Fortune like Fary-land,
as soon as seen disappears, wherefore I resolv'd to
send to my Neighbour <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (a cunning and artful
Man, whose Veracity and Integrity I had often
experienced) the next Day down to the Gentleman's
Seat, with Orders to make a private Enquiry in
the Neighbourhood, of the Truth and Reality of
what my seeming Friend had given me so fair an
Expectance of. Accordingly I gave him two
Guineas, and loaded with Instructions, he de∣parted.</P>
<P>I was now rack'd with alternate Hope and Fear
till his Return, which was in three Days Time,
when he ingeniously told me, that after the utmost
Search and strictest Scrutiny it was possible for
Man to make, he could not find out, or even hear
of any such Gentleman or Lady that ever lived or
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
resided in that Country. This was shocking News
to me, and I reasonably conjectured, that since
I was deceiv'd in my Mistress, there was also some
Fallacy in the Note he had given me in Payment
for my Goods; but since I had accepted the same,
I knew no other Remedy but to wait with Patience,
till Time should bring to Light the Fraud, and
discover the whole Villainy. As I judged, so it
happened, for on sending my Servant with the
Note, after three Days Grace to demand the Mo∣ney,
the Vintner was gone, and his House shut
up. Highly incens'd at this base and scandalous
Trick I vowed revenge on the pretended Gentle∣man,
and resolved if possible, at all Events, to lay
him by the Heels, and make an Example of him,
to deter others from the like Falshood and Trea∣chery.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight afterwards, a Gentlewoman
came to my Shop, and desired to speak with me
in private; I led her into the Parlour, where she
immediately burst out into Tears, and for some
Time, could not utter a Word, till being recover'd
from her Disorder, she said, Sir, I am ruin'd and
undone for ever, that Villain <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> has imposed on
my Husband's Credulity, and under a Pretence of
raising him 450 <HI>l.</HI> by the Discount of his Notes, to
keep his Payments good with the Wine-Merchant,
has obtain'd three Notes of Hand of him for 150 <HI>l.</HI>
each, which he has paid away, and applied the
Money to his own Use.</P>
<P>This (I confess) at first startled me, but upon a
further enquiry, I found that her husband was the
same person on whom <HI>I</HI> had the abovementioned note,
endors'd to me by the said <HI>Anthony G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> the
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
sham gentleman, and my pretended friend; so com∣miserating
her deplorable circumstances, <HI>I</HI> not only pro∣mised
not to trouble her husband, but also to use my
interest and endeavour with the other gentlemen (my
fellow sufferers in the fraud) to engage them to a com∣pliance,
in granting Mr. <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> her husband, a
letter of licence for three years. Highly satisfied with
this ganerous proffer, and a farther assurance of my
resenting the injury and injustice done both to myself
and her by Mr. <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI>she humbly thank'd me
and departed, leaving directions with me where to
find her husband.</P>
<P>Next Day, according to my promise, I went to
the Gentlemen, who being of tender and human
Dispositions, were easily brought to an Accom∣modation,
wherefore sending for <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> and
an Attorney, we agreed on Terms to the Satisfac∣tion
of all Parties. But one Day walking along
<HI>Fleet Street,</HI> near St. <HI>Dunstan's,</HI> a strange Gentleman
came up to me, and asked me, whether my Name
was not <HI>Langley,</HI> I replied, Yes. Sir, says he,
have you not a Demand on one <HI>Anthony G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>?
Yes, Sir, quoth I, well then said he, we'll step in∣to
the Bull Head, and there I'll inform you further
of the Matter. So in we went, where he told me,
that he had <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> Dead-set,</HI> and that if I would
give him one Guinea, he would engage to have
him in close Quarters in less than an Hour,
Overjoyed at this News, I freely granted him his
Demand, and told him that I would wait there till
his return; but had I been as good as my Word, I
should have staid there till now, for I never saw
him afterwards. This second Bite exasperated me
more than the former, and I resolved if ever I
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
caught <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> to make him pay for all. Where∣fore
I employed a brisk and expert Attorney to
hunt him out, and promised to be accountable for
all Charges in the Execution thereof. At last, I
took the Villain, and clapt him into the <HI>Marshal-Prison,</HI>
where he obliged me to sue him to an Ex∣ecution,
and there he remained during the whole
Time that I continued in Trade.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, I became acquainted with
a Vintner, near Gray's Inn Gate, in Holborn,
with whom I contracted such an Intimacy that very
Evening I paid a Visit, and he was foolishly fond
of Horse Racing, Cock Fighting, Hunting, and
the like expensive and costly Pastimes, and Diver∣sions,
and being a constant Attendant at <HI>Newmarket</HI>
Seasons, kept a good Gelding for that Purpose.
Being daily at his House, he often sollicited me to
accompany him thither, and greatly enlarged on
the Grandeur of the Assembly, and the Variety of
Recreations and Amusements that presented them∣selves,
for the Delight of the curious Spectators.
At last, I yielded to his Request, and furnished
myself with a good Saddle Horse, and other
Jockey-like Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rements, suitable to the Hu∣mour
of such vain and giddy Fools, who neglect∣ing
their proper Employments, endeavour to shine
in a Sphere of Life, that renders them the Scorn
and Contempt of Men of Fortune.</P>
<P><HI>Newmarket</HI> is seated in a Bottom, and hath no∣thing
to recommend it, but the extravagant Im∣position
of the Inn-keepers, occasioned by the nu∣merous
Concourse of hair-brained Fellows, that
swarm like Ants in a Mole Hill, whilst the rascally

<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
<HI>Exchange Alley,</HI> a little before the Drawing of
a State Lottery. A little after Four, at the
solemn Beat of a Drum, the Horses start, and the
whole Host, like a Company of wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> in a
confused and promiscuous Rout, scour after them
without Rhime or Reason, and at the Turn of the
Lands, set up as hideous an Out-cry, as a Parcel
of naked Wenches discovered bathing in a River;
some damning the Riders, and others the Horses,
for losing the Heat, whilst the Winners laugh in
their Sleeves, and pay as much Reverence and Ho∣mage
to the Victor, led into the Town, as the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
do at present to any of their most celebrated
<HI>Pagods.</HI> Here it was that I first caught the ruin∣ous
Itch of Gaming, which was ever after so pre∣valent,
that I could not see a Box and Dice, but I
was as fond of the Gewgaw as a Child is of a Rattle,
and at first (as the old Saying is, <HI>the Devil is kind to
a young Gamester</HI>) I won upwards of 700 l. and had
the Wit and Discretion to carry it off; but this
was but a glimmering of life, that vainly buoys
up the departing Patient, before the fatal approach
of Death; for in less than six Months, I doubled
the Loss of my former Gain, and by my too fre∣quent
Extravagancies, now found my Circum∣stances
in a melancholy Posture, and my Substance
vastly impaired; however, I play'd my Cards so
artfully, that none of my Creditors ever suspected
me in the least guilty of so much Imprudence and
Folly.</P>
<P>One Day being at my Friend the Vintner's
House, he called me aside, and desired me to take
his Niece to my Service; I readily condescended,
and giving my old Servant a Month's Warning,
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
prepared for the Reception of the new one, whom,
on her Uncle's Account, I always used with the
utmost Civility and good Manners. In short, af∣ter
she had been with me a Month, I discovered
something so innocent and modest in her Behaviour,
that so insensibly stole upon me, that in despite of
my vicious and inordinate Desires, her Virtue so
awed and restrained my villainous Intentions, that
for some Time, I durst not approach her but with
the utmost Respect and Modesty, till one fatal
Night to her, coming Home a little elate with
Liquor, I called for a Bottle of Wine, and desired
her Company to partake of it; she with a Blush
modestly excused herself, which rather heightened
than diminished my Passion; and therefore I in∣sisted
on her Compliance with my friendly Re∣quest;
she consented, and I took this favourable
Opportunity to acquaint her with my sincere Love,
and Esteem; then turning the Discourse to an amo∣rous
Scene, gave her to understand, by a double
Entendre, the Meaning of my foul Design. Whe∣ther
her amorous Star had then the Ascendant, I
soon read her approaching Destiny, who was then
upon the Point of being ruined by me, without
any Regard to my former Esteem for her, or the
Friendship I had long professed to her Uncle; such
Is the Worth of a Man given up to Lust, and of
such Value his Friendship.</P>
<P>My own House, which before seemed to me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prison, was now changed into a perfect <HI>Elysium▪</HI>
and I neither knew, nor wished for any greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Bliss, than the Pleasure of my never to be forgot∣ten
<HI>Clarinda's</HI> Society, for she disdained all merce∣nary
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>
Ends, and was far more deserving of being
the legal Partner of a Marriage Bed, than Mistress
of a lawless Love, that sometime or other would
prove her Ruin.</P>
<P>In short, had I been so happy and prudent, as to
have made her my Wife, I am well assured, that
the Union of the sacred Knot, would have ex∣empted
me from various Inconveniences, that de∣stable
Poverty and horrid Want in the Sequal ex∣posed
me to. During the Heat of my Amour, I
had several advantageous Offers of Marriage pro∣posed
to me, which I declined for the following
Reason, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Parents or Friends of such
young Ladies that were actually in a Capacity to
bestow on them large Fortunes, insisted on proper
Settlements for their Daughters, and also an exact
Scrutiny into my Affairs, which although by my
artful and deceitful Conduct, appeared to be in a
flourishing Condition, yet if nicely examined into,
there was nothing to be found, but the Ruins, and
poor Remains of a shattered Fortune; for by this
Time I had obtained a considerable Credit from se∣veral
Merchants in Jewels, and by the punctual
Payment of my Bills, my Notes passed as current
as those of the <HI>Bank,</HI> and I confequently was re∣puted
a great and eminent Trader, particularly in
that most advantageous and profitable Part of Bu∣siness;
but alass! to my Sorrow, I only fulfilled
the old <HI>English</HI> Proverb, <HI>Robbing</HI> Peter to <HI>pay</HI>
Paul; for under the specious Pretence of disposing
of the abovementioned Goods to Persons of Qua∣lity,
I secretly pawned them to those, who out of
a sordid Lucre of Gain, and an avaracious Desire of
<PB N="46" REF="46"/>
more than legal Interest, supplied me with what
Cash I required, and by their Indiscretion and Fol∣ly,
in relyiag on my Integrity, suffered them to be
greatly imposed upon by me, who frequently bor∣rowed
larger Sums on those Goods, than what I
had contracted to pay for them.</P>
<P>By this Means I had always a large Quantity of
Money at my Command, and thinking this Arti∣fice
would always pass undiscovered, I liv'd more
like an Heir apparent to a great Estate, than a
wary and industrious Tradesman. Assemblies,
Opera's, Masquerades, Plays, and Country Jour∣nies,
were now my only Delight, and my
sole favourite Companions, such young Gentle∣men,
who were either in the full Possession
of large Estates, or in a fair Expectation of the
same.</P>
<P>I can't omit, that two of these young Sparks
and I, having made an Agreement to pass a Fort∣night
or three Weeks at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> for the Benefit
of the Air in the Summer Season, we quartered
at the <HI>Greyhound</HI> Inn there; when one Evening
over a merry Bottle, a Proposal was made to pa∣trole
through the Town in quest of Ladies of
Pleasure, which was readily agreed too by all Par∣ties;
but finding none there either handsome enough
or fitting for our Purposes, I immediately pro∣posed
to return to <HI>London,</HI> and bring down three
of the best of that Stamp, that I could find were
willing to indulge themselves with the Diversions
of a Country Life. My Companions highly ap∣plauded
my Design, and I took a pair of Oars,
which presently wasted me to <HI>Temple-Stairs,</HI> where
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
as soon as I landed, I went in Pursuit of my Game,
and being well known to the Porter at the <HI>Rose</HI>
in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> to him I apply'd for the Execu∣tion
of my Design.</P>
<P>The Porter went directly out, whilst I called for
a Pint of Wine, to wait for his Return, who in a∣bout
half an Hour's Time brought three wanton
Lasses well dressed, and not disagreeable; I arose,
and saluting them, said, Ladies, please to seat your∣selves;
my Business is to acquaint you, that your
Company is desired for a Fortnight or three Weeks
at Greenwich, where you may be assured to be
treated in the most courteous and polite Manner;
for the Persons that you will have to do with,
are Gentlemen of Honour, and therefore if you
approve of my Proposal, please to provide your∣selves
with such Linnen and Apparel as you shall
think proper for your Use, during your Resi∣dence
in the Country, I'll remain here an Hour
longer; so Ladies, if ye are willing, go and pre∣pare
yourselves for the Journey. They unani∣mously
agreed, and dropping a Curtisie at their go∣ing
out of the Room, returned with their Bag∣gage
within the Time appointed. I called a Coach
and drove to the <HI>Temple Stairs,</HI> where I took a Pair
of Oars, and landed at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> but not without
the repeated Insults of opprobious Language, com∣monly
used by the Vulgar on the <HI>Thames</HI>; how∣ever,
my Female Companions verified the Latin
Adage, <HI>Nemo me impune lacessit,</HI> and returned their
Scurrility with as smart and satyrical repartees, as
if they had served a seven Years Apprenticeship
to any of the most celebrated Fishwomen at <HI>Bil∣lingsgate.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48"/>
I looked upon myself now as an Eastern Mo∣narch,
bearing as absolute Sway in my floating
Seraglio, as the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> ever did in his
sumptuous Edifice at <HI>Constantinople.</HI> In short I
conducted the Ladies to the <HI>Greyhound</HI> Inn, where
my Companions were with Impatience, waiting
for my Return. Upon our Entrance into the
Room, they civilly complimented the Women,
and we being all seated, I said, Gentlemen, I pre∣sume
I have answered your Expectations, and
honourably discharged my Trust, please therefore
to take the first Choice, and the Nymph that hath
not the Honour to please either of you, shall be
the Co-Partner of my Bed, and be taken under
immediate Care and Protection. This generous
Offer augmented their Delight, and each <HI>Pyramis</HI>
chose his favourite <HI>Thisbe.</HI> Now nothing was to
be seen but perfect Harmony, and an uninterrupt∣ed
Scene of Joys, the Gods of Love and Wine,
by alternate Possession, resided in our Hearts, nor
were the <HI>Sylvan</HI> Deities exempt from participating
the mutual and transporting Pleasures that we ful∣ly
possessed, in the shady Retirement of the ad∣jacent
Park; but those soft and endearing Caresses
of our amorous Goddesses, by reiterated Repi∣titions,
grew dull and infipid, and we cloy'd and
wearied with the continual Performance of daily
Sacrifice to the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Dame, resolved to put a
merry Trick upon the Ladies, and leave them in
the Lurch.</P>
<P>One Day after we had dined, we desired them to
go and walk in the Park, and we would follow im∣mediately
and order the Tea-kettle, and other Ne∣cessaries,
to be brought up with us thither.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49"/>
They seemed well pleased with our Request, and
readily obeyed, whereupon we called our Landlord, and
paid him his Bill, and then crossed the Water to the
<HI>Isle of Dogs,</HI> where we spent the Remainder of the
Day in Mirth and Jollity, highly diverted that we
had bilked the Prostitutes of their expected Fare.
They walked in the Park a long Time, and seeing no
Appearance of us, or the Servant of the House, re∣turned
to the Inn, and on Enquiry, finding that we
were gone, (as the Landlord told them by our Order)
to London, they quarrelled with each other for their
Folly, in complying with our Request, before they had
had Satisfaction for their Ware; but finding it in
vain to trifle away their Time in railing and scolding to
no Purpose, they hired a Pair of Oars for <HI>London</HI>
and as ill Fortune would have it, our Boats both met
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver-against <HI>Cuckolds Point</HI>; they immediately set
up a Cry, that both alarmed and surprized us, the
Female Virago's were for boarding, but we sheered off
as fast as we could, and encouraging our Watermen to
make Way, we in spite of our Adversaries, kept a∣bout
sour Boats Length a-head of them, but were
forced to bear the Lash of their Tongues, till we got
within three or four Yards of the Landing Place of
the <HI>Temple,</HI> and then we jumped ashore, making the
best of our Way to one of the Gentlemen's Chambers,
to prevent the Scandal and Disturbance that would
have ensued, had they come up with us.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, a married Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, desired me to accompany him and his
Spouse to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to which I readily assented, be∣ing
glad of the Opportunity to make knownn my Affec∣tions
to Miss <HI>Jenny,</HI> their Chambermaid, we stopt
at the Gun Tavern at <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> and put three
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>
Bottles of Wine into the Boat, to animate our Spirits,
and excite Mirth and Gaiety in our Passage to the in∣tended
Port. The Gentleman asked me, if I could re∣commend
him to an Inn? Yes, Sir, I replyed, and
the best in Town, where I have been very civilly en∣tertained,
the Landlord knows me perfectly well, and
I'll engage that you and your Lady shall be accommo∣dated
to the utmost of your Desires; and as for Miss
<HI>Jenny,</HI> says I, in a jocose Manner, I'll recommend
her to a brisk young Fellow, that's worth Money,
though he serves as a Drawer in the House; <HI>Jenny</HI>
blushed, the Lady laughed, and my Friend drank
a brave Bumper to the good Success of this new A∣mour.</P>
<P>In an Hour's Time we landed, and I led the Way
to my Inn the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> where the Master expressed
a great Satisfaction in seeing me, and returned me
Thanks for the Favour I did him, in recommending
his House. Here we ordered a Supper, and <HI>I</HI> took an
Opportunity, whilst <HI>Jenny</HI> was in the Kitchen, to let
her know how passionately I loved her, and by a sted∣fast
Observance of her Eyes, found that my Proposals
were not disagreeable; wherefore I holdly urged her to
yield to my Embraces, could it be managed with Se∣crecy;
whereupon I faithfully promised to contrive the
Matter with so much Privacy ond Cunning, that
none in the House should have the least Occasion to
dream or suspect any Thing of our Amour. With
this solemn Assurance of Secrecy, confirmed with a
Volley of Oaths and Imprecations, <HI>Jenny</HI> consented,
and the only Difficulty remaining was, to engage the
Chambermaid to be faithful to her Trust; wherefore
I immediately took her aside, and sliding half a Gui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
into her Hand, imparted my Design to her, who
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
promised to perform her Part to my Satisfaction. At
Supper we were exceeding merry▪ amd I was highly
pleased at the Conceit of my new Favourite, when we
ogled each other as the Figures in an old Suit of
Hangings.</P>
<P>The Hour of Repose drawing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh, my Friend
called to the Chambermaid to shew him a Room
with two Beds in it, one for himself and Spouse,
and the other for Miss Jenny, who (the Lady be∣ing
big with Child) was de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired might lie in the
same Chamber with them; but it was all in vain,
for the artful Hussey, well vers'd in Intrigues,
with an hypocritical Cant and Smile, declared, that
would the Gentleman give her fifty Pounds, she
could not oblige him with that Favour, for all the
Rooms (except those reserved for our Lodgings)
were taken up and engaged. The Gentleman be∣ing
an easy credulous Person, believed what she
said was true, so ordering her and Jenny to light
them to bed, took his Leave of me for that Night.
As soon as they were gone up Stairs, I called for a
Bottle of Wine, and sat smoaking my Pipe with
Impatience, waiting the Return of my Mistress,
who as soon as she had undressed her Lady, and put
her to bed, came and sat down by me, and pre∣sently
after in came my true and faithful Confident,
whom I desired to sit down and bear us Company.
When the Bottle was out, I desired her to shew us
to our Room, and bring a Cool-Tankard with her
up Stairs. The Chamber we lay in was up two
Pair of Stairs backwards, and commodiously con∣trived
for the like Intrigues, for there was two
Doors to it, and a private Pair of Stairs, unknown
to any but us, and the People of the Inn; so
<PB N="52" REF="52"/>
that supposing the Gentleman had had any Suspi∣cion,
and should have attempted (if he had known
my Apartment) to surprize us, it was morally
impossible that he should succeed in his Design, for
as I locked the Door fronting the great Stair-case,
before we went to bed, so I could easily have con∣cealed
my Doxy, by turning her out at the pri∣vate
Stairs; but, poor Gentleman, he, I suppose,
had something else to think on, for although Jenny
and I lay together during our whole Stay there, nei∣ther
he or his Spouse ever imagined any thing of
the Matter. In about ten Days we returned to
London, where I visisted him as usual, and by pri∣vate
Billets appointed my Charmer at the <HI>Blue Posts</HI>
without <HI>Temple Bar</HI>; she was truly observant to my
Assignations, managed her growing Burthen so art∣fully,
that although she lay with the other Maid,
yet neither she, nor her Lady, for a very consi∣derable
Time, observed that she was with Child,
till at last unable to conceal▪ her public Shame any
longer, she quitted her Service, and took private
Lodgings, from whence she daily plagued me
with fulsome Letters stuffed with Nonsence and
Love, with which (being pretty well cloyed) the
Remembrance of her former Embraces was grown
not only grating but loathsome. However, rather
than to suffer her to lay the Child to me, I ap∣pointed
her a Meeting, where to acquit myself
with Honour, I gave her a Purse of Guineas, and
there took my final Leave of her, neither have I
ever heard of her since, nor would the Gentleman
or his Lady have been acquainted with this our A∣mour,
had I not now published it to the World.
But notwithstanding these Excesses, <HI>Clarinda,</HI> by
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
Merit claimed the greatest Share of my Affecti∣ons;
and being acquainted with all my Follies and
Extravagancies, she often with an engaging and
persuasive Air, represented the dismal State of
Want and griping Penury, which she clearly fore∣saw
must be the future Issue of my profuse and
licentious Manner of Life; and as often with re∣peated
Assurances of real Love and sincere Friend∣ship,
warmly pressed me to desist, and leave my
vicious Courses; but all her Tears and amicable
Admonitions prov'd abortive, and unable to curb
and restrain me in the full Career of my lawless
Passions, that blindly hurried me on to my utter
Ruin. However, to do her Justice, although she
knew the Parties of whom I had borrow'd consider∣able
Sums of Money, and doubtless might by a
Discovery of my Affairs, been amply rewarded
by them; yet so extensive was the Generosity of
her Soul, that she disdain'd so vile and sordid a
Practice, and detested and abhorred such mean and
mercenary Views.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, I went to <HI>Windsor,</HI> with
my particular and worthy Friend Capt. L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, his
Spouse, and a young Lady a Relation of his. We
were very merry in our Journey, and during our
Residence there, we enjoyed all the Diversion of a
rural Life, for having a▪ Coach and four at Com∣mand,
we took the Benefit of the Morning Air
in the Park, and her Grace the Dutchess of <HI>Marl∣borough,</HI>
being then in <HI>London,</HI> we frequently vi∣sited
her Lodge, celebrated for its curious and in∣imitable
Pieces of Painting; and in the Afternoon
drove to the antient College of Eton, fam'd for
Learning, and so eminent in the Numbers of bright
<PB N="54" REF="54"/>
and ingenious Gentlemen, who are deservedly
deem'd the Pride and Glory of their Country;
Nor was the Castle unobserv'd, that noble and
magnificent Structure, so much honoured with the
Presence of our ancient Monarchs, and greatly or∣namented
and embellish'd by various and bizarre
Figures, form'd in different Shapes, from Num∣berless
Arms, by the ingenious and artful Contri∣vers.
Here is also a beauteous Terras, command∣ing
a delightful Prospect of all the adjacent Coun∣try,
and from whence the curious Spectators are
gratified with a View of the stately Cathedral of
St. <HI>Paul's</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> Love and Gallantry were
now the fole Topicks of our Conversation, and
the young Lady being single, I made honourable
Proposals of Love to her, with which neither she,
nor the Captain or his Lady, were in the least dis∣pleased.
In a Fortnight's Time we returned to
Town, and stopped at the St. <HI>Alban's</HI>-Tavern in St.
<HI>Alban's-Street,</HI> where we ordered a Supper and the
Footman to bring the Arms that we carry'd into
the Country for our Safeguard and Defence into
our Room. After Supper, we drank plentifully,
and Wine growing more potent than Reason, the
Captain (for variety Sake) would kiss my fair Com∣panion,
whereby I thinking my Property infring'd
opposed his Intent, upon which Words arose, and
the Pistols lying on a Marble Slab in the Room,
we each of us hastily snatch'd up one of them, and
presenting, attempted to give Fire; but were pro∣videntially
disappointed in our Design, by the Di∣ligence
and Care of the Footman, who had un∣loaded
them, well knowing the capricious Temper
of his Master, when disguis'd in Liquor. The
<PB N="55" REF="55"/>
Ladies were sorely affrighted at this surprizing
Rencountre, and skream'd out, at which the
Landlord and his Drawers came in upon us, and
seeing us (for we had thrown down our Arms)
hard at it with our Fists, parted us, and calling two
Coaches sent us home to our respective Habita∣tions.
Next Morning when I awak'd, I was igno∣rant
of what had happened, and about Eleven the
Captain came to see me, then we went to take our
Mornings Draught, when, upon saying what
News, Sir? News, quoth he, my Wife tells me
that you and I were going to murther one another
last Night, on Miss <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s Account, but I declare
upon Honour, that I knew nothing of it, and
since it was a mad Frolick, I'll engage the young
Lady to be at my House this Evening, and shall
expect your Company there likewise. I punctually
obey'd his Orders, and we spent the Evening very
agreeably, all Strife and Contention gave Place
to Mirth and Gaiety: We ask'd the Ladies Pardon
for putting them in a Fright, which they readily
granted, and Miss <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> with a pleasing and jo∣cose
Air, added, that she had conceiv'd a much
better Opinion of herself than she ever had before,
since two such Gentlemen, at the hazard of their
Lives, had contended for her Favours; whereupon
bowing we returned the Compliment, and it now
growing late, I waited on Miss Home. All Night
I was no more Master of my own Person, but
pass'd the tedious Night rack'd with alternate Hope
and Fear. The next Evening, I sent for the Cap∣tain
to the Queen's-Head Tavern in <HI>Holhorn,</HI> and
there (to ease my Torment) disclos'd my ardent
Passion; he Gentleman-like, in an open and free
<PB N="56" REF="56"/>
Manner told me that her Fortune was but small,
and that too, in the Hands of those who he feared
would not, without Difficulty, surrender it. How∣ever,
said he, if you are upon honourable Terms,
I'll use my interest to bring Miss to a Compliance.
Sir, says I, I should think myself undeserving of
that Frieudship you always professed for me, should
I even presume to entertain the least Glympse of
a dishonourable Thought for a young Lady any
ways releated to your worthy Family. Hereupon
the Captain well pleased with my generous Reply,
told me where her Uncle lived, and in a friendly
Manner advised me to apply to him, who being a
Gentleman of Fortune, if he approved of my
Proposal, would inevitably compel her Guardians
to pay her Fortune upon the Marriage Day. Pur¦suant
to my Friend's good Counsel, I went to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Uncle and to him opened the whole Affair, who
seemed very willing for the Match, and promised
his Friendly Assistance, for the Recovery of her
Fortune.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained, but the usual Ceremony
of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew Days Courtship, and therefore I, with
free Consent and Permission of her Friends, visited
her daily; but as the old Saying is, many Things
happen between the Cup and the Lip, for this
young Lady had a younger Sister, who for the
first two or three Days that I went to the House
treated me with an Air of Indifferency, even littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Inferior to that of Ill-manners. However, I too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
no Notice of it, but continuing my Courtship a
usual, I soon saw the Scene was changed, for sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it seems at my first coming, being ignorant of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Intent, resolved to resent the Affront, which sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
thought was offered her, in preferring her Sister's
Company to hers, when we went the above men∣tioned
Journey. Being apprized hereof, I com∣municated
it the Captain, and desired him to use
his Endeavours to repair the Breach, and appease
the young Lady's seeming Indignation. He at first
seemed to slight the Affair, as merely trivial and
frivolous, till seeing me very urgent and impor∣tunate,
he then promised his friendly Assistance to
accommodate the seeming Difference, and there∣fore
gave the two Sisters and me an Invitation to
sup at his House. After Supper, he very genteely,
and with so much Prudence, excused both himself
and me, in the Choice of our Companion to <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI>
that they were both highly pleased, and were
extreme good Company, particularly Miss <HI>Fanny,</HI>
who was naturally of a more gay and airy Temper
than her eldest Sister, and although she had not
the finest of Faces, yet so graceful was her Air,
so easy and engaging her Behaviour, and so soft and
alluring her Voice, not strained by Art, but by
the meer Effect of the lavish Bounty of Nature,
that she captivated the Hearts of all who had the
Pleasure of her Company; upon the Captain's Re∣quest,
she favoured us with a Tune on the Spinnet,
and to perfect the Musick, joined so melodious a
Voice, that transported with Ravishment and De∣light,
I thought myself in Paradise. 'Twas then,
that I began to repent my Choice. Miss <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s
Charms, once so prevalent, now appeared as mere
Phantoms and Illusions, and <HI>Fanny</HI> reigned sole
Mistress of my Affections.</P>
<P>However, as I thought it was not Prudence in
me to disclose this sudden Change, I behaved my∣self
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
as one indifferent to her, and insensible of those
amicable Qualifications, that she was perfect Mi∣stress
of. In short, having paid our Compliments
to our generous Host and Hostess, I waited on the
Ladies home.</P>
<P>The next Day I began seriously to consider, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would be the Consequence of breaking my Affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the Elder, and making my Addresses to the
Younger; when upon mature Deliberation, it ap∣peared
to me so vile and scandalous an Action, af∣ter
such mutual and solemn Assurances of Fidelity
that fearing (as with just Reason I might) that
should not succeed in my Design upon <HI>Fanny,</HI>
fully resolved of the two Evils, to chuse the least
and therefore with great Difficulty and Violence to
myself, I broke off the Intimacy, and after, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
entirely regardless of that Love that at first I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
so warmly pursued.</P>
<P>Next Door to me, lived one Mr. <HI>Elias Brown
Peruke Maker,</HI> who had by his Marriage and Suc∣cess
in Trade, acquired a very handsome Fortune
This Man had one only Daughter ahout sixtee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Years of Age, a likely young Girl enough, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
well educated. Upon some trivial Difference tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
arose in my Father's Time, between him and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Brown,</HI> our Families were at Variancè with eac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
other; but upon my Father's Decease, all Con∣tention
and Animosity ceas'd so that from bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in a manner Strangers to one another, we in
short Time commenc'd an Intimacy and Friend¦ship:
By this means, I was admitted as a Membe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the weekly Club, held at the <HI>Golden-Lyon</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦vern
in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI> on <HI>Thursday.</HI> Moreover, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Custom was every <HI>Saturday</HI> to dine at the <HI>Castle</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>
<HI>Kingston upon Thames,</HI> where we usually drank
hard, and play'd high; and Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> finding
that notwithstanding my Youth, I was Master of
that valuable Art of Secrecy, placed an intire Con∣fidence
in me, and made me privy to all his In∣trigues
and lawless Pleasures. This Intimacy of
the Father's gave Birth to the Daughter's Love,
that afterwards proved both her Ruin and mine.
She took all Opportunities of being in my Com∣pany,
and frequently staid so late at my House,
without the Leave of her Father and Mother, that
in a little Time it became the publick Talk of the
Neighbours, and almost the whole Town; and as
Fame is generally attended with Falshood, some
there were that scrupled not to report, that I was
more familiar with her than was consistent with the
Modesty of her Sex; but this Accusation (I take
God to Witness) was utterly false, for upon my
hearing that her Character and Reputation was so
so grosly injured, and that those malicious Asper∣sions
arose from the innocent Pastimes with which
we amused ourselves together, I acquainted my
Neighbour <HI>Brown</HI> with what I heard was current∣ly
reported, concerning his Daughter and me, and
furthermore desired him, as he tendered the Wel∣fare
of his Child, to keep her away from my
House; he heartily thanked me for my good
Counsel, and accordingly removed her to her Cou∣sin
<HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s at Mile End, where she continued
near three Months, but not without sending me a
Letter or two, to let me know she should be very
glad to see me at the Place appointed in the
same.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60"/>
But I who had no Thoughts of making her my
Wife, out of Friendship to her Father, scorned to
take Advantage of her Youth, nor ever answered
her Billet-doux, or went according to her Request
to the Place of Assignation. In the mean Time,
my intimate and bosom Friend F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> pro∣posed
to take a House on <HI>Epping-forest,</HI> the Rent
of which he said was twenty-five Pounds per An∣num,
whereupon I promised to become his Tenant
for one Room, and moreover to send down some
Houshold Goods to furnish it withal. F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> laugh∣ing,
said, but are you willing to have Leases
drawn in your Name. for you know how my Af∣fairs
stand? Yes, Sir, quoth I, withal my Heart,
provided that you'll engage for the Payment of the
Rent. By all Means, quoth he. Thus we con∣cluded
upon the Hire of our Country Seat, and
over a merry Bottle christened it <HI>Langley Hall.</HI>
About a Week after, I sent down the Goods ac∣cording
to my Promise, and likewise for my Part
in the House-warming, a large Ham, and two
Gallons of Brandy. Soon after, my Friend F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>
and I, with some other merry Blades, went down
to our Country Seat, where we staid three or four
Days. On our Retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, an Accident happened to
me, that had like to have proved very fatal, but I
verified the old Saying, Nought is often in Danger,
but never hurt; for being three Parts mellow, and
mounted on a Golding of great Spirit and Cou∣rage,
by my frequent tickling him with the Spur,
he in Spite of all I could do, ran away with me
till I came to Hackney River, where to punish my
Courser for his Obstinacy, and cool his Courage, I
clapped Spurs to him, and plunged him into the
<PB N="61" REF="61"/>
River, down he fell, broke his Knees, and in the
Fall pitched me clear over his Ears, where for
some Time I could not recover myself; but by
good Fortune, at length I regained my Legs, and
kept puffing and blowing like a Porpice, till my
Companions came up, and seeing me in that pity∣ful
Condition, dispatched old <HI>Charon</HI> to take me
up, and waft me to the other Side of the Ferry,
whence like a drowned Rat I went dripping along,
stripped myself, and got half a Pint of Brandy
made hot, and went to bed, where I lay till my
Shirt and Clothes were dried by the Fire. In the
Evening I rose, and returned to <HI>London,</HI> and ad∣journed
to the old Place of Rendezvous, the Trum∣pet
Tavern, in <HI>Sheer Lane,</HI> where we passed the
Evening very merrily, but I resolved for the fu∣ture
never to be guilty of the like Frolick a∣gain.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> thinking that
Absence had sufficiently abated the Warmth of his
Daughter's Affections, sent for her home, and I
out of good Manners went to compliment Miss on
her Return; but alas, her Absence had only
served to smother the amorous Flame, which by
frequent Interviews soon burnt with fiercer Rage.
In fine, one Morning the old Gentlewoman sent
for me to Breakfast, and then proposed very advan∣tageous
Terms of Marriage with her Daughter,
and urged me to a Compliance with very great
Warmth and Zeal. Furthermore to corroborate
her Argument, down came▪ Miss <HI>Nancy,</HI> with her
Hair dishevel'd, her Eyes flowing with Tears, and
her Dress careless and negligent. See, says the
Mother, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> canting Tone, in what a Pickle poor
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
<HI>Nancy</HI> is, how can you be so cruel and hard-hearted,
as not to return her Love? Come, come,
Neighbour Langley, I'll engage you'll have no
Occasion to repent of your Bargain, Mr. <HI>Browne</HI>
and I shall never have any more Children, and
when we die, you'll come in for ALL. At the
Word ALL, which had a far greater Impression on
me than what she had said before, I pricked up my
Ears, and seemed to hearken to her with Pleasure,
and Nancy, who was before cruelly in the Dumps,
now began to revive, and put on the Air of Joy.
In short, I told Mrs. Brown, that since it was an
Affair of such great Consequence, I must desire a
Month's Time to consider of it, and that then I
would give her my final Answer. Upon this she
was well satisfied, and I took my Leave of them for
the present.</P>
<P>Now I began seriously to consider the State of my
Affairs, and finding by the private Accounts that I
kept in my Pocket Book, that the Payment of
those several large Sums borrowed on Jewels of a
considerable less Value, than what I had fraudu∣lently
pledged them for, was within three Months
of its Expiration: I thought my Circumstances in
a very melancholly Posture, and my Case almost
desperate, for if I should not redeem those Pledges
pursuant to Contract, my Credit and Reputation
would be entirely lost; and on the contrary, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Honour and Honesty should have the Ascendan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
over Fraud and Villainy, then I should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
great Sufferer thereby; wherefore I resolved, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
since I had begun to play the villainous Part, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
would at all Events complete it. Thus determined
there nothing now remained, but the Manner o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>
effectually executing what I so fully intended, and
was so stedfastly resolved upon. Marriage, I con∣sidered
with myself, would not only furnish me
with a pretty Sum of ready Cash, but would like∣wise
corroborate my Credit, and strengthen my In∣terest.
For as the greatest Villainies are carried on,
and supported by the specious Pretect of Sanctity
and Dissimulation, so I thought it was but a reason∣able
Supposition, that the Town now generally ac∣quainted
with my frequent Debauches, would upon
my Entrance into the Connubial State, judge me
thereby reclaimed, and become a sedate and sober
Man. For this Reason, sometime before and af∣ter
my Marriage, I gave due Attendance at the
Romish Chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and in a∣bout
three Weeks Time I invited Mrs. Brown and
her Daughter to Supper, I told her, that upon a
mature Deliberation of her Proposals, I was willing
to acquiesce and condescend thereunto, on the fol∣lowing
Terms, viz, That Mr. Brown should be at
the Expence of the Wedding-Clothes, and pay the
stipulated Sum on the Morning of the Wedding∣Day,
She readily agreed, and promised her Hus∣band's
punctual Compliance with my Demands.
Furthermore, as a Surety to bind the Bargain, I
gave the old Gentlewoman a Ring set with Rose
Diamonds in Form of a Coronet, Nanncy was now
all Life and Gaiety, and by her Parents Approba∣tion,
as well as mine, acted the Part of a Mistress
in my House, with the same Freedom and Autho∣rity
before, as she did after the Ceremony was per∣formed.
But alas, poor Girl, she little thought
how short her Reign would prove, and how the
Sunshine of her Glory would speedily be darkened
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
and eclipsed by black impending Clouds that
threatened sure, though not immediate Destruction
and endless Woe. But notwithstanding this En∣gagement
and solemn Contract with Nancy, I con∣tinued
my lawless Embraces with Clarinda, whom
I made my Counsellor and Confidant in the most
secret Transactions of my Life, and therefore al∣though
to satisfy my intended Spouse, and please
her Parents, I turned her away soon after Marriage,
yet I frequently kept Company with her after∣wards,
and made her several considerable Presents.
Mrs. Brown immediately purchased all Things
suitable for the Wedding, and also was so very in∣dulgent,
as to bring the several Patterns of Silks
and Laces designed for Nancy's Parapharnalia, to me
for my Approbation thereof. This Courtesy,
and the Richness of the Dress, so pleased me, that
I made her a Present of a Gold Watch and Chain,
and likewise a brilliant Diamond round-about Ring,
that she might appear in the Fashion of other mar∣ried
Ladies; and now the Licence being taken out,
and all Things ready for the Consummation of
our Nuptials, Mr. Brown desired me to six the
solemn Day, which he said he should chuse on that
of his Birth Day. But I declined so speedy an
Execution, on Account of a Tour I had promised
to take with some Friends, to a Gentleman's Seat
in Essex, and desired the Marriage might be de∣serred
for three Weeks longer, which Favour was
easily granted. And now all Things being agreed
on, I bethought myself of a Clergyman of my Ac∣quaintance,
a Gentleman void of a Living, and
reduced to a low State, greatly inferior to that of
his Profession. Nevertheless he was a boon Com∣panion,
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
told a merry Tale, and sung a Song with
a good Grace, and by his Industry made a Shift to
get a red Face in the Service of the Church; for
having given my Word to this Gentleman, that
he should be my sacred Magician, whensoever I
altered my Condition of Life, I thought myself in
Honour bound to perform my Promise therein. I
therefore sent for him to the Bull Head in Lin∣coln's-Inn-Fields,
where over a merry Bottle, I
acquainted the Doctor with my Intent, and en∣joyned
him to be ready on the Day appointed for
the Performance thereof. Having thus prepared
the Minister, I went down in the Country, and
after a sincere and hearty Welcome, returned to
London on the Evening before our appointed
Nuptials, when after having drank a Bottle or two
with the Inn-keeper, where my Horse stood at
Livery, I went to Mr. <HI>Browne's,</HI> who had pre∣pared
a handsome Supper for my Reception, where
none were present but Captain <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s</HI> Lady and
our Family. After Supper Mr. <HI>Browne</HI> asked me,
if I was provided with a Clergyman? Yes, Sir,
said I, and he will be punctual to his Appoint∣ment
at <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI> Chapel at Eight in the Morn∣ing;
well then, replied he, all's right, for I have
ordered a Coach and Four to be here at Seven, and
after the Ceremony we'll drive to <HI>Tim Harris's</HI> at
<HI>Egham.</HI> Agreed Sir, said I, so taking my Leave
went home, where, according to Custom, I lay
with <HI>Clarinda</HI> all Night. At Six in the Morning I
arose, and went to my Neighbour <HI>Browne's,</HI> where
they were all very busy in preparing the new
Bride; he called me aside, and asked me whether
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
I would have the Cash before or after Marriage.
Before, Sir, said I, by all Means; whereupon he
immediately complied with the Contract, by Notes
drawn on Sir <HI>Francis Child,</HI> and likewise gave me
the Writings of a House belonging to his Daugh∣ter,
in <HI>Charles Court</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and afterwards
taking a Bottle of Rum out of his Corner Cup∣board,
we drank all Health to each other. Now
the Bride being ready, we drove to the Chapel,
where my good Friend the Doctor was waiting, and
performed his Duty as a Gentleman worthy of his
Profession. From Chapel we drove to <HI>Egham,</HI>
where an elegant Dinner was provided at Mr.
<HI>Browne's</HI> Expence, and to use the Words of the
ingenious Mr. <HI>Phillips,</HI> 'Naught but Mirth and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Joy around the Table flow'd.' At Four we re∣turned
to Town, and I, regardless of my Spouse,
mounted the Coach-box, and drove to the Queen's
Head Tavern in Holborn, where <HI>Clarinda,</HI> by my
Direction, had ordered a sumptuous and elegant
Entertainment to be provided, at which Mr.
<HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n,</HI> Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d,</HI> jun. and his Spouse, the
Host and Hostess, were all present. About Eleven
we adjourned to my Father <HI>Browne's,</HI> where whilst
the Men drank a Bowl of Punch, the Women out
of their pious Care, dished out the Bride in Bed,
fit for the Reception of her Husband.</P>
<P>I must observe that we were married on a Thurs∣day,
and therefore I thought, if I could prevail
on my Wife (who was one of the Church of Eng∣land)
to accompany me to Mass on the Sunday fol∣lowing,
I should thereby gain the Applause and
Esteem of all those blinded Zealots. This I con∣fess
I did not attempt out of a religious Motive,
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
but from a Thought of private Gain, hoping by
this well feigned Hypocrisy, to insinuate myself
further into the good Graces and Esteem of the
most eminent and wealthy Followers of that Faith
and Profession. My Spouse to oblige me, yielded
to my Request, and her Condescention thereunto
had its desired Effect; for a Merchant in Basinghall-street
sent for me next Day, and commending the
meritorious Act of making a Convert, favoured
me with Nine hundred and Seventy-five Pounds
worth of Silver on my Note, payable in a Month's
Time. This was a great Encouragement to me,
and served further to facilitate my Design in run∣ning
away as much in Debt as possibly I could.
Wherefore I resolved to strike while the Iron was
hot, and make as much of my Credit as Time and
Occasion would permit. For the effectual Per∣formance
of which, I took up large Quantities of
Jewels of several Merchants, under Pretence of
disposing of them to several Ladies, whom I had
the Honour to serve, and in three or four Days,
artfully returned them again, telling the Owners,
that the Ladies were not as yet come to a full Re∣solution
for the Purchase of them. I likewise took
up a Repeating Watch of one Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI> in <HI>Fleet-street,</HI>
the outside Case whereof was set with large
Brilliants of the first Water, in Form of a Mari∣ner's
Compass; betwixt the Hours and Minutes
were interspersed some Brilliant Sparks, with Ru∣bies,
Topazes, and various precious Stones of dif∣ferent
Colours, resembling the <HI>Iris.</HI> The Rims of
the Case were also ornamented with costly Jewels,
imitating the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, and on
the Top of the Spring, that causes the Movement to
<PB N="68" REF="68"/>
strike, was set a large Brilliant of the first Water,
The Chain was three continued Rows of Diamonds,
and on the Top of the Hook was a very large oval
Brilliant. In short, it was the richest and most cu∣rious
Performance of that Nature, that had been
seen in <HI>Europe</HI> at that Time.</P>
<P>This Watch I pretended was designed for the
Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> and having the Honour to shew
it to several Noblemen and Ladies of the highest
Rank, I could have disposed of it to them; how∣ever,
I thought it would turn more to my Advan∣tage
to refuse the Sale thereof, for this Reason, viz.
if I sold it in <HI>England,</HI> the Owner would have ex∣pected
the Payment thereof in a short Time, and
on the contrary, it was not reasonable to think that
he would refuse to wait for the Return of foreign
Bills, if it was supposed to be sent to her <HI>Catho∣lick</HI>
Majesty. And now the Time drawing on for
the Execution of my full Purport, I made it my
Business to frequent Slaughter's Coffee House in
St. <HI>Martin's Lane,</HI> where I soon got acquainted
with a Set of Foreigners, of whom I enquired into
the Laws and Customs of those Countries relating
to broken Tradesmen, that fled thither for Refuge
and Safety, and being assured by them that <HI>Holland</HI>
was the safest Azylum to skreen Villanies of that
Nature, I resolved to steer my Course thither, and
therefore went to <HI>Bland</HI>'s on Tower Hill, to en∣quire
for a Vessel that would be ready to sail in a∣bout
a Fortnight's Time. Upon Enquiry, I met
with one <HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s J<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI> Commander of the <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI>
Sloop, a Gentleman observant of his Word, if the
Wind and Weather permitted; with this Captain I
agreed for the Passage of two Persons, to have the
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
Conveniency of his State Room and great Cabbin,
and gave him a Guinea Earnest. The next Thing
I did was to get a Bill of Exchange for five hun∣dred
Pounds, in the Name of <HI>Robert Clinton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
payable to nim or Order, which being easily ob∣tained,
I then applied myself to the above-menti∣oned
Merchants for their Jewels, pretending that
the Ladies were now come to a final Resolution,
and would purchase them; and now the Prices be∣ing
agreed on, I gave them my promissary Note,
three Months after Date for the same. All Things
being thus carried on with the utmost Secrecy, I
appointed <HI>Clarinda,</HI> whom I still kept Company, to
be at the Prince William's Head at <HI>Charing. Cross.</HI>
She was punctual to my Assignation, and there af∣ter
mutual Assurances of constant Love and invi∣olable
Friendship, I acquainted her with my secret
Design, and insisted on her accompanying me in
my Voyage thither, and that upon her Condescen∣sion
thereunto, she should be an equal Co-partner
and Sharer of my large Fortune, which in all hu∣man
Probability, was sufficient for our Mainte∣nance,
in a polite and genteel Way, during the
Term of our Lives. But she, like a generous
Girl, declined my base Proposals, and in her De∣fence,
urged my being already married to a very
deserving young Lady, whom in Honour I could
not leave, and that if she consented to my Proffer,
she should thereby deservedly incur the Scandal of
the most vile and abandoned Adultress. In fine,
all the Arguments I could use were fruitless. So
having engaged her religiously to keep my im∣portant
Secret, I took my Farewel of her; and then
resolved, that since I could not obtain her consent,
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
that I would take my Wife over with me, which
confess I did not so much out of pure Love, a
out of a View of Interest, hoping, that if I should
be frustrated in my Design, that her Father, out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Love and Regard to her, would look with a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vourable
Eye on me, and impute my Misfor¦tunes,
or rather ill Management, to the Folly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Youth.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as soon as I came home, I proposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
my wife a country journey on the sunday following
and ordered her to get ready, and pack up all he
clothes, my intent being to stay there for three week
or a month. In the mean time I hired a chaise an
four for two days, to be ready at the time appointed
and to prevent my being seen, or taken notice of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
passing through the city, I ordered the chaise to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for me on St. Margaret's-hill, Southwark. I the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sealed up my jewels, bank notes, and the above-men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tioned
watch, with bills of exchange, amounting i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all to the Value of nineteen thousand or twenty thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sand
pounds, in a little trunk, and meeting the cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain
at Bland's, pursuant to his Appointment, on Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>day
at four in the afternoon, I gave the trunk in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his custody, with a particular charge to lock it up i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his bureau, and took a receipt for the same; bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
well assured by him that he would sail from Gravesen
on the monday following. In the evening I went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
my father Brown's, and acquainted him with my pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tended
journey into the country, with which he seeme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
well pleased, it being the long vacation time. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
morning I gave my journeyman charge of the shop, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
left all my plate standing therein, least the remove
thereof should cause a suspicion amongst my creditor
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
and intercept my intended flight. I likewise ordered
him to pay all such trivial sums as were owing to my
workmen.</P>
<P>And now my spouse and I having taken leave of
our parents, called a coach, and drove to the above-mentioned
place, where the chaise and four were wait∣ing
according to my order. Then discharging the
coach, we went into the King's Arms, and break∣fasted.
From thence we went to Gravesend, and put
up at the Faulcon, where I paid two guineas and an
half for the discharge of the chaise according to agree∣ment.</P>
<P>On Sunday we dined with the captain, and other
gentlemen and ladies that were going passengers with
us. On monday morning the captain, according to
his promise heaved up his anchor with the wind S. W.
All the passengers with my spouse went on board, but
I staid ashore till the captain went off, which was
nigh an hour after, and now the ship being adrift, lay
to for his coming on board. In the mean time as I was
drinking with my landlord in his back yard fronting the
water, I espied a one eye game cock, which I pur∣chased
for half a crown, for a venture in Holland.
Now the captain having completed all his business a∣shore,
hurried me and my new purchase on board, we
then braced about, filled our held sails, and spread all
the canvass we could to the welcome gale, that fresh∣ing
on us, wafted our ship the next day to the Bombkays
at Rotterdam, where we went ashore, and by the
commander's recommendation lodged at the sign of the
Koning Van England, (or King of England's Head)
kept by one John Gadbury, on the Vine Haven.</P>
<P>The next day captain J<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> came to dinner with
us, and acquited his charge honourably. Thus all
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
things seemed to favour my undertaking, and I being
of a vain and aspiring temper, resolved to pass for the
younger son of my lord F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, and to the end that
I might make an appearance suitable to the dignity
that I had falsely assumed, I ordered a Taylor to make
me a rich suit of clothes; and as it happened, one Mr.
Loven, a decayed gentleman,, quartered at the same
inn with me, who speaking the Dutch and French lan∣guages
to perfection, with him I contracted to be my
gentleman and interpreter, and to do him justice, he
faithfully executed the trust I reposed in him. This
gentleman I ordered to hire three French footmen, and
cloth them with the utmost expedition, with my li∣very,
which was blue cloth turned up with red, scar∣let
waistcoats and breeches trimmed with silver, and
broad gold lac'd hats. As to the coach, Mr. Laven
informed me, that it was customary in Holland for
all persons of quality, except foreign ministers, to hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their equipages, as they had occasion for them, there
being many grand and stately ones kept for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Having thus settled my equipage and servants af∣ter
the nicest and richest fancy, I resolved to devote
myself to pleasure for some time; although in the in∣terim
I privately enquired for a gentleman of worth
and integrity, to whom I might with safety commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the trust of my effects, that if peradventure, my cre∣ditors
should come over in quest of me, that they no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
finding any thing valuable in my possession, might no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
think it worth their while to give themselves any
further trouble about me, but rest contented with
those effects I had left in England.</P>
<P><HI>Now I must observe, that upon my return to my
quarters, I frequently found the above-mentioned</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="73"/>
Captain in Company with my Spouse; how∣ever,
I took no Notice thereof, but on the contrary
always entertained him with the utmost Courtesy
and good Manners; but one Night, as we were in
Bed, I asked her the Meaning of the Captain's fre∣quent
Visits, and whether he endeavoured to shew
a more than lawful Love and Respect for her.
Hereupon she frankly told me, that she believed
it was the Captain's Design to betray her Virtue,
for that he often expressed how passionately he
loved her; that therefore she had used all possible
Means to avoid his Company, but found it a very
difficult Matter, which gave her cause to suspect,
that he had bribed the Landlady to acquiesce in the
Pursuit of his Amours, wherefore she earnestly
requested me to provide fresh Lodgings, where she
might be more retired, and shun the vile Imperti∣nence
of the said Commander: Well pleased with
this open and generous Confession, I highly com∣mended
her Honour and Integrity, but desired that
she would not offer the least Affront to the Cap∣tain.
I artfuly said, until I could be further in∣formed
of the Punishments inflicted on Persons
in Adultery, by the severe Laws of the United
Provinces, Upon consulting with my Gentleman,
who was well versed in Statutes of that Republick,
I found that the Penalty on such henious Crimes,
was immediate Forfeiture of all the Delinquent's
Effects, and close Imprisonment during Life, as a
Satisfaction or Atonement to the injured Party, for
the Dishonour.</P>
<P>One Day, hearing that there was to be a Cock-fight,
I ordered one of my Servants to prepare
<PB N="82" REF="74"/>
mine, who had been for some Time in keeping, to
enter the Lists, and by my Spouse's earnest En∣treaty,
I took her (though contrary to the usual
Custom of the Ladies) with me, to see the Pa∣stime.
In short I backed my Cock against the
Opposers, and he, by good Fortune, at one chance
Blow killed his Antagonist, by whose unexpected
Death I was a Gainer of about ten Pounds. Highly
pleased with my Success I returned home, and it
being Summer Time we seated ourselves under a
shady Tree, that fronted the Inn Door, and called
for a Bottle of Claret, but had not been there long,
before the Captain came and joined us, and being
informed of my good Fortune, wished me Joy. I
returned the Compliment, and <HI>Nancy</HI> with an Air
of Gaiety, desired that I would favour her with the
Winnings for the Purchase of some <HI>Dutch</HI> Toys; I
replied, With all my Heart, my Dear, for this and
all that I have is at your Service, and thereupon
immediately flung the Money into her Lap. Soon
after this, I saw her Countenance change, and ask'd
her what was the Matter? but she made me no
Answer, whereupon Madam, said I, what are you
dumb? This rash and hasty Expression so nettled
her, that she threw the Money into the Street,
which I knowing the Value of better than she, ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and picked it up, swearing, that since she had
abused my Generosity, I would give her sufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Reason to repent it; but my Passion was over, and
by Mr. <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s Mediation, I promised to forgive
and forget that silly Flight of Youth.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Captain proposed a Tour to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Hague,</HI> which was with Pleasure agreed to, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
next Morning set out for that agreeable Rendez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vous
<PB N="83" REF="75"/>
of Nobility, where we dined in a sumptuous
and elegant Manner, at the Sign of the <HI>English
Parliament,</HI> a celebrated House for polite Entertain∣ment.
From whence we returned to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI>
where I entertained the Captain and some of the
other Gentlemen with a grand Entertainment;
when the Company was gone, I used all possible
Arguments to perswade <HI>Nancy</HI> to yield a seeming
compliance to the Captain's lawless Desires, and to
appoint him pursuant to my Direction, a Place
proper for the Execution of his villainous Design.
Furthermore, I urged the great Advantage accru∣ing
from thence, and the diligent care and caution
I would take to surprize him, blasted in the fruit∣less
Expectations of satiating his luxuriant and adul∣terous
Passion. But notwithstanding all my Argu∣ments,
<HI>Nancy</HI> remained inflexible, and could not
be induced to acquiesce to this treacherous Propo∣sal,
and in her Defence urged, that no Lucre or
sordid Gain (though ever so great) could expiate or
atone for that Dishonour and Loss of Character,
that she must inevitably sustain, by condescending
to so infamous an Act; wherefore I thought pro∣per
to drop an Argument so displeasing and un∣grateful
to her, and to proceed to an Affair far
more weighty and important, viz. the Security of
my Person and Effects.</P>
<P>For the effectual Performance of which, being
recommended to Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, a Man of Worth
and experienced Fidelity, that kept a large Ware∣house
on the <HI>Bombkays,</HI> to him I committed the
Charge of my Cash and Jewels; and now finding
by his Discourse, that he was well versed in the
Laws of that Republick, and more particular in
<PB N="84" REF="76"/>
those relating to broken Tradesmen that took
Sanctuary in those Parts, him I judged to be the
properest Person to consult and communicate with
about my own Affairs. Nevertheless I was not so rash
as to let him into the Secret of my Circum∣stances
at the first Interview, but taking a Note of
him for the Re-delivery of my Cash and Effects on
demand, I parted with him for the present, and
as soon as I came home, enquired more strictly of
my Landlord, into his Character and Repute. Mr.
<HI>Gadbury,</HI> my Host, scrupled not to expatiate
largely on his undoubted Veracity, and unbiassed
Fidelity to his Trust, and at the same Time nomi∣nated
several Gentlemen, whose Affairs were then
in a melancholly and dangerous Posture, that by
his Prudence and Sagacity, had been re-instated in
their pristine Glory.</P>
<P>These Words uttered with so much Warmth and
Ardour, easily induced me to a Belief, that Mr.
<HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> was in Reality deserving of so great a Cha∣racter,
and therefore I engaged him to dine with
me the next Day at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and without Re∣serve
I unbosomed myself to him in a frank and
friendly Manner. Hereupon he promised to be
steadfast, and true to my Interest, and advised me
immediately to procure a Protection from the
States General, which he assured me, would totally
exempt me from the Jurisdiction of any other Fo∣reign
Laws; and as a farther Proof of his Since∣rity,
he promised by the Assistance of a Lawyer,
(his particular Friend) to obtain what he so hear∣tily
wished, as well for my Security as his own Sa∣tisfaction,
that I were now in Possession of. More∣over
added he, it must be done with the utmost
<PB N="85" REF="77"/>
Expedition, least peradventure, your Creditors be∣ing
apprized of your Intent, should by their un∣wearied
Diligence, and extensive Interest, under∣mine
your Undertakings; wherefore you must
not regard the Expence, for Favours of that Na∣ture
are not to be obtained but by a well timed
Liberalty, and some Presents suitable to the Per∣sons
concerned in the Management of so great and
important an Affair; your Protection (which I
doubt not you will obtain) stands for six Months,
both for your Person and Effects, and at the Expi∣ration
of the limitted Time, it is easily renewed for
a trival Cost.</P>
<P>Charmed with his Discourse, that inspired me
with new Life and Vigour, and banished the gloo∣my
Thoughts of Fear, or approaching Danger, I
pressed him to a speedy Execution of his Promise,
and gave him a full Commission to disburse what∣ever
he thought proper on that Occasion; and as∣sured
him, I'd satisfy him and his Friend for their
Trouble, and ever after gratefully acknowledged
the Favour. In the Evening we returned to <HI>Rot∣terdam</HI>
where we supp'd together, and Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>
with repeated Assurances of his Sincerity, and ut∣most
Endeavours to assist me in all my Designs de∣parted.</P>
<P>Four Days after this Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> and his
Friend the Lawyer came to my Lodgings, from
whence we went to <HI>Michael Edward's,</HI> at the Sun
on the <HI>Bombkays,</HI> and there the Lawyer with an
Air of Gaiety said, Sir, I wish you Joy, of what
replied I? Of your so much desired Protection,
Sir, which I here present you with. By this ex∣traordinary
Dispatch, you may see how unwearied
<PB N="86" REF="78"/>
our Endeavours have been to serve you; the States
are not now sitting, but this I have by great
Interest obtained of their Secretary for the Space of
twelve Days, at the Expiration whereof their High
Mightinesses will assemble, and grant you a fur∣ther
Protection for six Months longer. I humbly
thanked him for this so singular a Mark of his
Esteem and Friendship, and ordered Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>
to pay the Gentleman one hundred Guineas for his
Trouble.</P>
<P>I now rambled up and down without Fear or
Apprehension of any Molestation that could arise
from any Quarter, and Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> and I contrac∣ted
a Partnership in Merchandize on the following
Terms and Conditions, viz. that I should lend the
said <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> 5000 l. 'at common Interest, and
thereupon add 5000 l. more to make up a joint
Stock of 10,000 l. from which large Sum, with
good Success, we promised ourselves to raise a
fair Fortune. Wherefore that we might imme∣diately
proceed to Business, we went to Amster∣dam
to purchase a Ship, and there upon Enquiry
we found, that the Prince William Snow, Captain
B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> was lying there for Sale, upon which we
sent for the Commander, went on Board with him▪
examin'd into the Vessel, and purchased her fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
450 l. Sterling, which Money I paid on my own
Account, being desirous to become the sole Pro∣prietor
thereof. In the Interim I received Advice
that four of my principal Creditors were came ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in Quest of me, and that they by great interest
had engaged the Earl of Chesterfield then Am¦bassador
at the Hague) to prevent my promised
Protection, and upon the Expiration of that which
<PB N="87" REF="79"/>
I had, to obtain a Grant from their High Mighti∣nesses
to seize my Person and Effects. This News
I confess, struct me with Horror and Confusion,
and judging that if I returned to Rotterdam, I
should inevitably fall into their Hands, I resolved
to lie perdue at the House of Mr. <HI>A<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> at the
<HI>Hague,</HI> and there wait the Issue of their Proceedings,
and in the mean Time, to dispatch Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to try
if possible, to subvert my Enemies Designs, by
large Sums of persuasive Gold. I now laid aside
my Equipage, and the grand Title of my Lord,
passed for a private Gentleman, by the Name of
Robert Clifton, and continued at the above-men∣tion'd
House nigh upon a Week, without ever
going out of my Chamber. When one Morning
my Landlord, who was privy to the Affair, came
into my Room, and trembling, gave me a Letter
from Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> which inform'd me, that the
Creditors having Intelligence where I lay, were on
the Road to surround the House, and take me
Prisoner; that he used all possible Means to renew
my Protection, but that all his Efforts therein was
vain and fruitless; that there had been publish'd a
Reward of 400 <HI>l.</HI> for securing my Person, and
likewise 400 <HI>l.</HI> more for the Discovery of my Ef∣fects;
that my Taylor had given a Description of
the Cloaths that he had made, and moreover that
my Picture was set up at the <HI>Change,</HI> and the most
publick Places of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam</HI>; that
the best Advice he was capable to give me at pre∣sent
was, to exchange my Apparel, disguise myself,
and make into the adjacent Wood, and there wait
for his coming, which should be punctually at four
in the Afternoon.

Scarce had I read the Letter, before I was alarm'd
with a confused Noise in the Street; whereupon my
Landlord looking out of the Window, cry'd
Zounds▪ Sir, you are taken, my House is now sur∣rounded.
Be calm, Sir, said I, and send up one
of your <HI>Dutch</HI> Servants to me, I'll change Habits
with him; also let me have a lighted Candle and a
Cork immediately. The Landlord obey'd my
Orders, I stript, put on <HI>Mynheer</HI>'s Habit, black'd
my Eye-brows, and passed out at the back Door,
unobserved by any; from thence I went into the
Weod, where I lay hid until the Time appointed,
when Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> came, highly overjoyed to find
me escaped from the Fury of my Adversaries.
Come, Sir, said he, you must now personate the
<HI>Dutchman,</HI> and we will go to <HI>Vienna,</HI> a protected
Place, of ten miles in Circumference, where I will
obtain for you the Governor's Protection, and there
you may live secure and free from all Molestations
and Arrests. This Scheme was no sooner proposed
than with Pleasure agreed to, so from the Wood
we went into the next Town, and there hired a
Phaeton or Chaise for <HI>Vienna.</HI> In the Evening we
arrived there, and the next Morning waited on the
Governor, of whom for 50 Guineas I received the
Favour of a Protection, with a strict Charge and
Caution not to exceed the Bounds of his Minute
Territories.</P>
<P>The next Day Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> took his Leave of
me with repeated Assurances of Frienship, and a
solemn Promise not to discover my Effects. Here
I enjoy'd all Pleasures, that a Place inhabited by
unfortunate Persons cou'd afford, this being
but a living Goal in Epitome. However, hav∣ing
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
a sufficiency of Cash, the Honour and Re∣spect
I met with there, in some Measure alleviated
the Hardship of my Confinement. Here I be∣came
acquainted with two Irish young Fellows, of
daring and bold Dispositions, who had here taken
Refuge and Sanctuary for Murder, no Crime be∣ing
reckon'd sufficiently black or infamous, to ex∣clude
the vile Offenders from the Graces and Pro∣tection
of his Tartarean Excellency. These two
Rus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians for want of better Society, I daily admit∣ted
to my Table, and on all Occasions bore their
Expences, and they, as the only Satisfaction that
they could make, faithfully promised at the Ha∣zard
of their Lives, to secure me from all Insults
and Dangers.</P>
<P>Hither came Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> pursuant to his Pro∣mise,
Weekly, and supplied me with what Cash I
demanded, and assured me, that my Creditors be∣gan
to be out of all Hopes, and that if I patiently
submitted to my Confinement for a short Time,
that they would soon be wearied out, with the
large and extravagant Charges they were at, in
their vain Search and fruitless Pursuit. Whereup∣on
I charged him to make my Wife as easy as he
possibly could, and let her know, that as soon as
the Storm was over, I would pay her a Visit▪ but
at the same Time, cautioned him not to let her
into the Secret of my Abode, least peradventure,
thro' the Folly and indiscretion of Youth, she
should inadvertently blab it out. <HI>Nancy,</HI> I must
observe to you, had near upon four hundred
Pounds by her, besides her Jewels, Gold Watch,
and Snuff Box, so that I knew she could not be in
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
any Want, and therefore made myself easy on that
Head.</P>
<P>During my Stay here, I was taken violently ill,
which prevented my intended Journey to his <HI>Prus∣sian</HI>
Majesty's Dominions, whither I had designed
to go, and by presenting my so-much▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amed and
celebrated Watch to his then favourite Lady, flat∣tered
myself with the Hopes of obtaining a Com∣mission
in that great Monarch's Service. Dr.
W<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> was my Physician, who lived contiguous
to the House where I lodged, and three Times a
Day visited me, lying in a dangerous Condition in
my Bed, not able to move either Hand or Foot,
but racked with tormenting Pains both Night and
Day. My faithful <HI>Irishmen</HI> constantly attended
me, and for my Security brought Fire Arms into
my Room, least the Governor being influenced by
a larger Sum, or sollicited by their High Mighti∣nesses,
should cancel or supercede my Protection,
and thereby expose me to the free Arrest and Fu∣ry
of my Adversaries.</P>
<P>One Night as I lay in my Bed, two of my Cre∣ditors
came and surprized me in my Room, and
insisted on my going with them immediately▪ pro∣ducing
the Governor's Order to compel me to ac∣quiesce
to their Demands; but I excused myself
on Account of my Illness for that Night, and pro∣mised
to be ready in the Morning, to comply with
their Request. Nevertheless this Answer, was not
Satisfactory, for they insisted on lying in the same
Room with me, as a Guard to my Person. Here
upon my Comrades armed themselves with a Brac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Pistols each, and presenting, swore, that if the
Gentlemen did not immediately depart, that they
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
would severely punish their Rashness and Insolence,
for they insisted on that Room being their Pro∣perty;
and that I was only there on Sufference.
Hereupon the Creditors withdrew, but placed a
Guard round the House, swearing that they would
hurry me away with them very early in the Mor∣ning.</P>
<P>Now the Fright I was in dispelled all my Pain,
and I, who before could not move myself in my
Bed, now put on my Cloaths, and walked hastily
up and down the Room, ruminating what Course
to take to extricate myself from this Emergency.
At last I sent for the Doctor, who had already heard
of the Affair, and with him I agreed, that if he
would leave open his back Door, between the
Hours of Twelve and One, I would make my
Escape, and take Shelter in his House.</P>
<P>To this Purpose he readily consented, and pro∣mised
to be punctual in the Execution of his
Trust. Whereupon my Companions and I called
for Liquor plentifully, and I seemed to be no ways
concerned at the Danger I was in,</P>
<P>Now the Time of my intended Flight drawing
nigh; we called for a large Bowl of Arrack Punch,
which whilst the Landlady, (the sole Person then
stirring in the House) was making, I by the Fa∣vour
and Obscurity of the Night, escaped out at
the back Door, and slipped unseen into the Doc∣tor's
House, where I lay concealed for nine or ten
Days, leaving my Pursuers to curse their unhappy
Stars, and commence a fresh Hunt after their flown
Game,</P>
<P>At length, growing weary of this intolerable con∣finement,
I resolved to venture abroad in disguise, and
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
therefore borrowed a suit of woman's apparel of the
Doctor's spouse, in return for which I gave her a di∣amond
girdle Buckle. The dress I had was <HI>French,</HI>
and therefore I was now obliged to play the part of
<HI>Madam de Paris,</HI> and for two or three days behav'd
very modestly among the ladies, being instructed in my
female discipline by the Doctor's spouse. At last I set
out for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> having a gentleman of the Doc∣tor's
recommendation to personate my Husband; as
soon as I arrived there, I wrote to Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, de∣siring
him to remit me 200 Guineas, but he never
complied with my demand.</P>
<P>Three days afterwards I received a letter from an
uuknown hand, assuring me that my Partner H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> had
proved false, and betray'd his Trust to me; for
that he had actually agreed to deliver up all my ef∣fects,
on promise of the above-mentioned reward;
that therefore the only expedient I had left to prevent
his villainous design was, a voluntary surrender of
myself. Whereupon, as the old saying is, Needs must
when the devil drives, I determined to make the best
of my way to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where I heard that my
creditors were assembled at Mr. E<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, at the
Sun on the <HI>Vine-Haven,</HI> and by a voluntary submis∣sion
to their mercy and clemency, to appease their just
indignation, and thereby obtain that Reward that my
partner had by so infamous and treacherous a plot, en∣deavoured
to gain.</P>
<P>The design happily had its desired Effect, for upon
my free surrender, the creditors not only used me in a
generous and gentleman-like manner, but sent for Mr.
<HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> and absolutely demanded all those effects
that▪ I had lodged in his hands, threat'ning upon re∣fusal
thereof, to seize them by authority. In short▪
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
he was obliged to comply, and produced all that eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I had committed to his trust, and at the same time
brought in a charge against me for cash drawn out of
his hands, as likewise his bill for attendance and ser∣vices
done for me, whilst under my Misfortunes. The
gentlemen, as well as I, were greatly amazed at his
exorbitant demands, which were upwards of 700 l.
but nevertheless, to avoid further trouble and ex∣pences,
they were advised to acquiesce to his exactions;
the laws of the united provinces being strictly severe
in compelling all persons to satisfy the parties by them
employed, to the utmost of their demands, tho' never
so immoderate. And now as a gratuity, the credi∣tors
gave me the sum of 200 <HI>l.</HI> enjoining me to be
ready to sail with them for <HI>England</HI> on the first op∣portunity.</P>
<P>Matters being thus accommodated, I went to my
old landlord's at the King's Head, but to my surprize,
sound that my wife was gone from thence, at the in∣stigation
of the above-mentioned <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> who
had basely persuaded her to make a tour to <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he said I was settled. Upon a
further enquiry about her effects, the landlord told
me, that she had honourably discharged the house,
and took her trunk along with her. However, I
made myself as easy as possible, under my unfortunate
circumstances, but vowed to revenge myself on <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI>
for the injury and injustice he had done me; and there∣fore,
I privately bought a pair of pocket pistols, load∣ed
them, and then went to his house to drink a glass
with him, under pretence of accommodating our dif∣ferences,
tho' my full and real intent was to have
shot him, as an example to deter others from violating
the sacred ties of friendship, by the horrid and scanda∣lous
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
breach of trust. But he (unable to bear the
reproaches of the populace) was gone, and so preserv'd
his own life, as well as mine, which would have been
inevitably forfeited to the just laws of the Republic,
severely rigid against homicide.</P>
<P>Soon after this, my creditors and I returned for
<HI>England.</HI> On our arrival at <HI>London,</HI> we went to
Mr. <HI>Barnes</HI>'s, a goldsmith on <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> and one
of my principal creditors, who was generonsly pleased
to treat me better than I deserved; at this gentle∣man's
house I lay all night, and the next morning was
carried to the Crown and Rolls Tavern in <HI>Chancery
Lane,</HI> where the Commissioners of the Bankruptcy
were assembled; here to my surprize, I met with my
wife and mother-in-law, both dressed in mourning, for
the death of their relation capt. <HI>Holden</HI>; when after
a civil salute, the old gentlewoman said, <HI>Ah! Mr.</HI>
Langley, <HI>this Dress well becomes our present Cir∣cumstances,
for we are all ruin'd by your Folly.
Mr.</HI> Brown <HI>raves like a Madam, and will by no
Means be pacified, and</HI> Nancy's Dutch <HI>Landlord
has ran away with all her Cash, Cloaths, and Jew∣els,
whilst she was in Quest of you.</HI> Our further
discourse was interrupted by an order from the commis∣sioners
for me to attend them immediately; where af∣ter
a long and strict examination passed, to the con∣tent
of all parties, I was discharged, upon promise
of giving due attendance to the attorney for the com∣mission,
and one of the assignees for my encouragement
thereunto, gave me five guineas in hand. After this,
I took an apartment for myself and wife, in <HI>Devercux
Court,</HI> near <HI>Temple Bar,</HI> and daily wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted on the
assignees and their attorney, for the execution of the
then dependant business, viz. to settle my affairs, and
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
cell in my debts, which were large, there being up∣wards
of eighteen hundred pounds in the book, and my
plate and houshold furniture was sold for upwards of
twelve hundred pounds more. But amongst all my
misfortunes, none so much grieved me as to see my cu∣rious
library of books, that with pains I purchased
for two hundred and fifty pounds, disposed of for
the trivial sum of thirty pounds. And now my wife
being taken very ill, was removed to her mother's,
to be attended with all necessary care for a sick person;
whereupon finding 5 s. per week too much for my fallen
circumstances, to pay for a room barely to sleep in, I
discharged the same, and took another at 1 s. 6 d. per
week in <HI>Hemlock Court.</HI></P>
<P>During the indisposition of my spouse, I was not
permitted to see her, being strictly forbid the house by
her father. Wherefore having now settled the book
debts, and given an account of the respective abodes of
the different creditors, I resolved to seek my fortune
abroad, hoping that upon my return, I should find my
affairs happily concluded, and myself thereby master of
a great sum arising from the Statute. Mrs. <HI>Brown</HI>
used her utmost endeavours to dissuade me from my pur∣pose;
but I remained inflexible, and deaf to all her
earnest entreaties, and therefore mustering up the sum
of thirty Guineas, I went to the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Coffee∣house,
where I agreed with captain <HI>Joseph Richard∣son,</HI>
commander of the <HI>Frere</HI> Galley, bound for the a∣bove-mentioned
island, for my passage thither. Upon
the captain's telling me that he should be ready to sail
in a fortnight, I prepared myself pursuant to his di∣rections;
and having packed up my cloaths and linnen,
I took a final leave of my firiends, and went down to
<HI>Blackwall,</HI> where the Ship then lay, having given a
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
letter of attorney to my good friend Mr. <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> to
act for me in my absence.</P>
<P>Whilst the Vessel staid at <HI>Blackwall,</HI> I quartere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at the <HI>White-Horse,</HI> and being now metamorphose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into a kind of Sea Officer, with my laced Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and speckled Shirt, I passed upon some for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mate of a Ship. I cannot forget, that being ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cidentally
in Company with a Barber, the credu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lous

all the Wigs in his Shop on the same Condi∣tion.</P>
<P>I now went by the Name of <HI>James Englefield</HI>
and having purchased 20 Gallons of Alderma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Parsons</HI>'s Beer, four Dozen of Wine, 100 Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mons,
and a Loaf of Sugar, I went on Board, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fell down to <HI>Graves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd.</HI> The next Day, the Cap∣tain
and the rest of the Passengers arriv'd there
from whence we sailed with a fair Wind at N. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into the <HI>Downs,</HI> where the Winds hanging to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

one Day (to my sorrow I speak it) some of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
destitute of either Money or Friends; however, I
amused myself with settling the Accounts of one
Mr. <HI>Morgan,</HI> a yearly Trader to those Parts, and
knowing no other Antidote to my present Afflicti∣ons
but Patience, I determined to bear up against
the Torrent of Adversity, with a chearful Alcrity,
and pleasing Hopes of some unectxpeed Turn of
Fortune.</P>
<P>On <HI>Christmas</HI> Day we went ashore, and the
Ship's Doctor invited me to Dinner with him at a
Friend's House, for every one by my Apparel,
judged me to be a young Gentleman of Fortune.
In the Evening I went to Mrs. <HI>Carmichael's,</HI> the
best Tavern in <HI>Charles Town,</HI> where I quartered for
a considerable Time; my good Friend Mr. <HI>Mor∣gan</HI>
having given me a fair Character to my Land∣lady,
and also presented me with two Moidores,
for the Service I had done him, in settling his
Accounts; but this ready Cash was soon expend∣ed,
and I considerably indebted to my kind Ho∣stess,
which threw me in so a great Dilemma how
to manage my Affairs, that I could neither rest
Night nor Day; full well I knew that I could not
get off from the Island without giving public No∣tice
thereof for one and twenty Days. Neverthe∣less,
as I had artfully lodged my Chest and Appa∣rel
at a little Tavern adjoining to the Water-side, I
waited in Hopes of some favourable Opportunity
of bilking my Landlady. Accordingly, some
Time afterwards his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Gosport,</HI> ar∣rived
in the Bay, and by good Fortune, some of
the young Officers came to Dinner at my Quar∣ters,
where in the Afternoon, over a merry Bottle,
one of the Gentlemen asked me, if I was not a
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
Commander, of some Vessel, for so he judged me
to be my Apparel, which was Scarlet trimm'd with
Silver. Sir, said I, my Appearance, I confess,
may speak me to be such as you please to imagine,
but to tell you the real Truth, I am the most un∣fortunate
young Fellow alive, for here I am in∣volv'd
in Debt, which I am unable to discharge,
neither know I how to escape from this accursed
Island. Sir, replied he briskly, If that be all your
Grievance, I'll put you in a Way to redress it im∣mediately;
our Captain is an honourable and good-natured
Gentleman, and therefore, if you apply to
him for your Passage, to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> I doubt not but
that he will easily grant your Request; he comes
ashore every Morning about Nine, and your best
Way is, to address yourself to him on his Land∣ing,
before he is engaged in other Company; in
the mean Time, be cautious how you let any one
into the Secret, and you need not fear Success
therein. In fine, I heartily thanked him for his
wholesome and highly agreeable Advice, and the
next Morning met the Commander, to whom I
freely without Reserve, made known the State of
my Affairs, and he as generously was pleased to
promise me my Passage on Board the Ship, and at
the same Time, as a Signal, ordered me, when I
saw his Maintop sail Sheets hauld home, to come
on Board, and he would receive me into his Care
and Protection.</P>
<P>Highly pleased with this unexpected Courtesy
from a Stranger, I was not failing in an humble
and grateful Acknowledgement of so singular a
Favour, and elate with Joy, returned to my Quar∣ters.
Now my sole Business was to keep a sharp
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
look-out for my so much desired Signal; which
on the fourth Day I espied, to my great Joy and
Comfort; whereupon, I directly took a Canoe,
put my Chest therein, and went on Board. Captain
<HI>Richardson</HI> seeing me go on board the Man of
War, imagined how Affairs went, and sent his
Mate to me, with three Guineas, for the Whig
which I had had of my aforesaid Friend the Barber
at <HI>Blackwall.</HI> From <HI>Barbadoes</HI> we sailed to <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI>
and during the Passage, I had the Honour
to Mess with the Lieutenats, who seemed well
pleased at the merry Recital of my various Adven∣tures.
I leave my Readers to judge of the Confu∣sion
that my Landlady was in, at the News of my
sudden Departure, and now proceed to the Relation
of what happened to me in the above-mentioned
Island of <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>I lodged at Mr. <HI>Wade's</HI> at <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and by
my coming there in the Man of War, passed cur∣rently
for one of the Midshipmen. Here in a short
Time I expended my small Stock, but was happily
prevented from running in Debt, by an unexpected
Accident. For one Night being at Supper with
some Gentlemen of the Island, one of the Company
gave me a kind Invitation to come over to his Plan∣tation,
near <HI>Salt-pan-Hill,</HI> there to spend three
Weeks or a Month with him in a retired Life. I
readily embraced the Opportunity, as hoping there∣by
to gain the Favour of being recommended to
some Employment on the Island. The next Day
we went to his Country Seat, far more resembling
the infernal Regions, than the pleasing Abode of a
Mortal here on Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
His numerous Attendants, both Male and Fe∣male,
were all Black, and their young, like Swine,
lay groveling in the Dust. Here the parched and
yawning Earth brought to my Remembrance, how
Dame <HI>Tullis</HI> raised up her barren Head, invoking
<HI>Jove</HI> to crush the giddy <HI>Phaeton</HI> in his wild and
mad Carreer, and by his deserved fall, to save her
vast Dominions from an universal Conflagration.
As this Gentleman had no <HI>European</HI> but myself to
Converse, I soon became familiar with him, who
being acquainted with my Circumstances, promis'd
to serve me to the utmost of his Capacity, Al∣though
I here enjoyed all that the Island afforded,
yet a retired Life was not agreeable to my own
Disposition; and therefore, I resolved to use some
Stratagem to get a little Cash of him, and then go
on board the Fleet commanded by Admiral <HI>Stew∣ard.</HI>
To effect this, I proposed to live with this
Gentleman as his Servant or Overseer, which Fa∣vour
after many Solicitations, and earnest Entrea∣ties
was granted, and my designed Employment
was to overlook the Negroes in the Fishery. Now
as soon as Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> (for that was the Gentleman's
Name) and I, had agreed on Terms for my Wages,
I freely told him, that my Chest and Cloaths lay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as a Security for twenty Dollars at Port Royal, and
I most humbly entreated him to advance me Mo∣ney
for the Redemption of the same; to which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
readily consented, and ordered his Negroes t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Man the Canoe, and then row me over to Port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Royal, and there wait till I had compleated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Business.</P>
<P>No sooner was I landed there, but I took one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Slaves with me to a Tavern, and there gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
him a Letter to carry to his Master, the Contents
whereof were, 'That I returned him many Thanks
for his kind Entertainment, and generous Assist∣ance;
but that Fortune had unexpectedly provid∣ed
something for me far superior to the Station
of a Servant; that I hoped he would excuse my
Breach of Promise, and that as to the Cash, that
he had lent me, I would repay him as soon as
possible.' Having thus dismissed the Negroe, I
forthwith addressed myself to the aforesaid Admi∣ral,
who generously compassionating my Youth,
and Misfortunes, was pleased to order me on board
the same Ship that brought me thither, and the
Commander thereof, favoured me with the Liberty
of walking the Quarter Deck. In three or four
Days, the Fleet sailed round for Port Antonio, si∣tuate
on the Northermost Part of the Island, where
we continued near four Months, all Hands being
daily employed Ashore, in building a Dock for his
Majesty's Service. From whence we returned to
Port Royal, and after a short stay there, our Ship
was ordered home to Plymouth, and there, soon
after paid off. Whilst I was on board, I had con∣tracted
an Intimacy with the Surgeon's Mate, and
we two now became inseparable Companions, we
both lodging at the Three Guns at the Dock. A∣midst
the various Company that resorted thither,
was an old Gentleman, Clerk of the Dock Yard, a
Man of an affable and engaging Temper, with
whom, as he daily frequented the House, we soon
became acquainted. This Gentleman had a very
agreeable young Lady for his Daughter, with
whom, as she accidentally came to call her Father
Home, my Comrade, the Doctor, was so smitten
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
at the first Sight, that he could not rest, till he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
engaged her and her Father, to favour us with thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Company, to Supper on the following Evening
Mr. B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, (for that was the Gentleman's Name
readily consented, and we passed the Hours i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mirth and Gaiety; the young Lady to heighter
our Pleasures, diverting us with several Songs
Between Twelve and One we waited on our Com∣pany
Home, and afterwards returned to our Quar∣ters,
where the Doctor was now more inflamed, his
Thoughts and Discourse running continually on
the Perfections of his new Mistress. But, for my
Part, I concealed my ardent Passion, and resolved
to wait a more favourable Opportunity, of dis∣closing
my Love and Esteem, in an honourable
Manner, if so it may be called in me, who had al∣ready
tied the Conjugal Knot. In the mean Time,
the Doctor and I (being both flush with Money) re∣velled
at large, till by our repeated Extravagan∣cies,
we had almost drained our Pockets, and in
return to our Folly, got the <HI>French</HI> Disease.</P>
<P>However, one Day as we were playing at Bil∣liards,
I looking out of the Window, accidentally
saw my Charmer standing at the Door of a Corner
Shop; whereupon, giving the Game for lost, Doc∣tor,
said I, there's Molly, come, let's go and drink
a Dish of Tea with her; by no Means, replied he,
for the People of the House are Strangers, and
consequently would deem it Impudence in us to
force any Acquaintance with them. No matter
for that quoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if you won't go, I will; so down
Stairs I ran to the Shop, and (as in a Surprize)
said, Bless me, Madam! what good Fortune has
brought you hither, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'ve oftentimes promised my∣self
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
the Happiness of drinking Tea with you, but
never till now had the Opportunity; so slipping
into the Shop, I told the Mistress thereof, that I
hoped she would excuse my Freedom, in desiring
the favour of her to make a Pot of Tea, and at the
same Time flung down Half a Crown as a Satis∣faction
for her Trouble.</P>
<P>She seemed very well pleased to have the Op∣portunity
of obliging her Cousin, as she called her,
and me, and therefore desired us to walk into the
Parlour, whilst she prepared the Tea Equipage.
Here I freely disclosed my Mind to my lovely God∣dess,
and met with a more favourable Reception
than I expected: soon after, in came the old Gen∣tleman,
who merrily said, So, so, Mr. <HI>Englefield,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
see that <HI>Molly</HI> and you are got together. Yes, Sir,
said I, and since I have had the Pleasure of
drinking Tea with Miss, I desire the Favour that
we may now go and drink a Glass together, for
I've something to impart to you of great Conse∣quence.
Agreed to, Sir, replyed he, and you and
I will go first, and <HI>Molly,</HI> if she pleases, may fol∣low
after us. In short, I told the old Gentleman
how passionately I loved his Daughter, and that I
should be proud to make her my Wife: Whilst we
were thus discoursing, <HI>Molly</HI> came to us, where∣upon
I shewed all possible Marks of sincere Love
and Esteem for her in the Presence of her Father,
who invited me to breakfast with him next Mor∣ning.
All this Time, my good Friend, the Doc∣tor,
was on Thorns, and longed to know the Result
of our long Conferences, which I told him was
on various Subjects, but never mentioned that I
had made the least Prosser of Love to <HI>Molly,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I was to go there in the Morning to Breakfast
Wherefore I arose early, and under a Pretence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
taking a Walk, went privately to Mr. <HI>Brown</HI>'s, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
received me with the utmost Civility, and left hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Daughter and me alone in the Parlour; here it was
that I repeated my Addresses, and passionately
expressed my inviolable and constant Love, vowing
always to maintain the same fixed and unalterable.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> length▪ the Nymph consented, provided that
her Father would be content to ratify it; where∣upon▪
warmly saluting her, I went into the Gar∣den
to the old Gentleman, and desiring him to
consummate our Happiness by his consent; to
which he generously replied, since my Daughter
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> willing, I am content. Whereupon we went in
to breakfast, and all my desires being<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus hap∣pily
accomplished, I took my Leave for the pre∣sent.</P>
<P>As soon as I came to my Lodgings, I began
seriously to reflect on my past Folly in engaging
myself in so solemn and important an Affair, with∣out
any Probability of effecting what I had seem∣ingly
carried on with so much Success; the sole
Reason whereof was owing to my Imprudence;
for although I made a gay Appearance, yet I had
but ten Shillings lest in Money, and moreover was
severely pepper'd by the Favours of a Miss I had
met with at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Wherefore on mature De∣liberation,
of the Consequences that must inevita∣bly
arise from the Consumption of my intended
Nuptials, I determined to visit her once more, to
let her know, that, that I had received an Ordor
from my Friends to repair to London forthwith,
on some urgent Affair; but that upon the Con∣clusion
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
thereof, I would return, and honourably
perform my promise. <HI>Molly</HI> seemed well enough
pleased herewith, but insisted on knowing how to
write to me, whereupon I told her to direct to
the <HI>Gun</HI> Tavern at <HI>Billingsgate.</HI> Now there be∣ing
a Sloop ready to sail that Day for <HI>London,</HI> my
Friend the Doctor and I, embark'd therein, and
landed at <HI>Tower</HI> Stairs.</P>
<P>The first thing I then did, was to send for Mr.
<HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e,</HI> to whom I related my Adventures, and
of him enquired into the State of the Bankruptcy:
Hereupon he told me, that Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n,</HI> and the
Assignees, were involved in Law, and that no
Dividend had as yet been made, but says he, I
have two Guineas for you, that was lest by your
worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Gilpin,</HI> which I should have
sent to you on board the Ship that you went out
in, had I not heard that she was sailed before I
could possibly remit them to you. Mr. <HI>Brown</HI>
has sent your Wife to board in the North of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
but as to the particular Place I can't inform
you. I would therefore now advise you to lodge
privately on <HI>Southwark</HI> Side, where if you send
me a Direction, I will sometimes call and see you.
Hereupon I took my leave of him, and went in
search of an Apartment, which by good Fortune
I soon met with, agreeable to my Taste, it being
in a Publick House, where I had the Room <HI>Gra∣tis.</HI>
Near unto my Mansion lived a Mantua∣maker
and her Daughter who I besieged so closely,
that in a little Time her Virtue began to stagger,
and her Concupiscence to be a Tiptoe. In short,
the sole Prevention of her Ruin was my being so
pickled with the abovementioned Distemper. Not∣withstanding
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
this, I visited the Assignees and the
Attorney two or three times a Week, from who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I had a constant Supply of Money, though n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sufficient to support my Extravagancies. Where∣fore
being now pretty deep in my Landlord's Deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I resolved to make another Trip to Sea, but wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
happily prevented, by being one Day arrested as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was walking in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> at the Suit of a Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who had been Attendant on my Wife in her Pro∣gress
to <HI>Flanders.</HI> For this Debt I was clappe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into the <HI>Poultry Compter,</HI> and now thinking my<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self
secure for some Time, I applied to my Frien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e,</HI> who generously ordered a Surgeon to at∣tend
me for my Cure. In this unhappy Place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
soon became acquainted with some of the most
notorious Villains and noted Prostitutes of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Town, from whose bewitching Conversation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sucked in the deadly Poison of unblushing Vice,
and lost what Impressions of Virtue and Honour I
had yet remaining.</P>
<P>Here I continued near eleven Months, living
on the Spoils of the unfortunate, whom I used to
cheat and cozen at Cards and Dice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'till being
wearied of this long and tedious Confinement, I
entered into a Conspiracy with two others, to take
the Opportunity when the Turnkey brought in the
unhappy Women of the Town at Night, to force
our Passage out; but this base Design was frustrated
by one of the Confederates turning Informer,
whereupon I was confined for four Days in the
strong Hold, and afterwards moved by a Duce
to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where (it being the Summer Time)
through the noisome and filthy Stench of the Place,
I fell dangerously ill, whereupon my Friends com∣passionating
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
my Misfortunes, and to prevent the
scandalous Reflection of my Death in so detestable
a Place, procured my Enlargement, and generously
paid for my Board and Lodging for three Months,
hoping that in that Time I should get into some
honest Employment.</P>
<P>Now being pretty well recovered of my indispo∣sition,
by propitious Fortune, I crept into the
good Graces of Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s Attorney, who em∣ployed
me for a considerable Time.</P>
<P>One Day I chanced to meet <HI>John Gadbury,</HI> (my
former Landlord in <HI>Holland</HI>) who had ran away
with my Wife's Effects whom I dogged to his
Lodgings, and acquainting my Attorney for the
Commission therewith, had him secured in the
<HI>Fleet,</HI> from whence after seven Months Imprison∣ment,
he made his Escape to the great detriment
of the Warden, who was obliged thereby to sa∣tisfy
our Demands. Upon the abovementioned
Attorney's going to settle in the Country, I con∣tracted
with one <HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>k,</HI> a Buckle-maker in
<HI>Water-Lane, Fleet-street,</HI> to learn the Art of carv∣ing
Buckles. Our Agreement was, that I should
serve him twelve Months, and for his Trouble in
instructing me in that Branch of Business, give
him a Promissory Note for twenty five Pounds,
payable six Months after the Expiration of my
Servitude. For some time I lived very happy with
this Man, 'till by an unexpected Accident he be∣came
jealous of me and his Wife; the sole Reason
whereof was as follows. A Relation of Mr.
<HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI>'s, who supplied the Widow <HI>A<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n,</HI> at
the <HI>Star</HI> Musick House near the Dock-head <HI>South∣wark,</HI>
with Wine, used annually to give an Enter∣tertainment
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
there, to which he always invited m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Master and Mistress. Now it happened that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Master was ill at the Time appointed for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Merry-making, wherefore he desired me to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
company his Spouse thither, to which I readi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
agreed, and the Hours passing swiftly away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Mirth and Dancing we staid there till four o'Cloc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the Morning. This innocent, though imprude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Action, gave Birth to his Fears and Jealousies, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
caused him to imagine that I had violated t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Rights of his Marriage Bed. However, he too
no Notice thereof for the present, but resolved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
watch for an Opportunity to confirm what he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ready suspected.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>k</HI> had a Neice, a very pret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
young Girl, for whom I prosessed a great Respec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and used always to wait on her home, when s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
came to visit her Uncle. Now it fell out, that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Morning as I was in the Kitchen, and my Master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Stairs, that this young Woman came and asked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Aunt to take a Walk to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ington</HI>; my Mistress co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sented,
and I out of a Frolick offered my Service

of Nod,</HI> which being readily accepted, I pretend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to my Moster, that I was obliged to attend the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
signees in the Afternoon, and therefore desired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Leave to make half a Holliday; he freely comply
with my Request, and I, according to my Agreemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
met my Company at the Place appointed, but h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

puffing and blowing like a Porpice, and almost as pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as Ashes; his first Salutation was a blow on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Wife's Head with a large Stick, which he wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have repeated had I not prevented him. The W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
men affrighted, ran out of the Room, and he and I
sat down together, where I used all possible Arguments
to eradicate these groundless Whimsies that possessed
his Brain; but all to no Purpose, for he remained
inflexible, and vowed Revenge on her. Wherefore
finding it in vain to reconcile the Difference, and
that I should run in danger of my Life, if I continued
any longer in his Service, I proposed a Separation,
to prevent any farther Mischief, which he readily
agreed to. Now being destitute of all Business, I
lived on the Reversions of a Prostitute of the Town,
'till growing weary of that scandalous Course of Life,
I resolved to go to Sea, and therefore applied to my
Friend <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e,</HI> who was so kind as to obtain for
me a Letter of Recommendation to Captain <HI>Tollard,</HI>
Commander of the <HI>Pearl</HI> Man of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that was go∣ing
on her Station to <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> Now I might have
been happy, and recovered my lost Reputation and
Credit, had I been so wise as to have gone on board
pursuant to Order; but so prevalent was my lewd
Habit of Life, that I could not quit the ruinous
Company of my Harlot, with whom I staid in
Dalliances of lawless Love, till the Ship was
sailed.</P>
<P>By this Imprudent Action I entirely disobliged all
my Friends, and was therefore obliged to keep on
in the same abandoned and despicable State of Life,
till one Day, as I crossed <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Square,</HI> I
was arrested by Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> the Officer at the Suit of
<HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>k,</HI> my former Master. Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> know∣ing
me when I was in Prosperity conducted me
to his House, where he told me I might remain as
long as I could find Money. I was now in the utmost
Despair, and had there ended my Days miserably by
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
hanging myself, had not the Rope unfortunately
broke.</P>
<P>Now Mr. <HI>Dod</HI>'s wife being ill, had lodgings in
the country, and his business often calling him out, I
was left in the house with only two women servants,
which made me resolve to take the first favourable op∣portunity
of making my escape, neither was it long
before I effected it; for one day as <HI>Dod,</HI> and his fol∣lower
were gone to <HI>Kentish Town,</HI> I sent the old
woman out for a quart of gin, and ply'd her so
close with that intoxicating liquor, that she soon fell
fast asleep. As to the young one, I elevated her spi∣rits
with sack and walnuts, till by amorous toys,
and merry waggish tales, I prevailed on her to grant
me the favour of standing at the street door for the
benefit of the air. In the interim came by a barrow
of peaches, whereupon, come, my dear, said I, will
you eat a peach? she replying, yes, sir, I gave her
sixpence to purchase some of them, but did not stay
to partake of the remainder, for I immediately ran
down to <HI>Temple</HI>-stairs, and crossed the water, where
I lay perdue at the house of one <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> an acquaint∣ance
of mine, who employed me to make handles for
brushes, and afterwards recommended me to Mr.
<HI>Weed,</HI> a colourman, who had built a Shed in a
field remote from all houses, where he boiled his bul∣lock's
blood, an ingredient used amongst them in the
composition of blue. This retired life, attended with
a noisome stench did not long agree with me, and
therefore I resolved to sell myself for a four year's ser∣vant.
Accordingly I contracted with one <HI>Burge,</HI> who
sent me on board the <HI>Spanish Town</HI> Factor captain
<HI>Gray,</HI> bound to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> In my passage I settled the
captain's books, who sold me for a school-master
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
to Colonel <HI>Sands</HI> at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> who having a Plan∣tation
at <HI>Saltpan-Hill,</HI> removed me and his children
thither, for the better conveniency of their education.
Here I continued near three months, frequently di∣verting
myself in the company of one <HI>Quimino,</HI> a
facetious and trusty negroe slave, belonging to my
master, till growing weary of the mean and poor
diet I met with there I resolved at all events to run
away; and accordingly about four in the morning,
I went privately to <HI>Passage Fort,</HI> but had not got
into the boat that was to carry me to <HI>Kingston,</HI> before
I was pursued, overtaken, and conducted back. Not∣withstanding
this, I still remained obstinate, and insisted
on going to the colonel's at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> which being
agreed to, I loudly exclaimed against the ill Treat∣ment
I had met with, and plainly told him, that I
would serve him no longer; which so exasperated the
colonel, that he threatened to have me whipt by his
negroes. Enraged at this menace, I swore that
nothing less than his life should expatiate the gross
affront; whereupon he finding me so resolute, remanded
me to my former captain, with whom (he having bu∣ried
one of his hands) I returned to <HI>England,</HI> and
in the <HI>Downs</HI> was pressed by his majesty's ship the
<HI>Portland,</HI> from whence I went to <HI>Ilvercomb, Bri∣stol,</HI>
and <HI>Bath,</HI> and rambled up and down the country
with my comrade, who was one of our corporals o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
board, till having expended all our cash, we made
the best of our way to <HI>London,</HI> taking the opportu∣nity
of passing for sea-faring men cast away in the
<HI>Lamb,</HI> captain <HI>Morgan,</HI> bound for <HI>Ireland,</HI> with
the transport soldiers; by which false pretence we
obtained great relief on the road. When we came
to <HI>London,</HI> we lodged in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, at one of those
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
mean and scandalous houses, that harbour strangers
for two pence a night. But this life not being agree∣able
to either of us, I persuaded my companion to en∣ter
for a soldier in the foot guards, and for my part
I sold myself once more to go to <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> and con∣tinued
on board near a week in the river; but there
finding indifferent usage, and searing to meet with
worse at sea, I stole ashore in company with a weaver▪
who was likewise going on the same foolish errand▪
From thence we travelled to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where pre∣tending
ourselves to be <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> we were r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieved
by the Protestants of that town, and then continued
on our journey to <HI>Dover,</HI> where by good fortune we
met with captain <HI>Jennings,</HI> who gave us our passage
to <HI>Calais.</HI> At my landing there, I was solicited by
by several <HI>Irish</HI> officers to enlist into the <HI>French</HI> ser∣vice,
but would by no means agree to their proposals.
My companion now parted from me in search of bu∣siness,
but I entered myself on board a snow, loaded
with corn, and bound for <HI>Lisbon.</HI> At <HI>Calais,</HI> we
staid seven weeks, in which time the captain and
all the crew were so involved in debt, that we
were obliged to put to sea in the middle of the
night. When we arrived at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> the Com∣mander
was turned out of his employ, and we all
paid off.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>English</HI> Fleet lying there, I had some
thoughts of entering on Board thereof, but was
prevented by Messr. <HI>Ibraham</HI> and <HI>Joseph Guest,</HI>
who kept a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avern at <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Bay,</HI> who agreed
with me sor ten Pounds per Annuum to serve them
in the Capacity of a Drawer. Here I must con∣fess
that I lived upon the best that the City af∣forded
and each of my Masters keeping a sepa∣rate
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
Lady of Pleasure, I likewise grew wanton,
and maintain'd a Miss for myself; but as this
Course of Life could not be supposed to have any
long Duration, my Master soon fail'd, and I there∣by
was obliged to seek out for a fresh Service.
Hereupon I shipp'd myself with Captain <HI>Brook,</HI>
Commander of the <HI>Sarah</HI> Galley, bound to <HI>Sancta-Cruz,</HI>
in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cadiz</HI> and
so home to <HI>England</HI>; but the Captain and I not
long agreeing together, I ran away from her at
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> from thence, (after I had involved myself in
Debt) I made the best of my Way to <HI>Malaga</HI> by
by Land, all through the Province of <HI>Andaluzia.</HI>
In my Journey, I was greatly surprized at the Po∣verty,
and extreme Misery of the Inhabitants,
chiefly owing to their Bigottry, they scarcely hav∣ing
Bread to eat whilst the pretended Religious are
pampered up in the most exuberant Luxury.</P>
<P>When I arrived at <HI>Malaga,</HI> I lodged at one <HI>O'∣Brian</HI>'s
almost a Month upon Credit, but finding
at last cold Reception, I resolved to apply myfelf
to the Clergy, who I knew full well were the only
Persons for me to work on, and having observed
that it was customary for some of them to frequent
the Sea-side daily; I seated myself there on a Stone,
and in a melancholy Posture waited for their com∣ing;
nor was it long before two of the Dominican
Order came, and seated themselves by me, asking
in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, what Countryman I was?
I replied in <HI>Latin,</HI> an <HI>Englishman</HI>; whereupon ac∣cording
to their foolish Notion, deoming me no
Christian, and therefore incapable of Salvation,
they out of their seeming Piety, invited me to
their Convent, there to be instructed in their Faith.
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
In short, I verify'd the old Proverb, <HI>Necessity has
no Law</HI>; for being then almost starved, I was glad
to embrace any thing that offered for my imme∣diate
Relief, and pretending to be entirely igno∣rant
of the <HI>Romish</HI> Principals, I pass'd on them for
a great Proficient therein. Here I liv'd a retir'd
and indolent Life near four Months, during which
Time they often press'd me to the Acceptance of
the Habit, which I always declin'd, as having an
Aversion to their superstitious Follies, though by
them artfully contrived to impose on the giddy
Vulgar. These Fathers recommended me to the
Service of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Nobleman, in Quality of Page
to his Lady, with whom I liv'd eleven Months, till
being unfortunately discover'd in an Amour with
his Niece, whom I had debauched, and was forced
to skreen myself from the Rage of the injured
<HI>Don,</HI> by leaping out at the Window, and making
the best of my Way to the House of an <HI>Irish</HI> Tay∣lor
of my Acquaintance, where I lay concealed
for a considerable Time, till at length meeting
with a Sloop bound to <HI>Gibralter,</HI> and from thence
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> I entered on Board thereof, our Passage
was unparallell'd, and hardly credible, for we were
thirty-five Days before we got into the Bay at
<HI>Gibralter,</HI> which from <HI>Malaga,</HI> is but eighteen
Leagues distant. Wherefore thinking that such an
uncommon and unusual Disappointment, portend∣ed
something fatal attendant on our Sloop. I there
quitted her, and offered myself as a Soldier in the
Garrison, but was rejected, by the Followers of
<HI>Mars,</HI> on Account of my Stature, whereupon
having nothing to subsist on, I was forc'd to per∣form
the disagreeable and slavish Part of a Labour∣er
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
to the <HI>Bricklayers,</HI> which I thought was the
greatest Hardship that I ever yet met with, and
therefore I resolved to quit this intollerable fatiguing
Service, and seek out for some other more facile.</P>
<P>Accordingly I applied my self to the <HI>Tennis-Court,</HI>
and served therein as a Waiter; but that
likewise did not answer my Expectation, for my
Mistress, on Account of the wet Season, not hav∣ing
so much Company as usual, put me to fetch
Water from the Fountain, and clean the Hogsties,
which servile Employs not consisting with my No∣tions
of Life, I quitted her Service, and com∣menced
Usher to a School-master, who not living
within the Bounds of his Scholastical Revenues,
was in a little Time compelled to quit the Gar∣rison.</P>
<P>I now thought I had a fair Expectance of suc∣ceeding
him in that Occupation, but my Hopes
therein prov'd abortive, through the Malice of some
envious Persons, who represented me to the then
Governor (General <HI>Sabine</HI>) as a Person sent thither
as a Spy, though in Disguise; whereupon his Ex∣cellency
ordered me to be confin'd in the <HI>Moor</HI>'s
Castle, and in a noisome and filthy Cell, where I
continued for the Space of seventeen Days; at the
Expiration of which I was released and turned out
of the Garrison. Whereupon I shipp'd myself as
<HI>Cook</HI> on Board a <HI>Tartan,</HI> commanded by one <HI>An∣thony
Jenkins,</HI> bound for <HI>Walidea,</HI> on the <HI>Barbary</HI>
Shore. We went out in our Ballast, with four
<HI>Moorish</HI> Merchants on Board, that were to freight
our Vessel with Corn, and then return to <HI>Gibralter,</HI>
for the Sale thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110"/>
But the Master, either through his Ignorance, or
adverse Winds, could not gain his desired Port;
but kept busking the Sea, till our Provisions were
almost expended, and we reduced to the Allow∣ance
of three Pound of <HI>Barbary</HI> Rusk per Week,
and half a Pint of Water a Day. These Hard∣ships,
with the ill Treatment of the Master, made
me resolve to leave him as soon as possible, and
soon after it luckily happen'd that I had an Oppor∣tunity
of effecting what I so much desired, for in
a - hard Gale of Wind we sprung our Mast, and
tore our Sails to shatters, but at length the Storm
abating, we the next Day made the <HI>Canary-Islands,</HI>
when putting her before the Wind, under an old
spare maintop Sail, that we had on Board, we an∣chor'd
about eight at Night at the <HI>Colerada</HI>'s be∣longing
to the Island of <HI>Lancerota</HI>; our Captain
being afraid to go into the usual Port of that Place,
left his Hands, who had been all barbarously treat∣ed
by him, should run ashore and leave him. Now
resolved to loose no Time in freeing myself
from this Slavery, and therefore about Twelve o'
Clock at Night, my two Confederates and I, after
we had taken three Pieces of Linnen, and what
else we could find, from the <HI>Moors,</HI> embarked in
the Boat, and went ashore, making the best of
our Way from the Sea Side, though we knew not
whither it led to. About the Dawn of Day we
met with a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> mounted on a <HI>Bourico,</HI> or
Jack-Ass, who civilly bidding us Good-Morrow,
asked for an old Pipe, whereupon, I having the
Language at Command, returned the Compliment,
and favour'd him with one half full of Tobacco;
whereat he expressed a great Satisfaction, and at
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
the same Time gave me to understand, that he was
Mayor of that Town, which we then saw on the
Hill. I confess that by his mean Garb, and
wretched Appearance, I had formed a despicable
Idea of the rest of the Inhabitants, which was fur∣ther
augmented at the Sight of their poor strag∣gling
Huts, and miserable manner of Life; their
common Diet being Greens and Oatmeal, mixed
with cold Water, which they call <HI>Gosio</HI>; neither
do any of the Inhabitants, except the Grandees
and Clergy (altho' the Island affords plenty of
Corn) ever bake any Bread for their own Use.</P>
<P>In the Evening by the help of our Guide, whom
we hired for two Reals of Plate, about a Shilling
Value, we reach'd the Port, where stood ten or
twelve ruined Houses, with only one which ap∣pear'd
in tollerable good Repair, which upon En∣quiry,
we found was the Mansion Seat of Seignor
<HI>Don Bernado Trojano Cocillio de los Esperones,</HI> the
Person who assumed to himself the Title of the
<HI>British</HI> Consul; to this Gentleman we complained
of the ill Treatment that we had received from
our Commander, representing him as no Christian,
but as an Encourager to <HI>Mahometism,</HI> and to
prove our Assertion, we declared, that he had
four <HI>Moors</HI> on Board.</P>
<P>In short, we made him appear so black in the
<HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Eyes, that he thought him a mere De∣vil,
often signing himself with the Cross<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the
mention of his Name. Whereupon he commise∣rated
our Hardships, and entertained us very
handsomely for three Days: To this Gentleman
we sold our Linnen Cloth for 40 Dollars, but not
thinking it secure to make any longer Stay here,
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
least the Captain (who without Dispute would come
in Search of us) shou'd on his Appearance confute
our Assertions, and thereby making us appear
greater Villains, than what we had represented him,
and obtain an Order to have us bound Neck and
Heels, and carried on Board, where we could expect
no Mercy from him, or the injured <HI>Moors,</HI> we there∣fore
went privately in the Night to the Place called
<HI>la Valla,</HI> the Residence of the Governor, where
stood two Convents, one of <HI>Dominican,</HI> and the
other of <HI>Franciscan</HI> Fryars, where we took Sanc∣tuary,
my two Comrades in the latter, and I in the
former Monastery.</P>
<P>The Priors of the respective Orders, treated us
very handsomly, and promised to secure us from
all Danger, if we kept in the Confines of their pri∣viledged
Territories. We had not been long here,
before the Captain came up to the Governor's, and
upon Complaint, that he could not put to Sea
without his Hands, obtained of him an Order to
apprehend us, if found without the Limits of the
Convents, it not being in his Power to take us out
of the Pale of the Church. Hereupon the Captain
endeavoured by Flattery, to persuade us to return
on Board, but all in vain, for we not only resolved
to continue in our Station, but also to do him all
the Prejudice we cou'd; and therefore I drew up a
Complaint to the Governor, and prevailed on the
Prior to present it to his Excellency, setting forth
our barbarous Usage; and that the said Com∣mander
had <HI>Moors</HI> on Board, who under Pretence
of Traffick, came to take a View of the Island,
in order to return with Force, and surprise the
Inhabitants. This so incensed the Governor, that
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
he ordered a Company of Soldiers on Board, to
search the Vessel, and to oblige the Captain to
pay 334 Dollars as a Fine for not anchoring in
the open Port; and furthermore, to put to Sea
in ten Days Time. All which he unable to resist
their superior Power, was obliged to comply
with.</P>
<P>As soon as he was sailed, we ranged through
the Island at our Liberty, and were civilly enter∣tained
by the Natives, in the best manner they
could afford. My Companions went on Board a
<HI>Genoese</HI> Vessel, but I waited for the Arrival of the
Father Provincial, well knowing that if I had the
Fortune to get into his good Graces, that it would
turn considerably to my Advantage; wherefore on
his Arrival there, I play'd my Cards with so
much Art and Cunning, that I soon obtained the
Favour of waiting on his Person, who I must ac∣knowledge
treated me with the utmost Humanity.
With him I went to <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> another of the
<HI>Canary</HI> Islands, where I continued in the same Post;
but altho' I never wanted for the best of Victuals,
nor Cloaths, nevertheless seeing no Prospect of
getting Money in his Service, (the Clergy of that
Profession being generally much addicted to the
inordinate Love thereof) I left him, and from
thence proceeded to the Port of <HI>Oratava,</HI> where
for some Time I was maintain'd by the <HI>English</HI>
Merchants; but as Courtesies of that Nation are
not of any long Duration, I was soon obliged to
Ship myself on Board the <HI>Charming Molly</HI> Captain
<HI>Patrick Mackhugh,</HI> bound to <HI>Genoa,</HI> where we un∣loaded
onr <HI>Orchilea,</HI> (a Weed used by the <HI>Dyers</HI>)
and after about a Month's Continuance there, we
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
loaded with Bale Goods for <HI>Cadiz.</HI> And I now
waiting on the Captain, I had an Opportunity of
seeing the Directions of the several Letters that he
brought for the numerous Merchants of that City,
and amongst them I found one directed to Messrs.
<HI>Ryan</HI> and <HI>Mannock</HI>; whereupon knowing Mr.
<HI>Mannock</HI> to have been my old School-fellow, and
familiar Companion when in Trade, I resolv'd to
wait on him, and therefore asked the Captain Li∣berty
to go ashore, where I secreted myself all
Night in a <HI>Genoese</HI> House, and the next Morning
waited on my worthy Friend, who asked me
<HI>What Service could he do me?</HI> To which generous
Offer I reply'd, <HI>Sir, please to obtain my Discharge
from the Commander.</HI> Whereupon he immediately
gave me a Note to the Captain for that Purpose;
yet he absolutely refused to discharge me, and the
next Day sailed for St. <HI>Lucan,</HI> to load with Fruit
for <HI>London,</HI> leaving me behind. Mr. <HI>Mannock</HI> (as
my Wages were but trivial) advised me not to trou∣ble
myself about them, but ordered me to take a
Lodging, and come to Dinner with him every
Day, untill he could procure my Passage to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
in a Gentleman-like manner; he enabled me
besides to quit my Seaman's Garb, and gave me a
genteel Suit of his own, with Shirts, Hat, Wig,
&amp;c. and 20 Pistoles in my Pocket.</P>
<P>Now I began to taste the Pleasures of Life once
more and buried all my former Hardships in Obli∣vion;
yet still I observed a regular and sedate
Conduct for fear of disobliging my generous Pa∣tron;
till one Night in the <HI>Carnaval</HI> Time I unfor∣tunately
picked up a <HI>Spanish</HI> Lady, with whom I
went Home, and spent the Evening in lewd Plea∣sures,
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
sures, and as I was returning Home thro' a dark
Passage, my Hat and Wig were snatch'd from off
my Head, and at the same Time a Book that I
had borrowed of my Friend was pick'd out of my
Pocket. The Place was so dark and obscure, that
I could not discover the Villain, who fled as fast
as he could, and soon skreen'd himself from my
fruitless Pursuit.</P>
<P>It is oftentimes very Dangerous for Strangers
at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and many other Places in <HI>Spain,</HI> to fre∣quent
Houses kept by Courtezans, because there
are frequently, if not always, Fellows who resort
thither and make their Prey of poor Sailors, and
others, who are so unfortunate as to go thither.
They watch every Person very narrowly and are
sure to make something of them; for if they
have not an Opportunity of robbing you in the
House, you are sure to be met, and plundered
as you return home to your Quarters; and many
Times <HI>English</HI> Sailors have been stabb'd in dark
Places in that City a cruel Instance of which
happened during the Time I tarried there.</P>
<P>A young Fellow, an Irishman, Clerk to the
Captain of the <HI>Cales</HI> Factor, (for <HI>Cales</HI> is more
frequently used by Mariners than <HI>Cadiz</HI>) being
returning from a bad House, where he had idly
spent two Days and Nights with lewd Women,
and squandered away a great deal of Cash, he was
attacked in the Dusk of the Evening by some
Assassins, who barbarously murdered him, after
they had taken all his Money, and even stript all
the Cloaths from off his Back; and I never could
hear that these Russians were ever detected, tho'
the British Consul and the Commander of the Ves∣sel
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
to which the Youth belonged, publish'd a Re∣ward
for apprehending them; and the Governor
of <HI>Cadiz</HI> did all he could to bring them to Justice
and Punishment; but all the Searches that were
made by the Officers of the City were ineffectual,
and the Rogues were never found out, as I ever
heard of.</P>
<P>This unhappy Affair however, put most of
the British and Irish Seamen on their Guard, who
rather chose to tarry on board their respective
Ships, than hazard their Lives on Shore among
such abandoned Wretches as the Courtezans, and
the Villains who resort amongst them, who act
much in the same Manner as Bullies do to the
common Prostitutes who ply in <HI>London</HI> Streets,
but with a good deal more Caution, for fear of
being clapp'd up in Prison, from which they are
seldom or ever discharged, without being fined,
and corporally punished. But, to return to my
own Story.</P>
<P>Stung with Remorse, not so much I confess for
the Offence, as for the Loss I had sustained; I
went Home greatly perplex'd, how to prevent
this sad Disaster from reaching my Friend's Ear,
which full well I knew I cou'd not effect but by
procuring the Book the sole Obstacle to the
Concealment of my past Folly; but Mr. <HI>Mannock</HI>
had unfortunately heard of the Affair by the Book
being exposed to Sale; wherefore at Dinner he
asked me for the same, saying, <HI>That he highly
esteemed it, as being a present from his Brother to
him.</HI> I blush'd, and after Dinner called him aside,
freely acknowledged my Fault, and humbly begg'd
Pardon for the Offence, which he generously for∣gave;
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
but cautioned me to beware of the like
Folly for the future. I now resolved, (since my
Friend was acquainted with the Amour) to make
the Harlot (whom I suspected to be an Accom∣plice
in the Robbery) to render me an ample Sa∣tisfaction
for the Injury received, and therefore I
made my Complaints to the Alcade Major, or
Mayor of the Town, who order'd two Officers to
go with me to the House, and to demand the
Goods I had lost; and if the Prostitute refused to
deliver them, to seize her Effects, and carry her to
Prison. In short the Hussy to prevent the im∣pending
Storm returned the Things, and as an At∣tonement
for her Crime, gave the Officer and me
a Dollar a-piece, and a handsome Treat.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cadiz,</HI> I had an Opportunity of keeping
Company with some Spanish Sea Officers, and
other Gentlemen of Fashion, who finding me a
Man of tolerable Capacity, took some Pains to
instruct me in the Spanish Language. Many Au∣thors
have mentioned the Multiplicity of Titles
used by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but without having
perfect Knowledge of them, and therefore I will
here give them my Readers.</P>
<P>He is stiled King of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon,</HI> of <HI>Ara∣gon,</HI>
of the two <HI>Sicilies,</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI>
of <HI>Navarre,</HI> of <HI>Grenada,</HI> of <HI>Toledo,</HI> of <HI>Va∣lencia,</HI>
of <HI>Galicia,</HI> of <HI>Majorca,</HI> of <HI>Sevil,</HI> of <HI>Sar∣dinia,</HI>
of <HI>Cardovia,</HI> of <HI>Corsica,</HI> of <HI>Murcia,</HI> of <HI>Jean,</HI> of the <HI>Algarves,</HI> of <HI>Algezira,</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> of the <HI>Canary Islands,</HI> of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI> Islands
and Continent of the Ocean, Arch-Duke of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI>
Duke of <HI>Burgundy, Brabant</HI> and <HI>Milan,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
Earl of <HI>Flanders Tirol</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> Lord of
<HI>Bisca</HI> and <HI>Molina, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I have been in the City of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which is a
very antient one, and was built by <HI>Barea,</HI> a Car∣thagenian,
200 Years before Christ, has a safe
Harbour on the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> is large, well for∣tify'd,
and secured by a Castle without it, called
<HI>Mount Jovi.</HI> It was well built before the French
Siege in 1688, which ruined many stately Struc∣tures,
and the Inhabitants were rich. Into this
Place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> put all their Foot, under the
Command of the Prince of <HI>Hesse Darmstadt.</HI> The
<HI>French</HI> opened their Trenches, and carry'd them
on with extraordinary Vigour, though much re∣tarded
by bad Weather, and the continual Fire of
the Besieg'd. At the same Time the <HI>French</HI> Fleet
riding before the Harbour threw in abundance of
Bombs. The Garrison made several great Sallies,
in which many Men were killed on both Sides,
but yet they were always repulsed, and had not
their intended Effect. Yet the Besiegers had no
great Reason to rejoice in their Success, for being
too few to enclose the City, it was daily supplied
from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army that lay hard by. <HI>Vendosme</HI>
(the French General) understanding that it was
concerted to attack him by way of a general Sally,
and from both the Vice Roy's small Camps, re∣solved
to prevent them, and therefore leaving a
sufficient Force to secure his Works, he marched
himself with one Part of his Army, sending the
the Sieur <HI>d'Usson,</HI> with the other in the Dead of the
Night, and surprizing both the <HI>Spanish</HI> Camps,
put all to the Rout, killing many, and dronwing
many more, who endeavoured to get over the Ri∣ver
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
<HI>Lobregat,</HI> taking all their Baggage, among
which was the Vice Roy's, in it a Box with 22000
Pistoles, and 700 Horses and Mules. This Suc∣cess
encouraged the Besiegers, who sprung two
Mines under two Bastions, and lodg'd themselves
on them, though with the Loss of many Men,
and having blown up other Mines, and made a
considerable Breach, at last the Garrison capitu∣lated
to march out the 15th of <HI>August</HI> in an ho∣nourable
Manner, and be conducted to Tarragona.
It was reported that this City cost the French
12000 Men, which indeed seems incredible, but
very many died of Sickness. The Bombs thrown
in by the Fleet had destroy'd above half the Town,
but when I was there, it appeared like a flourish∣ing
City.</P>
<P>The trade at <HI>Cadiz</HI> is far more extensive than
that of any other port belonging to the Spanish mo∣narch
either in Europe, or elsewhere; the galleons
and flotilla load and unload here, when go to, or re∣turn
from the West-Indies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, from whatever I have
heard or read of it, is beyond Dispute the longest
in Extent; and, if we consider the infinite and
great Wealth of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> perhaps the very
richest in the World.</P>
<P>The Emperor of China, generally esteemed the
greatest Monarch for compass of Dominions, pos∣sesses
not above as much Land as all <HI>Europe</HI> to∣gether
makes; but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has more
than that in <HI>America</HI> alone, besides all his great
Dominions in <HI>Europe,</HI> and some, though not very
large, in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> yet they are such as are
of a considerable Value.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120"/>
It is well known that this Monarch has Lands
in all the four Parts of the World, and therefore
the Spaniards say the Sun never Sets upon his
Dominions. They are too large to be describ'd by
me who here only give the Reader a view of them
in the Names of the several Countries with the
Arch-bishopricks, Bishopricks, and Universities,
in them together with the Number of Towns as
near as Authors have been able to compute, and
some Hints of Revenues which are as follows.</P>
<P>In Spain twelve Kingdoms, or large Provinces,
which are Castile, Leon, Aragon, Navarre, Ca¦talonia,
Galicia, Valencia, Murcia, Biscay, Gra∣nada,
Andaluzia, and Estremadura, wherein there
are sixteen Thousand seven Hundred Towns, ele∣ven
Arch-bishopricks, and forty-seven Bishopricks,
and fourteen Universities, the Revenues of the
Crown out of only these Provinces here mentioned,
amount to above thirty-six Millions of Ducats
yearly. The Income of the abovemention'd Arch∣bishopricks
is near nineteen Million of ducats.</P>
<P>The prebendaries, parishes, and other ecclesiastical
benifices, are worth as much more.</P>
<P>There are nine thousand monasteries, and in them
near eighty thousand religious persons.</P>
<P>The estates of the dukes that are grandees of <HI>Spain</HI>
are worth near two millions of ducats per annnm, and
some say a good deal more.</P>
<P>Those of the Marquisses that are grandees, about
one million and a half of ducats.</P>
<P>Those of the Earls grandees, upwards of four
hundred thousand ducats.</P>
<P>All these revenues are within the kingdom, without
including the vast income hoth King and Nobles yearly
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
have from the West Indies, and other parts of the
world.</P>
<P>I have heard the <HI>Spanish</HI> clergy declare, that their
most catholick, and august monarch is the richest
and most powerful prince in the universe; but we all
know this is false; however, it was not my business
to contradict the priests, for I always concurr'd with
what they said, because I was greatly carress'd, and
led a lazy life, and lived very well amongst them dur∣ing
my stay.</P>
<P>In Africa, on the Coast of Mazelquivir, the
King of Spain has Oran, Penon, Melillae and
Ceuta. The Canary Islands being seven in Num∣ber,
called Lancarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Ca∣naria,
Tenrife, Gomera, Falma, and Hierro.</P>
<P>In Asia he has the Philipine Islands, which with
others between them and New Spain, are possessed
by the Spaniards are above two Hundred, but the
chiefest of them all is Lucon, which though not
broad is above two Hundred Leagues in length,
on it is built a good City called Manila, upon a
noble River, at the Mouth of which is a strong
Fortress, and on the other Side the River an indif∣ferent
Town. All these Islands produce Gold,
Cinnamon and other rich Commodities.</P>
<P>In America, he is Master of so many Islands on
the North Sea, that the Number was never yet
known. Those call'd Kecayes, are many and large,
those of St. John de Puerto Rico, about eighty
Leagues in Length, and twenty in Breadth, Cuba
three Hundred Leagues in Length, and twenty
in Breadth, Hispaniola above five Hundred
Leagues in Compass.</P>
<P>The Continent of America, is divided into two
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
Peninsulas, link'd together by a small Neck of
Land, but eighteen Leagues over.</P>
<P>The Northern Peninsula is called New Spain,
and the Southern Peru.</P>
<P>The Southern Peninsula, which is all encom∣passed
with the Sea, except where the Isthmus joins
it it to the Continent, and here are many very rich
Provinces.</P>
<P>In these Western Countries there are six Arch∣bishopricks
and thirty-one Bishopricks; but as I
intend to have done with this Subject, I shall pro∣ceed
to my own History, until I land myself once
more in my native Country.</P>
<P>My good Friend, Mr. Mannock, having sent
for me, told me, he had agreed for my Passage
Home, and that I must go on board in the Even∣ing,
for the Ship would sail the next Morning for
England: Whereupon I humbly thank'd him for
all Favours, and took my last Farewell of him,
highly overjoy'd at the Thoughts of my returning
one more to my native Country. But as I passed
through the City Gates with a full Intent to go on
Board, I unhappily met a Courtezan, a quandom
Acquaintace, with whom I stay'd all Night, but the
next Morning when I came down to the Mould, I
found to my equal Sorrow and Surprize, the Ship
was sail'd; whereupon I was so enrag'd at this fatal
Disappointment occasioned entirely by my own
Folly, that I almost resolved to put a Period to
my wretched Life, and now being no longer able
to stay at Cadiz, for fear of being seen by my in∣jured
Friend, I took Boat and went over to Fort
St. Mary, and from thence to St. Lucar, where I
had heard, that one Mr. Brown, a wealty Merchant
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
resided whose Sister had been married to my Un∣cle
Sir <HI>Roger Langley.</HI> Here I had the Honour
to dine with this Gentleman, who made me a
a Present of two Doubloons, and advised me to
return Home. Whereupon, lodging at the House
of one Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who kept an Ordinary for the
Masters of Vessels, I fortunately became ac∣quainted
with Captain <HI>Whitaker,</HI> bound for <HI>Cowes</HI>
and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> with this Gentleman I came Home,
landed at <HI>Limington,</HI> and from thence made the
best of my Way to <HI>London,</HI> where finding that
my Creditors had received 10 s. in the Pound in
my long Absence, I was in Hopes of receiving
the sum stipulated by Parliament for Bankrupts,
and thereby reinstating myself in some settled Bu∣siness
with my Wife. Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> her Father being
dead in my Absence, and all the Differences now
now seemingly thereby to be appeased, whereupon
I waited on my Mother-in-law, and to her made
Proposals of sending for my Wife to Town, which
she agreed to, but through her avaritious Temper,
refused to assist me with Money to enable me to
advance myself once more in Trade, and recover my
Right from the Statute, and to obtain my Certifi∣cate
from the Creditors. Whereupon finding my
good Designs rend'red impracticable, I gave a
Loose to false Pleasure, leading a loose and extra∣vagant
Lise, until I had almost exhausted all my
slender Gains, as likewise a small Legacy that was
lest me by my Cousin <HI>Brent.</HI> Wherefore I now
resolv'd once more to range abroad in Search of
new Adventures, and accidentally coming ac∣quainted
with one Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> a young Spark of as
desperate a Fortune as my own, with him I pro∣posed
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
to make a Tour to <HI>Paris</HI>; in order where∣unto
we travelled by Land to <HI>Dover,</HI> but on our
Arrival there, we were unhappily disappointed in
our intended Progress, by an Embargo laid on the
Shipping in that Port.</P>
<P>Where on our Return Home, Money being
low, we stopp'd <HI>John Springate</HI> of <HI>Feversham,</HI>
within Sight of the Turnpike at <HI>Harble Down,</HI> but
upon rifling his Pockets, and finding no more
than three Farthings therein, not thinking so
inconsiderable a sum worthy our Acceptance,
we return'd him the same, and civilly dismissed
him.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>An Account of our being appre∣hended,
and Commitment to
Maidstone Gaol for this Robbery.</HEAD>
<P>THE same Day we committed this Robbery,
both of us were taken by a Hue and Cry,
raised by the Country, and after being reviled
by those who were set as a Guard over us, we were
carried before a neighbouring Justice of the Peace,
where poor <HI>Springate</HI> appeared more terrified than
we were.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125"/>
As to my Part, I did not care what became
of me, for my Life had already been miserable
enough; but my unfortunate <HI>Fellowman,</HI> (which
is generally used by those who engage in bad
Courses) or I may say, more properly, <HI>Brother
Thief</HI>) knew not the Consequence of this Affair,
nor did he seem more affected than a poor Country
Fellow that had robb'd a Hen-Roost: I bid him be
quiet and easy, and keep up his Countenance, for
I was conscious we had committed the Robbery,
and, if the Man swore to our Persons, we must
stand committed to the County Gaol.</P>
<P>After we had tarried near an Hour in the Apart∣ment
where the Justice hears Affairs of this kind,
in came his worship with his bouncing Belly, at∣tended
by the Constable, Headborough, and Ty∣thingmen,
who all of them seem'd to be pleased
with the Reward of 80 <HI>l.</HI> that they should have
for hanging us, and quarrelled in the Hall, even
before the Magistrate was seated, who was entitled
to the greatest Share.</P>
<P>After Silence was demanded in the Hall, <HI>Alli∣bone</HI>
the Constable, who had Charge of us, was
commanded to bring us forward to the Place of
Audience. Both of us had our Hands tied behind
us, at that Time; but his Worship was so humane
as to order us to be untied, which was done in an
Instant.</P>
<P>Whilst we tarried for a Hearing, the Justice had
Notice brought him by a Livery Servant, that Sir
<HI>Thomas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s,</HI> had called to pay him a Visit, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
to take a Dinner with him.—His Worship de∣parted,
but returned again presently, on purpose
to dispatch us one way or other.—I had forgot to
mention, that poor <HI>Hill,</HI> whilst we were together
in the Hall, whisper'd me, and said, <HI>why</HI> Gill,
<HI>this is only a Bridewell Job,</HI> tell me?—I shook my
Head, and told him, I was afraid it was much
worse;—at which he appear'd to be quite dispirit∣ed,
and very sorrowful.</P>
<P>Our Examination before the Justice was but
very short; <HI>Springate</HI> was called, and ask'd if he
knew either of us, and was cautioned to be posi∣tive
to what he swore.</P>
<P>He told the Justice that we had robb'd him, but
he believed it was only <HI>in Fun,</HI> (that it is in a
merry Way) for that he had got his Three Far∣things
returned him again.</P>
<P>However, some of the Country Fellows per∣suaded
him to swear that he was put in sear of his
Life; and told him, that if he did not, we should
ruin him for ever;—so the poor Fellow very
justly swore it; we did order him to deliver; and
swore we wou'd either have his Money or his Life.
From my Heart, I don't believe the Man would
have troubled himself about us, had he not been
spirited on by his clownish Acquaintance, (I mean
our Pursuers and Apprehenders) who wanted us
hanged for the sake of the Reward, which was
sorry Pounds sor each of us.</P>
<P>On the Man's positive affidavit, the Justice soon
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
ordered his Footman to write our <HI>Mittimus</HI> to the
County Goal, where we were convey'd by a strong Possee,
being mounted on Horseback, with our Legs chained
under the Horse's Belly, and guarded by thirty Coun∣try
Loobies, the Constable who had the Commitment,
riding first with his long Staff, pitched on his Boot,
exactly representing an Officer guarding a poer Cri∣minal
to the Place of Execution.</P>
<P>At this Time the Country being pestered with Smug∣glers,
and as we passed on to <HI>Maidstone,</HI> every Body
imagined we were some of that Gang that were re∣ported
to be taken in <HI>Sussex,</HI> which caus'd Numbers
of People, both on Horseback and on Foot to follow
us into <HI>Maidstone</HI> Town. I never in my Life suf∣fered
so great a Punishment as the Fatigue of this
Journey from the Justice's to Prison; it being ex∣cessive
hot Weather, and in the Month of <HI>August,</HI>
I could not persuade my Guard to stop for a little
Refreshment, the Constable pretending he apprehended a
Rescue was intended by the Smugglers.</P>
<P>When we approached near the Entrance of <HI>Maid∣stone</HI>
Town, there appeared to me to be as many Peo∣ple
as were generally at <HI>Newgate</HI> to see the poor Cri∣minals
go forth to Execution.</P>
<P>As I went into the Goal I thought to myself, <HI>Poor</HI>
Gill, <HI>here you have cast you last Stone</HI>! My Friend
<HI>Hill, napp'd his Bibb</HI> (a cant Term for Weeping)
and said he was ruin'd. I told him, <HI>I hop'd not,</HI>
<HI>but I was afraid we were undone (Body and Breeches)
'till next Month</HI>; meaning the time we were to be
try'd.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128"/>
No sooner were we un-hors'd, but the <HI>cunning</HI>
Constable deliver'd his Commitment o the Turnkey,
who was a <HI>funny Dog</HI>; and on looking at it, re∣turn'd
it to the Constable, telling him he had no Bu∣siness
with <HI>Three Farthing Chaps,</HI> and that he must
take us to the Place from whence we came. The silly
Constable star'd; and the Turnkey snatching the
Commitment from him again, ordered us (Prisoners)
both to walk forward into the Lodge, which
we, with sorrowful Hearts, were oblig'd to comply
with.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding I was under these unhappy Cir∣cumstances,
nothing diverted more than the Pastime
between the Constable, his Attendants and the Turn∣key,
who told him, <HI>As we were the first two Pri∣soners
he had ever brought thither, he should ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
for his two Bottles of Wine</HI>; and, said he, <HI>Mr.
Constable, if you don't, I'll kick your men out
again.</HI> The <HI>Silly Oaf</HI> laugh'd, and ordered the
Wine immediately, which was not deliver'd before
be tipp'd 'em the Ready-Pull-Out; and what was
very merry, it went round so fast, that before it came
to the Constable's Turn, he ne'er tasted one Drop; but
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon after more was called for, that the Constable drank
so freely that he was <HI>Top-Heavy (meaning he had it
in his Nob)</HI> and dropp'd the Receipt which the Turn∣key
had given him as a Discharge for his Delivering
us to the Keeper of the County Goal of <HI>Kent</HI>; for
the Return of which he paid another Bottle; and,
after drinking a Glass or two, went away, but soon
return'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd demanded the Horse Locks that <HI>Hill</HI>
and I were chained with. The Turnkey told him, it
was very well and when we were unlock'd he should,
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
have them if he did not go out of Town before; but
if he did, he should receive them by a Penny Post
Letter. The Silly Cull went off full of <HI>Booze,</HI> and
I remained there full of <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner was the constable and his assistants de∣parted
but my poor c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfederate <HI>Hill</HI> and I were called
before the head turnkey; when we appeared, he, <HI>Cer∣berus</HI>
like, ordered us <HI>to come to Book.</HI> I put on a
very dejected and sorrowful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>untenance, and told
him neither I nor my companion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e sowse to save
us from perdition. He then ordered us to sit down
at a table, where he, like <HI>Radamanthus</HI> the Judge
of Hell, sat to determine complaints amongst the pri∣soners.</P>
<P>We had not been long seated before he call'd out to
a fellow who wos one of the jiggers, or understrappers
belonging to the goal, and the fellow immediately ap∣pearing
before him, made a low bow, and desired to
know his pleasure. Here, <HI>Bob,</HI> said the turnkey,
(pointing to me) that gentleman has a good upper∣shell,
and desires to borrow a trifle on it.</P>
<P>At this expression I stared like a conjurer, well
knowing that my <HI>Upper-Shell,</HI> was my great coat;
but, however, I had no remedy but patience, being
obliged to comply with this villainous demand; and so
I was immediately obliged to strip, not so much ro∣garding
the loss of my coat, as the tyranny and op∣pression
of these sort of fellows, who always make
the best market they can of the unfortunate persons
that are committed to their care.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>
Finding myself stript, I look'd on poor <HI>Hill</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a pitiful Aspect, and <HI>Hill</HI> (shaking his empty
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pitied my Condition, and said he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
afrai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would serve him in the same Manner;
I told him he was in no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anger of that, for his
Coat was not worth one Shilling; but tho' I was
mist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n in the <HI>Stripping Lay,</HI> they play'd off a
new Game with my Friend, as will appear in the
Sequel.</P>
<P>But, to return to my Story: In about half an
Hour returns the Fellow, seemingly very joyous,
running to me in a great Hurry, and putting three
Shillings into my Hand, told me that was all he
could borrow on my Coat; and, D<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>mn me (said
he) I believe I have buk'd my <HI>Grandmother</HI> (mean∣ing
the Pawnbroker) for your poor <HI>Joseph</HI> was not
worth half an Ounce;—and at the same Time
shaking me by the Fist, said he, Friend, I believe
your'e a <HI>Cock.</HI> I was under a Necessity of pocketing
the Insolence of this Rascal, and was glad to get
rid of his Impertinence and Stupidity, considering
such Fellows as he were the only Persons that
could relieve me under my present unhappy Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Hill</HI> (who now look'd as cunning as a dead
Pig) ask'd me what I intended to do with the Mo∣ney?
I answer'd him, You'll soon see an end of it:
—And just as I was speaking, up stept the Turn∣key,
who had then just left Company, and accosted
me in this Manner:—'Well, Friend, I suppose
my Man has been with you to bring you the
Money on your Coat? I told him he had brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
me three Shillings in Silver, which I had in my
'Pocket.'—Ay, (reply'd he) D<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>mn these
Thieves of Pawnbrokers, they'll not lend any
Thing on a Garment unless it is very good; and
as yours was Threadbare, I think <HI>Bob</HI> has
<HI>flung</HI> 'em, for he's a funny Dog, and a special
Customer to the House; and he often <HI>gigs</HI> it
with the old Dutchess.'—On this the Turnkey
was called out to take Charge of another Prisoner,
and I was glad he was gone, fearing he wanted my
little Cole, having only that to support me.</P>
<P>Newgate now came fresh into my Memory, but
recommend me to that Prison (terrible as the Name
is) for Humanity; for being a Prisoner there for
Debt a considerable Time, I could perceive how
the Felons were used by the under Keepers, and
even the Master of the Gaol himself, who at that
Time was Rowland Ingram, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who would
come into the Common Felons Ward, and hear
Complaints against the Jiggers or Runners, if
they had beat or injured any one.</P>
<P>Our Turnkey of <HI>Maidstone</HI> was a civil Fellow
enough, especially to those who had the Cash, and
of the three Shillings I had, he was so civil as to
accept only of half a Crown; and when he got
near my <HI>All,</HI> he desired one of the Followers to
put on our Darbies.—This Scene, which I never
had yet been accustom'd to, gave me the greatest
Uneasiness; but to do Justice to my worthy Friend,
the Turnkey, he order'd me only a fingle Link
and one Basil, which is the Iron Ring that goes
round the Leg.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132"/>
When I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brig,</HI> with my
Irons on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Block, to be
likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a slout Fellow,
tho' a <HI>poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I may more pro∣perly
call him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeper, ordered him to
be double iron'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I thought was a very
great Hardship.</P>
<P>I expostulated all in my power with these merce∣nary
mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reants, and begg'd on my knees, that they
would not use him unkind, because we were far from
our friends. This however, had no effect, till the
Fellow who brings the setters, perceiving my friend
wore a good pair of buckskin breeches, he desired
him te exchange them for a pair that would fit him
better.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> finding himself under a Necessity of
parting with them, made no words, but imme∣diately
withdrew, and gave them to the Villain,
who in return, furnished him with an old Pair
of Sheepskin, big enough for a Colossus; his
Breeches were worth at least three Crowns, and
those he had in return only sit for the Rag
Shed.</P>
<P>However, this Condescension was the only Rea∣son
that he was not double setter'd; and a ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
single Iron being put on his Left Leg, we were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth conducted to our silthy Apartment.</P>
<P>In this Place were three Felons for petty Crimes,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o had been committed since the last Assizes, one
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f whom was ill of the Small-pox. That Night
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
we rested as well as we could on the bare Board<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and, considering our unhappy Condition, slep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sound, occasioned, no doubt, by the Fatigue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
our Journey the Day before.</P>
<P>In the Morning at the Time of unlocking our
ward, I ask'd the Turnkey, if I could be admitted
to write a Line or two to a Friend in London, for
a little Subsistance. He told me I was welcome,
provided I was furnish'd with Pen, Ink, and Pa∣per;
but that not being in my Power to obtain for
want of Cash, to supply the Urgency, I was oblig'd
to sell my Shirt, which setch'd me one and twenty
Pence▪</P>
<P>That Day I wrote to my good Friend Mr.
<HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> informing him of my terrible Condition;
but whether he ever received the Letter I know
not, no Answer being ever returned, which was
a very shocking Disappointment to me. I really
believe the Hussy that I entrusted to carry it to the
Post House, sunk the Two-pence I gave her;
the week after the Mother of a Fellow Prisoner,
who daily visited her Son, was so kind to carry a
Letter for me, which I had wrote to a woman I
formerly kept Company with near St. Martin's in
the Fields.</P>
<P>This Letter was received, but not by the Party
it was directed to, she having been married some
Time before; but her Sister, lodging in the same
House, luckily took it from the Postman, and
opening it, read the Contents, which she gene∣rously
communicated to her Sister; which last
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
Lady was so kind as to remit me a 27 <HI>s.</HI> Piece by
the Maidstone Carrier, who fafely deliver'd it,
inclosed in a Letter, into my own Hands.</P>
<P>I would have paid the Carrier, but he refused to
accept of a Farthing, saying that he scorned to
take any thing from a poor Prisoner; for this
generous action I return'd him my hearty Thanks,
which he freely accepted of for his Trouble, and
call'd for two Mugs of Ale to treat my unfortunate
Companion and myself.</P>
<P>Soon as the honest Man was gone I perused
the Contents of the Letter, which contain'd some
Reflections on my former Folly, and the bad
Usage she had received from me, tho' the Direc∣tion
of her Epistle was no ways intended to affront
me under my unhappy Calamity. I confess I wept
heartily; and the next Day I wrote her an Answer,
which was sent to a place by her own direction;
by her own Desire; but I never received any
Return, or ever heard from her again, which I was
heartily sorry for, considering my terrible Mis∣fortune.</P>
<P>I lived, whilst under my unhappy confinement,
pretty tolerable, srequently doing little services for
my sellow prisoners, in writing petitions and
letters to their relations, by which I gained their
good-will, and the esteem of all those belonging
to the prison:</P>
<P>The day the Judges came into <HI>Rochester,</HI> to
open their commission for holding the Assizes, a
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
gentleman came to the gaol, and presenting me
with a guinea, delivered me the following letter;
which was directed thus:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To Mr. G. Langley, a Prisoner in Maidstone Gaol,
in the County of Kent.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My old Acquaintance,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am surprised to hear that you are in confinement
for so great an offence: I wave all reflections,
for I scorn to insult the unfortunate. I took this op∣portunity
of sending this piece of gold by a gentle∣man
who was obliged to attend the assizes; and I
wish you a safe deliverance with all my soul; I in∣tended
to be more liberal, but my follies have brought
me almost to beggary, being abandoned by my wife,
and despised by my parents.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Friend, Z.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The assizes for the Home Circuit being appoint∣ed
to be held at Rochester for the county of
Kent, we were removed thither, with a great ma∣ny
other criminals, to take our Trials for the felo∣ny
we stood committed for.</P>
<P>It was reported, that other indictments would
be preferr'd against me for robberies on the
highway; but I declare the fact I was charg'd with
was the only one of that kind that I ever was con∣cerned
in.</P>
<P>On the 20th of March, 1739, the Assizes on
the crown side began, before the hon. Sir John
Fortescue Aland, one of the justices of his Ma∣jesty's
court of Common Pleas; and being both
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> raigned, and pleading Not Guilty, we were the
next Day tried and convicted, and received judg∣ment
of death; but the judge was pleased to re∣prieve
us for transportation.</P>
<P>Under this sentence these pages were written. May
all young men read them with a proper disposition to
avoid by my example the miserable state I have brought
myself to. A state too frightsul to describe, and the
very Thoughts of which stops the pen. Yet a state
to which Numbers are running, as full of mirth and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nad joy, as if their fools paradise was a real one.
The royal mercy hath saved me from an ignominious
death, and I humbly trust in GOD, that he will
give me his grace to amend my conduct, and by a tho∣rough
and sincere repentance save me from death ever∣lasting</P>
