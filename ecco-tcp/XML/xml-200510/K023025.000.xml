<HEAD>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T will be found a true observation,
tho' somewhat surprizing, that
when any scandal is vented against
a man of the highest distinction and
character either in the State or in
Literature, the publick in general afford it a
most quiet reception, and the larger part accept it
as favourably as if it were some kindness done to
themselves: Whereas if a known scoundrel or
blockhead chance to be but touch'd upon, a whole
legion is up in Arms, and it becomes the common
Cause of all Scriblers, Booksellers, and Printers
whatsoever.</P>
<P>Not to search too deeply into the reason hereof, I
will only observe as a <HI>Fact,</HI> that every week for
these two Months past, the town has been perse∣cuted
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
with Pamphlets, Advertisements, Letters,
and weekly Essays, not only against the Wit and
Writings, but against the Character and Person,
of Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> And that of all those men who have
received pleasure from his Writings (which by
modest computation may be about a hundred
thousand in these Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
not to mention <HI>Jerscy, Guernsey,</HI> the
<HI>Orcades,</HI> those in the <HI>New world,</HI> and <HI>Foreign∣ers</HI>
who have translated him into their languages)
of all this number, not a man hath stood up to
say one word in his defence.</P>
<P>The only exception is the Author of the follow∣ing
Poem, who doubtless had either a better in∣sight
into the grounds of this clamour, or a bet∣ter
opinion of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s integrity, join'd with
a greater personal love for him, than any other
of his numerous friends and admirers.</P>
<P>Further, that he was in his peculiar intima∣cy,
appears from the knowledge he manifests of
the most <HI>private</HI> Authors of all the <HI>anonymous</HI>
pieces against him, and from his having in this
Poem attacked no man living, who had not be∣fore
printed and published against this particular
Gentleman.</P>
<P>How I became possest of it, is of no concern to
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
the Reader; but it would have been a wrong to
him, had I detain'd this publication: since those
<HI>Names</HI> which are its chief ornaments, die off dai∣ly
so fast, as must render it too soon unintelligible.
If it provoke the Author to give us a more per∣fect
edition, I have my end.</P>
<P>Who he is, I cannot say, and (which is great
pity) there is certainly nothing in his style and
manner of writing, which can distinguish, or
discover him. For if it bears any resemblance
to that of Mr. <HI>P.</HI> 'tis not improbable but it
might be done on purpose, with a view to have
it pass for his. But by the frequency of his
allusions to <HI>Virgil,</HI> and a <HI>labour'd,</HI> (not to say
<HI>affected, shortness,</HI> in imitation of him, I should
think him more an admirer of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet
than of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and in that, not of the
same taste with his Friend.</P>
<P>I have been well inform'd, that this work
was the labour of full six years of his life, and
that he retired himself entirely from all the
avocations and pleasures of the world, to attend
diligently to its correction and perfection; and
six years more he intended to bestow upon it, as
it should seem by this verse of <HI>Statius,</HI> which
was cited at the head of his manuscript.
<Q><PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
<L>Oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos,</L>
<L>Duncia!—</L></Q></P>
<P>Hence also we learn the true <HI>Title</HI> of the
Poem; which with the same certainty as we
call that of <HI>Homer</HI> the <HI>Iliad,</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> the
<HI>Aeneid,</HI> of <HI>Camoens</HI> the <HI>Lusiad,</HI> of <HI>Voltaire</HI>
the <HI>Henriad,</HI> we may pronounce could have
been, and can be no other, than<Q>THE DUNCIAD.</Q></P>
<P>It is styled <HI>Heroic,</HI> as being <HI>doubly</HI> so;
not only with respect to its nature, which ac∣cording
to the best Rules of the Ancients and
strictest ideas of the Moderns, is critically such;
but also with regard to the Heroical disposition
and high courage of the Writer, who dar'd
to stir up such a formidable, irritable, and
implacable race of mortals.</P>
<P>The time and date of the Action is evident∣ly
in the last reign, when the office of City
Poet expir'd upon the death of <HI>Elkanah Set∣tle,</HI>
and he has fix'd it to the Mayoralty of
Sir <HI>Geo. Tho<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ld.</HI> But there may arise
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
some obscurity in Chronology from the <HI>Names</HI>
in the Poem, by the inevitable removal of
some Authors, and Insertion of others, in their
Niches. For whoever will consider the unity
of the whole design, will be sensible, that the
<HI>Poem was not made for these Authors, but
these Authors for the Poem.</HI> And I should
judge they were clapp'd in as they rose, fresh
and fresh, and chang'd from day to day, in
like manner as when the old boughs wither,
we thrust new ones into a chimney.</P>
<P>I would not have the reader too much trou∣bled
or anxious, if he cannot decypher them;
since when he shall have found them out, he
will probably know no more of the Persons
than before.</P>
<P>Yet we judg'd it better to preserve them as
they are, than to change them for fictitious
names, by which the Satyr would only be mul∣tiplied;
and applied to many instead of one.
Had the Hero, for instance, been called <HI>Co∣drus,</HI>
how many would have affirm'd him to
be Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Sir <HI>R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI>
&amp;c. but now, all that unjust scandal is saved,
by calling him <HI>Theobald,</HI> which by good luck
happens to be the name of a real person.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
I am indeed aware, that this name may
to some appear too mean, for the Hero of an
Epic Poem? But it is hoped, they will alter
that opinion, when they find, that an Author
no less eminent than <HI>la Bruyere,</HI> has thought
him worthy a place in his Characters.<Q><P>Voudriez vous, THEOBALDE, que je
crusse que vous êtes baisse? que vous n'êtes
