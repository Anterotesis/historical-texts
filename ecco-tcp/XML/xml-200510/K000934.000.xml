</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GENERAL GAGE's Proclamation lies before
me, though it is not a subject for criticism, yet
it deserves notice; we may overlook the style, but
must detest the doctrine; with what judgment the
General may command, with what spirit he
may fight, with what prudence he may retreat, is
yet unknown; but if his conduct in the field is
equal to his composition in the closet, the success
of his majesty's arms must be owing more to fate
than judgment. This murderous proclamation
opens with great solemnity, bold assertions, and
notorious falsehoods; it proceeds with the perse∣vering
spirit of the times; but, alas! its imperious
offers of clemency, and its conceited menaces,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
are vain alike. The one will make no converts
for want of confidence; and the other can make
no cowards for want of power. To subjugate
America entirely, by means of our fleet and
standing army, is impossible; the thought only
proves that administration is as weak as it is wick∣ed;
should they be determined, like their mis∣guided
master, to persevere, they will, ere long,
find it impracticable either to go forward, or to
retreat; they will (let them mark the words of an
unknown writer) oblige the people, throughout
the empire of Great Britain, to take the power
again into their own hands; even anarchy is pre∣ferable
to despotism, especially while the govern∣ment
is in the hands of fools, madmen, knaves,
and tyrants; hard usage justifies hard names.—Let
us now proceed to this alluring proclamation, this
flimsy, political trap for antiquated Roman vir∣tue.</P>
<P>The General thought fit to arraign the conduct
of the Americans as incendiaries and traitors
against the constitutional authority of the state; if
the word incendiary has any meaning in the Eng∣lish
language, it can only be applied with propriety
to one who is the first kindler of commotions in a
state; according to our constitution, the very head
that wears the crown may be an incendiary, by
encouraging a faction, which may as well originate
in the court as in the cottage, if the King and his
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Parliament, devoted to a vile administration, com∣bine
to persevere in carrying any one point against
the constitution, they are from that moment a fac∣tion
(incendiaries) and not a government; they
are traitors, traitors to the people. Let me now
ask, whether faction first took rise in America, or
the mother country? In that spot (wherever it
may be) we must look for these incendiaries and
traitors. I have put the question fairly; it is simple,
plain, and determinative.—I pause for a reply—
not from the mouth of a haughty pensioner, a
Scotch placeman, or a fawning courtier; but by
the decision of a true constitutionalist I am willing
to abide. In the interim, I shall declare my own
opinion—That the mother country, represented
as she is by a corrupt majority, first formed a fac∣tion
herself against the laws and liberties of Ame∣rica;
nay, she has done more, she has artfully
formed even a religious faction (the worst of all
others) upon that great continent. Her govern∣ment
has of late been administered upon such mis∣taken,
narrow, rotten principles, that she did not
think herself secure till she had established Popery
by act of Parliament at Quebec, by way of fo∣menting
dissentions and enmity in those dominions
she would enslave, or administration knew and
feared the principles of the people upon that con∣tinent.
They had read that their ancestors were
Puritans, and no friends to tyranny or popery;
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
they knew their designs, and planted Papists in
their rear to keep their rebellious subjects, as they
call them, between two fires, and to deter them
from taking refuge in the back settlements; but
they have numbers and virtue sufficient to enable
them to keep, or at least to recover their ground.
Thus have a corrupt majority, falsely called the
Great Council of the Nation, themselves departed,
and encouraged Government to depart, in this as
well as numberless other instances, from the line
of right laid down at the Revolution, a period but
little reverenced by our State-pilots, Bute and
Mansfield; these two men, with their lacqueys in
and out of Parliament, are the real and only incen∣diaries
of America. The wretched Americans,
unjustly branded by every hireling with the name
of traitors, are only busied, and justly busied, in
extinguishing those flames, which such a govern∣ment
(if it deserves the name of one) has kindled;
whether the Americans are traitors, or unhappy
subjects making a lawful resistance to repeated
tyrannies, must be determined, not by hirelings,
who assassinate for pay, but by those who pay
them with reluctance, by the collective body of
the people, in whom all power virtually resides,
from whom it originates, and to whom it must
perhaps shortly dissolve again. What the General
calls treason, this collective body (an awful tri∣bunal)
will pronounce constitutional resistance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The Americans are next accused of a fatal pro∣gression
of crimes against the constitutional autho∣rity
of the state.—By the term constitutional, if the
General means an authority constitutionally exer∣cised,
I deny his assertion; it is as little founded
on truth, as our ministerial measures are upon
sound policy, justice and humanity; when the
principles of the constitution are abandoned (as
they have lately been) the state may proceed au∣thoritively,
or rather despotically, but it cannot
be said to act constitutionally.—That the Ameri∣cans
avow rebellion, I deny likewise; that they
avow resistance (as their brave ancestors once did,
and as all true Revolutionists will do) every Bri∣ton,
as an enemy to slavery, must rejoice.</P>
<P>For the patience and lenity of the King's (in
truth of Lord Bute's and Lord Mansfield's) go∣vernment,
I appeal to facts. Those, who are
masters of the disputes between England and Ame∣rica,
and stand unbiassed by corruption, will pass
an impartial judgment between the oppressors and
oppressed; we doubt not but the Sovereign's pa∣tience
is equal to his other godlike attributes; but
we know that the patience of America has been
severely tried; among other invasions she has been
stripped of the most valuable privilege, the birth∣right
of a British subject, trial by juries. In many
other instances government has attempted to en∣slave
them; and shall the aggressors presume to
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
boast thus of their patience and lenity? At what time,
in what particulars, were they exerted? Were the
humble supplications and remonstrances of Ame∣rica
received by either, and by which of the three
great estates of this kingdom? If so, a Norton
and Apsley, or some ministerial paricide, can in∣form
us; but if they were (and they really were)
rejected with contempt by all, what pretence, what
effrontery have the tools and sycophants of power,
to insult the understandings of mankind with
sounds? What hopes (for such the General talks
of) could America ever entertain of such an Ad∣ministration,
such a Parliament, and such a Sove∣reign?
She has, alas! been driven to despair by
all; nay, her supplications have been finally an∣swered
by those divine effects of patience and
lenity—Famine and the sword. Thus have those
who are entrusted (as the General says) with su∣preme
rule, manifested to all the world, that they
bear not the sword in vain. Could George the
Third, that mirror of perseverance, that idol of
an abandoned Ministry, present the sword of jus∣tice,
like the old heathen emperor, to the people,
and bid them use it for him, or against him, ac∣cording
to his deserts? If he could, he then bears
not the sword in vain, but in defiance of heaven
and earth, in defiance of all laws human and
divine; nor can he bear it long.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
But the most sacred rights of the crown and
people of Great Britain (says the General) have
been infringed. It is a most audacious piece of
military insolence, after the late act of tyranny
assented to by the steady Sovereign, to join the
names of crown and people together, as if their
views and interest were still, as in truth they ought
to be, the same. Blind to its own interest, to its
honour, to its establishment, to its sacred engage∣ments
at the altar, has the crown, whose sole aim
is plainly despotic power, consulted the interests of
the people in its disputes with America? The rights
of the crown and people were stipulated anew at
the Revolution. But has the crown kept its com∣pact
with the people of America? If not, by whom
have the rights of the people been infringed?—As
to the rights of the crown, as stipulated at the Re∣volution,
they are well known, and have been reli∣giously
submitted to both at home and abroad,
even in rebellious America; but when it begins to
stretch out the arm of usurpation, it is time that
its despotic sinews should be shrunk.</P>
<P>That the Americans have been guilty (and
bravely guilty) of premeditation and conspiracy is
most true. They have been provoked to action,
and they were too wise to act without thinking.
They have most virtuously conspired against ty∣rants,
and disdained to wear the chains of the most
pious King, the wisest Administration, and most
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
incorrupt Parliament that Great Britain ever
knew.—For these demerits the fulness of chastise∣ment
is threatened. But suppose the chastisers
should be chastised? I have always understood
that true courage was ever accompanied by the
greatest modesty. History is full of these exam∣ples.
But our Ministry (like their Sandwich and
their Denbigh) have idly thought that America may
be subdued by gasconade. Such corrupt wretches
are strangers to the great effects of virtue. Sad
experience will inform them soon that all human
souls are not as abject as their own.</P>
<P>The Americans are next accused of an unna∣tural
revolt. If by this expression is meant a revolt
against their natural allegiance, I answer, that
when protection is first unjustly withdrawn on the
Sovereign's part, all allegiance ceases on the sub∣ject's.
The subject must then recur to the rights
of nature; resistance may ensue, but no revolt;
for the Sovereign, by breaking his compact, has
set the subject free. A politician would reason
thus; but a soldier has no idea of any mode of
government but by the sword.—We are then told
that our colonists dared not trust their cause to the
impartial judgment of the public, or even to the
dispassionate reflection of their followers.—But
with what truth? Were not the General Congresses
throughout the continent of America so many open
appeals to the judgment of an impartial public?
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Were not the flagitious prints, the popular ha∣rangues,
the declamation from the pulpits (which
the General complains of) so many incitements to
the cool, dispassionate reflection of their follow∣ers?
Indeed, General, you should always reason
sword in hand. The pen is not your fort. You
are lost upon paper, and must at last submit to be
vanquished in the field. Putnam is in earnest.</P>
<P>The poor Americans are charged in the next
place with a suppression of truth; with obstructing
every appeal to the real interest of the people;
with the grossest forgeries, calumnies, and absur∣dities.
To say that the Americans have been
guilty of suppressing truth, forging falsehoods,
venting calumnies, and imposing absurdities upon
their party, is but a kind of petulant recrimination.
These dishonourable proceedings, if true, are but
the common stratagems of war. They are not pe∣culiar
to one side only, for the King's party has
practised them; all the insidious spies of Go∣vernment
have practised them; General Carle∣ton
has practised them most basely; you your∣self,
General Gage, have practised them as dis∣honourably;
but after all, is this malicious
splenetic recrimination a proof of treason and
rebellion against these injured people? In spite
of all this foul language, the world will think
that there is as much veracity, virtue, candour,
honour, and true courage on the part of free∣men
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
who defend, as on the part of tyrants who
invade their liberties. I now wish to be in∣formed
of these appeals which have been made
(if the General says true) to the real interest of
America.</P>
<P>Through what channels have they passed? Have
either of the three great estates of this kingdom,
or has the Minister, or even a single tool or lac∣quey
of Administration, has a North, a Sandwich,
or a Denbigh, once condescended to advise, ad∣monish,
or expostulate with America? Has the
Secretary of State for that department ever had
orders to write in such a strain? Have not all
Lord Bute's servile clan endeavoured, on the con∣trary,
to carry every thing with a high hand, and
a menacing audacious front? Have they not shut
their eyes, ears and hearts, against every humble
approach, every filial intercession of America?
These insolent invaders of royal charters, human
rights, and established laws, have been too much
slushed with the hopes of conquest, to wish cor∣dially
for a reconciliation with America. They
have industriously stopped up every opening to∣wards
it. The mouths of our patriots and our
citizens have been stopped by corrupt votes and
majestic insults; as to the proposal made by Lord
North in his House of Commons, it was calcu∣lated
for the contempt it met with. His Lordship
was not quite fool enough to think it could take
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
place. By whom then has any appeal to the real
interest of America been made by those who would
exterminate the people?</P>
<P>The prostitution of the press makes the next
item in the General's catalogue of complaints. If
the American press has been prostituted, I pray
that Doctor Johnson may be called upon to declare,
upon the honour of a court-pensioner, how glori∣ously
the English press has been employed in the
cause of truth by his brother Garreteers; even the
eloquence of the laity and clergy has been exerted
(says the General) to excite and justify devastation
and massacre. Can a soldier, who should be a
man of honour, assert so gross a falsehood? It is
notorious that no one popular harangue, as the
General calls them, has been made in America,
with any other view than that of animating their
gallant countrymen to a just defence of their liber∣ties,
properties, and lives; the noblest purpose of
which the distinguished gift of the speech can serve.
That the brave and virtuous Americans have
animated each other in support of their national
rights, will be recorded in history to their immor∣tal
honour; that our perfidious government has
armed the Papists, whom they patronize at Que∣bec,
with a view of destroying their Protestant
subjects, is a circumstance which will make a
figure of a different cast in history, and will most
assuredly bring the advisers of that measure to an
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
ignominious death, in spite of the standing army
employed and paid at present for no other purpose
than that of protecting tyrants; whether popular
harangues made in one case, or arms supplied in
the other, is most characteristic of national honour
and virtue, may easily be determined. And to
this the base, the cowardly, the traiterous design of
government, after all the parade and military blus∣ter,
of surrendering Canada to the French, a vast
province acquired last war, at the expence of so
much blood and treasure. This pusillanimous
thought has been suggested to gratify a despairing
tyrant. I now accompany the General to the ac∣count
he gives of the 19th of April last, respecting
an attack upon the King's troops from behind
walls, and lurking holes. Be it so; yet who can
believe that the King's troops should have been
unprepared for ambuscade, or any acts of hostile
frenzy, as the General calls it? Have not the
Americans been driven to this frenzy? Is it not
common for an enemy to take every advantage?
Is it not uncommon, nay impossible, that troops,
charged with vengeance, should be unprepared to
take it? They could not be unprepared for taking
it, if they were armed; nor would they decline
taking it, if they were Scotchmen. Their not
taking it, therefore, must be owing either to a want
of spirit or want of conduct, or a want of power.
Since that period (of the 19th of April) says the
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
General, the rebels have derived confidence from
impunity.—Is it a matter of merit then, with a mer∣cenary
soldiery, that they did not execute what
they were unable to effect? This is talking like a
driveller, General! But these rebels, these traiter∣ous
Revolutionists in America, have dared to fire
upon the King's ships and subjects—Granted—but
have not these ships invaded them, have not these
subjects (why did you not say soldiers and marines)
threatened their destruction? Is the doctrine of
passive obedience, and non-resistance to the divine
will of tyrants, to be observed by the insulted and
enslaved Americans, till they felt their Sovereign's
bayonet in their bosoms?—These rebels have pro∣ceeded
even farther; they have affected (says our
General) to hold the King's army besieged—Have
they? May heavens prosper such a glorious piece
of affectation! Every constitutionalist throughout
the British empire hopes they will not only affect
it, but effect it: every true born Briton longs to
see the final triumph of America marked as an
epocha in the future annals of his country; nor
would their joy be checked by the appearance of
another blessed martyrdom in the calendar. Ty∣ranny
and martyrdom, like representation and tax∣ation,
should go together.</P>
<P>The charge of invasion upon private property,
and a wantonness of cruelty, is not only indecent,
but imprudent, from that mouth which commands
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
the King's banditti in America, who have so dar∣ingly
themselves invaded the liberties, the proper∣ties,
the laws and lives of a free people with the
sword, merely because they claim, and will main∣tain,
the rights of Englishmen.</P>
<P>As to the actions of the nineteenth of April last,
which so often haunt the General's mind, they
ought to stand for ever recorded in the calendar,
to the eternal honour of America, who that day
not only totally disappointed, but bravely resisted
no considerable party of the King's military assas∣sins.
If any improprieties were committed on that
nineteenth of April by the American troops, which
cannot easily be pardoned by so consummate a sol∣dier
as General Gage; yet their gallant behaviour
on the seventeenth of June following must surely
have deserved his admiration. They did not fire
then from behind walls and lurking holes, but
bravely faced, attacked and defeated the tyrant's
forces. This appears sufficiently, even from the
letter which has been artfully imposed on the pub∣lic
for General Gage's genuine account of that
action; but let the Minister shew forth the Gene∣ral's
real letter, if he dares. His master lost his
colour when he read it; and I verily believe that
even Lord North (the ostensible Minister) is not
himself entrusted with the true contents of it. His
Lordship is but the drudge. He has the name
without the confidence of a Minister, and meanly
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
submits to be responsible for iniquities not his own
The real genuine letter (so dreadful are its tidings)
is a secret to all but the tyrant, and his gemini,
the Castor and Pollux of his cabinet, Bute and
Mansfield. They dare not publish it.</P>
<P>I am now come to the last effort within the
bounds of the General's duty, to spare the effusion
of blood, which he is strictly charged to shed with∣out
mercy or reluctance. The General, according
to his orders, most dutifully dispatched his bluster∣ing
Colonel Smith to commence the intended car∣nage.
This bully failed; yet blood was unnatu∣rally
and unjustifiably drawn by our hireling cut∣throats
at Concord; and then the General, in
commiseration of the calamities which his murder∣ous
army had occasioned, most humanely offers,
two months afterwards (when he found himself un∣equal
to the task of conquest) his Majesty's most
gracious pardon to these unhappy sufferers. Your
treacherous offer is disdained—away with it!—
and massacre (if you can) but without an insult,
the bravest men in the British empire. Did not
the ancestors of these brave spirits spurn the insi∣dious
proclamation of that tyrant Charles, and
shall their sons fall a prey to the delusive orders
of a weaker tyrant, and a more consummate hypo∣crite?
—Will not the gallant Adams, and the me∣ritorious
Hancock fall with their country, if it is her
fate to fall? Or should they be unfortunately taken
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
prisoners, will they not cast an indignant smile
upon the wretch who should affect to pardon them,
after he had enslaved their country? The pro∣claiming
all America (except the King's Roman
Catholic subjects, and good allies at Quebec)
traitors, is but a contemptible echo of that act of
parliament which declared them so long since, for
consulting and preparing only against an intended
massacre by sword and famine.—America despises
your threats, your clemency, and all naval and
military terror and parade, thou impotent tyrant!
This General concludes his gasconade with a most
notorious falsehood, by asserting that the present
unnatural rebellion of the Americans (as he calls
it) has stopped the administration of justice in that
country.—For shame, for shame, General! A
soldier, and guilty of a lye (—Your master knows,
you know, the whole world knows, that the rotten
Parliament of this nation not only stopped the
course, but extinguished every benefit of the com∣mon
law (the subjects great inheritance) when they
dared take away the privilege of juries. The de∣sign
was base, atrocious, glaring, perfidious, and
tyrannical; but why does this unthinking tool of
military power call the royal charter of the pro∣vince
to his aid; that charter, which his master
and his parliamentary junto has so grossly violated?
Is that charter unfavourable to freedom, and can
it now serve the cause of slavery? Has it hitherto
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
been slighted, and is it now made use of to betray
the people for whose protection it was granted?
Has it been so often disallowed, with an indignant
sneer, when America petitioned for redress, and is
it now set up against her by the shallow tools of
power, when she is defending those rights and liber∣ties
which it gives her? Is this royal charter now
called in aid of despotic measures, through weak∣ness,
insolence, or inadvertency? Why, General!
General! Your haughty unrelenting master tram∣ples
on the royal charters of his wiser predecessors.</P>
<P>I tell thee, Homicide, that the faith of Kings
is now no more. Our very laws must shortly
truckle to the sword. The law martial which you
have just proclaimed, and of which you may shortly
taste yourself, will, if you succeed in America,
be at length the only law of England. Mansfield
is an advocate for summary proceedings.</P>
<P>The die is cast in the great divan (the wise
council of this nation) and those who would RISE
AGAIN to the STATE and LIBERTIES of
ENGLISHMEN must RISE through BLOOD.
The parricides of this constitution, General, are
to be found in England, NOT IN AMERICA,
nor can HAPPINESS, PEACE, LIBERTY,
and LAW, be now restored (unless Providence
miraculously intervenes) but by ANOTHER
REVOLUTION.</P>

<P>THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S
SOULS. The summer soldier and the sun-shine
patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service
of his country: but he that stands it <HI>now,</HI> deserves
the thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like
hell, is not easily conquered: yet we have this
consolation with us, that the harder the conflict,
the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain
too cheap, we esteem too lightly: 'tis dearness only
that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows
how to set a proper price upon its goods; and it
would be strange, indeed, if so celestial an article
as freedom should not be highly rated. Britain,
with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared
that she has a right, not only to tax, but "to bind
us in all cases whatsoever:" and if being bound in
that manner is not slavery, there is not such a thing
as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is im∣pious:
for so unlimited a power can belong only to
God.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Whether the independence of the continent was
declared too soon, or delayed too long, I will not
now enter into as an argument: my own simple
opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier,
it would have been much better. We did not
make a proper use of last winter; neither could
we, while we were in a dependent situation. How∣ever,
the fault, if it were one, was all our own:
we have none to blame but ourselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present winter is worth an age, if rightly employ∣ed: but if lost, or neglected, the whole continent will par∣take of the evil: and there is no punishment that man does not deserve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious and useful.</NOTE>. But no
great deal is lost yet: all that Howe has been doing
for this month past, is rather a ravage than a con∣quest,
which the spirit of the Jerseys a year ago,
would have quickly repulsed, and which time and
a little resolution will soon recover.</P>
<P>I have as little superstition in me as any man
living: but my secret opinion has ever been, and
still is, that God will not give up a people to mili∣tary
destruction, or leave them unsupportedly to
perish, who had so earnestly and so repeatedly
sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every de∣cent
method which wisdom could invent. Neither
have I so much of the infidel in me, as to suppose
that he has relinquished the government of the
world, and given us up to the care of devils: and
as I do not, I cannot see on what grounds the king
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
can look up to heaven for help against us. A com∣mon
murderer, a highwayman, or a housebreaker,
has as good a pretence as he.</P>
<P>'Tis surprising to see how rapidly a panic will
sometimes run through a country. All nations and
ages have been subject to them. Britain has trem∣bled
like an ague, at the report of a French fleet of
flat-bottomed boats: and in the fourteenth cen∣tury,
the whole English army, after ravaging the
kingdom of France, was driven back, like men
petrified with fear: and this brave exploit was
performed by a few broken forces, collected and
headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would that
heaven might inspire some Jersey maid to spirit up
her countrymen, and save her fair fellow sufferers
from ravage and ravishment! Yet panics, in some
cases, have their uses: they produce as much good
as hurt. Their duration is always short: the mind
soon grows through them, and acquires a firmer
habit than before. But their peculiar advantage
is, that they are the touchstones of sincerity and
hypocrisy, and bring things and men to light,
which might otherwise have lain for ever undisco∣vered.
In fact, they have the same effect upon
secret traitors, which an imaginary apparition would
upon a private murderer. They sift out the pri∣vate
thoughts of man, and hold them up in public
to the world. Many a disguised tory has lately
shown his head, that shall penitentially solemnize
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
with curses the day on which Howe arrived upon
the Delaware.</P>
<P>As I was with the troops at Fort Lee, and
marched with them to the edge of Pennsylvania, I
am well acquainted with many circumstances, which
those, who lived at a distance, know but little
or nothing of. Our situation there was exceed∣ingly
cramped, the place being on a narrow neck
of land, between the North river and the Hackin∣sack.
Our force was inconsiderable, being not one
fourth so great as Howe could bring against us. We
had no army at hand to have relieved the garrison,
had we shut ourselves up, and stood on the defence.
Our ammunition, light artillery, and the best part
of our stores, had been removed, upon the appre∣hension
that Howe would endeavour to penetrate
the Jerseys, in which case Fort Lee could have been
of no use to us: for it must occur to every think∣ing
man, whether in the army or not, that these kinds
of field-forts are only fit for temporary purposes,
and last in use no longer than the enemy directs
his force against the particular object which such
forts were raised to defend. Such was our situ∣ation
and condition at Fort Lee, on the morning
of the twentieth of November, when an officer
arrived with information, that the enemy, with two
hundred boats, had landed about seven or eight
miles above. Major-general Green, who com∣manded
the garrison, immediately ordered them
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
under arms, and sent express to his Excellency
General Washington, at the town of Hackinsack,
distant, by way of the ferry, six miles. Our first
object was to secure the bridge over the Hackin∣sack,
which lay up the river, between the enemy
and us, about six miles from us, and three from
them. General Washington arrived in about three
quarters of an hour, and marched at the head of
the troops to the bridge, which place I expected
we should have a brush for: however, they did
not choose to dispute it with us: and the greatest
part of our troops went over the bridge, the rest
over the ferry, except some which passed at a mill,
on a small creek, between the bridge and the ferry,
and made their way through some marshy grounds,
up to the town of Hackinsack, and there passed the
river. We brought off as much baggage as the
waggons could contain: the rest was lost. The
simple object was to bring off the garrison, and to
march them on till they could be strengthened by
the Jersey or Pennsylvania militia, so as to be en∣bled
to make a stand. We staid four days at New∣ark,
collected in our out-posts, with some of the
Jersey militia, and marched out twice to meet the
enemy, on information of their being advancing,
though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs.
General Howe, in my opinion, committed a great
error in generalship, in not throwing a body of sorces
off from Staten Island through Amboy, by which
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
means he might have seized all our stores at Bruns∣wick,
and intercepted our march into Pennsylva∣nia.
But if we believe the power of hell to be
limited, we must likewise believe that their agents
are under some providential controul.</P>
<P>I shall not now attempt to give all the particu∣lars
of our retreat to the Delaware. Suffice it for
the present to say, that both officers and men,
though greatly harrassed and fatigued, frequently
without rest, covering, or provision, the inevitable
consequences of a long retreat, bore it with a
manly and a martial spirit. All their wishes were
one; which was, that the country would turn out,
and help them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire
has remarked, that king William never appeared to
full advantage, but in difficulties and in action.
The same remark may be made on General Wash∣ington,
for the character fits him. There is a na∣tural
firmness in some minds, which cannot be un∣locked
by trifles; but which, when unlocked, dis∣covers
a cabinet of fortitude: and I reckon it
among those kind of public blessings which we do
not immediately see, that God hath blessed him
with uninterrupted health, and given him a mind
that can even flourish upon care.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this paper with some miscella∣neous
remarks on the state of our affairs; and shall
begin with asking the following question: Why
is it that the enemy hath left the New England pro∣vinces,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
and made these middle ones the seat of
war? The answer is easy: New England is not
infested with Tories, and we are. I have been
tender in raising the cry against these men, and used
numberless arguments to show them their danger:
but it will not do to sacrifice a world to either their
folly or their baseness. The period is now arrived,
in which either they or we must change our sen∣timents,
or one or both must fall. And what is
a tory? Good God! what is he? I should not be
afraid to go with an hundred Whigs against a thou∣sand
Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms.
Every Tory is a coward; for a servile, slavish,
self-interested fear is the foundation of toryism;
and a man under such influence, though he may be
cruel, never can be brave.</P>
<P>But before the line of irrecoverable separation
may be drawn between us, let us reason the matter
together: your conduct is an invitation to the
enemy; yet not one in a thousand of you has heart
enough to join him. Howe is as much deceived
by you, as the American cause is injured by you.
He expects you will all take up arms, and flock to
his standard with muskets on your shoulders. Your
opinions are of no use to him, unless you support
him personally; for it is soldiers, and not tories,
that he wants.</P>
<P>I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man
ought to feel, against the mean principles that are
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
held by the Tories. A noted one, who kept a
tavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with
as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine
years old, as most I ever saw; and after speaking
his mind as freely as he thought was prudent, finish∣ed
with this unfatherly expression, "Well, give
me peace in my days." Not a man lives on the
continent, but fully believes that separation must
some time or other finally take place, and a gene∣rous
parent would have said, "if there must be
trouble, let it be in my days, that my child may
have peace;" and this single reflection, well ap∣plied,
is sufficient to awaken every man to duty.
Not a place upon earth might be so happy as Ame∣rica.
Her situation is remote from all the wrang∣ling
world, and she has nothing to do but to trade
with them. A man may easily distinguish in him∣self
between temper and principle, and I am as
confident as I am that God governs the world, that
America will never be happy till she gets clear of
foreign dominion. Wars, without ceasing, will
break out till that period arrives, and the continent
must, in the end be conqueror; for, though the
flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine, the
coal never can expire.</P>
<P>America did not, nor does not want force; but
she wanted a proper application of that force.
Wisdom is not the purchase of a day and it is no
wonder we should on at first setting off. From an
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
excess of tenderness, we were unwilling to raise
an army, and trusted our cause to the temporary
defence of a well meaning militia. A summer's
experience has now taught us better; yet with those
troops, while they were collected, we were able to
set bounds to the progress of the enemy; and,
thank God! they are again assembling. I always
considered a militia as the best troops in the world
for a sudden exertion, but they will not do for a long
campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an at∣tempt
on this city; should he fail on this side the
Delaware, he is ruined; if he succeeds, our cause
is not ruined. He stakes all on his side against a
part on ours; admitting he succeeds, the conse∣quence
will be, that armies from both ends of the
continent will march to assist their suffering friends
in the middle states; for he cannot go every where:
it is impossible. I consider Howe as the greatest
enemy the tories have; he is bringing a war into
their own country, which, had it not been for him
and partly for themselves, they had been clear of.
Should he now be expelled, I wish, with all the
devotion of a christian, that the names of whig and
tory may never more be mentioned; but should the
tories give him encouragement to come, or assist∣ance
if he come, I as sincerely wish that our next
year's arms may expel them from the continent,
and the congress appropriate their possessions to
the relief of those who have suffered in well-doing.
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
A single successful battle next year will settle the
whole. America will carry on a two-years war by
the confiscation of the property of disaffected per∣sons,
and be made happy by their expulsion. Say
not that this is revenge: call it rather the soft re∣sentment
of a suffering people, who, having no
object in view but the good of all, have staked
their own all upon a seemingly doubtful event.
Yet it is folly to argue against determined hardness:
eloquence may strike the car, and the language of
sorrow draw forth the tear of compassion, but
nothing can reach the heart that is steeled with
prejudice.</P>
<P>Quitting this class of men, I turn, with the
warm ardour of a friend, to those who have nobly
stood, and are yet determined to stand the matter
out. I call not upon a few, but upon all; not on
this state, or that state, but on every state. Up
and help us. Lay your shoulders to the wheel.
Better have too much force than too little, when
so great an object is at stake. Let it be told to the
future world, that in the depth of winter, when
nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that
the city and the country, alarmed at one common
danger, came forth to meet and to repulse it. Say
not that thousands are gone: turn out your tens of
thousands: throw not the burden of the day upon
providence, but show your faith by your good
works, that God may bless you. It matters not
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
where you live, or what rank of life you hold; the
evil or the blessing will reach you all. The far
and the near, the home counties and the back,
the rich and the poor, shall suffer or rejoice alike.
The heart that feels not now, is dead. The blood
of his children shall curse his cowardice, who
shrinks back at a time when a little might have
saved the whole and made them happy. I love
the man that can smile in trouble—that can gather
strength from distress, and grow brave by reflec∣tion.
It is the business of little minds to shrink;
but he, whose heart is firm, and whose conscience
approves his conduct, will pursue his principles
unto death. My own line of reasoning is to my∣self,
as strait and clear as a ray of light. Not all
the treasures of the world, so far as I believe,
could have induced me to support an offensive
war; for I think it murder: but if a thief break
into my house—burn and destroy my property,
and kill, or threaten to kill me and those that are in
it, and to "bind me in all cases whatsoever," to his
absolute will, am I to suffer it? What signifies it
to me, whether he who does it, is a king or a com∣mon
man; my countryman, or not my country∣man;
whether it is done by an individual villain,
or an army of them? If we reason to the root of
things we shall find no difference; neither can any
just cause be assigned, why we should punish in the
one case and pardon in the other. Let them call
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
me rebel, and welcome; I feel no concern from it;
but I should suffer the misery of devils, were
I to make a whore of my soul, by swearing allegi∣ance
to one whose character is that of a sottish,
stupid, stubborn, worthless, brutish man. I con∣ceive
likewise, a horrid idea in receiving mercy
from a being, who at the last day, shall be shriek∣ing
to the rocks and mountains to cover him, and
fleeing with terror from the orphan, the widow, and
the slain of America.</P>
<P>There are cases which cannot be overdone by
language; and this is one. There are persons too,
who see not the full extent of the evil that threatens
them. They solace themselves with hopes, that
the enemy, if they succeed, will be merciful. It
is the madness of folly, to expect mercy from those
who have refused to do justice: and even mercy,
where conquest is the object, is only a trick of
war. The cunning of the fox is as murderous as
the violence of the wolf, and we ought to be
equally on our guard against both. Howe's first
object is partly by threats, and partly by promises,
to terrify or seduce the people to give up thei
arms, and receive mercy. The ministry recom∣mended
the same plan to Gage: and this is what
the tories call making their peace—"a peace
which passeth all understanding," indeed. A
peace which would be the immediate forerunner o
a worse ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
men of Pennsylvania, do reason upon those things!
Were the back counties to give up their arms, they
would fall an easy prey to the Indians, who are
all armed. This, perhaps, is what some tories
would not be sorry for. Were the home counties
to deliver up their arms, they would be exposed
to the resentment of the back counties, who would
then have it in their power to chastise their defection
at pleasure. And were any one state to give up
its arms, that state must be garrisoned by all Howe's
army of Britons and Hessians, to preserve it from
the anger of the rest. Mutual fear is a principal
link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to
that state that breaks the compact. Howe is mer∣cifully
inviting you to a barbarous destruction, and
men must be either rogues or fools that will not see
it. I dwell not upon the vapours of imagination,
I bring reason to your ears; and in language as
plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.</P>
<P>I thank God, that I fear not. I see no real
cause for fear. I know our situation well, and can
see the way out of it. While our army was col∣lected,
Howe dared not risk a battle: and it is no
credit to him, that he decamped from the White
Plains, and waited a mean opportunity to ravage
the defenceless Jerseys: but it is great credit to us▪
that, with an handful of men, we sustained an
orderly retreat for near an hundred miles, brought
off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
greatest part of our stores, and had four rivers to
pass. None can say, that our retreat was precipi∣tate▪
for we were near three weeks in performing
it, that the country might have time to come in.
Twice we marched back to meet the enemy, and
remained out till dark. The sign of fear was not
seen in our camp: and had not some of the cow∣ardly
and disaffected inhabitants spread false alarms
through the country, the Jerseys had never been
ravaged. Once more, we are again collected and
collecting. Our new army, at both ends of the
continent, is recruiting fast; and we shall be able
to open the next campaign with sixty thousand men,
well armed and cloathed. This is our situation—
and who will, may know it. By perseverance
and fortitude, we have the prospect of a glorious
issue; by cowardice and submission, the sad choice
of a variety of evils—a ravaged country—a depo∣pulated
city—habitations without safety—and
slavery without hope—our homes turned into bar∣racks
and bawdy-houses for Hessians—and a future
race to provide for, whose fathers we shall doubt
of! Look on this picture, and weep over it! and if
there yet remains one thoughtless wretch, who be∣lieves
it not, let him suffer it unlamented.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO LORD HOWE.</HEAD>
<P>UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a
writer. His concerns are with all mankind, and
though he cannot command their obedience, he
can assign them their duty. The republic of let∣ters
is more ancient than monarchy, and of far
higher character in the world than the vassal court
of Britain; he that rebels against reason is a real
rebel, but he that in defence of reason, rebels
against tyranny, has a better title to "defender
of the faith" than George the third.</P>
<P>As a military man, your lordship may hold out
the sword of war, and call it the <HI>"ultima ratio re∣gum</HI>;"
the last reason of kings; we in return can
shew you the sword of justice, and call it, "the
best scourge of tyrants." The first of these two
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
may threaten, or even frighten, for a while, and
cast a sickly langour over an insulted people, but
reason will soon recover the debauch, and restore
them again to tranquil fortitude. Your Lordship,
I find, has now commenced author, and published
a Proclamation; I too have published a Crisis;
as they stand, they are the antipodes of each other;
both cannot rise at once, and one of them must
descend: and so quick is the revolution of things,
that your Lordship's performance, I see, has al∣ready
fallen many degrees from its first place, and
is now just visible on the edge of the political ho∣rizon.</P>
<P>It is surprising to what a pitch of infatuation blind
folly and obstinacy will carry mankind, and your
Lordship's drowsy Proclamation is a proof that it
does not even quit them in their sleep. Perhaps
you thought America too was taking a nap, and
therefore chose, like Satan to Eve, to whisper the
delusion softly, lest you should awaken her. This
continent, Sir, is too extensive to sleep all at
once, and too watchful, even in its slumbers, not
to startle at the unhallowed foot of an invader.
You may issue your proclamations, and welcome,
for we have learned to "reverence ourselves,"
and scorn the insulting ruffian that employs you.
America, for your deceased brother's sake, would
gladly have shewn you respect, and it is a new
aggravation to her seelings, that Howe should be
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
forgetful, and raise his sword against those, who at
their own charge raised a monument to his bro∣ther.
But your master has commanded, and you
have not enough of nature left to refuse. Surely
there must be something strangely degenerating in
the love of monarchy, that can so completely wear
a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to
lick the dust that kings have trode upon. A few
more years, should you survive them, will bestow
on you the title of an old man, and in some hour
of future reflection you may probably find the
fitness of Wolsey's despairing penitence, "Had
I served my God as faithfully as I have served
my king, he would not thus have forsaken me
in my old age."</P>
<P>The character you appear to us in is truly ridi∣culous.
Your friends, the tories, announced your
coming with high descriptions of your unlimited
powers; but your Proclamation has given them
the lie, by shewing you to be a commissioner with∣out
authority. Had your powers been ever so
great, they were nothing to us, farther than we
pleased; because we had the same right which
other nations had, to do what we thought was
best. "The United States of America," will
found as pompously in the world, or in history, as
"the Kingdom of Great Britain;" the character of
General Washington will fill a page with as much
lustre as that of Lord Howe; and the congress
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
have as much right to command the king and par∣liament
of London to desist from legislation, as
they or you have to command the congress. Only
suppose how laughable such an edict would appear
from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but
turn the tables upon yourself, and you will see
how your Proclamation is received here. Having
thus placed you in a proper position, in which you
may have a full view of folly, and learn to despise
it, I hold up to you, for that purpose, the follow∣ing
quotation from your own lunarian Proclama∣tion.
"And we (Lord Howe and General Howe)
do command (and in his Majesty's name for∣sooth),
all such persons as are assembled toge∣ther
under the name of general or provincial
congresses, committees, conventions, or other
associations, by whatever name or names known
or distinguished, to desist and cease from all
such treasonable actings and doings."</P>
<P>You introduce your Proclamation by referring
to your declarations of the 14th of July and 19th
of September. In the last of these, you sunk
yourself below the character of a private gentle∣man.
That I may not seem to accuse you un∣justly,
I shall state the circumstance: By a verbal
invitation of yours, communicated to congress by
General Sullivan, then a prisoner on his parole,
you signified your desire of conferring with some
members of that body as private gentlemen. It
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
was beneath the dignity of the American congress
to pay any regard to a message that at best was
but a genteel affront, and had too much of the
ministerial complexion of tampering with private
persons; and which might probably have been the
case, had the gentlemen, who were deputed on that
business, possessed that easy kind of virtue which
an English courtier is so truly distinguished by.
Your request, however, was complied with, for
honest men are naturally more tender of their civil
than their political fame. The interview ended
as every sensible man thought it would; for your
Lordship knows, as well as the writer of the Crisis,
that it is impossible for the King of England to
promise the repeal, or even the revisal, of any
acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part you
had nothing to say, more than to request, in the
room of demanding the entire surrender of the
continent; and then, if that was complied with,
to promise the that the inhabitants should escape with
their lives. This was the upshot of the conference.
You informed the conferees that you were two
months in soliciting these powers. We ask, what
powers▪ for, as commissioner, you have none. If
you mean the power of pardoning, it is an oblique
proof, that your master was determined to sacri∣fice
all before him; and that you were two months
in dissuading him from his purpose. Another evi∣dence
of his savage obstinacy! From your own
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
account of the matter, we may justly draw these
two conclusions: first, that you serve a monster;
and secondly, that never was a commissioner sent
on a more foolish errand than yourself. This
plain language may perhaps sound uncoothly to an
ear vitiated by courtly resinements; but words
were made for use, and the fault lies in deserving
them, or the abuse in applying them unfairly.</P>
<P>Soon after your return to New-York, you pub∣lished
a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill against
the congress; for it was certainly stepping out of
the line of common civility, first to screen your
national pride by soliciting an interview with them
as private gentlemen, and in the conclusion to en∣deavour
to deceive the multitude by making an
hand-bill attack on the whole body of the congress;
you got them together under one name, and abused
them under another. But the king you serve, and
the cause you support, afford you so few instances
of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your
situation, the congress pardoned the insult by tak∣ing
no notice of it.</P>
<P>You say in that hand-bill, "that they, the con∣gress,
disavowed every purpose for reconcilia∣tion
not consonant with their extravagant and
inadmissible claim of independence."</P>
<P>Why, God bless me! what have you to do with
our independence? we asked no leave of yours to
set it up; we ask no money of yours to support it;
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
we can do better without your fleets and armies
than with them; you may soon have enough to do
to protect yourselves without being burthened with
us. We are very willing to be at peace with you,
to buy of you and sell to you, and, like young be∣ginners
in the world, to work for our own living;
therefore, why do you put yourselves out of cash,
when we know you cannot spare it, and we do not
desire you to run into debt? I am willing, Sir,
you should see your folly in every view I can
place it, and for that reason descend sometimes to
tell you in jest what I wish you to see in earnest.
But to be more serious with you, why do you say
"their" independence? To set you right, Sir,
we tell you, that the independency is ours, not
theirs. The congress were authorised, by every
state on the continent, to publish it to all the world,
and in so doing are not to be considered as the in∣ventors,
but only as the heralds that proclaimed
it, or the office from which the sense of the peo∣ple
received a legal form; and it was as much as
any or all their heads were worth, to have treated
with you, on the subject of submission, under any
name whatever. But we know the men in whom
we have trusted;—can England say the same of
her parliament?</P>
<P>I come now more particularly to your Procla∣mation
of the 30th of November last. Had you
gained an entire conquest over all the armies of
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
America, and then put forth a proclamation, of∣fering
(what you call) mercy, your conduct would
have had some spacious shew of humanity; but to
creep by surprise into a province, and there en∣deavour
to terrify and seduce the inhabitants from
their just allegiance to the rest, by promises which
you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both
cruel and unmanly: cruel in its effects; because,
unless you can keep all the ground you have
marched over, how are you, in the words of your
Proclamation, to secure to your proselytes "the
enjoyment of their property?" What are to be∣come
either of your new-adopted subjects, or your
old friends the tories, in Burlington, Bordentown,
Trenton, Montholly, and many other places, where
you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled
with the precipitation of a pursued thief? What,
I say, are to become of those wretches? What
are to become of those who went over to you from
this city and state? What more can you say to
them than "shift for yourselves?" Or what more
can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds
over the face of the earth? You may now tell
them to take their leave of America, and all that
once was theirs. Recommend them, for consola∣tion,
to your master's court: there perhaps they
may make a shift to live on the scraps of some dang∣ling
parasite, and chuse companions among thou∣sands
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
like themselves. A traitor is the foulest fiend
on earth.</P>
<P>In a political sense we ought to thank you for
thus bequeathing estates to the continent; we shall
soon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war with∣out
expence, and grow rich by the ill policy of
Lord Howe, and the generous defection of the
tories. Had you set your foot into this city, you
would have bestowed estates upon us which we ne∣ver
thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were
unwilling to suspect. "But these men" you will
say, "are his majesty's most faithful subjects;" let
that honour then be all their fortune, and let his
majesty take them to himself.</P>
<P>I am now thoroughly disgusted with them; they
live in ungrateful case, and bend their whole minds
to mischief. It seems as if God had given them
over to a spirit of infidelity, and that they are open
to conviction in no other line but that of punish∣ment.
It is time to have done with tarring, feather∣ing,
carting, and taking securities for their future
good behaviour. Every sensible man must feel a
conscious shame at seeing a poor fellow hawked for
a shew about the streets, when it is known, that he is
only the tool of some principal villian, blassed into
his offence by the force of false reasoning, or bribed
thereto through sad necessity. We dishonour our∣selves
by attacking such trifling characters, while
greater ones are suffered to escape. 'Tis our duty
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
to find them out, and their proper punishment
would be to exile them from the continent for ever.
The circle of them is not so great as some ima∣gine.
The influence of a sew has tainted many
who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circu∣lation
of lies among those who are not much in the
way of hearing them contradicted, will in time pass
for truth: and the crime lies not in the believer,
but the inventor. I am not for declaring war
against every man that appears not so warm as my∣self.
Difference of constitution, temper, habit of
speaking, and many other things, will go a great
way in sixing the outward character of a man, yet
simple honesty may remain at bottom. Some men
have naturally a military turn, and can brave hard∣ships
and the risk of life, with a chearful face: others
have not; no slavery appears to them so great as
the fatigue of arms, and no terror so powerful as
that of personal danger. What can we say; We
cannot alter nature; neither ought we to punish
the son because the father begot him in a cowardly
mood. However, I believe most men have more
courage than they know of, and that a little at first
is enough to begin with. I knew the time when
I thought that the whistling of a cannon ball would
have frightened me almost to death: but I have
since tried it, and find I can stand it with as little
discomposure, and (I believe) with a much easier
conscience than your Lordship. The same dread
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
would return to me again, were I in your situation:
for my solemn belief of your cause, is, that it is
hellish and damnable: and under that conviction,
every thinking man's heart must fail him.</P>
<P>From a concern, that a good cause should be
dishonoured by the least disunion among us, I said
in my former paper, No. II. that, "should the ene∣my
now be expelled, I wish, with all the since∣rity
of a christian, that the names of whig and
tory might never more be mentioned:" but there
is a knot of men among us, of such a venomous
cast, that they will not admit even one's good wishes
to act in their favour. Instead of rejoicing that
heaven had, as it were, providentially preserved
this city from plunder and destruction, by deli∣vering
so great a part of the enemy into our hands,
with so little effusion of blood, they stubbornly
affected to disbelieve it, until within an hour, nay
half an hour of the prisoners arriving: and the
quakers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown fet of men, who claim to themselves the right of representing the whole; and while the whole society of Quak∣ers admit its validity by a silent acknowledgment, it is im∣possible that any distinction can be made by the public; and the more so, because the New-York paper, of the 30th of December, printed by permission of our enemies, says, that "the Quakers begin to speak openly of their attachment to the British constitution." We are certain that we have many friends among them, and wish to know them.</NOTE> put forth a testimony, dated the twentieth
of December, signed John Pemberton, declaring
their attachment to the British government. These
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
men are continually harping on the great sin of our
bearing arms: but the king of Briton may lay waste
the world in blood and famine, and they, poor
fallen souls, have nothing to say.</P>
<P>In some future paper, I intend to distinguish be∣tween
the different kinds of persons who have been
denominated tories: for this I am clear in, that all
are not so, who have been called so, nor all men
whigs, who were once thought so: and as I mean
not to conceal the name of any true friend, when
there shall be occasion to mention him; neither
will I that of an enemy, who ought to be known,
let his rank, station, or religion be what it may.</P>
<P>Much pains have been taken by some to set your
Lordship's private character in an amiable light:
but as it has chiefly been done by men who know
nothing about you, and who are no ways remark∣able
for their attachment to us, we have no just
authority for believing it. George the Third was
imposed upon us by the same arts: but time has
at length done him justice: and the same fate may
probably attend your Lordship. Your avowed
purpose here, is, to kill, conquer, plunder, par∣don,
and enslave: and the ravages of your army,
through the Jerseys, have been marked with as
much barbarism, as if you had openly professed
yourself the prince of ruffians. Not even the ap∣pearance
of humanity has been preserved either on
the march or the retreat of your troops. No ge∣neral
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
order, that I could ever learn, has ever been
issued to prevent or even forbid your troops from
robbery, wherever they came: and the only in∣stance
of justice, if it can be called such, which
has distinguished you for impartiality, is, that you
treated and plundered all alike. What could not
be carried away, have been destroyed: and maho∣gany
furniture has been deliberately laid on the fire
for fuel, rather than the men should be fatigued
with cutting wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As some people may doubt the truth of such wanton de∣struction, I think it necessary to inform, that one of the people called Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this informa∣tion at the house of Mr. Michael Hutchinson (one of the same profession), who lives near to Trenton ferry, on the Pennsyl∣vania side, Mr. Hutchinson being present.</NOTE>. There was a time, when the
whigs confided much in your supposed candour,
and the tories rested themselves on your favour.
The experiments have now been made, and failed:
and every town, nay every cottage, in the Jerseys
where your arms have been, is a testimony against
you. How you may rest under this sacrifice of
character, I know not: but this I know, that you
sleep and rise with the daily curses of thousands
upon you. Perhaps, the misery which the tories
have suffered by your proffered mercy, may give
them some claim to their country's pity, and be in
the end the best favour you could shew them.</P>
<P> In a folio general order book belonging to Co∣lonel
Rahl's battalion, taken at Trenton, and now
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
now in the possession of the council of safety for
this state, the following barbarous order is fre∣quently
repeated: "His excellency the commander
in chief orders that all inhabitants which shall be
found with arms, not having an officer with them,
shall be immediately taken and hung up." How
many you may thus have privately sacrificed, we
know not; and the account can only be settled in
another world. Your treatment of prisoners, in
order to distress them to enlist into your infernal
service, is not to be equalled by any instance in
Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe, and
his brother, whom the tories, and their three-quarter
kindred, the quakers, or some of them at least, have
been holden up for patterns of justice and mercy!</P>
<P>A bad cause will ever be supported by bad means,
and bad men: and whoever will be at the pains of
examining strictly into things, will find that one and
the same spirit of opposition and impiety, more or
less, governs through your whole party in both
countries. Not many days ago, I accidentally fell
in company with a person of this city, noted for
espousing your cause; and on my remarking to him,
that it appeared clear to me, by the late providen∣tial
turn of affairs, that God Almighty was visibly
on our side; he replied, we care nothing for that;
you may have him, and welcome; if we have but
enough of the devil on our side, we shall do.
However carelessly this be spoken, matters not;
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
'tis still the insensible principle that directs all your
conduct, and will at last most assuredly deceive
and ruin you.</P>
<P>If ever a nation was mad and foolish, blind to
its own interest, and bent on its own destruction, it
is Britain. There are such things as national sins:
and though the punishment of individuals may be
reserved to another world, national punishment can
only be inflicted in this world. Britain, as a na∣tion,
is, in my inmost belief, the greatest and most
ungrateful offender against God, on the face of the
whole earth. Blessed with all the commerce she
could wish for, and furnished by a vast extent of
dominion, with the means of civilizing both the
eastern and western world, she has made no other
use of both, than proudly to idolize her own
"thunder," and rip up the bowels of whole coun∣tries,
for what she could get. Like Alexander,
she has made war her sport, and inflicted misery
for prodigality sake. The blood of India is not
yet repaid, nor the wretchedness of Africa yet re∣quited.
Of late, she has enlarged her lift of na∣tional
cruelties, by her butcherly destruction of
the Caribbs of St. Vincent's, and in returning an
answer by the sword, to the meek prayer for "peace,
liberty, and safety." These are serious things:
and whatever a foolish tyrant, a debauched court,
a trafficking legislature, or a blinded people, may
think, the national account with heaven must some
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
day or other be settled. All countries have sooner or
later been called to their reckoning. The proudest
empires have sunk, when the balance was struck:
and Britain, like an individual penitent, must un∣dergo
her day of sorrow, and the sooner it hap∣pens
to her the better. As I wish it over, I wish
it to come, but withal wish that it may be as light
as possible.</P>
<P>Perhaps your Lordship has no taste for serious
things. By your connexions in England, I should
suppose not: therefore I shall drop this part of the
subject, and take it up in a line in which you
will better understand me.</P>
<P>By what means, may I ask, do you expect to
conquer America? If you could not effect it in
the summer when our army was less than yours,
nor in the winter, when we had none, how are
you to do it? In point of generalship, you have
been outwitted; and in point of fortitude, outdone:
your advantages turn out to your loss, and shew us
that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts. Like
a game of drafts, we can move out of one square,
to let you come in, in order that we may after∣wards
take two or three for one; and as we can
always keep a double corner for ourselves, we can
always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be so
insensible, as not to see that we have two to one
the advantage of you, because we conquer by a
drawn game, and you lose by it. Burgoyne might
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
have taught your Lordship this knowledge; he has
been long a student in the doctrine of chances.</P>
<P>I have no other idea of conquering countries
than by subduing the armies which defend them:
have you done this, or can you do this? If you
have not, it would be civil in you to let your pro∣clamations
alone for the present; otherwise, you
will ruin more tories by your grace and favour than
you will whigs by your arms.</P>
<P>Were you to obtain possession of this city, you
would not know what to do with it, more than to
plunder it. To hold it, in the manner you hold
New York, would be an additional dead weight
upon your hands: and if a general conquest is
your object, you had better be without the city
than with it. When you have defeated all our
armies, the cities will fall into your hands of them∣selves;
but to creep into them in the manner you
got into Princetown, Trenton, &amp;c. is like robbing
an orchard in the night, before the fruit be ripe,
and running away in the morning. Your experi∣ment
in the Jerseys is sufficient to teach you that
you have something more to do than barely to get
into other people's houses; and your new converts
to whom you promised all manner of protection,
and seduced into new guilt by pardoning them
from their former virtues, must begin to have a
very contemptible opinion both of your power and
policy. Your authority in the Jerseys is now re∣duced
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
to the small circle which your army occu∣pies,
and your Proclamation is no where else seen,
unless it be to be laughed at. The mighty sub∣duers
of the continent are retreated into a nutshell,
and the proud forgivers of our sins are fled from
those they came to pardon; and all this at a time
when they were dispatching vessel after vessel to
England, with the great news of every day. In
short, you have managed your Jersey expedition
so very dexterously, that the dead only are con∣querors,
because none will dispute the ground with
them. In all the wars you have formerly been
concerned in, you had only armies to contend
with; in this case, you have both an army and a
country to combat with. In former wars, the
countries followed the fate of their capitals; Ca∣nada
fell with Quebec; and Minorca, with Port
Mahon or St. Philips; by subduing those, the con∣querors
opened a way into, and became masters
of the country: here it is otherwise: if you get
possession of a city here, you are obliged to shut
yourselves up in it, and can make no other use of
it, than to spend your country's money in. This
is all the advantage you have drawn from New-York;
and you would draw less from Philadelphia,
because it requires more force to keep it, and is
much farther from the sea. A pretty figure you
and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river
full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the imme∣diate
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
consequence of your getting here would be,
that you would be cannonaded out again, and the
tories be obliged to make good the damage; and
this, sooner or later, will be the fate of New York.</P>
<P>I wish to see the city saved, not so much from
military, as from natural motives. It is the hiding-place
of women and children, and Lord Howe's
proper business is with our armies. When I put
all the circumstances together which ought to be
taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering Ame∣rica.
Because you lived in a little country, where
an army might run over the whole in a few days,
and where a single company of soldiers might
put a multitude to the rout, you expected to
find it the same here. It is plain that you brought
over with you all the narrow notions you were
bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation
in the king's name was to do great things; but
Englishmen always travel for knowledge, and your
Lordship, I hope, will return, if you return at all,
much wiser than you came.</P>
<P>We may be surprised by events we did not ex∣pect,
and in that interval of recollection you may
gain some temporary advantage: such was the case
a few weeks ago: but we soon ripen again into
reason, collect our strength, and while you are
preparing for a triumph, we come upon you with
a defeat. Such it has been▪ and such it would be
were you to try it an hundred times over. Were
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
you to garrison the places you might march over,
in order to secure their subjection (for remember
you can do it by no other means), your army
would be like a stream of water running to no∣thing.
By the time you reached from New York
to Virginia, you would be reduced to a string of
drops not capable of hanging together; while we
by retreating from state to state, like a river turn∣ing
back upon itself, would acquire strength in
the same proportion as you lost it, and in the end
be capable of overwhelming you. The country
in the mean time would suffer; but it is a day of
suffering, and we ought to expect it. What we
contend for is worthy the affliction we may go
through. If we get but bread to eat, and any
kind of raiment to put on, we ought, not only to
be contented, but thankful: more than that we
ought not to look for; and less than that, heaven
has not yet suffered us to want. He that would
fell his birth-right for a little salt, is as worthless
as he who sold it for porrage without falt: and he
that would part with it for a gay coat, or a plain
coat, ought for ever to be a slave in buff. What
are salt, sugar, and finery, to the inestimable bles∣sings
of "Liberty and Safety?" Or what are the
inconveniences of a few months to the tributary
bondage of ages? The meanest peasant in Ame∣rica,
blessed with these sentiments, is a happy man,
compared with a New York tory; he can eat his
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
morsel without repining, and when he has done,
can sweeten it with a repast of wholesome air; he
can take his child by the hand and bless it, with∣out
feeling the conscious shame of neglecting a
parent's duty.</P>
<P>In publishing these remarks, I have several ob∣jects
in view. On your part they are, to expose
the folly of your pretended authority, as a commis∣sioner—the
wickedness of your cause in general—
and the impossibility of your conquering us at any
rate. On the part of the public, my meaning is,
to shew them their true and solid interest; to en∣courage
them to their own good; to remove the
fears and falsities, which bad men had spread, and
weak men had encouraged; and to excite in all
men a love for union, and a chearfulness for duty.</P>
<P>I shall submit one more case to you, respecting
your conquest of this country, and then proceed
to new observations.</P>
<P>Suppose our armies in every part of the conti∣nent
immediately to disperse, every man to his
home, or where else he might be safe, and engage
to re-assemble again on a certain future day. It
is clear that you would then have no army to con∣tend
with; yet you would be as much at a loss as
you are now: you would be afraid to send your
troops in parties over the continent, either to dis∣arm,
or prevent us from assembling, lest they should
not return: and while you kept them together,
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
having no army of ours to dispute with, you could
not call it a conquest. You might furnish out a
pompous page in the London Gazette, or the New
York paper: but when we returned at the appointed
time, you would have the same work to do you had
at first.</P>
<P>It has been the folly of Britain to suppose her∣self
more powerful than she really is, and by that
means have arrogated to herself a rank in the
world she is not entitled to: for more than this
century past she has not been able to carry on a
war without foreign assistance. In Marlborough's
campaigns, and from that day to this, the number
of German troops and officers assisting her, have
been about equal with her own. Ten thousand
Hessians were sent to England last war, to protect
her from a French invasion: and she would have
cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and West
Indian expeditions, had not America been lavish
of her men and money to help her along. The
only instance, in which she was engaged singly,
that I can recollect, was against the rebellion in
Scotland in 1745 and 1746, and in that, out of
three battles, she was twice beaten, till by thus re∣ducing
their numbers (as we shall yours), and tak∣ing
a supply ship, that was coming to Scotland,
with clothes, arms, and money (as we have often
done), she was at last enabled to defeat them.</P>
<P>England was never famous by land. Her of∣ficers
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
have generally been suspected of cowardice,
have more of the air of a dancing master than a
soldier; and by the sample we have taken prison∣ers,
we begin to give the preference to ourselves.
Her strength of late has laid in her extravagance:
but as her finances and her credit are now low, her
sinews in that line begin to fail fast. As a nation,
she is the poorest in Europe: for were the whole
kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put up to sale,
like the estate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as
much as she owes. Yet this thoughtless wretch
must go to war, and with the avowed design, too,
of making us beasts of burden, to support her in
riot and debauchery, and to assist her afterwards in
distressing those nations who are now our best
friends. This ingratitude may suit a tory, or the
unchristian peevishness of a fallen quaker, but none
else.</P>
<P>It is the unhappy temper of the English, to be
pleased with any war, right or wrong, be it but
successful: but they soon grow discontented with
ill fortune: and it is an even chance, that they are
as clamourous for peace next summer, as the king
and his ministers were for war last winter. In this
natural view of things, your Lordship stands in a
very ugly critical situation. Your whole charac∣ter
is staked upon your laurels: if they wither, you
wither with them. If they flourish, you cannot
live long to look at them: and at any rate, the
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
black account hereafter is not far off. What
lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only bles∣sings
in disguise: and the seeming advantages on
your side have turned out to our profit. Even
our loss of this city, as far as we can see, might
be a principal gain to us. The more surface you
spread over, the thinner you will be, and the easier
wiped away: and our consolation, under that ap∣parent
disaster, would be, that the estates of the
tories would be securities for the repairs. In short,
there is no old ground we can fail upon, but some
new foundation rises again to support us. "We
have put, Sir, our hands to the plough—and cursed
be he that looketh back."</P>
<P>Your king, in his speech to parliament, last
spring, declared to them, that "he had no doubt
but the great force they had enabled him to send
to America would effectually reduce the rebellious
colonies." It has not—neither can it. But it has
done just enough to say the foundation of its own
next year's ruin. You are sensible that you left
England in a divided distracted state of politics, and,
by the command you had here, you became a prin∣cipal
prop in the court party: their fortunes rest
on yours: by a single express, you can fix their
value with the public, and the degree to which
their spirits shall rise or fall. They are in your
hands as stock, and you have the secret of the al∣ley
with you. Thus situated, and connected, you
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
become the unintentional, mechanical instrument
of your own and their overthrow. The king and his
ministers put conquest out of doubt, and the credit
of both depended on the proof. To support them
in the interim, it was necessary that you should
make the most of every thing: and we can tell by
Hugh Gaine's New York paper, what the com∣plexion
of the London Gazette is. With such a
list of victories, the nation cannot expect you will
ask new supplies; and to confess your want of them,
would give the lie to your triumphs, and impeach
the king and his ministers of treasonable decep∣tion.
If you make the necessary demand at home,
your party sinks: if you make it not, you sink
yourself. To ask it now, is too late, and to ask it
before, was too soon, and unless it arrive quickly,
will be of no use. In short, the part you have to
act, cannot be acted: and I am fully persuaded,
that all you have to trust to is, to do the best with
what force you have got, or little more. Though
we have greatly excelled you in point of general∣ship,
and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we
have not entered into the full soul of enterprize:
for I, who know England, and the disposition of the
people well, am confident, that it is easier for us to
effect a revolution there, than you a conquest here.
A few thousand men, landed in England, with the
declared design of deposing the present king▪
bringing his ministers to trial, and setting up the
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
Duke of Gloucester in his stead, would assuredly
carry their point, while you were grovelling here
ignorant of the matter. As I send all my papers
to England, this, like Common Sense, will find its
way there: and though it may put one party on
their guard, it will inform the other, and the nation
in general, of our design to help them.</P>
<P>Thus far, Sir, I have endeavoured to give you
a picture of present affairs: you may draw from it
what conclusion you please. I wish as well to the
true posterity of England as you can, but I consi∣der
independence as America's natural right and
interest, and never could see any real disservice it
would be to Britain. If an English merchant re∣ceives
an order, and is paid for it, it signifies no∣thing
to him who governs the country. This is
my creed of politics. If I have any where ex∣pressed
myself over warmly, it is from a fixt im∣moveable
hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel
men and cruel measures. I have likewise an aver∣sion
to monarchy, as being too debasing to the
dignity of man; but I never troubled others with
my notions till very lately, nor ever published a
syllable in England in my life. What I write is
pure nature, and my pen and my soul have ever
gone together. My writings I have always given
away, reserving only the expence of printing and
paper, and sometimes not even that. I have ne∣ver
courted either fame or interest, and my man∣ner
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
of life, to those who know it, will justify what
I say. My study is, to be useful, and if your
Lordship love mankind as well as I do, you would,
seeing you cannot conquer us, cast about and lend
your hand towards accomplishing a peace. Our
independence, with God's blessing, we will main∣tain
against all the world: but as we wish to avoid
evil ourselves, we wish not to inflict it on others.
I am never over inquisitive into the secrets of the
cabinet, but I have some notion, if you neglect
the present opportunity, that it will not be in our
power to make a separate peace with you after∣wards;
for whatever treaties or alliances we form,
we shall most faithfully abide by: wherefore you
may be deceived, if you think you can make it
with us at any time. A lasting independent peace
is my wish, end, and aim; and to accomplish that,
"I pray God the Americans may never be de∣feated,
and I trust while they have good officers,
and are well commanded, and willing to be com∣manded,
that they never will."</P>

<HEAD>AMERICAN CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the progress of politics, as in the common
occurrences of life, we are not only apt to forget
the ground we have travelled over, but frequently
neglect to gather up experience as we go. We
expend, if I may so say, the knowledge of every
day on the circumstances that produce it, and
journey on in search of new matter and new re∣finements:
but as it is pleasant, and sometimes
useful, to look back, even to the first periods of
infancy, and trace the turns and windings through
which we have passed, so we may likewise derive
many advantages by halting a while in our politi∣cal
career, and taking a review of the wonderous
complicated labyrinth of little more than yester∣day.</P>
<P>Truly, may we say, that never did man grow old
in so short a time! We have crowded the busi∣ness
of an age into the compass of a few months,
and have been driven through such a rapid suc∣cession
of things, that, for the want of leisure to
think, we unavoidably wasted knowledge as we
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
came, and have left nearly as much behind us as
we brought with us: but the road is yet rich with
fragments, and, before we fully lose sight of them,
will repay us for the trouble of stopping to pick
them up.</P>
<P>Were a man to be totally deprived of memory,
he would be incapable of forming any just opinion;
every thing about him would seem a chaos; he
would even have his own history to ask from every
one; and by not knowing how the world went on
in his absence, he would be at a loss to know how
it OUGHT to go on when he recovered, or rather
returned to it again. In like manner, though in a
less degree, a too great inattention to past occur∣rences
retards and bewilders our judgment in
every thing; while, on the contrary, by comparing
what is past with what is present, we frequently
hit on the true character of both, and become wise
with very little trouble. It is a kind of counter∣march,
by which we get into the rear of Time, and
mark the movements and meaning of things as we
make our return. There are certain circumstances,
which, at the time of their happening, are kind of
riddles; and as every riddle is to be followed by
its answer, so those kind of circumstances will be
followed by their events, and those events are al∣ways
the true solution. A considerable space of
time may lapse between, and unless we continue
our observations from the one to the other, the
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
harmony of them will pass away unnoticed: but
the misfortune is, that partly from the pressing ne∣cessity
of some instant things, and partly from the
impatience of our tempers, we are frequently in
such a hurry to make out the meaning of every
thing as fast as it happens, that we thereby never
truly understand it; and not only start new diffi∣culties
to ourselves by so doing, but, as it were,
embarrass Providence in her good designs.</P>
<P>I have been civil in stating this fault on a large
scale; for, as it now stands, it does not appear to
be levelled against any particular set of men; but
were it to be refined a little further, it might after∣wards
be applied to the Tories with a degree of
striking propriety: those men have been remark∣able
for drawing sudden conclusions from single
facts. The least apparent mishap on our side, or
the least seeming advantage on the part of the ene∣my,
have determined the fate of a whole cam∣paign.
By this hasty judgment they have con∣verted
a retreat into a defeat; mistook generalship
for error: while every little advantage purposely
given the enemy, either to weaken their strength
by dividing it, embarrass their councils by multi∣plying
their objects, or to secure a greater post
by the surrender of a less, has been instantly mag∣nified
into a conquest. Thus, by quartering ill
policy upon ill principles, they have frequently
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
promoted the cause they designed to injure, and
injured that which they intended to promote.</P>
<P>It is probable the campaign may open before
this number comes from the press. The enemy
have long lain idle, and amused themselves with
carrying on the war by proclamations only. While
they continue their delay, our strength increases:
and were they to move to action now, it is a cir∣cumstantial
proof they have no reinforcement com∣ing;
wherefore, in either case, the comparative
advantage will be ours. Like a wounded disa∣bled
whale they want only time and room to die in;
and though in the agony of their exit, it may be
unsafe to live within the flapping of their tail, yet
every hour shortens their date, and lessens their
power of mischief. If any thing happens while
this Number is in the press, it will afford me a
subject for the last pages of it. At present I am
tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor
the state of politics, have YET produced any thing
new, I am thereby left in the field of general
matter undirected by any striking or particular
object. This Crisis, therefore, will be made up
rather of variety than novelty, and consist more of
things useful than things wonderful.</P>
<P>The success of the cause, the union of the peo∣ple,
and the means of supporting and securing both,
are points which cannot be too much attended to.
He who doubts of the former is a desponding cow∣ard,
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
and he who wilfully disturbs the latter is a
traitor. Their characters are easily fixed, and
under these short descriptions I leave them for the
present.</P>
<P>One of the greatest degrees of sentimental uni∣on
which America ever knew, was in denying the
right of the British Parliament "TO BIND THE
COLONIES IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." The
declaration is in its form an almighty one, and
is the loftiest stretch of arbitrary power that ever
one set of men, or one country claimed over ano∣ther.
Taxation was nothing more than putting the
declared right into practice; and this failing, re∣course
was had to arms, as a means to establish
both the right and the practice, or to answer a
worse purpose, which will be mentioned in the
course of this Number. And in order to repay
themselves the expence of an army, and to profit
by their own injustice, the Colonies were, by ano∣ther
law, declared to be in a state of actual rebel∣lion,
and of consequence all property therein
would fall to the conquerors.</P>
<P>The Colonies, on their part, first, denied the
right; secondly, they suspended the use of taxable
articles, and petitioned against the practice of tax∣ation:
and these failing, they, thirdly, defended
their property by force, as soon as it was forcibly
invaded; and in answer to the declaration of re∣bellion
and non-protection, published their decla∣ration
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
of Independence, and right to self-protec∣tion.</P>
<P>These, in a few words, are the different stages
of the quarrel; and the parts are so intimately and
necessarily connected with each other, as to admit
of no separation. A person, to use a trite phrase,
must be a Whig or a Tory in the lump. His feel∣ings,
as a man, may be wounded; his charity, as a
Christian, may be moved: but his political prin∣ciples
must go through all the cases on one side or
the other. He cannot be a Whig in <HI>this</HI> stage, and
a Tory in <HI>that.</HI> If he says he is against the United
Independence of the Continent, he is, to all in∣tents
and purposes against her in all the rest; be∣cause
THIS LAST comprehends the whole. And
he may just as well say, that Britain was right in
declaring us rebels; right in taxing us; and right
in declaring her "RIGHT TO BIND THE COLO∣NIES
IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." It signifies
nothing what neutral ground, of his own creation,
he may skulk upon for shelter; for the quarrel in
no stage of it hath afforded any such ground; and
either we or Britain are absolutely right or abso∣lutely
wrong through the whole.</P>
<P>Britain, like a gamester nearly ruined, hath now
put all her losses into one bet, and is playing a
desperate game for the total. If she win it, she
wins from me MY life; she wins the Continent as
the forfeited property of rebels; the right of tax∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
those that are left as reduced subjects; and the
power of binding them as slaves: And the single die
which determines this unparalleled event is, whether
we support our independence or she overturn it.
This is coming to the point at once. Here is the
touch-stone to try men by. <HI>He that is not a sup∣porter
of the independent states of America; in the
same degree that his religious and political principles
would suffer him to support the government of any
other country, of which he called himself a subject,
is, in the American sense of the word,</HI> A TORY<HI>;
and theinstant that he endeavors to bring his toryism
into practice, he becomes</HI> A TRAITOR. The
first man can only be detected by a general test,
and the law hath already provided for the latter.</P>
<P>It is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who
would root up our independence to have any share
in our legislation, either as electors or representa∣tives;
because the support of our independence
rests in a great measure on the vigour and purity of
our public bodies. Would Britain, even in time
of peace, much less in war, suffer an election to be
carried by men who professed themselves not to be
her subjects, or allow such to sit in parliament? Cer∣tainly
not.</P>
<P>But there are a certain species of tories with
whom conscience or principle hath nothing to do,
and who are so from avarice only. Some of the
first fortunes in the continent, on the part of the
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
whigs, are staked on the issue of our present mea∣sures.
And shall disaffection only be rewarded with
security? Can any thing be a greater inducement
to a miserly man, than the hope of making his
mammon safe? And though the scheme be fraught
with every character of folly, yet, so long as he
supposes, that by doing nothing materially crimi∣nal
against America on one part, and by expressing
his private disapprobation against independence, as
a palliative with the enemy on the other part, he
stands thereby in a safe line between both, while, I
say, this ground be suffered to remain, craft and
the spirit of avarice will point it out, and men will
not be wanting to fill up this most contemptible of
all characters.</P>
<P>These men, ashamed to own the sordid cause
from whence their disaffection springs, and thereby
add meanness to meanness, by endeavouring to shel∣ter
themselves under the mask of hypocrisy; that is,
they had rather be thought to be tories from <HI>some
kind of principle,</HI> than tories by having <HI>no principle
at all.</HI> But till such time as they can show some
real reason, natural, political or conscientious, on
which their objections to independence are founded,
we are not obliged to give them credit for being
tories of the first stamp, but must set them down as
tories of the last.</P>
<P>In the second number of the Crisis I endeavoured
to shew the impossibility of the enemy making any
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
conquest of America that nothing was wanting on
our part but patience and perseverance, and that,
with these virtues, our success, as far as human spe∣culation
could discern, seemed as certain as fate.
But as there are many among us, who, influenced
by others, have regularly gone back from the prin∣ciples
they once held, in proportion as we have gone
forward; and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a
good man to live within the neighbourhood of dis∣affected
ones; I shall therefore, for the sake of
confirming the one and recovering the other, en∣deavour,
in the space of a page or two, to go over
some of the leading principles in support of inde∣pendence.
It is a much pleasanter task to pre∣vent
vice than to punish it; and however our tem∣pers
may be gratified by resentment, or our nati∣onal
expences eased by forfeited estates, harmony
and friendship is nevertheless the happiest condition
a country can be blest with.</P>
<P>The principal arguments in support of indepen∣dence
may be comprehended under the four fol∣lowing
heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>First,—The natural right of the continent to
independence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly,—Her interest in being independent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly—The necessity,—and</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly,—The moral advantages arising
therefrom.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
I. The natural right of the continent to indepen∣dence,
is a point which never yet was called in
question. It will not even admit of a debate. To
deny such a right, would be a kind of atheism
against nature: And the best answer to fuch an ob∣jection
would be, "<HI>The fool hath said in his heart,
there is no God.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">II. The interest of the continent in being inde∣pendent
is a point as clearly right as the former.
America, by her own internal industty, and un∣known
to all the powers of Europe, was at the be∣ginning
of the dispute, arrived at a pitch of great∣ness,
trade and population, beyond which it was the
interest of Britain not to suffer her to pass, lest she
should grow too powerful to be kept subordinate.
She began to view this country with the same un∣easy
malicious eye, with which a covetous guardian
would view his ward whose estate he had been en∣riching
himself by for twenty years, and saw him
just arriving to manhood. And America owes no
more to Britain for her present maturity, than the
ward would to his guardian for being twenty-one
years of age. That America hath flourished <HI>at the
time</HI> she was under the government of Britain, is
true; but there is every natural reason to believe,
that had she been an independent country from the
first settlement thereof, uncontrouled by any foreign
power, free to make her own laws, regulate and
encourage her own commerce, she had by his
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
time been of much greater worth than now. The
case is simply this, The first settlers in the different
colonies were left to shift for themselves, unnoticed
and unsupported by any European government;
but as the tyranny and persecution of the old world
daily drove numbers to the new, and, as by the fa∣vor
of Heaven on their industry and perseverance,
they grew into importance, so, in a like degree,
they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes
of Europe. It was impossible in this state of in∣fancy,
however thriving and promising, that they
could resist the power of any armed invader that
should seek to bring them under his authority. In
this situation Britain thought it worth her while to
claim them, and the continent received and ac∣knowledged
the claimer. It was, in reality, of no
very great importance who was her master, seeing
that from the force and ambition of the different
powers of Europe she must, till she acquired
strength enough to assert her own right, acknow∣ledge
some one. As well, perhaps, Britain as ano∣ther;
and it might have been as well to have been
under the states of Holland as any. The same hopes
of engrossing and profiting by her trade, by not
oppressing it too much, would have operated
alike with any master, and produced to the colo∣nies
the same effects. The clamour of protection
likewise, was all a farce; because, in order to make
<HI>that</HI> protection necessary, she must first, by her own
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
quarrels create us enemies. Hard terms indeed!</P>
<P>To know whether it be the interest of the con∣tinent
to be independent, we need only ask this
easy, simple question: Is it the interest of a man
to be a boy all his life? The answer to one will be
the answer to both. America hath been one con∣tinued
scene of legislative contention from the first
king's representative to the last; and this was una∣voidably
founded in the natural opposition of interest
between the old country and the new. A governor
sent from England, or receiving his authority there∣from,
ought never to have been considered in any
other light than that of a genteel commissioned spy,
whose private business was information, and his
public business a kind of civilized oppression. In
the first of these characters he was to watch the tem∣pers,
sentiments and disposition of the people, the
growth of trade, and the increase of private for∣tunes;
and in the latter, to suppress all such acts of
the assemblies, however beneficial to the people,
which did not directly or indirectly throw some in∣crease
of power or profit into the hands of those
who sent him.</P>
<P>America, till now, could never be called a <HI>free
country,</HI> because her legislation depended on the
will of a man three thousand miles distant, whose
interest was in opposition to ours, and who by a
single "no," could forbid what law he pleased.</P>
<P>The freedom of trade, likewise, is, to a trading
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
country, an article of such vast importance, that
the principal source of wealth depends upon it; and
it is impossible that any country can flourish, as it
otherwise might do, whose commerce is engrossed
cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates of
another—yet these evils, and more than I can here
enumerate, the continent has suffered by being un∣der
the government of Great Britain. By an inde∣pendence
we clear the whole at once—put an end
to the business of unanswered petitions and fruitless
remonstrances—exchange Britain for Europe—
shake hands with the world—live at peace with
mankind—and trade to any market where we best
can buy and sell.</P>
<P N="3">III. The necessity, likewise, of being independ∣ent,
even before it was declared, became so evident
and important, that the continent ran the risk of be∣ing
ruined every day she delayed it. There were
reasons to believe that Britain would endeavour to
make an European matter of it, and rather than lose
the whole, would dismember it like Poland, and
dispose of her several claims to the highest bidder.
Genoa, failing in her attempts to reduce Corsica,
made a sale of it to the French, and such traffics
have been common in the old world. We had at
that time no Ambassador in any part of Europe, to
counteract her negociations, and by that means she
had the range of every foreign court uncontradicted
on our part. We even knew nothing of the treaty
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
for the Hessians till it was concluded, and the troops
ready to embark. Had we been independent be∣fore,
we had probably prevented her obtaining them.
We had no credit abroad, because of our rebellious
dependency. Our ships could claim no protection
in foreign ports, because we afforded them no justi∣fiable
reason for granting it to us. The calling
ourselves subjects, and at the same time fighting
against the power we acknowledged, was a danger∣ous
precedent to all Europe. If the grievances
justified our taking up arms, they justified our se∣paration;
if they did not justify our separation,
neither could they justify our taking up arms. All
Europe was interested in reducing us as rebels, and
all Europe (or the greatest part at least) is interested
in supporting us as independent states. At home
our condition was still worse: Our currency had
no foundation. and the fall of it would have ruined
whig and tory alike. We had no other law than a
kind of moderated passion; no other civil power
than an honest mob; and no other protection than
the temporary attachment of one man to another.
Had independence been delayed a few months lon∣ger,
this continent would have been plunged into
irrecoverable confusion: Some violent for it, some
against it, till in the general cabal the rich would
have been ruined, and the poor destroyed. It is
to independence that every tory owes the present
safety he lives in; for by <HI>that,</HI> and <HI>that only,</HI> we
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
emerged from a state of dangerous suspense, and
became a regular people.</P>
<P>The necessity likewise of being independent, had
there been no rupture between Britain and America,
would in a little time have brought one on. The
encreasing importance of commerce, the weight
and perplexity of legislation, and the entangled state
of European politics, would daily have shewn to
the continent the impossibility of continuing subor∣dinate;
for, after the coolest reflections on the mat∣ter,
this must be allowed, that Britain was too jea∣lous
of America, to govern it justly; too ignorant
of it, to govern it well; and too distant from it, to
govern it at all.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But, what weigh most with all men of se∣rious
reflection are the MORAL ADVANTA∣GES
arising from independence: War and desola∣tion
are become the trades of the old world; and
America neither could nor can be under the go∣vernment
of Britain without becoming a sharer of
her guilt, and a partner in all the dismal commerce
of death. The spirit of duelling, extended on a
national scale, is a proper character for European
wars. They have seldom any other motive than
pride, or any other object than fame. The con∣querors
and the conquered are generally ruined
alike, and the chief difference at last is, that the
one marches home with his honours, and the other
without them. 'Tis the natural temper of the
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
English to fight for a feather, if they suppose <HI>that
feather</HI> to be an affront; and America, without the
right of asking why, must have abetted in every
quarrel and abided by its fate. It is a shocking
situation to live in, that one country must be
brought into all the wars of another, whether the
measure be right or wrong, or whether she will or
not; yet this, in the fullest extent, was, and ever
would be, the unavoidable consequence of the
connection. Surely! the Quakers forgot their
own principles, when in their late testimony
they called <HI>this connection</HI> with these military and
miserable appendages hanging to it, "<HI>The happy
constitution.</HI>"</P>
<P>Britain, for centuries past has been nearly fifty
years out of every hundred at war with some power
or other. It certainly ought to be a conscientious
as well as political consideration with America, not
to dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe.
Our situation affords us a retreat from their cabals,
and the present happy union of the states bids fair
for extirpating the future use of arms from one
quarter of the world; yet such have been the irre∣ligious
politics of the present leaders of the Quakers,
that, for the sake of they scarce knew what, they
would cut off every hope of such a blessing by ty∣ing
this continent to Britain, like Hector to the
chariot-wheel of Achilles, to be dragged through
all the miseries of endless European wars.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
The connection, viewed from this ground, is dis∣tressing
to every man who has the feelings of hu∣manity.
By having Britain for our master, we be∣came
enemies to the greatest part of Europe, and
they to us; and the consequence was war inevitable.
By being our own masters, independent of any fo∣reign
one, we have Europe for our friends, and the
prospect of an endless peace among ourselves.
Those who were advocates for the British govern∣ment
over these colonies, were obliged to limit both
their arguments and their ideas to the period of an
European peace only: The moment Britain be∣came
plunged in war, every supposed convenience
to us vanished away, and all we could hope for was
<HI>not to be ruined.</HI> Could this be a desirable condi∣tion
for a young country to be in?</P>
<P>Had the French pursued their fortune immedi∣ately
after the defeat of Braddock, last war this city
and province had then experienced the woeful ca∣lamities
of being a British subject. A scene of the
same kind might happen again; for America, con∣sidered
as a subject to the crown of Britain, would
ever have been the seat of war and the bone of con∣tention
between the two powers.</P>
<P>On the whole, if the future expulsion of arms
from one quarter of the world be a desirable object
to a peaceable man;—if the freedom of trade to
every part of it can engage the attention of a man
of business;—if the support or fall of millions of
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
currency can affect our interest;—if the entire pos∣session
of estates, by cutting off the lordly claims of
Britain over the soil, deserves the regard of landed
property;—and if the right of making our own laws,
uncontrouled by royal or ministerial spies or man∣dates,
be worthy our care as freemen;—then are
all men interested in the support of independence;
and may he that supports it not, be driven from the
blessing, and live unpitied beneath the servile suf∣ferings
of scandalous subjection!</P>
<P>We have been amused with the tales of ancient
wonders; we have read, and wept over, the his∣tories
of other nations; applauded, censured or pi∣tied,
as their cases affected us.—The fortitude and
patience of the sufferers—the justness of their cause
—the weight of their oppressions and oppressors—
the object to be saved or lost—with all the conse∣quences
of a defeat or a conquest—have, in the
hour of sympathy, bewitched our hearts and chained
it to their fate: But where is the power that ever
made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war
on which a world was staked till now?</P>
<P>We may not, perhaps, be wise enough to make
all the advantages we ought of our independence;
but they are, nevertheless, marked and presented
to us with every character of GREAT and GOOD
and worthy the hand of Him who sent them. I
look through the present trouble to a time of tran∣quility,
when we shall have it in our power to set
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
an example of peace to all the world. Were the
Quakers really impressed and influenced by the quiet
principles they profess to hold, they would, how∣ever
they might disapprove the means, be the first
of all men to approve of INDEPENDENCE,
because, by separating from the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah, it affords an opportunity, never given
to man before, of carrying their favourite principle
of peace into general practice, by establishing go∣vernments
that shall hereafter exist without wars.
Oh ye fallen, cringing priest and Pemberton-rid∣den
people! what more can we say of ye than that
a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a
political Quaker a real Jesuit.</P>
<P>Having thus gone over some of the principal
points in support of independence, I must now re∣quest
the reader to return back with me to the pe∣riod
when it first began to be a public doctrine, and
to examine the progress it has made among the
various classes of men. The aera I mean to begin
at, is the breaking out of hostilities, April 19th,
1775. Until this event happened, the continent
seemed to view the dispute as a kind of law-suit for
a matter of right, litigating between the old coun∣try
and the new; and she felt the same kind and
degree of horror, as if she had seen an oppressive
plantiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the
court, while the cause was before it, and put the
judge, the jury, the defendant and his council to the
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
sword. Perhaps a more heart-felt convulsion ne∣ver
reached a country with the same degree of pow∣er
and rapidity before, and never may again. Pi∣ty
for the sufferers, mixed with indignation at the
violence, and heightened with apprehensions of un∣dergoing
the same fate, made the affair of Lex∣ington
the affair of the continent. Every part of it
felt the shock and all vibrated together. A gener∣al
promotion of sentiment took place: Those who
had drank deeply into whiggish principles, that is,
the right and necessity not only of opposing, but
wholly setting aside the power of the crown as soon
as it became practically dangerous (for in theory it
was always so) stept into the first stage of indepen∣dence;
while another class of whigs, equally sound
in principle, but not so sanguine in enterprize, at∣tached
themselves the stronger to the cause and fell
close in with the rear of the former; their partition
was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men
whose chief fault, <HI>at that time,</HI> arose from their en∣tertaining
a better opinion of Britain than she de∣served,
convinced now of their mistake, gave her
up and publicly declared themselves good whigs.
While the tories, seeing it was no longer a laughing
matter, either sunk into silent obscurity, or con∣tented
themselves with coming forth and abusing
General Gage: Not a single advocate appeared to
justify the action of that day; it seemed to appear
to every one with the same magnitude, struck every
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
one with the same force, and created in every one
the same abhorrence. From this period we may
date the growth of independence.</P>
<P>If the many circumstances, which happened at
this memorable time, be taken in one view, and
compared with each other, they will justify a con∣clusion
which seems not to be attended to, I mean
a fixt design in the king and ministry of driving
America into arms, in order that they might be
furnished with a pretence for seizing the whole con∣tinent,
as the immediate property of the crown.
A noble plunder for hungry courtiers!</P>
<P>It ought to be remembered, that the first peti∣tion
from the congress was at this time unanswered
on the part of the British king. That the motion
called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of Fe∣bruary,
1775, arrived in America the latter end of
March. This motion was to be laid by the several
governors, then in being, before the assembly of
each province; and the first assembly before which
it was laid, was the assembly of Pennsylvania in
May following. This being a just state of the case,
I then ask, why were hostilities commenced be∣tween
the time of passing the resolve in the house
of commons, of the 20th of February, and the
time of the assemblies meeting to deliberate upon
it? Degrading and infamous as that motion was,
there is, nevertheless, reason to believe that the
king and his adherents were afraid the colonies would
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
agree to it, and lest they should, took effectual care
they should not, by provoking them with hostilities
in the interim. They had not the least doubt at
that time of conquering America at one blow;
and what they expected to get by a conquest being
infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to
get either by taxation or accommodation, they
seemed determined to prevent even the possibility
of hearing each other, lest America should disad∣point
their greedy hopes of the whole, by listening
even to their own terms. On the one hand they
refufed to hear the petition of the continent, and on
the other hand took effectual care the continent
should not hear them.</P>
<P>That the motion of the 20th of February and the
orders for commencing hostilities were both con∣certed
by the same person or persons, and not the
latter by General Gage, as was falsely imagined at
first, is evident from an extract of a letter of his to
administration, read among other papers in the
house of commons; in which he informs his masters,
<HI>That though their idea of his disarming certain coun∣ties
was a right one, yet it required him to be master
of the country, in order to enable him to execute it.</HI>
This was prior to the commencement of hostilities
and consequently before the motion of the 20th of
February could be deliberated on by the several
assemblies.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
Perhaps it may be asked, why was the motion
past, if there was at the same time a plan to aggra∣vate
the Americans not to listen to it? Lord North
assigned one reason himself, which was, <HI>a hope of
dividing them.</HI> This was publicly tempting them
to reject it; that if, in case, the injury of arms
should fail of provoking them sufficiently, the in∣sult
of such a declaration might fill it up. But by
passing the motion and getting it afterwards rejected
in America, it enabled them, in their wretched
idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the
colonies to foreign powers with every possible mark
of disobedience and rebellion. They had applied
to those powers not to supply the continent with
arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and it was necessary they
should incense them against us by assigning on their
own part some seeming reputable reason why.
By dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the
states, and likewise to perplex the adherents of
America in England. But the principal scheme,
and that which has marked their character in every
part of their conduct, was a design of precipitating
the colonies into a state which they might after∣wards
deem rebellion, and under that pretence put
an end to all future complaints, petitions or re∣monstrances,
by seizing the whole at once. They
had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could glut
them no longer; their prodigality required new
plunder, and through the East-India article TEA,
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
they hoped to transfer their rapine from that quar∣ter
of the world to this.—Every designed quarrel
has its pretence; and the same barbarian avarice
accompanied the plant to America, which ruined
the country which produced it.</P>
<P>That men never turn rogues without turning
fools, is a maxim, sooner or later, universally true.
The commencement of hostilities, being in the be∣ginning
of April, was, of all times the worst cho∣sen:
The congress were to meet the tenth of May
following, and the distress the continent felt at this
unparalleled outrage gave a stability to that body,
which no other circumstance could have done. It
suppressed too, all inferior debates, and bound them
together by a necessitous affection, without giving
them time to differ upon trifles. The suffering
likewise, softened the whole body of the people in∣to
a degree of pliability, which laid the principal
foundation-stone of union, order and government;
and which, at any other time, might only have
fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unim∣proved:
But providence, who best knows how to
time her misfortunes as well as her immediate favors,
chose this to be the time. And who dares dis∣pute
it?</P>
<P>It did not seem the disposition of the people at
this crisis to heap petition upon petition, while the
former remained unanswered: The measure, how∣ever,
was carried in congress, and a second petition
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
was sent; of which I shall only remark, that it was
submissive even to a dangerous fault, because the
prayer of it appealed solely to, what it called, the
prerogative of the crown, while the matter in dis∣pute
was confessed to be constitutional. But even
this petition, flattering as it was, was still not so
harmonious as the chink of cash, and consequently
not sufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his minis∣try.
From every circumstance it is evident, that
it was the determination of the British court to have
nothing to do with America but to conquer it fully
and absolutely. They were certain of success, and the
field of battle was to be the only place of treaty.
I am confident there are thousands and tens of thou∣sands
in America who wonder now they should
ever think otherwise; but the sin of that day was
the sin of civility, yet it operated against our pre∣sent
good in the same manner that a civil opinion
of the devil would against our future peace.</P>
<P>Independence was a doctrine scarce and rare even
towards the conclusion of the year seventy-five:
All our politics had been founded on the hope or
expectation of making the matter up—a hope,
which, though general on the side of America, had
never entered the head or heart of the British court.
Their hope was conquest and confiscation. Good
Heavens! what volumes of thanks does America
owe to Britain! What infinite obligations to the
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
tool, that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the
throne! Nothing but the sharpest effence of vil∣lainy,
compounded with the strongest distillation of
folly, could have produced a menstruum that
would have effected a separation. The congress
in seventy-four administered an abortive medicine
to independence, by prohibiting the importation of
goods, and the succeeding congress rendered the
dose still more dangerous by continuing it. Had
independence been a settled system with America
(as Britain has advanced) she ought to have dou∣bled
her importation, and prohibited in some degree
her exportation. And this single circumstance is
sufficient to acquit America, before any jury of na∣tions,
of having a continental plan of independence
in view: A charge, which had it been true, would
have been honourable, but is so grossly false, that
either the amazing ignorance, or the wilful dishon∣esty
of the British court, is effectually proved by
it.</P>
<P>The second petition, like the first, produced no
answer: it was scarcely acknowledged to be recei∣ved;
the British court were too determined in their
villany even to act it artfully, and in their rage for
conquest, neglected the necessary subtilties for ob∣taining
it. They might have divided, distracted,
and played a thousand tricks with us, had they been
as cunning as they were cruel.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
This last indignity gave a new spring to indepen∣dence.
Those who knew the savage obstinacy of
the king and the jobbing gambling spirit of the court
predicted the fate of the petition, as soon as it was
sent from America; for the men being known, their
measures were easily foreseen. As politicians, we
ought not so much to ground our hope on the rea∣sonableness
of the thing we ask, as on the reason∣ableness
of the person of whom we ask it; Who
would expect discretion from a fool, candor from
a tyrant, or justice from a villain?</P>
<P>As every prospect of accommodation seemed
now to fail fast, men began to think seriously on the
matter; and their reason being thus stript of the
false hope which had long encompassed it, became
approachable by fair debate; yet still the bulk of
the people hesitated; they startled at the novelty
of independence, without once considering that our
getting into arms at first was a more extraordinary
novelty, and that all other nations had gone through
the work of independence before us. They doubted,
likewise, the ability of the continent to support it,
without reflecting, that it required the same force
to obtain an accommodation by arms as an inde∣pendence.
If the one was acquirable, the other was
the same; because to accomplish either, it was ne∣cessary
that our strength should be too great for
Britain to subdue; and it was too unreasonable to
suppose, that with the power of being masters, we
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
should submit to be servants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this state of political suspense, the pamphlet <HI>Com∣mon Sense,</HI> made its appearance, and the success it met with does not become me to mention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams were severally spoken of as the supposed author: I had not, at that time, the pleasure either of personally knowing or being known to the two last gentlemen. The favor of Dr. Franklin's friendship I possessed in England, and my introduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I happened, when a school boy, to pick up a pleasing natural history of virginia, and my inclination from that day of seeing the western side of the Atlantic never left me. In Octo∣ber, seventy-five, Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials as were in his hands, towards completing a his∣tory of the present transactions, and seemed desirous of having the first volume out the next spring. I had then formed the outlines of Common Sense, and finished near∣ly the first part; and as I supposed the Doctor's design in getting out a history, was to open the new year with a new system. I expected to surprise him with a production on that subject, much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him of what I was doing, got it ready for the press as fast as I conveniently could, and ent him the first pamphlet that was printed off.</NOTE>. Their caution at
this time, was exceedingly misplaced; for if they
were able to defend their property and maintain their
rights by arms, they consequently were able to de∣fend
and support their independence; and in pro∣portion
as these men saw the necessity and righteness
of the measure, they honestly and openly declared
and adopted it, and the part they have acted since,
has done them honour, and fully established their
characters. Error in opinion has this peculiar ad∣vantage
with it, that the foremost point of the con∣trary
ground may at any time be reached by the
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
sudden exertion of a thought; and it frequently
happens in sentimental differences that some striking
circumstance, or some forcible reason, quickly
conceived, will effect in an instant what neither ar∣gument
nor example could produce in an age.</P>
<P>I find it impossible in the small compass I am
limited to, to trace out the progress which inde∣pendence
has made on the minds of the different
classes of men, and the several reasons by which
they were moved. With some, it was a passionate
abhorrence against the king of England and his mi∣nistry,
as a set of savages and brutes; and these men
governed by the agony of a wounded mind, were
for trusting every thing to hope and heaven, and
bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a
growing conviction that the scheme of the British
court was to create, ferment and drive on a quar∣rel
for the sake of confiscated plunder: Men of this
cast ripened into independence in proportion as the
evidence increased. While a third class concei∣ved
it was the true interest of America, internally
and externally, to be her own master, gave their
support to independence, step by step, as they saw
her abilities to maintain it enlarge. With many, it
was a compound of all these reasons; while those
who were too callous to be reached by either, re∣mained,
and still remain tories.</P>
<P>The legal necessity of being independent, with
several collateral reasons, is pointed out in an ele∣gant,
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
masterly manner, in a charge to the grand
jury for the district of Charlestown, by the Hon.
William Henry Drayton, Esq. chief justice of
South-Carolina. This performance, and the ad∣dress
of the convention of New-York, are pieces,
in my humble opinion, of the first rank in Ame∣rica.</P>
<P>The principal causes why independence has not
been so universally supported as it ought, are fear
and indolence, and the causes why it has been op∣posed,
are, <HI>avarice, downright villainy,</HI> and <HI>lust of
personal power.</HI> There is not such a being in Ame∣rica,
as a tory from conscience; some secret defect
or other is interwoven in the character of all those,
be they men or women, who can look with pa∣tience
on the brutality, luxury and debauchery of
the British court, and the violations of their army
here. A woman's virtue must sit very lightly on
her, who can even hint a favourable sentiment in
their behalf. It is remarkable that the whole race
of prostitutes in New-York were tories; and the
schemes for supporting the tory cause, in this city,
for which several are now in gaol, and one hanged
were concerted and carried on in common baudy∣houses,
assisted by those who kept them.</P>
<P>The connection between vice and meanness is a
fit object for satire, but when the satire is a fact, it
cuts with the irresistible power of a diamond. If a
Quaker, in defence of his just rights, his property,
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
and the chastity of his house, takes up a musket,
he is expelled the meeting; but the present king
of England, who seduced and took into keeping a
sister of their society, is reverenced and supported
with repeated testimonies, while the friendly noo∣dle
from whom she was taken (and who is now in
this city) continues a drudge in the service of his ri∣vals,
as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature
called a king.</P>
<P>Our support and success depend on such a varie∣ty
of men and circumstances, that every one, who
does but wish well, is of some use: There are men
who have a strange auk wardness to arms, yet have
hearts to risk every shilling in the cause, or in sup∣port
of those who have better talents for defending
it. Nature in the arrangement of mankind, has
fitted some for every service in life: Were all sol∣diers,
all would starve and go naked, and were
none soldiers, all would be slaves. As disaffection
to independence is the badge of a tory, so affection
to it is the mark of a whig; and the different ser∣vices
of the whigs down from those who nobly con∣tribute
every thing, to those who have nothing to
render but their wishes, tend all to the same centre,
though with different degrees of merit and ability.
The larger we make the circle, the more we shall
harmonize, and the stronger we shall be. All we
want to shut out, is disaffection, and, that excluded,
we must accept from each other such duties as we
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
are best fitted to bestow. A narrow system of po∣litics,
like a narrow system of religion is calculated
only to sour the temper, and live at variance with
mankind.</P>
<P>All we want to know in America is simply this,
who is for independence, and who is not? Those
who are for it will support it, and the remainder
will undoubtedly see the reasonableness of their pay∣ing
the charges; while those who oppose or seek to
betray it must expect the more rigid fate of the
gaol and the gibbet. There is a bastard kind of
generosity, which, by being extended to all men,
is as fatal to society, on one hand, as the want of
true generosity is on the other. A lax manner of
administering justice, falsely termed moderation,
has a tendency both to dispirit public virtue, and
promote the growth of public evils. Had the late
committee of safety taken cognizance of the last tes∣timony
of the Quakers, and proceeded against such
delinquents as were concerned therein, they had,
probably prevented the treasonable plans which have
been concerted since. When one villain is suffered
to escape, it encourages another to proceed, either
from a hope of escaping likewise, or an apprehen∣sion
that we dare not punish. It has been a matter
of general surprise, that no notice was taken of the
incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the 20th
of November last; a publication evidently intended
to promote sedition and treason, and encourage the
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
enemy, who were then within a day's march of this
city, to proceed on and possess it. I here present
the reader with a memorial, which was laid before
the board of safety a few days after the testimony
appeared. Not a member of that board, that I
conversed with, but expressed the highest detesta∣tion
of the perverted principles and conduct of the
Quaker junto, and that the board would take the
matter up; notwithstanding which, it was suffered
to pass away unnoticed, to the encouragement of
new acts of treason, the general danger of the
cause, and the disgrace of the state.<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY><DIV1 TYPE="document">
<HEAD>To the honourable the council of safety of the
state of Pennsylvania.</HEAD>
<P>At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabi∣tants
of the city of Philadelphia, impressed with a
proper sense of the justice of the cause which this
continent is engaged in, and animated with a
generous fervor for supporting the same, it was
resolved, that the following be laid before the
board of safety:</P>
<P>"We profess liberality of sentiment to all men;
with this distinction only, that those who do not de∣serve
it, would become wise and seek to deserve it.
We hold the pure doctrine of universal liberty of
conscience, and conceive it our duty to endeavour
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
to secure that sacred right to others, as well as to
defend it for ourselves; for we undertake not to
judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave
the whole matter to Him who made us.</P>
<P>"We persecute no man, neither will we abet in
the persecution of any man for religion sake; our
common relation to others, being that of fellow
citizens and fellow-subjects of one civil community;
and in this line of connection we hold out the right
hand of fellowship to all men. But we should con∣ceive
ourselves to be unworthy members of the
FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES OF
AMERICA, were we unconcernedly to see or suffer
any treasonable wound, public or private, directly or
indirectly, to be given against the peace and safety of
the same. We enquire not into the rank of the of∣fenders,
nor their religious persuasion; we have no
business with either, our part being only to find
them out, and exhibit them to justice.</P>
<P>"A printed paper, dated the 20th of November,
and signed "<HI>John Pemberton,</HI>" whom we suppose
to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately been dis∣persed
abroad, a copy of which accompanies this.
Had the framers and publishers of that paper con∣ceived
it their duty, to exhort the youth, and others,
of their society, to a patient submission under the
present trying visitations, and humbly to wait the
event of heaven towards them, they had therein
shewn a Christian temper, and we had been silent;
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
but the anger and political virulence with which
their instructions are given, and the abuse with
which they stigmatize all ranks of men, not think∣ing
like themselves, leave no doubt on our minds
from what spirit their publication proceeded: And
it is disgraceful to the pure cause of truth, that men
can dally with words of the most sacred import, and
play them as mechanically off, as if religion con∣sisted
only in contrivance. We know of no instance
in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear
arms, or do any thing which might strain their
conscience; wherefore their advice, "to withstand
and refuse to admit to the arbitrary instructions and
ordinances of men," appear to us a false alarm,
and could only be treasonably calculated to gain fa∣vour
with our enemies, when they were seemingly
on the brink of invading this state, or what is still
worse, to weaken the hands of our defence, that
their entrance into this city might be made practi∣cal
and easy.</P>
<P>"We disclaim all tumult and disorder in the
punishment of offenders; and wish to be governed
not by temper but by reason, in the manner of treat∣ing
them. We are sensible that our cause has suf∣fered
by the two following errors; first, by ill∣judged
lenity to traiterous persons in some cases;
and secondly, by only a passionate treatment of
them in others. For the future we disown both,
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
and wish to be steady in our proceedings, and serious
in our punishments.</P>
<P>"Every state in America has by the repeated
voice of its inhabitants, directed and authorized the
continental congress to publish a formal declaration
of independence of, and separation from, the op∣pressive
king and parliament of great Britain; and
we look on every man an enemy who does not in
some line or other give his assistance towards sup∣porting
the same; at the same time we consider the
offence to be heightened to a degree of unpar∣donable
guilt, when such persons, under the shew
of religion, endeavour, either by writing, speaking,
or otherwise, to subvert, overturn, or bring re∣proach
upon the independence of this continent, as
declared by congress.</P>
<P>"The publishers of the paper, signed "John
Pemberton," have called in a loud and passionate
manner on their friends and connections, "to with∣stand
and refuse" obedience to whatever "instruc∣tions
or ordinances" may be published, not war∣ranted
by (what they call) "that happy con∣stitution
under which they and others long
enjoyed tranquillity and peace." If this be
not treason, we know, not what may properly be
called by that name.</P>
<P>"To us it is a matter of surprise and astonish∣ment,
that men with the word "peace, peace"
continually on their lips, should be so fond of living
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
under, and supporting a government, and at the
same time calling it "happy," which is never bet∣ter
pleased than when at war—that hath filled In∣dia
with carnage and famine—Africa with slavery—
and tampered with Indians and Negroes to cut the
throats of the freemen of America. We conceive
it a disgrace to this state, to harbour or wink at such
palpable hypocrisy. But as we seek not to hurt the
hair of any man's head, when we can make our∣selves
safe without, we wish such persons to restore
peace to themselves and us, by removing themselves
to some part of the king of Great Britain's domi∣nions,
as by that means they may live unmolested
by us, or we by them; for our fixed opinion is, that
those who do not deserve a place among us, ought
not to have one.</P>
<P>"We conclude, with requesting the council of
safety to take into their consideration the paper
signed "John Pemberton; and if it shall appear to
them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a trea∣sonable
nature, that they would commit the signer,
together with such other persons as they can disco∣ver
were concerned therein, into custody, until
such time as some mode of trial shall ascertain the
full degree of their guilt and punishment; in the
doing of which, we wish their judges, whoever
they may be, to disregard the man, his connections,
interest, riches, poverty, or principles of religion,
and to attend to the nature of his offence only."</P>

<P><PB N="96" REF="98"/>
THE most cavilling sectarian cannot accuse the
foregoing with containing the least ingredient of
persecution. The free spirit on which the Ameri∣can
cause is founded, disdains to mix with such an
impurity, and leave it a rubbish fit only for narrow
and suspicious minds to grovel in: Suspicion and
persecution are weeds of the same dunghill, and
flourish best together. Had the Quakers minded
their religion and their business, they might have
lived through this dispute in enviable ease, and
none would have molested them. The common
phrase with these people is, "<HI>Our principles are
peace.</HI>" To which may be replied, <HI>and your prac∣tices
are the reverse</HI>; for never did the conduct of
men oppose their own doctrine more notoriously
than the present race of the Quakers. They have
artfully changed themselves into a different sort of
people to what they used to be, and yet have the
address to persuade each other they are not altered;
like antiquated virgins they see not the havoc de∣formity
hath made upon them, but pleasantly mis∣taking
wrinkles for dimples, conceit themselves yet
lovely, and wonder at the stupid world for not ad∣miring
them.</P>
<P>Did no injury arise to the public by this apostacy
of the Quakers from themselves, the public would
have nothing to do with it: but as both the design
and consequences are pointed against a cause in
which the whole community are interested, it is
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
therefore no longer a subject confined to the cogni∣zance
of the meeting only, but comes as a matter of
criminality before either the authority of the parti∣cular
state <HI>in which</HI> it is acted, or of the continent
<HI>against which</HI> it operates. Every attempt now to
support the authority of the king and parliament of
Great Britain over America, is treason against <HI>every</HI>
state; therefore it is impossible that any <HI>one</HI> can
pardon or screen from punishment, an offender
against <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed: While the infatuated tories of
this and other states were last spring talking of com∣missioners,
accommodation, making the matter up,
and the Lord knows what stuff and nonsense, their
<HI>good</HI> king and ministry were glutting themselves
with the revenge of reducing America to <HI>uncondi∣tional
submission,</HI> and solacing each other with the
certainty of conquering it in <HI>one campaign.</HI> The
following quotations are from the parliamentary re∣gister
of the debates of the house of lords, March
5th, 1776.</P>
<P>"The Americans," says Lord <HI>Talbot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Steward of the king's houshold.</NOTE> "have
been obstinate, undutiful and ungovernable from
the very beginning, from their first early and infant
settlements; and I am every day more and more
convinced that this people will never be brought
back to their duty, and the subordinate relation they
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
stand in to this country, till <HI>reduced to an uncondi∣tional
effectual submission</HI>; <HI>no concession on our part,</HI>
<HI>no lenity, no endurance,</HI> will have any other effect
but that of increasing their insolence."</P>
<P>"The struggle," says Lord <HI>Townsend</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Formerly General Townsend at Quebec, and late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.</NOTE> "is now
a struggle for power; the die is cast, and the ONLY
POINT which now remains to be determined, is,
in what manner the war can be most effectually
prosecuted and speedily finished, in order to pro∣cure
that <HI>unconditional submission,</HI> which has been so
able stated by the noble Earl with the white staff
(meaning lord Talbot); and I have no reason to
doubt that the measures now pursuing will put an
end to the war in the course of a SINGLE CAM∣PAIGN.
Should it linger longer, we shall then
have reason to expect that some foreign power will
interfere, and take advantage of our domestic trou∣bles
and civil distractions."</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Littleton.</HI> "My sentiments are pretty
well known. I shall only observe now, that le∣nient
measures have had no other effect than to
produce insult after insult; that the more we con∣ceded,
the higher America rose in her demands,
and the more insolent she has grown. It is for this
reason that I am now for the most effective and
decisive measures; and am of opinion, that no al∣ternative
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
is left us, but to relinquish America for
ever, or finally determine to compel her to ac∣knowledge
the legislative authority of this country;
and it is the principle of an <HI>unconditional submission</HI>
I would be for maintaining."</P>
<P>Can words be more expressive than these.
Surely the tories will believe the tory lords! The
truth is, they <HI>do believe them,</HI> and know as fully as
any whig on the continent knows, that the king and
ministry never had the least design of an accommo∣dation
with America, but an absolute unconditional
conquest. And the part which the tories were to
act, was, by downright lying, to endeavour to put
the continent off its guard, and to divide and sow
discontent in the minds of such whigs as they might
gain an influence over. In short, to keep up a
distraction here, that the force sent from England
might be able to conquer in "<HI>one campaign.</HI>"
They and the ministry were, by a dsifferent game,
playing into each others hands. The cry of the
tories in England was, "<HI>No reconciliation, no ac∣commodation,</HI>"
in order to obtain the greater military
force; while those in America were crying nothing
but "<HI>reconciliation and accommodation,</HI>" that the
force sent might conquer with the less resistance.</P>
<P>But <HI>this</HI> "<HI>single campaign</HI>" is over, and America
not conquered. The whole work is yet to do, and
the force much less to do it with. Their condition
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
is both despicable and deplorable: Out of cash—out
of heart, and out of hope. A country furnished
with arms and ammunition, as America now is,
with three millions of inhabitants, and three thou∣sand
miles distant from the nearest enemy that can
approach her, is able to look and laugh them in the
face.</P>
<P>Howe appears to have two objects in view,
either to go up the North-river, or come to Phila∣delphia.
By going up the North-river, he secures
a retreat for his army through Canada, but the ships
must return if they return at all, the same way they
went; and as our army would be in the rear, the
safety of their passage down is a doubtful matter.
By such a motion, he shuts himself from all supplies
from Europe, but through Canada, and exposes
his army and navy to the danger of perishing. The
idea of his cutting off the communication between
the eastern and southern states, by means of the
North-river, is merely visionary. He cannot do it
by his shipping; because no ship can lay long at
anchor in any river within reach of the shore; a
single gun would drive a first rate from such a sta∣tion.
This was fully proved last October, at fort
Washington and Lee, where one gun only, on each
side the river, obliged two frigates to cut and be
towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it
off by his army; because the several posts they
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
must occupy, would divide them almost to nothing,
and expose them to be picked up by ours like peb∣bles
on a river's bank; but admitting he could,
where is the injury? Because while his whole
force is cantoned out, as centries over the water,
they will be very innocently employed, and the
moment they march into the country, the commu∣nication
opens.</P>
<P>The most probable object is Philadelphia, and
the reasons are many. Howe's business in Ame∣rica
is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds
himself unable to the task, he will employ his
strength to distress women and weak minds, in or∣der
to accomplish through <HI>their</HI> fears, what he
cannot effect by his <HI>own</HI> force. His coming, or
attempting to come to Philadelphia, is a circum∣stance
that proves his weakness: For no general,
that felt himself able to take the field and attack his
antagonist, would think of bringing his army into a
city in the summer time; and this mere shifting
the scene from place to place, without effecting any
thing, has feebleness and cowardice on the face of
it, and holds him up in a contemptible light to any
one who can reason justly and firmly. By several
informations from New York, it appears that their
army in general, both officers and men, have given
up the expectation of conquering America; their
eye now is fixt upon the spoil. They suppose Phi∣ladelphia
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
to be rich with stores, and as they think
to get more by robbing a town, than by attacking
an army, their movement towards this city is pro∣bable
We are not now contending against an
army of soldiers, but against a band of thieves, who
had rather plunder than fight, and have no other
hope of conquest than by cruelty.</P>
<P>They expect to get a mighty booty and strike
another general panic by making a sudden move∣ment
and getting possession of this city, but un∣less
they can march <HI>out</HI> as well as <HI>in,</HI> or get the
entire command of the river, to remove off their
plunder, they may probably be stopt with the stolen
goods upon them. They have never yet suc∣ceeded
wherever they have been opposed but at
fort Washington. At Charleston their defeat was
effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In
every skirmish at Kingsbridge and the White-Plains
they were obliged to retreat, and the instant
our arms were turned upon them in the Jerseys,
they turned likewise, and those that turned not
were taken.</P>
<P>The necessity of always fitting our internal police
to the circumstances of the times we live in, is
something so strikingly obvious, that no sufficient
objection can be made against it. The safety of all
societies depend upon it; and where this point is
not attended to, the consequences will either be a
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
general languor or a tumult. The encourage∣ment
and protection of the good subjects of any
state, and the suppression and punishment of bad
ones, are the principal objects for which all au∣thority
is instituted, and the line in which it ought
to operate. We have in this city a strange variety
of men and characters, and the circumstances of
the times require they should be publicly known;
it is not the number of tories that hurt us, so much
as the not finding out who they are; men must
now take one side or the other, and abide by the
consequences: The quakers, trusting to their short∣sighted
sagacity, have, most unluckily for them,
made their declaration in their last testimony, and
we ought <HI>now</HI> to take them at their word. They
have voluntarily read themselves out of the con∣tinental
meeting, and cannot hope to be restored
to it again, but by payment and penitence. Men
whose political principles are founded on avarice,
are beyond the reach of reason, and the only cure
of toryism of this cast, is to tax it. A substantial
good drawn from a real evil, is of the same benefit
to society, as if drawn from a virtue; and where
men have not public spirit to render themselves ser∣viceable,
it ought to be the study of government
to draw the best use possible from their vices. When
the governing passion of any man or set of men is
once known, the method of managing them is
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
easy; for even misers, whom no public virtue can
impress, would become generous, could a heavy
tax be laid upon covetousness.</P>
<P>The tories have endeavoured to insure their pro∣perty
with the enemy, by forfeiting their reputa∣tion
with us; from which may be justly inferred,
that their governing passion is avarice. Make them
as much afraid of losing on one side as the other,
and you stagger their toryism; make them more
so, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to
worship any power they are most afraid of.</P>
<P>This method of considering men and things toge∣ther,
opens into a large field for speculation, and
affords me opportunity of offering some observa∣tions
on the state of our currency, so as to make the
support of it go hand in hand with the suppression
of disaffection, and the encouragement of public
spirit.</P>
<P>The thing which first presents itself in inspecting
the state of the currency is, that we have too much
of it, and that there is a necessity of reducing the
quantity, in order to increase the value. Men are
daily growing poor by the very means they take to
get rich, for in the same proportion that the prices
of all goods on hand are raised, the value of all mo∣ney
laid by, is reduced. A simple case will make
this clear: Let a man have one hundred pounds
cash, and as many goods on hand as will to-day sell
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
for 20l. but not content with the present market
price, he raises them to 40, and by so doing, obli∣ges
others in their own defence to raise cent per
cent likewise; in this case, it is evident that his hun∣dred
pounds laid by is reduced fifty pounds in va∣lue;
whereas, had the markets dropt cent per cent,
his goods would have sold but for ten, but his hun∣dren
pounds would have risen in value to two hun∣dred;
because it would then purchase as many goods
again, or support his family as long again as before.
And strange as it may seem, he is one hundred and
fifty pounds the poorer for raising his goods, to
what he would have been had he lowered them;
because the forty pounds his goods sold for, is by
the general rise of the markets, cent per cent, ren∣dered
of no more value than the ten pounds would
be, had the market fallen in the same proportion:
and consequently the whole difference of gain or loss
is on the different values of the hundred pounds
laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage
for raising goods is, for several reasons, much more
the fault of the tories than the whigs; and yet the
tories (to their shame and confusion ought they to
be told of it) are by far the most noisy and discon∣tented.
The greatest part of the whigs, by being
now either in the army, or employed in some pub∣lic
service, are <HI>buyers</HI> only, and not <HI>sellers</HI>; and as
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
this evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged
on those who are out of it.</P>
<P>But the grievance is now become too general to
be remedied by partial methods, and the only effec∣tual
cure is to reduce the quantity of money; with
half the quantity we should be richer than we are
now, because the value of it would be doubled, and
consequently our attachment to it increased; for it
is not the number of dollars a man has, but how far
they will go, that makes him either rich or poor.</P>
<P>These two points being admitted, viz. that the
quantity of money is too great, and that the prices
of goods can be only effectually reduced by redu∣cing
the quantity of the money; the next point to be
considered is, the method how to reduce it?</P>
<P>The circumstances of the times, as before ob∣served,
require that the public characters of all men
should <HI>now</HI> be fully understood, and the only gene∣ral
method of ascertaining it, is by an oath or affir∣mation,
renouncing all allegiance to the king of
Great Britain, and to support the independency of
the United States, as declared by Congress. Let,
at the same time, a tax of ten, fifteen or twenty per
cent per annum, to be collected quarterly, be levied
on all property. These alternatives, by being per∣fectly
voluntary, will take in all sorts of people.
Here is the test; here is the tax. He who takes
the former, conscientiously proves his affection to
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
the cause, and binds himself to pay his quota by
the best <HI>services</HI> in his power, and is thereby justly
exempt from the latter; and those who chuse the
latter, pay their quota in money, to be excused
from taking the former, or rather 'tis the price
paid to us for their supposed, though mistaken
insurance with the enemy.</P>
<P>But this is only a part of the advantage which
would arise by knowing the different characters of
men. The whigs stake every thing on the issue of
their arms, while the tories, by their disaffection,
are sapping and undermining their strength, and,
of consequence, the property of the whigs is the
more exposed thereby; and whatever injury their
estates may sustain by the movements of the enemy,
must either be borne by themselves, who have done
every thing which has <HI>yet</HI> been done, or by the to∣ries,
who have not only done nothing, but have, by
their disaffection, invited the enemy on.</P>
<P>In the present crisis, we ought to know square by
square, and house by house, who are in real allegi∣ance
with the United Independent States, and who
are not. Let but the line be made clear and dis∣tinct,
and all men will then know what they are to
trust to. It would not only be good policy, but
strict justice, to raise fifty or a hundred thousand
pounds, or more, if it is necessary, out of the estates
and property of the king of England's votaries, resi∣dent
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
in Philadelphia, to be distributed, as a reward
to those inhabitants of the city and state, who should
turn out and repulse the enemy, should they at∣tempt
their march this way; and likewise, to bind
the property of all such persons to make good the
damages which that of the whigs might sustain. In
the undistinguishable mode of conducting a war, we
frequently make reprisals at sea, on the vessels of
persons in England who are friends to our cause,
compared with the residentary tories among us.</P>
<P>In every former publication of mine, from Com∣mon
sense down to the last Crisis, I have generally
gone on the charitable supposition, that the tories
were rather a mistaken than a criminal people, and
have applied argument after argument with all the
candor and temper I was capable of, in order to set
every part of the case clearly and fairly before them,
and if possible, to reclaim them from ruin to rea∣son.
I have done my duty by them, and have
now done with that doctrine, taking it for granted,
that those who yet hold their disaffection, are either
a set of avaricious miscreants, who would sacrifice
the continent to save themselves, or a banditti of
hungry traitors, who are hoping for a division of the
spoil. To which may be added, a list of crown
or proprietary dependants, who, rather than go
without a portion of power, would be content to
share it with the devil. Of such men there is no
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
hope; and their obedience will only be according
to the danger that is set before them, and the power
that is exercised over them.</P>
<P>A time will shortly arrive, in which by ascertain∣ing
the characters of persons now, we shall be
guarded against their mischiefs then; so in pro∣portion
as the enemy despair of conquest, they
will be trying the arts of seduction and the force
of fear, by all the mischiefs they can inflict. But in
war we may be certain of these two things, viz.
that cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with
more than usual parade, are always signs of weak∣ness.
He that can conquer, finds his mind too free
and pleasant to be brutish; and he that intends to
conquer, never makes too much show of his
strength.</P>
<P>We now know the enemy we have to do with.
While drunk with the certainty of victory, they
disdained to be civil; and in proportion as disap∣pointment
makes them sober, and their apprehen∣sions
of an European war alarm them, they will be∣come
cringing and artful; honest they cannot be.</P>
<P>But our answer to them, in either condition they
may be in, is short and full, "As free and inde∣pendent
states, we are willing to make peace with
you to-morrow, but we can neither hear nor reply
in any other character."</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>
If Britain cannot conquer us, it proves, that she
is neither able to govern or protect us, and our par∣ticular
situation now is such, that any connexion
with her would be unwisely exchanging a half de∣feated
enemy for two powerful ones. Europe, by
every appearance and information, is now on the
eve, nay, on the morning twilight of a war, and any
alliance with <HI>George the Third,</HI> brings <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Spain</HI> upon our backs; a separation from him at∣tach
them to our side; therefore, the only road to
<HI>peace, honour,</HI> and commerce, is INDEPEND∣ENCE.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Sept. 12, 1777.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who expect to reap the blessings of
freedom, must, like men, undergo the fatigues of
supporting it. The event of Yesterday is one of
those kind of alarms which is just sufficient to rouse
us to duty, without being of consequence enough
to depress our fortitude. It is not a field of a few
acres of ground, but a cause we are defending, and
whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by
degrees, the consequence will be the same.</P>
<P>Look back at the events of last winter and the
present year; there you will find that the enemy's
successes have always contributed to reduce them.
What they have gained in ground, they paid so
dearly for in numbers, that their victories have in
the end amounted to defeats. We have always
been masters at the last push, and always shall, while
we do our duty. Howe has been once on the
banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven
back with loss and disgrace; and why not be again
driven from the Schuylkill? His condition and
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
ours are very different. He has every body to
fight, we have only his <HI>one</HI> army to cope with,
and which wastes away at every engagement; we
can not only reinforce, but can redouble our num∣bers;
he is cut off from all supplies, and must sooner
or later inevitably fall into our hands.</P>
<P>Shall a band of ten or twelve thousand robbers,
who are this day fifteen hundred or two thousand
men less in strength than they were yesterday, con∣quer
America, or subdue even a single state? The
thing cannot be, unless we sit down and suffer them
to do it. Another such a brush, notwithstanding
we lost the ground, would, by still reducing the
enemy, put them in a condition to be afterwards
totally defeated.</P>
<P>Could our whole army have come up to the at∣tack
at one time, the consequences had probably
been otherwise; but our having different parts of
the Brandywine-creek to guard, and the uncertainty
which road to Philadelphia the enemy would at∣tempt
to take, naturally afforded them an opportu∣nity
of passing with their main body at a place
where only a part of ours could be posted; for it
must strike every thinking man with conviction,
that it requires a much greater force to oppose an
enemy in several places, than is sufficient to defeat
in any one place.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115"/>
Men who are sincere in defending their freedom,
will always feel concern at every circumstance
which seems to make against them; it is the natural
and honest consequence of all affectionate attach∣ments,
and the want of it is a vice. But the de∣jection
lasts only for a moment; they soon rise out
of it with additional vigour; the glow of hope,
courage and fortitude, will, in a little time supply
the place of every inferior passion, and kindle the
whole heart into heroism.</P>
<P>There is a mystery in the countenance of some
causes, which we have not always present judg∣ment
enough to explain. It is distressing to see an
enemy advancing into a country, but it is the only
place in which we can beat them, and in which we
have always beaten them, whenever they made the
attempt. The nearer any disease approaches to
a crisis, the nearer it is to a cure. Danger and de∣liverance
make their advances together, and it is
only the last push, that one or the other takes the
lead.</P>
<P>There are many men who will do their duty
when it is not wanted; but a genuine public spirit
always appear most, when there is most occasion for
it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet
entire. The attack made by us yesterday, was un∣der
many disadvantages, naturally arising from the
uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy
would take; and from that circumstance, the whole
of our force could not be brought up together
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
time enough to engage all at once. Our strength
is yet reserved; and it is evident that Howe does
not think himself a gainer by the affair, otherwise
he would this morning have moved down and at∣tacked
General Washington.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the city and country, it is in your
power, by a spirited improvement of the present
circumstance, to turn it to a real advantage. Howe
is now weaker than before, and every shot will con∣tribute
to reduce him. You are more immediately
interested than any other part of the continent;
your all is at a stake; it is not so with the general
cause; you are devoted by the enemy to plunder
and destruction: It is the encouragement which
Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promised his
army. Thus circumstanced, you may save your∣selves
by a manly resistance, but you can have no
hope in any other conduct. I never yet knew our
brave general, or any part of the army, officers or
men, out of heart, and I have seen them in circum∣stances
a thousand times more trying than the pre∣sent.
It is only those that are not in action, that
feel languor and heaviness, and the best way to rub
it off, is to turn out, and make sure work of it.</P>
<P>Our army must undoubtedly feel fatigue, and
want a reinforcement of rest, though not of valour.
Our own interest and happiness call upon us to give
them every support in our power, and make the
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
burden of the day, on which the safety of this city
depends, light as possible. Remember, gentle∣men,
that we have forces both to the northward
and southward of Philadelphia, and if the enemy be
but stopt till those can arrive, this city will be saved,
and the enemy finally routed. You have too
much at stake to hesitate. You ought not to think
an hour on the matter, but to spring to action at
once. Other states have been invaded, have like∣wise
driven off the invaders. Now our time
and turn is come, and perhaps the finishing
stroke is reserved for us. When we look back on
the dangers we have been saved from, and reflect
on the success we have been blessed with, it would
be sinful either to be idle or despair.</P>
<P>I close this paper with a short address to General
Howe. You, sir, are only lingering out the period
that shall bring with it your defeat. You have
yet scarce began upon the war, and the farther you
enter, the faster will your troubles thicken. What
you now enjoy is only a respite from ruin; an in∣vitation
to destruction: something that will lead
on to our deliverance at your expence. We know
the cause we are engaged in, and though a passion∣ate
fondness for it may make us grieve at every
injury that threatens it, yet, when the moment of
concern is over, the determination to duty returns.
We are not moved by the gloomy smile of a worth∣less
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
king, but by the ardent glow of generous
patriotism. We fight not to enslave, but to set a
country free, and to make room upon the earth for
honest men to live in. In such a cause, we are
sure we are right; and we leave to you, the de∣spairing
reflection of being the tool of a miserable
tyrant.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. VI.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To General Sir William Howe.</HEAD>
<P>TO argue with a man who has renounced the
use and authority of reason, and whose philosophy
consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like
administering medicines to the dead, or endeavour∣ing
to convert an atheist by scripture. Enjoy, sir,
your insensibility of feeling and reflecting. It is
the prerogative of animals. And no man will en∣vy
you those honours, in which a savage only can
be your rival, and a bear your master.</P>
<P>As the generosity of this country, rewarded your
brother's services last war with an elegant monu∣ment
in Westminster Abbey, it is consistent that
she should bestow some mark of distinction upon
you. You certainly deserve her notice, and a con∣spicuous
place in the catalogue of extraordinary
persons. Yet it would be a pity to pass you from
the world in state, and consign you to magnificent
oblivion among the tombs, without telling the fu∣ture
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
beholder why. Judas is as much known as
John, yet history ascribes their fame to very differ∣ent
actions.</P>
<P>Sir William hath undoubtedly merited a monu∣ment:
But of what kind? or of what inscription?
where placed? or how embellished? is a question
that would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's, in
the profoundest mood of historical deliberation.
We are at no loss, sir, to ascertain your real charac∣ter,
but somewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its
identity, and preserve it uninjured from the trans∣formations
of time or mistake. A statuary may
give a false expression to your bust, or decorate
it with some equivocal emblems, by which you may
happen to steal into reputation, and impose upon
the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature, or
ridicule may conspire, or a variety of accidents com∣bine
to lessen, enlarge or change Sir William's
fame; and no doubt, but he who has taken so much
pains to be singular in his conduct, would choose
to be as singular in his exit, his monument and his
epitaph.</P>
<P>The usual honours of the dead, to be sure, are
not sufficiently sublime to escort a character like
you to the republic of dust and ashes; for however
men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or
government here, the grave is nevertheless a per∣fect
republic. Death is not the monarch of the
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains
a conquest, he loses a subject, and, like the foolish
king you serve, will, in the end, war himself out of
all dominion.</P>
<P>As a proper preliminary towards the arrange∣ment
of your funeral honours, we readily admit
your new rank of <HI>knighthood.</HI> The title is perfectly
in character, and is your own, more by merit than
creation. There are knights of various orders
from the knight of the windmill, to the knight of
the post. The former is your patron for exploits,
and the latter will assist you in settling your accounts.
No honourary title could be more happily applied!
The ingenuity is sublime! And your royal master
hath discovered more genius in fitting you there∣with,
than in generating the most finished figure
for a button, or descanting on the properties of a
button mould.</P>
<P>But how, sir, shall we dispose of you? The
invention of a statuary is exhausted, and Sir Wil∣liam
is yet unprovided with a monument. America
is anxious to bestow her funeral favours upon you,
and wishes to do it in a manner that shall distinguish
you from all the deceased heroes of the last war.
The <HI>Egyptian method of embalming</HI> is not known
to the present age, and hieroglyphical pageantry
hath out lived the science of decyphering it. Some
other method, therefore, must be thought of to
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
immortalize the new knight of the windmill and
post. Sir William, thanks to his stars, is not op∣pressed
with very delicate ideas. He has no am∣bition
of being wrapt up and handed about in
myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Less chargeable odours
will suffice; and it fortunately happens, that the
simple genius of America, hath discovered the art
of preserving bodies, and embellishing them too,
with much greater frugality than the ancients. In
a balmage, sir, of humble tar, you will be as secure
as Pharoah, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival
in finery all the mummies of Egypt.</P>
<P>As you have already made your exit from the
moral world, and by numberless acts both of pas∣sionate
and deliberate injustice engraved an "<HI>Here
Lyeth</HI>" on your deceased honour, it must be mere
affectation in you to pretend concern at the hu∣mours
or opinions of mankind respecting you.
What remains of you may expire at any time.
The sooner the better. For he who survives his
reputation, lives out of spite to himself like a man
listening to his own reproach.</P>
<P>Thus entombed and ornamented I leave you to
the inspection of the curious, and return to the
history of your yet surviving actions.—The
character of Sir William hath undergone some ex∣traordinary
revolutions since his arrival in America.
It is now fixed and known; and we have nothing
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
to hope from your candour or to fear from your
capacity. Indolence and inability have too large
a share in your composition ever to suffer you to
be any thing more than the hero of little villanies
and unfinished adventures. That, which to some
persons appeared moderation in you at first, was
not produced by any real virtue of your own, but
by a contrast of passions dividing and holding you
in perpetual irresolution. One vice will frequent∣ly
expel another without the least merit in the man,
as powers in contrary directions reduce each other
to rest.</P>
<P>It became you to have supported a dignified
solemnity of character; to have shewn a superior
liberality of soul; to have won respect by an ob∣stinate
perseverance in maintaining order, and to
have exhibited on all occasions, such an unchange∣able
graciousness of conduct, that while we beheld
in you the resolution of an enemy, we might ad∣mire
in you the sincerity of a man. You came to
America under the high sounding titles of com∣mander
and commissioner; not only to suppress
what you called rebellion by arms, but to shame it
out of countenance by the excellence of your ex∣ample.
Instead of which, you have been the pa∣tron
of low and vulgar frauds, the encourager of
Indian cruelties, and have imported a cargo of
vices blacker than those you pretend to suppress.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124"/>
Mankind are not universally agreed in their de∣termination
of right and wrong; but there are cer∣tain
actions which the consent of all nations and in∣dividuals
hath branded with the unchangeable name
of MEANNESS. In the list of human vices we
find some of such a refined constitution, that they
cannot be carried into practice without seducing
some virtue to their assistance; but <HI>meanness</HI> hath
neither alliance nor apology. It is generated in
the dust and sweepings of other vices, and is of
such a hateful figure that all the rest conspire to
disown it. Sir William, the commissioner of
George the Third, hath at last vouchsafed to give
it rank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive
at the council board, and dubbed it companion of
the order of knighthood.</P>
<P>The particular act of meanness which I allude to
in this description, is forgery. You, sir, have abet∣ted
and patronized the forging and uttering counter∣feit
continental bills. In the same New-York
newspapers in which your own proclamation under
your master's authority was published, offering, or
pretending to offer, pardon and protection to the
inhabitants of these states, there were repeated ad∣vertisements
of counterfeit money for sale, and
persons who have come officially from you and
under sanction of your flag, have been taken up in
attempting to put them off.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125"/>
A conduct so basely mean in a public character
is without precedent or pretence. Every nation on
earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite in
despising you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon so∣ciety
which nothing can excuse or palliate—An
improvement upon beggarly villany—and shews an
inbred wretchedness of heart made up between the
venomous malignity of a serpent and the spiteful
imbecility of an inferior reptile.</P>
<P>The laws of any civilized country would con∣demn
you to the gibbet without regard to your
rank or titles, because it is an action foreign to the
usage and custom of war; and should you fall into
our hands, which pray God you may, it will be a
doubtful matter whether we are to consider you as
a military prisoner or a prisoner for felony.</P>
<P>Besides, it is exceedingly unwise and impolitic in
you, or any persons in the English service, to pro∣mote,
or even encourage, or wink, at the crime
of forgery in any case whatever. Because, as the
riches of England, as a nation, are chiefly in paper,
and the far greater part of trade among individuals
is carried on by the same medium, that is, by notes
and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all
people in the world ought to endeavour to keep
forgery out of sight, and, if possible, not to re∣vive
the idea of it. It is dangerous to make men
familiar with a crime which they may afterwards
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
practise to much greater advantage against those
who first taught them. Several officers in the
English army have made their exit at the gallows
for forgery on their agents; for we all know, who
know any thing of England, that there is not a
more necessitous body of men, taking them ge∣nerally,
than what the English officers are. They
contrive to make a shew at the expence of the
taylor, and appear clean at the charge of the
washer-woman.</P>
<P>England hath at this time nearly two hundred
million pounds sterling of public money in paper,
for which she hath no real property, besides a large
circulation of bank notes, bank post bills, and
promissory notes and drafts of private bankers,
merchants, and tradesmen. She hath the greatest
quantity of paper currency and the least quantity of
gold and silver of any nation in Europe; the real
specie, which is about sixteen millions sterling,
serve only as change in large sums, which are al∣ways
made in paper, or for payment in small ones.
Thus circumstanced, the nation is put to its wit's
end, and obliged to be severe almost to criminality,
to prevent the practice and growth of forgery.
Scarcely a session passes at the Old Bailey, or an
execution at Tyburn, but witnesseth this truth. Yet
you, sir, regardless of the policy which her neces∣sity
obliges her to adopt, have made your whole
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
army intimate with the crime. And as all armies,
at the conclusion of a war, are too apt to carry into
practice the vices of the campaign, it will probably
happen, that England will hereafter abound in for∣geries,
to which art, the practitioners were first
initiated under your authority in America. You,
sir, have the honour of adding a new vice to the
military catalogue; and the reason, perhaps, why
the invention was reserved for you is, because no
general before was mean enough even to think
of it.</P>
<P>That a man whose soul is absorbed in the low
traffic of vulgar vice, is incapable of moving in any
superior region, is clearly shewn in you by the
event of every campaign. Your military exploits
have been without plan, object or decision. Can
it be possible that you or your employers can sup∣pose
the possession of Philadelphia to be any ways
equal to the expence or expectation of the nation
which supports you? What advantages does En∣gland
derive from any achievements of yours? To
<HI>her</HI> it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in,
so long as the business of conquest is unperformed,
and the charge of maintaining you remains the
same.</P>
<P>If the principal events of the three campaigns be
attended to, the balance will appear strongly against
you at the close of each; but the last, in point of
importance to us, hath exceeded the former two.
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
It is pleasant to look back on dangers past, and
equally as pleasant to meditate on present ones,
when the way out begins to appear. <HI>That</HI> period is
now arrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is
changing to the sweeter prospects of victory and
joy. At the close of the campaign in seventy-five,
you were obliged to retreat from Boston. In the
summer of seventy-six, you appeared with a numer∣ous
fleet and army in the harbour of New York.
By what miracle the Continent was preserved in
that season of danger is a subject of admiration!
If instead of wasting your time against Long Island,
you had run up the North River, and landed any
where above New York, the consequence must
have been, that either you would have compelled
General Washington to fight you with very un∣equal
numbers, or he must have suddenly evacuated
the city, with the loss of nearly all the stores of the
army, or have surrendered for the want of provi∣sions,
the situation of the place naturally producing
one or other of these events.</P>
<P>The preparations made to defend New York,
were, nevertheless, wise and military; because
your forces were then at sea, their numbers uncer∣tain;
storms, sickness, or variety of accidents might
have disabled their coming, or so diminished them
on their passage, that those which survived, would
have been incapable of opening the campaign with
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
any prospect of success; in which case, the defence
would have been sufficient, and the place preserved;
for cities that have been raised from nothing with
an infinitude of labour and expence, are not to be
thrown away on the bear probability of their be∣ing
taken. On these grounds, the preparations
made to maintain New York were as judicious as
the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim,
let slip the <HI>very</HI> opportunity, which seemed to put
conquest in your power.</P>
<P>Through the whole of that campaign you had
nearly double the forces which General Washing∣ton
immediately commanded. The principal
plan, at that time, on our part, was to wear away
the season with as little loss as possible, and to raise
the army for the next year. Long-Island, New-York,
Forts Washington and Lee, were not de∣fended,
after your superior force was known, under
any expectation of their being finally main∣tained,
but as a range of out works, in the attack∣ing
of which, your time might be wasted, your num∣bers
reduced, and your vanity amused by possessing
them on our retreat. It was intended to have
withdrawn the garrison from Fort Washington,
after it had answered the former of those purposes,
but the fate of that day put a prize into your hands
without much honour to yourselves.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>
Your progress through the Jersesy, was accidental;
you had it not even in contemplation, or you would
not have sent so principal a part of your force to
Rhode Island before hand. The utmost hope
of America in the year seventy six reached no
higher than that she might not <HI>then</HI> be conquered.
She had no expectation of defeating you in that
campaign. Even the most cowardly tory allowed,
that, could she withstand the shock of <HI>that</HI> sum∣mer,
her independence would be past a doubt. You
had <HI>then</HI> greatly the advantage of her. You were
formidable. Your military knowledge was sup∣posed
to be complete. Your fleets and forces
arrived without an accident. You had neither ex∣perience
nor reinforcements to wait for. You had
nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in
the first vigorous onset,</P>
<P>America was young and unskilled. She was
obliged to trust her defence to time and practice;
and hath, by mere dint of perseverance, maintained
her cause, and brought her enemy to a condition,
in which, she is now capable of meeting him on
any grounds.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in the campaign of seventy-six,
you gained no more notwithstanding your great
force, than what was given you by consent of
evacuation, except Fort Washington: while every
advantage obtained by us, was by fair and hard
fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
complete. The conquest of the Hessians at Tren∣ton
by the remains of a retreating army, which but
a few days before, you affected to despise, is an
instance of heroic perseverance, very seldom to be
met with. And the victory over the British troops
at Princetown, by a harrassed and wearied party,
who had been engaged the day before, and marched
all night without refreshment, is attended with such
a scene of circumstances and superiority of general∣ship,
as will ever give it a place on the first line in
the history of great actions.</P>
<P>When I look back on the gloomy days of last
winter, and see America suspended by a thread, I
feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her de∣livery,
and a reverence for the characters which
snatched her from destruction. To doubt <HI>now,</HI>
would be a species of infidelity, and to forget the
instruments which saved us <HI>then,</HI> would be ingrati∣tude.</P>
<P>The close of that campaign, left us with the spi∣rits
of conquerors. The northern districts were
relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over
the lakes. The army under your command were
hunted back, and had their bounds prescribed. The
Continent began to feel its military importance,
and the winter passed pleasantly away in prepara∣tions
for the next campaign.</P>
<P>However confident you might be on your first
arrival, the course of the year seventy six, gave
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
you some idea of the difficulty, if not impossibility
of conquest. To this reason, I ascribe your delay
in opening the campaign in seventy seven. The
face of matters, on the close of the sormer year,
gave you no encouragement to pursue a discre∣tionary
war as soon as the spring admitted the ta∣king
the field: for, though conquest in that case,
would have given you a double portion of fame,
yet the experiment was too hazardous. The mi∣nistry,
had you sailed, would have shifted the whole
blame upon you, charged you with having acted
without orders, and condemned at once, both your
plan and execution.</P>
<P>To avoid those misfortunes, which might have
involved you, and your money accounts in per∣plexity,
and suspicion, you prudently waited the
arrival of a plan of operations from England,
which was, that you should proceed to Philadel∣phia
by the way of Chesapeak, and that Burgoyne,
after reducing Ticonderoga, should take his route
by Albany, and, if necessary, join you.</P>
<P>The splendid laurels of last campaign have flou∣rished
in the north. In that quarter America hath
surprized the world, and laid the foundation of her
this year's glory. The conquest of Ticonderoga
(if it may be called a conquest) has, like all your
other victories, led on to ruin. Even the provi∣sions
taken in that fortress, (which by General Bur∣goyne's
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
return was sufficent in bread and flour for
nearly 5000 men, for ten weeks, and in beef and
pork for the same number of men for one month)
served only to hasten his overthrow, by enabling
him to proceed for Saratoga, the place of his de∣struction.
A short review of the operations of the
last campaign, will shew the condition of affairs on
both sides.</P>
<P>You have taken Ticonderoga, and marched into
Philadelphia. These are all the events which the
year hath produced on your part. A trifling cam∣paign
indeed, compared with the expences of Eng∣land,
and the conquest of the continent. On the
other side, a considerable part of your northern
force has been routed by the New York militia,
under General Herkemer. Fort Stanwix hath
bravely survived a compounded attack of soldiers
and savages, and the besiegers have fled. The
battle of Bennington has put a thousand prisoners
into our hands, with all their arms, stores, artillery
and baggage. General Burgoyne in two engage∣ments
has been defeated; himself, his army, and all
that were his and theirs are now ours. Ticonde∣roga
and Independence are retaken, and not the
shadow of an enemy remains in all the northern
districts. At this instant, we have upwards of
eleven thousand prisoners, between sixty and se∣venty
pieces of brass ordnance, besides small arms,
tents, stores, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="134"/>
In order to know the real value of those advan∣tages▪
we must reverse the scene, and suppose
General Gates and the force he commanded, to be
at your mercy as prisoners, and General Burgoyne
with his army of soldiers and savages to be already
joined to you in Pensylvania. So dismal a picture,
can scarcely be looked at. It hath all the traces and
colourings of horror and despair, and excites the
most swelling emotions of gratitude, by exhibiting
the miseries we are so graciously preserved from.</P>
<P>I admire this distribution of laurels around the
continent. It is the earnest of future union. South
Carolina has had her day of suffering and of fame;
and the other southern states have exerted them∣selves
in proportion to the force that invaded or in∣sulted
them. Towards the close of the campaign
in seventy six, these middle states were called upon,
and did their duty nobly. They were witnesses to
the almost expiring flame of human freedom. It
was the close struggle of life and death. The line
of invisible division, and on which, the unabated
fortitude of a Washington prevailed, and saved the
spark, that has since blazed in the north with unri∣valled
lustre.</P>
<P>Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you
performed? Through all the variety of changes
and opporunities which this war hath produced, I
know no one action of yours, that can be stiled mas∣terly.
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
You have moved in and out▪ backward and
forward, round and round, as if valour consisted in
a military jig. The history and figure of your
movements would be truly ridiculous could they be
justly delineated. They resemble the labours of
a puppy pursuing his tail, the end is still at the
same distance, and all the turnings round must be
done over again.</P>
<P>The first appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga
wore such an unpromising aspect, that it was neces∣sary,
in July, to detach a part of the forces to the
support of that quarter, which were otherwise des∣tined
or intended to act against you, and this, per∣haps,
has been the means of postponing your down∣fal
to another campaign. The destruction of one
army at a time is work enough. We know, sir,
what we are about, what we have to do, and how to
do it.</P>
<P>Your progress from Chesapeak, was marked by
no capital stroke of policy or heroism. Your prin∣cipal
aim was to get General Washington between
the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadel∣phia
and your army. In that situation, with a
river on each of his flanks, which united about five
miles below the city, and your army above him,
you could have intercepted his reinforcements and
supplies, cut off all his communication with the
country, and, if necessary, have dispatched assistance
to open a passage for General Burgoyne. This
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
scheme was too visible to succeed, for had General
Washington suffered you to command the open
country above him, I think it a very reasonable
conjecture that the conquest of Burgoyne would not
have taken place, because you could, in that case,
have relieved him. It was therefore necessary,
while that important victory was in suspence, to
trepan <HI>you</HI> into a situation, in which you could only
be on the defensive, without the power of affording
him assistance. The manoeuvre had its effect,
and Burgoyne was conquered.</P>
<P>There has been something unmilitarily passive in
you from the time of your passing the Schuylkill, and
getting possession of Philadelphia, to the close of the
campaign, You mistook a trap for a conquest, the
probability of which had been made known to Eu∣rope,
and the edge of your triumph taken off by
our own information long before.</P>
<P>Having got you into this situation, a scheme for a
general attack upon you at Germantown, was car∣ried
into execution on the fourth of October, and
though the success was not equal to the excellence
of the plan, yet the attempting it, proved the genius
of America to be on the rise, and her power ap∣proaching
to superiority. The obscurity of the
morning was your best friend, for a fog is always
favourable to an hunted enemy. Some weeks
after this, you, likewise, planned an attack on Ge∣neral
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
Washington while at Whitemarsh. Marched
out with infinite paracle, but on finding him pre∣paring
to attack you the next morning, you pru∣dently
cut about, and retreated to Philadelphia,
with all the precipitation of a man conquered in
imagination.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle of German town, the
probability of Burgoyne's defeat gave a new policy
to affairs in Pensylvania, and it was judged most
consistent with the general safety of America, to
wait the issue of the northern campaign. Slow and
sure is sound work. The news of that victory
arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and
no sooner did the shout of joy, and the report of
the thirteen cannon reach your ears, than you re∣solved
upon a retreat, and the next day, that is,
on the 19th, withdrew your drooping army into
Philadelphia. This movement was evidently dic∣tated
by fear; and carried with it a positive confes∣sion
that you dreaded a second attack. It was
hiding yourself among women and children, and
sleeping away the choicest part of a campaign
in expensive inactivity. An army in a city can
never be a conquering army. The situation ad∣mits
only of defence. It is a mere shelter; and
every military power in Europe will conclude you
to be eventually defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138"/>
The time when you made this retreat, was the
very time you ought to have fought a battle, in
order to put yourself in a condition of recovering
in Pensylvania, what you had lost at Saratoga.
And the reason why you did not, must be either
prudence or cowardice; the former supposes your
inability, and the latter needs no explanation. I
draw no conclusions, sir, but such as are naturally
deduced from known and visible facts, and such as
will always have a being while the facts which pro∣duced
them remain unaltered.</P>
<P>After this retreat, a new difficulty arose, which
exhibited the power of Britain in a very contemp∣tible
light, which was the attack and defence of Mud
Island. For several weeks did that little unfinished
fortress stand out against all the attempts of Admiral
and General Howe. It was the fable of Bendar
realized on the Delaware. Scheme after scheme,
and force upon force were tried and defeated. The
garrison, with scarce any thing to cover them but
their bravery, survived in the midst of mud, shot
and shells, and were at last obliged to give it up
more to the powers of time and gunpowder, than
to the military superiority of the besiegers.</P>
<P>It is my sincere opinion, that matters are in much
werse condition with you, than what is generally
known. Your master's speech at the opening of par∣liament
is like a soliloquy on ill luck. It shews him to
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
be coming a little to his reason, for sense of pain is
the first symptom of recovery in profound stupefac∣tions.
His condition is deplorable. He is obliged
to submit to all the insults of France and Spain, with∣out
daring to know or resent them, and thankful for
the most trivial evasions, to the most humble re∣monstrances.
The time <HI>was</HI> when he could not
<HI>deign</HI> an answer to a petition from America, and the
time now <HI>is</HI> when he dare not <HI>give</HI> an answer to
an affront from France. The capture of Burgoyne's
army will sink his consequence as much in Europe
as in America. In his speech, he expresses his sus∣picions
at the warlike preparations of France and
Spain, and he has only the one army which you
command to support his character in the world
with; it remains very uncertain when, or in what
quarter it will be most wanted, or can be best em∣ployed;
and this will partly account for the great
care you take to keep it from action and attacks,
for should Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it pro∣bably
will, England may take her endless farewel,
not only of all America, but of all the West Indies.</P>
<P>Never did a nation invite destruction upon itself
with the eagerness and ignorance with which Britain
has done. Bent upon the ruin of a young and un∣offending
country, she hath drawn the sword that
hath wounded herself to the heart, and in the agony
of her resentment, hath applied a poison for a cure.
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
Her conduct towards America is a compound of
rage and lunacy; she aims at the government of it,
yet preserves neither dignity nor character in her
methods to obtain it. Were government a mere
manufacture, or article of commerce immaterial by
whom it should be made or sold, we might as well
employ her, as another, but when we consider it as
the fountain from whence the general manners and
morality of a country take their rise, that the per∣sons
entrusted with the execution thereof, are by
their serious example, and authority to support
these principles, how abominably absurd is the idea
of being hereafter governed by a set of men who
have been guilty of forgery, perjury, treachery,
theft, and every species of villainy, which the lowest
wretches on earth could practise or invent. What
greater public curse can befal any country, than to
be under such authority, and what greater blessing,
than to be delivered therefrom. The soul of any
man of sentiment, would rise in brave rebellion
against them, and spurn them from the earth.</P>
<P>The malignant and venomous tempered General
Vaughan has amused his savage fancy in burning
the whole town of Kingston, in York government,
and the late governor of that state, Mr. Tryon, in
his letter to General Parsons, has endeavoured to
justify it, and declared his with to justify it, and de∣clared
his wish to burn the houses of every com∣mittee-man
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
in the country. Such a confession from
one who was once entrusted with the powers of
civil government, is a reproach to the character.
But it is the wish and the declaration of a man
whom anguish and disappointment have driven to
despair, and who is daily decaying into the grave
with constitutional rottenness.</P>
<P>There is not in the compass of language a suffi∣ciency
of words to express the baseness of your king,
his ministry, and his army. They have refined
upon villainy till it wants a name. To the fiercer
vices of former ages, they have added the dregs and
scummings of the most finished rascallity, and are
so completely sunk in serpentine deceit, that there
is not left among them <HI>one</HI> generous enemy.</P>
<P>From such men, and such masters, may the gra∣cious
hand of Heaven, preserve America! And
though her sufferings are heavy and severe, they are
like straws in the wind, compared to the weight of
evils she would feel under the government of your
king, and his pensioned parliament.</P>
<P>There is something in meanness which excites a
species of resentment that never subsides, and some∣thing
in cruelty which stirs up the heart to the
highest agony of human hatred. Britain hath filled
up both these characters till no addition can be
made, and hath not reputation left with us to ob∣tain
credit for the slightest promise. The will of
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
God hath parted us, and the deed is registered for
eternity. When she shall be a spot scarcely visible
among the nations, America shall flourish, the fa∣vourite
of Heaven, and the friend of mankind.</P>
<P>For the domestic happiness of Britain, and the
peace of the world, I wish she had not a foot of
land but what is circumscribed within her own
island. Extent of dominion hath been her ruin,
and instead of civilizing others, hath brutalized
herself. Her late reduction of India, under Clive
and his successors, was not so properly a conquest,
as an extermination of mankind. She is the only
power who could practise the prodigal barbarity of
tying men to the mouths of loaded cannon and
blowing them away. It happens that General
Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid
transaction in the House of Commons, is now a
prisoner with us, and though an enemy, I can ap∣peal
to him for the truth of it, being confident
that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive
received the approbation of the last parliament.</P>
<P>When we take a survey of mankind, we cannot
help cursing the wretch, who, to the unavoidable
misfortunes of nature, shall wilfully add the calami∣ties
of war. One would think there were evils
enough in the world without studying to increase
them, and that life is sufficiently short, without
thanking the sand that measures it. The histories of
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the histo∣ries
of human devils; a good man cannot think of
their actions without abhorrence, nor of their deaths
without rejoicings. To see the bounties of Hea∣ven
destroyed, the beautiful face of nature laid
waste, and the choicest works of creation and art
tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curse from the
soul of piety itself. But in this country the aggra∣vation
is heightened by a new combination of affect∣ing
circumstances. America was young, and,
compared with other countries, was virtuous. None,
but a Herod of uncommon malice would have
made war upon infancy and innocence; and none
but a people of the most finished fortitude dared,
under those circumstances, have resisted tyranny.
The natives, or their ancestors had fled from the
former oppressions of England, and, with the in∣dustry
of bees, had changed a wilderness into a
habitable world. To Britain, they were indebted
for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven,
and God alone is their Lord and sovereign.</P>
<P>The time, sir, will come, when you, in a melan∣choly
hour, shall reckon up your miseries by your
murders in America. Life, with you, begins to
wear a clouded aspect. The vision of pleasurable
delusion is wearing away, and changing to the bar∣ren
wild of age and sorrow. The poor reflection
of having served your king, will yield you no con∣solation
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
in your parting moments. He will crum∣ble
to the same undistinguished ashes with yourself,
and have sins enough of his own to answer for. It
is not the farcical benedictions of a bishop, nor the
cringing hypocrisy of a court of chaplains, nor the
formality of an act of parliament, that can change
guilt into innocence, or make the punishment of
<HI>one</HI> pang the less. You may, perhaps, be unwil∣ling
to be serious, but this destruction of the goods
of Providence, this havock of the human race, and
this sowing the world with mischief, must be ac∣counted
for to him who made and governs it. To
us they are only present sufferings, but to him they
are deep rebellions.</P>
<P>If there is a sin superior to every other, it is that
of wilful and offensive war. Most other sins are
circumscribed within narrow limits, that is, the
power of <HI>one</HI> man cannot give them a very general
tension, and many kind of sins have only a mental
existence, from which no infection arises; but he
who is the author of a war, lets loose the whole con∣tagion
of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation
to death. We leave it to England and Indians to
boast of these honours; we feel no thirst for such sa∣vage
glory; a nobler flame, a purer spirit animates
America. She hath taken up the sword of virtuous
defence; she hath bravely put herself between ty∣ranny
and freedom, between a curse and a blessing,
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
determined to expel the one, and protect the other.</P>
<P>It is the object only of war that makes it ho∣nourable.
And if ever there were <HI>a just</HI> war since
the world began, it is this which America is now
engaged in. She invaded no land of yours. She
hired no mercenaries to burn your towns, nor
Indians to massacre their inhabitants. She wanted
nothing from you, and was indebted nothing to
you; and thus circumstanced, her defence is ho∣nourable,
and her prosperity certain.</P>
<P>Yet it is not on the <HI>justice</HI> only, but likewise on
the <HI>importance</HI> of this cause, that I ground my seem∣ing
enthusiastical confidence of our success. The
vast extension of America, makes her of too much va∣lue
in the scale of Providence, to be cast like a
pearl before swine, at the feet of an European island;
and of much less consequence would it be that
Britain were sunk in the sea, than that America
should miscarry. There has been such a chain of
extraordinary events in the discovery of this
country at first, in the peopling and planting it, and
afterwards, in the rearing and nursing it to its pre∣sent
state, and in the protection of it through the
present war, that no man can doubt, but Provi∣dence
hath some nobler end to accomplish than the
gratification of the petty Elector of Hanover, or
the ignorant and insignificant King of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
As the blood of the martyrs hath been the seed
of the christian church, so the political persecutions
of England, will, and hath already enriched America
with industry, experience, union and importance.
Before the present aera she was a mere chaos of un∣cemented
colonies, individually exposed to the ra∣vages
of the Indians, and the invasion of any power
that Britain should be at war with. She had no∣thing
she could call her own. Her felicity de∣pended
upon accident. The convulsions of Eu∣rope
might have thrown her from one con∣queror
to another, till she had been the slave of
all, and ruined by every one; for until she had
spirit enough to become her own master, there was
no knowing to which master she should belong.
<HI>That</HI> period, thank God, is past, and she is no
longer the dependant, disunited colonies of Britain,
but the Independent and United States of America,
knowing no master but Heaven and herself. You
or your king, may call this "Delusion," "Re∣bellion,"
or what name you please. To us it is
perfectly indifferent. The issue will determine
the character, and time will give it a name as last∣ing
as his own.</P>
<P>You have now, sir, tried the fate of three cam∣paigns,
and can fully declare to England, that no∣thing
is to be got on your part, but blows and bro∣ken
bones; and nothing on hers, but waste of
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
trade and credit, and an encrease of poverty and tax∣es.
You are now only where you might have been
two years ago without the loss of a single ship, and
yet not a step the forwarder towards the conquest
of the continent; because, as I have already hinted,
"An army in a city can never be a conquering ar∣my."
The full amount of your losses since the begin∣ning
of the war, exceeds twenty thousand men, be∣sides
millions of treasure, for which you have no∣thing
in exchange. Our expences, though great,
are circulated within ourselves. Yours is a direct
sinking of money, and that from both ends at once,
first, in hiring troops out of the nation, and in
paying them afterwards, because the money in nei∣ther
case can return again to Britain. We are
already in possession of the prize, you only in suit
for it. To us it is a real treasure, to you it would be
only an empty triumph. Our expences will repay
themselves with tenfold interest, while yours en∣tail
upon you everlasting poverty.</P>
<P>Take a review, sir, of the ground you have gone
over, and let it teach you policy, if it cannot ho∣nesty.
You stand upon a very tottering foundation.
A change of the ministry in England, may proba∣bly
bring your measures into question, and your
head to the block. Clive, with all his successes,
had some difficulty in escaping, and yours, being all
a war of losses, will afford you less pretensions,
and your enemies more ground for impeachment.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148"/>
Go home, sir, and endeavour to save the remains
of your ruined country by a just representation of
the madness of her measures. A few moments
well applied, may yet preserve her from political de∣struction.
I am not one of those who wish to see
Europe in a flame, because I am persuaded such an
event will not shorten the war. The rupture, at pre∣sent,
is confined between the two powers of Ame∣rica
and England. England finds she cannot con∣quer
America, and America has no wish to con∣quer
England. You are fighting for what you can
never obtain, and we defending what we mean
never to part with. A few words, therefore,
settle the bargain. Let England, mind her
own business, and we will mind ours. Govern
yourselves and we will govern ourselves. You may
then trade where you please unmolested by us, and
we will trade where we please unmolested by you;
and such articles as we can purchase of each other
better than elsewhere, may be mutually done. If
it were possible that you could carry on the war for
twenty years, you must still come to this point at
last, or worse, and the sooner you think of it the
better it will be for you.</P>
<P>My official situation enables me to know the re∣peated
insults which Britain is obliged to put up
with from foreign powers, and the wretched shifts
she is driven to, to gloss them over. Her reduced
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
strength, and exhausted coffers in a three years war
with America, have given a powerful superiority
to France and Spain. She is now a match for them.
—But, if neither counsels can prevail on her to
think, nor sufferings awaken her to reason, she must
e'en go on, till the honour of England becomes a
proverb of contempt, and Europe dub her the land
of fools.</P>

<HEAD>To the Inhabitants of America.</HEAD>
<P>WITH all the pleasure with which a man ex∣changes
bad company for good, I take my leave of
Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly
three years since the tyranny of Britain received its
first repulse by the arms of America. A period,
which has given birth to the New World, and
erected a monument of folly to the old.</P>
<P>I cannot help being sometimes surprised at the
complimentary references, which I have seen and
heard made to ancient histories and transactions.
The wisdom of civil governments, and sense of ho∣nour
of the States of Greece and Rome, are fre∣quently
held up as objects of excellence and imita∣tion.
Mankind have lived for very little purpose,
if, at this period of the world, they must go two or
three thousand years back for lessons and examples.
We do dishonourary injustice to ourselves by pla∣cing
them in such a superior line. We have no just
authority for it, neither can we tell why it is that
we should suppose ourselves inferior.</P>
<P>Could the mist of antiquity be taken away, and
men and things viewed as they then really were,
it is more than probable that they would admire us,
rather than we them. America has surmounted a
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
greater variety and combination of difficulties, than,
I believe, ever fell to the share of any one peo∣ple
in the same space of time, and has replenished
the world with more useful knowledge, and sounder
maxims of civil government than were ever pro∣duced
in any age before. Had it not been for
America, there had been no such thing as freedom
left throughout the whole universe. England hath
lost hers, in a long chain of right reasoning from
wrong principles, and it is from this now she must
learn the resolution to redress herself, and the wis∣dom
how.</P>
<P>The Grecians and Romans were strongly pos∣sessed
of the <HI>spirit</HI> of liberty, but <HI>not</HI> the <HI>principle,</HI>
for at the time they were determined not to be
slaves themselves, they employed their power to
enslave the rest of mankind. But this distinguished
aera is blotted by no one misanthropical vice. In
short, if the principle on which the cause is founded,
the universal blessings that are to arise from
it, the difficulties that accompanied it; the wis∣dom
with which it has been debated, the
sortitude by which it has been supported, the
strength of the power we had to oppose, and the
condition in which we undertook it, be all taken
in one view, we may justly stile it, the most virtuous
and illustrious revolution that ever graced the his∣tory
of mankind.</P>
<P>A good opinion of ourselves is exceedingly
necessary in private life, but absolutely necessary in
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
public life; and of the utmost importance in sup∣porting
national character. I have no notion of
yielding the palm of the United States to any Gre∣cians
or Romans that were ever born. We have
equalled the bravest in times of danger, and ex∣celled
the wisest in the construction of civil go∣vernments,
<HI>no one in America excepted.</HI></P>
<P>From this agreeable eminence, let us take a re∣view
of present affairs. The spirit of corruption
is so inseparably interwoven with British politics,
that their ministry suppose all mankind are go∣verned
by the same motive. They have no idea of
people submitting even to a temporary inconveni∣ence,
from an attachment to rights and privileges.
Their plans of business are calculated <HI>by</HI> the hour,
and <HI>for</HI> the hour, and are uniform in nothing but
in the corruption which give them birth. They
never had, neither have they at this time, any re∣gular
plan for the conquest of America by arms.
They know not how to go about it, neither have
they the power to effect it, if they could know. The
thing is not within the compass of human practicabi∣lity,
for America is too extensive either to be fully
conquered, or <HI>passively</HI> defended. But she may be
<HI>actively</HI> defended, by defeating or making prisoners
of the army that invades her. And this is the
only system of defence that can be effectual in a
large country.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153"/>
There is something in a war carried on by in∣vasion,
which makes it differ in circumstances
from any other mode of war, because, he who
conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains,
be for him, or against him, when he first makes
it. In the winter of seventy six, General Howe,
marched with an air of victory through the Jer∣seys,
the consequence of which, was his defeat,
and General Burgoyne, at Saratoga experienced
the same fate from the same cause. The Spaniards,
about two years ago, were defeated by the Alge∣rines
in the same manner, that is, their first tri∣umphs
became a trap, in which they were totally
routed. And, whoever will attend to the circum∣stances,
and events of a war carried on by invasion,
will find, that any invader, in order to be finally
conquered, must begin first to conquer.</P>
<P>I confefs myself one of those who believe the
loss of Philadelphia to be attended with more ad∣vantages
than injuries. The case stood thus. The
enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more im∣portance
to us, than it really was; for we all know
that it had long ceased to be a port, not a cargo
of goods had been brought into it for near a
twelvemonth, nor any fixed manufactories, nor
even ship-building carried on in it; yet, as the
enemy believed the conquest of it to be prac∣ticable,
and, to that belief, added the absurd idea,
that the soul of all America was centered there,
and would be conquered there, it naturally follows,
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
that their possession of it, by not answering the end
proposed, must break up the plans they had fool∣ishly
gone upon, and either oblige them to form a
new one, for which their present strength is not
sufficient, or to give over the attempt.</P>
<P>We never had so small an army to fight against,
nor so fair an opportunity of final success as <HI>now.</HI>
The death wound is already given. The day is
our own, if we follow it up. The enemy by his
situation is within our reach, and by his reduced
strength is within our power. The ministers of
Britain may rage as they please, but our part is to
conquer their armies. Let them wrangle and
welcome, but let it not draw our attention from
the <HI>one</HI> thing needful. <HI>Here, in this</HI> spot is our
business to be accomplished; our felicity secured.
What we have now to do, is as clear as light, and
the way to do it is as strait as a line. It needs
not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be per∣fectly
understood, I will put a case that cannot ad∣mit
of a mistake.</P>
<P>Had the armies under Generals Howe and Bur∣goyne
been united and taken post at Germantown,
and had the northern army, under General Gates,
been joined to that under General Washington, at
Whitemarsh, the consequence would have been a
general action; and, if in that action, we had killed
and taken the same number of officers and men,
that is, between nine and ten thousand, with the
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
same quantity of artillery, arms, stores, &amp;c. as have
been taken at the northward, and obliged General
Howe with the remains of his army, that is, with
the same number he now commands, to take shelter
in Philadelphia, we should certainly have thought
ourselves the greatest heroes in the world; and
should as soon as the season permitted, have col∣lected
together all the force of the continent, and
laid siege to the city, for it requires a much greater
force to besiege an enemy in a town, than to defeat
them in the field. The case <HI>now</HI> is just the same,
as if it had been produced by the means I have
here supposed. Between nine and ten thousand
have been killed and taken, all their stores are in
our possession, and General Howe in consequence
of that victory, has thrown himself for shelter into
Philadelphia. He, or his trifling friend Galloway,
may form what pretences they please, yet no just
reason can be given for their going into winter
quarters so early as the 19th of October, but their
apprehension of a defeat if they continued out, or
their conscious inability to keep the field with
safety. I see no advantage which can arise to
America, by hunting the enemy from State to
State. It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly
unworthy the attention of a people determined to
conquer. Neither can any State promise to itself
security, while the enemy remains in a condition to
transport themselves from one part of the continent
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
to another. Howe, likewise, cannot conquer where
we have no army to oppose, therefore any such re∣movals
in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces
Britain to a common pilferer. If he retreats from
Philadelphia, he will be despised; if he stays, he
may be shut up and starved out, and the country,
if he advances into, may become his Saratoga. He
has his choice of evils, and we of opportunities. If
he moves early, it is not only a sign, but a proof
that he expects no reinforcement, and his delays
will prove that he either waits for the arrival of a
plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both:
in <HI>which</HI> case, our strength will encrease more than
his, therefore, in <HI>any</HI> case, we cannot be wrong, if
we do but proceed.</P>
<P>The particular condition of Pensylvania, deserves
the attention of all the other States. Her military
strength must not be estimated by the number of
inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, charac∣ters,
professions, and interests. Here are the firmest
whigs, surviving, like sparks in the ocean, un∣quenched
and uncooled, in the midst of discourage∣ment
and disaffection. Here are men losing their
all with cheerfulness, and collecting fire and forti∣tude,
from the flames of their own estates. Here
are others skulking in secret; many making a mar∣ket
of the times; and numbers, who are changing
whig and tory with the circumstances of every
day.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157"/>
It is by mere dint of fortitude and perseverance,
that the whigs of this state, have been able to main∣tain
so good a countenance, and do even what they
have done. We want help, and the sooner it can
arrive, the more effectual it will be. The invaded
state, be it which it may, will always feel an ad∣ditional
burthen upon its back, and be hard
set to support its civil power with sufficient
authority: and this difficulty will always rise or
fall in proportion as the other states throw in their
assistance to the common cause.</P>
<P>The enemy will most probably make many ma∣noeuvres
at the opening of this campaign, to amuse
and draw off the attention of the several states from
the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> We may expect to hear of
alarms, and pretended expeditions to <HI>this</HI> place,
and <HI>that</HI> place; to the southward, the eastward, and
the northward, all intended to prevent our forming
into one formidable body. The less the enemy's
strength is, the more subtleties of this kind will
they make use of. Their existence depends upon
it, because the force of America, when collected, is
sufficient to swallow their present army up. It is
therefore our business to make short work of it, by
bending our whole attention to <HI>this one principal
point,</HI> for the instant that the main body, under Ge∣neral
Howe is defeated, all the inferior alarms
throughout the continent, like so many shadows,
will follow his downfal.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158"/>
The only way to finish a war with the least pos∣sible
bloodshed, or perhaps without any, is to col∣lect
an army, against the power of which, the enemy
shall have no chance. By not doing this, we pro∣long
the war, and double both the calamities and
the expences of it. What a rich and happy coun∣try
would America be, were she, by a vigourous
exertion, to reduce Howe, as she hath reduced
Burgoyne. Her currency would rise to millions
beyond its present value. Every man would be
rich, and every man would have it in his power to
be happy. And why not do these things? What
is there to hinder? America is her own mistress, and
can do what she pleases.</P>
<P>If we had not at this time a man in the field, we
could, nevertheless, raise an army in a few weeks,
sufficient to overwhelm all the force which General
Howe at present commands. Vigour and determi∣nation
will do any thing and every thing. We be∣gan
the war with this kind of spirit, why not end
it with the same? Here, gentlemen, is the enemy.
Here is the army. The interest, the happiness of all
America is centered in this half ruined spot. Come
on and help us. Here are laurels, come and share
them. Here are tories, come and help us to expel
them. Here are whigs that will make you wel∣come,
and enemies that dread your coming,</P>
<P>The worst of all policy, is that of doing things by
halves. Penny wise and pound foolish, has been
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
the ruin of thousands. The present spring, if
rightly improved, will free us from all our troubles,
and save us the expence of millions. We have
now only one army to cope with. No opportu∣nity
can be fairer; no prospect more promising.
I shall conclude this paper, with a few outlines of a
plan, either for filling up the battalions with expe∣dition,
or for raising an additional force, for any
limited time, on any sudden emergency.</P>
<P>That in which every man is interested, is every
man's duty to support. And any burthen which
falls equally on all men, and, from which every
man is to receive an equal benefit, is consistent
with the most perfect ideas of liberty. I would
wish to revive something of that virtuous ambition
which first called America into the field. Then
every man was eager to do his part, and perhaps
the principal reason why we have in any degree
fallen therefrom, is, because we did not set a sufficient
value by it at first, but left it to blaze out by itself,
instead of regulating and preserving it by just pro∣portions
of rest and service.</P>
<P>Suppose any state, whose number of effective
inhabitants was 80,000, should be required to fur∣nish
3,200 men towards the defence of the conti∣nent
on any sudden emergency.</P>
<P>First, Let the whole number of effective inhabi∣tants
be divided into hundreds; then if each of those
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
hundreds turn out four men, the whole number of
3,200 will be had.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let the names of each hundred men be
entered in a book, and let four dollars be collected
from each man, with as much more as any of the
gentlemen whose abilities can afford it, shall please
to throw in, which gifts shall likewise be entered
against the donors names.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Let the sums so collected be offered as a
present, over and above the bounty of twenty
dollars, to any four who may be inclined to pro∣pose
themselves as volunteers; if more than four
offer, the majority of the subscribers present shall
determine which; if none offer, then four out of
the hundred shall be taken by lot, who shall be en∣titled
to the said sums, and shall either go, or pro∣vide
others that will, in the space of six days.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As it will always happen, that in the
space of ground on which an hundred men shall
live, there will be always a number of persons, who,
by age and infirmity, are incapable of doing per∣sonal
service, and as such persons are generally pos∣sessed
of the greatest part of the property in any
county, their portion of service, therefore, will be
to furnish each man with a blanket, which will
make a regimental coat, jacket and breeches, or
cloaths in lieu thereof, and another for a watch cloak,
and two pair of shoes—for however choice people
may be of these things, matters not in cases of this
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
kind—Those who live always in houses, can find
many ways to keep themselves warm, but it is a
shame and a sin to suffer a soldier in the field to
want a blanket while there is one in the country.</P>
<P>Should the cloathing not be wanted, the superan∣nuated
or infirm persons possessing property, may,
in lieu thereof, throw in their money subscriptions,
towards encreasing the bounty; for though age will
naturally exempt a personal service, it cannot ex∣empt
him from his share of the charge, because the
men are raised for the defence of property and li∣berty
jointly.</P>
<P>There never was a scheme against which objec∣tions
might not be raised. But this alone is not a
sufficient reason for rejection. The only line to
judge truly upon, is, to draw out and admit all
the objections which can fairly be made, and
place against them all the contrary qualities, con∣veniences,
and advantages, then by striking a ba∣lance,
you come at the true character of any scheme,
principle or position.</P>
<P>The most material advantages of the plan here
proposed, are ease, expedition, and cheapness; yet
the men so raised, get a much larger bounty, than
is, any where, at present given; because all the ex∣pences,
extravagance, and consequent idleness of
recruiting are saved or prevented. The country
incurs no new debt, nor interest thereon; the whole
matter being all settled at once, and entirely done
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
with. It is a subscription answering all the purposes
of a tax, without either the charge or trouble of
collecting. The men are ready for the field
with the greatest possible expedition, because, it
becomes the duty of the inhabitants themselves, in
every part of the country, to find up their propor∣tion
of men, instead of leaving it to a recruiting
serjeant, who, be he ever so industrious, cannot
know always where to apply.</P>
<P>I do not propose this as a regular digested plan,
neither will the limits of this paper admit any fur∣ther
remarks upon it. I believe it to be a hint ca∣pable
of much improvement, and as such submit it
to the public.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Earl of Carlisle, General Clinton, and
William Eden, Esq. British Commissioners, at
New York.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a dignity in the warm passions of a
whig, which is never to be found in the cold ma∣lice
of a tory. In the one, nature is only heated
—in the other she is poisoned. The instant the
former has it in his power to punish, he feels a
disposition to forgive; but the canine venom of
the latter knows no relief but revenge. This ge∣neral
distinction, will, I believe, apply in all cases,
and suit as well the meridian of England as
America.</P>
<P>As I presume your last proclamation will un∣dergo
the strictures of other pens, I shall confine
my remarks to only a few parts thereof. All that
you have said, might have been comprised in half
the compass. It is tedious and unmeaning, and
only a repetition of your former follies, with here
and there an offensive aggravation. Your cargo
of pardons will have no market—It is unfashionable
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
to look at them Even speculation is at an end.
They are become a perfect drug, and no way cal∣culated
for the climate.</P>
<P>In the course of your proclamation, you say,
"The policy, as well as the BENEVOLENCE
OF GREAT BRITAIN, have thus far checked
the extremes of war, when they tended to distress a
people, still considered as their fellow subjects, and
to desolate a country shortly to become again a
source of mutual advantage." What you mean
by "the BENEVOLENCE of Great Britain,"
is to me, inconceivable. To put a plain question:
Do you consider yourselves men or devils? For
until this point is settled, no determinate sense can
be put upon the expression. You have already
equalled, and in many places excelled the savages
of either Indies; and if you have yet a cruelty in
store, you must have imported it unmixed with
every human material from the original warehouse
of hell.</P>
<P>To the interposition of Providence, and her
blessings on our endeavours, and not to BRITISH
BENEVOLENCE, are we indebted for the short
chain that limits your ravages. Remember, you
do not at this time, command a foot of land on the
continent of America. Staten Island, York Island,
a small part of Long Island and Rhode Island,
circumscribe your power; and even those you hold
at the expence of the West Indies. To avoid a
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
defeat, and prevent a desertion of your troops, you
have taken up your quarters in holes and corners
of inaccessible security; and in order to conceal
what every one can conceive, you now endeavour
to impose your weakness upon us for an act of
mercy. If you think to succeed by such shadowy
devices, you are but infants in the political world;
you have the A, B, C, of stratagem yet to learn,
and are wholly ignorant of the people you have to
contend with. Like men in a state of intoxica∣tion,
you forget that the rest of the world have eyes,
and that the same stupidity which conceals you
from yourselves, exposes you to their satire and
contempt.</P>
<P>The paragraph I have quoted, stands as an in∣troduction
to the following: "But when that coun∣try
(America) professes the unnatural design, not
only of estranging herself from us, but of mortga∣ging
herself and her resources to our enemies, the
whole contest is changed; and the question is,
how far Great Britain may, by every means in her
power, destroy or render useless, a connection con∣trived
for her ruin, and the aggrandizement of
France. Under such circumstances, the laws of
self-preservation must direct the conduct of Britain,
and if the British Colonies are to become an ac∣cession
to France, will direct her, to render that
accession of as little avail as possible to her enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>
I consider you, in this declaration, like madmen
biting in the hour of death. It contains, likewise,
a fraudulent meanness; for, in order to justify a
barbarous conclusion, you have advanced a false
position. The treaty we have formed with France
is open, noble and generous. It is the true policy,
founded on sound philosophy, and neither a surren∣der
or mortgage, as you would scandalously insinu∣ate.
I have seen every article, and speak from
positive knowledge. In France, we have found an
affectionate friend, a faithful ally; from Britain
nothing but tyranny, cruelty, and infidelity.</P>
<P>But the happiness is, that the mischief you
threaten, is not in your power to execute; and if it
were, the punishment would return upon you, in a
tenfold degree. The humanity of America, hath
hitherto, restrained her from acts of retaliation, and
the affection she retains for many individuals in
England, who have fed, clothed, and comforted her
prisoners, has, to the present day, warded off her
resentment, and operated as a screen to the whole.
But even these considerations must cease, when na∣tional
objects interfere and oppose them. Re∣peated
aggravations will provoke a retort, and po∣licy
justify the measure. We mean now to take you
seriously up upon your own ground and principles,
and as you do, so shall you be done by.</P>
<P>You ought to know, gentlemen, that England
and Scotland, are far more exposed to incendiary
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
desolation than America in her present state, can
possibly be. We occupy a country, with but few
towns, and whose riches consist in land and annual
produce. The two last can susser but little, and
that only within a very limited compass. In Bri∣tain,
it is otherwise. Her wealth lies chiefly in
cities and large towns, the repositories of manufac∣tures,
and fleets of merchantmen.—There is not a
nobleman's country seat but may be laid in ashes
by a single person. Your own, may probably con∣tribute
to the proof: In short, there is no evil
which cannot be returned, when you come to incen∣diary
mischief.—The ships in the Thames, may cer∣tainly
be easily set on fire, as the temporary
bridge was a few years ago; yet of that affair, no
discovery was ever made; and the loss you would
sustain by such an event, executed at a proper sea∣son,
is infinitely greater than any you can inflict.
The East India house, and the bank, neither,
are, nor can be secure from this sort of destruction,
and, as Dr. Price justly observes, a fire at the latter
would bankrupt the nation. It has never been
the custom of France and England, when at war,
to make those havocs on each other, because the
ease with which they could retaliate, rendered it as
impolitic, as if each had destroyed his own.</P>
<P>But think not, gentlemen, that our distance se∣cures
you, or our invention fails us. We can much
easier accomplish such a point than any nation in Eu∣rope.
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
We talk the same language, dress in the
same habit, and appear with the same manners as
yourselves. We can pass from one part of Eng∣land
to another unsuspected; many of us are
as well acquainted with the country as you are, and
should you impoliticly provoke our will, you will
most assuredly lament the effects of it. Mischiefs
of this kind, requires no army to execute them.
The means are obvious, and the opportunities un∣guardable.
I hold up a warning piece to your
senses, if you have any left, and "to the unhappy
people likewise, whose affairs are committed to
you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Clinton's letter to Congress.</NOTE>." I call not with the rancour of an enemy,
but with the earnestness of a friend, on the deluded
people of England, lest, between your blunders and
theirs, they sink beneath the evils contrived for us.</P>
<P>"He who lives in a glass-house, says the Spa∣nish
proverb, should never begin throwing stones."
This, gentlemen, is exactly your case, and you
must be the most ignorant of mankind, or suppose
us so, not to see on which side the balance of ac∣counts
will fall. There are many other modes of
retaliation, which for several reasons, I choose not
to mention. But, be assured of this, that the in∣stant
you put a threat in execution, a counter blow
will follow it. If you openly profess yourselves
savages, it is high time we should treat you as such,
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
and if nothing but distress can recover you to rea∣son,
to punish, will become an office of charity.</P>
<P>While your fleet lay last winter in the Delaware, I
offered my service to the Pensylvanian navy-board,
then at Trenton, as one who would make a party with
them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an expedi∣tion
down the river, to set fire to it, and though it
was not then accepted, nor the thing personally
attempted, it is more than probable, that your own
folly will provoke a much more vulnerable part.
Say not, when the mischief is done, that you had
warning, and remember that we did not begin it,
but mean to repay it. Thus much for your savage
and impolitic threat.</P>
<P>In another part of your proclamation you say,
"But if the honours of a military life, are become
the object of the Americans, let them seek those
honours, under the banners of their rightful sove∣reign,
and in fighting the battles of the united Bri∣tish
empire, against our late mutual and natural
enemies." Surely! The union of absurdity with
madness, was never marked with more distinguish∣able
lines than these. Your rightful sovereign as
you call him, may do well enough for you, who
dare not enquire into the humble capacities of the
man; but we, who estimate persons and things by
their real worth, cannot suffer our judgments to be
so imposed upon; and, unless it is your wish to
see him exposed, it ought to be your endeavour to
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
keep him out of sight. The less you have to say
about him the better. We have done with him,
and that ought to be answer enough. You have
often been told so. Strange! that the answer must
be so often repeated. You go a begging with your
king as with a brat, or with some unsaleable com∣modity
you were tired of; and though every body
tells, no, no, still you keep hawking him about.
But there is one who will have him in a little time,
and as we have no inclination to disappoint you of a
customer, we bid you nothing for him.</P>
<P>The impertinent folly of the paragraph I have
just quoted, deserve no other notice than to be
laughed at, and thrown by, but the principle on
which it is founded, is detestable. We are invited
to submit to a man who has attempted by every
cruelty to destroy us, and to join him in making
war against France, who is already at war against
him for our support.</P>
<P>Can Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a
more mad and devilish request; Were it possible a
people could sink into such apostacy, they would
deserve to be swept from the earth, like the inhabi∣tants
of Sodom and Gomorrah. The proposition
is an universal affront to the rank which man holds
in the creation, and an indignity to him who
placed him there. It supposes him made up with∣out
a spark of honour, and under no obligation to
God or man.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171"/>
What sort of men or Christians must you suppose
the Americans to be, who, after seeing their most
humble petitions insultingly rejected, the most griev∣ous
laws passed to distress them in every quarter,
an undeclared war let loose upon them, and Indians
and negroes invited to the slaughter; who after
seeing their kindred murdered, their fellow citizens
starved to death in prisons, and their houses and
property destroyed and buried; who after the most
serious appeals to heaven, the most solemn abjura∣tion
by oath of all government connected with you,
and the most heart-felt pledges and protestations
of faith to each other; and who, after soliciting
the friendship, and entering into alliances with other
nations, should at last break through all these obli∣gations,
civil and divine, by complying with your
horrid and infernal proposal. Ought we ever after
to be considered as a part of the human race? Or,
ought we not rather to be blotted from the society
of mankind, and become a spectacle of misery to
the world? But there is something in corruption,
which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers the colour of
of itself to the object it looks upon, and sees every
thing stained and impure; for unless you were
capable of such conduct yourselves, you could never
have supposed such a character in us. The offer
fixes your infamy. It exhibits you as a nation
without faith, with whom oaths and treaties are
considered as trifles, and the breaking them, as the
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
breaking of a bubble. Regard to decency or to
rank, might have taught you better, or pride in∣spired
you, though virtue could not. There is not
left a step in the degradation of character to which
you can now descend; you have put your foot on
the ground floor, and the key of the dungeon is
turned upon you.</P>
<P>That the invitation may want nothing of being a
complete monster, you have thought proper to finish
it with an assertion which has no foundation, either
in fact or philosophy; and as Mr. Ferguson, your
secretary, is a man of letters, and has made
civil society his study, and published a treatise on
that subject, I address this part to him.</P>
<P>In the close of the paragraph which I last quoted,
France is stiled the "natural enemy" of England,
and by way of lugging us into some strange idea, she
is stiled the "late mutual and natural enemy" of
both countries. I deny that she ever was the na∣tural
enemy of either, and that there does not exist
in nature such a principle. The expression is an
unmeaning barbarism, and wholly unphilosophical,
when applied to beings of the same species, let their
station in the creation be what it may. We have
a perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of
the devil, because the enmity is perpetual, unalter∣able,
and unabateable. It admits neither of peace,
truce, or treaty; consequently the warfare is eternal,
and therefore it is natural. But man with man
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
cannot arrange in the same opposition. Their
quarrels are accidental and equivocally created.
They become friends or enemies at the change of
temper, as the cast of interest inclines them. The
Creator of man did not constitute them the natural
enemy of each other. He has not made any one
order of beings so. Even wolves may quarrel, still
they herd together. If any two nations are so, then
must all nations be so, otherwise it is not nature,
but custom, and the offence frequently originates
with the accuser. England is as truly the natural
enemy of France, as France is of England, and,
perhaps, more so. Separated from the rest of Eu∣rope,
she has contracted an unsocial habit of man∣ners,
and imagines in others the jealousy she creates
in herself. Never long satisfied with peace, she
supposes the discontent universal, and buoyed up
with her own importance, conceives herself the
only object pointed at. The expression has been
often used, and always with a fraudulent design;
for when the idea of a natural enemy is conceived,
it prevents all other enquiries, and the real cause of
the quarrel is hidden in the universality of the con∣ceit.
Men start at the notion of a natural enemy,
and ask no other question. The cry obtains credi
like the alarm of a mad dog, and is one of those
kind of tricks, which, by operating on the com∣mon
passions, secures their interest through their
folly.</P>

But we, sir, are not to be thus imposed upon.
We live in a large world, and have extended our
ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an island.
We hold out the right hand of friendship to all the
universe, and we conceive there to be a sociality in
the manners of France, which is much better dis∣posed
to peace and negociation than that of Eng∣land,
and until the latter becomes more civilized,
she cannot expect to live long at peace with any
power. Her common language is vulgar and of∣fensive,
and children, with their milk, suck in the
rudiments of insult.—"The arm of Britain! The
mighty arm of Britain! Britain that shakes the
earth to its center and its poles! The scourge of
France! The terror of the world! That governs
with a nod, and pours down vengeance like a
God." This language neither makes a nation great
or little; but it shews a savageness of manners, and
has a tendency to keep national animosity alive.
The entertainments of the stage are calculated to
the same end, and almost every public exhibition is
tinctured with insult. Yet England is always in
dread of France. Terrified at the apprehension of
an invasion. Suspicious of being outwitted in a treaty
and privately cringing, though she is publicly of∣fending.
Let her therefore, reform her manners,
and do justice, and she will find the idea of a natural
enemy, to be only a phantom of her own ima∣gination.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="175"/>
Little did I think, at this period of the war, to
see a proclamation which could promise you no one
useful purpose whatever, and tend only to expose
you. One would think you were just awakened
from a four years dream, and knew nothing of
what had passed in the interval. Is this a time to
be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgot∣ten
subjects of charters and taxation? Is it worth
your while, after every force has failed you, to re∣treat
under the shelter of argument and persuasion?
Or can you think that we, with nearly half your
army prisoners, and in alliance with France, are to
be begged or threatened into a submission by a
piece of paper? But as commissioners, at a hun∣dred
pounds sterling a week each, you conceive
yourselves bound to do something, and the genius
of ill-fortune told you, you must write.</P>
<P>For my own part I have not put pen to paper
these several months. Convinced of your superio∣rity
by the issue of every campaign, I was inclined
to hope, that that which all the rest of the world
now see, would become visible to you, and there∣fore
felt unwilling to ruffle your temper by fretting
you with repetitions and discoveries. There have
been intervals of hesitation in your conduct, from
which it seemed a pity to disturb you, and a cha∣rity
to leave you to yourselves. You have often
stopt, as if you intended to think, but your
thoughts have ever been too early or too late.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176"/>
There was a time when Britain disdained to an∣swer,
and even to hear a petition from America.
That time is past, and she, in her turn, is petitioning
our acceptance. We now stand on higher ground,
and offer her peace; and the time will come, when
she, perhaps in vain, will ask it from us. The latter
case is as probable as the former ever was. She
cannot refuse to acknowledge our independence
with greater obstinacy than she before refused to
repeal her laws; and if America alone could bring
her to the one, united with France she will re∣duce
her to the other. There is something in
obstinacy which differs from every other passion,
whenever it fails it never recovers, but either breaks
like iron, or crumbles sulkily away like a fractured
arch. Most other passions have their periods of
fatigue and rest; their sufferings and their cure;
but obstinacy has no resource, and the first wound
is mortal. You have already begun to give it
up, and you will, from the natural construction
of the vice, find yourselves both obliged and
inclined to do so.</P>
<P>If you look back you see nothing but loss
and disgrace. If you look forward, the same
scene continues, and the close is an impenetrable
gloom. You may plan and execute little mis∣chiefs,
but are they worth the expence they cost
you, or will such partial evils have any effect
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
on the general cause? Your expedition to Egg-Harbour,
will be felt at a distance like an at∣tack
upon a hen-roost, and expose you in Eu∣rope
with a sort of childish phrensy. It is well
worth while to keep an army to protect you in
writing proclamations, or to get once a year
into winter quarters? Possessing yourselves of
towns is not conquest, but convenience, and in
which you will, one day or the other, be tre∣panned.
Your retreat from Philadelphia was
only a timely escape, and your next expedition
may be less fortunate.</P>
<P>It would puzzle all the politicians in the universe
to conceive what you stay for, or why you should
have staid so long. You are prosecuting a war
in which you confess you have neither object
nor hope, and that conquest, could it be ef∣fected,
would not repay the charges: In the mean
while, the rest of your affairs are running into
ruin, and a European war kindled against you.
In such a situation, there is neither doubt or
difficulty; the first rudiments of reason will de∣termine
the choice, for if peace can be pro∣cured
with more advantages than even a con∣quest
can be obtained, he must be an ideot indeed
that hesitates.</P>
<P>But you are probably buoyed up by a set of
wretched mortals, who, having deceived them∣selves,
are cringing with the duplicity of a spaniel
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
for a little temporary bread. Those men will
tell you just what you please. It is their in∣terest
to amuse, in order to lengthen out their
protection. They study to keep you amongst
them for that very purpose; and in proportion as
you disregard their advice, and grow callous to
their complaints, they will stretch into improba∣bility,
and pepper off their flattery the higher.
Characters like these are to be found in every
country, and every country will despise them.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the People of England.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are stages in the business of serious life
in which to amuse is cruel, but to deceive is
to destroy; and it is of little consequence in the
conclusion, whether men deceive themselves or sub∣mit
by a kind of mutual consent, to the impositions
of each other. That England has been long under
the influence of delusion or mistake, needs no other
proof than the unexpected and wretched situation
she is now involved in: And so powerful has been
the influence, that no provision was ever made or
thought of against the misfortune, because the pos∣sibility
of its happening was never conceived.</P>
<P>The general and successful resistance of Ame∣rica,
the conquest of Burgoyne, and a war with
France, were treated in parliament as the dreams
of a discontented opposition, or a distempered ima∣gination.
They were beheld as objects unworthy
of a serious thought, and the bare intimation of
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
them afforded the ministry a triumph of laughter.
Short triumph indeed! For every thing which has
been predicted has happened, and all that was pro∣mised
have failed. A long series of politics so re∣markably
distinguished by a succession of misfor∣tunes,
without one alleviating turn, must certainly
have something in it systematically wrong. It is
sufficient to awaken the most credulous into suspi∣cion,
and most obstinate into thought. Either the
means in your power are insufficient, or the mea∣sures
ill-planned; either the execution has been
bad, or the thing attempted impracticable; or to
speak more emphatically, either you are not able,
or Heaven is not willing. For, why is it that you
have not conquered us? Who, or what has pre∣vented
you? You have had every opportunity
you could desire, and succceded to your utmost
wish in every preparatory means. Your fleets and
armies have arrived in America without an acci∣dent.
No uncommon misfortune hath intervened.
No foreign nation hath interfered until the time
you had allotted for victory was past. The oppo∣sition
either in or out of parliament, neither discon∣certed
your measures, retarded or diminished your
force. They only foretold your sate. Every mi∣nisterial
scheme was carried with as high a hand as
if the whole nation had been unanimous. Every
thing wanted was asked for, and every thing asked
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
for was granted. A greater force was not within the
compass of your abilities to send, and the time you
sent it was, of all others, the most favourable.
You were then at rest with the whole world beside.
You had the range of every court in Europe uncon∣tradicted
by us. You amused us with a tale of
commissioners of peace, and under that disguise
collected a numerous army and came almost unex∣pectedly
upon us. The force was much greater
than we looked for; and that which we had to op∣pose
it with was unequal in numbers, badly armed
and poorly disciplined; besides which, it was em∣bodied
only for a short time, and expired within
a few months after your arrival. We had govern∣ments
to form; measures to concert; an army to
raise and train, and every necessary article to im∣port
or to create. Our non-importation scheme had
exhausted our stores, and your command by sea,
intercepted our supplies. We were a people un∣known,
and unconnected with the political world,
and strangers to the disposition of foreign powers.
Could you possibly wish for a more favorable con∣junction
of circumstances? Yet all these have hap∣pened
and passed away, and, as it were, left you
with a laugh. They are likewise events of such an
original nativity as can never happen again, unless
a new world should arise from the ocean.</P>
<P>If any thing can be a lesson to presumption,
surely the circumstances of this war will have their
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
effect. Had Britain been defeated by any Euro∣pean
power, her pride would have drawn consola∣tion
from the importance of her conquerors; but in
the present case, she is excelled by those she affected
to despise, and her own opinion retorting on herself,
become an aggravation of her disgrace. Misfor∣tune
and experience are lost upon mankind, when
they produce neither reflection nor reformation.
Evils, like poisons, have their uses, and there are
diseases which no other remedy can reach. It has
been the crime and folly of England to suppose
herself invincible, and that, without acknowledging
or perceiving that a full third of her strength was
drawn from the country she is now at war with.
The arm of Britain has been spoken of as the arm
of the Almighty, and she has lived of late, as if she
thought the whole world created for her diversion.
Her politics, instead of civilizing, has tended to
brutalize mankind, and under the vain unmeaning
title of "Defender of the Faith," she has made
war, like an Indian, against the religion of huma∣nity.
Her cruelties in the East Indies, will NEVER,
NEVER be forgotten; and, it is somewhat re∣markable,
that the produce of that ruined country,
transported to America, should there kindle up a
war, to punish the destroyer. The chain is conti∣nued,
though with a kind of mysterious uniformity,
both in the crime and the punishment. The latter
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
runs parallel with the former; and time and fate
will give it a perfect illustration.</P>
<P>Where information is withheld, ignorance be∣comes
a reasonable excuse; and one would charita∣bly
hope, that the people of England do not encou∣rage
cruelty from choice, but from mistake. Their
recluse situation, surrounded by the sea, preserves
them from the calamities of war, and keeps them
in the dark as to the conduct of their own armies.
They see not, therefore they feel not. They tell
the tale that is told them, and believe it, and ac∣customed
to no other news than their own, they re∣ceive
it, stript of its horrors, and prepared for the
palate of the nation, through the channel of the
London Gazette. They are made to believe
that their generals and armies differ from those of
other nations, and have nothing of rudeness or bar∣barity
in them. They suppose them what they
wish them to be. They feel a disgrace in thinking
otherwise, and naturally encourage the belief from
a partiality to themselves. There was a time when
I felt the same prejudices, and reasoned from the
same errors; but experience, sad and painful expe∣rience,
has taught me better. What the conduct
of former armies was, I know not, but what the
conduct of the present is, I well know. It is low,
cruel, indolent, and prossigate: and had the people
of America no other cause for separation than what
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
the army has occasioned, that alone is cause
enough.</P>
<P>The field of politics in England is far more ex∣tensive
than that of news. Men have a right to rea∣son
for themselves, and though they cannot contra∣dict
the intelligence in the London Gazette, they
can frame upon it what sentiments they please.
But the misfortune is, that a general ignorance has
prevailed over the whole nation respecting Ameri∣ca.
The ministry and the minority have both been
wrong. The former was always so; the latter,
only lately so. Politics to be executively right,
must have a unity of means and time, and a defect
in either overthrows the whole. The ministry re∣jected
the plans of the minority while they were
practicable, and joined in them, when they became
impracticable. From wrong measures, they got
into wrong time, and have now completed the
circle of absurdity by closing it upon themselves.</P>
<P>It was my fate to come to America a few months
before the breaking out of hostilities. I found the
disposition of the people such, that they might have
been led by a thread, and governed by a reed.
Their suspicion was quick and penetrating, but
their attachment to Britain was obstinate, and it
was, at that time, a kind of treason to speak against
it. They disliked the ministry, but they esteemed
the nation. Their idea of grievance operated
without resentment, and their single object was re∣conciliation,
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
Bad as I believed the ministry to be,
I never conceived them capable of a measure so
rash and wicked as the commencing of hostilities;
much less did I imagine the nation would en∣courage
it. I viewed the dispute as a kind of law∣suit,
in which I supposed the parties would find a
way either to decide or settle it. I had no thoughts
of independence, or of arms. The world could
not then have persuaded me, that I should be ei∣ther
a soldier or an author. If I had any talents
for either, they were buried in me, and might ever
have continued so, had not the necessity of the
times dragged and driven them into action. I had
formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself hap∣py,
wished every body else so. But when the
country into which I had just put my foot, was set
on fire about my ears, it was time to stir. It
was time for every man to stir. Those who had
been long settled and had something to defend;
those who had just come had something to pursue;
and the call, and the concern was equal and univer∣sal.
For in a country where all men were once ad∣venturers,
the difference of a few years in their arri∣val,
could make none in their right.</P>
<P>The breaking out of hostilities, opened a new
suspicion in the politics of America, which, though
at that time very rare, has been since proved to be
very right. What I allude to, is, "A secret and
fixt determination in the British cabinet to annex
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
America to the crown of England as a conquered
country." If this be taken as the object, then the
whole line of conduct pursued by the ministry,
though rash in its origin, and ruinous in its conse∣quences,
is nevertheless uniform and consistent in
its parts. It applies to every case, and resolves
every difficulty. But if taxation, or any thing else
taken in its room, then there is no proportion be∣tween
the object and the charge. Nothing but the
whole soil and property of the country can be
placed as a possible equivalent against the millions
which the ministry expended. No taxes raised in
America could possibly repay it. A revenue of
two millions sterling a year, would not discharge
the sum and interest accumulated thereon, in twenty
years.</P>
<P>Reconciliation never appears to have been the
wish or the object of administration, they looked on
conquest as certain and infallible, and under that
persuasion, sought to drive the Americans into what
they might stile, a general rebellion, and then
crushing them with arms in their hands, reap the
rich harvest of a general confiscation, and silence
them for ever. The dependants at court were too
numerous to be provided for in England. The
market for plunder in the East Indies were over;
and the profligacy of government required that a
a new mine should be opened, and that mine,
could be no other than America conquered and
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
forfeited. They had no where else to go. Every
other channel was drained; and extravagance with
the thirst of a drunkard, was gaping for supplies.</P>
<P>If the ministry deny this to have been their plan,
it becomes them to explain what was their plan.
For either they have abused us in coveting pro∣perty
they never laboured for, or they have abused
you in expending an amazing sum upon an incom∣petent
object. Taxation, as I mentioned before,
could never be worth the charge of obtaining it by
arms; and any kind of formal obedience which
America could have made, would have weighed
with the lightness of a laugh against such a load of
expence. It is, therefore, most probable, that the
ministry will at last justify their policy by their dis∣honesty,
and openly declare, that their original de∣sign
was conquest: And in this case, it well becomes
the people of England, to consider how far the na∣tion
would have been benefited by the success.</P>
<P>In a general view, there are few conquests that
repay the charge of making them, and mankind
are pretty well convinced, that it can never be
worth their while to go to war for profit sake. If
they are made war upon, their country invaded, or
their existence at stake, it is their duty to defend
and preserve themselves, but in every other light,
and from every other cause, is war inglorious and
detestable. But to return to the case in question—</P>
<P>When conquests are made of foreign countries,
it is supposed that the COMMERCE and DO∣MINION
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
of the country which made them are
extended. But this could neither be the object
nor the consequence of the present war. You en∣joyed
the whole commerce before. It could re∣ceive
no possible addition by a conquest, but on
the contrary, must diminish as the inhabitants were
reduced in numbers and wealth. You had the
DOMINION over the country which you used
to have, and had no complaint to make against her
for breach of any part of the compact between you
and her, or contending against any established cus∣tom,
commercial, political or territorial. The
country and commerce were both your own when
you BEGAN to conquer, in the same manner
and form as they had been your own an hundred
years before. Nations have sometimes been in∣duced
to make conquests for the sake only of re∣ducing
the power of their enemies, or bringing it
to a balance with their own. But this could be no
part of your plan. No foreign authority was
claimed here, neither was any such authority sus∣pected
by you, or acknowledged, or imagined by
us. What then, in the name of heaven, could
you go to war for? or what chance could you
possibly have in the event, but either to hold the
same country which you held before, and that in a
much worse condition, or to lose with an amazing
expence, what you might have retained without a
farthing charges.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189"/>
War never can be the interest of a trading nation,
any more than quarrelling can be profitable to a
man in business. But to make war with those
who trade with us, is like setting a bull-dog upon
a customer at the shop door. The least degree
of common sense shews the madness of the latter,
and it will apply with the same force of conviction
to the former. Piratical nations, having neither
commerce or commodities of their own to lose,
may make war upon all the world, and lucratively
find their account in it. But it is quite otherwise
with Britain. For, besides the stoppage of trade in
time of war, she exposes more of her own property
to be lost, than she has the chance of taking from
others. Some ministerial gentlemen in parliament
have mentioned the greatness of her trade, as an
apology for the greatness of her loss. This is mise∣rable
politics indeed! because, it ought to have been
given as a reason for her not engaging in a war at
first. The coast of America commands the West
India trade, almost as effectually as the coast of
Africa does that of the Streights, and England can
no more carry to the former, without the consent
of America, than she can the latter without a Me∣diterranean
pass.</P>
<P>In whatever light the war with America is con∣sidered
upon commercial principles, it is evidently
the interest of the people of England not to sup∣port
it; and why it has been supported so long
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
against the clearest demonstrations of truth and na∣tional
advantage, is to me, and must be to all the
reasonable world, a matter of actonishment. Per∣haps,
it may be said, that I live in America, and
write this from interest. To this I reply, that my
principles are universal. My attachment is to all
the world, and not to any particular part, and if
what I advance is right, no matter where, or who
it comes from. We have given the proclamation
of your commissioners a currency in our newspa∣pers,
and I have no doubt but you will give this a
place in yours. To oblige and be obliged is fair.</P>
<P>Before I dismiss this part of my address, I shall
mention one more circumstance in which I think
the people of England have been equally mistaken;
and then proceed to other matter.</P>
<P>There is such an idea existing in the world, as
that of NATIONAL HONOUR, and this
falsely understood, is oftentimes the cause of war. In
a christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem
to have stood still at individual civilization, and
to retain as nations, all the original rudeness of
nature. Peace by treaty, is only a cessation of vio∣lence,
for a reformation of sentiment. It is a sub∣stitute
for a principle that is wanting, and ever will
be wanting till the idea of NATIONAL HO∣NOUR
be rightly understood. As individuals,
we profess ourselves christians, but as nations, we are
heathens, Romans, and what not. I remember the
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House of
Commons, and that in the time of peace, "That
the city of Madrid laid in ashes, was not a sufficient
atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder of
an English sloop of war." I do not ask whether
this is christianity or morality, I ask whether it is
decency? whether it is proper language for a na∣tion
to use? In private life we should call it by the
plain name of bullying, and the elevation of rank
cannot alter its character. It is, I think, exceed∣ingly
easy to define, what ought to be understood by
national honour, for that which is the best character
for an individual, is the best character for a nation;
and wherever the latter exceeds or falls beneath
the former, there is a departure from the line of
true greatness.</P>
<P>I have thrown out this observation with a design
of applying it to Great Britain. Her idea of na∣tional
honour seems devoid of that benevolence of
heart, that universal expansion of philanthropy,
and that triumph over the rage of vulgar prejudice,
without which, man is inferior to himself, and a
companion of common animals. To know whom
she shall regard or dislike, she asks what country
they are of, what religion they profefs, and what
property they enjoy. Her idea of national honour
seems to consist in national insult, and that to be a
great people, is to be neither a christian, a philoso∣pher,
or a gentleman, but to threaten with the rude∣ness
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
of a bear, and to devour with the ferocity of a
lion. This, perhaps, may found harsh and un∣courtly,
but it is too true, and the more is the pity.</P>
<P>I mention this only as her general character.
But towards America she has observed no character
at all, and destroyed by her conduct what she as∣sumed
in her title. She set out with the title of Pa∣rent
or Mother Country. The association of ideas
which naturally accompany this expression, are
filled with every thing that is fond, tender, and
forbearing. They have an energy particular to
themselves, and overlooking the accidental attach∣ment
of common affections, apply with peculiar
softness to the first feelings of the heart. It is a po∣litical
term which every mother can feel the force
of, and every child can judge of. It needs no
painting of mine to set it off, for nature only
can do it justice.</P>
<P>But has any part of your conduct to America
corresponded with the title you set up? If in your
general national character you are unpolished and
severe, in this you are inconsistent and unnatural,
and you must have exceeding false notions of na∣tional
honour, to suppose that the world can admire
a want of humanity, or that national honour de∣pends
on the violence of resentment, the inflexibi∣lity
of temper, or the vengeance of execution.</P>
<P>I would willingly convince you, and that with as
much temper as the times will suffer me to do,
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
that as you opposed your own interest by quarrelling
with us, so likewise your national honour, rightly
conceived and understood, was no ways called upon
to enter into a war with America; had you studied
true greatness of heart, the first and fairest ornament
of mankind, you would have acted directly con∣trary
to all that you have done, and the world would
have ascribed it to a generous cause; besides which,
you had (though with the assistance of this country)
secured a powerful name by the last war. You
were known and dreaded abroad; and it would have
been wise in you to have suffered the world to have
slept undisturbed under that idea. It was to you a
force existing without expence. It produced to you
all the advantages of real power, and you were
stronger through the universality of that charm
than any future fleets and armies may probably make
you. Your greatness was so secured and inter∣woven
with your silence, that you ought never to
have awakened mankind, and had nothing to do
but to be quiet. Had you been true politicians
you would have seen all this, and continued to draw
from the magic of a name, the force and authority,
of a nation.</P>
<P>Unwise as you were in breaking the charm, you
were still more unwise in the manner of doing of
it. Samson only told the secret, but you have per∣formed
the operation; you have shaven your own
head, and wantonly thrown away the locks. Ame∣rica
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
was the hair from which the charm was
drawn that infatuated the world. You ought to
have quarrelled with no power; but with her upon
no account. You had nothing to fear from any
condescension you might make. You might have
humoured her, even if there had been no justice in
her claims, without any risk to your reputation;
for Europe fascinated by your same, would have
ascribed it to your benovolence, and America, in∣toxicated
by the great, would have slumbered in
her fetters.</P>
<P>But this method of studying the progress of the
passions, in order to ascertain the probable conduct
of mankind, is a philosophy in politics, which those
who preside at St. James's have no conception of.
They know no other influence than corruption,
and reckon all their probabilities from precedent.
A new case, is to them a new world, and while
they are seeking for a parallel, they get lost. The
talents of Lord Mansfield can be estimated, at best,
no higher than those of a sophist. He understands
the subtleties, but not the elegance of nature? and
by continually viewing mankind through the cold
medium of the law, never thinks of penetrating
into the warmer region of the mind. As for Lord
North, it is his happiness to have in him more phi∣losophy
than sentiment, for he bears flogging like a
top, and sleeps the better for it. His punishment be∣comes
his support, for while he suffers the lash for
his sins, he keeps himself up by twirling about. In
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
politics, he is a good arithmetician, and in every
thing else, nothing at all.</P>
<P>There is one circumstance which comes so much
within Lord North's province as a financier, that I
am surprised it should escape him, which is the dif∣ferent
abilities of the two countries in supporting the
expence; for, strange as it may seem, England is
not a match for America in this particular. By a
curious kind of revolution in accounts, the people
of England seem to mistake their poverty for their
riches, that is, they reckon their national debt as
part of their national wealth. They make the same
kind of error which a man would do, who, after
mortgaging his estate, should add the money bor∣rowed,
to the full value on the estate, in order to
count up his worth, and in this case, he would con∣ceit
that he got rich by running into debt. Just
thus it is with England. The government owed
at the beginning of this war, one hundred and thirty
five millions sterling, and though the individuals
to whom it was due, had a right to reckon their
shares as so much private property, yet to the na∣tion
collectively, it was so much poverty. There
is as effectual limits to public debts as to private
ones, for when once the money borrowed is so great
as to require the whole yearly revenue to discharge
the interest thereon, there is an end to a farther bor∣rowing;
in the same manner as when the interest
of a man's debts amounts to the yearly income of

his estate, there is an end to his credit, This is
nearly the case with England; the interest of her
present debt being at least equal to one half of her
yearly revenue, so that out of ten millions annually
collected by taxes, she has but five she can call her
own.</P>
<P>The very reverse of this was the case with Ame∣rica;
she began the war without any debt upon her,
and in order to carry it on, she neither raised mo∣ney
by taxes, nor borrowed it upon interest, but
created it; and her situation at this time, continues
so much the reverse of yours, that taxing would
make her rich, whereas it would make you poor.
When we shall have sunk the sum which we have
created, we shall then be out of debt, be just as
rich as when we began, and all the while we are
doing it, shall feel no difference, because the
value will rise, as the quantity decreases.</P>
<P>There was not a country in the world, so capa∣ble
of bearing the expence of a war, as America;
not only, because, she was not in debt when she be∣gan,
but because the country is young, and capa∣ble
of infinite improvement, and has an almost
boundless tract of new lands in store, whereas, Eng∣land
has got to her extent of age and growth, and
has no unoccupied land, or property in reserve.
The one is like a young heir, coming to a large im∣proveable
estate, the other like an old man whose
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
chances are over, and his estate mortgaged for half
its worth.</P>
<P>In the second number of the Crisis, which I find
has been re-published in England, I endeavoured to
to set forth the impracticability of conquering
America. I stated every case, that I conceived
could possibly happen, and ventured to predict its
consequence. As my conclusions were drawn not
artfully, but naturally, they have all proved to be
true. I was upon the spot; knew the politics of
America, her strength, and resources; and, by a
train of services, the best in my power to render, was
honoured with the friendship of the congress▪ the ar∣my,
and the people. I considered the cause a just one.
I know and feel it a just one, and under that confi∣dence
never made my own profit or loss an object.
My endeavour was to have the matter well under∣stood
on both sides, and I conceived myself tender∣ing
a general service, by setting forth to the one
the impossibility of being conquered, and to the
other, the impossibility of conquering. Most of
the arguments made use of by the ministry for sup∣porting
the war, are the very arguments that ought
to have been used against supporting it; and the
plans, by which they thought to conquer, are the
very plans, in which they were sure to be defeated.
They have taken every thing up at the wrong end.
Their ignorance is astonishing, and were you in my
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
situation you would see it. They may, perhaps,
have your confidence, but I am persuaded, they
would make very indifferent members of congress.
I know what England is, and what America is,
and from the compound of knowledge, am better
enabled to judge of the issue, than what the king or
any of his ministers can be.</P>
<P>In this number, I have endeavoured to shew the
ill policy and disadvantages of the war. I believe
many of my remarks are new. Those which are
not so, I have studied to improve, and place in a
manner that may be clear and striking, Your fail∣ure,
is, I am persuaded, as certain as fate. America
is above your reach. She is, at least, your equal
in the world, and her independance, neither rests
upon your consent, or can be prevented by your
arms. In short, you spend your substance in vain,
and impoverish yourself without a hope.</P>
<P>But suppose you had conquered America, what
advantage collectively or individually, as mer∣chants,
manufacturers, or conquerors, could you
have looked for. This is an object you seem
never to have attended to. Listening for the
sound of victory, and led away by the phrenzy of
arms, you neglected to reckon either the cost or
the consequences. You must all pay towards the
expence; the poorest among you must bear his
share, and it is both your right and duty to
weigh seriously the matter. Had America been
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
conquered, she might have been parcelled out in
grants to the favourites at court, but no share of
it would have fallen to you. Your taxes would not
have been lessened, because, she would have been in
no condition to have paid any towards your relief.
We are rich by a contrivance of our own, which
would have ceased, as soon as you became masters.
Our Paper money will be of no use in England, and
silver and gold we have none. In the last war you
made many conquests, but were any of your taxes
lessened thereby? On the contrary, were you not
taxed to pay for the charge of making them, and
have not the same been the case in every war?</P>
<P>To the parliament, I beg to address myself in a
particular manner They appear to have supposed
themselves partners in the chace, and to have hunted
with the lion from an expectation of a right in
the booty; but in this, it is most probably they
would, as legislators, have been disappointed.
The case is quite a new one, and many unfore∣seen
difficulties would have arisen thereon. The
parliament claimed a legislative right over America,
and the war originated from that pretence. But
the army is supposed to belong to the crown, and
if America had been conquered through their
means, the claims of the legislature would have
been suffocated in the conquest. Ceded, or con∣quered
countries, are supposed to be out of the au∣thority
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
of parliament. Taxation is exercised over
them by prerogative and not by law. It was attempted
to be done in the Grenades a few years ago, and the
only reason why it was not done, was, because, the
crown had made a prior relinquishment of its claim.
Therefore, parliament have been all this while sup∣porting
measures for the establishment of their au∣thority,
in the issue of which, they would have been
triumphed over by prerogative. This might have
opened a new and interesting opposition between
the parliament and the crown. The crown would
have said that it conquered for itself, and that to
conquer for parliament was an unknown case.
The parliament might have replied, that America
not being a foreign country, but a country in rebel∣lion,
could not be said to be conquered, but reduced;
and thus continued their claim, by disowning the
term. The crown might have rejoined, that how∣ever
America might be considered at first, she be∣came
foreign at last, by a declaration of indepen∣dence,
and a treaty with France; and that her case
being by that treaty, put within the law of nations,
was out of the law of parliament. The parlia∣ment
might have maintained, that as their claim
over America had never been surrendered, so neither
could it be taken away. The crown might have
insisted, that though the claim of parliament could
not be taken away yet being an inferior, might be
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
superceded; and that, whether the claim was with∣drawn
from the object, or the object taken from the
claim, the same separation ensued; and that America
being subdued after a treaty with France, was to all
intents and purposes a regal conquest, and of course
the sole property of the king. The parliament, as
the legal delegates of the people, might have con∣tended
against the term "inferior," and rested the
case upon the antiquity of power; and this would
have brought on a set of very interesting and ration∣al
questions.<LIST>
<ITEM>First, What is the original fountain of power and
honor in any country?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, Whether the prerogative does not be∣long
to the people?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, Whether there is any such thing as the
English constitution?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, Of what use is the crown to the
people?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fifthly, Whether he who invented a crown was
not an enemy to mankind?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sixthly, Whether it is not a shame for a man to
spend a million a year, and do no good for it, and
whether the money might not be better applied?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Seventhly, Whether such a man is not better
dead than alive?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Eighthly, Whether a congress constituted like
that of America, is not the most happy and consist∣ent
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
form of government in the world?</ITEM>
<ITEM>—With a
number of others of the same import.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In short, the contention about the dividend
might have distracted the nation; for nothing is
more common than to agree in the conquest and
quarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a
happy circumstance, that our successes have pre∣vented
the dispute.</P>
<P>If the parliament had been thrown out in their
claim, which it is most probable they would, the
nation likewise would have been thrown out in their
expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid
by the crown, without the parliament, the revenue
arising therefrom, if any could have arose, would
not have gone into the exchequer, but into the
privy purse, and so far from lessening the taxes,
would not even have been added to them, but
served only as pocket money to the crown. The
more I reflect on this matter, the more I am aston∣ished
at the blindness and ill-policy of my coun∣trymen,
whose wisdom seems to operate without
discernment, and their strength without an object.</P>
<P>To the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the
mercantile and manufacturing part thereof, I like∣wise
present my address. It is your interest to see
America an independent country, and not a con∣quered
one. If conquered, she is ruined; and if
ruined, poor; consequently the trade will be a
trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent,
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
she flourishes, and from her flourishing, must your
profits arise. It matters nothing to you, who go∣verns
America, if your manufactures find a con∣sumption
there. Some articles will consequently
be obtained from other places, and right they should;
but the demand of others, will increase by the great
influx of inhabitants which a state of independence and
peace will occasion, and on the final event you may
be enriched. The commerce of America is perfectly
free, and ever will be so. She will consign away
no part of it to any nation. She has not to her
friends, and certainly will not to her enemies,
though it is probable that your narrow-minded poli∣ticians,
thinking to please you thereby, may some
time or other make such an unnecessary proposal.
Trade flourishes best when it is free, and it is weak
policy to attempt to fetter it. Her treaty with
France is on the most liberal and generous princi∣ples,
and the French in their conduct towards her,
have proved themselves to be philosophers, politi∣cians,
and gentlemen.</P>
<P>To the ministry I likewise address myself. You,
gentlemen, have studied the ruin of your country,
from which it is not within your abilities to rescue
her. Your attempts to recover are as ridiculous as
your plans, which involved her, are detestable.
The commissioners being about to depart, will pro∣bably
bring you this, and with it my sixth number
to them; and in so doing they carry back more
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
COMMON SENSE than they brought, and you
will likewise have more than when you sent them.</P>
<P>Having thus addressed you severally, I conclude
by addressing you collectively. It is a long lane
that has no turning. A period of sixteen years of
misconduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough
for any one nation to suffer under; and upon a sup∣position
that war is not declared between France
and you, I beg to place a line of conduct before
you that will easily lead you out of all your trou∣bles.
It has been hinted before, and cannot be too
much attended to.</P>
<P>Suppose America had remained unknown to
Europe till the present year, and that Mr. Banks
and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the
world, had made the first discovery of her in the
self same condition she is now in, of arts, arms,
numbers, and civilization. What, I ask, in that
case, would have been your conduct towards her,
for THAT will point out what it ought to be
now? The problems and their solutions are
equal, and the right line of the one is the parallel of
the other. The question takes in every circum∣stance
that can possibly arise. It reduces politics to
a simple thought, and is moreover a mode of in∣vestigation,
in which, while you are studying your
interest, the simplicity of the case will cheat you into
good temper. You have nothing to do but to sup∣pose
you have found America, and she appears
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
found to your hand, and, while in the joy of your
heart you stand still to admire her, the path of
politics rises straight before you.</P>
<P>Were I disposed to paint a contrast, I could easily
set off what you have done in the present case
against what you would have done in THAT case,
and, by justly opposing them, conclude a picture
that would make you blush. But, as when any of
the prouder passions are hurt, it is much better phi∣losophy
to let a man slip into a good temper, than
to attack him in a bad one; for that reason, there∣fore,
I only state the case, and leave yourselves to
reflect upon it.</P>
<P>To go a little back into politics, it will be found
that the true interests of Britain lay in proposing and
promoting the independence of America immedi∣ately
after the last peace; for the expence which
Britain had then incurred by defending America,
as her own dominions, ought to have shewn her the
policy and necessity of changing the STILE of the
country, as the best probable method of preventing
future wars and expence, and the only method by
which she could hold the commerce without the
charge of sovereignty. Besides which, the title
she assumed of parent country, led to, and pointed
out, the propriety, wisdom and advantage of a sepa∣ration;
for as in private life, children grow into
men, and, by setting up for themselves, extend and
secure the interest of the whole family, so in the
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
settlement of colonies large enough to admit of
maturity, the same policy should be pursued, and
the same consequences would follow. Nothing
hurts the affections both of parents and children
so much, as living too closely connected, and keep∣ing
up the distinction too long. Domineering will
not do over those, who by a progress in life are
become equal in rank to their parents, that is, when
they have families of their own; and though they
may conceive themselves the subjects of their ad∣vice,
will not suppose them the objects of their
government. I do not, by drawing this parallel,
mean to admit the title of PARENT COUN∣TRY,
because, if due any where, it is due to Eu∣rope
collectively, and the first settlers from Eng∣land
were driven here by prosecution. I mean
only to introduce the term for the sake of policy,
and to show from your title, the line of your
interest.</P>
<P>When you saw the state of strength and opu∣lence,
and that by her own industry, which America
had arrived at, you ought to have advised her to
have set up for herself, and proposed an alliance of
interest with her, and, in so doing, you would have
drawn, and that at her own expence, more real ad∣vantage,
and more military supplies and assistance,
both of ships and men, than from any weak and
wrangling government you could exercise over her.
In short, had you studied only the domestic poli∣tics
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
of a family, you would have learned how to
govern the state; but, instead of this easy and na∣tural
line, you flew out into every thing which was
wild and outrageous, till by following the passion
and stupidity of the pilot, you wrecked the vessel
within sight of the shore.</P>
<P>Having shown what you ought to have done, I
now proceed to shew the reason why it was not done.
The caterpillar circle of the court, had an interest
to pursue distinct from, and opposed to yours, for
though by the independence of America, and an
alliance therewith, the trade would have continued,
if not increased, as in many articles neither country
can go to a better market, and, though by defend∣ing
and protecting herself, she would have been no
expence to you, and consequently your national
charges would have decreased, and your taxes might
have been proportionally lessened thereby; yet the
striking off so many places from the court calendar
was put in opposition to the interest of the nation.
The loss of thirteen government ships, with their
appendages here and in England, is a shocking
sound in the ear of a hungry courtier. <HI>Your pre∣sent
king and minister will be the ruin of you; and
you had better risk a revolution and call a congress,
than be thus led on from madness to despair, and
from despair to ruin. America has set you the ex∣ample,
and may you follow it and be sree.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208"/>
I now come to the last part—a war with France.
This is what no man in his senses will advise you to,
and all good men would wish to prevent. Whether
France will declare war against you, is not for me
in this place to mention, or to hint even if I knew
it, but it must be madness in you to do it first.
The matter is now come to a full crisis, and peace
is easy, if willingly set about. Whatever you may
think, France has behaved handsomely to you.
She would have been unjust to herself to have acted
otherwise than she did; and having accepted our
offer of alliance, she gave you genteel notice of it.
There was nothing in her conduct reserved or in∣delicate;
and, while she announced her determina∣tion
to support her treaty, she left you to give the
first offence. America, on her part, has exhibited
a character of firmness to the world. Unprepared
and unarmed, without form or government, she
singly opposed a nation that domineered over half
the globe. The greatness of the deed demands
respect; and, though you may feel resentment, you
are compelled both to WONDER and AD∣MIRE.</P>
<P>Here I rest my arguments, and finish my ad∣dress,
such as it is: it is a gift, and you are welcome.
It was always my design to dedicate a CRISIS to
you, when the time should come that would pro∣perly
MAKE IT A CRISIS; and when, likewise,
I should catch myself in a temper to write it, and
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
suppose you in a condition to read it. THAT
time is now arrived, and with it the opportunity of
conveyance. For the commissioners—POOR
COMMISSIONERS! having proclaimed, that
"YET FORTY DAYS AND NINEVEH
SHALL BE OVERTHROWN" have waited
out the date, and, discontented with their God, are
returning to their gourd. And all the harm I wish
them, is, that it may not WITHER about their
cars, and that they may not make their exit in the
belly of a whale.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>COMMON SENSE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P.S. Though, in the tranquility of my mind, I
have concluded with a laugh, yet I have something
to mention to the COMMISSIONERS, which to
them is serious, and worthy their attention. Their
authority is derived from an act of parliament,
which likewise describes and LIMITS their OF∣FICIAL
powers. Their commission, therefore,
is only a recital, and personal investiture, of those
powers, or a nomination and description of the per∣sons
who are to execute them. Had it contained
any thing contrary to, or gone beyond the line of,
the written law from which it is derived and by
which it is bound, it would, by the English consti∣tution,
have been treason in the crown, and the
king been subject to an impeachment. He dared
not, therefore, put in his commission what you
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
have put in your proclamation, that is, he dared not
have authorised you, in that commission, to burn
and destroy, or to threaten to burn and destroy, any
thing in America. You are both in the ACT, and
in the COMMISSION, stiled COMMISSION∣ERS
FOR RESTORING PEACE, and the
methods for doing it are there pointed out. Your
last proclamation is signed by you, as commission∣ers
UNDER THAT ACT. You make parlia∣ment
the patron of its contents. Yet in the body
of it, you insert matters contrary both to the spirit
and letter of the act, and what likewise your king
dared not have put in his commission to you. The
state of things in England, gentlemen, is too tick∣lish
for you to run hazards. You are ACCOUNT∣ABLE
TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE EX∣ECUTION
OF THAT ACT ACCORDING
TO THE LETTER OF IT. Your heads may
pay for breaking it, for you certainly have broke it
by exceeding it. And as a friend, who would wish
you to escape the paw of the lion as well as the
belly of the whale, I civilly hint to you, TO
KEEP WITHIN COMPASS.</P>
<P>Sir Harry Clinton, strictly speaking, is as ac∣countable
as the rest; though a general, he is like∣wise
a commissioner, acting under a superior autho∣rity.
His first obedience is to the act; and his plea
of being a general, will not and cannot clear him as
a commissioner, for that would suppose the crown,
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
in its single capacity, to have the power of dispen∣sing
with a single act of parliament. Your situa∣tions,
gentlemen, are nice and critical, and the
more so, because England is unsettled. Take
heed! Remember the times of Charles the First!
For Laud and Stafford fell by trusting to a hope
like yours.</P>
<P>Having thus shewn you the danger of your pro∣clamation,
I now shew you the folly of it. The
means contradict the design. You threaten to
lay waste, in order to render America a useless ac∣quisition
of alliance to France. I reply, that the
more destruction you commit, (if you could do it,)
the more valuable to France you make that alli∣ance.
You can destroy only houses and goods;
and by so doing you encrease our demand upon
her for materials and merchandize; for the wants
of one nation, provided it has FREEDOM and
CREDIT, naturally produces riches to the other;
and as you can neither ruin the land, nor prevent
the vegetation, you would encrease the exportation
of our produce in payment, which, to her, would
be a new fund of wealth. In short, had you cast
about for a plan on purpose to enrich your enemies,
you could not have hit upon a better.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addressed to the People of England.</HEAD>
<P>"TRUSTING, (says the king of England in
his speech of November last) in the Divine
Providence, and in the justice of my cause, I am
firmly resolved to prosecute the war with vigour,
and to make every exertion in order to compel
our enemies to equitable terms of peace and ac∣commodation." To this declaration the United
States of America, and the confederated powers of
Europe, will reply, <HI>if Britain will have war, she
shall have enough of it.</HI></P>
<P>Five years have nearly elapsed since the com∣mencement
of hostilities, and every campaign, by
a gradual decay, has lessened your ability to conquer,
without producing a serious thought on your con∣dition
or your fate. Like a prodigal lingering in an
habitual consumption, you feel the relics of life, and
mistake them for recovery. New schemes, like
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
new medicines, have administered fresh hopes, and
prolonged the disease instead of curing it. A
change of generals, like a change of physicians,
served only to keep the flattery alive, and furnish
new pretences for new extravagance.</P>
<P><HI>"Can Britain fail</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitehead's New Year's Ode, 1776.</NOTE><HI>?</HI>" Has been proudly asked
at the commencement of every enterprize, and
that <HI>"whatever she wills is fate</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ode at the installation of lord North, for chancellor of the University of Oxford.</NOTE>," has been given
with the solemnity of prophetic confidence, and
though the question has been constantly replied to
by disappointment, and the prediction falsified by
misfortune, yet still the insult continued, and your
catalogue of national evils encreased therewith.
Eager to persuade the world of her power, she con∣sidered
destruction as the minister of greatness, and
conceived that the glory of a nation, like that of an
Indian, lay in the number of its scalps, and the mi∣series
it inflicts.</P>
<P>Fire, sword and want, as far as the arms of Bri∣tain
could extend them, have been spread with
wanton cruelty along the coast of America; and
while you, remote from the scene of suffering, had
nothing to lose, and as little to dread, the informa∣tion
reached you like a tale of antiquity, in which
the distance of time defaces the conception, and
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
changes the severest sorrows into conversable amuse∣ment.</P>
<P>This makes the second paper, addressed, per∣haps
in vain, to the people of England. That ad∣vice
should be taken, wherever example has
failed, or precept be regarded, where warning is
ridiculed, is like a picture of hope resting on de∣spair:
But when time shall stamp with universal
currency, the facts you have long encountered with
a laugh, and the irresistable evidence of accumula∣ted
losses, like the hand writing on the wall, shall
add terror to distress, you will then, in a conflict of
sufferings, learn to sympathize with others by feel∣ing
for yourselves.</P>
<P>The triumphant appearance of the combined
fleets in the channel, and at your harbour's mouth,
and the expedition of captain Paul Jones, on the
western and eastern coast of England and Scotland,
will, by placing you in the condition of an endan∣gered
country, read to you a stronger lecture on the
calamities of invasion, and bring to your minds a
truer picture of promiscuous distress, than the most
finished rhetoric can describe, or the keenest imagi∣nation
can conceive.</P>
<P>Hitherto, you have experienced the expences,
but nothing of the miseries of war. Your disap∣pointments
have been accompanied with no im∣mediate
suffering, and your losses came to you only
by intelligence. Like fire at a distance, you heard
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
not even the cry; you felt not the danger, you saw
not the confusion. To you, every thing has been
foreign, but the taxes to support it. You knew
not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with an
armed enemy in the streets. You were strangers
to the distressing scene of a family in flight, and
the thousand restless cares, and tender sorrows that
incessantly arose. To see women and children
wandering in the severity of winter with the broken
remains of a well furnished house, and seeking shelter
in every crib and hut, were matters you had no con∣ception
of. You knew not what it was to stand
by and see your goods chopt up for fuel, and your
beds ript to pieces to make packages for plunder.
The misery of others, like a tempestuous night, ad∣ded
to the pleasures of your own security. You
even enjoyed the storm, by contemplating the dif∣ference
of conditions, and that which carried sor∣row
into the breast of thousands, served but to
heighten in you a species of tranquil pride.—Yet
these are but the fainter sufferings of war, when
compared with carnage and slaughter, the miseries
of a military hospital, or a town in flames.</P>
<P>The people of America by anticipating distress,
had fortified their minds against every species you
could inflict. They had resolved to abandon their
homes, to resign them to destruction, and to seek
new settlements, rather than submit. Thus fa∣miliarized
to misfortune, before it arrived, they
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
bore their portion with less regret: The justness
of their cause, was a continual source of consola∣tion,
and the hope of final victory, which never
left them, served to lighten the load, and sweeten
the cup allotted them to drink.</P>
<P>But when their suffering shall become yours, and
invasion be transferred to the invaders, you will
have neither an extended wilderness to fly to, their
cause to comfort you, nor their hopes to rest
on. Distress with them was sharpened with no
self-reflection. They had not brought it on
themselves. On the contrary, they had by every
proceeding endeavoured to avoid it, and had de∣scended
even below the mark of congressional
character to prevent a war. The national honour,
or the advantages of independence, were matters,
which, at the commencement of the dispute, they
had never studied, and it was only at the last moment
that the measure was resolved on. Thus circum∣stanced,
they naturally and conscientiously felt a de∣pendance
upon Providence. They had a clear pre∣tention
to it, and had they failed therein, infidelity
had gained a triumph.</P>
<P>But your condition is the reverse of theirs.
Every thing you suffer you have sought; nay, had
you created mischiefs on purpose to inherit them,
you could not have secured your title by a firmer
deed. The world awakens with no pity at your
complaints. You felt none for others; you de∣serve
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
none for yourselves. Nature doth not inter∣est
herself in cases like yours, but, on the contrary,
turns from them with dislike, and abandons them
to punishment. You may now present memorials
to what court you please, but so far as America is
the object, none will listen. The policy of Europe,
and the propensity there isin every mind to curb
insulting ambition, and bring cruelty to judgment,
are unitedly against you; and where nature and in∣terest
reinforces each other, the compact is too in∣timate
to be dissolved.</P>
<P>Make but the case of others your own, and your
own theirs, and you will then have a clear idea of
the whole. Had France acted towards her colo∣nies
as you have done, you would have branded
her with every epithet of abhorrence; and had you
like her, stept in to succour a struggling people, all
Europe must have echoed with your own applauses.
But entangled in the passion of dispute, you see it
not as you ought, and form opinions thereon which
suit with no interest but your own. You wonder
America does not rise in union with you to im∣pose
on herself a portion of your taxes, and
reduce herself to unconditional submission.
You are amazed that the southern powers of Europe
do not assist you in conquering a country, which is
afterwards to be turned against themselves; and
that the northern ones do not contribute to reinstate
you in America, who already enjoy the market for
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
naval stores by the separation. You seem surprized
that Holland does not pour in her succours, to
maintain you mistress of the seas, when her own
commerce is suffering by your act of navigation,
or that any country should study her own interests
while yours is on the carpet.</P>
<P>Such excesses of passionate folly, and unjust, as
well as unwise resentment, have driven you on,
like Pharoah, to unpitied miseries, and while
the importance of the quarrel shall perpetuate your
disgrace, the flag of America will carry it round
the world. The natural feelings of every rational
being will take against you, and wherever the story
shall be told, you will have neither excuse nor con∣solation
left. With an unsparing hand, and an unsa∣tiable
mind, you have havocked the world, both to
gain dominion, and to lose it; and while in a phrenzy
of avarice and ambition, the east and the west are
doomed to tributary bondage, you rapidly earned
destruction as the wages of a nation.</P>
<P>At the thoughts of a war at home, every man
amongst you ought to tremble. The prospect is far
more dreadful there than in America. Here the party
that was against the measures of the continent,
were, in general, a kind of neutrals, who added
strength to neither army. There does not exist a
being so devoid of sense and sentiment as to covet
"UNCONDITIONAL SUBMISSION," and
therefore no man in America could be with you in
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
principle. Several, might, from a cowardice of
mind, PREFER it to the hardships and dangers
of OPPOSING it; but the same disposition that
gave them such a choice, unfitted them to act either
for or against. But England is rent into parties, with
equal shares of resolution. The principle which
produced the war, divides the nation. Their ani∣mosities
are in the highest state of fermentation, and
both sides by a call of the militia are in arms. No
human foresight can discern, no conclusion can be
formed, what turn a war might take, if once set on
by an invasion. She is not now in a fit disposition
to make a common cause of her own affairs, and
having no conquests to hope for abroad, and nothing
but expences arising at home, her every thing is
staked upon a defensive combat, and the further
she goes, the worse she is off.</P>
<P>There are situations a nation may be in, in which
peace or war, abstracted from every other considera∣tion,
may be politically right or wrong. When
nothing can be lost by a war, but what must be lost
without it, war is then the policy of that country;
and such was the situation of America at the com∣mencement
of hostilities; But when no security can
be gained by a war, but what may be accomplished
by a peace, the cafe becomes reversed, and such now
is the situation of England.</P>
<P>That America is beyond the reach of conquest,
is a fact which experience has shewn, and time con∣firmed;
and this admitted, what, I ask, is now the
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
object of contention; If there be any honour in
pursuing self-destruction with inflexible passion: if
national suicide be the perfection of national glory,
you may, with all the pride of criminal happiness,
expire unenvied, and unrivalled.—But when the
tumult of war shall cease, and the tempest of pre∣sent
passions be succeeded by calm reflection, or
when those, who surviving its fury, shall inherit
from you, a legacy of debts and misfortunes, when
the yearly revenue shall scarcely be able to discharge
the interest of the one, and no possible remedy be
left for the other: Ideas, far different to the pre∣sent,
will arise, and embitter the remembrance of
former follies. A mind disarmed of its rage, feels
no pleasure in contemplating a frantic quarrel.
Sickness of thought, the sure consequence of con∣duct
like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment, no
relish for resentment; and though, like a man in a
fit, you feel not the injury of the struggle, nor dis∣tinguish
between strength and disease, the weakness,
will, nevertheless, be proportioned to the violence
and the sense of pain, encrease with the recovery.</P>
<P>To what persons, or to whose system of politics
you owe your present state of wretchedness, is a
matter of total indifference to America. They
have contributed, however unwillingly, to set her
above themselves; and she, in the tranquillity of
conquest, resigns the enquiry. The case now, is
not so properly, who began the war, as who conti∣nues
it. That there are men in all countries to
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
whom a state of war is a mine of wealth, is a fact ne∣ver
to be doubted. Characters like these, naturally
breed in the putrefaction of distempered times, and
after fattening on the disease, they perish with it,
or impregnated with the stench, retreat into obscu∣rity.</P>
<P>But there are several erroneous notions, to
which you likewise owe a share of your misfortunes,
and which, if continued, will only increase your
trouble and your losses. An opinion hangs about
the gentlemen of the minority, that America would
relish measures under THEIR administration,
which she would not from the present cabinet.
On this rock lord Chatham would have split had he
gained the helm, and several of his survivors are
steering the same course. Such distinctions in the
infancy of the argument, had some degree of foun∣dation,
but they now serve no other purpose than
to lengthen out a war, in which the limits of the
dispute, being fixt by the fate of arms, and guaran∣tied
by treaties, are not to be changed, or altered
by trivial circumstances.</P>
<P>The ministry and many of the minority sacrifice
their time in disputing on a question, with which,
they have nothing to do, namely, whether America
shall be independent or not? Whereas, the only
question that can come under their determination,
is, whether they will accede to it or not? They
confound a military question with a political one,
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
and undertake to supply by a vote, what they lost
by a battle. Say, she shall not be independent,
and it will signify as much, as if they voted against
a decree of fate, or say that she shall, and she will
be no more independent than before. Questions,
which when determined, cannot be executed, serve
only to shew the folly of dispute, and the weakness
of the disputants.</P>
<P>From a long habit of calling America your own,
you suppose her governed by the same prejudices
and conceits which govern yourselves. Because
you have set up a particular denomination of reli∣gion
to the exclusion of all others, you imagine she
must do the same; and, because you, with an
unsociable narrowness of mind, have cherished
against France and Spain, you suppose her alliance
must be defective in friendship. Copying her no∣tions
of the world from you, she formerly thought
as you instructed, but now feeling herself free, and
the prejudice removed, she thinks, and acts upon a
different system. It frequently happens, that in
proportion as we are taught to dislike persons and
countries, not knowing why, we feel an ardour of
esteem upon a removal of the mistake: It seems
as if something was to be made amends for, and
we eagerly give into every office of friendship, to
atone for the injury of the error.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223"/>
But, perhaps, there is something in the extent
of countries, which, among the generality of peo∣ple,
insensibly communicates extension of the mind.
The soul of an islander in its native state, seems
bounded by the foggy confines of the water's edge,
and all beyond, affords to him matters only for
profit or curiosity—not for friendship. His island
is to him, his world, and fixt to that, his every
thing centers in it; while those, who are inhabi∣tants
of a continent, by casting their eye over a
larger field, take in likewise a larger intellectual
circuit, and thus approaching nearer to an ac∣quaintance
with the universe, their atmosphere of
thought is extended, and their liberality fills a wider
space. In short, our minds seem to be measured
by countries when we are men, as they are by
places, when we are children, and until something
happens to disentangle us from the prejudice, we
serve under it without perceiving it.</P>
<P>In addition to this, it may be remarked, that
men who study any universal science, the principles
of which are universally known or admitted, and
applied without distinction to the common benefit
of all countries, obtain thereby a larger share of
philanthropy than those who only study national
arts and improvements. Natural philosophy,
mathematics and astronomy, carry the mind from
the country to the creation, and give it a fitness
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
suited to the extent. It was not Newton's honour,
neither could it be his pride, that he was an En∣glishman,
but that he was a philosopher: The
Heavens had liberated him from the prejudices of
an island, and science had expanded his soul as
boundless as his studies.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. X.</HEAD>
<P>HAD America pursued her advantages with
half the spirit she resisted her misfortunes, she
would, before now, have been a conquering,
and a peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of
soft tranquillity, she rested on her hopes, and ad∣versity
only has convulsed her into action. Whe∣ther
subtlety or sincerity, at the close of the last
year, induced the enemy to an appearance for
peace, is a point not material to know; it suffi∣cient
that we see the effects it has had on
our politics, and that we sternly rise to resent the
delusion.</P>
<P>The war, on the part of America, has been a
war of natural feelings. Brave in distress; serene
in conquest; drowsy while at rest; and in every
situation generously disposed to peace. A danger∣ous
calm, and a most heightened zeal, have, as cir∣cumstances
varied, succeeded each other. Every
passion, but that of despair, has been called to a
tour of duty; and so mistaken has been the enemy,
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
of our abilities and disposition, that when she sup∣posed
us conquered, we rose the conquerors. The
extensiveness of the United States, and the variety
of their resources; the universality of their cause,
the quick operation of their feelings, and the simi∣larity
of their sentiments, have, in every trying situ∣ation,
produced <HI>a something,</HI> which favoured by
Providence, and pursued with ardour, has accom∣plished
in an instant the business of a campaign.
We have never deliberately sought victory, but
snatched it; and bravely undone in an hour, the
plotted operations of a season,</P>
<P>The reported fate of Charlestown, like the mis∣fortunes
of seventy-six, has at last called forth a
spirit, and kindled up a flame, which, perhaps, no
other event could have produced. If the enemy
has circulated a falshood, they have unwisely ag∣gravated
us into life, and if they have told us a
truth, they have unintentionally done us a service.
We were returning with folded arms from the fa∣tigues
of war, and thinking and setting leisurely
down to enjoy repose. The dependance that has
been put upon Charlestown, threw a drowsiness over
America. We looked on the business done—
The conflict over—the matter settled—or that all
which remained unfinished would follow of it∣self.
In this state of dangerous relax, exposed to
the poisonous insusions of the enemy, and having
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
no common danger to attract our attention, we
were extinguishing by stages the ardour we began
with, and surrendering by piece meals the virtue
that defended us.</P>
<P>Afflicting as the loss of Charlestown may be, yet
if it universally rouze us from the slumber of a
twelvemonths past, and renew in us the spirit of
former days, it will produce an advantage more
important than its loss. America ever <HI>is</HI> what she
<HI>thinks</HI> herself to be. Governed by sentiment,
and acting her own mind, she becomes, as she
pleases, the victor or the victim.</P>
<P>It is not the conquest of towns, nor the acci∣dental
capture of garrisons, that can reduce a coun∣try
so extensive as this. The sufferings of one part
can ever be relieved by the exertions of another,
and there is no situation the enemy can be in, that
does not afford to us the same advantages she seeks
herself. By dividing her force, she leaves every
post attackable. It is a mode of war that carries
with it a confession of weakness, and goes on the
principle of distress, rather than conquest.</P>
<P>The decline of the enemy is visible, not only in
their operations, but in their plans; Charlestown
originally made but a secondary object in the sys∣tem
of attack, and it is now become their princi∣pal
one, because they have not been able to succeed
elsewhere. It would have carried a cowardly ap∣pearance
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
in Europe, had they formed their grand
expedition in seventy-six, against a part of the con∣tinent,
where there was no army, or not a sufficient
one to oppose them; but failing year after year in
their impressions here, and to the eastward and
northward, they deserted their first capital design,
and prudently contenting themselves with what
they can get, give a flourish of honour to conceal
disgrace.</P>
<P>But this piecemeal work is not conquering the
continent. It is a discredit in them to attempt it,
and in us to suffer it. It is now full time to put an
end to a war of aggravations, which, on one side,
has no possible object, and on the other, has every
inducement which honour, interest, safety and hap∣piness
can inspire. If we suffer them much longer
to remain among us, we shall become as bad as
themselves. An association of vices will reduce us
more than the sword. A nation hardened in the
practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by
it, than a young country newly corrupted. We
are not a match for them in the line of advantage∣ous
guilt, nor they to us on the principles we bravely
set out with. Our first days were our days of honour.
They have marked the character of America
wherever the story of her wars are told; and con∣vinced
of this, we have nothing to do, but wisely
and unitedly to tread the well known track.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229"/>
The progress of a war is often as ruinous to indi∣viduals,
as the issue of it is to a nation; and it is
not only necessary that our forces be such, that we
be conquerors in the end, but that by timely ex∣ertions
we be secure in the interim. The present
campaign will afford an opportunity which has
never presented itself before, and the preparations
for it are equally necessary, whether Charlstown
stand or fall. Suppose the first, it is in that case
only a failure of the enemy, not a defeat. All the
conquest a besieged town can hope for, is, not to be
conquered; and compelling an enemy to raise the
siege, is to the besieged a victory. But there must
be a probability, amounting almost to certainty,
that would justify a garrison marching out to attack
a retreat. Therefore, should Charlestown not be
taken, and the enemy abandon the siege, every
other part of the continent should prepare to meet
them; and on the contrary, should it be taken, the
same preparations are necessary to balance the loss,
and put ourselves in a condition to co-operate with
our allies, immediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>We are not now fighting our battles alone, as
we were in seventy six. England, from a malici∣ous
disposition to America, has not only not declared
war against France and Spain, but the better to
prosecute her passions here, has afforded those two
powers no military object, and avoids them, to
distress us. She will suffer her West India islands
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
to be over-run by France, and her southern settle∣ments
taken by Spain, rather than quit the object
that gratifies revenge. This conduct, on the part
of Britain, has pointed out the propriety of France
sending a naval and land force to co - operate
with America on the spot. Their arrival cannot
be very distant, nor the ravages of the enemy long.
In the mean time the part necessary to us needs no
illustration. The recruiting the army, and procu∣ring
the supplies, are the two things needful, and a
capture of either of the enemy's divisions, will re∣store
to America peace and plenty.</P>
<P>At a crisis, big, like the present, with expectation
and events, the whole country is called to unani∣mity
and exertion. Not an ability ought now to
sleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good,
nor even a whisper to pass that militates against it.
The necessity of the case, and the importance of
the consequences, admit no delay from a friend,
no apology from an enemy. To spare now,
would be the height of extravagance, and to con∣sult
present ease, would be to sacrifice it, perhaps,
for ever.</P>
<P>America, rich in patriotism and produce, can want
neither men nor supplies, when a serious necessity
call them forth. The slow operation of taxes,
owing to the extensiveness of collection, and their
depreciated value before they arrived in the trea∣sury,
have in many instances, thrown a burthen
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
upon government, which has been artfully inter∣preted
by the enemy into a general decline through∣out
the country. Yet this, inconvenient as it may
at first appear, is not only remediable, but may be
turned to an immediate advantage; for it makes
no real difference, whether a certain number of
men, or company of militia (and in this country,
every man is a militia man) are directed by law to
send a recruit at their own expence, or whether a
tax is laid on them for that purpose, and the man
hired by government afterwards. The first, if
there is any difference, is both cheapest and best,
because it saves the expence which would attend
collecting it as a tax, and brings the man sooner into
the field, than the modes of recruiting formerly
used. And on this principle, a law has been passed
in this state, for recruiting two men from each com∣pany
of militia, which will add upwards of a thou∣sand
to the force of the country.</P>
<P>But the flame, which has broke forth in this city
since the report from New York, of the loss of
Charlestown, not only does honour to the place,
but, like the blaze of seventy-six, will kindle into
action the scattered sparks throughout America.—
The valour of a country, may be learned by the
bravery of its soldiery, and the general cast of its in∣habitants,
but confidence of success is best discovered
by the active measures pursued by men of property;
and when the spirit of enterprize becomes so uni∣versal
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
as to act at once on all ranks of men, a war
may then, and not till then, be stiled truly popular.</P>
<P>In seventy-six, the ardour of the enterprising
part was considerably checked, by the real revolt of
some, and the coolness of others. But in the pre∣sent
case, there is a firmness in the substance and pro∣perty
of the country to the public cause. An asso∣ciation
has been entered into by the merchants,
tradesmen, and the principal inhabitants of this
city, to receive and support the new state money at
the value of gold and silver; a measure, which,
while it does them honour, will likewise contribute
to their interest, by rendering the operations of the
campaign convenient and effectual.</P>
<P>Neither has the spirit of exertion stopt here. A
voluntary subscription is likewise began, to raise a
fund of hard money to be given as bounties to fill
up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line. It has
been the remark of the enemy, that every thing
in America has been done by the force of govern∣ment;
but when she sees individuals throwing in
their voluntary aids, and facilitating the public mea∣sures
in concert with the established powers of the
country, it will convince her that the cause of
America stands not on the will of a few, but on the
broad foundation of property and popularity.</P>
<P>Thus aided, and thus supported, disaffection
will decline, and the withered head of tyranny ex∣pire
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
in America. The ravages of the enemy will
be short and limited, and like all their former ones,
will produce a victory over themselves.</P>

<P>☞ At the time of writing this number of the
Crisis, the loss of Charlestown, though believed by
some, was more confidently disbelieved by others.
But there ought to be no longer a doubt on the
matter. Charlestown is gone, and I believe, for
the want of a sufficient supply of provisions. The
man that does not now feel for the honour of the
best and noblest cause that ever a country engaged
in, and exert himself accordingly, is no longer
worthy a peaceable residence among a people de∣termined
to be free.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS
EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(On the Subject of Taxation.)</HEAD>
<P>IT is impossible to sit down and think seriously on
the affairs of America, but the original principles
on which she resisted, and the glow and ardour
they inspired, will occur like the undefaced remem∣brance
of a lovely scene. To trace over in imagi∣nation
the purity of the cause, the voluntary sacri∣fices
made to support it, and all the various turnings
of the war in its defence, is at once both paying and
receiving respect. The principles deserve to be
remembered, and to remember them rightly, is
repossessing them. In this indulgence of gene∣rous
recollection, we become gainers by what we
seem to give, and the more we bestow the richer we
become.</P>
<P>So extensively right was the ground on which
America proceeded, that it not only took in every
just and liberal sentiment which could impress the
heart, but made it the direct interest of every class
and order of men to defend the country. The war,
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
on the part of Britain, was originally a war of covet∣ousness.
The sordid, and not the splendid passions
gave it being. The fertile fields, and prosperous
infancy of America, appeared to her as mines for
tributary wealth. She viewed the hive, and disre∣garding
the industry that had enriched it, thirsted for
the honey. But in the present stage of her affairs,
the violence of temper is added to the rage of ava∣rice;
and therefore, that, which at the first setting
out proceeded from purity of principle and public
interest, is now heightened by all the obligations of
necessity; for it requires but little knowledge of hu∣man
nature, to discern what would be the conse∣quence,
were America again reduced to the subjec∣tion
of Britain. Uncontrouled power, in the hands
of an incensed, imperious, and rapacious conqueror,
is an engine of dreadful execution, and woe be to
that country over which it can be exercised. The
names of whig and tory would then be sunk in the
general term of rebel, and the oppression, whatever
it might be, would, with very few instances of ex∣ception,
light equally on all.</P>
<P>Britain did not go to war with America for the
sake of dominion, because she was then in possession;
neither was it for the extension of trade and com∣merce,
because she had monopolized the whole
and the country had yielded to it; neither was it to
extinguish what <HI>she</HI> might call rebellion, because,
before she began, no resistance existed. It could
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
then be from no other motive than avarice, or a
design of establishing, in the first instance, the same
taxes in America as are paid in England (which,
as I shall presently shew, are above eleven times
heavier than the taxes we now pay for the present
year, 1780), or in the second instance, to confiscate
the whole property of America, in case of resistance
and conquest of the latter, of which she had then
no doubt.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to shew what the taxes in
England are, and what the yearly expence of the
present war is to her,—What the taxes of this
country amount to, and what the annual expence of
defending it effectually will be to us; and shall en∣deavour
concisely, to point out the cause of our
difficulties, and the advantages on one side, and the
consequences on the other, in case we do, or do
not put ourselves in an effectual state of defence. I
mean to be open, candid and sincere. I see a uni∣versal
wish to expel the enemy from the country, a
murmuring because the war is not carried on with
more vigour, and my intention is, to shew, as
shortly as possible, both the reason and the remedy.</P>

the interest thereon at five per cent, will be
two millions and an half, therefore the amount of
her taxes now must be fourteen millions, which, on
an average, is not less than forty shillings sterling
per head, men, women and children throughout the
nation. Now as this expence of fifty millions was
borrowed on the hopes of conquering America,
and as it was Avarice which first induced her to
commence the war, how truly wretched and deplo∣rable
would the condition of this country be, were
she, by her own remissness, to suffer an enemy of
such a disposition, and so circumstanced, to reduce
her to subjection.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the revenues of America.</P>
<P>I have already stated the number of souls in Ameri∣ca
to be three millions, and by a calculation I have
made, which I have every reason to believe is suf∣ficiently
right, the whole expence of the war and the
support of the several governments, may be defray∣ed
for two million pounds sterling, annually; which,
on an average, is thirteen shillings and four pence
per head, men, women, and children, and the peace
establishment at the end of the war, will be but three
quarters of a million, or five shillings sterling per
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
head. Now, throwing out of the question every
thing of honour, principle, happiness, freedom and
reputation in the world, and taking it up on the
simple ground of interest, I put the following case.</P>
<P>Suppose Britain was to conquer America, and
as conquerors, was to lay her under no other con∣ditions
than to pay the same proportions towards
her annual revenue which the people of England,
pay; our share in that case, would be six mil∣lion
pounds sterling yearly; can it then be a ques∣tion,
whether it is best to raise two millions to de∣fend
the country and govern it ourselves, and
only three quarters of a million afterwards, or pay
six millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy
govern it.</P>
<P>Can it be supposed that conquerors would chuse
to put themselves in a worse condition than what
they granted to the conquered. In England, the
tax on rum is five shillings and one penny sterling
per gallon, which is one silver dollar and fourteen
coppers. Now would it not be laughable to ima∣gine,
that after the expence they have been at, they
would let either whig or tory in America drink it
cheaper than themselves. Coffee, which is so con∣siderable
an article of consumption and support here,
is there loaded with a duty, which makes the price
between five and six shillings sterling a pound, and
a penalty of fifty pounds sterling on any person de∣tected
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
in roasting it in his own house. There is
scarce an article of life you can eat, drink, wear,
or enjoy, that is not there loaded with a tax; even
the light from heaven is only permited to shine
into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence ster∣ling
per window annually; and the humblest drink
of life, small beer, cannot there be purchased with∣out
a tax of nearly two coppers a gallon, besides a
heavy tax upon the malt, and another on the hops
before it is brewed, exclusive of a land tax on the
earth which produces them. In short, the condi∣tion
of that country in point of taxation is so op∣pressive,
the number of her poor so great, and the
extravagance and rapaciousness of the court so enor∣mous,
that were they to effect a conquest of Ame∣rica,
it is then only that the distresses of America
would begin. Neither would it signify any thing
to a man whether he be whig or tory. The peo∣ple
of England, and the ministry of that country
know us by no such distinctions. What they want
is clear solid revenue, and the modes they would
take to procure it, would operate alike on all.
Their manner of reasoning would be short, because
they would naturally infer, that if we were able to
carry on a war of five or six years against them, we
were able to pay the same taxes which they do.</P>
<P>I have already stated that the expence of conduct∣ing
the present war, and the government of the se∣veral
states, may be done for two millions sterling,
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
and the establishment in time of peace, for three
quarters of a million<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have made the calculations in sterling, because it is a rate generally known in all the states, and because, likewise, it admits of an easy comparison between our expences to support the war, and those of the enemy. Four silver dollars and an half is one pound sterling, and three pence over.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to navy matters, they flourish so well, and
are so well attended in the hands of individuals,
that I think it consistent on every principle of real
use and oeconomy, to turn the navy into hard mo∣ney,
(keeping only three or four packets) and ap∣ply
it to promote the service of the army. We
shall not have a ship the less; the use of them, and
the benefit from them, will be greatly increased, and
their expence saved. We are now allied to a for∣midable
naval power, from whom we derive the
assistance of a navy. And the line in which we
can prosecute the war, so as to reduce the common
enemy, and benefit the alliance most effectually,
will be, by attending closely to the land service.</P>
<P>I estimate the charge of keeping up, and main∣taining
an army, officering them, and all expences
included, sufficient for the defence of the country,
to be equal to the expence of forty thousand men at
thirty pounds sterling per head, which is one million
two hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="243"/>
I likewise allow four hundred thousand pounds
for continental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P>And four hundred thousand pounds for the sup∣port
of the several state governments, the amount
will then be,

<P>I take the proportion of this state, Pennsylvania,
to be an eighth part of the thirteen United States,
the quota then for us to raise will be two hundred
and fifty thousand pounds sterling; two hundred
thousand of which, will be our share for the sup∣port
and pay of the army and continental expences
at home and abroad, and fifty thousand pounds for
the support of state government.</P>
<P>In order to gain an idea of the proportion in
which the raising such a sum will fall, I make the
following calculation:</P>
<P>Pennsylvania contains three hundred and seventy
five thousand inhabitants, men, women, and chil∣dren,
which is likewise an eighth of the whole in∣habitants
of the whole United States: therefore
two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling to
be raised among three hundred and seventy five
thousand persons, is, on an average, thirteen shil∣lings
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
and four pence sterling, per head, per annum,
or something more than one shilling sterling per
month. And our proportion of three quarters of
a million, for the government of the country, in
time of peace, will be ninety three thousand seven
hundred and fifty pounds sterling, fifty thousand of
which will be for the government expences of the
state, and forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty
pounds for continental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The peace establishment then, will, on an ave∣rage,
be five shillings sterling per head. Whereas,
was England now to stop, and the war to cease, her
peace establishment would continue the same as it
is now, viz. forty shillings per head; therefore, was
our taxes necessary for carrying on the war as much
per head, as her's now is, and the difference to be
only whether we should, at the end of the war, pay
at the rate of five shillings per head, or forty
shillings per head, the case needs no thinking of.
But as we can securely defend and keep the coun∣try
for one third less than what our burthen would
be if it was conquered, and support the govern∣ments
afterwards for one eighth of what Britain
would levy on us, and, could I find a miser whose
heart never felt the emotion of a spark of princi∣ciple,
even that man, uninfluenced by every love,
but the love of money, and capable of no attach∣ment
but to his interest, would, and must, from the
frugality which governs him, contribute to the de∣fence
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
of the country, or he ceases to be a miser, and
becomes an ideot. But when we take in with it,
every thing that can ornament mankind; when
the line of our interest becomes the line of
our happiness; when all that can cheer and
animate the heart? when sense of honour, fame,
character at home and abroad, are interwoven, not
only with the security, but the increase of property;
there exists not a man in America, unless he be a
hired emissary, who does not see that his good is
connected with keeping up a sufficient defence.</P>
<P>I do not imagine that an instance can be pro∣duced
in the world, of a country putting herself to
such an amazing charge to conquer and enslave
another, as Britain has done. The sum is too great
for her to think of with any tolerable degree of
temper; and when we consider the burthen she
sustains, as well as the disposition she has shewn,
it would be the height of folly in us, to suppose
that she would not reimburse herself by the most
rapid means, had she once more America within
her power. With such an oppression of expence,
what would an empty conquest be to her? what
relief under such circumstances could she derive
from a victory without a prize! It was money, it
was revenue she first went to war for, and nothing
but <HI>that</HI> would satisfy her. It is not the nature of
avarice to be satisfied with any thing else. Every
passion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode
of operation. Many of them are temporary and
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
fluctuating; they admit of cessation and variety.
But avarice is a fixed uniform passion. It neither
abates of its vigour, nor changes its object; and the
reason why it does not, is founded on the nature
of things, for wealth has not a rival, where avarice
is a ruling passion. One beauty may excel another,
and extinguish from the mind of a man the pictured
remembrance of a former one: But wealth is the
phoenix of avarice, and therefore cannot seek a new
object, because there is not another in the world.</P>
<P>I now pass on to shew the value of the present
taxes, and compare them with the annual expence;
but this I shall preface with a few explanatory re∣marks.</P>
<P>There are two distinct things which make the
payment of taxes difficult; the one is the large and
real value of the sum to be paid, and the other is,
the scarcity of the thing in which the payment is to
be made; and, although these appear to be one
and the same, they are in several instances, not
only different, but the difficulty springs from differ∣ent
causes.</P>
<P>Suppose a tax was to be laid, equal to one half
of what a man's yearly income is, such a tax could
not be paid, because the property could not be
spared; and on the other hand, suppose a very
trifling tax was laid to be collected in <HI>pearls,</HI> such
a tax likewise could not be paid, because it could
not be had. Now any person may see that these
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
are distinct cases, and the latter of them is a repre∣sentation
of ours.</P>
<P>That the difficulty cannot proceed from the
former, that is, from the real value or weight of
the tax is evident at first view, to any person who
will consider it.</P>
<P>The amount of the quota of taxes for this state,
for the present year, 1780, (and so on in proportion
for every other state) is twenty millions of dollars,
which at seventy for one, is but sixty four thousand
two hundred and eighty pounds three shillings ster∣ling,
and on an average, is no more than three shil∣lings
and five pence sterling, per head, per annum,
per man, woman, and child, or 3⅖ pence per head,
per month. Now here is a clear positive fact, that
cannot be contradicted, and which proves that the
difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in
itself it is a trifle, and far from being adequate to
our quota of the expence of the war. The quit-rents
of one penny sterling per acre, on only one
half the state, come to upwards of fifty thousand
pounds, which is almost as much as all the taxes of
the present year, and as those quit-rents made no
part of the taxes then paid, and are now disconti∣nued,
the quantity of money drawn for public ser∣vice
this year, exclusive of the militia fines, which
I shall take notice of in the process of this work, is
less than what was paid, and payable in any year
preceding the revolution, and since the last war;
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
what I mean, is, that the quit-rents and taxes taken
together, came to a larger sum then, than the
present taxes without the quit-rents do now.</P>
<P>My intention by these arguments and calcula∣tions
is, to place the difficulty to the right cause,
and shew that it does not proceed from the weight
or worth of the tax, but from the scarcity of the
medium in which it is paid: and to illustrate this
point still farther, I shall now shew, that if the tax of
twenty millions of dollars, was of four times the real
value it now is, or nearly so, which would be about
two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling,
and would be our full quota, that this sum would
have been raised with more ease, and less felt, than
the present sum of only sixty four thousand two hun∣dred
and eighty pounds.</P>
<P>The convenience or inconvenience of paying a
tax in money arises from the quantity of money that
can be spared out of trade.</P>
<P>When the emissions stopt, the continent was
left in possession of two hundred millions of dollars,
perhaps as equally dispersed as it was possible for
trade to do it. And as no more was to be issued,
the rise or fall of prices could neither increase nor
diminish the quantity. It therefore remained the
same through all the fluctuations of trade and
exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="249"/>
Now had the exchange stood at twenty for one,
which was the rate Congress calculated upon when
they quoted the states the latter end of last year,
trade would have been carried on for nearly four
times less money than it is now, and consequently
the twenty millions would have been spared with
much greater ease, and when collected would have
been of almost four times the value they now are.
And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be
ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required
for trade would be more than at sixty or seventy
for one, and though the value of them would be
less, the difficulty of sparing the money out of
trade would be greater. And on these facts and ar∣guments
I rest the matter, to prove that it is not
the want of property, but the scarcity of the me∣dium,
by which the proportion of property for tax∣ation
is to be measured out, that makes the embar∣rassment
we lie under. There is not money
enough, and what is equally as true, the people
will not let there be money enough.</P>
<P>While I am on the subject of the currency, I
shall offer one remark, which will appear true to
every body, and can be accounted for by nobody,
which is, that the better the times were, the worse the
money grew; and the worse the times were, the
better the money stood. It never depreciated by
any advantage obtained by the enemy. The trou∣bles
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
of seventy-six, and the loss of Philadelphia, in
seventy-seven, made no sensible impression on
it, and every one knows, that the surrender of
Charlestown did not produce the least alteration in
the rate of exchange, which, for long before, and
for more than three months after, stood at sixty for
one. It seems, as if the certainty of its being our
own, made us careless of its value, and that the most
distant thoughts of losing it, made us hug it the
closer, like something we were loth to part with;
or that we depreciate it for our pastime, which,
when called to seriousness by the enemy, we leave off
to renew again at our leisure. In short, our good
luck seems to break us, andour bad make us whole.</P>
<P>Passing on from this digression, I shall now en∣deavour
to bring into one view, the several parts I
have already stated, and form thereon some propo∣sitions,
and conclude.</P>
<P>I have placed before the reader, the average tax
per head, paid by the people in England; which is
forty shillings sterling.</P>
<P>And I have shewn the rate on an average per
head, which will defray all the expence of the war
to us, and support the several governments, without
running the country into debt, which is thirteen
shillings and four pence.</P>
<P>I have shewn what the peace establishment may
be conducted for, viz: an eighth part of what it
would be if under the government of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="251"/>
And I have likewise shewn what the average per
head of the present taxes are, namely, three shillings
and five pence sterling, or 3⅖ per month; and that
their whole yearly value, in sterling, is only sixty
four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds.
Whereas, our quota, to keep the payments equal
with the expences, is two hundred and fifty thousand
pounds. Consequently, there is a deficiency of one
hundred and eighty-five thousand seven hundred and
twenty pounds, and the same proportion of defect,
according to the several quotas, happens in every
other state. And this defect is the cause why the
army has been so indifferently fed, cloathed and
paid. It is the cause, likewise, of the nerveless
state of the campaign, and the insecurity of
the country. Now, if a tax equal to thir∣teen
and four pence per head, will remove all
these difficuties, make people secure in their homes,
leave them to follow the business of their stores and
farms unmolested, and not only keep out, but drive
out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect
of raising this sum will let them in, and produce the
evils which might be prevented—on which
side, I ask, does the wisdom, interest and policy lie;
Or, rather, would it not be an insult to reason to
put the question? The sum, when proportioned out
according to the several abilities of the people, can
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy ruins
hundreds of families.</P>
<P>Look at the destruction done in this city. The
many houses totally destroyed, and others damaged;
the waste of fences in the country round it, besides
the plunder of furniture, forage and provision. I
do not suppose that half a million sterling would
reinstate the sufferers; and does this, I ask, bear any
proportion to the expence that would make us se∣cure.
The damage, in an average, is at least ten
pounds sterling per head, which is as much as thir∣teen
shillings and four pence per head comes to for
fifteen years. The same has happened on the fron∣tiers,
and in the Jerseys, New York, and other
places where the enemy has been—Carolina and
Georgia are likewise suffering the same fate.</P>
<P>That the people generally do not understand the
insufficiency of the taxes to carry on the war, is evi∣dent,
not only from common observation, but
from the construction of several petitions, which
were presented to the assembly of this state, against
the recommendation of Congress of the 18th of
March last, for taking up and funding the present
currency at forty for one, and issuing new money in
its stead. The prayer of the petition was, <HI>That the
currency might be appreciated by taxes</HI> (meaning the
present taxes) <HI>and that part of the taxes be applied
to the support of the army, if the army could not be
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
otherwise supported.</HI> Now it could not have
been possible for such a petition to have been pre∣sented,
had the petitioners known, that so far from
<HI>part</HI> of the taxes being sufficient for the support of
the army, the <HI>whole</HI> of them falls three fourihs short
of the year's expences.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to propose methods by which
a sufficiency of money may be raised, I shall take a
short view of the general state of the country.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the weight of the war, the ra∣vages
of the enemy, and the obstructions she has
thrown in the way of trade and commerce, so soon
does a young country outgrow misfortune, that
America has already surmounted many that once
heavily oppressed her. For the first year or two of
the war, we were shut up within our ports, scarce
venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our
rivers are beautified with large and valuable vessels,
our stores filled with merchandize, and the produce
of the country has a ready market, and an advanta∣geous
price. Gold and silver, that for a while
seemed to have retreated again within the bowels
of the earth, is once more risen into circulation,
and every day adds new strength to trade com∣merce,
and agriculture. In a pamphlet written by
Sir John Dalrymple, and dispersed in America in
the year 1775, he asserted, that, <HI>two twenty gun
ships, nay,</HI> says he, <HI>tenders of those ships, stationed
between Albemarle sound, and Chesapeak bay would
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
shut up the trade of America for</HI> 600 <HI>miles.</HI> How
little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities
of America!</P>
<P>While under the government of Britain, the
trade of this country was loaded with restrictions.
It was only a few foreign ports we were allowed to
sail to. Now it is otherwise; and allowing that
the quantity of trade is but half what it was before
the war, the case must shew the vast advantage of
an open trade, because the present quantity under
her restrictions, could not support itself; from
which I infer, that if half the quantity without the
restrictions can bear itself up nearly, if not quite, as
well as the whole when subject to them, how pros∣perous
must the condition of America be when the
whole shall return open with all the world. By
trade, I do not mean the employment of a mer∣chant
only, but the whole interest and business of
the country taken collectively.</P>
<P>It is not so much my intention, by this publica∣cation,
to propose particular plans for raising mo∣ney,
as it is to shew the necessity and the advanta∣ges
to be derived from it. My principle design is
to form the disposition of the people to such mea∣sures
which I am fully persuaded is their interest
and duty to adopt, and which needs no other force
to accomplish them than the force of being felt.
But as every hint may be useful, I shall throw out
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
a sketch, and leave others to make such improve∣ments
upon it as to them may appear reasonable.</P>
<P>The annual sum wanted is two millions, and the
average rate in which it falls is thirteen shillings and
four pence per head.</P>
<P>Suppose then, that we raise half the sum, and
sixty thousand pounds over. The average rate
thereof, will be seven shillings per head.</P>
<P>In this case, we shall have half the supply
we want, and an annual fund of sixty thousand
pounds, whereon to borrow the other million; be∣cause
sixty thousand pounds is the interest of a
million at six per cent. and if at the end of another
year, we should be obliged by the continuance of
the war, to borrow another million, the taxes will be
increased to seven shillings and sixpence, and thus
for every million borrowed, and an additional tax
equal to sixpence per head must be levied.</P>
<P>The sum then to be raised next year, will be one
million and sixty thousand pounds; one half of
which I would propose should be raised by duties
on imported goods and prize goods, and the other
half by a tax on landed property and houses, or such
other means as each state may devise,</P>
<P>But as the duties on imports and prize goods must
be the same in all the states, therefore the rate per
cent, or what other form the duty shall be laid, must
be ascertained and regulated by Congress, and
ingrafted in that form into the law of each state;
and the monies arising therefrom carried into the
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
treasury of each state. The duties to be paid in
gold or silver.</P>
<P>There are many reasons why a duty on imports
is the most convenient duty or tax that can be col∣lected;
one of which is, because the whole is pay∣able
in a few places in a country, and it likewise ope∣rates
with the greatest ease and equality, because as
every one pays in proportion to what he consumes,
so people, in general, consume in proportion to
what they can afford, and therefore the tax is regu∣lated
by the abilities which every man supposes
himself to have, or in other words every man be∣comes
his own assessor, and pays by a little at a time,
when it suits him to buy. Besides, it is a tax
which people may pay or let alone, by not consu∣ming
the articles; and though the alternative may
have no influence on their conduct, the power of
choosing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For
my own part, it would be a satisfaction to me, was
there a duty on all sorts of liquors during the war,
as in my idea of things, it would be an addition to
the pleasure of society, to know, that when the
health of the army goes round, a few drops from
every glass become theirs. How often have I
heard an emphatical wish, almost accompanied with
a tear, "<HI>Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had
some of this!</HI>" Why then need we suffer under
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
a fruitless sympathy, when there is a way to enjoy
both the wish and the entertainment at once?</P>
<P>But the great national policy of putting a duty
upon imports is, that it either keeps the foreign
trade in our own hands, or draws something for the
defence of the country from every foreigner who
participates it with us.</P>
<P>Thus much for the first half of the taxes, and as
each state will best devise means to raise the other
half, I shall confine my remarks to the resources of
this state:</P>
<P>The quota then of this state, of one million and
and sixty thousand pounds, will be one hundred
and thirty three thousand two hundred and fifty
pounds, the half of which, is sixty six thousand six
hundred and twenty five pounds; and supposing
one fourth part of Pennsylvania inhabited, then a
tax of one bushel of wheat on every twenty acres
of land, one with another, would produce the sum,
and all the present taxes to cease. Whereas the
tythes of the bishops and clergy in England, ex∣clusive
of the taxes, are upwards of half a bushel of
wheat on <HI>every single</HI> acre of land, good and bad,
throughout the nation.</P>
<P>In the former part of this paper, I mentioned
the militia fines, but reserved speaking to the mat∣ter,
which I shall now do: The ground I shall
put it upon is, that two millions sterling a year, will
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
support a sufficient army, and all the expences of
war and government, without having recourse to
the inconvenient method of continually calling men
from their employments, which of all others is the
most expensive and the least substantial. I consi∣der
the revenues created by taxes as the first and
principal thing, and fines only as secondary and ac∣cidental
things. It was not the intention of the
militia law to apply the miltia fines to any thing else
but the support of the militia, neither do they pro∣duce
any revenue to the state, yet these fines amount
to more than all the taxes; for taking the muster-roll
to be sixty thousand men, the fine on forty thou∣sand
who may not attend, will be sixty thousand
pounds sterling, and those who muster, will give up
a portion of time equal to half that sum, and if the
the eight classes should be called within the year,
and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining
forty thousand, would amount to seventy two mil∣lions
of dollars, besides the fifteen shillings on every
hundred pounds property, and the charge of seven
and a half per cent for collecting, in certain in∣stances,
which on the whole, would be upwards of
two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling.</P>
<P>Now if those very fines disable the country
from raising a sufficient revenue, without producing
an equivalent advantage, would it not be to the
case and interest of all parties, to encrease the reve∣nue
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
in the manner I have proposed, or any better, if
a better can be devised, and cease the operation of
the fines? I would still keep the militia as an or∣ganized
body of men, and, should there be a real
necessity to call them forth, pay them out of the
proper revenues of the state, and encrease the taxes
a third or fourth per cent. on those who do not at∣tend.
My limits will not allow me to go farther
into this matter, which I shall therefore close with
this remark, that fines are, of all modes of revenue,
the most unsuited to the mind of a free country.
When a man pays a tax, he knows the public ne∣cessity
requires it, and therefore feels a pride in
discharging his duty; but a fine seems an atone∣ment
for neglect of duty, and of consequence, is
paid with discredit, and frequently levied with
with severity.</P>
<P>I have now only one subject more to speak to,
with which I shall conclude, which is, the resolve
of Congress of the 18th of March last, for taking up
and funding the present currency at forty for one,
and issuing new money in its stead.</P>
<P>Every one knows that I am not the flatterer of
Congress but in this instance <HI>they are right</HI>; and if
that measure is supported, the currency will acquire
a value, which, without it, it will not. But this is
not all: It will give relief to the finances until such
time as they can be properly arranged, and save the
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>

<P>I have now waded through a tedious course of
difficult business, and over an untrodden path. The
subject on every point it could be viewed, was en∣tangled
with perplexities, and enveloped in obsurity,
yet such are the resources of America, that she
wants nothing but system to insure success.</P>

<HEAD>On the present State of News.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the arrival of two, if not three packets,
in quick succession, at New York from England, a
variety of unconnected <HI>news</HI> has circulated through
the country, and afforded as great a variety of spe∣culation.</P>
<P>That something is the matter in the cabinet and
councils of our enemies, on the other side of the
water is certain—that they have run their length
of madness, and are under the necessity of changing
their measures may easily be seen into; but to what
this change of measure may amount, or how far
it may correspond with our interest, happiness and
duty, is yet uncertain; and from what we have hi∣therto
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
experienced, we have too much reason to
suspect them in every thing.</P>
<P>I do not address this publication so much to the
people of America as to the British ministry, who∣ever
they may be, for if it is their intention to pro∣mote
any kind of negociation, it is proper they
should know before hand, that the United States
have as much honour as bravery; that they are no
more to be seduced from their alliance, than their
allegiance; that their line of politics is formed, and
not dependant, like that of their enemy, on chance,
and accident.</P>
<P>On our part, in order to know, at any time,
what the British government will do, we have
only to find out what they ought <HI>not</HI> to do, and this
last will be their conduct. For ever changing, and
for ever wrong; too distant from America to im∣prove
circumstances, and too unwise to foresee
them; scheming without principle, and executing
without probability; their whole line of manage∣ment
has hitherto been blunder and baseness.
Every campaign has added to their loss, and every
year to their disgrace; till unable to go on, and
ashamed to go back, their politics have come to a
halt, and all their fine prospects to the halter.</P>
<P>Could our affections forgive, or humanity for∣get
the wounds of an infant country—we might,
under the influence of a momentary oblivion, stand
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
still and laugh. But they are engraven where no
amusement can conceal them, and of a kind for
which there is no recompence. Can ye restore
to us the beloved dead? Can ye say to the
grave, give up the murdered; Can ye obliterate
from our memories those who are no more? Think
not then to tamper with our feelings by insidious
contrivance, nor suffocate our humanity by sedu∣cing
us to dishonour.</P>
<P>In March 1780, I published part of the Crisis,
No. IX, in the newspapers, but did not conclude it
in the following papers, and the remainder has lain
by me till the present day.</P>
<P>There appeared about that time some disposition
in the British cabinet to cease the further prosecu∣tion
of the war, and, as I had formed my opinion,
that whenever such a design should take place, it
would be accompanied with a dishonourable pro∣position
to America, respecting France, I had sup∣pressed
the remainder of that number, not to ex∣pose
the baseness of any such proposition. But
the arrival of the next news from England, declared
her determination to go on with the war, and con∣sequently
as the political object I had then in view
was not become a subject, it is unnecessary in me
to bring it forward, which is the reason it was
never published.</P>
<P>The matter which I allude to in the unpublished
part, I shall now make a quotation of, and apply it
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
as the more enlarged state of things, at this day,
shall make convenient or necessary.</P>
<P>It was as follows:</P>
<P>"By the speeches which have appeared from the
British Parliament, it is easy to perceive to what
impolitic and imprudent excesses their passions and
prejudices, have, in every instance, carried them
during the present war. Provoked at the upright
and honourable treaty between America and France,
they imagined nothing more was necessary to be
done to prevent its final ratification, than to pro∣mise
through the agency of their commissioners,
(Carlisle, Eden, and Johnston) a repeal of their
once offensive acts of parliament. The vanity of
the conceit was as unpardonable, as the experiment
was impolitic. And so convinced am I, of their
wrong ideas of America, that I shall not wonder, if
in their last stage of political phrenzy, they propose
to her, to break her alliance with France, and en∣ter
into one with them. Such a proposition, should
it ever be made, and it has already been more than
once hinted in parliament, would discover such a
disposition to perfidiousness, and such disregard of
honour and morals, as would add the finishing vice
to national corruption.—I do not mention this to
put America on the watch, but to put England on
her guard, that she do not, in the looseness of her
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
heart, envelope in disgrace, every fragment of re∣putation."—Thus far the quotation.</P>
<P>By the complexion of some part of the news,
which has transpired through the New York pa∣pers,
it seems probable that this insidious aera in the
British politics, is beginning to make its appear∣ance.
I wish it may not; for that which is a dis∣grace
to human nature, throws something of a shade
over all the human character, and the individual
feels his share of the wound, that is given to the
whole.</P>
<P>The policy of Britain has ever been to divide
America in some way or other. In the beginning
of the dispute, she practised every art to prevent
or destroy the union of the states, well knowing,
that could she once get them to stand singly, she
could conquer them unconditionally. Failing in
this project in America, she renewed it in Europe;
and after the alliance had taken place, she made se∣cret
offers to France to induce her to give up Ame∣rica,
and what is still more extraordinary, she at
the same time, made propositions to doctor Frank∣lin,
then in Paris, the very court to which she was
secretly applying, to draw off America from France.
But this is not all.</P>
<P>On the 14th of September, 1778, the British
court, through their secretary, lord Weymouth,
made application to the Marquis D'Almadovar the
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
Spanish Ambassador, at London, to "ask the
MEDIATION," for these were the words of the
court of Spain, for the purpose of negociation a
peace with France, leaving America (as I shall
hereafter shew) out of the question. Spain readily
offered her Mediation, and likewise the city of Ma∣drid
as the place of conference, but withal, proposed
that the united States of America should be invited
to the treaty, and considered as independent during
the time the business was negociating. But this
was not the view of England. She wanted to draw
France from the war, that she might uninterruptedly
pour out all her force and fury upon America: and
being disappointed in this plan as well through the
open and generous conduct of Spain, as the deter∣mination
of France, she refused the mediation she
had solicited.</P>
<P>I shall now give some extracts from the justifying
memorial of the Spanish court, in which she has set
the conduct and character of Britain with respect
to America, in a clear and striking point of
light.</P>
<P>The memorial speaking of the refusal of the Bri∣tish
court to meet in conference, with commis∣sioners
from the United States, who were to be
considered as independent during the time of the
conference, says,</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267"/>"It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridicu∣culous,
that the court of London, who treats the
colonies as independent, not only in acting, but of
right, during the war, should have a repugnance to
treat them as such only in acting during a truce of
suspension of hostilities. The convention of Sara∣toga;
the reputing general Burgoyne as a lawful
prisoner, in order to suspend his trial; the exchange
and liberating other prisoners made from the colonies;
they having named Commissioners to go and suppli∣cate
the Americans, at their own doors, request
peace of them, and treat with them and the Congress,
and finally by a thousand other acts of this sort, au∣thorised
by the court of London, which have
been, and are true signs of the acknowledgement of
of their independence.</P>
<P>"In aggravation to all the foregoing, at the same
time the British cabinet answered the king of Spain
in the terms already mentioned; they were insinua∣ting
themselves at the court of France by means of
secret emissaries, and making very great offers to
her to abandon the colonies and make peace
with England. But there is yet more; for at this
same time the English ministry were treating by
means of another certain emissary, with doctor
Franklin, minister plenipotentiary from the colonies,
residing at Paris, to whom they made various pro∣posals
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
to disunite them from France, and accommo∣date
matters with England."</P>
<P>"From what has been observed it evidently fol∣lows,
that the whole of the British politics was to
disunite the two courts of Paris and Madrid, by
means of the suggestions and offers she separately
made to them; and also to separate the colonies
from their treaties and engagements entered into
with France, and induce them to arm against the
house of Bourbon or MORE PROBABLY TO
OPPRESS THEM WHEN THEY FOUND
FROM BREAKING THEIR ENGAGE∣MENTS,
THEY STOOD ALONE AND
WITHOUT PROTECTORS."</P>
<P>"This therefore is the net they laid for the Ame∣rican
states; that is to say, to tempt them with flat∣tering
and very magnificent promises to come to
an accommodation with them, exclusive of any in∣tervention
of Spain or France, that the British mi∣nistry
might always remain the arbiters of the fate
of the colonies.</P>
<P>"But the Catholic king, (the king of Spain)
faithful on the one part to the engagements which
bind him to the most Christian king (the king of
France) his nephew; just and upright on the other,
to his own subjects whom he ought to protect and
guard against so many insults, and finally, full of
humanity and compassion for the Americans and
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
other individuals who suffer in the present war, he
is determined to pursue and prosecute it, and to
make all the efforts in his power, until he can ob∣tain
a solid and permanent peace, with full and sa∣tisfactory
securities that it shall be observed."</P>
<P>Thus far the memorial; a translation of which
into English, may be seen in full, under the head of
STATE PAPERS, in the Annual Register for
1779, page 367.</P>
<P>The extracts I have here given, serve to shew
the various endeavours and contrivances of the ene∣my
to draw France from her connection with Ame∣rica,
and to prevail on her to make a separate peace
with England, leaving America totally out of the
question, and at the mercy of a merciless unprin∣cipled
enemy. The opinion, likewise, which
Spain has formed of the British cabinet character,
for meanness and perfidiousness, is so exactly the
opinion of America, respecting it, that the memo∣rial
in this instance, contains our own sentiments
and language; for people, however remote, who
think alike, will unavoidably speak alike.</P>
<P>Thus we see the insidious use which Britain en∣deavoured
to make of the propositions for peace,
under the mediation of Spain.—I shall now proceed
to the second proposition under the mediation of
the emperor of Germany and the empress of
Russia; the general outline of which was, that a
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
congress of the several powers at war, should meet
at Vienna, in 1781, to settle preliminaries of
peace.</P>
<P>I could wish myself at liberty to make use of
all the information I am possessed of on this sub∣ject;
but as there is a delicacy in the manner, I
do not conceive it prudent, at least at present, to
make references and quotations in the same manner
as I have done with respect to the mediation of
Spain, who published the whole proceedings her∣self;
and, therefore, what comes from me on this
part of the business, must rest on my own credit
with the public, assuring them, that when the
whole proceedings, relative to the proposed con∣gress
at Vienna, shall appear, they shall find my
account not only true but studiously moderate.</P>
<P>We know that at the time this mediation was
on the carpet, the expectations of the British king
and ministry ran high with respect to the conquest
of America. The English packet which was
taken with the mail on board, and carried into
l'Orient, in France, contained letters from lord
G. Germaine to sir Henry Clinton, which ex∣pressed,
in the fullest terms, the ministerial idea of
a total conquest. Copies of those letters were sent
to Congress, and published in the newspapers of
last year. Colonel Laurens brought over the ori∣ginals,
some of which, signed in the hand writing
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
of the then secretary Germaine, are now in my
possession.</P>
<P>Filled with these high ideas, nothing could be
more insolent towards America than the language
of the British court on the proposed meditation.
A peace with France and Spain she anxiously so∣licited;
but America, as before, should be left to
her mercy; neither would she hear any propo∣sitions
for admitting an agent from the United
States into the congress of Vienna.</P>
<P>On the other hand, France with an open, no∣ble,
and manly determination, and the fidelity of
a good ally, would hear no proposition for a se∣parate
peace, nor even meet in congress at Vi∣enna,
without an agent from America: and like∣wise,
that the independant character of the United
States, represented by the agent, should be fully
and unequivocally defined and settled before any
conference should be entered on. The reasoning
of the court of France on the several proposi∣tions
of the two Imperial courts, which relate
to us, is rather in the style of an American,
than an ally; and she advocated the cause of
America, as if she had been America herself.
Thus the second mediation, like the first, proved
ineffectual.</P>
<P>But since that time a reverse of fortune has over∣taken
the British arms, and all their high expecta∣tions
are dashed to the ground. The noble exer∣tions
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
to the southward, under general Green; the
successful operations of the allied armies in the
Chesepeake; the loss of most of their islands in the
West-Indies, and Minorca in the Mediterranean;
the persevering spirit of Spain against Gibraltar;
the expected capture of Jamaica; the failure of
making a separate peace with Holland, and the ex∣pence
of one hundred millions sterling, by which
all these fine losses were obtained, have read them
a loud lesson of disgraceful misfortune, and ne∣cessity
has called on them to change their ground.
in this situation of confusion and despair their pre∣sent
councils have no fixed character. It is now the
hurricane months of British politics. Every day
seems to have a storm of its own, and they are
scudding under the bare poles of hope. Beaten,
but not humble; condemned, but not penitent;
they act like men trembling at fate, and catching at
a straw.—From this convulsion in the intrails of
their politics, it is more than probable that the
mountain groaning in labor, will bring forth a
mouse as to its size, and a monster in its make.
They will try on America the same insidious arts
they tried on France and Spain.</P>
<P>We sometimes experience sensations to which
language is not equal. The conception is too bulky
to be born alive, and in the torture of thinking we
stand dumb. Our feelings, imprisoned by their
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
magnitude, find no way out—and, in the struggle
of expression every finger tries to be a tongue.
The machinery of the body seems too little for the
mind, and we look about for helps to shew our
thoughts by.—Such must be the sensation of
America, whenever Britain, teeming with cor∣ruption,
shall propose to her to sacrifice her
faith.</P>
<P>But, exclusive of the wickedness, there is a per∣sonal
offence contained in every such attempt.
It is calling us villains; for no man asks another to
act the villain unless he believes him inclined to
be one. No man attempts to seduce a truly honest
woman. It is the supposed looseness of her mind
that starts the thoughts of seduction, and he who
offers it calls her a prostitute. Our pride is always
hurt by the same propositions, which offend our
principles; for when we are shocked at the
crime, we are wounded by the suspicion of our
compliance.</P>
<P>Could I convey a thought that might serve to re∣gulate
the public mind, I would not make the in∣terest
of the alliance the basis of defending it. All
the world are moved by interest, and it affords
them nothing to boast of. But I would go a
step higher, and defend it on the ground of
honour and principle. That our public affairs
have flourished under the alliance—that it was
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
wisely made, and has been nobly executed—that
by its assistance we are enabled to preserve our
country from conquest, and expel those who sought
our destruction—that it is our true interest to
maintain it unimpaired, and that while we do so
no enemy can conquer us;—are matters which ex∣perience
has taught us, and the common good
of ourselves, abstracted from principles of faith
and honor, would lead us to maintain the con∣nection.</P>
<P>But over and above the mere letter of the al∣liance,
we have been nobly and generously
treated, and have had the same respect and attention
paid us, as if we had been an old established
country. To oblige, and be obliged, is fair
work among mankind, and we want an oppor∣tunity
of shewing to the world that we are a
people sensible of kindness, and worthy of con∣fidence.
—Character is to us, in our present
circumstances, of more importance than interest.
We are a young nation, just stepping upon the
stage of public life, and the eye of the world is
upon us to see how we act. We have an ene∣my
that is watching to destroy our reputation,
and who will go any length to gain some evi∣dence
against us, that may serve to render
our conduct suspected, and our character odious;
because, could she accomplish this, wicked as it
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
is, the world would withdraw from us, as from
a people not to be trusted, and our task would
then become difficult.</P>
<P>There is nothing sets the character of a nation in
a higher or lower light with others, than the faith∣fully
sulfilling, or perfidiously breaking of treaties.
They are things not to be tampered with; and should
Britain, which seems very probable, propose
to seduce America into such an act of baseness, it
would merit from her some mark of unusual detes∣tation.
It is one of those extraordinary instances in
which we ought not to be contented with the bare
negative of congress, because it is an affront on the
multitude as well as on the government. It goes
on the supposition that the public are not honest
men, and that they may be managed by contrivance
though they cannot be conquered by arms. But,
let the world and Britain know, that we are neither
to be bought nor sold. That our mind is great and
fixt, our prospect clear, and that we will support
our character as firmly as our independence.</P>
<P>But I will go still farther, general Conway, who
made the motion in the British parliament, for dis∣continuing
<HI>offensive</HI> war in America, is a gentleman
of an amiable character. We have no personal
quarrel with him. But he feels not as we feel; he
is not in our situation, and that alone, with out any
other explanation, is enough.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="276"/>
The British parliament supposes they have many
friends in America, and that when all chance of
conquest is over, they will be able to draw her
from her alliance with France. Now, if I have
any conception of the human heart, they will fail
in this, more than in any thing they have yet tried.</P>
<P>This part of the business is not a question of poli∣cy
only but of honour and honesty; and the propo∣sition
will have in it something so visibly low and
base that their partizans, if they have any, will be
ashamed of it. Men are often hurt by a mean ac∣tion
who are not started at a wicked one, and this
will be such a confession of their inability, such a
declaration of servile thinking, that the scandal of it
will ruin all their hopes.</P>
<P>In short, we have nothing to do but to go on
with vigour and determination. The enemy is yet
in our country. They hold New-york, Charles∣ton
and Savannah, and the very being in those pla∣ces
is an offence, and a part of offensive war, and
until they can be driven from, or captured in them,
it would be folly in us to listen to an idle tale. I
take it for granted that the British ministry are sink∣ing
under the impossibility of carrying on the war.
Let them come to a fair and open peace with France,
Spain, Holland and America in the manner she
ought to do; but until then we can have nothing to
say to them.</P>

<HEAD>To Sir Guy Carlton.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the nature of compassion to associate with
misfortune; and I address this to you in behalf even
of an enemy, a captain in the British service, now
on his way to the head quarters of the American
army, and unfortunately doomed to death for a
crime not his own.—A sentence so extraordinary,
an execution so repugnant to every human sensation,
ought never to be told without the circumstances
which produced it; and as the destined victim is yet
in existence, and in your hands rest his life or death,
I shall briefly state the case and the melancholy con∣sequence.</P>
<P>Captain Huddy of the Jersey militia, was attacked
in a small fort on Tom's river, by a party of refu∣gees
in the British pay and service, was made prisoner
together with his company, carried to New-York
and lodged in the provost of that city: about three
weeks after which, he was taken out of the Provost
down to the water-side, put into a boat and brought
again upon the Jersey shore, and there, contrary to
the practice of all nations but savages, was hung up
on a tree, and left hanging until found by our peo∣ple,
who took him down and buried him.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278"/>
The inhabitants of that part of the country where
the murder was committed, sent a deputation to
General Washington with a full and certified state∣ment
of the fact. Struck, as every human breast
must be, with such brutish outrage, and determined
both to punish and prevent it for the future, the ge∣neral
represented the case to General Clinton, who
then commanded, and demanded that the refugee
officer, who ordered and attended the execution,
and whose name is Lippincut, should be delivered
up as a murderer; and in case of refusal, that the
person of some British officer should suffer in his
stead. The demand, though not refused, has
not been complied with; and the melancholy lot,
(not by selection, but by casting lots) has fallen
upon Captain Asgill of the guards, who, as I have
already mentioned, is on his way from Lancaster to
camp, a martyr to the general wickedness of the
cause he engaged in, and the ingratitude of those he
has served.</P>
<P>The first reflection that arises on this black busi∣ness,
is, what sort of men must Englishmen be,
and what sort of order and discipline do they pre∣serve
in their army, when, in the immediate place
of their head quarters, and under the eye and nose
of their commander in chief, a prisoner can be ta∣ken
at pleasure from his confinement, and his death
made a matter of sport.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="279"/>
The history of the most savage Indians does not
produce instances exactly of this kind. They, at
least, have a formality in their punishments. With
them it is the horridness of revenge, but with your
army it is the still greater crime, the horridness of
diversion.</P>
<P>The British generals who have succeeded each
other, from the time of General Gage to yourself,
have all affected to speak in language they have no
right to. In their proclamations, their addresses,
their letters to General Washington, and their sup∣plications
to Congress (for they deserve no other
name), they talk of British honour, British genero∣sity,
and British clemency, as if those things were
matters of fact; whereas, we, whose eyes are open,
who speak the same language with yourselves, many
of whom were born on the same spot with you,
and who can no more be mistaken in your
words, than in your actions, can declare to all
the world, that so far as our knowledge goes,
there is not a more detestable character, nor a
meaner, or more barbarous enemy than the present
British one. With us, you have forfeited all pre∣tentions
of reputation, and it is only holding you
like a wild beast, afraid of your keepers, that you
can be made manageable—But to return to the
point in question:</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="280"/>
Though I can think no man innocent who has
lent his hand to destroy the country which he did
not plant, and to ruin those he could not enslave,
yet abstracted from all ideas of right or wrong on
the original question, Captain Asgyli, in the present
case, is not the guilty man. The villain and the
victim are here separated characters. You hold
the one and we the other. You disown or affect
to disown and reprobate the conduct of Lippencut,
yet you give him sanctuary, and by so doing, you
as effectually become the executioner of Asgill, as
if you put the rope round his neck, and dismissed
him from the world. Whatever your feelings on
this extraordinary occasion may be, are best known
to yourself. Within the grave of our own mind
lies buried the fate of Asgill. He becomes the
corpse of your will, or the survivor of your justice.
Deliver up the one, and you save the other; with∣hold
the one, and the other dies by your choice.</P>
<P>On our part the case is exceeding plain; AN
OFFICER HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM
HIS CONFINEMENT AND MURDERED
AND THE MURDERER IS WITHIN
YOUR LINES. Your army have been guilty
of a thousand instances of equal cruelty, but they
have been rendered equivocal, and sheltered from
personal detection. Here the crime is fixt; and
is one of those extraordinary cases, which can nei∣ther
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
be denied nor palliated, and to which the
custom os war does not apply; for it never could
be supposed, that such a brutal outrage would ever
be committed. It is an original in the history of
civilized barbarians, and is truly British.</P>
<P>On your part, you are accountable to us for the
personal safety of the prisoners within your walls.
Here can be no mistake: they can neither be spies
nor suspected as such; your security is not endan∣gered,
nor your operations subjected to miscarriage,
by men immured within a dungeon. They differ
in every cirumstance from men in the field, and
leave no pretence for severity of punishment. But
if to the dismal condition of captivity with you,
must be added the constant apprehensions of death;
if to be imprisoned is so nearly to be entombed,
and, if after all, the murderers are to be protected,
and thereby the crime encouraged, wherein do you
differ from Indians, either in conduct or character.</P>
<P>We can have no idea of your honour, or your
justice in any future transaction, of what nature it
may be, while you shelter within your lines an out∣rageous
murderer, and sacrifice in his stead, an
officer of your own. If you have no regard to us
at least spare the blood which it is your duty to
save. Whether the puishment will be greater on
him, whom in this case innocently dies, or on him
whom sad necessity forces to retaliate, is, in the
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
nicety of sensation, an undecided Question? It
rests with you to prevent the sufferings of both.
You have nothing to do but to give up the murder∣er,
and the matter ends.</P>
<P>But to protect him, be he who he may, is to pa∣tronize
his crime, and to trifle it off by frivolous and
and unmeaning enquiries is to promote it. There
is no declaration you can make, no promise you can
give that will obtain credit. It is the man and not
the apology that is demanded.</P>
<P>You see yourself pressed on all sides to spare the
life of your own officer, for die he will if you with∣hold
justice. The murder of captain Huddy is an
offence not to be borne with, and there is no security
we can have that such actions, or similar ones shall
not be repeated, but by making the punishment fall
upon yourselves. To destroy the last security of
captivity, and to take the unarmed, the unresisting
prisoner to private and sportive execution, is carry∣ing
barbarity too high for silence. The evil must
be put an end to, and the choice of persons rests
with you. But if your attachment to the guilty is
stronger than to the innocent, you invent a crime
that must destroy your character, and if the cause
of your King needs to be supported, for ever cease,
sir, to torture our remembrance with the wretched
phrases of British honour, British generosity, and
British clemency.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="283"/>
From this melancholy circumstance, learn, sir, a
lesson of morality. The refugees are men whom
your predecessors have instructed in wickedness, the
better to fit them to their master's purpose. To
make them useful they have made them vile, and the
consequence of their tortured villainy is now descen∣ding
on the heads of their encouragers. They have
been trained like hounds to the scent of blood, and
cherished in every species of dissolute barbarity.
Their ideas of right and wrong are worn away in
the constant habitude of repeated infamy, till like
men practised in executions, they feel not the value
of another's life,</P>
<P>The task before you though painful is not diffi∣cult;
give up the murderer, and save your officer,
as the first outset of a necessary reformation.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. XIV<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same diligent search and enquiry was made for the 13th as for the 11th number—without success.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>"THE times that tried mens souls,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"These are the times that try mens souls." Crisis No. 1, published December 19, 1776.</NOTE> are over
and the greatest and completest revolution the
world ever knew, gloriously and happily accom∣plished.</P>
<P>But to pass from the extremes of danger to
safety, from the tumult of war to the tranquility
of peace, though sweet in contemplation, re∣quires
a gradual composure of the senses to re∣ceive
it. Even calmness has the power of stunning
when it opens too instantly upon us. The long
and raging hurricane that should cease in a mo∣ment,
would leave us in a state rather of won∣der
than enjoyment; and some moments of recol∣lection
must pass, before we could be capable of
tasting the full felicity of repose. There are but
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
few instances, in which the mind is fitted for
sudden transitions: It takes in its pleasures by re∣flection
and comparison, and those must have
time to act before the relish for new scenes is
complete.</P>
<P>In the present case—the mighty magnitude
of the object—the various uncertainties of fate
it has undergone—the numerous and complicated
dangers we have suffered or escaped—the emi∣nence
we now stand on, and the vast prospect
before us, must all conspire to impress us with con∣templation.</P>
<P>To see it in our power to make a world happy
—to teach mankind the art of being so—to ex∣hibit
on the theatre of the universe, a character hi∣therto
unknown—and to have, as it were, a new
creation entrusted to our hands, are honors that
command reflection, and can neither be too highly
estimated, nor too gratefully received.</P>
<P>In this pause then of recollection—while the
storm is ceasing, and the long agitated mind vi∣brating
to a rest, let us look back on the scenes we
have passed, and learn from experience what is yet
to be done.</P>
<P>Never, I say, had a country so many openings to
happiness as this. Her setting out into life, like
the rising of a fair morning, was unclouded and
promising. Her cause was good. Her princi∣pals
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
just and liberal. Her temper serene and firm.
Her conduct regulated by the nicest steps, and
every thing about her wore the mark of honour.</P>
<P>It is not every country (perhaps there is not ano∣ther
in the world) that can boast so fair an origin.
Even the first settlement of America corresponds
with the character of the revolution. Rome, once
the proud mistress of the universe, was originally
a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her
rich, and her oppression of millions made her great.
But America needs never be ashamed to tell her
birth, nor relate the stages by which she rose to
empire.</P>
<P>The remembrance then of what is past, if it
operates rightly, must inspire her with the most
laudable of all ambition, that of adding to the
fair fame she began with. The world has seen her
great in adversity. Struggling without a thought
of yielding beneath accumulated difficulties.
Bravely, nay proudly, encountering distress, and
rising in resolution as the storm encreased. All
this is justly due to her, for her fortitude has
merited the character. Let then the world see that
she can bear prosperity: and that her honest virtue
in time of peace, is equal to the bravest virtue in
time of war.</P>
<P>She is now descending to the scenes of quiet and
domestic life. Not beneath the cypress shade of
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
disappointment, but to enjoy in her own land,
and under her own vine, the sweet of her labors,
and the reward of her toil. In this situation, may
she never forget that a fair national reputation is
of as much importance as independence. That it
possesses a charm which wins upon the world, and
makes even enemies civil. That it gives a dignity
which is often superior to power, and commands a
reverence where pomp and splendor fail.</P>
<P>It would be a circumstance ever to be lamented
and never to be forgotten, were a single blot, from
any cause whatever, suffered to fall on a revolution,
which to the end of time must be an honor to the
age that accomplished it: and which has contributed
more to enlighten the world, and diffuse a spirit of
freedom and liberality among mankind, than any
human event (if this may be called one) that ever
preceded it.</P>
<P>It is not among the least of the calamities of a
long continued war, that it unhinges the mind from
those nice sensations which at other times appear so
amiable. The continual spectacle of woe, blunts
the finer feelings, and the necessity of bearing with
the sight, renders it familiar. In like manner, are
many of the moral obligations of society weakened,
till the custom of acting by necessity, becomes an
apology, where it is truly a crime. Yet let but a
nation conceive rightly of its character, and it will
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
be chastly just in protecting it. None ever began
with a fairer than America, and none can be under
a greater obligation to preserve it.</P>
<P>The debt which America has contracted, com∣pared
with the cause she has gained, and the ad∣vantages
to flow from it, ought scarcely to be men∣tioned.
She has it in her choice to do, and to live
as happily as she pleases. The world is in her
hands. She has no foreign power to monopolize
her commerce, perplex her legislation, or con∣troul
her prosperity. The struggle is over, which
must one day have happened, and perhaps, never
could have happended at a better time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the revolution began at the exact period of time best fitted to the purpose, is sufficiently proved by the event—But the great hinge on which the whole ma∣chine turned is the UNION OF THE STATES: and this union was naturally produced by the inability of any one state to support itself against any foreign enemy with∣out the assistance of the rest.</P>
<P>Had the states severally been less able than they were when the war began, their united strength would not have been equal to the undertaking, and they must, in all hu∣man probability have failed—And on the other hand, had they severally been more able, they might not have seen, or what is more, might not have felt the necessity of uniting; and either by attempting to stand alone, or in small confederacies, would have been separately con∣quered.</P>
<P>Now, as we cannot see a time (and many years must pass away before it can arrive) when the strength of any one state, or several united, can be equal to the whole of the present United States, and as we have seen the ex∣treme difficulty of collectively prosecuting the war to a successful issue, and preserving our national importance in the world, therefore, from the experience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we must, unless we make a waste of wisdom, be strongly impressed with the advantage, as well as the necessity of strengthening that happy union which has been our salvation, and without which, we should have been a ruined people.</P>
<P>While I was writing this note, I cast my eye on the pamphlet COMMON SENSE, from which I shall make an extract, as it applies exactly to the case. It is as follows:</P>
<P>"I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confessed his opinion that a sepa∣ration between the countries would take place one time or other: And there is no instance in which we have shewn less judgment, than in endeavouring to describe, what we call, the ripeness or fitness of the continent for independence.</P>
<P>"As all men allow the measure, and differ only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey of things, and endeavour, if possible, to find out the VERY TIME. But we need not go far, the enquiry ceases at once, for, THE TIME HATH FOUND US. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact.</P>
<P>"It is not in numbers, but in a union, that our great strength lies. The continent is just arrived at that pitch of strength, in which no single colony is able to support itself, and the whole when united, can accomplish the matter; and either more or less than this, might be fatal in its effects."</P></NOTE>. And
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
instead of a domineering master, she has gained an
<HI>ally,</HI> whose exemplary greatness, and universal li∣berality,
have extorted a confession even from her
enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290"/>
With the blessings of peace, independence, and
an universal commerce, the states individually, and
collectively, will have leisure and opportunity to re∣gulate
and establish their domestic concerns, and
to put it beyond the power of calumny to throw
the least reflection on their honor. Character is
much easier kept than recovered, and that man, if
any such there be, who, from any sinister views, or
littleness of soul, lends unseen his hand to injure it,
contrives a wound it will never be in his power to
heal.</P>
<P>As we have established an inheritance for pos∣terity,
let that inheritance descend, with every mark
of an honourable conveyance. The little it will
cost, compared with the worth of the states, the
greatness of the object, and the value of national
character, will be a profitable exchange.</P>
<P>But that which must more forcibly strike a
thoughtful penetrating mind, and which includes
and renders easy all inferior concerns, is the
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
UNION OF THE STATES. On this, our great
national character depends. It is this which must
give▪ us importance abroad and security at home.
It is through this only that we are, or can be
nationally known in the world. It is the flag
of the United States which renders our ships
and commerce safe on the seas, or in a foreign
port. Our Mediterranean passes must be ob∣tained
under the same stile. All our treaties,
whether of alliance, peace or commerce, are
formed under the sovereignty of the United
States, and Europe knows us by no other name
or title.</P>
<P>The division of the empire into states is for
our own convenience, but abroad this distinction
ceases. The affairs of each state are local.
They can go no farther than to itself. And
were the whole worth of even the richest of
them expended in revenue, it would not be suf∣ficient
to support sovereignty against a foreign
attack. In short, we have no other national so∣vereignty
than as United States. It would even
be fatal for us if we had—too expensive to be
maintained, and impossible to be supported. In∣dividuals
or individual states may call themselves
what they please; but the world, and especially
the world of enemies, is not to be held in awe by
the whistling of a name. Sovereignty must have
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
power to protect all the parts that compose and
constitute it: and as UNITED STATES we are
equal to the importance of the title, but otherwise
we are not. Our union well and wisely regulated
and cemented, is the cheapest way of being great,
the easiest way of being powerful, and the hap∣piest
invention in government, which the cir∣cumstances
of America can admit of—Because it
collects from each state, that, which, by being in∣adequate,
can be of no use to it, and forms an ag∣gregate
that serves for all.</P>
<P>The states of Holland are an unfortunate instance
of the effects of individual sovereignty. Their
disjointed condition exposes them to numerous in∣trigues,
losses, calamities and enemies; and the
almost impossibility of bringing their measures to a
decision, and that decision into execution, is to
them, and would be to us, a source of endless mis∣fortune.</P>
<P>It is with confederated states, as with individuals
in society; something must be yielded up to make
the whole secure. In this view of things, we gain
by what we give, and draw an annual interest
greater than the capital.—I ever feel myself
hurt when I hear the union, that great palladium of
our liberty and safety, the least irreverently spoken
of. It is the most sacred thing in the constitution
of America, and that, which every man should be
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
most proud and tender of. Our citizenship in the
United states is our national character. Our citi∣zenship
in any particular state, is only our local dis∣tinction.
By the latter, we are known at home, by
the former to the world. Our great title is,
AMERICANS—our inferior one varies with the
place.</P>
<P>So far as my endeavours could go, they have all
been directed to conciliate the affections, unite the
interests, and draw and keep the mind of the coun∣try
together; and the better to assist in this founda∣tion
work of the revolution, I have avoided all
places of profit or office, either in the state I live
in, or in the United States; kept myself at a dis∣tance
from all parties and party connections, and
even disregarded all private and inferior concerns:
and when we take into view the great work we have
gone through, and feel as we ought to feel, the just
importance of it, we shall then see, that the little
wranglings, and indecent contentions of personal
party, are as dishonourable to our characters, as
they are injurious to our repose.</P>
<P>It was the cause of America that made me an
author. The force with which it struck my
mind, and the dangerous condition of the coun∣try
appeared to me in, by courting an impossi∣ble
and unnatural reconciliation with those who
were determined to reduce her, instead of striking
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
out into the only line that could cement and
save her, A DECLARATION OF INDE∣PENDENCE,
made it impossible for me, feeling
as I did, to be silent: and if, in the course of
more than seven years, I have rendered her any
service, I have likewise added something to the
reputation of literature, by freely and disinterestedly
employing it in the great cause of mankind,
and shewing there may be genius without pros∣titution.</P>
<P>Independence always appeared to me practi∣cable
and probable; provided the sentiment of
the country could be formed, and held to the
object; and there is no instance in the world,
where a people so extended, and wedded to for∣mer
habits of thinking, and under such a variety
of circumstances, were so instantly and ineffectu∣ally
pervaded, by a turn in politics, as in the
case of independence, and who supported their
opinon, undiminished, through such a succession
of good and ill-fortune, till they crowned it with
success.</P>
<P>But as the scenes of war are closed, and every
man preparing for home and happier times, I
therefore take my leave of the subject. I have
most sincerely followed it from beginning to end,
and through all its turns and windings: and what∣ever
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
country I may hereafter be in, I shall always
feel an honest pride at the part I have taken and
acted, and a gratitude to Nature and Providence
for putting it in my power to be of some use to
mankind.</P>
